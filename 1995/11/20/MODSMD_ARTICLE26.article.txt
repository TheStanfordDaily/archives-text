## Run for NCAA glory Top-10 cross country squads make return trip to Iowa St. 
### Ed Guzman Contributing writer 
They have already proven themselves
as two of the four best squads in their dis
trict, yet Stanford's nationally-ranked
men's and women's cross country teams
will once again face a test today as they
confront the best teams in the country in
the NCAA Cross Country Championships
in Ames, lowa.
The Cardinal are no strangers to lowa
State's cross country course. On Oct. 14,
the men and women took part in the lowa
State Memorial Classic, finishing first and
third, respectively, against a competitive
field.
"It's good to know we've been there,"
said head coach Vin Lananna. "We have a
pretty good sense of how the course runs."
However, he cautions that it could all
depend on how the athletes view the expe
rience of running in the Memorial Classic.
According to the coach, if his harriers hold
that event in a positive light, then the Car
dinal should enjoy a productive day.

It's good to know we've
been there. We have a
pretty good sense of how
the course runs.'
— Vin Lananna

The fifth-ranked men's team is riding
the momentum of its first-ever District-8
championship. After surviving rain-swept
Woodland, Wash., the Cardinal hopes to
improve on last year's sixth-place perfor
mance at NCAAs. The 10,000 meter race
features cross country powerhouses such
as No. 1 Oklahoma State, No. 2 Wisconsin,
No. 4 Arkansas and No. 6 Oregon, Stan
ford's nemesis in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence.
Junior Greg Jimmerson will once again
look to lead the Cardinal. He ran last

month's 8,000 meter lowa race in 26 min
utes, 47 seconds. Sophomore Nathan Nut
ter and junior J.J. White will also pace
Stanford. However, Lananna will rest
junior James Long and run freshman
Jason Balkman in the 22-team competi
tion.

'I'm feeling optimistic.
The men look fit and com
posed. [Dunscombe's
addition] was a wonder
fully planned lineup
change. The women will
run great.'
— Win Lananna

Meanwhile, the eighth-ranked Stanford
women will benefit from a lineup change.
The Cardinal will welcome back sopho
more star Kortney Dunscombe, who was
resting a bad back for the last few weeks.
She adds depth to an already deep squad.
Freshman Mary Cobb, sophomore Sarna
Renfro and junior Monal Chokshi, who all
ran in the lowa State event last month in
times of 17:24, 17:50 and 18:01, respec
tively, will once again spearhead Stanford.
Considering that the women blazed the
5,000 meter course in October, their
chances of bettering last year's seventh
place NCAA finish may seem promising.
However, the Cardinal must contend with
several top-flight programs, including No.
1 Providence, Pac-10 rivals Oregon, Ari
zona and Washington and six-time defend
ing national champion Villanova, among
others in the 22-team meet.
"I'm feeling optimistic," Lananna said.
"The men look fit and composed. [Dun
scombe's addition 1 was a wonderfully
planned lineup change. The women will
run great."
