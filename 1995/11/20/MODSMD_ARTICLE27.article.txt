If practice makes perfect, then the No. 3 Stanford
women's volleyball team (25-2 overall, 18-0 Pacific
10 Conference) should be the best team in the
nation.
Despite competing in the toughest conference in
the nation from top to bottom, the Cardinal com
pleted its first undefeated trip through the Pac-10 in
four years last weekend, defeating Oregon and Ore
gon State on the road in convincing fashion.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal, which has now won 22
consecutive matches, moved up only one spot in the
Volleyball Magazine national rankings this week,
passing the Florida Gators.
Failing to drop a game for the seventh and eighth
consecutive matches, Stanford swept the Beavers
15-12, 15-4, 15-9 on Saturday and buried the Ducks
15-8, 15-4, 15-6 on Friday.
Stanford closed out its Pac-10 season methodical
ly, cruising to victory in game three against Oregon
State. The Cardinal has relied on its depth all sea
son, and the Beavers wore down in the match's final
game.

the Cardinal pulled out a 15-12 vic

Stanford has lost the initial game
nine times this season.
In practically every match this
season, however, Stanford
showed its best in game two. The
pattern held true against Oregon
State, as the Cardinal never
allowed the Beavers to string
points together. Stanford raced t<
a 15-4 victory and went into tin
break ahead two games to none.
The Beavers' loss dropped
them to 13-1 (S on the season, (J-1 '2
in the Pac-10. Oregon State will
finish eighth in the conference.
Friday night's match featured
an even more dominating perfor
mance by the Cardinal. Having
won only one conference match all
year, t he Ducks figured to offer lit

tie resistance, and the match fol
lowed their expectations perfectly.
Though Stanford played better
in game two than in games one and
three, the Cardinal was never in
jeopardy of dropping a game. In the
18 matches it played in the Pac-10,
Stanford drop|>ed only six games.
Alter finishing league competi
tion undefeated, Stanford can now
look ahead to the upcoming NCAA
tournament, where the Cardinal
will seek to defend its national
championship. Due to a revised
tournament pairings process, Stan
ford may not get to play its regional
matches on the West Coast. The
new system places the Hig Eight,
with No. 1 Nebraska as its champi
on, in the same region as tin- ('ardi
nal. If, as is expected, the Huskers
get the No. 1 seed in the West,
Stanford will most likely receive a
No. I seed in another region.
Nonetheless, for Stanford,
there still remains tomorrow
evening's regular-season ending
confrontation with San Francis
co. The match will be senior night
at Maples Pavilion, where Stan
ford will honor its four graduat
ing seniors. All students will be
admitted free to the match, which
