# Big triumph for water polo, 11-7
## 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
The men's water polo contest
between Stanford and California
the day of Big Game is dubbed Big
Splash, and the name proved
appropriate last Saturday. Indeed,
the third-ranked Golden Bears
(16-6) were a flop, as the fifth
ranked Cardinal (15-9, 3-5 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
drowned the water weenies 11-7 at
deGuerre Pool.
Last weekend's match marked
the 88th time that the two schools
have tangled since 1974, and the
fourth time this season. With its
win on Saturday, the Cardinal
evened the seasonal series at two
games apiece. In all, Stanford has
now taken 41 matches from the
Bears, and the 41st victory came in
impressive fashion.
"I felt that we played a very
good game," said Cardinal head
coach Dante Dettamanti. "Obvi
ously, there were some mistakes,
but I thought that the guys played
well in all facets of the game."
The game started out as a dog
fight — a classic matchup between
arch-rivals who have historically
dominated collegiate water polo.
The Bears got on the board first
when freshman Ryan Cochrane
notched a goal two-and-a-half min
utes into the game. Cardinal
senior Jeremy Laster knotted the
score at one when he successfully
converted a penalty shot for the
Cardinal three minutes, 23 sec
onds into the confrontation.
Senior two-meter man Brent
Albright then gave the Bears what
would prove to be their final lead of
the game just 22 seconds later.
With 35 seconds remaining in
the first period, Stanford center
forward Brian Wallin muscled the
ball into the net, pulling the Cardi-

nal even with Cai. The Cardinal
then exploded in the second quar
ter, hammering in four goals while
completely shutting down the
Bears. The scoring opened with
Wallin lining another shot past Cal
goalie Toby Dommer. Senior Brian
Pyle then scored on a counterat
tack after beating his man down
the pool to receive a pass from
junior Tyrone Miller.
Senior Daniel Lehoczky regis
tered another goal in the transi
tion game with three minutes left
in the first half. Cal held a man-up
advantage alter sophomore Layne
Beaubien was ejected. However, as
a Cal player took a shot from the
perimeter, Lehoczky took off the
other way. Senior goalie Jack
Bowen pulled the ball down with
two hands and, seeing Lehoczky
heading towards the Cal goal,
passed the ball right on target to
the open man. Lehoczky received
the ball at full speed and beat
Dommer.
With 1:07 remaining in the half,
Laster made his second penalty
shoot of the game to put the Cardi
nal up by four goals. Going into the
break, Stanford was leading 6-2.
Things continued to go the Car
dinal's way to begin the second
half. Laster flicked a quick shot
past Dommer from the two-meter
spot for his third goal of the game,
extending the Cardinal lead to five
goals. Stanford then continued to
punish the Bears with its counter
attack. Bowen made a length-of
the-pool pass to senior I)an Han
cock, who then dumped the ball t<
Beaubien right in front of the goal
Beaubien buried a shot in the back
of the net, giving the Cardinal a six
goal lead, 8-2.
The only point that Cal could
muster in the third quarter camc
from Cochrane, who notched hi*
second goal of the contest. The Car
dinal answered the Bears' goal with
one of its own when junior Michael
Rosenthal sneaked a shot under
Dommer's arm. Heading into the
final period of play, the Cardinal
held a commanding 9-3 advantage.
But the game wasn't quite over
yet. Instead, the Stanford faithful
experienced quite a scare when the
Bears started things off in the
fourth quarter by scoring three
consecutive goals on two penalty

shots and a third field goal from
Cochrane.
With visions of Stanford's match
two weeks ago against UCI j\, in
which the Cardinal squandered a
four-goal lead with less than four
minutes to play, Dettamanti called
a timeout to talk to his players and
disrupt Cal's momentum.
The strategy worked, as the
Cardinal came out of the timeout
to score two consecutive goals.
Stanford was first awarded a
penalty shot, which Lehoczky con
verted. Ix'hoczky then registered
another goal, his third of the game,
on a Stanford six-on-five, restoring
the Cardinal lead to five at 1 l-(i.
Still, Cal would not collapse. The
Bears tallied their seventh goal to
pull back within four points. Cal
had an opportunity to make things
close when it w;is awarded consecu
tive six-on-five situations. But both
times, Bowen made sensational
stops on shots from near point*
blank range to seal the fate of the

hapless Bears.
Six-on-five situations proved to
be the key. Cal had 10 man-up
advantages but was unable to con
vert on any of them. The Cardinal
likewise emerged empty-handed
when it held superior numbers,
going 0-5 in those situations. Nev
ertheless, it wjls clearly the Bears
who were hurt the most by the
stingy defenses.
"We did something a little differ
ent against Cal," Dettamanti said.
"We were using a more Kuropean
style of defense that really seemed
to work well. And even though our
six-on-five wjusn't that great, the
guys were really countering well.
"I think that this was a great
game for us heading into the
MPSF tourney. The guys are up
from beating Cal, and 1 think that
we have generated some momen
tum, which is important. All in all,
1 was very pleased. I think that
everything is starting to come

ously, there were some mistakes,
but I thought that the guys played
well in all facets of the game."
The game started out as a dog
fight — a classic matchup between
arch-rivals who have historically
dominated collegiate water polo.
The Bears got on the board first
when freshman Ryan Cochrane
notched a goal two-and-a-half min
utes into the game. Cardinal
senior Jeremy Laster knotted the
score at one when he successfully
converted a penalty shot for the
Cardinal three minutes, 23 sec
onds into the confrontation.
Senior two-meter man Brent
Albright then gave the Bears what
would prove to be their final lead of
the game just 22 seconds later.
With 35 seconds remaining in
the first period, Stanford center
forward Brian Wallin muscled the
ball into the net, pulling the Cardi-

Stanford 11
California 7

nal even with Cai. The Cardinal
then exploded in the second quar
ter, hammering in four goals while
completely shutting down the
Bears. The scoring opened with
Wallin lining another shot past Cal
goalie Toby Dommer. Senior Brian
Pyle then scored on a counterat
tack after beating his man down
the pool to receive a pass from
junior Tyrone Miller.
Senior Daniel Lehoczky regis
tered another goal in the transi
tion game with three minutes left
in the first half. Cal held a man-up
advantage alter sophomore Layne
Beaubien was ejected. However, as
a Cal player took a shot from the
perimeter, Lehoczky took off the
other way. Senior goalie Jack
Bowen pulled the ball down with
two hands and, seeing Lehoczky
heading towards the Cal goal,
passed the ball right on target to
the open man. Lehoczky received
the ball at full speed and beat
Dommer.
With 1:07 remaining in the half,
Laster made his second penalty
shoot of the game to put the Cardi
nal up by four goals. Going into the
break, Stanford was leading 6-2.
Things continued to go the Car
dinal's way to begin the second
half. Laster flicked a quick shot
past Dommer from the two-meter
spot for his third goal of the game,
extending the Cardinal lead to five
goals. Stanford then continued to
punish the Bears with its counter
attack. Bowen made a length-of
the-pool pass to senior I)an Han
cock, who then dumped the ball t<
Beaubien right in front of the goal
Beaubien buried a shot in the back
of the net, giving the Cardinal a six
goal lead, 8-2.
The only point that Cal could
muster in the third quarter camc
from Cochrane, who notched hi*
second goal of the contest. The Car
dinal answered the Bears' goal with
one of its own when junior Michael
Rosenthal sneaked a shot under
Dommer's arm. Heading into the
final period of play, the Cardinal
held a commanding 9-3 advantage.
But the game wasn't quite over
yet. Instead, the Stanford faithful
experienced quite a scare when the
Bears started things off in the
fourth quarter by scoring three
consecutive goals on two penalty

shots and a third field goal from
Cochrane.
With visions of Stanford's match
two weeks ago against UCI j\, in
which the Cardinal squandered a
four-goal lead with less than four
minutes to play, Dettamanti called
a timeout to talk to his players and
disrupt Cal's momentum.
The strategy worked, as the
Cardinal came out of the timeout
to score two consecutive goals.
Stanford was first awarded a
penalty shot, which Lehoczky con
verted. Ix'hoczky then registered
another goal, his third of the game,
on a Stanford six-on-five, restoring
the Cardinal lead to five at 1 l-(i.
Still, Cal would not collapse. The
Bears tallied their seventh goal to
pull back within four points. Cal
had an opportunity to make things
close when it w;is awarded consecu
tive six-on-five situations. But both
times, Bowen made sensational
stops on shots from near point*
blank range to seal the fate of the

hapless Bears.
Six-on-five situations proved to
be the key. Cal had 10 man-up
advantages but was unable to con
vert on any of them. The Cardinal
likewise emerged empty-handed
when it held superior numbers,
going 0-5 in those situations. Nev
ertheless, it wjls clearly the Bears
who were hurt the most by the
stingy defenses.
"We did something a little differ
ent against Cal," Dettamanti said.
"We were using a more Kuropean
style of defense that really seemed
to work well. And even though our
six-on-five wjusn't that great, the
guys were really countering well.
"I think that this was a great
game for us heading into the
MPSF tourney. The guys are up
from beating Cal, and 1 think that
we have generated some momen
tum, which is important. All in all,
1 was very pleased. I think that
everything is starting to come
together for the team."

Senior Brian Pyle makes a big splash in the Cardinal's 11-7 triumph over Cal.
The men's water polo contest
between Stanford and California
the day of Big Game is dubbed Big
Splash, and the name proved
appropriate last Saturday. Indeed,
the third-ranked Golden Bears
(16-6) were a flop, as the fifth
ranked Cardinal (15-9, 3-5 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
drowned the water weenies 11-7 at
deGuerre Pool.
Last weekend's match marked
the 88th time that the two schools
have tangled since 1974, and the
fourth time this season. With its
win on Saturday, the Cardinal
evened the seasonal series at two
games apiece. In all, Stanford has
now taken 41 matches from the
Bears, and the 41st victory came in
impressive fashion.
"I felt that we played a very
