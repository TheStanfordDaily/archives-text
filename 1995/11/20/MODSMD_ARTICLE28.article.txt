The men's water polo contest
between Stanford and California
the day of Big Game is dubbed Big
Splash, and the name proved
appropriate last Saturday. Indeed,
the third-ranked Golden Bears
(16-6) were a flop, as the fifth
ranked Cardinal (15-9, 3-5 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
drowned the water weenies 11-7 at
deGuerre Pool.
Last weekend's match marked
the 88th time that the two schools
have tangled since 1974, and the
fourth time this season. With its
win on Saturday, the Cardinal
evened the seasonal series at two
games apiece. In all, Stanford has
now taken 41 matches from the
Bears, and the 41st victory came in
impressive fashion.
"I felt that we played a very
good game," said Cardinal head
coach Dante Dettamanti. "Obvi
ously, there were some mistakes,
but I thought that the guys played
well in all facets of the game."
The game started out as a dog
fight â€” a classic matchup between
arch-rivals who have historically
dominated collegiate water polo.
The Bears got on the board first
when freshman Ryan Cochrane
notched a goal two-and-a-half min
utes into the game. Cardinal
senior Jeremy Laster knotted the
score at one when he successfully
converted a penalty shot for the
Cardinal three minutes, 23 sec
onds into the confrontation.
Senior two-meter man Brent
Albright then gave the Bears what
would prove to be their final lead of
the game just 22 seconds later.
With 35 seconds remaining in
the first period, Stanford center
forward Brian Wallin muscled the
ball into the net, pulling the Cardi-

nal even with Cai. The Cardinal
then exploded in the second quar
ter, hammering in four goals while
completely shutting down the
Bears. The scoring opened with
Wallin lining another shot past Cal
goalie Toby Dommer. Senior Brian
Pyle then scored on a counterat
tack after beating his man down
the pool to receive a pass from
junior Tyrone Miller.
Senior Daniel Lehoczky regis
tered another goal in the transi
tion game with three minutes left
in the first half. Cal held a man-up
advantage alter sophomore Layne
Beaubien was ejected. However, as
a Cal player took a shot from the
perimeter, Lehoczky took off the
other way. Senior goalie Jack
Bowen pulled the ball down with
two hands and, seeing Lehoczky
heading towards the Cal goal,
passed the ball right on target to
the open man. Lehoczky received
the ball at full speed and beat
Dommer.
With 1:07 remaining in the half,
Laster made his second penalty
shoot of the game to put the Cardi
nal up by four goals. Going into the
break, Stanford was leading 6-2.
Things continued to go the Car
dinal's way to begin the second
half. Laster flicked a quick shot
past Dommer from the two-meter
spot for his third goal of the game,
extending the Cardinal lead to five
goals. Stanford then continued to
punish the Bears with its counter
attack. Bowen made a length-of
