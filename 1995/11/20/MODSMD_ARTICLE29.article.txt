Despite the mysterious disappearance
of all-pro blocker Sam "A steroid a day
keeps the doctor away" Wu, The Stanford
Daily conquered The Daily Californian 20-
18 Saturday in the annual pre-Big Game
flag football contest known as Ink Bowl.
The win, which extended The Daily
winning streak to three years, broke a two
year correlation between Stanford Ink
Bowl victories and Big Game losses.
"Since I'm writing this story, I'll say
that it had something to do with my coach
ing," said Daily Editor in Chief Sarah
"You're lucky I only overslept by half an
hour" Katz. "But since hardly anyone
showed up to practice, it's probably real
talent on the team's part."
The cannon arm and lightening-bolt
speed of quarterback Ratha "I only roll to
the right" Harntha guided the team to vic
tory, though various receivers saved the
day. In particular, news writer Jared "I've
only written one story" Kopf flew upside
down to retrieve an errant Harntha pass
intended for Reagan "Thank God I play
better than I pick 'em" Demas, scoring The
Daily's first touchdown.
Demas caught the second touchdown
pass, and the team pulled together for the
two-point conversion following the play.
Defensively, The Daily had to contend
with a bearded lady and a Cal student who
bore a striking resemblance to Andre the
Giant. With exemplary play by Sports Edi
tor Daniel "The Cowboys could use me"
Kao find Matt "I still work here" Garling
house, The Daily prevented a plethora of
fourth-down conversions and two-point
attempts.
Writers Bobby "Give me the MVP"

Cuza and Brian "This is the most time I've
spent around Daily staffers in weeks"
Singer pulled in giant interceptions. Cuza
also went deep for a Harntha pass to score
The Daily's final touchdown in one of the
only effective planned plays of the day.
Backpedaling even further on affirma
tive action, The Daily Cal sidelined their
women for the entire game, while The
Daily itself saw play from writer Sarah "I
need a new first name" Cameron and
News Editor Elizabeth "Football is the
best thing I've learned all year" Goldman.
The Daily benefited (in some cases)
from the play of Otero residents Adam
"I'm wearing red for a change!" Kemezis,
Perry "This is better than the Supreme
Court" Chen and Adrian "I'm too good at
this to work for news" Keatinge-Clay.
Seth "Out of my way" Goldstein, James
"Great blocking, no interceptions"
Wheaton and Jimmy "I'm not wearing
appropriate shoes" Boegle added support.
Special kudos go to John "Cardinal Today
is a rip-off" Lawson, who injured his ankle
in the line of duty.
As usual, assorted ringers contributed to
The Daily's success. Most noticeable was
play by Frank "Last year, this game was all
me" Kolor and officiating by Jeremy "Hold
ing? Offsides? It's all the same sign" Stone.
The game could not have been won
without help from the sidelines. Jesse
"You have to love me now" Oxfeld made
perhaps the most important play with his
run for drinks, while former Daily staffers
Rajiv "Drink with me" Chandrasekaran
and Julie "I'll play if we're winning" Maki
nen, as well as former editor Andy "Hang
over" Dworkin, inspired the team to great
ness. Other fans came too, but this is
already over length. You know who you are
and we appreciate you.
