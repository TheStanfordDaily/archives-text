# No grapes for Stern
## More than 2-1 choose ban 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Contributing writer 
For students who have been active in
the effort to ban grapes from campus
dining halls, the past weekend's vote in
Stern represents a significant, if unsur
prising, victory.
With more than two-thirds of the
population turning out, Stern Hall ap
proved a boycott of grapes by a margin
0f266 to 1 03. Abstention was an official
option on the ballot; 49 residents chose
to abstain, bringing the total number of
voters to 417 out of the fiOl residents.

The Stern complex includes Bur
bank, Donner, Larkin, Serra, Twain
and Casa Zapata. Zapata is the Chi
cano / Latino theme house, whose in
habitants include some of the most
vocal anti-grape activists.
"We were probably the leaders to
vote against 112 serving grapes]," said Ser
gio Medina, a freshman in Zapata.
"We've been trying to educate other
dorms. Basically, all that we cared
about was that the vote was an educat
ed vote and everybody had a chance to
think about the issue."
Personally, Medina said, he is

pleased with the results of the vote. "It
just shows our support for the United
Farm Workers. It's an issue on the pes
ticides. That's the important thing."
The Stern vote is part of a series of
votes that will eventually take place at
all residences. Two miyor dining halls
have split on the vote so far, with
Manzanita voting to serve grapes
and Lagunita voting to boycott.
Stern's voter turnout proved
notable in contrast to the other
dorms in that considerably more
people participated. While 69 per
cent of Stern residents voted, just
57 percent of residents in Laguni
ta and 47 percent of residents in
Manzanita turned in their ballots.
The vote in Stern occurred fol
lowing the distribution of fliers,
as well as the presentation of sev
eral information panels that were

held on both the dorm-wide and
campus-wide levels.
Within the dorms, resident
assistants worked to promote
awareness. The RAs "presented
both sides," said Chee Chee Hsu, a
sophomore in Twain. "They were
very fair."
The "fairness" of RAs was not,
however, representative of indif
ference. "It's kind of a political
issue in our dorm," said Quinn
McKew, also a sophomore in
Twain. "A lot of RAs are very pas
sionate about this issue."
Among the RAs in Twain is
senior Elvira Prieto, one of the four
Stanford students who participat
ed in a May 1994 hunger strike in
part to protest Stanford's grape

policy. Prieto also was part a cam
pus-wide panel on Nov. 13, entitled
"Grapes in the '90s: Arguments
For and Against Serving Grapes at
Stanford."
After the 1994 hunger strike,
University President Gerhard
Casper formed a Grape Policy
Committee, which last year sug
gested that residences and admin
istrative units all vote individually
on a boycott. Casper rejected the
suggestion for administrative units
but permitted residences to vote.
The deadline for voting is Dec.
8. RAs are supposed to inform their
dining halls of the voting results by
Dec. 15.
Yet despite such organizational
efforts, some people believe that

students in Stern were not suffi
ciently receptive to the information
available to them and were there
fore not qualified to vote.
"The issue was well-publicized,
but people were not well
informed," said Ben Lipson, a
freshman in Larkin. "People could
have cared less. People voted most
ly on the basis of a gut feeling or
what their friends told them. They
took the politically correct route
that it's great to support a boy
cott."
Hsu agreed that the grape issue
is highly relevant only to a minori
ty of students.
"The vocal group doesn't want
Igrapesl served," said Hsu. "The
rest of us can live with or without."
