# Horpel's grapplers complete decade of dominance over Aggies
## 
### Karim Fahkry 
The Stanford wrestling team upheld
its 10-meet, decade-long winning streak
over UC-Davis by taking the Aggies
down in convincing fashion at Burnham
Pavilion last Friday evening in the
match-up which traditionally takes
place on the eve of Big Game.
Following the meet, the Cardinal
resounded with confidence. However,
the victory did not come as a surprise in
light of the Cardinal's dominance of the
series. Indeed, head coach Chris Hor
pel's grapplers fully expected to beat the
weaker, under-funded UC-Davis team.
Nevertheless, it was a pleasing, confi
dence-boosting win for all the wrestlers.
"I was very excited with the results of
the meet," said senior Matt Cano, who
won at 126 pounds. "We dominated
them and I'm very excited about the
rest of the season."

Performances of note included those
of redshirt freshman B.J. Sanchez (150
pounds) and freshman Frank Ruiz
(118). Sanchez, in his first match for the
Cardinal, faced the Aggies' best
wrestler. Nevertheless, he managed to
wrestle a strong match, coming from
behind to tie in the waning seconds of
regulation before losing in overtime.
"I was very impressed with B.J.'s
match," said Cardinal senior Sahlan
Martin, who was victorious at 167
pounds. "Even though he lost, he
showed a lot of toughness and spirit,
and he probably learned more from the
match than other people did in theirs."
Ruiz also had to battle back against a
tough opponent but still pulled out an
impressive win in his first dual meet at
Stanford.
Horpel gave most of his wrestlers a
break by moving them up one weight
class, allowing them to work down

toward their wrestling weight more
gradually.
As for needed improvement, most
members of the team agree that condi
tioning and health maintenance will
prove key. "Right now, we have a few
people with injuries, myself included,"
said junior Bryan Vaniman (190). "We
won't be able to reach optimal level
until everyone is healthy. Also, as can be
expected in the early part of the season,
we need to continue raising our level of
conditioning."
Martin also believes that strategy
improvement is necessary. "I think the
area that would benefit us most would
be strategy — knowing when to be
defensive and conservative versus
offensive and aggressive," he said.
"This is the area that I have improved
on most recently and that the rest of
the team could benefit from improving
as well."
