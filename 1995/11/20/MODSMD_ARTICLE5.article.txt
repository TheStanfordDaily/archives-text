# Advisory Board puts off recommendation on FRI
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
The fate of the Food Research Institute
remains in limbo after the Advisory Board
of the Academic Council, in a meeting Fri
day, postponed until Dec. 1 making a rec
ommendation on whether to close the insti
tute.
After hearing testimony from FRI Direc
tor Scott Pearson and Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences John Shoven, the
seven-memher hoard concluded it needed
more information and more time to render
a thoughtful decision.
"It's a very, very complicated business,"
said George Dekker, dean of graduate poli

cy and a hoard member. "It's not just a mat
ter of a closure or a merger. It's a question
of: If either were to be the decision, what
then? What to do about people who would
be affected?"
Both Pearson and Shoven made five
minute presentations to the board before
answering questions about the institute's
operations. Shoven and board members de
clined to comment on the session.
Pearson, met by a group of Food Re
search students as he left the meeting, said
he could not interpret the decision to post
pone the recommendation. "I didn't read
good news / bad news into it," Pearson said
as he left Building 170.
Last month, Shoven endorsed
a recommendation to transform
the 74-year-old institute into an
interdisciplinary research center
for faculty. If approved by Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
and the Board of Trustees, the
internationally renowned doctor
al program would be cut, and the
master's program would merge
into International Policy Studies.
Pearson said

m an interview
after the meet
ing that the
board asked
straightforward
questions about
the relationship
between the
institute and the
University.
"Thev asked

very fair and good questions to
inform themselves on what we
did," he said. "We certainly got
the impression that they had
carefully done their homework."
Provost Condoleezza Rice and
both sides of the debate prefer a
speedy decision and don't want to
delay the process beyond Dec. 1,
Dekker said. "Certainly that is
what the provost is hoping for,"
Dekker said. "I don't think really
that anybody . . . wants this to
drag on and on."
Shoven's recommendation to
close the institute has drawn
widespread criticism from stu
dents and faculty who claim the
loss would reduce Stanford's
international reputation and dis
courage top professors from
teaching at Stanford. Shoven
claims that the institute overlaps
with other departments and that
because a wave of faculty retire
ments is expected in the near
future, this is a prime time to
review the institute's role.
Although Shoven has said eco
nomic factors aren't a considera
tion, Pearson points out that the

institute generates a $1 million
surplus each year due to a large
endowment fund.
Before the meeting, a crowd of
about 100 rallied in White Plaza as
institute students concluded a 24-
hour fast. Students, institute fac
ulty and visiting faculty lauded the
institute for its significance in
international development and
criticized Shoven and his rationale
for the recommendation.
"Here you are trying to close it
on the grounds that it's below
Stanford's standards," said
Claude Brinegar, who in 1954 was
the second recipient of a doctorate
from the institute.
Assistant Food Research Prof.
Scott Rozelle told the crowd that
although he would be laid off if
Shoven's recommendation is
approved, he is optimistic that
"the collective wisdom of Stan
ford" will realize the institute
should be maintained.
The institute's international
appeal was evident at the rally.
Two undergraduate students
from South America and a Viet
namese master's candidate
praised the institute and said it
was a focal point for their attrac
tion to Stanford.
"Our choices are limited to
looking for quality institutions
where we can learn practical
[application] in one year," said
David Salazar, a Foreign Service
officer with the U.S. State Depart
ment who was present at the
rally. Salazar and two other offi
cials are enrolled in the master's
program at the institute.
"If the Food Research Institute
goes, it is unlikely the Depart
ment of State will send anyone
here," he said. "Other institutions
would offer better alternatives."
After the rally, the demonstra
tors moved behind Building 10,
awaiting the arrival of Shoven
and advisory board members with
banners, one of which said
"Shame, Shoven, Shame." Cheers
greeted institute leaders when
they departed Building 10 with
Rice for the meeting. Shoven,
however, entered the meeting
through another entrance.

Shoven's recommendation is
approved, he is optimistic that
"the collective wisdom of Stan
ford" will realize the institute
should be maintained.
The institute's international
appeal was evident at the rally.
Two undergraduate students
from South America and a Viet
namese master's candidate
praised the institute and said it
was a focal point for their attrac
tion to Stanford.
"Our choices are limited to
looking for quality institutions
where we can learn practical
[application] in one year," said
David Salazar, a Foreign Service
officer with the U.S. State Depart
ment who was present at the
rally. Salazar and two other offi
cials are enrolled in the master's
program at the institute.
"If the Food Research Institute
goes, it is unlikely the Depart
ment of State will send anyone
here," he said. "Other institutions
would offer better alternatives."
After the rally, the demonstra
tors moved behind Building 10,
awaiting the arrival of Shoven
and advisory board members with
banners, one of which said
"Shame, Shoven, Shame." Cheers
greeted institute leaders when
they departed Building 10 with
Rice for the meeting. Shoven,
however, entered the meeting
through another entrance.
