The fate of the Food Research Institute
remains in limbo after the Advisory Board
of the Academic Council, in a meeting Fri
day, postponed until Dec. 1 making a rec
ommendation on whether to close the insti
tute.
After hearing testimony from FRI Direc
tor Scott Pearson and Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences John Shoven, the
seven-memher hoard concluded it needed
more information and more time to render
a thoughtful decision.
"It's a very, very complicated business,"
said George Dekker, dean of graduate poli

cy and a hoard member. "It's not just a mat
ter of a closure or a merger. It's a question
of: If either were to be the decision, what
then? What to do about people who would
be affected?"
Both Pearson and Shoven made five
minute presentations to the board before
answering questions about the institute's
operations. Shoven and board members de
clined to comment on the session.
Pearson, met by a group of Food Re
search students as he left the meeting, said
he could not interpret the decision to post
pone the recommendation. "I didn't read
good news / bad news into it," Pearson said
