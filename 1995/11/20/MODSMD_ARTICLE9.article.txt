# Bosnia peace talks winding down

I )AY 1 ON, Ohio (AP) â€” Bosnia peace
talks moved toward a windup yesterday
with indications that spirited American
mediation would produce an agreement
to settle a 43-month war in which an
estimated quarter-million people have
perished.
As Secretary of State Warren
Christopher tried to resolve remaining
differences with Balkan leaders, U.S.
officials said at least four key issues had
been settled and were in a draft agree
ment being prepared for initialing at a
ceremony today.
"Clearly, we are approaching the
end," Nicholas Burns, the State Depart-

ment spokesman, said. Cautiously, he
told reporters "it could be an initialing
ceremony or it could be a press confer
ence that marks the end of these peace
talks without an agreement."
If there is an accord, President Clin
ton is pledged to contribute some 20,000
U.S. troops to help enforce it. The
House voted Friday to deny the admin
istration the funds for deployment.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said yes
terday"the President has done almost
nothing to explain to the American peo
ple why his Bosnia policy makes sense."
The agreement would set up two eth
nic republics in the former Yugoslav

republic, one controlled jointly by Mus
lims and Croats, the other by Serbs. The
central government would lie in charge
of foreign affairs and little else.
There would be a collective presiden
cy and the United States would help
arm and train the Bosnian army, U.S.
officials said.
A draft agreement provides also for a
separation of rival armies with a demili
tarized zone four kilometers wide and
for the Bosnian Serbs to retain control
of Srebrenica and Zepa, Muslim
enclaves they overran even though the
United Nations had designated the
zones to be safe havens.
