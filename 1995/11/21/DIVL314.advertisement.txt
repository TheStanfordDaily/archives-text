aircraft). And the costs? Only about 545 per person,
while no advance purchase or airline-style restrictions
apply-
Shakespeare and many other adventures in the
Western States can be reached in a couple of hours,
and at a surprisingly low cost when you get a pilot's
license. Most Members complete our Solo Pilot

Two-seat planes start at $39/ hr including fuel, and you
only pay for actual flight time. You can even take a
lesson while flying to Ashland, and at 10,000 ft view
Mount Shasta on the way.

information kit. Or try our $75 test flight. Ybu'll love it!
