# Campus assault reported

### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Police are looking for a suspect
in an incident of sexual battery
which occurred along Campus
Drive West Saturday evening.
While walking alone around
8:10 p.m., a 21-year-old female
Stanford student was grabbed
from behind. The suspect allegedly
put his arm around her neck and a
hand over her mouth, groping be
tween her legs, police said. He then
fled on foot, the woman told police.
The woman may not have heard
her male attacker approach be
cause she was listening to a per
sonal stereo, said Stanford Police
Sgt. John McMullen. The woman
said the same man had approached
her twice before, once asking for
the time and again to ask for direc
tions to the nearest bus stop.
There have been some sex
crimes on campus in the past few
months but nothing of this nature,
McMullen said. "It isn't common
for something like that to happen
on campus â€” where someone is
crabbed, and someone runs away,"
he said.
The woman described her
attacker as a Latino teenager or
young man, about 18 years old, 5
foot 9 inches tall, and weighing 200
pounds or more. He wore blue
jeans and a dark, long-sleeved
sweatshirt.
She said he had medium-length
dark hair with a ponytail and when
he first approached, he was wear
ing a backpack. He was not wear
ing a backpack during the assault,

however.
Running back to her residence,
the woman saw a large gray or sil
ver sedan, possibly a Cadillac, drive
toward her from the area of her
attack, pass her, and then head
toward the Stanford Golf Course.
Whether the car is connected with
the sexual battery is not clear,
police said, but they advise people
to be on the lookout for both the
suspect and the car.
"It is important for people to
keep their guard up and to be aware
of one's surroundings" McMullen
said. "I know people like to wear
headphones, but you really can't
hear what is going on around you."
