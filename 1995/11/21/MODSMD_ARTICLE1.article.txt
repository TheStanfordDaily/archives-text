Police are looking for a suspect
in an incident of sexual battery
which occurred along Campus
Drive West Saturday evening.
While walking alone around
8:10 p.m., a 21-year-old female
Stanford student was grabbed
from behind. The suspect allegedly
put his arm around her neck and a
hand over her mouth, groping be
tween her legs, police said. He then
fled on foot, the woman told police.
The woman may not have heard
her male attacker approach be
cause she was listening to a per
sonal stereo, said Stanford Police
Sgt. John McMullen. The woman
said the same man had approached
her twice before, once asking for
the time and again to ask for direc
tions to the nearest bus stop.
There have been some sex
crimes on campus in the past few
months but nothing of this nature,
McMullen said. "It isn't common
for something like that to happen
on campus â€” where someone is
crabbed, and someone runs away,"
