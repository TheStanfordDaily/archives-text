# Minority math program questioned
## 
### Jennifer Wang 
The Science Engineering and Mathematics
Achievement Program (SEMAP), established
to help level the field for undorropresented
minorities in math and engineering, is now
facing a number of administrative difficulties.
The program, which started in 1989,
selects freshmen and some upper-level stu
dents to attend an extra one-hour section led
by a doctoral student from the Math Depart
ment, along with regular introductory math
courses. SEMAP students are then awarded
an extra unit per quarter.
Incoming freshmen who have indicated
that they might major in engineering are
invited to apply for the program over the sum
mer, while sophomores and upper-division
students can apply to participate in the sec
tions after fall quarter.
Between 70 and 80 students are selected to
enroll each quarter, based on a number of aca
demic factors. SEMAP's private funding
from corporations such as GTE and Exxon, as
well as the National Science Foundation
mandates that about 80 percent of the pro
gram's students must be African American,
Native American or Chicano / Latino, accord
ing to graduate student Kevin Iga, a section
leader for the program.
"SEMAP is a positive program for people
who take part in it, and by and large, it does

work," Iga said.
Perhaps because it does work so well, some
non-minority students are vying for spots in
SEMAP classes as well.
Iga said he has received complaints from
quite a few rejected students who were not
classified as minorities that the program is
discriminatory. He said he agrees that of the
many selection factors, race is the biggest
issue of contention.
Freshman Akhil Sibal, who would not qual
ify for the program because he is not listed as
a prospective engineering student or an
underrepresented minority, said he does not
believe that the program is fair.
Students in the SEMAP program "have
opportunities that I don't, and I need those
opportunities," he said.
Sibal said he feels that Math 19 with
SEMAP would be the "perfect intermediary"
for many students caught between Math 19
and Math 41.
Assoc. Dean for Student Affairs Noe
Lozano said that the pool of potential appli
cants for the program is "not as large a group
as you might think," since many potential
engineering students come into Stanford at a
higher level than Math 19 and Math 41 with
AP credit.
Expanding efforts to attract students
would only generate too many applicants and
exacerbate administrative difficulties, Lozano

added.
The Physics Department adopted SEMAP
in 1990, Lozano said, but the program was cut
after two years because he "couldn't justify
the extra effort" if only about half the stu
dents were getting a B grade or better in the
class.
Freshman Justin Williams, an African
American currently taking SEMAP, main
tained that the program is not "just another
affirmative action program."
The program's funding is given by private
institutions who have the right to choose how
their money is spent, he added.
Lozano agreed, saying that SEMAP is a
very costly endeavor "limited in scope because
of outside support" and "when you're limited
by funding, you invite students with the great
est need."
Williams said he feels SEMAP is extremely
successful and that he would not be getting
such a high grade in calculus without it.
Hut he stressed that the program offers no
special treatment. "To me, special treatment
would be walking into class and getting an 'A'
automatically," Williams said. "We earn our
grades through hard work and diligent
effort."
Graduate student David Cardon, a section
leader, said he disagreed with the program on
principle.
