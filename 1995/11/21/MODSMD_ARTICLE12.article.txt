Budget debate continues
WASHINGTON (AP) — With the government
finally revving back to life, the White House and
Congress pledged yesterday to use December talks
to champion divergent spending priorities that
have so far been irreconcilable. The GOP also sig
naled a possible retreat on its prized tax cut.
Legislation sent to President Clinton for his sig
nature yesterday commits both sides to seeking a
balanced budget in seven years using congression
al economic calculations, which Republicans had
demanded for months, and to protect social pro
grams, as the White House insisted.
Before recessing for Thanksgiving, the House
also gave final congressional blessing to the GOP
plan for balancing the budget by '2002. Clinton has
promised to veto that bill.
The president had long said that the GOP's
seven-year budget-balancing timetable would

force overly harsh spending cuts, particularly in
light of the GOP's planned $245 billion tax break
for families and businesses.
"Well, I think that has to be on the table,"
acknowledged House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-
Ga., on NBC's "Today" program, signalling a new
willingnes to consider the White House's demands.
Dow Jones breaks 5,000
NEW YORK (AP) — The Dow Jones industrial

its record high of 5,000.43, though it ultimately
closed at 4,983.09, down 6.86.
