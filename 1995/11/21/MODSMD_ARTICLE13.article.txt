# Parts of Prop 187 struck down
## Judge rules that immigration is Washington's concern 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A fed
eral judge yesterday struck down
portions of voter-approved Propo
sition 187, saying elements of the
California law denying public ser
vices to undocumented immi
grants are unconstitutional.
U.S. District Judge Mariana
Pfaelzer ruled that undocument
ed immigrants can't be ques
tioned about their status when
applying to attend public schools
or receive government benefits.
She did not, however, strike
down provisions that deny higher
education benefits to undocu
mented students. And she said the
state may be able to deny access to
programs that it funds on its own.
The state can't, however, make

independent determinations of
immigration status.
"The state is powerless to enact
its own scheme to regulate immi
gration or to devise immigration
regulations which run parallel to
or purport to supplement the fed
eral immigration law," Pfaelzer
said in a 71-page written ruling.
Pfaelzer was responsing to a
motion filed by a group of organi
zations including the American
Civil Liberties Union.
The judge declared unconstitu
tional the requirement that teach
ers, health care workers and social
workers collect and report infor
mation about applicants' immi
gration status.
"The California voters' over

whelming approval of Proposition
187 reflects their justifiable frus
tration with the federal govern
ment's inability to enforce the
immigration laws effectively. No
matter how serious the problem
may be, however, the authority to
regulate immigration belongs
exclusively to the federal govern
ment and state agencies are not
permitted to assume that authori
ty," Pfaelzer wrote.
Pfaelzer's ruled that state and
school district employees cannot
be instructed to "determine"
whether immigrants are in the
country illegally. That job, she
wrote, belongs to the federal
Immigration and Naturalization
Service and cannot be usurped.
