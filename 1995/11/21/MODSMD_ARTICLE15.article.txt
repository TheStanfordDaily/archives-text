## Editorials Giving is not duty 
### 
Although we pay thou
sands of dollars for the right
to attend Stanford, the true
cost of that diploma is far higher.
Fortunately, Stanford is blessed
with other sources of income,
including a large endowment —
worth just over $3 billion — and
thousands of alumni (and others)
who donate generously each year.
Recently, it seems that the Uni
versity has started to devote more
and more resources to encourage
alumni, especially new ones, to
make giving a life-long habit. In
particular, Stanford has floated
the argument that giving is a
"moral obligation" which alumni
should obey.
This is worrisome. We are all for
alumni giving. Without the gen
erosity of past alumni and others,
this University would never have
been able to reach and maintain
the world-class status it now
enjoys.
However, expecting all alumni

to dutifully write checks to their
alma mater each year is unrea
sonable — and unfair. If someone
has a gripe about Stanford, he
should have the right to withhold
giving without worrying about
University President Gerhard
Casper chastising him for break
ing a moral obligation. Alumni
shouldn't be pressured to join an
artificial "moral elite" by mailing
in a check made out to "The Stan
ford Fund."
The University rightly realizes
it has a problem with low alumni
giving, but Stanford is working to
solve it in the wrong way — by try
ing to coerce alumni to give using a
false morality argument.
Instead of trying to legislate
ethics, Stanford should focus on
why disillusioned alumni are reluc
tant to give in the first place.
Instead of wasting time talking
about moral obligations, perhaps
administrators could ask alumni
what is troubling them.
