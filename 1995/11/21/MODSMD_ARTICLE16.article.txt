FROM THE PAWS of Berke
ley's bear painted on the
pavement to the word "Cal"
plastered on various campus build
ings, Big Game has once again left
its vandalous mark on Stanford.
This year, the results are mostly
spray-painted slogans. In years
past, some Berkeley students have
committed more serious acts, such
as painting Rodin sculptures or
pouring discoloring motor oil on
brickwork.
Let us be clear that not all Cal
students perpetrate these deeds.
Furthermore, Stanford students
have vandalized UC-Berkeley in Big
Game fervor too â€” although each
year there seems to be much more
property damage committed by Cal
students at Stanford than vice versa.
No matter who is committing
these crimes, however, they need
to stop. There is a difference
between a clever prank and
destructive graffiti. Both universi

ties' police forces are enforcing
vandalism and "tagging" laws,
which is good; such criminal acts
should be dealt with through the
criminal justice system.
But not all the vandals are
caught and punished, and the two
universities arc saddled with dam
age bills. To ensure that these pay
ments are fairly distributed and to
discourage students from vandal
izing their rival school, both Stan
ford and Berkeley should agree to
pay for the clean-up of vandalism
at the other school.
Saddling the schools with each
others' repair bills would create a
sense of collective responsibility and
hopefully reduce vandalism. It
would also be a gesture of friendship
between the universities. Finally, if
it is true that Berkeley students
cause more damage to Stanford
than vice versa, it is only fair that
Berkeley students should pay more,
even indirectlv, for that act.
