## Religion requires open mind 
### 
WHEN I WAS a freshman, the first
thing that struck me about Stan
ford was how religious people are.
The move from an agnostic Jewish back
ground to a world where most people
"love" God was a formidable mental leap. 1
had just assumed that no one would
believe in things that had never been
empirically proven and had never made
sense. Imagine my surprise during fresh
man year when a practicing Mormon
ended up as my roommate and a devout
Christian became my best friend.
More so than race, economic status or
sexuality, religion gets to the very root of
who you are. How you live, how you think
and how you see yourself in the larger
world are all founded on your religious
beliefs, or lack thereof.
This is one reason why religious differ
ences are so explosive and why religion is
rarely discussed or presented in an open
forum. For example, an attack on Chris
tianity is an attack of the moral base of
thousands of Stanford students. Challenge
Christianity and you challenge the founda
tion of everything a Christian has ever
known.
This leads to the other reason why reli
gion is such an untenable issue. Race and
sexuality can't be changed, but religion
can. African Americans don't have to fear
being "talked into" not being black. In con
trast, imagine a religious discussion
between a Christian and an atheist. Both

will try to convince the other that the other
is wrong. The atheist attempts to rescue
the Christian from a theological crutch,
while the Christian attempts to rescue the
atheist from an eternity in hell. The dis
cussion results only in anger and tension
999 times out of 1,000 — it doesn't rescue
anyone from anything.
Of course, this is not to say that religion
isn't discussed at all, because it is. Unfor
tunately, discussions on religion tend to be
among people who already agree. Chris
tians have discussions with other Chris
tians regarding the impropriety of non-
Christians. Atheists have discussions with
other atheists regarding the intellectual
inferiority of non-atheists.
When students at Stanford discuss reli
gion, they are only agreeing on how wrong
everyone else is.
Religious differences — because they
are strong, because they go to the core of
one's identity, because they are never
talked about — have polarized the Stan
ford community. It's not like racial polar
ization where you'll see eight African
Americans eating at the same table. Reli
gious polarization is invisible. You can't see
it, but it is there. Religious differences are
glass walls, unspoken barriers to closeness,
that, in trying to prevent us from seeing
the validity of other points of view, prevent
us from understanding and getting close to
different people.
One of my most memorable experiences

from freshman year was the day I attended
a Bible study. As one of Christianity's most
ardent critics, I felt compelled to see the
other side, for you can't fairly criticize
something you know nothing about. The
Bible study was truly enlightening. My
personal religious views did not change,
but for the first time, I understood why
Christians were Christians. I saw what
they got out of it, and I saw why they stuck
with it. Christianity was no longer this evil
empire of the dark side that lurked every
corner to convert me.
For incoming frosh, we need a "Reli
gions of the Community" program, a pre
sentation of perspectives from Christian,
Jewish, Muslim, agnostic, atheistic and
other religious viewpoints. The presenta
tion should not be a convert search or a
series of dogmatic monologues. It should
involve people from a variety of faiths
answering the simple question, "Why do I
feel this way?"
We need to deal with religious polariza
tion. The first step is talking openly about
our differences.
Even if you don't believe something,
you can at least try to understand why
some people do.

Mr. Small likes to keep an open mind about
all religions.
