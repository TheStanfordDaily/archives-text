Daily editorial lacked logic and respect

WE ARE WRITING this letter in
response to the editorial, "Access
priorities," printed in the Nov. 15
issue of The Daily. We believe the lan
guage and the underlying assumptions of
this article are ambiguous and prejudiced.
The editorial states that "Indue time,
measures should be undertaken to make
(the Firetruck House, Old Union and the
rest of Stanford] more accessible to dis
abled students." What exactly does "due
time" mean? It could mean tomorrow,
next week, five years from now or never.
Does it mean buildings will be made acces
sible when the administration deems it
convenient or when the disabled (not
handicapped) community has paid its
dues? Will the administration determine
when we deserve our basic civil right to
enter a building or access Stanford pro
grams? Or is this another patronizing
attempt to say, "Don't get agitated ... we
promised to take care of you and we will
â€” someday."
Due time does nothing for us but gen
erate more frustrations and disappoint
ments. The time for accessibility and fair
opportunity is now and not "in the near
future." We are here now and it is now
that our needs must be recognized and
accommodated. How long do we have to
wait?

Moreover, creating accessibility is not a
demonstration of Stanford's benevolence,
but compliance with federal law. Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
states the following:
"No otherwise qualified individual in
the United States ... shall, solely by rea
son of his handicap, be excluded from the
participation in, be denied the benefits of,
or be subjected to discrimination under
any program or activity receiving federal
financial assistance."
Is there anyone out there who wants to
lose millions of dollars of federal funding
out of Stanford's research and operational
budget?
The Daily's editorial board seems to
base its entire argument against physical
modifications and disability accommoda
tion in the context of a cost-benefit analy
sis. You state that the University should
proceed cautiously "lest it find itself in a
quagmire of financial costs." Webster's
New World Dictionary, Second Concise
Edition defines a quagmire as "a difficult
or dangerous situation from which it is
hard to escape." Ironically enough, the
definition of quagmire beautifully illus
trates exactly what it is like to be in a
wheelchair beholding a flight of stairs.
Quagmire similarly applies to being visu
ally impaired, moving about the campus

tripping over illegally parked bicycles and
running into barriers imposed by con
struction.
The disabled community acknowledges
that initial costs for building modifications
may be a sizable investment. But which
costs the University more, the investment
it will take to satisfy its responsibility
under the law or the negative image Stan
ford will acquire if it compromises the civil
rights of disabled students? Can Stanford
really afford to have a group of its stu
dents feeling alienated and isolated, believ
ing itself denied of an equal opportunity to
a Stanford education? It's ironic that The
Daily's lead story heralding Rev. Jesse
Jackson's speech on social justice ran on
the same day as this editorial.
The editorial's solution of "setfting] up
a priority list of buildings which are used
by both handicapped people and able-bod
ied people most frequently" is short-sight
ed. How would the University propose to
conduct a thorough analysis of how many
disabled students frequent a building that
is inaccessible to begin with? A priority
list of buildings used by disabled people
will only include buildings that are acces
sible. A better prescription would be to
assess the needs of the disabled communi
ty by finding out which buildings are least
accessible and create obstacles to partici

pation in academics and every-day stu
dent life. To understand and remedy the
problem, the only feasible unit of analysis
is the disabled student. Ultimately, hiding
behind the tired phrase, "budget cuts," is
a cop-out. How Stanford chooses to allo
cate its limited resources is still a direct
reflection of its values and the priority it
ostensibly places upon diversity.
Finally, we're not entirely sure what
the editorial board intended when it wrote
this editorial. In an era when our campus
is striving for cross-cultural communica
tion and understanding, the lack of
respect displayed for our issues, feelings
and rights seems counterintuitive. We are
not being overly sensitive. If the insensi
tive and short-sighted comments made in
this editorial had targeted women, ethnic
and religious minorities or gays and les
bians, this piece would have never appeared
in The Daily. However, because the article
is aimed at people with disabilities, you
appear to believe it is all right to express
prejudiced opinions and advocate discrimi
nation.
