# Hoover fellow used racist offensive language at rally
## 
### 
Last Tuesday, after Jesse Jackson's
speech in White Plaza, a group of
approximately 100-150 students
marched to the Hoover Institution to
demonstrate our support for affirma
tive action programs and our disap
proval of the UC Regents' decision —
specifically that of Dr. Glenn Campbell,
former director of Hoover.
We proceeded to have students
speak on affirmative action and its

importance. Dr. Thomas Metzger, a
senior fellow at Hoover, came out from
the building and began to verbally
harass us. The initial interaction went
something like this: "You are being
completely uncivilized. You're acting
like animals. You sound like barking
dogs."
We explained to him that it was our
legal right to be there as students and
we were exercising our freedom of
speech. As long as we were not block
ing the entrance to the building we
were doing nothing illegal.
He also questioned us several times
asking, "Are you Stanford students?

You don't look like it."
The second interaction I had with
this "esteemed" gentleman is the one I
find most disturbing. As we were dis
cussing the issues, Dr. Metzger looked
at me and said, "You are disgusting,
with that ring in your nose."
After he finished commenting on my
appearance, I explained to him the cul
tural significance of having a nose ring
in East Indian society. He proceeded to
say that there is no room for "tradition
al customs" in a modern society and
that people should "follow the norms"
of the society that they are in. He then
ran back into the building and locked all

the doors.
Needless to say, I am very offended
and appalled at this behavior. Dis
cussing issues and disagreeing on them
is fine and even healthy, but to insult
an individual on the basis of her
appearance is completely uncalled for.
We need to be aware and vigilant of
the so-called leaders the Hoover Insti
tution employs. It is a sad fact that
people like Metzger are in positions of
power. The prejudicial and ignorant
views they hold affect us and our
opportunities at Stanford.
