With Congress and the president battling over balancing the federal books, many people are bewildered at how the politics of the budget affect them .AVhile most non-essential federal government operations shut
down last week, the country continued its business as if nothing had happened. The mail ran. the stock market reached record territory, and the country did not collapse in default under a mountain ol debt ~
in I act, the federal government has been down this road several times since 1980 and there has never been any apparent long-term damage. So what's going on here? Is a little national debt a threat to the
economic security ol the I ,S.? Do we know and do we care? We asked Economics Prof. Michael Horvath to clarify the subject for our readers.

Honestly, the answer to the question
in the editor's introduction must be "no," we
just don't know if a little national debt is
detrimental to the country's economic health.
Economists and politicians differ substantially on the
definition of appropriate fiscal policy, making it diffi
cult to define what level of debt is more than a little
and how much is too much. We can identify the pros
and cons of carrying a national debt but these are typ
ically theoretical hypotheses about what may happen
in the long run. The plain fact is that we have too lit
tle data to test the theories conclusively.
The answer to the second question should be an
emphatic "yes" from all of you reading this under the
age of 30 (which includes me), or else I wouldn't
bother to write this piece. Newt Gingrich recently
commented on the budget wrangling in Congress:
This is the largest domestic decision since 1933. I
liiink for two generations we have borrowed our chil
dren's money. You should care about this question
because you are a child of Gingrich. It is your money
that he thinks is being borrowed to fund the govern
ment's excesses since 1973, the beginning of the cur
rent debt build-up. It is you who will most likely pay
in the long run if in two decades or so, the obvious
answer to the first question is yes, a little national
debt is a terrible thing (and how could we have been
so blind). So while I believe we do not know for sure
whether or not carrying a national debt is detrimen
tal to the health of the economy, it is a question for
which we would like to have an answer.
So that you may be able to debate the first ques
tion with economists and others, here are the main
arguments for and against carrying a national debt.
Michael Horvath ic an assistant professor of eco
nomies here at Stanford.

Remember, these are conjectures, not hard facts
about the benefits and detrimental effects of high
national deficits and debt levels. Economics may be
the dismal science. However, it is still a science and
that means we need to entertain all the hypotheses
and reject only those which we can disprove.
Benefits of Deficits:
• Investment in public goods: The government has
spent billions of dollars to build highways, bridges,
railways, buildings, parks and other public goods.

These are investments, much the
same way that businesses and home
owners invest in the infrastructure
and building stock of the economy.
However, the bookkeeping of the
government's investment projects
does not conform with the private
sector. If the government appropri
ates $200 billion to help fund the
reconstruction of the highways
around San Francisco, the total
amount is considered spent in the

year in which it is appropriated. The new highways
are not counted as assets now in place in the stock of
government capital and hence do not offset the
spending. If the government is going to continue to
invest in public goods, some deficit spending may be
preferable.
• Analogy to corporations: Most large corporations
carry a significant amount of debt. They issue bonds
which, in most cases, obligate them to pay an amount
caiied a coupon yearly or monthly to the bondholder
and then to pay the face value of the bond when it
matures (typically several years from the date of
issue). The bond market is considered an efficient
means for companies and governments to raise capital
that they can use for investment projects, research and

development. Why should we as citizens be alarmed if
the government carries a debt, given that we do not
raise an eyebrow if Microsoft or IBM do the same?
• Redistribution: As a matter of principle, the gov
ernment's role is to ensure the equality of opportu
nity for all citizens of the United States. Some people
feel this extends to economic equality in outcome.
Allowing the government to run deficits, and hence
to carry, potentially, a level of debt, makes possible
the redistribution programs currently in place such
as Medicaid and Welfare relief.
• Comparison to other countries: By international stan
dards, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio is not all that high.
Belgium and Italy have been over the 100 percent debt
to-GDP ratio for several decades now and they are still
functioning economies (notice I did not say efficient).
Perhaps a debt-to-GDP ratio of 80 percent as is the case
in the U.S. is a "small" amount of debt after all.
Costs of Deficits:
• "Crowding out" of private investment: The term
"crowding out," in this context, refers to the substi
tution of corporate bonds with government bonds. If
the government wants to borrow more and more
money, the private sector may get less and less of the
amount people are interested in investing, raising
rates in the future as people demand higher rates to
hold government bonds.
• Transferring the burden to future generations:
Repeating the first point in the "pros" section above,
the government's primary concern is the equality of
all of its constituents. This extends to those yet to be
born, according to many opponents of the govern
ment debt. By spending more than the government
receives now, the government is merely transferring
the tax burden to future generations, which may
include us, and this is not fair. This could lead to:
• Weaker dollar and reduced autonomy: Since a signif

icant amount of current government debt issuances is
being bought by foreigners, higher levels of debt may
also lead to a weaker dollar in foreign exchange mar
kets. Notioe that the dollar has been weakening with
respect to the yen for the past decade (and then some)
at the same time that Japanese investors have become
participants in the U.S. treasury bill and gov
ernment bond auctions. A weaker dollar may be good
for the relatively small portion of the economy that is
involved with exports. However, it is not necessarily
good for the economy as a whole.
I could go on with both lists. This I will not do.
The gentle reader will kindly note that I have tried to
be fair as fair can be in presenting arguments on
both sides of the debate. My own opinion is that the
most detrimental aspect of running a government
debt is that it leads to political stalemates.
The current level of national debt has generated a
profound unwillingness to see the forest for the trees
on the part of both Democrats and Republicans, pres
idents and Congress. Surely the hundreds of thou
sands of government employees deemed "non-essen
tial" and the resort operators around the national
parks, to name but few sufferers, have borne the
most immediate cost of the national debt. Tc those
who argue that the six-day shut-down of the U.S.
government is a one-time event, unfortunate but nec
essary to generate a budget deal, I would remind
them that long-run budget deals were approved by
the White House and Congress in 1991 and 1993,
only to fail under application. Future government
shut-downs may become a yearly phenomenon unless
the two sides of the debate can come to a more fun
damental understanding on what aspects of the debt
are truly detrimental to the economy and what can be
tolerated for the sake of achieving some of the bene
fits outlined above.
