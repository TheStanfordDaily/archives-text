## Cross country teams race to top 10 at NCAAs Men improve to fifth place while women pull away for ninth 
### Ed Guzman Contributing writer 
At last year's NCAA Cross
Country Championships, the
Stanford cross country program
asserted itself as a national force.
Yesterday, the Cardinal proved
that last year was no fluke.
The Cardinal men and women,
riding the performances of junior
Greg Jimmerson and freshman
Mary Cobb, once again blazed to
top-10 finishes in the NCAA
Cross Country Championships in
Ames, lowa, finishing fifth and
ninth, respectively. The men
improved on last season's sixth
place performance while the
women could not keep pace with
last season's eighth-place outing.
By running in a tight, cohesive
pack that crossed the finish line
only one minute and 12 seconds
apart, the fifth-ranked Cardinal
men broke away from most of the
177-runner field. Fourth-ranked
Arkansas won the national crown
easily with 100 points, outdis
tancing second-place Northern
Arizona by 42 points. Godfrey
Siamuslye and Ryan Wilson led
the Razorbacks with first- and
fifth-place finishes, respectively.

Siamuslye completed the course
in 30 minutes, nine seconds.
Jimmerson spearheaded Stan
ford in the 10,000 meter race with
a time of 31:25, good for 23rd over
all. Sophomore Nathan Nutter fol
lowed in 42nd with a time of 31:52.
Senior Mark Fadil, competing in
his final race as a Cardinal, ran the
course in 32:22 for 66th place.
Junior J.J. White and freshman
Brent Hauser rounded out Stan
ford's top five harriers, capturing
70th and 84th, respectively. White
clocked in at 32:24 while Hauser
crossed the line in 32:37. Stan
ford's 209 points placed it ahead of
all other Pacific 10 Conference
participants in the 22-team meet.
The women's 5,000 meter race
saw the end of Villanova's reign of
terror, as top-ranked Providence
broke 'Nova's six-year strangle
hold on the cross country title. The
lady Friars finished on top with 88
points. Marie McMahon led the
way with her fourth-place finish in
the 183-harrier meet. Wisconsin's
Kathy Butler captured the individ
ual title, finishing the course in
16:51, edging Arizona's Amy
Skieresz bv four seconds.

The Stanford men's cross country team's season came to a close yesterday at the NCAAs in Ames, lowa. The Cardinal men raced to fifth
place out of a field of 22 schools.
The eighth-ranked Cardinal,
meanwhile, tallied 235 points to
finish third among Pac-10
teams. Oregon and Arizona took
fifth and sixth, respectively.
Freshman Mary Cobb provided
Stanford with its highlight of
the day. Cobb capped off a
remarkable freshman season by
earning All-American honors as
she cruised to a fifth-place fin
ish, crossing the line in 17:18.
Sophomore Sarna Renfro fol
lowed next for the Cardinal
with a time of 18:03, placing her
at 36th.
Junior Monal Chokshi Fin
ished the race in 18:07, good for
46th. Sophomore Sara Moore
and junior Ann Sheehy ran
times of 18:25 and 18:34 while
taking 83rd and 109 th, respec
tively. Meanwhile, sophomore
Kortney Dunscombe, in her
first race back from a back
injury, placed 136 th, clocking in
at 18:54.
As if their top-10 perfor
mances weren't enough, the
future looks bright for the Car
dinal men and women. Six of
the seven male runners that ran
yesterday's competition will
return, while the women will
lose no one. The experience
gained in Ames can only be ben
eficial to next year's squads as
both continue their quest for
the national crown.
