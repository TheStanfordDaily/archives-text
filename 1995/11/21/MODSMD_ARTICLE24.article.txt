### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
The No. 3 Stanford women's
volleyball team will say good-bye
to one of its most talented senior
classes ever when it takes on the
University of San Francisco at
Maples Pavilion this evening at 7
p.m. on senior night.
The Cardinal (25-2 overall, 18-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) enters its
final 1995 home match having
won 22 straight matches on its
way to completing Stanford's first
undefeated trip through the Pac
-10 since 1991.
"It's nice [to go undefeated],"
said head coach Don Shaw. "With
the conference being so tough this
year and with everybody beating
up on everybody else, it was nice
to stay above all that this year."
In addition to establishing
itself as one of the best teams in
the nation, Stanford's success in
conference play gives the team
added confidence as it prepares to
defend its national title in the
NCAA tournament, which will
start Nov. 29.
"It's really a good thing to
know that you can handle such
tough competition," Shaw said.
"Our team is playing really well
right now."
Stanford expects to dispose of
the Dons easily this evening. The
Dons are struggling in a rebuild
ing season and figure to be little
more than helpless targets for
Stanford's potent offensive
attack. In their 14 matchups to
date, the Cardinal has never lost
to USF.

"They're not having a good
season," Shaw said. "They've lost
a lot of players and are a young
team with a second-year coach.
They recruited a couple of good
players last year who are improv
ing, but right now, it's not like
we'll be playing a highly-ranked
team, which is good for senior
night."
Indeed, tonight will be more
of a celebration of four spectacu
lar Stanford seniors than a bat
tle between two top teams. This
year's senior class is led by one
of the best players ever to play
volleyball for the Cardinal, set

dell. Wendell began her career
at Stanford in 1992, when she
earned Volleyball Monthly's
National Freshman of the Year
award. Wendell hit .285 as a
freshman (second on the team
to Olympian Bev Oden) and reg
istered 353 kills. She was the
only freshman named to the All-
Pac-10 team in 1992. Wendell
also garnered NCAA All-Tour
nament honors in 1992 by help
ing Stanford capture the nation
al championship.
After spending the summer at
the Goodwill Games with the U.S.
National Team, Wendell posted
an outstanding sophomore season
with the Cardinal. The First-
Team All-Pac-10 and First-Team
All-West Region performer led
Stanford in hitting percentage
(.278) and ranked second in digs,
kills, blocks and assists. The Sec
