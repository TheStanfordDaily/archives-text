# Spikers say good-bye to seniors, host USF
## 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
The No. 3 Stanford women's
volleyball team will say good-bye
to one of its most talented senior
classes ever when it takes on the
University of San Francisco at
Maples Pavilion this evening at 7
p.m. on senior night.
The Cardinal (25-2 overall, 18-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) enters its
final 1995 home match having
won 22 straight matches on its
way to completing Stanford's first
undefeated trip through the Pac
-10 since 1991.
"It's nice [to go undefeated],"
said head coach Don Shaw. "With
the conference being so tough this
year and with everybody beating
up on everybody else, it was nice
to stay above all that this year."
In addition to establishing
itself as one of the best teams in
the nation, Stanford's success in
conference play gives the team
added confidence as it prepares to
defend its national title in the
NCAA tournament, which will
start Nov. 29.
"It's really a good thing to
know that you can handle such
tough competition," Shaw said.
"Our team is playing really well
right now."
Stanford expects to dispose of
the Dons easily this evening. The
Dons are struggling in a rebuild
ing season and figure to be little
more than helpless targets for
Stanford's potent offensive
attack. In their 14 matchups to
date, the Cardinal has never lost
to USF.

"They're not having a good
season," Shaw said. "They've lost
a lot of players and are a young
team with a second-year coach.
They recruited a couple of good
players last year who are improv
ing, but right now, it's not like
we'll be playing a highly-ranked
team, which is good for senior
night."
Indeed, tonight will be more
of a celebration of four spectacu
lar Stanford seniors than a bat
tle between two top teams. This
year's senior class is led by one
of the best players ever to play
volleyball for the Cardinal, set
ter / outside hitter Cary Wen
dell. Wendell began her career
at Stanford in 1992, when she
earned Volleyball Monthly's
National Freshman of the Year
award. Wendell hit .285 as a
freshman (second on the team
to Olympian Bev Oden) and reg
istered 353 kills. She was the
only freshman named to the All-
Pac-10 team in 1992. Wendell
also garnered NCAA All-Tour
nament honors in 1992 by help
ing Stanford capture the nation
al championship.
After spending the summer at
the Goodwill Games with the U.S.
National Team, Wendell posted
an outstanding sophomore season
with the Cardinal. The First-
Team All-Pac-10 and First-Team
All-West Region performer led
Stanford in hitting percentage
(.278) and ranked second in digs,
kills, blocks and assists. The Sec
ond-Team All-American also
recorded 13 triple-doubles that year
and only came out of a match twice
all season.
It was during her junior year
that Wendell finally established
herself as the nation's best colle
giate player. On her way to becom
ing Volleyball Magazine's National
Player of the Year, Wendell led the
team in assists and digs while hit
ting an amazing .335. An All-Pac
-10 selection for the third year in a
row, Wendell helped the Cardinal
to another national crown.
This season, Wendell picked up
where she left off last year and is a
leading candidate for player-of-the
year honors. She boasts nine triple

doubles (no other player in NCAA
Division I has more than two) and
leads the team in assists.
Outside hitter Marnie Triefen
bach will also bo playing in her final
regular-season home match. Last
season, Triefenbach obtained Sec
ond-Teain All-American status. An
All-Pac-10 choice for the second
consecutive year, she hit .253, led
the team in kills and digs and
ranked second among Cardinal
players in aces. She notched 18
double-doubles (kills and digs) in
1994. As has been her trademark
throughout her Stanford career,
Triefenbach saved her best perfor
mances for the toughest competi
tion, recording a phenomenal 28
kills and 23 digs against UCI.A in
November.
This season, Triefenbach suc
cuml)ed to injuries early in the year

and lost her starting spot to fellow
senior outside hitter Wendy Hro
madka. Nevertheless, on more than
one occasion, Triefenbach has come
in when one of her teammates has
struggled to spark the team to vic
tory, most notably in Stanford's
home win against the Bruins in
October. Always a crowd favorite,
Triefenbach's thunderous kills
inspire her teammates and fire up
the Maples Pavilion audience.
Hromadka earned her spot in
this year's starting lineup by
putting together an outstanding
spring practice season. In her
junior year, Hromadka came off the
bench to hit .250 for 48 kills to go
along with 56 digs. A starter for the
first half of 1993, she was third on
the team in kills, fourth in digs and
sixth in aces.
Hromadka garnered a spot on

the All-Pac-10 freshman team in
1992 after registering 86 kills and
87 digs in 23 matches. She saw
action in 21 of the last 22 matches
that year, and it was her kill at
match point in the NCAA title
match that gave Stanford the 1992
national championship.
Maureen McClaren rounds out
this year's senior class. McClaren
serves ;ls a reserve hitter and emer
gency setter this year, playing
impressively early in the season
when injuries sidelined Wendell
and Triefenbach. She competed in
18 matches last year, amassing 48
kills and 41 digs. In 1993, McClaren
started the first 15 matches at mid
dle blocker and started the last 10
at outside hitter. She hit .260 that
year (second-best on the team) to
tally 112 kills to complement her
139 digs and 47 blocks.

18 matches last year, amassing 48
kills and 41 digs. In 1993, McClaren
started the first 15 matches at mid
dle blocker and started the last 10
at outside hitter. She hit .260 that
year (second-best on the team) to
tally 112 kills to complement her
139 digs and 47 blocks.
The No. 3 Stanford women's
volleyball team will say good-bye
to one of its most talented senior
classes ever when it takes on the
University of San Francisco at
Maples Pavilion this evening at 7
p.m. on senior night.
The Cardinal (25-2 overall, 18-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) enters its
final 1995 home match having
won 22 straight matches on its
way to completing Stanford's first
undefeated trip through the Pac
-10 since 1991.
"It's nice [to go undefeated],"
said head coach Don Shaw. "With
the conference being so tough this
year and with everybody beating
up on everybody else, it was nice
to stay above all that this year."
In addition to establishing
itself as one of the best teams in
the nation, Stanford's success in
conference play gives the team
added confidence as it prepares to
defend its national title in the
NCAA tournament, which will
start Nov. 29.
"It's really a good thing to
know that you can handle such
tough competition," Shaw said.
"Our team is playing really well
right now."
Stanford expects to dispose of
the Dons easily this evening. The
Dons are struggling in a rebuild
ing season and figure to be little
more than helpless targets for
Stanford's potent offensive
attack. In their 14 matchups to
date, the Cardinal has never lost
to USF.

"They're not having a good
season," Shaw said. "They've lost
a lot of players and are a young
team with a second-year coach.
They recruited a couple of good
players last year who are improv
ing, but right now, it's not like
we'll be playing a highly-ranked
team, which is good for senior
night."
Indeed, tonight will be more
of a celebration of four spectacu
lar Stanford seniors than a bat
tle between two top teams. This
year's senior class is led by one
of the best players ever to play
volleyball for the Cardinal, set
ter / outside hitter Cary Wen
dell. Wendell began her career
at Stanford in 1992, when she
earned Volleyball Monthly's
National Freshman of the Year
award. Wendell hit .285 as a
freshman (second on the team
to Olympian Bev Oden) and reg
istered 353 kills. She was the
only freshman named to the All-
Pac-10 team in 1992. Wendell
also garnered NCAA All-Tour
nament honors in 1992 by help
ing Stanford capture the nation
al championship.
After spending the summer at
the Goodwill Games with the U.S.
National Team, Wendell posted
an outstanding sophomore season
with the Cardinal. The First-
Team All-Pac-10 and First-Team
All-West Region performer led
Stanford in hitting percentage
(.278) and ranked second in digs,
kills, blocks and assists. The Sec
ond-Team All-American also
recorded 13 triple-doubles that year
and only came out of a match twice
all season.
It was during her junior year
that Wendell finally established
herself as the nation's best colle
giate player. On her way to becom
ing Volleyball Magazine's National
Player of the Year, Wendell led the
team in assists and digs while hit
ting an amazing .335. An All-Pac
-10 selection for the third year in a
row, Wendell helped the Cardinal
to another national crown.
This season, Wendell picked up
where she left off last year and is a
leading candidate for player-of-the
year honors. She boasts nine triple

doubles (no other player in NCAA
Division I has more than two) and
leads the team in assists.
Outside hitter Marnie Triefen
bach will also bo playing in her final
regular-season home match. Last
season, Triefenbach obtained Sec
ond-Teain All-American status. An
All-Pac-10 choice for the second
consecutive year, she hit .253, led
the team in kills and digs and
ranked second among Cardinal
players in aces. She notched 18
double-doubles (kills and digs) in
1994. As has been her trademark
throughout her Stanford career,
Triefenbach saved her best perfor
mances for the toughest competi
tion, recording a phenomenal 28
kills and 23 digs against UCI.A in
November.
This season, Triefenbach suc
cuml)ed to injuries early in the year

and lost her starting spot to fellow
senior outside hitter Wendy Hro
madka. Nevertheless, on more than
one occasion, Triefenbach has come
in when one of her teammates has
struggled to spark the team to vic
tory, most notably in Stanford's
home win against the Bruins in
October. Always a crowd favorite,
Triefenbach's thunderous kills
inspire her teammates and fire up
the Maples Pavilion audience.
Hromadka earned her spot in
this year's starting lineup by
putting together an outstanding
spring practice season. In her
junior year, Hromadka came off the
bench to hit .250 for 48 kills to go
along with 56 digs. A starter for the
first half of 1993, she was third on
the team in kills, fourth in digs and
sixth in aces.
Hromadka garnered a spot on

the All-Pac-10 freshman team in
1992 after registering 86 kills and
87 digs in 23 matches. She saw
action in 21 of the last 22 matches
that year, and it was her kill at
match point in the NCAA title
match that gave Stanford the 1992
national championship.
Maureen McClaren rounds out
this year's senior class. McClaren
serves ;ls a reserve hitter and emer
gency setter this year, playing
impressively early in the season
when injuries sidelined Wendell
and Triefenbach. She competed in
18 matches last year, amassing 48
kills and 41 digs. In 1993, McClaren
started the first 15 matches at mid
dle blocker and started the last 10
at outside hitter. She hit .260 that
year (second-best on the team) to
tally 112 kills to complement her
