# Crew teams perform soundly at San Mateo
## 
### Laura Drum Contributing writer 
Lust Sunday, the Stanford men's
and women's crew teams met Cali
fornia and other West Coast schools
in San Mateo, the Cardinal's home
turf. The regatta concluded the fall
season and seemed as important to
Stanford crew as Big Game seemed
to football.
The Cardinal performed with
rhythm and grace. All three
women's teams finished first in
their divisions while the men's
team placed a close second behind
national powerhouse Cal.
The course snaked through resi
dential San Mateo, its sharp curves
and narrow bridges challenging all
comers. It spanned 6,000 meters,
longer than most crew races. The
distance pushed the Cardinal's
endurance, which began to lag due
to an especially hard week of prac
tice.
Fatigue could not stop the Stan
ford women from their goal, howev
er. The varsity team finished 23
seconds ahead of Cal with a time of
20 minutes, 14 seconds. Mean
while, the junior varsity squad
came in three minutes ahead of the
Bears with a time of 21:31. The
novice team crossed the finish line
30 seconr' before Cal.

Afler a disorganized start per
mitted the Bears to start ahead of
schedule, Stanford set the pace.
"We set up a rhythm early in the
race," said senior Cara Rice. "Our
strategy was to go out fast and hold
on, and we did that."
The varsity squad improved by
30 seconds compared to its perfor
mance in the same regatta last year
while the junior varsity team sped
up by two minutes. "We pulled
hard," said senior JV rower Leah
Meagher. "We pulled together. I
think we're going to be a strong
team this year."
Stanford's men's team finished
with a time of 17:30 compared to
Cal's mark of 17:06. The Cardinal
led afler the initial 2,000 meters.
Then the pace slowed, however, and
the Bears crept up from behind.
"We had our high points and our
low points," said senior Barrett
Adams. "The rate dropped [at the
endl and it was hard to pick up the
energy level again."
Stanford still finished 45 sec
onds faster than last year's time,
however, and can take comfort in
the fact that it lost to a Cal squad
which set a new course record for
the race. "I was extremely proud of
[the team]," said men's coxswain
Eva Kim. "We went out with a lot
of fire."
