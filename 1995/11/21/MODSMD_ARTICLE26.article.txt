# Great talent finishes career on Farm
## Senior Fischer reflects on her time as one of collegiate soccer's best sweepers

Jessica Fischer hasn't always
been one of the top women's soc
cer players in the world.
Fifteen years ago, she was
just a little girl growing up in the
lazy suburban sunshine of Mira
Mesa, Calif., unaware she was
fated to become one of the
biggest stars in the sport of
women's soccer. That's when
Fischer, at age six, first decided
she was going to be a soccer play
er, a passion that has enveloped
her life ever since. And that's
when she first made her mom
watch as she ran around the
neighborhood cul-de-sac to
prove how fast she could run.
"She finally signed me up
when I was six, and I started play
ing then," Fischer said. "I always
dreamed about being the best
women's player in the world."
That's a distinction Fischer
has come close to achieving in
four phenomenal years as Stan
ford's starting sweeper. Since
arriving on the Farm in 1992,
Fischer has started every match,
setting new Stanford career
bests for games played and
games started. In her four years
here, the Cardinal has also made
four consecutive NCAA tourna
ment appearances, including a
trip to the Final Four in '93.
"Jessica is the top sweeper in
the country and one of the most
talented women in the world
today," said head coach lan
Sawyers of Fischer — after her
sophomore year.
That was the year Stanford
marched all the way to the
national semifinals in Chapel
Hill, N.C., where the Cardinal
battled George Mason for two
and-a-half hours before the Patri
ots prevailed 3-1 on penalty kicks.
But Fischer points to her fresh
man year as the highlight of her

Stanford career. That was the
year she converted a crucial penal
ty kick in a 5-2 come-from-behind
victory over Portland in the first
round of NCAA playoffs. "That
was such a great feeling as a fresh
man, to know that I had the confi
dence to put it away," she said.
Before she was a fresh-faced
17-year-old starting for the Car
dinal in her first year on the

phenomenal leader
in this program since
she stepped onto
the Stanford campus.'

Farm, Fischer was a two-sport
standout at Mira Mesa High,
where she also participated in
track. As an Ail-American and a
member of the 19-and-under
national team, Fischer received
recruiting attention from
around the country, but she had
already narrowed her choices to
Stanford, Santa Clara and Port
land — the three biggest soccer
powerhouses in the West.
"I only showed interest in
three [schools], but I knew that
Stanford was where I wanted to
go," she said.
Fischer immediately took on a
starting role for the Cardinal, but
she wasn't always comfortable in
a leadership position. "Freshman
year, my position demanded that
I be demanding of other people,"
she said. "I had to do things that
I probably didn't want to, which
was to yell at people and tell them
to do stuff, and at first it was
pretty awkward."
