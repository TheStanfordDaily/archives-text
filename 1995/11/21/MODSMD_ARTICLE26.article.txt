# Great talent finishes career on Farm
## Senior Fischer reflects on her time as one of collegiate soccer's best sweepers 
### Bobby Cuza Contributing writer 
Jessica Fischer hasn't always
been one of the top women's soc
cer players in the world.
Fifteen years ago, she was
just a little girl growing up in the
lazy suburban sunshine of Mira
Mesa, Calif., unaware she was
fated to become one of the
biggest stars in the sport of
women's soccer. That's when
Fischer, at age six, first decided
she was going to be a soccer play
er, a passion that has enveloped
her life ever since. And that's
when she first made her mom
watch as she ran around the
neighborhood cul-de-sac to
prove how fast she could run.
"She finally signed me up
when I was six, and I started play
ing then," Fischer said. "I always
dreamed about being the best
women's player in the world."
That's a distinction Fischer
has come close to achieving in
four phenomenal years as Stan
ford's starting sweeper. Since
arriving on the Farm in 1992,
Fischer has started every match,
setting new Stanford career
bests for games played and
games started. In her four years
here, the Cardinal has also made
four consecutive NCAA tourna
ment appearances, including a
trip to the Final Four in '93.
"Jessica is the top sweeper in
the country and one of the most
talented women in the world
today," said head coach lan
Sawyers of Fischer — after her
sophomore year.
That was the year Stanford
marched all the way to the
national semifinals in Chapel
Hill, N.C., where the Cardinal
battled George Mason for two
and-a-half hours before the Patri
ots prevailed 3-1 on penalty kicks.
But Fischer points to her fresh
man year as the highlight of her

Stanford career. That was the
year she converted a crucial penal
ty kick in a 5-2 come-from-behind
victory over Portland in the first
round of NCAA playoffs. "That
was such a great feeling as a fresh
man, to know that I had the confi
dence to put it away," she said.
Before she was a fresh-faced
17-year-old starting for the Car
dinal in her first year on the

'Jessica has been a
phenomenal leader
in this program since
she stepped onto
the Stanford campus.'

Farm, Fischer was a two-sport
standout at Mira Mesa High,
where she also participated in
track. As an Ail-American and a
member of the 19-and-under
national team, Fischer received
recruiting attention from
around the country, but she had
already narrowed her choices to
Stanford, Santa Clara and Port
land — the three biggest soccer
powerhouses in the West.
"I only showed interest in
three [schools], but I knew that
Stanford was where I wanted to
go," she said.
Fischer immediately took on a
starting role for the Cardinal, but
she wasn't always comfortable in
a leadership position. "Freshman
year, my position demanded that
I be demanding of other people,"
she said. "I had to do things that
I probably didn't want to, which
was to yell at people and tell them
to do stuff, and at first it was
pretty awkward."

One of the nation's top sweepers in women's soccer, senior Jes
sica Fischer now sets her sight on loftier goals.
That awkwardness soon wore
off, as Fischer went on to estab
lish herself as one of the premier
collegiate players in the nation in
her rookie year.
"Jessica has simply been a
phenomenal leader in this pro
gram since she stepped onto the
Stanford campus," Sawyers said.
"Having been to the past two
Women's World Cups, she is tac
tically the best sweeper I've seen.
Jessica has been the Michael Jor
dan of our squad — everyone
knows she is the most skilled
player on the team, but they also
know she spends the most time
working on improving her
game."
Fischer is quick to stray balls
and prides herself on her pin
point accuracy as a distributor, a
skill she developed as a child
while trying to float balls into
trash cans. But perhaps more
importantly, Fischer brings con
fidence and stability to a Stan
ford defense that consistently
remained one of the nation's best
during her tenure. "If you don't
act scared, everybody else won't
act scared," she said.
The 1995 season was sup
posed to be Fischer's year — the
year the senior sweeper would
finally lead the Cardinal to the
promised land. And things cer
tainly looked promising after
Stanford finished 7-0 in confer

ence play, winning the Pacific 10
Conference title and rounding
out the season with a nine-game
winning streak. But the Cardinal
drew seventh-ranked Santa
Clara in the first round of the
NCAA playoffs — a controversial
situation considering the Bron
cos and the Cardinal were the
only top-10 squads in the 24-
team field that did not receive
first-round byes. Stanford lost 3-
2 in a heartbreaking sudden
death overtime.
"I hate losing to them, of
course," Fischer said. "They're a
great team and I have a lot of
great friends on that team, which
makes it so much more fun and a
lot easier to be mad at them. It's
a good anger and it's a good frus
tration because I love those guys,
too. But it's frustrating."
With her Stanford soccer
career now behind her, Fischer
will soon turn her attention to
international play. Last spring,
Fischer took time off from school
to attend the U.S. National
Team training camp in Sanford,
Fla., but did not earn a spot on
the team that went to the World
Championship.
U.S. coach Tom DiCicco said
the fact that Fischer is a sweeper
is probably what kept her off the
team — Carla Overbeck has
started as sweeper for the U.S.
the past six years. But DiCicco
didn't hesitate to invite Fischer
to the national team training
camp in San Diego next month.
Fischer has already told DiCi
cco that she won't be attending

the week-long December camp —
she doesn't want to miss any
more school. But DiCicco is still
taking Fischer into considera
tion. Fischer hopes to find out by
mid-December whether or not
she's made the squad.
"He has his core group, but
there's a few players that he still
has to decide about, and I'm one
of those players," Fischer said.
"Whatever happens will be okay
— but I would love to go back."
If Fischer, a human biology
major and an aspiring physician,
does make the national team
that will represent the U.S. in
the Olympics, she will take win
ter and spring quarters off and
finish school the following
spring. Otherwise, she will finish
in the fall.
A two-time Ail-American in
college, Fischer is also awaiting
word on the Hermann Trophy,
awarded to the top collegiate
player in the nation, and the Mis
souri Athletic Club's Collegiate
Player of the Year award, for
which Fischer was a finalist last
season. But don't ask Fischer
about the honors.
"Most of the time I don't even
know what (those awards] are,"
she said. "I think as a kid, you
pay more attention. I could tell
you when I was 15 who won what
award and what exactly it meant.
Then when it's you, it's just like,
'What is that?' "
That, Jessica, is probably just
another trophy for your mantle
— that is, if there's any room left
by now.
