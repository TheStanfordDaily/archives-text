# Cardinal ready to do some Gator wrestling
## 
### Karim Fahkry 
Coming off their ferocious victory against
Bay Area rival UC-Davis last Friday, the Stan
ford wrestlers are set to face off against San
Francisco State at Burnham Pavilion tonight
at 7 p.m.
The grapplers regard tonight's contest as
their own version of Big Game. There is a lot
of pride riding on this meet, since the Gators
defeated the Cardinal 19-16 last year for the
first time in a decade. San Francisco State
pulled out the victory in the heavyweight
matchup, which is the final confrontation in a
dual meet.
San Francisco State featured three All-
Americans last year and finished second
nationally in Division 11. This year, the Gators
rely on a powerful arsenal of juniors.
In particular, the Gators are strong in four
weight classes. Stanford sophomore Robert
Hatta (134 pounds) will have his hands full
when he wrestles Richard Gutierrez, who has
beaten Matt Cano, a returning NCAA qualifi
er for the Cardinal.
To overcome San Francisco State, the Car
dinal must win the matches it is supposed to
win and also pull off some upsets. Although
Stanford is not 100 percent health wise, head

coach Chris Horpel expects that his squad will
emerge victorious.
If his knee heals, senior co-captain Jimmy
Aguirre (134 pounds) will battle junior

Richard Hilas, who finished second in the All-
California Open last week in the 142-pound

division. (Aguirre will wrestle one
weight class higher if he competes
at all.) Cardinal sophomore Scott
Chapman must contend with
junior Chris Delgado, who placed
third in the 177-pound weight
division in the All-California
event.
Cardinal junior Bryan Vani

man (190) will meet junior Lee
Lofton, who went 2-2 at the
Open. Vaniman and Lofton have
wrestled many times, but neither
has managed to dominate the
series. Vaniman is, however,
nursing an injured knee, and if he
is unable to start, sophomore
Jason Gladden will replace him.
Overall, Cardinal wrestlers are
enthusiastic about tonight's
meet, and despite the high caliber
of opposition, Horpel remains
confident. "This is a big rivalry,"
he said. "I expect to win."
