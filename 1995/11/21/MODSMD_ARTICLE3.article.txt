# Contract negotiations halt EV repairs

Uproar over poor conditions and slow-moving
renovations in Escondido Village spurred the
University into action, leading to widespread im
provements last year.
But that progress came to a halt last month
when contractors stopped work on renovations
in order to renegotiate contracts which expired
five months ago.
The contractors had been working for four
months under "extended contracts," or short
term service orders, after their regular contracts
expired.
One of the reasons the hiatus has taken so
long is that the University is changing the scope
of the renovations from doing apart ments piece
meal "to doing one mid-rise at a time and to
doing a whole neighborhood of low rises," said

Director of Housing and Food Services Keith
Guy. "It takes time to get the plan figured out."
Cooper, head of contracts for the firm
handling floor renovations in Escondido, said
this is the first time in his 28 years of working
with Stanford that he can remember working on
an extended contract basis, as opposed to having
normal contracts renewed in a timely manner.
Cooper's contract expired in June, he said,
and since then his firm, Conklin Brothers, has
worked under a series of short-term service
order contracts which eventually expired in Sep
tember.
The University rebids contracts periodically
in order to ensure that it is getting the best deal
available, said Assoc. Director of Housing and
Dining Services Rodger Whitney. In the case of
Escondido Village, the contract has normally
been rebid in September or October.
Officials in the University's Housingand Din

ing Services said the contract problem, although
unusual, is not major and will not cause delays in
finishing the 10-year renovation project on time.
In the past, students living in Escondido Vil
lage have compkiined about inefficient repair
service, housing conditions, lack of student input
and rent disparities. Last year, these difficulties
led to the formation of the Escondido Village
Family Council, which confronted administra
tors about the problems. Students and housing
and facilities administrators agree that condi
tions and satisfaction have improved this year.
But graduate student Jim Hansen, head of
last year's family council, said he was disap
pointed by the break in renovations which had
been progressing so successfully.
"This sounds like another Stanford bureau
crat bungling things," Hansen said. "I can't say
