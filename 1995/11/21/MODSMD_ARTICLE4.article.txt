# Hawk gunned down after rescue, release
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
After surviving a crash into Tan
ner Fountain earlier this year, a
red-tail hawk has succumbed to yet
another human danger on campus.
The hawk, which had been re
leased Oct. 17 at the Oval after
being rehabilitated by the Wildlife
Rescue volunteer raptor team, was
found dead near the Facilities Op
erations Building just before noon
on Nov. 13.
A plumber reported he had
found the dead bird, with a wound
that "appeared to be from a
firearm," according to Stanford
Police Sgt. John McMullen.
The bird was most likely sitting
in a tree when it was shot, judging
by the angle of the bullet's en
trance, said Pediatrics Depart
ment Grant Management Special
ist Karen Hoyt, a longtime Wildlife
Rescue volunteer.
"I'm just outraged that some
one is shooting off firearms on
campus and, beyond that, is taking
the life of an innocent bird that
was sitting in a tree," Hoyt said.
Police have no suspects for the
crime as of yet, but anyone accused
could face charges at the local,
state and national levels, Mc-
Mullen said. The use of firearms is
a felony on campus.
The crime also violated the Mi
gratory Bird Protection Act on a
state and federal level, said Chris
Brong, a special agent for the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service in Sacra
mento. On the federal level, he
said, someone found guilty of vio
lating the act could be charged a

maximum of a $5,000 fine.
The shooting of the red-tiiil hawk
is the third incident of bird-shooting
on campus in the past five years.
Five years ago, another hawk was
shot near the Stanford Barn and two
years ago, a barn owl was shot near
Memorial Church, Hoyt said.
Bonnie Hale of the Sponsored
Projects Office at Stanford said
news of the bird's death was hard
to take after she had helped nurse
it back to health in October as a
member of Wildlife Rescue.
On Oct. 6, the bird was found in
Tanner Fountain between Memo
rial Auditorium and Hoover
Tower. It was a female red-tail
hawk at least two years old, Hale
said, and "may have been one of a
nesting pair found in Escondido
Village this spring," she said.
Hoyt added that Wildlife Res
cue believes the bird raised three
of its own young this year and
spent its time within a 1.5- to 2-
mile stretch of territory on cam
pus.
When the bird was taken from
the fountain, it had "slight impact
injuries," and the volunteer group
"wanted to make sure it could fly
and hunt on its own," Hale said.
"We knew it was doing quite
well on its own for two years here
at Stanford," she added.
Other volunteers with Wildlife
Rescue, as well as the police and
Fish and Game wardens involved,
have expressed "disbelief and
anger" at the incident, Hale said.
A $1,000 reward is being of
fered by the Santa Clara County
Fish and Game office for informa
tion about the incident.
