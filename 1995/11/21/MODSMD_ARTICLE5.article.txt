# Cooperation key formed schools
## UCSF program merge part of trend 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Cooperation, not competition, is
the wave of the future for hospitals
and medical schools responding to
the economic pressures of health
care reform, Stanford doctors say.
A recent announcement of Stan
ford Medical Center's discussion
with UC-San Francisco (UCSF) on
collaborating in patient care pro
grams reflects Stanford's strong
commitment to forming alliances
with peer institutions, according to

Stanford facultv.
UCSF Chan
cellor Joseph
Martin and Stan
ford President
Gerhard Casper's
joint announce
ment that the two
medical centers —
widely considered
to be two of the
nation's most ad
vanced — are con-

sidering strengthening efforts to
work together reflects a growing na
tional trend toward consolidating in
stitutional resources and research in
a common pursuit to increase the
quality of both research and care.
"Such collaboration would serve
the public better in several ways,"
Casper said in a press release. "It
would provide a critical mass for
teaching in small specialty pro
grams and more diverse clinical
training opportunities in all pro
grams. Collaboration offers the po
tential for achieving efficiencies and
cost reductions that neither of us
could achieve alone."
No further details of the plan are
available yet, said University Com
munications Director Terry Shep
ard.
The proposed collaboration
marks another in a series of steps
Stanford has recently taken toward
confronting the increasingly urgent
need to cut costs without sacrificing
quality of research and practice.
"If we leave medicine to the
forces of the marketplace, some
places will compete fiercely against
one another, which will inevitably

mean losses for some institutions"
said Dr. Halsted Holman, co-chief of
Stanford's Department of Family
and Community Medicine. "This
could happen to medical centers un
less we engage in a helpful, thought
ful search" for ways to increase effi
ciency.
Many faculty at Stanford's Med
ical Center feel that increased ef
forts to collaborate with UCSF are
likely to have mutually beneficial ef
fects.
Gwendolynne Yeo, project direc
tor for the Stanford Geriatric Edu
cation Center, said that "having a
structure in place that would allow
for easier and more extensive collab
oration between Stanford and
UCSF would strengthen us signifi
cantly."
