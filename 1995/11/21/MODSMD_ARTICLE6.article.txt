# Experts call for med school cuts

Despite an expert panel's
recent recommendation for
deep cuts in the number of
medical students, professors
at the School of Medicine
don't foresee any major
changes to Stanford's admis
sions policies.
The Pew Health Profes
sions Commission in Wash
ington, D.C., issued a report
Friday recommending that
the number of medical
schools be cut by 20 percent in
an effort to reduce inefficien
cy and control inflation in the
world of medical care.
Dr. Dale Kaiser, professor
of biochemistry in the Med
ical School, expressed doubt
about the recommendations.
"I don't know whether
they're right, but I know
there's a problem," he said. "I
think it would be a shame if Stan
ford cut way back as a public ser
vice measure."
Kaiser, who serves on the Med
ical School Faculty Senate, noted
that it is a "[medical] school's
responsibility to be straightfor
ward" with the doctors it trains in
terms of the availability of jobs
after they get their degrees.
According to Dr. Charlotte
Jacobs, an associate dean at the

Medical School, the Pew Commis
sion has no power to enact the
policies it recommends. She said
that its report poses "no threat" to
the Medical School.
"Stanford is one of the smallest
[medical] schools in the U. 5.,"
Jacobs said. "We have a very small
class. . .. [We would be] next to
last" if schools were ever closed,
she said.
The Medical School admits 86
students each year and has about
540 doctors-in-training in its 24
residency programs.
The commission was formed
five years ago by the Pew Charita
ble Trusts to investigate issues in

medicine and propose solutions to
health-care problems. Its 21 mem
bers include medical educators,
health professionals, former gov
ernment officials and insurance
company executives.
The commission made its rec
ommendation in light of what it
views as a surplus of doctors
nationwide, according to an article
in The New York Times. The
newspaper stated that the current
doctor-to-patient ratio is 240 for
every 100,000. The commission's
report emphasized that the ideal
ratio for a managed-care system
would be 150 for every 100,000.
The commission's overarching

recommendation is to reduce the
size of the total U.S. medical
school class by 20 to 25 percent
over the next 10 years, both
through the closing of medical
schools and the reduction of resi
dency programs.
Part of the commission's pro
posal is to limit the number of par
ticipating international medical
school graduates.
Dr. Elliott Wolfe, associate
dean for student affairs at the
Medical School, emphasized that
the issue of whether to limit the
enrollment of international stu
dents in American medical schools
is a key one in cutting down the

overall number of physicians in
the U.S.
Wolfe said that decreasing the
number of domestically trained
doctors will only result in an
influx of foreign-trained doctors,
not in an overall reduction of
physicians.
"I know the work of the Pew. I
know they're a highly regarded
organization," Wolfe said. But, he
added, the commission's recom
mendations should be a launching
pad for debate and should not be
accepted without question.
Another consequence of closing
medical schools might be that
medical research would drop off,

said Craig Cummings, a doctoral
candidate in the Medical School's
genetics department, something
that would "never be good for the
country."
Although the number of appli
cations to medical schools in the
U.S. has been steadily increasing
over the last seven years, Judith
Colwell, the assistant director of
admissions at the Medical School,
said that this year's 7,000 applica
tions did not represent an increase
from last year.
Wolfe was hesitant to speculate
on whether the Pew Commis
sion's report will discourage
potential applicants.
