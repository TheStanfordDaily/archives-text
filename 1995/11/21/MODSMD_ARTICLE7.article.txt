# Off the catwalk: Pageant winner breaks out of the mold
## Integrity key for Miss Teen of America 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Contributing writer 
Stanford sophomore Sonya
Wang does not own a tiara, is not
ditzy and did not have to pose in
a bathing suit in order to win the
title of Miss Teen of America.

She does smile a lot, but only sin
cerely.
Wang, 19, assumed the role of
Miss Teen of America in a
pageant held last August in San
Diego. The three months since
then, she said, have been filled
with traveling, making public ap

pearances and studying for pre
med classes.
"Miss Teen of America is a
scholarship and recognition pro
gram," said Wang. "It's not a
beauty pageant. A lot of people
don't realize that."
Remarkably, Wang is the third

Miss Teen of America to attend
Stanford, out of a total of 12 since
the establishment of the pageant.
"Miss Teen of America is a com
pany itself, created to offer schol
arships to females," Wang ex
plained. Her scholarship amount
ed to $10,000.
The company, which is based in
Minnesota, makes a profit
through entry fees for local and
national pageants and through
the advertisements which appear
in in-house publications.
"The contest is veiy new and
very professional," said Wang. In
competition and in public, "we al
ways appear in suits. There are no
ball gowns, unless it's a cocktail
party." As further evidence of the
pageant's professionalism, Wang
cited the fact that contestants are
accompanied at all times by chap
erones.
The contest in San Diego was,
in the bubbly pageant jargon used
even by Wang, "a whirlwind." One
hundred and sixty young women
from all over the country partici
pated.
"I felt totally honored [to win],
but parfc of me felt like, 'I'm not
even worthy,' " she said. Again de
fying stereotypes, Wang said that
when her name was announced,
she did not burst into mascara
laden tears. "I felt dazed, like a
zombie."
Wang's victory was the culmi
nation of four years on various
pageant circuits, starting at age 15
