# Off the catwalk: Pageant winner breaks out of the mold
## Integrity key for Miss Teen of America 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Contributing writer 
Stanford sophomore Sonya
Wang does not own a tiara, is not
ditzy and did not have to pose in
a bathing suit in order to win the
title of Miss Teen of America.

She does smile a lot, but only sin
cerely.
Wang, 19, assumed the role of
Miss Teen of America in a
pageant held last August in San
Diego. The three months since
then, she said, have been filled
with traveling, making public ap

pearances and studying for pre
med classes.
"Miss Teen of America is a
scholarship and recognition pro
gram," said Wang. "It's not a
beauty pageant. A lot of people
don't realize that."
Remarkably, Wang is the third

Miss Teen of America to attend
Stanford, out of a total of 12 since
the establishment of the pageant.
"Miss Teen of America is a com
pany itself, created to offer schol
arships to females," Wang ex
plained. Her scholarship amount
ed to $10,000.
The company, which is based in
Minnesota, makes a profit
through entry fees for local and
national pageants and through
the advertisements which appear
in in-house publications.
"The contest is veiy new and
very professional," said Wang. In
competition and in public, "we al
ways appear in suits. There are no
ball gowns, unless it's a cocktail
party." As further evidence of the
pageant's professionalism, Wang
cited the fact that contestants are
accompanied at all times by chap
erones.
The contest in San Diego was,
in the bubbly pageant jargon used
even by Wang, "a whirlwind." One
hundred and sixty young women
from all over the country partici
pated.
"I felt totally honored [to win],
but parfc of me felt like, 'I'm not
even worthy,' " she said. Again de
fying stereotypes, Wang said that
when her name was announced,
she did not burst into mascara
laden tears. "I felt dazed, like a
zombie."
Wang's victory was the culmi
nation of four years on various
pageant circuits, starting at age 15

As one of her official duties as Miss Teen of America, sophomore Sonya Wang participates in many
public excursions and activities, such as milking a cow in a farmyard.
when she was named Miss Camar
illo in her hometown of Ventura
County, Calif. She was the reign
ing Miss Teen of California when
she became Miss Teen of America.
Wang's victory was also the
culmination of 10 days of outings
and contests. "During the day
time, we would be in parades or go
to the zoo or go on a harbor
cruise. We did a lot of touristy
things," Wang said. In public,
contestants wore their banners at
ail times.
"There was a competition every
night. One was personal develop
ment, which was sort of like tal
ent. I played the piano," said
Wang.
On another night, there was
"the service and achievement
competition," in which contes
tants embodied a symbol or per
son that represented their state.
"It was a fun part of the competi
tion," said Wang. "I was a Califor
nia condor. I was decked out in

feathers and got to fly around [the
stage]."
A similarly innovative idea,
Wang reported, was that of the
contestant who dressed as a
reflective highway divider. "She
wore a big piece of cardboard,"
Wang said. "Another girl was a big
Ilershey's kiss. She would rub her
stomach and say, 'Yum, yum.' "
The closest that the Miss Teen
of America contest came to more
traditional pageants was during
the night of "poise and personality
projection in formal wear."
"You wear a prom dress or
gown," said Wang. "You walk in
front of the audience. But it's not
physical beauty [that matters],
it's the presentation of your confi
dence."
In the interview part of the
competition, pageant administra
tors asked, "What do you think is
the most important quality for
Miss Teen of America to possess?"
"I said integrity," Wang said.
"It encompasses a lot of different
qualities — sincerity, wisdom,
leadership."
It is her role as a leader or role
model which Wang finds most

rewarding. She regularly address
es children's groups. "I love work
ing with kids. [I love] when I see
kids getting turned on to life —
their eyes are totally wide.
"I talk about my past experi
ences, how I've reached my goals.
I try to set an example and show
them that if they work at it, they
can reach their goals, too." Wang
said she promotes avoiding drugs
and staying in school.
In addition to speaking to
youth groups, Wang said she has
participated in several conven
tions and celebrations, such as the
Wagga Wagga Festival in Aus
tralia.
"It was a time for the commu
nity to come together and build
spirit," Wang said. During the fes
tival, Wang had the opportunity to
rub elbows with the Duke and
Duchess of Wagga Wagga. Their
roles, Wang said, are not unlike
those of a prom king and queen
for the elderly.
In addition to visiting Aus
tralia, Wang has gone "on appear
ance" in Washington, D.C., and
plans to visit Texas and Minneso
ta in the spring. Since the begin

ning of the quarter, Wang has
missed three-and-a-half weeks of
school.
"I've talked to my professors
one-on-one, and they've been very
supportive," Wang said. "I'm tak
ing 13 units this quarter." Besides
being a pre-med student, Wang
plans to major either in economics
or East Asian studies.
Additionally, explained Wang,
"I've cut down on activities this
year." Even so, Wang is the chair
person for the Frosh Thank-a
thon and a member of the social
committee in her dorm.
Wang anticipates this year
being her busiest. In the future,
she said, she will not compete in
any more pageants.
"This is it. I've done it for four
years. I think I need to move on
and graduate in four years," she
said.
"There are always times when
it's draining," Wang admitted.
"Hut it's a once-in-a-lifetime deal.
The rewards you reap are so
much more than what you put
into it.
"Once you take off your ban
ner, you can relax," Wang said.
