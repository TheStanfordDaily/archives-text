# Federal cuts force SLAC layoffs
## 60-70 positions will fall victim to $7 million budget reduction 
### Frank Guinan Editorial staff 
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
Director Burton Richter announced
yesterday that the center will be forced
to cut 60 to 70 staff positions by next
year because of a decrease in federal
funding from the Department of Ener
gy-
Last Tuesday, President Clinton
signed the Energy and Water Bill con
taining the Department of Energy's
budget for the current fiscal year.
SLAC, which is run by Stanford for the

Department of Energy, had its operat
ing budget reduced by 7 percent —
around $7 million — in the new legisla
tion. SLAC's operat ing budget for fiscal
year 1995 was $123 million.
While Clinton signed the bill only
last week, the decrease in the Depart
ment of Energy's funding has been an
ticipated for almost six months, said
P.A. Moore, academic resource and
program officer at SI.AC.
"In that sense, you can say that the
decision to lay off staff members has
been precipitating for months," she
said.

SLAC currently employs 1,350 peo
ple — half of whom are degreed profes
sionals. The layoff process will decrease
that number to about 1,280.
In order to begin the staff downsiz
ing process, SLAC managers are now
asking for volunteers who wish to be
laid off. After volunteers have been
identified, involuntary layoff notices
will be given out starting Jan. 1. SLAC
administrators have until April 1 to
complete the entire layoff process.
According to Moore, the final num
ber of those laid off will depend on who
comes forward as volunteers.

"It will depend on the positions and
salaries of the volunteers laid off," she
said.
Richter announced the layoffs dur
ing his address on the state of the cen
ter Monday before the full staff at
SLAC. Richter's annual address usual
ly comes after the appropriations bill
from the Department of Energy is
signed and concentrates on the implica
tions of federal funding on SLAC re
search.
