# Federal cuts force SLAC layoffs
## 60-70 positions will fall victim to $7 million budget reduction 
### Frank Guinan Editorial staff 
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
Director Burton Richter announced
yesterday that the center will be forced
to cut 60 to 70 staff positions by next
year because of a decrease in federal
funding from the Department of Ener
gy-
Last Tuesday, President Clinton
signed the Energy and Water Bill con
taining the Department of Energy's
budget for the current fiscal year.
SLAC, which is run by Stanford for the

Department of Energy, had its operat
ing budget reduced by 7 percent —
around $7 million — in the new legisla
tion. SLAC's operat ing budget for fiscal
year 1995 was $123 million.
While Clinton signed the bill only
last week, the decrease in the Depart
ment of Energy's funding has been an
ticipated for almost six months, said
P.A. Moore, academic resource and
program officer at SI.AC.
"In that sense, you can say that the
decision to lay off staff members has
been precipitating for months," she
said.

SLAC currently employs 1,350 peo
ple — half of whom are degreed profes
sionals. The layoff process will decrease
that number to about 1,280.
In order to begin the staff downsiz
ing process, SLAC managers are now
asking for volunteers who wish to be
laid off. After volunteers have been
identified, involuntary layoff notices
will be given out starting Jan. 1. SLAC
administrators have until April 1 to
complete the entire layoff process.
According to Moore, the final num
ber of those laid off will depend on who
comes forward as volunteers.

"It will depend on the positions and
salaries of the volunteers laid off," she
said.
Richter announced the layoffs dur
ing his address on the state of the cen
ter Monday before the full staff at
SLAC. Richter's annual address usual
ly comes after the appropriations bill
from the Department of Energy is
signed and concentrates on the implica
tions of federal funding on SLAC re
search.
"We have a very sound science pro-

gram here, but because of the
budget restrictions, we must
operate on a somewhat smaller
scale than we have before,"
Richter said in a press release
yesterday.
While many knew of the
impending cuts in federal
research, professors and
researchers at SLAC nevertheless
said the size of the layoffs came as
somewhat of a surprise.
"There was a realization that
the lab would have to be smaller,"
said David Leith, director of
research at SLAC. The center
only determined the number of
layoffs after the Energy Depart
ment's budget was finalized, he
said.
SLAC was founded in 1962 to
study the basic constituents of
matter and the forces that act
between them. In its 33-year his
tory, the center has attracted sci
entists from all over the world to
participate in its experimental
programs. SLAC Professor Mar
tin Perl received this year's Nobel
Prize in physics for discoveries
made while at the center.
While funding for SLAC's
operating budget has been
decreased, funding for construc
tion and equipment at SLAC has
actually increased. This increase
ensures that research projects —
such as the construction of the B
factory, SLAC's new accelerator
project — will proceed according
to plan.

"We do not expect [the cuts] to
harm research projects," Moore
said. "The B-factory is still on
schedule. That was not part of
the operations budget."
Moore acknowledged that
although Clinton signed the bill,
the final figure in the appropria
tions bill could change.
"The situation in Washington
is so fluid right now," she said.
"They could announce even fur
ther cuts or decide to give addi
tional funding."
Layoffs represent nothing new
for SLAC.
"There have been layoffs in
the past" due to funding decreas
es from the government, said
Arthur Bienenstock, an associ
ate professor at SLAC. "Every
one of them is terrible. We have

people who work very hard. It's
terrible to be put in that situa
tion."
According to Moore, a tempo
rary "budget glitch" in the 1970s
resulted in reduced time worked
and a mandatory furlough for
some employees. While that situ
ation posed a short-term prob
lem, the current budget struggle
is different.
"This is a long, five-year prob
lem," Moore said. "The budget
looks like it will continue to be
reduced in the coming years."
She added that budget reductions
could bring additional layoffs in
the future.
"The budget from Washington
is not going to go up," Leith said.
Richter could not be reached
for further comment yesterday.
