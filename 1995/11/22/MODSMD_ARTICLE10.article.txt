## Long history of the war 
### 
Europe' 6 longest conflict since World
War II started with a flareup in
Yugoslavia's northwestern tip. It was
enough to shock many. Much worse was
to come.
One thousand six hundred and six
days passed between those first shots in
the Yugoslav republic of Slovenia and
the peace accord reached yesterday in
Dayton, Ohio. More than 200,000 peo
ple were dead or missing, and more than
3 million forced from their homes.
The war and its negotiated settle
ment left the map of former Yugoslavia
redrawn. But the ethnic animosities
that sparked the conflict continue to
smolder, and could well flare again.
The war left few people unchanged.
The people of the former Yugoslavia
lost loved ones, land and livelihot>ds.
Peacekeepers and aid workers came
away cynical and hurting. The United
Nations learned the limitations of
peacekeeping. NATO saw action for the
first time, highlighted bv a month-long
assault on Bosnian Serbs that helped
curb their appetite for war.
It all began when Slovenia, the

northwestern republic of the old
Yugoslavia, declared independence June
25, 1991. The Serb-dominated Yugoslav
People's Army tried to put down the
rebellion by force but gave up after a 10-
day war.
There was no sizable Serb minority
to protect. So Serbia, whose dominance
of the old Yugoslavia sparked much of
the secessionist sentiment in the other
republics, allowed Slovenia to slip away.
Invoking strong nationalist senti
ments, Milosevic spoke of creating a
"Greater Serbia" for all Serbs of the for
mer Yugoslav federation.
A month after it declared indepen
dence, Croatia exploded in ethnic fight
ing in July 1991. Rebel Serbs, backed by
the Yugoslav army, took a third of the
republic in a six-month war that left
more than 10,000 people dead and hun
dreds of thousands displaced.
The battle for Vukovar was symbolic
of the fury of the conflict. The town on
the border near Serbia fell Nov. 18 that
year after a three-month pounding by
Yugoslav army artillery that left it in
rubble.
