# Bosnian leaders reach peace accord
## Clinton guarantees U.S. troops' presence to keep peace 
### 
DAYTON, Ohio (AP) - Under U.S.
prodding, Balkan leaders agreed yesterday
to end 3 1/2 years of savage fighting and
carve Bosnia into two ethnic zones. Presi
dent Clinton renewed his pledge to send
20,000 U.S. peacekeepers to the former
Yugoslav republic despite congressional
opposition.
The dramatic agreement, which
remained elusive up to the last moment,
came after 21 days of hard bargaining
among the leaders of Bosnia, Serbia and
Croatia at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base.
"The people of Bosnia finally have a
chance to turn from the horror of war to
the promise of peace," Clinton declared in
a Rose Garden announcement of the
accord â€” potentially a major foreign poli
cy success for the administration.
The three Balkan presidents initialed
the pact yesterday afternoon in a ceremo
ny at Wright-Patterson and shook hands
stiffly. A formal agreement ending the eth
nic bloodletting that has claimed a quar
ter-million lives is to be signed next month
in Paris.

The agreement provides for Bosnia's
division into two entities, a Muslim-Croat
federation that will control 51 percent of
the territory, and a Serb republic that will
hold the remaining 49 percent. It calls for
a central government with a democratical
ly elected president and parliament and
bars indicted war criminals from holding
military or elected office.
The Balkan presidents, while express
ing reservations, characterized the accord
as the best that could be achieved.
"This may not be a just peace, but it is
more just than a continuation of war,"
Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic said.
"In the world as it is, a better peace will
not have been achieved."
For his part, Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman said he thought the accord
"would result in lasting peace and create
conditions for the establishment of a new
world order in this part of the world."
But in a sign of difficulties ahead, throe
Bosnian Serbs in the Serb delegation boy
cotted the initialing ceremony. One of
them, Momcila Krajisnik, speaker of
Bosnian Serb parliament, told his follow

ers they should not and would not comply
with its provisions.
Clinton reaffirmed his intention to
send American ground troops to take part
in a NATO peacekeeping force but said
there would be "no complete deployment"
until Congress is heard on the issue.
The Pentagon said an "enabling force"
of up to 2,000 soldiers from NATO coun
tries would go to Bosnia to prepare the
way for the main peace force. U.S. troops
would go only afler Clinton approved U.S.
participation, but before the Bosnia peace
deal is signed in Paris.
The House has voted to prevent money
from being spent to send U.S. troops to
Bosnia unless Clinton first gets congres
sional approval, but the administration
insists the Constitution does not require
it.
A key provision of the accord commits
the parties to cooperate with a U.N. war
crimes tribunal and excludes Radovan
Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian
Serbs' indicted political and military lead
ers, from any position of authority in the
new Bosnia.
