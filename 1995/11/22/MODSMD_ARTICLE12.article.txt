SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) â€” When
the words they longed to hear finally came, Bosni
ans were in a cocoon of snow and darkness, uncer
tainty and hope.
It was not unlike conditions they have endured
in 43 months of war.
"Are you kidding me? They really signed a
peace deal? This is superb!" shouted 28-year-old
Sejla Kulenovic.
Gunshots were fired in celebration in Serb-held
Bijeljina when President Clinton announced a
peace deal had been struck after 21 days of talks
in Dayton, Ohio. Machine-gun fire also echoed in
Sarajevo's Serb-held suburbs.
But in the Bosnian capital, history professor
Boris Nilevic was wondering whether the peace
could hold.

"This is great, but how long it is going to last?"
he muttered, biting his fingernails after waiting
48 hours to watch President Clinton make the
announcement on TV.
Halid Begic, a 40-year old Bosnian army sol
dier, strolled down a snowy street in downtown
Sarajevo moments after the peace deal was
announced.
"Nothing better could be done, and it was about
time," he said. "However, it is best to stay in
trenches to stay safe."
Most of Tuzla, where U.S. soldiers would be
headquartered in a NATO peace force, was dark
and isolated by an electrical failure yesterday, but
people still managed to hear the news.
"The most important thing is that the shooting
stops," said Emina Pehlivanovic, a 37-year-old

boutique owner in Tuzla. "Everything else will
come with time."
Outside Tuzla's main hotel, where 10 inches of
snow had piled up, children threw firecrackers
and spread the word.
"It is good," said 21-year-old Mirza Terzic.
"Everything else will be solved later, either by
time or politically."
The sense of relief mixed with uncertainty was
equally apparent in Pale, the Bosnian Serb head
quarters. Many wondered whether they would
ever again see Sarajevo, the capital of the Muslim
led Bosnian government which negotiators
promised would not be divided.
"I would be the happiest man in the world if it
would last, but it is impossible," said 25-year-old
Pedja, who would not give his last name. "We can

never live together again."
Miodrag Pekic, a 27-year-old Serb, also was
skeptical, predicting the Bosnian army would use
the lull in fighting to rearm itself "and then we
will fight again."
Indeed, the question on the minds of many
Bosnians who remained loyal to the Sarajevo gov
ernment was the purpose of a war that had left an
estimated 250,000 people dead or missing.
"Why were all the people killed and I wound
ed?" asked Refik Ejupovic, a 30-year-old govern
ment soldier. "What kind of peace will this be if we
lost so much?"
On the other side of the front line, 24-year-old
Tomo Savic also had questions.
"We have adapted to war," Savic said in Pale.
"Now we have to get used to peace."
