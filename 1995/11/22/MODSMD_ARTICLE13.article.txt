I)ow Jones reaches all-time high
NEW YORK (AP) — The Dow Jones industrial
average closed above 5,000 for the first time yes
terday, a pre-Thanksgiving boost that reflects the
vitality of the U.S. stock market.
The index of stocks in America's corporate
giants has risen by more than 30 percent this
year, a remarkable advance. Yesterday's rise of
40.46 points put the best-known barometer of
Wall Street at 5,023.55.
The Dow average, compiled from the prices of
30 stocks, is a small portion of the thousands of
equities that trade every day on the New York and
American stock exchanges and through the Nas
daq system. But since it first appeared in 1884, it
has been designed to include a representative
cross-section of the market.
On Monday, the Dow touched 5,000 a few
times but closed below the mark.
Strength in Dow Jones mainstays like IBM,
McDonald's and General Motors led the Dow's
upward move, taking the place — at least for now
— of the high-technology issues that have domi
nated this year's rally.
Investor confidence has been buoyed by a com
bination of moderate economic growth, low inter
est rates and little inflation that has helped boost
the profits of U.S. corporations. Technology com
panies, such as makers of computers, software
and semiconductor chips, have been particularly
strong performers.
During the past few days, however, technology
investors have been selling shares in the belief

that the industry's rapid growth has peaked.
Senator quits presidential race
WASHINGTON (AP) — Pennsylvania Sen.
Arlen Specter, languishing with little visible sup
port for his moderate message, suspended his
Republican presidential campaign yesterday
night due to a lack of funding.
"I am suspending my candidacy for the nomi
nation because I am out of money," Specter said
in an appearance on CNN's "Larry King Live."
Specter, whose campaign has been struggling
financially for some time, stopped just short of
dropping out of the race completely.
"What I'm doing tonight and for the next sev
eral days will be appealing to Republicans across
the country who are looking for a message of
moderation to help me finance the campaign,"
Specter told the program's guest host, former
Pennsylvania Gov. Dick Thornburgh.
Specter's departure from the race would leave
a GOP field of eight candidates dominated by
conservatives. He planned a formal announce
ment of his decision on Wednesday in Philadel
phia.
Specter, who failed to rise above 2 percent in
the polls, had sought to pull his party back from
what he considered a far right tilt influenced by
intolerant extremists.
Technically, Specter planned to put his cam
paign into suspended status, which allows him to
collect some $1.2 million in federal matching
funds in January to pay off his bills, said one offi
cial.
