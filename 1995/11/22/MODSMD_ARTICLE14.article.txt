# French detonate fourth nuke

### 
PARIS (AP) — Less than a
week after 95 nations voted to
condemn its nuclear testing,
France detonated a fourth under
ground nuclear blast yesterday at
its test site in the South Pacific.
The Defense Ministry said the
blast was equal to 40 kilotons, or
40,000 tons of TNT. That makes
the bomb nearly three times as
powerful as the one that
destroyed Hiroshima in 194.5.
Australian seismologists said the
explosion was as strong as a mag
nitude-5.1 earthquake.
France conducted the test
beneath Mururoa Atoll, 750 miles
southeast of Tahiti in French
Polynesia, at 12:30 p.m. local time
(1:30 p.m. PST), the Defense Min
istry said in a statement.
In moving ahead with the test
ing, France pushed aside protests
from around the world.
"Once again, the strong —
France — has dominated the
small — Polynesia," said the Rev.
Jacques Ihorai, president of the
Polynesian Evangelical Church.
Australia and New Zealand,
which have been among the
most outspoken critics of the
testing, were quick to condemn
the latest blast. Both countries
said they would make formal
protests to the French ambas

sadors in their capitals.
"The prime minister ... is
appalled at the French govern
ment's continued disregard for
feelings of the people the South
Pacific," said a spokesman for
Australian Prime Minister Paul
Keating.
At the United Nations last
week, 95 countries voted to con
demn France's nuclear testing.
Only France and Britain voted
against the resolution.
In response to votes from
Rome and Brussels, President
Jacques Chirac canceled the
annual French-Italian summit,
scheduled for Nov. 24-25 in
Naples, and postponed a meeting
with Belgian Prime Minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene.
Yesterday, Chirac thanked
Germany, Spain and Greece for
abstaining on the vote and
praised them for what he called
their "attitude of solidarity."
France contends the tests are
necessary to check its nuclear
arsenal and develop computer
simulations that will make actual
detonations unnecessary in the
future. The first test on Sept. 5
broke a three-year moratorium.
Chirac has promised to sign a
global test ban treaty after com
pleting the series of tests by next

May. The series originally was set
for eight blasts, but the French
government recently said it could
cut the series to six.
The first test measured less
than 20 kilotons, and it caused
Mururoa's lagoon to foam and
churn. A second, much more pow
erful blast of about 110 kilotons
was set off Oct. 2 beneath neigh
boring Fangataufa Atoll. The
third test was conducted beneath
Mururoa on Oct. 27.
Environmentalists, led by
Greenpeace, contend the testing
is needless and dangerous to a
region known for its crystalline
waters and rich marine life.
In New Zealand, Greenpeace
spokesman Michael Szabo said
Chirac had given the internation
al community what amounted to
a slap in the face.
"Chirac's ignorance of interna
tional politics and arrogant disre
gard for the millions of people
around the world protesting
against nuclear testing is
obscene," Szabo said.
Earlier yesterday, a French
peace activist said she would file a
lawsuit in the European Union's
highest court charging that the
EU executive commission is fail
ing to protect South Pacific
islanders from radiation.
