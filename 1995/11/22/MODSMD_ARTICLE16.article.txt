## Editorials Gaieties' message 
### 
Last week, hordes of
Stanford students, search
ing for a healthy dose of ver
bal Berkeley-bashing before their
football team did the real thing,
made their way to Memorial Audi
torium for Big Game Gaieties
1995. However, aside from a brief
Gaieties-within-Gaieties — which
mocked the concept of Gaieties
itself more than it did Cal — this
year's show was really about Stan
ford, and it had a startling
premise: A secret society of admin
istrators is plotting to suck the fun
out of Stanford.
One could easily write the
unusual theme of the show off as
an odd Gaieties experiment. How
ever, factor in the audience's identi
fication with and positive response
to the musical's message and the
show actually becomes something
of a reflection of campus sentiment.
Stanford students got the jokes;
they understood the references; it
seems they even shared the frus

tration of the actors who sang
songs containing lines like "Look
out Stanford / It's time to see the
light / Someone's out to suck the
fun / Get off your ass and fight /
Look out Stanford! / No time for
fatigue / We can't let them suck the
fun / This ain't the Ivy League!"
Now, there's obviously no evil
plan being unfurled by the admin
istration to change Stanford into
something it's not. However,
whether or not the resulting sig
nals are intentional, many recent
administrative actions have been
sending mixed messages to stu
dents — messages which have left
many students worried and con
fused.
Changes are being made around
here these days; whether they are
good or bad is hard to say just yet.
But increased communication
between officials and students can
only help alleviate campus confu
sion and let students know just
whom thev can trust.
