# Casper's capers
## 
### 
WHILE THIS YEAR'S Big
Game Gaieties script was
based on the premise that
the University administration is
maliciously making things miser
able for Stanford students, the high
ly enjoyable appearance of Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper proves
that even evil, conspiratorial admin
istrators know how to have fun.
In past shows, Casper has clear
ly not relished his time in the spot
light, unlike Dean of Undergradu
ate Admissions James Montoya,
who always gives us a nice song
and dance. In years past, Casper's
acting drew inevitable compar
isons to former University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, who loved
to ham it up in Gaieties.
But this year, Casper seemed to
make the effort to get into the spir
it of his role — and students
responded. Swooping out on stage
in a black cape like Darth Vader, he
played the misguided mastermind

of the plot to Suck Up AJI The Fun
at Stanford to the hilt. Students in
the audience cheered wildly as their
president, to the theme of "Mortal
Kombat," did battle with a "ninja
dollie."
Discussing the difference
between "cookie" and "nookie" in
front of a crowd of spirited stu
dents or dancing the can-can along
with the rest of the cast may not be
the most enjoyable 15 minutes in
Casper's year, but it's surprisingly
important to students. Like it or
not, student®; sometimes feel that
the "administration" — that neb
ulous, ill-defined body — is com
prised of a bunch of out-of-touch
old fogies. Even something as
seemingly minor as Casper's lively
performance can go a long way
toward proving this idea wrong.
Casper's wonderful perfor
mance helped to dispel the very
"truth" that "The Axe Files" pur
ported to reveal.
