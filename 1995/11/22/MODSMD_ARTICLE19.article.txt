## Aloha Bowl is bull 
### 
WELL, IT CERTAINLY sucks
that our football team is not
going to the Aloha Bowl, but
maybe we're better off not going. Why?
Here's what could've happened.
First of all, the stadium in Honolulu
— Aloha Stadium — is a terrible struc
ture. Built primarily out of metal, it has
been bathed in tropical air that is warm,
wet and salty. Thus, it is now primarily
rust. Estimated costs to remediate the
rust damage far exceed the stadium's
construction costs. Its playing surface is
artificial turf, always a terrible sign.
Basically, Aloha Stadium is a rusted
hulk of metal that is about to collapse.
The stadium's parking lot, however,
serves an interesting purpose. The lot
completely surrounds the circular stadi
um. A few days every week, it is the spot
of the Aloha Swap Meet, a tacky, tacky
flea market that seems to be dominated
by about three different vendors, with
booths and tables set up intermittently
around the stadium. You can walk
around and around and see the same
straw hats, flimsy tee shirts, allegedly
functional water sports equipment and
plenty of plastic bric-a-brac. Because it's
round and all the junk is the same, it is
difficult to retain one's sense of time and
space. It's a tacky time warp filled with
visiting mainlanders who take the bus
out to turn glossy pamphlet pictures
into their own pitiful vacation memo

ries.
Hawaii is much more than just our
50th state. In fact, that is its least
redeeming quality. As the most isolated
island chain in the world, it has a unique
Pacific-island character, which is still
palpable no matter how much develop
ers try to turn Oahu (which means
"gathering place" and where 80 percent
of the state's population lives) into a
tropical version of a nasty, crowded
mainland city.
For example, the Hawaiian language
has only 12 letters, five of which are
vowels. Hawaiian is reviving after years
of being officially repressed. This lan
guage must be appealing to all of the
team's communications majors — it
doesn't have half as many letters as
English. Certainly, this would woo some
of our players into permanently remain
ing in Hawaii. Even if our players want
ed to use English in Hawaii, our team
would need some crash tutelage in
speaking Pidgin, the local dialect.
Hawaii is also ruled by entirely differ
ent spirits than those in power on the
mainland. Wealth, power and material
largesse are only desired by those infect
ed with the "mainland's disease" (unfor
tunately, far too many are, as any
Hawaiian citizen here at Stanford could
illustrate with their own pathological
history). What matters is manna (per
sonal strength) and spirits of the land —

like Pele.
The cuisine is also quite different and
would likely send our boys into a funk.
There are all types of food from around
the Pacific. Filipinos would likely recom
mend bagong, fit only for the stout
hearted (a chicken egg three days prior
to hatching served whole, cooked or
uncooked). Poi, taro all gooed up,
requires some salivary acclimation.
There's also a delicious selection of raw
fish.
I'm most hesitant about the possible
results of football player plus surfer
waves. Winter is when the killer waves
come to the north shores of all the
islands, and Oahu has the best breaks of
them all. Pipeline's 25-foot screamers
certainly would be a match for most. But
you know how athletes like to boast
about their universal skills. I just doubt
they would consider acting as tiger
shark fodder a skill.
Besides, our football team is not
entirely free of Hawaiian citizens. They
can just go to Hawaii and visit and party
and forget playing ball. They wouldn't
have to practice anything except
karaoke and the ukulele.

UCLA? C'mon! Shreveport? Give me a
break!
