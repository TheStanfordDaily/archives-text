# Opinion mixed on 187 ruling
## 
### Tristan Sorah-Reyes Contributing writer 
A federal court decision Mon
day that parts of the cont r oversial
Proposition 187 are unconstitu
tional is proof that the U.S. legal
system is working, students and
facidty said.
"I heard the news this morning,
and it was the best news that I
could have started my day off
with," Frances Morales, director of
El Cent ro Chicano, said yesterday.
Proposition 187 is an immigra
tion-control measure that was
passed last year by California vot
ers. Main portions of the measure,
which denies public services to un
documented immigrants, were
struck down by U.S. District Judge
Mariana Pfael/er, who concluded
they conflicted with federal power
over immigration.
The proposition has been tied
up in court since it passed, but this
decision is the first final judgment
by a court on any of the measure's
provisions.
For now, the ruling means that
undocumented workers cannot be
asked about their immigration sta
tus when applying for public edu
cation or health and welfare bene
fits and cannot be denied public
schooling through the 12th grade.
"I feel that this decision is very
important," Morales said. "It will
make people feel they can seek
medical care or go to school with
out having to present documenta
tion; it also lifts the burden off of
people who are documented but
who could still be asked to present
proof that they are."
Sophomore ASSU senator
Christy Ramon conveyed her feel
ings about the decision by saying,
"It's really great that this decision
has been made. I am happy that
justice has happened in this coun
try, because there usually isn't any
justice for minorities in America.
"Proposition 187 is unconstitu
tional and is just a scare tactic to
use against immigrants and a way
of scapegoating," she said. "It tar
gets immigrants when they are
really not the problem."
Sophomore Julie Johnson, who
is president of the Stanford College
Republicans, offered a different
view on the decision, saying that

even if Proposition 187 is over
turned, it nevertheless represented
an important issue.
"As an American citizen you
have to accept the decision that the
judge made in declaring parts of the
measure unconstitutional, and
have faith in the Constitution and
the judicial system," she said.
"If Proposition 187 is taken to
the Supreme Court and the deci
sion is upheld, then we can at least
say that it was a good first step,"
Johnson said. "I don't think any
one expoctod it to become law, so
just the fact that it got this far and
brought this issue to the forefront
of the news means that it met a
major goal."
Political Science Prof. Luis
Fraga, the director of the Center
for Chicano Research, said, "I am
very pleased with the decision that
the court made. I was surprised,
though, that Judge Pfaelzer made
this decision on (he basis of a sum
mary judgment, which means she
usihl written testimony and briefs
but did not have a trial."

Fraga also discussed the dynam
ics of federal law and state law,
stilting that substantial portions of
Proposition 187 contradict federal
law. It is a principle of American
law that federal law supersedes
state law, but this decision is ulti
mately up to the discretion of the
Supreme Court, he said.
Fraga added that he expects the
decision to be appealed to the
Supreme Court, which will surely
uphold the lower court's decision,
since the current justices are open
to questioning precedent and
strictly reviewing the decisions of
lower courts.
"I don't think that the fight is
completely over yet, but at least
now we know that there is fairness
and justice and that people are
working hard to maintain it,"
Morales said. "This is going to be
an uphill battle, but it's a step in
the right direction."
State Attorney General Dan
Lungren promised to appeal the
ruling and expects the Supreme
Court to hear the case.
