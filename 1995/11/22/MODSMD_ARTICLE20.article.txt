COP representative did not represent everyone

AS A STUDENT who is opposed to
ignorance, racism and affirmative
action, I am deeply disturbed by
the way some of Stanford's outspoken
proponents of affirmative action are
characterizing critics of this controver
sial policy. Indeed, reason and rational
discourse seem to have fallen prey to
demagoguery.
Before the Rev. Jesse Jackson began
his recent speech in White Plaza, for
instance, Council of Presidents member
Rich Stolz delivered an introduction in
which he said that those who are
opposed to affirmative action "distort
the truth," "deny our experiences" and
"paint Stanford as a liberal pit of politi
cal correctness." I expected Rev. Jack-

son, the epitome of a demagogue, to
make such statements — and he did.
However, I did not expect a student
who allegedly represents the student
hody to dismiss the arguments of those
opposed to affirmative action so facilely
and grudgingly. Perhaps Stolz doesn't
realize it, but many of those opposed to
affirmative action do have rational rea
sons for their bent on the issue.
In his recent letter to The Daily, Bill
Shen said that the issues "at the core of
the affirmative action debate" are
"ignorance and racism." While one
could point to his dubious "white hairs"
comment as additional evidence, the
above comment should suffice in
demonstrating his depiction of critics of

affirmative action as racist and igno
rant.
I don't mean to pick on these two
individuals. After all, these are just two
of many examples of the abandonment
of reason for emotional appeal among
some of Stanford's vociferous propo
nents of affirmative action.
And I don't mean to criticize all pro
ponents of affirmative action. Pat
Buchanan and Pete Wilson demon
strate that demagoguery exists on the
other side of the debate as well.
Nevertheless, I have seen this dema
gogic "distortion of truth" only among
proponents of affirmative action here at
Stanford. But perhaps that's because
those opposed to the policy are not out

spoken about their views for fear of
being perceived as racist and ignorant.
I realized that affirmative action is
an emotional subject for many people.
However, if we are going to engage in
true rational discourse on this subject,
we must temper our emotions with rea
son. We must take all perspectives seri
ously and we must focus on what truly
is "at the core of the affirmative action
debate:" justice and the proper role of
government — not "racism," "igno
rance," "racial tribalism," "distorting
the truth" or anything else demagogues
on either side of the issue might claim.
