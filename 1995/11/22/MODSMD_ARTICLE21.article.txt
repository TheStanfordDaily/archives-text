# Administration needs to respond to alumni letters
## 
### 
letter writing was one of the glories of
the 18th century; major literary works
were written in that form. Since then, it
has been downhill all the way.
When I came to this country in 1937,1
was struck by the fact that letters to offi
cials elicited a prompt and courteous
reply. Now 90 percent of the mail we
receive is junk mail, often with one's
name inserted by machine to make it

appear that the bulk sender really cares
for us. Our intelligence is further insulted
by being offered something free. Letters
requesting donations are sent out by pro
fessional mailers for charitable or non
profit organizations whose executives give
themselves salaries which most donors
could never dream of.
Now a new administrative twist has
been added. Serious letters are not even
acknowledged. Administrators do not
wish to waste time on individuals other
than donors â€” they hope to discourage
unprofitable correspondence. Their
lawyers warn them that they might say

something incriminating or appear to
make a commitment.
University administrators follow this
pattern, disproving the old dictum that
universities are the homes of lost causes.
The record at Stanford and other univer
sities shows that polite correspondence
from alumni and faculty members goes
unanswered, whereas fear of student vio
lence produces prompt results. Demands
from noisy minorities distort University
curricula.
Stanford authorities seem unaware of
the wide resentment among alumni, facul
ty and students because of this churlish,

cowardly behavior. Most alumni would be
appeased even by a machine-generated
acknowledgment. I recently had a rare
experience: One administrator, whom
incidentally I have long respected, replied
to a letter from me with a nice hand-writ
ten note. I responded by bestowing on
him the only honor at my disposal: mem
bership in the Honorary Order of Pen
guins, which promotes old-fashioned val
ues. He is at present the only Stanford
administrator so honored. We hope to
elect more.
