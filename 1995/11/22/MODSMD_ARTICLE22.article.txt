# For the record

Due to an editing error, a letter yester
day about a Daily editorial on disabled
access included the sentence: "Can Stan
ford really afford to have a group of its stu
dents feeling alienated and isolated and
believing itself denied equal opportunity to
a Stanford education?" The sentence
should simply have read: "Can Stanford
really aflord to have a group of its students
feeling alienated, isolated and denied equal
opportunity to a Stanford education?"
