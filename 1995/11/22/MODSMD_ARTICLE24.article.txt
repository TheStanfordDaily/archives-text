## On the juice — to spritz or not to spritz? 
### 
What is substituted Isometimes] for
the sexual object is some part of the body
(such as the foot or the hair) which is in
general very inappropriate for sexual
purposes.
— Freud, The Sexual Aberrations
My mom just sent me a three
month supply of Rogaine. A* a
surprise, she called up the phar
macist, placed a "Happy Hanukkah"
order and sent it two-day mail.
The Fed Ex arrived just yesterday.
There was hair growing on the box.
Inside sat three bottles of patented hair
juice guaranteed to give you a 26 percent
chance at moderate-to-dense regrowth.
Food for the follicles. A bagel for my
locks. Spritz-on steroids for the ego.
Without my asking, my mother had
offered up the impossible dream: copious
cool hair. Masculinity restored. Bangs.
All the things I'd given up hoping for
years ago wait to be applied like a high
schooler's method of birth control, just
spray and pray.
And now I'm torn between what I
should want and what 1 do want.
Between my vanity and idealism.
Between giving over to the western
esthetic and giving in to my forehead.
You see — I'm losing my hair. I havt

been since high school. (Actually, I
haven't really lost any hair. 1 know
exactly where it is. I keep it all in a
shoe box.) You can't tell from that little
picture up there to the right, but it's
very, very true: Where I used to have a
whole mess of cute blond stuff going,
there now stretches a barren plain of
dermis.
Generally, I'm OK with all this. I've
got hats and self-esteem and a full
understanding of women's attraction to
the stately, balding-gentleman look.
But every so o.Hten something will hap
pen that makes me self-conscious about
my status as a follicularly challenged
young male — a lingering glance, a sharp
rebuff, a child's scream when I remove
my cap. Most recently, it was my mom.
"You're bald," she reminded me in her
sweet, motherly way. "Why not try the
stuff and see if you look better?"
"What, I don't look good enough
now?" I asked her.
"Sure you do," she cooed. "To me
you're a darling beautiful boy. Use the
stuff and you'll be a darling beautiful boy
to everyone else, too."
She was offering me a way out of the
no-win situation that puberty pushed on
me. Overcompensation for mediocre gene
selection? Sure, but sweet nonetheless.

All this talk of potential reforestation
reminded me of when I first realized just
how bad the male-pattern situation was
getting. . .
I remember that time well. It was a
mess. Scarcely 18, I was being held
hostage by my hair. The coiffure contra
had me by my manhood. In a panic, I
called for emergency peace talks with the
remaining follicles.
I thanked them for coming.
"What are your demands?" I asked.
They spoke angrily. "We want sen
tience. Give in or we jump ship. No
combs, no brushes, no deals. We run the
show, we do what we want — capisci?"
"I see."
"In return, some of us might consider
sticking around. No guarantees."
And then, as if to dare me to call their
bluff, two pretty, blond strands tore
themselves from their plots and hurled
themselves out from my head.
Yes, it was clear I was dealing with
zealots — furry freedom fighters,
Kamikaze keratin. I had no recourse but
to defer to some less-than-trustworthy
allies.
I turned to my body hair.
"Can you do something?" I pleaded.
"Don't even bother — it's not our ter
ritory."

"Isn't there anything you can do?"
"We can take the neck."
"I'd rather you didn't."
"Too late, we've already got the per
mits. We're hittin' the back too."
"Damn unions."
So there I was, a senior in high school
with the hairline of a 35-year-old systems
analyst with two kids, a Discover card
and lumbar pain.
My dreams of sporting long and flow
ing hair — like Hamlet on the cover of
my Signet Classics edition — were slowly
falling out of my mind and into my comb.
It became embarrassingly apparent that
I would never be the confused Danish
Adonis that he was.
Instead, with every turn of the brush,
with each strike of the comb, some
underhanded androgen artifice was mak
ing me less of a man, with buds of back
hair to boot.
Thus was I led to my dilemma:
To be hirsute.
To spritz or not to spritz.
The bucks are paid; the bets are in.
Should I choose to play, I've got a one-in
four chance of winning the grand prize of
an estrogen-carbonating flurry of folli
cles.
Yet I still feel I should be strong
enough to say a definitive no to drugs, to

leave my body to it's own design and let
the buggers fall when and where they
will.
After all, wouldn't this be just anoth
er informal concession to our superficial
ity, to our beauty-myth world? The
western esthetic mandates that Cindy
Crawford won't rub my tummy unless
I've got a full-blown blowdryable bouf
fant. Shouldn't I venture to change her
mind and not my head? Can't I bear the
proud mane's contumely?
Am I acting like a gawky 15-year-old
girl who looks through bra catalogues
and thinks herself unworthy of the air
she breathes because she doesn't pack a
Victoria's Secret Ashley demi-bra quite
as well as Stephanie Seymore?
I know that there exists a small con
tingency of women who dig the balding,
Picardish / distinguished schtick. On
the other hand, if I refuse new hair on
philosophical grounds, don't I make
myself forever reliant on some Electra
like deviance to assure any attraction?
So I haven't decided what to do quite
yet. The stuff in the bottle offers empow
erment with one spray, submission with
another, and no assurances either way.
Perchance my hair will flourish; per
chance it will die.
Perchance to dream.
