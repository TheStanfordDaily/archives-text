# Grants fund prostate studies

This year, more that 400,000
men will be diagnosed with
prostate cancer, the second lead
ing cause of death among males
in America. But two Stanford
Medical Center researchers,
Donna Peehl and Alice Whitte
more, are currently conducting
groundbreaking studies on
prostate cancer in hopes of
understanding the disease and
finding a cure.
CaP Cure (the Association for
the Cure of Cancer of the
Prostate), has awarded Peehl, a
urology resident, a $100,000
grant to continue her research in
the area of prostate cancer this
year. Her proposal was one of
only 62 which were funded from
among more than 500 proposals.
CaP Cure was founded in
1993 to raise awareness and
increase private and public sup

port for prostate cancer research.
The disease, which affects the
male fertility gland, commonly
goes undetected.
"It tends to grow very slowly,"
said Peehl, "It can take many
years before physical problems
start to show up. Therefore, it is
quite easy to overlook."
As a start to understanding
this deadly disease, Peehl is con
ducting prostate screening stud
ies. Focusing on the molecular
and cellular basis of the cancer,
she said she hopes to find the
markers that distinguish
between normal and cancerous
cells.
Whittemore, a professor of
health and research policy, is
taking a somewhat different
approach to prostate cancer
research. Her research team
hopes to find hereditary causes
for the disease and is currently
seeking out study subjects whose

families have developed three or
more cases of prostate cancer.
According to Ingrid Oakley-
Girvan, the study director of
Whittemore's project, "There is
an inordinately high rate of
prostate cancer in African-Amer
ican males in comparison to Cau
casians, and Caucasians develop
the disease even more than
Asians."
The group looks at how DNA
may be interacting with dietary
factors to produce these differ
ences. Whittemore's team is
looking to the possibility that
changing a man's meals could
lead to a reduction in the proba
bility of contracting prostate can
cer.
American males ever the age
of 50 are at the greatest risk and
should go in for exams at least
once a year, Peehl said, adding
that the best early detection tests
are rectal exams and blood tests.
