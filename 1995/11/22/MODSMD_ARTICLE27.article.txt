## Activated genes hold promise for disease diagnosis 
### Wai Fung Kwok 
Stanford researchers have developed a new technique
that can be used to detect the expression levels of thou
sands of genes at once. The technique holds promise for
clinical diagnosis, such as tracking cancer genes.
This innovation began three years ago with the
research work of graduate student Dari Shalon, who was
studying systemic problems of arraying DNA.
"In the last six months, with better technology, we real
ized the implications of this research," said Dr. Patrick O.
Brown, a Howard Medical Institute assistant investigator.
Also involved in the project were postdoctoral fellow Mark
Schena and Biochemistry Prof. Ronald Davis.
Here's a little on how the technique works. When a
gene is expressed or "turned on," the cell springs into
action to produce the specific protein encoded by that
gene. This synthesis requires messenger RNA (mRNA) —
the molecules that carry the building instructions from
each "turned on" gene.
The amount of a particular mRNA in a cell is directly
correlated with the expression level of a gene. Brown's
technique measures the levels of mRNA in each cell.
"The advantage of the new method is that it allows us
to look at a large collection of genes at once," said Brown.
Using the older northern blot, several days are needed to
determine the expression level of just a single gene.
With the new method, however, researchers can obtain
expression levels for more than a thousand genes within
the same period of time.
According to Brown, "This technique will allow
researchers to gather information about the genes biolo
gy much more rapidly than with the traditional method.
The key behind the speediness of the new technique is

a robot designed by Shalon. The robot imprints small
glass slides with arrays of up to 20,000 precisely placed
microscopic dots of DNA samples. Each dot carries a par
ticular gene's known DNA sequence.
The array is then washed with a fluorescently labeled
mixture of the mRNA of the cells under investigation.
This allows the researchers to measure which genes are
being expressed and at what level — the brighter the dot
of DNA, the higher the expression level of the gene.
So, what is the relevance of all this?
"The new technique can be applied to a lot of prob
lems. There are many situations which require us to
know specific patterns of how genes are expressed. This
method can be used to look for genes whose expressions
change in response to certain conditions," suggests
Brown.
One of the main uses of the new technique is clinical
diagnosis. Various physiological and pathological condi
tions might lead to characteristic changes in patterns of
gene expression in blood cells or other tissues. These
blood cells or tissues can serve as sensitive sensors for
disease diagnosis. For example, changes in gene expres
sion levels of white blood cells, a crucial part of our
defense system, can be detected using this new method.
"White blood cells circulate through our bodies with
little 'antennas' out, asking, 'How's everything going out
there? Should we be kicking into gear to deal with a
potentially threatening situation?' They have a sensing
system that allows them to react to pathological condi
tions and what they sense is reflected in gene expression.
If we can figure out how these changes in gene expression
reflect the body's condition, we could use white blood
cells as little spies wandering through the body and
reporting back to us," said Brown.
