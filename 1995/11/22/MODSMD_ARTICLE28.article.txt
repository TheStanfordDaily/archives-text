# Invasion of the strait-laced ants

QHow do ants always travel in real
• ly straight paths?
AHmmm. This is one question that I
• pondered recently as I was perusing
• endless piles o' scientific journals.
After thousands of hours of investigation
and several days of watching ants in my
own backyard — not only must I have
looked really strange, I also have this horri
ble kink in my back — I have come up with
a fairly simple explanation.
First of all, ants don't really travel in
long straight lines, they only seem to
because humans are so much bigger than
they are. It's one of those reality doesn't
really exist kind of things — it's simply a
figment of our collective imaginations. But I
am the Science Bug, and thus I am also the
messiah that must give some transient
meaning to your meaningless lives.
Here's the scoop. Think of it this way: If
you've ever been in an airplane and peered out
the window, a lot of the roads below seem pret
ty straight, when in actuality you know that
they're quite crooked. Your perspective is what
creates the illusion that the roads are straight.
Similarly with the ants, if you were as big
as a bug — like me, of course — and you
observed a train of ants passing by, it would

not be all that straight. All the tiny devia
tions in the trail would be magnified.
Now, we all know that this illusion is
only on a small scale and in fact ants do
travel in fairly straight paths. So how is this
possible?

I mean, they obviously don't all hold
hands while they crawl. Well, recent studies
have shown that ants, like many insects,
secrete chemicals called pheromones. These
pheromones are like ant perfumes. They
allow ants to sniff out each other and follow
along in line.

In a trail of several hundred or several
thousand ants, the pheromone trail can be
strong enough so that no ants get lost. Such
strong trails also permit two-way ant trails
— sort of like little ant highways.
But even pheromones don't tell the
whole story. If all the ants in a trail followed
the ant directly ahead of them, the trail
could still be winding. There must be some
thing else involved.
The famous physicist Richard Feyn man
postulated the following rather mechanical
explanation: the lead ant in a trail simply
takes a path from its location to the target
site — the cookie you dropped in the grass
yesterday, for example.
The second ant in the trail then "sees" the
ant in front and proceeds directly to it, thereby
cutting a few corners. The third ant then goes
directly to the second ant, cutting a few more
corners. Eventually, enough corners from the
first ant's path are cut so that the overall trail
straightens out. Although pheromones weren't
exactly what Feynman had in mind, they do
show how ants "see" each other.
So, the next time you are out walking
around and come across some of our 4
quadrillion ant friends in the world, you'll
know how they get around. Leave it to the
industrial masters of the insect world to
come up with an efficient system of travel
ing to lost cookies. They sniff each other out
and then take shortcuts. You humans
should try it sometime.
