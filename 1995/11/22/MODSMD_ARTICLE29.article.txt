# 'All we have access to is the conscious experience of the mind'
## Prof. Shepard plays the mind game 
### Nancy Farghalli Contributing writer 
Most Stanford students feel disgruntled

about completing distribution
requirements. For Roger Shepard,
the Ray Lyman Wilbur Professor
of Social Science, a D.R. proved
most influential. The course,
"Introduction to Modern Philoso

phy," has taken him on a journey spanning
45 years that he never envisioned.
"It was a salient moment in my intellec
tual career. I don't quite understand it in
retrospect, but I know that I was always
interested in mental phenomena such as
illusions. And yet, as a scientist, I tended to
assume that everything would be explained
in terms of physical properties," Shepard
said.
"We read the materialists such as

Hobbes. But then I was introduced
to Bishop Berkeley who said 'To be
is to be perceived.' This exposure
to Berkeley's idealism made me
realize that all we have access to is
the conscious experience of the

mind."
In a matter of moments, Shepard's mate
rial grounding opened up beneath him. He
began to feel that everything that people
posit about the nature of the material and
physical world is a construction based on
actual experience. "It was a startling expe
rience, and I have not been quite the same

since," Shepard said.
His goals of being an astro
physicist vanished. The residue of
his philosophy class created a
whole new interest for him — the
world of cognitive psychology.

In this realm, Shepard has become a
lauded revolutionary, changing the field

with his studies of mental rotation
and mental imagery.
For his work, Shepard earned
the National Medal of Science, an
accolade bestowed upon him by
President Clinton at the White

House Oct. 18.
The award reads, "For his creative theo

retical and experimental work elu
cidating how the human mind per
ceives and represents the physical
world and why the human mind
has evolved to represent objects as
it does; and for giving rigor and

purpose to the field of cognitive science and
demonstrating the value of bringing the
insights of many scientific disciplines to
bear in scientific problem solving."

Last year, Shepard deliv
ered the William James Lec
tures at Harvard University.
These lectures served as a
synopsis of his past research
and aided in the develop
ment of a new thesis.
"I was trying to develop
the thesis which has dominat
ed my work in recent years:
an idea that there may exist
general or even universal

mental principles that have evolved as adapta
tions to the universal features of the world. My
own research has convinced me that we inter

nalize something of the
geometry of three dimen
sional Euclidean space."
Shepard explained that
animal internalization of
circadian rhythms can

serve as a model of how humans internalize
other things of a cognitive nature.
"We tried to do something a little bit similar
to the way in which it was demonstrated that
animals internalized the circadian period of 24
hours.
It was not clear which signals animals use to
leave their burrow — whether they are exter
nal or internal," Shepard said.
"Researchers took hamsters and put
them in an artificial environment where
light and temperature were kept constant.
The animals continued to maintain a 24-
hour cycle in this environment. I can take
this as a model of how we have also inter
nalized things that are of a more cognitive
nature."
To test this hypothesis, Shepard devised
an exporiment called apparent motion. By
flashing one light in the right eye and

another in the left, he showed that people
perceive a single spot of light moving back
and forth instead of two lights turning on
and off.
He took this one step further by
researching how people perceive three
dimensional objects. "If you present an
object in space alternatively in two differ

ent positions, a person will see the
object moving rigidly back and
forth. More importantly, a person
will see the object moving over a
particular path.
This is evidence that there exists

a property of space that has been internal
ized in our nervous system all along," Shep

ard stated.
This internalized path of space
is the basis for Chasles theorem of
kinematic geometry — a branch of
geometry that studies the path of
objects. Chasles theorem posits

that objects will always move in an arching
path.
Scientists have only proven this geomet
ric fact in the past few years. Yet, the exper
iment shows that people have internalized
this aspect of kinematic geometry.
Shepard is perhaps best known for his
work in the area of mental rotation.
In this experiment, people were present
ed with pairs of perspective views of three
dimensional objects in different orienta
tions.
People were asked to decide whether the
two objects in each pair were identical
regardless of their orientation.
Shepard showed that the subjects "had

to imagine one object rotating into
congruence with the other object
and that they could only imagine
this rotation at a rate of no more
than 60 degrees per second."
With experiments using rotated

graphic images and moving lights, Shepard
has created a new science centering on the
perception of the physical world as our
minds perceive and alter reality.
The moral of this story is that, of cuurse,
those irritating distribution requirements
can do some good after all.
