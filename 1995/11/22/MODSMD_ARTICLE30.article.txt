# Medication hurts arthritis patients
## 
### Alison Davis Contributing writer 
One in a thousand arthritis
sufferers will die from serious
complications caused by drugs
they take regularly to combat
the painful symptoms of their
disease.
Non-steroidal anti-inflamma
tory drugs, or NSAIDs, are
among the most commonly used
drugs to treat rheumatoid
arthritis. Some examples of
NSAIDs have become household
names — such as Midol, Advil,
Alleve and even garden-variety
aspirin — although for arthritis,
these drugs are used at higher
doses than most people normally
take.
But their effectiveness comes
with a price. One percent of
patients taking NSAIDs develop
stomach ulcers, and one in 10 of
those will die from resulting
serious gastrointestinal (GI)
bleeding, said Dr. Gurkirpal
Singh of Stanford's Immunology
and Rheumatology division.
Singh directed an epidemio
logical study that followed about
2,000 arthritis patients taking
NSAIDs over a period of 2 1/2
years. He presented his findings
last month at the American Col
lege of Rheumatology meeting in
San Francisco.
According to the results of
Singh's study, "most people who
are going to have serious [Gl]
bleeding will not have symp
toms."
Many patients, partly in
response to hefty marketing
strategies, also take "stomach
soothing" antacids to offset
some of the side effects of
NSAIDs, including stomach
ache, nausea and heartburn.
Antacids do relieve these symp
toms, but they don't do anything
to heal the stomach damage.
"Antacids have no effect on
preventing bleeding," according
to Singh. The key message is
that relieving symptoms might
actually mask serious underly
ing GI complications.
In reality, only 10 to 15 per
cent of patients taking NSAIDs
will exhibit these symptoms. So
the real danger lies with the 85
to 90 percent of patients who are
asymptomatic — feeling no pain
from the NSAIDs they are tak
ing. This patient population is at
risk, but unknowingly so.
How can the needs of these
patients be best addressed?

NSAIDs vary widely in their
strength and severity of side
effects. Some of the safer ones
include Disalcid and Midol or Advil.
Others, such as indomethacin and
Orudis, exhibit some of the more
serious GI side effects.
A drug called misoprostol,
manufactured by Searle, is cur
rently the only available drug
which can actually reverse the
GI abuse inflicted by NSAIDs.
But it is also not without compli
cations. Misoprostol is highly
expensive, cannot be taken dur
ing pregnancy and can cause
irritating problems like diar
rhea.
The best strategy is "to watch
out for complications," Singh
said. NSAIDs can be used effec
tively, but in the lowest doses
possible. Furthermore, patients
especially at risk, such as the
elderly, should be closely moni
tored.
Singh's study is part of the
Arthritis, Rheumatology, Aging,
and Medical Information Sys
tems program, or ARAMIS.
Singh is Stanford's director of
the post-marketing surveillance
arm of ARAMIS.
The ARAMIS program is a fed
erally funded, 17-center collabo
rative project. Initiated 14 years
ago, it was designed to collect
information from 10,000 arthri
tis patients across the country —
from both academic hospitals and
private doctors' offices.
Programs like ARAMIS col
lect epidemiological data and
"study the natural history of the
disease in a non-interventional
way," Singh explained. He
emphasized that data from such
studies is a complement to, but
is not a substitute for, a con
trolled, randomized clinical trial.
Singh remarked that many
antacid-using arthritic patients
in the study were sick and elder
ly. Thus, they are more likely to
bleed to begin with — a poten
tially confounding variable.
"Statistical adjustments in
observational studies have their
limitations," Singh explained.
"That's why controlled clinical
trials are the best way to ascer
tain cause-and-effect relation
ships," he added.
"Controlled randomized trials
are akin to a laboratory experi
ment, whereas epidemiological
studies are real life," Singh said.
"Trials let us know if something
can work, but epidemiology tells
us if it does work," he said.

lect epidemiological data and
"study the natural history of the
disease in a non-interventional
way," Singh explained. He
emphasized that data from such
studies is a complement to, but
is not a substitute for, a con
trolled, randomized clinical trial.
Singh remarked that many
antacid-using arthritic patients
in the study were sick and elder
ly. Thus, they are more likely to
bleed to begin with — a poten
tially confounding variable.
"Statistical adjustments in
observational studies have their
limitations," Singh explained.
"That's why controlled clinical
trials are the best way to ascer
tain cause-and-effect relation
ships," he added.
"Controlled randomized trials
are akin to a laboratory experi
ment, whereas epidemiological
studies are real life," Singh said.
"Trials let us know if something
can work, but epidemiology tells
us if it does work," he said.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — NSAIDs — used by
patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis cause stomach ulcers
in 1 percent of users. More seriously, one in 10 of those will die from
resulting serious gastrointestinal (Gl) bleeding.
