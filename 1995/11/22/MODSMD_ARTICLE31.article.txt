## Hoops set to start with Fry's Invite Men face Stetson in first game of season-opening invitational 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
For a team supposedly on the
cusp of its greatest season ever,
the Stanford men's basketball
team is off to a very inauspicious
start.
Not only has a lackluster per
formance last Tuesday against
the Mexican National Team
raised the ire of head coach Mike
Montgomery, but now nagging
injuries have clouded the outlook
for the No. 18 Cardinal.
Senior forward Andy Poppink,
already nursing a sprained ankle,
has complained of back pains and
has sat out several practices.
.Junior point guard Brevin Knight
has also sat himself down during
practice because of shin pain.
Similar difficulties kept Knight
out of most practices last year.
Facing five games over a nine
day span starting Friday night
with the opening round of the
Fry's Invitational, there will be
little rest for Poppink and Knight.
Stanford faces Stetson Friday
night at Maples Pavilion and then
either Rice or Yale Saturday
night.
"Poppink has practiced this
week, hut you really have to
watch it when a back is involved,"
Montgomery said. "As for Brevin,
I don't know if it's something that
will ever right itself. It's more of a
tissue problem rather than a bone
problem right now."
Last year, Knight played most
of the year with a "hot spot" in
his shin — the precursor to a
stress fracture. Although the
fracture never materialized fully,

it limited his practice time and
effectiveness on the court. Like
last year, Knight has started
wearing an inflatable splint to
help redistribute the stress in his
leg.
So far, Knight has yet to miss
any real practice time this year,
and according to Montgomery,
the only gauge will be the pain
that Knight feels.
"Obviously, as soon as there is
pain, you have to back off," Mont
gomery said. "Brevin doesn't real
ly like the air splints, but he
wears them because he knows the
danger of losing an entire sea
son."
Turning his attention to this
weekend's action, Montgomery
hopes to see a return to the inten
sity his team showed last year.
Rather than trying to work every
one into the game like he did last
Tuesday, Montgomery will return
to his regular substitution pat
tern and try to ignite the transi
tion game with tough defense.
According to senior guard
David Harbour, the team didn't
look at the game against the Mex
ican National Team as a real test.
"A lot of the veterans really
couldn't get into that game," lie
said.
For Montgomery, the next
week-and-a-half is critical for the
team in terms of developing the
mental toughness to keep Stanford
going for the next four months.
"The key will be to get to the
point where we understand what
makes us good," he said. "Last
year, it was plaving hard, dis
