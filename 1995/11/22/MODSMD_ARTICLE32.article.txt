# Women hoopsters open versus UMass
## 
### Bobby Cuza Contributing writer 
They hung tough against the
U.S. National Team for an
entire half of play and routed a
Romanian team by 33 points.
Now the Stanford women's
hoopsters will see how they
match up domestically when
they open the regular season
this weekend with games at
Massachusetts on Friday and
Providence on Sunday.
The eighth-ranked Cardinal
hopes to pick up right where it
left off last season, a year high
lighted by a Final Four finish
and the team's fourth Pacific 10
Conference championship in
five years. Despite the loss of
three starters to graduation and
the temporary departure of
head coach Tara VanDerveer
(who officially assumed head
coaching duties for the U.S.
National Team Oct. 1), Stan
ford remains solid with the
return of 11 players from a
squad that finished 30-3 in
1994-95.
"1 think the expectations are
very high for this team, and a
lot of that is self-induced by [the
players] and by the coaching
staff," said interim co-head
coach Amy Tucker. "Obviously,
when you're ranked in the top
10 nationally, you're expected
to do very well, whoever you're
playing or wherever you're
playing."
Tucker, along with co-head

coach Marianne Stanley — for
merly of Old Dominion, Penn
sylvania and USC — will try to
uphold the standard of excel
lence that has come to charac
terize Stanford women's bas
ketball since Tara VanDerveer
took over the reigns of the pro
gram 10 years ago.
The Cardinal's starting line
up, though uncertain before the
year started, has begun to Lake
shape in the preseason. Junior
Jamila Wideman — last year's
starting point guard — and
senior Bobbie Kelsey will make
up the backcourt. Sophomores
Olympia Scott and Vanessa
Nygaard will combine with 6-
foot-2 junior forward Kate Star
bird, last year's leading scorer
and an All-America candidate,
to form the starting front line.
"Nothing is certain at this
point," Tucker said. "Even
though we've started the same
lineup twice, we're leaving
things open for practices so peo
ple can compete for spots. But
right now, these are the five
that deserve to be starting."
That starting five almost
out-performed the U.S. Nation
al Team for 20 minutes when
the two squads met. Nov. 10.
The Cardinal jumped out to a
17-8 lead against the U.S. and
trailed bv only six at the half
before eventually succumbing
by a 100-63 margin. Against
Romania's Otelul Universitatea
