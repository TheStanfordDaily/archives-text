# Women hoopsters open versus UMass
## 
### Bobby Cuza Contributing writer 
They hung tough against the
U.S. National Team for an
entire half of play and routed a
Romanian team by 33 points.
Now the Stanford women's
hoopsters will see how they
match up domestically when
they open the regular season
this weekend with games at
Massachusetts on Friday and
Providence on Sunday.
The eighth-ranked Cardinal
hopes to pick up right where it
left off last season, a year high
lighted by a Final Four finish
and the team's fourth Pacific 10
Conference championship in
five years. Despite the loss of
three starters to graduation and
the temporary departure of
head coach Tara VanDerveer
(who officially assumed head
coaching duties for the U.S.
National Team Oct. 1), Stan
ford remains solid with the
return of 11 players from a
squad that finished 30-3 in
1994-95.
"1 think the expectations are
very high for this team, and a
lot of that is self-induced by [the
players] and by the coaching
staff," said interim co-head
coach Amy Tucker. "Obviously,
when you're ranked in the top
10 nationally, you're expected
to do very well, whoever you're
playing or wherever you're
playing."
Tucker, along with co-head

coach Marianne Stanley — for
merly of Old Dominion, Penn
sylvania and USC — will try to
uphold the standard of excel
lence that has come to charac
terize Stanford women's bas
ketball since Tara VanDerveer
took over the reigns of the pro
gram 10 years ago.
The Cardinal's starting line
up, though uncertain before the
year started, has begun to Lake
shape in the preseason. Junior
Jamila Wideman — last year's
starting point guard — and
senior Bobbie Kelsey will make
up the backcourt. Sophomores
Olympia Scott and Vanessa
Nygaard will combine with 6-
foot-2 junior forward Kate Star
bird, last year's leading scorer
and an All-America candidate,
to form the starting front line.
"Nothing is certain at this
point," Tucker said. "Even
though we've started the same
lineup twice, we're leaving
things open for practices so peo
ple can compete for spots. But
right now, these are the five
that deserve to be starting."
That starting five almost
out-performed the U.S. Nation
al Team for 20 minutes when
the two squads met. Nov. 10.
The Cardinal jumped out to a
17-8 lead against the U.S. and
trailed bv only six at the half
before eventually succumbing
by a 100-63 margin. Against
Romania's Otelul Universitatea
last Thursday, the women took a
commanding 19-point halftime
lead and eventually won 90-57.
"We had a great first half
against the national team. I
thought we were very poised and
ran our offense very well — we
took care of the ball," Tucker
said. "Against the Romanian
team, they kind of slowed it down
a little bit on us, but we were still
able to execute our offense and
work on some different things."
Friday, the Cardinal must face
the challenge of a UMass team
that returns all five starters from
last year's 19-11 squad and is
forecast to win the Eastern Divi
sion of the Atlantic 10 Confer
ence. The Minutemen are 0-1
after losing their season opener
70-56 to Maine in the Women's
Preseason NIT.
Providence, meanwhile, fin
ished 10-21 last season alter four
of its starters went down with

injuries. But with every player
returning from a year ago, the
Lady Friars have their eyes on
the Big East championship.
"Both of those teams are each
picked either one or two in their
conference," Tucker said. "I
would expect that we will see a lot
of zone. They will have trouble
matching up with our big players
inside, so we just need to be real
ly patient and execute against a
zone. I think our team is more
comfortable right now against a
man (defense), so that will be a
challenge for us."
After this weekend's contests,
the women will return to the Farm
for four consecutive home games.
They don't leave again until Dec.
28, when they travel to Texas
Tech. But starting the season on
the road isn't an ideal situation.
"Obviously, you'd like to get
started at home and have your
crowd behind you, but this is a
good test for us to open up,"
Tucker said. "We have 11 return
ers, so that should bring some
experience to the squad. I think
they'll be ready to play."

17-8 lead against the U.S. and
trailed bv only six at the half
before eventually succumbing
by a 100-63 margin. Against
Romania's Otelul Universitatea
last Thursday, the women took a
commanding 19-point halftime
lead and eventually won 90-57.
"We had a great first half
against the national team. I
thought we were very poised and
ran our offense very well — we
took care of the ball," Tucker
said. "Against the Romanian
team, they kind of slowed it down
a little bit on us, but we were still
able to execute our offense and
work on some different things."
Friday, the Cardinal must face
the challenge of a UMass team
that returns all five starters from
last year's 19-11 squad and is
forecast to win the Eastern Divi
sion of the Atlantic 10 Confer
ence. The Minutemen are 0-1
after losing their season opener
70-56 to Maine in the Women's
Preseason NIT.
Providence, meanwhile, fin
ished 10-21 last season alter four
of its starters went down with

injuries. But with every player
returning from a year ago, the
Lady Friars have their eyes on
the Big East championship.
"Both of those teams are each
picked either one or two in their
conference," Tucker said. "I
would expect that we will see a lot
of zone. They will have trouble
matching up with our big players
inside, so we just need to be real
ly patient and execute against a
zone. I think our team is more
comfortable right now against a
man (defense), so that will be a
challenge for us."
After this weekend's contests,
the women will return to the Farm
for four consecutive home games.
They don't leave again until Dec.
28, when they travel to Texas
Tech. But starting the season on
the road isn't an ideal situation.
"Obviously, you'd like to get
started at home and have your
crowd behind you, but this is a
good test for us to open up,"
Tucker said. "We have 11 return
ers, so that should bring some
experience to the squad. I think
they'll be ready to play."
