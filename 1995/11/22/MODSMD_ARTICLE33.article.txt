# MPSF Tourney do-or-die for polo
## 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
At some time in any athletic season,
there comes a point when a team or
individual has to put all the hours of
practice and hard work on the line.
Such situations are the crucible where
in champions are created, when those
with the greatest desire to win rise a
notch above the competition.
The Stanford men's water polo team
finds itself standing at such a juncture
as it prepares for this weekend's Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation Tourney,
which will tale place at Newport Harbor
High School in Southern California.
The three-day event will decide the
league champion as well as establish
which two teams from the MPSF will
gain a berth in the NCAA champi
onships. For the Cardinal (15-9, 3-5
MPSF), the only possibility for postsea
son play lies in capturing the confer
ence crown.
"We are going to be treating this
tournament as though it were the
national championship," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti. "And for all
intents and purposes, it is. If we can't
win the conference tournament, there
will be no NCAA tournament for us."
Standing in the way of the Cardinal

are eight teams that are looking not
only to secure a bid of their own, but
also earn the prestige of being the
squad that derails Stanford from its
quest to win its third consecutive
national championship.
What makes the tournament even
more exciting is the fact that the MPSF
boasts the top seven teams in the
nation, as well as the ninth- and 13th
ranked squads. In the past 27 years,
every national champion for water polo
has emerged from the ranks of the
MPSF. The difference this season is
that eight of the teams in the confer
ence are lighting for one of the four
spots in the NCAA championships, as
opposed to five or six in previous years.
The Trojans of USC are the only team
in the conference relatively assured of a
spot in the NCAAs because they have
suffered the fewest losses in the nation.
The Cardinal will first square off
against UC-Santa Barbara (7-16, 1-7)
at 9:30 Friday morning. The game is
actually part of a four-team playoff
between the sixth- through ninth
ranked teams in the conference. One
team will be eliminated, allowing for
the eight-team tournament format.
While ideally the game against the
Gauchos would be something of a for
mality, there is no guarantee of what

will transpire, or which Cardinal team
will show up. In its first game of the
season, Stanford struggled with the
Gauchos before winning by a goal.
Later in the year at the Air Force Tour
nament, the Cardinal rolled over the
same team bv a score of 1(5-12. For a
head coach, a game against a supposed
ly inferior squad can be a nightmare.
"We shouldn't have any trouble with
them," Dettamanti said. "But they are
going to be psyched. This is their last
chance, just like it is our last chance.
They have nothing to lose, and the pres
sure is on us to win. We also have to be
thinking a little bit about the game
later in the day. We don't want to have
to get into a dogfight in the first game
where we have to keep our starters in
the entire game. The first game in a
tournament is always the toughest."
Should the Cardinal live up to its
potential, it will advance in the tourna
ment as the seventh seed, setting the
stage for a matchup with second-seeded
UC-Irvine. A loss to the Gauchos would
be disastrous, as it would require Stan
ford to survive another playoff game for
the eighth spot in the tourney. The
team that captures the final spot in the
tourney will be rewarded by being
