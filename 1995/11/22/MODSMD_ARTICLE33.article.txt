# MPSF Tourney do-or-die for polo
## 
### Paul Barr Contributing writer 
At some time in any athletic season,
there comes a point when a team or
individual has to put all the hours of
practice and hard work on the line.
Such situations are the crucible where
in champions are created, when those
with the greatest desire to win rise a
notch above the competition.
The Stanford men's water polo team
finds itself standing at such a juncture
as it prepares for this weekend's Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation Tourney,
which will tale place at Newport Harbor
High School in Southern California.
The three-day event will decide the
league champion as well as establish
which two teams from the MPSF will
gain a berth in the NCAA champi
onships. For the Cardinal (15-9, 3-5
MPSF), the only possibility for postsea
son play lies in capturing the confer
ence crown.
"We are going to be treating this
tournament as though it were the
national championship," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti. "And for all
intents and purposes, it is. If we can't
win the conference tournament, there
will be no NCAA tournament for us."
Standing in the way of the Cardinal

are eight teams that are looking not
only to secure a bid of their own, but
also earn the prestige of being the
squad that derails Stanford from its
quest to win its third consecutive
national championship.
What makes the tournament even
more exciting is the fact that the MPSF
boasts the top seven teams in the
nation, as well as the ninth- and 13th
ranked squads. In the past 27 years,
every national champion for water polo
has emerged from the ranks of the
MPSF. The difference this season is
that eight of the teams in the confer
ence are lighting for one of the four
spots in the NCAA championships, as
opposed to five or six in previous years.
The Trojans of USC are the only team
in the conference relatively assured of a
spot in the NCAAs because they have
suffered the fewest losses in the nation.
The Cardinal will first square off
against UC-Santa Barbara (7-16, 1-7)
at 9:30 Friday morning. The game is
actually part of a four-team playoff
between the sixth- through ninth
ranked teams in the conference. One
team will be eliminated, allowing for
the eight-team tournament format.
While ideally the game against the
Gauchos would be something of a for
mality, there is no guarantee of what

will transpire, or which Cardinal team
will show up. In its first game of the
season, Stanford struggled with the
Gauchos before winning by a goal.
Later in the year at the Air Force Tour
nament, the Cardinal rolled over the
same team bv a score of 1(5-12. For a
head coach, a game against a supposed
ly inferior squad can be a nightmare.
"We shouldn't have any trouble with
them," Dettamanti said. "But they are
going to be psyched. This is their last
chance, just like it is our last chance.
They have nothing to lose, and the pres
sure is on us to win. We also have to be
thinking a little bit about the game
later in the day. We don't want to have
to get into a dogfight in the first game
where we have to keep our starters in
the entire game. The first game in a
tournament is always the toughest."
Should the Cardinal live up to its
potential, it will advance in the tourna
ment as the seventh seed, setting the
stage for a matchup with second-seeded
UC-Irvine. A loss to the Gauchos would
be disastrous, as it would require Stan
ford to survive another playoff game for
the eighth spot in the tourney. The
team that captures the final spot in the
tourney will be rewarded by being
forced to play its third game of the
day against top-seeded UCLA, the
No. 1 team in the nation.
Once the Cardinal enters the
tournament proper, there will he
no room for error. A single loss
relegates a team to the losers
bracket and shatters any possibil
ity for a championship bid.
After the game against UC-
Irvine, the matchups become
entirely theoretical. If one were to
play the percentages, a victory
over the Anteaters would mean
that the Cardinal would face off
against California. Hut, as the
season demonstrated, nothing
can be taken for granted when
teams from within the MPSF play
each other.
The Trojans serve as perhaps
the best illustration of the parity
in the league. With only four loss
es on the season, they are the sec
ond-ranked team in the nation,
but with three losses in league
play, USC is the fourth seed in

the conference tourney.
Ultimately though, it doesn't
much matter whom the Cardinal
must face. Eight of the top 10
teams in the country will be bat
tling it out in what promises to be
one of the fiercest league tourna
ments in recent memory.
"This is going to be an intense,
hard-fought tournament," Detta
manti said. "It is going to be a real
dogfight. I know it is something of
a cliche, but I think that what it
will come down to will be who
wants it the most is going to win
the tournament."
For the Cardinal then, it will
be important to concentrate on its
own game. In particular, Detta
manti's players must continue to
play the tough defense that has
proven instrumental in the
team's recent resurgence. Detta
manti plans to vary the style of
the defense over the course of the
tournament, throwing several dif
ferent alignments against the
squad's opposition to keep teams
guessing. The key to defense, in
Dettamanti's mind, is changing
things around.
In addition, the team must

continue to execute offensively.
In particular, the squad must
concentrate on its shooting, an
area that has been something of a
bugaboo for much of the season.
The Cardinal does not want to get
in too many shoot-outs.
"I really feel that if we keep the
score down, we have a good
chance of winning every game,"
Dettamanti said. "If the score
starts getting too high though, it
makes it much more difficult for
us. We haven't shown that we
have had the ability to consistent
ly score a lot of goals."
Consistency will be another
key. A team must emerge victori
ous in anywhere from three to
five games in order to secure the
league championship. And while
the best teams will likely rise to
the top, a single poor quarter
could cost a squad a match.
"We are going to have to play
consistently," Dettamanti said.
"The guys are going to have to
play with intensity, but they have
to stay collected at the same time.
We can't afford a lot of mistakes
or letdowns."
While playing solidly should

not be difficult for the defending
national champion, Dettamanti's
squad has had its highs and lows.
For much of this season, Stanford
could not string together a com
plete game, let alone remain con
sistent throughout a series of
games.
Thus, the league tournament
will serve as the ultimate testing
ground for the Cardinal, a team
that held high expectations in the
preseaso, but has suffered a num
ber of setbacks during the year.
The Cardinal must perform con
sistently in 16 consecutive quar
ters to earn the conference title
and a spot in the NCAA tourna
ment.
"We are at that point now
where it's do or die," Dettamanti
said. "It's all very simple — we
have to win four games in a row.
There is no guesswork involved
now. We have to win the MPSF to
advance to the NCAA tourna
ment.
"It is definitely not going to be
easy, but I think that we have as
good a chance as any team. This
weekend, we are going to find out
exactly what we are made of."

At some time in any athletic season,
there comes a point when a team or
individual has to put all the hours of
practice and hard work on the line.
Such situations are the crucible where
in champions are created, when those
with the greatest desire to win rise a
notch above the competition.
The Stanford men's water polo team
finds itself standing at such a juncture
as it prepares for this weekend's Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation Tourney,
which will tale place at Newport Harbor
High School in Southern California.
The three-day event will decide the
league champion as well as establish
which two teams from the MPSF will
gain a berth in the NCAA champi
onships. For the Cardinal (15-9, 3-5
MPSF), the only possibility for postsea
son play lies in capturing the confer
ence crown.
"We are going to be treating this
tournament as though it were the
national championship," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti. "And for all
intents and purposes, it is. If we can't
win the conference tournament, there
will be no NCAA tournament for us."
Standing in the way of the Cardinal

are eight teams that are looking not
only to secure a bid of their own, but
also earn the prestige of being the
squad that derails Stanford from its
quest to win its third consecutive
national championship.
What makes the tournament even
more exciting is the fact that the MPSF
boasts the top seven teams in the
nation, as well as the ninth- and 13th
ranked squads. In the past 27 years,
every national champion for water polo
has emerged from the ranks of the
MPSF. The difference this season is
that eight of the teams in the confer
ence are lighting for one of the four
spots in the NCAA championships, as
opposed to five or six in previous years.
The Trojans of USC are the only team
in the conference relatively assured of a
spot in the NCAAs because they have
suffered the fewest losses in the nation.
The Cardinal will first square off
against UC-Santa Barbara (7-16, 1-7)
at 9:30 Friday morning. The game is
actually part of a four-team playoff
between the sixth- through ninth
ranked teams in the conference. One
team will be eliminated, allowing for
the eight-team tournament format.
While ideally the game against the
Gauchos would be something of a for
mality, there is no guarantee of what

will transpire, or which Cardinal team
will show up. In its first game of the
season, Stanford struggled with the
Gauchos before winning by a goal.
Later in the year at the Air Force Tour
nament, the Cardinal rolled over the
same team bv a score of 1(5-12. For a
head coach, a game against a supposed
ly inferior squad can be a nightmare.
"We shouldn't have any trouble with
them," Dettamanti said. "But they are
going to be psyched. This is their last
chance, just like it is our last chance.
They have nothing to lose, and the pres
sure is on us to win. We also have to be
thinking a little bit about the game
later in the day. We don't want to have
to get into a dogfight in the first game
where we have to keep our starters in
the entire game. The first game in a
tournament is always the toughest."
Should the Cardinal live up to its
potential, it will advance in the tourna
ment as the seventh seed, setting the
stage for a matchup with second-seeded
UC-Irvine. A loss to the Gauchos would
be disastrous, as it would require Stan
ford to survive another playoff game for
the eighth spot in the tourney. The
team that captures the final spot in the
tourney will be rewarded by being
forced to play its third game of the
day against top-seeded UCLA, the
No. 1 team in the nation.
Once the Cardinal enters the
tournament proper, there will he
no room for error. A single loss
relegates a team to the losers
bracket and shatters any possibil
ity for a championship bid.
After the game against UC-
Irvine, the matchups become
entirely theoretical. If one were to
play the percentages, a victory
over the Anteaters would mean
that the Cardinal would face off
against California. Hut, as the
season demonstrated, nothing
can be taken for granted when
teams from within the MPSF play
each other.
The Trojans serve as perhaps
the best illustration of the parity
in the league. With only four loss
es on the season, they are the sec
ond-ranked team in the nation,
but with three losses in league
play, USC is the fourth seed in

the conference tourney.
Ultimately though, it doesn't
much matter whom the Cardinal
must face. Eight of the top 10
teams in the country will be bat
tling it out in what promises to be
one of the fiercest league tourna
ments in recent memory.
"This is going to be an intense,
hard-fought tournament," Detta
manti said. "It is going to be a real
dogfight. I know it is something of
a cliche, but I think that what it
will come down to will be who
wants it the most is going to win
the tournament."
For the Cardinal then, it will
be important to concentrate on its
own game. In particular, Detta
manti's players must continue to
play the tough defense that has
proven instrumental in the
team's recent resurgence. Detta
manti plans to vary the style of
the defense over the course of the
tournament, throwing several dif
ferent alignments against the
squad's opposition to keep teams
guessing. The key to defense, in
Dettamanti's mind, is changing
things around.
In addition, the team must

continue to execute offensively.
In particular, the squad must
concentrate on its shooting, an
area that has been something of a
bugaboo for much of the season.
The Cardinal does not want to get
in too many shoot-outs.
"I really feel that if we keep the
score down, we have a good
chance of winning every game,"
Dettamanti said. "If the score
starts getting too high though, it
makes it much more difficult for
us. We haven't shown that we
have had the ability to consistent
ly score a lot of goals."
Consistency will be another
key. A team must emerge victori
ous in anywhere from three to
five games in order to secure the
league championship. And while
the best teams will likely rise to
the top, a single poor quarter
could cost a squad a match.
"We are going to have to play
consistently," Dettamanti said.
"The guys are going to have to
play with intensity, but they have
to stay collected at the same time.
We can't afford a lot of mistakes
or letdowns."
While playing solidly should

not be difficult for the defending
national champion, Dettamanti's
squad has had its highs and lows.
For much of this season, Stanford
could not string together a com
plete game, let alone remain con
sistent throughout a series of
games.
Thus, the league tournament
will serve as the ultimate testing
ground for the Cardinal, a team
that held high expectations in the
preseaso, but has suffered a num
ber of setbacks during the year.
The Cardinal must perform con
sistently in 16 consecutive quar
ters to earn the conference title
and a spot in the NCAA tourna
ment.
"We are at that point now
where it's do or die," Dettamanti
said. "It's all very simple — we
have to win four games in a row.
There is no guesswork involved
now. We have to win the MPSF to
advance to the NCAA tourna
ment.
"It is definitely not going to be
easy, but I think that we have as
good a chance as any team. This
weekend, we are going to find out
exactly what we are made of."
