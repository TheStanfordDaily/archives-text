On senior night at Maples
Pavilion, a couple of sophomores
showed the class of 1996 that the
seniors will leave the No. 3 Stan
ford women's volleyball team in
good hands.
Sophomore hitters Lisa Sharp
ley and Kristin Folkl led the Cardi
nal (26-2 overall, 18-0 Pacific 10
Conference) to its 23rd straight
victory last night, as Stanford
crushed USF 15-9, 15-5, 15-6.
Despite not playing in the first
game, Sharpley finished with six
kills in seven attempts for a hit
ting percentage of .857. Folkl was
equally impressive, registering
seven kills in nine attempts and
hitting .778. Neither player com
mitted a hitting error.
By game three, Stanford coach
Don Shaw was freely rotating his
players while losing little offen
sive punch in the process. As a
team, the Cardinal hit .404 on the
night, one of its highest hitting
percentages of the year.
