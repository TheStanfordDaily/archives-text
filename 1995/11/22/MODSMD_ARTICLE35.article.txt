On senior night at Maples
Pavilion, a couple of sophomores
showed the class of 1996 that the
seniors will leave the No. 3 Stan
ford women's volleyball team in
good hands.
Sophomore hitters Lisa Sharp
ley and Kristin Folkl led the Cardi
nal (26-2 overall, 18-0 Pacific 10
Conference) to its 23rd straight
victory last night, as Stanford
crushed USF 15-9, 15-5, 15-6.
Despite not playing in the first
game, Sharpley finished with six
kills in seven attempts for a hit
ting percentage of .857. Folkl was
equally impressive, registering
seven kills in nine attempts and
hitting .778. Neither player com
mitted a hitting error.
By game three, Stanford coach
Don Shaw was freely rotating his
players while losing little offen
sive punch in the process. As a
team, the Cardinal hit .404 on the
night, one of its highest hitting
percentages of the year.

Cardinal Cary Wendell was one of four seniors
playing their final regular-season home game.
"Offensively, we did okay,
said Stanford coach Don Shaw. "I
don't think we played as well as
we are capable of playing."
Showing the class that he has
exhibited throughout his coach
ing tenure at Stanford, Shaw
inserted all four of his seniors
into the starting lineup in their
final home regular-season match.
Outside hitter Mamie Triefen
bach led the Cardinal with eight
kills. She also hit .429, had three
digs and posted four service aces.
Setter / outside hitter Gary Wen
dell continued her dominating
season, hitting .333 for seven

kills to go with 34 assists. Wendy
Hromadka, who is having her
best season ever for Stanford, hit
.600 for six kills. She had six digs
and no hitting errors. Maureen
McClaren recorded five kills, hit
.400 and notched five digs.
When asked to comment on
his vaunted senior class, Shaw
merely hoped that their final sea
son won't end for at least another
month.
"Hopefully, they have five
more games to go," Shaw said.
"Our whole team should be reju
venated by the start of the tour
nament."
Although Stanford held the
Dons to a .139 hitting percentage,
Shaw criticized his team's lack of
effort on defense.
"1 was disappointed with our

defense. The intensity just
wasn't there. They hit .139, but
they only hit .125 on average this
year.
"After going up 8-0 (in game
one), we went flat. We picked it
up a little in game two, but we
didn't do much more than getting
the job done in game three."
Stanford actually held a 9-0
advantage in the opening game
before the Dons clawed back.
Aided by poor Stanford passing,
USF eventually scored nine
points before the Cardinal closed
out the game.
The Cardinal's passing woes
threatened to continue into game
two, as ball-handling errors cost
Stanford the first four points of
the game. From there, however,
the Cardinal kicked into high

gear, winning 15 of the next 16
points to take game.
"USF did a good job," Shaw
said. "They played hard. I think
they played better than our team
expected them to. We should
have ended this match a lot soon
er than we did."
With the victory, Stanford fin
ished its second consecutive
undefeated home season. On
Sunday, the Cardinal will find
out which region it will play in
when the NCAA tournament
begins Nov. 29.
"It's been a good season for
us," Shaw said. "Hopefully, it will
keep going in the tournament.
We'll have a few practice oppor
tunities after we find out where
we'll play, and then the second
season begins."
