The Stanford wrestling team, in its
own version of Big Game, defeated Bay
Area rival San Francisco State last night
in Burnham Pavilion. The final score was
26-19 in this close matchup.
Entering the contest, the Cardinal was
especially eager to win, since last year's
Gator team, which featured a lineup very
similar to this year's, dealt the Stanford
wrestlers a tough 19-16 loss. That
marked the first time that the Cardinal
lost to the Gators in a decade. The match
came down to the heavyweight matchup
between Stanford sophomore Mark
Neglay and SFS junior Phil Zimolzak.
Neglay lost.
Last night, Neglay and his teammates
found redemption. In a rematch, Neglay
defeated Zimolzak 3-1 in sudden death.
On the whole, the team was pleased with
the outing. "As far as the team goes, I was
very happy with our performance, "said
senior Matt Cano (126 pounds), who
defeated Gator Carlos Cumulong 12-7.
Freshman Frank Ruiz (118), senior co
captains Jimmy Aguirre (142) and Tod
Surmon (158), junior Ryan Barnes (150)
and sophomores Scott Chapman (177)
and Jason Gladden (190) also emerged
victorious.

Cardinal senior Sahlan Martin (167)
also pulled off a close victory, defeating
the Gators' David Crumpler 10-9. Sopho
more Robert Hatta put up a tough fight
but came up a bit short in the end with a
7-5 loss at the hands of SFS junior
Richard Gutierrez. Sophomore Jason
Gladden, wrestling at 190 in place of

As far as the team goes, I
was very happy with our
performance.'

injured teammate Bryan Vaniman, suf
fered a nail-biting 5-4 loss to SFS junior
Lee Lofton.
For the most part, Stanford wrestled up
to its potential. The Gator team was full of
experienced juniors who defeated these
same Cardinal grapplers just one year ago.
I he only two individual losses on the part
of the Cardinal this year were close defeats.
The only real improvement that now
needs to take place for Stanford is condi
tioning, and that will improve as the sea
son progresses. With the win, the Cardi
nal will have momentum going into the
Las Vegas Invitational, which will take
place Dec. 1-2.
