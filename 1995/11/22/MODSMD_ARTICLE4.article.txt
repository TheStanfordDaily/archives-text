# Stanford seeking minorities' input
## 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Contributing writer 
Because involved students are
mure likely to become involved
alumni, members of the Task Force
on Minority Alumni Relations be
lieve the opinions of current stu
dents to be as relevant as the opin
ions of graduates.
To that end, the task force is
planning to hold undergraduate
focus groups with minority stu
dents. The task force has sought
input in the past from telephone
surveys and alumni caucuses.
According to Charles Ogletree, a
Stanford trustee who is head of the
task force and a law professor at
Harvard, the task force hopes to
"carefully examine current stu
dents' perspectives" to make sure
that their experiences at Stanford
"are consistent with the goals of the
University."
Ogletree has participated in
alumni minority caucuses that con
vene throughout the country, hut
said he believes student input is im
portant in order to separate the cur
rent realities from alumni "memo
ries of 20 or 30 years ago."
The task force has arranged

focus groups in which students of a
part icular ethnicity gather to share
their thoughts. A focus group is
scheduled for Latino students on
Nov. 28.
"We want to sound them out as
to what they see as problems," Di
rector of University Communica
tions Terry Shepard said.
Focus groups have also been
planned for black and Asian stu
dents.
The focus groups, like the tele
phone surveys, are conducted by
professionals. This has been made
possible largely because of Jerold
Pearson, who was hired last year as
a financial and management ana
lyst in the Office of Development.
Pearson's expertise allows for
"more scientific" methods of re
search than those done in the past,
said Cecilia Evangelista, assistant
to the vice president for develop
ment and a member of the task
force.
The task force first gathered in
formally in the spring of 1994 be
cause of trustee interest in minori
ty attitudes, Evangelista said.
