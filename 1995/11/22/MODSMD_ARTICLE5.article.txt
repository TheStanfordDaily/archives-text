Stanford students overwhelmingly agree
with the University's official position on af
firmative action, according to an ASSU poll
conducted last week.
Pollsters asked 245 randomly selected
students three basic questions concerning

criminating or giving preferential treatment
on the basis of race, sex or ethnicity.
Though a large number of students ap

percent of students were not aware of the
UC Regents' decision this past summer to
ban affirmative action as a determinant in
the admissions process at UC schools.

Mike Choo, who helped organize the survey.
"We think it is important to raise aware

Eight pollsters, under the direction of a
designated pollster, conducted the poll dur-
