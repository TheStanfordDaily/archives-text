Stanford students overwhelmingly agree
with the University's official position on af
firmative action, according to an ASSU poll
conducted last week.
Pollsters asked 245 randomly selected
students three basic questions concerning
their views on the University's affirmative
action policy, the California Civil Rights Ini
tiative and the UC Regents' decision to end

affirmative action.
According to the poll, a large majority of
students — 89.4 percent — support Stan
ford's policies concerning affirmative ac
tion. University policy states that some ap
plicants have extenuating circumstances
and different cultural and economic back
grounds which are considered in admis
sions.
A slightly smaller majority — 78.8 per
cent — would not support the California

Civil Rights Initiative. This initiative, which
could appear on the 1996 ballot, woidd pre
vent local and state government from dis
criminating or giving preferential treatment
on the basis of race, sex or ethnicity.
Though a large number of students ap
parently support affirmative action, 19.6
percent of students were not aware of the
UC Regents' decision this past summer to
ban affirmative action as a determinant in
the admissions process at UC schools.

"Students are very busy and don't, al
ways have access to what's going on off cam
pus," said Council of Presidents member
Mike Choo, who helped organize the survey.
"We think it is important to raise aware
ness, because the decision could have an im
pact on private campuses in the future."
Eight pollsters, under the direction of a
designated pollster, conducted the poll dur-
ing two two-hour periods.
"We consulted with the Commu
nication Department and Statistics
Department. They helped make
sure our questions were clear, unbi
ased and not leading," explained
ASSU pollster Victoria Chan.

The Council of Presidents com
missioned the poll to gauge stu
dent opinion on the issue, as well
as student awareness. The ASSU
leadership plans to use the results
of the poll to reaffirm its position
on the issue and to start more
awareness programs.
"It is important to get student
feedback on what types of issues
the COP should deal with," Choo
said. "We also wanted to reaf

firm Stanford's own policies and
see how the political climate was
affecting the students."
The affirmative action poll had a
margin of error of less than 6 per
cent. The ASSU hired Chan as its
official pollster earlier this year and
plans to commission a poll about
once a month. Future topics may
include graduate student needs,
student health and wellness and
student services.
