dorm, Junipero, and have their lives challenged.
Find out what happens when the small talk ends and
people start getting real. The Real World, Stanford.
College is all about new friendships and personal
growth. It's about learning from mistakes and mak
ing lifetime memories. The seven members of the
Real World share their recent experiences on the
farm as freshmen . . .
"We were on our dorm scavenger hunt at Pier
39," Jean De La Torre recalls. "One of the items on
the list was to use a pick-up line on a stranger. No one
wanted to do it. When we were eating lunch, every
one told me to go pick up on this random guy who
was wiping the counter. So I did it. I went up to him

Freshman George Holbert, part of Stanford's Real World, is finding school harder than he thought it
would be.
and said, 'If I told you thut you had
a beautiful body, would you hold it
against me?' He was so stunned. It
was really embarrassing because
Kevin came running up with a
camera and took a picture of us."
Hefore coming to college from
her hometown of Vacaville, Calif.,
Jean seldom ventured far from her
secure circle of friends. Life in a
freshman dorm, however, has
given her courage to open up and
break away from her restrictive
home life.
"Jean is a bit conservative," said
Kevin Chen. "I know she's seen a
lot of things here that she hasn't
seen at home. Once she was in my
room and I had to change my
pants. So I said, 'Jean, I need to
drop my pants.' She turned around
quickly, I think she was shocked."
Though Kevin is still adjusting
to life apart from his twin brother,
he claims to have found close
friendships in the dorm, especially
with his roommate.
"Joe (Freund) and I both talk in
our sleep," Kevin said. "We seem to
say really weird things, too. We
hang out a lot, so maybe we're try
ing to communicate with each
other in our sleep or something."
However, even close friends,
while abiding in close quarters, are
sometimes forced to put up with
the other's idiosyncrasies.
"Joe always tries to get up early
and study, but it never happens,"
Kevin said. "He sets his alarm
clock for 7 a.m. It's not music
either, it's one of those really
annoying buzzes — the hist thing
you'd want to wake up to in the
morning. The thing is, it doesn't
even wake him up, but it wakes me
up. So every morning I have to roll
over and say, 'Turn the damn
thing off!' "
Apparently, Kevin isn't the per
fect roommate either.
"Whenever I'm trying to take a
nap, Kevin always seems to have
five or six people in the room with
him," Joe said. "But I can't com
plain because I always forget to
give him his messages."
According to Joe, most people
learn to get along with their room
mates. So far, he says that the year
has been going considerably well —

with academics, the student senate
... and various other activities.
"There was an incriminating
photo of me sitting in my room
printed on the front page of The
Daily," Joe began. "In the back
ground was a 'Welcome Stanford
Class of 1999' banner — this got
me into a little trouble. The next
day, someone from housing called
my [resident assistant | and basical
ly said that Kevin and I had two
choices — we could return the sign
by five o'clock or go to jail. So we
returned it."
Many consider the task of main
taining an organized room to be
one of the toughest challenges of
college. This is also true for Joe and
Kevin.
"A few of the girls from the
third floor got so sick of seeing our
room messy that they cleaned it for
us," Joe said. "Hut we couldn't
truly appreciate it because we
didn't do the work. It was messed
up within two days. So we cleaned
the room ourselves, once, and it
took four days to mess it up again.
The way I see it, you could spend
20 minutes a day cleaning your
room for the next two years, that's

240 hours. Or you could use that
time and become fluent in a lan
guage. I usually end up sleeping,
but the principle is there."
1 lowever, Joe believes that sym
pathy for his "lack of civilization"
(i.e. no sheets on his bed because
they're bundled up in the corner) is
the reason that Jean brings him
breakfast every morning.

"I figure we pay $5.75 for break
fast and I know that muffins don't
cost that much," Jean said. "So
why not get our money's worth?
And I guess I've always felt the
need to take care of people. I like to
feel needed."
Others who have met Jean
would agree.
"Jean seems like the mothering
type," said Tasha Dwamena. "She
always wants to help you."
In fact, Tasha found that most
people here are usually willing to
make the extra effort when she cel
ebrated her birthday recently.
"This past week has been pretty
amazing," she said. "My room
mate, in conjunction with my
mother and several other students,
went behind my back and got me a
card, which the dorm signed, and a
cake that were given to me during
our house meeting. I received tons
of messages on my door and I had
80 people singing happy birthday
to me. They were all sincerely
happy for me. These people, whom
I've only known for six weeks, went
out of their way to make me feel
special."
Though living in an all-frosh
environment creates a community
atmosphere, meeting people out
side of the dorm is often difficult.
Many participate in campus activi
ties in hopes of finding others with
common interests.
"I had a blast at the Gaieties
retreat," said Chandra Christen -
son. "I learned things about people
that I really didn't want to know.
We played 'I Never' and 'Truth or
Dare.' I had never played those
games before, at least not the way
they played them. Someone had to
lick someone else's belly button,
five people had to kiss at one time
and do other strange things like
that."
Chandra is taking her new col
lege experience in stride, the good
along with the bad.
"I was shocked when I got my
first [Cultures, Ideas and Values)
paper back," she admitted. "My
first reaction when I got it was,
'Holy shit!' which is very unusual
because I never swear. I guess I
just took a totally wrong approach.
And I've discovered that you can
think you know everything only to
find out that you hardly know any
thing."
Somehow, CIV tends to become
one of those unforgettable fresh

man memories for everyone.
"School is a lot harder than I
thought it would be," said George
llolbert. "The worst was when I
missed my first CIV midterm. I
thought it was at 7 p.m., but it was
really at 10 in the morning. I went
up to tliis guy in math and said,
'So, are you ready for the CIV
midterm tonight?' And he replied,
'Uh, we had it this morning.' I'm
not sure how I let that happen; I
was kind of a zombie all week
because I hadn't gotten much
sleep. My first reaction was the
dread of having to go up to the pro
fessor and say that I missed the
test by accident."
During the past few weeks,
George feels that he has gotten to
know his dormmates over dinners
and late night talks. But he's still
meeting new people every day.
"Chandra sort of strikes me as
the stereotypical blond," George
laughed. "I really don't know her

that well, but she has these
whacked-out comments. Her tone
of voice and the way she talks crack
me up."
Grant Brown, on the other
hand, feels as though he hasn't had
the opportunity to bond with the
dorm.
"I know George pretty well
since we're roommates," Grant
said. "But I feel like I'm never
around. I even get the impression
that others think that too. Most of
my close friends are on the soccer
team because we all came to school
early in the year and came in with
similar ideals. I haven't had the
chance to get to know a lot of other
people, so I'm sometimes weary
about opening up completely."
The Farm has become such a
familiar place that Grant often for
gets his whereabouts.
"It's weird walking around cam
pus and seeing all these people who
don't go here taking pictures and

buying things at the Bookstore,"
Grant said. "You don't really real
ize how much prestige the name
'Stanford' has. Coming here I
never thought of it that way. When
I see people taking pictures of the
fountains and the church, I don't
think of this as a college."
All seven said they feel well
adjusted to life on the Farm. Their
first quarter is rolling toward the
end and Thanksgiving break is
near. Only a few have had the
chance to see their families since
September.
"I drove home one weekend just
to get a book for one of my classes,"
Joe said. "It definitely wasn't
worth it — I could have survived
without reading it. But I didn't
know that at the time. Besides, I
got my laundry done and visited
the family. If you don't see them
every once in a while and keep
them happy, they might cut off the
cash flow."
