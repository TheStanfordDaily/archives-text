"How many of you have seen 'Dilbert' in comics?"
So asked "Dilbert" creator Scott Adams when he
visited the Stanford Bookstore for a book signing
yesterday evening. Not surprisingly, every hand in
the room was raised.
For those who don't know, "Dilbert" is one of the
most popular comic strips, appearing in more than
700 daily newspapers across the country.
Created in 1989, the comic strip follows the life of
Dilbert, a flat-topped, four-eyed electrical engineer,
and pokes fun at the trivialities of the workplace.
However, Dilbert's influence isn't limited to engi
neers. Dilbert is looked at with esteem by all mem
bers of the work force.
"He's great. He reflects real life in the work
place," said Rose McGee, a financial analyst.
Electrical engineering graduate student Jason
Loia put a different spin on things.
"Dilbert has revolutionized social Darwinism," he
said. "He's brought the engineer out of the closet."
"Dilbert" takes a humorous look at the work
place, presenting hilarious images of ignorant boss
es, inefficient management and a brutal office hier
archy with workers on the bottom.
Adams' new book, "You Can't Survive On Wits
Alone," contains old and new "Dilbert" material.
The book is the sixth written by Adams, who stated
that he's onlv in cartooning for the money.
