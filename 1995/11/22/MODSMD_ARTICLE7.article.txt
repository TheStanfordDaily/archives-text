# Dilbert's creator engineers laughs

"How many of you have seen 'Dilbert' in comics?"
So asked "Dilbert" creator Scott Adams when he
visited the Stanford Bookstore for a book signing
yesterday evening. Not surprisingly, every hand in
the room was raised.
For those who don't know, "Dilbert" is one of the
most popular comic strips, appearing in more than
700 daily newspapers across the country.
Created in 1989, the comic strip follows the life of
Dilbert, a flat-topped, four-eyed electrical engineer,
and pokes fun at the trivialities of the workplace.
However, Dilbert's influence isn't limited to engi
neers. Dilbert is looked at with esteem by all mem
bers of the work force.
"He's great. He reflects real life in the work
place," said Rose McGee, a financial analyst.
Electrical engineering graduate student Jason
Loia put a different spin on things.
"Dilbert has revolutionized social Darwinism," he
said. "He's brought the engineer out of the closet."
"Dilbert" takes a humorous look at the work
place, presenting hilarious images of ignorant boss
es, inefficient management and a brutal office hier
archy with workers on the bottom.
Adams' new book, "You Can't Survive On Wits
Alone," contains old and new "Dilbert" material.
The book is the sixth written by Adams, who stated
that he's onlv in cartooning for the money.
Fans believe otherwise, howev
er.
"He has to do it for a better rea
son than money. He knows he
loves it," said Olivia Fields, a law
student.
Maybe fans should believe
Adams. After being laid off from
his job as an applications engineer
at Pacific Bell earlier this year,
the strip has become his only
source of income.
Adams is reluctant to discuss
Pacific Bell, and when asked the
reason for his dismissal, he
offered a simple explanation.
"They said they had budget
problems," he said. "The problem
was they didn't have a budget for
a smart-ass cartoonist."
Adams' interest in cartooning
began when he first began draw
ing at the age of 10. He applied to
the Young Artists' School at the
age of 11 but was rejected and told
to wait until he was 12. He con
sidered following in his father's
footsteps and taking a job at the
post office, but reconsidered when
he decided that he "didn't want to
handle firearms."
Scott Adams doesn't seem to
mind not having a day job.
"I used to wake up at 5 a.m.,
now I wake up at 6," he said. "I'm
living in decadence."
On an average day, Adams
wakes up and draws the strip for
the day. He maintains the belief
that the best jobs are ones which
can be done in pajamas. "Just
look. Pope, Supreme Court jus
tice, they can all be done in a
bathrobe. Cartoonist ranks right
up there."
When asked about the source
for his ideas, Adams jokes that he
has trained his fans to do his work
for him. He proudly tells of the

almost 700 e-mail messages he
receives daily from devoted fans.
"I spend about an hour each
day reading my e-mail," he said.
The future of the strip remains
uncertain. Adams said a new
character will be introduced in a
few months. As for Dilbert having

a romantic interest, Adams told
of an idea he had to initiate a rela
tionship for his character.
"I asked my readers if they want
ed Dilbert to lose his virginity, and
surprisingly, they declined," he said.
The life of an engineer: all
work, no fun.
