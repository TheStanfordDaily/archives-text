# Early decision attracts 1,900
## Admissions program garners big response in its first year 
### Bobby Chen Staff writer 
Stanford's early decision program is
off to a running start in its first year,
garnering an estimated 1,900 applicants
for the Class of 2000.
The Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid said that after
all applications are in, around 2,200
high school seniors will apply to Stan
ford through the early decision pro
gram.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aid James Montoya said
approximately 1,100 applications for
early admission were sent to his office by
Nov. 1, the deadline for the Early Deci
sion I program.

Students who apply under the early
decision program pledge to attend Stan
ford if admitted. Applicants will be noti
fied of their status by mid-December,
and those who are admitted early will re
ceive financial aid award letters one
week later.
Applicants who mail their applica
tions by the regular Dec. 15 deadline but
also commit to attending Stanford upon
admission will have their files reviewed
by mid-February as a second phase of
the early decision program, called Early
Decision 11.
Montoya said the number of applica
tions for early admission would most
likely exceed their initial estimates.
"We anticipated around 2,000 appli
cations in Early Decision I and II com

bined," he said. "However, we received
about 1,100 applications from students
in the first phase of early decision. Even
though the regular deadline is not until
Dec. 15, we've already received 800 ap
plications for early decision with notifi
cation in February."
According to Montoya, 20 percent to
30 percent of the incoming freshman
class will be admitted through both
phases of the early decision program.
The admission rate of the early decision
pool will be between 16 percent and 24
percent if the number of applicants in
each phase is similar.
"Assuming a class of 1,600 students,
we plan to admit between 320 and 480 of

the entering freshmen through
Early Decision I and II,"he said.
With such a significant num
ber of applicants being admitted
through the early decision plan,
Montoya was quick to point out
that Stanford would maintain its
high standards of admission dur
ing its review of the early appli
cant files.
"These estimates are deter
mined largely by the overall
strength of the applicant pool," he
said. "The quality of the admitted
class will not be compromised in
an effort to simply admit students
who we know wish to attend
Stanford."
Of those who have applied for
early admission, 45 percent are
women and 55 percent are men.

In addition, 45 percent of the
early applicants are California
residents, while the remaining 55
percent come from other states
and countries.
Montoya said the geographical
distribution of applicants is simi
lar to the regular applicant pool in
recent years.
"The demographics of Early
Decision I are similar to the typi
cal pool of applicants, especially
in regard to geographical diversi
ty," he said. "It pleases me to
know that early decision candi
dates are coming from through
out the country and, for that
matter, from throughout the
world."
He added that regional repre
sentation is slightly different in
some respects.
"We have a smaller number of
international students applying
at this point," he said. "Also,
there is a higher representation

of students from the South, the
Mid-Atlantic and New England."
Of the early applicants so far,
32.6 percent attend private high

schools,
while the
remaining
67.4 percent
attend pub
lic high
schools.
Montoya
pointed out
that some
people had
voiced con
cerns over

the possibility that private school
students would make up the
majority of early decision appli
cants.
"Last year, 30.6 percent of our
applicants came from private
schools, and 69.4 percent of our
applicants went to public
schools," he said. "As a result, the

program has been
a top priority. *

concern that was voiced that
Early Decision I would be domi
nated by private schools is not
reflected in the numbers."

Montoya
said finan
cial aid for
early admits
would
depend on
essentially
the same
criteria as
those in the
regular
applicant
pool.

"Financial aid awards will be
based on estimates about family
income near the end of the
year," he said. "The estimates of
financial aid for the student will
be as good as the information
provided by the student and the
parent."
He praised the undergraduate

admissions office for their efforts
in conducting the early applica
tion review process.
"The smooth implementation
of the early decision program has
been a top priority," he said. "The
admissions staff is very seasoned
— they have a good sense of
which files will be competitive
without having to read every
application" from the complete
pool.
Montoya said the students
admitted under the early deci
sion program are applicants that
the admissions staff feel would
definitely be admitted as part of
the regular applicant pool.
"Those students admitted
under early decision are those
who are obvious admits," he
said. "We plan to defer decisions
until the spring for those candi
dates that are questionable."
He pointed out that a small
number of early applicants

would probably be denied
admission instead of deferring
their applications to the regular
pool.
"If a student will not be com
petitive in the larger pool, we
best serve them by letting them
know that and not giving them
false hopes," he said. "It allows
the students to focus on other
options rather than holding on to
one that is unrealistic."
Montoya added that the rejec
tion letter would be the most dif
ficult for him to write.
"In essence, that letter not
only tells the applicant that he or
she will not be admitted but that
he or she is not even competi
tive," he said.
He emphasized his belief that
the number of candidates who
would receive such a letter would
be "relatively small given the
overall strength of the applicant
pool."
