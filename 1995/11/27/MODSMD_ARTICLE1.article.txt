# Early decision attracts 1,900
## Admissions program garners big response in its first year 
### Bobby Chen Staff writer 
Stanford's early decision program is
off to a running start in its first year,
garnering an estimated 1,900 applicants
for the Class of 2000.
The Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid said that after
all applications are in, around 2,200
high school seniors will apply to Stan
ford through the early decision pro
gram.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aid James Montoya said
approximately 1,100 applications for
early admission were sent to his office by
Nov. 1, the deadline for the Early Deci
sion I program.

Students who apply under the early
decision program pledge to attend Stan
ford if admitted. Applicants will be noti
fied of their status by mid-December,
and those who are admitted early will re
ceive financial aid award letters one
week later.
Applicants who mail their applica
tions by the regular Dec. 15 deadline but
also commit to attending Stanford upon
admission will have their files reviewed
by mid-February as a second phase of
the early decision program, called Early
Decision 11.
Montoya said the number of applica
tions for early admission would most
likely exceed their initial estimates.
"We anticipated around 2,000 appli
cations in Early Decision I and II com

bined," he said. "However, we received
about 1,100 applications from students
in the first phase of early decision. Even
though the regular deadline is not until
Dec. 15, we've already received 800 ap
plications for early decision with notifi
cation in February."
According to Montoya, 20 percent to
30 percent of the incoming freshman
class will be admitted through both
phases of the early decision program.
The admission rate of the early decision
pool will be between 16 percent and 24
percent if the number of applicants in
each phase is similar.
"Assuming a class of 1,600 students,
we plan to admit between 320 and 480 of
