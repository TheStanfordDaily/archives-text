# Congress' rocky road ends

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Republicans are nearing the
end of their first year in con
trol of Congress with the
Holy Grail — a seven-year
balanced budget plan — in
sight but many other goals
clouded by disappointment
and delay.
GOP lawmakers celebrat
ed their Thanksgiving this
year with two giant achieve
ments, passage of their
spending and tax cut pack
age aimed at balancing the
budget by 2002 and the win
ning of President Clinton's
commitment to their seven
year timetable.
But the heady first days
of the 104 th session of
Congress, when House
Republicans marched their
"Contract With America"
items to passage, has given
way to more sober assess
ments of their legislative
achievements.
Among key "Contract"
items, a new crime bill call
ing for tougher sentences
and more prisons and a bill
to ease federal regulatory
burdens are mired in the
Senate. A proposed constitu
tional amendment on term
limits failed in the House
and another, on balancing
the budget, passed the
House but was defeated by
one vote in the Senate.
"Republicans over
reached and their agenda is
now considered too extrem
ist by the American people,"
said Rep. Bill Richardson, D-
N.M. "There's been a lot of
rhetoric and a lot of press
releases but hardly any bills

signed into law."
But the House Budget
Committee chairman, Rep.
John Kasich, R-Ohio, said
the occasional legislative log
jam is insignificant com
pared to the GOP success in
creating "a whole different
culture" with their budget
priorities.
"The budget is really
everything," he said. Asking
about other issues "is like
asking who else besides Babe
Ruth was on the Yankees."
There have been other
successes. Clinton has
signed into law legislation to
restrict so-called unfunded
mandates — federal rules
imposed on local govern
ments that Washington
doesn't pay for. Also enacted
was a law making members
of Congress abide by the
same labor laws that other
employers must obey.
The House has changed
its rules to restrict the
receiving of gifts and to limit
the terms of the speaker and
committee chairmen.
Also near completion is a
measure to strengthen the
reporting requirements for
lobbyists.
Others face far dimmer
prospects:
• An anti-terrorism bill
rushed through committees
after the April bombing in
Oklahoma City has been
effectively stopped by both
conservatives and Democrats
concerned about the civil lib
erties aspects of proposed
new search and surveillance
authority for law enforce
ment agencies.

• Legislation sponsored
by Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., to reshape
the State Department is
strongly opposed by the
administration, leading to
Helms' refusal to approve
ambassadorial nominations.
• Nearly two months after
the fiscal year began on Oct.
1, Clinton has signed only
six of the 13 spending bills
needed to run the govern
ment. Among those still
pending, Clinton is expected
to veto the defense bill
because he thinks it's too
high, and bills to fund the
departments of Labor, Edu
cation, Health and Human
Services and Housing and
Urban Development because
he says they provide too lit
tle for social programs.
• House-Senate negotia
tors are wrapping up work
on the GOP plan to revamp
the welfare system, but that,
too, faces a presidential veto.
A veto probably also awaits a
bill to remove regulations
and promote competition in
the telecommunications
industry.
• Other major Republican
initiatives, such as the $245
billion tax cut, overhauling
Medicare and Medicaid and
revamping the farm subsidy
system, have been incorpo
rated in the seven-year bal
anced budget plan. None are
likely to survive in their pre
sent forms at the end of
what is sure to be a fierce
battle between Republicans
and the White House on how
to balance the budget.
