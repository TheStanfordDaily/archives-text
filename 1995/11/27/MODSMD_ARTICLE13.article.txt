University Dining Services
must revise holiday dining
plans to avoid inconvenience

IF YOU WERE fortunate enough
to leave Stanford and spend time
with family and friends during
the Thanksgiving holiday, be grate
ful. Those you left behind may have
had difficulty finding enough to eat
on a weekend that is known for
feasting.
Last Thursday, not one of the
University dining halls was open for
students who were unable to go
home or had nowhere to go for the
holiday. Forget about using extra
points to eat at Wilbur Hall or Stern
Hall — there was hardly any food to
be found at all. Not even Tresidder
Express was open for those in search
of something to eat.
University Dining Services
should have recognized that there
would be students who were, by no
fault of their own, unable to either
cook in the dorm, muster $25 to dine
at the Stanford Faculty Club, join a
Thanksgiving celebration off cam
pus (at an adviser or professor's
home, for instance) or go to a restau
rant — that is, if any restaurants
were open near Stanford on
Thanksgiving. About the only place
operating that was quasi-convenient
was Jack in the Box, a mile down El
Camino.
In addition, the dining situation
did not improve significantly on Fri
day and Saturday, when Stern was
the only dining facility open on the
entire campus. Students who lived
as far away as Governor's Corner
had to trek all the way to the east
side of Stanford for brunch and din
ner.
To add insult to injury, Stern was
open only on one side and operated
on an abbreviated schedule. While
the quality of the food was fairly
good — given that it was a holiday
weekend — the crowds were over
whelming, especially at the dinner

hour. People were waiting 10-15
minutes at a time just to get some
thing from the grill or the entree
line. Getting a drink took just as
long.
And since Stern stayed open only
for two hours on both days during
brunch (10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.)
and one hour during dinner (5 to 6
p.m.), by the time diners had finally
navigated the entire obstacle course
of people and paid for their meals,
there was almost no place to sit.
Thoughts of going back and getting
seconds were quickly extinguished
by the thought of having to plow
through those lines.
Students should not have to deal
with such problems again next
Thanksgiving. By opening one htill
on Thanksgiving, and two dining
areas on each side of campus on the
days following Thanksgiving, these
problems could be alleviated.
Dining Services would probably
cite the fact that the vast majority of
students either leave Stanford or
have other plans for the holiday as a
reason to close all dining halls on
Thanksgiving Day and operate
Stern on a skeleton schedule. Open
ing an additional hall might prove
wasteful, and even if some students
are inconvenienced, it would only be
for one weekend.
Such logic artificially casts the
demand for on-campus dining in a
downward spiral, however. Because
Dining Services assumes that few
students will eat in dining halls, it
deliberately operates on a reduced
schedule. Not only does the strategy
decrease the level of service, but it
also encourages students to look
elsewhere to eat, even if they wanted
to dine on campus.
Admittedly, cost is an important
consideration, and that is why not
all of the halls should open. But if
just one hall on each end of campus
remains open during the Thanksgiv
ing holiday, students will be assured
of decent meals throughout the
four-day weekend. Such a change
would have brought some comfort
to those who could not, for whatever
reason, participate in Thanksgiving
activities with family and friends.
