Cole allays alum's concerns about Honor Code

RECENTLY, EUGENE Danaher,
Ph.D., Class of '46, wrote The
Daily and expressed alarm at the
"decline of the Honor Code." The topic
was raised in an Alumni Weekend class
taught by Prof, of Human Hiologv Her
ant Katchadourian. Katchadourian
defended Stanford's student honesty
and claimed that cheating is "annually
reviewed" and is not a "current prob
lem." Later, however, according to Dr.
Danaher, the professor backed off and
said that he knew of no objective data
about the incidence of cheating at Stan
ford.
Katchadourian's first assertions were
more correct than he realized. The level
of student honesty and the health of the
Stanford Honor Code have been studied,
more or less routinely, since 1961. The
longitudinal data points are 1961, 1976,
1980. 1984, 1990and 1994. The most
recent survey, conducted in the spring

of 1994 by (he Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council, revealed an unprecedented
90 percent of Stanford undergraduates
stating that they "believe in (the Honor
Code] strongly" or "think it is a good
idea."
Stanford undergraduates also
expressed strong support for the Honor
Code requirement that they "take
action" when they witness the dishon
esty of fellow students — only nine per
cent responded by saying that they
would "ignore the incident." Unlike
many honor code schools, Stanford does
not obligate a student to report a fellow
student, requiring instead that they
"take action" — do whatever seems rea
sonable to them under the particular
circumstances. This may include draw
ing attention to the offense in an exam
situation, speaking to the student after
wards or, if other options fail, reporting
the incident to the instructor or teach

ing assistant.
Dr. Danaher sent Katchadourian the
results of the "respected McCabe poll,"
apparently not realizing that Stanford
undergraduates participated in that sur
vey and are currently participating in
McCabe's 1995 replication. McCabe sur
veyed 31 prestigious schools, about
evenly divided between those with
honor codes and those with other aca
demic integrity policies. The Stanford
survey findings were publicized at that
time, as were the spring 1994 results
from the SCLC survey.
The Stanford Honor Code is not "in
decline," nor are Stanford students
more dishonest than their predecessors.
What our Honor Code lacks is wide
spread visibility and the active involve
ment of student and faculty in its
enforcement.
For historical reasons, Stanford's
system is, almost without exception, run

by the administration. In my opinion,
this is a problem.
The experience on other campuses
demonstrates that the best vehicle for
informing the campus about academic
integrity issues and problems is through
the routine involvement of faculty and
students — handling Honor Code viola
tions and then, perhaps because they
don't like handling them, getting
involved in prevention and education
initiatives.
Until we revise The Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, however, and
give more authority to students and fac
ulty, it is at least good to know that Dr.
Danaher is wrong about the concerns he
expressed in his letter. The Stanford
Honor Code is not in decline and we are
not oblivious to the state of student
honesty on campus. Quite the contrary.
