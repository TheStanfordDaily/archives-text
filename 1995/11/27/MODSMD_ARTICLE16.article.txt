## Sitting with the enemy 
### 
IF BEATING THE hell out of the
obnoxious movie-goer sitting next to
you doesn't fall under the category of
justifiable homicide, then there is some
thing seriously wrong with this coun
try's judicial system.
Yes, I had the opportunity to sit right
next to one of these walking condom ads
over the weekend, but I lacked the belt
sander and vice grip I needed to properly
teach this boy a lesson. The scary thing,
though, was that there were dozens of
these obnoxious creatures scattered
throughout the audience.
In an attempt to better society, today
I would like to discuss the most offensive
species of obnoxious movie-goers.
The Clappers: These are the people
that insist on clapping the Century The
aters' theme song that plays before the
movie. These are by far the most com
mon of the creatures, and you probably
know one of these people personally.
Most of them know the pain they are
causing the rest of us but choose to do
what they do anyway.
The Predictors: These are the people
that insist upon trying to guess, out loud
of course, what is going to happen next
in the movie in order to suck all the sus
pense and excitement out of the picture.
This was the guy sitting next to you dur
ing "The Crying Game" that half way
through says,"I bet she's a guy."
The Deaf: These are the ones that can't

seem to hear a damn thing and have to
have whoever is sitting next to them
repeat every line. To top it off, they are
always saying "What did he say?" during
the next line so you miss that line, too.
Obnoxious Parents: These are the
ones that bring the three-year-old off
spring of Satan to every movie they
shouldn't and sit right behind you. I
would expect to find them at "Home
Alone II" or "The Lion King," but there
will always be some of them at movies
like "Natural Born Killers" or "Pulp Fic
tion." And even when they leave the rug
rats at home, they still manage to get on
your nerves. If you have ever had the
pleasure of sitting in front of a pair of
them when they get a call from the baby
sitter during the movie on their cellular
phone, you understand.
The Garth Brooks Type: These are
the large guys dressed like Garth Brooks
and, naturally, wear their cowboy hats
and just love to sit right in front of you so
you can't see the bottom two-thirds of
the screen. Generally, the large knife
holster on their belt or, in Texas, the
right to carry concealed fire arms dis
courages you from telling them what
they can do with their hats.
Thumper: This one was a new experi
ence for me this weekend and the inspi
ration for this column. Whenever this
guy got excited, he would start vibrating
his leg like a dog wagging his tail. Natu

rally, the entire row of seats would
vibrate with him. People sitting a dozen
seats down were looking around thinking
someone was having an epileptic seizure.
The Eaters: Sure, popcorn and some
Junior Mints are all right, but there are
always some people that feel they need
to feast during the movie, sitting down
their dinner right next to you. The beau
ty of this meal is the movie hot dog. Not
only does it smell unappetizing, but 20
minutes later, you also get to enjoy the
smell of regurgitated processed meat as
their silent belch casually wafts past
you.
I am not writing this just to complain
and make fun of these social rejects.
Rather, consider it constructive criti
cism. I believe the movie theaters should
have ushers quietly drag these people
out of the theater and administer tickle
torture to them for the rest of the movie.
At the very least, the announcement at
the beginning of the movie should be:
"Please stand up and move towards the
center of the theater in order to fill any
open seats and feel free to smack the per
son sitting next to you if they clap to the
Century theme song. Enjoy the show!"

new members for his Movie-going Militia.
