## Men's basketball takes Fry's Invitational again Injured shoulder and all, Knight still leads the way for the Cardinal attack 
### Daniel Kao Editorial staff 
Up until the start of Saturday
night's Fry's Invitational champi
onship game between Rice and
host Stanford, Cardinal junior
point guard Brevin Knight wasn't
certain if he would be able to play.
After a 20-point, 10-assist perfor
mance the previous night in a win
over Stetson, Knight woke up Sat
urday morning with an acute case
of tendonitis in his shoulder.
"[Friday night] I was sleeping,
and when I went to roll over, I
couldn't move Imy shoulder],"
Knight said. "I couldn't lift it at
all [Saturday] morning. It was

[Brevin] was playing
hard, playing well,
running the club.'

pretty scary because I just
couldn't move it at all."
Knight's status was in doubt,
and the team, expecting the
worst, was even prepared to play
without him.
"We didn't think he was going
to play tonight," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery
after Saturday's game. "He could
not move [his shoulder] this
morning. It wasn't something
that was advertised. He has an
acute case of tendonitis in his
shoulder and actually could not
lift it this morning — could not
move it away from his body. We
didn't know until warm-ups if he
was going to play.
"Either he could do it in warm
ups, or he wasn't going to get to
play at all. We had pretty much
prepared ourselves mentally to go
with other people, but he said he
could go. And then he ends up
playing 138 minutes]."
It was a good thing for Stan
ford that he did. After struggling
through most of the first half
against the Owls, Knight's hero

ics early in the second period
broke open the game.
The Cardinal had offensive dif
ficulties against Rice's zone
defense throughout the game,
especially early on. With center
Tim Young getting into early foul
trouble, the Cardinal had prob
lems establishing any real interi
or game.
Couple that with Knight's
reluctance to air it out at the out
set because of shoulder stiffness
and it's not a big surprise that the
Stanford offense stagnated a bit,
being held to 42.9 percent field
goal shooting in the first half.
"I was a little hesitant early
because I didn't want to go out
and push [my shoulder] too quick
and too early," Knight said. "I
didn't want to go out and move my
shoulder too much and then find
out that I couldn't do it. I wanted
to get into the flow of the game
and get everybody comfortable.
Then once my shoulder became
comfortable, then that would open
up some of my shots. They were
backing off, giving me the jumper
in the second half, and I took it."
Knight not only took the shots
— he drained them. After hitting
just three field goals in the first
half, two of them layups, Knight
put on a shooting clinic to jump
start a Cardinal team that was
clinging to a two-point, 31-29 lead
at the half.
The point guard drilled a three
pointer to start the show less than
a minute into the second half.
Proving that he still remembers a
thing or two about penetrating
and showmanship, Knight's next
bucket came on a driving layin
where he sliced into the lane, drew
the foul, sank the layup, pumped
his fists and then calmly convert
ed the three-point play.
Knight didn't stop there. Two
consecutive 19-foot jumpers put
Stanford up by 13, and another
Knight shot from the top of the
key gave the Cardinal its largest
lead at 61-41 with just over 10
minutes remaining in the game.

Junior Brevin Knight soars in for the layup in Stanford's win over
Rice. Knight finished the game with 21 points and 10 assists.
Also, in case anyone forgot that
Knight can pass, the five-foot-10
Cardinal floor general showed that
he can dish with the best of them.
He recorded 10 assists, highlighted
by a no-look pass to senior guard
David Harbour on a fast break. All

in all, Knight either scored or
assisted on 29 of the Cardinal's
first 32 second-half points.
Whether it was driving, shooting
or passing, Knight and his shoul
der appeared comfortable.
"Brevin was in the flow,"
Montgomery said. "He was play
ing hard, playing well, running
the club. He obviously did fine. I
don't think [the shoulder] is
something that's going to be lin

gering. It's not a structural deal.
It's a tissue deal, and I think we
have it under control."
Knight's back-to-back double
double performances netted him
the MVP award at the Fry's Invi
tational. While the Cardinal
trainers may have things under
control now, future opponents
may have difficulties doing the
same to Knight and the storied
shoulder.
