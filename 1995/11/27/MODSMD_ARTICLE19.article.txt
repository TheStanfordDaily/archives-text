Triggered by a gutty perfor
mance from Brevin Knight, Stan
ford men's basketball captured its
third straight Fry's Invitational
championship Saturday night
with a 75-64 victory over Rice.
Scoring or assisting on 29 of
the Cardinal's first 32 points of
the second half, the junior point
guard helped No. 18 Stanford (2-
0) move from a 31-29 halftime
lead to a 20-point advantage with
10 minutes to play. Many of those
points came during transition,
something head coach Mike
Montgomery has stressed early in
the season.
"Once we get running, we're at
our best," said Knight, who ended
the night with 21 points and 10
assists. "We got beyond their
defense and had numbers, and
once that happened, we got into a
flow and the team got its confi
dence back."
The transition game also helped
fight the Owls' zone defense,
which caused the Cardinal trouble
in the first half. Sophomore center
Tim Young and senior power for
ward Darren Allaway got good
looks at the basket early but the
shots didn't drop, helping Rice (1-
1) stay close.
After substituting senior David
Harbour for Allaway and fresh
man Mark Seaton for Young to
combat the Owls' small lineup
around the 10-minute mark of
the first half, Stanford moved out
to an 11-point lead before the
Owls came back to close it to "two
before the break.
"As expected, Rice gave us an
excellent ball game," Mont

gomery said. "We played very well
at times, but we also had lapses.
We play well, get up and then
relax. We've got to correct that —
we've got to drive the nails in."
Luckily, Montgomery has a
player like Knight to turn to for
his problems on the hardwood.
After scoring 20 points and dish
ing out 10 assists in Stanford's
92-60 win over Stetson in the
opening round, Knight duplicated
his efforts in the championship
game to secure Most Valuable
Player honors in front of 4,076
fans in Maples Pavilion.

'As expected, Rice
gave us an excellent
bail game. We played
very well at times,
but we also had
lapses. We play well,
get up and then
relax. We've got to
correct that— we've
got to drive the
nails in.'
— Mike Montgomery

Knight'? performance is all the
more impressive considering he
couldn't move his right arm Fri
day night — acute tendonitis in
his shoulder had the coaching
staff wondering if he would be
able to play against Rice, who
defeated Yale 80-58 to reach the
finals. However, after warming
up and getting into the flow of the
game, the shoulder loosened up
and allowed Knight the full range
of dribble-drives, no-look passes
and three-point shots in his offen
sive arsenal.
