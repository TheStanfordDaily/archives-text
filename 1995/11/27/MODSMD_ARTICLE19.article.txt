Triggered by a gutty perfor
mance from Brevin Knight, Stan
ford men's basketball captured its
third straight Fry's Invitational
championship Saturday night
with a 75-64 victory over Rice.
Scoring or assisting on 29 of
the Cardinal's first 32 points of
the second half, the junior point
guard helped No. 18 Stanford (2-
0) move from a 31-29 halftime
lead to a 20-point advantage with
10 minutes to play. Many of those
points came during transition,
something head coach Mike
Montgomery has stressed early in
the season.
"Once we get running, we're at
our best," said Knight, who ended
the night with 21 points and 10
assists. "We got beyond their
defense and had numbers, and
once that happened, we got into a
flow and the team got its confi
dence back."
The transition game also helped
fight the Owls' zone defense,
which caused the Cardinal trouble
in the first half. Sophomore center
Tim Young and senior power for
ward Darren Allaway got good
looks at the basket early but the
shots didn't drop, helping Rice (1-
1) stay close.
After substituting senior David
Harbour for Allaway and fresh
man Mark Seaton for Young to
combat the Owls' small lineup
around the 10-minute mark of
the first half, Stanford moved out
to an 11-point lead before the
Owls came back to close it to "two
before the break.
"As expected, Rice gave us an
excellent ball game," Mont

gomery said. "We played very well
at times, but we also had lapses.
We play well, get up and then
relax. We've got to correct that —
we've got to drive the nails in."
Luckily, Montgomery has a
player like Knight to turn to for
his problems on the hardwood.
After scoring 20 points and dish
ing out 10 assists in Stanford's
92-60 win over Stetson in the
opening round, Knight duplicated
his efforts in the championship
game to secure Most Valuable
Player honors in front of 4,076
fans in Maples Pavilion.

'As expected, Rice
gave us an excellent
bail game. We played
very well at times,
but we also had
lapses. We play well,
get up and then
relax. We've got to
correct that— we've
got to drive the
nails in.'
— Mike Montgomery

Knight'? performance is all the
more impressive considering he
couldn't move his right arm Fri
day night — acute tendonitis in
his shoulder had the coaching
staff wondering if he would be
able to play against Rice, who
defeated Yale 80-58 to reach the
finals. However, after warming
up and getting into the flow of the
game, the shoulder loosened up
and allowed Knight the full range
of dribble-drives, no-look passes
and three-point shots in his offen
sive arsenal.
Joining Knight on the all-tour
nament team were senior Dion
Cross, senior Andy Poppink,
Rice's J.J. Polk and Stetson's
Kerry Blackshear. Cross, winner
of the past two Fry's MVP tro
phies, averaged 16 points and
shot six-for-13 from the three
point line. Poppink averaged 15
points (10-for-15 from the field)
and six rebounds.
Polk averaged 13 points on 11-
for-17 shooting for Rice, while
Blackshear tallied 24 points and
8.5 rebounds a game for third
place Stetson. The Hatters (1-1)
defeated Yale (0-2) 78-58 in the
consolation game.
Friday night's action saw
Stanford hold off the two-man
show from Stetson with crisp exe
cution and net-scorching shoot
ing. Finishing the game shooting
66.7 percent, the Cardinal got
points from 11 different players.
Stetson's Blackshear and Jason
Alexander, the focal points in the
Hatters' Indiana-style motion
offense, accounted for 53 of Stet
son's 60 points. The other three
starters contributed zero points,
one rebound and nine fouls.
"We knew thoy had two people
they wanted to go to," Mont
gomery said. "We just had to get
used to their motion. We had the
advantage size-wise and needed
to keep Tim on the floor as much
as possible — he's a security blan
ket for us inside."
Young dominated inside with a
variety of turn-arounds, hooks
and putbacks, constantly drawing
fouls on the Hatters' small front
line. Finishing the game with 18
points and 14 rebounds, Young
said he felt much more comfort
able and confident in the offense.
"I wanted to establish my
offense early and become a threat
so they'd have to double down on
me," he said. "It's a sign of
respect."
Stanford shot over 50 percent
for both games while holding
Stetson and Rice to under 43 per
cent shooting — precisely the exe
cution the Cardinal needs as it
heads into a stretch of three
games over five nights, beginning
Tuesday at the Cow Palace
against the University of San
Francisco at 7 p.m.

and three-point shots in his offen
sive arsenal.
Joining Knight on the all-tour
nament team were senior Dion
Cross, senior Andy Poppink,
Rice's J.J. Polk and Stetson's
Kerry Blackshear. Cross, winner
of the past two Fry's MVP tro
phies, averaged 16 points and
shot six-for-13 from the three
point line. Poppink averaged 15
points (10-for-15 from the field)
and six rebounds.
Polk averaged 13 points on 11-
for-17 shooting for Rice, while
Blackshear tallied 24 points and
8.5 rebounds a game for third
place Stetson. The Hatters (1-1)
defeated Yale (0-2) 78-58 in the
consolation game.
Friday night's action saw
Stanford hold off the two-man
show from Stetson with crisp exe
cution and net-scorching shoot
ing. Finishing the game shooting
66.7 percent, the Cardinal got
points from 11 different players.
Stetson's Blackshear and Jason
Alexander, the focal points in the
Hatters' Indiana-style motion
offense, accounted for 53 of Stet
son's 60 points. The other three
starters contributed zero points,
one rebound and nine fouls.
"We knew thoy had two people
they wanted to go to," Mont
gomery said. "We just had to get
used to their motion. We had the
advantage size-wise and needed
to keep Tim on the floor as much
as possible — he's a security blan
ket for us inside."
Young dominated inside with a
variety of turn-arounds, hooks
and putbacks, constantly drawing
fouls on the Hatters' small front
line. Finishing the game with 18
points and 14 rebounds, Young
said he felt much more comfort
able and confident in the offense.
"I wanted to establish my
offense early and become a threat
so they'd have to double down on
me," he said. "It's a sign of
respect."
Stanford shot over 50 percent
for both games while holding
Stetson and Rice to under 43 per
cent shooting — precisely the exe
cution the Cardinal needs as it
heads into a stretch of three
games over five nights, beginning
Tuesday at the Cow Palace
against the University of San
Francisco at 7 p.m.

Triggered by a gutty perfor
mance from Brevin Knight, Stan
ford men's basketball captured its
third straight Fry's Invitational
championship Saturday night
with a 75-64 victory over Rice.
Scoring or assisting on 29 of
the Cardinal's first 32 points of
the second half, the junior point
guard helped No. 18 Stanford (2-
0) move from a 31-29 halftime
lead to a 20-point advantage with
10 minutes to play. Many of those
points came during transition,
something head coach Mike
Montgomery has stressed early in
the season.
"Once we get running, we're at
our best," said Knight, who ended
the night with 21 points and 10
assists. "We got beyond their
defense and had numbers, and
once that happened, we got into a
flow and the team got its confi
dence back."
The transition game also helped
fight the Owls' zone defense,
which caused the Cardinal trouble
in the first half. Sophomore center
Tim Young and senior power for
ward Darren Allaway got good
looks at the basket early but the
shots didn't drop, helping Rice (1-
1) stay close.
After substituting senior David
Harbour for Allaway and fresh
man Mark Seaton for Young to
combat the Owls' small lineup
around the 10-minute mark of
the first half, Stanford moved out
to an 11-point lead before the
Owls came back to close it to "two
before the break.
"As expected, Rice gave us an
excellent ball game," Mont

gomery said. "We played very well
at times, but we also had lapses.
We play well, get up and then
relax. We've got to correct that —
we've got to drive the nails in."
Luckily, Montgomery has a
player like Knight to turn to for
his problems on the hardwood.
After scoring 20 points and dish
ing out 10 assists in Stanford's
92-60 win over Stetson in the
opening round, Knight duplicated
his efforts in the championship
game to secure Most Valuable
Player honors in front of 4,076
fans in Maples Pavilion.

'As expected, Rice
gave us an excellent
bail game. We played
very well at times,
but we also had
lapses. We play well,
get up and then
relax. We've got to
correct that— we've
got to drive the
nails in.'
— Mike Montgomery

Knight'? performance is all the
more impressive considering he
couldn't move his right arm Fri
day night — acute tendonitis in
his shoulder had the coaching
staff wondering if he would be
able to play against Rice, who
defeated Yale 80-58 to reach the
finals. However, after warming
up and getting into the flow of the
game, the shoulder loosened up
and allowed Knight the full range
of dribble-drives, no-look passes
and three-point shots in his offen
sive arsenal.
Joining Knight on the all-tour
nament team were senior Dion
Cross, senior Andy Poppink,
Rice's J.J. Polk and Stetson's
Kerry Blackshear. Cross, winner
of the past two Fry's MVP tro
phies, averaged 16 points and
shot six-for-13 from the three
point line. Poppink averaged 15
points (10-for-15 from the field)
and six rebounds.
Polk averaged 13 points on 11-
for-17 shooting for Rice, while
Blackshear tallied 24 points and
8.5 rebounds a game for third
place Stetson. The Hatters (1-1)
defeated Yale (0-2) 78-58 in the
consolation game.
