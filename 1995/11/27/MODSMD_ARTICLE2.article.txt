# Effectiveness of Bosnia plan under question
## 
### Jeanhee Hong 
In the aftermath of t he momentous Bosnia peace
accord, Stanford faculty and students commented on
the international debate over what may most effec
tively bring peace to the war-torn Balkan region.
While the peace plan reached last week may be im
perfect, many said it is u move toward some resolu
tion and a restoration of civil life in Bosnia.
"It's an extremely important step forward," said
History Prof. Norman Naimark. "Finding a peace ac
cord is not going to find peace, but this accord brings
hope that something positive will come of it."
The U.S.-brokered peace calls for a single Bosnian
state made up of a Muslim / Croat federation, a Serb
republic, a united Sarajevo under Muslim / Croat
control and one central government. The accord also
bans war criminals from holding political office, but
offers no guarantees that they will be brought to jus
tice.
An estimated 20,000 U.S. soldiers may be called to
help enforce the accord, an issue which has caused
considerable controversy among Americans about
the role of the United States in Bosnia. In order to
gain public and congressional support for his Bosnia
policy, President Clinton plans to address the nation
tonight in a televised speech.
Naimark voiced his support for sending the
troops. "While 1 don't think it's without some danger
for our troops, I think it's worthwhile. It's an impor
tant step toward establishing some security in South
eastern Europe, and 1 think it's important that we
support the peace mission and take a leadership role
in it," said Naimark.
"The accord is the result of a balance of political
forces, and I think the accord is better than no ac
cord," said David Holloway, professor of political sci
ence.
"The big question is whether or not Bosnia can be
come a viable state, and create institutions that en
able it to function as a state ... or whether it will re-
quire the indefinite presence of
60,000 troops," he added.
Holloway said he didn't see
how the peace accord could solve
this problem. "The peace accord is
basically to codify a cease-fire,
make adjustments to territory,
and on that basis, to move for
ward."
Despite the positive implica
tions of the peace plan, however,
some are skeptical about the
effectiveness of the accord in
bringing peace to the Balkan
region.
History Prof. Emeritus Wayne
Vucinich said inhabitants of
Bosnia and Herzegovina are
"prone to vendetta."
"There are many problems to
be resolved, such as the territorial
delimitations, corridors, access to
the Adriatic and the status of
Sarajevo and its suburbs,"

Vucinich said. "I would not send
American troops to Yugoslavia so
long as fighting is present."
Vucinich added that for 10
years after both the first and the
second World Wars, banditry and
small-scale fighting continued.
"We really object to certain
aspects of [the accord]," said
graduate student Sheri Fink,
president of Students Against
Genocide (SAGE), a national stu
dent group started in 1992 in
response to the Bosnian war.
"We're very much hoping for
peace, but we're very opposed to
the concept of division in Bosnia,
rewarding nearly four years of
genocide," said Fink. She added
that the organization is con
cerned that the United States
would leave within a year "and
the Bosnian government |would!
not be in a position to defend the
Bosnian people."
Fink said another concern of
SAGF was that the accord pro
vides no guarantee that war crim
inals will be brought to justice.

"We're meeting this plan with
skepticism and concern and a
small amount of hope, after so
many plans have failed," said
Fink.
Orhan Niksic, a sophomore
who came to the United States
from central Bosnia two years
ago, also voiced concern about the
peace plan.
"I'm glad that the killing is
finally going to stop, but I'm also
very skeptical because some fun
damental issues have not been
addressed by the peace plan, such
as delivering the war criminals
who caused the war to the inter
national war crimes tribunal," he
said.
Niksic also said the peace plan
failed to provide a mechanism for
returning refugees to the areas
from which they had been ethni
cally cleansed, an issue that is
"essential to preserving the mul
tiethnic nature and the unity of
the Bosnian state."
Although criticized for over
looking sensitive points, the peace

accord still marks a watershed in
Balkan history.
"The big battles are yet to be
fought," said Vucinich, "but they
might not be fought in battle
fields — they will be fought in
continued negotiations under the
auspices of higher European and
American authorities."
"The test of [the accord's] rela
tive fairness is that all parties
signed on," said Naimark.
While the accord has been crit
icized for lacking provisions to
hand war criminals over to the
Hague Tribunal, Naimark said he
doesn't think any peace accord
between nations could have such
provisions. "That would require
more war, conquering and occu
pying . . . and no one wants more
war."
Naimark said there is hope in
the accord "if you think of it as
not the end of a process but
rather the beginning. . . . Once
you get the fighting stopped, you
can begin to build the bridges
between the people."

Although criticized for over
looking sensitive points, the peace

accord still marks a watershed in
Balkan history.
"The big battles are yet to be
fought," said Vucinich, "but they
might not be fought in battle
fields — they will be fought in
continued negotiations under the
auspices of higher European and
American authorities."
"The test of [the accord's] rela
tive fairness is that all parties
signed on," said Naimark.
While the accord has been crit
icized for lacking provisions to
hand war criminals over to the
Hague Tribunal, Naimark said he
doesn't think any peace accord
between nations could have such
provisions. "That would require
more war, conquering and occu
pying . . . and no one wants more
war."
Naimark said there is hope in
the accord "if you think of it as
not the end of a process but
rather the beginning. . . . Once
you get the fighting stopped, you
can begin to build the bridges
between the people."
In the aftermath of t he momentous Bosnia peace
accord, Stanford faculty and students commented on
the international debate over what may most effec
tively bring peace to the war-torn Balkan region.
While the peace plan reached last week may be im
perfect, many said it is u move toward some resolu
tion and a restoration of civil life in Bosnia.
"It's an extremely important step forward," said
History Prof. Norman Naimark. "Finding a peace ac
cord is not going to find peace, but this accord brings
hope that something positive will come of it."
The U.S.-brokered peace calls for a single Bosnian
state made up of a Muslim / Croat federation, a Serb
republic, a united Sarajevo under Muslim / Croat
control and one central government. The accord also
bans war criminals from holding political office, but
offers no guarantees that they will be brought to jus
tice.
An estimated 20,000 U.S. soldiers may be called to
help enforce the accord, an issue which has caused
considerable controversy among Americans about
the role of the United States in Bosnia. In order to
gain public and congressional support for his Bosnia
policy, President Clinton plans to address the nation
tonight in a televised speech.
Naimark voiced his support for sending the
troops. "While 1 don't think it's without some danger
for our troops, I think it's worthwhile. It's an impor
tant step toward establishing some security in South
eastern Europe, and 1 think it's important that we
support the peace mission and take a leadership role
in it," said Naimark.
"The accord is the result of a balance of political
forces, and I think the accord is better than no ac
cord," said David Holloway, professor of political sci
ence.
"The big question is whether or not Bosnia can be
come a viable state, and create institutions that en
able it to function as a state ... or whether it will re-
quire the indefinite presence of
60,000 troops," he added.
Holloway said he didn't see
how the peace accord could solve
this problem. "The peace accord is
basically to codify a cease-fire,
make adjustments to territory,
and on that basis, to move for
ward."
Despite the positive implica
tions of the peace plan, however,
some are skeptical about the
effectiveness of the accord in
bringing peace to the Balkan
region.
History Prof. Emeritus Wayne
Vucinich said inhabitants of
Bosnia and Herzegovina are
"prone to vendetta."
"There are many problems to
be resolved, such as the territorial
delimitations, corridors, access to
the Adriatic and the status of
Sarajevo and its suburbs,"

Vucinich said. "I would not send
American troops to Yugoslavia so
long as fighting is present."
Vucinich added that for 10
years after both the first and the
second World Wars, banditry and
small-scale fighting continued.
"We really object to certain
aspects of [the accord]," said
graduate student Sheri Fink,
president of Students Against
Genocide (SAGE), a national stu
dent group started in 1992 in
response to the Bosnian war.
"We're very much hoping for
peace, but we're very opposed to
the concept of division in Bosnia,
rewarding nearly four years of
genocide," said Fink. She added
that the organization is con
cerned that the United States
would leave within a year "and
the Bosnian government |would!
not be in a position to defend the
Bosnian people."
Fink said another concern of
SAGF was that the accord pro
vides no guarantee that war crim
inals will be brought to justice.

"We're meeting this plan with
skepticism and concern and a
small amount of hope, after so
many plans have failed," said
Fink.
Orhan Niksic, a sophomore
who came to the United States
from central Bosnia two years
ago, also voiced concern about the
peace plan.
"I'm glad that the killing is
finally going to stop, but I'm also
very skeptical because some fun
damental issues have not been
addressed by the peace plan, such
as delivering the war criminals
who caused the war to the inter
national war crimes tribunal," he
said.
Niksic also said the peace plan
failed to provide a mechanism for
returning refugees to the areas
from which they had been ethni
cally cleansed, an issue that is
"essential to preserving the mul
tiethnic nature and the unity of
the Bosnian state."
Although criticized for over
looking sensitive points, the peace

accord still marks a watershed in
Balkan history.
"The big battles are yet to be
fought," said Vucinich, "but they
might not be fought in battle
fields — they will be fought in
continued negotiations under the
auspices of higher European and
American authorities."
"The test of [the accord's] rela

the accord "if you think of it as
not the end of a process but
rather the beginning. . . . Once
you get the fighting stopped, you
