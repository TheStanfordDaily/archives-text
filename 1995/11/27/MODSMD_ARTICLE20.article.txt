# Polo's season ends at MPSF tourney
## Irvine drowns Stanford's hopes

A year marked by high expec
tations and disappointing
results came to its unfortunate
conclusion last weekend as the
Stanford men's water polo team
ended its season by finishing
sixth in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation conference
tournament, thus ending its bid
for a third consecutive national

championship.
The Cardinal (17-11, 3-5
MPSF) needed to emerge on top
of its league in order to earn one
of four berths to the NCAA
championship tournament. In a
cruel twist of fate, NCAAs are
being held at Stanford's own
DeGuerre pool this upcoming
weekend.
Entering the final day of the
tourney yesterday, the Cardinal
was already relegated to playing
for the fifth spot in the confer
ence. The somewhat deflated
Stanford squad matched up
against a similarly uninspired
Pepperdine team.
The game, which held essen
tially no real importance, was
played in just that manner.
Head coach Dante Dettamanti
substituted heavily, even
spelling senior goalie Jack
Bowen with little-used Buzzy
Spain. After playing Pepperdine
evenly through the first half,
the Cardinal ultimately sunk
beneath the Waves, losing the
game by a score of 8-5 and run

ning its tourney record to 2-2.
On Saturday, Dettamanti's
squad faced off against Long
Beach State. With the Stanford
team already out of the running
for the league crown, the match
against the 49ers likewise held lit
tle significance, save vengeance.
After suffering an embarrassing
upset at the hands of Long Beach
earlier in the season, the Cardinal
was looking to reestablish its
superiority.
"We did a really great job
against Long Beach," Dettamanti
said. "The guys remembered the
way we lost to them last time and
they really came out fired up."
The Cardinal raced to a 5-1
first-quarter advantage en route
to an easy 17-8 victory. The offen
sive effort was lead by senior
Jeremy Laster, who notched four
points. Junior Brian Wallin and
senior Daniel Lehoczky were the
other primary contributors, as
they each tallied a hat trick.
But the pivotal game of the
entire tournament for the Cardi
nal was played Friday afternoon
against UC-Irvine on the heels of

a 12-3 Stanford domination of
UC-Santa Barbara. It was the
third time the two teams had
met, with each squad having
taken one of the two previous
matches. This time however, the
stakes were infinitely higher. The
winner would continue on the
path towards the league — and
possibly the NCAA — champi
onship.
As the game progressed, it
became evident that both teams
knew precisely what was at stake.
The match turned into a tough
fought defensive struggle, as nei
ther squad was willing to give an
inch. By the time the final period
of play came around, the
Anteaters held on to the narrow
est of leads, 2-1.
The Cardinal knotted the score
at two apiece early in the fourth
quarter when senior Dan Han
cock fired the ball into the back of
the net during a 6-on-5 opportu
nity. The two teams remained
even for nearly four minutes, as
neither school's offense was able
to breach the stingy defense of its
opponent.
Finally, with two minutes, 49
seconds to play, the Anteaters
found a niche in the Cardinal
armor. As Irv ine sophomore Ryan
Bailey was receiving the ball at

the two-meter position, Laster
took a gamble, attempting to go
for the steal. When he missed the
incoming pass, Bailey turned with
ball and, finding himself one-on
one with Bowen, rifled the ball
into the goal.
"Jeremy took a chance on that
play," Dettamanti said. "It might
not have been the wisest decision
in such a close game, but he
makes that play all of the time. It
was just one of those things
where things did not work out."
Pressured but with plenty of
time to work with, the Cardinal
continued to attempt to find a
way to get the ball into the goal.
But Dettamanti's players contin
ued to struggle offensively, turn
ing the ball over twice.
After one of those miscues, the
Anteaters assumed possession
with just under a minute to play.
As the shot clock was winding
down, an Anteater fired a shot
from the perimeter. Bowen went
up for the ball, but was only able
to deflect the shot out of bounds.
Irvine regained possession with
30 seconds to play. Since the shot
clock is 35 seconds in duration,
the Anteaters were in complete
control of the game. Irvine played
thirty seconds of keep-away
before shooting the ball at an
empty net as time expired.
"I felt that the guys were play
ing hard. I really did," Dettaman
ti said. "I can't fault their effort
at all. We just didn't have it. Two
goals is never going to be enough
to win a game."
The loss to Irvine was indica
tive of the difficulties that the
Cardinal has endured for much of
the season. Paramount among
these is the inability to consis
tently produce on offense against
the top teams in the nation. The
relatively low output of goals cou
pled by a lack of what Dettamanti
described as the intangibles char
acteristic of championship teams
resulted in a disappointing sea
son.
"We were lacking that extra
ingredient that makes a differ
ence in the close games," Detta
manti said. "We didn't have that
edge that is characteristic of a
championship team, that sepa
rates it from the rest of the pack.
We were in every game this sea
son, with only one or two excep
tions. Had things gone slightly
different at critical points, every
thing might have been different.
But we were just out-played in
crucial situations."

ning its tourney record to 2-2.
On Saturday, Dettamanti's
squad faced off against Long
Beach State. With the Stanford
team already out of the running
for the league crown, the match
against the 49ers likewise held lit
tle significance, save vengeance.
After suffering an embarrassing
upset at the hands of Long Beach
earlier in the season, the Cardinal
was looking to reestablish its
superiority.
"We did a really great job
against Long Beach," Dettamanti
said. "The guys remembered the
way we lost to them last time and
they really came out fired up."
The Cardinal raced to a 5-1
first-quarter advantage en route
to an easy 17-8 victory. The offen
sive effort was lead by senior
Jeremy Laster, who notched four
points. Junior Brian Wallin and
senior Daniel Lehoczky were the
other primary contributors, as
they each tallied a hat trick.
But the pivotal game of the
entire tournament for the Cardi
nal was played Friday afternoon
against UC-Irvine on the heels of

a 12-3 Stanford domination of
UC-Santa Barbara. It was the
third time the two teams had
met, with each squad having
taken one of the two previous
matches. This time however, the
stakes were infinitely higher. The
winner would continue on the
path towards the league — and
possibly the NCAA — champi
onship.
As the game progressed, it
became evident that both teams
knew precisely what was at stake.
The match turned into a tough
fought defensive struggle, as nei
ther squad was willing to give an
inch. By the time the final period
of play came around, the
Anteaters held on to the narrow
est of leads, 2-1.
The Cardinal knotted the score
at two apiece early in the fourth
quarter when senior Dan Han
cock fired the ball into the back of
the net during a 6-on-5 opportu
nity. The two teams remained
even for nearly four minutes, as
neither school's offense was able
to breach the stingy defense of its
opponent.
Finally, with two minutes, 49
seconds to play, the Anteaters
found a niche in the Cardinal
armor. As Irv ine sophomore Ryan
Bailey was receiving the ball at

the two-meter position, Laster
took a gamble, attempting to go
for the steal. When he missed the
incoming pass, Bailey turned with
ball and, finding himself one-on
one with Bowen, rifled the ball
into the goal.
"Jeremy took a chance on that
play," Dettamanti said. "It might
not have been the wisest decision
in such a close game, but he
makes that play all of the time. It
was just one of those things
where things did not work out."
Pressured but with plenty of
time to work with, the Cardinal
continued to attempt to find a
way to get the ball into the goal.
But Dettamanti's players contin
ued to struggle offensively, turn
ing the ball over twice.
After one of those miscues, the
Anteaters assumed possession
with just under a minute to play.
As the shot clock was winding
down, an Anteater fired a shot
from the perimeter. Bowen went
up for the ball, but was only able
to deflect the shot out of bounds.
Irvine regained possession with
30 seconds to play. Since the shot
clock is 35 seconds in duration,
the Anteaters were in complete
control of the game. Irvine played
thirty seconds of keep-away
before shooting the ball at an
empty net as time expired.
"I felt that the guys were play
ing hard. I really did," Dettaman
ti said. "I can't fault their effort
at all. We just didn't have it. Two
goals is never going to be enough
to win a game."
The loss to Irvine was indica
tive of the difficulties that the
Cardinal has endured for much of
the season. Paramount among
these is the inability to consis
tently produce on offense against
the top teams in the nation. The
relatively low output of goals cou
pled by a lack of what Dettamanti
described as the intangibles char
acteristic of championship teams
resulted in a disappointing sea
son.
"We were lacking that extra
ingredient that makes a differ
ence in the close games," Detta
manti said. "We didn't have that
edge that is characteristic of a
championship team, that sepa
rates it from the rest of the pack.
We were in every game this sea
son, with only one or two excep
tions. Had things gone slightly
different at critical points, every
thing might have been different.
But we were just out-played in
crucial situations."

A year marked by high expec
tations and disappointing
results came to its unfortunate
conclusion last weekend as the
Stanford men's water polo team
ended its season by finishing
sixth in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation conference
tournament, thus ending its bid
for a third consecutive national

championship.
The Cardinal (17-11, 3-5
MPSF) needed to emerge on top
of its league in order to earn one
of four berths to the NCAA
championship tournament. In a
cruel twist of fate, NCAAs are
being held at Stanford's own
DeGuerre pool this upcoming
weekend.
Entering the final day of the
tourney yesterday, the Cardinal
was already relegated to playing
for the fifth spot in the confer
