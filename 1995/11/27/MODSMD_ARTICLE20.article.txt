A year marked by high expec
tations and disappointing
results came to its unfortunate
conclusion last weekend as the
Stanford men's water polo team
ended its season by finishing
sixth in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation conference
tournament, thus ending its bid
for a third consecutive national

championship.
The Cardinal (17-11, 3-5
MPSF) needed to emerge on top
of its league in order to earn one
of four berths to the NCAA
championship tournament. In a
cruel twist of fate, NCAAs are
being held at Stanford's own
DeGuerre pool this upcoming
weekend.
Entering the final day of the
tourney yesterday, the Cardinal
was already relegated to playing
for the fifth spot in the confer
ence. The somewhat deflated
Stanford squad matched up
against a similarly uninspired
Pepperdine team.
The game, which held essen
tially no real importance, was
played in just that manner.
Head coach Dante Dettamanti
substituted heavily, even
spelling senior goalie Jack
Bowen with little-used Buzzy
Spain. After playing Pepperdine
evenly through the first half,
the Cardinal ultimately sunk
beneath the Waves, losing the
game by a score of 8-5 and run

Stanford came up short this past weekend, unable to stop
enough shots to win the MPSF tournament.
