The 1995-96 women's basket
ball campaign got off to a rocky
start this Thanksgiving weekend
as the eighth-ranked Cardinal (1-
1) dropped its first game of the
season 65-56 to Massachusetts
(1-1) on Friday before rebound
ing yesterday afternoon with a
81-58 victory over Providence
College (0-1).
UMass's upset win before a
record crowd of 4,110 at the
Mullins Center in Amherst, Mass.

marked the school's first victory
ever over a ranked team. The Min
utemen, bolstered by reserve for
ward Tez Kraft's 14 points, shot
61 percent from the field in the
second half to overcome a two
point halftiine deficit. Stanford
was held to 32 percent shooting as
junior forward Kate Starbird —
last year's leading scorer for the
Cardinal and a Naismith Award
candidate — managed just three
points on a three-pointer with
seven minutes left in the game.
"I thought UMass played an
excellent game," said Stanford
interim head coach Amy Tucker.
"They weren't intimidated at
all."
UMass's zone defense had lit
tle effect on the Cardinal early
on, as Stanford jumped out to a
24-14 lead on sophomore Naomi
Mulitauaopele's five-foot turn
around jumper with seven min
utes, 17 seconds remaining in the
first half. But that would prove

to be Stanford's biggest lead of
the night. The Cardinal could not
muster a field goal for the
remainder of the half as the Min
utemen closed to within two
points at intermission, 26-24.
The lead changed hands four
times in the second half before
Kraft's three-pointer with 12:42
left gave UMass the lead for
good. Starbird's three-pointer
with 6:58 left pulled the Cardinal
to within three, 49-46, but the
Minutemen scored the next
seven points, including five by
junior guard Sabriya Mitchell, to
take command of the game, 56-
46.
But Stanford wasn't prepared
to throw in the towel just yet.
Consecutive three-pointers by
sophomore forward Vanessa
Nygaard and senior guard Bobbie
Kelsey cut the Minuteman lead
to 59-56 with 2:03 remaining.
But UMass forward Octavia
Thomas, who racked up 12

points on the afternoon, sank a
layup with 1:38 left to secure the
win. Melissa Guerile and Beth
Kuzmeski nailed key free throws
in the final minute to put the
game on ice.
Nygaard led the Cardinal, hit
ting seven-of-15 from three-point
range en route to a career-high
25 points. Her 15 three-point
field-goal attempts tied a Stan
ford record, while the team's 30
three-point attempts broke the
old school record of 27, set in last
year's season-ending Final Four
loss to Connecticut.
"It seemed the loose balls were
pretty much theirs," said junior
point guard Jamila Wideman,
who recorded six points and five
assists in her return to her home
town of Amherst, Mass. "They
hit some shots and their confi
dence began to grow. It was con
tagious."
