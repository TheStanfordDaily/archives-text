Men's Basketball
The Stanford men's basketball department announced last Friday that the Cardinal will compete in
the Great Alaska Shootout next season for the first time. The 1996 Great Alaska Shootout is slated for
Nov. 27-30 at the Sullivan Arena in Anchorage, Alaska. The Great Alaska Shootout has evolved into one
of the premier tournaments in college basketball. Next year's eight-team field will include Stanford,
Pacific 10 Conference rival Arizona State, Kentucky (this season's No. 1 team) as well as Syracuse, Col
lege of Charleston, UNC-Greensboro, Maine and Alaska-Anchorage.
In recruiting news for the Cardinal, Mark Madsen, David Moseley and Pete Van Elswyk all signed let
ters of intent on Nov. 14. Madsen, a graduate from San Ramon Valley High School in Danville, Calif.,
originally committed to Stanford in November of 1993 and will complete his two-year Mormon mission
in July. A six-foot-nine, 230-pound power forward, Madsen draws comparisons to former Stanford Ail-
American Adam Keefe. He shot 73 percent from the floor while leading San Ramon to the semifinals of
the CIF Northern California Division II conference championships.
"I think his competitiveness and attitude standout," said Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery. "If
there's a loose ball, he gets it. He's not afraid to mix it up. You can't teach that. He has the attributes to
be an outstanding player in our program."
Moseley, a six-foot-four, 180-pounder who can play both the off-guard and small forward positions,
hails from Mayfield High School in Las Cruces, N.M., where he averaged 22 points, seven rebounds, four
assists and nearly three steals per game his junior year. He led his team to a fourth-place finish in the
state tournament.
"Stanford is the place I want to be," Moseley said. "The coaches and players are great, and Stanford
has begun to establish itself as a powerhouse in collegiate basketball."
Van Flswvk, a transfer from South Carolina, measures in at six-foot-nine, 230 pounds. The forward
started every game as a freshman and sophomore for the Fighting Gamecocks. Last season, he shot 58
percent from the floor and recorded a career-high 13 points against Clemson and 12 rebounds versus Ten
nessee. The native of Hamilton, Ontario is currently listed as a redshirt on this season's Stanford roster.
"Peter is an experienced player who played for a gieat coach, Folger, at South Carolina," Mont
gomery said. "He is a strong defender who can play forward or center.
"These three players are key components in filling the void with the graduation of our current senior
class. This is an excellent group of talented, hard-working players."
Women's Volleyball
Yesterday afternoon, the NCAA announced the pairings of the 1995 NCAA women's volleyball tour
nament, and the third-ranked Cardinal couldn't be happier. Stanford was named as the top seed in the
Pacific Region. The Cardinal will receive a first-round bye in the 48-team tournament and host a second
round match Dec. 2 against the winner of the game between Colorado and Northern lowa. If Stanford
wins that match, the Cardinal will host the Pacific Regional.
Stanford was the top seed in the entire tournament, followed by Nebraska, Hawaii and Florida. Those
three schools were named the top seeds in the other three regions.
"As far as I've seen, this is the best bracket the NCAA has come up with," said Stanford head coach
Don Shaw. "I'm glad that they decided not only to separate the top seeds, but also to give the regions
appropriately. They made it more fair by making the top-four seeds, who all draw well, the regional hosts.
. . . It's nice to know that we're going to host (the second round and the regional)."
This bit of good news was preceded by other good news. Last Monday, Cardinal senior Gary Wendell
was selected as the Pac-10 women's volleyball Player of the Year. Joining Wendell on the All-Pac-10 Team
were Cardinal sophomores Kristin Folkl and Lisa Sharpley.
