Placing in the top 5 percent of all hos
pitals in the United States, the Lucile
Salter Packard Children's Hospital at
Stanford Medical Center achieved pres
tigious commendation in its 1995 re
accreditation by the Joint Commission
on Accreditation of Healthcare Organi
zations.
The Joint Commission, an indepen
dent board of peer health-care
providers, sent a survey team to
Packard Children's Hospital this past
summer to examine and audit the orga
nization and its activities. The survey
team reviewed patient charts, patient
care plans, personnel policy, medical
records and other documentation, and
focused on how well patient care was
given.
The team awarded Packard Chil
dren's Hospital a score of 95 percent rel
ative to all other hospitals participating
in the accreditation.
"This is very prestigious," said Dawn
O'Connor, director of communications
at Packard Children's Hospital. "Not
many hospitals receive this score. We
are pretty proud of it â€” Stanford should
he proud of it. It's a real pat on the back
for the staff and physicians," she said.

But the high score will not keep the
hospital from striving for even higher
quality health care.
"We have constant checks and bal
ances," O'Connor said. "We hope to do
even better in three years. This score is
just a benchmark."
The Joint Commission was estab
lished in 1951 to improve health care
quality by holding voluntary accredita
tion procedures every three years.
Accreditation also allows hospitals to
receive state and federal funding.
"A vast majority of hospitals partici
pate in the accreditation process every
three years," O'Connor said. "The Joint
Commission is the big peer review orga
nization. When you say the Joint Com
mission is coming, people say 'Oh
wow!' " she said.
Packard Children's Hospital is an
independent 162-bed regional referral
center for children's health care at the
Stanford Medical Center.
The hospital not only cares for
patients from the immediate area, but it
also cares for children referred from
hospitals in Northern California and
from outside the state. The hospital
holds a separate license from Stanford
Medical Center, but the Stanford
Department of Pediatrics practices at
Packard.
