# Football all set for Liberty Bowl
## 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
With liberty and justice for all
— at least for the Stanford foot
ball team.
One week after being snubbed
by the Jeep / Eagle Aloha Bowl,
the Cardinal received a bid from
the St. Jude Liberty Bowl yester
day afternoon. Stanford will bat
tle East Carolina in the 37th in
stallation of the game, which will
take place at the Liberty Bowl
Memorial Stadium in Memphis,
Tenn. on Saturday, Dec. 30 at 11
a.m. CST.
"Being selected to the Liberty
Bowl is a tribute to our coaching
staff and players for the excellent
season they have had," said Stan
ford Athletic Director Ted Leland.
"I Head coach 1 Tyrone Willingham
and his staff are to be congratulat
ed for an outstanding job. We have
felt all along that this team, with a
7-3-1 record and a fourth-place
finish in the [Pacific 10 Confer
ence] deserved a bowl. I think the
Liberty Bowl has proven to be a
quality bowl and we are honored
to be playing East Carolina on
Dec. 30." '
Willingham echoed Iceland's
sentiments. "The opportunity to
get into postseason play is such a
rewarding experience for our
young men, and we look forward
to showcasing just what kind of
national program we have at Stan
ford," he said.
The Liberty Bowl berth became
available because only three
teams from the Big East qualified
for postseason play. Normally, the
spot is reserved for the fourth
place team from that conference.

The unexpected opening
proved a godsend for Stanford.
After being passed over by the
Aloha Bowl in favor of conference
rival UCLAjust a week earlier, Le
land pursued the spot in Mem-

phis.
"[The Liberty [
Bowl] was sur
prised to find it
self with an open
bid and really
didn't have a se
lection process
set up on how to
pick a team," Le
land said. "I
would say that

five or six days ago, we felt we were
the leading contender. The selec
tion committee understood what
we were offering and what kind of
team we had to put on the field. It
was just a matter of withstanding
some last-minute maneuvering on
the part of some other conferences
trying to get another team into a
bowl."
The Cardinal was selected over
a number of teams, including
Georgia, BYU, Baylor and
Louisville. Stanford will become
the first Pac-10 team to appear in
the Liberty Bowl since 1976.
"There's been an unbelievable
amount of pressure," said the Lib
erty Bowl's managing director,
Steve Erhardt. "We were the last
open spot, and there were an
awful lot of quality universities
trying to catch our eye.
"The primary factor was the
opportunity to have an East
Coast—-West Coast, national
matchup. Stanford's ranking and


Willingham
the quality of its opponents overcame good
presentations (by other schools)."
The Liberty Bowl's offer came after a
Thanksgiving weekend slate of games fell
the Cardinal's way. Texas downed Baylor,
Arizona knocked off Arizona State and
Penn State defeated Michigan State, blem
ishing the records of teams Stanford may
have been in contention with for the berth.
Regardless of the selection criteria used,
the Cardinal finds itself in its first bowl
appearance since its 1992 season finale in
the Blockbuster Bowl. Willingham, in his

game to focus on.'

first season as head coach, transformed a
team that went 3-7-1 one year ago into a
squad worthy of a bowl game.
"It's taken a great deal of support from
our administration and a great deal of
understanding from our players and coach
es that things needed to be done a little bit
differently in order for us to win," Willing
ham said. "First and foremost, though, our
players have wanted to win. We have a

great group of young men that really exem
plify what the student-athlete is all about."
While the past week has undoubtedly
seen a great deal of lobbying on the part of
the University, Leland felt that the team
was its own best spokesperson. "The
course of this season and the performance
of our athletes on the field led us to believe
that they deserved I the bowl bid]," he said.
"That's what we tried to lay in front of the
committee. I think we were successful in
that. But in terms of salesmanship, I don't
consider myself a very good salesman. I
think our team sold itself."
Stanford athletes were happy to hear
the news.
"Ever since we heard that UCLA was
going to the Aloha Bowl, I've been bracing
myself for not going to a bowl game," said
sophomore running back Anthony Book
man. "I'm happy we're going somewhere
and playing a 12th game."
At the same time, however, the bowl bid
was something the Cardinal felt it
deserved.
"It's been kind of tough to accept the
fact that it's been a debate," said sopho
more Mike Mitchell, Bookman's backfield
partner. "It's something we expected. It's
nice to hear about, though.
"Now we have one more game to focus
on. We have to prove that we deserved to go
over some of those other teams."

With liberty and justice for all
— at least for the Stanford foot
ball team.
One week after being snubbed
by the Jeep / Eagle Aloha Bowl,
the Cardinal received a bid from
the St. Jude Liberty Bowl yester
day afternoon. Stanford will bat
tle East Carolina in the 37th in
stallation of the game, which will
take place at the Liberty Bowl
Memorial Stadium in Memphis,
Tenn. on Saturday, Dec. 30 at 11
a.m. CST.
"Being selected to the Liberty
Bowl is a tribute to our coaching
staff and players for the excellent
season they have had," said Stan
ford Athletic Director Ted Leland.
"I Head coach 1 Tyrone Willingham
and his staff are to be congratulat
ed for an outstanding job. We have
felt all along that this team, with a
7-3-1 record and a fourth-place
finish in the [Pacific 10 Confer
ence] deserved a bowl. I think the
Liberty Bowl has proven to be a
quality bowl and we are honored
to be playing East Carolina on
Dec. 30." '
Willingham echoed Iceland's
sentiments. "The opportunity to
get into postseason play is such a
rewarding experience for our
young men, and we look forward
to showcasing just what kind of
national program we have at Stan
ford," he said.
The Liberty Bowl berth became
available because only three
teams from the Big East qualified
for postseason play. Normally, the
spot is reserved for the fourth
place team from that conference.

The unexpected opening
proved a godsend for Stanford.
After being passed over by the
Aloha Bowl in favor of conference
rival UCLAjust a week earlier, Le
land pursued the spot in Mem-

phis.
"[The Liberty [
Bowl] was sur
prised to find it
self with an open
bid and really
didn't have a se
lection process
set up on how to
pick a team," Le
land said. "I
would say that

five or six days ago, we felt we were
the leading contender. The selec
tion committee understood what
we were offering and what kind of
team we had to put on the field. It
was just a matter of withstanding
some last-minute maneuvering on
the part of some other conferences
trying to get another team into a
bowl."
The Cardinal was selected over
a number of teams, including
Georgia, BYU, Baylor and
Louisville. Stanford will become
the first Pac-10 team to appear in
the Liberty Bowl since 1976.
"There's been an unbelievable
amount of pressure," said the Lib
erty Bowl's managing director,
Steve Erhardt. "We were the last
open spot, and there were an
awful lot of quality universities
trying to catch our eye.
"The primary factor was the
opportunity to have an East
Coast—-West Coast, national
matchup. Stanford's ranking and

the quality of its opponents overcame good
presentations (by other schools)."
The Liberty Bowl's offer came after a
Thanksgiving weekend slate of games fell
the Cardinal's way. Texas downed Baylor,
Arizona knocked off Arizona State and
Penn State defeated Michigan State, blem
ishing the records of teams Stanford may
have been in contention with for the berth.
Regardless of the selection criteria used,
the Cardinal finds itself in its first bowl
appearance since its 1992 season finale in
the Blockbuster Bowl. Willingham, in his

first season as head coach, transformed a
team that went 3-7-1 one year ago into a
squad worthy of a bowl game.
"It's taken a great deal of support from
our administration and a great deal of
understanding from our players and coach
es that things needed to be done a little bit
differently in order for us to win," Willing
ham said. "First and foremost, though, our
players have wanted to win. We have a

great group of young men that really exem
plify what the student-athlete is all about."
While the past week has undoubtedly
seen a great deal of lobbying on the part of
the University, Leland felt that the team
was its own best spokesperson. "The
course of this season and the performance
of our athletes on the field led us to believe
that they deserved I the bowl bid]," he said.
"That's what we tried to lay in front of the
committee. I think we were successful in
that. But in terms of salesmanship, I don't
consider myself a very good salesman. I
think our team sold itself."
Stanford athletes were happy to hear
the news.
"Ever since we heard that UCLA was
going to the Aloha Bowl, I've been bracing
myself for not going to a bowl game," said
sophomore running back Anthony Book
man. "I'm happy we're going somewhere
