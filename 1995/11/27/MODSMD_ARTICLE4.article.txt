# Football all set for Liberty Bowl

With liberty and justice for all
— at least for the Stanford foot
ball team.
One week after being snubbed
by the Jeep / Eagle Aloha Bowl,
the Cardinal received a bid from
the St. Jude Liberty Bowl yester
day afternoon. Stanford will bat
tle East Carolina in the 37th in
stallation of the game, which will
take place at the Liberty Bowl
Memorial Stadium in Memphis,
Tenn. on Saturday, Dec. 30 at 11
a.m. CST.
"Being selected to the Liberty
Bowl is a tribute to our coaching
staff and players for the excellent
season they have had," said Stan
ford Athletic Director Ted Leland.
"I Head coach 1 Tyrone Willingham
and his staff are to be congratulat
ed for an outstanding job. We have
felt all along that this team, with a
7-3-1 record and a fourth-place
finish in the [Pacific 10 Confer
ence] deserved a bowl. I think the
Liberty Bowl has proven to be a
quality bowl and we are honored
to be playing East Carolina on
Dec. 30." '
Willingham echoed Iceland's
sentiments. "The opportunity to
get into postseason play is such a
rewarding experience for our
young men, and we look forward
to showcasing just what kind of
national program we have at Stan
ford," he said.
The Liberty Bowl berth became
available because only three
teams from the Big East qualified
for postseason play. Normally, the
spot is reserved for the fourth
place team from that conference.

The unexpected opening
proved a godsend for Stanford.
After being passed over by the
Aloha Bowl in favor of conference
rival UCLAjust a week earlier, Le
land pursued the spot in Mem-

phis.
"[The Liberty [
Bowl] was sur
prised to find it
self with an open
bid and really
didn't have a se
lection process
set up on how to
pick a team," Le
land said. "I
would say that

five or six days ago, we felt we were
the leading contender. The selec
tion committee understood what
we were offering and what kind of
team we had to put on the field. It
was just a matter of withstanding
some last-minute maneuvering on
the part of some other conferences
trying to get another team into a
bowl."
The Cardinal was selected over
a number of teams, including
Georgia, BYU, Baylor and
Louisville. Stanford will become
the first Pac-10 team to appear in
the Liberty Bowl since 1976.
"There's been an unbelievable
amount of pressure," said the Lib
erty Bowl's managing director,
Steve Erhardt. "We were the last
open spot, and there were an
awful lot of quality universities
trying to catch our eye.
"The primary factor was the
opportunity to have an East
Coast—-West Coast, national
matchup. Stanford's ranking and
