# Wise words: Steele's strategy for change
## 
### Tracy Jan Contributing writer 
Schools have got to "wisen"
up in the way they treat lender
achieving students, according
to a study by Psychology Prof.
Claude Steele.
Women and some minorities
are still not succeeding to their
potential in school, Steele said.
Put by using teaching methods
that are "wise," schools can re
duce the influence of stereo
types and help students reach
for higher goals.
According to a recent
Newsweek article featuring
Steele, the national dropout
rate for African Americans is
nearly 70 percent, while for
whites it is 40 percent.
In addition to structural and
societal disadvantages that
keep many women and minori
ties away from educational op
portunities, Steele concluded in
his study at the University of
Michigan that "stereotype vul
nerability" is an important fac
tor in classroom success.
Stereotype vulnerability is

the apprehension a person can
feel when placed in a situation
knowing he or she could be
judged stereotypically, usually
because of gender or race. For
example, a woman is under a
negative stereotype when she is
in a math class, Steele said.
"The negative stereotype
about a group is relevant to her
performance," he said. "It
makes her uncomfortable, and
those emotions can interfere
with her actual performance.
In the long run, the experience
will make her want to avoid
that domain of activity."
Steele used the term "wise
schooling" in reference to the
general strategy in changing
the academic setting to reduce
the sense of being threatened
under the judgmental eye of the
stereotype.
According to Steele, one is
"wise" if one possesses the abil
ity to look beyond any stereo
type and see the person as an
individual.
"[Wise] is what schooling

has to be in order to be effective with
groups who are stereotyped," Steele said.
"It protects [students] from confirming the
stereotype over their heads."
From the study at the University of
Michigan started in 1991, Steele was able
to define some "wise schooling tactics."
"Ability-stigmatized groups have an
extra burden to contend with in the
classroom. Even when everything is
scrupulously equal in the classroom,
their abilities are put under suspicion,"
he said.
These "wise schooling" techniques can
be used on all students but have the special
effect of lifting the burdens on the stigma
tized students.
First, educators should present intelli
gence as an expandable capacity as opposed
to a fixed, limiting entity, he said.
"Doing so makes failure less intimidat
ing. [A teacher] should present math abili
ty as something you can get better at with
work and immersion in the field," Steele
continued.
Ciood relationships between students
and adults in the academic setting is anoth
er factor. According to Steele, the adult is
essentially saying to the student, "I believe
you have the potential to succeed here. You
have potential worth my time invest
ment."
A third factor is challenge. "Educators
should assign demanding work as opposed
to remediating work. Asking a lot of some

one is a compelling way of conveying faith
in their potential. Failure can be more
compellingly attributed to the difficulty of
the material, than to the ability of the stu
dent. And success, against demanding
odds, gets attributed to the self," Steele
said.
A well-known example is the movie
"Stand and Deliver" in which teacher
Jaime Escalante uses challenge as a cent ral
tactic in teaching calculus to East Los
Angeles high school students, enabling
most to score well on the College Advanced
Placement exam.
Group study, the fourth tactic in "wise
schooling," reduces one's sense of threat.
"Nobody knows everything but everyone
usually knows a little of something," Steele
said.
The University of Michigan started an
academic program a few years ago that has
been designed to make the freshman expe
rience for selected students "wiser." The
program integrates 250 freshmen, 40 per
cent of'which are black, 40 percent are non
black minorities and 20 percent are white.
In this transition program, students are
randomly selected among those admitted
to the university. Using "wise techniques,"
the students are recruited honorifically,
stressing their potential for success.
The students are encouraged to study in
groups, and optional challenge workshops
in calculus, physics, chemistry and writing
are set up to go beyond the work of the
course to which it is related. Academic abil
ity is also presented as an expandable qual
ity, something one am get tetter at by
using it.
These students all live together in the

same dorm to form a community of shared
values by integrating academics into the
rest of their lives.
Steele believes that residential educa
tion is very fundamental to academic life at
a school because it encourages cross-cul
tural communication.
"What really educates students is other
students," he said. "The level of perfor
mance that you reach is related to people's
outlooks around you. Residential educa
tion gets the academic value system into
the student's life, and that Ls what makes a
first class school."
Compared to randomly assigned control
groups, the students in the "wise" pro
gram, especially minorities, achieved much
better grades and retention rate, Steele
said.
"Wise" schooling is very feasible and
inexpensive to implant in a school's educa
tional system. "Stereotype threat is a
problem everywhere in our society. Stan
ford already uses many of these 'wise'
schooling techniques. An educated univer
sity invests in the residential experience of
the students, which increases the intellec
tual quality of that school," Steele said.
To students who may not have the ben
efits of "wise" schooling, Steele advised
hard work, preparation and (he fundamen
tal ingredient — taking responsibility for
one's success in learning. I le stressed that
frustration is not a sign of inability but a
sign that more work will help.
"I want you to relax, but don't make a
mistake," Steele said, quoting Fred Astaire
to Ginger Rogers before going out onto the
dance floor. "Work hard but not compul
sively."
