# Wise words: Steele's strategy for change

Schools have got to "wisen"
up in the way they treat lender
achieving students, according
to a study by Psychology Prof.
Claude Steele.
Women and some minorities
are still not succeeding to their
potential in school, Steele said.
Put by using teaching methods
that are "wise," schools can re
duce the influence of stereo
types and help students reach
for higher goals.
According to a recent
Newsweek article featuring
Steele, the national dropout
rate for African Americans is
nearly 70 percent, while for
whites it is 40 percent.
In addition to structural and
societal disadvantages that
keep many women and minori
ties away from educational op
portunities, Steele concluded in
his study at the University of
Michigan that "stereotype vul
nerability" is an important fac
tor in classroom success.
Stereotype vulnerability is

the apprehension a person can
feel when placed in a situation
knowing he or she could be
judged stereotypically, usually
because of gender or race. For
example, a woman is under a
negative stereotype when she is
in a math class, Steele said.
"The negative stereotype
about a group is relevant to her
performance," he said. "It
makes her uncomfortable, and
those emotions can interfere
with her actual performance.
In the long run, the experience
will make her want to avoid
that domain of activity."
Steele used the term "wise
schooling" in reference to the
general strategy in changing
the academic setting to reduce
the sense of being threatened
under the judgmental eye of the
stereotype.
According to Steele, one is
"wise" if one possesses the abil
ity to look beyond any stereo
type and see the person as an
individual.
