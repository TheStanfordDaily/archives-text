# Teaching Award planned by ASSU
## 
### Bimal Shah 
In an effort to provide students
the chance to recognize professors
for superior teaching, the first
ASSU Council of Presidents
Teaching Award will be given this
spring. One professor will be se
lected each year to receive the
honor, which awards at least $500.
The accolade is the first of its
kind. "There are awards given by
faculty to faculty and by adminis-

tration to faculty which allow some student input,
but nothing that gives students a voice of their own,"
according to Angela Parker, ASSU senator and mem
ber of the ASSU's Committee on Academics, Re
search and Evaluation (CARE).
"The award gives students an opportunity to rec
ognize good teaching on campus," said COP member
Rich Stolz. "Students will be able to tell teachers
what works, what sorts of techniques are especially
appreciated."
In line with the ASSU's attempt to utilize the In
ternet in its student information and services, the
nomination forms for the award are already available
on the World Wide Web. The forms, which can be
found in the Virtual Directory — another ASSU pro
ject — can be completed and transmitted directly via
the Internet or submitted in person at the ASSU of-

fices.
Students will be asked to
describe the qualities that make
the professor they are nominat
ing an excellent teacher — specif
ically what the instructor does to
be inspiring, interesting, engag
ing and accessible.
While the ASSU Senate has
not finished working out the
details of the selection process, a
special committee will be set up
to collect and evaluate the nomi
nations that students send in,
said Julian Castro, ASSU senator
and chair of CARE.
The committee will be com
posed of two ASSU senators and
three students chosen at large by
the ASSU Nominations Commis
sion, said Stolz.
"It will be purely a student
thing in choosing winners," he
said.

The award is part of the
ASSU's efforts to help the Uni
versity in its overall attempts to
improve teaching and advising.
According to Stolz, other
ASSU projects include putting
together a course evaluation
guide and rewriting the evalua
tion sheet used by the School of
Humanities and Sciences. A simi
lar award might also be created
for advisers.
Those involved in establishing
the award have high expectations
for its impact. Castro said he
wants the honor to be "some
thing [professors can] point to
when up for tenure."
Parker similarly "hopes that it
will go in [the professors'] files."
"The award shows that teach
ing is a priority for us," she said.
"Without good teaching, the pur
pose of the University goes down
hill."
