## No renegotiation on Bosnia treaty 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Dayton
treaty on Bosnia is final, senior Ameri
can officials said yesterday in rejecting
demands from Bosnian Serbs that provi
sions relating to the future of Sarajevo
be changed.
"We are not going to renegotiate this
agreement," Defense Secretary William
Perry said of the pact worked out last
week in Dayton, Ohio, with the presi
dents of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia.
Perry, chief U.S. negotiator Richard
Holbrooke and National Security Advis
er Anthony Lake appeared yesterday on
news programs as a prelude to President
Clinton's speech tonight in which he
hopes to win public and congressional
support for his Bosnia policy.
Congressional Republicans have led
the opposition to Clinton's plans to con
tribute 20,000 U.S. ground forces to a
60,000-member NATO peacekeeping
force. But two key Republicans on the
Senate Armed Services Committee sug
gested that the traditional tendency of
Congress to follow the president's lead

on major foreign policy issues might
again prevail.
Congress hasn't defied a president on
military matters since it cut off funding
for the bombing in Cambodia in 1974,
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on CBS'
"Face the Nation." "I think the presi
dent can make the case."
Thousands of Bosnian Serbs in the
capital of Sarajevo have protested the
peace accord, which cedes control of
their sector of the city to the Muslim-
Croat federation. Bosnian Serb Presi
dent Radovan Karadzic said yesterday
that "a new solution for Sarajevo must
be found" and that in the meantime,
Serbs would not withdraw their troops.
Perry, also appearing on CBS, said
such protests were expected, but
stressed that the terms of the treaty are
final and that "we fully expect that there
will be compliance" from the Serbs as
well as the other parties.
Holbrooke, an assistant secretary of
state, also insisted on NBC's "Meet the
Press" that the Serb leadership has

accepted the pact. "Dayton was an ini
tialing, Paris will be a signing. There
will be no change between Dayton and
Paris."
Lake, speaking on ABC's "This Week
With David Brinkley," said that the
Paris meeting to formally sign the
accord would take place in mid-Decem
ber and that U.S. troops could be in
Bosnia a few days after that.
The three administration officials,
echoing Clinton's Saturday radio
address, were also united in their mes
sage that American values were at stake
in the commitment to join NATO in
keeping peace in Bosnia.
"Our values really are at stake here."
Lake said, saying that in addition to
maintaining the integrity of NATO and
stopping the war from spreading to
other countries, Americans can't turn
their backs on the reality that half the
people in Bosnia have either been
uprooted from their homes or killed
since the civil strife began more than
three years ago.
