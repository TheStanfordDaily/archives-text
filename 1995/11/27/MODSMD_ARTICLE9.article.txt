# Confronting mental health
## Survivors underwent needless treatments 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli authorities may
have needlessly kept hundreds of Holocaust sur
vivors in psychiatric hospitals for nearly half a
century, health officials admitted yesterday.
Dr. Motti Mark, head of the Health Ministry's
mental health department, said 900 people —
nearly a fifth of Israel's institutionalized mental
patients — were Holocaust survivors.
Most arrived without families in the late 1940s
and were hospitalized immediately for depression
and a variety of other trauma-related illnesses.
With more sophisticated treatment, Mark admit
ted, some might have been able to begin normal
lives.
"It definitely did not have to be like this," he
said. "These people came to Israel alone and got
help, but when the treatment ended there was
nobody outside to receive and support them. . . .
We, Israeli society, did not become their families."
A report on Israel's Channel 2 television Sat
urday alleged systematic, decades-long negligence
in dealing with the trauma of some immigrants
who had survived Nazi Germany's slaughter of
millions of Jews.
Mark attributed the neglect to a longstanding
failure to confront mental heath issues despite
Israel's emphasis on studying the history and
lessons of the Holocaust.
Dr. Henry Schorr, head of the outpatient clinic
in the Abarbanel mental hospital near Tel Aviv,
said many patients' official files did not even men
tion that they were Holocaust survivors.
Schorr said there was "a conspiracy of silence"
among health authorities that kept the issue out
uf public scrutiny.
In the TV report, workers at the hospitals said
that in many cases the hospitalizations appeared
unnecessary.
"I have the impression that people were hospi
talized for long periods of time without any spe
cific treatment or check of their progress," said
Pnina Turner, a social worker at Abarbanel.
Mark said the Health Ministry plans to build
special hostels to enable about 300 patients to live
outside the hospitals and still receive some psy
chological and medical services.
