$200,
PRIZE
For years, I have been saying that the U.S. Budget cannot he balanced
over an extended period of time in the absence of a trade surplus.
One way to understand this is to realize that most "spending cuts" are
essentially tax increases. For example, reducing spending on the elderly
by $10 billion is roughly the same as raising their taxes by $10 billion.
And if the elderly have $10 billion/year less to spend, they will buy
roughly $10 billion/year less from the rest of America, which will cause
the after-tax income of others outside of the elderly group to decrease
as well.
CHALLENGE to all economists and proponents of a balanced
budget: $200,000 to the first person who explains why the article
"Analyzing the Economy with Poker" is incorrect in a broad sense.
This article, which is available without charge by calling 800-666-3903
or writing to Box 7634, Beverly Hills, CA 90212, explains that a) there
are three types of wealth: real assets, stocks, and net non-stock Financial
assets. Focusing on net non-stock financial assets, b) above-average
income Americans must increase net non-stock 112 inancial assets each
year in order to have a substantial incentive to produce and innovate, c)
this "win" must come at the expense of either the below-average income
class, the U.S. Government, or foreigners, d) since we are running a
current account deficit (losing to foreigners), and the below-average
income class has limited resources, the only entity that can "keep losing
indefinitely" to fund the needed gains of the above-average income
class is the Government. In other words, balance the budget for a
prolonged period in the absence of a current account surplus and
Americans will not increase net non-stock financial assets after taxes
and will have little incentive to produce anil innovate. With less
incentive, production of real assets would decline, as would in all
probability, stock prices. So the best way to attack budget deficit growth
is to try to improve the trade deficit. It is no accident that most world
governments have been running deficits for many years. If world
governments as a group ran a balanced budget, the world-non
government sector could not increase net-non-stock financial assets
anil would have much less incentive to produce and innovate.
