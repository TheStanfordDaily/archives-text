# Bookstore costs climb
## Still paying for fraud case 
### David Stein Contributing writer 
Stanford Bookstore earnings last year continued to
suffer from a tax-evasion scandal involving former
managers, according to financial statements.
Nonetheless, it was a commitment to service and a
slide in retail sales which accounted for the Bookstore's
deficit for the 1995 fiscal year and its scaled-down re
bates, according to Bookstore President and CEO
Peggy Mendelson. The statements were released in ac
cordance with the Bookstore's bylaws.
In contrast to the previous year, in which the Book
store had a surplus of funds, the non-profit enterprise
reported losses of $619,891 this year.
Contributing to the deficit were the Bookstore's
back taxes and fees owed to the Internal Revenue Ser
vice due to improper financial dealings three years ago.
In 1992, three former Bookstore managers' stock
losses were not reported to the IRS, resulting in late
fees that were paid in the past year.
But insurance payments totaling $905,422 also
were paid to the Bookstore last fiscal year, offsetting
the losses from the managers' illegal de;ilings.
No book rebates should have been given at all con
sidering the fmancial situation, Mendelson said. In
stead, the store's board of directors reduced the rebate
rate to 6 percent, instead of the 15 percent given in the
past three years.
According to Mendelson, the trend is likely to con
tinue. "While we expect a surplus next year and a larg
er book rebate, the 15 percent figure is absolutely not i n
the ballpark," Mendelson said.
She and other board members felt they had a re
sponsibility to the students to return some of their
money, she said. The 800 l store gives rebates for most
book purchases, as long as receipts are turned in to the
Bookstore before the end of t he school year.
Bookstore financial statements show that increases
in emolovee costs and o Derating expenses resulted in
the deficit.
While health care costs and
the opening of an off-campus
branch raised employee fees con
siderably, the Bookstore's dedi
cation to helping its customers
was the main reason for the
expenditures, said Mendelson.
Employee costs went up from
$6,851,498 in 1994 to
$7,376,443 last year — a
$524,945 increase.
"One of my main goals is to
improve service in the store,"
Mendelson said. "We've added
more cashiers so the registers
won't be as busy and a public
events coordinator who works
out the author events, which
take a lot of time."
Several accounting positions
were also added "so this type of
financial problem doesn't hap

pen again," she added.
Aside from the other
expense, "soft sales" did not
help the Bookstore, Mendelson
said. She said some goods, such
as T-shirts and sweatshirts, did
not sell as well as in previous
years.
While sales increased from
$49,149,353 in 1994 to
$50,336,228 last year, the cost of
those goods also increased — to
$38,953,856 from $37,283,274.
Students and Bookstore offi
cials will have a chance to dis
cuss the financial reports Dec. 6,
when the Bookstore hosts an
informational meeting at the
Law School.
Bookstore Events Coordina
tor Tricia Keady said the meet
ing will be a question-and
answer session for members of
the Stanford community.
"It will be an opportunity for
everyone to find out about the
Bookstore and offer sugges
tions," Keadv said.
