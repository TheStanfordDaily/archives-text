# Bookstore costs climb
## Still paying for fraud case 
### David Stein Contributing writer 
Stanford Bookstore earnings last year continued to
suffer from a tax-evasion scandal involving former
managers, according to financial statements.
Nonetheless, it was a commitment to service and a
slide in retail sales which accounted for the Bookstore's
deficit for the 1995 fiscal year and its scaled-down re
bates, according to Bookstore President and CEO
Peggy Mendelson. The statements were released in ac
cordance with the Bookstore's bylaws.
In contrast to the previous year, in which the Book
store had a surplus of funds, the non-profit enterprise
reported losses of $619,891 this year.
Contributing to the deficit were the Bookstore's
back taxes and fees owed to the Internal Revenue Ser

In 1992, three former Bookstore managers' stock
losses were not reported to the IRS, resulting in late
fees that were paid in the past year.
But insurance payments totaling $905,422 also
were paid to the Bookstore last fiscal year, offsetting
the losses from the managers' illegal de;ilings.

rate to 6 percent, instead of the 15 percent given in the
past three years.

the ballpark," Mendelson said.
She and other board members felt they had a re
