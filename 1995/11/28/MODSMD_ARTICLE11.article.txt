## Clinton asks public to support sending troops to Bosnia 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Seeking sup
port for a risky military mission, Presi
dent Clinton last night presented his case
for sending 20,000 U.S. troops to enforce
a fragile peace treaty in Bosnia. "In the
choice between peace and war," Clinton
declared, "America must choose peace."
Without American force, "the war will
reignite. The slaughter of innocents will
begin again," he said.
Despite misgivings, it appeared
Congress would give Clinton his way.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said he
believed in the constitutional authority of
the president and added, "No doubt about
it, whether Congress agrees or not, troops
will go to Bosnia."
In a prime-time address from the Oval
Office, Clinton acknowledged American
troops will face danger and he assumed

"full responsibility" for any casualties.
However, he laid down a marker to any
one threatening the peacekeepers:
"America protects its own. Anyone —
anyone — who takes on our troops will
suffer the consequences. We will fight fire
with fire and then some."
He said a small number of American
troops would go into Bosnia sometime
next week to lay the groundwork for
thousands more to come, probably before
Christmas.
"Let us lead," Clinton implored in a 20-
minute speech delivered in somber tones.
"That is our responsibility as Ameri
cans."
Clinton pledged that the U.S. mission
— expected to last up to a year — would
be limited, focused and under the com
mand of an American general.

"America cannot and must not be the
world's policemen," he said. "We cannot
stop all war for all time but we can stop
some wars. We cannot save all women and
all children but we can save many of
them. We can't do everything but we
must do what we can do.
"My fellow Americans, in this new era,
there are still times when America — and
America alone — can and should make
the difference for peace."
Clinton's address kicked off an intense
administration campaign to break down
skepticism to what Pentagon planners
regard as the most dangerous U.S. mili
tary operation since the Persian Gulf War.
The American troops would be part of
a 60,000-man NATO force enforcing a
600-mile long separation zone between
the warring factions. Headquartered in

Tuzla in northeast Bosnia, the Americans
would be deployed in a mountainous,
mine-strewn countryside in harsh winter
conditions.
The dangers would be compounded by
the bitter ethnic rivalries and suspicions
that tore apart Yugoslavia. To some in
Bosnia, the NATO troops are more likely
to be seen as an unwelcome occupying
force than as peacekeeping saviors.
The mission comes on the heels of an
agreement signed in Dayton, Ohio, last
week to stop the bloodiest fighting in
Europe since World War 11, claiming
250,000 lives.
Clinton had promised to seek
Congress' support for the mission, but
made clear he would invoke his powers as
commander in chief to deploy the forces
even if lawmakers resisted.
