# Gingrich rules out run for president
## Speaker cites obligations in Capitol but seems likely to influence race 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Newt Gin
grich ruled out a 1996 presidential run yesterday, leav
ing a clearly defined field to fight for the GOP nomina
tion and little doubt the speaker will himself be a cam
paign issue.
It had long been clear that Gingrich was unlikely to
join the presidential race, but not until yesterday did he
slam shut the door. He said he would not endorse a can
didate, but hoped to serve as chairman of the Republi
can convention next August in San Diego.
Explaining his decision, Gingrich listed the daunting
challenge he faces in trying to shepherd a balanced bud
get through Congress, calling it "one of the most impor
tant decisions we've made in domestic government in
the last 60 years."
But political calculations also played a part. lowa's
caucuses and New Hampshire's primary are less than
three months away, followed by a blizzard of early pri
maries.
"I didn't see how I could be both Speaker of the
House and run a campaign of that scale," Gingrich said.
His decision — and that of retired Gen. Colin Powell
not to run — leaves the GOP field with a clear front
runner, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. Texas Sen.
Phil Gramm, former Tennessee Gov. I,amar Alexander,
publisher Steve Forbes and commentator Pat
Buchanan are among those clamoring for an opening or
a Dole stumble.
Nonetheless, there is plenty of grumbling within the
GOP ranks and beyond.
Supporters of Jack Kemp and Bill Bennett have been

complaining about the quality of the GOP field, but
both men have refused to reconsider their decisions not
to run.
Ross Perot's organization is moving ahead with its
effort to form a new party and could field a presidential
candidate. Two-time Democratic candidate Jesse Jack
son hasn't ruled out an independent bid.
And a group of seven political figures has been talk
ing about the possibility of backing an independent bid.
The group, including retiring Democratic Sen. Bill
Bradley and former Democratic presidential candidates
Gaiy Hart and Paul Tsongas, is seen as more likely to
try to shape other 1996 campaigns with their issue
stands.
Given all this, Gingrich held out the possibility that
America still could "have the wildest presidential cam
paign you have seen in a very long time."
While he will not be a candidate for anything except
his House seat, Gingrich will not disappear as a nation
al campaign issue.
He returned to Washington yesterday to plunge into
several major policy skirmishes, including negotiations
with Clinton over a balanced budget and the debate
over deploying U.S. troops in the former Yugoslavia. I le
also faces intensifying Democratic pressure for a specuil
prosecutor to investigate myriad ethics allegations
against him.
Democrats already have made Gingrich the star of
party fund-raising appeals. They used him, with some
apparent success, as an issue in races thus year in New
Jersey and Kentucky.
