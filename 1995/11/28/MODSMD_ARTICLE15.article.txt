## Seasons greetings? 
### 
THE MERCHANTS AT the
Stanford Shopping Center
got off to an early start this
year with their Christmas decora
tions. Two weeks before Thanks
giving, the shopping center already
looked like Santa's cottage at the
North Pole, complete with Christ
mas trees, tinsel, multi-colored
lights, wrapped gifts and reindeer.
It's a pity that the merchants could
not find somebody to make artifi
cial snow.
Gearing up for the make-or
break shopping season so far in
advance makes one wonder
whether it is possible to go too far.
The shopping center uses the deco
rations to get shoppers into the
spirit of peace, love and most of all,
spending. The real motivation for
the early decorations is to get all of
us in the shopping frame of mind.
After all, what is Christmas with
out buying gifts?
Every year, it seems as if mer
chants are lurching ever earlier in

their bid to start the holiday shop
ping season. It is conceivable that
Christmas would start in July, if it
weren't for the fact that the Inde
pendence Day and Labor Day sales
got in the way.
Everybody knows that the win
ter holidays are rapidly approach
ing. People need not be reminded
with decorations about Christmas
two months before it occurs. Unfor
tunately, the blatant commercial
ism of the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter is typical of merchants vying for
business.
The early decorations may have
a negative effect upon customers
annoyed by zealous merchants. But
worry not, merchants. Customers
will start buying gifts for the holi
days once December starts. If this
Thanksgiving weekend's crowds
were an indication, merchants will
do quite well. There is little reason
to rush customers into gift-buying
sprees with Christmas decorations
in the beginning of November.
