# No more surprises
## 
### 
CHANGING A LONG stand
ing tradition, the University
just admitted its first batch
of early applicants. Another
change the University should con
sider eliminating is its anonymous
freshman roommate policy.
Do you like to be surprised?
Apparently, that is what the Univer
sity believe first-year students want
when it comes to their roommates.
The University should put togeth
er short biographies of first-years
and include them with Orientation
packets for new students. Stanford is
in the minority by not revealing the
identities of roommates, preferring
instead to keep freshmen and trans
fers in suspense until they step on
campus. This plan has many practi
cal drawbacks.
One common complaint of
incoming students is that they can
not effectively plan ahead. How
many times have roommates shown
up with two sets of stereos or
phones? Or worse, how many were

left in a bind when one roommate
assumed that the other would bring
a phone or a stereo but did not?
Receiving early information,
incoming freshmen would know
some of their roommate's prefer
ences and dislikes and could pre
pare themselves accordingly. Since
nearly 40 percent of Stanford's
entering class hails from Califor
nia, chances are that some could
even meet beforehand.
Even if Orientation organizers
do not send out biographies, they
should at least allow students who
ask to find out their roommate's
address and phone number. The
secrecy preserved now is neither
constructive nor helpful.
Friendships that can last a life
time should get off on the right
foot. Coordinators of Orientation
Week should reveal the identifies
of roommates and send out infor
mation to help acquaint prospec
tive roommates before they arrive
on campus.
