THE CONCEPT OF the quarter sys
tem is good. But the way it is imple
mented at Stanford sucks.
If you are like most Stanford students,
you are stressed out about one of the fol
lowing things: your required reading, your
research paper, your upcoming finals or a
combination of all three. Of course, I'm not
saying that you weren't stressed out last
week or the week before. On the contrary,
most of us begin stressing out by the third
week of every quarter.
If I thought that our stress was due to
the fact that we learn more, I wouldn't
complain. But are we really learning more?
Do we really take in 18 weeks of knowledge
when our professors cram it into nine
weeks? A common response to this ques
tion will point to Stanford students' ability
to do the 18 weeks of work in half the time.
Therefore, the argument goes, if wa can do
it, then why not make us do it?
At issue is the discrepancy between
one's ability to learn material and recall it
for a midterm two weeks later and one's
ability to understand fully and remember
the same material two years after that.
Think of a class you took two years ago.
Now try to recall the major themes of the
class. Try to recall all of what you learned
in those 10 weeks. If you come up empty,
don't blame yourself. Blame Stanford's
cram-everything-in-half-the-time quarter
system.
How many times has a professor started

a lecture by saying, "We have a lot to
cover," or "Because we're behind, I only
have 20 minutes to go over Karl Marx?"
Many professors speak of the speed of their
class and their abundance of material with
pride and arrogance. I remember when my
Econ 1 professor bragged in his first lec
ture about how his class covers in one
quarter what other college classes cover in
an entire year.
Great, but today I couldn't calculate the
marginal propensity to consume if my life
depended on it.
To fix the quarter system, we need to
limit the scope of classes so that professors
can handle the material with the depth and
respect the material deserves. One of my
biggest disappointments from last year
came from English 161C — 20t.h Century
African American Fiction. The class was
good overall, but its slipshod treatment of
Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man," one of my
favorite books, let me down. I learned more
about the book in high school, where my
class spent a month on the work. In con
trast, 161C "covered" the 500-page mas
terpiece in three lectures.
Some might contend that by removing
one work to spend more time on another,
we would learn less. I argue that we would
learn more. True, that would lighten our
burden by requiring less reading, but we
come here to learn, not to prove how much
work we can do.
If a class cannot reasonably part ition its

material into 10 weeks, it should split into
A and B classes. It isn't possible to cover
a century's worth of African-American fic
tion in a thorough and respectable way in
only ten weeks. Why not divide the class
into English 161C-A and English 161C-B?
The CIV program provides the clearest
examples of how classes are failing us. Ask
a junior to name some of the 40 books he
read for CIV and he'll likely answer you
with a blank stare. If you're only going to
spend a week on Marx, Freud, Plato or
Nietzsche, you might as well not spend any
time on them at all. While administrators
try to solve CIV by using different works,
they are ignoring the best solution — use
less works.
Quarters can only work if they aren't
treated like semesters. If professors
reduced the scope of their classes by one
third, although we may do less work, we
would learn much more. Instead of scrap
ing the surface of everything, we could sub
merge ourselves into two-thirds of every
thing. Spend more than a week on Marx or
Hegel or Ellison? What a marvelous idea!
Who knows? If you're lucky, you might
actually remember something from one of
your classes two years after you graduate.

Mr. Small says he can't recall anything
worth mentioning from CIV.
