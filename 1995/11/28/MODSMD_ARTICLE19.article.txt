One professor's predictions for the new year

A FEW YEAR-END predictions: 1.
Bosnia: Senators Hob Kerrey and
Dick Lugar got it right — a real
commitment to leadership of the West in
that hot-spot requires more spine, more
troops and no deadlines. Given the fate
ful historical situation in the Balkans
and surroundings (recalling the 1930s
and ostrich policies in Europe), Clinton's
political character precludes an adequate
response and solidly meaningful out
come. Farther, given a very possible
number of American casualties, his re
election is in jeopardy, for the wrong
reasons.
2. Domestic Policy: The deep and
broad tide of history calls for wide-rang
ing spending cuts and a balanced budget
to leave to our heirs. Again, supported

by feckless mass opinion, in a fool's par
adise, Clinton is taking a demagogic
political stand which will leave the coun
try in poor economic and moral shape.
3. Affirmative Action: Affirmative
action represents an ideological choice
for egalitarianism and fairness without
equity (bringing in the dimension of
merit and talent), i.e. clumsy human
engineering a la the Soviet Union, which
goes against real human nature (semi-
Darwinian, semi-considerate) and
achievement in an open market of com
petition, local and international. It is
doomed.
4. Multiculturalism: Multiculturalism
represents a ganging up of marginal
folks, resentful losers and loser groups
(gangs), together with soft-headed liber

als (often guilt-ridden Wasps or rational
istic and parochial Jews) against cultural
excellence. Few classy people, including
dignified liberals (e.g. Arthur
Schlesinger, Jr.), are for it now. Most
campus administrators, who often don't
believe in it (e.g. University President
Gerhard Casper), don't have the guts to
fight against if for low-level political rea
sons — a big percentage of faculty are
off-the-wall liberals, many left over from
the radical '60s.
5. Princess Di Soap-Oprah Confes
sions: The collapse of monarchic honor
and duty and the pivoting on the part of
the principals, who were paid to know
better, into an all-flattening attitude of
mass mind, predicted by Ortega, bodes
ill not only for the royal institution but

also for the general distinction of British
society. We are going through the same
shameless televised mediocritization
outside of monarchy. Well, at least we
respect Colin Powell.
6. Gender Feminism: The growing cri
sis of responsibility, on home and for
eign fronts, calling for seriousness and
sacrifice on the wintry battlefield and a
more tough-minded approach to welfare
and the behavior of the nation's chil
dren, causes well-known commentators
now to speak of Father values and con
cerns as well as Mother ones. That will
help to undo the sillier and more
destructive sorts of feminism. Well,
maybe not on campuses.
