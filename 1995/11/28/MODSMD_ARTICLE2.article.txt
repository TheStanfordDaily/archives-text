# Majority at Stanford is uninvolved
## Poll reveals little interest in public service, social groups 
### Sonia M. Giordani Staff writer 
Stanford students are less in
clined to participate in community
service groups and activities now
than they were prior to coming to
Stanford, according to a poll con
ducted last week by The Daily.
Although 77 percent said they
were involved in community ser
vice before coming to Stanford,
only 35 percent said they are cur
rently involved in community ser
vice groups or activities.
A total of 374 randomly select
ed undergraduate and graduate
students participated in the tele
phone poll, comprised of 18 ques
tions.
Less than half of those polled
said they were active participants
of any organized student group on
campus, including athletic, ser
vice and other social groups. While
171 said they were actively in
volved in such groups, 203 — or 54
percent — said they were not.
Asked to rate the extent to
which campus groups represent
their interests on a scale of 1 to 5
— with 1 being "not at all" and 5
being "very much so" — 38 per
cent of the students polled re
sponded with a 3.
However, 25 percent answered
with a 4, suggesting that at least
one quarter of students find some
of the 349 student groups current
ly registered on campus to be rep

resentative of their interests.
Another set of questions aimed
at measuring student awareness
of controversial issues at Stan
ford. When asked to rate how in
formed they felt regarding cam
pus issues, most respondents
opted again for the non-committal
number 3. While 145 did not con
sider themselves to be very in
formed, 137 chose the middle op
tion, and 92 said they were quite
informed.
When asked how informed
they thought other Stanford stu
dents are regarding campus is
sues, 56 percent responded with a
3, while only 87 students — 23
percent — chose 4 or 5.
Questions about three campus
issues that continue to be debated
highlighted the inclination toward
apathy that appears to pervade
the campus.
Students were asked to say
whether they were for, against, in
different or undecided on the
grape boycott, the closing of the
Food Research Institute and affir
mative action.
As many students said they
were for a campus boycott of
grapes as said they were indiffer
ent, so that each category account
ed for 29 percent of those polled.
18 percent chose the "undecided"
option.
