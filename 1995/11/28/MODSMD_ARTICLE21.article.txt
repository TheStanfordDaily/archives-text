## Revising Stanford's sexual harassment policy Harassment policy made unnecessary modifications 
### 
THE WOMEN'S collective
applauds the University's
efforts to revise the exist
ing sexual harassment policy.
However, it is precisely because
this document will affect so many
members of the Stanford commu
nity that we feel it is necessary to
voice our concerns.
First, the revisions to the sec
tion defining sexual harassment
itself weaken the 1993 policy, an
act which is unnecessary and dan
gerous. The 1993 policy states
that sexual harassment "has the
purpose or effect of interfering
with an individual's academic or
work performance." The new
draft policy states that sexual
harassment "has the purpose or
effect of unreasonably interfering
with an individual's academic or
work performance."

To allow ... room for
interpretation... by a
third party is to allow a
wavering standard of
judgment.'

The conspicuous addition of
the word "unreasonably" seems to
imply tolerance for whatever
behavior might be deemed "rea
sonable" harassment. Such an
implied tolerance may be a deter
rent to an individual considering
bringing forth a complaint. Fur
thermore, in practice, the deter
mination of what constitutes
"unreasonable interference" by
the mediator of the conflict is
open to drastic differences of
interpretation.
Secondly, the 1993 policy also
states that "The key question is
always whether the conduct is
unwelcome to the individual to
whom it is directed, regard'ess of
the intentions of the actor." Mow
ever, the new draft states that
harassing conduct "may be con
duct intended to harass, or con
duct whose unintended but rea
sonably foreseeable effect is to
cause harassment." The revision
is of concern because it leaves
room for interpretation about
what "reasonably foreseeable"
constitutes.
The opinion of the harassed
individual is no longer the primary
determinant of whether sexual
harassment has occurred. Because
of the nebulous nature of sexual
harassment, the viewpoint from
which behavior is judged should
first be that of the victim. Obvious

ly, the perspectives of both individ
uals involved in an alleged incident
must be considered, but to allow
such room for interpretation about
intention by a third party is to
allow a wavering standard of judg
ment about sexual harassment
cases in this institution.
Another concern is the removal
of the glossary in the 1993 policy.
Clearly defined terms leave less
room for differing interpretations
in practice — if anything, we
would like to see the glossary of
the original policy expanded.
In regard to the time period for
reporting grievances, the draft
policy mentions, but does not
specify a time limit. Moreover,
why is there a time limit at all?
Often, people do not realize that
their experience qualifies as
harassment until a later time. The
policy's vagueness on the topic of
the time limit may deter a person
from filing a grievance at all.
Though we are aware that the
University must comply with the
outside legal procedures, we
would like to address the issue of
confidentiality. We respect that
the policy admits that confiden
tiality cannot be guaranteed —
this is an unhappy reality. How
ever, resident assistants and
other employees in positions to
be informally contacted about
sexual harassment may not suffi
ciently explain to students that
confidentiality is not guaranteed.
Since an RA is often the first, out
let for students to discuss their
problems, it is important that
RAs adequately warn the stu
dents of their obligation to report
to the University.
Concerning future revision,
we would like to see the estab
lishment of a specific year in
which the next review of the poli
cy will occur and the explicit
promise that both graduate and
undergraduate students will be
involved in the process. Review
should also be extensively publi
cized and opened for debate in
the community. We are con
cerned that the substance of the
changes to the 1993 policy have
been poorly publicized among the
student body. All of these provi
sions for review should be clearly
stated in the 1995 draft policy
itself (as they were in the 1993
policy).
We all have the same end in
mind — to design an effective and
uncompromising sexual harass
ment policy which is sensitive to
the particular needs of the Stan
ford community.
