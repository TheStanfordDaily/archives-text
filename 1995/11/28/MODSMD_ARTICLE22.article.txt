# New policy will safeguard the rights of all students
## 
### 
UNDER THE PREVIOUS
policy, non-case-specific
records were kept to gath
er statistical data, protecting the
anonymity of the parties involved.
The keeping of such records has
been useful in studying the effec
tiveness of the educational and
preventative measures instituted
on campus. While statistical data
will continue to be gathered, the
revised policy will also allow the
Sexual Harassment Coordinating
Adviser to keep detailed notes of
each case. This positive change
will help to identify repeat offend
ers.
The revised policy does not
clearly state whether records will
be kept in cases were an accusa
tion was found to be without
merit. Such records should be
retained to protect the rights and
reputation of the falsely accused
party. If accusations of past mis
conduct are raised, the accused
should be able to exonerate them
selves by obtaining a copy of their
past record.
The new policy more clearly
explains in which instances a con
versation concerning sexual
harassment is protected by legal
privilege. Ideally, confidentiality
should be kept in all cases. How
ever, it is to the benefit of the
whole community if the Universi
ty investigates reports of sexual

harassment which may pose a
threat to others.
Another positive aspect of the
revised policy is the establish
ment of a system to monitor the
interaction between the accused
and the accuser. This measure
helps to protect against the possi
bility of retribution by the
accused following the outcome of
the investigation.
The revising committee made
an earnest attempt to solicit the
Stanford community's input,
inquiries and concerns regarding
the new draft policy. Unfortu
nately, only four students
responded to the committee's
request for feedback. In the
future, students must take the
initiative to make their questions
and concerns known.
Fortunately, only a small num
ber of students need ever test how
well the sexual harassment policy
protects them. We encourage stu
dents to speak out and document
their situations when faced with
sexual harassment. The changes
to the sexual harassment policy
will help to protect the rights and
well-being of the Stanford com
munity.
