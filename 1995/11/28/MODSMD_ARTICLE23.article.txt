# Revised policy is weakened by its unclear definitions
## 
### 
I HAVE MADE three puzzled
communications to the com
mittee revising the sexual
harassment policy. These com
munications were primarily
attempts to get clarification on
the policy's definitions of sexual
harassment. I have received no
clarification to my questions in
this instance, nor in previous
instances. I find the idea that this
new policy is "much clearer" and
"a step in the right direction" to
be seriously incorrect.
First, I wish to say that the
policy's condemnation of quid pro
quo suggestions of subordinate
advantage in return for "sexual
favors" to suit a superior is fine.
This is major corruption and it
deserves swift and severe Univer
sity punishment.
However, I have found and
continue to find it impossible to
determine what less egregious
behavior and what sorts of
"harassment" are intended to
become actionable under this
draft policy. Worse, some of the
language in the policy is reckless
ly circular. For example, take the
statement "It (sexual harass
ment) may be conduct intended to
harass, or conduct whose unin
tended but reasonably foreseeable
effect is to cause harassment."
This classically circular state
ment should offend any reader
who is awake!
The issue is not just about
ambiguous definitions. It's also
about what sort of transfer of
power is being made here to a
committee or persons at the
expense of whom and on what
principles.
I challenge the reader to
determine, after reading the pol
icy, whether some of the follow
ing questions are actionable:
advocacy of sexual abstinence or
of free love in the work place or
in the schools; abortion debate,
pro or con; patterns of dress and
who decides the boundaries; dis
cussion of media coverage which
might bear on somebody's sexual
sensitivities. 1 invite the reader
to think of other such behaviors
and ask what is acceptable, what
is punishable and what is pro
tected.
I also find objectionable the state
ment under "Formal Grievance and
Disciplinary Processes" that "Gen
erally, a grievance seeks to redress
an adverse employment or aca
demic action affecting the individ
ual bringing the charge." This
statement generally limits a for
mal grievance. The limit of the
grievance is defined as to "redress
an action, of tangible impact to
employment conditions or aca

demic circumstance." That is, the
grievance cannot be brought on
the conduct alone, but instead
must be about the tangible

'I have found... It impos
sible to determine...
what sorts of "harass
ment" are intended to
become actionable.'

impact of the conduct in question.
Beyond issues of power, I am
concerned that few persons
responded to the call for comment
on this policy. There are many
reasons not to respond to such a
policy, not to get involved in such
murky, emotionally loaded
debate. Staff at Stanford, for
example, are trained not to ques
tion policy. The sexual harass
ment policy is the sole case of a
call for such review in my three
decades as a Stanford employee.
I have made repeated inquiries
asking for clarification. Universi
ty attempts at clarification have
been minimal, with some allu
sions months ago, to free speech
rights as being in conflict with the
policy. The drafters of this policy
are fully aware that the policy is
unclear and largely subject to the
capricious interpretation of the
implementing authorities.
I believe that such an ill
defined policy is broadly repres
sive, may poorly serve the many
legitimate needs for University
involvement and is therefore sub
ject to capricious and illogical
whimsy in application. I think the
definitions sections should be
rewritten to be self-explanatory
and comprehensible, especially in
regard to which behaviors are
intended to be sanctioned and
which behaviors are not. If noth
ing else, I propose that a policy be
adopted to sanction only those
quid pro quo behaviors which can
be defined, rather than trying to
define "harassment" so vaguely
in this policy. I suspect that the
present sexual harassment policy
could be rewritten as a sexual
coercion policy and the ill-defined
"harassment" issues should
become part of a separate policy
on deliberate or de facto insult
against staff, students or faculty.
It may be that different standards
of insult apply to each of those
groups.
