## 
### Joe El Rady 
In an eflort to mix entertainment and edu
cation, the Stanford Film Society will bring
faculty and staff to screenings and discussions
of the controversial feature film "Kids" this
week.
Assistant Director of Residential Education
Ann Porteus will join Multicultural Educator
Tommy Lee Woon and other faculty and staff
in discussions after screenings of the film.
" 'Kids' brings to the fore a lot of important
issues to Stanford students and others," said
Stanford Film Society President Jonathan
Levitt, a sophomore.
In the film, director Larry Clark presents
24 hours in the lives of young teenagers. Clark
follows a group of friends through a summer
day in Manhattan, creating a cinema verite
nightmare of drug abuse, racism, violence,
unprotected sex and AIDS.
The showings will be held tomorrow and
Thursday at both 7 and 9 p.m., as well as Fri
day at 8 and 10 p.m. and Saturday at 2, 8 and
10 p.m.
Jickets for the event, held at Cubberley
itorium, will be on sale between 11:30
a.m. and 1 p.m. every day this week in White

Plaza.
Because Stanford students
might be able to learn from
discussion of the characters'
experiences, Levitt said, the
Stanford Film Society enrolled
the help of Res Ed and a few
professors to open debate.
Res Ed will encourage resi
dent assistants and resident
fellows to take students en

masse to the viewings, Levitt said. The office
will also provide a set of questions, written in
collaboration with the film society, to facilitate
discussion in the dorms after the showings.
Carole Pertofsky, director of both health
promotion for student health services and stu
dent AIDS/HIV volunteer education will also
discuss the film after the 9 p.m. screening on
Wednesday.
Elise Lenox, instructor for Freshman Alco
hol Resistance and Management, will speak
following the 9 p.m. showing on Thursday.
"I am thrilled that this movie will be
shown," said Lenox. "I think [the film] depicts
the real life of many teenagers, without the
candy coating. It's a pretty piercing portrayal.
"I see students struggling with similar

issues," said Lenox, giving depression and iso
lation as examples.
"When people feel isolated and hopeless,
they seek sexual closeness and intimacy. In a
drunken state this could be dangerous,"
Lenox said. "Some Stanford students have a
misperception that just because someone is a
Stanford student and they look healthy, they
don't have sexually transmitted diseases," she
continued.
Porteus said the film is worthy of discus
sion and the involvement of University offi
cials.
"We think [the movie] raises a lot of inter
esting issues," she said. "These issues are per
tinent to the world and how we view the world
and our country."
Levitt said presenting the film is part of the
mission of the film society, which he formed
last year after receiving a grant.
"It is very important for the Stanford Film
Society to present films in a serious, academic
and intellectual format which fosters discus
sion among Stanford students and faculty," he
said. "The film society feels that film can be a
great educator and can reach many people
because it is so accessible. It is art and enter
tainment."
