## No. 15 Stanford hoops takes winning act on the road Cardinal meets USF despite consecutive tourneys 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
You might call it the game that time forgot. If
Dion Cross nails his first three-pointer with a two
handed set shot, you'll know something is definitely
wrong with the space-time continuum.
Playing in that venerable barn of an arena called
the Cow Palace at 7 p.m. tonight against a team
whose best days came during the Eisenhower
administration, No. 15 Stanford (2-0) will face off
against the University of San Francisco Dons (0-1)

'I know the kids would probably
rather play than practice.'
— Mike Montgomery

in a game which almost didn't happen. Instead, it
now sits as an annoyance squeezed between two
busy tournament weekends.
"It's not an ideal scheduling situation," said head
coach Mike Montgomery. "We tried to change the
USF game so we would have this week, but we
couldn't do it. But that's fine. Sometimes you gain
as much playing as you do just trying to prepare. I
know the kids would probably rather play than prac
tice."
When the opportunity to play in the Tournament
of Champions in North Carolina came up, the Car
dinal had to juggle its slate to meet Montgomery's
desires to play top-notch competition. Unfortunate
ly, to fit the Carolina tournament, Stanford had to
drop Santa Clara (and a matchup between the West
Coast's two best point guards in junior Brevin
Knight and Bronco senior Steve Nash) and now
finds itself playing the Dons almost as an
afterthought.
But before the Cardinal leaves tomorrow morn
ing for the East Coast, it must tackle a USF team
which lacks its star player, three-year starter Gerald

Walker. A two-time West Coast Conference first
team selection, Walker brought a high-flying attack
to the Don offense. However, a broken bone in his
left foot has sidelined the point guard indefinitely.
"I don't worry too much about Walker," Mont
gomery said. "He's an explosive athlete, but what
you look at is what they do as a team."
Without Walker leading the show, Montgomery
expects USF to try to control the pace of the game
with a methodical offense and a lot of different
defensive combinations, especially a few junk zone
defenses to counter Stanford's offensive triple
threat of Knight, Cross and sophomore center Tim
Young.
"I think we'll see a lot of zone until we solve it,"
Montgomery said, referring to the success Rice had
against Stanford during the first half of Saturday's
game. "We didn't attack it as well as we wanted to,
so | RiceJ stayed in it longer.
"It's a whole different tempo. Man-to-man is set
up to get the ball in certain areas, and zones are set
up to keep you from doing that specifically. Some
times we get impatient, and if you don't execute and
miss a couple, things can snowball on you."
The Dons are coming off a woeful 35.3 percent
shooting night in a 68-65 overtime loss to Bucknell
last Friday. Freshman guard Michael Colter scored
20 in place of Walker while forward Zerrick Camp
bell hit for 18 points and 17 rebounds.
Since USF runs 6-foot-8, 6-foot-8, 6-foot-5 across
its front line, expect Young to see a lot of opportuni
ties inside to break down the zone or force double
teams. If that doesn't work, Montgomery can once
again turn to Knight, who has recovered from a
scary shoulder injury which almost kept him out of
Saturday's contest.
"Brevin's shoulder is fine," Montgomery said.
"He had a little bit of inflammation. He slept wrong
on it and didn't get any blood flow to it and all of a
sudden the inflammation settled in and he couldn't
move it at all. Once we got the inflammation moving
through and out, it's probably not something that
we'll hear about again."
Kind of like tonight's game.
