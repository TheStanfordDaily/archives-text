# Women's tennis finds Rainbow's pot of gold
## Schlukebir, Scott sweep Hawaii opponents in minimum 12 games

Stanford 9

While most students were fill
ing themselves with turkey and
all the trimmings, the Stanford
women's tennis team packed its
bags and headed to a warm, trop
ical paradise. However, the
team's trip to Hawaii was not a
weekend retreat to enjoy luaus
and work on tans.
Stanford flew half way across
the Pacific for its first non-tour
nament contest of the 1995-96
season against the University of
Hawaii and swept the Rainbows
9-0.
Unlike most women's dual
matches, in which the two teams
play two-out-of-three sets in dou
bles, the Cardinal and the Rain
bows chose to play three doubles
matches in the eight-game pro-set
format typical of men's tennis
dual match competition. Hawaii
and Stanford stayed with the
best-of-three set style for the six

singles matches.
At such an early stage in the
season, the Cardinal typically
uses the previous year's individu
al rankings to determine who
plays which seed. However, the
absence of third-ranked senior
Kim Shasby compelled head
coach Frank Brennan to shift his
usual lineup up one slot each.

The matches were
rather lopsided.
[Hawaii] varies from
being fairly competi
tive to really com
petitive.'
— Frank Brennan

Junior Sandra De Silva slid up to
the No. 3 spot, followed by sopho
more Julie Scott, senior Amy
Chiminello and senior Beth
Berris in the No. 4, No. 5 and No.
6 spots, respectively.
