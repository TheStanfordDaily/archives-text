# Women's tennis finds Rainbow's pot of gold
## Schlukebir, Scott sweep Hawaii opponents in minimum 12 games 
### Robin Davidson 
Stanford 9

While most students were fill
ing themselves with turkey and
all the trimmings, the Stanford
women's tennis team packed its
bags and headed to a warm, trop
ical paradise. However, the
team's trip to Hawaii was not a
weekend retreat to enjoy luaus
and work on tans.
Stanford flew half way across
the Pacific for its first non-tour
nament contest of the 1995-96
season against the University of
Hawaii and swept the Rainbows
9-0.
Unlike most women's dual
matches, in which the two teams
play two-out-of-three sets in dou
bles, the Cardinal and the Rain
bows chose to play three doubles
matches in the eight-game pro-set
format typical of men's tennis
dual match competition. Hawaii
and Stanford stayed with the
best-of-three set style for the six

singles matches.
At such an early stage in the
season, the Cardinal typically
uses the previous year's individu
al rankings to determine who
plays which seed. However, the
absence of third-ranked senior
Kim Shasby compelled head
coach Frank Brennan to shift his
usual lineup up one slot each.

The matches were
rather lopsided.
[Hawaii] varies from
being fairly competi
tive to really com
petitive.'
— Frank Brennan

Junior Sandra De Silva slid up to
the No. 3 spot, followed by sopho
more Julie Scott, senior Amy
Chiminello and senior Beth
Berris in the No. 4, No. 5 and No.
6 spots, respectively.

no State last season.

Shasby's absence caused a
few changes in doubles action as
well. Junior Katie Schlukebir
and sophomore Ania Bleszynski,
who play No. 1 and No. 2 respec
tively in singles, retained their
No. 1 seed in doubles, while
Berris and junior Emily Burt
moved into the No. 2 spot.
Freshman Marisa Maclennan
and senior Wendy Sacks paired
up for the first time to compete
in the No. 3 position.
As indicated by the scores, the
Cardinal dominated the action
on the court. In singles play,
Stanford dropped a combined
total of only 11 games in 12 total
sets.
The closest match was
between De Silva and Rainbow
Salani Lesa. De Silva won com
fortably by a score of 6-2, 6-3.
Schlukebir and Scott defeated
their opponents, Amy Kusch and
Petra Turek, without losing a
game (6-0, 6-0).
Not to be outdone, Chiminello
and Berris only surrendered one
game each in their matches
against Natalie Lum and Ean
Phoummaly.
Bleszynski, who experienced
the second closest match, dis
posed Michelle Radman easily by
a 6-2, 6-2 score.
Stanford had its way in dou
bles competition as well. The
top-ranked pair of Schlukebir
and Bleszynski crushed Hawaii's
Kusek and Radman 8-1 while
the Rolex Regional Champi
onships finalist team of Berris
and Burt downed Hawaii's No. 2
team of Lesa and Lum 8-2. In
the No. 3 position, Maclennan
and Sacks won the closest set in
the entire dual match with a 8-5
victory over Turek and Phoum
maly.
"The matches were rather lop
sided," Brennan said. "[Hawaii 1
varies from being fairly competi
tive to really competitive.
"(This match] is something we
do every year. We were all togeth
er [as a team] and had a good
time."
