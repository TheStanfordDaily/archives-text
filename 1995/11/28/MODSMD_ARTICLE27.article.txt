Even though the football team
was snubbed for next month's
Aloha Bowl, another Stanford team
was able to invade the islands and
make a name for Cardinal athletics.
The top-ranked Stanford men's
tennis team closed out its fall presea
son workouts by taking on the Uni
versity of Hawaii last Friday at the
Kiahuna Plantation Courts in Kona,
Hawaii. Showing no Thanksgiving
hangover, the Cardinal easily swept
all six singles matches along with the
three doubles matches to win 7-0.
"They're a young team," said
head coach Dick Gould of the Rain
bows. "They'll be better when we
play them in January."
None of the six Cardinal players
surrendered a set throughout the
contest. In the No. 1 match, sopho
more Paul Goldstein, playing only
in singles competition this time
around, set the tone for the dual
meet, defeating Alex Sugai 6-3, 6-3.
In the No. 2 match, freshman sen
sation Ryan Wolters continued his
strong preseason, knocking off
Kula Oda in straight sets, 6-1, 6-1.
No. 3 senior Jim Thomas beat
Keith Wyer 6-2, 6-2 while junior
Grant Elliot, showing no signs of
the back problems that hampered

him at the Rolex Regional Champi
onships three weeks ago, toppled
Alex Simon at the No. 4 position by
the same score. Senior Ricky Beck
er defeated Stu Truter in the fifth
singles slot, seizing the first set 6-3
and edging his opponent 7-6 to
complete the straight-sets win.
Sophomore Misha Palecek rounded
out the singles matches at No. 6,
downing Chad Shibaya 6-1, 6-4.
The three doubles matches saw
more of the same Cardinal domina
tion, as Stanford swept them all
with ease. The Cardinal's top dou
bles tandem of Wolters and Elliot
defeated Hawaii's best duo of Oda
and Simon by a score of 8-4. Becker
and Palecek, the second doubles
team, beat Truter and Sugai by the
same score of 8-4.
Completing the doubles sweep
were Thomas and sophomore
Charles Hoeveler, who participated
only in doubles play. They beat the
third Rainbow tandem of VVyer and
Shibaya 8-1.
Gould was glad his team did not
suffer a letdown after having its
way in the Rolex tournament.
"Even though they were not a
strong team, there's a chance that
[Stanford] could play down to their
level, but (my athletes 1 proved oth
erwise," he said. "It was a nice way
to end our fall workouts.
"Everyone did a good job against
a fair, but not great team. I
wouldn't single anyone out. Every
one played fine. It was worthwhile
to get in a dual meet and end our
fall season with a match. It's been a
great fall for us."
