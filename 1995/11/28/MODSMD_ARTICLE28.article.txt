# Count out Bruins, watch out for Zona and bet on the Card

### 
Now that Thanksgiving
has come and gone once
again, we are left with
only fond, heart-warming mem
ories of the good times. Things
like turkey and stuffing, the pre
season NIT and the Great Alas
ka Shootout, cranberry sauce
and the Tip-Off Classic, and last
but definitely not least, pump
kin pie and, heck, even the Fry's
Invitational. So, what's next?
Well, there's Christmas, but
more importantly, there's also
the rest of the college basketball
season to look forward to.

Yes, there's no denying it
now. The NFL playoffs haven't
started yet. There are still bowl
games to be played. And the
NBA is still dancing to the same
old tune of overpaid, high-flying
spoiled brats. But college bas
ketball has begun, and all is
good on this planet.
If you don't believe me, you
can ask Duke head coach Mike
Krzyzewski, who led his Blue
Devils from the abysmal depths
of unrankedhood — a foreign
land to Coach K — to the title at
the Great Alaska Shootout, oust
ing top-25 teams Indiana and
lowa. Yes, after a dismal season
without Krzyzewski (otherwise
known as the second coming of
John Wooden) last year, the
Blue Devils are looking to show
yet again why they call the Final
Four the Duke Invitational.
Did I say invitational? Well, it
might not be a good idea to pre
cede that word with "Maui"
when around UCLA coach Jim
Harrick. Harrick's squad,
maybe thinking a little bit too
much about the fun and sun
while resting on its champi
onship laurels, was scorched last
week by unranked Santa Clara
and Vanderbilt. The Bruins,
ranked as high as No. 4 in the
early season polls (but sure to
plummet), put on a smashing
display of how overrated they
are and how badly they'll be
hurting from the departure of
three of last year's seniors, all
now in the NBA. The No. 22
ranking the USA Today / CNN
poll released yesterday is much
more indicative of this year's
UCLA team. Harrick now has

the opportunity to prove how
well he can or can't coach now
that Tyus Edney, Ed O'Bannon
and George Zidek aren't there to
do it for him anymore.
One man who has shown that
he can coach is Arizona's Lute
Olson. Like the Blue Devils, the
Wildcats were picked to be as
good as dead with the graduation
of All-World point guard Damon
Stoudamire. Unfortunately for
the rest of the Pac-10, however,
Zona is quickly proving other
wise, knocking off No. 16 Michi
gan and fifth-ranked George
town in the preseason NIT.
Those are very solid Wolverine
and Hoya teams, too. In fact,
don't be surprised if John
Thompson and a talented crew
featuring Allen Iverson and
Othella Harrington take George
town to the Meadowlands come
March. Fans should enjoy the
Hoyas now because senior Har
rington is set to graduate, and
Iverson, a sophomore, will defi
nitely pack up for the big leagues
as well. It looks like Hoya Para
noia may sweep the nation once
again, but the Fac-10 had best
keep its eyes on Arizona.
The Wildcats won't have
Stoudamire, but they will have a
strong core of big men in Joe
Blair and Ben Davis to go along
with veterans Reggie Geary and
Joe McLean. Keep an eye out
also for sophomore Miles Simon,
one of the brightest young guns
in the Pac-10.
Arizona's Wildcats won't be
the only ones biting off some
heads come tournament time.
The brazen felines from Ken
tucky are also sure to cause
quite a stir as they do every sea
son. In fact, the big knock on
this year's UK team? Too much
talent if you can believe that.
Well, I don't believe it for a sec
ond. Maybe Kansas (everyone
else's choice for the top) has bet
ter "chemistry" with one of the
nation's top backcourts in point
man Jacque Vaughn and guard
Jerod Haase as well as a good
frontcourt anchored by center
Raef LaFrentz. But, year in and
year out, I always go with Ken
tucky. The Wildcats never win
it, and I don't really expect any
thing different this year; still
Rick Pitino's talent-laden team
is still my pick.
Speaking of great backcourts,
top point guards and big-time
centers, let's get to the impor
tant stuff: Stanford. With the
emergence of Cardinal stars
Brevin Knight and Dion Cross,
along with Santa Clara's Bruin
