# Count out Bruins, watch out for Zona and bet on the Card
## 
### 
Now that Thanksgiving
has come and gone once
again, we are left with
only fond, heart-warming mem
ories of the good times. Things
like turkey and stuffing, the pre
season NIT and the Great Alas
ka Shootout, cranberry sauce
and the Tip-Off Classic, and last
but definitely not least, pump
kin pie and, heck, even the Fry's
Invitational. So, what's next?
Well, there's Christmas, but
more importantly, there's also
the rest of the college basketball
season to look forward to.

Yes, there's no denying it
now. The NFL playoffs haven't
started yet. There are still bowl
games to be played. And the
NBA is still dancing to the same
old tune of overpaid, high-flying
spoiled brats. But college bas
ketball has begun, and all is
good on this planet.
If you don't believe me, you
can ask Duke head coach Mike
Krzyzewski, who led his Blue
Devils from the abysmal depths
of unrankedhood — a foreign
land to Coach K — to the title at
the Great Alaska Shootout, oust
ing top-25 teams Indiana and
lowa. Yes, after a dismal season
without Krzyzewski (otherwise
known as the second coming of
John Wooden) last year, the
Blue Devils are looking to show
yet again why they call the Final
Four the Duke Invitational.
Did I say invitational? Well, it
might not be a good idea to pre
cede that word with "Maui"
when around UCLA coach Jim
Harrick. Harrick's squad,
maybe thinking a little bit too
much about the fun and sun
while resting on its champi
onship laurels, was scorched last
week by unranked Santa Clara
and Vanderbilt. The Bruins,
ranked as high as No. 4 in the
early season polls (but sure to
plummet), put on a smashing
display of how overrated they
are and how badly they'll be
hurting from the departure of
three of last year's seniors, all
now in the NBA. The No. 22
ranking the USA Today / CNN
poll released yesterday is much
more indicative of this year's
UCLA team. Harrick now has

the opportunity to prove how
well he can or can't coach now
that Tyus Edney, Ed O'Bannon
and George Zidek aren't there to
do it for him anymore.
One man who has shown that
he can coach is Arizona's Lute
Olson. Like the Blue Devils, the
Wildcats were picked to be as
good as dead with the graduation
of All-World point guard Damon
Stoudamire. Unfortunately for
the rest of the Pac-10, however,
Zona is quickly proving other
wise, knocking off No. 16 Michi
gan and fifth-ranked George
town in the preseason NIT.
Those are very solid Wolverine
and Hoya teams, too. In fact,
don't be surprised if John
Thompson and a talented crew
featuring Allen Iverson and
Othella Harrington take George
town to the Meadowlands come
March. Fans should enjoy the
Hoyas now because senior Har
rington is set to graduate, and
Iverson, a sophomore, will defi
nitely pack up for the big leagues
as well. It looks like Hoya Para
noia may sweep the nation once
again, but the Fac-10 had best
keep its eyes on Arizona.
The Wildcats won't have
Stoudamire, but they will have a
strong core of big men in Joe
Blair and Ben Davis to go along
with veterans Reggie Geary and
Joe McLean. Keep an eye out
also for sophomore Miles Simon,
one of the brightest young guns
in the Pac-10.
Arizona's Wildcats won't be
the only ones biting off some
heads come tournament time.
The brazen felines from Ken
tucky are also sure to cause
quite a stir as they do every sea
son. In fact, the big knock on
this year's UK team? Too much
talent if you can believe that.
Well, I don't believe it for a sec
ond. Maybe Kansas (everyone
else's choice for the top) has bet
ter "chemistry" with one of the
nation's top backcourts in point
man Jacque Vaughn and guard
Jerod Haase as well as a good
frontcourt anchored by center
Raef LaFrentz. But, year in and
year out, I always go with Ken
tucky. The Wildcats never win
it, and I don't really expect any
thing different this year; still
Rick Pitino's talent-laden team
is still my pick.
Speaking of great backcourts,
top point guards and big-time
centers, let's get to the impor
tant stuff: Stanford. With the
emergence of Cardinal stars
Brevin Knight and Dion Cross,
along with Santa Clara's Bruin


Daniei
Kao
killer Steve Nash just down 101, Sil
icon Valley is quickly becoming bet
ter known for producing quality
guards than computer chips. Stan
ford's strength will definitely be in
the backcourt. Knight will be up to
his usual game-breaking antics,
frustrating opponents far and near
with his quickness, tenacity, confi
dence and a new toy he likes called
an outside shot. That's a toy all too
familiar to the long-bombing Cross.
The Cardinal sniper will continue to
be Stanford's biggest offensive
threat, shooting and drilling the
trey through the hearts of oppo
nents. And who can forget sixth
man David Harbour, a six-foot
three swingrmin who plays with the
toughness of a Mack truck.
Up front will be where the Cardi
nal faithful may be most pleased
however, if you am believe that.
Forwards Andy Poppink and Dar
ren Allaway will provide solid play
and leadership as senior team cap
tains, but it's sophomore Tim
Young who will start turning some
heads. Fans caught a glimpse of
Young's potential last Friday night
against Stetson when he dominated
the paint and had his way with the
jHMtr Hatters. And even when he
struggled a bit the next night
against Rice, Young still established
himself as a presence, drawing a lot
of attention mid loosening up the
defense for the rest of the Cardinal.
Nowadays, there's a huge debate
on whether to build a team around
a point guard or center. Well, head
coach Mike Montgomery won't
need to join that discussion because
he has the best of both worlds.
Opponents should have hours and
hours of headaches trying to defend
Stanford's inside-outside game.
So Stanford's good, but how
good compared to the rest of the
Fac-10? UCLA has already proved
to be a leaky vessel, and Arizona has
shown it self to be sterner than once
believed. Both teams, nevertheless,
figure to be at the top when crunch
time rolls around. The Bruins have
too much athleticism and the Wild
cats too much pride, heat mid expe
rience. The other scary team in the
conference is Washington State.
Like the Cardinal, the Cougars
return nearly all their key players,
headlined by hard-nosed forward
Mark Hendrickson and guard Isaac
Fontaine. None of these teams,
however, have the same blend of

veteran leadership, talent .and posi
tion players that Stanford does.
I would also like to include Cal
among the Pac-10's elite, but it just
seems that no matter how much tal
ent Bear coach Todd Bozeman
buys, 1 mwui recruits, be still can't
coach worth a lick. It seems as if he
saves his best tirades not for bis
team hut for the NCAA, trying to
justify why Golden Bear Tremaine

Fowlkes should be allowed to play
despite taking a small loan from an
agent for a sports utility vehicle.
Cal should, by sheer talent alone,
beat some good teams and make a
run for the top of the Pac-10, but
the Bears will wind up finishing
behind fourth-place Washington
State, third-place Arizona, second
place UCLA and, yes, first-place
Stanford.

Senior Darren Allaway and sophomore Tim Young will fill the middle
for the Cardinal in its quest for a Pacific 10 Conference title.
