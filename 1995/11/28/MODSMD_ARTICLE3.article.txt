# Immigrants spared from Congressional ax
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Fears of losing federal aid for higher
education were calmed over the week
end when Republicans in Congress
abandoned their plan to refuse federal
assistance to immigrant students.
Pressure from universities and col
leges across the country pushed legisla
tors to forego a Congressional proposal
to deny immigrants scholarship aid.
Jim Manley, representing the office
of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D Mass., said
that student lobbying had also been very
effective.
"Students have managed to attend a
number of hearings, and their lobbying

organizations have contacted various
congressional offices,'' Manley said.
Kennedy was a member of the
House-Senate conference committee
which fashioned the final legislation,
which is now headed for President Clin
ton's desk to be signed into law or ve
toed.
Stanford Director of Government
and Community Relations Larry Mor
ton, the University's chief representa
tive in Washington, said the issue had
received much attention. "We work in
Washington with a number of other as
sociations on issues like these — this one
was high priority," he said.
Foreign students need to have an
American citizen as a sponsor when they

apply for legal immigrant status. Cur
rently, however, students' eligibility for
federal aid does not depend on their
sponsor's income and a sponsor is not
expected to help a student pay back fed
eral loans.
If the plan had been kept in the bud
get, the sponsor's income would have
been included as part of the student's in
come, causing a decrease in the amount
of aid for which the student was eligible.
Director of Student Awards Cynthia
Rife said the final legislation, without
such provisions, was much less restric
tive than had been feared. "The worst
possible outcome (now] is that the stu
dents who are determined eligible would
need to have a co-signer," she said.

"That would still moan additional work,
but it is nothing by comparison to the
earlier proposal."
The changes are a relief to students
across the country, who need the money
to get any form of higher education,
Man ley said.
"I think that a lot of students are con
cerned about their future — the best
way to increase your earning potential is
to get a solid education," said Manley.
"Cuts would devastate those plans."
But the situation in Washington, as
always, remains uncertain, Horton said.
"We are still waiting to see what hap
pens with budget and appropriations
bills," said Horton. "There are a
lot of negotiations between
Congress and the administration,
and we lire waiting to see what will
happen."
Rife said the small gain seems
to have been lost in all the discus
sion of welfare cuts. From her per
spective in the Financial Aids

Office, there was little student con
cern over the measure.
"We didn't get any worried stu
dents at the front window," said
Rife. "I don't even think the finan
cial aid community was well aware
of it."
Representatives from the office
of California Sens. Barbara Roxer
and Dianne Feinstein, both
Democrats, declined to answer
questions on the abandoned pro
posal, saying they had no new
information.
