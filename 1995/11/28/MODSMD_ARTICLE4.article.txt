# Leaders of Haas form good team

### Mary Megan Peer 
He has seen Stanford's public
service opportunities grow
tremendously since his under
graduate days at the Farm. She
has seen first-hand the need for
public service through growing
up in a poor country halfway
around the world. Together, Tim
Stant on and NadinneCruz, direc
tor and associate director of the
Haas Center respectively, have
affirmed Stanford's commitment
to helping others.
Currently in his third year as
director of the Haas Center for
Public Service, Stanton tutored
at schools in Mountain View and
worked for civil rights while at
Stanford in the 1960'5.
"It was an interesting and ex
citing time to be an undergradu
ate," says Stanton, "I wanted to
figure out connections between
my academic work and political
work."
Now his activism experience
makes him "more easily able to
relate to student activism; he is
always extremely helpful," ac
cording to Council of Presidents
member and senior Rich Stolz,
who has been involved with the
Center since his freshman year.
Stanton is widely known, since
he travels frequently, speaking at
other universities about the value
of service learning.
Like Stanton, Cruz has been
involved in public service since she
was a student. As a freshman at
the University of the Philippines,
she documented violations of land
reform acts which hurt the Filipino
peasants.
"Like many campuses in the six
ties, there was a social conscious
ness on campus and the university
was galvanized to address more
than student concerns.
"I wanted to know for myself
what people were talking about in
the difference between the haves
and have-nots of the population.
Rather than study about the peas
ants I decided to get involved," says
Cruz.
After martial law was declared
in the Philippines in 1971 it
became dangerous to participate
in public service work and Cruz
came to the United States to fin
ish her education. She has worked
here in public service learning
ever since.
She spent 11 years as executive
director of the Higher Education
Consortium for Urban Affairs
(HECUA) in Minneapolis and St.
Paul. HECUA involves students
with social issues in their credited
programs which focus on urban
development both domestically
and internationally.
Before coming to Stanford,
Cruz spent a year at Swarthmore
College as the Lang Professor of
Social Change.
Still working towards the goal of
combining education and activism,
Stanton and Cruz arejust finishing
leading the Haas Center in a two
year strategic planning process to
identify and solve dilemmas faced
by the Center.
Already "Tim and Nadinne have
made the Center much more stu
dent friendly and accessible," Stolz
said.
Priorities that emerged from
strategic planning include
strengthening support for students
who take leadership in organiza
tions, increasing student input in
planning and continuing to focus

on youth in the programs spon
sored by the Center.
Another important element for
Stanton and Cruz is connecting
students' interests in public service
with the academic curriculum. An
outgrowth of this is the Honors
College Public Service Scholars
Program which allows students
who are writing their senior hon
ors theses to include research done
as a form of public service in their
thesis.
As an adviser, Cruz works clos
est with students involved in the
Public Service Scholars Program.
Solomon Creen, a senior majoring
in Anthropology and a Public Ser
vice Scholar, claims that Cruz is
"an amazing asset to the school,
she is really committed to expand
ing and redefining the public ser
vice aspect of the center."
"Students must fulfill both the
requirements of their departments
and the requirements of the Haas
Center. The thesis needs to involve
research potentially useful to a
community group that would not
necessarily have access to it other
wise," she said.
Cruz's experience as an activist
means that she relates to students
who are trying to promote change
here, students said.
"She has confidence in us as

powerful thinkers and activists.
She has opinions and views that
are not ones I would have thought
of myself," according to Katie
Tinto, a senior majoring in Urban
Studies .and a Public Service Schol
ar.
"Her application of conceptual
ideas to direct service has been
inspiring for many students on
campus," according to Stolz, who
chaired the You Can Make a Dif
ference Conference his sophomore
year.
While Cruz is relatively new to
the Center, Stanton has been a
part of it almost since its inception
during the 1984-85 school year. At
first, he worked out of a cramped
office in the Owen House. He con
trasted this with the new Haas
Center which he said "represents a
substantial obligation but also
shows the support and trust that
we've earned."
He said he believes that at this
point Stanford's effort in public
service is "larger and more diverse
than on many other campuses. . . .
There is a depth of involvement
and community-oriented research.
"We have a bright and con
cerned student body who are
increasingly bringing a sophisticat
ed taste in service from their high
school experiences," Stanton said.

As a conceptual leader, Stanton
said he believes he can strengthen
the community service experience
for students by "building a more
cohesive, coordinated student com
munity in public service. Right
now there seems to be a lot of rein
venting of wheels — we need to
strengthen ties between student
groups so they know what each
other are doing. We need to
encourage them to engage with
each other across political and cul
tural lines."
According to Derrick
Yarbrough, a junior and leader of
SPOON (Stanford Project On
Nutrition), Stanton is already on
his way to doing that.
"For me the Haas Center has
become a community, not just a
place where I work. Tim has creat
ed a community atmosphere
instead of another department," he
said.
"Tim is a quiet person — he
often spends more time listening
than speaking. People develop a
respect for him because of his expe
riences and amazing knowledge,"
said Stolz, who works closely with
Stanton.
"One of Stanton's talents is
opening the creative abilities of
those he works with. ... He is very
good at group dynamics."

He has seen Stanford's public
service opportunities grow
tremendously since his under
graduate days at the Farm. She
has seen first-hand the need for
public service through growing
up in a poor country halfway
around the world. Together, Tim
Stant on and NadinneCruz, direc
tor and associate director of the
Haas Center respectively, have
affirmed Stanford's commitment
to helping others.
Currently in his third year as
director of the Haas Center for
Public Service, Stanton tutored
at schools in Mountain View and
worked for civil rights while at
Stanford in the 1960'5.
"It was an interesting and ex
citing time to be an undergradu
ate," says Stanton, "I wanted to
figure out connections between
my academic work and political
work."
Now his activism experience
makes him "more easily able to
relate to student activism; he is
always extremely helpful," ac
cording to Council of Presidents
member and senior Rich Stolz,
who has been involved with the
Center since his freshman year.
Stanton is widely known, since
he travels frequently, speaking at
other universities about the value
of service learning.
Like Stanton, Cruz has been
involved in public service since she
was a student. As a freshman at
the University of the Philippines,
she documented violations of land
reform acts which hurt the Filipino
peasants.
"Like many campuses in the six
ties, there was a social conscious
ness on campus and the university
was galvanized to address more
than student concerns.
"I wanted to know for myself
what people were talking about in
the difference between the haves
and have-nots of the population.
Rather than study about the peas
ants I decided to get involved," says
Cruz.
After martial law was declared
in the Philippines in 1971 it
became dangerous to participate
in public service work and Cruz
came to the United States to fin
ish her education. She has worked
here in public service learning
ever since.
She spent 11 years as executive
director of the Higher Education
Consortium for Urban Affairs
(HECUA) in Minneapolis and St.
Paul. HECUA involves students
with social issues in their credited
programs which focus on urban
development both domestically
and internationally.
Before coming to Stanford,
Cruz spent a year at Swarthmore
College as the Lang Professor of
Social Change.
Still working towards the goal of
combining education and activism,
Stanton and Cruz arejust finishing
leading the Haas Center in a two
year strategic planning process to
identify and solve dilemmas faced
by the Center.
Already "Tim and Nadinne have
made the Center much more stu
dent friendly and accessible," Stolz
said.
Priorities that emerged from
strategic planning include
strengthening support for students
who take leadership in organiza
tions, increasing student input in
planning and continuing to focus

on youth in the programs spon
sored by the Center.
Another important element for
Stanton and Cruz is connecting
students' interests in public service
with the academic curriculum. An
outgrowth of this is the Honors
College Public Service Scholars
Program which allows students
who are writing their senior hon
ors theses to include research done
as a form of public service in their
thesis.
As an adviser, Cruz works clos
est with students involved in the
Public Service Scholars Program.
Solomon Creen, a senior majoring
in Anthropology and a Public Ser
vice Scholar, claims that Cruz is
"an amazing asset to the school,
she is really committed to expand
ing and redefining the public ser
vice aspect of the center."
"Students must fulfill both the
requirements of their departments
and the requirements of the Haas
Center. The thesis needs to involve
research potentially useful to a
community group that would not
necessarily have access to it other
wise," she said.
Cruz's experience as an activist
means that she relates to students
who are trying to promote change
here, students said.
"She has confidence in us as

powerful thinkers and activists.
She has opinions and views that
are not ones I would have thought
of myself," according to Katie
Tinto, a senior majoring in Urban
Studies .and a Public Service Schol
ar.
"Her application of conceptual
ideas to direct service has been
inspiring for many students on
campus," according to Stolz, who
chaired the You Can Make a Dif
ference Conference his sophomore
year.
While Cruz is relatively new to
the Center, Stanton has been a
part of it almost since its inception
during the 1984-85 school year. At
first, he worked out of a cramped
office in the Owen House. He con
trasted this with the new Haas
Center which he said "represents a
substantial obligation but also
shows the support and trust that
we've earned."
He said he believes that at this
point Stanford's effort in public
service is "larger and more diverse
than on many other campuses. . . .
There is a depth of involvement
and community-oriented research.
"We have a bright and con
cerned student body who are
increasingly bringing a sophisticat
ed taste in service from their high
school experiences," Stanton said.

As a conceptual leader, Stanton
said he believes he can strengthen
the community service experience
for students by "building a more
cohesive, coordinated student com
munity in public service. Right
now there seems to be a lot of rein
venting of wheels — we need to
strengthen ties between student
groups so they know what each
other are doing. We need to
encourage them to engage with
each other across political and cul
tural lines."
According to Derrick
Yarbrough, a junior and leader of
SPOON (Stanford Project On
Nutrition), Stanton is already on
his way to doing that.
"For me the Haas Center has
become a community, not just a
place where I work. Tim has creat
ed a community atmosphere
instead of another department," he
said.
"Tim is a quiet person — he
often spends more time listening
than speaking. People develop a
respect for him because of his expe
riences and amazing knowledge,"
said Stolz, who works closely with
Stanton.
"One of Stanton's talents is
opening the creative abilities of
those he works with. ... He is very
good at group dynamics."
