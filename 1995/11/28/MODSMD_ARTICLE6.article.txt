# 'Focused, not fuzzy'
## Fundraisers get new vocabulary 
### Amy Tovar 
In an effort to improve the University's public
image, attract top applicants and bolster fund-raising
efforts, the University has created a new communica
tions plan which blueprints the ideal way officials
should speak about the University.
At the request of the Board of Trustees, the Uni
versity Communications Office, in collaboration with
various individuals and campus committees — in
cluding the Office of the President and Provost and
the Stanford Alumni Association — developed the 30-
page Strategic Communications Plan.
Director of University Communications Terry
Shepard wrote the plan, introducing it as an effort to
"help us collectively present a picture of Stanford that
is focused, not fuzzy."
The central feature of the plan is "The Essential
Stanford" — explained as "a way of defining Stanford
and differentiating it from its competitors." The plan
focuses on six one-word descriptors to be used when
describing the University:
"incomparable," "challenging,"
"pioneering / western,"
"vibrant," "boundless" and
"stunning."
In addition, the text prompts
administrators and workers at
various campus offices to por
tray Stanford as a unique,
vibrant institution, with an
unsurpassed setting that chal
lenges its students to be hard
working, entrepreneurial and
daring.
Shepard, who said he was
unsure if there has been a docu
ment like this in the past, added
that the plan was devised to pro
vide "a set of ways to talk about
the University that we hope cap
tures the central attributes of
Stanford."
The document also stated

that "Stanford has passed
through its own storm of
intense scrutiny." A govern
ment investigation of the Uni
versity for overcharging on
research grants was concluded
last year.
The plan is "descriptive
rather than prescriptive. It is
not meant to tell anyone how to
do their business," Shepard
said. Rather, the aim is to "elim
inate cacophony," according to
Shepard.
The last 15 pages of the doc
ument are an inventory of
Stanford's key audiences —
alumni, campus visitors,
donors, educators, government
and others. It assesses who
communicates with each group
and what the specific responsi
bilities of those communicators
are when dealing with each
group.
"Communication is vital in
reinforcing what is real," Shep
ard said in the document.
