# Prof: Computers fit for classroom?

In the midst of University efforts
to feature new technology in teaching
and learning, a new paper co-au
thored by a Stanford professor raises
questions about those attempts.
The two authors — William
Massy, professor emeritus of educa
tion and business administration and
director of the Stanford Institute for
Higher Education Research, and
Robert Zemsky, a professor of educa
tion and director of the Institute for

Research on Higher Education at the University of
Pennsylvania — claim in the paper that the use of tech
nology represents a profound shift in educational
strategy and values.
"Information technology is going to change things
fundamentally," Massy said. "The same teaching
methods have been used for hundreds of years."
Information technology, or IT, includes many re
cent advances in education such as computer-assisted
education and digital tutorials.
According to the paper, "Using Information Tech-


Massy
nology to Enhance Academic
Productivity," information tech
nology has two fundamental
questions to answer: "Is some
thing essential compromised by
substituting IT-based programs
for traditional teaching meth
ods? How is higher education
going to pay for the acquisition of
the new information technolo
gies?"
The study calls upon universi
ties to develop an "overarching
sense of purpose" and an idea of
how this new technology might
be used.
John Etchemendy, the chair of
Stanford's Commission on Tech
nology in Teaching and Learning
(CTTL), defended recent Univer
sity efforts to emphasize the use
of technology in teaching by say
ing that new technology merely
helps the University fulfill its
mission.
"The institution should be the
prime mover in implementing
new technology," he said. "The
University has to do what it can
to benefit the University."
"The challenge is to increase
the number of students served
without decreasing the quality of
education," Massy said.
The study presents classes
used at the Rensselaer Polytech
nic Institute as a model of how
technology could increase pro
ductivity and decrease costs. At
Rensselaer, computers took on
teaching tasks similar to a typical
teaching assistant's duties, such
as presenting material in small
groups or quizzing students.
However, the problem at the

heart of information technology
is cost, according to the study.
"The issue that underlies
these concerns, information tech
nology's true Gordian knot, is the
tradeoff between faculty control
and educational cost,"the
authors wrote.
According to Etchemendy, the
challenge is to make sure that
universities recover the cost sav
ings from technological break
throughs.
"If improvements are made in

If improvements are
made in a haphazard
way, then the cost
savings can be swal
lowed up.'

a haphazard way, then the cost
savings can be swallowed up in
the decentralized way of universi
ties," he said.
The study was commissioned
by Educom, a collection of col
leges and companies interested in
the link between technology and
productivity.
Etchemendy's committee was
commissioned in the spring of
1994 by University President
Gerhard Casper to discuss issues
of educational innovation and the
role of technology in the class
room.
As chair of the CTTL,
Etchemendy said he hopes to
ensure the University is an
"active force in the redesigning of
courses which will help to make
cost savings a reality."
