# Nom Comm chair resigns amid scandal
## Weintraub blasts COP members for trying to control nomination process

ASSU Nominations Commission Chair
Scott Weintraub resigned after last night's
ASSU Senate meeting, saying he felt uneth
ical pressure from Council of Presidents
members to select certain student represen
tatives to the University's Committee on
Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity.
Nom Comm is responsible for nominat
ing student members to University admin-

istrative committees.
Weintraub said COP j
member Mike Choo §
asked him to recruit \
committee members?
from the Concerned Stu- j
dents for Asian Ameri- \
can Studies (CSAAS). He
added that after the ap- j
plication deadline had I

passed and no one from
CSAAS had applied, the group sent him a
list endorsing certain students it felt

should be on the committee.
CSAAS members also approached the
students who had been nominated for the
CSRE committee and asked them to with
draw their applications in favor of CSAAS
members, according to Weintraub.
Choo said he was worried that students
who had a strong background in race and
ethnicity had not been solicited. "I had a
problem that only a few students applied
and that most of the student body didn't
know about the application process," said
Choo.

However, Weintraub felt that soliciting a
specific student group to apply was inappro
priate and deviated from the normal appli
cation process.
"This side-stepping of the nominating
process is not fair, and because of the piti
fully bureaucratic way the senate does busi
ness, I am not comfortable being a part of
this process so I have come to the conclusion
that I must resign," Weintraub said.
Surrounding the whole issue seems to be


Weintraub

general confusion over what Nom
Comm procedure Ls. It is not clear,
even in the Nom Comm Bylaws of
the ASSI' Constitution, how appli
cations are to be solicited and what
role outside members can play in
this process.
In this case, Weintraub did
bypass "standard" Nom Comm
solicitation procedures — but with
the blessing of COP member Rich
Stolz and, Weintraub said, ASSI
Senate Chair Alane Murdock.
To solicit applications, Wein
traub e-mailed the ASSU Senate
and other campus lists, though he
specified neither a deadline for
solicitations nor the requirements
for the positions. He interviewed
the 10 students who responded and
selected three out of four total
members.
According to Stolz, submission
of a formal written application is

standard Nom Comm procedure.
However, he excused Weintraub's
decision to forego the usual proce
dure because of a time constraint
stipulated by University adminis
trators. Weintraub, who was
appointed commissioner Nov. 7,
was given less than a week to select
students.
During last night's meeting,
Weintraub was criticized for not
having followed regulations con
cerning the nomination of students
for committees. Four of his bills
were deemed out of order because
senators had not been informed of
the nominations 48 hours in
advance, as the bylaws require.
The senate must officially approve
the students Nom Comm selects
for the committees.
" The assumption was that
Scott would be better informed
about what was going on and what
kind of students were needed,"
said Stolz, "but the information
he had gathered [about the select
ed students] was not sufficient to
fill the desire of the senate for

information."
COP member Jon Oram — who
also happens to be Weintraub's
roommate — said Weintraub was
not to blame for the complications
since he did not receive adequate
training. "He never had a training
period mostly because of the time
frame," Oram said.
"The Norn Comm chair is inher
ently political, and he must deal
with the politics involved," said
Oram. "If he was uncomfortable in
dealing with them, then the best
thing to do is resign."
Members of CSAAS could not be
reached for comment last night.
In other ASSU business, the
senate rewrote a bill passed down
from Dean of Students Marc Wais
which originally asked that the
senate approve conditions and
interpretations set forth by the
University Board of Trustees of
two constitutional amendments
passed by the student body last
spring.
The senate's version asks that
the Board of Trustees and Univer

sity President Gerhard Casper be
more involved in ASSU constitu
tional issues and that the presi
dent review and approve those
issues.
Stolz said he felt it undermined
the importance of the ASSU Sen
ate as a legitimate body when the
president designated another
administrator — in this case, Wais
— to work with the ASSU.
Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent AfTairs Mary Edmonds also
addressed the senate last night,
commenting on the Alcohol Task
Force.
Edmonds said she will be look
ing at a "broad scope" of students
to be on the committee and hopes
that it will "uncover what's on stu
dents' minds and what the drink
ing culture is at Stanford.
"We have a situation where
drinking is becoming more and
more of a problem," said Edmonds.
"There are a lot of misperceptions
about the alcohol policy on campus
so we want to get everything out on
the table."

added that after the ap- j
plication deadline had I

passed and no one from
CSAAS had applied, the group sent him a
list endorsing certain students it felt

should be on the committee.
CSAAS members also approached the
students who had been nominated for the
CSRE committee and asked them to with
draw their applications in favor of CSAAS
members, according to Weintraub.
Choo said he was worried that students
who had a strong background in race and
ethnicity had not been solicited. "I had a
problem that only a few students applied
and that most of the student body didn't
know about the application process," said
Choo.

However, Weintraub felt that soliciting a
specific student group to apply was inappro
priate and deviated from the normal appli
cation process.
"This side-stepping of the nominating
process is not fair, and because of the piti
fully bureaucratic way the senate does busi
ness, I am not comfortable being a part of
this process so I have come to the conclusion
that I must resign," Weintraub said.
Surrounding the whole issue seems to be

general confusion over what Nom
Comm procedure Ls. It is not clear,
even in the Nom Comm Bylaws of
the ASSI' Constitution, how appli
cations are to be solicited and what
role outside members can play in
this process.
In this case, Weintraub did
bypass "standard" Nom Comm
solicitation procedures — but with
the blessing of COP member Rich
Stolz and, Weintraub said, ASSI
Senate Chair Alane Murdock.
To solicit applications, Wein
traub e-mailed the ASSU Senate
and other campus lists, though he
specified neither a deadline for
solicitations nor the requirements
for the positions. He interviewed
the 10 students who responded and
selected three out of four total
members.
According to Stolz, submission
of a formal written application is

standard Nom Comm procedure.
However, he excused Weintraub's
decision to forego the usual proce
dure because of a time constraint
stipulated by University adminis
trators. Weintraub, who was
appointed commissioner Nov. 7,
was given less than a week to select
students.
During last night's meeting,
Weintraub was criticized for not
having followed regulations con
cerning the nomination of students
for committees. Four of his bills
were deemed out of order because
senators had not been informed of
the nominations 48 hours in
advance, as the bylaws require.
The senate must officially approve
the students Nom Comm selects
for the committees.
" The assumption was that
Scott would be better informed
about what was going on and what
kind of students were needed,"
said Stolz, "but the information
he had gathered [about the select
ed students] was not sufficient to
fill the desire of the senate for

information."
COP member Jon Oram — who
also happens to be Weintraub's
roommate — said Weintraub was
not to blame for the complications
since he did not receive adequate
training. "He never had a training
period mostly because of the time
frame," Oram said.
"The Norn Comm chair is inher
ently political, and he must deal
with the politics involved," said
Oram. "If he was uncomfortable in
dealing with them, then the best
thing to do is resign."
Members of CSAAS could not be
reached for comment last night.
In other ASSU business, the
senate rewrote a bill passed down
from Dean of Students Marc Wais
which originally asked that the
senate approve conditions and
interpretations set forth by the
University Board of Trustees of
two constitutional amendments
passed by the student body last
spring.
The senate's version asks that
the Board of Trustees and Univer

sity President Gerhard Casper be
more involved in ASSU constitu
tional issues and that the presi
dent review and approve those
issues.
Stolz said he felt it undermined
the importance of the ASSU Sen
ate as a legitimate body when the
president designated another
administrator — in this case, Wais
— to work with the ASSU.
Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent AfTairs Mary Edmonds also
addressed the senate last night,
commenting on the Alcohol Task
Force.
Edmonds said she will be look
ing at a "broad scope" of students
to be on the committee and hopes
that it will "uncover what's on stu
dents' minds and what the drink
ing culture is at Stanford.
"We have a situation where
drinking is becoming more and
more of a problem," said Edmonds.
"There are a lot of misperceptions
about the alcohol policy on campus
so we want to get everything out on
the table."
