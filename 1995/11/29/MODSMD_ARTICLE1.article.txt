ASSU Nominations Commission Chair
Scott Weintraub resigned after last night's
ASSU Senate meeting, saying he felt uneth
ical pressure from Council of Presidents
members to select certain student represen
tatives to the University's Committee on
Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity.
Nom Comm is responsible for nominat
ing student members to University admin-

istrative committees.
Weintraub said COP j
member Mike Choo ยง
asked him to recruit \
committee members?
from the Concerned Stu- j
dents for Asian Ameri- \
can Studies (CSAAS). He
added that after the ap- j
plication deadline had I

passed and no one from
CSAAS had applied, the group sent him a
list endorsing certain students it felt

should be on the committee.
CSAAS members also approached the
students who had been nominated for the
CSRE committee and asked them to with
draw their applications in favor of CSAAS
members, according to Weintraub.
Choo said he was worried that students
who had a strong background in race and
ethnicity had not been solicited. "I had a
problem that only a few students applied
and that most of the student body didn't
know about the application process," said
Choo.

However, Weintraub felt that soliciting a
specific student group to apply was inappro
priate and deviated from the normal appli
cation process.
"This side-stepping of the nominating
process is not fair, and because of the piti
fully bureaucratic way the senate does busi
ness, I am not comfortable being a part of
this process so I have come to the conclusion
that I must resign," Weintraub said.
