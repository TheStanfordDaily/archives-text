## U.S. deployment called inevitable 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — As Presi
dent Clinton pressed his case for
sending 20,000 U.S. ground troops to
Bosnia, the Pentagon said yesterday
an additional 17,000 Americans
would provide support in and around
the former Yugoslavia.
Even Republican critics acknowl
edged that the deployment seemed
inevitable. "He's hellbent to do it, so
we're going to have to support him,"
said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.
Clinton renewed his appeal for
support last night, moments before
he left the White House for Europe
and another peace endeavor, this
time in Northern Ireland.
Noting that he had just concluded
a meeting in which he asked mem
bers of Congress to support his
Bosnia policy, Clinton said he told
them as he had told the American
people in his televised address Mon
day night "that our mission will be
clear, limited and achievable and that
the risks to our troops will be mini
mized."
"Bosnia is a case where our leader
ship can make the difference between
peace and war and America must
choose peace," Clinton said.
Clinton had more persuading to do

outside Washington. Thousands of
Americans called the White House
after his televised speech, and "there
was a great deal of skepticism," con
ceded spokesman Mike McCurry.
"The American people clearly want
to know more," he said.
With the first 700 Americans
expected on the ground in Bosnia
within the next few days, Capt.
Michael Doubleday, a Pentagon
spokesman, said thousands of others
would provide support for the even
tual NATO peacekeeping force of
60,000 That would bring the U.S.
contingent to 37,000.
Among the support troops, there
would be:
• 5,000 stationed elsewhere in the
former Yugoslavia, most of them in
Croatia.
• 3,000 as part of a support force
that will handle logistics from coun
tries on the perimeter.
• 9,000, most already in the
region, who will conduct air and sea
patrols and airlift humanitarian aid.
On the day after his speech to the
nation on Bosnia, Clinton held a
series of meetings with congressional
leaders and members of the House
and Senate committees that will

examine the Bosnia peace agreement
reached last week in Dayton, Ohio.
McCurry said that after the
speech, Clinton talked by telephone
with former President Bush and
retired Gen. Colin Powell, who was
the nation's top military officer dur
ing the Persian Gulf War. The
spokesman declined to characterize
the conversations.
After his day of intense lobbying,
Clinton flew to Europe, a trip that
will include stops in England, Ireland
and Northern Ireland. The president
also planned to visit U.S. troops in
Germany who would be among the
20,000-strong U.S. contingent in the
NATO peacekeeping force.
In surveys taken Monday night,
ABC News said 57 percent opposed
deployment and CBS News said its
survey found 58 percent against
sending U.S. troops to Bosnia. A USA
Today-CNN-Gallup Poll reported
that 46 percent supported deploy
ment and 40 percent opposed it.
Emerging as Clinton's most pow
erful ally among the Republican lead
ership of Congress, Sen. Bob Dole
said, "I want to support the president
if I can." He also said, "Congress will
have hearings and we'll debate it."
