# Federal speed limit revoked
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Clinton
signed a $6 billion road bill yesterday that ends the
federal 55 mph speed limit that has been in place
since 1974 and gives states the power to set their
own, starting in 10 days.
But Clinton made clear that he had serious mis
givings about the measure, fearing that its provi
sions will lead to more accidents, highway deaths
and injuries.
"1 am deeply disturbed by the repeal of both the
national maximum speed limit law and the law
encouraging states to enact motorcycle helmet use
laws," Clinton said in a written statement.
He urged the states to act responsibly and added:
"My administration will redouble our efforts to pro
tect those who travel on the nation's highways." He
instructed the Transportation Department to devel
op an action plan to promote highway safety.

A half-dozen states have laws that raise their
speed limits automatically when the federal cap
comes off. The 10-day wait in the federal legislation
is intended to give them time to change their minds.
Other states are expected to raise their limits in the
coming months.
With the end of the federal limit, Montana would
have no limit at all; the limit would jump to 75 mph
in Kansas, Nevada and Wyoming and to 70 in Okla
homa and South Dakota.
The 55-mph speed limit was imposed in 1974 as
an energy-saving measure in the wake of the
Mideast oil embargo. Highway fatalities declined by
nearly 9,000 the following year, prompting safety
advocates to hail it as a lifesaver. States were later
permitted to set a 65-mph limit on rural interstates.
Suites that failed to comply faced the threat of los
ing federal highway funds.
