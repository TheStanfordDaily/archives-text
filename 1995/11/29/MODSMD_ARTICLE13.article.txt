SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - For
20 years, the United States has
secret ly used psychics in attempts
to hunt down Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi, find plutoni
um in North Korea and help drug
enforcement agencies, the CIA
and others confirmed yesterday.
The ESP spying operations
codenamed "Stargate" — were
unreliable, but three psychics con
tinued to work out of Fort Meade,
Md., at least into July, said
researchers who evaluated the
program for the CIA.
The program cost the govern
ment $20 million, said Professor
Ray Hyman of the University of
Oregon in Eugene, who helped
prepare the study.
Up to six psychics at any time

worked at assignments that
included trying to hunt down
Gadhafi before the 198G U.S.
bombing of Libya, find plutonium
in North Korea in 1994, and
locate kidnapped Brig. Gen.
-James L. Dozier in Italy.
CIA spokesman Mark Mans
field confirmed the existence of
Stargate and the study.
"The CIA is reviewing avail
able programs regarding parapsy
chological phenomena, mostly
remote viewing, to determine
their usefulness to the intelli
gence community," he said.
But he noted that when the
CIA first sponsored research on
the program in the 19705, the pro
gram was found to be "unpromis
ing" and was later turned over to

the Defense Department.
The Defense Intelligence Agen
cy made the psychics available to
government departments that
needed information, Hyman said.
At one time as many as six worked
for the government.
Mansfield declined to comment
on the psychics at Fort Meade or
specific incidents.
The psychics were regularly
tested by the Stanford Research
Institute and later Science Appli
cations International Corp.
The government also looked at
precognition — having psychics
try to guess an answer that had
not yet been reached. And they
looked at clairvoyance — trying to
discover something that has hap
pened but is not yet known.
