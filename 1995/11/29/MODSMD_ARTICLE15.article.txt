## The 						wrong answer 
### 
University needs to
re-evaluate student
help for math classes

Lately, a program tc
give minority students a lit
tle extra, out-of-class help in
math and engineering has come
under fire for what some see as a
discriminatory selection process.
Whether the program — called
the Science Engineering and
Mathematics Achievement Pro
gram (SEMAP) — is discrimina
tory is an issue, but not the most
important one. Since the program
is funded by outside corporations
such as Exxon and GTE, Stanford
may not have much say in who
gets to take part in the class.
Instead, the University should be
concerned by what else the contro
versy indicates: a larger problem
with the Math Department itself.
SEMAP selects between 70 and
80 minority freshmen and some
upper-level students each quarter
and allows them to attend an
extra one-hour section led by a
doctoral student in the Math
Department, along with regular
introductory math courses. The
program's private donors man
date that about 80 percent of the
SEMAP students must be African
American, Native American or
Chicano / Latino.
The program is reputed to work
— so well in fact, that a number
of non-minority students want to
take part too. They complain that
students in the SEMAP program
hold an advantage over other stu
dents, particularly since many
Stanford students feel trapped
between Math 19 and Math 41.
The counter-argument is that
most potential engineering stu
dents come into Stanford with AP
credit at a higher level than Math
19 or 41 anyway and thus don't
need SEMAP'S help. That's prob
ablv true. What the controversy

over this program should high
light, more than anything, is not
whether minorities need and
deserve specific help, but whether
almost everyone in lower-level
math classes needs outside help.
The fact that such a high num
ber of people want to participate
in this program should cause the
University to take note of the con
fusion level of students in classes
like Math 19 and Math 41. Most
students who enroll in those class
es are not the ones most likely to
become engineers, but are instead
looking to fulfill a distribution
requirement. Others may be
interested in fuzzy majors which
require some calculus experience,
like economics.
Students in Math 19 or Math
41 often feel they don't have a
strong enough background in
math to opt for higher-level cours
es like Math 43 and above, but
given that they're Stanford stu
dents, they probably aren't com
pletely clueless about math.
Unfortunately, they are often left
even more confused bv teaching
assistants who speak little
English or professors who put
them to sleep. Many of those who
need extra help may not be able to
get it, at least not from their sec
tion leaders.
There are obviously places
where students can go for help,
from math tutors within the
dorms, to the Center for Teaching
and Learning. But the SEMAP
controversy shows that the num
ber of people who need help of any
kind may be higher than it should
be.
The University should take the
complaints over SEMAP not so
much as evidence of discriminatory
treatment within the math depart
ment, but as an indicator of
widespread problems with lower
level math classes themselves. If
extra help is such a hot commodity,
the problem is not whether or why
students have to be turned away
from outside classes. The question
is why those outside help classes
need to be offered in the first place.
