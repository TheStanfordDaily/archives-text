## Just what is culture? 
### 
WHAT CULTURE EXISTS in
America today? One way I think
of culture is to think of the
interrelationships between a connected
group of people and the products which
represent the people in that group. The
products could be anything — from an
ideal, to cabins, to corpses, to music, to
books, to gardens, to drugs. The only cul
ture I can clearly see in America today is
that of (usually violent) youth gangs,
Deadheads and counterrevolutionary,
conservative, right-wing religious fanat
ics.
I see no strong cultural currents any
where else. The arts, normally a source
for culture, have been lacking any sort of
output that can be called anything more
than individual expression, unconnected
to a thematized movement. Even when
the products, such as grunge music or
post-modernist art, seem similar, there
is a lack of connectedness because the
whole drive of such works is individually
based. Instead of "With God on our side"
(Bob Dylan, 1964), with 100 people
singing together and announcing that
they collectively found God (culture),
today, 100 people sing individually, "I've
found God" (Nirvana, 1991).
There are groups in both cases, but
the interpersonal feeling is radically dif
ferent. Listening to Bob Dylan, 100 peo
ple would sing along and recognize that
they were all connected — there were

some ideas, feelings, thoughts that they
all shared. And they all recognized that
because of this connection, they were
somehow together — a recognition of
connectedness.
Today, there is a recognition of simi
larities, but no recognition of connected
ness. Perhaps the feelings and ideas that
are shared are too individualistic or per
sonal to allow for such interpersonal
bonding. Look at music.
The world is more international and
individual than it was 30 years ago. Bob
Dylan may have noticed something —
"The times they are a-changin' " — and
he certainly did between that album with
"The Ballad of Hollis Brown" and"The
Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll" and
the famous individualistic anthem book
ends of "Highway 61 Revisited": "Like a
Rolling Stone" and "Desolation Row."
Also, in 1965, he busted out in the New
port folk festival with his all-electric
band. Instead of the group campfire sing
song sing-along feelings, the band ush
ered in the change from meaningful
music as culture to masterpieces to be
marveled at individually (as I have with
many great songs since — including the
quintessential, Bowie's "Space Oddity").
I have rarely felt any group spirit at
any concert I have attended. Maybe I
have been too deeply formed as an indi
vidual, alone, isolated in my world, but I
am aware enough to see what's been

going on. I think that is what art critics
are harping on when they attack post
modernism.
Postmodernism is, I guess, all about
fragmentation — the self s distance from
the world and itself and everything. I do
not lament its almost omnipresence. I
merely state that it's happening and we
might need to rethink whether there is
anymore culture. I, for one, cannot say I
would be upset if there is none. I don't
think I would want to find God collec
tively with any of you f—ks.
If we accept that culture is dead,
should we continue to study culture?
Only if studying past cultures is for the
benefit of an individual's desire. Pretend
ing to study it for the sake of our current
culture would clearly by a fallacy.
What about the little circles of pre
postmodernist culture? Should we post
modernists allow them to remain? I
don't know, but I will not criticize you if
you make it your own personal vendetta
to destroy them or bring them into our
world — no longer our world, but my
world, your world, his world, etc.
Hey — we won't have to learn the plu
ral forms of personal pronouns anymore!

Next week: an exploration of ideas and
values.
