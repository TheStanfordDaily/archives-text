Closing FRI would damage hungrg nations

AS A PH.D. graduate of Stanford's
Food Research Institute, I was
recently intrigued to learn that
some Stanford students went on a cam
pus hunger strike in order to initiate a
new comparative ethnic studies insti
tute. I thought to myself, "Enterprising
students!" Now, however, I find it ironic
and even a little sad, given that the
Food Research Institute, traditionally
the place to go at Stanford to learn
about the economics of world food prob
lems, is being dismantled and torn
apart.
Hunger — real hunger, not the kind
you feel while dieting to fit into last
year's clothes — is still a reality in
many Third World countries, especially
those of sub-Saharan Africa after 10
years of structural adjustment policies.
In Nigeria, for example, rural families
who used to have two meals per day
now have one. To cope with this painful
situation, they make light of it and talk
about the time of their one daily meal
by formula (001 = dinner, 100 = break
fast and 010 = lunch) rather than artic
ulately verbalize their hunger. Instead
of asking when they eat, they ask,
"What's the formula today?"
Food production is still a problem in
many Third World countries. Africa, for
example, currently imports a larger pro
portion of its food grains. But in 1995,
the prices of corn on the Chicago Board
of Trade jumped from $2.43 to $3.29 in
spite of a bumper crop. Wheat prices
also jumped from $3.49 to $4.99. This
means that grains at subsidized prices
are going to be increasingly scarce, and
Africa has to start feeding itself.
How can it? Norman Borlaug, the
agronomist who received the Nobel
Peace Prize in the early 1970s for breed

ing rust-resistant wheat varieties, thinks
he has the recipe. He's teamed up with
Jimmy Carter and a Japanese million
aire, Yohei Sasakawa. Together, they're
putting in demonstration plots all over
Ethiopia, Senegal, Ghana, Tanzania and
Togo to show farmers how to get higher
yields, if only they apply fertilizers on
responsive new varieties. The problem?
In some African countries, the price of
fertilizer went up three times last year
and fertilizer use went way down.
Another problem: Women farmers
produce most of Africa's domestic food
supply, while men grow export / cash
crops. Because women don't own land
but have to "beg for land" in most
African societies, they don't have the
collateral to qualify for formal credit, so
banks don't give them credit for fertiliz
er. And because they don't grow cash
crops, they don't have the cash them
selves to buy fertilizer. As a result, the
corn they backpack home from their
fields for three hours at a time is pretty
sorry corn. No wonder there's hunger.
Why can't the government help them
by lowering the price of fertilizer, subsi
dizing it or starting community banks to
give women small loans for fertilizer?
Isn't that a solution? Which one is bet
ter?
Are you interested? These are the
kinds of problems the Food Research
Institute has been addressing for the
last 74 years in courses like the World
Food Economy, and in its publications
and book like "Food Policy Analysis"
and "Transforming Agrarian
Economies." Attention to these kinds of
problems — applied problems of eco
nomic development — has made the
institute unique, apart from not only the
Department of Economics, but also from

the School of Business and the Depart
ment of Anthropology. This kind of a
focus, based on fieldwork in developing
countries, is what has given its Ph.D.
graduates acceptance in prestigious
institutions like the World Bank and the
international agricultural centers.
All the graduates of FRI are engaged
in development work, either directly at
an international agricultural center or
the World Bank, or indirectly at a teach
ing position in an agricultural economics
or economics department. Our career
goals are to increase food production,
solve the "world food problem" and
improve the quality of life of impover
ished peoples in the Third World. This is
why we came to Stanford and put in an
incredible amount of energy to get a
Ph.D. with the "FRI, Stanford" name on
it.
We think it is no exaggeration to state
that FRI has been and is the only place
where Stanford students are trained to
do development work which requires a
knowledge of economics coupled with a
particular set of skills that allow FRI
graduates to apply economic principles
to local development problems and alle
viate the constraints to increased food
production. This applied bent of FRI
graduates, which encourages them to do
fieldwork and live in Third World coun
tries for long periods of time, is unique
among economists, long noted for their
abstract assumptions and emphases on
theoretical issues rather than applied
problems. The ability of FRI-trained
economists to gather their own primary
data under harsh developing-country
conditions is viewed askance and actively
discouraged in a normal economics
department, never mind a prestigious
one such as Stanford's.

It is also not a solution to "let Michi
gan State do it." Currently, the land
grant universities, including the Univer
sity of Florida, are under incredible
pressures to cut their budgets and elimi
nate any expenditures not specifically
directed at clientele in their state.
Unfortunately for Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences John Shoven and his
"restructuring" efforts, the quality of
food research is not likely to be duplicat
ed any time soon. Even more unfortu
nate is that Third World countries des
perately need applied development
economists like those FRI produces,
because they have real problems that
need solving. Policy makers faced with
politically hot issues, such as whether
they should remove the fertilizer subsidy
or start channeling chemical fertilizer to
women farmers, won't get these ques
tions answered by economists out of the
Stanford economics department "partly
because of the economics department's
emphasis on theoretical issues rather
than applied problems" (Ronald McKin
non, Stanford Report, Nov. 8, 1995).
If Stanford eliminates FRI and its
M.S. and Ph.D. program now, it sends a
signal that it is abandoning its develop
ment efforts and the original purpose of
its endowment from the Carnegie Cor
poration and Rockefeller Foundation. It
signals that it no longer wants to help
the poor people of the world escape
grinding poverty.
Does Stanford want to send this sig
nal? This is not the time for Stanford to
divert FRl's endowment to other pur
poses and interests. There must be
another, more creative way to resolve
this conflict of interest.
