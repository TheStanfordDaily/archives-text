# Tyrone!
## Willingham named Pac-10's top coach 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
Last December, much of the
media questioned Tyrone Will
ingham's credentials. Yester
day, Willingham's fellow Pacif
ic 10 Conference football coach
es selected him as the league's
best —the Pac-10 Coach of the
Year.
Although never even a coordi
nator at any level, Willingham was
granted the unen-

viable task of re
building a pro
gram in utter dis
array after three
years under the
tutelage and not
so-watchful eye of
Bay Area demigod
Bill Walsh. Fo
cused from the
outset with a sin-

gular goal to win, his team did just
that — earning a 7-3-1 overall
record and a fourth-place finish (5-
3) in the Pac-10, six notches higher
than most had predicted.
The efforts of Willingham,
his staff and the Cardinal play
ers were rewarded with an invi
tation to the St. Jude Liberty
Bowl against independent
East Carolina (8-3), to be played
on Willingham's 42nd birthday,
Dec. 30. The Memphis-based
bowl had not offered a bowl
berth to a Pac-10 team since
1976.
Willingham and staff have im
proved four games from last
year's 3-7-1 showing despite re
ceiving little help from first-year
players. Three of the top guns in
the Stanford passing arsenal from


Willingham
