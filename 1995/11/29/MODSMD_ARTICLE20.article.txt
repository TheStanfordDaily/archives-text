## Seminal semantics — challenging the stupid boyfriend 
### 
Girls are blind; there are things out
there that are obvious that they just don't
see. Boys, on the other hand, are oblivi
ous; there are things out there and they
see them, it just doesn't register. There's
a big difference.

Okay, I don't care if the shoe fits or
if it quacks like a duck, I am not in
a relationship. And no matter
what you say, I don't have a girlfriend.
I can't. I couldn't.
So what if we rattle the futon two-to
four times daily and are mackin' to the
exclusion of all others? Why does that
necessarily make us a couple? Just
because I'm changing my sheets hourly
and the posters above my bed are all hut
shredded doesn't mean I have to be a
stupid boyfriend.
Sure we spend evenings together more
often than not, and I've seen pictures of
all five of her farmboy brothers; no prob
lem that her mom approved of me and
thought her darling daughter open-mind
ed for dating >gulp< a Jewish boy. I'm
fine with all that.
But I can't be a stupid boyfriend.

You see, I've been seeing someone. We
are dating. Hangin' out. Hookin' up.
Doing mad dashes from the tub room to
her single. And acting cute every so often
to boot. It's almost official.
Despite my best efforts to remain
untainted by the trappings of earthly
attachment, I find myself head over
(receding) hairline for this girl.
And liking it.
Yup, though I'd rather have pictures
of me and Estelle Getty naked in black
socks sent to my grandmother than
become one of those deluded fools whose
girlfriends I used to borrow, I've found
myself braising in an emotional bouill
abaisse of blood, sweat, tears and phlegm.
And though she's wonderfully smart,
extremely funny, exceedingly beautiful,
believes in magic, can think conceptually
and really, really likes me; though sex
with her is not unlike water-skiing naked
through lukewarm Lubraderm; I still
shudder whenever someone describes us
in terms of a full blown, 20-something,
maybe-it'U-last-through-to-grad-school
maybe-it-won't relationship.
I'd rather have my lungs filled with
brisket gravy than be mistaken for one of

those brainless beaux who bail on their
buddies, lose their wits and make that. . .
you know, that face whenever you men
tion their sweetie's name.
I just can't be some stupid girlfriend's
stupid boyfriend — it's that simple.
The romance itself doesn't bother me.
The harmless swapping of sweatshirts
and spit is a fine thing I'd wish upon any
one. The (self)probing brought on by
opening your emotional door is worth all
the risk of the eventual (and inevitable)
ego squooshing — no matter what the
embittered tell you.
But the associations that go with the
title of boyfriend, the implications of idio
cy. . .
Just think: You knew exactly what I
meant when I first mentioned the charac
ter of the stupid boyfriend. I didn't have
to draw a picture of the ungrateful, pre
sumptuous doofus who doesn't know
how to treat a good thing while he's got it
and then sobs his bleary brown eyes out
just as soon as it's gone.
The stupid boyfriend is the one who
gets cheated on. He grows complacent
and forgets what he missed back before
he had it. He's insensitive. He neglects

courtesy and then compensates with pla
giarized poetry. He's the one who —
while she waxes miserable — thinks
everything is just fine. And then he's
bewildered when he gets his sorry ass
dumped.
As if the ability to think cogently gets
shploogered out with each emptying of
the epididymis, we expect a boy's brain to
turn to tater tots once he starts gettin'
some regularly.
And now, just because I'm with some
one and she's with me, there are all these
expectations of me becoming a schmuck.
Thus I wonder: Is it at all possible for me
to pursue a healthy heterosexual sojurn
with this wonderful new pain in the ass
in my life without conforming to the
expectation of idiocy?
It's hard enough for someone with
such an upstanding history of cynicism
about serious dating to delve like this —
even without the pressure to conform.
For millennia, I've thought nothing more
about extended relationships than that
they are dumb and those who engage in
them are even dumber.
But I'm in one now and there's little I
can do to change that. Little I'd want to

do.
When I gave her my fetishist package
of angora tefillen and Nutella, she didn't
slap me. And when she gave me six roses,
bubble bath and a poem that rhymed, I
didn't feel much like throwing up at all.
Yup, she's a keeper.
So with all my issues and admonition,
for all my hypocrisies and hesitations,
I'm doing this thing. Only I don't want it
to be called a relationship, or me a
boyfriend — stupid or otherwise.
Unfortunately, as far as any dating
lexicon goes, the options aren't much bet
ter: Significant other, in its incessantly
PC way, saps all the warmth from the
position. And being a lover has that com
plicating insinuation of a same-sex rela
tionship.
So, please, be creative. Call me a
hoochie, a smoocher, a babe, a squeeze, a
hotty-taken. .Just don't associate me with
that classring-less guy, that putz who
just traded in his awareness for three
orgasms and a date for all seasons.
He'll just get his sorry ass dumped
anyway.
