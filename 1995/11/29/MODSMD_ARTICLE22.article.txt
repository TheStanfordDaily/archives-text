## Butterflies signal changes in the habitat balance 
### Wai Fung Kwok 
For many conservation biologists,
the single most important step to pre
serving an endangered species is to
provide it with a suitable habitat.
However, with the Endangered
Species Act approaching time for re
certification in Congress, protection of
animal habitats — as part of protect
ing the species itself — might lose out
to the economic interests of capitalism.
Since its enactment in the 19705,
the Endangered Species Act has been
strengthened to help the cause of
preservation. However, in this year's
re-certification, the main proposed
change is to get rid of habitat protec
tion.
Under this revision, while it would
still be against the law to do bodily
harm to an endangered bird, animal
or plant, it would be legal to overtake
their natural habitats for economic
interest. If these proposed changes are
put into effect, any future clashes
between the spotted owl and the lum
ber industry of the Pacific Northwest,
for example, would end in industry's
favor.
"There are many who argue, 'Eco
nomics have been ignored.' True,
there are problems with the regula
tions, but Congress might have the
wrong solutions." said Carol Boggs,
director of the Center for Conserva
tion Biology at Stanford.
"But it is biodiversity that supports
economics. All industries are depen
dent on products of the natural world.
If you destroy these natural bases,
industries will also die," she said.

Boggs has been studying the inter
action between butterflies and their
habitat for the past 20 years. "Butter
flies are exemplary organisms for
research in that they are relatively
easy to study," said Boggs. "They are
easy to detect and catch in the field."
Her research indicates that we can
learn tremendous amounts about eco
logical systems by studying these crea
tures. Many generalizations can be
made from these studies and applied
to insects and humans.
For example, butterflies are very
picky in terms of the habitat they
want to live in. They need the right
microenvironment to survive. They
feed on specific host plants and, thus,
are associated with the plant commu
nities.
"Since they need some very specific
habitat requirements in order to be
able to fly and survive, they are pretty
sensitive indicators of the health of a
particular area," stated Boggs.
Her studies show that when there
is something wrong with the environ
ment, a drop in the butterfly popula
tion could be the first indicator. When
humans damage a habitat through
grazing or logging, this has a major
effect on the butterflies' ability to
reproduce.
This finding has relevance
throughout the ecological system.
Plant reproduction is dependent on
pollinators like butterflies. Likewise,
many animals and insects feed on
these plants. Most species of insects
and animals cannot survive in perma
nently damaged habitats lacking their
essential food source.

Boggs' studies of butterflies indi
cate that it is not enough to protect
endangered species alone. Their natu
ral habitats must also be preserved. A
panel from the National Academy of
Science confirmed this assertion in a
report released last May, which specif
ically maintains that species cannot be
saved unless the habitats they depend
on are also preserved. The panel calls
for a strengthening of the Endangered
Species Act to slow an extinction rate
that it called "as great as any in the
fossil record."
"People are trying to argue that the
definition of harm to a species, or to
an individual within a species, should
be restricted to physically battering,
physically killing, physically maiming,
physically capturing, physically chas
ing it," said Boggs.
If the Endangered Species Act is
revised to allow humans to intrude
upon natural habitats, then butterfly
population decreases may only be the
first of many casualties, she said.
Boggs urges Stanford students to
get involved in research on local
endangered species such as the Cali
fornia tiger salamander, and to collect
valuable data for local environmental
agencies. This is especially crucial now
because Congress wants to reduce the
budget by cutting environmental
agencies such as the National Biologi
cal Service, a federal agency that gen
erates data on rare species, she added.
"You can't do anything construc
tive in regard to biodiversity without
this kind of information," said Boggs.
"We need this information on which
to base our policies."
