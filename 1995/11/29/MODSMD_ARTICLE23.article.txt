# Study seeks to improve critical care
## 
### Laura Lane Contributing writer 
In the age of high tech
nology medical heroics,
the end of life often brings
about images of machines
with digital displays and
plastic tubes trying, some
times in vain, to save a
life.
The intensive care unit
represents all the best of
medical technology and,
at a price, is used to sup
port lives hanging in the
balance.
This price not only
includes monetary consid
erations, but more impor
tantly, the price of the
patient's dignity and the
emotional pain of the
patient's family.
At what point is this
"price" too high? How do
physicians know when to
stop? How can they ease
the physical and emotion
al pain of death for the
patient and the patient's
family?
In a recent issue of the
Journal of the American
Medical Association, Dr.
Leslie Lenert, assistant
professor in the School of
Medicine, and graduate
student Jeffrey Belkora,
have proposed a model
which may aid physicians
in making critical deci
sions in the intensive care
unit (ICU). The aim of
this model is to increase
the quality of care given to
critically ill patients.
Lenert and Belkora
worked in collaboration
with Dr. Laura Esserman
ofUSCF.
This model seeks to
support physicians in
their decisions to avoid
"bad outcomes."
According to Lenert, a
bad outcome is one in
which too many interven
tions are used, causing
unnecessary suffering for
the patient.
This study attempts to
help physicians to identify
"urUn llfn

those patients, who we
feel really don't do well in spite of all the
resources," explained Esserman.
Being able to predict a patient's response
to care allows the physician to make better
decisions concerning the outcome.
Lenert defined quality care as, "using med
ical services in as aggressive a fashion as they
[physicians] can to save people, and then,
when they don't see a response, stepping back
when they might be doing harm with their
intervention.''
In the study, researchers looked at how
well a patient survived illness in relation to
the amount of resources used in the hospital.
They were then able to come up with a
model which could be used to measure the
potential effectiveness of treatment given to
critically ill patients.
This measurement was termed Potentially
Ineffective Care (PIC), which was defined as
being "care given to patients who, despite pro
longed intensive support, die either in the
hospital or shortly after hospital discharge."

For each patient studied, the number of
days of survival following discharge from the
hospital was noted, as well as the amount of
resources they used while in the hospital.
Those patients who survived less than 100
days after hospital discharge while having
spent more than $400,000 for medical care
fell into the PIC category.
In an attempt to classify these patients, the
researchers looked at the database of a com
puter program called the APACHE — Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation.
When a sample of 402 Stanford ICU
patients were studied, it was found that 11
percent of these patients were PIC, using up
32 percent of the hospital's resources.
To use APACHE, physicians enter a
patient's age, pre-existing conditions, prior
location in hospital and ICU admission diag
nosis, including specific physiological indica
tors.
With this data, the program then calcu
lates the patient's risk. When used over a
period of five days, physicians can observe a

patient's response to the interventions being
used in the ICU.
The physicians can then use these figures
to predict PIC by multiplying the Day 1 and
Day 5 figures. Patients for whom the product
was 0.35 or higher were predicted to have
received PIC.
By using this proposed model, physicians
can determine, not only the efficacy of treat
ments, but also, the "physiological reserve,"
or the ability of the body to respond to treat
ment.
"We're professionals, we're prepared to
fight the next battle whenever we lose one,
and (prepared] to continue the war," elabo
rated Lenert. "The issue is, that at some
point, we have to recognize that this aggres
sive behavior is no longer in the patient's
interest."
According to Lenert, the purpose of the
PIC method is to equip physicians with the
ability to know when the "cure is possible,
and to comfort when nothing else can be
done.
