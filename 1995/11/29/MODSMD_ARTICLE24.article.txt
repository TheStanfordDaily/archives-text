## Flushing waters 
### Jessen Yu Contributing writer 
Do toilets really flush
in the urong direction
• in the Southern
Hemisphere?
A First of all, I would like
• to say that there is no
• wrong way for water to
flow down a drain or flush down
a toilet. As we have all learned
from countless hours of CIV, we
should try to understand how
the water flows in other soci
eties and not judge their soci
etal drainage patterns against
how water flows in our highly
biased, western society You see,
their drainage world view is
just as valid as ours.
Besides, I don't think anyone
knows which way our toilets
are supposed to flush, anyway.
In order to try to find out, I had
to conduct a series of highly sci
entific studies to determine
which way the toilets really do
flush around here.
So, I went into the bathroom
and flushed all the toilets. This
turned out to be a fruitless
experiment, since all of the toi
lets were equipped with the
"quick flush" mechanism which
pretty much sucked all the
water out of the toilet basins at
supersonic speeds.
Many people think that the
Coriolis effect is responsible for
the spiraling of water down the
drain. Many of these people also
have no idea what the Coriolis
effect is, but they think they
sound smart when they say it.
The Coriolis effect is a ficti
tious force which we find when
we deal with motion in a rotat
ing reference frame. In English,
this means that things act a lit
tle funny when we're spinning.
I don't mean just dizziness,
though — there's some real
physics going on here.
To see where the Coriolis
effect comes from, imagine you
are standing next to a very
large, spinning merry-go
round. Now. if someone sitting
at the very middle of this
merry-go-round were to throw
a ball, you would see the ball
travel in a straight line away
from the center.
To the thrower, however,
who is sitting on the rotating
merry-go-round, the ball will
look like it curved to the side
because he or she turns during
the ball's flight. It seems as
though some mysterious force
has pushed the ball to the side.
This force is what we call the
Coriolis effect, and it depends
on which way you are spinning.
In the Northern Hemisphere,
moving objects tend to the
right, whereas in the Southern
Hemisphere, moving objects
turn to the left.
Of course, this force only
acts on objects which are mov

ing in the rotating reference
frame. The fictitious Coriolis
effect will not push on objects
which are not moving.
For a rapidly spinning refer
ence frame, the Coriolis effect is
easily observed. The earth,
however, does not spin very
rapidly. If you do the math, it
turns out that the earth spins
at a rate of about once per day.
That's not very fast at all and
results in a very small Coriolis
effect.
That's not to say that the
Coriolis effect doesn't affect

earthly matters. On a large
enough scale, the Coriolis effect
becomes a significant factor in
movement over the planet's
surface. For instance, the
Coriolis effect does have a very
noticeable influence on the
weather.
All hurricanes in the
Northern Hemisphere rotate
counterclockwise, whereas in
the Southern Hemisphere, they
rotate clockwise. If you were
paying attention earlier, this
might seem like the wrong
direction for rotation. The dif
ference in direction has to do
with the fact that hurricanes
are low-pressure systems. For
more information, contact your
local meteorologist.
The Coriolis effect also
affects ocean currents, and
there is evidence that it has
some influence over the Psychic
Friends Network.
On the scale of your typical
bathtub or toilet, however, the
Coriolis effect is negligible.
Factors such as preexisting
water movement and the shape
of the water container and
drain play a much bigger role in
determining the direction the
water spirals out.
If you really did want to try
to investigate the Coriolis
effect, though, you would need
a perfectly symmetric basin
with a perfectly symmetric
drain plug which you could
remove in a perfectly symmet
ric way. After eliminating all of
these factors, the effect would
still be very hard to see on such
a small scale.
Or, more simply, you could
try flushing a toilet a few miles
wide.
Berkeley comes to mind.
