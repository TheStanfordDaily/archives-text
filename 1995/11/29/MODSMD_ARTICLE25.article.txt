## No. 16 Stanford falls to USF in shocking upset Last-second shot by Dons downs Cardinal basketball

Stanford . 58

Last night, it was cold enough
for Hell to freeze over in the Cow
Palace. That may have had some
thing to do with Stanford men's
basketball losing to the University
of San Francisco 59-58 as well.
lxx)king past the Dons to this
weekend's tournament action in
North Carolina, the No. 16 Cardi
nal were upended by a team with
out its star and a coach searching
for his first Division I victory.
With Stanford ahead by one
after freshman Arthur Lee sank
one of two free throws with 32 sec
onds left, USF head coach Phil
Matthews inserted Gerald Walker,
his all-everything guard who had
yet to practice due to a broken foot,
for the Dons' final offensive attack.
1 lowever, Walker was just a decoy
for freshman Michael Colter, who
banked in a pull-up 10-foot jumper
to give USF the lead with 4.8 sec
onds remaining.
A last-second off-balance runner
by senior Dion Cross banged off the
rim and a putback by senior for
ward Andy Poppink also bounced
out, leaving Stanford looking for
answers.
"There's no excuse for coming
out and not playing well," said head
coach Mike Montgomery. "We got
outplayed in every aspect of the
game. We had no emotion — we
have got to find a way to get these
kids to plav hard and move the
ball."

Lee was in the game for the fin.il
two minutes, one second lx>cause
junior point guard Brevin Knight
had fouled out. Five minutes into
the second half, Knight picked up
his third foul on an offensive charge
during a break-away and then a
technical foul for protesting the
call, which also counted as a per
sonal foul. After sitting for almost
10 minutes, Knight returned only
to be disqualified on a simple reach
in.
"I Knight's technical] was not a
good play, not a mature play,"
Montgomery said. "We went with
Art because he is a little quicker,
and we were trying to get some
emotion into our basketball team.
We would have had no chance with
out him."
Lee proved to be one of the only
sparks in an anemic Stanford
attack. He hit a couple key jumpers
to help Stanford fight back from a
29-21 halflime deficit and finished
with eight points. No one else could
get on track, as the Cardinal shot
only 29.8 percent for the game, 21.9
percent in the first half.
"I never remember shooting 29
percent with this team," Mont
gomery said. "We didn't make the
extra pass and took bad shots.
Their style compounds the frustra
tion, and we tended to reach a little
lut "
That style was a hodgepodge of
defensive sets aimed at keeping
Knight and Cross from coming up
big. The tandem was held to only 12
points on five-of-24 shooting. Cross
missed 14 of 16 shots and all five of
his three-point attempts, while
Knight had five turnovers and only
one assist.
"I'd be lying to you if I told you I
wasn't surprised," Matthews said.
"But we executed our game plan

right down to the letter."
Matthews said he felt if his team
kept the score in the 50s, the Dons
would have an excellent chance to
win. Although Stanford out
rebounded USF 49-28 (24-9 on the
offensive glass), the Cardinal
couldn't convert those caroms into
points.
"We battled all night against a
size disadvantage, but our kids had
no quit in them," Matthews said.
Coming off a 68-65 overtime loss
to Bucknell, the Dons t(*)k to the
role of giant-killer from the begin
ning of the game. Out-hustling
Stanford to loose balls and forcing
the Cardinal into several bad shots,
USF capitalized on key Stanford
turnovers over the final two min
utes despite only shooting 36 per
cent from the field.
A hobbled inbounds pass from
Poppink to Lee just alter Knight
fouled out kept the Cardinal from
extending its two-point lead and a
forced ptiss by senior David Har
bour with one minute left allowed
the Dons to tie the score at 57 on a
runningjumper by Colter.
"We didn't prepare well mental
ly at all for this game," Lee said.
"We just didn't shoot the ball well
and didn't take them seriously."
Don forward John Duggan, who
led all scorers with 23, said there
was no intimidation factor.
"Last year they l)eat us by 38
points," Duggan said. "I was think
ing about this game for a long
time."
Despite Stanford's experience in
returning its top six players from
last year, Montgomery saw a
remarkable lack of leadership dur
ing crucial stretches of the game.
"I'm looking at the veterans and
not seeing much happening," he
said.

for Hell to freeze over in the Cow
Palace. That may have had some
thing to do with Stanford men's
basketball losing to the University
of San Francisco 59-58 as well.
lxx)king past the Dons to this
weekend's tournament action in
North Carolina, the No. 16 Cardi
nal were upended by a team with
out its star and a coach searching
for his first Division I victory.
With Stanford ahead by one
after freshman Arthur Lee sank
one of two free throws with 32 sec
onds left, USF head coach Phil
Matthews inserted Gerald Walker,
his all-everything guard who had
yet to practice due to a broken foot,
for the Dons' final offensive attack.
1 lowever, Walker was just a decoy
for freshman Michael Colter, who
banked in a pull-up 10-foot jumper
to give USF the lead with 4.8 sec
onds remaining.
A last-second off-balance runner
by senior Dion Cross banged off the
rim and a putback by senior for
ward Andy Poppink also bounced
out, leaving Stanford looking for
answers.
"There's no excuse for coming
out and not playing well," said head
coach Mike Montgomery. "We got
outplayed in every aspect of the
game. We had no emotion — we
have got to find a way to get these
kids to plav hard and move the
ball."

Lee was in the game for the fin.il
two minutes, one second lx>cause
junior point guard Brevin Knight
had fouled out. Five minutes into
the second half, Knight picked up
his third foul on an offensive charge
during a break-away and then a
technical foul for protesting the
call, which also counted as a per
sonal foul. After sitting for almost
10 minutes, Knight returned only
to be disqualified on a simple reach
in.
"I Knight's technical] was not a
good play, not a mature play,"
Montgomery said. "We went with
Art because he is a little quicker,
and we were trying to get some
emotion into our basketball team.
We would have had no chance with
out him."
Lee proved to be one of the only
sparks in an anemic Stanford
attack. He hit a couple key jumpers
to help Stanford fight back from a
29-21 halflime deficit and finished
with eight points. No one else could
get on track, as the Cardinal shot
only 29.8 percent for the game, 21.9
percent in the first half.
"I never remember shooting 29
percent with this team," Mont
gomery said. "We didn't make the
extra pass and took bad shots.
Their style compounds the frustra
tion, and we tended to reach a little
lut "
That style was a hodgepodge of
defensive sets aimed at keeping
Knight and Cross from coming up
big. The tandem was held to only 12
points on five-of-24 shooting. Cross
missed 14 of 16 shots and all five of
his three-point attempts, while
Knight had five turnovers and only
one assist.
"I'd be lying to you if I told you I
wasn't surprised," Matthews said.
"But we executed our game plan

right down to the letter."
Matthews said he felt if his team
kept the score in the 50s, the Dons
would have an excellent chance to
win. Although Stanford out
rebounded USF 49-28 (24-9 on the
offensive glass), the Cardinal
couldn't convert those caroms into
points.
"We battled all night against a
size disadvantage, but our kids had
no quit in them," Matthews said.
Coming off a 68-65 overtime loss
to Bucknell, the Dons t(*)k to the
role of giant-killer from the begin
ning of the game. Out-hustling
Stanford to loose balls and forcing
the Cardinal into several bad shots,
USF capitalized on key Stanford
turnovers over the final two min
utes despite only shooting 36 per
cent from the field.
A hobbled inbounds pass from
Poppink to Lee just alter Knight
fouled out kept the Cardinal from
extending its two-point lead and a
forced ptiss by senior David Har
bour with one minute left allowed
the Dons to tie the score at 57 on a
runningjumper by Colter.
"We didn't prepare well mental
ly at all for this game," Lee said.
"We just didn't shoot the ball well
and didn't take them seriously."
Don forward John Duggan, who
led all scorers with 23, said there
was no intimidation factor.
"Last year they l)eat us by 38
points," Duggan said. "I was think
ing about this game for a long
time."
Despite Stanford's experience in
returning its top six players from
last year, Montgomery saw a
remarkable lack of leadership dur
ing crucial stretches of the game.
"I'm looking at the veterans and
not seeing much happening," he
said.

against the Owls with a loss to USF last night.
