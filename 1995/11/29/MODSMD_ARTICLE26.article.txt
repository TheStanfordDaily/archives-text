# Swimmers dominate at Pac-10s

Still going.
Last Saturday, Sunday and Monday,
the Stanford men's swimming team
once again outdistanced its Pacific 10
Conference competition at Long Beach
State, winning its unprecedented 15th
straight conference championship. The
Cardinal beat second-place USC 846-
535 to keep its streak alive.
"This is just a level of excellence
that we have achieved," said junior dis
tance swimmer Kevin Radvany.
"Nobody wants to disappoint the guys
who have gone before us."
Each year, head coach Skip Kenney
reminds the Cardinal of the winning
tradition of Stanford men's swimming.
He urges them to win for themselves,
their teammates and their predeces
sors.
"Coach Kenney always tells us that
we're standing on the shoulders of
giants," said senior co-captain Ray

Carey. "You come to realize that the
tradition is bigger than you. You don't
have the right to give it away."

excellence that we have

wants to disappoint the
guys that have gone
before us.'

There was some cause for concern in
the early going, as the Cardinal sported
only a 36-point lead after Saturday's
events.
"In a competition where you score
800 or 900 points, a 36-point lead is not

very big," Carey said. "We need to
work on getting ready for the first
day."
The swimmers realized on Sunday
that they had to step up and prove that
they are the championship contenders
they believe themselves to be.
"It seemed like on Saturday, people
were waiting for someone else to have a
big race," Carey said. "Hut Sunday,
everyone realized that it was up to
them to do their job and swim fast.
"The overall performance was fan
tastic. Sunday and Monday, we stepped
it up and really gave championship
efforts and performances. It was an
NCAA championship team on Sunday
and Monday."
Stanford now has the remainder of
the season to prepare itself for the
NCAA Championships, which will take
place in March.
For the Cardinal, perhaps the most
encouraging aspect of the Pac-10 meet
was the performance of the
freshmen. Several demonstrat
ed that they can be point scorers
at the NCAAs next spring. Tate
Blahnik continued his early-sea
son success with a victory in the
200-yard backstroke, while Dod
Wales captured the 100-yard
freestyle, edging last year's sec
ond-place winner, teammate
Scott Claypool.
"1 didn't know what to expect
going into the meet," Wales
said. "After I qualified in trials,
I knew 1 could swim faster in the
finals. I really wanted to win,
and I expected to."
The more experienced swim
mers also swam well. The Cardi
nal qualified 10 swimmers with
automatic qualifying times and

10 more with consideration
times. While veterans like
Carey, Radvany and sophomore
Tom Wilkens lived up to their
potential, sophomore Sabir
Muhammad demonstrated his
all-around skill with wins in
both the 100-yard backstroke
and the 100-yard butterfly.
Junior Scott Jones came into
stride with a qualifying time in
the 800-yard freestyle relay and
consideration times in the 100-
and 200-yard freestyle.
Such performances are exact
ly what the Cardinal needs to
close the gap on Michigan, last
year's NCAA champion and this
year's top-ranked team.
"On paper, we're inches
behind Michigan," Carey said.
"But we have a lot more upside
potential than they might. We
have freshmen who have
stepped up. Tate Blahnik was a
few tenths off of I Derek J Weath

erford's Pac-10 record. Scott
Jones had a fantastic meet. He
will go from a guy who did not
make NCAAs last year to some
one who makes a big impact.
Our upside potential is that we
know these guys are not going to
just make it to NCAAs, but are
going to really score big points."
Overall, Stanford winners
included Wales, Muhammad,
Blahnik, Andre Salles-Cunha
(100-yard breast), Carey,
Wilkens (200- and 400-yard
individual medley), the 400-yard
freestyle relay team (Claypool,
Chris Olson, Jones and Wales),
the 200-yard medley relay team
(Blahnik, Wilkens, Muhammad
and Claypool), the 400-yard
medley relay team (Blahink,
Wilkens, Muhammad and
Wales) and the 800-yard
freestyle relay team (Wales,
Jones, Eric Diehl and Scott Gag
ner).

Stanford now has the remainder of
the season to prepare itself for the
NCAA Championships, which will take
place in March.
For the Cardinal, perhaps the most
encouraging aspect of the Pac-10 meet
was the performance of the
freshmen. Several demonstrat
ed that they can be point scorers
at the NCAAs next spring. Tate
Blahnik continued his early-sea
son success with a victory in the
200-yard backstroke, while Dod
Wales captured the 100-yard
freestyle, edging last year's sec
ond-place winner, teammate
Scott Claypool.
"1 didn't know what to expect
going into the meet," Wales
said. "After I qualified in trials,
I knew 1 could swim faster in the
finals. I really wanted to win,
and I expected to."
The more experienced swim
mers also swam well. The Cardi
nal qualified 10 swimmers with
automatic qualifying times and

10 more with consideration
times. While veterans like
Carey, Radvany and sophomore
Tom Wilkens lived up to their
potential, sophomore Sabir
Muhammad demonstrated his
all-around skill with wins in
both the 100-yard backstroke
and the 100-yard butterfly.
Junior Scott Jones came into
stride with a qualifying time in
the 800-yard freestyle relay and
consideration times in the 100-
and 200-yard freestyle.
Such performances are exact
ly what the Cardinal needs to
close the gap on Michigan, last
year's NCAA champion and this
year's top-ranked team.
"On paper, we're inches
behind Michigan," Carey said.
"But we have a lot more upside
potential than they might. We
have freshmen who have
stepped up. Tate Blahnik was a
few tenths off of I Derek J Weath

erford's Pac-10 record. Scott
Jones had a fantastic meet. He
will go from a guy who did not
make NCAAs last year to some
one who makes a big impact.
Our upside potential is that we
know these guys are not going to
just make it to NCAAs, but are
going to really score big points."
Overall, Stanford winners
included Wales, Muhammad,
Blahnik, Andre Salles-Cunha
(100-yard breast), Carey,

Wilkens, Muhammad and
Wales) and the 800-yard

ner).
