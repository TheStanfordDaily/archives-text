Still going.
Last Saturday, Sunday and Monday,
the Stanford men's swimming team
once again outdistanced its Pacific 10
Conference competition at Long Beach
State, winning its unprecedented 15th
straight conference championship. The
Cardinal beat second-place USC 846-
535 to keep its streak alive.
"This is just a level of excellence
that we have achieved," said junior dis
tance swimmer Kevin Radvany.
"Nobody wants to disappoint the guys
who have gone before us."
Each year, head coach Skip Kenney
reminds the Cardinal of the winning
tradition of Stanford men's swimming.
He urges them to win for themselves,
their teammates and their predeces
sors.
"Coach Kenney always tells us that
we're standing on the shoulders of
giants," said senior co-captain Ray

Carey. "You come to realize that the
tradition is bigger than you. You don't
have the right to give it away."

There was some cause for concern in
the early going, as the Cardinal sported
only a 36-point lead after Saturday's
events.
"In a competition where you score
800 or 900 points, a 36-point lead is not

very big," Carey said. "We need to
work on getting ready for the first
day."
The swimmers realized on Sunday
that they had to step up and prove that
they are the championship contenders
they believe themselves to be.
"It seemed like on Saturday, people
were waiting for someone else to have a
big race," Carey said. "Hut Sunday,
everyone realized that it was up to
them to do their job and swim fast.
"The overall performance was fan
tastic. Sunday and Monday, we stepped
it up and really gave championship
efforts and performances. It was an
NCAA championship team on Sunday
and Monday."
Stanford now has the remainder of
the season to prepare itself for the
NCAA Championships, which will take
place in March.
For the Cardinal, perhaps the most
encouraging aspect of the Pac-10 meet
