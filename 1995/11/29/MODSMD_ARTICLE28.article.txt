# Ultimate has eyes set on championships this year
## 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
With sandals slapping and loincloths flap
ping, members of the Stanford Ultimate
Community are preparing for an ultimate
frisbee season of Biblical proportions.
Much like Sampson, with curly locks
flowing down to his ankles, the Stanford
men's and women's ultimate teams arc look
ing strong. Last year, the Cardinal men,
affectionately known as the Scrubs, battled
to a third-place finish nationally. Meanwhile,
the women befuddled the competition by
vaulting their way to second in the nation in
their first-ever appearance at nationals.
Unlike the Biblical hero, however, these
Herculean teams will not topple the pillars of
the Philistines upon themselves. Rather,
they will go forth and slay thousands with
the jawbone of an ass — figuratively speak
ing of course.
"It promises to be a good year," said
senior co-captain Mike 'Rico' Payne. "I think
our astronomical depth makes the Mariana
trench look like a toddler's sandbox."
True to their name, the Scrubs cleaned up
a mess the weekend of Nov. 18-19 in Santa
Cruz, home of banana slugs, marijuana and
the lost boys.
Serving notice that 409, Windex and Mr.

Clean have nothing on them, the Scrubs
wiped out the competition at their first tour
nament of the season. The men went 8-0 on
the weekend, erasing their opponents by a
combined score of 92-39. By going undefeat
ed in eight games, the Scrubs firmly estab
lished themselves as the nation's foremost
grunge killer.
"Our potent blend of detergent will scrub
a-dub our opponents as clean as a baby's bot -
tom, or my bottom for that matter," said
senior co-captain Randy 'Lion's Den' Hulett.
Displaying even greater dominance, the
Stanford women's team, Superfly, coasted to
victory in the women's division. Though
Superfly, in a cunning tactical maneuver,
split into two teams, both teams coasted
through pool play and the elimination
rounds to meet one another in an all-Stan
ford final.
To spectators, it may have seemed that it
would Uike nothing less than a legion of
angels to defeat the two Stanford squads.
Opposing teams testified to the God-given
power of the Scrubs and Superfly as they
watched the carnage from the sidelines.
Women's captain "Mistress" Dominique
Fontenette characterized the opposition's
frustration by evoking a Greek deity.
"Just as Sisyphus was con
demned to roll a large boulder up £
tremendous hill only to have it rol
all the way down to the Ixjttom,'
Fontenette said, "our opponents are
engaged in an unattainable task
which they may yet choose to pur

sue. I guess they'll end up finding
out the hard way, just like Sisy
phus."
On an even darker note for Stan
ford's future opponents, the Scrubs
were missing many returning veter
ans from last year's squeaky-clean
squad, while Superfly competed (as
two teams) without the services of
temporarily-injured Ail-American
Fontenette. The unification of each
of these teams could spell Armaged

don for any who face them.
Both teams cordially invite fans
to swing by Roble Gym to see their
newly acquired trophies, bur
nished to mirror brightness. But
don't be surprised if they stand for
lorn in a nearly empty case. The
teams are saving space for all the
trophies yet to come this year —
including dual national champi
onship trophies if all goes well for
the Cardinal.
