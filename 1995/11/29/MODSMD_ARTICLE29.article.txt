# SI snub spells good things for Cardinal men's hoops
## 
### 
After seeing the Cardinal football team
ranked No. 70 and picked to finish
second to last in the Pacific 10 Con
ference by Sports Illustrated, Stanford fans
should all feel pretty good, despite last
night's fiasco in 'Frisco, about the fact that
the Cardinal men's basketball team was left
out of Si's preseason list of top-20 college
basketball teams even though it's returning
its top six players, including three Ail-
American candidates.

After all, SI did nominate USC as the
No. 1 football team in the country three
months ago, and we all know how accurate
ly that prediction turned out â€” about as
well as it did for Arizona, who plummeted
from that top spot after being splashed on

the cover in last season's gridiron preview.
The same fate has befallen wonder hoy
Tohy Bailey down in sunny Los Angeles.
After seeing himself at every newsstand in
West wood and around the country for that
matter (Bailey was featured on the cover of
numerous magazines), Bailey and his com
rades proceeded to take their immature
ranting and raving to Maui for nothing
more than a lesson in class from Santa
Clara and Vanderbilt.
Georgetown, lowa and Michigan were
similarly perched near the top of Si's list
along with UCLA, but in just the first week
of the season, they have also dropped con
siderably.
Still, I have to admit that I felt a little
dejected upon first opening my copy of SI.
After seeing the expected among the top
five, my eyes scrolled downward. Needless
to say, I was still scrolling when I hit the
bottom of the page. Yet, after a bit of reflec
tion, I am convinced that this rejection
translates into a good thing for the Cardi
nal, ranked No. 15 in the official national
poll before the loss to USF.
Sports Illustrated is the most widely


Courtney
Mann
read sports publication and out
side of the official poll, the sports
community puts a lot of faith into
its material. After a fall filled with
expectations and preseason award
nominations, SI gave the Cardi
nal yet another weapon: Stanford
now has something to prove.
Maybe the Cardinal didn't
prove it in last night's somewhat
embarrasing loss to USF, but no
one on this campus doubts that
this year's team has the potential
to be Stanford's best-ever. Come
March, the early season upset to
the Dons won't be much more
than a faint memory. The team
itself seems confident after a sea
son of competing with the Pac
l()'s best, winning its first NCAA
tournament game in over half a
century and bringing in a solid
recruiting class to answer last
season's bench problems. The
Sixth Man Club has become more
popular than ever, demonstrating
the fans' realization of what may
be in store for them this season.
Yet, someone out there has
provided a figurative slap in the
face to that newfound confidence,
telling the Cardinal that it isn't
for real yet, claiming that despite
a seemingly tremendous improve
ment in the past few years, the

Stanford men's basketball pro
gram has not developed into a
perennial contender. Somehow, I
think head coach Mike Mont
gomery and Brevin Knight might
take offense to that.
In being excluded from Si's top
20, the Cardinal happens to Ik* in
some seriously impressive compa
ny. Believe it or not, Duke and
North Carolina do not appear in
the magazine's rankings. While
they are both lacking in talent and
will most likely not be in the run
ning for the national championship
come April, something tells me
that both Mike Krzyzewski and
Dean Smith will put solid squads
on the floor this season.
Already, the Blue Devils and
the Tarheels have made some
noise this season. Duke turned
heads North by capturing the title
at the Great Alaska Shootout
despite a rigorous route to the
crown through Indiana and lowa.
The Tarheels also surprised crit
ics by going 2-1 in Maui, almost
shocking a top-five squad in Vil
lanova with a two-point loss in
the tournament final.
Pac-10 rival Arizona, counted
out by most with Damon
Stoudamire's departure, failed to
meet Si's standards as a top-20
squad, but went on to take the
preseason NIT last weekend. The
Wildcats, featuring a frightening
lv balanced attack much like one
the Cardinal should have, rolled

over Si's No. 20 Arkansas, No. 11
Michigan and No. 6 Georgetown
successively on their way to the
NIT crown.
Finally, the most telling detail
in Si's preseason preview sits in
the magazine's No. 19 slot. The
Pac-10's second representative in
Si's rankings after UCLA is Cal.
Sure, Cal does have a lot of talent,
but we all know that come tour
nament time, we will be waving
good-bve once again to our
beloved Golden Bears.
In all reality, Sports Illustrat
ed, the New York Times of sports
journalism, has just had some rot
ten luck in picking its covers for
its preseason predictions. Only
one team can win it all, and fore
seeing the winner of a champi
onship taking place six months
from publication would be pretty
impressive. Yet, recognizing the
recent curse it seems to be spread
ing all over its favorites, SI should
consider putting its No. 2 pick on
the cover.

Forget about the SI jinx. Courtney
and Dan are looking to set a new
standard. The Cowboys got their
teeth kicked in and the Hills lost
three in a row after Dan showered
praise upon them. It hasn't
stopped either with Kentucky,
Dan's favorite to win it all, and
Stanford, highly-regarded by both
your sports editors, losing last
night.
