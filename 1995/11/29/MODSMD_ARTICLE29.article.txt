# SI snub spells good things for Cardinal men's hoops
## 
### 
After seeing the Cardinal football team
ranked No. 70 and picked to finish
second to last in the Pacific 10 Con
ference by Sports Illustrated, Stanford fans
should all feel pretty good, despite last
night's fiasco in 'Frisco, about the fact that
the Cardinal men's basketball team was left
out of Si's preseason list of top-20 college
basketball teams even though it's returning
its top six players, including three Ail-
American candidates.

After all, SI did nominate USC as the
No. 1 football team in the country three
months ago, and we all know how accurate
ly that prediction turned out â€” about as
well as it did for Arizona, who plummeted
from that top spot after being splashed on

the cover in last season's gridiron preview.
The same fate has befallen wonder hoy
Tohy Bailey down in sunny Los Angeles.
After seeing himself at every newsstand in
West wood and around the country for that
matter (Bailey was featured on the cover of
numerous magazines), Bailey and his com
rades proceeded to take their immature
ranting and raving to Maui for nothing
more than a lesson in class from Santa
Clara and Vanderbilt.
Georgetown, lowa and Michigan were
similarly perched near the top of Si's list
along with UCLA, but in just the first week
of the season, they have also dropped con
siderably.
Still, I have to admit that I felt a little
dejected upon first opening my copy of SI.
After seeing the expected among the top
five, my eyes scrolled downward. Needless
to say, I was still scrolling when I hit the
bottom of the page. Yet, after a bit of reflec
tion, I am convinced that this rejection
translates into a good thing for the Cardi
nal, ranked No. 15 in the official national
poll before the loss to USF.
Sports Illustrated is the most widely
