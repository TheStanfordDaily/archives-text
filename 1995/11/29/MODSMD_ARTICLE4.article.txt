budget-cutting trends may also prompt more layoffs
next year.
SLAC Director Burton Richter announced the
need to lay off 60 to 70 permanent employees in a
speech last Monday. The layoffs were prompted by
federal funding cuts contained in the Energy and
Water Bill signed by President Clinton on Nov. 14.
Budget reductions will actually require more em
ployee cutbacks than first announced, according to
SLAC Personnel Director Lee Lyon. Approximately

— temporary staff hired for as little as a few months
to as much as two years to work on special projects —
must also be cut to meet new budget constraints, he
said.
"The situation regarding science funding is very
uncertain," said Richter. "Our problem this year is
not a one-time problem."
He added that "projecting on the basis of current
estimates, we may have to reduce staff by another 60
to 70 people in the next fiscal year."
The Energy and Water Bill reduced SLAC's oper
