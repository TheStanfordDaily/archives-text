# SLAC layoffs could top 100
## 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
Proposed layoffs at the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center could ultimately affect more than 100 em
ployees when temporary workers are considered as
well, SI.AC administrators said this week. Federal
budget-cutting trends may also prompt more layoffs
next year.
SLAC Director Burton Richter announced the
need to lay off 60 to 70 permanent employees in a
speech last Monday. The layoffs were prompted by
federal funding cuts contained in the Energy and
Water Bill signed by President Clinton on Nov. 14.
Budget reductions will actually require more em
ployee cutbacks than first announced, according to
SLAC Personnel Director Lee Lyon. Approximately
30 out of more than 100 so called "contract workers"
— temporary staff hired for as little as a few months
to as much as two years to work on special projects —
must also be cut to meet new budget constraints, he
said.
"The situation regarding science funding is very
uncertain," said Richter. "Our problem this year is
not a one-time problem."
He added that "projecting on the basis of current
estimates, we may have to reduce staff by another 60
to 70 people in the next fiscal year."
The Energy and Water Bill reduced SLAC's oper
ating budget by 7 percent, which translates roughly
to a loss of $7 million.
"When you have big numbers
to make up, you almost always
have to make it up through per
sonnel," Lyon said.
Nonetheless, there are jobs
available in other departments of
where funding has actual
ly increased. According to Lyon,
the Stanford Synchrotron Radia
tion Lab (SSRL) division plans to
hire about 20 new employees. He
said administrators will try to
relocate those hit by the cutbacks
to SSRL if possible.
SLAC administrators, howev
er, will not be able to give con
crete estimates of employee cut
backs until after Dec. 18, when
the option to request a voluntary
layoff expires.
Once SLAC administrators
accept requests, they will begin
involuntary layoffs.
Volunteers gain no special
advantage over others, Lyon
said. They receive no extra com
pensation or perks, and they are
essentially "identical to involun
tary layoffs" and receive the
same amount of severance pay,
he said.
Lyon said those likely to vol
unteer include staff members
who have been planning to leave
for another job or who had
intended to retire.
The only feature of the volun
tary layoff program that resem
bles an added perk is for retirees,
who will receive both regular
retirement benefits plus sever
ance pay. Those who have
worked for more than 25 years
will receive an entire year's
salary.
But this perk pales in compar
ison to voluntary layoff plans
that have been offered at other
scientific research centers. For
instance, the Los Alamos Nation
al Laboratory in New Mexico —
also funded by the Department of
Energy — offered a voluntary
layoff incentive package this
summer with a number of bene
fits.
The Los Alamos lab was inter
ested in shifting the ratio of non
technical to technical employees
and offered non-technical
employees at least $20,000 in
severance pay or an amount

based on years of service,
whichever was higher, said
James Rickman, a spokesman for
that laboratory.
The lab also offered an addi
tional $10,000 in tuition reim
bursement for those planning to
return to an accredited college
or trade school and up to $5,000
for employees eligible to relocate
to other Energy Department
sites.
Rickman said the $8 million
plan which 252 employees opted
into was not entirely driven by
budget cuts. However, he said
that while no direct monetary
crisis prompted the layoffs, lab
administrators recognized the
need to cut back given decreased
funding trends.
Despite the absence of a bene
fits package here at Stanford,
Lyon said "the hope, of course, is
to get a fair number of volunteers
to minimize the number of non
voluntary layoffs."
Contract workers will be con
sidered for cuts before perma
nent employees, and layoff
notices will be issued after the
first of the year. Cutbacks are
slated to take effect around
April 1.
"We will do our best to make
sure impact on regular staff is as
small as possible," said Richter.
Both non-technical and tech
nical positions will face cuts.
However, Richter said it is too
early to tell which will be hardest
hit by the layoffs.
"It is always unpleasant when
you need to reduce staff," said
Lyon. But he offered assurances
that SLAC is still in good shape.
"The bottom line is that we are
healthy and productive. . . . We
are doing well. We just have to do
it at reduced funding levels."
All research projects and
experiments are on schedule,
said Richter, and the new B-fac
tory accelerator project will not
be impacted. But he added that
long-term research and develop
ment programs will likely get
squeezed.
While there are no special pro
grams set up by SLAC to help
laid-off employees find work, the
personnel department plans to
compile a resume book to send to
local employers. Lyon said those
slated to be laid off will also have
full access to University career
counseling.
