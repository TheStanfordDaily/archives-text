You won't see a smiling face on
Stanford's latest award winner; this
honoree is an inanimate mile-long
strip of gravel with new granite
curbs.
Palm Drive, the grand gateway
into the Stanford campus, recently
received one of nine "Design Merit
Awards" from the American Society
of Landscape Architects. The award
honored Stanford for the 1994 Palm
Drive reconstruction project which
mended previously poor road condi
tions and created a modern road
way.
The results of the competition
were published in this month's issue
of Landscape Architecture. Accord
ing to the magazine, "Palm Drive is
one of the most sacred outdoor
spaces in the Western United
States."
The project "struck an optimal
balance between aesthetics, history
and modern functional needs â€” in
theend, providing adequate road ca
pacity while preserving the historic
roadway's character," the magazine
stated.
Finished 20 days ahead of sched
ule and $100,000 under budget, the
$3.5 million Palm Drive restoration
project rebuilt and repaved the road
while adding a drainage system,

sidewalks and granite curbs. The
whole project was completed in Au
gust 1994 and took a total of seven
weeks.
Despite these impressive logis
tics and technical aspects of the pro
ject, Palm Drive won its award pri
marily for its aesthetic merit, ac
cording to Michael Kuntz, project
manager for the renovation
Judy Chan, associate director at
the Planning Office, said the award
"sends a message about how work
should be done."
Richman researched Palm
Drive's history and found the unfin
ished plans of Frederick Law Olm
stead, who originally designed the
Stanford campus as well as New
York City's Central Park. Drainage,
a proper base and granite curbs
were among the unfinished parts of
Olmstead's plans.
"|Wel were walking in the foot
steps of the giants.... Olmstead
had done the basic design in creating
one of the most dramatic spaces in
the Western U. 5.," said Richman.
"A large degree of the challenge was
to be invisible ... to let the original
design vision come through."
He added that Palm Drive "as a
road is more than a way to get from
one place to another. You leave the
world of commerce [and enterl into
the world of ideas."
