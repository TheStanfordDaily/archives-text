It's called "The International Language,"
and there are supposedly several million peo
ple — throughout Europe, Asia and other
parts of the world — who speak it. Even
though hopes of Esperanto replacing other
languages of the world for communication
have faded, a group of Stanford students has
taken up the charge to learn and promote the
language.
"It's not a language particular to one coun
try and it's very easy to learn," said freshman
Sonia Das, who recently began attending Es
peranto classes.
Ed Williger, an independent computer con
sultant, teaches the Esperanto class at Stan
ford, which meets every Tuesday night in the
Bechtel International Center. The goal of the
Esperanto language is not to homogenize the
world, Williger said, but "to keep everyone's
culture — that's why it's called 'the language
of peace.' "
"Stanford students travel a lot. . . and it's
always great to learn about another culture.
But, you've learned about one culture, and
the world is bigger than that. Esperanto
opens up the whole world," Williger said.

Esperanto is having a renaissance at Stanford, in part due to Ed Williger's instruction.
