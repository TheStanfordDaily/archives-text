# Students study 'the language of peace'
## Esparanto aims to eliminate blocks to global interchange

It's called "The International Language,"
and there are supposedly several million peo
ple — throughout Europe, Asia and other
parts of the world — who speak it. Even
though hopes of Esperanto replacing other
languages of the world for communication
have faded, a group of Stanford students has
taken up the charge to learn and promote the
language.
"It's not a language particular to one coun
try and it's very easy to learn," said freshman
Sonia Das, who recently began attending Es
peranto classes.
Ed Williger, an independent computer con
sultant, teaches the Esperanto class at Stan
ford, which meets every Tuesday night in the
Bechtel International Center. The goal of the
Esperanto language is not to homogenize the
world, Williger said, but "to keep everyone's
culture — that's why it's called 'the language
of peace.' "
"Stanford students travel a lot. . . and it's
always great to learn about another culture.
But, you've learned about one culture, and
the world is bigger than that. Esperanto
opens up the whole world," Williger said.

in 1877 as a politically neutral sec
ond language for the world, one
that could be easily learned by all
people. It is currently gaining pop
ularity as a common language for
the Internet, but in the United
States it has remained somewhat
of a "club activity."
Esperanto grammar has 16
basic rules and no exceptions. The
alphabet has 28 letters and all pro
nunciation is phonetic. There are
no irregular verbs, no conjuga
tions. All nouns end in "o". All
adjectives end in "a". All adverbs
end in "e".
Every year there is an Esperan
to Congress somewhere in the
world, where thousands from
around the globe gather to discuss

issues and participate in recre
ational activities — all, of course, in
Esperanto. There are rock and roll
groups who sing in Esperanto,
magazines written in Esperanto
and according to Williger, there has
even been word of the establish
ment of an Esperanto City in
China, where all communication
would be in Esperanto.
Aleksandr Shlyafer, a computer
programmer at the UCSE Medical
Center, teaches second-year
Esperanto students at Stanford,
along with Williger.
Shlyafer taught Esperanto for
more than 10 years in the former
Soviet Union, in the city of Tomsk
in Siberia, before coming to the
United States.
Shlyafer began to use and teach
Esperanto in the former Soviet
Union in the spring of 1979, a peri
od when any active participation in
international activities was viewed

suspiciously by the government.
A key value of the language,
Shlyafer said, is that it allows
direct communication without the
uncertain reliability of transla
tions.
"When you depend on transla
tions, you depend on government
control," Shlyafer said. "In every
country, people who rely on mass
media to receive all their informa
tion do not learn the complete pic
ture of the world."
Freshman Jeff Scarborough,
who has been learning Esperanto
since the beginning of the school
year, said he believes the lack of
widespread interest in Esperanto is
partly due to misperceptions about
the language.
"People think the goal of
Esperanto is to replace everybody's
languages, when its real goal is to
be a second language. That misper
ception gets in the way.. . and they

blow off the whole idea, thinking
it's ridiculous."
Scarborough said he believes
Esperanto enables people of differ
ent cultures to communicate on a
level plane. Trying to make English
the international language, on the
other hand, is merely staying in "a
comfort zone for English-speak
ers."
There are presently about 5,000
languages in the world. Experts
predict that in 50 years only about
300 of these will remain.
"Most of [these languages] are
dying off due to economic pres
sures to learn English, German,
Japanese, Russian, etc. The older
speakers of these languages are
dying off and the younger ones
don't want to learn it because they
need to get a job," Williger said.
"It's not easy to keep your own her
itage when you're submerged in
someone else's culture."
