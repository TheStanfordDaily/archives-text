## ASSU in fit over mix-ups 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Lack of information and mis
communication appear to be the
causes of the ASSU Nominations
Commission dispute that led to
the resignation of its chair Tues-

day.
Scott Wein
traub formally
resigned as
chair of the
commission in a
letter to ASSU
Senate Chair
Alane Murdock
yesterday morn
ing, citing pres
sure from the

Council of Presidents and frustra
tion wit h senate processes as the
reason for his departure.
The controversy involves the
selection of students for the Uni
versity's committee developing a
curriculum for the new Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity
major. In an interview yesterday,
Weintrauh said he had been told
by COP member Rich Stolz "first
that |University| administrators
wanted the fourth [student! seat
to be held for a graduate student,
then later for a Native American
student."
Originally, Weintraub submit
ted a bill to the ASSU Senate at its
Nov. 14 meeting which stated that
(he fourth spot had been held for a
graduate student. Stolz sent
Weintraub an e-mail message
Nov. 14, reading: "Given the op
tion, 1 Vice Provost for Undergrad
uate Education] Ramon Saldivar
would opt for a Native American
student for the committee rather
than a grad student."

Weintraub then rewrote the
bill for Tuesday's meeting to read
"Native American student"
instead of "graduate student,"
because, according to Weintraub,
Stolz told him he should.
Stolz admitted that he had
implied to Weintraub that the
administration preferred an Asian-

American student
and a Native
American student
to sit on the com
mittee. But he
added that "it was
never meant to be
a mandate — the
suggestions were
preferences, and
Scott chose to
take them as
law."

Saldivar said his office in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences didn't set up any guidelines
for the selection process, assum
ing the "formal student organiza
tions would get a broad represen
tation.
"There was no 'should' about
it," Saldivar said. "We talked
about suggesting grad students,
but we wanted the ASSU to select
the students."
Confusion over whether the
administration had mandated
hat a position in the committee
be filled by a Native American
sent the senate into an uproar
Tuesday night. Senators argued
about the legitimacy of passing a
bill which determined by race who
could fill the position.
Earlier in the session, ASSU
Senate Chair Alane Murdock
ruled that any amendments con
taining discriminatory language
proposed by the senators were out
of order. Some senators argued
that the bill already contained
potentially discriminatory lan
guage when it came from the
administration, and thus the sen
ate should not pass it.
The general lack of clarity
arose again when Weintraub
charged that the student group
Concerned Students for Asian-
American Studies (CSAAS) had
pressured nominated students to
step down. Kris Hayashi, a mem
ber of CSAAS, said that another

member of CSAAS, Jane Kim,
was one of the people that Wein
traub originally interviewed for
the CSRE committee. Kim said
that she wasn't asked to submit
any written application to Wein
traub, but she did mention to him
that she was a member of CSAAS.
Hayashi said CSAAS was con
cerned when Weintraub did not
select Kim as a committee mem
ber. "CSAAS has been advocating
for the Asian-American communi
ty for the past five years. It plays

'We talked about sug
gesting grad students,
but we wanted the
ASSU to select the
students.'
— Ramon Saldivar

the same role as [the Stanford
American Indian Organization]
and MEChA," said Hayashi. "We
were concerned that there wasn't
someone on the committee who
could truly represent the Asian-
American community."
Hayashi said CSAAS had tried
to contact Weintraub with their
concern about the selected stu
dents. Upset that he didn't reply,
they contacted the nominees
instead.
Ryo Shoshara, an ASSU sena
tor and one of the students select
ed by Weintraub for the commit
tee, said that he knew CSAAS
wanted him to step down, and he
"agreed that if the senate was
going to look again at the whole
process, including the Native
American issue, [he| should step
down."
He added, however, that "there
was no follow-up after that. I was
trying to work directly with Kris
IHayashil — Scott [Weintraub]
and the COP refused to respond
to our requests to meet."
Senators said they are angry
about the confusion at the meet
ing. Undergraduate senator
Andre Vanier said he plans to
form an ethics committe to look
into Weintraub's allegations on
the undue influence of the COP.

"The ASSU needs strong lead

ers like Weintraub," said Vanier.
"It is a shame when pressure is
placed on them to do unreason
able and possibly unethical
things."
In the midst of controversy and
confusion over the roles of the
ASSU Nominations Commision
and the Council of Presidents,
COP members met yesterday to
discuss a plan of action.
COP members Jon Oram and
Rich Stolz met as part of a regular
weekly meeting of the COP and
Senate Chair Alane Murdock,
coming up with priorities and sug
gestions for the next senate
actions.
The senate's priorities must be
to finish appointing students to
committees that remain unfilled
and to name a new Nom Comm
chair after former chair Scott
Weintraub resigned, Stolz said.
In an e-mail message of the
minutes of yesterday's meeting
sent to the ASSU Senate e-mail
list, Stolz asked, "How 'bout an
agreement that we follow things
by the book from now on from the
very beginning?"
Stolz said his question wasn't
meant to imply that bylaws aren't
followed.
"Part of that is to make sure
everyone is well-versed in the
bylaws," Stolz said. "The need for
saying that was more rhetorical.
It's not as if people haven't been
following them, but we need to
focus on what's important. As
we're considering issues, we need
to make sure as many things are
looked at as possible."
But Oram added that the COP
intends to try to follow the bylaws
more closely to avoid similar prob
lems in the future.
Because of disorganization in
the senate stemming from the
absence of a COP three years ago.
Oram said, "a lot of what we do in
practice now does not fit with the
bylaws for a number of reasons,
mainly because we don't have the
capacity to do it."
For instance, Oram said, the
Nom Comm, which this year con
sisted only of Weintraub, is delin
eated in the bylaws as consisting
of a chair, a deputy chair and five
other members. With a full com
mission the current controversy
could have been avoided, he said.

ate should not pass it.
The general lack of clarity
arose again when Weintraub
charged that the student group
Concerned Students for Asian-
American Studies (CSAAS) had
pressured nominated students to
step down. Kris Hayashi, a mem
ber of CSAAS, said that another

member of CSAAS, Jane Kim,
was one of the people that Wein
traub originally interviewed for
the CSRE committee. Kim said
that she wasn't asked to submit
any written application to Wein
traub, but she did mention to him
that she was a member of CSAAS.
Hayashi said CSAAS was con
cerned when Weintraub did not
select Kim as a committee mem
ber. "CSAAS has been advocating
for the Asian-American communi
ty for the past five years. It plays

'We talked about sug
gesting grad students,
but we wanted the
ASSU to select the
students.'
— Ramon Saldivar

the same role as [the Stanford
American Indian Organization]
and MEChA," said Hayashi. "We
were concerned that there wasn't
someone on the committee who
could truly represent the Asian-
American community."
Hayashi said CSAAS had tried
to contact Weintraub with their
concern about the selected stu
dents. Upset that he didn't reply,
they contacted the nominees
instead.
Ryo Shoshara, an ASSU sena
tor and one of the students select
ed by Weintraub for the commit
tee, said that he knew CSAAS
wanted him to step down, and he
"agreed that if the senate was
going to look again at the whole
process, including the Native
American issue, [he| should step
down."
He added, however, that "there
was no follow-up after that. I was
trying to work directly with Kris
IHayashil — Scott [Weintraub]
and the COP refused to respond
to our requests to meet."
Senators said they are angry
about the confusion at the meet
ing. Undergraduate senator
Andre Vanier said he plans to
form an ethics committe to look
into Weintraub's allegations on
the undue influence of the COP.

"The ASSU needs strong lead

ers like Weintraub," said Vanier.
"It is a shame when pressure is
placed on them to do unreason
able and possibly unethical
things."
In the midst of controversy and
confusion over the roles of the
ASSU Nominations Commision
and the Council of Presidents,
COP members met yesterday to
discuss a plan of action.
COP members Jon Oram and
Rich Stolz met as part of a regular
weekly meeting of the COP and
Senate Chair Alane Murdock,
coming up with priorities and sug
gestions for the next senate
actions.
The senate's priorities must be
to finish appointing students to
committees that remain unfilled
and to name a new Nom Comm
chair after former chair Scott
Weintraub resigned, Stolz said.
In an e-mail message of the
minutes of yesterday's meeting
sent to the ASSU Senate e-mail
list, Stolz asked, "How 'bout an
agreement that we follow things
by the book from now on from the
very beginning?"
Stolz said his question wasn't
meant to imply that bylaws aren't
followed.
"Part of that is to make sure
everyone is well-versed in the
bylaws," Stolz said. "The need for
saying that was more rhetorical.
It's not as if people haven't been
following them, but we need to
focus on what's important. As
we're considering issues, we need
to make sure as many things are
looked at as possible."
But Oram added that the COP
intends to try to follow the bylaws
more closely to avoid similar prob
lems in the future.
Because of disorganization in
the senate stemming from the
absence of a COP three years ago.
Oram said, "a lot of what we do in
practice now does not fit with the
bylaws for a number of reasons,
mainly because we don't have the
capacity to do it."
For instance, Oram said, the
Nom Comm, which this year con
sisted only of Weintraub, is delin
eated in the bylaws as consisting
of a chair, a deputy chair and five
other members. With a full com
mission the current controversy
could have been avoided, he said.

Lack of information and mis
communication appear to be the
causes of the ASSU Nominations
Commission dispute that led to
the resignation of its chair Tues-

day.
Scott Wein
traub formally
resigned as
chair of the
commission in a
letter to ASSU
Senate Chair
Alane Murdock
yesterday morn
ing, citing pres
sure from the

Council of Presidents and frustra
tion wit h senate processes as the
reason for his departure.
The controversy involves the
selection of students for the Uni
versity's committee developing a
curriculum for the new Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity
major. In an interview yesterday,
Weintrauh said he had been told
by COP member Rich Stolz "first
that |University| administrators
wanted the fourth [student! seat
to be held for a graduate student,
then later for a Native American
student."
Originally, Weintraub submit
ted a bill to the ASSU Senate at its
Nov. 14 meeting which stated that
(he fourth spot had been held for a
graduate student. Stolz sent
Weintraub an e-mail message
Nov. 14, reading: "Given the op
tion, 1 Vice Provost for Undergrad
uate Education] Ramon Saldivar
would opt for a Native American
student for the committee rather
than a grad student."

Weintraub then rewrote the
bill for Tuesday's meeting to read
"Native American student"
instead of "graduate student,"
because, according to Weintraub,
Stolz told him he should.
Stolz admitted that he had
implied to Weintraub that the
administration preferred an Asian-

American student
and a Native
American student
to sit on the com
mittee. But he
added that "it was
never meant to be
a mandate — the
suggestions were
preferences, and
Scott chose to
take them as
law."

Saldivar said his office in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences didn't set up any guidelines
for the selection process, assum
ing the "formal student organiza
tions would get a broad represen
tation.
"There was no 'should' about
it," Saldivar said. "We talked
about suggesting grad students,
but we wanted the ASSU to select
the students."
Confusion over whether the
administration had mandated
hat a position in the committee
be filled by a Native American
sent the senate into an uproar
Tuesday night. Senators argued
about the legitimacy of passing a
bill which determined by race who
could fill the position.
Earlier in the session, ASSU
Senate Chair Alane Murdock
ruled that any amendments con
taining discriminatory language
proposed by the senators were out
of order. Some senators argued
that the bill already contained
potentially discriminatory lan
guage when it came from the
administration, and thus the sen
ate should not pass it.
