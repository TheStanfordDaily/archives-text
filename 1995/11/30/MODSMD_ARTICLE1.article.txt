## ASSU in fit over mix-ups 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Lack of information and mis
communication appear to be the
causes of the ASSU Nominations
Commission dispute that led to
the resignation of its chair Tues-

day.
Scott Wein
traub formally
resigned as
chair of the
commission in a
letter to ASSU
Senate Chair
Alane Murdock
yesterday morn
ing, citing pres
sure from the

Council of Presidents and frustra
tion wit h senate processes as the
reason for his departure.
The controversy involves the
selection of students for the Uni
versity's committee developing a
curriculum for the new Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity
major. In an interview yesterday,
Weintrauh said he had been told
by COP member Rich Stolz "first
that |University| administrators
wanted the fourth [student! seat
to be held for a graduate student,
then later for a Native American
student."
Originally, Weintraub submit
ted a bill to the ASSU Senate at its
Nov. 14 meeting which stated that
(he fourth spot had been held for a
graduate student. Stolz sent
Weintraub an e-mail message
Nov. 14, reading: "Given the op
tion, 1 Vice Provost for Undergrad
uate Education] Ramon Saldivar
would opt for a Native American
student for the committee rather
than a grad student."
