Congress passes lobbying-reform bill
WASHINGTON (AP) — Stung by polls indicating the public
believes lobbyists have runaway influence in Washington, Congress
passed a measure yesterday that would require lobbyists to disclose
their clients, their issues and their spending.
President Clinton, who has said he would sign the bill containing
the first overhaul of lobbying law in half a century, lauded its pas
sage, saying it will "help restore the trust of the people in their gov
ernment."
"This bill will help change the way Washington does business,"
Clinton said in a statement. "For too long, Washington's influence
industry has operated out of the sunlight of public scrutiny. This new
law will require professional lobbyists, for the first time, to fully dis
close who they are working for and what legislation they are trying
to pass or kill."
Clinton urged Congress to pass campaign finance reform legisla
tion as well.
Yesterday's 421-0 1 louse vote — following a 98-0 vote by the Sen
ate in July — belied the difficulty of bringing the bill through the leg
islative thicket. At least 10 times since the first, loophole-riddled lob
bying regulations were passed in 1946, efforts to update the law had
ended in failure.
While reformers called the bill progress, they acknowledged it was
not perfect. A particularly large omission was an exemption from dis
closure for so-called "grassroots" lobbying, the fastest-growing area
of the persuasion business — including activities such as advertising,
toll-free phone lines and computerized direct mail aimed at generat
ing phone calls and letters from the public to Washington.
Pat Schroeder to retire
WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Rep. Pat Schroeder, the
longest-serving woman in Congress and a fiery opponent of House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, said yesterday she will not seek re-election.
"I suddenly woke up and said, 'My whole adult life, I've been
here,' " said Schroeder, 55, who is in her 12th House term. She said
she had no intention of running for the Senate seat being vacated by
Sen. Hank Brown, R-Colo.
"If I had wanted to run for the Senate I think I would have done
it a long time ago," Schroeder said in an interview in her office.
Instead, she said, she will seek teaching, writing or other opportuni
ties dealing with people.
Schroeder is the 14th House Democrat to announce retirement
plans this year. Several in the group are running for the Senate. In
contrast, just four House Republicans have announced plans to
retire.
Schroeder said she was confident a Democrat would be elected to
fill her seat from Denver. She said she had considered retiring in
1994, but was glad she didn't "because no one could have foreseen
this tremendous upheaval" of Democrats in the minority for the first
time in 40 years.
"I wanted to make sure I thought we were at a time when it would
not hurt the Democratic Party," said Schroeder, saying she is confi
dent Democrats will hold her seat and have a good shot at winning
back the House, which has 234 Republicans, 198 Democrats, one
independent and two vacancies.
"People have finally awakened and understand that Newt Gin
grich is really the Republican Party," said Schroeder. "That every
body is either a femiNewtie or a Newtoid, and if they vote Republican
they are getting Newt."
Schroeder's disdain for Gingrich is reflected almost daily in her
House speeches. After the speaker's recent complaint that President
Clinton had snubbed him on Air Force One, Schroeder appeared on
the House floor with a small statue she said was Gingrich's "Acade
my Award for best child actor."
Late-night warrior defects
NEW YORK (AP) — Jay Leno's former head writer is changing
sides in the late-night television wars, Daily Variety reported
Wednesday.
Joseph Toplyn, who was head writer for the "Tonight Show With
Jay Leno" until recently, will be named to that job with "The Late
Show With David Letterman," today, Daily Variety reported. He will
begin work next month, the industry trade paper said.
It will be a return home of sorts for Toplyn, who wrote for Letter
man's old "Late Night" show at NBC from 1983 to 1990. He has
written for"In Living Color" and"The Larry Sanders Show" as well.
The hire would be part of an effort to restore the ratings luster to
CBS' "Late Show," which had consistently bested NBC's "Tonight"
until slipping to second place in recent months.
Rob Burnett, who quit as the "Late Show" head writer last sum
mer to create the Letterman-produced "Bonnie Hunt Show," will
return as a "Late Show" producer, Daily Variety said.
