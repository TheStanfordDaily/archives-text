KALESIJA, Bosnia-I lerzegov
ina (AP) — U.S. military experts
arrived in northern Bosnia yester
day to scout the battered country
side where thousands of Gls are to
keep the peace.
"We've got a lot to do and very
little time to do it," said Col. John
Brown, splashing through the mud
in a U.N. pickup truck.
Within weeks, 20,000 U.S. sol
diers are to begin arriving to patrol
northeastern Bosnia. French,
British and other troops will patrol
the rest of the country.
In the meantime, Brown's
teams will be bouncing over hun
dreds of miles, checking landing
strips, pot hole-riddled rotids, scores
of villages and manv minefields.

The Gls will face "the same dan
gers that have been here for sever
al years and will continue. That's
why we're down here," said Brown,
chief of staff for the Ist Armored
Division.
Brown and nine other officers
from the division flew from Ger
many to the Croatian city of Split.
They arrived in the nothern city of
Tuzla in four white armored per
sonnel carriers driven by Norwe
gian U.N. peacekeepers.
Shortly afterward, the team
made its first foray into the smog
shrouded hills around the U.N. air
base at Tuzla.
"We're just taking a look
around," Brown, in a helmet and
camouflage fatigues, said curtly

during a stop in burned-out Kalesi
ja. The town, about 10 miles east of
Tuzla, was on the frontlines
through much of the war and has
been empty since May 1992.
The pickup crunched over shell
holes and rubble, a ragged blue
U.N. flag fluttering from its anten
na. On the rear window was a
small sticker of a U.S. flag.
Reporters who followed the
truck saw it turn down one road
and stop within sight of former
rebel Serb positions, now in gov
ernment hands. The truck stopped
cautiously and turned around to
avoid possible mines.
Inside the cab, officers directed
the driver using a topographical
map and a hand-held Global Posi

tioning System device, which pin
points locations using satellites.
Just east of the Tuzla airbase,
the team hesitated, then plunged
into an enormous field once used for
small civilian aircraft. Now it's a sea
of soggy grass and ankle-deep mud.
Spewing pale muck behind, the
truck plowed through as the offi
cers took in the landscape that con
ceivably could become the Army's
staging ground, home to makeshift
barracks or a baseball field — or
nothing at all.
Minutes later, outside an aban
doned warehouse, Brown only
smiled when peppered with ques
tions about the use for the field.
Finally he answered obliquely:
"There are all kinds of options."
