# Records show Gingrich PAC broke the law
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Bolstering its case that a
political organization founded by Newt Gingrich violat
ed federal law, the government released court records
yesterday suggesting the group spent heavily on "Newt
support" during his tough 1990 re-election battle.
The group, GOP AC, has steadfastly maintained that
it did not help any federal candidates before 1991.
But the Federal Election Commission asserted that
its new evidence proves the organization was illegally
assisting federal candidates before then, particularly the
future I louse speaker.
The FEC's filing in U.S. District Court included inter
nal memos, meeting minutes, tape recordings and notes
showing GOPAC paid for consultants "to help Newt
think" and to "inoculate Newt Gingrich from Democrat
ic attacks" by producing a pro-Gingrich videotape.
A recording from a 1990 GOPAC meeting quotes one
of the group's officials as estimating its financial support
for Gingrich amounted to more than $250,000 a year.
Peter Derry, GOPAC's lawyer, dismissed the new evi
dence, saying the group still believes it did not provide
Gingrich or any other federal candidate direct, election
related support.
"Our view is that GOPAC didn't support any federal
candidates," Derry said. "We're willing to litigate that
issue."
"My understanding is those expenses were for legal
travel and strategy and planning expenses," said Gin
grich spokeswoman Lauren Sims. "This was not for
campaign support."
GOPAC was founded by Gingrich in the 1980s to
fund Republican party-building activities, which culmi
nated in last fall's GOP takeover of Congress. Gingrich
stepped aside as the group's general chairman this year
after becoming House speaker.
The FEC has sued GOPAC, alleging the group oper
ated as a federal political action committee long before it
registered as one in 1991, and thus evaded federal laws
that limit spending and donations and require disclo
sure.
GOPAC argues its sole purpose before 1991 was the
election of state and local candidates.
But the FEC alleges that often GOPAC's support for
state candidates was actually designed to assist federal
candidates.
1990, GOPAC targeted Georgia for seven candidate
in-tn.ining seminars, the most of any state, in part "to
protect Congressman Newt Gingrich," according to one
GOPAC report cited by the FEC.
That year, Gingrich was locked in a tight re-election
struggle with Democrat David Worley. Gingrich eventu
allv won bv just 974 votes out of 156,000 cast.
