Continuing troubles at the
ASSU are sign that senate
must create judicial branch

CURRENTLY, information is
coming forth regarding the
circumstances surrounding
the recent resignation of Nomina
tions Commission Chair Scott
Weintraub. The dust has yet to set
tle and it is unclear who in the
ASSU is guilty of any wrongdoings.
Unfortunately, this is not the
first time such controversy involv
ing the ASSU Senate and Council
of Presidents has surfaced. It seems
that similar scandals rock the
ASSU leadership year after year.
While the accusations of the
departing Nom Comm chair are
serious, what is most disturbing
about this situation is the fact that
there exists no impartial judicial
organization within the ASSU to
investigate such accusations.
The senate must create one.
Legally, in cases involving the
interpretation of the ASSU Consti
tution and Bylaws, the senate chair
and / or parliamentarian may uni
laterally decide the issue. However,
there exists no mechanism for the
appeal of such rulings. Further
more, the only way for the senate to
discipline its own membership is
through majority decision — a
clear conflict of interest.
Past senate action (or lack of
action) demonstrates that a system
subject to the whims of the majori
ty, ripe with incentives for political
maneuvering, creates an unhealthy
atmosphere for fair, impartial judi
cial review. The senate needs a sys
tem of proper checks and balances.
In creating this new branch of
government, the senate must dili
gently provide for the proper sepa
ration of power — common sense
dictates that the judicial branch
should not be controlled by the
senate. For similar reasons, the
senate must not be responsible for

selecting the membership of this
brunch. In designing the system,
however, the senate can provide a
framework for how the decision
process will work and what disci
plinary power the judiciary body
will wield.
In creating a judicial body, the
senate should follow the model of a
jury system. In such a system, a
complaint or grievance filed by or
against the senate or COP would
trigger the process of jury selection
and a temporary council would
study, deliberate and rule on the
matter. Rotating student member
ship on an impermanent body will
help limit the accumulation of
political power and abuse by the
judicial branch.
When designing the selection
process, the senate should mirror
the existing method used by the
Stanford Judicial Council — a
University committee charged
with the enforcement of Universi
ty rules and regulations — to
select members. The judicial coun
cil contacts students in order on a
random list created by the Univer
sity. Contacted students are given
the option to declare a willingness
to serve on the council. Once
enough participants declare, the
list is forwarded to the senate so
that it may select three student
members to sit on the council. Of
course, in the ASSU's system, the
senate should not be allowed to
make any selections of jury mem
bers.
Unfortunately, in past sessions,
the senate has proved unable or
unwilling to create a mechanism
for proper judicial review. Last year,
even though a senate-sponsored
consulting report called for the cre
ation of such a branch and separate
bills were submitted by various
senators on two occasions, nothing
happened. While verbally support
ed by many in the senate, the
majority of the senate successfully
buried the issue.
It is not enough for the senate to
agree that a judicial branch is need
ed — it must create it. This is sim
ply the responsible thing to do.
