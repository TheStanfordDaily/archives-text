Student responds to sexual harassment articles

I FOUND THE logic contained within
the Nov. 28 editorial piece written by
the Women's Collective regarding
sexual harassment to be most curious.
One of the collective's primary com
plaints with the new policy is that the
new definition of sexual harassment —
"conduct intended to harass or conduct
whose unintended but reasonably fore
seeable effect is to cause harassment" —
is problematic because this new defini
tion no longer accepts the opinion of the
harassed individual as the primary
determinant of whether sexual harass
ment has occurred.
Do they mean that they wish the
opinion of the victim to be the primary
determinant of whether or not sexual
harassment has occurred, regardless of
the intentions of the accused and regard
less of how unreasonable claims of said
harassment might be? If so, if all we
need to find someone guilty of sexual

harassment is a victim's opinion that he
or she has been the victim of "unwel
come conduct", then why waste time
with a judge, jury, hearing or trial at all?
Simply let anyone who perceives her
self or himself as a sexual harassment
victim report it to the proper authori
ties and then apprise the accused of his
or her punishment. No need for a trial
or any other such trivialities, for the
very fact that the victim filed a report
with the authorities indicates his or her
opinion that he or she has been
harassed, and, by golly, that's all we
need!
The accused can never disprove the
holy opinion of the victim and the vic
tim's opinion is the primary determi
nant, outweighing the intentions of the
accused or the reasonableness of the vic
tim's harassment claim. Case closed! All
victims have gained the added power of
determining the guilt of the accused.

Impartiality be damned!
When I was a camp counselor a cou
ple of summers ago, a young boy in my
class asked me why little girls didn't
have penises, but little boys did. I fum
bled a bit and then launched into a theo
retical explanation of human biology,
which bored him and drove him away.
Yet, in retrospect, I now realize that I
should have immediately reported this
cretin to the authorities and taught him
a lesson he wouldn't soon forget, for I
felt quite harassed by his question, and
that's all we need to demand swift
reprisal!
Clearly, the victim's opinion of
whether or not he or she was
harassed should not be the primary
determinant. We must also consider,
with equal if not more weight, the inten
tions of the accused as well as whether
or not the victim's claim of feeling
harassed is reasonable, to prevent outra

geous cases like my example and to pre
serve the rights of the accused.
I can hear my critics now: Who will
determine whether or not the claim of
sexual harassment is reasonable?
Answer: an impartial third party, just as
it is in the rest of the legal world. This
nonsense about a third party having a
wavering standard of judgment is
balderdash, because if we judge each
case on the victim's unique opinion,
then there will be NO standard of judg
ment, which is not fair to the accused.
No one will have any idea what is legal
and what is not.
This new "reasonably foreseeable"
clause, as ambiguous as it may be, is cer
tainly a preferable standard to the
unjust individual opinion of the victim
"standard." The new policy is not per
fect, but it is far better than the old policy.
