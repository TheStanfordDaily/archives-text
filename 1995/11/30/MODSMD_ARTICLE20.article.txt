# Prof. Cohn's letter was ignorant, misunderstands point of multiculturalism
## 
### 
Simply stated, every one of French
and Italian Prof. Emeritus Robert
Cohn's arguments in his recent letter
to The Daily is not intellectually
porous. However, his farcical critique
of multiculturalism is scarcely defensi
ble, except under the grand under
standing of a cultural hubris, which is
ethnocentric, which is intrinsically a
scam.
Cohn reductively constructs multi
culturalism as the bemoaning of his
torical losers. In Cohn's idealization,
this bemoaning wails and rails against
Western excellence.
Rut Cohn's talk of "marginal
group" and historical "loser groups"
reeks of a perniciously segmentary his

tonography which presupposes the
virtue of strength. However, the per
son who argues that might makes
right loses humanistic credence. Rut I
realize that there are antecedents for
this though, in Nietzsche's work and
in early- to mid-century German dia
logue for example. Do not glamorize
the status of "non-marginal" or "win
ner groups" — these statements are
fundamentally synopses of power
dynamics.
In writing this letter, I do not
accede to the academic assumption
which supports Cohn's statements.
This assumption is that paradigmatic
character of the Western traditions. I
study African history — but when I do
so, I do not seek parallels to Western
social or artistic development in order
to validate my study — that methodol
ogy is old rubbish which should be
happily buried.
Those who love the Western intel
lectual paradigm have no power to

demote or caricature the tradition of
societies with different social sensibili
ties, forms and expressions as the piti
ful tears of "loser groups." Under
stand that political hegemony does not
confer this philosophical right of
scholarly evaluation. Recognize cul
tural variance — realize your impor
tance to speak authoritatively upon
the fundamental value of the intellec
tual and artistic productions of every
culture.
It is time that the arrogance be
removed from the Western paradigm.
