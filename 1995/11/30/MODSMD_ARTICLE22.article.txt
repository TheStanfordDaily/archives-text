## Portrait of Thanksgiving 
### 
THE FIRST THREE topics of our
Thanksgiving conversation were:
Tibetan monks, dodging the Viet
nam draft and drag queens — not your
typical Thanksgiving Day chit-chat,
that's for sure. But this was no typical
Thanksgiving.
We basked in a day of thanks with our
friend Paul at his friend's "Evening
Sun's" house, in the mountains rising
mystically near Santa Cruz. But then,
something struck me as different. It
wasn't the organic spinach dip, it wasn't
the chit-chat extolling the virtues of
hemp — hell, it wasn't even the fact that
half of the male guests were dressed in
drag. We felt some unbridled tension,
perhaps, or some misplaced yearning for
a Thanksgiving from (he past — the days
of being planted in front of the tube,
watching the Browns, as Ma stuffed a
bird carcass full of Stove Top lovin'.
That wasn't it. It seems that the nega
tive energy developing was from Evening
Sun and her partner, Doug. Evening Sun,
recently recovering from a heroin addic
tion, had just taken a female lover.
Understandably, Doug was a bit uncom
fortable with the situation and he felt
slightly neglected. Even so, we were com
forted by their friends who believed their
partnership was strong (plus, Evening
Sun had just recently landed a job as an
acupuncturist, so things were just hon
kev-dorev).

Mingling with the 20 or so guests, we
happened upon Barbara. She's been a lit
tle wigged out about people for a long
time. She decided to share her happy
home with 12 cats and five horses who, as
she claims, provide her with more than
enough companionship. A wonderful, but
quiet, woman, that Barbara.
It was about four in the afternoon
when someone rolled the drums out. We
circled up outside and beat them for
about 45 minutes as the sun slowly
slipped into another dimension.
As the primal rhythms died away, the
time came to construct the Altar of Crys
tals. Circling up inside Evening Sun's
home, we all took a moment to reflect
upon the meaning of the word "thanks."
We then passed around the Talking
Stick. No, this wasn't a stick that talked,
you pernicious fools, but rather a stick
that enabled one to verbalize one's inner
most feelings and thoughts. Keeping in
mind that language is a degradation of
thought, some expressed themselves in
song and dance. Then, each person placed
a personal crystal upon the altar.
Enter the threesome. Molly, handling
the Talking Stick, disclosed to us, "I've
been on a bad row." It seems, as we later
found out, that Molly was slowly becom
ing estranged from her ladies' threesome.
Her partners in the circle did little to
invalidate her claim — there were no
pleas for her return to the threesome.

Upon reflection, we feel that Molly was
justified in her bitterness.
Then, after we became one in the circle
of crystal and unconditional acceptance,
Evening Sun announced that it was time
for nourishment. With that, a fantastic
vegetarian feast ensued.
We realize that these past 400 words
may well have seemed disconnected and
rather silly at times, but understand that
we wanted you to experience what a
Thanksgiving with us would be like. So,
we're sorry about everything (not just
our silly columns, but everything). The
fall of man, the Russo-Japanese War
(sorry, our bad), Rand's belly-button lint
(all of it). So we understand if you want
to pull out now before it gets dangerous.
So what have we learned from
Thanksgiving? Living without running
water sucks. Threesomes, though enjoy
able as evening stints, remain difficult to
maintain as long-term relationships.
Chocolate mousse made from tofu ain't
so bad. And, though we hate to admit it,
Brendan McCullough isn't so bad — he
answers the phone with "bon soir."
C'mon, that's neato!
