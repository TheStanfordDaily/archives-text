... Rural poverty in China, household risk-coping in the Philippines, exchange rate management in Mexico, grain markets in
Ethiopia, fertilizer adoption in rural India. These are all current thesis topics at the Food Research Institute. Real problems faced
by real people. Problems that for many mean the difference between life and death, wealth and poverty. To these and other
problems, Food Research Institute faculty, students, and graduates arc bringing the combination of rigorous economics and
empirical experience that has been the Institute's hallmark for the last 74 years. If helping people address these problems does not
rank high on Stanford's to-do list, what does?
All of us came to Stanford because, quite simply, the Food Research Institute is the best place in the world to learn to understand
and address these problems. The Food Research Institute's combination of rigorous economics and field experience, its
commitment to collecting and analyzing real-world (often primary) data, and its policy orientation make it unique. The excellence
of its program is widely recognized. In each of the last 3 years, Institute students have received awards from the American
I Agricultural Economics Association for the quality of their dissertations. The work of faculty and graduates has also often been
singled out. Many of us turned down offers from other top-ranked universities to come to the Food Research Institute. Today, we
are continuing to work on development problems at international organizations, government agencies, research centers, and
universities throughout the world.
For Stanford, closing the Food Research Institute might mean a tidier, neater organizational chart but it will also weaken the
University's prospects for maintaining its international reputation in the field of economic development. For the people who do the
difficult work of development on a day to day basis it would mean the loss of a great resource.
