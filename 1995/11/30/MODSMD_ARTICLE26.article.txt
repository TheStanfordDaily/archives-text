Bernard M. "Barney" Oliver, a Stanford graduate
and lecturer who designed the first hand-held calcu
lator, died on Thanksgiving Day of a heart attack at
age 79.
Oliver designed the calculator while a vice presi
dent of research at Hewlett-Packard, the company
founded by William Hewlett and David Packard, who
graduated from Stanford the same year as Oliver.
Friend and colleague Ron Brace well, professor
emeritus of electrical engineering, called Oliver "one
of the great men of this world. We're all indebted to
him for the things that he's provided us with," he
said.
After graduating from Stanford with a degree in
electrical engineering, Oliver joined Bell Telephone
Laboratories in New York, turning down an offer to
join Hewlett and Packard in founding their company,
Bracewell said. 1 Ie also spent some time as a lecturer
and member of the School of Engineering advisory
council at Stanford.
Before and after his time at Hewlett-Packard,
Bracewell said, Oliver did "a lot of other remarkable
things."
He won the National Medal of Science and was
elected to the National Academy of Engineering and
the National Academy of Science, as well as serving as
president of the Institute of Electrical Engineering.
Furthermore, Bracewell added, "remarkable
things happened to him."

"He was invited to Oxford to give the Halley Lec
ture at the time of Halley's Comet," Bracewell said.
"You wouldn't expect a university in England where
Halley lived to go to California to get a lecturer.'
Bracewell said his first meeting with Oliver was
one of his favorite memories.
"I came to Stanford in 1955," he said. "In my first
lecture course ... this giant of a man who was sub
stantially older than I was was sitting in the front row
looking very imposing. I had no idea who he was,
except he wasn't a student.
"Then I finished my lecture and he chatted with
me," he continued. It turned out Oliver was consider
ing writing a book on a type of transformer Bracewell
was studying and had come to the lecture to decide if
he should follow through, according to Bracewell.
Oliver asked Bracewell if he was considering writ
ing the same book, which Bracewell later did. "It's
still in print," Bracewell said. "And we've been pretty
good friends ever since then."
Oliver was also interested in extraterrestrial life
and studied it at the NASA Ames Research Center
and the SETI Institute.
"He was one of the few people who believed we
would make contact with extraterrestrial beings in
his own lifetime," Bracewell said. "That didn't prove
to be fulfilled, but he worked very hard on it."
Oliver is survived by three children.
A memorial service will be held at the United
Methodist Church in Palo Alto at 2 p.m. tomorrow.
