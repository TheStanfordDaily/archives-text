## Willingham credits staff, team for personal success Conference selects Stanford coach after drastic turnaround 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
The head coaches of the Pacific
10 Conference may have selected
Tyrone Willingham as the
league's Coach of the Year, but
the award hasn't changed Stan
ford football's top dog one bit.
The down-to-earth Willingham
was quick to spread the wealth
amongst his co-workers and play
ers.
"I don't look at it as an individ
ual honor," he said. "I'm glad that
it happened because it says that
the Stanford Cardinal coaching
staff and the Stanford Cardinal
football team have shown that
they are the coaching staff of the
year and the team of the year. The
honor is for the group and the
team and not just for me."
Willingham was chosen over
such coaches as Oregon's Mike
Bellotti, who led the Ducks to a 9-
2 record and a Cotton Bowl berth,
and Arizona State's Bruce Sny
der, whose team came back from a
rough start and a tough schedule
to post a 6-5 mark.
"Even though [Bellotti's] team
was predicted to finish high, I

don't think he put a lot of faith in
predictions and did a good job of
coaching his football team," Will
ingham said. "And coach Snyder
did a good job as well. If you look
at his team's start and some of

1 don't look at it
as an indivdual
honor. The honor is
for the group and
the team and not
just for me.'

the teams it played early in the
year, to get his team to rebound
and play as well as it did down the
stretch was an excellent job."
Stanford's 7-3-1 record and
Liberty Bowl berth may have
shocked some people, but Willing
ham takes everything in stride.
Although he appreciated each and
every victory, he felt that his team
was capable of winning right from

the start. Indeed, the team's
greatest achievement may not be
its record or its bowl appearance.
Rather, it may be the fact that
Stanford remained competitive
no matter what the circumstance
and gave itself a shot at victory in
every game, including in its three
losses.
"That's something I really take
pride in,"he said. "The team
played well and really dug down
deep inside. Every time the team
walked out on the field, they have
given their very best effort."
Even though he had never
even held a coordinator position
prior to taking the reins of the
Cardinal program, Willingham
has made the transition to the
head coaching job look easy, bal
ancing the myriad responsibilities
of the position like a seasoned vet
eran.
"You have more to do than the
Xs and the Os," Willingham said
of the job he loves. "There's a lot
more to the job than diagram
ming plays — sitting with
reporters, making sure the travel
schedule is set, making sure the

coach at Stanford.
practice schedule is set just right
to keep the team sharp, dealing
with alumni relations."
The truth is that Willingham,
nearing only 42 years of age, is
already a veteran of the coaching
ranks. He is quick to remind for
getful reporters that he's been in
this business for 17 years and
knows his way around better
than they give him credit for.
Take recruiting, for example
— a facet of the job which will
determine both Stanford's and
Willingham's future. Some may
say that he has not yet fulfilled
the task of attracting quality
athletes to the program, but he
"had a hand" in last year's class
(which boasts an impressive
group of offensive linemen and
tight end Tony Vella, a high
school All-America) and has
been involved with the process in
previous years. He's no babe in
the woods and Stanford's play in
1995 can only add to his ability
to persuade young men to come
to the Farm.
"The recruiting process is going
well," he said. "With the very pos
itive things that have happened to
us, it has a chance to go even bet
ter. I think that young people are
attracted to a team that has had
the kind of success we've had. It
shows them that the program is
headed in the right direction."
And having the Pac-10 Coach
of the Year can't hurt either.
"Any time that you have a
coach who gets this kind of per
sonal attention, it helps," Will
ingham said. "It says very posi
tive things and I think kids pick
up on that.
"But, again, one guy receives
the credit, but it's not just one
guy. This honor speaks well of our
other coaches and our players."

the teams it played early in the
year, to get his team to rebound
and play as well as it did down the
stretch was an excellent job."
Stanford's 7-3-1 record and
Liberty Bowl berth may have
shocked some people, but Willing
ham takes everything in stride.
Although he appreciated each and
every victory, he felt that his team
was capable of winning right from

the start. Indeed, the team's
greatest achievement may not be
its record or its bowl appearance.
Rather, it may be the fact that
Stanford remained competitive
no matter what the circumstance
and gave itself a shot at victory in
every game, including in its three
losses.
"That's something I really take
pride in,"he said. "The team
played well and really dug down
deep inside. Every time the team
walked out on the field, they have
given their very best effort."
Even though he had never
even held a coordinator position
prior to taking the reins of the
Cardinal program, Willingham
has made the transition to the
head coaching job look easy, bal
ancing the myriad responsibilities
of the position like a seasoned vet
eran.
"You have more to do than the
Xs and the Os," Willingham said
of the job he loves. "There's a lot
more to the job than diagram
ming plays — sitting with
reporters, making sure the travel
schedule is set, making sure the

practice schedule is set just right
to keep the team sharp, dealing
with alumni relations."
The truth is that Willingham,
nearing only 42 years of age, is
already a veteran of the coaching
ranks. He is quick to remind for
getful reporters that he's been in
this business for 17 years and
knows his way around better
than they give him credit for.
Take recruiting, for example
— a facet of the job which will
determine both Stanford's and
Willingham's future. Some may
say that he has not yet fulfilled
the task of attracting quality
athletes to the program, but he
"had a hand" in last year's class
(which boasts an impressive
group of offensive linemen and
tight end Tony Vella, a high
school All-America) and has
been involved with the process in
previous years. He's no babe in
the woods and Stanford's play in
1995 can only add to his ability
to persuade young men to come
to the Farm.
"The recruiting process is going
well," he said. "With the very pos
itive things that have happened to
us, it has a chance to go even bet
ter. I think that young people are
attracted to a team that has had
the kind of success we've had. It
shows them that the program is
headed in the right direction."
And having the Pac-10 Coach
of the Year can't hurt either.
"Any time that you have a
coach who gets this kind of per
sonal attention, it helps," Will
ingham said. "It says very posi
tive things and I think kids pick
up on that.
"But, again, one guy receives
the credit, but it's not just one
guy. This honor speaks well of our
other coaches and our players."
