# Fadil finds home across country

### Edward Guzman Contributing writer 
As the only graduating senior
on the Stanford men's cross
country team, Mark Fadil has
seen it all. lie has transferred
from one program to another,
overcome major injury and wit
nessed the Cardinal cross coun
try team flourish under head
coach Vin Lananna. Further
more, he has provided strength
and experience, helping this
year's Cardinal attain only its
second top-five national finish
ever in last week's NCAA Cham
pionships in Ames, lowa.
This career-capping achieve
ment did not come overnight for
the young man from Liverpool,
NY. Fadil came from a running
background, as both his brothers
ran competitively. After a suc
cessful high school career at Liv
erpool High, he followed older
brother Mike to Dartmouth in
the fall of 1991.
It was at Dartmouth that
Fadil came under the tutelage of
Lananna, who was still coaching
the Big Green at the time.
Lananna quickly put any com
parisons between Fadil and his
older brother to rest. "Vin was
very supportive," Fadil said. "He
never tried to compare us. [For
example), he had me run the
steeplechase because he thought
it was a good event for me, not
because my brother ran the
event."
Fadil added that there was no
pressure to live up to his broth
er's name. "There was definitely
a rivalry, but I Mike] was always
supportive," he said. "It's a little
competitive, but it's nothing

vicious."
After Fadil's freshman sea
son, Lananna left Dartmouth for
his current coaching position on
the Farm. Lananna's departure
instigated Fadil's thoughts
about transferring. "I wasn't
unhappy at Dartmouth, but
things were very different after
Vin left." he said. Although he
acknowledges that Lananna's
presence at the Farm was his
main motivation for coming to
Stanford, he also factored in the
fact that he hadn't yet declared a
major at Dartmouth and that
there would be "more of an
opportunity" at Stanford. So,
after completing fall quarter and
finishing his second year of run
ning at Dartmouth, in which he
developed a nagging hip prob
lem, Fadil headed out West.
At the time, according to
Fadil, the hip problem did not
seem to present a major difficul
ty. "The problem was, I never
took care of it properly," he said.
"I was overcompensating in my
running form." The injury
caught up with him in preseason
workouts in the fall of 1993. As
it turns out, he had severely
strained his Ilio Tibial band, the
stabilizing band that runs along
the outside of the leg from the
hip down to the knee. Fadil sub
sequently redshirted and missed
both the cross country and track
seasons.
Ironically, however, the
in jury that put Fadil out of com
mission for nearly two seasons
took only 10 days to correct.
