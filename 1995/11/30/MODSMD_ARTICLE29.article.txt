# Lone Star challenge for women's swimming
## 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
The top-ranked Stanford women's swimming team heads
into Austin, Texas today to take on the best in collegiate swim
ming. In a p< >ssihle preview of this year's NCAA Championships,
the Cardinal will battle the likes of second-ranked Michigan,
third-ranked Southern Methodist and fourth-ranked Texas in
the three-day Texas Invite, which will take place at the Univer
sity of Texas' Ijee and Joe Jamail Texas Swimming Center.
The defending national champion Cardinal began the sea

son ranked second behind Michigan. The Wolverines took
Stanford down to the wire in last year's NCAA champi
onships, with the Cardinal escaping by a slim margin of 19
points.
However, this past October, Stanford traveled to Ann
Arbor to oust the Wolverines in their home pool. The victory
came as Stanford's 52nd straight dual meet victory, and it
thrust the Cardinal women into the No. 1 position ahead of
the Wolverines. Nonetheless, despite its showing in October,

the Cardinal must remain wary of
a formidable Michigan squad.
Perceived as Stanford's main
competition this year, the Wolver
ines return nearly all of last sea
son's squad. Stanford, meanwhile,
lost phenoms Jenny Thompson
and Eileen Richetelli.
The Cardinal will rely on both its
veterans and its impressive fresh
men this weekend. Co-captain Lisa
Jamb swam outstandingly in the
October meet against Michigan,
winning the 100-, 200- and 400-
yard freestyle while setting pool
records in the 100 and 200. All-
American Claudia Franco, who won
the 50-yard freestyle and finished
second in the 100-yard freestyle in
October, will also represent the
Cardinal in freestyle competition.
The Stanford roster includes 14
freshmen, including Elin Austevoll,
who will swim in the 1996 Olympics
for Norway.
All in all, every Cardinal swim
mer must perform well to hold off
the nation's best teams and safe
guard Stanford's No. 1 ranking.
