## Senate to discuss proposed minors 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
For the first time since the pro
gram was announced last Febru
ary, the Faculty Senate will debate
undergraduate minors at its meet
ing today.
Also on the agenda is discussion
of proposed revisions to the Univer
sity's sexual harassment policy.
The senate will consider a report
on minors written by two faculty
committees which both call for the
implementation of minor concen
trations in all three of Stanford's
undergraduate schools. The senate
is not scheduled to take action on
the proposal at today's session.
The report — co-authored by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies and the Committee on Aca
demic Appraisal and Achievement
— recommends that students take
at least six courses but no more
than 36 units in a particular de
partment or interdisciplinary pro
gram to receive the minor.
"For students interested in two
subjects, this is a good mix," said
John Shoven, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences. "Minors
can lead you into graduate school.
They can lead you into a job."
Shoven said he expects 75 per
cent of students to choose at least
one minor once the program is im
plemented. The number of double
majors is expected to decrease, he
said.
A physics major and economics

minor at UC-San Diego, Shoven
turned his minor into a career as an
economics professor. As dean, he
has championed the creation of the
minor since the Commission on

Undergraduate
Education re
leased its lengthy
report last year
suggesting that
the University
offer a secondary
concentration for
undergraduates.
Shoven and As
sistant Dean for
Undergraduate

Studies Ellen Woods are already re
ceiving proposals for minor pro
grams from individual depart
ments in Humanities and Sciences.
Each Humanities and Sciences de
partment or interdisciplinary pro
gram which offers majors will also
offer minors, Shoven said. The
deadline for submitting proposals is
Dec. 15.
Shoven said he expects the sen
ate to ratify the proposal. "This is a
can't-lose deal. It's a little hard to
oppose," he said.
The School of Engineering will
meet Dec. 8 to determine which of
its departments will offer minors.
Administrators said they are await
ing the results of today's senate de
bate before pressing forward.
But John Bravman, a senior as
sociate dean for student affairs at


Shoven
the school, said, "I anticipate that
many, and perhaps all, of the
School of Engineering's depart
ments will offer minors."
In addition, the school is con
sidering creating a broad engi
neering minor, covering aspects

of the entire school, Bravman
said.
Each of t he three departments
in the School of Earth Sciences
will offer minors pending senate
approval, Dean Franklin Orr said.
Orr said the minor idea has
drawn support throughout the
school.
"It's a way that students can
demonstrate the broad interests
they have and equip themselves

with a set of additional skills that
will serve them well in whatever
career path they take after they
leave Stanford," Orr said.
The programs will be struc
tured to prevent minors consist
ing of only introductory level
courses, Woods said. Courses that
overlap between a student's
major and minor will be counted
for both only if they fulfill intro
ductory skill requirements —

such as math or foreign language
requirements — or are required
by all the departments in a given
school, such as some courses in
the School of Engineering.
In their report, the committees
suggest that the recording of the
minor not appear on students'
diplomas due to lack of space.
Students would have to take let
ter grades in all minor courses if
the option is available.
