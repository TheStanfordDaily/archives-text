# Defining polo versatility
## Laster provides defensive prowess, scoring potential 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
What would you get if you could com
bine Deion Sanders with Jerry Rice?
You would have a defensive star who
takes away an opponent's top scoring
threat and then turns around and wreaks
havoc on the opposing defense with out
standing offensive skills.
While he does not toil on the gridiron
like Sanders and Rice, Stanford water
polo player Jeremy Laster displays a rare
combination of defensive and offensive
dominance in the pool. Like Sanders, who
helped the 49ers win a Super Bowl short
ly after his arrival in San Francisco,

Laster was the missing ingredient Stan
ford needed to start winning national
championships.
"We had a good solid core with Wolf
IWigo] and Frank ISchneider], but we
really became a great team when Jeremy
and Brian Wallin were added to the mix,"
said head coach Dante Dettamanti.
In 1992, Laster saw plenty of action
coming off the bench as a freshman. That
year, the Cardinal fell to California in
sudden-death overtime in the NCAA title
game. As a sophomore, earned All-
America honors, helping Stanford win its
first national championship since 1986.
