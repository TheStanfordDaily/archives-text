# Defining polo versatility
## Laster provides defensive prowess, scoring potential 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
What would you get if you could com
bine Deion Sanders with Jerry Rice?
You would have a defensive star who
takes away an opponent's top scoring
threat and then turns around and wreaks
havoc on the opposing defense with out
standing offensive skills.
While he does not toil on the gridiron
like Sanders and Rice, Stanford water
polo player Jeremy Laster displays a rare
combination of defensive and offensive
dominance in the pool. Like Sanders, who
helped the 49ers win a Super Bowl short
ly after his arrival in San Francisco,

Laster was the missing ingredient Stan
ford needed to start winning national
championships.
"We had a good solid core with Wolf
IWigo] and Frank ISchneider], but we
really became a great team when Jeremy
and Brian Wallin were added to the mix,"
said head coach Dante Dettamanti.
In 1992, Laster saw plenty of action
coming off the bench as a freshman. That
year, the Cardinal fell to California in
sudden-death overtime in the NCAA title
game. As a sophomore, earned All-
America honors, helping Stanford win its
first national championship since 1986.

Senior Jeremy Laster is winding up his storied career with the Cardinal and mov
ing on to the United States National Team.
Last year, Laster was named co-
MVP of the NCAA tournament as
the Cardinal captured another
NCAA crown
This season, while the Cardinal
struggled, Laster amassed 46
points, joining the team in late
September after practicing with the
United States National Team.

While Laster's contributions to
Stanford have been outstanding at
both ends of the pool, Dettamanti
speaks first about the defensive
skills Laster has honed in the past
three seasons.
"Jeremy is like Deion Sanders in
that he has the individual ability to
guard the best player from the
other team," Dettamanti said.
"That allows the rest of the team to
do different things defensively and
takes pressure of! the goalie.
"He is the best one-on-one

defender against the center-for
ward. When we don't have to dou
ble team there, it takes away the
opponent's outside shooting threat
and gives us the opportunity to
counterattack."
When Stanford counterattacks,
Laster becomes a scoring threat
from all areas of the pool. In his
first three seasons, Laster tallied
138 goals, including a career-high
55 points in his junior season.
Laster led the nation last year with
18 two-point goals.
"In his defensive contribution
alone, Jeremy is very valuable,"
Dettamanti said. "But he also adds
so much to the offense. As an out
side threat, he makes other teams
adjust their game. This year, teams
are pressing him all over the pool
and that has opened up everyone
else."
With the graduation of Wigo and
Schneider, opposing defenses
keyed on Laster more than ever,
which made Laster work harder for
his chances. "I think I've been
forced to improve other parts of my
game," he said. "I could get lazy last
year and just sit outside and shoot.
This year, I have to drive to get
open and counterattack hard to get
shots."
While Laster, who has been a
member of the United States
National Team since 1993,
assumed a variety of different
duties when playing for Stanford,
his role with Team USA is simple:
shoot the ball.
"The biggest difference on the
national team is that everyone has
a specialized role," Laster said. "At
Stanford, I was counted on to play
defense, counter, score and pass.
On the national team, you can con
centrate on what you are supposed
to do."
Since joining the U.S. team,
Laster has done his job well in inter
national competition. Most recent
ly, Lister was the United Suites'
second-leading scorer at Septem
ber's Water Polo World Cup in
Atlanta. Laster will leave Stanford
after exams to rejoin the national
team to train for the Olympics.
Atlanta was once the home of a
multi-talented superstar named
Deion. Jeremy Laster hopes to
make his mark there next summer
in the Prime Time setting of the
1996 Olympic Games.
