The No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball
team couldn't he happier with the draw for
this year's NCAA tournament.
Despite a redrawing of district lines that
placed the Cardinal (28-2) in the same dis
trict as No. 1 Nebraska, the NCAA Tourna
ment Selection Committee chose Stanford
as the overall top seed and host of the
Pacific Region.
The committee's move didn't exactly
slight the Huskers, however. Nebraska, 30-
1 on the year (with its only loss coming at
the hands of Stanford), will host a regional
as well. The other two top seeds in the tour
nament, No. 2 Hawaii and No. 4 Florida,
will also host regionals.
For Stanford, the NCAA's decision con

the toughest schedule in the nation but still
managed to win its last 25 matches. Indeed,
although volleyball coaches and writers
continually ranked the Cardinal behind the
other top seeds, the selection committee

still named Stanford the tournament's top
seed.
The Cardinal is battle-ready as it heads
into tournament competition. Stanford has
played 18 matches against teams ranked in
the top 25, including Nebraska, No. 5
Texas, No. 7 UCLA (twice), No. 9 Pacific
and No. 11 Washington State (twice).
While the Cardinal spikers aren't look
ing ahead to a final-four showdown in
Amherst, Mass. just yet, they know that
they most likely will have to survive a
rematch with Nebraska if they want to
repeat as national champions.
The Cornhuskers took the first game
from Stanford in a match at the Bob
Devaney Center in Lincoln, Neb. in the
first week of the season. But after dropping
the first game 15-8, the Cardinal prevailed
in the next three games, including a come
back from a 14-6 deficit in game three.
Though it faced a much less challenging
schedule than the Cardinal, Nebraska has
nonetheless impressed after its season-
