# Scientists probe surface of the sun
## Stanford-designed device measures sound waves that travel through the sun

Some of the mystery surrounding the sun
will soon be made clear using an instrument
designed by Stanford physicists to be launched
into space this weekend.
The device, known as the Michelson Doppler
Imager (MDI), is one of 12 instruments on an
unmanned spacecraft called the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The space
craft is scheduled to be launched either Friday
or Saturday, according to Kick Bogart, a
research physicist at Stanford's Hansen Exper
imental Physics Labs.
Bogart described the MDI as an instrument
to produce "high-resolution images of the sun,
primarily ... motions on the surface of the
sun." These motions are caused by waves gen
orated in the interior of the sun and may hold
clues about exactly what lies beneath the sun's
surface, he said.

The interior of the sun and what happens
there have always been something of a mystery,
Bogart said.
"We really don't understand the causes ...
of the generation of solar activity." The MDI
will measure "sound waves that travel through
the sun (and it will) tell us about the conditions
of the sun, ... temperature and composition at
points in the interior."
He added that no earth-based telescope has
been able to achieve high enough resolution to
measure these sound waves, due to interference
from the Earth's atmosphere.
In addition to sound waves, the MDI may be
able to measure motions caused by gravity
waves. Bogart said these waves "penetrate
much deeper" into the sun's core and may tell
us about its composition.
The sun's core is where the nuclear fusion
that generates all the sun's energy takes place.
It has not yet been possible to detect these
waves and measure them.

"If [the MDII can detect them," Bogart said,
"it will be enormously exciting."
The MDI will start coming up with "scien
tifically valuable" data within two months of
its launch, Bogart said. Within four months of
its launch it will go into orbit around the sun.
The launch from the Kennedy Space Center
in Florida is tentatively scheduled for 11:34
p.m. PST on Friday. The rocket was originally
supposed to go up on Thanksgiving Day, but
was kept on the ground due to mechanical prob
lems.
The MDI is the product of a group called
Solar Oscillations Investigations (SOI), which is
based at Stanford's observatory. Its chief inves
tigator is Philip Scherrer, a professor of physics.
A team of Stanford scientists and engineers
at IxKkheed Palo Alto designed the MDI, which
Lockheed built. Bogart said the SOI scientists
will manage all of the data that it produces. The
project is funded by a $75-million grant from
NASA.
