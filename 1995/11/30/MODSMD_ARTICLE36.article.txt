# Up close and personal with Gabriel Byrne: the Irish man speaks, with an accent
## 
### Alison Gordon 
"(/'o beyond what's reliable
in all that keeps pleading and pleading
these eyes and puddles and stones,
and recollect how bold you were
when I visited you first
with departures you cannot go back on."
("Making Strange" by Seamus Hcaney)
Ireland has tales to tell. Through verse,
stories and, more recently, film, the island
is variously portrayed as a place of ro
mantic imagination and dark myths, a shrine
to ancient pagan customs and a testimony of
modern religious conflict. The richness of
these contradictions begets two things: talent
and confusion.
Gabriel Byrne, a native of the Emerald
Isle, is a fascinating mixture of this very tal
ent and confusion. He divides his time be
tween "home" in Dublin and his house in
I.os Angeles and between his career as a
film actor ("Miller's Crossing," "Into the
West," "Little Women," "The Usual Sus
pects") and as an author (he has recently
published his memoirs, "Pictures in My
Head," and is in the process of finishing his
first novel).
In a recent interview, conducted while he

was in San Francisco publicizing his book of
memoirs, Byrne talked about leaving Ireland,
searching for a new perspective and discover
ing the pull of his roots. Recently, Byrne's na
tive land has been leading him to a new
search — finding his own unique sense of
what it means to be "Irish" and resolving his
confusion about his own identity.
A dark room lights up a path
"Pictures in my Head" is one of the ways
in which Byrne has been looking back to find
out who he is.
".. .The lovely sound spills out into the
dark street, making people stop to listen and
sometimes smile."
Byrne, reading from his book, describes a
scene from childhood. I le is a young boy, sit
ting with his grandmother in a dark room in
her house in Dublin. She has just turned on
the radio and suddenly the world is trans
formed. Strange voices fill the air, floating
and evaporating like Byrne's own voice as he
softly retells the tale.
Byrne's lilting Dublin brogue authenti
cates the chapter he reads. His skill as an
actor appears natural as he mimics the voices
of different characters and plays out the won
der that he felt as a child. The quite small,
dark-haired man, dressed all in black, has

been here a million times before; as he speaks
about his home, before an audience, he is on
familiar turf.
But his grandmother's real love, he nar
rates, was always cinema. She was the first
person to bring him to the movies and intro
duce him to a new visual world: "the pic
tures." The picture of the usher and a "high
dancing light as it lit our way to our seats."
The picture of "an explosion of blinding
color" and"the bluest sea I had ever seen."
The fleeting moments that Byrne de
scribes are poetic and perfect — as all child
hood recollections are meant to be. But they
also impart a greater sense of what the adult
actor perceives as art — the power of an
image — and what he perceives as part of his
heritage — the power of memory, "lighting
up no path, but never going out."
Departures
Byrne came to film much later in life than
is customary for most movie actors. Before
he began his career as an actor in theater and
television in Ireland, he had spent time living
in Spain and worked at different jobs — 112 rom
teacher to bull fighter, the story goes.
He came to America, he says, because up
until a couple of years ago it was impossible
to make a living as a film actor in Ireland. It
took him three-and-a-half years, he says, to
raise the $4 million he needed to make the
movie "Into the West," which co-starred his
former wife, Kllen Barkin.
He is more aware of his roots now that he
lives in America than when he was at home,
he says. "I'm constantly defined in Holly
wood by my accent," he explains. He is
known as "that Irish guy" or "that guy with
the accent."
The irony is that Byrne no longer feels he
has a proper place in Ireland. "When you
leave a country and go to another country,
you don't belong," he says, rubbing his hair as
though he is nervous or unsure of himself.
"It's the dilemma of exile." There is an un
spoken but deep resentment manifested to
wards those who leave and then return, he
says.
Byrne's eyes dart rapidly about the room
as he describes his feelings about Ireland. His
foot taps absent-mindedly against mine. His
voice is steady, but his talk is fast. Performing
to an audience and talking one-to-one are
two different things — when Byrne is asked
personal questions, he gets nervous.
Byrne's dislocation makes him feel like an
anomaly in both Ireland and America, he
says. He imagines himself to inhabit a "limbo
world."
Finding a place in the tribe
A wish to resolve his confusion over what
he calls "tribal displacement" has been lead
ing Byrne to explore new territory. He has re
cently set up a documentary film unit in
Dublin, and so far has completed two docu
mentaries about Ireland.
The first tells the true story of an immi
grant's first return home to Ireland in 40 years.
An 1.. A. woman brings her father back to a tiny
village in County Kerry, his old home.

"Being an immigrant myself, I was fasci
nated by the whole idea of return," says
Byrne. "It is the history of America."
The second documentary explores the
horror of the Irish famine which occurred in
the 1840s, devastating the island and causing
many millions to flee the country and go to
America. This was the beginning of the Irish
tradition of immigration.
Byrnes interest in the topic was stimulat
ed by a mixture of fascination — his mother
had regaled him with "terrible images and
tales" of the famine when he was a child
and ignorance — he knew little historical do
tail about the whole event.
The documentary was also Byrne's oppor
tunity to "find my place in the tribe," he says.
"It was a way for me to come to know myself
and my history in a very real way." The con
text of the famine, the emphasis on nature
and the land, made a deep impression on the
Irish actor. He realized how much history
was a source of his own identity. "You stand
in a place and you feel it. I found that place,"
he says."I realized that what I am is a prod
uct of being Irish, and being Irish is a product
of history."
Defining identity, creating art
But being Irish is more than history. "It
comes out of my soul," says Byrne, raising
his open hand to his chest as if he could
somehow pull forth the ethereal quality he
describes. He likens it to "duende," the
soul of Frederico Garcia Lorca's Spanish
gypsies.
Byrne, sitting at a small table in a private
area of the downtown San Francisco confer
ence center, is relaxed now. His eyes no
longer flit restlessly about the room, but look
candidly into mine. It is hard to know
whether he is more at ease with himself or
whether he is simply more comfortable with
the questions he is being asked.
The poeticism of Byrne's definition of
identity impacts greatly on his conception of
what constitutes art. "I'm very interested in
the idea of poetry and the connection be
tween poetry and cinema," he says. To Byrne,
poetry also means myth.
Myth is very much rooted in Ireland's cul
tural heritage. Fairies and leprechauns play a
large part in Irish folklore. "They are how «i
pagan people rationalized a cruel world," ex
plains Byrne.
Byrne realizes the relevance of these tales
"Myth is a response to the world around us,'
he says. " It is a primer of how we as a people
live our lives."
Irish stories, contends Byrne, have rele
vance to everyone because of the myths em
bedded in them. Myths, he says, "contain
basic universal truths. It doesn't matter
where they come from."
Perhaps looking beyond origins is the ke\
which will enable Byrne to unlock his owr
identity. For if he can "Go beyond what's re
liable" as the Irish poet Heaney suggests
Byrne will surely find a sense of identity rich
enough to embrace the contradictions of hi;
native land and the confusion of his own ex
perience.
