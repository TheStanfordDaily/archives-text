# Hoeg's History: A Dream within a Dream

If, while reading
Peter Hoeg's
"The History of
Danish Dreams,"
you happen to be
"awakened" by the
unwelcome ring of
a telephone, the
persistent growl
ines of a stomach

that refuses to be appeased by food for
thought, or any other impudent interruption
impossible to ignore, you will have to shrug
off the kind of dazed bewilderment likely to
follow a dream-plagued sleep as long as Den
mark's history.
After surfacing from this stupor, expect
that Hoeg's "History" will elude all but the
most determined efforts to recount it, since,
like a nighttime dream sequence, it impress
es the memory with its intensity, but the sur
feit of details are forgotten from one dream to
the next. And so I must confess that I am not
sure whether 1 read "The History of Danish
Dreams," or merely dreamt it, and this un
certainty is a testimony to the storyteller's

virtuosity.
"The History" is Hoeg's first novel, belat
edly published in English after he had won
international acclaim for his second novel,
"Smilla's Sense of Snow," a more traditional
yet nonetheless unique thriller. First novels
are lamentably subject to the clich£d re
sponse — "an ambitious first novel, indica
tive of a promising young talent" — and
"The History" could be cursorily summed
up by such a review.
Hoeg, however, is no more subject to
cliche than he is to the bounds of the plausi
ble in his storytelling. To write "The History
of 1 )anish Dreams" seems to be the effrontery
of an upstart aspiring to write the Great Dan
ish Novel. Yet Hoeg, despite his international
fame, has proved himself first and foremost a
Danish writer, by establishing both a leg
endary Denmark and a satirized Danish na
tion in the imaginations of his audience.
Although Hoeg touts (and titles) his novel
as "The 1 listory," complete with a chronolo
gy and convoluted family trees whose
branches ingeniously intertwine, the title
taken as a whole is oxymoronic, for the histo
ry of dreams is a history in "dream time,"
with the inflexible spine of chronology as a
mere decoy, as well as one which relinquish
es any claim to fact. In the fantastical tales

which comprise "The History," "history" as
we understand it is constantly undermined
by whimsical revisions and falsifications per
petuated by "social forces," as well as the ac
tors themselves.
In the second chapter, "Time that Passes,"
the Old I-ady, a publishing magnate whom
William Randolph Hearst would envy, dic
tates the future down to its most minute de
tails using her broad sheet as a vehicle, there
by turning her household, town and all of
Denmark into an insidious clockwork.
While the Old Lady is Hoeg's most
egregious example of those who
play loose and fast with history by
inventing it a priori, she is also emblematic of
characters who are present, despite their ab
sence, or absent despite their presence. De
spite (or perhaps because of) their vivid idio
syncrasies, the esteemed personages of this
history remain intangible abstractions and,
as such, never really emerge from the dream
haze, into which they frequently dissolve or
disappear completely.
Although I loeg's "History" bears as little
resemblance to history as do dreams, the
same penchant for sardonic social commen
tary manifest in "Smilla's Sense of Snow" is
even more in evidence in"The History,"

which presents a caricature of Danish histo
ry through the histories of its families and
their "dreams" — dreams they ostensibly
share with other Danes of their respective
eras and social class. Whether it is the dream
of the declining aristocracy to stop time dead
in its tracks in order to preserve their waning
privilege, that of the bourgeois to harness
time to their ambitions, of the evangelical
Christians or proselytizing socialists to em
bark upon a new epoch (of social or spiritu
al redemption), or that of each successive
generation to obfuscate its origins with the
passage of time and successfully falsify its
history, these are portrayed as dreams of a
nation, rather than those of individuals
whose personal and fantastical fates merely
serve to illustrate.
After the first turgid chapters that bode
disappointment for fans of Smilla, Hoeg
gains momentum so that by the middle of the
380-page novel, the reader is left gaping at
feats of high-wire imagination which pro
ceed at a dizzying pace. In the hurly-burly of
this headlong narration, Hoeg risks hasten
ing the reader through his own remarkable
poetry. Thankfully, "The History" — unlike
dreams that disintegrate at dawn — has been
preserved for posterity, so that Iloeg's poetry
can be savored in revisitation.
