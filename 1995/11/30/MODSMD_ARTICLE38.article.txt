# Subjection and Subjectivism in Genet's "The Maids"
## 
### Samuel Park 
I hc subject matter of Jean Genet's "The
Maids sounds like the childhood you wish
you never had. The play contains eroticism,
homosexuality, incest and crime. But what
may sound like a tawdry affair is in reality a
disturbing, often shocking play dealing with
transgression and the struggle between the
imaginary and the real.
"The Maids" opened yesterday at l ittle
Theater and runs until Sunday. It is based on
the true story of the Papin sisters, who shocked
1930s France when they brutally killed their
mistress and their mistress's daughter. Genet
took the event, turned it inside out and creat
ed a one-act drama that speaks brazenly about
the extremities of the criminal mind.
Solange (Jessica Frantzreb) and Claire
(Marjorie Crigler) are the two maids whose
main activity is to play-act, assuming the roles
of Madame and maid. When the curtain
opens, we see Claire, decked out as Madame,
verbally abusing her sister Solange, who is
playing Claire / maid.
The scene becomes increasingly bizarre and
sexually charged, and at one point the
maid / Solange drags a half-naked
Madame / Claire on the linoleum floor. There
is an element of sadomasochism and sexual
deviance in the relationship, with the women

occasionally trading the roles of dominatrix
and slave.
The ceremony is supposed to end with
Madame /Claire's death, but "the same thing

happens every time," says Solange,
"and it's |Claire's| fault. You're never
ready. I can't finish you off."
dearly, there's something unnat
ural going on. Claire mouths her
words like an actress playing an ac
tress, and Solange sexualizes an act as
simple as holding a towel. They are
both caught in unrealistic role-play
ing, which is exactly the effect that di
rector lean-Marie Apostolides is
going for. He emphasizes the bizarre
aspects of this ceremony, accentuat
ing its ritualistic side.
"What 1 really tried to do was to
transform the play into classical
tragedy," said Apostolides, a professor
in both the 1 )epartment of French and
Italian and the Drama Department.
"When the two maids are playing, they
are always aware that they arc risking
their lives. They are having a lucid con
frontation with death, and for me,
that's what defines a classical tragedy."
Apostolides ensured the sense of
tragedy by having his actors exagger
ate their speech and perform as if
they were wearing masks.

"We tried to go beyond realism in order to
create this tragic and religious atmosphere,"
Apostolides said. "American actors tend to be
realistic, and we had to go beyond that."

I his ritualistic approach is also visible on
the bareness ot the stage, which is reduced to .1
minimum as dictated by necessity.
Aside from the escape from reality, Apos
tolides had other concerns. One was to avoid
reducing the play to its psychological and soci
ological dimensions. He was more interested
in the metaphysical.
"I didn't want to reduce this to a class strug
gle conflict," Apostolides said. "I was more in
terested in the poetic and mystical ceremonies."
Apostolides seems to have accomplished all
of his goals, due largely to the take-no-prison
crs performances of Frantzreb and Crigler as
the two maids. They throw themselves body
and soul into these two disturbed women,
achieving (to quote Sartre) "an absolute state
of artifice" and ensuring an ending of tragic
proportions.
