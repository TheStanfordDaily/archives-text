# Call in the Mod Squad:
## San Jose gets a modern art makeover 
### Kristic Lü Stout 
Please excuse San lose. Its just going
through one of those ... phases.
Still pimpled with strip malls n' multiplex
es and blemished by grossly large convention
centers, San lose remains the gawky kid-sister
city which would eagerly give away her entire
wardrobe allowance (ta-ta, tiny satin black
backpack) just to have the chance to become
chic, cosmopolitan, world-class....
In exchange lor about $4.4 million, New
York's Whitney Museum of American Art has
agreed to fill four 18-month-long shows at
the San Jose Museum of Art.
"before"
"American Art 1940-1965: Traditions Re
considered" is the second of tour exhibitions
resulting from the San lose and Whitney col
laboration. The collaboration is designed to
give San Jose an educational context for its
contemporary exhibitions and to foster sup
port for the growth of its own permanent col
lection.
Essentially, it's a much needed shot of cul
tural HGH.
San Jose's reputation as a mecca of high art
has long paralleled that of Michael Jackson's
Never Never Land. The garish plastic snow
that frosts the plaza lawn across from the mu
seum may have the civic intent to instill holi
day goodwill, but it undoubtedly raises the
city's score on the low-brow-o'-meter a few
embarrassing notches. The recently-iced
Dorothy Hamill outdoor skating rink is not
only the size of a Holiday Inn kiddy pool, it's
a bona fide haven of cheap n' transient
McLeisure in the heart of the downtown area.
Granted, San Jose is the third largest city
in California (third to L.A. and San Diego),
but why doesn't it look like it? Fortunately,
the latest Whitney installment at the San lose
Museum of Art may very well reveal the la
tent cosmopolitan aspirations of this adoles
cent city.
"after"
With selections from the permanent col
lection of the Whitney Museum of American
Art, the world's largest collection of modern
American art in the world, "Traditions Re
considered" looks at the movements that
evolved over a 25-year period of unprece
dented development in the United States, a
time when American art finally received in
ternational attention. The show looks at the
predominately abstract work of this time
with respect to how traditions of art making
(i.e. portraiture, landscape and still life) have
evolved over time.
Co-curated by both the San Jose Museum
of Art and the Whitney, the show is organized
in a roughly chronological order, grouped by
stylistic developments: surrealism, abstract
expressionism and color field painting, pop
and minimalism.
Led by the co-curators of the show, I wan
dered through a meandering labyrinth of ex
hibit space, bug-eyed and curious. Eventual
ly, I came face-to-face with a peculiar life

form. Wearing a
halo of suspended
wooden follicles and
encased in a I ucitc
box, Alexander
("alder's "Wooden
Bottle with 1 lairs" is
one of the key pieces
ol the first section of
the exhibit titled
"Traditions Adapt
ed, a section ex
hibiting art that in
terprets the world
through fantastical,
dream-like forms.

turned a corner and
was assaulted by
"Fear," a surreal Yves
Tanguy landscape of
an alien terrain
blackened from de
struction, smudged
with sickening hues
of red and grossly
infected with streaks
of yellow.
The sinister land
sranr p;iv(> wav tn a

realm of airy, atmospheric color washes in
the next exhibit space titled "Traditions Ex
panded." Here, the artworks employ creative
ways to directly integrate color with the can
vas via sponging, pouring and sensuous veil
like washes. The result is a series of gargan
tuan canvases that literally engulf the viewer
in an experience of pure color. Works glow
ing in this ethereal nook include a piece by
Helen Frankenthaler titled "Arden," an airy
and atmospheric tribute to the mystical
Shakespearean forest of the same name, and
"Tet" by Morris Louis, a meditative blur of
blue. Beth Venn, associate curator of the
Whitney's permanent collection, made sure
to lend her enthusiasm to "1953," a Mark
Rothko painting, lauding its mystical lumi
nosity framed by an anthropomorphic can
vas: "Rothko deliberately developed his
paintings to be of a human scale. The artist
meant for people to meditate in front of this
painting. It's an encounter." Indeed, stand
ing in front of this work induces the dermis
tickling sensations of a confrontation with
an alluring stranger.
Sauntering towards the next exhibit
space, I received a disclaimer about what was
to come next: "No more soothing, medita
tive aura," warned Dianne Hoover, associate
curator at the San Jose Museum of Art. Step
ping into this section, titled "Traditions Re
defined," could take a jab or two at your
jugular. Here, the monstrous canvasses are
vigorously painted with drips, splashes and
sweeping strokes, their blatant aggression
invoking an immediate, visceral response. A
Franz Kline glares at the timid senior docent
on my right while Joan Brown's heavily im

pastoed "Still Life with Vegetables" threatens
to spill ochre and blood red all over my white
blouse. Near the corner hangs a woman who
seems to be convulsing off the canvas. It's de
Kooning's "Woman and Bicycle." Her toon
like Hanna-Barbera eyes of yellow, paint
slashed body and violently jostling breasts
painted in an embarrassing pink hue have
the capacity to prod and disturb.
"Traditions Renewed" is the name of the
next lair of art works, a collection of pop art
that responds to the growing commercial
ization and consumer culture of America in
the 19605. Claes Oldenburg mocks society's
reliance on consumer products with
"Dormeyer Mixer," a flabby cake mixer
(sewn and stuffed in patent leather) that
hangs from the ceiling. John Chamberlain
presents another peculiar spin on sculptural
art with "Velvet White," an intended mis
nomer to describe his sculpture of cold, hard
discarded auto parts. Other artists exhibited
in this grouping include Jasper Johns,
George Segal, Roy Liechtenstein and Andy
Warhol. Providing an interpretation of still
life art in the context of the pop '60s, the co
curators exposed the message behind
Warhol's repetitive rows of glassware in
"Green Coca-Cola Bottles:" "Repetition
makes reference to how they sit on a shelf,
but there's more than that. Artists use still
objects to represent culture at that time. It
asks us — do we really want to look so favor
ably on something that is not really about
being unique but about being part of the
crowd?"
In the pack of scribbling journalists, I was
ushered to the final chamber of American
modern art, an area described as "Traditions

Distilled," where art is distilled to its basic el
ements. In this section, Joseph Albers, Don
ald Judd and Frank Stella provide clear and
direct works of art that maximize visual ex
perience and provide a sort of museum-trot
ting "cool down" session: Color. Line. Form.
(Breathe in.) Shape. (Breathe out.) The end.
Leaving the exhibit halls of the San Jose
Museum of Art, I was hopeful for the civic
future of the city. A collection such as this
will inevitably boost the image of San Jose
from cheesy forum of housing developments
and shopping centers to a cosmopolitan city
whose future is bound to the growth of arts
and cultural activity.
And then I hear Him, a Random Bay
Arean, wonder in 430 decibels, "What a
waste of space. Can't the Sharks play there?"
He pointed at the museum building. The
senior docent at my side rolled her eyes and I
skipped to the local mall for a latte.

Essentially, it's a much needed shot of cul

San Jose's reputation as a mecca of high art
has long paralleled that of Michael Jackson's
Never Never Land. The garish plastic snow
that frosts the plaza lawn across from the mu

day goodwill, but it undoubtedly raises the
city's score on the low-brow-o'-meter a few
embarrassing notches. The recently-iced
Dorothy Hamill outdoor skating rink is not
only the size of a Holiday Inn kiddy pool, it's
a bona fide haven of cheap n' transient

in California (third to L.A. and San Diego),
but why doesn't it look like it? Fortunately,

Museum of Art may very well reveal the la

cent city.
"after"
With selections from the permanent col
lection of the Whitney Museum of American
Art, the world's largest collection of modern
American art in the world, "Traditions Re
considered" looks at the movements that
evolved over a 25-year period of unprece
dented development in the United States, a
time when American art finally received in
ternational attention. The show looks at the
predominately abstract work of this time
with respect to how traditions of art making
(i.e. portraiture, landscape and still life) have
evolved over time.
Co-curated by both the San Jose Museum
of Art and the Whitney, the show is organized
in a roughly chronological order, grouped by
stylistic developments: surrealism, abstract
expressionism and color field painting, pop
and minimalism.
Led by the co-curators of the show, I wan
dered through a meandering labyrinth of ex
hibit space, bug-eyed and curious. Eventual
ly, I came face-to-face with a peculiar life

form. Wearing a
halo of suspended
wooden follicles and
encased in a I ucitc
box, Alexander
("alder's "Wooden
Bottle with 1 lairs" is
one of the key pieces
ol the first section of
the exhibit titled
"Traditions Adapt

terprets the world
through fantastical,
dream-like forms.

turned a corner and

"Fear," a surreal Yves
Tanguy landscape of
an alien terrain
blackened from de

with sickening hues
of red and grossly
infected with streaks

The sinister land
sranr p;iv(> wav tn a

realm of airy, atmospheric color washes in
the next exhibit space titled "Traditions Ex
panded." Here, the artworks employ creative
ways to directly integrate color with the can
vas via sponging, pouring and sensuous veil
like washes. The result is a series of gargan
tuan canvases that literally engulf the viewer
in an experience of pure color. Works glow
ing in this ethereal nook include a piece by
Helen Frankenthaler titled "Arden," an airy
and atmospheric tribute to the mystical
Shakespearean forest of the same name, and
"Tet" by Morris Louis, a meditative blur of
blue. Beth Venn, associate curator of the
Whitney's permanent collection, made sure
to lend her enthusiasm to "1953," a Mark
Rothko painting, lauding its mystical lumi
nosity framed by an anthropomorphic can
vas: "Rothko deliberately developed his
paintings to be of a human scale. The artist
meant for people to meditate in front of this
painting. It's an encounter." Indeed, stand
ing in front of this work induces the dermis
tickling sensations of a confrontation with
an alluring stranger.
Sauntering towards the next exhibit
space, I received a disclaimer about what was
to come next: "No more soothing, medita
tive aura," warned Dianne Hoover, associate
curator at the San Jose Museum of Art. Step
ping into this section, titled "Traditions Re
defined," could take a jab or two at your
jugular. Here, the monstrous canvasses are
vigorously painted with drips, splashes and
sweeping strokes, their blatant aggression
invoking an immediate, visceral response. A
Franz Kline glares at the timid senior docent
on my right while Joan Brown's heavily im

pastoed "Still Life with Vegetables" threatens
to spill ochre and blood red all over my white
blouse. Near the corner hangs a woman who
seems to be convulsing off the canvas. It's de
Kooning's "Woman and Bicycle." Her toon
like Hanna-Barbera eyes of yellow, paint
slashed body and violently jostling breasts
painted in an embarrassing pink hue have
the capacity to prod and disturb.
"Traditions Renewed" is the name of the
next lair of art works, a collection of pop art
that responds to the growing commercial
ization and consumer culture of America in
the 19605. Claes Oldenburg mocks society's
reliance on consumer products with
"Dormeyer Mixer," a flabby cake mixer
(sewn and stuffed in patent leather) that
hangs from the ceiling. John Chamberlain
presents another peculiar spin on sculptural
art with "Velvet White," an intended mis
nomer to describe his sculpture of cold, hard
discarded auto parts. Other artists exhibited
in this grouping include Jasper Johns,
George Segal, Roy Liechtenstein and Andy
Warhol. Providing an interpretation of still
life art in the context of the pop '60s, the co
curators exposed the message behind
Warhol's repetitive rows of glassware in
"Green Coca-Cola Bottles:" "Repetition
makes reference to how they sit on a shelf,
but there's more than that. Artists use still
objects to represent culture at that time. It
asks us — do we really want to look so favor

being unique but about being part of the

In the pack of scribbling journalists, I was
