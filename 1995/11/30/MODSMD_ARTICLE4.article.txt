# He's back: Obscene caller 'Oscar' reappears
## 
### Molly Stephens Staff writer 
He's crude. He's crass. And he's back
with a vengeance.
The obscene phone caller who calls him
self "Oscar" — and who allegedly harassed
numerous women last spring — is once
again plaguing Stanford women with sexu
ally explicit phone calls. During this past
month alone, 11 women filed reports with
the Stanford Police after receiving calls

from Oscar.
Although victims said Oscar asked for
them hy name when he called, police believe
the person or persons acting as "Oscar" are
using a program to call people randomly.
Oscar generates a list of sequential num
bers either by hand or by computer and be
gins calling the numbers. If a woman an
swers the phone, he talks to her. If a man
answers, he simply hangs up the phone, ac
cording to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.

"The first time he called he asked for me
by name," said one senior who received two
calls from Oscar. "I said, This is she.' He
asked how I was, and I said, 'I'm fine. Who
is this?' He said, This is Oscar,' and I said,
'Oscar who?' He then said, 'I want to fuck
you,' and I hung up.
"It's frightening when he knows your
name," she said.
Another woman also reported a similar
conversation with Oscar. "He used my
name and said something like 'I want to

suck your cunt,' " she said. The woman,
who is a freshman, has received two phone
calls. "It really scared me. He repeated the
same sequence of phrases both times he
called."
Stanford women are not the only victims
of Oscar's obscenities. Niemeyer said that
Oscar has been calling all over the Bay Area,
including Alherton, Menlo Park, San Jose
State University and Santa Clara University.
