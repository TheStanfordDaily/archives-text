# He's back: Obscene caller 'Oscar' reappears
## 
### Molly Stephens Staff writer 
He's crude. He's crass. And he's back
with a vengeance.
The obscene phone caller who calls him
self "Oscar" — and who allegedly harassed
numerous women last spring — is once
again plaguing Stanford women with sexu
ally explicit phone calls. During this past
month alone, 11 women filed reports with
the Stanford Police after receiving calls

from Oscar.
Although victims said Oscar asked for
them hy name when he called, police believe
the person or persons acting as "Oscar" are
using a program to call people randomly.
Oscar generates a list of sequential num
bers either by hand or by computer and be
gins calling the numbers. If a woman an
swers the phone, he talks to her. If a man
answers, he simply hangs up the phone, ac
cording to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.

"The first time he called he asked for me
by name," said one senior who received two
calls from Oscar. "I said, This is she.' He
asked how I was, and I said, 'I'm fine. Who
is this?' He said, This is Oscar,' and I said,
'Oscar who?' He then said, 'I want to fuck
you,' and I hung up.
"It's frightening when he knows your
name," she said.
Another woman also reported a similar
conversation with Oscar. "He used my
name and said something like 'I want to

suck your cunt,' " she said. The woman,
who is a freshman, has received two phone
calls. "It really scared me. He repeated the
same sequence of phrases both times he
called."
Stanford women are not the only victims
of Oscar's obscenities. Niemeyer said that
Oscar has been calling all over the Bay Area,
including Alherton, Menlo Park, San Jose
State University and Santa Clara University.
Niemeyer said catching an
obscene phone caller is virtually
impossible because Stanford has
its own self-contained phone sys
tem. Police are unable to trace calls
coming from outside the system,
Niemeyer also said that since
many obscene callers use pay
phones, traps and traces are not
very effective.
"We've traced some obscene
phone calls, but they've come
from pay phones in places like
bars and 7-lis," Niemeyer said.
Traps and traces are also very

expensive and subscribers gener
ally have to pay for them.
Niemeyer said other devices
are available to deal with annoy
ing phone callers. One device is a
call-back system made available
through AT&T. At the press of a
button, the system dials the num
ber of the person who just called.
But Niemeyer added that because
most offenders use pay phones
and Stanford does not use AT&T
service, this device would not be
effective on campus.
"The best thing to do is when
you immediately figure out that a
weirdo is on the line, you should
take a shrill whistle and blast it on
that sucker," Niemeyer said. "Or
you can hang up the phone."
