# Indie-rock blues explosion
## This is the ballad of 
### Travis Vigil 
From the Grifters to Doo Rag to the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, lots

of indie bands of late have been digging up their bluesy roots

and producing some memorable recordings in the

process, mixing the old with the new to make some
thing even newer. While King Kong and Railroad Jerk
neither popularize nor typify this genre (if it can be
called a genre), they do manage to stand out from the
rest of the underground blues-pop crop. Eccentric
and eclectic types, King Kong and Railroad Jerk make

jumbled bluesy pop with a modest sense of humor,

using blues more as a stylistic toy than as a musical influence, playing
with the blues instead of just playing it.

A wise man once said that art is never created; it is mere
ly rearranged. Simply put, everything that humans
make has evolved from somewhere. It has just been al
tered to fit its environment. Whether or not one agrees with
this contention is irrelevant for the purposes of this article,
because for the band Railroad Jerk, that is the governing
equation.
Railroad )erk is an eclectic band from New York ( ity, and
their music has been appropriately described as the urbaniza
tion of blues, country and traditional music. In fact, it is
probably fair to sav that they are four white boys singing the
urban blues: Marcellus Hall (vocals and guitar), Tony Lee
(bass guitar), Alec Stephens (guitar) and Dave Varenka
(drums). Their 1995 release on Matador Records, "One Track
Mind," has received critical acclaim with much ink used try
ing to pinpoint genre and influences. 1 lowevcr, like so much
in this world, their music escapes classification. It is a chaotic
collage ot country, blues, folk and rock, tempered with street
wise cynicism and a sense of humor. It's like an antique shop.
The stuff may be old and used, but it has a certain personali
ty to which all the new things in the world could never com
pare.

This "some of everything" sentiment is clearly expressed
by Alec Stephens. U I love all sorts of music," he says. "You
name it, I like it. 1 can play a little bit of everything, but
nothing seriously. I.ike, I can't play real Spanish classical guitar,
but I'll invoke these things.... I feel like having that broad aspect
really helps the band. Hut it's not like, 'Oh we're going to have a
song that sounds like jazz.' It's just that putting those [different]
elements together really adds to it."
While the band's influences are, in most respects, American
standards, this music transported to our times sounds so differ
ent from the usual radio sludge; it is so much more alive. This is
an unsurprising revelation considering that our generation was
raised on overproduction, synthesizers and digital effects. With
Railroad lerk, the guitars pop and crack. The vocals are heartfelt
and warm with no reverb. They sound like earlv blues recordings.
However, the music has more rock influences and wit with less of
"My baby just left me."
"1 think our stuff has a blues structure," explains Stephens.

"We use the chords of the blues, but t hen it has a lot of country in
it. Marce, our singer, likes George Jones and Woody Guthrie. 1 le
likes that simplistic sort of folk stuff. But then [our musicj is re
gentrified. We're taking it a little more to the edges?
Much like jazz, the music also has a lot to do with immediate
feelings and not so much to do with rules and boundaries. Songs
evolve within the song and over time. Stephens accurately de
scribes this phenomenon when commenting on the track
"Rollerkoaster" on "One Track Mind."
"I'm sort of wandering around the neck-board.... I'm im
provising, you know. I don't always play the song the same way
every time. The arrangement of notes could be a little different.
They could walk They could ascend and descend differently. I
was listening to the album and I said, 'God, I really don't do it like
that anymore' — you know, after playing it so many times."
But apart from all of this analysis, there is one more thing that
Railroad lerk exemplifies. That is that rock and roll was never
about being talented, well-versed or trained. It always wasand al

ways will be about being real, straightforward and fallible. More
importantly, rock and roll will always be about having fun and
playing this music because :t is your love. Nowhere is this more
apparent than in the lyrics and the overall feel of "One Track
Mind"
Maybe it's the tact th.it this econo-band sings so deadpan
about a" 10 million dollar record contract," or the realization that
they "don't shun success anymore." Or maybe it's the way that
Marcellus llall manages to rhyme "Philadelphia" with "fell tor
you." Then again it might be that the inside covcr to the CD in
sert proclaims the album "Their Brilliant Debut" — never mind
the fact they've previously released at least five recordings. What
ever it is, there is something that is downright infectious and lov
able about this band.
Take for example "The Ballad of Railroad Jerk." Over heavy in
dustrial chatter and train whistles, Hall half chants, half sings,
"So when the bars are closed and the subways are cracking / The
party that you went to just wasn't really happening / The lights
are dim, the shades are drawn, the national anthem on TV just
went on / You find that the blind are just killing the blind, and
you don't want to he one of those kind / Don't despair because
they said it wouldn't work— This is the ballad oI Railroad Jerk."
"Marce likes to play with words," explains Stephens. "He gets
off on that; testing the bounds of language. [The music) does
have a sense of humor and cynicism t00.... Some people will get
it and other people won t get it. It's interesting to watch. I've had
blank stares and I've had laughs too. So it's somewhere in be
tvveen."
For a band to keep in such good spirits after countless nights
in countless bars and countless drives from this shit town to
that is really quite amazing. Thevare not doing this for fame
and fortune because as Stephens explains, "I work a little. I'm not
quite living off the royalties yet." So maybe their fame and fortune
will come and maybe it never will, but, for right now, Railroad
Jerk is having a good time laughing at the world and at them
selves.
But most of all, these guys are doing it because they love to
play. "It's good putting on a good show; watching people get into
it and making people happy, states Stephens. "That's what 1 like
about playing— it's fun
