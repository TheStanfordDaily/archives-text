# King Kong into the future
## 
### Mike Noren Groovin backwards 
CC 112 ing Kong is like the king of the animals," Ethan Buck-
ler says with an odd pride. "King Kong is kind of like
JLX.the animal's revenge.... King Kong stands tor him
self and does his own thing. And he's like emotional and stuff.
He doesn't worry about trying to make money."
Louisville rock outfit King Kong is Buckler's brainchild — a
wonderful blend ot dopey pop and groove-oriented blues, and in
deed the indie-rock equivalent of the giant ape of the same name.
Marked with a primitive enthusiasm and an intentionally basic
sonic flow, Buckler and company celebrate nature by imitating it,
pulling everything together with a clumsy animalistic vibe that's
every bit as honest as it is funny. Buckler once told one interview
er, "1 sort of look like a monkey," and he might not have been kid
ding.
uckler's playful fascination
|-£ with the curvy line between humanity and nature turns up

JLJ in much of King Kong's
work: On the title track to the
group's swell second full-length,
"l unny Farm," Buckler romps
through the magical barnyard
where "Fish are jumpin' " and
Tigs are humpin' " before leap
ing into the classic chorus of
"Rooster in the henhouse / Cock
a-doodle doo / Cock-a-doodle
doo / ( ock-a-doodle-doo / How
now brown cow? / Cock-a-doo
dle-moo / Cock-a-doodle
moo / C.ock-a doodle-moo."
With cheery keyboards and
st rummy guitar, the band revels in
the innocently dumb life of care-

free farm animals.
"Yeah, that's like the King Kong theme," Buckler says simply.
"Animals."
Despite the group's thoroughly promising beginnings, few
could expect a work as hilariously groundbreaking as their latest
offering, "Me Hungry," released recently on Chicago's Drag City
Records. To make a long story short, "Me Hungry" is a concept
album about a caveman, chronicling his life as he runs from
sabertooth tigers and bears ("Beastie bear, let me eat my berries
in peace!"), makes love to his yak ("To pull your horns until your
head comes back / Is to give love to a yak"), meets a woman for
the first time ("You not man / But you look like me"), breaks up
with his yak ("I'm a man, you're a yak / Understand, a fact's a
fact") and ultimately supports his family through the coming of
the Ice Age by killing his formerly beloved yak, eating its meat
and wearing its fur.
The story is told through Amy Greenwood's clearly sung nar
ration and Buckler's caveman-talk interjections, and as always,
the tale is backed by the expert musicianship of Buckler's crew of
bassist Willy Maclean and drummer Dave Pajo (who is replaced
on tour by Ray Riz/.0, due to Pajo's involvement with numerous
other great bands).
Buckler has always been interested in concept albums. Even
1993's "Funny Farm" was a concept album in a looser sense: "I
tried to make as many songs as possible have something to do with
a farm," he says. But "Me Hungry" is a clearer, more fully-devel
oped work, with an intricate plot that slowly unfolds like a twist
ed Disney classic.

The "Me 1 iungry" idea started simply enough: "We were writ
ing bass lines and stuff, and I noticed it had a prehistoric kind of
sound to it," Buckler says. "That's sort of what I thought of, like
cavcman days. So we decided to make it a concept album about a
caveman."
The dramatic development of the project took off from there.
"My friend told me about Aristotelian tragedy" he says. "You
know, it's like Aristotle came up with, where you have an intro
duction, then a day in the life and then you have a dilemma. What
ever, it's really a typical structure for tragedy, like a Shakespeare
play or something."
After deciding to structure "Me Hungry" as an Aristotelian
tragedy, Buckler tailored the music to move with the plot. "With
every part of the story, I tried to make the music have that feel, he
says. "Because with Aristotelian tragedy, you have all the emo
tional spectrums, so I wanted to try to get them all in."
Another major influence in the development of "Me I lungry

was, of course, the story of
"King Kong." With the yak's
love for the caveni.ni parallel to
the giant ape's love lor the
woman, "Me Hungn presents
the "King Kong" human-beast
love story from a different per
spective, told with a focus on
the human rather than on the
beast — though as the story un
folds, the survival-driven cave
man is portrayed as more beast
ly than the generally elegant
yak.
"It's like man versus nature,
which all King Kong is basically
about," Buckler explains. "It has

to do with being natural or not being natural, human beings'
place in the world."
Before King Kong, Buckler played bass in Slint, a very un- King
Kong bunch of musicians who — over the course of two al
bums and a mysterious single — somehow became some ot
the more impressive and respected indie figures of the last 10 years.
But buckler makes it clear that he doesn't like to talk about Slint.
Buckler was in the band for just one year (he quit because "Slint
sort of got into the Steve Albini route" and he "wasn't really into
Steve Albini so much"), but it was enough to cast a persistent and
annoying shadow over his subsequent work with King Kong.
"1 played on the first Slint album," he says, referring to 1989's
"Tweez." "But it kind of came back to haunt me a little bit because
Slint has the big cult following everywhere, and [fans] see my
name from Slint and go to King Kong shows and they don't un
derstand why it doesn't sound like Slint. Or people tell me, 'Oh, I
love Slint.' I'm like, 'I'm not in Slint any more. Go worship some
body else.' w
The bitterness with which Buckler tackles (or refuses to tackle)
Slint questions drives home an important point about Buckler
and his music. Spin magazine might call the group a "nutso prim
itivist blues band," but King Kong is serious business, as legitimate
a musical endeavor as Slint or anything else. After all, "Me Hun
gry" was partially inspired by Aristotle and Shakespeare.
"I like to be funny, but [King Kongl is not a joke," Buckler says
plainly. "I've been doing it for seven years. I wouldn't take seven
years as a joke."
