## PIZZICATO FIVE The 						Sound of Music By Pizzicato Five 
### 
Listening to I'i/zicato l ive s first I'.S. re
lease, 1994's 'Made in I'SA," the question
was whether it was a nisi joke or a joke on its
newfound audience. I he album, which in
cluded the glorious kitsch gem Twiggy,
Twiggy / Twiggy vs. lames Bond," proved a
yummy piece ot junk c ulture, even il the allu
sious, winks and nods only made sense the
Pacific Ocean away. One part spry dance
pop, one part 60s bubblegum, one part
punk smart, many parts image-conscious
s.iss, the I I' was a gimniick made better over
there than anyone over here could.
With Ps's latest, " The Sound of Music By
Pizzicato l ive," it's a matter of whether any
one cares more than anything else. The an
swer appears to be yes; after all, the duo's lat
est single "Happy Sail ' was co-opted by the
"Unzipped" fashion documentary and the
new record has been copiously reviewed. So
now that novelty has worn oft and there .ire
still (more and more) people tuning in,
maybe P5 will be acknowledged as a witty, in
genious act in musical terms, kinda like the
way the less foreign yet inferior Brit combo
Saint Ltienne is praised.
I )on't count on it. Its just because Pizzica
to l ive is nothing like a band in any typical
sense. That something more, which is so ob
vious live, comes through on record too. T he
first track, "We Love Pizzicato l ive," is a
send-up of the theme from "Bye Bye Birdie,"
where school-aged kids sing the verse "We
love you P5 / (Mi yes we do" with the earnest

ness of the Pledge of Allegiance. And in the
press kit, Ps's behind-the-scenes master
mind Yasuharu Konishi exhorts American
fans to "please sing the song with everyone"
next time the group comes to town.
That covers the first 20 seconds. The hour
plus that follows is refreshing, though one
acquainted with P5 wouldn't expect any less.
The splendid "Happy Sad" is a better pop
tune than " Twiggy, Twiggy," more happy
than sail because ot its brisk guitar part and
Maki Novimas carefree I nglish / Japanese
vocals. ( ombined with the crisp, psyche
delia lite sounds on "Strawberry Sleighride"
and the clean, loungey vibe of "fortune
( ookie, Novima s clear voice sounds so
fresh and shiny.
Yet the best moments on " The Sound ol
Music" are the ones that rely on far-out
sounds more than classic song structures.
"Sophisticated ( akin is space-age stuff,
blasting oil to twinkling squeaks, anxious
rhythms and a chant ol "catchy" in the back
ground. "Good" is as insistent and astro
nomic as "Sophisticated Catchy," but even
more engagingly absurd with its Maki Maki
dialogue in three languages and unavoidable,
carnival like keyboard bit that runs through
the piece. Which goes to show that, when its
done well, even the strangest of the strangest
translates and makes sense.
