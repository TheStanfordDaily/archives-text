# ASH
## Trailer 
### 
Slowly and painfully, noise attacks your
ears. I ike a nasty cold, noise hangs tight —
infecting and corrupting everything from
your cochlea to your auditory canal. By now,

you must be begging
to know how you
could experience
this ungodly entity
called noise. That's
simple. Buy Ash's
debut album, "Trail
er."
Who's the culprit
for the album's dis
jointedness? The in
strumentals. The
music seems to go in
a hundred different
directions, making
it difficult to get a
handle of the sound.
For example, on
"Obscure Thing,"
torrents of noise
spew forth from the
guitars, sending the
listeners into heart
attack-inducing
convulsions. Then,
stereo feedback
samples along with
obnoxious drums
simply pulverize the
soft and barely de
tectable vocals. Alas,
other punk bands
such as the Suicidal
Tendencies are
harder technically,
but at least you can

ascribc some meaning to their songs. On
"Trailer," it just seems as if Ash found six
drunk kids on the street, gave them guitars
and said, "Let's see you jam!"
Ash's jarring instrumental aside, Tim
Wheeler does have noteworthy vocals. Most
of the time, Wheeler's vocals are deft and
subtle. Yet, at other times, he comes out with
loud, futile exhortations which combine
with the deafening instrumentals to create
one huge headache.
On "Uncle Pat," a Live 105 favorite, the
guitars slow down just enough to let Wheel
er's charming vocals and contemplative lyrics
shine. This single, undoubtedly the best song
on the album, evokes a feeling of nostalgia
and rolling rock highly reminiscent of Oasis'
"Live Forever" album.
With the exception of this rare gem, all the
other songs fall flat on their faces. Even
though Wheeler's vocals have a nice touch,
you would be lucky if the vocals, much less
the lyrics, are perceptible amid the clashing
guitars and drums.
On the inside cover, there's a black and
white picture of a baby crying. No surprise
there — I was crying when I heard Ash too.
But they weren't tears of joy; they were tears
of pain.
