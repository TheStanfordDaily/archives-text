# DEBORAH COX
## 
### 
Wrangling with the woefully competitive
R&B female chartmakers is the freshman dy
namo Deborah Cox, a potential maharani in
a world populated by smashing success sto
ries Whitney Houston, Toni Braxton and
Mariah Carey. A woman of considerable piz
za// and impressive versatility, Cox's star
tling smile and charismatic vocal abilities
make her formula for success beautifully un
complicated. Supported by executive pro
ducer ('live Davis, a legendary talent scout
and label powerman with a reputation for
developing champions, the destiny of Debo
rah Cox may be quite promising.
In a testament to the benefits of diversifi
cation, the self-titled debut straddles the re
gions of dance, pop and hip-hop to create a
R&B powerhouse album — one that defies
syrupy continuity with impressive and un

forced genre shifts. With beats fueled by sea
soned labrats Dallas Austin, Babyface and
Daryl Simmons, Cox has plenty of beefy in
strumental terrain to glide over. The album's
biggest talk is "Sentimental," a splashy and
memorable sing-along founded on a whole
some bass line and a get-down attitude — a
well-crafted introduction to a solid showcase
of Cox's vocal talent.
The rest ofthe album is all Deborah,as the
take-charge vocal personality caresses each
track with übiquitous charm and limitless
tact, a tour-de-force of individual display.
Perhaps the only sag factor ofthe album is the
overused lyrical themes that pervade —
sulky ballad lyrics and agonizingly stale
male-praising can only be expected, yet must
be swallowed in light of some rosier musical
aspects. "I'm Your Natural Woman" is one
such episode of restraint. The song has beau
tiful elements of gospel and a savvy chorus.
"It Could've Been You" opens .he pane! to a
hip-hop style, creaming headphones with an
urban hip-hop cool and a refreshing effect.
Perhaps the brashest flash of sass appears on
"Who Do U Love," a dance mix that quakes
the floor with cocky piano and a cadre of
dance essentials.
Entering the Billboard charts at No. 105
and slowly sinking, Deborah Cox may not get
