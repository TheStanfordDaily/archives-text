# The 						Gold Experience
## 
### 
Calling Prince's musical development dif
ficult to understand would be a severe under
statement. After starting with fairly conven
tional R&B, Prince gradually progressed to
" 1c)99"l c )99" and "Purple Rain." Both albums were
brilliant examples of Prince's unique vision, a
startling combination of the eclecticism of
I lendrix and the elegance and grit of Brown.
However, after scaling those Herculean
heights, Prince began to deconstruct his own
myth. "Parade" and "Lovesexy" were
painfully difficult experiments in pop mysti
cism. "The Black Album" was little more
than remarkably prescient gangsta rap, and
"Diamonds and Pearls" was something no
one ever expected from him, a formulaic
Prince album.
Only "Sign O' the Times" and "Batman"
approached the musical level of the first half
of his career, though both suffered from in
consistent songwriting.
And then he changed his name to a sym
bol. ...
"The Gold Experience" is Prince's first
truly new album since the name change, and
as the album tells us, "Prince esta muerte."
His music, however, has not changed all that
much.
As usual, Prince tries to do it all. "P Con
trol," "Endorphinmachine" and "Now" are
exercises in contemporary rap, but done ex
tremely well. On "Now," in particular, Prince
reasserts his life-long control of organic
rhythm.
The R&B numbers, such as "Shhh," "Shy"
and"I Hate You," mix beauty and grit, but
produce only mixed results. "The Most Beau-

tiful (iirl in the World"
is an almost unbearably
silly piece of trash pop.
As could be ex
pected, the album's best
tracks are more difficult
to categorize. "We
March" is a fecund mix
of techno, funk and
soul, one which makes
no concessions while
mixing genres. The
album's best track,
"319," is a brilliant
rocker which finds
Prince in complete con
trol of his ambitions.
The song's rhythm,
propelled by an irre
sistible guitar riff, mes
merizes as it thrusts the
listener into Princes
world.
Prince's world,
however, has become
increasingly shaky
ground. The album
closes with "Gold," an
embarrassing attempt
to create an ending sim
ilar to the majesty of

"Purple Rain." Instead, the track's childish
melody and forced emoting leave the listener
doubting that Prince really believes what he is
saying.
Unfortunately for Prince, when one
changes styles as often as he does, integrity
should not be an issue.
