# SUNNY DAY REAL
## ESTATE 
### 
It's a shame that indie rock authenticity is
often measured by its ability to disappoint.
Adjectives like "challenging" or "difficult"
carry positive connotations, recalling jaded
indie rockers eager to win over that ever
shrinking anti-commercial demographic
with every untuneful riff, every catchless
punch. Sunny Day Real Kstate's untitled sec
ond full length I P offers little in the way of
appeal, reassuring the snobby critics who
decry major label bands like Bush, Silverchair
and Stone Temple Pilots that there are still
some acts who know how not to please.
l ast year's "Diary" was much better, pair
ing Sunny Day Real I state's characteristic
melancholy with some uplifting strains of
pure melody. The new album offers the same
brooding guitars, strained, minor chords,
but the moments of naked, toe-tapping posi
tivity are fewer and farther between. While
the thrill of the band's music is its ability to
lift us out of our own ruts, these latest songs
seem to simply bury our heads down in
them.
Part of the problem is Jeremy Enigk's
high-pitched croak. Enigk's vocals load the
tunes with a half asphyxiated desperation, an
original but nonetheless annoying brand of
agitated dejection. The songs are almost un
relentingly uncomfortable and dishearten
ing, with each rare melodic moment coming
like a ray of choked sunlight between thick
ening clouds.
Songs like "Theo B," with its promising

jingly verses, and "Waffle," with its perfectly
lightweight arpeggios, become, against all
odds, pop songs. It's this tendency — which
made "Diary" so good — that Sunny Day
Real ( state's newest effort seems to have side
stepped at nearly every opportunity. There is,
however, something delicate about the
band's bleak and inharmonious instincts.
"Red Elephant" and especially "8" skirt
blandness with a carefully deft hand. While
you won't hum either in the shower, each fea
tures a reassuring attentiveness; it's elegantly
unappealing stuff.
Lyrically, 1 nigk seems content to remain
inscrutable. Every word strings out reverent
ly, like enigmatically chanted mantras. After
40 minutes of this stuff, one wonders whether
suggestive incomprehensibility solves the
problem of not having anything interesting
to say. Overall, it's a chilly listen, a bruising
lesson in restraint, a musical version of a
drowsy, impersonal smirk.
