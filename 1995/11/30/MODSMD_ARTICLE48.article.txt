## All We Got Iz Us 
### 
With grit-laced intelligence and uncanny
multimedia appeal, Onyx have grabbed the
limelight to continue a tradition of merciless
verbal assault. Their latest effort, "All We Ciot
1/ Us," teeters on the brink of desperate sui
cide, breathes with point-blank persuasion
and destroys the notion that anything within
city limits can be considered rosy. With
clenched lists and furious mugs, Onyx have
done little to water down their terror-forged
approach, much less cater to ideas of relax
ation. As their youth as a group has brought
Onyx accusations of image-building and ex
cess commercialism, "All We Ciot 1/ Us" is a

trust-bitten retaliation aimed at rap's doltish
sideliners and hallow commentators.
Sending the first wave of recognition to
denizens of the U.S.G. (United States Cihet
to), "All We Got Iz Us" is a chance for Onyx to
establish their origins, a place of gut
wrapped survivalism and limited charm. In
an ulcer-rocked introduction, "Life or
I )eath," the rap trio depicts the forced suicide
of a youngster, a blatant door opening to the
group's brand of bloody mind slamming. As
the corpse train irks forward, the tracks re
veal a lifestyle of do-or-die. "It's life on the
edge of dangerous / where you're livin' never
giving a shit / 'cuz we're livin' in it," pro
claims "1 ast Dayz," a song of potent rhythm
and macabre gospel sampling.
Cutting against the grain of rap's leading
loggerheads is "Live Niguz," a track that dis
plays beautiful originality but questionable
methodology. In an unregulated debauchery
that borders on balderdash, the track is a vi
sion in chaos, tamed only by the charisma of
Onyx's front threesome. With a street party at
titude and angst-driven delivery, "live Niguz"
may be a winner more for its oxymoronic ten
dency than its musical character: "When
you're maxin' and relaxin' / that's when they
start attacking... forget the facts of life there's
no compassion / keep the heat 'cuz nowadays
the shit's cold as the Alaskan." With a carous
ing background, the lyrical theme is a hit in
congruous, yet deliriously enjoyable.
With a searing testament to collective sur
vivalism, "All We Got Iz Us" may not be the
sophomore slump that Onyx's competition
had hoped for. Despite recent label shifts and
membership problems (the trio used to be a
quartet), the album is doing more than most
naysayers had predicted. In a rap world of
painfully brief life expectancies, Onyx is not
only surviving — they have successfully
crafted a niche of lasting potential.
