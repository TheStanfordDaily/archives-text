# After retreat, a new vision
## Med school profs release outlook for next century 
### Adrian Keatinge-Clay 
Aiming to create a bright out
look for the Stanford Medical
School in the 21 st century, a group
of senior faculty and staff have re
leased a vision statement for the
school produced at a retreat held
earlier this month.
The statement, published in
this week's Stanford Report, cen
ters around five key goals: main
taining Stanford's superior med
ical education, biomedical research
and clinical care; attracting the
best faculty; creating unequaled
educational opportunities for stu
dents; reflecting the "richness" of
American society in the Medical
School's community; and integrat
ing other departments with the
Medical School.
The statement also suggests

that because of limited resources,
the school may in coming years
have to "eliminate redundancies in
administration" and decrease its
numbers of professors and stu
dents.
The Medical School recently an
nounced that it would merge pa
tient care programs with UC-San
Francisco in an effort to decrease
overlaps in education and cut
costs.
At the retreat, faculty members
discussed ways to keep the Medical
School at the forefront of research
and teaching in a time of some fi
nancial uncertainty.
Richard Popp, senior associate
dean for academic affairs, said "the
retreat focused on ways of keeping
the elevated status of Stanford's
Medical School, making sure that it
is not constrained bv financial wor

ries in the future.
"To date, Stanford's Medical
School is at the forefront of re
search, and has been extremely suc
cessful at getting patients," Popp
said. "In times of financial distress
for medical schools across the na
tion, the Stanford School of Medi
cine has remained relatively unaf
fected."
Despite the current strains on
academic medical schools national
ly, Popp sees no reason to worry for
the time being. "The Stanford
School of Medicine's faculty is ter
rific — among the best in the coun
try — and that is the reason why
the Medical School has so many
spectacular students. If the same
quality of faculty can be main
tained, Stanford School of Medi
cine's reputation will last well into
the future."
But Stanford Health Services
President and CEO Peter Van
Etten said finances have had an
effect on the Medical School, evi
denced by "a significant reduction
in clinical activities" which "the
Medical School is dependent
upon."
Van Etten, who spoke at the

retreat about the need to support
research and teaching, said that in
the future, the school also has to be
concerned about finding ways to
make research more applicable to
care for patients and determining
the position of clinicians in the fac
ulty.
James Spudich, chair of bio
chemistry at the Medical School,
said many of the faculty members
left the retreat "optimistic and
excited about the Medical School's
future."
He also said that the new dean
of the Medical School, Eugene

Bauer, and Provost Condoleezza
Rice displayed a "cooperation and
interaction" during the retreat
which was "greatly appreciated by
all members of the faculty and seen
as a good foundation for the
future."
After the retreat, a steering
committee consisting of 10 mem
bers and devoted to the ideals of
the school's new stated vision was
set up by Bauer to guide the Medi
cal School into the 21st century.
They will meet for the first time in
January to try to begin turning the
vision into a reality.
