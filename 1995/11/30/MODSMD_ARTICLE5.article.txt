## Med school profs release outlook for next century 
### Adrian Keatinge-Clay 
Aiming to create a bright out
look for the Stanford Medical
School in the 21 st century, a group
of senior faculty and staff have re

school produced at a retreat held
earlier this month.
The statement, published in
this week's Stanford Report, cen

is not constrained bv financial wor

"To date, Stanford's Medical
School is at the forefront of re
search, and has been extremely suc
cessful at getting patients," Popp
said. "In times of financial distress
for medical schools across the na

fected."
Despite the current strains on
academic medical schools national
ly, Popp sees no reason to worry for
the time being. "The Stanford
School of Medicine's faculty is ter
rific — among the best in the coun
try — and that is the reason why
the Medical School has so many
spectacular students. If the same
quality of faculty can be main
