# Money Train

Wesley and

brothers? The trash-talking, cocky duo is
hack, this time .is foster brothers working as
transit cops in the New York City subway. 1 )i
rected by Joe Ruben, "Money Train" is an un
orthodox action comedy that focuses on the
relationship between the brothers. Without a
bad-guy type out to conquer the world or
terrorize millions, "Money Train" departs
from the traditional formula and delivers an
entertaining and mildly engrossing story
that — though poorly scripted — offers a
fresh take on the action genre.
Harrelson revisits his "loser" character
from "White Men Can't lump" — Charlie is
a compulsive gambler and a strikeout with
women looking for stability. Snipes plays his
wiser brother John who bails him out consis
tently but is put to the test when C Charlie loses
the $10,000 |ohn gave him to repay a gam
bling debt. Hnter Grace Santiago (Jennifer
Lopez, "Mi lamilia"), a beautiful new decoy
cop who joins the team. John, torn between
an almost certain romance with Grace and
his loyalty to his brother (who's also in love
with her), ultimately ends up bedding her
despite his reluctance. This, coupled with an

increasing realization ol his own irresponsi
bility, drives Charlie to consider actually
bringing to reality the fantasy ol every sub
way cop: robbing the Money Train. The train
carries the daily revenue of the subway sys
tem for deposit in the federal Reserves and is
protected by a host of transit cops. As an in
sider, however, Charlie knows the ins and
outs of the process and only his brother can
stop him.
The dialogue of "Money Train" is its
weakest point, as it the writer had transplant
ed it verbatim from "White Men Can't
lump," and though it worked on the courts of
Venice and Watts, it is out of place under the
streets of New York. The story, particularly
the interplay between the brothers (though
dangerously bordering on the cheesy at
times), redeems the film, however. The ac
tion scenes, played up in trailers, actually
only show up at the very end of the movie
and look suspiciously like the subway finale
in "Speed."
A weak ending — emphasized by a ridicu
lous scene with Lopez, and MTA chief Donald
Patterson (Robert Blake, the closest thing to
a real bad guy) — slightly takes away from
the plot, but while not great, "Money Train"
is still charming in its uniqueness.

the film). The star is Stanford Drama Prof.
Anna Deavere Smith, who has a substantial
role as Shepherd's press secretary.
These Farm sightings aren't the most im
portant part of Reiner's film. Unfortunately,
they may be the most exciting. Not that "The
American President' is a bad film; in fact, it is
a pleasant movie. It simply never quite lives
up to its potential, which is too had, because
it is graced with a good comedic premise and
a wonderful cast.
I he basic plot is that President Shepherd,
a widower, gels the urge to start dating just as
his campaign for a second term heats up. The
object of his affections is Sydney Kllen Wade
(a frumpy-looking Annette Boning) — a lob
byist hired to push a big environmental bill
through (Congress. The problems in this rela
tionship are obvious, so 1 won't explain them
other than to say that the coupling is espe
cially criticized by a Republican presidential
front-runner and senator from Kansas
named Hob (Rumson, not Dole, played by a
bland Richard Dreyfuss).
If the reference to I >ole seems a little obvi
ous, that's because it is. Indeed, the movie is
filled with thinly veiled political allusions and
Beltway in-jokes: Many journalists have

pointed out that the Shepherd White House
shares a striking number of characteristics
with the Clinton White House. These jokes
manage to be simultaneously heavy-handed
and trite, and quickly wear on the audience.
Director (and producer) Reiner should
have pared this detritus away, because it dis
tracts from what is at heart a pleasant, ro
mantic comedy of manners about the Wash
ington set. From charming scenes about dat
ing at state dinners to the smallest comedy
bits (the president's daughter hates social
studies), Reiner and scriptwriter Aaron
Sorkin are at their best when they gently
mock the conventions of executive life and
customs instead of specific political figures or
issues.
If Reiner had concentrated on manners,
he could have fulfilled the potential ot the
concept and the cast (the latter of which is
universally solid, although only Michael I.
Fox truly excels as Shepherd's domestic ad
viser, a role in which he is strangely brilliant).
As it is, however, Reiner clutters his script
with Beltway traffic and the movie's perfor
mance falls short, like a Dodge Viper stuck in
second gear.

lump," and though it worked on the courts of
Venice and Watts, it is out of place under the
streets of New York. The story, particularly
the interplay between the brothers (though
dangerously bordering on the cheesy at
times), redeems the film, however. The ac
tion scenes, played up in trailers, actually
only show up at the very end of the movie
and look suspiciously like the subway finale
in "Speed."
A weak ending — emphasized by a ridicu
lous scene with Lopez, and MTA chief Donald
Patterson (Robert Blake, the closest thing to
a real bad guy) — slightly takes away from
the plot, but while not great, "Money Train"
is still charming in its uniqueness.

the film). The star is Stanford Drama Prof.
Anna Deavere Smith, who has a substantial
role as Shepherd's press secretary.
These Farm sightings aren't the most im
portant part of Reiner's film. Unfortunately,
they may be the most exciting. Not that "The
American President' is a bad film; in fact, it is
a pleasant movie. It simply never quite lives
up to its potential, which is too had, because
it is graced with a good comedic premise and
a wonderful cast.
I he basic plot is that President Shepherd,
a widower, gels the urge to start dating just as
his campaign for a second term heats up. The
object of his affections is Sydney Kllen Wade
(a frumpy-looking Annette Boning) — a lob
byist hired to push a big environmental bill
through (Congress. The problems in this rela
tionship are obvious, so 1 won't explain them
other than to say that the coupling is espe
cially criticized by a Republican presidential
front-runner and senator from Kansas
named Hob (Rumson, not Dole, played by a
bland Richard Dreyfuss).
If the reference to I >ole seems a little obvi
ous, that's because it is. Indeed, the movie is
filled with thinly veiled political allusions and
Beltway in-jokes: Many journalists have

pointed out that the Shepherd White House
shares a striking number of characteristics
with the Clinton White House. These jokes
manage to be simultaneously heavy-handed
and trite, and quickly wear on the audience.
Director (and producer) Reiner should
have pared this detritus away, because it dis
tracts from what is at heart a pleasant, ro
mantic comedy of manners about the Wash
ington set. From charming scenes about dat
ing at state dinners to the smallest comedy
bits (the president's daughter hates social
studies), Reiner and scriptwriter Aaron
Sorkin are at their best when they gently
mock the conventions of executive life and
customs instead of specific political figures or
issues.
If Reiner had concentrated on manners,
he could have fulfilled the potential ot the
concept and the cast (the latter of which is
universally solid, although only Michael I.
Fox truly excels as Shepherd's domestic ad
viser, a role in which he is strangely brilliant).
As it is, however, Reiner clutters his script
with Beltway traffic and the movie's perfor
mance falls short, like a Dodge Viper stuck in
second gear.
