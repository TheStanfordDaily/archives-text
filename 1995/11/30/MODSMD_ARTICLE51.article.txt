* If "The
Crossing

C iuard" were a simple story of loss and revenge,
you'd walk away within the first few minutes.
But Sean Perm's second directorial effort hits
viewers with deadly accuracy, until we are
piled up in the middle of the intersection won
dering what hit us. Jack Nicholson's Freddy
Gale and David Morse's ("St. Elsewhere") John
Booth have been fatally linked since the day six
years ago when a drinking-and-driving John
took the life of Freddy's beloved daughter.
Freddy's life takes a spiral down a path that
leads straight to a strip bar where he spends
time with obnoxious buddies who get their
kicks from the same cheap thrills. He fills his
empty life and emptier nights with strippers
with hearts of gold, one of whom even sere
nades him. Musical talents aside, there is not
much here for him to hold onto. He's a man
biding his time until the day John is released
from prison, a date he sees first thing every
morning on his calendar blocked out in red.
Jack's back and better than ever. Sliding
into a pattern of bitterness and revenge,
Nicholson displays his trademark angry rage,
but he is able to go beyond his usual repertoire
and make tangible the loss of a lifetime. Penn

captures fleeting glimpses of the man he once
was, the uncharacteristic smile unfamiliar on
his worn face, the hint of vulnerability that
breaks free in a cathartic moment after a
nightmare. Scenes with Anjelica Huston's
Mary as his ex-wife bring out these conflicting
sides to full effect. Morse's John crucifies him
self, guilt-ridden and resigned to death and
forgiveness / redemption for his crime. He sits
there, waiting for Freddy to come to him, even
disappointed he doesn't come sooner.
Morse seems a normal man caught up in
horrific circumstances, eaten away by guilt as
his physique exudes incredible strength. His
demeanor is that of a gentle giant, enhanced by
his soft-spoken words that strike truth with the
sharpest of points. There is an innate sense of
calmness, stability and normality gone incon
ceivably wrong by one night of recklessness.
Throughout the film, it is Perm's superior
directing that brings the rough edges of each
character together. He places each man one
step closer to that intersection where the two
will collide. Despite the overt sentimentality
that goes into the ending, it still succeeds in
its mesmerizing characterizations of lives in
limbo. Be grateful Penn is now behind a cam
era instead of punching it out, so that we may
see more productive collisions in the future.
