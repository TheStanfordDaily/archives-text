## Toy Story 
### 
loy Story is that rare
children's movie that
adults will also love tor

two reasons: It's total eye-candy and it's twisted.
The story centers around the bedroom of
a boy named Andy (who is, incidentally,
being raised by a single mother) and the
miniature society his toys create when he's
not around. The toys act like a community of
adults, and there is a good deal of humor that
kids won't understand unless they're really
cool. Many of the toys are concerned about
their status and fear outsiders, yet all owe al
legiance to a social order where the goal is
keeping Andy happy.
Woody the pull-string cowboy is the fa
vorite toy and accepted leader of the group.
Tom Hanks is typically excellent doing the

voice-over for Woody as he runs town meet
ings and soothes the egos of insecure toys.
Tim Allen, who normally annoys me, is
perfect as Buzz Lightyear, the new toy who ar
rives on Andy's birthday. The role is a good
takeoff on Allen's macho-toolguy shtick, such
as when he endeavors to fix his cardboard
spaceship with "monodirectional bonding
material" (tape). Buzz truly thinks he is a space
ranger stuck on a distant planet — until he has
his existential, made-in Taiwan moment, in a
scene oddly reminiscent of Blade Runner.
Buzz replaces Woody as top toy, and
Woody's plot to get rid of him lands them
both in the outside world. The travails bring
them among the religious three-eyed toys
within a claw prize game, who will not let
Woody and Buzi escape the clutches of evil
neighbor boy Sid because, "The claw chooses

who will leave and who will stay.... Nirvana
is coming, the mystic portal awaits."
At Sid's house, they are surrounded by mu
tant toys created by their malevolent owner.
Woody, however, uses his motivational skills to
organize them into a rebellion that recalls the
revenge sequence of the cult movie "Freaks."
The supporting cast is good, especially Mr.
Potato Head (Don Rickles) as he longs for a
Mrs. Potato Head and Rex (Wallace Shawn)
as a neurotic plastic dinosaur. But the real star
is the animation. While none of the humans
look quite right, the toys are often very close,
down to the rivets and ridges in Buzz's plastic
space suit. They move awkwardly but con
vincingly through what seems like real space.
Some of the backgrounds — especially the
outdoor scenes — achieve a level of photo
graphic realism that is almost disturbing.

The film is a collaboration of Disney and
Pixar, "the world's first computer animation
studio" and the latest baby of Apple Comput
ers co-founder Steven Jobs. The animation
was so complicated it took four years to com
plete. This turned out to be a boon for Pixar
and for the film. Because the voice-overs were
recorded in 1993, before Hanks won two Os
cars and Allen hit it big with "Home Improve
ment," they got both stars at prices tar below
their current asking price. The animation
costs also led Pixar to produce a 77 minute
long film, and thus lacking the extra minutes
of fluff in many animated children's films.
The down side of this is that it may be a
while before we get another production from
Pixar, but if you only see two children's
movies this year, see this twice.
