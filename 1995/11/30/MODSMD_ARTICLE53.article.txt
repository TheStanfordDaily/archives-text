# Reckless
## 
### 
Christmas is not a good
holiday for Mia Farrow's
Rachel, or anyone who

comes into contact with her. In fact, it's cata
strophe. One Christmas Eve, her husband
tells her that he's taken out a contract on her
life, and in remorse, he opens the window
and tells her to go before it's too late. Down
she plummets into one surreal experience
after another, measured Christmas to (Christ
mas for 15 years.
After awhile, however, the snowball effect
turns into an avalanche of sloppy direction
and quirkiness given free rein over an other
wise interesting premise. In a film about leav
ing and being left, it leaves the viewer con
fused while it allows its characters to assume
new identities.
"Reckless" is a holiday fable from hell. It
shows us the world inside a glass dome that
has been shaken and emptied so that all that
remain are the wet and fake flakes covering
up the little plastic house. Everything about
this film smacks of looking down upon a
make-believe set landscape, town, cars and
homes. It plows the viewer with trippy im
agery and unforeseen violence at the same

time it plies the symbols of Christmas as tools
ot a woman cut off from reality.
Credit must be given to Farrow for creat
ing a thoroughly clueless, chameleon like
and ultimately endearing character prone to
babbling marathons and inadvertently funny
observations. It is Farrow who gives the film
some redemption, although there are strong
performances from Mary-Louise Parker's
paraplegic Pooty and Scott ( ilenn's reformed
family abandoner Lloyd. Life is strangely
ideal, until the ('.hristmas curse rolls around.
After this particularly repulsive Christmas
leaves behind a trail of blood and puke, the
film follows in kind, losing direction and
spewing random acts of nonsense. Rachel's
lite shatters, as it must, and she falls silent for
years before the revelation hits, why life has
been so reckless to her.
If only this film were not so reckless with
the tactics it uses to make this point. There is
too much fluff flying around from the fake
world that has been created, so that it ob
scures the deep emotional losses that Rachel
has suffered. The viewer is left bearing the
burden of sifting through too many messy
layers. This film is best left in the cold.
