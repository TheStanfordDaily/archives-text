After a six
year hiatus,
007 returns

to the silver screen with a bang.
In "Golden Eye," Pierce Brosnan becomes
the filth actor to portray debonair British se
cret agent James Bond, and the casting de
partment couldn't have done a better job.
After the brooding and moody Timothy 1 )al
ton, Brosnan breathes some much-needed life
into the role, drawing comparisons with Sean
Connery's original. In short, he's perfect.
The 18th installation in the 007 series pits
Bond against renegade agent 006 (Sean Bean),
who steals a top-secret Russian weapon capa
ble ot destroying all electronic devices within
30 miles of its target. Aided by a gorgeous
computer programmer (Izabella Scorupco),
Bond must deal with crooked Russian gener
als, the St. Petersburg Mafia and female assas
sin Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen).
The opening action sequence,a Bond trade
mark, is absolutely amazing, combining two
stunts that nearly break the audience's suspen
sion of disbelief. From that point on, it's a head
long dive into one thrilling scene after another
to the next in a (X) 7 film that moves a little faster
than most of its predecessors.

The old school Bond resurfaces in "Gold
en Eye," but 007's world has definitely
changed. A female M (Judi Dench) tells him
he's "a sexist, misogynist dinosaur" and sends
a psychiatrist to evaluate him. And while
Brosnan's character may be less moody than
Dalton's, we still learn that Bond was an or
phan and see him seated alone on a beach
mulling over his friend's betrayal.
Bean's vengeful turncoat may pale in com
parison to past Bond villains, but the flashy
Janssen is fabulous as Bond's sado-masochistic
adversary. Onatopp crushes men to death dur
ing sex with her legs, nearly reaches orgasm after
mowing down a groupof people with a machine
gun and grins with obvious pleasure as she
braces herself for a head-on collision with a tank.
Too bad that Bond has to kill her at the end.
Amid the tank chases and explosions, a few
other touches are particularly enjoyable.
Bond's CIA contact insists upon calling the
British agent "Jimbo." Bond tries to steal Q's
lunch. And General Ouremov, with Bond hot
on his heels, takes a few drags out of a flask of
vodka to calm his nerves.
"Golden Eye" has it all: stunning locales,
beautiful babes and great gadgets. Bond fans
won't want to miss his triumphant return.
