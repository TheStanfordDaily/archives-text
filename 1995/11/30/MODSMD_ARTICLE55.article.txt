# Casino

### 
Let's just conic
right out and say it —
Robert DeNiro is

amazing. Outside of his performance, how
ever, "Casino" leaves something to be de
sired. Martin Scorsese's follow-up to "Good
fellas" is, should we say, "noGoodfellas."
The plot of this movie twists around (and
around, for three hours) the lives of Ace
(DeNiro), the honest lew, Nicky (Pesci), the
very dishonest mobster, and Ginger (Stone),
the beautiful and confused alcoholic. Ace and
Nicky go way back and this fact becomes the
problem when they leave their home, the East
Coast, for the glitter and money of Lis Vegas.
Ace is protected by Nicky's mob ties and Nicky
needs Ace to maintain his reputation by look
ing clean around town. However, Nicky's in
tense propensity for violence soon turns into
trouble for Ace. At about this time, Ace marries
C linger and his life really begins to unravel.
The first hour of the film is great
smooth, necessary, interesting. However,
after the stage is set, the plot begins to wind
away from the most interesting points. The
scenes of individual killings (creative, I must
say) multiply and the number of times Gin

ger leaves Ace and returns becomes uncount
able. You begin to feel as if you're stuck in a
line of traffic, the end of which isn't in sight.
The movie does have its strengths, howev
er. The cinematography, especially at the be
ginning, has the cameras almost smearing
across the scenes of bright-colored casinos.
The aesthetics of the movie are unbeatable —
DcNiro in every color from fuchsia to mint
green to Mylanta (yes, Mylanta, right down
to his boxers and knee socks). And Stone her
self is an aesthetic plus — even if balanced on
the other side by the sound of Pesci's voice
next to DeNiro's — a kazoo in an orchestra.
Ginger's weakness for Lester (James
Woods) is mainly unexplored, one of the
larger gaps in the movie. Another is the
somewhat late and little development of the
relationship between Ace and Nicky. These
gaps are filled by scene after scene of vio
lence. The violence is overdone, if not just
plain taxing, and this excess detracts from
time that could be spent on aspects of the
mob that are more, say, intriguing.
While the film's cast and costumes are in
credible, one is still left with the feeling that this
is a case of a mediocre script that has fallen into
some very talented and experienced hands.
