# Nick of Time

### 
In "Nick of Time,'
accountant Cienc
Watson (Johnny
Depp) steps off the

12 o'clock train and into his worst nightmare.
Watson's six-year-old daughter is smug
gled away by two strangers, Mr. Smith and
Ms. Jones (Christopher Walken and Roma

Maffia). He is given a gun
and an ultimatum: Kill
the liberal incumbent
governor (Marsha
Mason) by 1:30 p.m. or
his daughter dies. Over
the next 90 minutes,
Watson's courage and
wits are tested as he at
tempts to escape from
the plot even as his every
move is watched over by
the ruthless Mr. Smith.
Director-producer
John Bad ham ("War
Games," "Dracula")
shoots the film in real
time: The movie's length
coincides with the time
span for the events in the
film. It's an interesting

concept (and a difficult
one lor a director to put together) that results
in a suspenseful action-thriller. I could actu
ally feel as it I was the beleaguered Watson,
traveling along with him every step of the
way.
However, while "Nick of Time" manages
to entertain, it falls well short of some other
recent films of the same genre ("Money
Train," "Goldeneye"). Depp's entrance into

the action-film arena is not nearly as success
ful as Keanu Reeves', who starred in last year's
blockbuster "Speed." Depp's ability to devel
op the Watson character is constrained by the
movie's time frame and the hurly-burly
movement of events. I was left with the feel
ing that any actor could have played the role.
Walken, as usual, is excellent as the pitbull
of the conspirators. I he anger and determi
nation his character exudes are palpable. As
the movie progresses and the depth of the
conspiracy is revealed, however, I was left
wondering jlist why a group with so many re
sources at its disposal would rely on a random
stranger like Watson to accomplish its goals.
This plot flaw is rendered nearly unnotice
able by the quick pace of the film. The viewer
may also become so swept up in the action that
he barely notices the pages ripped out of other
movies. Some of the sequences are reminis
cent of "Die I lard" and "North by Northwest."
As the minutes slip away, Watson enlists
the aid of a nearly-deaf shoeshine man
(played well by an under-utilized Charles S.
Dutton) and a cohort of hotel employees. As
Watson assembles his little army, I wondered
if Badham was trying to make a political
statement — a single parent, an African
American and a few Latinos attempt to
thwart the assassination of a liberal female
politician by a group of white men — but it

was probably incidental (or so 1 hope).
Overall, "Nick of Time" isa decent film and
worth seeing simply because of its unique
time-frame and the intricacies such an ap
proach necessitates. 1 lowcver, if you only have
a limited number of dollars to spend on enter
tainment these days, you'd be better off going
to see one of this fall season's other fine films.
