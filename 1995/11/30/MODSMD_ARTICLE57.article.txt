## Taylor Antrim Alanis: cultural confusion and sexual diversion 
### 
The first twenty yards of the Warfield
was a disorienting press of rakishly
low-cut necklines and carefully
bloused button-downs. Full of sullen, semi
attractive middle-aged earnestness, like an
episode ot "Friends" gone bad, the whole
mess presented an unlikely demographic for
Alanis Morissette. Someone higher up had
miscalculated as well. While Sierra Nevada
(lowed incessantly, the hip navy-trimmed
"I'm Brave But I'm Chickenshit" baby-tees
hung forlorn and undersold.
"Where were the kids?" I wanted to know.
The hallway seemed like the furtive first
minutes of a post-collegiate Republican
convention, a bland frat party waiting to
happen. Hadn't the inevitable crew of libidi
nous high-school roughnecks gotten the
word? This was Alanis Morissette. The ven
omous, foul-mouthed '90s answer to Belin
da Carlisle, the face behind this summer's
erotically impregnated "You Oughta Know."
As I looked around, as I shouldered my way
through the crowd, I guessed that the ever
present high-school slack sharks had taken
the night off. The snobbishly suggestive tour
slogan, "Intellectual Intercourse," hadn't
charged their inexhaustible sex drives. They
were probably too busy with the real thing.
Inside, amid the confounding din of the
opening act, the Rentals, more tiny-back
packed women and their sadly Eddie
Bauered dates nodded heads respectfully.

Maneuvering around the already packed,
sold-out crowd, I nearly stepped on the first
undeniably cool thing I 'd seen all night: two
1 2-year-old graveyard girls, all pale skin and
black eyeliner, obliviously twirling neon-lit
lilies. They looked abandoned by their
friends, suddenly trapped in someone else's
idea ot a good time, idly cowering away
from everything.
Outside a pissy streetwalker had thrown
a withering glance in my direction; "She
sucks," she'd said, crooking a thumb at the
theater's giant, glowing marquee.
In a way, I knew. I'd been annoyed by the
virally übiquitous "You Oughta Know" all
summer. The savage and revengeful attitude
of "Do you think of me when you fuck her?"
too quickly became the insecure whine of
someone who's no longer getting any. So
when the cocky and self-assured "Hand in
My Pocket" came out with "I feel drunk but
I'm sober / I'm young and I'm under
paid. ...," and the cool obliviousness of the
one-hand antics, I was won over. The song is
pithy pop-anthem therapy, full of sat isfyi ug
ly cheap aphorisms, exactly the thing an em
bittered oversexed ex should cling to.
Still, 1 always feel a tad vapid when 1 listen
to Alanis, like I've somehow bottomed-out
into mindless bliss. There's a delicious indul
gence to it, and 1 guess that's why the concert
seemed like such an event. I went hoping to
meet the ghost of my former middle-school

self, a simpleminded specimen of my per
sonality's lowest common denominator.
Maybe that's why I was so spooked by the
crowd.
By the time the lights went down and the
first energetic bars of Alanis' "All I Really
Want" swept across the audience, the couple
standing in front of me were well on their
way. An unending procession of four-dollar
microbrews had passed through their
hands, resulting in violently unbridled en
thusiasm. Alanis emerged from a smoky
gloom in the back of the stage, dressed in
black silk and leather, her nearly waist
length hair run through with glitter. The
song is her best, a frantic and agitated shriek
of dissatisfaction. It's more subtle than her
others, with fewer wince-inducing confes
sions, and she threw herself into it, stagger
ing across the stage, belting out the lines like
thev were sour, like she'd had to taste them
all night.
The crowd convulsed appropriately.
There was none of the life-threatening
chaos of the mosh pit, only a hyperactive
head bobbing and arm swinging. Alanis
smiled through her hair, launching each line
like an attack. She danced awkwardly with a
kind of flailing, stumbling abandon, like
she'd felt her body disappear, its limitations
dissolve. She looked like she'd made it to the
far side of self-consciousness, like the un
popular, horse-faced girl from sixth grade

made suddenly, triumphantly good.
A dutiful, if at times dogged, progression
through every song on her newest album,
"Jagged Little Pill," followed. Her back-up
band, supremely irritating glamour boy
scrubs from LA, all long hair and leather,
dragged the evening down a bit. But Alanis
managed to maintain a nicely bemused dis
tance from everything.
The audience, however, persevered in
their total lack of nonchalance. The couple
in front of me happily acted out the lyrics,
slapping high fives, flicking imaginary ciga
rettes, stumbling for a moment over the best
gesture for "hailing a taxi cab."
During the second encore I noticed two
teenaged hipsters, firmly high-school,
sucking face a little bit to my left. Alanis was
half-way through "Ironic" and most of her
aging fan base were screaming, indulging in
private moments, chanting the lyrics to
each other. The kids were totally oblivious.
It was as if they'd had their fill and had
moved on to the next thing. They were lis
tening, though: The girl's fingers tapped
out the rhythm on the boy's back; the boy
swayed slightly on his feet. They know what
it really means to bottom out, 1 thought, to
indulge in sheer dumb fun. I like to think
that Alanis somehow approved; that she
noticed everyone else boozing up, hanging
on her every word, and them just standing
there, sucking.

of "Do you think of me when you fuck her?"
too quickly became the insecure whine of
someone who's no longer getting any. So
when the cocky and self-assured "Hand in
My Pocket" came out with "I feel drunk but
I'm sober / I'm young and I'm under
paid. ...," and the cool obliviousness of the
one-hand antics, I was won over. The song is
pithy pop-anthem therapy, full of sat isfyi ug
ly cheap aphorisms, exactly the thing an em
bittered oversexed ex should cling to.
Still, 1 always feel a tad vapid when 1 listen
to Alanis, like I've somehow bottomed-out
into mindless bliss. There's a delicious indul
gence to it, and 1 guess that's why the concert
seemed like such an event. I went hoping to
meet the ghost of my former middle-school

self, a simpleminded specimen of my per
sonality's lowest common denominator.
Maybe that's why I was so spooked by the
crowd.
By the time the lights went down and the
first energetic bars of Alanis' "All I Really
Want" swept across the audience, the couple
standing in front of me were well on their
way. An unending procession of four-dollar
microbrews had passed through their
hands, resulting in violently unbridled en
thusiasm. Alanis emerged from a smoky
gloom in the back of the stage, dressed in
black silk and leather, her nearly waist
length hair run through with glitter. The
song is her best, a frantic and agitated shriek
of dissatisfaction. It's more subtle than her
others, with fewer wince-inducing confes
sions, and she threw herself into it, stagger
ing across the stage, belting out the lines like
thev were sour, like she'd had to taste them
all night.
The crowd convulsed appropriately.
There was none of the life-threatening
chaos of the mosh pit, only a hyperactive
head bobbing and arm swinging. Alanis
smiled through her hair, launching each line
like an attack. She danced awkwardly with a
kind of flailing, stumbling abandon, like
she'd felt her body disappear, its limitations
dissolve. She looked like she'd made it to the
far side of self-consciousness, like the un
popular, horse-faced girl from sixth grade

made suddenly, triumphantly good.
A dutiful, if at times dogged, progression
through every song on her newest album,
"Jagged Little Pill," followed. Her back-up
band, supremely irritating glamour boy
scrubs from LA, all long hair and leather,
dragged the evening down a bit. But Alanis
managed to maintain a nicely bemused dis
tance from everything.
The audience, however, persevered in
their total lack of nonchalance. The couple
in front of me happily acted out the lyrics,
slapping high fives, flicking imaginary ciga
rettes, stumbling for a moment over the best
gesture for "hailing a taxi cab."
During the second encore I noticed two
teenaged hipsters, firmly high-school,
sucking face a little bit to my left. Alanis was
half-way through "Ironic" and most of her
aging fan base were screaming, indulging in
private moments, chanting the lyrics to
each other. The kids were totally oblivious.
It was as if they'd had their fill and had
moved on to the next thing. They were lis
tening, though: The girl's fingers tapped
out the rhythm on the boy's back; the boy
swayed slightly on his feet. They know what
it really means to bottom out, 1 thought, to
indulge in sheer dumb fun. I like to think
that Alanis somehow approved; that she
noticed everyone else boozing up, hanging
on her every word, and them just standing
there, sucking.
The first twenty yards of the Warfield
was a disorienting press of rakishly
low-cut necklines and carefully
bloused button-downs. Full of sullen, semi
attractive middle-aged earnestness, like an
episode ot "Friends" gone bad, the whole
mess presented an unlikely demographic for
Alanis Morissette. Someone higher up had
miscalculated as well. While Sierra Nevada
(lowed incessantly, the hip navy-trimmed
"I'm Brave But I'm Chickenshit" baby-tees
hung forlorn and undersold.
"Where were the kids?" I wanted to know.
The hallway seemed like the furtive first
minutes of a post-collegiate Republican
convention, a bland frat party waiting to
happen. Hadn't the inevitable crew of libidi
nous high-school roughnecks gotten the
word? This was Alanis Morissette. The ven
omous, foul-mouthed '90s answer to Belin
da Carlisle, the face behind this summer's
erotically impregnated "You Oughta Know."
As I looked around, as I shouldered my way
through the crowd, I guessed that the ever
present high-school slack sharks had taken
the night off. The snobbishly suggestive tour
slogan, "Intellectual Intercourse," hadn't
charged their inexhaustible sex drives. They
were probably too busy with the real thing.
Inside, amid the confounding din of the
opening act, the Rentals, more tiny-back
packed women and their sadly Eddie
Bauered dates nodded heads respectfully.

Maneuvering around the already packed,
sold-out crowd, I nearly stepped on the first
undeniably cool thing I 'd seen all night: two
1 2-year-old graveyard girls, all pale skin and
black eyeliner, obliviously twirling neon-lit
lilies. They looked abandoned by their
friends, suddenly trapped in someone else's
idea ot a good time, idly cowering away
from everything.
Outside a pissy streetwalker had thrown
a withering glance in my direction; "She
sucks," she'd said, crooking a thumb at the
theater's giant, glowing marquee.
In a way, I knew. I'd been annoyed by the
virally übiquitous "You Oughta Know" all
summer. The savage and revengeful attitude
of "Do you think of me when you fuck her?"
too quickly became the insecure whine of
someone who's no longer getting any. So

I'm sober / I'm young and I'm under
