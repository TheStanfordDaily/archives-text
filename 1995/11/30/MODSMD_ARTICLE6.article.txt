## Cancer can't stop Gaieties star 
### Kristina Batiste 
A year ago, Anne Cunha was in a wheelchair, un
able to walk on her own strength and suffering from
Hodgkin's lymphoma — a cancer that attacks the
lymphatic system. Two weeks ago, she was singing
and dancing on stage as "KaNdeE*, the Ninja Dollie
star of Big Game Gaieties.
Cunha was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma
in February 1994, her freshman year at Princeton
University. She had what she thought was a swollen
gland, the type associated with colds, when a nurse at
the University Clinic told her otherwise: Cunha had a
relatively common form of cancer that is easily — and
usually successfully — treated with six months of
chemotherapy.
Cunha traveled across the country to her home
town of Sacramento for the routine treatment. She
expected to complete the treatment and recover in
time to be back at Princeton for her sophomore year.

During treatment she experienced significant pain
accompanied by extreme weight loss and night
sweat, but a determination to continue her educa
tion led her to take summer school classes while on
chemotherapy.
Unfortunately, the treatment didn't work.
"In 99 percent of the cases, the chemo works. I
guess I was in the 1 percent that it doesn't," Cunha
said. "I just really wanted to get back to Princeton as
quickly as possible."
Instead, Cunha faced the daunting prospect of a
bone marrow transplant. This could not be done at
her local hospital, so last November, Cunha made the
trip to the Stanford Medical Center.
There, before even having the chance to recover
from the initial six months of chemotherapy, she un
derwent an experimental new treatment that actual
ly used her own bone marrow to effect a cure. Cunha
was subjected to intense radiation
treatments that prompted her
bone marrow to "rejuvenate"
itself.
After that the painful 12-week
procedure the cancer went into
remission. In May, Cunha under
went a mild radiation treatment
to ensure that the cancer would
not come back. It has been in
remission since June.
Recovery period for Cunha's
treatment is estimated at one
year. But while she was still under
observation at the Medical Cen
ter. the ever-ambitious Cunha
decided to take some classes at
Stanford this quarter.
"My intention was to take a
few art classes and then go back to
Princeton in the winter. But I like
it so much here that I'm applying
for transfer," she said.
Not only did she decide to take
some art classes, she auditioned

for the annual Big Game Gaieties,
despite the fact that she knew
participating would tax her
strength.
"I put down on my application
that I couldn't rehearse after 10
p.m., I needed so much sleep,"
said Cunha. Nevertheless, she
auditioned and received the lead
role in the musical.
After she got the part, she still
had some concerns. "I had a lot of
anxiety about whether or not I'd
be able to do all of the dances and
songs, because my lungs were
damaged by the chemotherapy.
Breathing was really hard, and I
was still spending a lot of time in
the hospital."
But, according to her director
and choreographer, she had no
trouble at all keeping up with her
role.
"I didn't even know about her
condition until late in the produc
tion. Her dedication, enthusiasm
and performance were always
above and beyond what would be
expected of any student, despite
any health problems she may or

may not have had. She was an
integral part of the program,
always at 100 percent during
rehearsals and performances,"
said Sarah Farley, Gaieties chore
ographer.
"Every single encounter with
her was extremely positive and
professional. She always had all of
her work done. It was her atti
tude. It perpetuated itself
throughout rehearsals and perfor
mances," said director Salma Qar
nain. "I consider her a major find.
She's one of those people who
wants to put time into production,
and that's really rare."
Although the experience was
difficult, Cunha feels it was
extremely beneficial to her.
"It gave me such a feeling of
accomplishment, to be able to do
Gaieties. I was able to do all of the
dances and songs and not have
anyone suspect that anything was
wrong," she said.
"It was such a welcoming thing
to do Gaieties, everyone was so
great. It's a lot better to be a stu
dent here than a patient."
