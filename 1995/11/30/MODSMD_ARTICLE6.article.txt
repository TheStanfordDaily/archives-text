## Cancer can't stop Gaieties star 
### Kristina Batiste 
A year ago, Anne Cunha was in a wheelchair, un
able to walk on her own strength and suffering from
Hodgkin's lymphoma — a cancer that attacks the
lymphatic system. Two weeks ago, she was singing
and dancing on stage as "KaNdeE*, the Ninja Dollie
star of Big Game Gaieties.
Cunha was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma
in February 1994, her freshman year at Princeton
University. She had what she thought was a swollen
gland, the type associated with colds, when a nurse at
the University Clinic told her otherwise: Cunha had a
relatively common form of cancer that is easily — and
usually successfully — treated with six months of
chemotherapy.
Cunha traveled across the country to her home
town of Sacramento for the routine treatment. She
expected to complete the treatment and recover in
time to be back at Princeton for her sophomore year.

During treatment she experienced significant pain
accompanied by extreme weight loss and night
sweat, but a determination to continue her educa
tion led her to take summer school classes while on
chemotherapy.
Unfortunately, the treatment didn't work.
"In 99 percent of the cases, the chemo works. I
guess I was in the 1 percent that it doesn't," Cunha
said. "I just really wanted to get back to Princeton as
quickly as possible."
Instead, Cunha faced the daunting prospect of a
bone marrow transplant. This could not be done at
her local hospital, so last November, Cunha made the
trip to the Stanford Medical Center.
There, before even having the chance to recover
from the initial six months of chemotherapy, she un
derwent an experimental new treatment that actual
ly used her own bone marrow to effect a cure. Cunha
