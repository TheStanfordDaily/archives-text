# Mural motivation: artists visit
## Lunch time series hosts Chicano creativeness 
### Dale Margolin 
The Casa Zapata murals may
he the most conspicuous sign of
Chicano art at Stanford, but a
new lunch series aims to show
case an even wider variety of
Chicano artists.
The series, sponsored by the
Art Department and the Chi
cano Fellows Program, gives
students the opportunity to
meet with various Chicano
artists from California. The pro
gram was organized by Maria
Ochoa, a visiting assistant pro
fessor of art, who was invited to
Stanford by the Chicano Fellows
Program.
Ochoa's specialization in Chi
cano art led her to organize the
luncheon series and bring fa
mous Chicano artists to speak
about their work with students.
This quarter Ochoa is teach
ing a course on the Chicano art
movement. The lunch series
stems from her course, she said,
although anyone with an inter
est in art is invited to attend.
"The purpose of the program
is to bring artists to the campus
so that students can have the op
portunity to interact with
them," Ochoa said. She added
that she hopes students can
learn how the various artists
"create," and how social condi
tions affect their artistic expres
sions.
In total, five speakers were in
vited to the luncheons. Past
guests have included Laura
Aguilar, a Los Angeles-based
Chicana lesbian photographer
best known for her portraits â€”
which range in subject from
artists to business professionals,

and gays and lesbians to hetero
sexuals.
Also featured at one of the
programs was Juuna Aliciu, a
well-known Bay Area muralist
whose work can be seen at Stan

ford in Casa Zapata.
Today's lunch features
