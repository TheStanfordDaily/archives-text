# Civil Rights head speaks

Amid the swirling controversy over affirmative
action, Deval Patrick, an assistant attorney general
in the Department of Justice, delivered a spirited
defense of the policies yesterday.
"As a nation we are not fully truly free," Patrick
told a Law School audience of about 150. Patrick
was appointed by President Clinton in 1994 to head
the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.
"Images of retreat and regression cross my
desk," he added in reference to recent racial inci
dents such as reported discrimination by Denny's
Restaurants. Many minorities are feeling more
threatened today than in the last several years, he
said.
Unfortunately, currently "little of [the affirma
tive action] debate is constructive," Patrick said.
According to Patrick, part of the problem is that
"we don't define what we are talking about."
Patrick added that not all critics of affirmative
action are the same. Some truly want a race-blind
society, and we should at least try to understand
their position, he said.
He referred to many other opponents as "first
degree hypocrites." They claim to believe in anti
discrimination laws but want to cut funding for

enforcement agencies, he said.
When asked about Stanford's recent reaffirma
tion of affirmative action policies, Patrick replied,
"Three cheers for Stanford."
As for the University of California Board of
Regents' decision to abandon affirmative action,
Patrick said in practice the decision will have little
effect. The federal government requires that con
tractors maintain affirmative action in hiring, and if
the UC system wants to remain one of the largest
recipients of federal funds, no changes will likely be
made in the hiring process, he said.
As for admissions, UC admissions officers have
stressed that they will still strive to maintain diver
sity, he said. However, Patrick added that the
regents' decision may unjustly cause minority stu
dents to question their place.
In stressing the importance of maintaining affir
mative action policies, Patrick, who is black, men
tioned that he still gets followed in department
stores and has trouble hailing a taxi.
Discrimination has proven an impediment pre
venting some from sharing in the United States'
historic legacy of idealism and opportunity, Patrick
said. Affirmative action, he added, "is about
redeeming that fundamental hope for all Ameri
cans."
