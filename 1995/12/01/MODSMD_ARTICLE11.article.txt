# GPS research takes off

Stanford doctoral student Paul Montgomery has
built a plane that flies itself using a satellite system —
a breakthrough that could bring dramatic changes in
the way aircraft navigate.
Montgomery's unmanned plane can calculate its
speed and position using information from satellites.
The satellite method is considerably cheaper and sim
pler than auto pilot guidance systems currently used
on modern commercial jetliners.
This past Tuesday, Montgomery's plane — which
he built for his doctoral dissertation — managed to
take off, fly a programmed trajectory and land suc
cessfully without help from the ground. The craft,
which has a wingspan of 12 feet, made four flights of
approximately one mile each.
Montgomery's aircraft contains a device that is able
to calculate its position from the signals transmitted
by satellites that are part of the Global Positioning
System (GPS).
According to Clark Cohen, manager of the GPS
Precision Landing Program at Stanford, the system
consists of 21 satellites built by the Department of
Defense in the early 19705.
These satellites allow anyone who has a simple
device like the one on Montgomery's plane to instant
ly calculate his or her latitude, longitude and altitude

with great accuracy. Cohen said such devices are avail
able to hikers for as little as $300. He added that GPS
is already widely used in all forms of navigation, espe
cially on ships.
For decades, mechanisms such as jetliner auto pilot
systems and missile guidance systems have relied on
inertial navigation, which requires complicated mech
anisms using gyroscopes. The satellite method that
Montgomery favors needs none of these things.
"It shrinks all of that equipment into one little
box," he explained. "It's simpler and cheaper."
Montgomery went on to say that an inertial navi
gation system can cost as much as $100,000 while the
device on his plan, which calculates velocity and other
factors, cost about $1,000.
He added that since the technology of satellite nav
igation is still advancing, the cost of the equipment
will continue to fall. He predicted that in five years,
GPS devices will be available for under $100.
Satellite navigation is also more accurate than tra
ditional navigation systems for many applications,
Cohen said.
Montgomery went on to cite possible uses of the
technology for civilians, including using unmanned
aircraft to take aerial photographs and to replace bal
loons in weather monitoring.
"Basically, you can use it anywhere where you
want an aircraft but you don't want to have a man in
it,"he said.
