Test kit for cancer rejected
GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) - Government
scientists rejected yesterday the first genetic test
kit designed to predict which breast cancer
patients could relapse after surgery and thus need
tougher treatment.
The test detects a gene believed to spur cancer
cell growth. Several hospitals already check peo
ple with small, early tumors for the gene in decid
ing how aggressively to treat them.
But those tests are experimental, performed
with little government oversight and accuracy dif
fers from lab to lab, said Dr. Dennis Slamon of the
University of California at Los Angeles.
"We are very disappointed," said Dr. Sandy
Wolman, Oncor's medical director, who predicted
the company would get the additional data within
a year.
The kit already is sold in Europe.

Egyptian election questioned
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) â€” Prominent Islamic
opponents of President Hosni Mubarak were
defeated yesterday in parliamentary elections, but
critics claimed the results were tainted by vote
rigging and intimidation.
Final results were expected today, but early
returns showed government candidates taking a
commanding lead, although half of the 444 seats
in parliament will have to be decided in runoffs
next week.
Three people were shot to death yesterday in
protests over election results, raising to eight the
death toll from violence connected to Wednes
day's balloting.
The election was largely seen as a contest
between the government and its main rival, the
Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest Islamic
group.
