WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary
William Perry raised the price tag yesterday for the
Bosnia deployment to $2 billion and said the mission
will require 32,000 American troops in and around
the former Yugoslavia.
There was a mix of skepticism and resignation as
the House National Security Committee opened a
hearing on the plan. "The proverbial train has left
the station and our troops are already on board,"
Rep. Floyd Spence, the panel's chairman, said.
Spence, R-S.C., said that "we will all eventually
regret allowing American prestige and the cohesion
of the NATO alliance to be put at risk for a Bosnian
peacekeeping mission."
Administration officials did not try to play down
the risks.
"The mission will be tough and there's no doubt
about it, and we have to be prepared for casualties,"
Gen. John Shalikashvili, the nation's top military
officer, told the I louse International Relations Com
mittee at a separate hearing.

The National Security session brought a brief,
tense exchange between Perry and Rep. Curt Wel
don, R-Pa.
The defense secretary said that when he spoke to
U.S. troops who will be part of the peacekeeping
force, they asked him, "When we go into Bosnia will
our Congress support us? Will we be able to keep
this issue separate from partisan politics?"
Minutes later, Weldon responded angrily that "we'll
be there for our troops, make no mistake about it."
Weldon noted allegations that the U.S. commander
in Somalia was turned down when he asked for more
equipment, which prompted Perry to reply in a voice
tense with anger: "I don't need anybody to tell me
what our soldiers need. When our commanders need
weapons and equipment, I will see that they get it."
llep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., urged Perry to rec
ommend to Clinton that he not sign a defense spend
ing bill containing $7 billion more than he request
ed. She asked if the cost of the Bosnia deployment
would come out of that bill.
