New spin guide is
the wrong fix for
our image problem

Hurrah for the administra
tion, especially our incom
parable Director of Univer
sity Communications Terry Shep
ard, for solving a problem few at
Stanford had even recognized: the
inability of some of the world's most
intelligent people to communicate.
It seems that, as faculty, staff and
students go about their daily lives,
they spread conflicting — some
times even negative — messages
about Stanford. It was actually pos
sible, for example, for some faculty
members or students to be quoted
in national media outlets criticizing
aspects of Stanford.
Fortunately, Shepard tackled this
challenging problem with his
boundless energy and created a
"universitywide IsicJ Strategic
Communications Plan." This pio
neering document provides the nec
essary "melodies and leitmotifs" to
help us all sound the same idea
whenever we open our mouths: The
Essential Stanford.
What, you ask, is The Essential
Stanford? It is the sum of the
"attributes that define and differ
entiate" the University. Since there
are hundreds of such attributes,
the pioneering plan has simplified
this potentially confusing diversity
and created an incomparable list of
seven reasons Stanford is good
(challenging academics, a western
spirit, diversity, public service, ath
letics, global scope — and it's pret
ty). For those academics who find
themselves at a loss for words,
Shepard included six stunning
adjectives to use when discussing
the Farm (incomparable, challeng
ing, pioneering / western, vibrant,
boundless, stunning).
Even with such specific guide
lines, however, properly propagan
dizing the University could be diffi

cult. The challenging problem is
that Stanford has "manifold people,
products and publics" which it must
vibrantly communicate to many
other "publics." (For those wonder
ing, "publics" includes "virtually
everyone in the United States, if not
the world." Fortunately we can con
centrate on a smaller group of "pri
mary publics" the plan outlines in a
Dantean diagram of four descend
ing circles.)
Again, the vibrant Shepard deliv
ers. Included in the plan is a stun
ning list of the "primary vehicles"
the manifold members of each pub
lic should use to interact with other
publics. The president and provost,
for example, must be pleased to
learn that they can communicate
with "Medical Center Constituen
cies" both through "actions" and
"statements." Befuddled trustees
will now have the proper tools to
communicate with other trustees:
"discussion" and "personal interac
tion." Meanwhile, we all should
"practice word-of-mouth."
In these Hobbesian times
when "the public and news
media are entrenched in an era
of 'Gotcha!' — aggressive cyni
cism, often spilling over into
open antagonism, toward any
person or institution viewed as
successful, powerful or presti
gious," we need just this sort of
boundless, paternalistic guid
ance to thrive. As Shepard
reminds us, with his incompara
ble panache, "Complex issues
must be compressed into themes,
slogans or stereotypes that have
simplicity and clarity. An
institution must speak with one
voice, not many voices."
So away with the din of debate,
the polyphonic gnashing and crash
ing of one idea against another. We
can now limit ourselves to six stun
ning adjectives and seven reasons to
value Stanford which are guaran
teed to never cause debate or
disharmony. Hurrah for the new
Strategic Communications Plan, a
vision pioneering enough to help us
take the first big leap from Stanford
to Stepford.
