## Interview with the Coma 
### 
I WAS PONDERING the possibilities of
consciousness when I realized that fully
awake is not my favorite state thereof.
Or: I had just finished making a decision,
when someone in complete agreement with
me walked in and wrote it on the wall.
Let me clarify: My professor was dis
cussing the difference between English
men who wrote tedious 400-page novels in
the 18th century and English women who
wrote tedious 400-page novels in the 18th
century, and I thought to myself, "I'd
rather be in a coma than in this lecture."
Later, an imposing, overweight postal
worker identified me as his historical
oppressor, when all I wanted to do was mail
a job application. I mused, "I'd rather be in
a coma than standing here suffering the
rudeness of this victim of technology."
Suddenly, I was sure I understood the
mission of Stanford's lone tenacious tagger:
the stickers, the graffiti, the dream that a
one-word poem could really change the
world, starting with one of its most presti
gious universities. I wanted to give the man
who has shared with us his obsession with a
word the chance to elaborate on his succinct
idea, and simultaneously answer one more
question that has been impressed upon the
collective campus mind for two years.
Through my extensive network of
sources in the Art Libniry, I arranged a
meeting of the minds between myself and a
student who claimed to be the elusive artist
usually known by the unadorned title "that
COMA guy." Unfortunately, though, our

minds did something more like recognizing
each other on the street, averting their
eyes, and quickly continuing on their way.
Josh Gohlke: As one of your professional
colleagues might say, where you from?
COMA: (unplaceable accent) Lots of differ
ent places.
JG: An important part of obscure fame is
title. May we indeed conflate message with
name, and call you COMA?
C: (twitches nervously) I'm very unhappy
that you asked, but I actually prefer to be
referred to as "the arch-fiend."
JG: Better to reign in hell th;in serve in
heaven?
C: When addressed directly, I prefer the
apostrophe, "O, arch-fiend."
JG: Do you mind if I refuse to comply with
that request?
C: No.
JG: I m sure I speak for many Stanford
students when I express my feelings of
simultaneous fascination and befuddle
ment toward the message you have chosen.
What are you trying to convey with the
word "COMA"?
C: It's my favorite mark of punctuation.
Periods are quite simple and obvious, and
there are no real endings in our existence.
Question and exclamation marks have been
done, by Guess and Joop, respectively. But
the COMA, its pause, if you will, its ambiva
lence — I find it simply lovely.
JG: I've always been partial to semicolons.
C: I find them pretentious; besides,
"COMA" has the advantage of it's double

meaning.
JG: You do realize that the two words —
prolonged unconsciousness and the punc
tuation mark — are spelled and pro
nounced differently?
C: (frowning, frothing) It's exactly that
kind of logical reductionism I'm rebelling
against.
JG: One of the stall doors in the men's
restroom at Tresidder Union used to say,
"COMA is my hero." How did you feel
when they started remodeling there, no
doubt obliterating that monument to self
flattery?
C: (misty) I was a part of that bathroom.
No one consulted me. I can only compare it
to what Adam West must have felt when he
wasn't so much as offered the role in the
first "Batman" movie.
JG: Speaking of Adam West, you are much
older and whiter than most of the people in
your business. Where do you manage to
find meaning in all of it?
C: I find meaning in the smallest of things.
The answers are everywhere, as I've writ
ten them. Sure, sometimes I ask myself,
"Who am I?" But then I remember: I'm
Jean Valjean.
JG: Is there anything else you'd like to tell
the kids?
C: Yeah — COMA up your ass!
