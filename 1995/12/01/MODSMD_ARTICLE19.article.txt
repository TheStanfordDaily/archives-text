Howe's decree violates ASSU Constitution

FORGET ABOUT THE accusations,
rumors and mudslinging surround
ing the Nominations Commission
fiasco; as members of the senate we want
to ensure the long-term integrity of the
nominations process.
As a result of the recent trivialization
of the ASSU nominations process, the
student senate now finds itself in a tug
of-war with the administration. When the
dust has settled, the only remaining issue
of any importance will still be whether or
not students have a substantive voice on
University committees dealing with
issues from the alcohol policy to the grad
ing policy. And in the wake of apparent
trouble, the Office of Student Activities
seems more than willing to assume con
trol.
What is at stake? The student body has
long demanded representation on Univer
sity committees in order to involve stu
dents in the decision-making processes.
Nom Comm operates under the assump
tion that students are responsible and
mature enough to select their own repre
sentatives. Empowered with this funda
mental right and understanding that the

University exists of and for the students,
we refuse to submit to the administra
tion's assumptions that there no longer
exists a viable institution which can select
student representation.
One cause of the mix-up resulting in
the recent resignation of the Nom Comm
chair has been the administration's appar
ent disregard for student involvement.
Although administrators knew nine
months ago that student representatives
would be required to serve on the Com
parative Studies on Race and Ethnicity
(CSRE) Executive Committee, they
delayed making the request until two
weeks before the first committee meeting.
The scramble to appoint students to the
CSRE committee given the short time line
resulted in the ensuing confusion and
questionable methodology of the nomina
tions process. This disregard of the value
of student input is intolerable.
Perhaps the most outrageous example
of administrative disregard of student
voice is illustrated by an e-mail sent by
Nanci Howe, Director Student Activities,
regarding the recent resignation of the
Nom Comm chair. In Howe's e-mail she

states: "I am telling every committee con
tact that they are now free to .. . appoint
theire [sic] own representatives." Howe
went on to state that "this is standard
procedure when ASSU has failed to follow
through on completing the process in a
timely process [sic]."
Interestingly enough, the Constitution
of the ASSU (a contract between the stu
dent body and the Board of Trustees)
states that the only way in which student
appointments to University committees
can be made in the absence of a Nom
Comm is when a special agreement
between the president of the University
and the ASSU Senate is completed (ASSU
Constitution, Article 11, Section 12). We
see this incident as a reflection of the Uni
versity's lack of respect for students and
our mutual relationship of trust.
In recent years, Stanford students have
witnessed a steady decline in the Universi
ty's efforts to solicit student opinion. Four
years ago, an assistant to the University
president was assigned to work closely
with the Nominations Commission chair
to fill openings on committees throughout
the University.

Currently, the President's Office has
little, if any, consistent involvement with
Nom Comm. A mechanism does not even
exist through which the Nominations
Commission am find out which commit
tee positions are vacant or when new com
mittees are being formed.
It is our feeling that as long as we are
willing to make the effort, the University
should be willing to provide us with the
necessary information. I jet us be clear â€”
we assert our rights and we accept our
responsibilities. Student representatives
chosen by their peers should and will par
ticipate in University committee proceed
ings. This being one of our fundamental
working principles, we will accept nothing
less. The student voice will be heard, you
can count on it.
