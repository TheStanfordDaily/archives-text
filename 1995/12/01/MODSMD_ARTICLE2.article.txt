# OSA action infuriates the ASSU
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
As if the resignation of Nomina
tions Commission Chair Scott
Weintraub earlier this week wasn't
enough, a new player has joined the
Nom Comm controversy.
Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe sent an e-mail mes
sage yesterday to ASSU Senate
Chair Alane Murdock, stating that
University committees like that for

Comparative Studies in llace and Ethnicity now have
the option to hand-pick their student representatives
— a job which is supposed to be done Nom Comm.
Howe's message has infuriated ASSU senators,
leading them to accuse key University administrators
of trying to de-emphasize the importance of the ASSU
student voice.
"Nanci Howe was completely out of line," said
Deputy Senate Chair Bill Shen.
According to the ASSU Constitution, if Nom Comm
is unable to complete the appointment process, "alter-

native procedures for these nomi
nations may be specified, through
agreements between the senate and
the president of the University."
Murdock said she is not sure
Howe has the authority to allow
University committees to pick their
own students. "We had already
taken steps to carry on the nomina
tions process — and I don't know if
Nanci [Howe) knew we had taken
action," Murdock said. "Nominat
ing students to committees is a pro
cess given to us by the president."
Howe's e-mail read: "I am telling
every committee contact that they
are now free to ... appoint their
own representatives. This is stan
dard procedure when the ASSU has
failed to follow through...."
Howe could not be reached for
comment yesterday despite repeat
ed phone calls.
Council of Presidents member
Rich Stolz said he felt decisions
made by committees which didn't
have "student-selected students"
would not be valid.

"The University has an opportu
nity to demonstrate its commit
ment to having legitimate student
input on University committees,"
Stolz said.
Stolz said Howe has not been
designated by the University's
Board of Trustees to deal with the
ASSU. "I don't see how her refer
ence to standard procedure has any
relevance — we have made a con
certed effort to change standard
procedure, and Nom Comm has to
be integral to the process."
Shen said the University has
been distancing itself from the
ASSU in recent years. "Four years
ago, the Nom Comm chair received
training from the President's
Office — we have nothing like that
now. The Nom Comm chair has to
teach himself," Shen said.
Shen added that he feels Howe's
e-mail is disrespectful of students,
and the senate is "putting a lot of
blame for what happened [with
Nom Comm] on the University."
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven and Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Ramon Saldivar "knew nine
months in advance that they need
ed the students and they gave Rich

(Stolz) and Scott (WeintraubJ six
days to find them," said Shen. "We
don't feel the administration
respects us."
In an effort to re-establish their
credibility, ASSU senators have
asked the senate's Administration
and Rules Committee to "review
what led to the breakdown in the
nominations process," Shen said.
"We want to examine how this
snowballed into Scott's resigna
tion," said Shen. "We want to make
sure people understand the bylaws
and that it doesn't happen again."
Undergraduate senator Angela
Parker said the committee needs to
refocus attention on student needs.
"I don't really feel this is an eth
ical issue exactly. I really trust peo
ple, and I don't think anyone had ill
intent," she said.
The senate steering committee
has appointed eight new students
to "make the necessary revisions to
the Nom Comm bills." Murdock
also wrote in an e-mail to the sen
ate that the senate's Executive
Committee and three other sena
tors will fill the nominating duties.
A new Nom Comm chair will be
appointed during winter quarter,
according to Stolz.
