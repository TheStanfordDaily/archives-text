# Cohn's predictions are incorrect again
## 
### 
Prof. Robert Greer Cohn has finally
found his true calling, after all these
years. Not content merely to whine
about the decline and fall of Western
Civilization in the abstract, he has taken
to prognostications in The Daily.
So we are treated to his ruminations

on the future of the Bosnian peace plan,
the unspoken opinions of University
President Gerhard Casper (which are, of
course, known to intuitive seers like Prof.
Cohn), his nostalgia for the glory days of
the British monarchy (who does he have
in mind? Richard 111, Henry VIII, Edward
VII, Edward VIII?), among other topics.
It is all good fun and we should wel
come the chuckle as we head into finals.
He has joined the worthy ranks of Nos
tradamus, the Delphic Oracle, and

Jeanne Dixon. Welcome, Prof. Cohn!
But before we rush out to buy the
National Enquirer to see how its predic
tions compare with Prof. Cohn's, I would
like to recall a prediction he made less
than a year ago on this same page, when
he wrote with great certainty that Tyrone
Willingham's appointment as head foot
ball coach was an "affirmative action"
appointment and doomed to failure.
I had no idea that Prof. Cohn cared
about anything as mundane as football,

but it was nice to have him publicly on
the record. And the record this fall
shows that he was not only wrong, but
he made a fool of himself.
Who knows? If Clinton wins re-elec
tion and if affirmative action doesn't
really go away soon, we can make this an
annual event: recalling all his botched
predictions of the year before. We could
call it, "Eat My Words Day."
