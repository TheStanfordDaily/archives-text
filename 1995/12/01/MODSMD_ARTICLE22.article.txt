# Consumption-tax meeting at CEPR
## 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
Prominent economists from around the
nation will gather today to discuss various
consumption tax proposals at a conference
sponsored by the Center for Economic Poli
cy Research (CEPR).
"There are many ways to tax income or
consumption," said Economics Prof. Michael
Boskin, who will speak at the conference.
" The different consumption tax proposals all
have in common that they tax savings only
once, as opposed to two or even three times,
as in our current system."
In a consumption tax system, which could
possibly replace the current United States
income tax system, income such as interest
from savings would not he initially taxed.
Current consumption tax proposals include
wage tax, flat tax, national sales tax and

value-added tax proposals.
Economics Prof. Douglas Bernheim said
there are a number of arguments for and
against the various consumption tax propos
als. For instance, he used the example of
savings taxation as an argument for a con
sumption tax.
"If you tax savings, you are really taxing
future consumption," Bernheim said.
He also discussed how some consumption
tax proposals could potentially harm groups
such as the elderly, depending on how the
taxes are implemented.
"The elderly are often spending down
their savings to pay for their retirement," he
said, adding that they would have to pay
more taxes because they are consuming
instead of spending.
Bernheim also discussed the issue of com
plexity and the number of perspectives on
the issue.

"The income tax system of today is
incredibly complex," he said. "The treat
ment of capital income requires a lot of spe
cial and complicated rules. There is an argu
ment that a consumption tax would be much
simpler. However, this perspective is not
universal."
The conference aims to clarify and answer
many of these questions, according to
Boskin.
In addition to numerous Stanford
economists, experts from UC-Berkeley,
UCLA, the University of Michigan, Prince
ton University, Columbia University and the
University of Wisconsin at Madison will par
ticipate in the conference, which is being
held at the conference center of the CEPR.
Space at the conference for students is
extremely limited, and those who are inter
ested in attending should contact Deborah
Carvalho at the CEPR.
