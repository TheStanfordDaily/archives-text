# 'Vibrant'? Blasphemy!

### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
In response to heavy criticism
from Classics Prof. Marsh
McCall at yesterday's Faculty
Senate meeting, University
President Gerhard Casper dis
avowed the seven summary
adjectives the University's
Strategic Communications Plan
recommended to describe Stan
ford.
"This misfired," Casper said.
"The document is completely
withdrawn."
While affirming the meaning
behind the terms, Casper said
the prescribed words — "incom
parable," "challenging," "pio
neering/western," "vibrant,"
"boundless" and "stunning" —
are "just labels." He urged the
senators "not to take them seri
ously."
McCall strongly criticized the
report, calling it "reductive,
anti-intellectual, vapid, self
defeating, embarrassing, insult
ing and crying out to be jetti
soned."
The 30-page plan, written by
Director of University Commu
nications Terry Shepard, was
formulated in order to better
communicate the unique char
acteristics of Stanford to differ
ent "publics." Among others,
the Office of the President and
the Provost, the Alumni Associ
ation and the Athletics Depart
ment contributed to the report.
"The Board of Trustees asked
for a communication plan,"
Casper said. "I had misgivings,
but I had other things to think
about. Terry Shepard permitted
exuberant language (the pre
scribed adjectives) to come into
an otherwise mundane docu
ment."

Casper said some of the prob
lems with the document may
stem from the fact that "it was
not thought through well."
Although the adjectives are
meant to separate Stanford
from other institutions, McCall
said that they do not even
describe a university, much less
Stanford.
"If you went to the corner of
University and Emerson and
asked someone what these
terms described, no one would
say they describe a world-class
university," McCall said. "There
are no words of the mind."
The terms also do not sepa
rate Stanford from its competi
tors, McCall added.
"In no way do these terms dif
ferentiate Stanford, except for
'western.' I don't think Yale is
going to back off from these
terms."
McCall suggested that words
from Casper's October affirma
tive action speech, such as
"highly intelligent, reflective,
not going for a quick fix and sen
sitive to history and people"
might be more appropriate.
McCall also criticized the lack
of faculty input into the plan. He
was particularly upset about
what he saw as a recommenda
tion to subvert "an independent,
skeptical faculty culture."
But Casper said he was not
intentionally trying to exclude
faculty input.
"It's very misguided to occu
py faculty time with an effort of
this kind," he said.
Casper added it is not his goal
to subjugate the faculty.
"I consider myself a member
of the faculty," Casper said. "I
do not like the juxtaposition of
the faculty and the administra
tion."
