## Tournament of Champions on deck for men's hoops Cardinal looks to rebound from USF shocker 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
If Stanford were looking for motiva
tion following last Tuesday's shocking
loss to San Francisco, 23,000 screaming
basketball junkies should be just what
the shot-doctor ordered.
The Harris Teeter / Diet Pepsi Tour
nament of Champions tips off tonight at
7 p.m. EST in the Charlotte Coliseum.
No. 17 North Carolina (3-1) will face
Tulane (2-0) in the first game, and No. 16
Stanford (2-1) will get into the action at 9
p.m. EST against South Carolina (2-0).
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery hopes that this weekend will
ignite a previously unemotional Cardinal
squad. The Cardinal's lack of intensity
translated into the 59-58 loss to the
Dons, cruelly issuing the message that
preparation and concentration will beat
high expectation and print notation.
"If they can't get ready for this game,
then I don't know what you're going to do
— there would be no excuse," Mont
gomery said.
"There'll be a great crowd, and we're
playing in a place that loves basketball. If
they need any more than that, that would
be pretty hard to figure."
However, just when intensity and
emotion have left the team, an old
acquaintance has reared its ugly head.
Junior point guard Brevin Knight's shin
problems have resurfaced after several
pain-free days.
"What he doesn't understand is how
come it didn't hurt yesterday and it did
hurt today — it's just very, very painful,"
Montgomery said. "I don't have the
answer for him, as nobody does. It's just
really sore."
Montgomery thought that yesterday's
practice, on an especially hard floor, may
have aggravated Knight's shin condition.
Knight sat out most of the practice but
will play tonight.
Having Knight sidelined does not help
a squad which is trying to discover a team
identity. Montgomery doesn't see the
USF game as a wake-up call since his
team hasn't really had a chance to react
on the court, and it is hard to judge how
the Cardinal will come out for each game.
"We're not executing very well — it's

real herky-jerky," Montgomery said.
"We rely pretty heavily on Brevin to do
his thing, but Tuesday night he played
pretty poorly, so that throws you out of
whack.
"And Dion (Cross is] not shooting the
ball as well, so when he comes off a screen
and the ball doesn't go down, all of a sud
den it's different than we're used to. The
things we normally get done aren't get
ting done, and we're not mentally accus
tomed to adjusting to that."
Part of the Cardinal's difficulty
against USF was its inability to set the
tempo. Rather than forcing its opponent
to react to whatever it is running, Stan
ford has fallen into a read-and-react men
tality.
South Carolina, which features a
potent three-guard attack consisting of
Larry Davis, Melvin Watson and B.J.
McKie, runs a modified North Carolina
motion offense that could very easily dic
tate the speed of the game. Head coach
Eddie Fogler, who played and coached
under Dean Smith from 1968-1986, has
finally put his system into place with the
Gamecocks.
Davis, a junior transfer from North
Carolina, leads South Carolina in scoring
at a 24-points-per-game clip. Watson, a
sophomore, notches 19 points and dishes
out 7.5 assists a game, while McKie, a
highly-touted freshman, rounds out the
backcourt scoring with 13 points a game.
Inside, the Gamecocks shuttle in big
men Nate Wilbourne (6-foot-11, 255
pounds), Malik Russell (6-7, 220),
William Unsold (6-8, 225) and Ryan
Stack (6-11, 215) to hold down the fort.
Defensively, Montgomery expects the
Gamecocks to switch defenses after near
ly every dead-ball situation, bringing a
mix of man-to-man, zone trap and full
court pressure. After struggling against
the zones employed by Rice and USF, the
Cardinal can expect South Carolina to
switch early in the game.
The coaching staff has used a secret
weapon in preparation against the Game
cocks - junior transfer Pete Van Elswyk,
a two-year starter from South Carolina.

players with sophomore center
Tim Young, who must post a
strong performance. While the
Cardinal has had success getting
the ball into Young, he has had
difficulties converting the
opportunities into buckets.

"I think I was just taking too
much time on my moves,"
Young said. "I should just get
the ball and move quicker and
not think as much when I get
the ball."
Depending on the outcome of
tonight's contests, Stanford will
play at either 7 p.m. or 9 p.m.
EST tomorrow. The consolation
game will take place first, fol
lowed by the championship.

The other two teams in the
tournament, North Carolina
and Tulane, are on different
ends of the reputation stick. The
Tar Heels, after the loss of
sophomore phenoms Rasheed
Wallace and Jerry Stackhouse to
the NBA, are thinner than
usual, while the Green Wave
hoasts a talented frontcourt of
Rayshard Allen and Jerald Hon
eycutt.
