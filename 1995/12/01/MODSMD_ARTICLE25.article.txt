##

To become a great team, it is
not enough to win a lot of games.

To reach the highest level of suc
cess and recognition, a team must
win the games that count.
The No. 3 Stanford women's
volleyball team (26-2) won all the
matches that counted last year en

route to its second national cham
pionship in three years. Tomor
row, the Cardinal will open NCAA
tournament play at 7 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion against No. 24
Northern lowa. The Panthers
(29-1) defeated Colorado 15-7, 15-
12, 21-19 on Wednesday in first
round action.
"Hopefully, our season has five
more games to go," said Stanford
coach Don Shaw. "It's been a good
season for us, and we should be
rejuvenated by the [start of the!
NCAA tournament."
Stanford has had a few practice
opportunities since its final regu
lar-season match against USF on
Nov. 21. The women spikers have
used their 10-day break to prepare
for either Colorado or Northern
lowa.
The Cardinal will enter the
tournament on a roll, having won
23 consecutive matches and 30
straight games. The winning
streak is the third longest in the
nation behind those of No. 1
Nebraska and No. 2 Hawaii. (The
Cornhuskers have won 27
straight, while the Rainbows are
29-0 on the year.) Stanford com
pleted its first undefeated trip
through the PacificlO Conference
in four years, winning all 18 of its
league matches. No Pac-10 team
had accomplished such a feat
since UCIjA went undefeated in
1992.
Stanford features senior set
ter/outside hitter Cary Wendell,
who earned Pac-10 Player of the
Year honors. Sophomore outside
hitter Kristin Folkl and sopho
more setter / outside hitter Lisa
Sharpley also joined Wendell on
the Pac-10 first team.
Senior Wendy Hromadka post
ed her best season ever with the
Cardinal in 1995, starting every
match at outside hitter. For her
efforts, the Pac-10 included her on
its honorable mention list. Sopho
more middle blocker Barbara Ifeji
ka and junior middle blocker
Eileen Murfee also received hon
orable mention recognition.
Should the Cardinal win
tomorrow, it will advance to next
week's Pacific Regional, which
Stanford will host as the region's
top seed. If Stanford wins the
regional, it will travel to Amherst,
Mass. for the Final Four, which
will take place Dec. 14-16 at the
University of Massachusetts.
