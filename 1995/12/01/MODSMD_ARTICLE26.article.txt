## No. 11 Cardinal return to Maples after splitting out East 
### Bobby Cuza Contributing writer 
The llth-ranked Stanford women's basketball
team (1-1) will make its home debut tonight at
Maples Pavilion when the Cardinal tries to extend
its 17-game home winning streak against red-hot
Old Dominion (3-0). The contest will start at 7
p.m.
The Lady Monarchs, who debuted at No. 21 in
this week's Associated Press poll, registered one of
their biggest wins in school history last week when
they stunned previously second-ranked Georgia 67-
64. Sports Illustrated selected the Lady Bulldogs as
its preseason No. 1 just a week ago, but Georgia has
now slipped to No. (i in this week's AP poll. As if the
upset didn't serve fair warning, Old Dominion deliv
ered a 22-point thumping of California on Wednes
day night.
"They're getting a lot of confidence," said Stan
ford head coach Amy Tucker. "I think they're feeling
pretty good about coming in here."
The Cardinal, on the other hand, is still strug
gling to regain momentum after last Friday's sea
son-opening loss to unranked Massachusetts. The
Minutemen held Stanford to 32 percent shooting
and limited junior Kate Starbird — last year's lead
ing scorer for the Cardinal — to just three points in

the 65-56 upset. The Cardinal bounced back on Sun
day with a 23-point win over Providence.
"I think [the loss to UMass] showed that we can
not come out without our best effort," Tucker said.
"I think that people made a significant improvement
when we played Providence, so I'm hoping that was
kind of like a blip on the screen. It's over with and
we've learned our lesson."
One of the biggest problems the women ran into
last weekend was adjusting to a zone defense.
UMass managed to neutralize Stanford's size — the
Cardinal boasts three frontcourt players that mea
sure 6-2 or 6-3 as well as 6-foot-7 redshirt freshman
Chandra Benton — by shutting down the Cardinal's
outside shooting.
"I think we have a lot of work to do against a
zone," Tucker said. "We have excellent shooters on
our team. We did not shoot well in that game per se,
but I still have a lot of confidence in our shooting
ability against a zone, and I think people have confi
dence in their own shots. Sometimes they don't fall,
and that's when you have to count on your defense
to create offense for you."
That's exactly what happened in the Providence
game, as the Cardinal forced 29 turnovers in shut
ting down the Lady Friars' run-and-gun offensive
