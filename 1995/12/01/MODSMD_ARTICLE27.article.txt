Only a few weeks into the sea
son, the Stanford wrestling team
is set to try its hand at taking
down some of the biggest names

in the collegiate wrestling world.
The Cardinal will test its might
at the Las Vegas Invitational
today and tomorrow, which will
take place just outside Las Vegas
in Stateline, Nev. The tourna
ment includes 40 of the top teams

in the nation, including eight of
the country's top 10 programs,
headlined by perennial power
house Oklahoma State.
"OSU and Nebraska will prob
ably battle it out for the team
title, while Stanford and most of
the other schools will look to pro
duce place winners and move up
in the national rankings," said
Stanford head coach Chris Hor
pel.
The Cardinal enters the invite
with momentum from two
impressive performances, the
most recent coming at the
expense of a strong San Francisco
State program which defeated
Stanford last year. In last week's
dual meet against the Gators, the
Cardinal notched seven individual
victories, each in convincing fash
ion, while losing three closely con
tested bouts.
Stanford similarly trounced
UC-Davis two weeks ago. With
the two victories, the Cardinal
secured a sweep of its Ray Area
rivals.
Stanford's senior co-captains,
Jimmy Aguirre (134 pounds) and
Tod Surmon (142), hope to safe
guard their perfect records at the
tournament. Both wrestlers boast
records of 6-0 and national rank
