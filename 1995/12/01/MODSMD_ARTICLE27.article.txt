Only a few weeks into the sea
son, the Stanford wrestling team
is set to try its hand at taking
down some of the biggest names

in the collegiate wrestling world.
The Cardinal will test its might
at the Las Vegas Invitational
today and tomorrow, which will
take place just outside Las Vegas
in Stateline, Nev. The tourna
ment includes 40 of the top teams

in the nation, including eight of
the country's top 10 programs,
headlined by perennial power
house Oklahoma State.
"OSU and Nebraska will prob
ably battle it out for the team
title, while Stanford and most of
the other schools will look to pro
duce place winners and move up
in the national rankings," said
Stanford head coach Chris Hor
pel.
The Cardinal enters the invite
with momentum from two
impressive performances, the
most recent coming at the
expense of a strong San Francisco
State program which defeated
Stanford last year. In last week's
dual meet against the Gators, the
Cardinal notched seven individual
victories, each in convincing fash
ion, while losing three closely con
tested bouts.
Stanford similarly trounced
UC-Davis two weeks ago. With
the two victories, the Cardinal
secured a sweep of its Ray Area
rivals.
Stanford's senior co-captains,
Jimmy Aguirre (134 pounds) and
Tod Surmon (142), hope to safe
guard their perfect records at the
tournament. Both wrestlers boast
records of 6-0 and national rank

hopes for more success in Las Vegas this weekend.
ings of No. 15 and No. 5, respec
tively.
"It will be interesting to see
how Tod Surmon does down at
142 pounds since this is his first
time down there in a long time,
and he has already beaten the No.
1 wrestler in the [Pacific 10 Con
ference) from Arizona State at
150 [pounds]," Horpel said.
The Cardinal will only field
eight of its 10 starters in the tour

nament. Aguirre, Surmon, senior
Matt Cano (126), senior Sahlan
Martin (158), sophomore Scott
Chapman (167), sophomore
Jason Gladden (177), sophomore
Mark Neglay (heavyweight) and
redshirt freshman B.J. Sanchez
(150) will all wrestle. Junior
Bryan Vaniman (190) and fresh
man Frank Ruiz (118), two
injured starters, will sit out.
As far as Horpel is concerned,
the Las Vegas event provides an
opportunity for the Cardinal to
see how it measures up to nation
al-caliber competition. "This tour
nament is as tough as the NCAA

Championships," he said. "Plac
ing in this is like placing at nation
als and being an All-American. It
will be a good indicator of where
we stand both as a team and as
individuals."
As usual, conditioning is the pri
mary concern and will serve as an
indicator of the team's improve
ment. At this point in the season,
Stanford's conditioning is far from
perfect. Yet, Horpel remains confi
dent about his team's chances.
"Although our conditioning
still has a long way to go, I'm hop
ing to finish somewhere in the top
20," he said.
