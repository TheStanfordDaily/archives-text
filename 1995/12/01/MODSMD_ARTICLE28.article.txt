### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Members of Project SAVE (Stanford
AIDS Volunteer Educators) will lead an
effort in White Plaza today urging stu
dents and others to think seriously about
the danger HIV poses to young people.
The event is part of World AIDS Day,
an international event now in its eighth
year which aims to raise awareness of
HIV and AIDS.
Volunteers from Project SAVE and
other organizations will distribute educa
tional materials, inform students about
Cowell Student Health Center's free
anonymous HIV testing service and sell
red ribbons to benefit AIDS Resources
Information and Services of Santa Clara
County, said Jessica Alderman, Cowell's
director of student projects.
In addition, there will be a red-ribbon
board memorializing those who have died
from AIDS-related illnesses and a short
video telling three stories of how college
students can navigate safely through sex
ual situations, said senior Brad Andrews,
a member of Project SAVE.
Responding to a recent study revealing
that one in three drug users in East Palo

Alto is infected with HIV, volunteers
hope to increase campus awareness of the
disastrous effects the virus is having on
Stanford's neighbor, said sophomore
Nami Jhaveri, a member of Project
SAVE.
"We think it is important to connect
the work on campus with issues and
problems in the local community," said
Haas Center for Public Service Student
Affairs Specialist John Newsome. "There
is a sense on campus that IAIDS] is not
our issue. Meanwhile, three miles away, a
community is being devastated."
Jhaveri said the group hopes to collab
orate with leaders in East Palo Alto,
where HIV-positive patients often find it
difficult to gain access to services.
Project SAVE's goal of informing the
campus about the alarming rate of HIV
infection in East Palo Alto is closely
aligned with the theme of this year's
World AIDS Day, "Shared Rights, Shared
Responsibilities."
"We are taking on the issue of HIV and
how the disadvantaged are particularly
vulnerable to infection," said Cowell
Health Promotion Director Carole
Pertofsky, who works as an adviser to
Project SAVE. "One of our deepest hopes

is that Stanford raise its awareness that
discrimination, stigmatization and other
losses of human rights increase the vul
nerability of HIV infection."
"We hope students gain a deep appre
ciation to their vulnerability to HIV,"
Pertofsky said. "It's not something that
only happens in the margins of society."
According to a recent Cowell study,
one in every 500 Stanford students is
HIV positive and more than 71 percent of
Stanford's sexually active students do
not use protection consistently.
Project SAVE wants to dispel the
prevalent attitude that "it can't happen
to me," Andrews said.
"I think most people are aware,"
Jhaveri said. "They just need to be
reminded."
Members of the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center and other
Cowell student volunteers will join Pro
ject SAVE in today's education efforts.
In addition to providing peer counsel
ing and promoting HIV testing among stu
dents, Project SAVE, an organization
sponsored by Haas and Cowell, organizes
campus outreach programs in conjunction
with World AIDS Day and AIDS Aware
ness Week, which takes place every spring.
