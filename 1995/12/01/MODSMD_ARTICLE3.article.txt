# Harassment policy OK'd
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
After a complex moral and
legal debate over confidentiality,
record-keeping and liability, the
Faculty Senate unanimously ap
proved the revised version of the
sexual harassment policy yester
day.
According to University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper, the major
policy changes dealt with nomen
clature, the method of interven-

tion and the initiation of record keeping by the Sexu
al Harassment Coordinator.
However, the issue which sparked the most de
bate was confidentiality.
According to the new policy, confidentiality may
be breached when records face subpoena or when the
interest of the community outweighs the interest of
confidentiality.
"It would be less than appropriate to guarantee
confidentiality when the adviser learns of behavior
that is threatening and has a high likelihood" of re
peat offenses, Casper said.
Business Prof. Joanne Martin prodded Casper to
clarify under what conditions a professor would be
expected to report sexual harassment when a victim
requests confidentiality.
In many cases in her experience, Martin said, the
victims are "untenured professors, postdocs or doc-

torul students and the perpetra
tor is a well-known senior person
in their field," she said. "They are
unwilling to confront their
harasser . . . because they feel
that their whole career is on the
line."
A policy which required the
violation of confidentiality would
result in fewer cases being report
ed, Martin added.
If the harassment were not
reported to the University and
the victim later sued, Stanford
would be liable because it failed to
act on its knowledge, said General
Counsel Michael Roster.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg
said he did not think a professor
in that situation would have to
violate confidence except to the
extent that he or she is a part of

the University.
"You are only obligated . . .
insofar as the University is obli
gated to prevent future occur
rences," Weisberg said. "Then as
part of the University, you are
responsible. Rut unless you get a
directive from President Casper
that says you must, you are not
obligated" to report sexual
harassment.
However, Weisberg added, a
court could compel a professor to
breach confidentiality.
Casper disagreed, saying the
law makes no distinction between
professors and administrators.
Clarifying the policy for such
situations would not make legal
sense, Casper added, as the policy
should be kept as open as possible
to allow professors to rely on their
common sense and conscience.
Roster agreed, saying that if a
victim did not want his or her
confidentiality breached, "there
are ways to quietly intervene

without anyone knowing."
Molecular Pharmacology Prof.
Phyllis Gardner said strong confi
dentiality guarantees might stifle
discussion of sexual harassment,
while addressing sexual harass
ment in the open would force a
change in the institutional envi
ronment.
Faculty members also pointed
out problems with the proposed
record-keeping method.
According to the policy, "no
records will be retained in cases
where the individual accused was
not informed that there was a
complaint."
Since many victims are loath
to confront their harassers, if
records are not kept, repeat
offenders may be shielded, Gard
ner said.
While Casper said he did not
think it was fair to keep records
on those who have never had a
chance to address complaints, he
acknowledged the validity of

Gardner's point.
"This a trade-off (with the pol
icy], but I don't know any way
around it," Casper said.
The new policy will partly deal
with the documentation problem
by tracking the sex and depart
ment of the accuser and the
accused, as well as the status of
the complaint and some general
background details, said Sexual
Harassment Coordinator Laraine
Zappert.
Additionally, the policy makes
violators liable for some of the
costs that result from the harass
ment.
Since any settlement would be
paid from unrestricted funds
which would have otherwise
funded academics, it is reasonable
to expect those who violate the
policy to pay the price for their
misdeeds, Casper said. In cases
where a particular school is negli
gent, that school may be held
liable.
