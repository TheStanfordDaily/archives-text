# The Adventurous Experiment of Sir Real, the Benighted:
## A journey down the River of No Return, the Stream of Subconciousness
### 
"Before the problem of the ereative writer,
analysis must lay down its arms. "
— Sigmund Freud
I think Split Infinitive would make a really
cool name for a hand. So would Superego
and the Ids. Disjointed Discourse?
Now, given, that doesn't change the fact
that I didn't have a chance to put any posters
on my wall until this weekend, thank you very
much. Thanksgiving Break, you know. But
who's counting? After all, there's only one
one — even prime number. You see what I'm
saying?
Whoa! Excuse me — Australia flashbacks.
No, you don't understand. I've never been tit
Australia. That means. . .
So for Thanksgiving 1 go to my cousins
nearby, right? (Right.) They have this beauti
ful big big big house in the mountains. How
big? Well, we wind up the road for a bit
four hits, actually, by my watch and then
we crest this crest and my cousin says, "Here
we are." And I say, "Wow. what a beautiful
big big big house."
"That's the garage," she says.
Seven-ear garage. And this cousin of mine
who has the job that makes the money, to buy
the cars, to put in the garage, on top of the
mountain, next to the house that Jack built
(not that his name is Jack; it isn't) didn't even
finish college! What kind of commentary is
that?
All right, I think you'll agree it's time we
settled this debate once and for all. A good
idea, no? I'll flip you for it: Heads, it's a tie.
Tails, we 11 ip again. Simple enough. What, you
think I'm kidding?
This is no joke.

A priest, a rabbi, a Muslim cleric and an
Amish peanut farmer walk into a house of ill
repute. You with me so far? It gets better.
Now when* was I?
Thanksgiving. Let me tell you a little hit
about Thanksgiving. Let's see, we give thanks
on the anniversary of that big dinner where
the Pilgrims (big hats with belt-buckles, those
funny trumpet-with-trigger muskets, they're
all named "John" — you've seen 'em)
thanked the Native Americans for making
them feel at home in their new land (i.e., the
Native Americans' soon-to-be old land). Now
they don't "celebrate" this holiday in Eng
land, where they also don't celebrate the
Fourth of July, which makes sense (Bitter
much?). Also, they don't celebrate the Fourth
of July in Australia, which also makes sense
except for the fact that if they did, it would be
in the middle of winter. Damn Brits.
Think we'll go metric?
Of course, it's not like I have that much
wall space or that many posters to begin with.
And none of bands with really really cool
names anyway. Names like Mounting Magel
lan or Sister Backwash or Arachihutyrapho
bia. Vulcanized Haberdasher? Yeah, I got a
million of'em. How about 5.L.1.V.A.H.? No, it
doesn't stand for anything. . .
Whereupon graciously accepting the
peanut, the rabhi turns to the priest and says:
"Yes, Father, but you?" And the priest says:
"Well, where I work, I can't get nun!"
Seven ears! Can you believe it? I hope
someday to be able to afford a car, let alone
seven cars that would necessitate such a
garage. What does a family with two driver's
licenses do with seven cars anyway? And
don't even make the one-for-each-day-of-the

week joke. I already did. I don't think my
cousin was too amused.
But I digress.
See, it's "nun," hut it's really "none." Get
it? Yes? No? Okay, so you never studied the
anatomy of a joke. No, really, it's fine. It's not
that funny. May he even a little offensive.
That's what she said.
Okay, so what if the hand was industrial?
Sex and violence . . . oooh, I know: Scrotal
Contusion! Ouch.
Okay, okay, that was a little much. Yup, I
just played "Crossing the Line" on that one,
I'll admit it. But maybe we can all just take a
lesson from the Pilgrims and Native Ameri
cans on that first Thanksgiving in Australia:
If the shoe fits, wear it. If it doesn't, it proba
bly isn't yours — which means you can wear
it if you want, but besides being inappropri
ate, it's also probably uncomfortable. Or so
the story goes.
Heads. I win.

The fact that this column does not make sensi
(or does it?) does not change the fact that Stan
ford is an incomparable, challenging, vibrant,
boundless, stunning and pioneering I western
place. Now who's ridiculous
