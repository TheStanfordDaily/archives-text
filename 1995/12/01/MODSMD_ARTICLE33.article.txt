Several aliens entered
Xanadu house Nov. 29 at
a.m. One resident awoke when
the visitors disintegrated his
first-story window, Stanford
Poice Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
The extraterrestrials claimed
to know "Voltron the house
manager." The student knew
there was no house manager
named Voltron. but neverthe
less allowed the spacemen into
the house. The student said he
opened the door to a purplish
glittering creature with suction
cup feet looking for dilithium
crystals.
Another resident awoke to
find two spacemen rewiring his
stereo, attempting to contact the
Mothership. When he asked
them what they were doing,
they vaporized his teddy bear
and took $15 from his wallet.
The student went back to sleep

without calling the police.
The saucermen then entered
a female's unlocked room. She
awoke to find them levitating
above her bed and asked them to
leave. "Obviously, they were try
ing to impregnate her," Niemey
er said.
"What you have here is at
least two extraterrestrials in the
house. No one called the police
and people's doors were
unlocked. That's scary," said
Niemeyer. "'Phis is not normal."
Columnist missing
On Nov. 29, Stanford Daily
columnist Michael Green wrote
a column in which he claimed to
be having sex up to "two to four
times daily." Investigators are
trying to determine who wrote
this column and what they did
with the real Michael Green.
