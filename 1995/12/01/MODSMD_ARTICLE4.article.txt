In order to give students more academic
choices, the Faculty Senate unanimously ap
proved the creation of undergraduate minors
yesterday.
Speaking at yesterday's senate meeting, Psy
chology Prof. Anne Fernald, chair of the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies, said, "Stu
dents have broad interests when they come
here. Minors give them the opportunity to spe
cialize. . .without the burden of a double meyor.
It is widely felt that minors fulfill a need and it
will be a popular action."
Minors, which will be available in all three of
Stanford's undergraduate schools, will consist
of at least six courses but no more than 36 units
in a particular department or interdisciplinary
program as provided in the recommendation co
authored by Fernald's committee and the Com
mittee on Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment. Departments will be allowed to design
their own programs within the guidelines.
