# Fac Sen gives minors unanimous approval
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
In order to give students more academic
choices, the Faculty Senate unanimously ap
proved the creation of undergraduate minors
yesterday.
Speaking at yesterday's senate meeting, Psy
chology Prof. Anne Fernald, chair of the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies, said, "Stu
dents have broad interests when they come
here. Minors give them the opportunity to spe
cialize. . .without the burden of a double meyor.
It is widely felt that minors fulfill a need and it
will be a popular action."
Minors, which will be available in all three of
Stanford's undergraduate schools, will consist
of at least six courses but no more than 36 units
in a particular department or interdisciplinary
program as provided in the recommendation co
authored by Fernald's committee and the Com
mittee on Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment. Departments will be allowed to design
their own programs within the guidelines.
Students will be able to elect a
minor beginning next fall. Howev
er, due to space constraints, com
pletion of minors will only be noted
on students' transcripts, not on
diplomas, the report said.
One of the advantages of

minors, Fernald said, is that they
will decrease the number of stu
dents who elect to double major.
"Double majors . .. have to take
non-overlapping classes which
total a minimum of 120 units out
of 180, which is a considerable
chunk," Fernald said. "This leads
to superficiality and discourages
going into real depth."
A minor will also let a student
specialize in a sub-field more than
a major which requires certain dis

tribution requirements, said Histo
ry Prof. George Fredrickson.
But English Prof. John Bender
disagreed.
"The logic that doing more leads
to superficiality is confusing," he
said. "The impact of minors is to
decrease the number of serious
courses .. . students take."
Another advantage is that
minoring instead of double-major
ing will allow students to concen
trate more on research, said Biolo

gy Prof. Patricia Jones.
"Students who double-major
have less time to do individual
research," Jones said. "They end
up short-changing research."
Since students will have more
time to devote to research, minors
will increase the number of honors
theses written, said Ramon Saldi
var, vice provost for undergraduate
education.
But Bender said he thought stu
dents had no problem handling

both majors and research.
Also, since 25 percent of stu
dents elect to double-major,
departments feel pressured to
design their programs in the con
text of two majors — to the detri
ment of the program, said Dean of
Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven.
With the new minor will come
the need for new advising, Shoven
said.
Bender and others also criti

cized the universal requirement of
minors in all Humanities and Sci
ences departments.
"In some departments, a small
number of courses might not be
significant enough ... to get over
an adequate threshold of knowl
edge," said Philosophy Prof.
Michael Bratman.
But fairness compels minors to
be offered in every subject, Shoven
said. He also said requiring minors
universally will ease advising.
