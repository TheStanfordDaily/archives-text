# W grade makes its mark
## Students may still be unsure of new policy's effect

Not yet as feared as Hester
Prynne's scarlet "A," the letter
"W," which signifies "withdrew"
on a student's transcript, has
nonetheless made its presence
felt on the Stanford campus.
While in previous years stu
dents had until the day before the
final exam to drop a class, this
year students who withdraw
from a course after the fourth
week of the quarter will receive a
W notation on their records.
For this autumn quarter, only
about one-eighth of all students
who dropped classes did so after
the four-week deadline. Out of a
total of 13,388 registered stu
dents, 325 undergraduates and
graduates withdrew after the
fourth week of classes — com
pared to 2,256 who withdrew be
fore the fourth week and received
no notation on their transcripts.
