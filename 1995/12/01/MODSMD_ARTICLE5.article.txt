# W grade makes its mark
## Students may still be unsure of new policy's effect

Not yet as feared as Hester
Prynne's scarlet "A," the letter
"W," which signifies "withdrew"
on a student's transcript, has
nonetheless made its presence
felt on the Stanford campus.
While in previous years stu
dents had until the day before the
final exam to drop a class, this
year students who withdraw
from a course after the fourth
week of the quarter will receive a
W notation on their records.
For this autumn quarter, only
about one-eighth of all students
who dropped classes did so after
the four-week deadline. Out of a
total of 13,388 registered stu
dents, 325 undergraduates and
graduates withdrew after the
fourth week of classes — com
pared to 2,256 who withdrew be
fore the fourth week and received
no notation on their transcripts.

This apparent fear of the W
could be attributed to the negative
connotations of the new grading
policy, said Heidi Hwong, head stu
dent coordinator for advising asso
ciates.
"Students have expressed con
cern about the W," Hwong said.
"They just don't know what the
feedback on the change is going to
be."
While the consequences of the W
are still uncertain, administrators
said they believe that the "with
drew" notation is not going to be
very detrimental to a student's
future.
"I don't think one or two W's are
going to adversely affect the stu
dents' future goals," said Hector
Cuevas, director of the Undergrad
uate Advising Center.
Geology Prof. Gail Mahood,
chair of the Faculty Senate, added
that a small number of W's on a
student's transcript would only
indicate that he or she had been
overloaded that quarter. As chair of

the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement,
Mahood spearheaded the move
ment to change the grading policy
to include the Win June 1994.
However, she added, "You have
to start to worry about a student
who has 10 'withdraws* on his
transcript. It shows the person not
to be a good judge of his time."
According to a report from the
Registrar's Office, the majority of
students who dropped this quarter
only dropped one or two classes.
In addition, the Registrar's
Office reported that more juniors
and seniors than freshmen and
sophomores waited until after the
fourth week to drop. Because this is
the first year of the policy's imple
mentation, Cuevas and Mahood
said they could only speculate on
this phenomenon.
Cuevas said he thinks the cours
es' difficulty could play a role in the
juniors' and seniors' decisions.
"Because juniors and seniors are
taking more in-depth courses in
their majors, they might want to
withdraw, while freshmen and
sophomores are taking more lower
level, introductory courses,"
Cuevas explained.

On the other hand, Mahood
believes that freshmen and sopho
mores have many required courses
"you know you've got to take" such
as Cultures, Ideas and Values, so it
would be unwise for them to drop
them. In contrast, juniors and
seniors have many electives they
can easily drop without severe ram
ifications, Mahood said.
The report from the Registrar's
Office also showed that undergrad
uates withdrew more than twice as
often as did graduate students.
According to Mahood, graduate
students usually take classes half
time, with research projects taking
up the other half of their course
load.
"They just don't have as many
opportunities to withdraw,"
Mahood said.
Whatever the reasons that stu
dents withdrew, Cuevas and
Mahood said they felt the new poli
cy would aflect Stanford's notori
ous policy of grade inflation. In the
past, the majority of Stanford stu
dents have received A's and B's.
"While one can only speculate,
(the policy 1 could have a tendency
to distribute grades more on the
grade scale," Cuevas said.
