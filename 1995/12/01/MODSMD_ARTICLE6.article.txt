# Equal access: high-tech help for disabled

You may have noticed J.B.
Galan's work while surfing
around the Internet. As assistant
researcher at the Archimedes Pro
ject, Galan is responsible for creat
ing the project's World Wide Web
site. What may not be apparent is
that Galan is paralyzed from the
shoulders down.
He and others with various dis
abilities are part of the
Archimedes Project, an ongoing
research effort at Stanford's Cen
ter for the Study of Language and
Information (CSLI) to create
equal access to information
through technological advance
ment.
A demonstration held yester
day in Cordura Hall showed the
various new technologies that
Archimedes has developed to aid
the disabled in communicating
with computers.
The project employs such de
vices as head and eye trackers,
brain-wave sensors and voice
recognition. Galan, who was para
lyzed by a diving accident at 16,
simply says what he wants to
write. If he wants to open an appli
cation, he moves his head in the
right direction and says, "double
click."
Equality of access is at the heart
of what Archimedes is trying to
achieve. According to CSLI re
searcher Betsy Macken, the pro-

ject co-leader, they chose the name
Archimedes based on the classic
Greek scientist's statement, "Give
meaplace to stand, and I will move
the world." The program has been
giving the disabled a place to stand
in the growing computer industry
for the last 12 years.
The most important innovation

developed by Archimedes is the
Total Access System. Designed by
chief engineer Neil Scott, the other
project co-leader, the system al
lows any disabled person to use
any computer without major i iffi
culty.
It has three parts: an individual
accessor which researchers hope

to make hand-held, an interface to
a host computer or computer
based device and a standardized
link connecting them. The inter
face is called the Total Access Port,
and according to Scott, 300 to 400
people currently own one.

J.B. Galan, class of '95, demonstrates new technology developed by the Archimedes Project at the
Center for the Study of Language and Information, which allows him to control computers through
movement of his head and speech.
