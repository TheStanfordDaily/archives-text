# FRI students picket outside Building 10

### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
About 20 students from the
Food Research Institute continued
their campaign to save the depart
ment yesterday, picketing all day in
front of University President Ger
hard Casper's office.
In light of today's University Ad
visory Board meeting with the Aca
demic Council to discuss the issue,
the students have renewed their ef
forts to fight a recommendation by
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
John Shoven to close the 74-year
old institute.
At its last meeting, the board
postponed its decision on the insti
tute's fate until today.
The protest continues a string of
actions taken by students, faculty,
staff and alumni of the institute
since Shoven's announcement last
month that he would recommend
the institute be transformed into an
interdisciplinary research center,
while the doctoral program would
be cut and the master's program
would merge into International
Policy Studies.
Second-year doctoral student
Eddy Niesten said Casper's office
was a logical location for protest be
cause Casper will make the recom
mendation that comes after the
board's decision.
Closure of the institute would
need to be approved by the Board of

Trustees, which meets next week.
Niesten said he was disappointed
Casper didn't speak with protesters.
"We've tried repeatedly and told
him we think it's only appropriate
that he talk to some of the students
affected by this decision," Niesten
said. "But so far he's refused."
Students at the protest said they
wanted to stir things up before
today's meeting.
"We just wanted to indicate that
we're still very concerned," said
Eleni Gabre-Madhin, a third-year
doctoral student.
"It's important for them to know
we haven't given up, that we still be
lieve in the institution," said fourth
year doctoral student Liz Robinson.
Robinson spent the past four
months doing field research in India
for her degree, cut off from the
events here. She returned two
weeks ago, on the day of a 24-hour
fast by institute students.
"I was impressed but not sur
prised by the show of strength....
The students and the faculty had
held together," Robinson said.
As for returning in the midst of a
controversy, she said, "I was
shocked it came to such a front."
The "front" may have shocked
administrators involved with the
decision, too, Niesten said.
Because the institute is a small
department, "they thought they
could do this relatively quietly," he
said. "That's not the case."
