Test Prep Giant Killer
Invades Palo Alto
In 1990, Boston law yer and educator Leslie
Gretfenius challenged test prep Goliaths,
Kaplan and Princeton, and created The Olin
Center. Offering test prep courses in GRE,
GMAT, LSAI, SAI, and TOEFI, the Boston
school charges dramatically less than its
competitors, only **$370 for a 30-hour
program. Yet the results are remarkable. Now,
The Olin Center has come to Language
Pacitica on California Avenue in Palo Alto.
**$345 for Stanford students.
