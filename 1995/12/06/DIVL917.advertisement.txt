Any Major Welcome
Internet Profiles Corporation is seeking highly motivated candidates
to help us continue to build, market, and sell the Webs premier
Web Measurement and Analysis System.
We have immediate openings in marketing, sales, engineering, and customer
service. Any major may apply, but you must be self-motivated, organized,
and detail-oriented. Most important, you must have a strong desire to work
in a dynamic industry and be ready to deal with a fast paced work environ
ment. I/PRO offers you the chance to get in on the ground floor of what
promises to be a huge and exciting industry. Plus, since we are a recent
start-up, you will have the chance to handle challenges and opportunities
you would only make copies of at an older institution.
