For years, I have been saying that the U.S. BUDGET CANNOT
BE BALANCED OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME
IN THE ABSENCE OF A TRADE SURPLUS. The last time the
U.S. balanced its budget over a 5 year period was 1930. And at that
time we had a trade surplus.
CHALLENGE to all economists and proponents of a balanced
budget: $300,000 to the first person who explains why the article
"Analyzing the Economy with Poker" is incorrect in a broad sense.
This article, which is available without charge by calling 800-666-
3903 or writing to Box 7634, Beverly Hills, CA 90212, explains that
a) there are three types of wealth: real assets, stocks, and net non-stock
financial assets. Focusing on net non-stock financial assets, b) above
average income Americans must increase net non-stock financial assets
each year in order to have a substantial incentive to produce and
innovate, c) this "win" must come at the expense of either the below
average income class, the U.S. Government, or foreigners, d) since we
are running a current account deficit (losing to foreigners), and the
below-average income class has limited resources, the only entity that
can "keep losing indefinitely" to fund the needed gains of the above
average income class is the Government. In other words, balance the
budget for a prolonged period in the absence of a current account surplus
and Americans will not increase net non-stock financial assets after
taxes and will have little incentive to produce and innovate. With less
incentive, production of real assets would decline, as would in all
probability, stock prices. So the best way to attack budget deficit growth
is to try to improve the trade deficit. It is no accident that most world
governments have been running deficits for many years. If world
governments as a group ran a balanced budget, the world-non
government sector could not increase net-non-stock financial assets
and would have much less incentive to produce and innovate.
