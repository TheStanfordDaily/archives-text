ONE ALCOHOL DRINK
CAN ALTER YOUR BRAIN
PERMANENTLY
According to the 18th Annual Neuroscience Conference: there are only 100,000
brain cells in the tiny basal forebrain, located in the center of your brain, that create
the memory-coordination chemical Acetycholine.
Consume one alcohol drink and some of these brain cells could be destroyed.
Your memory and coordination capability impaired. Some alcoholic's brains weigh
30% less. Their brain cells removed by alcohol.
Less memory capability for the rest of your life. Less Acetylchline created.
NEVER DRINK ALCOHOL
TO GAIN A SUPERIOR BRAIN
Alcohol also damages the liver's ability to make the chemical Lecithin, which is
used by the brain to make the important neurotransmitter Acetylcholine. Alcohol
also depletes nutrients needed to make other neurotransmitters. Proper nutrition
ensures a proper functioning brain. Many feelings of beauty, wonder, nature and
truth, are only available to non-damaged brains.
Alcohol increases Acetylcholine by releasing existing supplies within the body.
Alcohol's effect is short lived, then a depletion exists, which causes slower thought,
less memory, worse coordination.
Lecithin Granules and capsules (made from Soybeans) are available at health
Food stores. Mix 3-6 tablespoons of Lecithin and 1-3 tablespoons of vinegar (which
is acetic acid) with a beverage, to make a BRAIN NUTRIENT DRINK, to replace
alcohol. A safe way to increase your brain level of Acetylcholine for more memory
power, greater verbal ability, better coordination. Good nutrition ensures optimum
performance from your brain.
BE A KNURD. NEVER GET DRUNK.
DON'T BOOZE AND CRUISE.
REST OR SLEEP IN CAR. TAKE TAXI.
HAVE A SOBER FRIEND DRIVE.
