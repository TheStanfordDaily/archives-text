# More consolidation ahead
## Engineering plan accepted by board 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
In the second major depart
mental restructuring announced
this year, the Advisory Board of
the Academic Council voted Fri
day to accept Engineering School
Dean James Gibbons' proposal to
consolidate the Operations Re
search and Engineering-Econom
ics Systems Departments.
"We thought the proposal
was sound and there was an op
portunity here to combine two
departments in a way that will
improve both of them," said
Psychology Prof. Amos Tversky,
chair of the board. "Operations
Research has a more theoretical
bent. EES has more of an ap
plied bent. . . . Putting them to
gether will make stronger . . .
departments."
Operations research students

learn how to analyze and use
mathematical models to under
stand decision-making problems.
EES students learn to apply engi
neering principles to problem
solving.
Operations Research Chair
Richard Cottle said that while only
time will tell if the merger is suc
cessful, it has "the makings of
something great."
According to Cottle, the merger
is motivated by the small size of the
two 28-year-old departments, the
existence of some course overlap
and the desire to create an under
graduate degree program — some
thing which neither department
currently offers.
"The primary motivation is to
ensure the survival of each by coa
lescing into a larger department,"
he said.
