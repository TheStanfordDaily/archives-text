# More consolidation ahead
## Engineering plan accepted by board 
### September Treviño Staff writer 
In the second major depart
mental restructuring announced
this year, the Advisory Board of
the Academic Council voted Fri
day to accept Engineering School
Dean James Gibbons' proposal to
consolidate the Operations Re
search and Engineering-Econom
ics Systems Departments.
"We thought the proposal
was sound and there was an op
portunity here to combine two
departments in a way that will
improve both of them," said
Psychology Prof. Amos Tversky,
chair of the board. "Operations
Research has a more theoretical
bent. EES has more of an ap
plied bent. . . . Putting them to
gether will make stronger . . .
departments."
Operations research students

learn how to analyze and use
mathematical models to under
stand decision-making problems.
EES students learn to apply engi
neering principles to problem
solving.
Operations Research Chair
Richard Cottle said that while only
time will tell if the merger is suc
cessful, it has "the makings of
something great."
According to Cottle, the merger
is motivated by the small size of the
two 28-year-old departments, the
existence of some course overlap
and the desire to create an under
graduate degree program — some
thing which neither department
currently offers.
"The primary motivation is to
ensure the survival of each by coa
lescing into a larger department,"
he said.
He was quick to point out that
the proposed consolidation is very
different from that facing the
Food Research Institute and the
International Policy Studies pro
gram, saying that the merger is
not expected to provoke layoffs
and does not face organized oppo
sition.
"We're not about to have a
hunger strike," said Cottle.
"There is no question of the fact
that there will be a merger. Every
effort is being made to implement
this in the correct way."
"We do have differences of
opinion I but 1 we're doing our best
to approach it optimistically,"

said Cottle. "We all feel we're
doing it for the sake of the stu
dents."
Cottle added that while talk of
consolidating the two depart
ments has gone on for many
years, serious discussion began
about two years ago.
"Even though we have been
moving slowly, there have been
steps taken," said Cottle. A year
ago, the two departments consol
idated their administrative staffs,
sharing (he same department sec
retary, student services manager
and general information officer.
Last fall, the two departments
were placed under a common
budget. Both, however, have
maintained separate chairs.
Despite past moves toward
consolidation, Cottle said a major
"bone of contention" between

EES and operations research is a
dispute over what the new
department should be called. No
agreement has yet been reached
on that issue.
"A lot of people put store in the
department's name or what their
degree says," said Cottle. "We
feel we have a market, and we
want to make sure that market is
served."
Assoc. EES Prof. Samuel Chiu
echoed Cottle's concerns, adding
that the EES Department is sen
sitive to concerns of alumni who
may be averse to any name
changes.
Despite initial reservations
surrounding the proposed merg
er, however, Chiu said he believes
that together the two depart
ments "would be able to make a
bigger impact upon the outside

world." He suggested that more
research opportunities and new
programs would be products of
consolidation.
"In the long run, it's a good
thing to do," he said. ".Joint
resources can be allocated in a
better way."
Cottle said the departments are
currently working to redesign the
requirements within their gradu
ate programs. Staff and adminis
trators from both EES and opera
tions research hope to create a
common master's program.
One proposal for a master's
program includes offering a set of
10 courses divided into five sub
ject areas. If approved, students
would be required to take six out
of 10 courses and to fulfill four
out of five areas.
"We are hoping to build some

thing with lots of flexibility," said
Cottle, adding that the idea is to
provide common guidelines while
allowing students the room to
explore their individual interests.
Merger coordinators have yet
to discuss the design of the new
department's doctoral program
or programs.
Cottle said final plans for the
merger should be in place by the
end of this academic year and will
be ready for implementation by
next fall. He added, however, that
new course requirements would
apply to entering students and
should not affect current or con
tinuing master's or doctoral stu
dents.
Discussion concerning the
design of the new department's
bachelor's program is slated to
begin next year.
