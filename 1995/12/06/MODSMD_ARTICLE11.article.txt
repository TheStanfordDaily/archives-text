# Trustees divert funds for repairs
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
The Board of Trustees approved a plan to liquidate
a $9 million earthquake insurance reserve fund and
use the money to pay for repairs and seismic strength
ening at its regular December meeting, held over the
past two days.
Board committees also approved an expansion of
the Stanford stadium parking lot; received updates
about progress on the Science and Engineering Quad
and Graduate School of Business construction plans;
and heard a report on the activities of the Alumni
Association.
According to John Friedenrich, chair of the board,
the insurance fund was created about 10 years ago in
order to buy earthquake insurance.
Over time, the fund has appreciated to $9 million,
said Vice Provost for Institutional Planning and
Financial Affairs Geoff Cox.
However, the money was never used because "the
rate and the level of the deductibles was so high, it was
deemed not to be economical" to buy the insurance,
Friedenrich said.
The l>oard has now decided to appropriate the
earthquake money for reconstruction and structural
strengthening projects.
"Since we have had an earthquake and we needed
money for repairs, it was deemed okay to use [the
insurance reserve] for repairs," Friedenrich said.
In the future, the University may decide to pur

chase insurance if the rates become more attractive,
Friedenrich said. However, Cox said he thought that
was unlikely to happen.
"Insurance companies are not going to sell us
insurance that is cost-effective for the facilities we
want to cover," Cox said. "The best thing for Stanford
to do is strengthen buildings and do repairs.'
In other board action, Cox said the Committee on
Lands and Buildings approved a plan to improve the
parking lot between the Sunken Diamond and the
Stanford Stadium. A presentation given to the board
placed the project's budget at $1.75 million.
Cox said he also updated the committee about the
progress on the design of the Science and Engineering
Quad, the new complex to be built with a $77.4 million
donation from William Hewlett and David Packard.
"The architects are continuing their work," Cox
said. "The architects have been working on the design
for several months. The buildings are continuing to
evolve. The design phase comes to an end in January.
Then the working drawings are begun."
Cox told the committee about the progress on the
construction of the new Graduate School of Busi
ness Residential Learning Center. Clearing of the
site for construction will begin during winter break,
Cox said.
Although the full board ten)k no action, the Com
mittee on Alumni and External Affairs also heard
reports about alumni issues and Stanford's relations
with the government, said Alumni Association Presi
dent William Stone.
