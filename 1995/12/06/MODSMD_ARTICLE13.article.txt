Korean president indicted
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The scene has become all too famil
iar: A prosecutor takes to live television with an announcement that
shakes public confidence in the country's most powerful people.
This time, it was expected, but no less shocking. Former President
Roh Tae-woo, four aides and a dozen top businessmen were indicted
yesterday in a bribes-for-favors scandal.
The aftershocks l>egan immediately with the No. 2 man in the rul
ing Democratic Liberal Party offering to resign — a move that was a
virtual revolt against President Kim Young-sam and threatens to
break apart the ruling party.
The potential defector, Kim Yoon-hwan, leads a strong regional
faction and is a friend of both Roh and former President Chun Doo
hwan, who was jailed Sunday in an unrelated case.
Alter meeting with the president, Kim Yoon-hwan withdrew the
offer, but it likely only delayed the split.
His followers rejxirtedly have asked him to quit with them. One is
expected to announce a breakaway today, with others to follow suit.
