# Bosnia braces to meet NATO force

### 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegov
ina (AP) — It's happening again. A
big Western army is descending on
a mortally wounded nation and into
the middle of a fragile web of wary
relief agencies.
As they did in Somalia, Rwanda
and Haiti, humanitarian groups are
bracing for the impact of the
60,000-member NATO force on the
Bosnian landscape. To them, such
armies rattle a double-edged saber.
Many expect the NATO force to
change the dynamics of a very com
plex place — from fragile relation
ships forged with the combatants to
the movement of refugees across
the rugged, snowy landscape.
The biggest fear is that 80,000
Bosnian Serbs estimated to Ik? liv
ing on the fringes of Sarajevo will
flee en masse when those territo

ries are turned over to the Muslim-
Croat federation under terms of the
Dayton peace pact.
The lied Cross is earmarking
emergency aid to cope with the pos
sibility that tens of thousands of
Bosnian Serbs will trek across the
brutally cold mountain passes ring
ing Sarajevo, said agency
spokesman Beat Schweizer.
Some relief workers fear private
ly that the Bosnian Serb leaders
will use women and children to
block the U.S.-led force from
enforcing the accord in the sub
urbs, a tactic employed previously
against U.N. peacekeepers.
There also are worries that a
pocket of 55,000 Bosnian Muslims
in the town of Goradze, a brutalized
enclave surrounded by Serb territo
ry, will flee to Sarajevo along a cor

ridor to be opened under terms of
the accord.
The U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees is opening an office in
the Serb suburb of Ilidza this week
purely to open dialogue. Catholic
Relief Services has one worker, a
Serb, in Ilidza, but Roath said the
worker is uncertain whether she
herself will flee when NATO
arrives.
What the relief groups want is
access to the superior communica
tions, logistics and intelligence
capabilities of NATO, without the
often disastrously muddled
attempts at help that the present
U.N. force provided.
"We'd like them to assist but not
impede," said Stephen O'Malley,
head of a Doctors Without Borders
operation in Sarajevo.

Unlike the U.N. Protection
Force it replaces, NATO will not
mix humanitarian work with mili
tary work — dueling goals that
more often than not confused the
U.N. mission.
"It's not like UNPROFOR,
always trying to interfere in
humanitarian efforts to improve its
image," said Schweizer.
Per Byman, Balkan project offi
cer for the Swedish branch of the
relief group Caritas, said he expects
roads and communications to open
up with NATO's arrival. He said he
already has seen signs that some
local military officials, some with
civilian blood on their hands, are
becoming more cooperative as they
await the arrival of NATO.
In Bosnia, nobody knows yet
what effect a foreign force will have.
