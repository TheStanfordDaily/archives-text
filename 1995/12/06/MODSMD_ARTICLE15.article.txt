# Budget talks begin to budge

WASHINGTON (AP) — In the first hint of
movement at the budget talks, White House offi
cials and Democratic congressional leaders said yes
terday they are preparing a seven-year budget-bal
ancing plan that could be presented to Republicans
later this week.
Democrats were still making final decisions
about the proposal, which would alter a 10-year
budget-balancing outline President Clinton
unveiled in June.
An administration official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said that compared to the plan the
president proposed six months ago, the package
would likely call for a smaller tax cut and a possible
delay in its $500 per child tax credit, bigger tax loop
hole closers on businesses, smaller spending boosts
for many domestic programs, and more savings
from welfare.
Closed-door sessions began their second week
yesterday as bargainers met for more than an hour.
But once again no agreements were reached. The
White House prepared to present its plan later this
week, possibly tommorrow, for saving $124 billion
from Medicare.
"We probably won't like what they come up
with," said Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-
Kan., who said he spoke to Clinton by telephone
yesterday about the Democratic plan. "At least
that's what he told me. But that's at least a start."
Republicans have insisted that bargaining can

not go very far until Democrats produce a detailed
seven-year plan to eliminate the deficit. The GOP
pushed its own seven-year package through
Congress last month, containing deeper cuts and
bigger tax reductions than Clinton prefers. The
president is likely to veto it this week.
Democrats said they hoped their plan's presenta
tion would force Republicans to reveal how they
would protect Clinton's top priorities — Medicare,
Medicaid, education and environment programs —
from slashes he considers draconian.
Despite the potential for progress, there was a
signal the talks could well miss their Dec. 15 dead
line. The bargainers were told yesterday that the
Congressional Budget Office's economic estimates
would not be available until at least Dec. 12. Those
economic estimates will be used to measure the
deficit and the savings negotiators propose. The
budget office said in a letter that the work "has
proved to be more complex than usual."
One immediate point of contention was sure to
be the economic projections on which the White
House plan is based. White House officials, speak
ing on condition of anonymity, said the measure
was based on estimates by their own Office of Man
agement and Budget. Its forecasts are more opti
mistic than those by the CBO and would require
$475 billion less in savings to eliminate the deficit,
though the updated CBO numbers are expected to
narrow that gap.
