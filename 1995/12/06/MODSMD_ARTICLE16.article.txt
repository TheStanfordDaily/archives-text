Outside agitators who arrived at the end of an otherwise peaceful demonstration by French unions
and students overturn cars yesterday in Paris. Several hundred hooligans smashed store win
dows and burned cars. The earlier trade union demonstration was to protest the French govern
ment's plan to overhaul the welfare system.
