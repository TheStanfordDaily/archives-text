## Editorials Re-examine OSA role 
### 
The various factions
within the ASSU Senate have
finally joined forces. Standing
up to Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe's decree allowing Uni
versity committees to appoint their
own student members in direct vio
lation of the ASSU Constitution,
the senate is to be commended for
showing true backbone and fighting
for student rights.
It's about time.
Hopefully, the senate has also
finally realized that the only way
it's going to accomplish anything
(and redeem itself in the eyes of a
student population which predom
inantly sees it as irrelevant) is to
grow beyond petty infighting and
work together.
While Howe's actions have pro
voked a positive reaction, this does
not excuse her deed — ends do not
justify means. And, unfortunately,
this is not the first time Howe has
exercised such unilateral power
over the ASSU. This last act of dis

regard and disrespect for the poli
cies and integrity of the ASSU
calls into question her proper role
in student affairs.
The senate must build on its new
found unity — it's time to re-evalu
ate the role and relationship of both
Nanci Howe and the Office of Stu
dent Activities to the ASSU. Right
now, Howe sits at the top of a com
munications pyramid as the main
conduit for the passage of informa
tion between students and the
administration, a set-up which in
the past has proven to be dangerous.
The senate should create a bi
partisan committee charged with
researching the history and the
overall effectiveness of the Office
of Student Activities, both in its
responsibilities to the senate and
as the administrative and advisory
body for all student groups on
campus.
At this juncture, it may be a
good idea for the University to
undertake the same re-evaluation.
