# ASSU shares blame
## 
### 
WHILE THE administrative
actions taken last week
may be questionable, it is
not acceptable for the senate to turn
the Office of Student Activities into
a scapegoat for the Nominations
Commission fiasco. The senate and
the Council of Presidents must use
this as an opportunity to clean
house themselves, without pointing
fingers else whore.
A letter in last Friday's Daily
from 22 members of the ASSU lead
ership blames late notification by
"the administration" for the recent
scandal. "The scramble to appoint
students to the [Comparative Stud
ies in Race and Ethnicity] commit
tee given the short timeline resulted
in the ensuing confusion and ques
tionable methodology of the nomi
nations process," the letter reads.
"This disregard of the value of stu
dent input is intolerable."
What is truly intolerable is this
kind of whining. Why did none of the
people involved in dealing with these

administrators complain about stu
dent disregard before Scott Wein
traub's resignation? Since when
does the ASSU senate bow quietly to
so-called administrative mandates?
The facts in this case — while far
from clear — strongly indicate that
rules were broken, or at least bent,
by ASSU leaders. Blaming adminis
trators for students' lack of ethics is
juvenile and irresponsible.
The senate has already moved
ahead with the nominating process.
While this is a good step, the ASSU
leadership shouldn't act too quickly
to sweep this one under the rug.
Those in power within the ASSU
leadership need to realize that it's
important to set the right example,
even if it means addressing some
unpleasant truths. If they want to
be treated as responsible leaders by
the rest of this community — and
particularly by administrators —
the senate should stop whining and
start figuring out what went wrong
within its own organization.
