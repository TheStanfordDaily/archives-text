After a week
of turmoil, the
ASSU Senate
passed four
Nominations
Commission
bills last night,
appointing stu
dents to various
University com-

mittees.
Both the Nom Comm-1 bill,
which appointed students to the
Committee on Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity, and Nom
Comrn-4, which appointed students
to the Committee on Public Events,
were passed unanimously.
At the start of debate, Council of
Presidents member Mike Choo ex
plained why the nominations made

by former commission chair Scott
Weintraub needed to be re-exam
ined.
"He set up no criteria for choos
ing students, he conducted the in
terviews completely on his own and
the deadline for applications wasn't
made clear," Choo said.
COP member Nicole Vazquez
explained that the temporary com
mission set up new criteria for ap
plicants. She added that they were
unable to re-interview all the stu
dents Weintraub interviewed be
cause he refused to make the infor
mation — the students' names and
phone numbers — available to the
new commission.
The temporary commission —
which was formed to make appoint
ments after Weintraub's resigna
tion and consisted of Vazquez, COP

member Rich Stolz and four
senators — maintained Wein
traub's appointments with the
exception of his CSRE slate, on
which two students were
replaced.
"When we redefined the cri
teria, we realized that there
were others who were much
more qualified," said Vazquez.
"We felt qualifications were
more important than consisten
cies."
The senate also approved
students to the Alcohol Task
Force and the Greek Affairs
Task Force — keeping the stu
dents whom Weintraub had
selected and then adding two
more to each committee to
ensure well-rounded represen
tation.
The committee added stu
dents from housed fraternities
to the Greek Affairs Task Force
and a resident assistant to the
Alcohol Task Force.
In other business, the senate
passed a measure to oppose the

Simpson bill, which is currently
being debated in the U.S. Sen
ate.
The bill affects foreign stu
dents' ability to stay in the
United States to work by plac
ing a three-year limit on the
time a student can hold a cer
tain type of visa.
It would also force foreign
students in the United States to
return to their native countries
to work for three years before
applying for their green card.
The bill would also make
employers of legal aliens pay a
tax.
"This bill has serious ramifi
cations for many graduate stu
dents," said undergraduate sen
ator Bill Shen. "It is an assault
on students and workers com
ing to this country to become
part of our work force."
In new business, undergrad
uate senator Andre Vanier, who
had planned to form an ethics
committee to look into the
recent Nominations Commis
sion controversy, proposed
instead that Choo formally
apologize to Weintraub. The
senate voted down the resolu
tion after limited debate.
