Pearson clarifies issue of alumni 'disaffection ?

THE DAILY HAS recently printed
articles about why alumni do or do
not make financial contributions to
Stanford. As director of opinion research,
I was hired to report on this matter.
While it may be understandable —
especially after a decade of social change
reflected in the University's policies and
student body — to assume that many
alumni would withhold gifts because they
are alienated from Stanford and upset
with the direction it is taking, this proves
to be a false assumption. Instead, the
data collected suggest that the alumni (of
all ages) are disengaged from, rather than
disaffected with, the University.
Although some alumni will always feel
that Stanford has become either too liber
al or too conservative, the research clear
ly indicates that only a very small per
centage of alumni feel that Stanford has

drifted far from its traditional or ethical
moorings. Most alumni appreciate that
the world is changing and that the Uni
versity must change with it. What they
want is reassurance that Stanford is
managing the changes in a thoughtful
and judicious fashion and not just react
ing to political whim.
It is clear from both qualitative and
quantitative data that few alumni choose
not to give because they feel that Stan
ford "has abandoned the values I sup
port," that it "no longer promotes open
discourse and free exploration of ideas,"
or that it has lost sight of its mission and
"lacks a vision of what it wants to be."
Furthermore, while many Americans feel
that most of their institutions are rife
with waste and inefficiency, an almost
negligibly small percentage of alumni feel
that way about Stanford. Alumni do not

withhold their gifts for fear money will be
mismanaged or wasted on bureaucracy
and non-essential programs.
Rather, most alumni indicate that
they do not support or remain involved
with Stanford because Stanford is not
sufficiently involved with them. Too few
alumni feel that they are still an impor
tant part of the University community.
Those who do are much more likely to
support Stanford financially because they
recognize Stanford's contributions to
society and its ongoing needs.
While Stanford is ill-advised to plead
poverty, it can nonetheless demonstrate
that alumni gifts have a direct impact
both on individuals and on society and
how we live. Indeed the reasons alumni
find most compelling for giving are those
that suggest what their contributions
enable Stanford to do for others — by

helping assure future students have the
same opportunity they had.
Although it is reassuring to know that
the vast majority of alumni are not disil
lusioned or angry with Stanford, this
knowledge underscores a more daunting
challenge for Stanford: negative percep
tions can be more readily addressed, but
there is no quick fix for a disengaged con
stituency. To meet this challenge suc
cessfully, Stanford may need to play a
more active and relevant role in the lives
of its alumni, providing them with mean
ingful ways to play an active role in the
life of the University. Fortunately, many
alumni who now feel ignored or excluded
are eager to once again have a personal
stake in the university that they, in fact,
care deeply about.
