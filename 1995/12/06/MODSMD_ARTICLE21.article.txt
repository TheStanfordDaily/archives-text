# Student says that ethnic groups on campus must not live in isolation

### 
I believe that the various Asian-Amer
ican groups need to examine why their
respective groups were founded in the
first place. I ask all members to examine
the racist events happening now and
temper their activities with common
sense.
The Asian American Students Associ
ation (AASA) was founded at Stanford to
provide a common ground for a true
minority who was, although not subject

ed to harsh racism, excluded from day
to-day society in a subtle or blatant man
ner. Now, the Asian-American communi
ty is large and strong, but we must take
care not to become racists ourselves (I
recently spoke to a Caucasian woman
who tried to join AASA, but found it
very isolating and closed-off).
Look at being Asian American as a
beautiful distinction that is to be shared
and understood. Our parents came to a
country that offers vast opportunities.
We are the generation who enjoy the
fruits of their back-breaking labor.
These are very fragile foundations that
can be destroyed with the passing of a
bill or the outbreak of racial tensions.
We must all work together to create a

peaceful existence with our European-
American, African-American, Latin-
American and mixed-heritage brothers
and sisters. If we isolate ourselves, we
ignore the fact that we live in a racist
society. It is silly to think
that racial tensions don't exist by boxing
ourselves inside little "Chinatowns" or
"Koreatowns" or "Japantowns" at Stan
ford. Let us keep AASA from becoming a
superficial country club and make it
flourish as an open-armed cultural
reserve open for all to explore. Let us
preserve our heritage while preserving
the America that allows us to be Asian
Americans.
