# Daily's W grade article didn't focus on real issue
## 
### 
The article in last Friday's issue of The
Daily on the W grade fails to prove any
effect on student behavior. While fewer
students dropped classes after the four
week deadline than before it, this behavior
has probably always been true. The prop
er question to ask is how this ratio differs
from last year's, when there was no late
drop penalty. The article makes no such
comparison, and so we cannot conclude
that the W grade has changed anything.
