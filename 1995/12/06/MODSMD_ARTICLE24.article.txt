## Speaking of relativity 
### 
WELL, I'M THE only columnist
you've got to read this week. I'm
sorry if that disappoints you,
but it feels good to me. REAL good. I
don't really know why. It's certainly not
because I think I will have more readers.
I doubt my ever-dwindling readership
will increase. If anything, I hope it will
be a boost to my plan to alienate all read
ers of Wednesday's page 4, so that I can
reach my ultimate goal in my final col
umn, which, if all goes well, absolutely
NO ONE will read.
Surprised by my teleological intent?
What I write here is just an explicit ren
dering of what has been between the
lines of all my previous columns. I only
wrote this for those of you who are too
dense to pick it up yet this quarter.
I can't remember the first time I
cooked noodles. I've cooked so many, and
that's not a result of leading the typical
young bachelor's life. Even as a child, I
would make myself noodles. They were,
and still are, so good. A simple pleasure.
Sometime in my past, I learned to
make noodles. Since then, I've been able
to cook noodles. It's quite simple — the
water reaches a readiness point and just
dump them on in. The noodles cook,
then when they're ready, I remove
them.
I also don't know who taught me. I
imagine someone must have taught me.
How could noodle cooking have been a

skill already there with me when I was
born? My philosopher friend was arguing
the other night with Gelb, a neighbor, at
a dinner party. I was also, for some
unknown reason, at the party. He was
saying that when I was born, I had the
possibility to do anything. He's so posi
tivist.
I asked him, "How can I be the Pope,
as a non-practicing agnostic?" Nick, the
philosopher, was really drunk. He passed
out a few minutes later without answer
ing. To him, I'm sure the future didn't
seem like such a feat. If I had been old
enough to fight in Vietnam (like him), I
would have ... been born earlier.
I can't say anything, and Nick
deserves his pax. He's probably passed
out right now — a combination of alcohol
and dementia that is an integral part of
Vietnam Vet Syndrome. That's
respectable, I suppose. More respectable,
at least, than the Forgotten Everyman
Group / Individual Syndrome, which has
a terrible therapy group. I need a differ
ent group to help me remember the first
time I cooked noodles.
Let me end this with a quote from
Nick: "Even though I understand and
realize bow everything is relative, how
do I know what that word means? If
everything is relative, then the under
standing of that word must also be so.
My understanding of it and that
[Kazak's] are not the same, but relative.

It's related to our standpoints in the
world. But what if his understanding
(relative to mine, as I understand his
standpoint) is such that he cannot know
what relative means. I guess that is not
so bad, but then I think, what if other
people look at me in that way?
"If you think about how everything is
so relative, it gets kind of funky because
everything can just melt into a unity — a
oneness like all the hippie love druggers
rave about: 'It's all relative, man!' or
'It's all one big cosmic unity!' or 'Ques
tion reality!' If you tell me something is
relative, you say something is different
only because there is something else to
show it so. But from the big scope — the
grandfather glasses in the sky — every
thing looks the same. People, dogs,
smoke, nails, water, air, skin, love, hap
piness.
"It's all mashed together. All the same
in the same pot — a big stew. Sure, the
potatoes will look different than the
onions, and they will think and believe
different things and say that they are
individual, but it all gets eaten together.
It all ends up in the same stomach."
The CIV interpretation, is, of course, rel
ative. What you think Mr. Kazaks is try
ing to say is not, however.
