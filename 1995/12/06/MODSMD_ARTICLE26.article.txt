## 1995: The near miss of an almost year 
### 
1995 was a year of near misses. We
came so close to change, so many
times. Hut each time we approached
cool, we blew it.
It's true — we saw nothing real, only
almosts.
Prozac almost gave way to Zoloft.
Those nice people in Bosnia almost
stopped shooting each other. O.J. almost
got busted. 1 almost graduated.
Hurley almost dissed Hugh. Quebec
almost seceded. Gaieties almost made a
point. I almost co-termed.
1995: What were we thinking? Were
we thinking? In a time when anything
can happen, when everything wants to
happen, why couldn't we follow through?
1995: We came so close to unhooking
the Wonderhra of the millennium, but we
fumbled over the front snap.
1995: Only five short years before the
calendar calls for revolution. Somewhere
in Gilboa, the Messiah sits on a high
mountain top, pumping up his Reeboks
for a quick but high-impact jog through
our unpaved universe. . . . Yet we refused

to do our part of stirring up the stew of
society before all the icky fatty glops got
too comfortable floating on top.
A Batman movie almost captured the
character. Pierce Brosnan almost made a
good James Bond. Mulder almost had a
positive alien sighting of an alien. "Mar
ried With Children" almost got canceled,
finally.
Charles and Di almost cut the cord.
Cindy Lauper made an almost-successful
comeback. The Mariners almost actually
went somewhere. Michael Jackson
almost became a heterosexual.
1995: Blame it on El Nino, blame it on
your allergies, blame it on the rain. Noth
ing will change the perception of last year
as little more than a series of close calls
and half-assed attempts at the truly
remarkable.
Yup, taking a gander back at the last
12 semi-eventful months it seems the
only things that actually bothered to
change were that Stanford got in on
early decision and my sister got her
braces off.

It was a year of karma demurely
rebuffed, of destiny stylishly shirked, of
hesitation colored brightly. We slept
through our complementary wake-up
call. And our earth sits seething, waiting
for something interesting to happen.
San Francisco almost hired a lesbian
mayor. The country almost considered
not liking Clinton. The federal govern
ment almost went on strike when they
didn't get their way.
The Unabombcr almost exposed him
self. Almost no athletic teams stayed in
L.A. Dig Game almost wasn't boring.
1995: Look at that number. Look at
how close we are to the rounded 2000, to
the dreaded, mystical turn of the thou
sand.
Look at how the signs of the apoca
lypse are screaming in our ears like an
untalented but determined garage band
with an okay drummer. War. Famine.
Pestilence. Word 6.0. The four horsemen
are saddled up and waiting for that river
to turn to Red Dog.
And it's happening.

See the signs — it's undeniable. There
is more hunger than there is sex. There
are more diseases than there are doctors.
There are more WB sitcoms than there
are ex-childhood stars. There are more
talk shows than there are ex-fat people.
Yes, the earth is in the plateau phase
of redemption. And those blissful con
tractions are pending.
We almost saw peace in the Middle
East. New York became an almost safe
city. Miyake's almost actually moved to a
larger location.
America almost cared that religious
fanatics blew up Oklahoma. Norway
almost stopped killing all those cute
Willy-whales. A feminist conference
almost took place in Beijing. Farrakhan
almost made a point and almost a mil
lion men showed up to the Million Man
March.
1995: And we are still passionately
frightened of what we say we want. Like
a 14-year-old who fantasizes about his
math teacher but then runs off crying to
his lawyer once she tries to seduce him,

we are terrified of our own success.
Thus we must be honest and ask our
selves: Do we really even want change?
Perhaps we are a society that desires
but does not want — a class that yearns
for what it fears. To bask in complacency;
to stay in bed and watch Comedy Central
all day — nay, all year. Perhaps those
were '95's global goals.
Maybe this next year we'll do better.
Maybe in the upcoming 365 we'll develop
a taste for greatness, for becoming the
stuff of future memory. Maybe in '96 — a
69 with our backs turned — we'll see fit
to pull our minds from out of our cultur
al duodenum and to finish what we've
started.
Maybe, finally, we'll get to watch the
world transform some. Progress. Change.
And then maybe — when it's all over
and whatever kingdom of whatever heav
en is, as the saying goes, upon us — we
can look at one another and sigh.
And you can turn to me and you can
say, "Damn, we almost didn't make it."

Hurley almost dissed Hugh. Quebec
almost seceded. Gaieties almost made a
point. I almost co-termed.
1995: What were we thinking? Were
we thinking? In a time when anything
can happen, when everything wants to
happen, why couldn't we follow through?
1995: We came so close to unhooking
the Wonderhra of the millennium, but we
fumbled over the front snap.
1995: Only five short years before the
calendar calls for revolution. Somewhere
in Gilboa, the Messiah sits on a high
mountain top, pumping up his Reeboks
for a quick but high-impact jog through
our unpaved universe. . . . Yet we refused

to do our part of stirring up the stew of
society before all the icky fatty glops got
too comfortable floating on top.
A Batman movie almost captured the
character. Pierce Brosnan almost made a
good James Bond. Mulder almost had a
positive alien sighting of an alien. "Mar
ried With Children" almost got canceled,
finally.
Charles and Di almost cut the cord.
Cindy Lauper made an almost-successful
comeback. The Mariners almost actually
went somewhere. Michael Jackson
almost became a heterosexual.
1995: Blame it on El Nino, blame it on
your allergies, blame it on the rain. Noth
ing will change the perception of last year
as little more than a series of close calls
and half-assed attempts at the truly
remarkable.
Yup, taking a gander back at the last
12 semi-eventful months it seems the
only things that actually bothered to
change were that Stanford got in on
early decision and my sister got her
braces off.

It was a year of karma demurely
rebuffed, of destiny stylishly shirked, of
hesitation colored brightly. We slept
through our complementary wake-up
call. And our earth sits seething, waiting
for something interesting to happen.
San Francisco almost hired a lesbian
mayor. The country almost considered
not liking Clinton. The federal govern
ment almost went on strike when they
didn't get their way.
The Unabombcr almost exposed him
self. Almost no athletic teams stayed in
L.A. Dig Game almost wasn't boring.
1995: Look at that number. Look at
how close we are to the rounded 2000, to
the dreaded, mystical turn of the thou
sand.
Look at how the signs of the apoca
lypse are screaming in our ears like an
untalented but determined garage band
with an okay drummer. War. Famine.
Pestilence. Word 6.0. The four horsemen
are saddled up and waiting for that river
to turn to Red Dog.
And it's happening.

See the signs — it's undeniable. There
is more hunger than there is sex. There
are more diseases than there are doctors.
There are more WB sitcoms than there
are ex-childhood stars. There are more
talk shows than there are ex-fat people.
Yes, the earth is in the plateau phase
of redemption. And those blissful con
tractions are pending.
We almost saw peace in the Middle
East. New York became an almost safe
city. Miyake's almost actually moved to a
larger location.
America almost cared that religious
fanatics blew up Oklahoma. Norway
almost stopped killing all those cute
Willy-whales. A feminist conference
almost took place in Beijing. Farrakhan
almost made a point and almost a mil
lion men showed up to the Million Man
March.
1995: And we are still passionately
frightened of what we say we want. Like
a 14-year-old who fantasizes about his
math teacher but then runs off crying to
his lawyer once she tries to seduce him,

we are terrified of our own success.
Thus we must be honest and ask our
selves: Do we really even want change?
Perhaps we are a society that desires
but does not want — a class that yearns
for what it fears. To bask in complacency;
to stay in bed and watch Comedy Central
all day — nay, all year. Perhaps those
were '95's global goals.
Maybe this next year we'll do better.
Maybe in the upcoming 365 we'll develop
a taste for greatness, for becoming the
stuff of future memory. Maybe in '96 — a
69 with our backs turned — we'll see fit
to pull our minds from out of our cultur
al duodenum and to finish what we've
started.
Maybe, finally, we'll get to watch the
world transform some. Progress. Change.
And then maybe — when it's all over
and whatever kingdom of whatever heav
en is, as the saying goes, upon us — we
can look at one another and sigh.
And you can turn to me and you can
say, "Damn, we almost didn't make it."
