# A 						history of closure on the Farm
## FRI decision has precedent in previous department closures 
### Marni Leff Contributing writer 
While individuals in the Food Research Insti
tute may feel singled out by the recent Advisory
Board decision to close their department, the Uni
versity has gone through similar consolidations
several times before.
Layoffs, early retirement, angry alumni,
tenured professors getting sent to different
departments — these are the problems that pro
fessors and administrators remember as their
programs ended at Stanford. But in the long run,
they said, the community got used to the change.
The University's proposal to shut down the
internationally recognized Food Research Insti
tute is the first time in 10 years that Stanford has
made such a move.
Facing similar issues, the two most recent
departmental programs terminated at Stanford
were part of the Medical School: The department
of occupational and physical therapy closed in
1985, while the School of Nursing shut down in
1974. In 1971, the speech component of the
Speech and Drama Department was discontinued.
Spyros Andreopoulos, director emeritus of the
Medical Center communications office, attributed
the end of the physical therapy program — which
granted master's degrees and doctorates — to cut
backs made by the National Institutes of Health
(NIH). An outside committee was set up to look
into the program, he said.
"The conclusion was that the program wasn't
big enough or well enough thought of nationwide
to continue," Andreopoulos said.
As for departmental faculty, he added, "most of
the tenured people were approaching the age of
retirement anyway and the junior faculty got laid
off. It wasn't really unusual."
The decision to close the 77-year-old School of
Nursing, Andreopoulos recalled, was a more diffi
cult one. The School of Nursing granted both
master's degrees and doctorates.
"The program was of a very high quality,"
Andreopoulos explained. "It was agreed that the
school as it was, with such a small number of stu
dents, wasn't effective. Outside groups got
involved and in general the outside observations
were extremely positive.

"But to continue the program, the school need
ed more space," he said, "which would have cost
millions of dollars and so the decision was made to
close the school. There was a lot protest by the
former alumni, which comes as no surprise."
Alumni were the most upset by the decision,
agreed Dudley Kenworthy, the former director of
development at the Medical School who worked
closely with alumni from the School of Nursing at
the time it closed.
"When these things happen, there are two
forces at work," Kenworthy said. "The organiza
tional force, in the organizational context — and
that would be the dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences or the dean of the School of
Medicine — and the other side represents the
individuals: students, faculty, alumni. What I
recall in general is that, while well-intentioned,
the individuals were looking at it from an individ
ual point of view rather than seeing it as an insti
tutional issue." •
With the end of the school, Andreopoulos
recalled, tenured faculty members got compensat
ed through early retirement packages.
"The tenured faculty received benefits and
reimbursements," Andreopoulos said. "As I recall,
there were fairly hefty arrangements." He added
that junior faculty were laid off.
The end of the speech program in the Speech
and Drama Department again came because of
budget constraints, Drama Prof. Emeritus Helen
Schrader, then chair of the Speech Division of the
Speech and Drama Department, told The Daily in
1970. Ending the speech program meant ending
speech as a major and laying off four faculty mem
bers.
Prof. Emeritus Wendell Cole, who worked in
the department at the time, recalled, "The speech
program was broken into several pieces in differ
ent areas. Speech correction went to the medical
school and areas such as television, motion pic
tures and radio moved to [the Communication
Department], but none came to an end.
"In some ways, it was very good because the
Drama Department before was devoted to so
many various things that were somewhat related,
but not really," Cole said. "Splitting it up meant
all efforts were able to be concentrated much bet
ter."
