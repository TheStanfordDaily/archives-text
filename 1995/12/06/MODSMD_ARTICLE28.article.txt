# Students support Hing
## 
### Athima Chansanchai 
As Assoc. Prof. Bill Hing
awaits a recommendation on
where his future stands at Stan
ford, it is not unusual that stu
dents have voiced their support
on his behalf.
What is unusual is that stu
dents have so consistently stood
by the only Asian-American
Law School faculty member for
almost a year as he has gone
through an arduous process
which resulted in a tenure
application withdrawal in addi
tion to Hing's current wait on a
non-tenured appointment.
Although the faculty
appointments committee will
consider Hing using several cri
teria, students are hoping the
message they are sending is
clear: they want Hing to stay.
"He is a resource not only to
Asian-American students but
public interest law students,
students of color and other stu
dents," said Mary Wu, a second
year law student. "He has a
broad perspective, a humanistic
approach. In times like this, you
need people willing to step up to
the plate and find solutions."
Law School Dean Paul Brest
said that it is not unusual for a
professor to receive organized
student support when up for a
tenure or non-tenure line posi
tion but added that Hing, a spe
cialist in immigration and pub
lic interest law, has gotten "as
much (support) as anybody in
recent history."
Hing, who recently withdrew
his tenure application, is now
being considered for a non
tenured position, one of two
which must be decided by a
committee recommendation. He
would either be considered for a
senior lecturer position or as a
professoriate (teaching), also
called a parenthetical appoint
ment.
Brest said he would guess
that the committee would make
a decision "before the end of the
academic year."
Students have been lobbying
for Hing since last spring, when
be was originally scheduled for
a tenure hearing. The hearing
was delayed until this quarter.
Hing declined to comment.

At this point, students who
have stood by Hing are
"extremely disappointed and
discouraged — it should be a no
brainer at this point, " said Jon
Blazer, a second-year law stu
dent. He added, however, they
will "continue to express how
important it is he remains
here."
Brest has received 20 to 30
letters from students, alumni
and faculty supporting Hing
and has distributed copies to
the chair of the faculty appoint
ments committee, who in turn
circulated those letters to the
rest of the committee.
The letters have been very
positive, Brest said, adding that
"views from students about his
teaching were always helpful,"
considering "teaching is by far
the most important criterion."
These letter campaigns have
been one of the main means of
conveying the range of stu
dents, alumni and organiza
tions on which Hing has made
an impact. Hing has received
support from numerous groups.
In addition, 70 out of 180 of
the first-year law students stat
ed in a letter, "some members of
our class chose Stanford over
other law schools in order to
have the opportunity to study
with Prof. Hing."
A visiting lecturer since 1985
and a regular tenure-line associ
ate professor since 1990, Hing
has been established as a men
tor for public interest law stu
dents.
In immigration issues, Hing
is well known outside the uni
versity setting.
He was a visible opponent of
Proposition 187, the California
ballot initiative which would
have denied non-emergency
health care, education and
other benefits to undocumented
immigrants. Though passed by
voters last year, much of the
proposition was recently
declared unconstitutional by a
federal judge.
Hing still interacts regularly
with grassroots groups and
immigrants rights organiza
tions. As the director of the
Immigrant Legal Resource Cen
ter, he has a direct link to
underprivileged populations.
