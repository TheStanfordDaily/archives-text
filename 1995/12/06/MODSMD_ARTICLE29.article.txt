# Campbell readies for new challenge

Tom Campbell has always kept a full plate.
When the Stanford law professor and current
state senator (R-Stanford) was a member of Cal
ifornia's congressional delegation in Washington,
D.C., he made sure he was able to continue teach
ing at the Farm.
"What I did when I was in Congress last time
was teach part of the time," he said. "I did that by
flying home every weekend and teaching a course
on Sunday mornings."
Now Campbell is gearing up again for another
election, his fiflh since 1988, campaigning for the
U.S. House of Representatives seat vacated by
Norman Mineta in October.
Campbell is running against Jerry Estruth,
former San Jose City Council member and the
consensus Democratic candidate, in the 15th
Congressional District, which includes San Jose
and parts of Santa Cruz and Santa Clara Coun
ties. I'he race will be decided in a special election
Dec. 12.
Campbell currently represents the 11th Dis
trict in the state Senate, which covers parts of
San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties and
includes Palo Alto and Stanford. From 1988 to
1992, he served as a representative to the U.S.
Congress for what was then California's 12th
District, which included parts of San Mateo,
Santa Clara and Santa Cruz Counties.
"The biggest issue that I see before this coun
try is balancing the budget in seven years,"
Campbell said. "It's important to remember to du
thus compassionately without hurting the poor."
Abortion rights, affirmative action, cutting

the growth of federal spending and environmen
tal concerns are other important aspects of
Campbell's campaign.
"The overwhelming fact is that the growth of

federal spending has to come to
an end," he said. "I will be a
voice for less federal govern
ment and less federal spend
ing."
Campbell said he is in "favor
of ending race in affirmative
action." In the state Senate, he
said, he urged the UC system to
use economic factors and finan
cial need instead of applicants'
race to determine admissions.

The UC Regents recently voted to end their cur
rent affirmative action admissions policies.
Among registered voters in the 15th Congres
sional District, 48 percent are Democrats and 38
percent are Republicans. While Campbell is run
ning a Republican, he describes himself as —
and is widely considered to be — a moderate
troubled by the party's growing trend toward
stronger conservatism.
"I'm worried that our party will move more
and more to the right," Campbell said. "We will
lose the majority we have in the government and
our ability to be able to legislate effectively. "In
terms of philosophy, the Republican party should
lx> more consistent."
In campaign advertisements, Estruth has
accused Campl>ell of following Speaker of the
House Newt Gingrich's conservative agenda for
his own political benefit.
Speaking to a gathering in Los Gatos on Oct.

31, Estruth said, "Make no mistake about it,
Tom Campbell is neither a moderate nor a con
servative nor a liberal Republican. Tom Campbell
is a career politician who will go along with the
Gingrich agenda to increase his power in
Congress."
From 1981 to 1983, Campbell served as direc
tor of the Federal Bureau of Competition, dealing
with business antitrust cases. He has taught
international trade and economics at Stanford
Law School since 1983, receiving tenure in 1987.
Though he did teach "Issues of in Public
Policy" on Sundays, Campbell took a leave of
absence from the Law School during his two con
gressional terms. He returned to teaching full
time after his loss in the 1992 U.S. Senate pri
maries.
He won his state Senate seat in 1993 after it
was vacated by incumbent and current Stanford
trustee Becky Morgan. The legislature's schedule
allowed him to teach on a half-time basis at the
liiiw School — leading courses during the fall
semester but taking a leave of absence during the
spring semester to attend to his senatorial duties.
If Campbell wins the congressional seat, he
hopes to continue teaching at the Law School.
He is also considering classes at the Stanford
in Washington program, where he wants to
teach constitutional law, economics or public
policy.
Law School Dean Paul Brest sjiid Campbell's
economic background and previous experience in
Congress will be a benefit if he wins. "He's an
extremely smart man," Brest said. "His academ
ic career has been in economics and public policy
which cannot fail to help him in Congress."
