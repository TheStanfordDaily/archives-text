# Close FRI, Advisory Board says
## But faculty board objects to Shoven's plan, wants more details 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
The Food Research Institute is one step
closer to death as a department.
Concurring with a School of Humani
ties and Sciences recommendation, the Ad
visory Board of the Academic Council
unanimously decided Friday that the insti
tute should "be closed in its present form."

The seven-member faculty board for
warded its opinion to University President
Gerhard Casper, who could approve the
plan as early as this week. The proposal
would then go to the Board of Trustees for
final acceptance at its February meeting.
However, the board rejected Dean of
Humanities and Sciences John Shoven's
proposed transition plan which called for
closing the doctoral program, transferring

the master's students to international pol
icy studies, moving tenured faculty to
other departments and laying off non
tenured faculty.
"It has not been worked out in suffi
cient detail. We wanted to see a more fully
developed and fully detailed plan," said
Psychology Prof. Amos Tversky, chair of
the Advisory Board, adding that the board


Shoven
did not object to certain parts of the
proposal, only to its ambiguity.
Shoven, who said he was happy
with the Advisory Board's recom
mendation, said he realized the pro
posal was vague.
"I don't think the transition that
I presented is complete, and I also
think it could use some further
thought," he said.
The board has asked Provost
Condoleezza Rice to resubmit a
revised plan, including the fate of
the institute's estimated $12 mil
lion endowment fund. Shoven's
plan makes no mention of where
that money will go. Tversky said he
favors transferring the endowment
to a proposed new interdisciplinary
program called the Center for Eco
nomic Development and Food
Research.
Spokespeople for the Carnegie
Corporation and the Rockefeller
Foundation, the two chief donors to
the institute, declined to comment
on the future of the endowment if
the institute is closed.
"In no way will it be used in pur
poses [for which| it was not
planned," Tversky said.
Shoven said he intended for
some of the endowment funds to go
to the now center, with the rest aid
ing salaries for faculty studying eco
nomic development. Since five
departments have faculty studying
development, Shoven said the
money will not necessarily go to
current Food Research professors.
Food Research Prof. Scott Pear
son, the director of the institute,
said in a statement that he was dis
appointed with the decision.
"I believe strongly that Stanford
is making a serious mistake in tak
ing these actions — one that will
adversely affect its academic excel
lence, its budget and its interna
tional reputation," he wrote.
Institute students, who have vig
orously protested Shoven's plan
with pickets and a fast, appear
resigned to the institute's closure.
"Now that its clear that the tide is
about to wash over us, (we're plan
ningl how we're going to swim and
not sink," said David Widawsky, a
doctoral student who has led the
attack against Shoven. Students
are considering legal action if Rice's
transition proposal does not guar
antee them the same opportunities
they had when they were admitted,
he said.

This week, Rice created three
groups to oversee the plan. Dean of
Graduate Policy George Dekker,
also an Advisory Board member,
will work on the graduate student
transition proposal with Asst.
Provost Ann Fletcher. They will
meet with students and faculty in
the next two weeks to assess their
needs if the institute is closed,
Dekker said.
A group on faculty transition
will be led by Business Prof.
Charles Holloway and Assoc.
Provost Kathy Gillam. Vice Provost
for Institutional Planning Geoff
Cox and Budget Director Tim
Warner will oversee financial
affairs and the transfer of the
endowment.
The committees will submit
their proposals to Rice who will
then forward her plan to the Advi
sory Board. A timeline for the com
pletion of the transition plan has
not been established, Dekker said.
If Casper approves the Advisory
Board's plan, the institute would
become Stanford's 13th interdisci
plinary research center. While cur
rent institute faculty and students
claim the change would discourage
high-quality faculty from teaching,

the board asserted that the insti
tute's international reputation can
be maintained.
Doctoral students interested in
food research and economic devel
opment will be given the opportuni
ty in other departments such as
economics, political science and
sociology, Tversky said.
If history is any judge, Casper is
also likely to recommend the insti
tute's closure, Tversky said.
This event marks Casper's first
opportunity to cut a department in
his three-year tenure. Before the
February meeting of the Board of
Trustees, Casper will rule on such
changes to two departments. The
Advisory Board on Friday also
unanimously approved the merger
of operations research and engi
neering economic systems (see
related story).
Not only Ls Casper a novice to
department-cutting, so is the Board
of Trustees. The last department
closure occurred in 198.5, when the
occupational and physical therapy
department of the Medical School
was shut down. None of the
trustees who voted on the 1985
decision are currently on the board,
said Chair John Friedenrich.

opment will be given the opportuni
ty in other departments such as
economics, political science and
sociology, Tversky said.
If history is any judge, Casper is
also likely to recommend the insti
tute's closure, Tversky said.
This event marks Casper's first
opportunity to cut a department in
his three-year tenure. Before the
February meeting of the Board of
Trustees, Casper will rule on such
changes to two departments. The
Advisory Board on Friday also
unanimously approved the merger
of operations research and engi

Not only Ls Casper a novice to
department-cutting, so is the Board
of Trustees. The last department
closure occurred in 198.5, when the
occupational and physical therapy
department of the Medical School
was shut down. None of the
trustees who voted on the 1985
decision are currently on the board,
said Chair John Friedenrich.

The Food Research Institute is one step
closer to death as a department.
Concurring with a School of Humani
ties and Sciences recommendation, the Ad
visory Board of the Academic Council
unanimously decided Friday that the insti
tute should "be closed in its present form."

The seven-member faculty board for
warded its opinion to University President
Gerhard Casper, who could approve the
plan as early as this week. The proposal
would then go to the Board of Trustees for
final acceptance at its February meeting.
However, the board rejected Dean of
Humanities and Sciences John Shoven's
proposed transition plan which called for
closing the doctoral program, transferring

the master's students to international pol
icy studies, moving tenured faculty to
other departments and laying off non
tenured faculty.
"It has not been worked out in suffi
cient detail. We wanted to see a more fully
developed and fully detailed plan," said
Psychology Prof. Amos Tversky, chair of
the Advisory Board, adding that the board


Shoven
did not object to certain parts of the
proposal, only to its ambiguity.
Shoven, who said he was happy
with the Advisory Board's recom
mendation, said he realized the pro
posal was vague.
"I don't think the transition that
I presented is complete, and I also
think it could use some further
thought," he said.
The board has asked Provost
Condoleezza Rice to resubmit a
revised plan, including the fate of
the institute's estimated $12 mil
lion endowment fund. Shoven's
plan makes no mention of where
that money will go. Tversky said he
favors transferring the endowment
to a proposed new interdisciplinary
program called the Center for Eco
nomic Development and Food
Research.
Spokespeople for the Carnegie
Corporation and the Rockefeller
Foundation, the two chief donors to
the institute, declined to comment
on the future of the endowment if
the institute is closed.
"In no way will it be used in pur
poses [for which| it was not
planned," Tversky said.
Shoven said he intended for
some of the endowment funds to go
to the now center, with the rest aid
ing salaries for faculty studying eco
nomic development. Since five
departments have faculty studying
development, Shoven said the
money will not necessarily go to
current Food Research professors.
Food Research Prof. Scott Pear
son, the director of the institute,
said in a statement that he was dis
appointed with the decision.
"I believe strongly that Stanford
is making a serious mistake in tak
ing these actions — one that will
adversely affect its academic excel
lence, its budget and its interna
tional reputation," he wrote.
Institute students, who have vig
orously protested Shoven's plan
with pickets and a fast, appear
resigned to the institute's closure.
"Now that its clear that the tide is
about to wash over us, (we're plan
ningl how we're going to swim and
not sink," said David Widawsky, a
doctoral student who has led the
attack against Shoven. Students
are considering legal action if Rice's
transition proposal does not guar
antee them the same opportunities
they had when they were admitted,
he said.

This week, Rice created three
groups to oversee the plan. Dean of
Graduate Policy George Dekker,
also an Advisory Board member,
will work on the graduate student
transition proposal with Asst.
Provost Ann Fletcher. They will
meet with students and faculty in
the next two weeks to assess their
needs if the institute is closed,
Dekker said.
A group on faculty transition
will be led by Business Prof.
Charles Holloway and Assoc.
Provost Kathy Gillam. Vice Provost
for Institutional Planning Geoff
Cox and Budget Director Tim
Warner will oversee financial
affairs and the transfer of the
endowment.
The committees will submit
their proposals to Rice who will
then forward her plan to the Advi
sory Board. A timeline for the com
pletion of the transition plan has
not been established, Dekker said.
If Casper approves the Advisory
Board's plan, the institute would
become Stanford's 13th interdisci
plinary research center. While cur
rent institute faculty and students
claim the change would discourage
high-quality faculty from teaching,

the board asserted that the insti
tute's international reputation can
be maintained.
Doctoral students interested in
food research and economic devel
opment will be given the opportuni
ty in other departments such as
economics, political science and
sociology, Tversky said.
If history is any judge, Casper is
also likely to recommend the insti
tute's closure, Tversky said.
