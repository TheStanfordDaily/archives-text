# Athletics funding disclosure now required
## 
### Adam Kemezis Contributing writer 
Anyone who wants to find out
whether women's athletics at

Stanford receive
their fair share
of funding will
he able to get
that informa
tion courtesy of
the University,
thanks to regu
lations recently
enacted hy the
federal govern-

ment.
The U.S. Department of Edu
cation passed regulations neces
sary to implement the 1994
Equity in Athletics Disclosure
Act, Asst. Director of Communi
ty and Government Relations
Bradley Cohen confirmed yester
day.

Cohen said the law requires
all universities and colleges to
make a report available to stu
dents regarding how much fund
ing was given to men's and
women's intercollegiate athletics
relative to revenue and participa
tion levels.
Universities receiving federal
funds are prohibited by law from
practicing sexual discrimination
in athletics or any other pro
gram. The report required in the
legislation may make it easier to
prove discrimination in lawsuits.
Athletic Director Ted Leland
said Stanford does not currently
publish such a report and he
questioned the usefulness of the
law.
"On the face of it, I see it as
over-regulation. And it's proba
bly inappropriate at Stanford.
Hut if we have to do it, we'll do
it," Leland said.

Leland noted that Stanford
has had "the No. 1 women's ath
letics program in the country for
the last three years."
He also said that while his
department has not studied
exactly how much work will be
required to compile the report,
he was concerned that it would
take unnecessary time.
"Someone from Washington,
D.C., who never supported
women's athletics is going to
make us take time out that we
should be spending supporting
it," Leland said.
According to Cohen, the law
requires a report that states the
number of undergraduates
attending a university and lists
all varsity teams — men's and
women's — and their levels of
participation.
The report will also have to
state the operating expenses of

each team, the gender of all
coaches and assistant coaches
and whether they are employed
full- or part-time.
Also required are figures for
the amount spent on athletic
scholarships, both for each team
and overall by gender.
The report is required to
include the revenue generated by
each team, the average salary of
men's coaches and assistant
coaches, the average salary of
women's coaches and assistant
coaches and expenditures for
recruiting both by team and by
gender, Cohen said.
While regulations do not spec
ify exactly how the report is to be
distributed, Cohen said, the
report is to be made available to
students and the general public
and the University is required to
inform students of their right to
obtain the report.
