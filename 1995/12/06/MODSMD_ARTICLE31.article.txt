## Helium: high-pitched fun 
### Anand Ramachandran Staff writer 
Q m Why does your voice
sound really high
• pitched when you
inhale helium ?

A Now, this is one party
• trick I'm sure all of you
• have tried. If not, go out
and get some helium-filled bal
loons and breathe them in. When
you speak, your voice will sound
high pitched for a few moments,
until the helium runs out.
So, why does this happen? I
mean, is there some bizarre
property of helium that causes
this? Does it shrink your lungs
or your voice box or something?
Well, the reason your voice rises
in pitch with helium is fairly
simple, but the explanation does
require some terminology.
First of all, pitch itself is not a
physical quantity you can mea

sure, hut a qualitative descrip
tion of sound. The physical
quantity that determines pitch
is the frequency of the sound
waves. Most people can hear fre
quencies from 20 to 20,000
cycles per second. This range
decreases somewhat as people
age — explaining why your
grandmother has a hard time
hearing you, let alone under
standing your lingo.
To increase the pitch of your
voice, you have to increase the
frequency, and so you use heli
um. right'.' Well, not exactly. You
can change the frequency of
your voice by just talking in a
higher or lower voice, just as a
singer is able to modulate the
frequencies of individual notes.
But with helium in your lungs,
your entire vocal range is shifted
higher. Since frequency is pro
portional to the speed, this effect
must be due to an increase in
the speed of sound. How does
this change?
The factor that determines
the quality of the sound we hear
is the medium through which
the sound waves travel. The
medium for us land dwellers is
usually air, but could be some
thing else like water, glass, steel,
or wood. For example, a swim
mer can hear the sound of two
stones being struck under water.
You can also hear an approach
ing truck or train by putting
your ear to the ground.
Now, what you hear in each of
these media is quite different.
What causes the differences is

the speed of sound itself in those
media. Since sound is nothing
more than periodic disturbances
or vibrations through the media,
it seems reasonable that differ
ent stuff should vibrate differ
ently — if you don't believe me,
just see how your neighbor who's
a classical music buff vibrates
when you blast heavy metal out
your door. In other words, the
speed of sound through a media
is inversely related to the density
of that media.
So what does all this physics
have to do with parties and heli
um and squeaky voices? Well,
the density of helium is much
lower than regular air, so the
speed of sound through helium
is about three times the speed
through air. This means that the
frequency of any sound through
helium is three times higher
than the same sound through
air. This is why the pitch of your
voice is higher — about three
times higher when you inhale
helium.
In fact, if you want an ever
higher-pitched voice, say four
times higher, you could use
hydrogen, although this may not
be too healthy. If you want to
lower the pitch of your voice,
you could breathe in very cold
air. which although has a slower
speed of sound, is not different
enough from regular air for the
effect to be very noticeable. Oh
well, who really finds a low voice
all that funny? I still prefer the
squeeeeeeeeeeeky heeeeeeeeeeli
um voice.
