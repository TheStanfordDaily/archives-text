# From tree bark to taxol
## Promising new anti-cancer drug developed by Chem prof 
### Joe Westersund 
After more than five years of
work toward the chemical equiv
alent of scaling Mt. Everest,
Chemistry Prof. Paul Wender
and his research team have
recently created a laboratory
synthesis of the potential anti
cancer drug taxol.
Synthesizing the molecule, once

a holy grail of sorts for
chemistry research, is now
"conceptually a solved prob
lem," says Wender. This
new synthesis route, which
is shorter than the three
previously known path
ways, begins with pinene, a
plentiful extract from pine
trees that is "as cheap as
potting soil." The research
will now turn to makincthe

synthesis process more efficient
and practical for large-scale pro
duction.
Taxol, one of the most promis
ing new anti-cancer agents and a
FDA-approved treatment for
some forms of breast and ovarian
cancers, drew the attention of the
chemistry world first as a curiosi
ty — its complicated structure
includes a three-ring core bristling
with various functional groups.
Taxol was first isolated in
1969 in the bark of the Pacific
yew tree, a rare and slow-grow
ing species found in old-growth
forests of the Northwest. Wender
first became interested in the
drug in the early 1980s, when
synthesizing taxol was a simple
chemical challenge, an academic
exercise to push the limits of sci
entists' ability to synthesize
complicated molecules. As the

anti-cancer properties of taxol
came to be known, the challenge
took on a whole new significance.
The demand for taxol far out
strips the supply. It takes bark
from six 100-year-old yew trees
to treat one cancer patient. Har
vesting the bark is environmen
tally questionable because it kills
the tree and means allowing log
gers into old-growth timber.

Wender's program gained new
intensity around 1990, after he
received a call from Sam Broder,
director of the National Cancer
Institute, asking for help in cre
ating a bigger supply of taxol.
The research was stepped up
with that goal in mind, and also
in the hope of finding a simpler
analog to taxol with the same
clinical properties and fewer side
effects. Wender likened making
the actual taxol molecule to "con
structing a Rolls Royce" when
one can delete numerous parts
and still have "four wheels, an
engine and a chassis."
As the group learned to synthe
size taxol, the products of interme
diate steps were systematically test
ed to see if they contained the core
chemical functionality that makes
taxol act against cancer cells.
Although no simpler medical equiv

alent for taxol has yet been found,
hopes are high since the yew tree
doesn't need an optimal compound
for fighting cancer in humans.
Wender said some leads have
been found, however, and the
research had shed new light on
how taxol works — a mechanism
he says is "unlike anything else
we have seen." Though taxol has
been approved by the FDA for
use against ovarian and breast
cancer and is under considera
tion for use against cancers of
the lungs, head and neck, Wen
der cautioned that taxol is still in
the early stages of its evolution
as a drug and is not a panacea.
In giving credit for the success
of the research, Wender cited the
dedication of his research team of
27 graduate students, postdocs
and undergraduates, who often
worked nights and weekends to
keep the project going.
Wender also credited Matt
Suffness, program director with
the National Cancer Institute,
for his heroics in keeping inter
est in taxol alive despite set
backs in early testing and trou
blesome side effects. Without
Suffness, Wender says, "taxol
would not be the chemolthera
py | candidate it is now." Suff
ness himself contracted cancer
and died a few years ago from
complications.
The research also benefits
from collaboration with the Med
ical School as well as the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine, the
National Cancer Institute and
Bristol-Meyers Squibb, the phar
maceutical company that owns
the rights to develop taxol in the
United States.
