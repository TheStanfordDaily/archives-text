# Streamlined surgery technique key to quick recovery
## The 						heart of the matter 
### Alison Davis Contributing writer 
Newly developed technology is pioneering the
way to much quicker recovery for patients requir
ing coronary bypass surgery. A group of cardio
thoracic surgeons at the Medical School is
putting a clever new twist on a technique called
minimally invasive heart surgery.
Specially designed instruments manufactured
by a small Redwood City company called Heart
port allow the Stanford team to perform open
heart surgery, such as bypass, via a technique
called port-access.
Currently, cardiothoracic surgical maneuvers
require surgeons to enter the chest via a ster
notomy, making a large incision — up to a foot
long — and breaking the breast bone (sternum)
in the process.
In contrast, minimally invasive port-access
bypass surgery removes the need to break any
bones and requires only two to three cuts that are
no longer than a few inches long.
But the advantages of such a technique go
beyond cosmetics. "Typically, with a sternotomy,
recovery takes six to eight weeks — the port
access technique could have patients returning to
work within a week or two," said Dr. Thomas
Burdon, one of Stanford's cardiothoracic sur
geons currently testing the new technique on
patients. "Patients could be playing golf two to
three weeks after the operation," he suggested.
Simply stated, coronary bypass surgery is a
meticulous process of stitching living blood ves
sels with polypropylene thread. Arteries are
grafted together, providing a detour for blood
flow around an area of vessel clogged with fatty
deposits.
As with most bypass surgery, the port-access
technique is performed with the heart stopped —
a heart-lung machine takes over in the meantime
— creating a situation in which "we're not oper
ating on a moving target," Burdon explained.
But in conventional bypass surgery, blood
flowing through the heart is temporarily blocked
by clamping down the aorta, the major blood ves

sel carrying blood away from the heart.
This is done from the outside — clamps are
placed around the vessel — and is the primary
reason that such a large surgical cut must be
made in the first place.
So how does the port-access method work?
"The platform of the technology is an endoaortic
clamp," said Burdon.
The clamp — a snake-like tube called a
catheter, equipped with a small inflatable balloon
at its end — was designed by a group of surgeons
and biomedical engineers from Stanford, New
Zealand and Heartport.
The endoaortic clamp eliminates the need for
external clamps. When the balloon is inflated, it
stops aortic blood flow from the inside of the vessel.
The balloon is filled with saline and contrast —
a dye which can be seen with an X-ray machine
hooked up to a thoracoscope, a probing device
used to track the positioning of the long catheter.
A small delivery port at the end of the catheter
delivers a solution of potassium ions to the heart
which causes it to stop beating. Once the vessel
sewing is complete, the balloon is deflated, per
mitting blood flow to resume. This also serves to
flush out the heart-stopping solution so that the
heart can beat again.
According to Burdon, the new method takes a
little longer to perform than conventional bypass
surgery, but more experience with the technique
should reduce operating time. Although surgeons
currently perform only single vessel bypasses,
variations on the technique should make double
and triple bypasses very feasible, he added.
Other centers nationwide are experimenting
with various forms of minimally invasive heart
surgery, but currently Stanford is the only place
where port-access coronary bypass surgery is
being performed. As part of an ongoing FDA
approved phase I clinical trial, six patients have
been treated and three are awaiting surgery.
The cardiovascular surgeons see the port
access technique as a time-saving, cost-cutting
development in bypass procedures. For the
patient, this should mean faster recovery and
more time to enjoy life.

With the port-access technique, cardiothoracic surgeons can avoid the need to enter the chest through
a large incision while performing open heart surgery. Instead, the new technique requires only two or
three cuts, or ports, that are a few inches long.
