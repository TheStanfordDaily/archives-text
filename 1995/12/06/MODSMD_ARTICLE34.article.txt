# O'Hanlan tries to gain medical attention for lesbians
## 
### Dee Ann Durbin Contributing writer 
The discrimination begins as soon as
the lesbian patient enters the doctor's
waiting room. Brochures she sees discuss
teen sexuality, sexual dysfunction and
sexually transmitted diseases. Not one
mentions lesbians or lesbian health.
She proceeds to fdl out the doctor's
questionnaire, noting she must identify
herself in the heterosexual terms
"divorced" or "widowed." Finally, during
her examination, her doctor asks what
kind of birth control she's been using.
The discrimination is subtle â€” it is
likely the doctor didn't even realize its
effect on the patient. But by the time the
lesbian leaves the office, there is an 84
percent chance she will not return.
This process of being "ignored and
invisiblized" may be contributing to high
er rates of morbidity and mortality in the
lesbian community, says Dr. Katherine
O'Hanlan, assistant professor and associ
ate director of the gynecological cancer
section at the Medical School. Because
discrimination or fear of discrimination
keeps lesbians from getting routine, pre
ventative care, they are more at risk for
heart disease, breast, colon and ovarian

cancers and other diseases.
O'Hanlan published her findings in
the July / August issue of Current Prob
lems in Obstetrics, Gynecology and Fer
tility. Previous to this study, she co
authored a best-selling book, "Natural
Menopause," and served as president of
the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association.
The information in O'Hanlan's study
is not new. Instead, it summarizes infor
mation from seven surveys, both pub
lished and unpublished, representing
over 13,500 lesbian respondents. The
surveys were distributed between 1980
and 1993 by organizations all over the
country.
O'Hanlan recognizes that the results
are far from complete. The surveys used
represent only those lesbians who agreed
to participate, spoke English, were acces
sible and were somehow connected to the
lesbian community. By collecting this
data and presenting it to the medical
community, however, O'Hanlan hopes to
enlighten her colleagues on the presence
of lesbian patients and the special health
risks they may face.
"I'm not using it to make statistical
conclusions," O'Hanlan said. "I'm using
it to show the need for more data."
In one study, 72 percent of the respon

dents reported overhearing derogatory
comments or experiencing ostracism and
rough treatment from their health care
providers. Often, this behavior occurred
immediately after the patient identified
herself as a lesbian. Citing fear of such
repercussions, 67 percent of the respon
dents to another survey believed they
could not be "out" to their physicians.
"The lesbian patient keeps getting the
message: She's not wanted here," said
O'Hanlan. "She must always be asking,
'Is this a safe place for me?' "
As a result, many lesbians turn to
alternative health care providers.
Though these providers may be more
accepting and nurturing, they are unlike
ly to provide women with standard medi
cal tests like Pap smears, mammograms
and blood pressure assessments. Without
such screening, these women risk having
diseases go unchecked.
For example, having a child is known
to reduce by one-half the risk of develop
ing endometrial, breast and ovarian can
cers. Prolonged use of oral contraceptives
is also known to reduce the likelihood of
ovarian cancer. Since lesbians are demo
graphically less likely than heterosexual
women to bear children or take oral con
traceptives, O'Hanlan writes, "it is rea

sonable to expect a higher rate of ovarian
carcinoma in the lesbian population."
lesbians also appear to be at greater
risk for breast cancer than heterosexual

women. They are less
likely to bear children
and more likely to be
obese, O'Hanlan says;
both are risk factors for
breast cancer. These
factors are compounded
by the fact that lesbians
get mammograms and
perform breast self
examinations with less
frequency than hetero-

sexuals, therefore missing early detection
of the disease.
Reaction to the study has been posi
tive, O'Hanlan said. Recently, the Ameri
can College of Obstetricians and Gynecol
ogists agreed to revise its brochures and
produce a new brochure entitled "Les
bian Health." Other medical groups are
also sponsoring forums on the treatment
of lesbians and gays.
"The medical community has received
it wonderfully, because doctors really
want to give good care," O'Hanlan said.
"Doctors are very eager to unlearn their
innocently acquired homophobia."

Throughout the study, O'Hanlan dis
cusses not only the medical problems of
lesbians but also a wide range of issues
and demographic information to help
doctors understand their patients better.
She also gives suggestions for better care.
Physicians, she writes, "should rou
tinely ask when discussing sexual behav
ior whether each woman is sexual with
men, women, both or neither." Doctors
should also use inclusive language in con
versations and brochures, instead of
referring to boyfriends or husbands. If a
lesbian is partnered, her spouse should be
included in medical decision making and
should be given the same support as het
erosexual spouses would be given during
stressful times.
Stanford's commitment to ending this
discrimination, O'Hanlan said, has been
particularly encouraging. She said she
has not seen any overt homophobia at the
Medical School in her five years here. Her
colleagues' response to the study was also
very positive.
"In an unenlightened community, [the
study 1 would be dissuasive of referrals,"
O'Hanlan said. "But my referral base
includes many wonderful doctors and
nurses and of course the patients them
selves."
