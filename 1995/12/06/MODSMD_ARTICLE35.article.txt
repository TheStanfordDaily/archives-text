Teams of Stanford mechanical engi
neering students swept the James F. Lin
coln Arc Welding Foundation's 1995 Pre-
Professional Awards Program, winning
four of the top awards in the graduate
division.
The top prize, a $2,000 Best of Pro
gram Award, went to Hung Chen, Kirk
Hirano and Alton Phillips for their entry
titled "Double Ended Pressure Regula
tor," which has potential applications in
portable and biomedical equipment.

Stanford teams also garnered the
$1,000 Gold Award, the $750 Silver
Award and the $500 Bronze Award.
"1 knew we bad a very strong project,
but we were also competing against our
classmates and we knew their projects
were strong too," said Phillips. "I was
very shocked."
"It's very gratifying," said Mechanical
Engineering Prof. Larry Leifer, who
served as a faculty adviser for the win
ning students. "I'm glad the award is for
the students, not the instructors. That's
pretty unusual in academia."

Although unconfirmed by Lincoln
Foundation officials, Stanford students
may have also won a total 11 of the 12
awards in the graduate division, includ
ing the four mentioned above.
For the past 10 years Stanford has
dominated this competition, winning
nine of the 12 awards last year and six
the year before.
"Stanford has been one of our out
standing participants," agreed Richard
Sabo, executive director of the Lincoln
Foundation. The college division of the
foundation's awards program receives

between 150 and 200 entries each year
from schools all over the nation, includ
ing the Ivy League, Worcester Polytech
nic Institute, the University of Michigan,
Ohio State University and UC-Berkeley.
Students worked on their projects last
year as part of Leifer's mechanical engi
neering design course, ME 210, "Cross-
Functional Systems Design," a three
quarter sequence in which student pro
ject teams work on industry-supported
design problems.
Leifer advocated the project-based
learning format of bis course, explaining

that it "moves the focus from teaching to
learning and moves the students' role
from passive to active."
Part of the reason for Stanford's con
tinued success, according to Leifer, is ME
210's particular attention to the basic
principles of design.
The Lincoln Foundation was estab
lished in 1936 by the Lincoln Electric
Company to advance the science and
application of arc welding. It has offered
awards annually for 59 years to recog
nize superior achievements in these
fields.
