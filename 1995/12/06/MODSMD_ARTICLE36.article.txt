# Nom Comm problems go back a decade
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Delayed appointments and resigning chairs
have been a problem for the ASSU Nomina
tions Commission for 10 years, and despite
repeated attempts by the ASSU to correct the
problem, furor still surrounds the commis
sion.
The commission is central to the ASSU's
purpose: It links students to administrators
by ensuring a student voice on University
committees.
"Students have a unique perspective," said
law student David Bradfute, who was an
ASSU senator in 1989. "We see things admin
istrators don't see, and if we can frame the
problem, things can get better."
Derek Miyahara, a resident fellow in Otero
and the deputy chair of the ASSU senate in
1992, agreed.
"It is really a thankless job," Miyahara said.
"It is always open to charges of favoritism —
people get fed up with it. There is a lot of pres
sure: The chair gets accused of something, and
I he] resigns."
Miyahara said the commission does its job
well in the spring when it selects students for
the year-to-year University committees — it is
with the appointments to ad hoc committees
where the process breaks down.

"There are two aspects to Nom Comm,"
said Nanci Howe, director of the Office of Stu
dent Activities. "One has worked and the
other has been more of a challenge."
Since 1989, three commission chairs have
resigned over controversy with student
appointments to ad hoc committees — Scott
Kupor, Elson Liu and Scott Weintraub.
Graduate student Neil Crellin, deputy chair
of the senate in 1991, said the ASSU and the
commission used to receive more attention
from the President's Office. Crellin said the
commission used to appoint about 200 stu
dents to committees every year, and former
Assistant to the President Bob Hamrdla would
hold training meetings with the appointees.
"He made it clear that this was a feedback
process, and the ASSU was a switchboard. . . .
We were the student voice and we needed to
report back to students the decisions," Crellin
said.
Crellin said he saw irony in a letter that
several ASSU senators wrote to The Daily say
ing certain administrators were acting disre
spectfully toward the ASSU.
"They say the I ASSU I Constitution is a
contract with the Board of Trustees, but the
ASSU has broken the contract by not follow
ing their own bylaws," Crellin said.
"The University has no way to get the stu
dents. The ASSU has to know the bylaws to be

taken seriously. The more name-calling they
engage in, the less seriously they are taken."
Miyahara attributed the commission's
problems with appointments to ad hoc com
mittees to the bureaucracy in the ASSU Sen
ate. He said the senate does not like to give one
person too much control.
"Students want more input, and if the Uni
versity grants that, great. But the senate pro
cesses aren't designed for it." Miyahara said.
Bradfute said University officials are also
partially responsible for the commission's
problems.
Bradfute said sometimes administrators
know what positions need to be filled months
in advance but don't inform the ASSU.
"Administrators are naive about the Nom
Comm process as well," he said. "Both sides
are involved in the breakdown of the process."
"I can see the administration is frustrated
— they don't want to keep students out of
University committees," he said.
Assistant to the President Jean Fetter said
that with the recent budget cutbacks, the
president's office has been reduced by 30 per
cent and the position that was the liaison to
the students has been cut.
Fetter added that Dean of Students Marc
Wais has volunteered to become this liaison.
"We don't have the staff to fill that role," Fet
ter said.
