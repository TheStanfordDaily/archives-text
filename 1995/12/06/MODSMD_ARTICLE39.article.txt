# Leaving Leland's lock-up

/'// walk out a wiser, weaker man.
Johnny Cash, "San Quentin"
That's how my friend Brandon summed up
his time at Stanford. Four years, .32 papers, f>7
exams, 70 parties, 80 proof and countless
sleepless nights after he entered Stanford.
Brandon walked out a wiser, weaker man.
At first I thought it strange for him to
compare one of America's most respected uni
versities with one of her most feared prisons.
But for those of us doing time here, the Farm
does sometimes seem frighteningly like a
prison. At it's best, Stanford is a short slice of
paradise, yes. But then come the times when
you lack sleep and tire of your routine and
count the days until you get a break. That's
when you start to feel like you've lost your
freedom and you're being punished for some
thing.
In my four-plus years here I've been tried
and tired. I've felt intermittently shamed and
shackled. I've dreamt of the green, green
grass of home, only to wake to the four gray
walls of Florence Moore Hall.
On the flip side of the coin, I'm sure San
Quentin is at times very educational — espe
cially if you compare it with my Freshman
English class.
So, despite the myriad and si/able differ
ences between the two institutions, compar
ing Stanford and San Quentin can be reveal
ing. Just take a look:
S.Q. California's premier correctional institu
tion, San Quentin State Prison opened in
1852.
S.U. California's premier educational institu
tion, the Leland Stanford Junior University
opened in 1891.
S.Q. Serves approximately 5,600 inmates.
S.U. Serves approximately 14,000 students.
S.Q. Highest degree offered: G.E.D.
S.U. Highest degree offered: Ph.D.
S.Q. Subjects include electrical repair, graph
ic arts and mattress manufacturing.
S.U. Subjects include electrical engineering,
fine arts and sleep research.

S.Q. While ex-cons have allegedly paid their
dues, a prison record can make it hard to find
gainful employment.
S.U. While graduates have allegedly paid
their dues, a bachelor's in the humanities can
make it hard to find gainful employment.
S.Q. About 80 percent of inmates will be con
fined to prison for another offense.
S.U. About 45 percent of undergraduates will
go on to graduate school.
S.Q. Death Row.
S.U. Dead Week.
S.Q. Penal.
S.U. Western pioneering.
S.Q. Inmate population includes 421 men so
evil they were sentenced to death.
S.U. Student population includes 120 a capel
la singers.
S.Q. Solitary confinement.
S.U. Cro Mem.
S.Q. Offers an Alternate Sentencing Program
(ASP), a rigorous "boot camp" that is being
tested as an alternative to traditional jail time
for new offenders.
S.U. Offers SLE.
S.Q. Three strikes, you're out.
S.U. Tenure.
S.Q. Despite extensive planning by certain
inmates, successful escapes are very rare.
S.U. Despite the proximity of San Francisco,
students never venture outside Palm Drive.
S.Q. The gas chamber.
S.U. The High Temperature Gasdynamics
Lab.
S.Q. Overcoming the best efforts of prison
administrators, gangs maintain an insidious
and disruptive influence over prison life.
S.U. The ASSU.
S.Q. Only the strong survive.
S.U. Publish or perish.
As you can see, the similarities are spooky.
Oh. all right — maybe it's not that short a

walk between the guard tower and the ivory
tower. Hut Brandon's comment stuck in m\
mind. Now that I'm leaving the Farm, I think
of it increasingly, and I find it has the ring o!
truth.
That ring emanates from one indisputable
similarity between colleges and jails. At a
basic level, both Stanford and San Quentin
strive to do the same thing: improve a person
Yes, jail is trying to improve your morals
and Stanford your mind, but the process is tin
same. The institutions show people their
shortcomings before they suggest how tt
improve. They expose the crime, expose tht
stupidity; they sentence, they grade.
The institutions criticize, belittle and chal
lenge to compel hard work and serious reflec
tion. They tear down part of the old person
before they build the new and improved
model. No pain, no gain.
At points, this process has to hurt, and it
does. And, while the coed or convict emerge. 1 -
with new skills, new dreams and new oppor
tunities, there is a powerful nostalgia for tht
ego left behind, the cocky invincibility of the
young prodigy or the criminal at large.
And so it happened to me. Like Adam, I
paid for my knowledge. Before I entered Stan
ford, I had all the answers. 1 was richer
calmer, stronger, saner, healthier, happier
and pleasanter. Now I'm just smarter, metja
sana in corpore malato.
Please don't think me overly bitter or
depressed. I'm sometimes amazed by what
Stanford has done for me, or allowed me to d<
for myself. 1 can state unequivocally that 1
know much more and can do much more thar
that day in September 1991 when 1 startec
life as a Stanford student.
Wiser hut weaker: In the end, it's been c
fair trade. It's just wasn't always fun. But hey
that's Stanford. And, I suspect, that's life.

To (mis)quote another great singer, "I 'm going
back to Indiana, I do believe 1 've had enough.
You folks take care.
