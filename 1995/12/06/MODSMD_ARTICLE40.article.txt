# Campus faces latke issue
## Wilbur votes to end boycott of fatty food 
### Mary Hoffring Diversions staff 
After months of negotiations,
meetings and education, the first
vote has been tallied opposing
the University-wide latke boy
cott. But the debate continues to
sizzle.
At the urging of student
protesters, the University's
Latke Committee had set this
holiday season as the deadline to
decide the fate of the traditional
Hanukkah potato pancakes,
banned by food service in 1977
because of their high fat content.
Wilbur residents cast their bal
lots last week as part of a plan to
let dorms settle the issue for
themselves.
"It's a travesty that Stanford
dining halls don't serve latkes,"
said Rvan Tugman, a sophomore
in Arroyo who took part in last
spring's hunger strike at the
Kennedy Kosher Co-op. "And it's
not just that they don't have
them for Hanukkah — they don't
have them at all, ever. Blintzes,
yeah, iLatkes no! The tightfisted
bastards!"
Many students seem to share
his opinion, but a vocal minority
begged to differ. Some objected
purely for health resaons, while
others, like Soto resident Jen
nifer Smith, were slightly more

hostile.
"I hate latkes," said Smith, a
junior. "They're gross. And
what's with that apple shit? I
mean, apples and potatoes? 1
know in French, 'potato' is
'pomme de terre,' or 'apple of the
earth,' but, 1 mean, that's for
French people and this is not
France! This is America, and
there's no room for latkes here!"
But despite such outcries, the
rampant apathy of all Stanford
students (each and every Stan
ford student is apathetic — we
did a poll to prove it) was clearly
reflected in the high number of
Wilbur residents who didn't
bother to vote at all.
When asked why he didn't
vote, Junipero resident Sparky
Zimmerman replied, "Latke?
Wasn't he that guy on Taxi?"
Then he scratched his head,
because he was confused.
