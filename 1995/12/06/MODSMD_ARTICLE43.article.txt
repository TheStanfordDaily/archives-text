# Four dining halls join grape boycott
## 
### Alex Scherbakovsky 
The presence of grapes in Uni
versity-provided meals will be
confined to Manzanita and Rick
er dining halls as the voting
majority of Stanford students
have said "no" to grapes in a
series of votes.
Among major undergraduate
dorms that voted to boycott the
service of grapes are Wilbur Hall,
Roble Hall, Toyon Hall and
Branner Hall.
Votes from Florence Moore
Hall — the last large residence to
complete its referendum — are
expected to be tabulated by this
Friday, according to Flo Mo
Office Coordinator Jamila Saudi.
The outcome of the vote drew
varied responses from students.
Some students emphasized the
political ramifications of Stan
ford's vote.
"I hope that farmers, the
unions and the community are
listening to our message," said
Matthew d'Alessio, a freshman
in Wilbur.

The battle to boycott grapes
came to the forefront after a May
1994 hunger strike called for a
University-wide boycott on
grapes because of alleged mis
treatment of migrant workers
who pick grapes.
In the wake of the hunger
strike, University President Ger
hard Casper formed a Grape Pol
icy Committee, which last year
recommended that both resi
dences and administrative units
be able to choose whether or not
to serve grapes.
Casper rejected the recom
mendation for administrative
units but said he would allow
individual residences to vote.
Only 377 out of 732 Wilbur
residents voted on the grape
issue — 160 to serve grapes and
212 to boycott grapes. Five peo
ple wrote in abstentions.
Of the 308 Roble residents,
just 179 voted — 58 to serve
grapes and 92 to boycott grapes,
while 29 abstained.
Kenton Fong, a resident assis
tant at Okada House in Wilbur,

said he welcomes Wilbur's deci
sion to boycott grapes "because it
shows that there is a strong con
cern in Wilbur about issues that
strongly affect people in our com
munity."
While acknowledging the
political importance of Stan
ford's grape vote, Dave Herrera,
an RAin Roble, stressed that the
"education of students about the
issue was the most important
part of the process."
Preparation for the grape vote
began at RA training this past
summer, where RAs were thor
oughly educated about the vari
ous aspects of the issue.
Resident assistants in each
dorm posted fliers informing stu
dents about the pros and cons of
serving grapes in the dining
halls. Furthermore, Grape Com
mittee Chair Luis Fraga, an asso
ciate professor of political sci
ence, conducted panels in several
dining halls discussing various
aspects of the issue.
Despite the pronounced edu
cation campaign, a large percent

age of Stanford students did not
vote on the grape issue.
"I believe the low voter
turnout is a reflection of the
campus as a whole," said senior
Craig Skotdal, a RAin Roble.
The grape vote "is not an issue
everyone feels passionate about,"
he added.
The voter turnouts in Toyon,
Branner and Kicker echoed what
Skotdal said he saw in Roble.
Fifty-four Toyon residents
voted in favor of serving grapes
and 81 voted to boycott grapes.
Abstention was not an option on
the ballot and 75 Toyon resi
dents did not vote at all.
In Branner, 55 residents voted
to serve grapes, 69 voted to boy
cott grapes, and two abstained
out of a total 180 students.
Aside from self-operated and
cooperative housing, Ricker was
the only other undergraduate
dining hall to join Manzanita in
voting to serve grapes. Ricker
serves residents in Sterling Quad.

reasons for the campus' political
