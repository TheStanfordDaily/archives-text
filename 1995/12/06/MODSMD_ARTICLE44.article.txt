## Football rests up for Liberty Bowl and ECU Pirates 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
Sandwiched between Han
ukkah and Christmas on one
side and New Year's on the
other, the 37th annual St. Jude
Liberty Bowl provides yet
another reason for Stanford
fans to celebrate this holiday
season. The Cardinal (7-3-1),
making its first postseason
appearance in three seasons,
will collide with East Carolina
in Memphis, Tenn., on Dec. 30
at 11 a.m. CST (9 a.m. PST) —
live on ESPN.
"The Liberty Bowl has an
excellent tradition and Mem
phis is an excellent city," said
Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham. "All of those
things make the game very
attractive."
ECU may not be one of the
first teams that comes to mind
when one considers schools
with strong bowl traditions
(neither is Stanford, for that
matter), but the Pirates have
put together an impressive 8-3
record in 1995. An independent
school located in Greenville,
N.C., Eastern Carolina has
used a potent offense to upset
Gator Bowl-bound Syracuse
and ride through a schedule
against small-conference and
unaffiliated midwestern schools
en route to its second consecu
tive Liberty Bowl. The team's
only loss by more than seven
points (27-7) came at the hands
of No. 4 Tennessee.
"I know from past history —
having grown up in the state,
having coached at North Car
olina State — that East Caroli
na has had some truly great
teams," Willingham said. "It
will be a team full of athletes.
They will have great speed and
skill. 1 don't know how big they
will be, but I do know they will
be an excellent skill team."

Piratp head coach Steve-
Logan took control of the ECU
program four years ago and ; the
squad has steadily improved
since, stringing together i)uck
to-back winning seasons for the
first time since 1983. The 42-
year-old Logan has made his
success possible by building the
team's scoring attack around
the philosophy of offensive
genius and former Stanford
head coach Bill Walsh.
"Their coach has studied Bill
Walsh in detail, so I know that
their style and their system will
have some flavor of the Walsh
system — a West Coast offense
on the East Coast," Willingham
said.
Thus, the Cardinal defense
will battle a scheme that has its
roots in the mind of its former
mentor. As is often the case,
the success or failure of such a
scheme will depend heavily
upon the ability of the man
under center. Unfortunately
for Stanford, the Pirates have a
winner at that slot.
"The highlight of their team
has to be their quarterback,
Marcus Crandell," Willingham
said. "He is one of those really
special athletes — maybe even
better than a guy they had a
few years back, Jeff Blake, who
is doing very well with the
Cincinnati Bengals. He's that
kind of athlete with that kind
of skill."
Crandell, only a junior, has
smashed or is on the verge of
smashing nearly all of Blake's
school records. After a 1995
campaign in which he complet
ed 235 of 447 pass attempts for
2,751 yards and 18 touch
downs, Crandell became ECU's
all-time leader in career pass
ing yardage and career total
offense and needs only two
more scoring strikes to move
