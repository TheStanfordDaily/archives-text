## Football rests up for Liberty Bowl and ECU Pirates 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
Sandwiched between Han
ukkah and Christmas on one
side and New Year's on the
other, the 37th annual St. Jude
Liberty Bowl provides yet
another reason for Stanford
fans to celebrate this holiday
season. The Cardinal (7-3-1),
making its first postseason
appearance in three seasons,
will collide with East Carolina
in Memphis, Tenn., on Dec. 30
at 11 a.m. CST (9 a.m. PST) —
live on ESPN.
"The Liberty Bowl has an
excellent tradition and Mem
phis is an excellent city," said
Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham. "All of those
things make the game very
attractive."
ECU may not be one of the
first teams that comes to mind
when one considers schools
with strong bowl traditions
(neither is Stanford, for that
matter), but the Pirates have
put together an impressive 8-3
record in 1995. An independent
school located in Greenville,
N.C., Eastern Carolina has
used a potent offense to upset
Gator Bowl-bound Syracuse
and ride through a schedule
against small-conference and
unaffiliated midwestern schools
en route to its second consecu
tive Liberty Bowl. The team's
only loss by more than seven
points (27-7) came at the hands
of No. 4 Tennessee.
"I know from past history —
having grown up in the state,
having coached at North Car
olina State — that East Caroli
na has had some truly great
teams," Willingham said. "It
will be a team full of athletes.
They will have great speed and
skill. 1 don't know how big they
will be, but I do know they will
be an excellent skill team."

Piratp head coach Steve-
Logan took control of the ECU
program four years ago and ; the
squad has steadily improved
since, stringing together i)uck
to-back winning seasons for the
first time since 1983. The 42-
year-old Logan has made his
success possible by building the
team's scoring attack around
the philosophy of offensive
genius and former Stanford
head coach Bill Walsh.
"Their coach has studied Bill
Walsh in detail, so I know that
their style and their system will
have some flavor of the Walsh
system — a West Coast offense
on the East Coast," Willingham
said.
Thus, the Cardinal defense
will battle a scheme that has its
roots in the mind of its former
mentor. As is often the case,
the success or failure of such a
scheme will depend heavily
upon the ability of the man
under center. Unfortunately
for Stanford, the Pirates have a
winner at that slot.
"The highlight of their team
has to be their quarterback,
Marcus Crandell," Willingham
said. "He is one of those really
special athletes — maybe even
better than a guy they had a
few years back, Jeff Blake, who
is doing very well with the
Cincinnati Bengals. He's that
kind of athlete with that kind
of skill."
Crandell, only a junior, has
smashed or is on the verge of
smashing nearly all of Blake's
school records. After a 1995
campaign in which he complet
ed 235 of 447 pass attempts for
2,751 yards and 18 touch
downs, Crandell became ECU's
all-time leader in career pass
ing yardage and career total
offense and needs only two
more scoring strikes to move
into first place on the career
touchdown passes list.
Logan's plans and Crandell's
arm spread the ball around the
East Carolina offense. The
Pirates boast five receivers with
24 or more receptions this year.
Mitchell Galloway headlines at H
back (a receiver who lines up in
the backfield). He has snagged 46
passes for 619 yards. Logan likes
to use Galloway in much the same
manner the 49ers used Jerry Rice
against the Cowboys this NFL
season, keeping him away from
his opponents' best pass defend
ers and forcing their linebackers
into coverage.
Flanker Jason Nichols (43
receptions, 502 yards) and split
end Larry Shannon (24, 346) also
contribute significantly. In addi
tion, tight end Sean Richards has
pulled in 33 balls while fullback

Jerris McPhail has grabbed 38
passes to complement his rushing
duties.
"This is a team that will force
you to play the whole field," Will
ingham said.
McPhail has more than ade
quately filled the hole left by the
graduation of all-time ECU rush
ing leader Junior Smith. He aver
aged 4.9 yards per carry and ran
for 910 yards and five touch
downs, giving the Pirates some
punch on the ground to go along
with their air attack.
Defensively, ECU has also
shown drastic improvement over
the past few years. Once notori
ous for their sieve-like approach
to stopping opponents, the
Pirates' defense has now earned
respect.
Willingham hopes that offen
sive coordinator Dana Bible will
challenge the rejuvenated ECU
defense. Bible saw the Pirates on
a regular basis while he was the
head coach at Cincinnati, the
position he hold before coming to

Stanford.
"[Bible's] Cincinnati team
played them a year ago," Willing
ham said. "He'll have a pretty
good feel for where they're at and
for what they can do."
Regardless of whether Bible's
personal experience with ECU
will provide insight, expect the
Cardinal to put some points on
the board. The Stanford offense
has never failed to score at least
24 points. In fact, it averaged just
over 30 points for the 1995 sea
son.
While the coaching staff pre
p-res for all the tricks and trin
kets the Pirates may throw out on
either side of the line of scrim
mage, they must also worry about
keeping their players focused dur
ing the six weeks between Big
(lame and the bowl game. Prac
tice won't begin again until Dec.
15 — after finals are over — but
Willingham expects his players to
understand that there is still
work left to be done and to pre
pare accordingly.
