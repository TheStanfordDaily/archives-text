Stanford wrestlers returned
from a successful Las Vegas
Invitational in Stateline, Nev.
last week after competing
against 34 of the top teams in
the country, including eight of
the top 10 programs.
Stanford posted an impres
sive performance, finishing 14th
as a team, ahead of two top-20
teams in West Virginia and
Edinboro.
lowa State surprised every
one by winning the tournament
and producing four individual
champions, while no other

school produced more than one.
Nebraska finished second and
Wyoming took third.
The Cardinal's appearance in
the tournament was highlighted
by the performances of senior
co-captains Tod Surmon and
Jimmy Aguirre. The two fin
ished second at 142 pounds and
eighth at 134 pounds, respec
tively.
Surmon pinned Rob McMinn
of Arizona State (sixth seed and
ranked first in the Pacific 10
Conference) and downed Dorian
Hager of West Virginia (seeded
second and ranked fifth national
ly), 8-3. After injuring his knee in
his semifinal match, he had to
forfeit his final match against
lowa State's Derek Mountsier
(top seed and ranked fourth
nationally). Surmon was Stan
ford's first finalist in the Las
Vegas Invitational's 15-year his
tory.
Aguirre, seeded sixth, defeated
Ben Shane of North Idaho (14-7),
Richard Gutierrez of San Fran
cisco State (5-0), and Tracy
Brown of Arizona State (3-1) en
route to his eighth-place finish.
"I was pleased with our perfor
mance," said head coach Chris
Horpel, now in his 17th year as
head coach. "We accomplished
our two goals by producing indi
vidual place winners and finish
ing in the top 20 as a team."
Senior Sahlan Martin (158
pounds) finished with a 2-2
record in the tournament. His
two defeats came at the hands of
ninth seed Alfonso Tucker of
Fresno State (12-5) and fifth
seed Jason Kraft of Nebraska (8-
4). Sophomore Jason Gladden
(177) ended with the same
record, losing to Derek Scott, the
second seed from Cal State-Bak
ersfield.
Senior Matt Cano (126) went
1-2, defeating sixth-seeded Eric
Guerrero by medical forfeit.
