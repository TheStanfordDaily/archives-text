The No. 3 Stanford women's
volleyball team's opening match
in the NCAA Tournament paral
leled the unfolding of the Cardi
nal's 1995 season. After a slow
start, Stanford (27-2) eventually
pulled itself together to dominate
down the stretch, defeating No.
24 Northern lowa (28-2) 15-12,
15-8, 15-3 Saturday night in
Maples Pavilion.
"I have to give Northern lowa
a lot of credit," said Stanford head
coach Don Shaw. "We weren't
playing the way we're capable of
playing early on, but a lot of that
is because of the way they were
playing. They played well and
made us adjust our game."
Indeed, the first game proved
particularly competitive. The
defending national champions
appeared nervous in the early
going despite expecting an easy
match against a Panther team
that had not previously played a
ranked opponent. Poor passing, a
Northern lowa service ace and
strong setting from Panther
senior Kara Gaeler allowed
underdog Northern lowa to jump
to a 4-0 lead.
However, Stanford immediate
ly jumped back into the game
thanks to errors from Gaeler and
Panther senior outside hitter Jill
Schoeberl. The Cardinal scored
the next three points to pull with

in 4-3.
After trading points twice,
Northern lowa began to pull away
once again due to a swarm of
Stanford errors. Forced into the
starting lineup after senior out
side hitter Wendy Hrornadka frac
tured her wrist in practice, senior
Marnie Triefenbach committed
four hitting errors while register
ing only one kill in game one.

"Mamie wasn't ready to roll
[Saturday night]," Shaw said.
"But wo are fortunate enough to
have subs like (sophomore Deb
bie] Lambert, who can come in
and play well if someone is strug
gling."
Shaw pulled Triefenbach with
the Panthers ahead 9-5. After-
Northern lowa scored again,
Shaw made his second important

substitution of the game, insert
ing junior Catherine Julliard into
the lineup. Julliard served up four
consecutive points, and the Cardi
nal was back in the game.
After Stanford tied the game
on a dink by sophomore middle
blocker Barbara Ifejika, the Pan
thers scored to take an 11-10 lead.

The top-seeded Stanford women's volleyball team shook off a shaky start to roll over the Northern lowa
Panthers in a three-game sweep.
At this juncture, Shaw made yet
another brilliant change, shuffling
senior Maureen McLaren into the
lineup to serve, replacing sopho
more Kristin Folkl, who had failed
to get either of her first two serves
in play.
McLaren responded with an ace,
and the Cardinal went on to score
three straight points, taking its first
lead at 13-11. After a Schoeberl kill
cut the margin to one, junior middle
blocker Eileen Murfee ended the
game with a solo block and a kill.
"Our depth really helped us (Sat
urday nightl," Shaw said. "We were
able to have Lambert come in land
play well], and we got Mo
(McLaren) in there. We used all 12
players tonight."
Still, Northern lowa kept itself in
the match with accurate serves that
confused the Cardinal.
"Our game plan was to use our
serve to attack them," said UNI
coach Iradge Ahrab-Fard. "With all
their talent at outside hitter, we
wanted to cut down on their ability
to run their offense with our serves.
"In [game one), we were able to
do that. Then we started missing a
few serves and it got away from us.
I have to give the credit to Stanford.
They have so many outstanding
players. They gave our players so
many responsibilities to attend to."
The main responsibility neglect
ed by the Panthers was the right
side of the Stanford offense. For the
Cardinal, such failure translates
into repeated hitting opportunities
without blockers for senior set
ter/outside hitter Cary Wendell
and sophomore setter / outside bit
ter Lisa Sharpley.
Wendell and Sharpley were up to
the task, and by game two, Stanford
began to wear down the Panthers.
Sharpley hit an incredible .630 in 27
attempts on the evening to amass a
career-high and team-leading 17
kills and zero hitting errors. Also
leading the team with 31 set assists
and 17 digs, Sharpley recorded her
third triple-double of the season.
Despite the uncontested hitting
attempts, it was Sharpley's digs
toward the end of game one and
throughout game two that almost
single-handedly brought the Cardi
nal back from its early deficit.
"I'm much more confident now
(than earlier in the yearl," Sharpley
said. "When I'm confident, I usually
play better. Plus, it's nice to have

[Wendell] buck then 1 . It really takes
the pressure off'."
Wendell hit .320 for 10 kills to go
along with 29 assists and 12 digs for
her ninth triple-double of the sea
son. The Northern lowa match
marked the first match this season
in which two Cardinal players regis
tered triple-doubles.
After discovering the openings
on the right side, Stanford encoun
tered much less trouble in game
two, racing to a 13-4 lead before
staving oft a Panther rally to take
the game 15-8.
"I was surprised that they kept
leaving [the right side| open,"
Shaw said. "Even in game three
[after a 10-minute break], it was
unbelievable bow they kept tilting
us to the right and letting |Sharp-
ley | hit."
Schoeberl provided her own
explanation for the Panthers'
defensive breakdown. "We're not
used to teams having enough good

outside hitters to stack the right
side that strong," she said. "We
weren't ready for it, so our blockers
couldn't get there in time. Most of
the teams we play don't use the long
taick set or the fast quick set hack to
the right, so we didn't really know
how to deal with it."
Sharpley added that Stanford's
depth makes it difficult for oppo
nents to prepare for the Cardinal.
"I think that sometimes I get
overlooked lon game film]," Sharp
ley said. "When you know you have
to stop Folkl and Wendell, maybe
[our opponents] think that I'm the
person they don't have to worry
about so much."
After the brejik, the match got
ugly for Northern lowa, as the Car
dinal refused to let the Panthers
into pime three. After UNI took a 1 -
0 lead, Stanford scored seven
straight points, the first coming off
of a kill by a rejuvenated Triefen
bach. After a poor pass allowed the

Panthers to score a second point,
the Cardinal reeled off five more for
a 12-2 edge. A Folkl hitting error
gave Northern lowa its only other
point of the game.
"We're used to playing from
behind [in game onej," Shaw said.
" It's a matter of us taking a while to
figure out what our opponent is
doing and then adjusting. Once we
get rolling, though, we can be
scary."
The Cardinal will next face USC,
which downed No. 9 Pacific in
straight games in the second round.
The Trojans were the only Pacific
10 Conference team that did not
receive a first-round bye in the tour
nament. In the first round, the
Women of Troy defeated North
Texas easily in three games.
"I'm sure they'll love coming to
Maples again," Shaw said. Stanford
defeated USC twice this season,
including a four-game victory in
Maples Pavilion in October.
