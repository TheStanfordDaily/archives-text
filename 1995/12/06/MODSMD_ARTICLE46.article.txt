The No. 3 Stanford women's
volleyball team's opening match
in the NCAA Tournament paral
leled the unfolding of the Cardi
nal's 1995 season. After a slow
start, Stanford (27-2) eventually
pulled itself together to dominate
down the stretch, defeating No.
24 Northern lowa (28-2) 15-12,
15-8, 15-3 Saturday night in
Maples Pavilion.
"I have to give Northern lowa
a lot of credit," said Stanford head
coach Don Shaw. "We weren't
playing the way we're capable of
playing early on, but a lot of that
is because of the way they were
playing. They played well and
made us adjust our game."
Indeed, the first game proved
particularly competitive. The
defending national champions
appeared nervous in the early
going despite expecting an easy
match against a Panther team
that had not previously played a
ranked opponent. Poor passing, a
Northern lowa service ace and
strong setting from Panther
senior Kara Gaeler allowed
underdog Northern lowa to jump
to a 4-0 lead.
However, Stanford immediate
ly jumped back into the game
thanks to errors from Gaeler and
Panther senior outside hitter Jill
Schoeberl. The Cardinal scored
the next three points to pull with

in 4-3.
After trading points twice,
Northern lowa began to pull away
once again due to a swarm of
Stanford errors. Forced into the
starting lineup after senior out
side hitter Wendy Hrornadka frac
tured her wrist in practice, senior
Marnie Triefenbach committed
four hitting errors while register
ing only one kill in game one.

"Mamie wasn't ready to roll
[Saturday night]," Shaw said.
"But wo are fortunate enough to
have subs like (sophomore Deb
bie] Lambert, who can come in
and play well if someone is strug
gling."
Shaw pulled Triefenbach with
the Panthers ahead 9-5. After-
Northern lowa scored again,
Shaw made his second important

substitution of the game, insert
ing junior Catherine Julliard into
the lineup. Julliard served up four
consecutive points, and the Cardi
nal was back in the game.
After Stanford tied the game
on a dink by sophomore middle
blocker Barbara Ifejika, the Pan
thers scored to take an 11-10 lead.
