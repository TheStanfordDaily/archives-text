Stanford men's basketball may have passed the
midterm, but it failed the final, as No. 17 North Car
olina demolished the No. 16 Cardinal 87-63 in the
championship game of the Harris Teeter / Diet Pepsi
Tournament of Champions last Saturday night in
Charlotte, N.C.
The Tar Heels (5-1) went on a 28-7 run over the
final 10 minutes, 21 seconds of the first half to jump
out to a 20-point halftime lead and then closed the
door on Stanford (3-2) with a 30-13 run to open the
second half in front of 17,948 screaming Carolina
fans.
"Hopefully, that is not indicative of the ball team
we are," said Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "That's disappointing based on (Friday]
night's performance. We need to be more confident
and more aggressive."
The shooting woes that plagued Stanford against
San Francisco resurfaced, as the Tar Heel 2-3 / 1-3-1
zone defense limited the Cardinal to 28.6 percent
