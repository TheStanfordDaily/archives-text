Stanford men's basketball may have passed the
midterm, but it failed the final, as No. 17 North Car
olina demolished the No. 16 Cardinal 87-63 in the
championship game of the Harris Teeter / Diet Pepsi
Tournament of Champions last Saturday night in
Charlotte, N.C.
The Tar Heels (5-1) went on a 28-7 run over the
final 10 minutes, 21 seconds of the first half to jump
out to a 20-point halftime lead and then closed the
door on Stanford (3-2) with a 30-13 run to open the
second half in front of 17,948 screaming Carolina
fans.
"Hopefully, that is not indicative of the ball team
we are," said Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "That's disappointing based on (Friday]
night's performance. We need to be more confident
and more aggressive."
The shooting woes that plagued Stanford against
San Francisco resurfaced, as the Tar Heel 2-3 / 1-3-1
zone defense limited the Cardinal to 28.6 percent

shooting in the first half, 31.9
percent for the game.
Stanford was most disappoint
ed by the fact that the current
Carolina team is the weakest
head coach Dean Smith has ever
assembled in his 35-year career.
In addition, Vince Carter's
sprained ankle, suffered Friday
night against Tulane, cut the Tar
Heel seven-man rotation to six.
North Carolina dropped to five
when Dante Calabria departed
just two minutes, 57 seconds into
the game with a twisted ankle.
However, Calabria reentered the
game at the 10:31 mark with Car
olina ahead 13-12. After two free
throws by Stanford center Tim
Young, the Tar Heels took off on
their big first-half run to enter
the break up 41-21. Junior point
guard Jeff Mclnnis scored 13
first-half points en route to a 20-
point performance and the Most
Valuable Player award for the
tournament.
"1 was pleasantly surprised at
our performance and equally sur
prised at Stanford and how they
didn't shoot the ball well," Smith
said. "We were able to score more
easily than I thought. Mclnnis did
a nice job on [junior point guard |
Brevin [Knight] in the beginning.
When he scored on Brevin, it
helped his confidence."
Although Carolina only shot
44.1 percent in the first half, the
Tar Heels managed to rebound
well out of the zone, outboarding
Stanford 26-16 in the first half.
The zone also kept the thin Tar
Heel squad out of foul trouble.
"We didn't shoot the ball well
and that translates into other
things that don't go well," Mont
gomery said. "We're not defend
ing, not rebounding and then the
whole thing slides downhill."
The Tar Heel starting five out
shot Stanford's starters 50 per
cent to 33 percent and outscored
the Cardinal 77-37.
Stanford's first-half hole came

unexpectedly because the offense
was getting the type of perimeter
shots it wanted against the zone.
However, the Cardinal was
unable to take it right at 7-foot-2
Serge Zwikker inside, a failure
Montgomery believed was fatal.
"Our shots weren't falling.
That was the reason we got down
and stayed down," said senior for
ward Andy Poppink. "We're just
having a hard time, and we don't
know exactly why. Even though
we were playing poorly, I thought
we were in reasonable range.
"Once we got down, our
defense goes down and maybe our
confidence is shot because our
shots weren't falling."
Senior Dion Cross struggled
the most in the first half, hitting
only one of 10 shots. However, he
started to shoot himself out of his
slump in the second half, connect
ing on four-of-six from three
point land to finish with 17
points. Over the past three
games, Cross is shooting only 26
percent.
Young, a sophomore, and
senior David Harbour remain
caught in similar slumps. Young
twisted his ankle in Stanford's
82-70 win over South Carolina
last Friday night and played only
23 minutes against North Caroli
na. Harbour was three-for-13
over the weekend, although his
presence helped jump-start Stan
ford's offense against the Game
cocks.
"Harbour was a big key,"
Montgomery said after Friday
night's victory. "He plays reck
less, and that kind of keys our
team — like it turned on a
switch."
No such ignition was to be
found against the Tar Heels, how
ever. No one stepped up to take
control, and Stanford was out
hustled on most plays.
"You are going to miss shots,
that's part of the game," said
Knight, who earned all-tourna
ment honors by averaging 12.5
points and 8.5 assists over the two
games. "We're not doing the little
things, like playing together."
North Carolina proved the

opposite, as it put together a very
workman like performance exe
cuting its system. Every player
did what was needed to win and
sent North Carolina's message
loudly and clearly — shoot 29 per
cent against San Francisco and
lose by one, but shoot 31 percent
against the Tar Heels and get
embarrassed.
"We just let it slip away," said
freshman forward Peter Sauer.
"Nobody wanted to get it done
and we paid the price. They are
not 30 points better than us."
Sauer's first-half play was key
in Stanford's win over the Game
cocks on Friday night. His 13
first-half points on five-of-five
shooting, including a three-point
er at the buzzer, pushed the Car
dinal to a 38-34 halftime lead.
Midway through the second
half, Cross finally found his range
and buried back-to-back three
pointers, giving Stanford an 11-
point advantage. Cross also shut
down Larry Davis, who scorched
the Cardinal for 16 first-half
points but mustered only two free
throws in the second half.
"That was pleasing because we
played hard," Montgomery said.
"We were able to break their
momentum with crucial plays.
We got a lot off the break, which
was absolutely critical. Sauer
saved our bacon in the first half."
Knight paced Stanford with 19
points and nine assists, but would
have registered closer to 15 assist
were it not for numerous hobbled
passes. The Cardinal also domi
nated the boards, grabbing 24
offensive caroms and out
rebounding the Gamecocks by 12.
To advance to the final round,
North Carolina beat Tulane 89-71
behind 18 points and nine
rebounds from freshman Antawn
Jamison. Saturday, South Caroli
na (3-1) got past Tulane (2-2) 80-
75 in the consolation game behind
Davis' 24-point outburst. Davis,
who averaged 21 points per game,
joined Jamison (19.5 ppg and 8.5
rpg), Calabria (15 ppg, seven-for
-11 three-point shooting), Knight
and Mclnnis on the all-tourna
ment team.

gomery. "That's disappointing based on (Friday]
night's performance. We need to be more confident
and more aggressive."
The shooting woes that plagued Stanford against
San Francisco resurfaced, as the Tar Heel 2-3 / 1-3-1
zone defense limited the Cardinal to 28.6 percent

shooting in the first half, 31.9
percent for the game.
Stanford was most disappoint
ed by the fact that the current
Carolina team is the weakest
head coach Dean Smith has ever
assembled in his 35-year career.
In addition, Vince Carter's
sprained ankle, suffered Friday
night against Tulane, cut the Tar
Heel seven-man rotation to six.
North Carolina dropped to five
when Dante Calabria departed
just two minutes, 57 seconds into
the game with a twisted ankle.
However, Calabria reentered the
game at the 10:31 mark with Car
olina ahead 13-12. After two free
throws by Stanford center Tim
Young, the Tar Heels took off on
their big first-half run to enter
the break up 41-21. Junior point
guard Jeff Mclnnis scored 13
first-half points en route to a 20-
point performance and the Most
Valuable Player award for the
tournament.
"1 was pleasantly surprised at
our performance and equally sur
prised at Stanford and how they
didn't shoot the ball well," Smith
said. "We were able to score more
easily than I thought. Mclnnis did
a nice job on [junior point guard |
Brevin [Knight] in the beginning.
When he scored on Brevin, it
helped his confidence."
Although Carolina only shot
44.1 percent in the first half, the
Tar Heels managed to rebound
well out of the zone, outboarding
Stanford 26-16 in the first half.
The zone also kept the thin Tar
Heel squad out of foul trouble.
"We didn't shoot the ball well
and that translates into other
things that don't go well," Mont
gomery said. "We're not defend
ing, not rebounding and then the
whole thing slides downhill."
The Tar Heel starting five out
shot Stanford's starters 50 per
cent to 33 percent and outscored
the Cardinal 77-37.
Stanford's first-half hole came

unexpectedly because the offense
was getting the type of perimeter
shots it wanted against the zone.
However, the Cardinal was
unable to take it right at 7-foot-2
Serge Zwikker inside, a failure
Montgomery believed was fatal.
"Our shots weren't falling.
That was the reason we got down
and stayed down," said senior for
ward Andy Poppink. "We're just
having a hard time, and we don't
know exactly why. Even though
we were playing poorly, I thought
we were in reasonable range.
"Once we got down, our
defense goes down and maybe our
confidence is shot because our
shots weren't falling."
Senior Dion Cross struggled
the most in the first half, hitting
only one of 10 shots. However, he
started to shoot himself out of his
slump in the second half, connect
ing on four-of-six from three
point land to finish with 17
points. Over the past three
games, Cross is shooting only 26
percent.
Young, a sophomore, and
senior David Harbour remain
caught in similar slumps. Young
twisted his ankle in Stanford's
82-70 win over South Carolina
last Friday night and played only
23 minutes against North Caroli
na. Harbour was three-for-13
over the weekend, although his
presence helped jump-start Stan
ford's offense against the Game
cocks.
"Harbour was a big key,"
Montgomery said after Friday
night's victory. "He plays reck
less, and that kind of keys our
team — like it turned on a
switch."
No such ignition was to be
found against the Tar Heels, how
ever. No one stepped up to take
control, and Stanford was out
hustled on most plays.
"You are going to miss shots,
that's part of the game," said
Knight, who earned all-tourna
ment honors by averaging 12.5
points and 8.5 assists over the two
games. "We're not doing the little
things, like playing together."
North Carolina proved the

opposite, as it put together a very
workman like performance exe
cuting its system. Every player
did what was needed to win and
sent North Carolina's message
loudly and clearly — shoot 29 per
cent against San Francisco and
lose by one, but shoot 31 percent
against the Tar Heels and get
embarrassed.
"We just let it slip away," said
freshman forward Peter Sauer.
"Nobody wanted to get it done
and we paid the price. They are
not 30 points better than us."
Sauer's first-half play was key
in Stanford's win over the Game
cocks on Friday night. His 13
first-half points on five-of-five
shooting, including a three-point
er at the buzzer, pushed the Car
dinal to a 38-34 halftime lead.
Midway through the second
half, Cross finally found his range
and buried back-to-back three
pointers, giving Stanford an 11-
point advantage. Cross also shut
down Larry Davis, who scorched
the Cardinal for 16 first-half
points but mustered only two free
throws in the second half.
"That was pleasing because we
played hard," Montgomery said.
"We were able to break their
momentum with crucial plays.
We got a lot off the break, which
was absolutely critical. Sauer
saved our bacon in the first half."
Knight paced Stanford with 19
points and nine assists, but would
have registered closer to 15 assist
were it not for numerous hobbled
passes. The Cardinal also domi
nated the boards, grabbing 24
offensive caroms and out
rebounding the Gamecocks by 12.
To advance to the final round,
North Carolina beat Tulane 89-71
behind 18 points and nine
rebounds from freshman Antawn
Jamison. Saturday, South Caroli
na (3-1) got past Tulane (2-2) 80-
75 in the consolation game behind
Davis' 24-point outburst. Davis,
who averaged 21 points per game,
joined Jamison (19.5 ppg and 8.5
rpg), Calabria (15 ppg, seven-for
-11 three-point shooting), Knight
and Mclnnis on the all-tourna
ment team.

Stanford men's basketball may have passed the
midterm, but it failed the final, as No. 17 North Car
olina demolished the No. 16 Cardinal 87-63 in the
championship game of the Harris Teeter / Diet Pepsi
Tournament of Champions last Saturday night in
Charlotte, N.C.
The Tar Heels (5-1) went on a 28-7 run over the
final 10 minutes, 21 seconds of the first half to jump
out to a 20-point halftime lead and then closed the
door on Stanford (3-2) with a 30-13 run to open the
second half in front of 17,948 screaming Carolina
fans.
"Hopefully, that is not indicative of the ball team
we are," said Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "That's disappointing based on (Friday]
night's performance. We need to be more confident
and more aggressive."
