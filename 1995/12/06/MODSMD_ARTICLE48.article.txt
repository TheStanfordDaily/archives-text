# No.1 women's swimming defeats the nation's best down in Texas

### John Fabian Staff writer 
The Stanford women's swimming team traveled
to Austin, Texas, last weekend to compete against
the best swimmers in the country at the 1995 Ail-
American Long Course Championships. No. 2
Michigan, No. 3 Texas and No. 4 Southern
Methodist all participated.
In its first three-day meet of the season, Stanford
asserted its dominance in preparation for the big
three meets this spring — the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, the Olympic trials and the NCAA
Championships in March.
"We did really well," said co-captain Jane Skill
man. "December's an odd time, an odd stage of the
game. We're doing distance training now, so we real
ly haven't worked on our speed. We're going to con
tinue our long-distance training, and by the start of
the new year, we're going to work on getting out
faster."
The Cardinal demonstrated that if it continues
training successfully, Stanford should win its fifth
straight NCAA championship.
"We're still really far from NCAAs," said sopho
more Claudia Franco. "But after this weekend,
we're on a good path to reach all of the goals we have
this year."
In addition to measuring the Cardinal's level of
preparation, the Texas Invite provided an opportu
nity for Stanford to swim in an exhausting three-day
meet.
"It was good to do an NCAA-like performance,"
Skillman said. "It's a marathon meet, and it's tough
to get in that frame of mind."
Such a competition let the freshmen mold into

their role on the team and allowed the leaders to
prove the value of experience.
"Everyone gets along really well, and we support
each other a lot," Franco said. "The freshmen are
really great. They have really become a part of the
team already. We had really good dynamics this
weekend, and the team had a great performance,
especially from the seniors and our team captains

The Invite gave head coach
Richard Quick a chance to
assess where the Cardinal
stands among the nation's elite.
It provided rematches against
the Wolverines, whom the Car
dinal ousted from the No. 1
ranking in October with a 174-
1'26 victory, and Texas, whom
Stanford defeated 182-117 at
deGuerre Fool on Nov. 17.
"I think everyone on our
team knows that if we keep get
ting the job done like we have
that no one's going to be able to
beat us," Jacob said.
The Cardinal did just that in
the 400-meter freestyle relay
and captured the top two places.
"When we took first and sec
ond in the 400 free relay, that
was huge," Skillman said.
"That puts a big mental hurt on
people when we have eight
swimmers who can beat their
four.
"Not to take anything away
from Michigan — they will be
awesome in March. Hut every
time we do what we did this
weekend and at the dual meets,
we're chipping away at their
egos."
In the end, the most impor

tant aspect of the meet was the
level of individual performance.
From that standpoint, the Car
dinal succeeded. In the second
women's event, Jacob and Skill
man made Olympic trial cuts in
the 400-meter freestyle by plac

ing third and fourth overall,
first and second at the colle
giate level. By the end of the
meet, 10 swimmers had earned
NCAA consideration cuts.
Highlights included Jacob's
first-place performance in the

200-meter freestyle, the 800-
meter freestyle relay team's vic
tory and senior Jessica Tong's
first-place effort in the 100-
meter freestyle.
"Everyone had a really good
meet," Jacob said. "It was good

to go down there and race
against Michigan and Texas and
ISMUJ, the people that we're
going to he competing against at
NCAAs. I thought we all did
well racing against our competi
tion. Everyone did their job."

Despite training for distance at this point in the season, the Cardinal women's swimmers turned in some impressive times in Texas last
weekend against the likes of No. 2 Michigan.
