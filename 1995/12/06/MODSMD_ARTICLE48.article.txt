### John Fabian Staff writer 
The Stanford women's swimming team traveled
to Austin, Texas, last weekend to compete against
the best swimmers in the country at the 1995 Ail-
American Long Course Championships. No. 2
Michigan, No. 3 Texas and No. 4 Southern
Methodist all participated.
In its first three-day meet of the season, Stanford
asserted its dominance in preparation for the big
three meets this spring — the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, the Olympic trials and the NCAA
Championships in March.
"We did really well," said co-captain Jane Skill
man. "December's an odd time, an odd stage of the
game. We're doing distance training now, so we real
ly haven't worked on our speed. We're going to con
tinue our long-distance training, and by the start of
the new year, we're going to work on getting out
faster."
The Cardinal demonstrated that if it continues
training successfully, Stanford should win its fifth
straight NCAA championship.
"We're still really far from NCAAs," said sopho
more Claudia Franco. "But after this weekend,
we're on a good path to reach all of the goals we have
this year."
In addition to measuring the Cardinal's level of
preparation, the Texas Invite provided an opportu
nity for Stanford to swim in an exhausting three-day
meet.
"It was good to do an NCAA-like performance,"
Skillman said. "It's a marathon meet, and it's tough
to get in that frame of mind."
Such a competition let the freshmen mold into

their role on the team and allowed the leaders to
prove the value of experience.
"Everyone gets along really well, and we support
each other a lot," Franco said. "The freshmen are
really great. They have really become a part of the
team already. We had really good dynamics this
weekend, and the team had a great performance,
especially from the seniors and our team captains
