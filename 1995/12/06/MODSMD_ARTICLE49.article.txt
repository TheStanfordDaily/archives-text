Georgia 67-64 and clobbered
California by 22 points, but the
Old Dominion Lady Monarchs
(3-1) couldn't put a dent in the
llth-ranked Cardinal women's
basketball team (2-1) last Friday
night in Maples Pavilion.
Led by the outside shooting of
junior Kate Starbird and sopho
more forward Vanessa Nygaard,
Stanford built a 19-point half
time lead against the 21st
ranked and previously undefeat
ed Lady Monarchs and held on
for a 97-76 victory in its home
debut.
"My job is to shoot the ball,"
said Nygaard, who nailed six of
nine three-pointers en route to a
career-high 29 points. "I don't
think you should have a mental
ity about shooting — you just
shoot it."
"Shoot it" is exactly what the
Cardinal did against a very phvs

tried unsuccessfully to mix a

age. And with 6-foot-5 forward

nal had little choice but to work
the ball around and put it up from

the outside.
"From the tapes that we had
seen, [we knew] they were very
active defensively," said Stanford
head coach Amy Tucker. "We
knew we had to take care of the
ball. We knew we'd have to make

the extra pass and reverse it [so]
we could break them down."
Things didn't look promising at
the start, however. Machanguana
scored her team's first six points as
Old Dominion raced out to a 6-2
lead. But Starbird and Nygaard
buried successive three-pointers to
give Stanford an 8-6 advantage,
and the Cardinal never looked
back. With nearly all of Nygaard's
shots falling (she was six-of-eight
from the floor in the first hall) and
Starbird scoring from both inside
and outside, the Cardinal managed
to build a 55-36 lead at halflime.
But the suspense wasn't over
yet. The Cardinal came out flat in
the second half, allowing Old
Dominion to climb within strik
ing distance. Stacy Himes' eight
foot jumper with 12 minutes, 48
seconds remaining cut Stanford's
lead to 10 at 63-53.
"I was getting a little worried,"
Tucker said. "I was a little con
cerned that we didn't come out in
the second half with the intensity
that we needed to."
But just when it appeared that
Stanford had lost all its momen
tum, Nygaard reasserted herself.
Working in tandem with Starbird
again, who finished with a career
best 31 points, the sophomore
buried three treys in less than
four minutes to put the Cardinal
ahead 75-57. The rest was merely
an afterthought.
"Vanessa gives other teams a
matchup problem as a '4.' She can
obviously pull you out to the three
point line, and she's very effective
there," Tucker said. "She has a lot
of confidence in herself. She's been
watching and waiting for her turn,
so she's definitely put in her time
to be in this position."
The Cardinal — which set a
school record with 30 three-point
attempts in its season-opening loss
to Massachusetts — has suddenly
taken a liking to the long bomb.
"I wouldn't say we live and die
by the three-point shot," Nygaard
said. "I think we're good three
point shooters. That's the shot we
look for and that was probably
the turnaround."
But Tucker would rather see a
more balanced inside-outside
attack from the Cardinal. "We
need some point production from
our post players, from Naomi
[Mulitauaopele], from Chandra
[Benton|, from Olympia [Scott],
from Heather [Owen]. 1 think
we're as good as anybody inside
— when they want the bail, when
they work hard to get the ball."
