## Stanford Ballet brings Tchaikovsky classic to the Farm 
### Mary Megan Peer 
If too much studying for finals has kept you
from getting in the holiday spirit, the Stanford Bal
let may have the answer.
Tonight and tomorrow night, the Stanford Bal
let will bring the Christmas spirit to Dinkelspiel
Auditorium with their production of the second act
of "The Nutcracker". Last year the event sold out
both nights. This year promises to be even better
with the addition of live music performed by the
Stanford Orchestra and a bigger corps of dancers
performing on stage.
The show will begin with a half hour of carols
and other festive songs performed by the Harmon
ics, an a cappella group.
Then members of the Stanford Ballet, a group
founded in 1994 by senior Julia Ball, will take to
the stage as the orchestra plays Tchaikovsky's
Nutcracker.
"The orchestra will add a lot from the audi
ence's perspective; the whole atmosphere will
change. Even some professional companies don't
have live music when they perform," Ball said.
Some members of the Stanford Ballet have per
formed with professional companies. Ball, who will
dance the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy, was a pro
fessional dancer for five years before coming to col
lege. She has danced with the Sacramento Ballet,
Eugene Ballet, Tulsa Ballet Theater and the Amer
ican Festival Ballet. Her experience as a soloist in
cludes the Snow Queen in"The Nutcracker".
According to senior Jennifer Mott, executive di
rector of the Stanford Ballet, "the ex-professional
dancers add an artistic quality to the group we
might not have otherwise."
Mott danced with the Cleveland Ballet for four
years before coming to Stanford and said that
when she came here she was "amazed at the caliber
of dancers at Stanford who did not choose to go on

professionally but went to college."
Out of the cast of about 30 performing in"The
Nutcracker", many are not dance majors even though
most have been dancing since a veiy young age.
The dancers include senior Karen Simon per
forming Arabian, senior Jenny James dancing the
Shepherdess and senior Anne Pollack leading the
Waltz of the Flowers as the Dewdrop Fairy. Both
Simon and James will be partnered by senior Mark
Booth, a member of the men's gymnastics team.
Other roles include the Spanish Dancer, played by
Eva Aaslid, and the Chinese Girls: Cecilia Takaya
ma, Brittney Jensen and Monica Chen.
The choreography is a combination of Ball's
work and some restaged versions of Lew Chris
ten's choreography for the San Francisco Ballet's
Nutcracker.
"The Nutcracker" is a Christmas tradition in
part because it takes place at a party held on Christ
mas Eve. The children are given gifts to keep them
entertained and Clara receives a Nutcracker from
her eccentric uncle. After fighting with her brother
for the toy, she falls asleep with it. The second act,
which the group will perform, shows Clara's dream
as she travels with "The Nutcracker", now a prince.
"The different variations which supposedly
take place in different countries make it a very fast
paced show. It's great even for somebody who
hasn't seen a lot of ballet," Ball said.
Giancarlo Aquilianti, the orchestra's conductor,
also said he believes it will be a great show.
"Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker is a wonderful piece
of music. Sometimes it is underestimated because
it is done so much, but there is a reason it has be
come so famous: The composer knew about ballet
and orchestration," he said.
The show will take place at 8 p.m. on Friday and
Saturday nights. Tickets are $6 for students and
$12 general admission and are available in the
Tresidder Box Office.
