# Men's hoops hits road before hosting Wildcats, Sun Devils
## Montgomery and Co. look to break out of shooting slump 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
It seems simple enough.
There's even room for two of
them to fit through at the same
time. But right now, nothing is
more difficult for Stanford's
men's basketball team than
putting the ball through the hoop.
After burning up the Fry's
Invitational at a 59 percent clip,
the Cardinal field-goal percentage
has plummeted to 45.5 after
shooting only 38.1 percent over
the last three games. Those prob
lems have translated into a 3-2
record and a free fall in the rank
ings, from No. 1(5 to No. 24.
"We have got to go back to the
drawing board," said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "We need to
go back to the things that make us
a good team, doing the things we
do well. And we have got to get
healthy."
Even though the season is only
five games old, Stanford is already
feeling like it has gone through
the wars of January and Febru
ary. Almost every veteran is nurs
ing some sort of sprain or pain,
with Brevin Knight heading the
list.
Shin problems and back
spasms slowed the junior point
guard during last weekend's tour
nament in North Carolina.
Sophomore center Tim Young
twisted an ankle against South
Carolina last Friday, cutting his
performance and damaging his
already shaky confidence.
Along with these new injuries,
several team members have
chronic physical problems that
will not go away. Senior guard
Dion Cross constantly battles sore
knees, senior forward Darren All
away's bad back is something the
senior has learned to play with,
and senior Andy Poppink has suf
fered through a variety of bumps
and bruises this year.
"We're like a bunch of old
men," Montgomery said.
The declining performance has
had a devastating effect on the
team's intensity and teamwork.

Peter Sauer, a freshman who
sparked the offense in the first
half against the Gamecocks,
believes the problems are both
mental and physical.
"It's a matter of working
together," he said. "We've got five
freshmen and six or eight good
veterans. We just have to realize
that we can be a good team."
Rather than "digging and
working" to make the extra pass
or trigger the fast break, the team
has yet to find a way to handle
adversity, according to Mont
gomery.
"The wake-up call should have
come against USF," Knight said.
"When you are not shooting the
ball, you have got to do the little
things, like hustling and getting
loose balls. We're not playing
together.
"Once we do that, once we get
back together, our shots will go
down because you are comfortable
with everything else and you'll be
rolling."
After an exhibition game
against High Five America Dec.
15 at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavil
ion, the Cardinal will rest until it
heads east again before taking a
few days off for Christmas.
The lone road trip over winter
break will take the Cardinal back
to Annapolis, M.D. to tackle Navy
on Dec. 22. Boasting the best
backcourt in the Patriot League,
Navy (1-1) finished last year with
a 20-9 record.
Stanford will then return to
Maples Pavilion for a Dec. 28
matchup with American (2-1).
Last year, the Cardinal got past
the Eagles 97-71 behind a near
triple-double by Knight (17
points, a career-high 11 rebounds,
nine assists and six steals) and 25
points from Cross.
Like Navy, the Eagles also fea
ture a strong backcourt wit h point
guard Darryl Franklin and shoot
ers Duane Gilliam and Nathan
Smith. Senior forward Tim Fudd,
an all-conference selection two
years ago, sat out last season with
a knee injury, but has returned to
shore up a young front line.

Harvard (3-0) will come to
Maples Dec. 30 in a contest that
the Crimson probably wishes
were taking place in the classroom
and not on the hardwood. Har
vard is undersized along the front
line, running 6-foot-8, 6-7 and 6-
5, which should allow Stanford to
dominate inside.
The game at Navy will begin at
7:30 p.m. EST, and both home
games will tip off at 7:30 p.m.
PST.
Stanford's Pacific 10 Confer
ence schedule will open when Ari
zona State (2-1) and No. 4 Ari
zona (5-0) come to Maples on Jan.
4 and 6, respectively. That means
two of the toughest conference
teams get to play Stanford before
winter quarter starts and not in
front of the hostile Maples crowd.
The Sun Devils, led by senior
forward Hon Riley, look to build
off a Sweet Sixteen finish last year
despite returning only four letter
men. Riley averaged 16.0 points
and 5.3 rebounds per game last
season for head coach Bill Frieder.
As for Arizona, the new front
runners for the Pac-10 crown, the
Wildcats barely escaped Maples
with a 89-83 overtime victory last
year. Stanford had a chance to
win the game in regulation, but a
Cross jump shot and a Bart Lam
mersen tip both missed the mark
in the final seconds. Arizona
point guard Damon Stoudamire
set a Maples Pavilion record,
torching the Cardinal for 45
points.
This year, the Wildcats
stormed through the preseason
NIT field with wins over Long
Beach State, Arkansas, Michigan
and Georgetown to move up to its
current ranking in the polls.
If Stanford doesn't find the
solution to its funk over the next
month, the opening of the Pac-10
schedule could drive the team's
confidence into the ground.
"We're going to have to be
ready to play come January,"
Sauer said. "If we play at all like
we did [against North Carolina],
we're going to have a hard time
getting to any postseason at all."
