This winter break, while every
one rests in the protective confines
of their homes, the Stanford
wrestling team will be trying to take
down some of the best names in
wrestling at three separate tourna
ments.
On Dec. 28 mid 29, wrestlers will
compete in the Oregon Classic, a
tournament which takes place in
Corvallis, Ore. On Dec. 29 and 30,
the team will send three of its mem
bers to compete in the Midlands
Tournament, to be held at North
western in Evanston, 111. Finally, on
Jan. 7, the entire team will compete
in the Country Classic Open in Bak
ersfield, Calif.
The Oregon Classic at Oregon
State is a convenient tournament
for the Cardinal because so m.iny of
its wrestlers come from that area
and that tournament draws some of
the nation's top wrestlers, providing
strong competition which will help
hone the team's skills and maintain
their conditioning.
The Stanford squad plans to
send 11 wrestlers to the tourna
ment. Head coach Chris Horpel will
fly to the tournament with seniors
Jimmy Aguirre (134 pounds), Matt
Cano (126) and Sahlan Martin
(158). All other wrestlers who will
participate hail from Oregon or
Washington and will meet the squad
at the tournament. Freshman Doug
Bardsley (150), sophomores Jason

Gladden (177), JefTGrant (158) and
Mark Neglay (heavyweight), juniors
Ryan Barnes (150) and Bryan Vani
man (190) and senior Thomas Irwin
are scheduled to compete in the
tournament. Senior co-captain Tod
Surmon (142) is highly unlikely to
participate since he tore cartilage in
his right knee at the Las Vegas Invi
tational, where he finished with a
stunning 3-0 record afler defeating
the sixth and second seeds. Head
coach Chris Horpel said that Sur
mon will probably be out for one
month with his injury.
The Cardinal is set to send assis
tant coach Mike Schmidlin (150),
and sophomore starters Scott Chap
man (167) and Robert Hatta (134)
to the Midlands Tournament one
day afler the Oregon Classic. Since
the tournament is open, wrestlers of
all ages will have the opportunity to
compete, providing overall stiff
tournament competition.
Just over one week later, all 31
Stanford wrestlers will participate
in the Country Classic Open. This
tournament will feature many West
Coast teams and Lehigh, a perenni
al top-10 team. According to Horpel,
this allows the team to get a glimpse
at some tough, new competition.
All three of these open tourna
ments should present stronger,
more seasoned competition than
years past, Horpel said. The intensi
ty increases because this is an
Olympic year, and these tourna
ments are used as tune-ups by those
vying for spots on the Olympic team.
