# Women's basketball staying right at home this Christmas
## Cardinal prepares to host four straight home games 
### Bobby Cuza Contributing writer 
It will be home, sweet home
for the Stanford women's bas
ketball team this holiday season
— at least until Christmas.
The 1 lth-ranked Cardinal (2-
1), which defeated No. 21 Old
Dominion 97-76 last Friday, will
play its next four games in
Maples Pavilion — where the
team has won 18 straight —
before hitting the road for games
at Texas Tech and Texas Dec. 28
and Dec. 30, respectively.
As usual, Stanford has sched
uled some grueling preseason
matchups, including the annual
showdown with the Tennessee
Lady Vols, currently ranked No.
2 in the nation, and the Dec. 28
clash with 12th-ranked Texas
Tech. Pacific 10 Conference play
will open Jan. 4 when the Cardi
nal travels to Tempe, Ariz, to
take on Arizona State.
"We like to play a tough
schedule," said head coach Amy
Tucker.
Stanford has already
encountered some stiff compe
tition in its first three games.
In the season opener at
Amherst, Mass., unranked
Massachusetts stunned the
Cardinal 65-56. After disposing
of Providence 81-58, Stanford
returned home to meet an
upstart Old Dominion team
that shocked former-No. 2
Georgia 67-64 earlier this sea
son. But behind career-best
performances from junior Kate
Starbird and sophomore Vanes
sa Nygaard, Stanford built a
55-36 halftime lead en route to
a 21-point victory over the Lady
Monarchs.
The Cardinal currently finds
itself in the midst of an eight
day lull between games. The
women don't compete again
until Sunday afternoon, when
they will host undefeated Santa
Clara (3-0) at 2 p.m.
"We're going to work a lot on
half-court execution," Tucker
said. "IWe'll| use [the one-week
break| to work on working

against zones and to get some
people healthy — some people
need some days off to rest a little
bit. But I think our half-court
execution is our top priority,
whether it's man or zone, but
especially zone."
With three frontcourt players
measuring 6-foot-2 or taller in
6-2 Heather Owen, 6-2 Olympia
Scott and 6-3 Naomi Muli
tauaopele — not to mention 6-7
redshirt freshman Chandra
Benton — Stanford creates indi
vidual matchup problems for a
lot of its opponents. As a result,
teams have gone to a zone
defense and forced the Cardinal
to make the outside shot, a
strategy that worked mar
velously for UMass.
"We have to establish an
inside game," Tucker said. "We
don't want people collapsing on
us. We don't want them just to
say, 'Well, we're going to zone
Stanford and make them beat us

It's still early, but
we have a couple
of big tests coming
up here soon. I feel
pretty comfortable,
but we have a week
of practice here and
we've got to put
some things togeth
er.'

from the outside.' Then you
have to hit it.
"UMass did it to us and
Vanessa hit seven threes, but
besides that, no one else was
hot. We never really estab
lished any type of inside game
against UMass and, with the
exception of Vanessa, no one
was hitting outside. And the

longer that happens, the more
tentative people get from the
perimeter."
Nygaard has certainly shoul
dered her share of the load. She
currently leads the team with
21.0 points and 7.3 rebounds per
game. Against UMass, she
buried seven of 15 three-point
ers (her 15 three-point field-goal
attempts tied a school record)
and tallied what was then a
career-high '25 points.
Nygaard bettered that scoring
total Friday night against Old
Dominion with 29 points, second
only to Starbird's 31. Starbird,
who also collected four
rebounds, seven assists, two
steals and two blocks on the
evening, earned Pac-10 Player of
the Week honors for her perfor
mance.
"There's always been high
expectations for Kate," Tucker
said, "but I've been pleasantly
surprised by Vanessa."
Stanford will look to extend
its home winning streak to 19
when it takes to the court
against Santa Clara this Sunday.
The Cardinal will meet No. 2
Tennessee (6-0) Saturday, Dec.
16 at 7 p.m.
"Tennessee is always a big
game," Tucker said. "Whether
you win or lose, [playing them]
points out what you really need
to improve on."
The 10th Annual Fry's / Car
dinal Classic will take place Dec.
19-20 at Maples Pavilion. Stan
ford will face Cal State-Sacra
mento while Auburn battles
Eastern Washington, with the
winners advancing to the cham
pionship game. Following the
tournament, the women will
finally get a chance to go home
and spend some time with their
families before returning to
school for the road trip to
Texas.
"Obviously it's still early in
the season, but we have a couple
of big tests coming up here
soon," Tucker said. "I feel pretty

Vanessa hit seven threes, but
besides that, no one else was
hot. We never really estab
lished any type of inside game
against UMass and, with the
exception of Vanessa, no one
was hitting outside. And the

longer that happens, the more
tentative people get from the
perimeter."
Nygaard has certainly shoul
dered her share of the load. She
currently leads the team with
21.0 points and 7.3 rebounds per
game. Against UMass, she
buried seven of 15 three-point
ers (her 15 three-point field-goal
attempts tied a school record)
and tallied what was then a
career-high '25 points.
Nygaard bettered that scoring
total Friday night against Old
Dominion with 29 points, second
only to Starbird's 31. Starbird,
who also collected four
rebounds, seven assists, two
steals and two blocks on the
evening, earned Pac-10 Player of
the Week honors for her perfor
mance.
"There's always been high
expectations for Kate," Tucker
said, "but I've been pleasantly
surprised by Vanessa."

Tennessee (6-0) Saturday, Dec.
16 at 7 p.m.
"Tennessee is always a big
game," Tucker said. "Whether
you win or lose, [playing them]
points out what you really need
to improve on."
The 10th Annual Fry's / Car
dinal Classic will take place Dec.
19-20 at Maples Pavilion. Stan
ford will face Cal State-Sacra
mento while Auburn battles
Eastern Washington, with the
winners advancing to the cham
pionship game. Following the
tournament, the women will

families before returning to
school for the road trip to
Texas.
"Obviously it's still early in
the season, but we have a couple
of big tests coming up here
soon," Tucker said. "I feel pretty
comfortable, but we have a week
of practice here and we've got to
put some things together."
