# Theater meets film with a 'Kiss'
## 
### SAMUEL PARK 
Is it a movie? A musical? A movie musical? I )e
-spite its title, "Kiss of the Spider Woman
.The Musical" defies all categorizations. Is it a
gay love story or a political thriller? Or maybe
it's just a homage to the power of film.
The musical is entirely cinematk in its set
and light design. 1 rum the first scene, when
we "zoom out" to reveal a prison cell in a
Latin American country to the musical's var
ious "close-ups," the gap between theater and
film is completely blurred.
This design parallels the musical's theme ot
fantasy versus reality. Molina (Juan ( hioran), a
gay man jailed for allegedly molesting a minor,
constantly seeks the glamour of movies in order
to escape the harsh reality of prison life. He
spends much ofhis time describing movie plots
to his recently arrived cellmate, Valentin (Dori
an I larewood), a suspected terrorist.
At first reluctant, Valentin slowly becomes
fascinated by these movies, all ot which star
the magnificent Aurora (Chita Rivera). Auro
ra is .1 cross between Rita 1 layworth and ( ar
men Miranda, with a touch ot (Ad Charisse.
When Valentin becomes gravely ill, it is the es
capism of the movies that keeps him going.
Oddly enough, the musical version of
Manuel Puig's 1976 novel is more cinematic
than the 1 lector Babenco film version, which
often seemed like a filmed play. Babenco
never moved the camera back beyond the
fourth wall of the cell to give the impression
of confinement, effectively casting the the
ater as the fourth wall.

The musical in
stead plays out like a
screening. Com
puterized projec
tions on the stage
literally throw the
actors into movie
sequences, blend
ing the three-di
mensional sets with
surreal film prints.
The effect is ab
solutely astound
ing, completely
blurring the line be
tween Molina's fan
tasies and reality.
"Kiss"may have
seemed an unlike
ly candidate lor a
musical seven
vears ago, but now

it appears that everything that came before
the book, the movie, the play were
preparations for the ultimate telling of
Puig's story. It is a triumphant musical.
"Kiss" won practically all the major lony
Awards in 1993, including Best Musical, Best
Actress in a Musical (Rivera), Best Book ( Ter
ence McNally), Best Score and Best (lostume
Design. Harold Prince ("Phantom of the
Opera, "Show Boat ) directed. Whatever
anyone s.ivs about this show, it has pedigree.
It just doesn't uet anv better than this.

But the reason people
will flock to see this show
is Rivera. Like Carol
Channing and Julie An
drews, she is a living leg
end of American musical
theater. She has done
everything and done it
well. "West Side Story" in
the original Broadwa\
production. "Sweet
Charity" in the national
tour. "Can Can," "The
Kink," "Pippin," "Bye Bye
Birdie" and so on.
After decades on
the stage, Rivera can still
do some major damage
with her high kicks, and

it takes a single llick ol her wrist to upstage all
the other dancers in the chorus. Her voice,
which couldn't he imitated tor the love of 1 )y
-onisus, is a national treasure. Instead ot I SI)
flashbacks, theatergoers are liable to be struck
by Rivera flashbacks lor the rest of their lives.
The rest of the cast does a good job also,
Chioran's Molina in particular. Molina is the
master of ceremonies here, leading the audi
ence from the serious prison scenes to the
light musical numbers. Chioran, charming in
his harmlessness, wins over tin.' audience and

takes it by the hand through the musical.
In theme as well as in genre, "Kiss" resists
neat categorization. It deals with two men
. who have a romantic relationship, hut call
ing this a gay love story would he a stretch. It
has to do with political imprisonment and
torture, but don't get Costa-Gravas on the
phone just yet. The musical is also about how
the movies provide refuge from reality, and
the price that we pay for believing in them
too much.
"Kiss" is a balancing act between comedy
and tragedy, between colortul production
numbers and grim interrogation scenes, be
tween fantasy and reality. It has a score with
typical Broadway musical elements, but the
melodies are symphonic and operatic at
times, featuring some Latin American tla
vored tunes.
It is difficult to pin down exactly what this
hybrid of a musical is. There is no question
that "Kiss" is a brilliant show, innovative in
its design, featuring captivating perfor
mances from a talented cast and a moving
story line. One category "Kiss" tits perfectly
that of a classic, most perfect musical.
