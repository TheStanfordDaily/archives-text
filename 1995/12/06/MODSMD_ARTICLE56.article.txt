# Grub Focus on: Stars Palo Alto
## Exquisite dining not only for Stars 
### David Smolen 
When you walk into Stars Palo Alto for the
first time, it doesn't take long to realize that
the local restaurant scene has reached a new
level of elegance and sophistication.
No single characteristic of Stars makes this
an obvious conclusion. It's not the bevy of
red jacketed valet parking attendants in front
scrambling to find space for imported luxury
cars. Nor is it the crisp white linen on the ta
bles or the elaborate formal place settings.
Rather, it is the sum total of numerous details,
from the major to the painstakingly small,
that combine to create a dining experience
that firmly places Stars Palo Alto in a class by
itself among local restaurants.
Stars is a bit of the big city right here in
downtown Palo Alto. It bears the name of
celebrity chef Jeremiah Tower's international
ly renowned Stars Restaurant in San Francis
co. The striking architecture, chic interior de
sign and apron-clad servers of the Palo Alto
restaurant remind one of tony Los Angeles
bistros. And the prices on the menu scream
New York City.
But Stars Palo Alto has not sacrificed ib

entire mid-Peninsula soul in its quest for
restaurant stardom. The stately oak tree that
stretches over the arched entrance and spa
cious courtyard is a reassuring, quintessential
Palo Alto touch. And despite the formal ac
cents of the dining room, the atmosphere in
side is bustling, relaxed and surprisingly in
formal. This is perhaps Stars' most impressive
quality. The restaurant is able to live up to the
high culinary reputation of its famous San
Francisco namesake, while at the same time
allowing for a wide variety of dining experi
ences in which everyone feels welcome. The
night we were there, several jeans-clad pa
trons dined comfortably at a table next to
business people in suits, and couples out for a
romantic evening fit right in next to small
family gatherings.
Things have not always been so smooth at
Stars Palo Alto since its opening in June of this
year. From the outset, many patrons com
plained of unpredictable service, and the
menu failed to meet consistently the exacting
standards expected at a restaurant of this cat
egory. The 70-person investor group that
brought Stars to Palo Alto, led by local devel
oper Jim Baer, responded with a series of
moves designed to work out the kinks in the
system. The management group terminated
Jeremiah Tower's consulting contract and
hired another San Francisco celebrity chet,
Square One's Joyce Goldstein. Todd Gunder
son replaced the original general manager
and chef Derek Burns was brought in at Gold
stein's request. Add to that a reconfigured
wait staff and a revised menu, and it looks as
if Stars Palo Alto has turned the corner on its
bumpy start.
Stars Palo Alto's menu is California cuisine
with a bit of French flair. The eleven first
course items and eight main courses are de

fined by the use of high-quality local ingredi
ents, with an emphasis on subtle artistic pre
sentation. We began by ordering onion soup
with grilled bread croutons and gruyere
cheese ($6). This delicious rendition of a clas
sic soup came served in a small shining cop
per pot that kept the contents hot while we
chatted over our first course. Our other selec
tion was a salad made of warm goat cheese
with walnut and bread crumb crust, endive
and fennel, dressed with walnut vinaigrette
($8.50). Thinly sliced apples and creamy goat
cheese made this an excellent alternative to
the more traditional seasonal greens with gar
lic croutons and Stars vinaigrette ($6).
The other first course items range from the
more familiar (deep fried calamari with ro
maine and Meyer lemon anchovy garlic
vinaigrette, $8.50), to the heretofore unseen
in Palo Alto (hot and cold smoked sturgeon
and sturgeon "brandadc," osetra caviar and
pumpernickel bread, served with beets in a
horseradish vinaigrette, $14).
For our entrees, we ordered pan-roasted
chicken breast served with a ragout ot wild
mushrooms, artichokes, cipollini onions,
thyme and garlic mash potatoes ($17.50), and
grilled filet ot salmon with olive, sun dried
tomato and basil sauce, served with roasted
eggplant ravioli and green beans ($l9).
It is in entrees such as these that one no
tices the details that give Stars its cachet. The
tender pan-roasted chicken went extremely
well with the ragout of wild mushrooms,
whose delicate sauce accented the flavor of
both chicken and mushrooms alike. Likewise,
the salmon came atop several exceptional
eggplant ravioli that could hold their own at
any Italian restaurant in town. Other enticing
entrees include roast Maine lobster with gin
ger and lemon grass butter, basmati coconut

rice timbale and sugar snap peas ($25), and
for vegetarians, the cracked wheat pilaf with
feta cheese, mint and spinach served with an
eggplant fan ($l7). In addition, Stars Palo
Alto boasts what is likely the most extensive
wine list in the area.
As you can image, especially if you have
been doing the math, all of this elegance and
detail comes at a steep cost. Enter forewarned
— if you plan on having a complete dinner
bring either a generous relative willing to pay
the tab, or come carrying a credit card.
There are, however, other ways of enjoying
Stars without breaking the bank. You may
order from the more reasonably priced bar
menu at any time of the day, which includes a
Stars hamburger with choice of blue cheese,
caramelized onions, or jack cheese ($8.50).
Or stop by late night for dessert. Their back
to-basics dessert menu includes fresh fruit
sorbets ($6) and chocolate layered mousse
cake ($6). You may also visit the spacious
courtyard bar, order from the extensive spe
cialty cocktail menu, or enjoy one of Stars' 30
single malt scotches while listening to live jazz
on Friday and Saturday nights.
but if you're going to Stars Palo Alto be
cause you are a Jeremiah Tower fan, you bet
ter hurry up. Aside from the restaurant's
name, the only remaining vestige of his tenure
in Palo Alto is the first item on the specialty
cocktails menu — aptly named The Jeremiah.
Rumor has it that may soon change to The
Joyce.

But Stars Palo Alto has not sacrificed ib

entire mid-Peninsula soul in its quest for
restaurant stardom. The stately oak tree that
stretches over the arched entrance and spa
cious courtyard is a reassuring, quintessential
Palo Alto touch. And despite the formal ac
cents of the dining room, the atmosphere in
side is bustling, relaxed and surprisingly in
formal. This is perhaps Stars' most impressive
quality. The restaurant is able to live up to the
high culinary reputation of its famous San
Francisco namesake, while at the same time
allowing for a wide variety of dining experi
ences in which everyone feels welcome. The
night we were there, several jeans-clad pa
trons dined comfortably at a table next to
business people in suits, and couples out for a
romantic evening fit right in next to small
family gatherings.
Things have not always been so smooth at
Stars Palo Alto since its opening in June of this
year. From the outset, many patrons com
plained of unpredictable service, and the
menu failed to meet consistently the exacting
standards expected at a restaurant of this cat
egory. The 70-person investor group that
brought Stars to Palo Alto, led by local devel
oper Jim Baer, responded with a series of
moves designed to work out the kinks in the
system. The management group terminated
Jeremiah Tower's consulting contract and
hired another San Francisco celebrity chet,
Square One's Joyce Goldstein. Todd Gunder
son replaced the original general manager
and chef Derek Burns was brought in at Gold
stein's request. Add to that a reconfigured
wait staff and a revised menu, and it looks as
if Stars Palo Alto has turned the corner on its
bumpy start.
Stars Palo Alto's menu is California cuisine
with a bit of French flair. The eleven first
course items and eight main courses are de

fined by the use of high-quality local ingredi
ents, with an emphasis on subtle artistic pre
sentation. We began by ordering onion soup
with grilled bread croutons and gruyere
cheese ($6). This delicious rendition of a clas
sic soup came served in a small shining cop
per pot that kept the contents hot while we
chatted over our first course. Our other selec
tion was a salad made of warm goat cheese
with walnut and bread crumb crust, endive
and fennel, dressed with walnut vinaigrette
($8.50). Thinly sliced apples and creamy goat
cheese made this an excellent alternative to
the more traditional seasonal greens with gar
lic croutons and Stars vinaigrette ($6).
The other first course items range from the
more familiar (deep fried calamari with ro
maine and Meyer lemon anchovy garlic
vinaigrette, $8.50), to the heretofore unseen
in Palo Alto (hot and cold smoked sturgeon
and sturgeon "brandadc," osetra caviar and
pumpernickel bread, served with beets in a
horseradish vinaigrette, $14).
For our entrees, we ordered pan-roasted
chicken breast served with a ragout ot wild
mushrooms, artichokes, cipollini onions,
thyme and garlic mash potatoes ($17.50), and
grilled filet ot salmon with olive, sun dried
tomato and basil sauce, served with roasted
eggplant ravioli and green beans ($l9).
It is in entrees such as these that one no
tices the details that give Stars its cachet. The
tender pan-roasted chicken went extremely
well with the ragout of wild mushrooms,
whose delicate sauce accented the flavor of
both chicken and mushrooms alike. Likewise,
the salmon came atop several exceptional
eggplant ravioli that could hold their own at
any Italian restaurant in town. Other enticing
entrees include roast Maine lobster with gin
ger and lemon grass butter, basmati coconut

rice timbale and sugar snap peas ($25), and
for vegetarians, the cracked wheat pilaf with
feta cheese, mint and spinach served with an
eggplant fan ($l7). In addition, Stars Palo
Alto boasts what is likely the most extensive
wine list in the area.
As you can image, especially if you have
been doing the math, all of this elegance and
detail comes at a steep cost. Enter forewarned
— if you plan on having a complete dinner
bring either a generous relative willing to pay
the tab, or come carrying a credit card.
There are, however, other ways of enjoying
Stars without breaking the bank. You may
order from the more reasonably priced bar
menu at any time of the day, which includes a
Stars hamburger with choice of blue cheese,
caramelized onions, or jack cheese ($8.50).
Or stop by late night for dessert. Their back
to-basics dessert menu includes fresh fruit
sorbets ($6) and chocolate layered mousse
cake ($6). You may also visit the spacious
courtyard bar, order from the extensive spe
cialty cocktail menu, or enjoy one of Stars' 30
single malt scotches while listening to live jazz
on Friday and Saturday nights.
but if you're going to Stars Palo Alto be
cause you are a Jeremiah Tower fan, you bet
ter hurry up. Aside from the restaurant's
name, the only remaining vestige of his tenure
in Palo Alto is the first item on the specialty
cocktails menu — aptly named The Jeremiah.
Rumor has it that may soon change to The
Joyce.
