# The 						rhythm of life and the blues of death
## 
### Alison Gordon 
"Whctis my time? Seems lucky I'm still alive."
How do you express yourself in a culture
that won't give you a voice? How do you dream
when the community in which you live doesn't
think you have the right? How does a poor
black man in the 1940s believe in himself?
The difficulty of self-expression and the
struggle for self-belief are central themes in
Pulitzer-prize winner August Wilson's newest
work, "Seven Guitars." The American (Conser
vatory Theater production, directed by Lloyd
Richards, will play through Dec. 23 at the
Marines Memorial Theater in San Francisco
and is scheduled to open on Broadway in
March 19%.
Through colorful moments, pain and
humor, Wilson reveals various answers to his
own questions. The voice and history of
African Americans lies in rhythm — the
rhythm of language, of song and of the blues.
Their spirit and dreams resound through their
laughter; their strength to light is tangible in
their tears. Home, like God, is somewhere —
but in the pain of the moment, it may be hard
to find.
II neui form of communication
"The blues help you get out of bed in the morn
ing. You get up knowing you ain't alone, t here's
something else in the world. Something's been
added by that song. This be an empty world
without the blues." ("Ma Rainey's Black Bot
tom," Wilson)
The lights go down, the music goes up and
the auditorium fills with the wailing of the
blues. A lonely voice is heard, singing — the
first words we hear are the words ol a song.
Wilson, by incorporating the blues, verse
and an often dizzying pace ol authentic
African-American speech rhythms into his
play, lays a startling emphasis on the impor
tance of appropriating a unique form ol cul
tural expression to achieve a unique sense ol
self-identity.
Language, he is saying, is the only way we
have to express ourselves and tell others who
we are. As such, therefore, it is closely tied with
personal freedom and control.
Wilson's characters, drawn and acted with
rich individuality, seem acutely aware of the
difficulty of self-expression. It is not by acci
dent, therefore, that the most moving scenes in
the play involve music and song. Rhythm and
blues provide a temporary release from frus
tration and, more importantly, a form of elo
quence that words do not possess.
The seatch for self-exptession
The time is 1948. A group ol friends gather
in the backyard of a Pittsburgh rooming
house. They are mourning one ol their own
Floyd "Schoolboy" Barton — whose sudden
death has cut short a blues guitar career just on
the verge of taking off in Chicago. As the

friends try to overcome their grief with re
silient humor, the narrative jumps back in time
to tell the story ol Floyd's last days.
One of the most poignant later scenes re
volves around Floyd and his music ability. The
four male characters — Floyd (Keith Pavid),
the dynamic leader; Canewell (Ruben Santia
go-! ludson), the cheeky, babv-faced harmon
ica player; Red ( Tommy I lollis), the flirtatious
drummer whose instrument is still in the pawn
shop; and 1 ledlev (Steven Anthony Jones), the
ailing butcher, are wasting time as usual in the
backyard.
Suddenly the three band members burst
into an impromptu blues session. Floyd plays
on his guitar, Canewell wails on his harmonica
and Red improvises the rhythm of the drums

by rubbing his drum sticks up and down the
wooden slats of a chair and tapping on its legs.
Soon Hedley interrupts. He is making
something — a wooden instrument with only
one string — and his loud hammering drowns
out the rhythm of the song. Receiving taunts
from the others, he explains that his lather
taught him as a boy that it he played on a single
string, he would be able to hear the prayer of
his dead grandmother.
"I didn't hear it, but I learnt it and tried to
hear her," says Hedley. The auditorium falls
silent; the only sound is made by Hedley, who
plucks the string in the rhythm of a death bell
tolling.
Floyd breaks from the group, isolated in his
own world of reminiscence. The stage is thick
with a now familiar feeling of loss and over
flowing with nearly tangible memories of
death.
"If I could hear my mother pray again," he
says, "I'd pray with her." I le leans over a bench
and slowly, quietly begins to sing the Lord's
Prayer. The other men watch him, transfixed.
Floyd has found his voice.
The search for home
"Wherever you hang your /nit, that's your
home... what a lie that is."
The fluidity of the stage environment pro

vides the audience with a hint that "home" is a
concept which will be constantly questioned in
the play. Designed with imagination and sub
tlety by Scott Bradley, the set is a realistic pre
sentation of the back of an old tenement build
ing and the dirty, run-down yard it overshad
ows. A rickety stairway runs up one side of the
building and a door, with a small porch and a
couple of steps, is on the other. A large wooden
gate is the sole means of connection with the
world beyond.
The only hint of comfort, and of the interi
or world, comes from a solitary dimlv lighted
window located halfway up the tenement.
I hrough this window we can perceive signs of
domesticity — a picture on the wall, curtains,
cheap ornaments.

The intelligence of the design comes from
the fact that the characters who go indoors are
effectively exiting the main stage. In this way
the internal and external environments be
come confused, suggesting that the characters
exist in a kind of limbo world.
This transient state, where things are unset
tled, is complicated further by the huge gate
way which leads to the unknown outside
world. This world, represented in the play by
the constant talk of moving to Chicago, is an
ominous one. I hrough it comes death and de
struction — violent sounds of shootings, the
danger of howling dogs and the cries of roost
ers who seem to suggest the betrayal of the bib
lical story of John denying Jesus.
Vera (delicately brought to life by Viola
Davis) perhaps best symbolizes the lack ol di
rection and sense of constant transience of the
characters in the play. She explains to Floyd,
her lover, that she will come to Chicago with
him, but is bringing with her a form of securi
tv — a one-way ticket back "home." "I'll put it
in my shoe and walk around on it," she tells
him. There can be no more forceful image of
rootlessness than this.
Wilson's point is voiced by one of his own
characters, the ebullient, jovial and yet insight
fill Louise, acted with veracity by Michcle Shay.
She warns Vera that leavinga place means little

because "Wherever you go, you gotta carry
yourself with you."
Faded dreams
"//'> out there for somebody, might as well he
for me."
The idealism of dreams is constantly threat
ened in the play by a more sinister belief in su
perstition and a fear of failure. Frequent refer
ences to the number seven — Red's broken
mirror means seven years of bad luck; Hedley
wants to pass on his "seven generations"
serve as a reminder that the substance of a
dream may turn into the shroud of a night
mare.
This appears to be the meaning of the
dream narrated by Hedley, the psychotic
butcher who seems deranged from tuberculo
sis and bent on self-destruction out of his ha
tred for his inferior position in the world.
Actor Steven Anthony (ones excellently por
trays tho character's barely restrained passion
and aggression.
In 1 led ley's dream, Buddy Bolden, his la
ther's old hero, comes to him and offers
him the money that he needs to buy a plan
tation. But in the dream, when I ied ley puts
out his hands to collect the money, it turns
to dust.
The last moments of the play bring this
theme full circle. It transpires that I ledley was
the one who killed Floyd, mistaking him for
Buddy Bolden and stabbing him for not hand
ing over the money.
In the last scene a now-broken Hedley sits
rocking himself gently on a stool in the corner
of the yard. His final gesture is to open his
tightly-clamped fists and let the dollar bills he
is secretly holding float out over the stage. The
conclusion we must draw is harsh: ashes to
ashes, dust to dust.
dishing self-belief
Floyd: It seemed like she believed in me more.
Vera: You're supposed to believe in yourself.
Despite the apparent bleakness of the final
action, however, a subtle affirmation resurges
at the very end of the play.
C ]a newel I closes the play with a dolorous re
frain — ironic in the circumstances, but fitting
in the final count: "I heard Buddy Bolden
sing," he chants, singing Medley's own song
back to him. It serves as a subtle reminder that
we cannot escape our own past and that ulti
mately we should not even try. For the past
holds the key to our identity and the vehicle of
our means of self-expression.
Perhaps Floyd'sdeath represents something
positive as well as negative. He was willing to
take a risk to achieve his dream and although
he had to pay a price for breaking the rules, at
least fora little while he experienced theelation
of success and the pleasure of having his
friends believe in him. His death, however, ex
emplifies the point that other people's belief in
you is not enough — you must first believe in
yourself.

friends try to overcome their grief with re
silient humor, the narrative jumps back in time
to tell the story ol Floyd's last days.
One of the most poignant later scenes re
volves around Floyd and his music ability. The
four male characters — Floyd (Keith Pavid),
the dynamic leader; Canewell (Ruben Santia
go-! ludson), the cheeky, babv-faced harmon
ica player; Red ( Tommy I lollis), the flirtatious
drummer whose instrument is still in the pawn
shop; and 1 ledlev (Steven Anthony Jones), the
ailing butcher, are wasting time as usual in the
backyard.
Suddenly the three band members burst
into an impromptu blues session. Floyd plays
on his guitar, Canewell wails on his harmonica
and Red improvises the rhythm of the drums

by rubbing his drum sticks up and down the
wooden slats of a chair and tapping on its legs.
Soon Hedley interrupts. He is making
something — a wooden instrument with only
one string — and his loud hammering drowns
out the rhythm of the song. Receiving taunts
from the others, he explains that his lather
taught him as a boy that it he played on a single
string, he would be able to hear the prayer of
his dead grandmother.
"I didn't hear it, but I learnt it and tried to
hear her," says Hedley. The auditorium falls
silent; the only sound is made by Hedley, who
plucks the string in the rhythm of a death bell
tolling.
Floyd breaks from the group, isolated in his
own world of reminiscence. The stage is thick
with a now familiar feeling of loss and over
flowing with nearly tangible memories of
death.
"If I could hear my mother pray again," he
says, "I'd pray with her." I le leans over a bench
and slowly, quietly begins to sing the Lord's
Prayer. The other men watch him, transfixed.
Floyd has found his voice.
The search for home
"Wherever you hang your /nit, that's your
home... what a lie that is."
The fluidity of the stage environment pro

vides the audience with a hint that "home" is a
concept which will be constantly questioned in
the play. Designed with imagination and sub
tlety by Scott Bradley, the set is a realistic pre
sentation of the back of an old tenement build
ing and the dirty, run-down yard it overshad
ows. A rickety stairway runs up one side of the
building and a door, with a small porch and a
couple of steps, is on the other. A large wooden
gate is the sole means of connection with the
world beyond.
The only hint of comfort, and of the interi
or world, comes from a solitary dimlv lighted
window located halfway up the tenement.
I hrough this window we can perceive signs of
domesticity — a picture on the wall, curtains,
cheap ornaments.

The intelligence of the design comes from
the fact that the characters who go indoors are
effectively exiting the main stage. In this way
the internal and external environments be
come confused, suggesting that the characters
exist in a kind of limbo world.
This transient state, where things are unset
tled, is complicated further by the huge gate
way which leads to the unknown outside
world. This world, represented in the play by
the constant talk of moving to Chicago, is an
ominous one. I hrough it comes death and de
struction — violent sounds of shootings, the
danger of howling dogs and the cries of roost
ers who seem to suggest the betrayal of the bib
lical story of John denying Jesus.
Vera (delicately brought to life by Viola
Davis) perhaps best symbolizes the lack ol di
rection and sense of constant transience of the
characters in the play. She explains to Floyd,
her lover, that she will come to Chicago with
him, but is bringing with her a form of securi
tv — a one-way ticket back "home." "I'll put it
in my shoe and walk around on it," she tells
him. There can be no more forceful image of
rootlessness than this.
Wilson's point is voiced by one of his own
characters, the ebullient, jovial and yet insight
fill Louise, acted with veracity by Michcle Shay.
She warns Vera that leavinga place means little

because "Wherever you go, you gotta carry
yourself with you."
Faded dreams
"//'> out there for somebody, might as well he
for me."
The idealism of dreams is constantly threat
ened in the play by a more sinister belief in su
perstition and a fear of failure. Frequent refer
ences to the number seven — Red's broken
mirror means seven years of bad luck; Hedley
wants to pass on his "seven generations"
serve as a reminder that the substance of a
dream may turn into the shroud of a night
mare.
This appears to be the meaning of the
dream narrated by Hedley, the psychotic
butcher who seems deranged from tuberculo
sis and bent on self-destruction out of his ha
tred for his inferior position in the world.
Actor Steven Anthony (ones excellently por
trays tho character's barely restrained passion

In 1 led ley's dream, Buddy Bolden, his la
ther's old hero, comes to him and offers
him the money that he needs to buy a plan
tation. But in the dream, when I ied ley puts
out his hands to collect the money, it turns
to dust.
The last moments of the play bring this
theme full circle. It transpires that I ledley was
the one who killed Floyd, mistaking him for
Buddy Bolden and stabbing him for not hand
ing over the money.
In the last scene a now-broken Hedley sits
rocking himself gently on a stool in the corner
of the yard. His final gesture is to open his
tightly-clamped fists and let the dollar bills he
is secretly holding float out over the stage. The
conclusion we must draw is harsh: ashes to
ashes, dust to dust.
dishing self-belief
Floyd: It seemed like she believed in me more.
Vera: You're supposed to believe in yourself.
Despite the apparent bleakness of the final
action, however, a subtle affirmation resurges
at the very end of the play.
C ]a newel I closes the play with a dolorous re
frain — ironic in the circumstances, but fitting
in the final count: "I heard Buddy Bolden
sing," he chants, singing Medley's own song
back to him. It serves as a subtle reminder that
we cannot escape our own past and that ulti
mately we should not even try. For the past
holds the key to our identity and the vehicle of
our means of self-expression.
Perhaps Floyd'sdeath represents something
positive as well as negative. He was willing to
take a risk to achieve his dream and although
he had to pay a price for breaking the rules, at
least fora little while he experienced theelation
of success and the pleasure of having his
friends believe in him. His death, however, ex
emplifies the point that other people's belief in
you is not enough — you must first believe in
yourself.

Tommy Hollis, Keith David and Ruben Santiago-Hudson laugh with the blues.
"Whctis my time? Seems lucky I'm still alive."
How do you express yourself in a culture
that won't give you a voice? How do you dream
when the community in which you live doesn't
think you have the right? How does a poor
black man in the 1940s believe in himself?
The difficulty of self-expression and the
struggle for self-belief are central themes in
Pulitzer-prize winner August Wilson's newest
work, "Seven Guitars." The American (Conser
vatory Theater production, directed by Lloyd
Richards, will play through Dec. 23 at the
Marines Memorial Theater in San Francisco
and is scheduled to open on Broadway in
March 19%.
Through colorful moments, pain and
humor, Wilson reveals various answers to his
own questions. The voice and history of
African Americans lies in rhythm — the
rhythm of language, of song and of the blues.
Their spirit and dreams resound through their
laughter; their strength to light is tangible in
their tears. Home, like God, is somewhere —
but in the pain of the moment, it may be hard
to find.
II neui form of communication
"The blues help you get out of bed in the morn
ing. You get up knowing you ain't alone, t here's
something else in the world. Something's been
added by that song. This be an empty world
without the blues." ("Ma Rainey's Black Bot
tom," Wilson)
The lights go down, the music goes up and
the auditorium fills with the wailing of the
blues. A lonely voice is heard, singing — the
first words we hear are the words ol a song.
Wilson, by incorporating the blues, verse
and an often dizzying pace ol authentic
African-American speech rhythms into his
play, lays a startling emphasis on the impor
tance of appropriating a unique form ol cul
tural expression to achieve a unique sense ol
self-identity.
Language, he is saying, is the only way we
have to express ourselves and tell others who
we are. As such, therefore, it is closely tied with
personal freedom and control.
Wilson's characters, drawn and acted with
rich individuality, seem acutely aware of the
difficulty of self-expression. It is not by acci
dent, therefore, that the most moving scenes in
the play involve music and song. Rhythm and
blues provide a temporary release from frus
tration and, more importantly, a form of elo
quence that words do not possess.
The seatch for self-exptession
The time is 1948. A group ol friends gather
in the backyard of a Pittsburgh rooming
house. They are mourning one ol their own
Floyd "Schoolboy" Barton — whose sudden
death has cut short a blues guitar career just on
the verge of taking off in Chicago. As the

friends try to overcome their grief with re
