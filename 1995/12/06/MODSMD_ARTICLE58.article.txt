PAVEMENT ANI) GUIDEI) BY VOICES
Pavement and (>uided by Voices made
two of the finest albums of 1995, and no
one should be surprised. After all,
they've been dominating critics' "Best
of " lists for years now. What is surpris
ing, though, is the way they changed
things; up. Botfl band> followed their
smoothest and most heavily buz Ad
works to date {Pavement's 'Crooked
Rain. Crookst Rain 0 and GBVV "Hoe
Thousand," both 1994} with much less
focused worki- of jumblrd en*>t ion and
musical indulgence. Pavement's" Wowee 112
Zowec" is a huge and hard-to-sf|allow
work of genius, while C-B\ 's fAlien
Lines" bombards the listener with 28
perfectly jagged pop snippets. Sortgwrit
vr* Steve Malkmus and Robert Pollard
lemain two of the best around, crafting
deliciously ambiguous works that are
just specific enough to apply to whatever
you might have in mind. GBY fans won't
want to mils another great Pollard cre
ation, "Sensational Gravity Boy," by
Freedom Cruise (a.k.a. GBV with Kim
and Kellev Deal) on the "Red Hot 4
Bothered compilation.

RAP FAVORITES
I very year, the rap world fascinates me.
1993 was no exception, .is different sectors
ol hip hop battled lor my attention, with
each label dying to catch a glimpse ol me at
their record release parties.
Perhaps the most underrated rap album
ol the year was I he Nonce's "World L'lti
mate," an uncanny blend of cutting-edge
lyrics and soothing samples check it out!
Ol course, the Wu-Tang ( lan sure came on
strong, with members Ol' I)irty Bastard,
Method Man, Raekwon, and (ienius / (i/.A
making headlines.
Some ol my readers recently rolled me out
at 7:30 a.m. and asked what the greatest lyric
ol the year was. It has to be on the single "Next
level" from I he Alkaholiks'"('.oast II (.oast":
"Everybody knows that you can't bust
this / You got a bad name like I )ick Butkus."
(!an't wait to see what '96 has in store lor us!

1995, BROUGHI I O YOU BY Till II II IK 11
I lelium and Polh lean I larvev not onl\ have an 11 in common,
but are also responsible for some ol the most memorable music ol
the past year.
Helium exceeded the high expectations whetted by the 1 944
debut FP, "Pirate Prude, with an even more gripping tome to em
powerment, "The I >irt of I tick. Spiking her frustration with
clever wit, Mary I imony climbs above what's putting her down,
teases in point: Superball and "Pat s Trick would be pop hits
from I lei I, if they weren't as enriching as they are sinister.
W hen all the votes are tallied, it's likely that PJ. Harvey's "To
Bring You Mv l.ove" will be the most lavishly lauded album of
1 99 ■>. from the throbbing "Working for the Man through the ju
hilant chaos of "I ong Snake Moan" and the longing, iiggish "Send

SF ART
Once sniveling in embarrassment from its quasi-cosmopolitan
reputation, San Francisco is now basking in the fluorescent glow
of two spankin' new art arenas. TheSFMOMA emerged from bu
reaucratic cold storage when its relocated self opened in January. It's be
come the icon of art culture in its new encasing: Swiss architect Mario
Botto's bricked, modern revamp of the cathedral... with an edge, dig?!
To placate those who prefer the classicist attitude of their
starched Ralph Lauren collars, the I egion of Honor reopened in
early November, revealing a refurbished Beaux-Arts building
ready to display Rembrandts n Reubens and endure the next big
quake. Situated atop a summit, the Legion provides an incredible
view of the Bay, the Golden Gate and the cityscape.
With the arrival of the two new museums, San Francisco, a city with a
legacy of great writers, artists and musicians, can finally move beyond its
anemic art collections and into cosmopolitan status.

INDEPENDENT FILMMAKERS
1995 has been a year of young buck independent filmmakers successfully market
ing their products to big-time producers and then losing their independent flair. Films
like "Reservoir Dogs" and "El Mariachi" were mere warm-up acts for Quentin Taran
tmo's and Kit hard Kodriquez's entrances into the vapid free
lance culture of Big Movies with Big Talent and No

Thought In Hollywood
"Pulp Fiction" led to "Four Rooms" while Ro-
driguez snagged Antonio Banderas to launch yet

another shoot-'em-up film. Perhaps both direr
tors should make a movie together about well
dressed gangsters killing each other over lovt
and money, but I guess that's been done a!

ready
Far, far away from I os Angeles, in the land
of murky streets and big buildings — New
York City, mecca of sin — two independent
directors have emerged as true voices on
the silver screen, unfazed by L. A.'s olam

jrous banality they are Edward Burns
("The Brothers Mr Mullen") and
Michael Almeyreda ("Nadja") W;itc I>
for them
—Zachary Thacher

MISCELLANEOUS ROCK
Pearl Jam and Neil Young did a
project together, supposedly to
unite the old with the new in some
exciting way, bur as it turns out,
"Mirror Ball" was just kind of
sludgy and forgettable.
The Smashing Pumpkins fol
lowed up "Siamese Dream" with
something huge and dramatic,
though probably pretty good if
one could sit through it all. Ex-
Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl de
buted his Foo Fighters, who are
similarly decent, if unremarkable.
Elastica's singles are pretty cool.
Punk kept getting big, and so
young bands now cite Busker Dii
3nd the Germs as main influences,

even though they were listening tc
Journey back then like everybody
else. Green Day continued to dc
their thing, and Lollapalooza put
together a thoroughly good line
up, even though nobody stayed to
watch the headliners Sonic Youth.
Speaking of Sonic Youth, they
released another great album,
and would probably be getting
more air play if their catchiest
song wasn't 20 minutes long.
Built to Spill and the Jesus Li/arci
signed to major labels, and will
soon get the promotional push
necessary to claim the radio play
that's currently being wasted or
bands like Civ."
—Mite Nonr

LIVE ACTION FUN
I he Flaming Lips' latest album, "Clouds Taste Metallic," may
have been a bit o! a disappointment, but their show with the
Archers ot Loaf at The Fdge this spring stands as one of the Finest
concert experiences ot the year. The stage covered with blinking
Christmas lights, the group stormed through most of their previ
ous two albums, reveling in more volume and energy than the
dumpv little club could hold. (iuitarist Ronald Jones sent screech
ing, zooming and whistling effects living about the room, while
lanky frontguy Wayne (ioync tried his best to yelp through it all.
I he group mixed charged renditions of their bubbliest radio stuff
("She I )on t Use Jelly," 'bad Days ') with just plain great stuff
("When Yer 22, Moth in the Incubator ) to make 90 minutes of
live rock at its finest. I he I ips are one of just a handful of bands
who could share «i bill with the Archers of I.oaf and not be hope
lessly outdone.
Other concert highlights include Yo 1.1 lengo's Hay Area shows,
the Super*.hunk / Spinanes show at the Fillmore, P.I. Harvey at the
War field and the actually quite good I ollapaloo/a. The most disap
pointing show was probably I 1/ Phair at the Warfield, though Se
hadoh s Fillmore date wasn t .is spectacular as it should have been ei
ther. Also, Farthwisc Productions has been bringing great bands —
like the SI Seals, the I ieraldine Fibbers, Archers of I oaf, the Think
ing Fellers I nion I ocal 252 and more within easy bikingdistance
ot Stanford, with friendly, cheap shows in the Palo Alto area.

WHITNEY BIENNIAL
It endeavored to be a represen
tative survey of American art, but
alas, it became a punching bag for
haughty critics.
That could probably describe
any Whitney biennial, but here
we mean the 1995 incarnation ol
New York's Whitney Museum ol
American Art s much-lambasted
exhibition.
While the pundits blasted the
1993 show tor being too political,
this year s show was deemed too
polite: Curator Klaus Kertess was
accused of stepping too lightly,
dodging the confrontational in
favor of the inoffensive.
That attack was perhaps un
fair to the 89 artists represented,
some of whom produced impres
sive works. There were the hig:
Nari Ward's tarred hearse
swathed in automobile mufflers
and Nancy Rubins' "Mattresses
and Cakes" — precisely what the
title implies, suspended from the
ceiling. There were the big guns:
Cindy Sherman, Richard Serra,
and Cv Twombly contributed
works. And there were big hopes
for up-and-comers like con
ceptualist Rirkrit Tiravanija.
but the critics were not entire
ly off the mark. The show was,
well, bland. little in the show had
the kind of visceral impact one
expects from art; even graphic
works, like (Catherine Opie's pho
tographs of a sexual demi
mondaine, seemed only superfi
cially shocking.
Too hot. Too cold. Sigh.
Maybe 1997 will be juuuust right.

HOLLYWOOD — BAD SCRIPTS, WORSE ACTRESSES
Hollywood's premises have been embarrassing. I rom "Dangerous Minds'' to "Powder" to "Vampire in
Brooklyn, ' everything's been a formula movie. And nobody's even improved the formulas. I lollvwood sutlers
trom a severe lack ot interesting ideas which is most clearly illustrated by their premises. 1 atelv, when some
one does have a good premise, thev fail to develop it. Onlv "(llueless ami

Strange 1 )ays," in fact, had exciting premises."( lueless" actually deliv
ered and fulfilled its premise s potential, but "Strange Days" drowned
in a let's be-deep-and make an irresponsible-comment on the-I.A
Riots abyss, ii was the queen of movies that could have been. With An
gela Bassett, Ralph l iennes and even Juliette 1 ewis, plus some more

acting classes, they could have made a better-than-decent movie.
But the script took the film company down the wrong road and
ran it oft a cliff.
Admittedly, "The Scarlet Letter" hail a good premise — but
I lollvwood certainh didn't write it. Nordid Demi Moore capture
Hester Prvnne's essence. In a rosier world, one would blame
I )emi s work on a bad script, but the deluded, egotistical actress
has got to take some responsibility for her choices.

Speaking ot bad, bad actresses abound. Cood roles in aver- '
age movies go to 1 >emi Moore, who clearly don't know what to
do with new and exciting scripts which don't ask for nudity or
giving head ("Disclosure 1. Maybe we should fire everybody and
iitst have Angela Bassett, Emma Thompson, Susan Sarandon,
kathx Bates and me make all the decisions in I lollvwood.

PLAY OF THE YEAR
"If there is an equation for a
curve like a bell there must be an
equation for one like a bluebell, and
if a bluebell> why not a nne't"
Tom Stoppard's newest play
"Arcadia" is poetic, intelligent and
funny. Only a talented writer can
weave together topics as esoteric as
Lord Byron, the second law of
thermodynamics and garden
landscaping to produce absorbing
theater. Stoppard, through clever
manipulation of language, suc
ceeds in producing a work that
sparkles with wit, rendering poet
ic ami sometimes magical the sci
entific basis that explains existence.

—
The West Coast premiere by the American Conservatory Theater added another quality— vi
sual beauty. From the timeless elegance of the round stage and grandiose doorways, to many won
derfully staged tableaux, the production created memorable images and poignancy, without limit
ing the actors' abilities to bring alive the humor of the text
The final scene provides a key to the plav. Our last vision is of motion — two couples waltz,
swirling in circles, around the stage. The music builds and language is lost Stoppard reveals that the
answer to existence is more likely to be found in the imagination than in scientific formulae.
—Alison Gordon

c;o TO THE hack of the class
For better or worse, every year in
commercial alternative radio can be de
fined by one song — tor instance,
"Smells Like Teen Spirit" for 1992 and
any one of those (ireen I )ay tunes for last
year. For much worse, this year stands
out for its bunch ol hits and bands that
never go in one ear to begin with. 1 )iver
sity has been a bad thing, since it isn't
smart hands like Pavement or the Mulls
or Yo 1 a I'engo that are getting air plav,
but hands like Hush, Better than Ezra ard
Tripping Daisy.
Any of the new stars of 1995 are inter
changeable with those hands that we for
got we forgot as it there's a difference
between Silverchair and Candlebox and
Ugl\ Kid |oe. Hut that's not even as bad as
Live selling a trillion albums and duping
anybody into thinking that their "an
thems were as deep as lyrics like "her pla
centa falls to the floor.' Then again, these
guys don't know enough to make the
drummer sit down instead ol jumping
around like an idiot in the"I Alone" video.
—Artnilii l\ui

SEVEN
The surprising success of "Seven"
isn't that surprising to anyone who's
seen it. This dark and disturbing tale
pits two homicide detectives (Brad
Pitt and Morgan Freeman) against a
cunning religious fanatic who hopes
to make a statement about the moral
decay of society by committing seven
murders based on the seven deadly
sins over seven days. Pitt and Freeman
are pulled into the twisted world of
the killer as they pursue the string of
slayings to its riveting conclusion.
Like the two officers, the viewer is
forced to question which evil is worse
— the killer or the world which he de
spises. Ihe finale offers no answers
and leaves him questioning human
nature. Screenwriter Andrew Kevin
Walker's debut is extremely powerful.
This gritty film grates the nerves,
turns the stomach and churns the
soul, but that's exactly what makes it
one of the year's best.
—Seth Goldstein

BEST FILMS
The biggest difference in independent lilm this year?
No "Pulp Fiction."
This is not to say that the quality of independent film has
fallen; in fact, if anything, this years crop may be one of the
best in recent memory. However, the films faced the same
problem independents face every year — not enough people
came to see them. And the audience is not entirely to blame.
The MPAA ratings board and the cowardice of Disney kept
"Kids" — a definite NC-17 — from being widely released, in
stead leaving the trailblazing path to "Showgirls' ( nuff said).
Nevertheless, this year still turned out some good ones.
Woody Allen's offering, "Mighty Aphrodite,' was typically
solid, the industry parody "Living in Oblivion had its mo
ments, Hugh Grant delivered another quirky performance in
"The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But (.ame Down A
Mountain." These, however, are my five top picks from the in
dependent films of 1995:
The Brothers McMullen: My favorite of the year. Produced
with less than your average student's milk money, writer-di
rector-actor Edward Burns made a huge name for himself,
first at Sundance and then at the box office. Ihe film inter

twining the stories of three Irish-Catholic brothers tripping
through life and love — incorporates smart and witty dia
logue with solid acting from a host of unknowns (Burns
friends, to save money) and a touching plot.
Kids: Potentially the most influential film of the year, limited
release held hack its progress at the box office. Photographer
Larry Clark's hand-held earnestness and cutting dialogue
made this film all the more real. Much of the negative hype
surrounding the film concerns whether kids today are really
as bad as in the movie. Critics who take this route are missing
the point: "Kids" is a look at what some kids are like, not all.
Clark's experience with the skate culture in Central Park
prompted him to make the movie. Despite this, the film is no
less disturbing. It showed here on campus last week; if you
missed it, you'd better hope this one comes out on video.
II Postino: Perhaps the most beautifully made film of the year,
"The Postman" gave a touching account of the evolution of
the relationship between a meek country man and renowned
poet Pablo Ncruda. The plot is surprising at times, saddening
at others, pleasing always. The scenery lends a feeling of ele
gance to the entire story, as does the musical score, lust a well
made film.

The Usual Suspects: Cod, this movie was fun to watch. The
mind games 28-vear-old director Bryan Singer's plot plays on
the audience are enhanced by a terrific ensemble cast, espe
cially Kevin Spacey as the gimp-legged Verbal. The plot moves
so quickly and is so engaging that it is over before you know it,
and no one knows what the hell happened. Gabriel Byrne also
shines in this gangster flick. "Who is Kaiser Soze?" I still don't
know for sure.
Smoke: Wayne Wang and Paul Auster's joint project (the pre
cursor to "Blue In Hie Face") has Harvey Keitel in an unfa
miliar role — no longer the calm and collected psychotic
gangster, he plays a sensitive and down-to-earth cigar shop
owner whose hobby has been to take a picture of his Brooklyn
shop at the same time every day for the last 18 years. William
1 lurt delivers an underappreciated performance as a widowed
writer struggling to survive. Strange events intertwine these
two, a hoy, a gasoline attendant (Forest Whitaker) and a
daughter in this film about the complexity of interhuman re
lationships. This film also has my favorite ending of the year
— Keitel tells an engaging anecdote that leaves us wanting
more but still completely satisfied at the same time.

weave together topics as esoteric as
Lord Byron, the second law of
thermodynamics and garden
landscaping to produce absorbing
theater. Stoppard, through clever
manipulation of language, suc
ceeds in producing a work that
sparkles with wit, rendering poet
ic ami sometimes magical the sci
entific basis that explains existence.

—
The West Coast premiere by the American Conservatory Theater added another quality— vi
sual beauty. From the timeless elegance of the round stage and grandiose doorways, to many won
derfully staged tableaux, the production created memorable images and poignancy, without limit
ing the actors' abilities to bring alive the humor of the text
The final scene provides a key to the plav. Our last vision is of motion — two couples waltz,
swirling in circles, around the stage. The music builds and language is lost Stoppard reveals that the
answer to existence is more likely to be found in the imagination than in scientific formulae.
—Alison Gordon

c;o TO THE hack of the class
For better or worse, every year in
commercial alternative radio can be de
fined by one song — tor instance,
"Smells Like Teen Spirit" for 1992 and
any one of those (ireen I )ay tunes for last
year. For much worse, this year stands
out for its bunch ol hits and bands that
never go in one ear to begin with. 1 )iver
sity has been a bad thing, since it isn't
smart hands like Pavement or the Mulls
or Yo 1 a I'engo that are getting air plav,
but hands like Hush, Better than Ezra ard
Tripping Daisy.
Any of the new stars of 1995 are inter
changeable with those hands that we for
got we forgot as it there's a difference
between Silverchair and Candlebox and
Ugl\ Kid |oe. Hut that's not even as bad as
Live selling a trillion albums and duping
anybody into thinking that their "an
thems were as deep as lyrics like "her pla
centa falls to the floor.' Then again, these
guys don't know enough to make the
drummer sit down instead ol jumping
around like an idiot in the"I Alone" video.
—Artnilii l\ui

SEVEN
The surprising success of "Seven"
isn't that surprising to anyone who's
seen it. This dark and disturbing tale
pits two homicide detectives (Brad
Pitt and Morgan Freeman) against a
cunning religious fanatic who hopes
to make a statement about the moral
decay of society by committing seven
murders based on the seven deadly
sins over seven days. Pitt and Freeman
are pulled into the twisted world of
the killer as they pursue the string of
slayings to its riveting conclusion.
Like the two officers, the viewer is
forced to question which evil is worse
— the killer or the world which he de
spises. Ihe finale offers no answers
and leaves him questioning human
nature. Screenwriter Andrew Kevin
Walker's debut is extremely powerful.
This gritty film grates the nerves,
turns the stomach and churns the
soul, but that's exactly what makes it
one of the year's best.
—Seth Goldstein

BEST FILMS
The biggest difference in independent lilm this year?
No "Pulp Fiction."
This is not to say that the quality of independent film has
fallen; in fact, if anything, this years crop may be one of the
best in recent memory. However, the films faced the same
problem independents face every year — not enough people
came to see them. And the audience is not entirely to blame.
The MPAA ratings board and the cowardice of Disney kept
"Kids" — a definite NC-17 — from being widely released, in
stead leaving the trailblazing path to "Showgirls' ( nuff said).
Nevertheless, this year still turned out some good ones.
Woody Allen's offering, "Mighty Aphrodite,' was typically
solid, the industry parody "Living in Oblivion had its mo
ments, Hugh Grant delivered another quirky performance in
"The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But (.ame Down A
Mountain." These, however, are my five top picks from the in
dependent films of 1995:
The Brothers McMullen: My favorite of the year. Produced
with less than your average student's milk money, writer-di
rector-actor Edward Burns made a huge name for himself,
first at Sundance and then at the box office. Ihe film inter

twining the stories of three Irish-Catholic brothers tripping
through life and love — incorporates smart and witty dia
logue with solid acting from a host of unknowns (Burns
friends, to save money) and a touching plot.
Kids: Potentially the most influential film of the year, limited
release held hack its progress at the box office. Photographer
Larry Clark's hand-held earnestness and cutting dialogue
made this film all the more real. Much of the negative hype
surrounding the film concerns whether kids today are really
as bad as in the movie. Critics who take this route are missing
the point: "Kids" is a look at what some kids are like, not all.
Clark's experience with the skate culture in Central Park
prompted him to make the movie. Despite this, the film is no
less disturbing. It showed here on campus last week; if you
missed it, you'd better hope this one comes out on video.
II Postino: Perhaps the most beautifully made film of the year,
"The Postman" gave a touching account of the evolution of
the relationship between a meek country man and renowned
poet Pablo Ncruda. The plot is surprising at times, saddening
at others, pleasing always. The scenery lends a feeling of ele
gance to the entire story, as does the musical score, lust a well
made film.

The Usual Suspects: Cod, this movie was fun to watch. The
mind games 28-vear-old director Bryan Singer's plot plays on
the audience are enhanced by a terrific ensemble cast, espe
cially Kevin Spacey as the gimp-legged Verbal. The plot moves
so quickly and is so engaging that it is over before you know it,
and no one knows what the hell happened. Gabriel Byrne also
shines in this gangster flick. "Who is Kaiser Soze?" I still don't
know for sure.
Smoke: Wayne Wang and Paul Auster's joint project (the pre
cursor to "Blue In Hie Face") has Harvey Keitel in an unfa
miliar role — no longer the calm and collected psychotic
gangster, he plays a sensitive and down-to-earth cigar shop
owner whose hobby has been to take a picture of his Brooklyn
shop at the same time every day for the last 18 years. William
1 lurt delivers an underappreciated performance as a widowed
writer struggling to survive. Strange events intertwine these
two, a hoy, a gasoline attendant (Forest Whitaker) and a
daughter in this film about the complexity of interhuman re
lationships. This film also has my favorite ending of the year
— Keitel tells an engaging anecdote that leaves us wanting
more but still completely satisfied at the same time.

RAP FAVORITES
I very year, the rap world fascinates me.

Perhaps the most underrated rap album
ol the year was I he Nonce's "World L'lti

lyrics and soothing samples check it out!
Ol course, the Wu-Tang ( lan sure came on

SF ART
Once sniveling in embarrassment from its quasi-cosmopolitan
reputation, San Francisco is now basking in the fluorescent glow
of two spankin' new art arenas. TheSFMOMA emerged from bu
reaucratic cold storage when its relocated self opened in January. It's be
come the icon of art culture in its new encasing: Swiss architect Mario
Botto's bricked, modern revamp of the cathedral... with an edge, dig?!
To placate those who prefer the classicist attitude of their
starched Ralph Lauren collars, the I egion of Honor reopened in
early November, revealing a refurbished Beaux-Arts building
ready to display Rembrandts n Reubens and endure the next big
quake. Situated atop a summit, the Legion provides an incredible
view of the Bay, the Golden Gate and the cityscape.
With the arrival of the two new museums, San Francisco, a city with a
legacy of great writers, artists and musicians, can finally move beyond its
anemic art collections and into cosmopolitan status.

INDEPENDENT FILMMAKERS
1995 has been a year of young buck independent filmmakers successfully market
ing their products to big-time producers and then losing their independent flair. Films
like "Reservoir Dogs" and "El Mariachi" were mere warm-up acts for Quentin Taran
tmo's and Kit hard Kodriquez's entrances into the vapid free
lance culture of Big Movies with Big Talent and No

Thought In Hollywood
"Pulp Fiction" led to "Four Rooms" while Ro-
driguez snagged Antonio Banderas to launch yet

another shoot-'em-up film. Perhaps both direr
tors should make a movie together about well
dressed gangsters killing each other over lovt
and money, but I guess that's been done a!

ready
Far, far away from I os Angeles, in the land
of murky streets and big buildings — New
York City, mecca of sin — two independent
directors have emerged as true voices on
the silver screen, unfazed by L. A.'s olam

jrous banality they are Edward Burns
("The Brothers Mr Mullen") and
Michael Almeyreda ("Nadja") W;itc I>
for them
—Zachary Thacher

MISCELLANEOUS ROCK
Pearl Jam and Neil Young did a
project together, supposedly to
unite the old with the new in some
exciting way, bur as it turns out,
"Mirror Ball" was just kind of
sludgy and forgettable.
The Smashing Pumpkins fol
lowed up "Siamese Dream" with
something huge and dramatic,
though probably pretty good if
one could sit through it all. Ex-
Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl de
buted his Foo Fighters, who are
similarly decent, if unremarkable.
Elastica's singles are pretty cool.
Punk kept getting big, and so
young bands now cite Busker Dii
3nd the Germs as main influences,

even though they were listening tc
Journey back then like everybody
else. Green Day continued to dc
their thing, and Lollapalooza put
together a thoroughly good line
up, even though nobody stayed to
watch the headliners Sonic Youth.
Speaking of Sonic Youth, they
released another great album,
and would probably be getting
more air play if their catchiest
song wasn't 20 minutes long.
Built to Spill and the Jesus Li/arci
signed to major labels, and will
soon get the promotional push
necessary to claim the radio play
that's currently being wasted or
bands like Civ."

LIVE ACTION FUN
I he Flaming Lips' latest album, "Clouds Taste Metallic," may
have been a bit o! a disappointment, but their show with the
Archers ot Loaf at The Fdge this spring stands as one of the Finest
concert experiences ot the year. The stage covered with blinking
Christmas lights, the group stormed through most of their previ
ous two albums, reveling in more volume and energy than the
dumpv little club could hold. (iuitarist Ronald Jones sent screech
ing, zooming and whistling effects living about the room, while
lanky frontguy Wayne (ioync tried his best to yelp through it all.
I he group mixed charged renditions of their bubbliest radio stuff
("She I )on t Use Jelly," 'bad Days ') with just plain great stuff
("When Yer 22, Moth in the Incubator ) to make 90 minutes of
live rock at its finest. I he I ips are one of just a handful of bands
who could share «i bill with the Archers of I.oaf and not be hope
lessly outdone.
Other concert highlights include Yo 1.1 lengo's Hay Area shows,
the Super*.hunk / Spinanes show at the Fillmore, P.I. Harvey at the
War field and the actually quite good I ollapaloo/a. The most disap
pointing show was probably I 1/ Phair at the Warfield, though Se
hadoh s Fillmore date wasn t .is spectacular as it should have been ei
ther. Also, Farthwisc Productions has been bringing great bands —
like the SI Seals, the I ieraldine Fibbers, Archers of I oaf, the Think
ing Fellers I nion I ocal 252 and more within easy bikingdistance
ot Stanford, with friendly, cheap shows in the Palo Alto area.

WHITNEY BIENNIAL
It endeavored to be a represen
tative survey of American art, but
alas, it became a punching bag for
haughty critics.
That could probably describe
any Whitney biennial, but here
we mean the 1995 incarnation ol
New York's Whitney Museum ol
American Art s much-lambasted
exhibition.
While the pundits blasted the
1993 show tor being too political,
this year s show was deemed too
polite: Curator Klaus Kertess was
accused of stepping too lightly,
dodging the confrontational in
favor of the inoffensive.
That attack was perhaps un
fair to the 89 artists represented,
some of whom produced impres
sive works. There were the hig:
Nari Ward's tarred hearse
swathed in automobile mufflers
and Nancy Rubins' "Mattresses
and Cakes" — precisely what the
title implies, suspended from the
ceiling. There were the big guns:
Cindy Sherman, Richard Serra,
and Cv Twombly contributed
works. And there were big hopes
for up-and-comers like con
ceptualist Rirkrit Tiravanija.
but the critics were not entire
ly off the mark. The show was,
well, bland. little in the show had
the kind of visceral impact one
expects from art; even graphic
works, like (Catherine Opie's pho
tographs of a sexual demi
mondaine, seemed only superfi
cially shocking.
Too hot. Too cold. Sigh.
Maybe 1997 will be juuuust right.

HOLLYWOOD — BAD SCRIPTS, WORSE ACTRESSES
Hollywood's premises have been embarrassing. I rom "Dangerous Minds'' to "Powder" to "Vampire in

gela Bassett, Ralph l iennes and even Juliette 1 ewis, plus some more

acting classes, they could have made a better-than-decent movie.
But the script took the film company down the wrong road and
ran it oft a cliff.
Admittedly, "The Scarlet Letter" hail a good premise — but
I lollvwood certainh didn't write it. Nordid Demi Moore capture
Hester Prvnne's essence. In a rosier world, one would blame
I )emi s work on a bad script, but the deluded, egotistical actress
has got to take some responsibility for her choices.

Speaking ot bad, bad actresses abound. Cood roles in aver- '
age movies go to 1 >emi Moore, who clearly don't know what to
do with new and exciting scripts which don't ask for nudity or
giving head ("Disclosure 1. Maybe we should fire everybody and

PLAY OF THE YEAR
"If there is an equation for a

fallen; in fact, if anything, this years crop may be one of the

MISCELLANEOUS ROCK
Pearl Jam and Neil Young did a
project together, supposedly to
unite the old with the new in some
exciting way, bur as it turns out,
"Mirror Ball" was just kind of
sludgy and forgettable.
The Smashing Pumpkins fol
lowed up "Siamese Dream" with
something huge and dramatic,
though probably pretty good if
one could sit through it all. Ex-
Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl de
buted his Foo Fighters, who are
similarly decent, if unremarkable.
Elastica's singles are pretty cool.
Punk kept getting big, and so
young bands now cite Busker Dii
3nd the Germs as main influences,

even though they were listening tc
Journey back then like everybody
else. Green Day continued to dc
their thing, and Lollapalooza put
together a thoroughly good line
up, even though nobody stayed to
watch the headliners Sonic Youth.
Speaking of Sonic Youth, they
released another great album,
and would probably be getting
more air play if their catchiest
song wasn't 20 minutes long.
Built to Spill and the Jesus Li/arci
signed to major labels, and will
soon get the promotional push
necessary to claim the radio play
that's currently being wasted or
bands like Civ."

LIVE ACTION FUN
I he Flaming Lips' latest album, "Clouds Taste Metallic," may
have been a bit o! a disappointment, but their show with the
Archers ot Loaf at The Fdge this spring stands as one of the Finest
concert experiences ot the year. The stage covered with blinking
Christmas lights, the group stormed through most of their previ
ous two albums, reveling in more volume and energy than the
dumpv little club could hold. (iuitarist Ronald Jones sent screech
ing, zooming and whistling effects living about the room, while
lanky frontguy Wayne (ioync tried his best to yelp through it all.
I he group mixed charged renditions of their bubbliest radio stuff
("She I )on t Use Jelly," 'bad Days ') with just plain great stuff
("When Yer 22, Moth in the Incubator ) to make 90 minutes of
live rock at its finest. I he I ips are one of just a handful of bands
who could share «i bill with the Archers of I.oaf and not be hope
lessly outdone.
Other concert highlights include Yo 1.1 lengo's Hay Area shows,
the Super*.hunk / Spinanes show at the Fillmore, P.I. Harvey at the
War field and the actually quite good I ollapaloo/a. The most disap
pointing show was probably I 1/ Phair at the Warfield, though Se
hadoh s Fillmore date wasn t .is spectacular as it should have been ei
ther. Also, Farthwisc Productions has been bringing great bands —
like the SI Seals, the I ieraldine Fibbers, Archers of I oaf, the Think
ing Fellers I nion I ocal 252 and more within easy bikingdistance
ot Stanford, with friendly, cheap shows in the Palo Alto area.

WHITNEY BIENNIAL
It endeavored to be a represen
tative survey of American art, but
alas, it became a punching bag for
haughty critics.
That could probably describe
any Whitney biennial, but here
we mean the 1995 incarnation ol
New York's Whitney Museum ol
American Art s much-lambasted
exhibition.
While the pundits blasted the
1993 show tor being too political,
this year s show was deemed too
polite: Curator Klaus Kertess was
accused of stepping too lightly,
dodging the confrontational in
favor of the inoffensive.
That attack was perhaps un
fair to the 89 artists represented,
some of whom produced impres
sive works. There were the hig:
Nari Ward's tarred hearse
swathed in automobile mufflers
and Nancy Rubins' "Mattresses
and Cakes" — precisely what the
title implies, suspended from the
ceiling. There were the big guns:
Cindy Sherman, Richard Serra,
and Cv Twombly contributed
works. And there were big hopes
for up-and-comers like con
ceptualist Rirkrit Tiravanija.
but the critics were not entire
ly off the mark. The show was,
well, bland. little in the show had
the kind of visceral impact one
expects from art; even graphic
works, like (Catherine Opie's pho
tographs of a sexual demi
mondaine, seemed only superfi
cially shocking.
Too hot. Too cold. Sigh.
Maybe 1997 will be juuuust right.

HOLLYWOOD — BAD SCRIPTS, WORSE ACTRESSES
Hollywood's premises have been embarrassing. I rom "Dangerous Minds'' to "Powder" to "Vampire in
Brooklyn, ' everything's been a formula movie. And nobody's even improved the formulas. I lollvwood sutlers
trom a severe lack ot interesting ideas which is most clearly illustrated by their premises. 1 atelv, when some
one does have a good premise, thev fail to develop it. Onlv "(llueless ami

Strange 1 )ays," in fact, had exciting premises."( lueless" actually deliv
ered and fulfilled its premise s potential, but "Strange Days" drowned
in a let's be-deep-and make an irresponsible-comment on the-I.A
Riots abyss, ii was the queen of movies that could have been. With An
gela Bassett, Ralph l iennes and even Juliette 1 ewis, plus some more

acting classes, they could have made a better-than-decent movie.
But the script took the film company down the wrong road and
ran it oft a cliff.
Admittedly, "The Scarlet Letter" hail a good premise — but
I lollvwood certainh didn't write it. Nordid Demi Moore capture
Hester Prvnne's essence. In a rosier world, one would blame
I )emi s work on a bad script, but the deluded, egotistical actress
has got to take some responsibility for her choices.

Speaking ot bad, bad actresses abound. Cood roles in aver- '
age movies go to 1 >emi Moore, who clearly don't know what to
do with new and exciting scripts which don't ask for nudity or
giving head ("Disclosure 1. Maybe we should fire everybody and

PLAY OF THE YEAR
"If there is an equation for a
curve like a bell there must be an
equation for one like a bluebell, and
if a bluebell> why not a nne't"
Tom Stoppard's newest play
"Arcadia" is poetic, intelligent and
funny. Only a talented writer can
weave together topics as esoteric as
Lord Byron, the second law of
thermodynamics and garden
landscaping to produce absorbing
theater. Stoppard, through clever
manipulation of language, suc
ceeds in producing a work that
sparkles with wit, rendering poet
ic ami sometimes magical the sci
entific basis that explains existence.

—
The West Coast premiere by the American Conservatory Theater added another quality— vi
sual beauty. From the timeless elegance of the round stage and grandiose doorways, to many won
derfully staged tableaux, the production created memorable images and poignancy, without limit
ing the actors' abilities to bring alive the humor of the text
The final scene provides a key to the plav. Our last vision is of motion — two couples waltz,
swirling in circles, around the stage. The music builds and language is lost Stoppard reveals that the
answer to existence is more likely to be found in the imagination than in scientific formulae.
—Alison Gordon

c;o TO THE hack of the class
For better or worse, every year in
commercial alternative radio can be de
fined by one song — tor instance,
"Smells Like Teen Spirit" for 1992 and
any one of those (ireen I )ay tunes for last
year. For much worse, this year stands
out for its bunch ol hits and bands that
never go in one ear to begin with. 1 )iver
sity has been a bad thing, since it isn't
smart hands like Pavement or the Mulls
or Yo 1 a I'engo that are getting air plav,
but hands like Hush, Better than Ezra ard
Tripping Daisy.
Any of the new stars of 1995 are inter
changeable with those hands that we for
got we forgot as it there's a difference
between Silverchair and Candlebox and
Ugl\ Kid |oe. Hut that's not even as bad as
Live selling a trillion albums and duping
anybody into thinking that their "an
thems were as deep as lyrics like "her pla
centa falls to the floor.' Then again, these
guys don't know enough to make the
drummer sit down instead ol jumping
around like an idiot in the"I Alone" video.

SEVEN
The surprising success of "Seven"
isn't that surprising to anyone who's
seen it. This dark and disturbing tale
pits two homicide detectives (Brad
Pitt and Morgan Freeman) against a
cunning religious fanatic who hopes
to make a statement about the moral
decay of society by committing seven
murders based on the seven deadly
sins over seven days. Pitt and Freeman
are pulled into the twisted world of
the killer as they pursue the string of
slayings to its riveting conclusion.
Like the two officers, the viewer is
forced to question which evil is worse
— the killer or the world which he de
spises. Ihe finale offers no answers
and leaves him questioning human
nature. Screenwriter Andrew Kevin
Walker's debut is extremely powerful.
This gritty film grates the nerves,
turns the stomach and churns the
soul, but that's exactly what makes it
one of the year's best.
—Seth Goldstein

BEST FILMS
The biggest difference in independent lilm this year?
No "Pulp Fiction."
This is not to say that the quality of independent film has
fallen; in fact, if anything, this years crop may be one of the
best in recent memory. However, the films faced the same
problem independents face every year — not enough people
came to see them. And the audience is not entirely to blame.
The MPAA ratings board and the cowardice of Disney kept
"Kids" — a definite NC-17 — from being widely released, in
stead leaving the trailblazing path to "Showgirls' ( nuff said).
Nevertheless, this year still turned out some good ones.
Woody Allen's offering, "Mighty Aphrodite,' was typically
solid, the industry parody "Living in Oblivion had its mo
ments, Hugh Grant delivered another quirky performance in
"The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But (.ame Down A
Mountain." These, however, are my five top picks from the in
dependent films of 1995:
The Brothers McMullen: My favorite of the year. Produced
with less than your average student's milk money, writer-di
rector-actor Edward Burns made a huge name for himself,
first at Sundance and then at the box office. Ihe film inter

twining the stories of three Irish-Catholic brothers tripping
through life and love — incorporates smart and witty dia
logue with solid acting from a host of unknowns (Burns
friends, to save money) and a touching plot.
Kids: Potentially the most influential film of the year, limited
release held hack its progress at the box office. Photographer
Larry Clark's hand-held earnestness and cutting dialogue
made this film all the more real. Much of the negative hype
surrounding the film concerns whether kids today are really
as bad as in the movie. Critics who take this route are missing
the point: "Kids" is a look at what some kids are like, not all.
Clark's experience with the skate culture in Central Park
prompted him to make the movie. Despite this, the film is no
less disturbing. It showed here on campus last week; if you
missed it, you'd better hope this one comes out on video.
II Postino: Perhaps the most beautifully made film of the year,
"The Postman" gave a touching account of the evolution of
the relationship between a meek country man and renowned
poet Pablo Ncruda. The plot is surprising at times, saddening
at others, pleasing always. The scenery lends a feeling of ele
gance to the entire story, as does the musical score, lust a well
made film.

The Usual Suspects: Cod, this movie was fun to watch. The
mind games 28-vear-old director Bryan Singer's plot plays on
the audience are enhanced by a terrific ensemble cast, espe
cially Kevin Spacey as the gimp-legged Verbal. The plot moves
so quickly and is so engaging that it is over before you know it,
and no one knows what the hell happened. Gabriel Byrne also
shines in this gangster flick. "Who is Kaiser Soze?" I still don't
know for sure.
Smoke: Wayne Wang and Paul Auster's joint project (the pre
cursor to "Blue In Hie Face") has Harvey Keitel in an unfa
miliar role — no longer the calm and collected psychotic
gangster, he plays a sensitive and down-to-earth cigar shop
owner whose hobby has been to take a picture of his Brooklyn
shop at the same time every day for the last 18 years. William
1 lurt delivers an underappreciated performance as a widowed
writer struggling to survive. Strange events intertwine these
two, a hoy, a gasoline attendant (Forest Whitaker) and a
daughter in this film about the complexity of interhuman re
lationships. This film also has my favorite ending of the year
— Keitel tells an engaging anecdote that leaves us wanting
more but still completely satisfied at the same time.

RAP FAVORITES
I very year, the rap world fascinates me.
1993 was no exception, .is different sectors
ol hip hop battled lor my attention, with
each label dying to catch a glimpse ol me at
their record release parties.
Perhaps the most underrated rap album
ol the year was I he Nonce's "World L'lti
mate," an uncanny blend of cutting-edge
lyrics and soothing samples check it out!
Ol course, the Wu-Tang ( lan sure came on
strong, with members Ol' I)irty Bastard,
Method Man, Raekwon, and (ienius / (i/.A
making headlines.
Some ol my readers recently rolled me out
at 7:30 a.m. and asked what the greatest lyric
ol the year was. It has to be on the single "Next
level" from I he Alkaholiks'"('.oast II (.oast":
"Everybody knows that you can't bust

SF ART
Once sniveling in embarrassment from its quasi-cosmopolitan
reputation, San Francisco is now basking in the fluorescent glow
of two spankin' new art arenas. TheSFMOMA emerged from bu
reaucratic cold storage when its relocated self opened in January. It's be
come the icon of art culture in its new encasing: Swiss architect Mario
Botto's bricked, modern revamp of the cathedral... with an edge, dig?!
To placate those who prefer the classicist attitude of their
starched Ralph Lauren collars, the I egion of Honor reopened in
early November, revealing a refurbished Beaux-Arts building
ready to display Rembrandts n Reubens and endure the next big
quake. Situated atop a summit, the Legion provides an incredible
view of the Bay, the Golden Gate and the cityscape.
With the arrival of the two new museums, San Francisco, a city with a
legacy of great writers, artists and musicians, can finally move beyond its
anemic art collections and into cosmopolitan status.

INDEPENDENT FILMMAKERS
1995 has been a year of young buck independent filmmakers successfully market
ing their products to big-time producers and then losing their independent flair. Films
like "Reservoir Dogs" and "El Mariachi" were mere warm-up acts for Quentin Taran

lance culture of Big Movies with Big Talent and No

Thought In Hollywood
"Pulp Fiction" led to "Four Rooms" while Ro-
driguez snagged Antonio Banderas to launch yet

another shoot-'em-up film. Perhaps both direr
tors should make a movie together about well
dressed gangsters killing each other over lovt
and money, but I guess that's been done a!

BEST FILMS
The biggest difference in independent lilm this year?
No "Pulp Fiction."
This is not to say that the quality of independent film has
fallen; in fact, if anything, this years crop may be one of the

Woody Allen's offering, "Mighty Aphrodite,' was typically

"The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But (.ame Down A

know for sure.
Smoke: Wayne Wang and Paul Auster's joint project (the pre
cursor to "Blue In Hie Face") has Harvey Keitel in an unfa
miliar role — no longer the calm and collected psychotic
gangster, he plays a sensitive and down-to-earth cigar shop
owner whose hobby has been to take a picture of his Brooklyn
shop at the same time every day for the last 18 years. William
1 lurt delivers an underappreciated performance as a widowed
writer struggling to survive. Strange events intertwine these
two, a hoy, a gasoline attendant (Forest Whitaker) and a
daughter in this film about the complexity of interhuman re
lationships. This film also has my favorite ending of the year
— Keitel tells an engaging anecdote that leaves us wanting
more but still completely satisfied at the same time.

PAVEMENT ANI) GUIDEI) BY VOICES
Pavement and (>uided by Voices made
two of the finest albums of 1995, and no
one should be surprised. After all,
they've been dominating critics' "Best
of " lists for years now. What is surpris
ing, though, is the way they changed
things; up. Botfl band> followed their
smoothest and most heavily buz Ad
works to date {Pavement's 'Crooked
Rain. Crookst Rain 0 and GBVV "Hoe
Thousand," both 1994} with much less
focused worki- of jumblrd en*>t ion and
musical indulgence. Pavement's" Wowee 112
Zowec" is a huge and hard-to-sf|allow
work of genius, while C-B\ 's fAlien
Lines" bombards the listener with 28
perfectly jagged pop snippets. Sortgwrit
vr* Steve Malkmus and Robert Pollard
lemain two of the best around, crafting
deliciously ambiguous works that are
just specific enough to apply to whatever
you might have in mind. GBY fans won't
want to mils another great Pollard cre
ation, "Sensational Gravity Boy," by
Freedom Cruise (a.k.a. GBV with Kim
and Kellev Deal) on the "Red Hot 4

RAP FAVORITES
I very year, the rap world fascinates me.
1993 was no exception, .is different sectors
ol hip hop battled lor my attention, with
each label dying to catch a glimpse ol me at
their record release parties.
Perhaps the most underrated rap album
ol the year was I he Nonce's "World L'lti
mate," an uncanny blend of cutting-edge
lyrics and soothing samples check it out!
Ol course, the Wu-Tang ( lan sure came on
strong, with members Ol' I)irty Bastard,
Method Man, Raekwon, and (ienius / (i/.A
making headlines.
Some ol my readers recently rolled me out
at 7:30 a.m. and asked what the greatest lyric
ol the year was. It has to be on the single "Next
level" from I he Alkaholiks'"('.oast II (.oast":
"Everybody knows that you can't bust
this / You got a bad name like I )ick Butkus."
(!an't wait to see what '96 has in store lor us!

1995, BROUGHI I O YOU BY Till II II IK 11
I lelium and Polh lean I larvev not onl\ have an 11 in common,
but are also responsible for some ol the most memorable music ol

SF ART
Once sniveling in embarrassment from its quasi-cosmopolitan
reputation, San Francisco is now basking in the fluorescent glow
of two spankin' new art arenas. TheSFMOMA emerged from bu
reaucratic cold storage when its relocated self opened in January. It's be
come the icon of art culture in its new encasing: Swiss architect Mario
Botto's bricked, modern revamp of the cathedral... with an edge, dig?!
To placate those who prefer the classicist attitude of their
starched Ralph Lauren collars, the I egion of Honor reopened in
early November, revealing a refurbished Beaux-Arts building
ready to display Rembrandts n Reubens and endure the next big
quake. Situated atop a summit, the Legion provides an incredible
view of the Bay, the Golden Gate and the cityscape.
With the arrival of the two new museums, San Francisco, a city with a
legacy of great writers, artists and musicians, can finally move beyond its
anemic art collections and into cosmopolitan status.

INDEPENDENT FILMMAKERS
1995 has been a year of young buck independent filmmakers successfully market
ing their products to big-time producers and then losing their independent flair. Films
like "Reservoir Dogs" and "El Mariachi" were mere warm-up acts for Quentin Taran
tmo's and Kit hard Kodriquez's entrances into the vapid free
lance culture of Big Movies with Big Talent and No

Thought In Hollywood
"Pulp Fiction" led to "Four Rooms" while Ro-
driguez snagged Antonio Banderas to launch yet

another shoot-'em-up film. Perhaps both direr
tors should make a movie together about well
dressed gangsters killing each other over lovt
and money, but I guess that's been done a!

ready
Far, far away from I os Angeles, in the land
of murky streets and big buildings — New
York City, mecca of sin — two independent
directors have emerged as true voices on
the silver screen, unfazed by L. A.'s olam

jrous banality they are Edward Burns
("The Brothers Mr Mullen") and
Michael Almeyreda ("Nadja") W;itc I>
for them
—Zachary Thacher

MISCELLANEOUS ROCK
Pearl Jam and Neil Young did a
project together, supposedly to
unite the old with the new in some
exciting way, bur as it turns out,
"Mirror Ball" was just kind of
sludgy and forgettable.
The Smashing Pumpkins fol
lowed up "Siamese Dream" with
something huge and dramatic,
though probably pretty good if
one could sit through it all. Ex-
Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl de
buted his Foo Fighters, who are
similarly decent, if unremarkable.
Elastica's singles are pretty cool.
Punk kept getting big, and so
young bands now cite Busker Dii
3nd the Germs as main influences,

even though they were listening tc
Journey back then like everybody
else. Green Day continued to dc
their thing, and Lollapalooza put
together a thoroughly good line
up, even though nobody stayed to
watch the headliners Sonic Youth.
Speaking of Sonic Youth, they
released another great album,
and would probably be getting
more air play if their catchiest
song wasn't 20 minutes long.
Built to Spill and the Jesus Li/arci
signed to major labels, and will
soon get the promotional push
necessary to claim the radio play
that's currently being wasted or
bands like Civ."

LIVE ACTION FUN
I he Flaming Lips' latest album, "Clouds Taste Metallic," may
have been a bit o! a disappointment, but their show with the
Archers ot Loaf at The Fdge this spring stands as one of the Finest
concert experiences ot the year. The stage covered with blinking
Christmas lights, the group stormed through most of their previ
ous two albums, reveling in more volume and energy than the
dumpv little club could hold. (iuitarist Ronald Jones sent screech
ing, zooming and whistling effects living about the room, while
lanky frontguy Wayne (ioync tried his best to yelp through it all.
I he group mixed charged renditions of their bubbliest radio stuff
("She I )on t Use Jelly," 'bad Days ') with just plain great stuff
("When Yer 22, Moth in the Incubator ) to make 90 minutes of
live rock at its finest. I he I ips are one of just a handful of bands
who could share «i bill with the Archers of I.oaf and not be hope
lessly outdone.
Other concert highlights include Yo 1.1 lengo's Hay Area shows,
the Super*.hunk / Spinanes show at the Fillmore, P.I. Harvey at the
War field and the actually quite good I ollapaloo/a. The most disap
pointing show was probably I 1/ Phair at the Warfield, though Se
hadoh s Fillmore date wasn t .is spectacular as it should have been ei
ther. Also, Farthwisc Productions has been bringing great bands —
like the SI Seals, the I ieraldine Fibbers, Archers of I oaf, the Think
ing Fellers I nion I ocal 252 and more within easy bikingdistance
ot Stanford, with friendly, cheap shows in the Palo Alto area.

WHITNEY BIENNIAL
It endeavored to be a represen
tative survey of American art, but
alas, it became a punching bag for
haughty critics.
That could probably describe
any Whitney biennial, but here
we mean the 1995 incarnation ol
New York's Whitney Museum ol
American Art s much-lambasted
exhibition.
While the pundits blasted the
1993 show tor being too political,
this year s show was deemed too
polite: Curator Klaus Kertess was
accused of stepping too lightly,
dodging the confrontational in
favor of the inoffensive.
That attack was perhaps un
fair to the 89 artists represented,
some of whom produced impres
sive works. There were the hig:
Nari Ward's tarred hearse
swathed in automobile mufflers
and Nancy Rubins' "Mattresses
and Cakes" — precisely what the
title implies, suspended from the
ceiling. There were the big guns:
Cindy Sherman, Richard Serra,
and Cv Twombly contributed
works. And there were big hopes
for up-and-comers like con
ceptualist Rirkrit Tiravanija.
but the critics were not entire
ly off the mark. The show was,
well, bland. little in the show had
the kind of visceral impact one
expects from art; even graphic
works, like (Catherine Opie's pho
tographs of a sexual demi
mondaine, seemed only superfi
cially shocking.
Too hot. Too cold. Sigh.
Maybe 1997 will be juuuust right.

HOLLYWOOD — BAD SCRIPTS, WORSE ACTRESSES
Hollywood's premises have been embarrassing. I rom "Dangerous Minds'' to "Powder" to "Vampire in
Brooklyn, ' everything's been a formula movie. And nobody's even improved the formulas. I lollvwood sutlers
trom a severe lack ot interesting ideas which is most clearly illustrated by their premises. 1 atelv, when some
one does have a good premise, thev fail to develop it. Onlv "(llueless ami

Strange 1 )ays," in fact, had exciting premises."( lueless" actually deliv
ered and fulfilled its premise s potential, but "Strange Days" drowned
in a let's be-deep-and make an irresponsible-comment on the-I.A
Riots abyss, ii was the queen of movies that could have been. With An
gela Bassett, Ralph l iennes and even Juliette 1 ewis, plus some more

acting classes, they could have made a better-than-decent movie.
But the script took the film company down the wrong road and
ran it oft a cliff.
Admittedly, "The Scarlet Letter" hail a good premise — but
I lollvwood certainh didn't write it. Nordid Demi Moore capture
Hester Prvnne's essence. In a rosier world, one would blame
I )emi s work on a bad script, but the deluded, egotistical actress
has got to take some responsibility for her choices.

Speaking ot bad, bad actresses abound. Cood roles in aver- '
age movies go to 1 >emi Moore, who clearly don't know what to
do with new and exciting scripts which don't ask for nudity or
giving head ("Disclosure 1. Maybe we should fire everybody and
iitst have Angela Bassett, Emma Thompson, Susan Sarandon,
kathx Bates and me make all the decisions in I lollvwood.

PLAY OF THE YEAR
"If there is an equation for a
curve like a bell there must be an
equation for one like a bluebell, and
if a bluebell> why not a nne't"
Tom Stoppard's newest play
"Arcadia" is poetic, intelligent and
funny. Only a talented writer can
weave together topics as esoteric as
Lord Byron, the second law of
thermodynamics and garden
landscaping to produce absorbing
theater. Stoppard, through clever
manipulation of language, suc
ceeds in producing a work that
sparkles with wit, rendering poet
ic ami sometimes magical the sci
entific basis that explains existence.

—
The West Coast premiere by the American Conservatory Theater added another quality— vi
sual beauty. From the timeless elegance of the round stage and grandiose doorways, to many won
derfully staged tableaux, the production created memorable images and poignancy, without limit
ing the actors' abilities to bring alive the humor of the text
The final scene provides a key to the plav. Our last vision is of motion — two couples waltz,
swirling in circles, around the stage. The music builds and language is lost Stoppard reveals that the
answer to existence is more likely to be found in the imagination than in scientific formulae.
—Alison Gordon

c;o TO THE hack of the class
For better or worse, every year in
commercial alternative radio can be de
fined by one song — tor instance,
"Smells Like Teen Spirit" for 1992 and
any one of those (ireen I )ay tunes for last
year. For much worse, this year stands
out for its bunch ol hits and bands that
never go in one ear to begin with. 1 )iver
sity has been a bad thing, since it isn't
smart hands like Pavement or the Mulls
or Yo 1 a I'engo that are getting air plav,
but hands like Hush, Better than Ezra ard
Tripping Daisy.
Any of the new stars of 1995 are inter
changeable with those hands that we for
got we forgot as it there's a difference
between Silverchair and Candlebox and
Ugl\ Kid |oe. Hut that's not even as bad as
Live selling a trillion albums and duping
anybody into thinking that their "an
thems were as deep as lyrics like "her pla
centa falls to the floor.' Then again, these
guys don't know enough to make the
drummer sit down instead ol jumping
around like an idiot in the"I Alone" video.
—Artnilii l\ui

SEVEN
The surprising success of "Seven"
isn't that surprising to anyone who's
seen it. This dark and disturbing tale
pits two homicide detectives (Brad
Pitt and Morgan Freeman) against a
cunning religious fanatic who hopes
to make a statement about the moral
decay of society by committing seven
murders based on the seven deadly
sins over seven days. Pitt and Freeman
are pulled into the twisted world of
the killer as they pursue the string of
slayings to its riveting conclusion.
Like the two officers, the viewer is
forced to question which evil is worse
— the killer or the world which he de
spises. Ihe finale offers no answers
and leaves him questioning human
nature. Screenwriter Andrew Kevin
Walker's debut is extremely powerful.
This gritty film grates the nerves,
turns the stomach and churns the
soul, but that's exactly what makes it
one of the year's best.
—Seth Goldstein

BEST FILMS
The biggest difference in independent lilm this year?
No "Pulp Fiction."
This is not to say that the quality of independent film has
fallen; in fact, if anything, this years crop may be one of the
best in recent memory. However, the films faced the same
problem independents face every year — not enough people
came to see them. And the audience is not entirely to blame.
The MPAA ratings board and the cowardice of Disney kept
"Kids" — a definite NC-17 — from being widely released, in
stead leaving the trailblazing path to "Showgirls' ( nuff said).
Nevertheless, this year still turned out some good ones.
Woody Allen's offering, "Mighty Aphrodite,' was typically
solid, the industry parody "Living in Oblivion had its mo
ments, Hugh Grant delivered another quirky performance in
"The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But (.ame Down A
Mountain." These, however, are my five top picks from the in
dependent films of 1995:
The Brothers McMullen: My favorite of the year. Produced
with less than your average student's milk money, writer-di
rector-actor Edward Burns made a huge name for himself,
first at Sundance and then at the box office. Ihe film inter

twining the stories of three Irish-Catholic brothers tripping
through life and love — incorporates smart and witty dia
logue with solid acting from a host of unknowns (Burns
friends, to save money) and a touching plot.
Kids: Potentially the most influential film of the year, limited
release held hack its progress at the box office. Photographer
Larry Clark's hand-held earnestness and cutting dialogue
made this film all the more real. Much of the negative hype
surrounding the film concerns whether kids today are really
as bad as in the movie. Critics who take this route are missing
the point: "Kids" is a look at what some kids are like, not all.
Clark's experience with the skate culture in Central Park
prompted him to make the movie. Despite this, the film is no
less disturbing. It showed here on campus last week; if you
missed it, you'd better hope this one comes out on video.
II Postino: Perhaps the most beautifully made film of the year,
"The Postman" gave a touching account of the evolution of
the relationship between a meek country man and renowned
poet Pablo Ncruda. The plot is surprising at times, saddening
at others, pleasing always. The scenery lends a feeling of ele
gance to the entire story, as does the musical score, lust a well
made film.

The Usual Suspects: Cod, this movie was fun to watch. The
mind games 28-vear-old director Bryan Singer's plot plays on
the audience are enhanced by a terrific ensemble cast, espe
cially Kevin Spacey as the gimp-legged Verbal. The plot moves
so quickly and is so engaging that it is over before you know it,
and no one knows what the hell happened. Gabriel Byrne also
shines in this gangster flick. "Who is Kaiser Soze?" I still don't
know for sure.
Smoke: Wayne Wang and Paul Auster's joint project (the pre
cursor to "Blue In Hie Face") has Harvey Keitel in an unfa
miliar role — no longer the calm and collected psychotic
gangster, he plays a sensitive and down-to-earth cigar shop
owner whose hobby has been to take a picture of his Brooklyn
shop at the same time every day for the last 18 years. William
1 lurt delivers an underappreciated performance as a widowed
writer struggling to survive. Strange events intertwine these
two, a hoy, a gasoline attendant (Forest Whitaker) and a
daughter in this film about the complexity of interhuman re
lationships. This film also has my favorite ending of the year
— Keitel tells an engaging anecdote that leaves us wanting
more but still completely satisfied at the same time.
