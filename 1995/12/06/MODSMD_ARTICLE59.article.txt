# The 						Stanford Theatre: A 'new' tradition
## 
### Allison Amend 
In December 1487, the Stanford Theatre
opened its doors, its marquis advertising a
I red Astaire film festival.
Little did the theater expect the 1,200 peo
ple who were closet 1 red fans. Or the 1,200
people who came every night for the next two
weeks, selling out the theater.
David Packard, president of the Stanford
Theatre Foundation, realized that Palo Alto
could support a vintage movie house. "We
thought we'd buy the theater and make it a
permanent place to watch old mo\ ics." here
calls.
Ills dream to restore the theater to its
original gloi \ and create a "nun ie museum
took two years and Sf> million. But the
continuation of tradition demanded it.
I he Stanford Theatre was built in 1923
and played an integral part of I'niversity A\
enue's entertainment scene. Its vaudeville
stage w.is used for shows before the movie
and during the intermission. In tact, "We
found an old advertisement for (linger and
her Redheads on April I i, 1926, savs
Packard. (linger Rogers was only I \.
The organ, too, was an essential part of
movie going, providing the accompaniment
for silent movies, and then, when "talkies
were invented, as a way to entertain and get
audiences in the mood.
Packard was intent on restoring this at
mosphere, the shared sense of communis
interaction and excitement that audiences in
the 20s and '.Mis experienced.
To this end, he insisted that the theatei be

a comfortable place to watch movies, resem
bling the experience of moviegoers in the
19205. He also had to make sure the theater
was seismic ally sound. "It cost a lot more
than we thought, but we wanted to make it
safe for the big earthquake," Packard says.
I Ins was no small task. Operated as an ar
thouse, second-run movie theater, the Stan
ford I heatre had fallen into disrepair. "There
was no curtain, no chandelier," savs Packard.
It looked like someone had spray-painted it
a uniform purple.'
Theater Manager I ibbv Roberts ran the
theater prior to Packard's purchase. "It
looked like an old gray battleship,' she jokes.
Original water color sketches of the interior
werec( insulted and no expense was spared to recre
ate the original decor. The organ, too, is from the
'20s, though the original was lost. "It's a much bet
ter organ than the original,'' says Packard, referring
to the Wurli/ter — and its origins in Mann's ( hi
nese Theater in 1..A.
I he second mission of the Stanford The
atre Foundation (an offshoot of the Packard
Foundation) is to "preserve Hollywood
films,'' savs Packard.
"Films |before 1950| were printed on
flammable nitrate stock which disintegrates,"
explains Packard. I'he complicated transfer
process costs about $10,000 per film. Pro
ceeds from the non-profit foundation go to
efforts to restore and preserve Hollywood
». lassie s.
"It's really vital" to preserve classie films,
says Roberts. "There are a lot of important
causes, but to ignore our heritage and histo
ry we lose a lot." She notes that the theater

maintains a vast library, including the last re
maining copies of some titles.
"People see that problems that seem over
whelming are not new. The conflict, the love,
the heartache was going on in the '30s and
405," says Roberts.
This week marks the sixth anniversary of
the re-inauguration of the Stanford Theatre.
The dream imagery of "The Wizard of Oz"
was an apropos choice for the opening.
"It's not just a shoebox where you plop
down and say 'entertain me'; it's an elegant

setting" stresses Roberts.
Stanford senior (Ihuck (lohen agrees, "It >
so much nicer than going to one of those
mass-chain theaters."
Independent film-maker Josh Davis, alsi
a Stanford senior, agrees. "The Stanford The
atre represents an era when cinema did nol
end at the screen. The art of the film is mar
ried to the architecture of the cinema, in the
same way that you can deduce the quality ol
modern commercial film from the million
plex theaters in which they are shown.
"Plus it's cheaper" he adds .
The theater also serves as a venue for audi
ences to meet artists. Proving the theater's com
mitment to personal appearances, Packard re
marks, "We've brought Jack Lemmon, Bill)
Wilder and Sandra Dee. a\iul look for Leslie
Caron to appear the second week of January."
For the next two weeks, the Theatre is alsi
showing the original "Sabrina," starring Au
drey Hepburn.
Another tradition started by Packard i*
the Christmas I've showing of" It's a Wonder
ful Life."
"It's a fabulous tradition," says Roberts
"The holiday cheer that comes in the dooi
[makes for] a heartwarming experience."
The show always sells out, since all the
people "who don't go to church go to the
Stanford Theatre," says Packard.
Sitting in the theater, watching the organ
ist descend, the notes of his instrument waft
ing up to the tiled proscenium, the lights ol
the chandeliers dimming, the tangible excite
ment in the theater growing collectively, one
understands whv the comparison is made.
