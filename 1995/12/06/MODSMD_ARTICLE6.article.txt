## Gates CS building to open in January 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Undergraduate and graduate
faculty in the Computer Science
Department will have to learn to
live and work together under one
roof when the Gates Computer Sci
ence Building opens next month.
The department will move more
than 500 people and about 1,000
computers into the new building
over winter break, preparing for an
opening dedication at the end of
January. Professors and graduate
students will have offices in the
building, and some lecture classes
may be held there during winter
quarter.
The $38.4 million construction
project, which begun in summer
1994, was funded in part by an ini
tial gift of $6 million from Bill
Gates, owner and co-founder of Mi
crosoft Corp. and one of the world's
richest men. Other donors, includ
ing the Fujitsu conglomerate, re
portedly picked up much of the re
maining cost.
The building, according to De
partment Chair John Hennessy,
represents a huge step forward in
both technical and human terms.
"It's terrific to have the depart
ment all together," he said, adding
that the department's "aggregate
bandwidth," a measure of network
capacity which may well become a
status symbol in an increasingly
networked world, would also jump
exponentially clue to some of th<*
technology used in the new
building.
Bringing together research
labs and offices currently scat
tered in almost a dozen different
sites around campus, the build
ing will also hold three general
purpose lecture halls, a new con
trol room for live broadcasts of
Stanford classes, new meeting
rooms and even a terrace.
The New York architectural
firm of Robert A. M. Stern
Associates, together with the
San Francisco firm Kong and
Chan, designed the six-story
building.

New video technology
The two large lecture halls,
located in tin- basement, provide
a host of equipment for broad
cast through the Stanford
Instructional Television Net
work. Lighting designed to emit
less heat and glare while enhanc
ing the television image, along
with a permanent camera and
microphones aimed at capturing
students' questions, have been
installed.
"As we put new rooms in
place, it gets better and better,"
said SITN Chief Engineer
Aubrey Harris, referring to the
network's recent addition of on
canipus broadcast sites.
In addition to the Gates
Building, last fall's completion
of the Thornton Center for Engi

neering Management has also
added to SITN's total of 10 "TV
classrooms."
A bank of six color monitors
has also been installed facing the
blackboards in one room, Harris
said, so that students from vari
ous sites around the world could
conceivably interact on a face-to
face basis with Stanford profes
sors.
Two-way video has only
recently been added to the range
of capabilities that SITN offers
its corporate partners, Harris
said, so it's hard to say what
classes might be available in
such a format.
But one design class in
mechanical engineering has
already been taught with profes
sors interacting with students at
Hewlett-Packard operations in
Madrid, Spain, he said.
Contributions and logistics
Fileen Schwappach, who
helped coordinate the Computer
Science Department's planning
for the new building, said the
level of donor interest in the pro
ject overall had been surprising
ly high.
"Usually, when somebody
wants to donate something, it\-
stuff they don't need any more,"
she said, but this time the
department has received more
high-profile gifts, such as a new
electronic kiosk that will guide
visitors around the building.
According to Schwappach, th<
new building resulted from ;i
long process of paring down wish
lists and responding to changes
in University-wide plans.
The department's original
plan for two new buildings,
dubbed the "Exceedras." oredat

ed the 1989 Loma Prieta Earth
quake, she said. In fact, she said
she was in a planning meeting
for the project when the earth
quake hit.
Rebuilding efforts diverted
attention from the planning pro
cess, she said, allowing time for
changes to be made in the origi
nal concept of two separate, cir
cular buildings.
Facilities Director of Project
Management Mark Jones said
planning had also been compli
cated by two other construction
projects in the area. An exten
sion to the Center for Integrated
Systems is being built on the
same plot of land, while con
struction of a pedestrian mall
along Sen a Drive is taking place

nearby, blocking Campus Drive.
The CIS extension, funded in
part by a $6 million gift from
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen,
is scheduled for completion in
early January, while the Serra
Mall project will continue into
February.
Construction was slowed in
winter 1994 by heavy rains,
Jones said, as well as changes in
welding procedures for the
building's steel frame
requested by the University in
response to the 1994 Northridge
earthquake.
General contractor Rudolph
and Sletten, which hired 47 sub
contractors for the building, has
met all University deadlines and
staved on budget despite the

delays, Jones said.
Professors also seem relieved
to have the new facilities. Hen
nessy said some current storage
facilities lack air conditioning
and create an otherwise "nasty"
environment for research.
The Computer Systems Labo
ratory alone has equipment and
faculty in five different loca
tions, Schwappach said.
Hennessy also said the new
"fully switched" network, which
allows individual Ethernet cir
cuits for each computer in the
building, would allow for experi
ments in providing video images
to desktop computers.
In all, 24 separate projects
will be brought under one roof in
the new building.

technology used in the new
building.
Bringing together research
labs and offices currently scat
tered in almost a dozen different
sites around campus, the build
ing will also hold three general
purpose lecture halls, a new con
trol room for live broadcasts of
Stanford classes, new meeting
rooms and even a terrace.
The New York architectural
firm of Robert A. M. Stern
Associates, together with the
San Francisco firm Kong and
Chan, designed the six-story
building.

New video technology
The two large lecture halls,
located in tin- basement, provide
a host of equipment for broad
cast through the Stanford
Instructional Television Net
work. Lighting designed to emit
less heat and glare while enhanc
ing the television image, along
with a permanent camera and
microphones aimed at capturing
students' questions, have been
installed.
"As we put new rooms in
place, it gets better and better,"
said SITN Chief Engineer
Aubrey Harris, referring to the
network's recent addition of on
canipus broadcast sites.
In addition to the Gates
Building, last fall's completion
of the Thornton Center for Engi

neering Management has also
added to SITN's total of 10 "TV
classrooms."
A bank of six color monitors
has also been installed facing the
blackboards in one room, Harris
said, so that students from vari
ous sites around the world could
conceivably interact on a face-to
face basis with Stanford profes
sors.
Two-way video has only
recently been added to the range
of capabilities that SITN offers
its corporate partners, Harris
said, so it's hard to say what
classes might be available in
such a format.
But one design class in
mechanical engineering has
already been taught with profes
sors interacting with students at
Hewlett-Packard operations in
Madrid, Spain, he said.
Contributions and logistics
Fileen Schwappach, who
helped coordinate the Computer
Science Department's planning
for the new building, said the
level of donor interest in the pro
ject overall had been surprising
ly high.
"Usually, when somebody
wants to donate something, it\-
stuff they don't need any more,"
she said, but this time the
department has received more
high-profile gifts, such as a new
electronic kiosk that will guide
visitors around the building.
According to Schwappach, th<
new building resulted from ;i
long process of paring down wish
lists and responding to changes
in University-wide plans.
The department's original
plan for two new buildings,
dubbed the "Exceedras." oredat

ed the 1989 Loma Prieta Earth
quake, she said. In fact, she said
she was in a planning meeting
for the project when the earth
quake hit.
Rebuilding efforts diverted
attention from the planning pro
cess, she said, allowing time for
changes to be made in the origi
nal concept of two separate, cir
cular buildings.
Facilities Director of Project
Management Mark Jones said
planning had also been compli
cated by two other construction
projects in the area. An exten
sion to the Center for Integrated
Systems is being built on the
same plot of land, while con
struction of a pedestrian mall
along Sen a Drive is taking place

nearby, blocking Campus Drive.
The CIS extension, funded in
part by a $6 million gift from
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen,
is scheduled for completion in
early January, while the Serra
Mall project will continue into
February.
Construction was slowed in
winter 1994 by heavy rains,
Jones said, as well as changes in
welding procedures for the
building's steel frame
requested by the University in
response to the 1994 Northridge
earthquake.
General contractor Rudolph
and Sletten, which hired 47 sub
contractors for the building, has
met all University deadlines and
staved on budget despite the

delays, Jones said.
Professors also seem relieved
to have the new facilities. Hen
nessy said some current storage
facilities lack air conditioning
and create an otherwise "nasty"
environment for research.
The Computer Systems Labo
ratory alone has equipment and
faculty in five different loca
tions, Schwappach said.
Hennessy also said the new
"fully switched" network, which
allows individual Ethernet cir
cuits for each computer in the
building, would allow for experi
ments in providing video images
to desktop computers.
In all, 24 separate projects
will be brought under one roof in
the new building.

With the addition of skylights in the Gates Computer Science Building, natural sunlight will help provide
a pleasant environment for faculty and students.
Undergraduate and graduate
faculty in the Computer Science
Department will have to learn to
live and work together under one
roof when the Gates Computer Sci
ence Building opens next month.
The department will move more
than 500 people and about 1,000
computers into the new building
over winter break, preparing for an
opening dedication at the end of
January. Professors and graduate
students will have offices in the
building, and some lecture classes
may be held there during winter
quarter.
The $38.4 million construction
project, which begun in summer
1994, was funded in part by an ini
tial gift of $6 million from Bill
Gates, owner and co-founder of Mi
crosoft Corp. and one of the world's
richest men. Other donors, includ
ing the Fujitsu conglomerate, re
portedly picked up much of the re
maining cost.
The building, according to De
partment Chair John Hennessy,
represents a huge step forward in
both technical and human terms.
"It's terrific to have the depart
ment all together," he said, adding
that the department's "aggregate
bandwidth," a measure of network
capacity which may well become a
status symbol in an increasingly
networked world, would also jump
exponentially clue to some of th<*
technology used in the new
building.
Bringing together research
labs and offices currently scat
tered in almost a dozen different
sites around campus, the build
ing will also hold three general
purpose lecture halls, a new con
