## BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN The 						Ghost of Tom Joad 
### 
Some albums arc predicated on produc
tion, some on emotion. The former are
easier to listen to, but the latter are worth
listening to.
Bruce Springsteen's newest album, "The
(ihost of Tom load, is a triumph for the
emotional power ot music. You'll find no
gimmicks or slick production here; The
Boss is the only performer on seven of the 12
tracks. What you will find is a man with an
honest voice and honest music, telling sto
ries ol America's underclass with emotion
economical, effective expressions of
anger and alienation, desperation and de
spair.
The focus of "Tom load" is the people
forgotten or injured by America: the crimi
nal, the unemployed and the illegal alien.
I he songs don't discuss the crushing mo
notony of everyday life, like "Born m the
l .S.A." I hey detail the acts of desperate
men — murder and robbery, making and
dealing drugs, losing work, love and hope.
The album was in part inspired by Stan
ford lecturer Dale Maharidge's book "Jour
ney to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Un
derclass." Musically, it seems strongly in
spired by Springsteen influence Woody
(iuthrie.)
Strongest of all (lie album's positive tea
lures are the lyrics. Springsteen has always
had a gift for succinct yef effective expres
sion; on "Tom load" some lines are pathos
distilled. Take, for example, the frightening
relation of an ex-con's attraction for his old
ways: "In the basement huniin' gun and a
hacksaw / Sip a beer and 13 inches of barrel
drop to the floor." The most complex and
best told story on the album is "(ialveston
Bay," about two Vietnam vets (one south
Vietnamese) who are Texas shrimpers, ex
ploring issues of racism, violence and for
giveness.
Springsteen's delivery of the lyrics is sat
isfving. The voice is not always polished, but
it is consistently expressive. I lis phrasing is
at times reminiscent of Willie Nelson, art
fully artless, and gives the words added
punch.
Unfortunately, the album's melodies are
not always so strong. While the songs on
IIM2l l M2 s exceptional "Nebraska" (the album
Tom load" most resembles) managed to be
both spare and musically compelling, some
ol the songs 011 " Tom load languish. Ihe
album's most satisfy ing songs tend to be the
more heavily instrumented and caretulh
arranged tracks, especially "Youngstown
and "Dry Lightening." A rhythmic, chug
gingdrum style reminiscent of a locomotive
does help enliven several of the tracks.
Because of the weak
melodies and the (wise) absence ol slick
production, " lom load" can be a lit lie
tough to approach. Read the Ivrics and lis
ten to it several times, however, and its
power comes out. The album is not .is bril
liant as "Nebraska," but in a time when
image can make stars it reminds listeners of
the real force behind the best musk.
