## The
						Great Escape 
### 
As time passes, the original British Inva
sions of the '60s and '70s are becoming more
and more mythic. What helps to emphasize
the magnitude of the British Invasions is not
only the quality of the music from that peri
od, hut also the nearly utter failure of British
bands ever since to gain any significant audi
ence in the States.
Perhaps even year a new British band is
touted as the "next big thing," but more often
than not, the American consumer will happi
l\ shrug them oil as the\ bin nevvl\ released
outtakesof a British singer dead lor 15 years.
Blur is vet another example of such a
group. " I lie (11eat 1 scape." the band s new
album, is meant to change all that, and while
it does have its moments, the likelihood that
Blur will now break out of their American
cult status is exceedingly slim.
Songwriter Damon Albarn has a definite
gift for turning pop songs into intelligent vi
gnettes of modern life. Letting his pen run
across a remarkable range of Fnglish lite, Al
barn both criticizes and pities his subject,
giving the songs a lyrical matnrit\ uncom
mon to much of popular music.
On "A i harmless Man." for example, Al
barn sings of a man "educated the expensive
wav, he knows his claret from .1 Beaujolais."
faking a wicked turn, Albarn goes on to ex
plain that although he thinks "we w ill respect
him / He moves in circles of friends / Who

just pretend they like
him / He does the same
to them, and when you
put it all together there's
the model of a charm
less man."
Unfortunately for
Blur, such lyrical intelli
gence will only pay off it
one has the printed
lyrics in hand, as most
of the tracks are either
too confusing or too
complex to understand
even after repeated lis
tenings. This fault, of
course, could he easily
compensated for by
equally intelligent and
complex music, but the
album seriously lacks
any mature sense of ei
ther melody or rhythm.
This does not
mean that the songs
aren't catchy. Indeed,
many are very inventive
as pop material. Never
theless, the songs blend
together as rather up
beat, eccentric jingles,
the type which seems to
produce neither posi
live nor negative reac
tions.
I hus, " I he C ireat
Escape" is a missed op
portunity lor an excel
lent lyricist to make a
dent in the American
market. 1 uckily for hug-

land, the Beatles are still outselling everyone.
