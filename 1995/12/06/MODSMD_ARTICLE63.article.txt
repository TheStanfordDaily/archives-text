# AC/DC
## Ballbreaker 
### 
"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge," the
title of Van I lalen's 1991 release, is probably a
better name for At!/DCs latest release,
"ballbreaker. After two decades and 15 a 1
bums, things have barely changed for
AC/DC, as they continue to chant the
teenage sexual innuendoes ol yore, but re
gardless of their lyrical immaturity, A( /IX!
continues to pump out the tantalizing guitar
rock that they have been idolized for.
On this now album, the classic hard rock
feel naturally immerses you into A(] / IX ter
ritory. Angus Youngs spellbinding guitar
solos and Malcolm Youngs larger than - lite
guitar rhythms continue to display some ol
rock's most venerated fretwork, and their
moving anthems and patented formulas make
them winners among new and old fans alike.
()n " burnin' Alive, wonderfully brooding
guitars, highly reminiscent of Danzig's
"Mother," begin the song, but Brian John
son's raspy shrill rudely nits in. lbs out-of
breath exhortations leave you in helpless
ness, wondering il you should rush to the
telephone to tell your friends about the new
album or to call the paramedics to help this
seemingly dying man.
The lyrics on this album are the epitome
of quasi-musical pornography. On "( over

You in Oil," the lyrics come out blatantly
clear: "she make you hot / you spray your
lot / comin' in honey/ we're headin' to the
top." Meanwhile, on "The Honey Roll,"
AC] / ix: show off their shallow, sophomoric
humor: "1 loncy roll over and lettuce on top."
More or less, AC / PC's five-year hiatus
from their last album has barely given us any
thing new. But old is good when you still get
the fired-up guitars, Johnsons trademark, al
beit aging voice and lyrics which can only
come from a band that is led by a school boy
who prances on stage in a tie and shorts.
