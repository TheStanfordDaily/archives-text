# KRISTIN HERSH
## The
						Holy Single 
### 
Imitation isn't the sincerest form of flat
tery. Sincere reinterpret.ition is, however,
and maybe that s the moral of Kristin I IcrsliV
holiday treat, "The Holy Single." Not so
much a batch of (Christmas sing-alongs as an
offering of spiritual ditties, the Throwing
Muse uncans the hammy sentiments with in
timacy, going it alone with acoustic guitar
and pretty, sparse accompaniments.
A cover of Big Star Alex Chilton's "Jesus
Christ" sets the mood, its chorus of "Jesus
C list was born today/Jesus Christ was
born" anchoring the tune in the Christmas
like vibe. Yet, hearing Hersh's uncommon,
incomparable voice, backed by rolls of tim
pani and shakes of bells, gives it a context be
vond the seasonal content. I ike her previous
solo efforts and her Throwing Muses materi
al, Hersh captures something spiritually es
sential th.it transcends the literal and inten
tional.
That inexplicable yet palpable quality ol
her expression comes through even clearer
on her bounding version of "Amazing
Crace." Soulful, mournful, celebratory and
then some, her vocals and galloping guitar af
fect rather than get bogged down in sap.
When Hersh croons "Amazing grace / How
sweet the sound / That saved a wretch like
me," she's not only singing to herself or for
herself, to an audience or for it. Hersh gets at
something bigger, which is her gilt.
