## Traps 
### 
Richly evocative of a for
gotten era, "Traps" details

situations tense with the onslaught of immi
nent change in colonial Indochina. Under
this pressure, the tenuous foundations of
domination shatters. A colony capitulates, a
marriage falls apart and family members are
pitted against one another.
Viewers are shown all the ugly faces of
rapists: a frustrated husband, a manipulative
plantation owner and the repressive I rench
government in 1950 Indochina. Kventually,
intolerance of their actions leads to the liber
ation of their victims, leaving the aggressors
suddenb impotent. Although a sense of ius
tice prevails, so does a sense that a story of
more depth is submerged under a weaker fa
cade of weathered relationships, based on
Kate Grenville's novel, "I)reamhouse."
Director Pauline Chan, in her first feature
film set in her native Vietnam, uses the Viet
minh communist uprising as a backdrop for
the drama unfolding among the main charac
ters. The central story is between Saskia Reeve's
Louise Duffield and her husband, Robert
Reynold's Michael. Their marriage in trouble,
they unknowingly put themselves in more peril
when they visit Vietnam to write a piece for
Michael's company on the positive aspects of
I rench colonialism. Michael soon gives in to his

weakness and the ma
nipulations of his
host, abandoning any
pretense of truthful re
porting as he churns
out propaganda. Dis
gusted and disap
pointed, Louise the
photographer cap
tures what's really
happening through
her lens. Chan's lens
runs parallel to
Louise's eyes, chroni
cling the fall ol the
French and Louises
wrenching split from
Michael.
Familial ties are
also disintegrating at
the seams. The
I )uffield's hosts, Sami
I rev's control-freak
I)aniel Renouard and
his daughter, Jacque
line Mckenzie's wild
child Viola, are con
stantly at odds with

one another. Things are further complicated
when they find out their houseboy, Kiet
Lam's fiery Tuan, is one of the Vietminh.
The eventual infiltration of the plantation

by the Vict minh is indicative ot the Vietnamese
presence in this film: quiet and pervasive. ('han
should've spent more time developing this
story rather than dotine on the lives ot the tor

eigners tailing apart around it. Their weakness
es are not as compelling as the strength of her
native people and their struggles.
