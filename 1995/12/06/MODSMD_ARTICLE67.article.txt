# White Man's Burden
## 
### 
Lawrence Bender's experi
ment in racial role reversal

was a good idea. Is it a great film? Not really.
John Travolta is, as always, fun to watch (it
only for the lingering hope that he'll strike
that classic "Saturday Night Fever'' pose).
The plot centers around the idea of a soci
ety in which blacks have complete social, po
litical and economic control, and the whites
are the poor victims at their mercy. The place
where this becomes problematic is obvious:
it is reductive, to say the least, and does not
lend itself to a story that does much outside
of traditional stereotypes.
Travolta plays Pennick, a white man (with
red hair — nice look!) who is pushed into des
peration when he loses his job after a misun
derstanding at work that stems directlv from

racial prejudice. The man who runs the com
pany is Thaddeus Thomas (Harry Belafonte),
the cold, rich businessman without the time
or the inclination to help poor Pennick. In
frustration, Pennick kidnaps Thaddeus and
the movie begins to become simplistic. Of
course, they become friends, but then evil so
ciety interferes and ruins everything.
The movie is very worthwhile,
though, in many respects. The world
that Bender has created is eerie because
it is so familiar. Little white children are
paraded around adorably at a fashion
show like tiny tokens of social redemp
tion. Travolta is beaten by two black po
lice officers, and when the white crowd
asks him what happened, he responds,
"I fit the description, that's what hap
pened." And to bring the politics onto a
ess public level. Iliad's wife looks on

with disgust as her son brings a white
girl home on a date.
What is more interesting than the twistsof
the plot or the staging ol the reversal is the
audience in the theater. While watching the
film, the audience was clearly divided: white
people were squirming, and black people
were laughing. While the reasons for these re
actions are complicated, it was a strange and
telling experience, one which perhaps makes
the movie a worthwhile and successful social
experiment.
I'he film, while not stunning cinematical-
Iv, could be worth watching for the unique
story. I )on't go to this movie if you're looking
for a brilliant manipulation of the suspen
sion of your disbelief. The film demands your
sense of reality, not fiction — and it is here
that it gains its power.
