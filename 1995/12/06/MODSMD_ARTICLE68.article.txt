## Allison Amend From child prodigy to mediocre 20-something 
### 
I peaked. I went home tor Thanksgiving
and I realized that not only has my life
been going downhill for a while, it will
continue its rapid descent from this point on.
It's been steadily declining since I was five.
Having excused myself from the dinner
table — stomach rumbling since the turkey
was overdone and the stuffing was pasty, and
cranberries are nasty because they're red and
that's nature's way of saying "don't eat me,"
and the pumpkin pie was made by my aunt
who thinks that sugar has all the side effects
of arsenic — I lumbered downstairs.
In the basement, behind my brother's soc
<cr trophies, next to the golf balls, baseball
kits and my mother's wedding dress, lurked a
t.irdboard box with my name. My name in
bigblack letters, the last of which was smeared
by what looked like a large splash of water.
The box smelled of storage, old cardboard
and mildew and years of neglect, and when I
opened it the nostalgia contained within
made me dizzy with its antiquity.
I found the clogs I made in the second
grade unit on Japan, the story I wrote in third
grade that I thought was absolutely publish
able (reading it again, it wasn't half bad), the
has relief I made of my mother walking the
dog (in my abstract period).
but the clincher, the coup de gracc that sent
me on my spiral of despair, was at the bottom
of the box, folded in hall as if hiding from me.

It was the report of my junior kindergarten
teacher. Yellowed with age, edges torn, purple
with mimeographing (now I really am dating
myself), it began promisingly enough.
"Allison utilises [ sic ] all areas of the room
during work time with ease. On any given
day she can be found interacting with her
peers in dramatic play, building with blocks
or hard at work at an art project."
"Whence my lost youth?" I asked myself.
Was there a certain day I stopped playing dra
matically? Or am I still acting, pretending to
be a student, inventing social relations?
I thought of my wood blocks, a symbol of
the all-important foundations of my exis
tence. Have they toppled to the ground, left
to gather dust in the toy chest?
Gone are the days of my artistry. "Her
work in the art department is superior, and
she works carefully for long periods of time
on each project." No longer do 1 linger on a
pastoral scene, decorating with glitter the
hem of a peasant girl's skirt. Yes, all imagina
tion has been squelched out of me, leaving
me only the bitter outlines of postmodern
theory with which to hurriedly pound out a
paper on my computer.
Tears sprang to my eyes as I read the last
paragraph. Mrs. Hayes sang my praises. She
didn't demand expansion from my two-page,
10-point font paper, didn't mark the margins
of her comments with "but whv?" and didn't

grade my performance.
"She is sure to continue to meet with suc
cess next year in senior kindergarten."
What expectations! Could 1 maintain my
level of scholarship at the next level: senior
kindergarten? I fear I did not. 1 caved under
the pressure of extended day twice a week,
the introduction of math into the curricu
lum. the long lonely afternoons desperately
trying to think of new Show and Tell items to
bring in once my well had run dry.
I have been stumbling through life. The
accolade of "retentive," once lovingly applied
to my mind, is now directed at a different
part of my anatomy by my peers. My "own
quiet way" has been replaced with a vocifer
ousness that sends my dormmates complain
ing to the RA. My "great personal satisfaction
from my work" comes from professorial af
firmation instead of interior pride.
I think it's like my sports career. In seventh
grade, I was always picked first in gym. 1 was
the biggest and had the best eye-hand coor
dination. Then, over the summer, all the boys
grew, and I got glasses from reading too
much in the dark. Eighth grade saw my soft
ball RBIs drop dramatically.
Let s continue with the baseball metaphor.
Could this mediocrity be just a slump? A bad
phase in my professional career, a poor start
to the season (bear with me here, I'm almost
through)? Mavbe if I just, I don't know, sacri

fice a chicken, wear my underwear back
wards, separate the lettuce from the potatoes
on my plate, things will turn around.
Then again, maybe they won't.
I put the box back on the shell, after re
moving a pretty impressive diorama of
whales from fourth-grade science fair and
the report card from junior kindergarten. 1
went back to the dinner table, smiled at my
cousins, translated for my auditorily chal
lenged grandmother ("country club, grand
ma, not Croatia") and navigated my way
back to Stanford, where 1 promptly taped the
report to the wall.
It fell off, of course, because my room
faces south and the walls are kind of slick and
for some reason all my pictures and post
cards and posters refuse to stick with tape,
but I bought industrial strength mounting
tape — which, by the way, is inexplicably $2
more at the Bookstore then anywhere else in
the world, except maybe airports and Vail,
Colorado — and insistently applied pressure
tii the sheet until it reluctantly agreed to dis
play itself on the wall above my bed. The fact
that it fell off at all is symbolic, indicative of
my larger inability to live up to my previous
glory.
Plateaued at the nadir of my existence, I sit
in bed and reread the evidence of salad days,
of achievement and success and satisfaction.
I peaked.

bring in once my well had run dry.
I have been stumbling through life. The
accolade of "retentive," once lovingly applied
to my mind, is now directed at a different
part of my anatomy by my peers. My "own
quiet way" has been replaced with a vocifer
ousness that sends my dormmates complain
ing to the RA. My "great personal satisfaction
from my work" comes from professorial af
firmation instead of interior pride.
I think it's like my sports career. In seventh
grade, I was always picked first in gym. 1 was
the biggest and had the best eye-hand coor
dination. Then, over the summer, all the boys
grew, and I got glasses from reading too
much in the dark. Eighth grade saw my soft
ball RBIs drop dramatically.
Let s continue with the baseball metaphor.
Could this mediocrity be just a slump? A bad
phase in my professional career, a poor start
to the season (bear with me here, I'm almost
through)? Mavbe if I just, I don't know, sacri

fice a chicken, wear my underwear back
wards, separate the lettuce from the potatoes
on my plate, things will turn around.
Then again, maybe they won't.
I put the box back on the shell, after re
moving a pretty impressive diorama of
whales from fourth-grade science fair and
the report card from junior kindergarten. 1
went back to the dinner table, smiled at my
cousins, translated for my auditorily chal
lenged grandmother ("country club, grand
ma, not Croatia") and navigated my way
back to Stanford, where 1 promptly taped the
report to the wall.
It fell off, of course, because my room
faces south and the walls are kind of slick and
for some reason all my pictures and post
cards and posters refuse to stick with tape,
but I bought industrial strength mounting
tape — which, by the way, is inexplicably $2
more at the Bookstore then anywhere else in
the world, except maybe airports and Vail,
Colorado — and insistently applied pressure
tii the sheet until it reluctantly agreed to dis
play itself on the wall above my bed. The fact
that it fell off at all is symbolic, indicative of
my larger inability to live up to my previous
glory.
Plateaued at the nadir of my existence, I sit
in bed and reread the evidence of salad days,
of achievement and success and satisfaction.
I peaked.
