# Shoven discusses CSRE's progress

### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
The state of Stanford's developing ethnic studies
major was discussed last night in a small, informal
meeting between student leaders and Dean of Human
ities and Sciences John Shoven.
In addition to discussing recent progress made in
developing the Comparative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity major, Shoven discussed a tentative timeline
for further developments in the program. He also
talked about some future and long-term goals for the
major.
The CSRE program, scheduled to begin next year,
will include concentrations in Asian-American Studies
and Chicano Studies. The African and Afro-American
Studies program may also become part of CSRE and a
new Native American Studies concentration may be
added sometime in the future, Shoven said.
CSRE will be an interdisciplinary program — much
like public policy or American Studies — with most
classes cross-listed within existing departments.
CSRE faculty will be members of the various depart
ments.
Searches for faculty members who will participate
in the CSRE major are ongoing in several depart
ments, including sociology, political science and an
thropology, Shoven said.
"We have a commitment to hire a tenure-line facul
ty member for Asian-American Studies and Chicano
Studies," said Shoven, pointing out that he is concen
trating his search on social science candidates.
He added that of the departmental searches, the so
ciology search is progressing the fastest. The Sociology
Department has already invited two potential faculty
members to Stanford for visits, and more may be on
the way.
Shoven also said several new hires by departments
as well as previously hired faculty will teach classes
that would be part of CSRE, possibly including Laura
Leets, assistant professor of communication, and En
rique Chagoya, assistant professor of art.
Shoven addressed the concerns of some students by
pledging to give students a larger
part in hiring decisions.
"I will ask each department
chair to look for a formal meeting
opportunity for the candidates as
they come through," Shoven said.
Shoven set May 1 as a tenta
tive deadline for having the
CSRE program in place. "I think
the departmental decisions (on
faculty candidates) would have to
be pretty much done by winter
quarter," he said.
Long-term goals for CSRE
were also discussed. Though
Shoven said CSRE has no plans
to include graduate degree pro
grams, graduate students would
be an important part of CSRE.
"CSRE is a uniquely designed
program and is gradually evolv
ing into something where under
graduates are at the core," he
said. "But, it will also involve a
research facility with faculty and
graduate student research."
Shoven also said the CSRE pro
gram could sponsor numerous
conferences and seminars on rele
vant topics such as U.S. race rela
tions.
"I do not think we want to do
something good (with the CSRE
program) and then hide it when it
could make a real impact at
large," he said.
Shoven added that he hopes
CSRE will offer a wide range of
both majors and minors, and
even ultimately become self-suffi
cient.
"This thing should become
self-generating," said Shoven,
pointing out that if enrollment in
CSRE courses is high, depart
ments will gain interest in the
area and grant tenure to faculty
with interests in CSRE topics.
