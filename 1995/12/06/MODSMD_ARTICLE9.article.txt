Student commits suicide
Stanford student Shaun Anthony Roman, 21,
was found dead last week on a riverbank near his
home in New Mexico.
Tribal police on the Santa Ana Pueblo Reser
vation said the cause of death was a self-inflicted
gunshot wound, according to a University news
release.
Roman was found Nov. 29 close to his home
town of Bernalillo, N.M., near Albuquerque.
He had been an undergraduate student at
Stanford on and off since fall 1992, said American
Indian Program Office Director Benny Shendo.
Roman went to Stanford his first year, trans
ferred to Harvard for a year, and returned to
Stanford for a few quarters, stopping out and
returning once again before he left for home the
final time in early Noveml>er.
There will be memorial services at Stanford,
Shendo said, but none have yet been arranged.
Cards and donations may be sent to Dorothy
Roman, his grandmother, at 18 Rebehani Plaza,
Bernalillo, N.M. 87004.
Hawk reward upped
The Palo Alto Humane Society is offering an

additional $1,000 to anyone with information
about the killing of a red-tail hawk on campus in
November.
A news release from the society said members
hope that the additional money will "stem the
tide of illegal poaching activities on the Stanford
campus and track down the person(s) responsible
for the killing of a red-tail hawk."
The donation brings the total reward offered
for information to $2,000; the first $1,000 was
contributed by Wildlife Rescue Inc.
The hawk was found dead on Nov. 13, one
month after it had been released from rehabilita
tion needed for an accident in which the bird
crashed in Tanner Fountain outside Memorial
Auditorium.
It was the third incident of a bird being killed
on campus; carrying firearms on campus is a
felony.
"Our offer of this reward reflects the deep pub
lic outrage over the untimely death of the hawk,
who suffered much in her three short years,"
society president Carole Hyde, who works in the
School of Humanities and Sciences, said in a
statement.
Anyone with information should contact the
humane society at 327-0631.
