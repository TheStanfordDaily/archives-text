Consider a Linguistics Course this Winter
Linguistics tries to understand the miracle of language. Why can a child of four, who can't
even add six and eight, still perform extraordinarily complex operations in speech that the
most sophisticated computers can't? Why is it that all human languages have certain
structural properties in common? What role does language play in differentiating people by
social class, ethnicity, and sex? What are the systematic differences between dialects and
other varieties of a language?
Here are some reasons why students find linguistics exciting:
• Students in introductory courses can be trained to do original research
• The data for linguistic investigation is all around you in daily life in cafeterias and
restaurants, on TV, in party conversations, etc.
• Linguistics courses are intellectually stimulating and FIJN
