Thomas Jefferson
needed a computer.
Just imagine what this philosopher, architect,
dedicated agriculturalist and father of
democracy could have done with the power
of a computer at his fingertips.
If only Thomas Jefferson could have come to Mills.

Mills offers two graduate programs for modern Jeffersons —
women and men with limited computer background who need
advanced computer skills to pursue their personal goals:
* Master's degree in Interdisciplinary Computer Science, an innovative
program that gives you the training to integrate
today's technology with your chosen field,
® New Horizons certificate program that prepares you for employment
in the computer industry
Small classes and friendly, accessible faculty. Course work and
research opportunities using multimedia workstations. Career
internships. Classes Tuesday/Thursday to suit the schedules of
working adults. Convenient Oakland location just off Highways
580 and 13.
And a network of Mills graduates who work at Sybase, Sun,
IBM, Lucasfilm, the Exploratorium and elsewhere.
