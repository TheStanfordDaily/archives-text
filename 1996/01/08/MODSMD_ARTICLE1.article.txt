## Students trapped by East Coast blizzard 
### Frank Guinan Sarah Katz Editorial staff with AP wire reports 
One of the worst blizzards in almost 70
years shut down most of the East Coast yes
terday, stranding many Stanford students
trying to return from winter break — possi
bly for several days.
More than two feet of snow had accumu
lated by last night in Washington D.C.,
Maryland and northern Virginia, while the
New York area had received 13.5 inches. As
the storm moves north, the Boston area is
expected to receive between 18 and 24 inch
es by tonight.
"It's really frustrating. I'm really an
noyed. There's snow and wind everywhere.
Snow covers everything," said Becky Zim
merman, a stranded sophomore from Great
Falls. Va.. riirht outside the Washington,

13.C. area. "The thought of not being able to
register kind of upsets me. I'm ready for it to
be over already — I can't even get out my
front door."
The heavy snows mid low visibility shut
down airports in Washington, D.C., Balti
more, Philadelphia, Newark, N.J., and New
York City, which also affected hundreds of
connecting flights elsewhere in the country.
Stanford students who expected to fly out
yesterday or early today in time to pay their
University bills and sign up for classes ei
ther had to fight for earlier (lights or were
stuck, at home or in the airport.
Approximately 15 percent of the Stan
ford undergraduate student body comes
from the East, according to admissions fig
ures.
Even those who made it back on earlier
flights faced their share of problems.
