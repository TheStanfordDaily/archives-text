# Let it snow
## Students trapped by East Coast blizzard 
### Frank Guinan Sarah Katz Editorial staff with AP wire reports 
One of the worst blizzards in almost 70
years shut down most of the East Coast yes
terday, stranding many Stanford students
trying to return from winter break — possi
bly for several days.
More than two feet of snow had accumu
lated by last night in Washington D.C.,
Maryland and northern Virginia, while the
New York area had received 13.5 inches. As
the storm moves north, the Boston area is
expected to receive between 18 and 24 inch
es by tonight.
"It's really frustrating. I'm really an
noyed. There's snow and wind everywhere.
Snow covers everything," said Becky Zim
merman, a stranded sophomore from Great
Falls. Va.. riirht outside the Washington,

13.C. area. "The thought of not being able to
register kind of upsets me. I'm ready for it to
be over already — I can't even get out my
front door."
The heavy snows mid low visibility shut
down airports in Washington, D.C., Balti
more, Philadelphia, Newark, N.J., and New
York City, which also affected hundreds of
connecting flights elsewhere in the country.
Stanford students who expected to fly out
yesterday or early today in time to pay their
University bills and sign up for classes ei
ther had to fight for earlier (lights or were
stuck, at home or in the airport.
Approximately 15 percent of the Stan
ford undergraduate student body comes
from the East, according to admissions fig
ures.
Even those who made it back on earlier
flights faced their share of problems.
"I have a free ticket and could
either fly [todayJ or Saturday. We
argued for hours" to get it changed
to yesterday's 8 a.m. flight, said
senior Lori Fleishman, who comes
from New York City. Her flight was
the last to San Francisco.
Students stranded in snowed
in cities said they were particular
ly worried about paying their Uni
versity bills. Today is the last day
to pay winter quarter dues with
out incurring $25 late fee. It is also
the only day to sign up for many
classes.
"I don't know how lenient
they'll be," said sophomore Chris
Gregory, stuck in Washington,
D.C. "Hopefully, there will be
enough stuck back here for them to
be lenient."
Bursar Jon Erickson, who deals
with University bills, noted that
the delays are not unusual. "It's an
issue we deal with all the time," he
said, adding that his office handles
such problems on a case-by-case
basis. "We are not going to make a

blanket statement. ... They can
come into the Bursar's Office with
copies of airline tickets, boarding
passes, whatever. We're not going
to be bureaucrats. We're going to
be realists about this."
Sophomore Paige Mader, stuck
in Washington, D.C., said she is
worried about losing her spot in a
sophomore seminar which starts
tomorrow.
But sophomore Jonathan
Levitt, stranded in North Caldwell,
N.J., said, "I'm really not that con
cerned because I'm sure professors
will make exceptions for people
they know were stuck in two feet of
snow."
Registrar Roger Printup said
class sign-ups are done on a depart
mental basis and there is no Uni
versity policy on late arrivjds.
The storm is expected to contin
ue at least through today.
Meanwhile, some stranded stu
dents are making the best of the
extra vacation. "Playing in the
snow is always nice," Gregory said
of the two feet piling up outside his
house.
