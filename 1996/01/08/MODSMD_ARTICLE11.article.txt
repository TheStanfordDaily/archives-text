## Snowstorm cripples East Coast; airports, schools closed 
### 
(AP) — One of the worst blizzards to hit
the East in 70 years paralyzed much of the
region yesterday, piling up knee-deep snow
that shut down airports, made truckers give
up and even closed the doors at Wal-Mart.
Thousands were without heat and light,
and at least 20 people died.
"We're stuck wherever we're at," said
trucker Johnny Vollrath, idling his big rig at
a service station along Interstate 64 in West
Virginia. "It's real bad.... We're stuck in
the truck stop or the Kmart parking lot
bored to death."
Thousands of travelers were stranded at
airports, bus terminals and highway rest

stops. The storm closed the major airports
for Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia,
Newark, N.J., and New York City, which
also affected hundreds of connecting flights
elsewhere.
Suites of emergency were declared in all
or parts of Kentucky, Pennsylvania, West
Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, New York,
New Jersey and Delaware, sending hun
dreds of members of the National Guard out
to help.
Gov. Tom Ridge ordered all roadways in
47 central and eastern Pennsylvania coun
ties shut down from 10 p.m. yesterday until
noon today. Only emergency vehicles, cars

taking physicians or utility employees to
work, road crews, mid oil and milk deliveries
were allowed.
In Philadelphia, where a record 26 inch
es was on the ground by nightfall, cab driv
er Sam Winder said he had to give up after
sue runs to the.
"Too crazy out there," said Winder, "You
can't see spit out the windshield."
Most state offices and schools will be
closed today throughout the region. The
United Nations also will be closed today,
and New York City canceled classes for the
first time since 1978.
At least 20 deaths were blamed on the

storm, including five in Kentucky and five
in Virginia All of those were traffic deaths
except for a 79-year-old Bridgewater, Va.,
man who had a heart attack while shoving
snow.
More than 2 feet of snow was on the
ground in northern Virginia, Washington
and Maryland. There hadn't been that
much snow in the area since January 1922,
when 24.7 inches fell at Baltimore, the
weather service said.
About 16 inches of snow had fallen in
New York City by evening. Many people
stocked up on supplies during the day, leav
ing the streets desolate, white, wind

whipped caverns as darkness fell.
Snow fell all the way south into Georgia
and northern Alabama.
A freight train derailed near Blacksburg,
Va., where there was 18 to 20 inches of snow
on the ground nonetheless the cause of the
derailment wasn't certain, said Norfolk
Southern spokesman Bob Auman. No one
was mjured.
Some people tried to take the weather in
stride.
"I'm getting tired of these storms. We get
one this week, one next week, one last week.
I'm conditioned to them," said Richard Gin
des in Maiden, Mass.
