Arafat condemns Peres for slaying of terrorist
DURA, West Bank (AP) — Yasser Arafat yesterday blamed his partner in peace,
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, for the assassination of an Islamic militant who
had masterminded suicide attacks against Israel.
Arafat, speaking at a rally, said the killing of Yehiya Ayyash violated the spirit of the
peace process. He accused Israel of undermining PIX) authority by carrying out the
attack in the Gaza Strip, which is under his control.
"This is not what we have agreed upon. I appeal to Peres, the prime minister, to stop
damaging the Palestinian security inside Palestinian territory," Arafat said.
Is:ael "should not kill and assassinate on Palestinian land the struggler, the martyr
Yehiya Ayyash," Arafat said. The crowd applauded and chanted "Allahu akbar" — God
is great.
Israeli officials, who have refused to confirm or deny involvement in the assassination,
would not respond to Arafat's comments yesterday.
Israeli newspapers reported yesterday that the Shin Bet secret service was responsi
ble for the slaying, and that Peres had reaffirmed the orders of the late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin to hunt down Ayyash, who topped Israel's most-wanted list.
Yeltsin, others pray at rebuilt church
MOSCOW (AP) — President Boris Yeltsin and other dignitaries celebrated the Rus
sian Christmas yesterday by attending services at the newly rebuilt cathedral, which had
been destroyed by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
Yeltsin told reporters at the nearly finished Cathedral of Christ the Savior that its
rapid reconstruction symbolizes Russia's rebirth.
"The time of crisis has passed," he said after a ceremony laying the final stones in the
huge structure. "Stability and improvement are ahead."
It was another in a flurry of public appearances by Yeltsin after a two-month recovery
from a serious heart ailment. Yeltsin is expected to announce soon that he will seek re
election in June balloting.
The cathedral was Russia's largest before it was destroyed, and is the largest once
again. Critics call it excessive at a time of economic hardship for many Russians.
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, more people have begun celebrating religious holi
days like Christmas, which in the Russian Orthodox Church falls on Jan. 7.
Study says frosh low on casual sex, high on drugs
WASHINGTON (AP) — College freshmen are displaying dwindling support for casu
al sex and legal abortion, a survey says. But they have more liberal viewn on marijuana,
with support for legalization reaching a 15-year"high.
Support for keeping abortion legal rose steadily in the late 1980s, according to the Uni
versity of California's annual freshmen survey. But in the 1995 survey, it declined for the
third straight year, to 58 percent.
In 1987, 52 percent of the freshmen responding to the survey supported casual sex.
Now, 43 percent say it's OK for two people to have sex even if they've only known each
other a short time.
"There are more diseases and stuff. And I just don't think people want to sleep with
the first person they meet. They want to get to know them better," said Dennise I/edes
ma, an 18-year-old freshman at California State University-Los Angeles.
Among college freshmen, the belief that homosexual relationships should be prohibit
ed has declined 112 rom a high of 53 percent in 1987 to an all-time low of 30.6 percent. And
support for legalizing marijuana has risen to nearly 34 percent — double the 17 percent
who held that view in 1989.
"It's so abundant. It's no big deal because everybody is using it," said Jason Zavada, a
19-year-old freshman at the University of Kentucky who supports legalization. "We don't
see all the bad it's causing. It's an insane policy to treat people like criminals for using
something that comes from the earth."
