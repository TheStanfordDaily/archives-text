# Budget battle still far from over
## GOP leaders reject Clinton's plan as offices are set to reopen 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Republicans
rejected President Clinton's plan for a
balanced budget yesterday and warned
that they will close government pro
grams they don't like if there's no agree
ment on a budget plan in the next few
weeks.
"We are going to fund only those pro
grams we want to fund," said House
Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas.
Spending bills must originate in the
House, he said, adding, "We're in
charge. We don't have to negotiate with
the Senate, we don't have to negotiate
with the Democrats."
Clinton ended a three-week shut
down of federal programs Saturday
when he acceded to Republican
demands and offered a new seven-year
balanced budget plan.
That announcement kicked in con
gressional action to fund all government
programs, but only through Jan. 26. If
there's no budget agreement by then,

federal offices could close for the third
time this fiscal year.
At that point, DeLay said on NBC's
"Meet the Press," if House Republicans
don't want to fund programs they don't
like, such as the National Endowment
for the Arts or the Legal Services Corpo
ration, "we just won't bring it up on the
floor and fund it."
The Clinton proposal provided far
less savings in Medicare, Medicaid and
welfare than the seven-year plan that
emerged from Congress last year, and
would cut taxes over seven years by $87
billion, well below the $241 billion
sought by the Republicans.
"It shows us that Bill Clinton is the
big spending liberal Democrat we always
thought he was," said Rep. John Boehn
er, R-Ohio, on CBS' "Face the Nation."
"We are a long and far way apart."
"We're very concerned about
whether there are two snow jobs going
on here in Washington," said Sen. Trent

Lott, R-Miss., speaking of the snow
storm that shut down the capital and led
to cancellation of further budget talks
yesterday.
Clinton, asked as he left church what
he would do about Republican criticisms
of his budget, replied, "Keep working for
it
The Republican response was not all
negative. Lott, also on CBS, said the
Clinton budget was "a positive step. He
finally gave in to submitting a real bud
get."
Lott and Boehner also agreed the two
sides could split the difference over the
amount of Medicare savings —
Congress has proposed $201 billion over
seven years, the president $102 billion.
"It's realistic and doable," Boehner said.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,
appearing on "Meet the Press," was less
enthusiastic about a Medicare compro
mise. "I think the answer there is very
simple and that is no."
