# First Lady may be called to testify
## Newly revealed Whitewater documents seem to implicate Clinton 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The possi
bility that Hillary Rodham Clinton will
eventually have to appear before
Congress in the Whitewater and travel
office affairs seemed to rise yesterday,
with Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep.
William dinger saying newly produced
documents raise a broad spectrum of
new questions about her role in both
matters.
D'Amato said that billing documents
the White House turned over to the
Senate late Friday afternoon show that
Mrs. Clinton has not told the truth
about Whitewater, particularly her
activities relating to a fraudulent
Arkansas land deal known as Castle
Grande.
D'Amato stopped short of flatly
accusing the first lady of lying and he
was careful in hewing to his long-held
position that he doesn't currently plan
to summon Mrs. Clinton before the
Senate Whitewater Committee.
But in an appearance on ABC's

"This Week With David Brinkley,"
D'Amato, R-N.Y., said the committee is
growing increasingly frustrated with
delays in turning over Whitewater
information and doubtful of getting
truthful answers from White House
aides on Whitewater.
The billing records show "tremen
dous inconsistencies" with Mrs. Clin
ton's sworn statements to federal regu
lators that she performed only minimal
work for her Whitewater partner's sav
ings and loan, said D'Amato.
Mrs. Clinton's answers are "not the
truth," D'Amato added. "We've had
this kind of thing over and over again
from her people who have stonewalled
us, who feign memory loss."
Mrs. Clinton's billing records of her
work for her Whitewater partner's
failed savings and loan were first
sought two years ago by prosecutors. In
the absence of the documents, it was
impossible to evaluate Mrs. Clinton's
position that her work for Madison

Guaranty S&L was "minimal." In fact,
the billing records show 68 meetings
and telephone calls on Madison busi
ness.
in the travel office controversy,
Clinger said the House Government
Reform and Oversight Committee
"might" have to call Mrs. Clinton to tes
tify if more evidence surfaces contra
dicting her assertion that she had noth
ing to do with the 1993 purge of travel
office employees. Clinger, R-Pa., who
also was appearing on ABC, already is
submitting questions for the first lady
to answer in writing.
David Watkins, former White House
director of administration, stated in a 2-
year-old memo that came to light last
week that "we . . . knew that there
would be hell to pay" if "we failed" to
dismiss everyone in the travel office "in
conformity with the First Lady's wish
es."
Watkins was subpoenaed to testify
before dinger's panel next Thursday.
