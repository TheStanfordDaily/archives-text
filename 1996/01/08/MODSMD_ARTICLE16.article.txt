### 
WITH A UNANIMOUS Nov.
30 Faculty Senate vote,
Stanford undergraduates
finally got what most of them have
been craving for years: the option
to minor.
Though there are some con
cerns about how the new program
will affect the University — par
ticularly among faculty and
administrators of smaller depart
ments — minors are by and large
well-received by everyone, and
with good reason. The new pro
gram will finally give undergradu
ates, who previously only had the
option to double major, the oppor
tunity to diversify their academic
coursework without having to
bend over backwards to complete a
mountain of requirements.
In fact, the most serious con
cern about the program may be
whether University departments
can implement minors quickly

enough for the number of students
who want to take advantage of
them. Speed is of particular con
cern for this year's juniors, as they
will have only one year left to com
plete the program when it goes
into effect next fall.
Given the short timeline, indi
vidual departments will undoubt
edly be working quickly to craft
their specific programs. It would
help students if departments could
at least release general information
about potential programs as soon
as possible so that undergraduates
considering minors have enough
time to plan their schedules.
A little extra information —
even if it's not entirely specific —
never hurts, especially when many
classes are only offered once a year.
And sooner is definitely better if
current students are to take part
in the new opportunities offered
bv minors.
