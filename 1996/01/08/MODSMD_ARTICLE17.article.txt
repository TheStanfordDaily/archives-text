WHILE THE MERITS of
the new academic policies
designed to remedy grade
inflation at Stanford have yet to
be seen, some
expected shortcomings of the
rules have already surfaced. Not
only do the new rules limit aca
demic flexibility, they do not
address the root causes of grade
inflation.
In the W grade's debut, 2.5 per
cent of Stanford undergraduates
received the "withdrew" mark on
their transcripts. Some support
ers of the W grade may be correct
in saying that many students who
dropped undesirable classes dur
ing the first four weeks would
have probably done so anyway,
with or without the W. If this is
the case, then the policy in itself is
nothing more than window dress
ing for Stanford, hurting the 2.5
percent who decided to drop after
the deadline.
More likely, however, students
did what was widely assumed —
that they would drop classes earli

er to avoid getting the mark on
their permanent records. At best,
the W grade combats one of the
symptoms of grade inflation but
does not get at the heart of the
problem.
The Registrar's Office reported
that juniors and seniors waited
longer than freshmen and sopho
mores to drop classes. This sup
ports the argument that students
wanted to be academically chal
lenged without the threat of tar
nishing their records because,
according to Hector Cuevas, direc
tor of the Undergraduate Advising
Center, upperclassmen take more
difficult and in-depth courses.
Thus, rather than an end to
grade inflation, the result of the W
grade is that students will think
twice before taking the plunge
into a rigorous course of study,
opting for an easier alternative
class.
While concerns of grade infla
tion may be warranted, the Uni
versity's remedy leaves much to
be desired and falls short of goals.
