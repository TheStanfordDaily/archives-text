## Pursuing a friend 
### 
GUYS TEND TO like their female
friends. After a few months of
knowing each other and sharing
experiences, the guy, not surprisingly, con
siders pursuing a relationship with the
woman.
It's almost inevitable. And because guys
and girls think so differently, it's almost
hopeless as well.
If a girl considers you her friend, that's
all she thinks of you. When a girl meets a
guy, she places that guy into one of two
mutually exclusive regions. One is the
potential region, where you would be if she
considers you attractive or you have a cer
tain flare which happens to catch her eye.
The other is the friend region, where you
find yourself if she thinks you are
unattractive or perhaps dull.
The interesting thing about these
regions is that girls will never voluntarily
move a guy from one region to another.
Many guys, including myself, have fallen
into the trap of trying to be better friends
with the girl in the hopes of changing situ
ations. Unfortunately, because of the bar
rier between the regions, increasing your
status in one area will only harden the glue
that keeps you there.
Guys think differently. Guys see every
one not attached to the rock of Gibraltar as
a possibility. If you are a girl and you have
a guy-friend, you can bet that the romantic
thought has crossed his mind. If you are
reasonably attractive, the thought has

probably rented out a fair portion of his
romantic musings. To a guy, friend and
potentiiil girlfriend are not mutually exclu
sive. A woman can be a guy's best friend
and know everything there is to know
about him. She can know everything except
for the fact that he has fallen for her.
It's hard to pursue a friend. Mow do you
know if a friend likes you? If she's a good
friend, do you want to risk losing the
friendship built over many months or even
years? If you're nice, you also have to take
into account her feelings. It's hard to be
rejected, but it's even harder to be the
rejecter — especially if the rejected is a
good friend. How can she let him down eas
ily? How can she salvage his feelings and
save the friendship?
Pursuing a friend is fraught with risk.
I've seen many a brave soldier battle for a
friend's love and come out with a crushed
spirit and a broken heart. In some cases, I
admire their courage for trying. In other
cases, I wonder what the hell they were
smoking.
But then again, if you like your friend,
and if she's available, you should go for
her. After all, what have you got to lose?
Even though she doesn't know it, your
attraction to her is a big reason you're such
good friends. Without that hope for being
with her, you wouldn't have put so much
effort into the friendship in the first place.
While you want her romantically, she only
wants you as a friend. The relationship is

poisoned by these conflicting interests.
On the other hand, making your feel
ings apparent (how you do this is your
problem) leads to one of two outcomes,
both of which are favorable to bottling the
feelings inside. One outcome is that she
will agree to go out with you, you'll both
fall madly in love with each other, and
you'll get married and have three kids. The
other, more likely outcome is that she'll
reject you kindly but strongly. Because you
now know you have no hope with her, you
am start building a friendship on reality,
and you can stop occupying your thoughts
with hopeless fantasies.
Many girls would be shocked to discover
that a friend is interested in more than a
friendship. But as much as girls would
assert otherwise, a friendship is the best
starting point for a good relationship. You
already know the person. You know the
person's likes, dislikes, beliefs and goals.
You might be thinking she probably
doesn't like you. She's probably interested
in 10 other guys. She probably sees you as
just a friend.
Go for it anyway. You have nothing to
lose.

ships and two few relationships at Stan
ford.
