# Stanford nets 3 Rhodes
## One senior also receives Marshall scholarship 
### Dana Hangai Contributing writer 
All set to leave behind the California sun
shine, four seniors are preparing to ex
change Stanford for the universities of the
United Kingdom.
Stanford's three newest Rhodes Scholars
all plan to pursue careers in international
policy after studying at Oxford University.
Coterminal senior Angelina Marguerite
Foster, from Portland, Ore., wants to study
modern policy in the Middle East. Senior
Rachel Eyre Hall of Anchorage, Alaska, is
working for a doctoral degree in Japanese
studies while Alvan Azinna Ikoku of Los An
geles hopes to receive a master's degree in
public health and policy.
The Rhodes Scholarship, established by
British colonial statesman Cecil Rhodes in
1902, pays tuition and living expenses for
two years at Oxford, but may be extended
for a third year.
Stanford's three Rhodes Scholars were
among 32 American recipients announced
on Dec. 10. Stanford had the second largest
number of Rhodes Scholars among Ameri
can schools, coming in after Harvard, which
had eight recipients.
Additionally, senior Nicole Michele
Krauss from Old Westbury, N.Y., was
named a Marshall Scholar. Established bv

the British government in 1953, the schol
arship provides funding for two years at any
British university.
Krauss plans to enroll at either Oxford or
the University of Sussex and pursue a mas
ter's degree in English literature.
Bechtel International Center Director
John Pearson, a member of the Stanford
Rhodes-Marshall-Churchill Committee,
said he was pleased with the number of
awards.
"This is the most U.S. Rhodes Scholars
we've had since 1985," Pearson said. "This
is the fourth time that we've had three
Rhodes Scholars. We've also had a Marshall
Scholar nearly every year for 16 or 17
years."
The Stanford scholarship selection
process usually begins in January, with a
faculty committee offering small group ses
sions and individual meetings with prospec
tive candidates. The committee then con
ducts campus interviews in the fall to select
candidates for further competition.
"Stanford provides all kinds of re
sources," Foster said. "Over the summer,
they're there to look over your essays and
check your applications. The practice inter
view was really helpful, and they gave you a
lot of feedback. "
