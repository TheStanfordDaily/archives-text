Can Stanford justify the cost of Liberty Bowl?

AMIDST ALL THE hoopla accom
panying Stanford's recent appear
ance in the Liberty Bowl, I think
it is important to step back and ask
some questions about why Stanford
spent an astonishing amount of money
to participate in the game.
According to the Dec. 16 issue of The
San Jose Mercury News, Stanford received
$750,000 for its game. This amount is all
being used to pay the costs associated with
traveling to the game. In addition, as a con
dition of the invitation, Stanford agreed to
purchase 18,000 tickets at $30 apiece. With
two weeks before the game, over 15,000
remained unsold and the University stood
to lose nearly $500,000 unless a generous
booster or two could be found. (Perhaps
such contributions might have been better
directed to scholarships for student ath
letes or other educational priorities.)
This description of Stanford football
finance raised a number of questions for
me. First, how can it cost $750,000 to
travel to the game? Assume that 150
players, coaches, trainers and Stanford
officials make the trip at the Universi
ty's expense. An extremely generous
estimate of the per-person cost might be

$1,000 for airfare, $100 per night for
lodging, $100 per day for food and $100
per day for miscellaneous expenses like
ground transport, athletic tape and
entertainment.
If the team stays in Memphis for five
days and five nights, that multiplies out to
$2,500 per player or coach — an extraor
dinary $375,000 for the whole team.
Who authorized such lavish spending
practices? What is the team spending the
OTHER $375,000 on? Why is it not
given to the University's operating bud
get? How is this revenue drain explained
and tolerated?
Second, why is Stanford willing to pay
$500,000 to participate in the game? By
actively lobbying to participate in a bowl
game — which required an up-front cash
guarantee — Stanford was baldly buying
a bowl bid. This is clearly a commercial
transaction, and it makes a mockery of
the concept of "earning" participation in
postseason play. How can Stanford con
sider itself a home of the truly amateur
scholar athlete when the administration
shops for bowl games? Would the Uni
versity buy a professor membership in
the National Academy of Sciences?

Third, what does this reveal about
institutional priorities? Between the
inflated travel costs and the bulk ticket
purchase, Stanford has spent almost $1
million on the Liberty Bowl, the third
bowl game this decade in six-figures. At a
time when the University is under a
mandate of austerity, this financial waste
is particularly distasteful. This amount
would keep the Food Research Institute
funded for two years. Why are we prac
ticing austerity in the academic and
administrative arenas but profligating
waste in the Department of Athletics?
Fourth, what principles justify these
decisions? According to The Mercury
News, two principles underlie the deci
sion to lose money on Liberty Bowl par
ticipation. For one thing, "the top pro
grams never miss a bowl game." In
other words, everybody else does it. This
didn't impress my mother when I was
five years old. It is not impressive now.
Another reason cited is that players
have to be convinced that good seasons
are rewarded. Universities are not in the
business of manufacturing rewards. A
spectacular athletic season may result in
a championship or a Rose Bowl ring, just

as a brilliant intellectual breakthrough
may be rewarded with the Nobel Prize.
However, most athletes and most aca
demics struggle to achieve their best for
the inherent satisfaction of striving.
Surely each and everyone member of the
Stanford football team derives great sat
isfaction from a season well-played and
from vastly exceeding preseason expecta
tions. Isn't that sufficient?
Neither of these explanations are
based on educational principle. Why
were University spokespersons unable to
find more compelling explanations for
this situation? Is that because there are
simply no good reasons to squander $1
million in the course of playing one foot
ball game?
I am concerned because I see no evi
dence that decisions are being made for
sound, educational principles. In the
midst of all the excitement, we must ask
"Why? At what cost?" and "What aca
demic officers are monitoring and
approving this level of expenditure?"
Am I the only one who is troubled by the
principles and priorities on display here?
