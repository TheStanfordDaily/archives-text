# Stanford plans to open office in Asia
## 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
Keeping in step with Stan
ford's increasing interest in the
Asian community, the Universi
ty has made plans to establish
an Asian Representative Office
and a new diagnostic imaging
center in Singapore.
The two-person office, sched
uled to open early this year, will
act as a contact point for Stan
ford — academically as well as
medically — in the Asian com
munity.
According to James Bair,
program developer for Interna
tional Medical Services for
Stanford Health Services, the
representative office will bring
the medical center and Stanford
in closer contact with Asia.
It will also contain academic
materials for those interested in
Stanford courses, research pro
jects or international exchange
programs.
The office will then be incor
porated with the diagnostic
imaging center in the fall of
1997.
The imaging center is the
product of the combined efforts
of Stanford Health Services
(SHS), the Health Corporation
of Singapore (HCS) and Pontiac
Land Private Ltd., a private
investment company.
"It's a major channel; it
opens the door to so many other
things," said Bair, explaining
why Stanford chose imaging as

its very first foray into the over
seas medical market. "Imaging
is the first and a crucial portion
of modern medicine."
International Medical Ser
vices Director Dale Jensen, SHS
president and CEO Peter Van
Etten and Department of Radi
ology Chair Gary Glazer all
traveled to Singapore in late
November for the signing cere
mony.
Each party will contribute to
the Stanford-HCS Advanced
Imaging Centre in its own way.
SHS will work with the Depart
ment of Radiology to provide
medical and technical expertise
to the center.
HCS, a government-owned
corporation, will administrate
the facility and aid in its inte
gration into the Singapore
health system. The Singapore
government has worked to fur
ther its goal of making the
nation a strong force in medical
technology in the Pacific area.
Pontine Land will develop
and oversee the construction of
the center as well as the Stan
ford Asian Representative
Office.
Until the building is erected,
the representative office will be
located in a different building,
also owned by Pontiac Land.
After the center is completed,
medical personnel will have
telecommunications access to
experts at Stanford. The Univer
sity will also provide new medi
cal equipment to the center.
