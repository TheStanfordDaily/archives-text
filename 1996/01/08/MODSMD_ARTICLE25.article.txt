Prof. Norman Naimark, chair of the Histo
ry Department, was recently honored as the
13th recipient of the Stanford Alumni Associ
ation's Richard W. Lyman Award.
The award is given to faculty members who
go above and beyond their teaching duties in
the classroom.
Naimark has participated in many activi
ties with the Alumni Association, having lead
five travel-study programs and participated in
25, spoken at 16 clubs and regional alumni
meetings and taught summer programs at
Fallen Leaf Lake. Naimark has also spoken at
Sierra Camp for high school students.
A true Stanford product, Naimark gradu
ated in 1966, earned his master's in 1968 and
his doctorate in 1972. Though he taught at
Boston University for 15 years, he returned
to Stanford when offered a job and has stayed
happily ever since. "I love Stanford. I'm a real
patriot," he said.

Naimark said he liked every aspect of being
a professor, but added that "clearly getting to
know students on a longer-term basis is espe
cially rewarding" and having them come back
after graduation and keep in touch is always a
pleasure.
Stanford alumni are generally very inter
ested and well-informed about what is going
on in the world, Naimark said. He admitted
he sometimes wishes people cared more and
knew more, but said he is grateful for those
who are willing to come listen and engage
themselves.
The announcement of the award was first
made at commencement last June. Naimark,
who is Robert and Florence McDonnell Pro
fessor in Eastern European Studies, said he
remembered the shock of discovering the
news when a number of his students called to
congratulate him.
Alumni Association President William
Stone — who has had contact with Naimark
professionally through his volunteer service to

the Alumni Association and personally
because their 10-year old daughters attend the
same elementary school — formally presented
the Lyman Award at a reception Dec. 7.
Stone said Naimark "makes himself avail
able for everyone and tackles whatever is on
people's mind with open-mindedness and
care."
Naimark's knowledge of Bosnia and the
former Yugoslavia makes him "an expert on
an extraordinarily complex issue in a part of
the world that cries out for attention," Stone
said, describing Naimark as a person who
"makes everything make sense" and "a
demystifier of the first order."
Gordon Craig, one of Naimark's former
history professors, echoes this praise. Craig
said Naimark is "greatly admired for his work
and brilliant in analyzing problems."
"Immensely well-regarded and one of
Stanford's true statesmen, Naimark is a truly
wonderful individual we were delighted we
could pay tribute to," Stone said.
