# Men's hoops upends Wildcats
## Cardinal grabs two Pac-10 wins, fifth straight victory 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
| Arizona State 70

Fueled by the return of senior Dion Cross' three
point shot, the Stanford men's basketball team (8-2
overall, 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) snapped a 15-game
losing streak to the No. 9 Arizona Wildcats (10-3,0-2),
pulling out a 80-71 victory in front of an undersized
but vociferous Maples Pavilion crowd last Saturday.
Cross, who had been mired in a season-long
shooting slump, buried seven of 11 three-point shots
on his way to a career-high 30 points. Junior point
guard Brevin Knight added 18 points and 10 assists
while conducting the Cardinal offense like a polished
maestro.
"We really kept our poise," said head coach Mike
Montgomery. "Obviously, it doesn't hurt to have a guy
shoot it like Dion did. Every time we seemingly got
into trouble, we freed up Dion and he got the shot."
Despite facing a mismatch underneath the hoop
with sophomore center Tim Young sidelined bv a
bulging disk in his back, Stanford managed to outre
bound Arizona 37-36. The Wildcats' big two of Ben
Davis (6-foot-8, 240 pounds) and Joseph Blair (6-10,

265) never established a consistent
presence down low against the Car
dinal sharpshooters.
Overall, Stanford made 11 of 23
shots behind the arc but only hit 10
of 35 attempts from two-point
range. Nonetheless, the Arizona
contest was by far the best outside
shooting performance for the Car
dinal this year.
Arizona opened in a 1-1-3 zone
and then moved to a box-and-one
defense to concentrate on shutting
down Knight, which surprised
Montgomery. However, unlike ear
lier in the season, the open outside
shots against the zone were falling
for Stanford and the Wildcats
switched to man-to-man with five
minutes remaining in the first half.
"I think they were just trying to
put the clamps on Brevin and it
backfired," Cross said. "Earlier in
the season, we would second-guess
ourselves against the zone because
we didn't know what to do. [Against
Arizona] we had good ball move
ment and weren't stagnant."
After trading leads twice in the
first four minutes, the Cardinal
jumped ahead for good on two free
throws by Knight. Stanford's floor
general then made everyone's heart
jump into their throats when he
came down from an attempted
block of a Reggie Geary shot
screaming in pain.
"I didn't want to look down,
because I knew it would be ugly,"
he said. "I tried to dribble, but I
couldn't feel a thing."
It turned out to be a dislocated
left index finger and Knight

returned to the game five minutes
later. While Knight taped his fin
gers, his replacement, freshman
Arthur Lee, knocked down a three
pointer and kept the Stanford show
running in the interim.
Although Arizona outshot Stan
ford 49.1 percent to 36.2 percent,
t he Cardinal made up for the differ
ence by outhustling Arizona and
forcing the Wildcats into 19
turnovers. Geary and Miles Simon
committed 10 turnovers between
the two of them as they failed to
break Knight's stranglehold on the
game's tempo.
"Our game plan was to keep
Knight out of the lane, make Dion
shoot off-balance and keep them off
the free-throw line and we didn't do
any of those," said Arizona head
coach Lute Olson.
Stanford went 27-of-36 from the
free-throw line, outscoring the Wild
cats by 15 points from the stripe.
One sequence in the second half
stood out as vintage Knight, as he
made a circus shot in the lane but
was called for an offensive charge.
Knight responded by lurking
around halfcourt as Blair lazily
inbounded the ball to Simon by
rolling it on the floor. Knight
swooped in, corralled the ball
before Simon and Blair knew what
happened and hit a reverse lay-in
off the glass. The Maples crowd
roared as Stanford pushed its lead
to 57-48 with just under nine min
utes to play.
More importantly, the Cardinal
was able to answer every Wildcat
basket with a hoop of its own. The
Wildcats managed to score back-to
back buckets only four times in the
game.
"This has been a long time com
ing with us," Montgomery said.

"We didn't make a whole lot of care
less mistakes, worked real hard and
stayed patient."
Fittingly, Stanford's four seniors
(Cross, Andy Poppink, David Har
bour and Darren Allaway) were on
the court together along with
Knight for the final two minutes,
55 seconds of the game. This group
of players, who had come so close to
beating Arizona over the past three
years, finally emerged with a win
over the Wildcats.
Last Thursday, Stanford opened
its Pac-10 season with an 83-70 win
over Arizona State. Poppink tied a
career-high with 25 points while
Harbour scored 22 and grabbed
eight rebounds. Harbour, who
moved into the starting lineup
when Young went down, has aver
aged six more points as a starter
(11.8 points per game) than as the
sixth man (5.8).
Other wins in Stanford's recent
five-game winning streak include a
80-62 victory at Navy and home
wins over American and Harvard
by scores of 80-52 and 65-59 respec
tively.
Poppink shouldered most of the
offensive burden over the four
games before Arizona, averaging
19.5 points and 7.3 rebounds per
contest. Knight also played well,
especially against Harvard, pouring
in 26 points, all in the second half.
As for Young, the coaching staff
remains unsure whether the 7-foot
-1 center will return this year. He
has played five games, the maxi
mum allowed if a player wishes to
take a medical redshirt year. If his
back does not improve over the next
week or two, expect Young to sit out
the rest of the year and return next
year with three years of eligibility
leR.

sixth man (5.8).
Other wins in Stanford's recent
five-game winning streak include a
80-62 victory at Navy and home
wins over American and Harvard
by scores of 80-52 and 65-59 respec

Poppink shouldered most of the
offensive burden over the four
games before Arizona, averaging
19.5 points and 7.3 rebounds per
contest. Knight also played well,
especially against Harvard, pouring
in 26 points, all in the second half.
As for Young, the coaching staff
remains unsure whether the 7-foot
-1 center will return this year. He
has played five games, the maxi
mum allowed if a player wishes to
take a medical redshirt year. If his

week or two, expect Young to sit out
the rest of the year and return next
year with three years of eligibility

Junior Dion Cross launches one of his 11 three-point attempts
against Arizona last Saturday.
| Arizona State 70

Fueled by the return of senior Dion Cross' three
point shot, the Stanford men's basketball team (8-2
overall, 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) snapped a 15-game
losing streak to the No. 9 Arizona Wildcats (10-3,0-2),
pulling out a 80-71 victory in front of an undersized
but vociferous Maples Pavilion crowd last Saturday.
Cross, who had been mired in a season-long
shooting slump, buried seven of 11 three-point shots
on his way to a career-high 30 points. Junior point
guard Brevin Knight added 18 points and 10 assists
while conducting the Cardinal offense like a polished
maestro.
"We really kept our poise," said head coach Mike
Montgomery. "Obviously, it doesn't hurt to have a guy
shoot it like Dion did. Every time we seemingly got
into trouble, we freed up Dion and he got the shot."
Despite facing a mismatch underneath the hoop
with sophomore center Tim Young sidelined bv a
bulging disk in his back, Stanford managed to outre
bound Arizona 37-36. The Wildcats' big two of Ben
Davis (6-foot-8, 240 pounds) and Joseph Blair (6-10,

despite its game plan.
265) never established a consistent
presence down low against the Car
dinal sharpshooters.
Overall, Stanford made 11 of 23
shots behind the arc but only hit 10
of 35 attempts from two-point
range. Nonetheless, the Arizona
contest was by far the best outside
shooting performance for the Car
dinal this year.
Arizona opened in a 1-1-3 zone
and then moved to a box-and-one
defense to concentrate on shutting
down Knight, which surprised
Montgomery. However, unlike ear
lier in the season, the open outside
shots against the zone were falling
for Stanford and the Wildcats
switched to man-to-man with five
minutes remaining in the first half.
"I think they were just trying to
put the clamps on Brevin and it
backfired," Cross said. "Earlier in
the season, we would second-guess
ourselves against the zone because
we didn't know what to do. [Against
Arizona] we had good ball move
ment and weren't stagnant."
After trading leads twice in the
first four minutes, the Cardinal
jumped ahead for good on two free
throws by Knight. Stanford's floor
general then made everyone's heart
jump into their throats when he
came down from an attempted
block of a Reggie Geary shot
screaming in pain.
"I didn't want to look down,
because I knew it would be ugly,"
he said. "I tried to dribble, but I
couldn't feel a thing."
It turned out to be a dislocated
left index finger and Knight

returned to the game five minutes
later. While Knight taped his fin
gers, his replacement, freshman
Arthur Lee, knocked down a three
pointer and kept the Stanford show
running in the interim.
Although Arizona outshot Stan
ford 49.1 percent to 36.2 percent,
t he Cardinal made up for the differ
ence by outhustling Arizona and
forcing the Wildcats into 19
turnovers. Geary and Miles Simon
committed 10 turnovers between
the two of them as they failed to
break Knight's stranglehold on the
game's tempo.
"Our game plan was to keep
Knight out of the lane, make Dion
shoot off-balance and keep them off
the free-throw line and we didn't do
any of those," said Arizona head
coach Lute Olson.
Stanford went 27-of-36 from the
free-throw line, outscoring the Wild
cats by 15 points from the stripe.
One sequence in the second half
stood out as vintage Knight, as he
made a circus shot in the lane but
was called for an offensive charge.
Knight responded by lurking
around halfcourt as Blair lazily
inbounded the ball to Simon by
rolling it on the floor. Knight
swooped in, corralled the ball
before Simon and Blair knew what
happened and hit a reverse lay-in
off the glass. The Maples crowd
roared as Stanford pushed its lead
to 57-48 with just under nine min
utes to play.
More importantly, the Cardinal
was able to answer every Wildcat
basket with a hoop of its own. The
Wildcats managed to score back-to
back buckets only four times in the
game.
"This has been a long time com
ing with us," Montgomery said.

"We didn't make a whole lot of care
less mistakes, worked real hard and
stayed patient."
Fittingly, Stanford's four seniors
(Cross, Andy Poppink, David Har
bour and Darren Allaway) were on
the court together along with
Knight for the final two minutes,
55 seconds of the game. This group
of players, who had come so close to
beating Arizona over the past three
years, finally emerged with a win
over the Wildcats.
Last Thursday, Stanford opened
its Pac-10 season with an 83-70 win
over Arizona State. Poppink tied a
career-high with 25 points while
Harbour scored 22 and grabbed
eight rebounds. Harbour, who
moved into the starting lineup
when Young went down, has aver
aged six more points as a starter
(11.8 points per game) than as the
sixth man (5.8).
Other wins in Stanford's recent
five-game winning streak include a
80-62 victory at Navy and home
wins over American and Harvard
by scores of 80-52 and 65-59 respec
tively.
Poppink shouldered most of the
offensive burden over the four
games before Arizona, averaging
19.5 points and 7.3 rebounds per
contest. Knight also played well,
especially against Harvard, pouring
in 26 points, all in the second half.
As for Young, the coaching staff
remains unsure whether the 7-foot
-1 center will return this year. He
has played five games, the maxi
mum allowed if a player wishes to
take a medical redshirt year. If his
back does not improve over the next
week or two, expect Young to sit out
the rest of the year and return next
