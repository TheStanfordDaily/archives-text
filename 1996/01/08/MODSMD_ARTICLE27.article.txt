It was a rough weekend for Arizona basketball.
Sparked by junior Kate Starbird's 20 first-half
points, the seventh-ranked Stanford women (9-2
overall 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) rolled to an easy
77-55 victory over Arizona (9-1, 1-1) Saturday night
at the McKale Center, handing the Wildcats their
first loss of the season and completing a road sweep

of the Arizona schools. In Thursday's Pac-10 open
er, the Cardinal clobbered Arizona State 88-71 in
Tempe. Arizona and ASU (4-7, 0-2) went a com
bined 0-for-4 against Stanford basketball on the
week.
Tm used to seeing this type of performance from
Kate," said Stanford coach Amy Tucker of Starbird,
who finished with '27 points against Arizona and
became Stanford's 19th career 1,000-point scorer.
"She's been slighted nationally. I don't believe there
are 10 better players than her in the country."
Stanford opponents have certainly had their
hands full trying to contain Starbird the past few
weeks. The star guard / forward averaged 19.8
points over winter break, including a 26-point per
formance in the Cardinal's 90-72 upset of then-No.
2 Tennessee on Dec. 16. The Cardinal went 6-1 over
the holidays, its only blemish a 71-65 loss to No. 10
Texas Tech on Dec. 28.
Starbird was once again in top
form during the Arizona contest, a
game in which Stanford competed
without three of its top six players.
Starting point guard Jamila Wide
man missed the game with a
sprained right ankle, starting small
forward Bobbie Kelsey was out
with a sprained right knee, and
sophomore forward Heather Owen,
one of the first women off the
bench, sat out with a stress reaction
in her left foot. Not to be denied,
however, the Cardinal opened the
game with an 8-0 run mid never
looked back.
"We knew the key was coming
out right away," Tucker said.
"They had no flow. The first five
minutes were demoralizing."
If the first five minutes were
demoralizing, the rest of the half
was back-breaking. Starbird's
three-pointer with four minutes, 15
seconds remaining in the first half
capped a 10-0 run that brought
Stanford's lead to 36-14. Arizona
shot a dismal 26 percent from the
field in the half, making only seven
of 27 shots as the Cardinal raced
out to a 44-20 advantage at inter
mission.
The Wildcats made a run in the
second half, rattling off 12 unan
swered points to pull within 58-40

with just under 10 minutes to play,
but that was as close as they would
get.
"Maybe, all-around, it was one of
my best," said Starbird of her per
formance, which also included five
rebounds and four assists. Other
key contributions came from
sophomores Vanessa Nygaard and
Olympia Scott, who added 13 points
apiece, and Naomi Mulitauaopele,
who chipped in 11.
"Stanford had experience and
poise," said Arizona coach Joan
Bonvicini. "This was our first big
test and we were intimidated more
than anything."
Intimidation may have also
played a role in the Cardinal's 17-
point rout of Arizona State. Fueled
by Starbird's 19 first-half points,
Stanford took control from the
outset, taking a 47-36 halftime
lead en route to the 88-71 victory.
Nygaard drained five of nine three
point attempts and shot 71 percent
to finish with a game-high 26
points, while Mulitauaopele
chalked up 19 points and 12
rebounds. The Cardinal has now
taken seven straight and 16 of 17
from the Sun Devils.
Thursday's and Saturday's wins
may have provided a confidence
boost while lifting Stanford to a 2-0
start in Pac-10 play, but the high
light of the Cardinal's holiday cam
paign came three weeks ago on Dec.
16, just a day after most students
had left campus for winter break.
That night, the Cardinal, ranked

ninth at the time, delivered an 18-
point thumping of then-No. 2 Ten
nessee before 6,390 at Maples
Pavilion. Starbird posted 26 points,
Mulitauaopele poured in 23, and
the Cardinal led by as many as 28 as
the Volunteers suffered their
first loss of the year in the stunning
90-72 victory.

Stanford's surprising perfor
mance against Tennessee vaulted
the Cardinal to the No. 4 slot in the
Associated Press poll, a spot it
retained while winning its ninth
straight Fry's / Cardinal Classic
Dec. 19-20. On the first night of the
invite, Stanford set a new tourna
ment standard with a 105-47
butchering of Cal State-Sacramen
to. The 58-point drubbing was the
largest margin of victory in the
event's 10-year history. Nygaard
was a perfect 4-of-4 from beyond
the three-point arc and amassed 19
total points to lead six players in
double figures.

The tournament final was a dif
ferent story, however, as No. 25
Auburn (then unranked) held the
Cardinal to just 63 points, Stan
ford's lowest total of the year.
Nonetheless, Stanford played
stingy defense and Starbird paced
the offense with 19 points to lift the
Cardinal to a hard-fought 63-44 vic
tory.
Stanford's only loss of the break
caine on Dec. 28 when the Cardinal
traveled to then-No. 15 Texas Tech,
only to be shot down 71-65. The
Cardinal shot just 31 percent from
the field and was outrebounded 23-
16 in the first half while spotting
the Red ladders a 33-26 lead. The
Cardinal stayed close in the second
half but was held scoreless over the
last 4:19. Starbird was a horrid 4-
for-20 from the field, scoring only
nine points.
"We were outplayed, outworked
and outhustled," Tucker said. "We
never shot well against that zone.
Kate Starbird, I promise you, will
never go 4-for-20 again in her life."
The Cardinal rebounded two
nights later with a 72-68 win at
Texas, but it wasn't easy. Stanford
made just one of 10 from three
point land and allowed the Lady
Longhorns to build a 32-25 half
time lead. But the Cardinal finally
found its rhythm in the second
half, burying 20 of 31 while over
coming the seven-point deficit.
Starbird scored 17, and Muli
tauaopele, Scott and Wideman
added 13 in the win.

"She's been slighted nationally. I don't believe there
are 10 better players than her in the country."
Stanford opponents have certainly had their
hands full trying to contain Starbird the past few
weeks. The star guard / forward averaged 19.8
points over winter break, including a 26-point per
formance in the Cardinal's 90-72 upset of then-No.
2 Tennessee on Dec. 16. The Cardinal went 6-1 over
the holidays, its only blemish a 71-65 loss to No. 10
Texas Tech on Dec. 28.
Starbird was once again in top
form during the Arizona contest, a
game in which Stanford competed
without three of its top six players.
Starting point guard Jamila Wide
man missed the game with a
sprained right ankle, starting small
forward Bobbie Kelsey was out
with a sprained right knee, and
sophomore forward Heather Owen,
one of the first women off the
bench, sat out with a stress reaction
in her left foot. Not to be denied,
however, the Cardinal opened the
game with an 8-0 run mid never
looked back.
"We knew the key was coming
out right away," Tucker said.
"They had no flow. The first five
minutes were demoralizing."
If the first five minutes were
demoralizing, the rest of the half
was back-breaking. Starbird's
three-pointer with four minutes, 15
seconds remaining in the first half
capped a 10-0 run that brought
Stanford's lead to 36-14. Arizona
shot a dismal 26 percent from the
field in the half, making only seven
of 27 shots as the Cardinal raced
out to a 44-20 advantage at inter
mission.
The Wildcats made a run in the
second half, rattling off 12 unan
swered points to pull within 58-40

with just under 10 minutes to play,
but that was as close as they would
get.
"Maybe, all-around, it was one of
my best," said Starbird of her per
formance, which also included five
rebounds and four assists. Other
key contributions came from
sophomores Vanessa Nygaard and
Olympia Scott, who added 13 points
apiece, and Naomi Mulitauaopele,
who chipped in 11.
"Stanford had experience and
poise," said Arizona coach Joan
Bonvicini. "This was our first big
test and we were intimidated more
than anything."
Intimidation may have also
played a role in the Cardinal's 17-
point rout of Arizona State. Fueled
by Starbird's 19 first-half points,
Stanford took control from the
outset, taking a 47-36 halftime
lead en route to the 88-71 victory.
Nygaard drained five of nine three
point attempts and shot 71 percent
to finish with a game-high 26
points, while Mulitauaopele
chalked up 19 points and 12
rebounds. The Cardinal has now
taken seven straight and 16 of 17
from the Sun Devils.
Thursday's and Saturday's wins
may have provided a confidence
boost while lifting Stanford to a 2-0
start in Pac-10 play, but the high
light of the Cardinal's holiday cam
paign came three weeks ago on Dec.
16, just a day after most students
had left campus for winter break.
That night, the Cardinal, ranked

ninth at the time, delivered an 18-
point thumping of then-No. 2 Ten
nessee before 6,390 at Maples
Pavilion. Starbird posted 26 points,
Mulitauaopele poured in 23, and
the Cardinal led by as many as 28 as
the Volunteers suffered their
first loss of the year in the stunning
90-72 victory.

Stanford's surprising perfor
mance against Tennessee vaulted
the Cardinal to the No. 4 slot in the
Associated Press poll, a spot it
retained while winning its ninth
straight Fry's / Cardinal Classic
Dec. 19-20. On the first night of the
invite, Stanford set a new tourna
ment standard with a 105-47
butchering of Cal State-Sacramen
to. The 58-point drubbing was the
largest margin of victory in the
event's 10-year history. Nygaard
was a perfect 4-of-4 from beyond
the three-point arc and amassed 19
total points to lead six players in
double figures.

The tournament final was a dif
ferent story, however, as No. 25
Auburn (then unranked) held the
Cardinal to just 63 points, Stan
ford's lowest total of the year.
Nonetheless, Stanford played
stingy defense and Starbird paced
the offense with 19 points to lift the
Cardinal to a hard-fought 63-44 vic
tory.
Stanford's only loss of the break
caine on Dec. 28 when the Cardinal
traveled to then-No. 15 Texas Tech,
only to be shot down 71-65. The
Cardinal shot just 31 percent from
the field and was outrebounded 23-
16 in the first half while spotting
the Red ladders a 33-26 lead. The
Cardinal stayed close in the second
half but was held scoreless over the
last 4:19. Starbird was a horrid 4-
for-20 from the field, scoring only
nine points.
"We were outplayed, outworked
and outhustled," Tucker said. "We
never shot well against that zone.
Kate Starbird, I promise you, will
never go 4-for-20 again in her life."
The Cardinal rebounded two
nights later with a 72-68 win at
Texas, but it wasn't easy. Stanford
made just one of 10 from three
point land and allowed the Lady
Longhorns to build a 32-25 half
time lead. But the Cardinal finally
found its rhythm in the second
half, burying 20 of 31 while over
coming the seven-point deficit.
Starbird scored 17, and Muli
tauaopele, Scott and Wideman
added 13 in the win.

It was a rough weekend for Arizona basketball.
Sparked by junior Kate Starbird's 20 first-half
points, the seventh-ranked Stanford women (9-2
overall 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) rolled to an easy
77-55 victory over Arizona (9-1, 1-1) Saturday night
at the McKale Center, handing the Wildcats their
first loss of the season and completing a road sweep

of the Arizona schools. In Thursday's Pac-10 open
er, the Cardinal clobbered Arizona State 88-71 in
Tempe. Arizona and ASU (4-7, 0-2) went a com
bined 0-for-4 against Stanford basketball on the
week.
