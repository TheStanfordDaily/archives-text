On paper, No. 3 Stanford
boasted the deepest and most
talented women's volleyball
team in the NCAA tournament.
As the Cardinal found out in
Amherst, Mass. during winter
break, however, tournament
matches don't take place on
paper.
In a stunning upset that
ended Stanford's dream of
repeating as national champions,
the No. 5 Texas Lady Longhorns
defeated the Cardinal in five
games in the second national
semifinal match played at the
Mullins Center on the UMass
campus, prevailing 15-13, 0-15,
15-17, 15-6, 15-12. Texas had
beaten an injury-plagued Stan
ford squad in five games earlier
in the 1995 campaign.
"We had too many hitting
errors," said a dejected coach
Don Shaw after the contest.
"I'm surprised it got to five
games. We couldn't keep the
ball in the court."
Though the Lady Longhorns
executed well, Stanford errors
determined the outcome of the
match. AH told, the Cardinal
committed 40 hitting errors
compared to only 19 for Texas.
"We terminated better than
them (97 kills for Stanford com
pared to 68 for Texas)," Shaw
said, "but 40 errors to 19 is a
bad statistic for us."
Ironically, it was the defend
ing national champion that dis
played signs of nervousness in
the first game of the match. In
game one, the Cardinal had 12
errors to go with 24 kills, leaving
Stanford with just a .203 hitting
percentage. Texas, meanwhile,
performed solidly, committing
only six errors to hit .292.
Stanford jumped to a 3-0 lead
before Texas capitalized on
three Cardinal hitting errors to
tie the game. The teams traded

points from that juncture, with
neither team able to build an
advantage greater than two
points. After Stanford took a 13-
11 lead off a kill by sophomore
setter / outside hitter Lisa
Sharpley, the Lady Longhorns
scored the next four points to
break the Cardinal's 39-game
winning streak. Stanford had
not lost a game since losing the
first game of a four-game victo
rv over USC on Oct. 22.

"We had so many opportuni
ties, but we didn't take advan
tage of them," Shaw said. "Then
we got too careful and didn't
play with our normal abandon."
For a few brief moment s, Stan
ford's aggressive style emerged.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
however, those moments were
confined to game two. In that
game, Stanford was at its unstop

pable best, tossing the first shutout
in NCAA semifinal history. The 15-0
triumph was Stanford's first shutout
since its third match of the season
;»gainst Eastern Michigan. The Lady
lionghorns had not been shutout
since Nov. 5,1982 against Hawaii.
Stanford received a spark in
game two from senior outside hit
ter Marnie Triefenbach, who
replaced senior outside hitter
Wendy Hromadka. Hromadka
registered just three kills and hit
.091. She never fully recovered
from a wrist fracture suffered in
pre-tournament practice.
Triefenbach, on the other hand,
struggled all season after begin
ning the year with nagging leg
injuries. Against Texas, though,
she returned with a vengeance,
exciting the 6,932 in attendance
with the thunderous kills that
made her a Maples Pavilion crowd
favorite. For the match, Triefen
bach finished with 16 kills, 15 digs
and a .317 hitting percentage.

"Mamie's done well off the
bench this season," Shaw said.
'Anytime Wendy's been hurt or
struggling, we've been able to get
good passing and strong hitting
from her."
The game began with Stanford
slowly amassing a 2-0 lead. Then,
with sophomore outside hitter
Kristin Folkl serving, the Cardi
nal scored three consecutive
points to jump ahead 5-0. After
each team recorded one sideout,
sophomore middle blocker Bar
bara Ifejika went back to serve
and the Cardinal exploded. Ifeji
ka's serve netted eight unan
swered points, giving Stanford an
insurmountable 13-0 edge. The
run was highlighted by three kills
each from Triefenbach and junior
middle blocker Eileen Murfee.
Two token sideouts from Texas
only delayed the inevitable, as two
Triefenbach jump serves allowed
Stanford to score two quick
points and close out the game.
"With the exception of game
two, we were sub-par and they
were excellent," Shaw said.
Stanford hit .600 in game two,
collecting 15 kills in 25 attempts.

More importantly, the Cardinal
committed no errors in the game.
"I'm really proud of our team,"
said Texas coach Mick Haley. "We
got be .t 15-0 and didn't let our
selves get embarrassed."
Haley credited his All-American
senior setter Carrie Busch for
keeping her teammates composed
the rest of the match. "| After game
two] I was just thinking that we
should get over it and get on with
the next game," he said. "It went
by so fast that we just forgot about
it and came out (in game three)
strong and confident."
The errors that haunted the
Cardinal in game one returned in
game three, forcing Stanford to
come from behind during much of
the game. Six errors in the game's
early stages helped Texas grab a 5-
0 lead. The Cardinal then seemed
to right itself, scoring six of the
next eight points to pull within
one at 7-6. Just as quickly, howev
er, three straight Stanford errors
left the Cardinal behind 10-6.
As it has done all season long,
Stanford responded by scoring
five points in a row to take its first
lead at 11-10. After a brief lapse
allowed the Lady Longhorns to
post four straight points, the Car
dinal staved off three game points
before scoring six of the final
seven points to pull out a 17-15
victory. The emotional game tied
a record for the most total points
in an NCAA semifinal game.
Despite winning the game,
Stanford's hitting percentage was
just .240 due to 12 hitting errors.
The errors negated much of Stan
ford's 32-18 advantage in kills.
Texas bounced back from the
disappointing loss in game three
to thoroughly dominate the Car
dinal in game four. The 15-6 score
marked the widest margin by
which Stanford lost a game this
season. The Lady Longhorns held
the Cardinal to a . 143 hitting per
centage, again getting help from
14 Stanford errors.
By game four, it had become
evident that Texas had found a
way to frustrate Stanford's potent
offense. Using short serves to
cause passing mistakes, the Lady
Longhorns used their size and a
tightly organized blocking scheme
to thwart Stanford hitters.
"Their short serves hurt us,"
Shaw said. "Though we try to
play a tough schedule, we really
hadn't seen a team that big in a
month and a half."
The Texas comeback meant that
the match would be decided by a
rally-scored fifth game. Fort he first
half of the game, the teams traded
points by simply siding out . At 6-6,
though, thel.H<lv I>mghorns began
to pull away, scoring three of the
next four points to take a 10-7 lead

Stanford tried to come back, scoring
two straight points, but a kill from
Texas freshman All-American
Demetria Sance and an error from
Stanford's senior setter / outside
hitter and co-national player of the
year Cary Wendell built the lead
back to 12-9. Though Stanford
would pull to within 13-12, a kill
from Busch left the score 14-12. Fit
tingly, the match ended on Folkl's
team-high 11t h hitting error.
"Fifth games are never fun,"
Murfee said. "We thrive on the
competition, but we got beat."
"Siding out is so important in
fifth games," Wendell said. "A
couple of mistakes and you're
down big."
Shaw used the loss to continue
his critique of the rally score sys
tem. "I'm not just saying this
because I'm sitting here the loser,
but I don't like rally scoring," he
said. "Its not fair to the players
and that's who we're playing the
gntvie for."
Stanford hit only .138 in game
five, accumulating nine hitting

errors in the abbreviated game.
Texas, on the other hand, was at
its best, hitting .455 in the
match's final game without post
ing a single hitting error.
The Lady Longhorns went on
to lose the NCAA Final match to
Nebraska, a team whose only loss
came at the hands of the Cardinal
in the second match of the season
for both teams. Meanwhile, Stan
ford reflected upon a dominant
season that fell two matches
short of a championship.
In addition to Triefenbach's
performance, Stanford's most
outstanding player in the semifi
nal was Murfee, who hit .529
while totaling a career-high 20
kills. Folkl's 21 digs were also a
career-best.
To reach the Final Four, Stan
ford crushed an Oral Roberts team
that took a Cinderella ride to the
regional Final. After beating third
seeded Washington State and fifth
seeded Notre l)nrr\e,-( >ml-Hnborts
had nothing left for the Cardinal.
Stanford won 15-4, 15-7, 15-4.

"We played pretty darn well,"
Shaw said. "We respected them
and came out ready to play. Give
them credit for bringing out the
best in us — they just didn't have
the firepower to match up well."
In the regional semifinal, Stan
ford got a little more competition
from USC before winning 15-6,
15-12, 15-8. Stanford hit .405 in
that match, committed only 16
errors and got 18 kills and 11 digs
from regional MVP Folkl.
Despite dominating the Women
of Troy, Stanford couldn't stop
second-team AU-American Kelly
Kuebler for the third consecutive
time. Kuebler, a 6-foot-0 outside
hitter from Los Alamitos, Calif.,
garnered 18 kills and hit .382.
"She's an outstanding player,"
Shaw said. "It's easy to see why
she's an AU-American. We knew
exactly what she was going to do,
and we had our players ready and
in the right position, and she beat
us anyway. She's a phenomenal
talent and she's been tremendous
against us."
