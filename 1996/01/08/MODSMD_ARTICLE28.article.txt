On paper, No. 3 Stanford
boasted the deepest and most
talented women's volleyball
team in the NCAA tournament.
As the Cardinal found out in
Amherst, Mass. during winter
break, however, tournament
matches don't take place on
paper.
In a stunning upset that
ended Stanford's dream of
repeating as national champions,
the No. 5 Texas Lady Longhorns
defeated the Cardinal in five
games in the second national
semifinal match played at the
Mullins Center on the UMass
campus, prevailing 15-13, 0-15,
15-17, 15-6, 15-12. Texas had
beaten an injury-plagued Stan
ford squad in five games earlier
in the 1995 campaign.
"We had too many hitting
errors," said a dejected coach
Don Shaw after the contest.
"I'm surprised it got to five
games. We couldn't keep the
ball in the court."
Though the Lady Longhorns
executed well, Stanford errors
determined the outcome of the
match. AH told, the Cardinal
committed 40 hitting errors
compared to only 19 for Texas.
"We terminated better than
them (97 kills for Stanford com
pared to 68 for Texas)," Shaw
said, "but 40 errors to 19 is a
bad statistic for us."
Ironically, it was the defend
ing national champion that dis
played signs of nervousness in
the first game of the match. In
game one, the Cardinal had 12
errors to go with 24 kills, leaving
Stanford with just a .203 hitting
percentage. Texas, meanwhile,
performed solidly, committing
only six errors to hit .292.
Stanford jumped to a 3-0 lead
before Texas capitalized on
three Cardinal hitting errors to
tie the game. The teams traded

points from that juncture, with
neither team able to build an
advantage greater than two
points. After Stanford took a 13-
11 lead off a kill by sophomore
setter / outside hitter Lisa
Sharpley, the Lady Longhorns
scored the next four points to
break the Cardinal's 39-game
winning streak. Stanford had
not lost a game since losing the
first game of a four-game victo
rv over USC on Oct. 22.

"We had so many opportuni
ties, but we didn't take advan
tage of them," Shaw said. "Then
we got too careful and didn't
play with our normal abandon."
For a few brief moment s, Stan
ford's aggressive style emerged.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
however, those moments were
confined to game two. In that
game, Stanford was at its unstop
