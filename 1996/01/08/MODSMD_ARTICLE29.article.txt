Women's Basketball
With a 9-2 overall record
and a 2-0 mark in the Pac
-10, the Stanford women's
basketball team are now
preparing to do battle with
their conference foes in
anticipation of the NCAA
tournament in March. But
they'll be doing it without
the assistance of sophomore
phenom Kristin Folkl, a two
sport athlete who was named
volleyball's Freshman of the
Year last season in leading
Stanford to an NCAA title.
Over winter break, Folkl
announced her intentions to
stop out for the next two
quarters in order to play
with the U.S. National Vol
leyball Team in hopes of
making the Olympic Team
next summer.
"Yes, basketball is still in
the future for me,"Folkl
said. "But right now, it's
hard for me to project any
thing too far in the future. I
still love basketball, but I'm
not sure I want to commit to
anything at this moment."
"In truth, this decision is
no surprise," said Amy
Tucker. "She had indicated
to us all along that she would
very likely not return to the
basketball team this year.
"But we're certainly going
to leave the door open for
her. She can return whenev
er she likes."
