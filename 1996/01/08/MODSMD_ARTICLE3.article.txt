# Early admits get the nod
## 301 accepted in first phase of new program 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
More than 300 high school seniors re
ceived a pre-holiday present last month —
news that they are members of the Stan
ford Class of 2000.
The Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions sent "the big envelope" to 301 stu
dents on Dec. 15, inaugurating the first of
its two-part early decision program.
"I am thrilled to be going to Stanford,"
said Ashley Holt, a senior at nearby Menlo

Atherton High School
who was accepted in the
Early Decision I selec
tion process.
This is the first year
that Stanford has had
an early admission
process, and the Admis
sions Office said it was
pleased with the Early
Decision I candidates.

"The quality and quantity of the early
decision pool is well beyond our expecta

tions," said James Montoya, Dean of Un
dergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid.
"What is clear is that in no way have we
had to compromise on the academic cal
iber of students in admitting our first
early decision class. In fact, the early deci
sion class we admitted this December is
stronger than any freshman class admit
ted to the University in all previous
years," Montoya said.


Montoya
More than 1,000 students
applied for Early Decision I, which
required completed applications by
Nov. 1 and is binding.
In the second early decision
selection, students applied by the
normal Dec. 15 deadline, but accep
tance is binding. The Admissions
Office received 2,084 applications
for the Early Decision II program
and will mail responses next month.
The Committee on Undergradu
ate Admissions and Financial Aids
recommended the early decision
option in 1994 as a method to
increase the percentage of students
who accept admittance.
"I was psyched when they added
the early decision option," said

Susie Cranston, a senior at Lick
Wilmerding High School in San
Francisco who was accepted last
month. Part of acceptance is the
admissions officers saying, 'Do we
think this kid will go here?'" said
Cranston.
Montoya said he expects the
early decision programs will
increase the yield of students
enrolling.
"I had expected that we would
receive 2,000 applicants in the early
decision programs combined," Mon
toya said. "Then later I predicted a
total of 2,200, but we have received
over 3,000 applications for the early
decision programs."
Originally, Montoya said, the
office planned to admit between 25
and 30 percent of the freshman
class in the early admission pro
grams, but because of the number
and strength of the applicants, more

than 35 percent of the Class of 2000
may already be admitted.
One of the reasons Stanford
refrained from early decision pro
grams until now, Montoya said, is
that the Admissions Office felt high
school students were not in a posi
tion to select a university during the
first semester of their senior year.
"What we are seeing are stu
dents and parents beginning the
college selection process earlier. It is
not unusual to meet with parents of
sophomores at college fairs," Mon
toya said. "Our programs need to
provide the opportunity for admis
sion to students who are ready to
make the decision early and to those
who are not."
Despite the large number of
early acceptances, Montoya wants
to be careful what kind of message
he is sending to high school seniors.
"I think that it presents a delicate

balance — we do not want to say
that in order to get in, you must
apply early, because many students
aren't in a position to do that," said
Montoya.
"At the same time, I don't want
to deny students admission who we
know we would like to have enroll
because we are limiting ourselves to
35 percent," he added.
More than 90 percent of the
admitted students are in the top
tenth of their high school classes.
More than half of the students have
a perfect 4.0 grade point average.
Forty-three percent of students
admitted under early decision are
from California, while New York,
Oregon, Texas, Pennsylvania and
Maryland each have at least 10 stu
dents among them. The Admissions
Office predicts that the total appli
cant pool will be about 16,000, the
largest since 1985.
