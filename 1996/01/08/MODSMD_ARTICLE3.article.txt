# Early admits get the nod
## 301 accepted in first phase of new program 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
More than 300 high school seniors re
ceived a pre-holiday present last month â€”
news that they are members of the Stan
ford Class of 2000.
The Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions sent "the big envelope" to 301 stu
dents on Dec. 15, inaugurating the first of
its two-part early decision program.
"I am thrilled to be going to Stanford,"
said Ashley Holt, a senior at nearby Menlo

Atherton High School
who was accepted in the
Early Decision I selec
tion process.
This is the first year
that Stanford has had
an early admission
process, and the Admis
sions Office said it was
pleased with the Early
Decision I candidates.

"The quality and quantity of the early
decision pool is well beyond our expecta

tions," said James Montoya, Dean of Un
dergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid.
"What is clear is that in no way have we
had to compromise on the academic cal
iber of students in admitting our first
early decision class. In fact, the early deci
sion class we admitted this December is
stronger than any freshman class admit
ted to the University in all previous
years," Montoya said.
