# Alum starts newspaper in Palo Alto
## 
### Richard Engel 
When the Peninsula Times Tri
bune folded in 1993, many viewed
it as the death knell for any daily
newspaper in Palo Alto.
But a recent graduate of Stan
ford's Graduate School of Business
is attempting to prove the skeptics
wrong with a school project turned
real-life experiment. Alumnus
Dave Danforth is trying to bring
back local coverage to a town he
calls "the capital city of the Penin
sula." So, with two others, Dan
forth started the Palo Alto Daily
News last month.

In his second year at the Busi
ness School, Danforth — who has
also founded a local newspaper in
Colorado — drafted a business
plan for a new newspaper in Palo
Alto. Peer Wendel, a lecturer in
entrepreneurship and venture cap
ital and founder of Sierra Ven
tures, liked the idea and encour
aged Danforth to pursue it.
"Wendel liked the idea so much
he said, 'you guys should think
about doing it,' " Danforth said.
"And that stuck in my mind."
As part of the proposal the for
mer business students conducted
informal research by interviewing

potential advertisers and said
while the results did not foreshad
ow windfall profits, they did not
say that it was impossible.
"The research said there was no
reason why a daily would work,
but also no reason why it
wouldn't," said Danforth.
In an era dubbed the informa
tion revolution, publishing local
newspapers is often regarded as
overly expensive and behind the
times. In fact, many suggest that a
small newspaper simply doesn't
stand a chance — at least that's
what the town of Palo Alto
thought when the Peninsula

Times Tribune went out of busi
ness after it had been losing
money for over a decade. Dan
forth, too, acknowledged the dan
ger.
"There is a point spread of 2-1
that says we are not going to last
more than 90 days," he said.
The three-man founding team
at the Palo Alto Daily News insists,
however, that the old Palo Alto
paper was the victim of poor man
agement and that the town can
support its own paper.
"I think we very much like the
impression that we are swimming
uphill," Danforth said.
