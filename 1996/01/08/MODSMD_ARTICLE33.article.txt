# Campbell hits ground running after victory
## 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
Moving from the campaign podium to the
floor of the House of Representatives, Stanford
Law Prof. Tom Campbell plunged straight into
legislative duties after his victory in the 15th
Congressional District last month.
"The day after the election, I flew to Wash
ington to be sworn in," Campbell said from his
Capitol Hill office. "I've been here ever since."
Voters had a chance to see Campbell in action
as soon as he took office Dec. 15, with the budget
debate calling for immediate attention. Many of
his constituents contacted him about the federal
shutdown, including many Veterans Adminis
tration employees, Campbell said.
As a means to alleviate the crisis of fur
loughed federal employees, Campbell described a
Republican plan to re-open the government that
allows employees to go back to work today.
"That way the workers won't be victimized,"
said Campbell, who is considered to be a moder
ate Republican.
To show his solidarity with government
workers who have not been paid during the
shutdown, Campbell said he would give back his
salary "until the crisis is over."
Campbell said he believes the origins of the
federal shutdown lay in President Clinton's vow
in November to balance the budget in seven
years.
Although Clinton appointed the Congression
al Budget Office to make financial projections,

he did not submit a budget
plan, Campbell said.
Enough funds have been
allotted for federal employee
salaries until Jan. 26, Campbell
said, adding that by then
Congress will try to resolve the
balanced-budget dilemma.
Campbell predicted that the
budget crisis will have major
implications for other Congres
sional issues this year.

"We'll need to restructure Medicare, wel
fare," Campbell said. The federal government
will be making critical decisions on how money is
spent on these programs in the upcoming
months, whether in block grants or under feder
al mandates, he said.
Congress must also contend with the contin
ued U.S. presence in Bosnia, Campbell said.
"We'll be having bi-weekly hearings on the
issue," said Campbell, a member of the House
International Relations Committee. "Bosnia is
the present challenge."
Along with Congressional duties, Campbell
was also recently appointed co-chair of the Cali
fornia Civil Rights Initiative, which supporters
are trying to place on the November ballot. The
initiative seeks to end affirmative action in edu
cation, government jobs and contracts.
"Instead, we should go by a need-basis,"
Campbell said. "Individuals all face unique
obstacles that we must consider."
Taking 60 percent of the vote in a special

December election, Campbell defeated Democrat
Jerry Estruth to take Democrat Norm Mineta's
vacated seat.
The election was marked by negative ads
from each candidate. Estruth compared Camp
bell to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.,
while Campbell accused Estruth of financial
irresponsibility. Many political analysts looked
at the race as a referendum on Gingrich's style
of politics.
However, Kevin Spillain, lead consultant for
Campbell's campaign, justified the ads, noting
that "the negative television ads from Estruth
came three to four weeks before us."
"We needed to respond, to remind the voters
that there were two candidates," Spillain said.
"If Estruth wanted to run against Newt Gin
grich, he needed to move to Atlanta."
The Democrats' negative approach to the
campaign was their downfall, Campbell said.
Campbell has served in the U.S. House of
Representatives before, from 1988 to 1992. He
was elected to the California Senate in a 1993
off-term vote and continued to teach classes at
Stanford Law School during his time in office.
However, with so many new political obliga
tions this year, Campbell said he intends to
take a leave of absence from the University.
Future plans for Campbell including running
again in November to keep his House seat, which
conies up for re-election this year.
For now, Campbell said he is enjoying the
rush of days on Capitol Hill.
"It's been quite exciting," he said.
