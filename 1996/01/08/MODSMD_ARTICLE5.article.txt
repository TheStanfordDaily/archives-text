# No power leaves students studying in the dark
## Rainstorms wash out finals week 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Storms that ripped across cam
pus and the Bay Area in early De
cember left many students study
ing by candlelight and some of the
homeless stranded without their
makeshift shelters.
Heavy rain and wind flooded
San Francisquito Creek and
knocked down power lines and
trees, causing $30,000 to $40,000
in damage, according to Facilities
Operations Manager Herb Fong.
Area residents both on and off
campus were affected, as power in
several houses on the Row and in
other University buildings w.us out
for most of finals week, while else
where entire houses succumbed to
the torrents.
Power outages on campus were
caused by fallen Pacific Gas and
Electric power lines, said Facilities
Engineer Steve Briscombe. The
parts of campus powered by the
University's power system, Cardi
nal Cogen Energy Facility, were
unaffected, he said.
"The problems were exclusively
with PG&E. There was no disrup
tion from Cardinal Cogen,"
Briscombe said. "The primary
problem was downed power lines.
Everything on campus and every
thing from Cardinal Cogen is un-

derground."
But the fact that Stanford's
power system wasn't at fault failed
to comfort students.
Many resorted to studying in
their rooms or lobbies, surrounded
by rings of candles. Others flooded
into the lounges of dorms with full
electrical service.

Problems on campus weren't
limited to electricity. Fong said
trees fell in many parts of campus,
including a large redwood near
Arboretum Road which fell onto an
oak tree. Other oak and eucalyptus
trees were also knocked over in the
Oval and in front of 808 house on
Mayfield Avenue.
"There are still trees down,"
Fong said last week. "We will be
working on this for the next two to
three weeks. . . . We have cleaned
up most of the debris on the

ground, but we need to do aesthet
ic tree work."
Employees have been working
overtime to clean up campus, Fong
added.
For homeless people living
under the bridge where El Camino
Real crosses San Francisquito
Creek, the storm was devastating.
Water rose quickly and the peo
ple living there fled, leaving their
belongings behind, said Bay Area
Action member Devin McKinney.
He said members of his group and

the Stanford Homelessness Action
Coalition mobilized immediately to
salvage the belongings before they
were swept downstream.
A homeless woman who identi
fied herself as "K.C." said the rain
came down so hard she was left
with nothing to do but panhandle
to find a room for the night.
But that wasn't as bad as escap
ing from the flood itself. "It was
scary," she said. "I can't swim.
That's all I kept saying — I can't
swim."
