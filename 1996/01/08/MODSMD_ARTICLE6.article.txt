# Peninsula rapist strikes again
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
The Peninsula rapist who
haunted women throughout Sep
tember appears to have committed
another crime.
This time the victim is a 19-year
old woman in Palo Alto, attacked on
Dec. 20.
The woman, whose name was
withheld, was attacked at 7:11 p.m.
while walking on the 3400 block of
Middlefield Road. The assailant al
legedly pulled her into dense bushes
and raped her in one of the few se
cluded areas on the street, police
said.
In September, police throughout
the Peninsula attempted to track

the serial rapist, described as a mus
cular black man in his late teens to
early 20s, about 6 feet tall.
Through scientific evidence, po
lice have now confirmed the con
nection of the rape to the attacks
three months ago.
"We believe it is the same sus
pect," said Lori Kratzer of the Palo
Alto Police Department. "We look
at cases in certain ways to deter
mine similarities, but there are as
pects we can't make public."
On Dec. 22, after an attempted
rape on Newell Avenue in East Palo
Alto, police arrested a suspect who
they originally believed could have
been the serial rapist.
However, police no longer link
the suspect from the second rape,

Jimmy Earl Grey, to the other
rapes last year.
"We looked at the description of
the guy, the method, general simi
larities, and then confirmed the dif
ference by scientific evidence that
the rapes are unconnected," Detec
tive Jim Kaufman said.
Police are continuing to search
for the serial rapist. "It is difficult
to say how best women can stay
safe," Kratzer said. "These have
happened in broad daylight and in
the dark â€” they are not secluded,
sometimes occurring even in high
traffic areas."
The Dec. 20 attack occurred in a
covered area, dense with old rose
bushes and cherry trees. The
attacker could have been lying in
wait for a lone woman, the detec

tive ;xud.
Unlike several of the other
attacks, the woman said she did not
see a white van and that instead
the man ran away on foot.
After the assaults stopped in
September, police believed the
rapist left the area due to the pub

licity about the incidents. Howev
er, police suspected he would
return.
"We think the suspect has a link
to this area," said Kratzer. "What
ever you do, have heightened
awareness, keep your eyes open,
and be aware."
