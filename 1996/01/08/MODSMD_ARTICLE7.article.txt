# Cardinal receives bitter lesson at Graceland
## Football loses 19-13 in Liberty Bowl 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
If the Stanford football team was the much-es
teemed Dr. Jekyll throughout the 1995 regular season,
then Mr. Hyde finally reared his head against East
Carolina at the 37th Annual St. Jude Liberty Bowl on
Dec. 30.
The normally potent Cardinal offense could do
nothing, while the normally less-than-spectacular
Stanford defense could do no wrong. The end result
was just as unusual for 1995. When all was said and
done, the Cardinal held the short end of the stick in a
close contest.
Stanford (7-4-1) mustered only 211 total yards, an

offensive season low, in its 19-13 loss to East Carolina
(9-3). At the same time, the Cardinal defense, led by se
nior cornerhack Kwame Ellis, did not surrender an of
fensive touchdown to the vaunted Pirate attack, turn
ing what was billed as a shoot-out into a grind-it-out.
"Our guys weren't executing," said Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham. "For whatever reasons, our
offense couldn't get on track."
After a 34-yard field goal by Chad Holcomb extend
ed ECU's lead to six with one minute, five seconds re
maining, the Cardinal had one final chance to take the
lead. Sophomore Damon Dunn, the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's top kickofT returner, took the Pirate offering

from the 8 to the 48, giving Stanford excellent field
position from which to start its final drive.
The Cardinal managed to move the ball to the East
Carolina 20 but could do no further damage. On
fourth-and-one with 15 seconds remaining, senior
quarterback Mark Butterfield tried to connect with
junior Brian Manning on a quick slant, but the ball
was thrown low and Manning couldn't hang onto it.
On the day, Butterfield completed 15 of 27 passes
for only 139 yards. Due to the intensity of the ECU
pass rush, he was unable to throw deep as often as he
and offensive coordinator Dan Bible would have liked.
"They were really bringing the heat," Butterfield
said. "They're one of the best defenses we've seen."
Stanford's offensive line was beset on all sides as
the Pirates used a number of different blitzing

schemes to throw the Cardinal attack off kilter. East
Carolina registered three sacks in the game.
"They came in a lot of different ways," said senior
tackle Jeff Buckey. "They were at the right places at
the right times. Hats off to them."
Butterfield was surprised that the offense struggled
throughout. While the Cardinal had failed to execute
at certain points in certain games, never before had
there been such a complete breakdown. "I thought for
sure that we'd get going," he said. "This was the worst
performance of the year. There are good things that I
can take from this year, but this game is going to be a
bitter taste in my mouth for awhile."
The offensive woes began early. The Cardinal's
opening drive showed promise initially but stalled on
the ECU 33. Senior placekicker Eric Abrams' 50-yard
field goal attempt sailed wide left.
On the Cardinal's next possession, ECU's Lorenzo
West deflected a Butterfield pass into the hands of cor
nerback Daren Hart, who raced unmolested down the
right sideline for a 39-yard touchdown return.
The teams traded punts for the remainder of the
first quarter. ECU's vaunted passing attack proved
almost as silent as Stanford's. Pirates head coach
Steve Logan was forced to use some tricks and trinkets
to jump-start his squad.

On second-and-eight from the Cardinal 43, East
Carolina ran the "fumblerooski." Quarterback Marcus
Crandell took the snap, placed the ball on the ground
by his left foot and ran right with a few blockers. The
Stanford defense took the bait and chased afler Cran
dell. Meanwhile, H-back Mitchell Galloway picked up
the "fumble" and ran left for a 12-yard gain.
The trick play set up a 46-yard field goal by Hol
comb, the longest of his career. The ECU kicker, only
10-of-17 on the year, constituted the bulk of the Pirate
offense with four field goals, two from farther than 40
yards out.
After senior Marlon Evans fumbled on the ensuing
kickoff return, the Stanford defense exhibited the kind
of fortitude it would show for the remainder of the
game. ECU had a first down on the Cardinal 24 but
could not convert. Butterfield and Co. would get the
ball back after sophomore linebacker Jon Haskins
tackled Jerris McPhail for a seven-yard loss on a
fourth-and-five run play.
For a brief period of time, the Cardinal offense
climbed out of its funk, driving down the field with
running backs Anthony Bookman and Mike Mitchell.
However, Pirate senior Mark Libiano, ECU's star
linebacker, sacked Butterfield for a 10-yard loss at the
Stanford 38.
Nonetheless, the Stanford quarterback showed
some resilience, tossing a 31-yard pass, his longest
completion of the day, to Manning on third-and-23.
The big play set up a one-yard touchdown plunge by
junior fullback Adam Salina.
ECU closed out the first half scoring two more
field goals. Pirate linebacker Morris Foreman gained
23 yards on a fake punt to move the ball into Stan
ford territory and set up the first field goal. Just
before the half expired, Roderick Coleman nailed
Butterfield as he dropped back to pass, causing a
fumble. Travis Harden picked the ball up and rum
bled to the Stanford 26 before being pulled down.
Shortly afterward, Holcomb sent his team into the
locker room ahead 16-7.
Perhaps because of the offense's inability to accom
plish much, the Cardinal defense took it upon itself to
score as soon as play resumed. Junior Nicodemus
Watts ran untouched through the Pirate line to block
a punt, Stanford's fifth of the year. Ellis recovered the
ball at the 2 and took it into the end zone for the score.
"In preparing for the game, we thought the middle
was vulnerable," Watts said. "I've got to compliment
the other guys on the team — they made a hole big
enough for me to run through."
Ellis was just getting started. Two plays later, he
picked off a Crandell pass at midfield to give Stanford
another chance to score. Unfortunately, the offense
couldn't make the most of the opportunity.
The Cardinal faced third-and-one from its own 32
on its next possession. Salina couldn't bull his way
through the ECU front for the first down. Willingham,
in an extremely uncharacteristic move, elected to go
for it on fourth down. Unfortunately for Stanford,
Salina w;is stopped yet again and the Pirates gained
possession within field-goal range.
Luckily for Willingham and the Cardinal, Ellis
wasn't done with his show yet. He raced in and blocked
Holcomb's 24-yard attempt, keeping the margin at

three.
"Every time we come into a special teams situation,
I feel like I can make a play," Ellis said.
The senior took little joy from his inspired perfor
mance. "Regardless of what the defense does, if we lose
the game, it doesn't sit well," he said.
After Ellis' block, Butterfield threw his second
interception of the day, giving ECU the ball at the Car
dinal 26. Once again, the defense rose to the occasion.
Although the Pirates had a first-and-10 at the 12, they
couldn't get the first down or a score. On third-and
one, senior tackle Pete Swanson dropped McPhail for
a one-yard loss. Junior free safety Josh Madsen broke
up Crandell's fourth-down pass to keep the game
close.
"The game played out like 1 oxpected it to," Willi ng
ham said. "I did not think it would be a shoot-out. The
defense stepped up and played one of its best games of
the year. Our early turnovers gave them a cushion
that we could not get over."

I feel like I can make a play," Ellis said.
The senior took little joy from his inspired perfor
mance. "Regardless of what the defense does, if we lose
the game, it doesn't sit well," he said.
After Ellis' block, Butterfield threw his second
interception of the day, giving ECU the ball at the Car
dinal 26. Once again, the defense rose to the occasion.
Although the Pirates had a first-and-10 at the 12, they
couldn't get the first down or a score. On third-and
one, senior tackle Pete Swanson dropped McPhail for
a one-yard loss. Junior free safety Josh Madsen broke
up Crandell's fourth-down pass to keep the game
close.
"The game played out like 1 oxpected it to," Willi ng
ham said. "I did not think it would be a shoot-out. The
defense stepped up and played one of its best games of
the year. Our early turnovers gave them a cushion
that we could not get over."

Senior Kwame Ellis reacts to his third quarter
touchdown.
If the Stanford football team was the much-es
teemed Dr. Jekyll throughout the 1995 regular season,
then Mr. Hyde finally reared his head against East
Carolina at the 37th Annual St. Jude Liberty Bowl on
Dec. 30.
The normally potent Cardinal offense could do
nothing, while the normally less-than-spectacular
Stanford defense could do no wrong. The end result
was just as unusual for 1995. When all was said and
done, the Cardinal held the short end of the stick in a
close contest.
Stanford (7-4-1) mustered only 211 total yards, an

offensive season low, in its 19-13 loss to East Carolina
(9-3). At the same time, the Cardinal defense, led by se
nior cornerhack Kwame Ellis, did not surrender an of
fensive touchdown to the vaunted Pirate attack, turn
ing what was billed as a shoot-out into a grind-it-out.
"Our guys weren't executing," said Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham. "For whatever reasons, our
offense couldn't get on track."
After a 34-yard field goal by Chad Holcomb extend
ed ECU's lead to six with one minute, five seconds re
maining, the Cardinal had one final chance to take the
lead. Sophomore Damon Dunn, the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's top kickofT returner, took the Pirate offering

Stanford 13

from the 8 to the 48, giving Stanford excellent field
position from which to start its final drive.
The Cardinal managed to move the ball to the East
Carolina 20 but could do no further damage. On
fourth-and-one with 15 seconds remaining, senior
quarterback Mark Butterfield tried to connect with
junior Brian Manning on a quick slant, but the ball
was thrown low and Manning couldn't hang onto it.
On the day, Butterfield completed 15 of 27 passes
for only 139 yards. Due to the intensity of the ECU
pass rush, he was unable to throw deep as often as he
and offensive coordinator Dan Bible would have liked.
"They were really bringing the heat," Butterfield
said. "They're one of the best defenses we've seen."
Stanford's offensive line was beset on all sides as
the Pirates used a number of different blitzing

schemes to throw the Cardinal attack off kilter. East
Carolina registered three sacks in the game.
"They came in a lot of different ways," said senior
tackle Jeff Buckey. "They were at the right places at
the right times. Hats off to them."
Butterfield was surprised that the offense struggled
throughout. While the Cardinal had failed to execute
at certain points in certain games, never before had
there been such a complete breakdown. "I thought for
sure that we'd get going," he said. "This was the worst
performance of the year. There are good things that I
can take from this year, but this game is going to be a
bitter taste in my mouth for awhile."
The offensive woes began early. The Cardinal's
opening drive showed promise initially but stalled on
the ECU 33. Senior placekicker Eric Abrams' 50-yard
field goal attempt sailed wide left.
On the Cardinal's next possession, ECU's Lorenzo
West deflected a Butterfield pass into the hands of cor
nerback Daren Hart, who raced unmolested down the
right sideline for a 39-yard touchdown return.
The teams traded punts for the remainder of the
first quarter. ECU's vaunted passing attack proved
almost as silent as Stanford's. Pirates head coach
Steve Logan was forced to use some tricks and trinkets
to jump-start his squad.

On second-and-eight from the Cardinal 43, East
Carolina ran the "fumblerooski." Quarterback Marcus
Crandell took the snap, placed the ball on the ground
by his left foot and ran right with a few blockers. The
Stanford defense took the bait and chased afler Cran
dell. Meanwhile, H-back Mitchell Galloway picked up
the "fumble" and ran left for a 12-yard gain.
The trick play set up a 46-yard field goal by Hol
comb, the longest of his career. The ECU kicker, only
10-of-17 on the year, constituted the bulk of the Pirate
offense with four field goals, two from farther than 40
yards out.
After senior Marlon Evans fumbled on the ensuing
kickoff return, the Stanford defense exhibited the kind
of fortitude it would show for the remainder of the
game. ECU had a first down on the Cardinal 24 but
could not convert. Butterfield and Co. would get the
ball back after sophomore linebacker Jon Haskins
tackled Jerris McPhail for a seven-yard loss on a
fourth-and-five run play.
For a brief period of time, the Cardinal offense
climbed out of its funk, driving down the field with
running backs Anthony Bookman and Mike Mitchell.
However, Pirate senior Mark Libiano, ECU's star
linebacker, sacked Butterfield for a 10-yard loss at the
Stanford 38.
Nonetheless, the Stanford quarterback showed
some resilience, tossing a 31-yard pass, his longest
completion of the day, to Manning on third-and-23.
The big play set up a one-yard touchdown plunge by
junior fullback Adam Salina.
ECU closed out the first half scoring two more
field goals. Pirate linebacker Morris Foreman gained
23 yards on a fake punt to move the ball into Stan
ford territory and set up the first field goal. Just
before the half expired, Roderick Coleman nailed
Butterfield as he dropped back to pass, causing a
fumble. Travis Harden picked the ball up and rum
bled to the Stanford 26 before being pulled down.
Shortly afterward, Holcomb sent his team into the
locker room ahead 16-7.
Perhaps because of the offense's inability to accom
plish much, the Cardinal defense took it upon itself to
score as soon as play resumed. Junior Nicodemus
Watts ran untouched through the Pirate line to block
a punt, Stanford's fifth of the year. Ellis recovered the
ball at the 2 and took it into the end zone for the score.
"In preparing for the game, we thought the middle
was vulnerable," Watts said. "I've got to compliment
the other guys on the team — they made a hole big
enough for me to run through."
Ellis was just getting started. Two plays later, he
picked off a Crandell pass at midfield to give Stanford
another chance to score. Unfortunately, the offense
couldn't make the most of the opportunity.
The Cardinal faced third-and-one from its own 32
on its next possession. Salina couldn't bull his way
through the ECU front for the first down. Willingham,
in an extremely uncharacteristic move, elected to go
for it on fourth down. Unfortunately for Stanford,
Salina w;is stopped yet again and the Pirates gained
possession within field-goal range.
Luckily for Willingham and the Cardinal, Ellis
wasn't done with his show yet. He raced in and blocked
Holcomb's 24-yard attempt, keeping the margin at

three.
"Every time we come into a special teams situation,
I feel like I can make a play," Ellis said.
The senior took little joy from his inspired perfor
mance. "Regardless of what the defense does, if we lose
the game, it doesn't sit well," he said.
