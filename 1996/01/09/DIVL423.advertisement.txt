Attention African American, Chicano, Native
American and Filipino American Students!
The Irvine Fellows Program For Future Ph.D.s
is now accepting nominations from Stanford Faculty for students to participate
in the 1996 summer program to take place June 24 through August 1 on the
Stanford campus.
In an effort to increase the flow of historically under-represented students
entering graduate study, the James Irvine Foundation provides funding for
students who are of African American, Mexican American, Native American or
Filipino American descent to take part in the Irvine Fellows Program for Future
Ph.D.s.
This program is designed to provide the intellectual rigor and orientation to
academic culture which will ease students' transition into doctoral study and
enable them to excel in Ph.D. programs in preparation for careers as faculty in
the Humanities and Social Sciences.
Program Activities Include:
• Graduate-level seminar led by Stanford Faculty.
• Tutorials led by Stanford Graduate Students.
• Writing Workshops.
• Miscellaneous Supplementary Workshops (GRE preparation,
library research sessions, etc....)
• Cultural-Educational Fieldtrips.
The Program Provides:
• Room and Board.
• $2,500 Stipend.
• Required Texts.
Interested students who wish to be considered for this program should have a
professor send a letter of nomination to Edmund Campos, 415/725-6680,125
Sweet Hall 3088, random@leland.stanford.edu. Nominations must arrive by
February 16.
Come to an informational meeting on Thursday, January 11, 4:30-5:30 PM, Bldg.
200, Rm. 307. Speak with the Program Director and hear former Irvine Fellows
share their experiences of the program.
