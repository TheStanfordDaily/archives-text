WHY THE BUDGET CANNOT BE BALANCED
Some very important people have recently suggested that the U.S. budget should be balanced. They are
making this recommendation even though a) there has not been a balanced budget in the U.S. over a five
year period since 1925-30, b) the five prior "balanced budget" fervors in the 1800's ail led to depres
sions (see Barron's 1/2/96 Currer.t Yield Column), and c) no major industrialized nation balances its
budget. The Maastricht treaty to unite Europe requires a deficit not greater than 3% of GDP. The U.S. deficit
is currently 1.8% of GDP. The main U.S. problem is the tr=>de deficit, not the budget deficit. In Japan,
deficits were reduced (not eliminated) from 1989-1993. That country is still if tecession. and is about to issue
$47 trillion yen ($468 billion U.S.) in new 1996 debt to stimulate its economy.
There is no question that we should strive to maximize productivity and minimize consumption. That is
different from blindly balancing the budget.
CHALLENGE TO ALL PROPONENTS OF A BALANCED BUOGEj; -400.000 to the first person who
explains why the article "Analyzing the Economy with Poker" is incorrect in a broad sense. This article,
which is available without charge by calling 800-666-3903, or writing to Box 7634, Beverly Hills, CA 90212
explains that
a) Spending cuts are disguised forms of tax increases. For example, reducing a teacher's afier-tax
salary from $30,000/ year to $25.000/ year is essentially the same as giving them a $5,000/ year tax increase.
Cutting spending to the poor by $10 billion/year is similar to leaving spending the same while increasing
their taxes by roughly S>lo billion/year.
b) Cutting spending to the poor will decrease the incomes of the non-poor. When the poor receive
less money, they spend less for food, healthcare, rent, etc., which affects the incomes of merchants,
doctors, and landlords. These individuals then have less money to spend which affects the incomes of yet
more Americans. In other words, there is a "trickle-up" decline :n after-tax incomes.
c) The deficit represents a "loss" to the government and & 'win" to the private sector. The $4*
trillion national debt represents $4- trillion in wealth to Americans and foreigners who hold U.S. IOUs
either directly or via their accounts at banks, savings and loans, money market funds, etc. Eliminating the
deficit by a combination of tax increases and spending cuts (which are also essentially tax increases)
eliminates f he after-tax "win" to the private sector caused by the deficit and has a profound impact on the
incentive to produce and innovate. Aside from causing a reduction in the production of goods and services,
it is likely to lead to a decline in prices which will precipitate low interest rates and a depression, as
occurred in the 1800's, the 1930'5, and more recently in Japan.
MYTHS CONCERNING BALANCED BUDGETS
1. "Balancing the budget will lead to lower interest rates which will enhance growth." Theie is no
historical evidence to support the enhanced growth claim. The last six times the budget was balanced for
five or more years we had depressions.
2. "Our children will be crushed by the debt we leave them." This may be true, but it is predominantly
a consequence of the ongoing trade deficit, not the budget deficit. If we increase production, reduce
consumption (by modifying the tax code), and insist on fair trade, we will make good progress in this area
without balancing the budget. Reducing the rate of deficit growth is fine - bringing the deficit down to zero
for prolonged periods has historically had disastrous consequences.
3. "I balance my budget, why can't the government do the same." The government has to take care of
many needy people who without Government help could not "balance their budgets " If for example, the
government completely cut off all aid to the blind, disabled veterans, those on welfare, medicaid, etc. you
would see a) many more people begging and dying on the streets, b) much more crime, and c) the probable
burning of American cities. Taking care of the needy does not help our foreign trade deficit or our government
deficit but it is the American way. Tolerating unfair trade practices and exporting American jobs overseas
should not be the American way.
