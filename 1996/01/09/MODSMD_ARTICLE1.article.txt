# Stanford Secret Service?
## Guarding Farm's famous visitors is no day at beach 
### Molly Stephens Staff writer 
Stanford lni\ersity is a magnet tor stars, politi
cians and royalty. Last quarter alone, the University
played host to film director Oliver Stone, former
Texas Gov. Ann Richards, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and
Irish President Mary Robinson.
In fact, more than 200 celebrities have visited The
Farm since 1974.
Hut fame and notoriety are not without their dan
gers. The Stanford Police constantly work behind the
scenes to ensure that notables are well protected dur
ing their visits to campus. Thanks to the security pro
vided by the Stanford Police, the University has yet
to experience any major problems associated with
celebrity visits.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemever said the
first important visit he experienced was when Presi
dent Ford spoke at the Law School dedication in
1975.
"At that time, Sarah Jane Moore had been trying
to assassinate the president," Niemever said. "But
since we had police, security and SWAT teams cover
ing t he area so well, she didn 't even try to assassinate
him on campus. The next day in San Francisco, she
took a shot at him."
Niemever said another important visit occurred in
1983 when Queen Flizabeth II came to the Farm. Se
curity had to be very tight since the Irish Republican
Army had a strong, militant contingent in San Fran
cisco at the time.
In addition, the visit by French President Franyois
Mitterand in 1984 was accompanied by much pomp,
Niemever said.
"It was like a scene from 'Apocalypse Now,'
Niemeyer said. "All the helicopters landed at Ruble
Field . . . and they took a motorcade to |1 niversity
President Donald I Kennedy's house. "
Approximately four helicopters landed at Roble
and more than 80 members of the press corps were at
the scene.
"But the biggest visit we've ever, ever had was
[Mikhail| Gorbachev's visit in 1990,' Niemeyer said
"It whs the biggest visit ill t he history of the world at
Stanford. Just overwhelming.
Niemeyer said Gorbachev had a motorcade of
about 50 cars. As they drove down Palm Drive, thou
sands of people were watching. About 4,000 to 5,00 C
people were allowed into the Quad to listen to Gor
bachev.
"We had to magnetometer (an instrument which
detects concealed weapons) every human being that
even came close to Gorbachev, Niemeyer said. "W(


Niemeyer
had people in trees, sniper teams,
secret service, SWAT teams and
highway patrol. It was a multi
jurisdictional effort because we
just didn't have enough people."
Police begin their work when
they receive notice that a celebrity
will be visiting the campus,
Niemeyer said. Officers meet with
the sponsors to gather intelligence
information on the celebrity, and
they consult with the State
Department to assess the threat
involved with the celebrity's visit.
"We don't do security detail on
everyone," Niemeyer said. "It is
based on threat assessment — the
potential for people to get mad."
"We look at the country the
celebrity is coming from, the
crowd the celebrity will attract
and the political problems associ
ated with the celebrity," Stanford
Police Sgt. John McMullen added.
McMullen also said Stanford
Police contact the Secret Service if
the celebrity is a head of state and
qualifies for protection from the
federal government. They then go
over the schedule and arrange the

motorcade to campus with the
California Highway Patrol.
Security on campus is a cooper
ative effort between the Stanford
Police and outside police and secu
rity forces, Niemeyer said. Stan
ford Police take the lead when
planning where the celebrity
should travel because they know
"the lay of the land."

We now call it 'The Play.'
We sent a false motor
cade to the right, and
they rushed it. The real
motorcade left without
problems.'
— Sgt. John McMullen

Before a celebrity event, Stan
ford Police erect barricades for
traffic, perform bomb sweeps with
the county bomb dog, create
buffer zones around rooms and
sometimes even weld shut man
hole covers, McMullen said.
Although no major problems
have occurred during a celebrity
visit, police have had to deal with
minor, unexpected problems.
Gov. Pete Wilson came to talk

in the in 1991 the day after
the state building in Sacramento
was burned by members of ACT
UP, a gay and lesbian rights
group, because the governor had
vetoed a bill protecting gays and
lesbians in the workplace.
"ACT-UP members showed up
in bus loads," McMullen said. "We
had a heck of a time with thein.
They had drums and horns and
tried to rush the gate. We called for
reinforcements to try to keep them
out, but they got in anyway. They
threw oranges at the governor, and
the governor caught one of the
oranges and threw it back to them."
McMullen said getting Wilson
out of Stanford was difficult
because ACT-UP members were
ready to rush the motorcade.
"We pulled the wool over their
eyes getting the governor out,"
McMullen said. "We now call it
'The Play.' We sent a false motor
cade to the right, and they rushed
it. The real motorcade left with
out problems.
"I have to give Capt. Niemeyer
credit Ile was the quarterback on
that one. He crafted the play to
get him out of there," McMullen
added. "It's all about being ready
to improvise at a second's notice
and to take a curve ball."

crowd the celebrity will attract
and the political problems associ
ated with the celebrity," Stanford
Police Sgt. John McMullen added.
McMullen also said Stanford
Police contact the Secret Service if
the celebrity is a head of state and
qualifies for protection from the
federal government. They then go
over the schedule and arrange the

motorcade to campus with the
California Highway Patrol.
Security on campus is a cooper
ative effort between the Stanford
Police and outside police and secu
rity forces, Niemeyer said. Stan
ford Police take the lead when
planning where the celebrity
should travel because they know
"the lay of the land."

We now call it 'The Play.'
We sent a false motor
cade to the right, and
they rushed it. The real
motorcade left without
problems.'

Before a celebrity event, Stan
ford Police erect barricades for
traffic, perform bomb sweeps with
the county bomb dog, create
buffer zones around rooms and
sometimes even weld shut man
hole covers, McMullen said.
Although no major problems
have occurred during a celebrity
visit, police have had to deal with
minor, unexpected problems.
Gov. Pete Wilson came to talk

in the in 1991 the day after
the state building in Sacramento
was burned by members of ACT
UP, a gay and lesbian rights
group, because the governor had
vetoed a bill protecting gays and
lesbians in the workplace.
"ACT-UP members showed up
in bus loads," McMullen said. "We
had a heck of a time with thein.
They had drums and horns and
tried to rush the gate. We called for
reinforcements to try to keep them
out, but they got in anyway. They
threw oranges at the governor, and
the governor caught one of the
oranges and threw it back to them."
McMullen said getting Wilson
out of Stanford was difficult
because ACT-UP members were
ready to rush the motorcade.
"We pulled the wool over their
eyes getting the governor out,"
McMullen said. "We now call it
'The Play.' We sent a false motor
cade to the right, and they rushed
it. The real motorcade left with
out problems.
"I have to give Capt. Niemeyer
credit Ile was the quarterback on
that one. He crafted the play to
get him out of there," McMullen
added. "It's all about being ready
to improvise at a second's notice
and to take a curve ball."
