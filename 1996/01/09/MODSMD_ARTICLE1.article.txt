Stanford lni\ersity is a magnet tor stars, politi
cians and royalty. Last quarter alone, the University
played host to film director Oliver Stone, former
Texas Gov. Ann Richards, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and
Irish President Mary Robinson.
In fact, more than 200 celebrities have visited The
Farm since 1974.
Hut fame and notoriety are not without their dan
gers. The Stanford Police constantly work behind the
scenes to ensure that notables are well protected dur
ing their visits to campus. Thanks to the security pro
vided by the Stanford Police, the University has yet
to experience any major problems associated with
celebrity visits.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemever said the
first important visit he experienced was when Presi
dent Ford spoke at the Law School dedication in
1975.
"At that time, Sarah Jane Moore had been trying
to assassinate the president," Niemever said. "But
since we had police, security and SWAT teams cover
ing t he area so well, she didn 't even try to assassinate
him on campus. The next day in San Francisco, she
took a shot at him."
Niemever said another important visit occurred in
1983 when Queen Flizabeth II came to the Farm. Se
curity had to be very tight since the Irish Republican
Army had a strong, militant contingent in San Fran
cisco at the time.
In addition, the visit by French President Franyois
Mitterand in 1984 was accompanied by much pomp,
Niemever said.
"It was like a scene from 'Apocalypse Now,'
Niemeyer said. "All the helicopters landed at Ruble
Field . . . and they took a motorcade to |1 niversity
President Donald I Kennedy's house. "
Approximately four helicopters landed at Roble
and more than 80 members of the press corps were at
the scene.
"But the biggest visit we've ever, ever had was
[Mikhail| Gorbachev's visit in 1990,' Niemeyer said
"It whs the biggest visit ill t he history of the world at
Stanford. Just overwhelming.
Niemeyer said Gorbachev had a motorcade of
about 50 cars. As they drove down Palm Drive, thou
sands of people were watching. About 4,000 to 5,00 C
people were allowed into the Quad to listen to Gor
bachev.
"We had to magnetometer (an instrument which
detects concealed weapons) every human being that
even came close to Gorbachev, Niemeyer said. "W(
