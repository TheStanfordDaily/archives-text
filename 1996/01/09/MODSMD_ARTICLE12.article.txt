Zaire plane crash leaves more than 200 dead
KINSHASA, Zaire (AI *) — A cargo plane plunged onto a busy
downtown street just after takeoff yesterday and tore through a
crowded market, mowing down cars, shacks and people in a fiery
skid that left more than 200 dead.
Black smoke billowed from the wreckage as soldiers covered vic
tims' bodies with white sheets.
As darkness fell over Kinshasa, a chaotic, crumbling city of 6 mil
lion. calls went out over national radio and television for people to
donate blood to help survivors. The dead filled the city's four main
hospital morgues.
No official casualty count was released, but hospital workers and
news reports said more than 200 people died. A U.S. Embassy offi
cial said he had unconfirmed reports from embassy sources of 300
dead.
Helmet law repealed
SACRAMENTO (AP) — For the first time in five years, hundreds
of leather-clad motorcycle riders roaring around the Capitol got
their wish: an Assembly committee voted to repeal the mandatory
helmet law.
As motorcyclists finished their annual rally, the Transportation
Committee voted yesterday 9-5 to send the repeal law to the Appro
priations Committee. The vote came despite testimony from police,
insurance and medical groups that the law has saved lives and pre
vented injuries.
Motorcycle groups have been holding a rally at the Capitol each
January since the Legislature in 1991 passed the law requiring all
motorcycle drivers and passengers to wear safety helmets. But law
makers have refused to change the law, despite repeal bills being
introduced each year.
What's different this year is a new Republican majority in thi
state Assembly and on its committees. The nine lawmakers voting
for the bill are all Republicans.
Another difference, explained the author, Assemblyman Hill Mor
row, R-Oceanside, is that Congress last year repealed the law linking
certain federal funds to states having a mandatory helmet law.
1 )wight 1 lelmick, commissioner of the ('alifornia I lighway Patrol
said the number of licensed motorcycle drivers has dropped about
20,000 to 820,000, but said the law has saved lives.
In 1990, 569 motorcyclists were killed and 18,578 injured. In
1994, the death total was 291 and injuries 9,938.
