# Blizzard continues to assail East Coast
## 
### 
(AP) — A blizzard of historic proportions
shut down the East at the start of the work
week, stopping cars, trains, planes and just
about anything else that moves. At least 41
deaths were blamed on the weather.
Only emergency vehicles were allowed on
many highways and New York City streets —
I loboken, N.J., even set up roadblocks — and all
major airports were closed from Washington to
Boston. Bus lines shut down, and passengers
from one Amtrak train were stuck in a West
Virginia hotel.
Hundreds of truckers and other travelers
were stuck in truck stops, restaurants and high
way service areas.
It was the third worst snowstorm on record
for New York City, where 20.6 inches piled up in
skyscraper-surrounded Central Park. Outlying
Staten Island got more, with 27.5 inches.
"It reminds me of when I was growing up in
Iceland," said Olos Haggert.
The citv's worst blizzard was the day after

Christmas in 1947, when 26.4 inches fell. But
there was little wind, unlike the blizzard of
March 12, 1888, when 21 inches got heaped into
drifts that reached second-story windows. The
1888 storm killed more than 300 people on the
East Coast.
The Northeast also got heavy snow in 1983,
when Philadelphia received a record 21.3 inch
es. That city got more this time: 30.3 inches.
The Baltimore region got 23 inches, just
short of the 24.7-inch record set in the big bliz
zard of January 1922.
The most snow was in the Appalachians,
with 43 inches in West Virginia's Webster
County, and 30 in parts of Virginia and Ten
nessee. Far to the south, Georgia got a foot and
Alabama highways were iced.
Mail delivery was halted in Washington and
New York City, and hundreds of schools were
closed from Georgia to New Hampshire. New
York City's 1 million schoolchildren enjoyed
their first snow day since 1978; classes were

canceled until tommorrow at least.
Much of the federal government was shut
down, and Phil Gramm and Hob Dole had to
cancel New Hampshire campaign treks because
they couldn't get out of Washington. The Unit
ed Nations also closed.
The New York, American and Nasdaq stock
exchanges opened late for abbreviated sessions.
But the storm shut down the New York Mer
cantile Exchange and the New York Commodi
ty Exchange, among others.
Major airports for Washington, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, Newark, N.J., Boston and New
York City shut down, and waiting areas turned
into shelters. Drifts at New York's airports were
as high as 20 feet, said Port Authority executive
director George Marlin.
And that backed up flights elsewhere. Between
700 and 900 TWA passengers bound for the East
('oast were stranded overnight at St. Louis.
Hundreds of people flying in from Europe to New
York had to spend the night at Bangor, Maine.
