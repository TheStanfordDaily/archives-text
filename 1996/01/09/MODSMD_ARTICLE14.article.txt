# Court limits racy TV

WASHINGTON (AP)
Rebuffing free-speech advocates,
the Supreme Court is letting feder
al regulators confine racy televi
sion and radio programs to late
night hours when children are less
likely to tune in.
The justices left intact a federal
appeals court ruling that upheld
government limits on indecent
broadcasts. The Federal Commu
nications Commission restricts
any such program on TV or radio
to the hours between 10 p.m. and 6
a.m.
The news media, civil liberties
and children's advocacy groups
and others, including poet Allen
Ginsberg, had challenged the rule
as a violation of free-speech rights.
The appeals court had ruled last
summer that the rule was justified
by the government's "compelling
interest in protecting children."
The high court's action, taken
without comment, was among a
flurry of orders issued by the jus
tices yesterday while most of
Washington was shut down in the
aftermath of a major snowstorm.
Eight of the nine justices made

it to work, several with the help of
four-wheel drive vehicles sent by
court officials. Justice John Paul
Stevens was stranded in Florida
because all Washington-area air
ports were closed.
The broadcast indecency rule
was upheld last June by the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia. "We find that
the government has a compelling
interest in protecting children
under the age of 18 from exposure
to indecent broadcasts," the
appeals court said.
Past court rulings have defined
"indecent material" as that which
describes sexual or excretory activ
ities or organs in patently offensive
terms.
When it comes to controlling
what's on TV in American homes,
said Peggy Charren, a children's
television activist, "I think the off
button is pretty good."
The problem with government
limits, she said yesterday, "is that
one person's entertainment is
someone else's indecency and one
person's education is someone
else's indecency."
