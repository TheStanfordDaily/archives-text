PARIS (AP) — On that May
night in 1981, Francois Mitter
rand brought Frenchmen back
to the Bastille, their enduring
symbol of revolution. Waving
roses, not pitchforks, they
danced to the dawn of a Socialist
France.
Fourteen years later, after
the longest reign since Napoleon
111, he left France with twice as
many jobless, more people living
on the street, and high-level
scandals in government and
business.
And still, for many French
men, he died a conquering hero.
Hut if Charles de Gaulle
chiseled his name forever into
the annals of France, histori
ans will debate endlessly over
the legacy of Francois Mitter
rand.
In the journal Enquete Sur
l'Histoire, editor Dominique
Venner noted that 1989 and the
years that followed reshaped all
of Europe, offering unparalleled
challenge to a great statesman.

Venner, however, felt that Mit
terrand did not meet the chal
lenge.
Soon after Mitterrand was re
elected in 1988, his popularity
rating dipped below 50 percent.
When he left office in 1995, head
high and battling painful cancer,
enthusiastic ratings had
returned.
Mitternmd's own assessment
appeared in memoirs published
as a long interview with Elie
Wiesel, a Nobel laureate and old
friend, who survived a Nazi
death camp. He listed achieve
ments:
Abolit ion of the death penal
ty; a new face of France after
decentralization; defense of
oppressed people in the Third
World; decisive positions for the
construction of the European
Union.
"I believe," Mitterrand added,
"that this makes up part of a bal
ance sheet of which I would be
proud, if I had the propensity to
be proud."
