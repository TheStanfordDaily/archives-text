COURSE READERS: AT one
point or another, most Stan
ford students have owned
them. And usually, in addition to
condensing 10 weeks worth of
course materials into custom-made,
two-inch high volumes, they have
the characteristic of being quite
expensive. Indeed, besides copy and
production costs, the final price
reflects licensing fees for all includ
ed materials.
Professors who use the Hook
store to produce their course read
ers can save students 10-20 percent
of production costs by turning in
the materials for their readers at
least three to four weeks before the
quarter begins. Specifically, stu
dents save 10 percent if the materi
als are turned in three weeks in
advance, 20 percent four weeks in
advance.
Fortunately, a cursory glance at
the shelves in the basement of the

Bookstore this quarter reveals that
most professors are on the ball and
have secured at least a 10 percent
discount for students enrolling in
their courses. It is comforting to see
professors setting a good example
by turning in their winter-break
homework on time. And while most
students would no doubt prefer
that their professors reduced the
size of their readers to yield even
greater savings, the professors who
put forth extra effort to decrease
cost deserve a pat on the back.
Conversely, professors who have
yet to follow suit, while not com
mitting a serious crime, deserve a
slap on the wrist. While these pro
fessors may claim a lack of personal
motivation, they cannot claim igno
rance, as the Bookstore distributes
fliers publicizing its program to
every department on campus.
Hopefully, these holdouts will
make amends next quarter.
