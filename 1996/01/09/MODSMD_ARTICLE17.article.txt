# The 						empty shelves
## 
### 
IT'S THE BEGINNING of
another quarter and you know
the drill: pay your University
bill, sign up for classes, stand in
line to buy your books. . . .
Wouldn't it be nice, after wad
ing through all those people, if the
Bookstore actually had the books
you wanted? It seems that time
and time again, students wander
through a maze of Bookstore
shelves only to find that the books
they need are hopelessly sold out.
Missing hooks is not only both
ersom it is a hindrance to academ
ic performance. It's hard to under
stand a course when vou can't do
the first two weeks of reading and
complete the problem sets. It's
unfair to ask professors to slow
down their teaching because stu
dents aren't able to keep up with
their work. At the bare minimum,
the Bookstore, which has a virtual
monopoly on campus, has a
responsibility to ensure that the
books are available, even if they're
not always affordable.

Faculty members often com
plain that the Bookstore orders
enough books to cover its own
estimates of course enrollment
without consulting them about
the accuracy of the estimates —
an annoying and ill-conceived
i practice. And to help those who
are left without books, the Book
store often does little more than
reorder, which can take up to two
i weeks — one-fifth of a 10-week
quarter.
The Bookstore owes its student
customers better service than
this. It could, for example, make a
i habit of asking other area or col
lege bookstores to ship a missing
book overnight, or respect faculty
opinions concerning course enroll
ment.
Sold-out books are a small prob
lem which can have huge ramifica
tions. Making an effort to solve it
may mean that the Bookstore will
have to subdue its thirst for prof
it, but it is simply the considerate
and responsible thing to do.
