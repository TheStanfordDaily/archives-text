## Baby stroller solution 
### 
I REALLY HATE Christmas shop
ping, but I have a special place in my
demented little mind for those
morons who insist upon cruising the
crowded malls behind their Winnebago
sized baby strollers.
Just before Christmas, I had the
pleasure of dealing with some of these
evil folk. I was waiting for a table at
Max's Opera Cafe over at the Stanford
Shopping Center during t he lunch-hour
rush. If you haven't ever been to Max's
during a time like this, let me describe
to you what it is like: damn crowded. It
gets so crowded along the only path
from the front door to the front desk
that yovi can't wot your lips without
accidentally licking someone. '
The next thing I know, not one, but
two women are aiming their mammoth
strollers through the front door and
towards the crowd. These were big
strollers â€” the kind where the rear seat
in the mini-van has to be permanently
removed and the shocks stiffened in
order to accommodate one of these
monsters. They have sunroofs, enter
tainment systems, airbags and probably
even a full bar somewhere inside. And
to make it even more ridiculous, the
parents actually seem to believe that
their six-week-old kid appreciates the
Rolls Royce of baby strollers.
There was no way these strollers

could fit through this crowd, but the
women didn't care. They just bent over
a little and, with an evil grin, started
pushing. People tried to get out of the
way as best they could. I had to climb up
onto the bar for safety, along with a
dozen other people. The people who
were actually sitting at the bar sudden
ly had all of us on their laps and didn't
know what to do. Oh, and someone
touched me someplace that I don't want
to talk about.
Out of uncharacteristic pity, the first
stroller stopped just before running
down some old lady who hadn't noticed
the commotion. When someone tapped
hor on the shoulder, she turned around,
looking like a deer caught in the head
lights of an oncoming car. She just
stood there, white-faced. Someone had
to help her to safety.
It all came to an end after a few min
utes. The two women were on their way
to a table and the few people who were
run over like dogs were being helped up.
The scary thing is that this type of
experience happens a lot. That incident
wasn't even the only one I had with
killer baby strollers that day. The whole
situation reminds me of that TV movie
entitled "Killdozer." In case you don't
watch late-night movies as often as I do,
this show was about a possessed bull
dozer that drove itself and killed people.

Maybe this movie wasn't the most real
istic, but when you are diving away
from some baby stroller that is aimed at
you and so large you can't see the per
son pushing it, you start to believe that
machinery can become possessed.
My solution to the "Kill-stroller"
problem is simple. Give mall security
the power to ticket these bad-mamas.
Not only would this penalize the reck
less stroller drivers, but it would give
those mall security guys something to
do. Throw in a shopping cart with a
light bar on top and maybe even an
occasional camera crew from "Cops"
and suddenly a position as mall security
guard is in high demand.
However, the most effective preven
tion starts at home. For that reason, I
promise you that when Madonna and I
have our baby, it will never ride around
in public in one of those beasts. Our
child will be happy riding around in one
of those child-carrying backpacks on the
shoulders of one of our bodyguards.

The Mr. M cCull ough - M a don n a-baby
making-union is not official yet, but
with a little luck, it is bound to be con
firmed any day now.
