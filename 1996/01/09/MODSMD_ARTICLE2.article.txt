# Minor programs pose big challenges
## Smaller departments could struggle next fall as new curricula arise

Although the goal of the under
graduate minor is to increase student
flexibility, the implementation of the
program may cause short-run compli
cations for both advisers and depart
ment administrators and eventually
could harm small departments, facul
ty and staff said.
With the new program slated to
begin this fall, school officials are still
determining the details of the process
including how departments with
few majors will be affected, how an al
ready over-burdened advising system
will handle the extra load and how to
define what courses will count toward
a minor.
Faculty in smaller departments, al-

though cautiously en
thusiastic, said they
are wary that minors
may limit the number
of students seeking a
secondary or double
major in their depart
ment.
"Small depart
ments are a little
leerv of the minor,"

said Drama Department Administra
tor Ron Davies, whose department
submitted a minor proposal to the
School of Humanities and Sciences
last month.
The new program — proposed by
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies and the Committee on Acade
mic Appraisal and Achievement and
approved by the Faculty Senate in No

vember — allows students to declare
an unlimited amount of minors in ad
dition to their major. The recommen
dation mandates that minors consist
of at least six courses but total no
more than 36 units.
Each undergraduate school of the
University will offer minors. Howev
er, while each program and depart
ment now offering a major in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
will offer a minor, only some depart
ments in the Schools of Earth Sci
ences and Engineering will offer mi
nors.
Small departments smaller?
Smaller departments in each
school are concerned that the number
of majors in their subject will decrease
with the rise of the minor.

With many double majors strug
gling to fulfill requirements for two
majors, professors in small depart
ments said they worry that prospec
tive double majors may opt for the
minor rather than the major in the
small department.
Faculty in departments such as
drama, which has only 10 majors, feel
they lack the resources to provide the
extra classes minors would require.
"The additional time is not built
into the budget," Davies said. "It
means more bookkeeping and contact
hours without increasing the faculty
population."
These departments hope, however,
that students who double major and
students who minor are two separate
