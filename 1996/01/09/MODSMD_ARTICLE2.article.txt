# Minor programs pose big challenges
## Smaller departments could struggle next fall as new curricula arise 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
Although the goal of the under
graduate minor is to increase student
flexibility, the implementation of the
program may cause short-run compli
cations for both advisers and depart
ment administrators and eventually
could harm small departments, facul
ty and staff said.
With the new program slated to
begin this fall, school officials are still
determining the details of the process
including how departments with
few majors will be affected, how an al
ready over-burdened advising system
will handle the extra load and how to
define what courses will count toward
a minor.
Faculty in smaller departments, al-

though cautiously en
thusiastic, said they
are wary that minors
may limit the number
of students seeking a
secondary or double
major in their depart
ment.
"Small depart
ments are a little
leerv of the minor,"

said Drama Department Administra
tor Ron Davies, whose department
submitted a minor proposal to the
School of Humanities and Sciences
last month.
The new program — proposed by
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies and the Committee on Acade
mic Appraisal and Achievement and
approved by the Faculty Senate in No

vember — allows students to declare
an unlimited amount of minors in ad
dition to their major. The recommen
dation mandates that minors consist
of at least six courses but total no
more than 36 units.
Each undergraduate school of the
University will offer minors. Howev
er, while each program and depart
ment now offering a major in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
will offer a minor, only some depart
ments in the Schools of Earth Sci
ences and Engineering will offer mi
nors.
Small departments smaller?
Smaller departments in each
school are concerned that the number
of majors in their subject will decrease
with the rise of the minor.

With many double majors strug
gling to fulfill requirements for two
majors, professors in small depart
ments said they worry that prospec
tive double majors may opt for the
minor rather than the major in the
small department.
Faculty in departments such as
drama, which has only 10 majors, feel
they lack the resources to provide the
extra classes minors would require.
"The additional time is not built
into the budget," Davies said. "It
means more bookkeeping and contact
hours without increasing the faculty
population."
These departments hope, however,
that students who double major and
students who minor are two separate


Shoven
constituencies.
"We've sustained a nice,
healthy body of majors," said
Classics Asst. Prof. Andrea
Nightingale. "Minors constitute
a separate group of kids who
can't imagine the possibility of a
double major."
The question of just how
many double majors will switch
to the minor is unclear. Last
year, approximately 25 percent
of the graduating class double
majored.
John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, said he does not foresee a
dramatic shift in the distribution
of majors, but predicted that as
many as 75 percent of students

will choose to minor.
He emphasized that every
department will be evaluated on
its overall teaching contribu
tion.
"I think some of the small
departments will be extremely
popular as minors," he said.
"We're not going to look just at
the number of majors and say
that a department is less effi
cient."
In hindsight, some double
majors say the additional time
and flexibility offered by a
minor would have been benefi
cial.
"I definitely would have con
sidered it," said Anne Bracy, a
double major in symbolic sys
tems and German studies. "If I
had found the German hard to fit
in, it would have had to take
back-burner precedence."
While the new program has

several risks, some small depart
ments are counting on a core
group of students to remain in
their programs.
"I think the program of a
major still has enough benefits
that I wouldn't have switched to
a minor," Kathleen Beman, a
double major in English and fem
inist studies, said.
The German Studies Depart
ment plans to exploit the new
program. The department will
offer two minors, one in lan
guage ability and one in "cultur
al / intellectual material in trans
lation," German Studies Prof.
Russell Berman said.
"Every new venture has
risks," said Berman, who chairs
the department. "But as this new
program will provide a larger
group of students access to the
materials, it is probably a risk
worth taking."

Definition of a minor
Departments, however, are
still defining what courses will
count towards a minor.
"In principle there is no over
lap except as a prerequisite to a
minor," said Assoc. Psychology
Prof. Anne Fernald, who pre
sented the minor proposal to the
Faculty Senate.
Under the system, there will
be no double counting or overlap
ping. For example, a biology
major will not be able to count
the required year of chemistry
for a chemistry minor.
However, premedical students
will be able to count their
requirements toward the comple
tion of minors.
This led to a debate at the
Faculty Senate meeting over
whether the minor represents
recognition for knowledge or
recognition for units. Some fac

ulty members argued that stu
dents who fulfill minor require
ments should receive the minor,
regardless of whether the minor
courses counted toward a sepa
rate major.
"Frankly, I find it a little
strange," said Biology Prof. Bob
Simoni said. "However, if the
problem of overlap becomes trou
blesome, we can deal with it
down the line."
Minors will be structured so
as to prevent students from only
taking introductory courses,
Shoven said.
"Each department will decide
how the minor will be struc
tured, but we are aiming for a
coherent program of study, a
kind of limited version of a
major," Fernald said.
In order to create this "limit
ed" in-depth study, the required
courses chosen by some depart

ments may specify prerequisites
not counted toward the minor.
"For some minors, it will be
up to the students to prepare
themselves for the classes for
that minor. It's the nature of
engineering," said John Brav
man, assistant dean of the School
of Engineering.
It may also be up to the stu
dents to determine in what to
minor, as they learn along with
advisers how the system works.
The Undergraduate Advising
Center will strive to keep its
advisers well informed about the
details of the minor require
ments, said Hector Cuevas, cen
ter director.
"The new program will have
some impact, but not an extraor
dinary impact," he said. "We've
got to be open to discussing the
possibility of minoring versus
double majoring."

still defining what courses will
count towards a minor.
"In principle there is no over
lap except as a prerequisite to a
minor," said Assoc. Psychology
Prof. Anne Fernald, who pre
sented the minor proposal to the
Faculty Senate.
Under the system, there will
be no double counting or overlap
ping. For example, a biology
major will not be able to count
the required year of chemistry
for a chemistry minor.
However, premedical students
will be able to count their
requirements toward the comple
tion of minors.
This led to a debate at the
Faculty Senate meeting over
whether the minor represents
recognition for knowledge or
recognition for units. Some fac

ulty members argued that stu
dents who fulfill minor require
ments should receive the minor,
regardless of whether the minor
courses counted toward a sepa
rate major.
"Frankly, I find it a little
strange," said Biology Prof. Bob
Simoni said. "However, if the
problem of overlap becomes trou
blesome, we can deal with it
down the line."
Minors will be structured so
as to prevent students from only
taking introductory courses,
Shoven said.
"Each department will decide
how the minor will be struc
tured, but we are aiming for a
coherent program of study, a
kind of limited version of a
major," Fernald said.
In order to create this "limit
ed" in-depth study, the required
courses chosen by some depart

ments may specify prerequisites
not counted toward the minor.
"For some minors, it will be
up to the students to prepare
themselves for the classes for
that minor. It's the nature of
engineering," said John Brav
man, assistant dean of the School
of Engineering.
It may also be up to the stu
dents to determine in what to
minor, as they learn along with
advisers how the system works.
The Undergraduate Advising
Center will strive to keep its
advisers well informed about the
details of the minor require
ments, said Hector Cuevas, cen
ter director.
"The new program will have
some impact, but not an extraor
dinary impact," he said. "We've
got to be open to discussing the
possibility of minoring versus
double majoring."
Although the goal of the under
graduate minor is to increase student
flexibility, the implementation of the
program may cause short-run compli
cations for both advisers and depart
ment administrators and eventually
could harm small departments, facul
ty and staff said.
With the new program slated to
begin this fall, school officials are still
determining the details of the process
including how departments with
few majors will be affected, how an al
ready over-burdened advising system
will handle the extra load and how to
define what courses will count toward
a minor.
Faculty in smaller departments, al-

though cautiously en
thusiastic, said they
are wary that minors
may limit the number
of students seeking a
secondary or double
major in their depart
ment.
"Small depart
ments are a little
leerv of the minor,"

said Drama Department Administra
tor Ron Davies, whose department
submitted a minor proposal to the
School of Humanities and Sciences
last month.
The new program — proposed by
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies and the Committee on Acade
mic Appraisal and Achievement and
approved by the Faculty Senate in No

vember — allows students to declare
an unlimited amount of minors in ad
dition to their major. The recommen
dation mandates that minors consist
of at least six courses but total no
more than 36 units.
Each undergraduate school of the
University will offer minors. Howev
er, while each program and depart
ment now offering a major in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
will offer a minor, only some depart
ments in the Schools of Earth Sci
ences and Engineering will offer mi
nors.
Small departments smaller?
Smaller departments in each
school are concerned that the number
of majors in their subject will decrease
with the rise of the minor.

With many double majors strug
gling to fulfill requirements for two
majors, professors in small depart
ments said they worry that prospec
tive double majors may opt for the
minor rather than the major in the
small department.
Faculty in departments such as
drama, which has only 10 majors, feel
they lack the resources to provide the
extra classes minors would require.
"The additional time is not built
into the budget," Davies said. "It
means more bookkeeping and contact
hours without increasing the faculty
population."
These departments hope, however,
that students who double major and
students who minor are two separate


Shoven
constituencies.
"We've sustained a nice,
healthy body of majors," said
Classics Asst. Prof. Andrea
Nightingale. "Minors constitute
a separate group of kids who
can't imagine the possibility of a
double major."
The question of just how
many double majors will switch
to the minor is unclear. Last
year, approximately 25 percent
of the graduating class double
majored.
John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, said he does not foresee a
dramatic shift in the distribution
of majors, but predicted that as
many as 75 percent of students

will choose to minor.
He emphasized that every
department will be evaluated on
its overall teaching contribu
tion.
"I think some of the small
departments will be extremely
popular as minors," he said.
"We're not going to look just at
the number of majors and say
that a department is less effi
cient."
In hindsight, some double
majors say the additional time
and flexibility offered by a
minor would have been benefi
cial.
"I definitely would have con
sidered it," said Anne Bracy, a
double major in symbolic sys
tems and German studies. "If I
had found the German hard to fit
in, it would have had to take
back-burner precedence."
While the new program has

several risks, some small depart
ments are counting on a core
group of students to remain in
their programs.
"I think the program of a
major still has enough benefits
that I wouldn't have switched to
a minor," Kathleen Beman, a
double major in English and fem
inist studies, said.
The German Studies Depart
ment plans to exploit the new
program. The department will
offer two minors, one in lan
guage ability and one in "cultur
al / intellectual material in trans
lation," German Studies Prof.
Russell Berman said.
"Every new venture has
risks," said Berman, who chairs
the department. "But as this new
program will provide a larger
group of students access to the
materials, it is probably a risk
worth taking."
