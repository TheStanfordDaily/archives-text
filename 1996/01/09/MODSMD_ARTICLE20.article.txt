Poll didn't reflect true student participation

A STORY RAN on Nov. 28 in The
Daily with (lie headline "Majority
at Stanford is uninvolved, Poll
reveals little interest in public service,
social groups." In this story, The Daily
cites the results of a telephone survey of
374 Stanford students, stating that
"Stanford students are less inclined to
participate in community serv ice groups
and activities now than they were prior to
coming to Stanford." It also identifies
"the inclination toward apathy that
appears to pervade the campus." Picking
up on the story, The San Francisco
Chronicle ran a piece on Nov. 29 entitled
"Stanford Poll Finds Drop in Volunteer
ing." The Palo Alto Weekly followed in its
Dec. 1 issue with "Community service by
Stanford students may be ebbing."
While we appreciate The Daily's inter
est in exploring what Editor in Chief
Sarah Katz identified to The Chronicle as
a lack of "hot-button issues" on campus
— and presumably its desire to motivate
students in the process — the poll itself
has several flaws that preclude the kind
of conclusions made in the article.
For example, the article based its con
clusion that "apathy . .. pervades the
campus" in part on the fact that only 46

percent of survey respondents reported
being active participants in organized stu
dent service, social and athletic groups.
Were the respondents all undergraduate
students, this might be cause for concern
However, graduate students constituted
51 percent of the survey sample. Unfor
tunately, The Weekly article compounded
this problem by reporting that all 374
students were undergraduates and The
Chronicle made only passing mention of
the fact that the two groups were not dis
tinguished.
It is common knowledge that graduate
students live and work within a very dif
ferent academic and social environment
than undergraduates and that the
demands placed on t hem leave little if an}
time for extra-academic pursuits. Under
graduates on any campus are those who
are most engaged in community service,
and on the Stanford campus, they are
engaged in remarkably large numbers (at
a rate of over 3,000 annually by our esti
mate). With this knowledge, the 46 per
cent participation figure may represent a
much larger percentage of undergraduate
participation and a smaller percentage of
graduate students — certainly not a pic
ture of "apathy."

I here are other problems with the
survey as well. For example, the article
based its conclusion that "students are
less inclined to participate in community
service" on two questions: "Are you cur
rently involved in community service
groups or activities?" and "Were you
involved in community service before
coming to Stanford?" However, these twc
questions compare apples and oranges —
the first questions asked if a student was
involved at the moment while the second
asked what the student did years prior to
coming to Stanford. (Remember, 51 per
cent of respondents were graduate stu
dents!) This is hardly a useful compari
son.
Other survey questions were poorly
worded. Respondents were asked to rate
themselves on a scale of 1-5 in response
to questions such as "How closely do you
follow national or international issues?"
or "How informed do you consider your
self regarding campus issues?" with no
clear criteria given for what the terms
assigned to the numbers (e.g. "closely,"
"somewhat closely") meant. Even with
this handicap, the poll results could have
been represented far more optimistically
in the article. The poll showed that 86

percent of students felt that they followed
national or international issues "some
what closely" to "closely," and 62 percent
placed themselves in that same range for
the question about campus issues. Both
figures could be construed as strong evi
dence that Stanford students are actually
very engaged in current issues and are
more interested in the outside communi
ty than they are in the University com
munity. Is this cause for concern?
In view of these problems, we tried to
obtain the list of survey questions and
the breakdown of responses by graduate
and undergraduate populations in order
to re-assess the results. However. The
Daily had not broken down the informa
tion this way.
Given the strong record of involve
ment in public and community service by
Stanford undergraduates, it is disheart
ening to see The Daily give such promi
nence to poorly-conceived, unscientifical
ly-gathered and questionably-interpreted
information. In the coming weeks, we
hope that The Daily takes a promised sec
ond look at this study.
