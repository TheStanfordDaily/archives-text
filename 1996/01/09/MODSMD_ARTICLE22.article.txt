## Balance budget without extremism 
### Harry Reid 
IT SEEMS THAT the politicians in Washington are really serious about balancing the federal budget. But the rhetoric continues to fly as both
sides accuse the other of playing politics and needlessly putting thousands of federal workers out of a job just before the holidays. So who's
right? We asked both sides to give a non-partisan view of the situation.

MENTION THE WORDS Washington D.C. and the budget
debate these days and you had better be ready for some pret
ty irate responses. From college students whose loans have
not come through to small business owners who rely on government
contracts, to nurses in our VA hospitals who been holding food
drives in order to feed their families, to senior shut-ins anxiously
awaiting their next Meals-on-Wheels dinner, the American people
have been the victims of a political game played by extremists in the
House of Representatives majority party.
For an unprecedented 21 days, a small group of representatives,
led largely by the freshman members of the House, held the liveli
hood of millions of Americans hostage while they tried to link the
government shutdown to ongoing negotiations to balance the bud
get. There should be no link between keeping our government up
and running and the current budget debate. This weekend, the
House Republicans finally regained some of their senses and passed
a resolution to open the government back up and pay the employees
who have been used as pawns so that one side could claim uncondi
tional victory.
Now we can get down to the task at hand — a balanced-budget
deal. On Saturday, after he signed the resolution opening up the
government, President Clinton brought to the table a modified ver
sion of a balanced-budget plan passed by the Senate Democratic
Leadership over a month ago. Unlike House Speaker Newt Gin
grich's plan, this measure balances the budget in seven years with
out inittinLr Medicare. Medicaid, education and the enviro. <ent

The following statistics provide a few important differences
between the Clinton and the Republican budget plans.
The current Republican plan would cut $5 billion in grants and
student loans and end the Direct Lending program. The Democrat
ic plan recognizes the need to invest in the future by defending stu
dent aid programs, cutting zero dollars and keeping Direct Lending,
which bypasses the middleman and saves taxpayers money.
Another point that should resonate with the middle class is the
closing of corporate tax breaks. While Republicans have agreed to
cut $18 billion worth of these breaks, the Democrats are pushing for
far more — about $60 billion.
Finally, the Republicans want to cut $177 billion from the Medi
caid system, which provides low-cost or free health care to those
who cannot afford it. In addition, they want to end Medicaid as an
entitlement. Democrats favor cutting $52 billion, a less drastic
amount that would still give citizens a health safety net.
Last November, Americans sent a message of change to Wash
ington, but I believe they didn't send a message of extremism and
cold-heartedness. Providing a $245 billion tax break for a small
minority of the most affluent of our society prior to balancing the
budget makes little economic sense and does not strike me as the
kind of change that most Americans would support.
Balancing the budget and bringing about change does not mean
abandoning our clean-air and water laws and drastically reducing
Medicare, Medicaid and student loans.
