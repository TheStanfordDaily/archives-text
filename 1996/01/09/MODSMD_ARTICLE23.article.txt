# Republicans' plan for a balanced budget is a win for America
## 
### Bill Baker 
THE EFFORT TO balance the budget is one of the most historic
legislative initiatives in history. Yes, it's easy to hyperbolize and
wax the rhetorical about the budget battle now taking place on
Capitol Hill. Yet it is difficult to underestimate the significance of ham
mering out a plan that will actually bring revenues and expenditures
into line by 2002.
A balanced budget will mean lower interest rates on home and auto
purchases and on student loans. It will require Congress and the Amer
ican people to make difficult choices about spending priorities — about
what role the federal government should assume in the next century.
Eliminating the federal deficit will have a profound impact on our chil
dren's lives, in lowering the debt burden placed upon them after

years of deficit spending.
In November, President Clinton signed an agree

ment stating that he would agree to a seven-year
budget plan scored by the Congressional Budget

Office. Backing away from this agreement

which was formalized by the President's signa

ture —is more than disturbing. Let's not forget >
that it is Mr. Clinton himself who cited the CBO as

a non-partisan, reliable source for numbers-crunching
in his 1993 State of the Union address.

A* we work towards a balanced-budget agreement, there clearly
must be good faith and effort on both sides to reach a negotiated
compromise. After serving as the Republican leader of the California J
Assembly Ways and Means Committee for seven years, I knew how /
significant principled compromise is to reaching a successful agree-i

ment.
However, on some basic issues, there must be no compromise..
We must balance the budget by 2002. That is the deadline imposed j
by the President's own Bipartisan Commission on entitlements, j
headed by Democratic Senator Bob Kerry and Republican Senator 112
John Danforth. The Commission found t hat by 2002, there would J
be no money left in the federal budget except for funds to pay for I
entitlements and interest on the national debt. I hat means no |

money for defense, transportation or
national parks like Yosemite. This sce
nario is not acceptable and must not bi

allowed to take place.
Further, we must not compromise
on obtaining a fairer tax burden for

ordinary Americans and businesses. A \
recent study by the Heritage Founda
tion, using Internal Revenue Service.

numbers, found that in my home state of California, 5.9 mil
lion dependents would be eligible for the $500-per-child tax
I credit, with a total reduction of $2.(i billion annually.
Throughout the state, a GOP family tax cut would wipe

485,000 of taxpayers off the tax rolls completely, giving these families
$294 million of their own money.
Further, a capital gains tax cut is imperative. Enabling business and
self-employed persons to retain more of what they earn will create jobs

and stimulate the economy. Billions of dollars of
investment capital is tied up now by those

who are understandably reluctant to

invest because of huge taxes on their

earnings.
There are also other critical goals

that we must pursue in any budget
accord. These include:

• Medicaid. Republicans have passed a 53
percent increase in Medicaid spending
while giving states greater flexibility. Cer-

tain requirements, such as federal nursing
home quality assurance standards, are

retained

Education. Under the GOP Balanced
Budget Act, the dollar volume of stu
dent loans increases by 50 percent,
V jumping from $'24 billion to $36 bil-
J lion by 2002, with more loans made
4 available next year than ever before,
{ rising from 6.6 million loans in 1995
to 7.1 million in 1996.

These are just a sampling of the

sound proposals we Republicans have

put forth. I hope that the President is now
willing to work with us. I applaud his com-

I mitment to finding a bi-partisan solution to
the nation's budgetary crisis. I and my Republi-

can colleagues are willing to listen, negotiate
and compromise.

But on one point there can be no
\ compromise — we must stay the course

and balance the budget by 2002. On
it his issue, there can be no retreat or
equivocation.
