## Men's basketball hopes to rocket through tough Pac-10 Cardinal must overcome injuries to beat conference favorites UCLA and Cal 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
One weekend down, nine to go — and
judging by last weekend's wild action, the
battle for supremacy in the Pacific 10
Conference will be a dogfight. Unless a
team bears down and ducks the competi
tion, it will have a devil of a time surviv
ing.
Arizona has already become painfully
aware of this fact, as the Wildcats fol
lowed a 99-75 drubbing at the hands of
California (the worst in head coach Lute
Olson's career at Arizona) with a 80-71
loss to Stanford. UCLA struggled against
Washington State, who then lost to USC.
And don't count out Washington, whose
motto this year should be "A move to the
middle echelon of the Pac-10!"
Here's a quick look at how the teams
stack up:
1. UCLA (9-3 overall, 2-0 Pac-10, ranked
No. 17 Associated Press)
Many were writing off the defending
national champions after the Bruins lost
three of their first five games. But after
winning seven in a row, including an
overtime tilt with Washington State in
the Palouse, UCLA has shown i( has all
the tools to grab the conference title.
Led by junior Charles O'Bannon and
sophomores Toby Bailey and J R. Hen
derson, the Bruins boast the most athlet
ic ability the conference has seen in
years. Injuries to both of junior point
guard Cameron Dollar's hands have lim
ited his effectiveness, but Bailey has per
formed admirably at the point.
Bailey lias also sited his "shoot first,
think later" mentality. Bailey is shooting
54 percent from the field, 45 percent
from behind the three-point line. Both
percentages rank in the top 10 in the con
ference.
The addition of freshman center
Jelani McCoy has given the Bruins their
most imposing defensive presence in the

last decade, as McCoy leads the confer
ence in blocked shots.
While the Bruins have enough to win
the conference, their lack of leadership
and impatient offense (the Bruins aver
age almost 18 turnovers per game) will
probably mean a quick exit from the
NCAA tournament. However, with only
one senior on the roster (reserve forward
Kevin Dempsey), UCLA could prove
unbeatable next year.
2. California (7-3, 2-0, No. 27)
Head coach Todd Bozeman is like a
very young, very rich little boy. He has
some of the best, most expensive pieces in
the conference puzzle, and now he just
needs to learn how to put them together.
Freshman Shareef Abdur-Rahim set a
Cal freshman record with 33 points in his
first game and has a quick start for
National Freshman of the Year honors
— along with a quick first step to the bas
ket and a strong inside game.
The 6-foot-10 forward from Marietta,
Ga. leads the Pac-10 in scoring at a 23.8-
points-per-game clip and is also grabbing
7.8 rebounds per game. With last year's
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year Tremaine
Fowlkes returning Jan. 25 from a sus
pension for accepting money from illegal
sources and senior Alfred Grigsby (if he
is ever healthy) joining Abdur-Rahim,
the Golden Bears will feature the best
frontcourt in the league.
3. Arizona (10-3, 0-2, No. 18)
Yes, they may have dropped their first
two conference games of the season, but
the Wildcats have the talent and the
experience to make a run before it's over.
They proved they could battle with the
big boys back East in winning the presea
son NIT, and they are 124-7 at home over
the past eight years.
"We've got a big hole to dig ourselves
out of," said head coach Lute Olson.
But Olson has plenty of shovels in the
five seniors on his roster. Reggie Geary,

Joseph Blair, Ben Davis, Corey Williams
and Joe McLean have played 394 com
bined games, showing the type of togeth
erness and leadership that propelled
UCLA's Ed O'Bannon, Tyus Edney and
George Zidek to the national champi
onship.
Although a bit shaky hist weekend,
Geary has done well filling in at the point
for departed NBA first-rounder Damon
Stoudamire. Geary is second in the con
ference in assists and is his usual ball
hawking self on defense. Sophomores
Michael Dickerson and Miles Simon are
the future of the program but have yet to
show up every night ready to play.
4. Stanford (8-2, 2-0, No. 24)
At the beginning of the year, many
thought Stanford could win the confer
ence unless something happened to
either junior point guard Brevin Knight
or sophomore center Tim Young.
Something has happened, and it isn't
good for the Cardinal. Young's bulging
disk in his back has sidelined him indefi
nitely and the resulting lack of inside
strength changes Stanford from a power
in the paint to perimeter prayers.
Creeping back into the top 25 after a
shaky start, the Cardinal saw how good it
can be in beating Arizona State and Ari
zona last weekend. I lowever, it will take
tremendous effort and patience every
game. Other-wise, it will be an up-and
down season and a rough tournament
run for Stanford.
5. Washington (8-3, 1-1)
Eleven years after the departure of
Marv Harsh man, the Huskies have crept
out of their own doghouse. Third-year
coach Bob Bender has an experienced
backcourt and one of the rising stars in
the Pac-10 in Mark Sanford to help
Washington reach postseason play for
the first time since 1987.


Matthew Lawrence — Daily file
Freshman Mark Seaton battles for the board against Arizona's Joseph Blair. The
Wildcats will provide some stiff competition for the Cardinal this year in the Pac-10.
Sanford, a willowy 6-8, 200-
pound sophomore, has already
poured in 35 points twice this year
and ranks third in the conference in
scoring with a 19.5-point average.
Bender has also whipped his
Dawgs into a frenzy on defense.
Washington leads the conference
in steals and is tops in field-goal
defense as well. Two seven-footers
give the Huskies depth at pivot,
freeing up guards Bryant Boston,
Jason Hamilton and Jamie Booker
to gamble defensively at the point
of attack.
6. Washington State (7-3, 0-2, No.
37)
Like Stanford, the Cougars
started this year with high hopes,
returning all five starters. Howev
er, like the Cardinal, injuries have
dealt Washington State a bum
hand, so to speak. All-everything
forward Mark Hendrickson is out
with a broken bone in his shooting
hand, making the Cougars ordi
nary up front. Before he went
down, Hendrickson led the league
in rebounding (9.9 per game) and
was sixth in scoring (17.0).
Fortunately for the Cougars,
Hendrickson is not their only
weapon. Senior Isaac Fontaine,
the top returning scorer in the
Pac-10, is blistering the nets at
almost 60 percent from behind the
three-point line.
Although Washington State took
UCLA to overtime last week, it
dropped the next game to USC, sug

gesting that the Cougars haven't
gotten over last year's problem of
not getting up for every game.
7. Arizona State (5-5, 0-2, No. 48)
Bill Frieder has the real mys
tery squad in the Pac-10, as eight
new faces dot the Sun Devil lineup.
Slippery senior Ron Riley leads
Frieder's frenetic attack, with
sophomore Jeremy Veal and
junior Quincy Brewer forming one
of the peskiest backcourts in the
conference.
Although his 20.7 ppg is second
in the conference, Riley played
only five minutes in a 97-82 loss to
Cal last Saturday. Frieder said he
thinks his team needs more lead
ership, but then again, he also said
Stanford wouldn't be able to play
with Arizona without Tim Young.
The Sun Devils will cause prob
lems when schools travel to Tempe,
but on the road, they may provide
one of the few games that won't
come down to a last-minute shot.
8. USC (8-5, 1-1)
The "interim" has been
removed from head coach Charlie
Parker's name, and the first thing
Parker did was overhaul the Tro
jan basketball image. While new
facilities and a new outlook spring
from USC, a familiar face has
returned to the Trojan family after
a year's absence.
Junior Avondre Jones, who
entered USC two years ago with
the dream to "dunk on Shaq"
when he makes it to the NBA,
comes back after spending a year
at Chaffey College in Rancbo
Cucamonga, Calif. Up front, he
teams with boardman Jaha Wil

son, who leads the conference in
rebounding despite his 6-5 frame.
In the backcourt, Cameron
Murray, Brandon Martin and
Stais Bosem-m have all proven
solid, but oiler the starting five,
the Trojans are thin.
9. Oregon (8-4, 1-0)
How quickly fortunes can
change — last year, a No. 6 seed in
the NCAA Tournament, this year,
four starters and eight seniors
missing from a team that went 19-
9. Only junior Kenya Wilkins
returns with any real experience.
The Ducks do lead the league in
scoring and rebounding, but their
defense surrenders almost 75
points a game. Several of Oregon's
younger players are capable of
playing at the Pac-10 level, but it
will be a lean year for head coach
Jerry Green as he tries to find a
lineup that works.
10. Oregon State (2-8, 0-1)
The only team in danger of not
winning double digit games, the
Beavers face the same problem as
t he I )ucks. Brent Barry was a first
round pick in the NBA draft and
three other starters left, leaving
first-year coach Eddie Payne with
the cupboards bare. Only 12.5
points, six rebounds and 2.7 assists
return from last year's squad.
Not to beat a dead horse (or
beaver), but Oregon State has only
one player over 0-7 (6-9 Sasa
Petrovic, who tips the scales at a
robust 206 pounds) and lists no
one among the top 10 in scoring,
rebounding, assists, blocked shots,
field-goal percentage or free throw
percentage.
