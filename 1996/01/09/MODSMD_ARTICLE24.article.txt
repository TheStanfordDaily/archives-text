## Men's basketball hopes to rocket through tough Pac-10 Cardinal must overcome injuries to beat conference favorites UCLA and Cal 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
One weekend down, nine to go — and
judging by last weekend's wild action, the
battle for supremacy in the Pacific 10
Conference will be a dogfight. Unless a
team bears down and ducks the competi
tion, it will have a devil of a time surviv
ing.
Arizona has already become painfully
aware of this fact, as the Wildcats fol
lowed a 99-75 drubbing at the hands of
California (the worst in head coach Lute
Olson's career at Arizona) with a 80-71
loss to Stanford. UCLA struggled against
Washington State, who then lost to USC.
And don't count out Washington, whose
motto this year should be "A move to the
middle echelon of the Pac-10!"
Here's a quick look at how the teams
stack up:
1. UCLA (9-3 overall, 2-0 Pac-10, ranked
No. 17 Associated Press)
Many were writing off the defending
national champions after the Bruins lost
three of their first five games. But after
winning seven in a row, including an
overtime tilt with Washington State in
the Palouse, UCLA has shown i( has all
the tools to grab the conference title.
Led by junior Charles O'Bannon and
sophomores Toby Bailey and J R. Hen
derson, the Bruins boast the most athlet
ic ability the conference has seen in
years. Injuries to both of junior point
guard Cameron Dollar's hands have lim
ited his effectiveness, but Bailey has per
formed admirably at the point.
Bailey lias also sited his "shoot first,
think later" mentality. Bailey is shooting
54 percent from the field, 45 percent
from behind the three-point line. Both
percentages rank in the top 10 in the con
ference.
The addition of freshman center
Jelani McCoy has given the Bruins their
most imposing defensive presence in the

last decade, as McCoy leads the confer
ence in blocked shots.
While the Bruins have enough to win
the conference, their lack of leadership
and impatient offense (the Bruins aver
age almost 18 turnovers per game) will
probably mean a quick exit from the
NCAA tournament. However, with only
one senior on the roster (reserve forward
Kevin Dempsey), UCLA could prove
unbeatable next year.
2. California (7-3, 2-0, No. 27)
Head coach Todd Bozeman is like a
very young, very rich little boy. He has
some of the best, most expensive pieces in
the conference puzzle, and now he just
needs to learn how to put them together.
Freshman Shareef Abdur-Rahim set a
Cal freshman record with 33 points in his
first game and has a quick start for
National Freshman of the Year honors
— along with a quick first step to the bas
ket and a strong inside game.
The 6-foot-10 forward from Marietta,
Ga. leads the Pac-10 in scoring at a 23.8-
points-per-game clip and is also grabbing
7.8 rebounds per game. With last year's
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year Tremaine
Fowlkes returning Jan. 25 from a sus
pension for accepting money from illegal
sources and senior Alfred Grigsby (if he
is ever healthy) joining Abdur-Rahim,
the Golden Bears will feature the best
frontcourt in the league.
3. Arizona (10-3, 0-2, No. 18)
Yes, they may have dropped their first
two conference games of the season, but
the Wildcats have the talent and the
experience to make a run before it's over.
They proved they could battle with the
big boys back East in winning the presea
son NIT, and they are 124-7 at home over
the past eight years.
"We've got a big hole to dig ourselves
out of," said head coach Lute Olson.
But Olson has plenty of shovels in the
five seniors on his roster. Reggie Geary,

Joseph Blair, Ben Davis, Corey Williams
and Joe McLean have played 394 com
bined games, showing the type of togeth
erness and leadership that propelled
UCLA's Ed O'Bannon, Tyus Edney and
George Zidek to the national champi
onship.
Although a bit shaky hist weekend,
Geary has done well filling in at the point
for departed NBA first-rounder Damon
Stoudamire. Geary is second in the con
ference in assists and is his usual ball
hawking self on defense. Sophomores
Michael Dickerson and Miles Simon are
the future of the program but have yet to
show up every night ready to play.
4. Stanford (8-2, 2-0, No. 24)
At the beginning of the year, many
thought Stanford could win the confer
ence unless something happened to
either junior point guard Brevin Knight
or sophomore center Tim Young.
Something has happened, and it isn't
good for the Cardinal. Young's bulging
disk in his back has sidelined him indefi
nitely and the resulting lack of inside
strength changes Stanford from a power
in the paint to perimeter prayers.
Creeping back into the top 25 after a
shaky start, the Cardinal saw how good it
can be in beating Arizona State and Ari
zona last weekend. I lowever, it will take
tremendous effort and patience every
game. Other-wise, it will be an up-and
down season and a rough tournament
run for Stanford.
5. Washington (8-3, 1-1)
Eleven years after the departure of
Marv Harsh man, the Huskies have crept
out of their own doghouse. Third-year
coach Bob Bender has an experienced
backcourt and one of the rising stars in
the Pac-10 in Mark Sanford to help
Washington reach postseason play for
the first time since 1987.

Wildcats will provide some stiff competition for the Cardinal this year in the Pac-10.
