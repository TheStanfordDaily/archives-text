# Two wrestlers place at Oregon Classic
## Poor performance has Cardinal grapplers working double-time 
### Daniel Kao Editorial staff 
The Stanford wrestling team's
greatest nemesis this past winter
break wasn't other schools, teams
or wrestlers. In a way, the Cardi
nal's worst enemy was itself.
Alter a two-week hiatus from
training and competing due to dead
week and finals, Cardinal wrestlers
found themselves out of shape and
out of synch over the holiday sea
son, delivering a sub-par perfor
mance at the Oregon Classic Dec.
28-29 as only two Stanford
wrestlers placed in the event.
"We hadn't wrestled together
for two weeks and that really a fleet
ed us," said senior Matt Cano (126
pounds), who placed sixth. "We
were out of shape. Mentally, we
were prepared. We wrestled hard,
hut we just were not physically in it.
We did not do very well."
Sophomore Jason Gladden also
finished sixth in the 177-pound
division. With four of its 10 starters
sidelined — including co-captains
Jimmy Aguirre mid Tod Surmon —
Stanford's less-than-satisfactory
outing just added to the Cardinal's

growing list of woes.
The Cardinal won't take its
troubles lying down, however.
Head coach Chris Horpel has
placed his squad on a grueling work
schedule. Horpel went as far as
pulling his team from a scheduled
Jan. 7 competition at the Country
Classic Open in Bakersfield, Calif,
so that the Cardinal could train
more.
"We've just been working really
hard in preparation for (he I Pacific
10 Conferencel season and the dual
meets," Cano said.
Only assistant coach Jay Jack
son participated in the Country
Classic, capturing the title. Fellow
assistant coach Mike Schmidlin
also competed over the break,
wrestling with Cardinal sopho
mores Scott Chapman (167) and
Robert Hatta (134) in the Midlands
Tournament Dec. 27-28 at North
western. Schmidlin was the only
Stanford representative who
placed, finishing sixth.
As the season rolls along, howev
er, all eyes will shift from Stan
ford's assistant coaches to a Cardi
nal squad that struggled somewhat
