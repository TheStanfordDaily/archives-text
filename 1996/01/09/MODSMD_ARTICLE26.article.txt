# Shula's successor means success for AFC
## Jimmy Johnson and Miami Dolphins spell trouble for NFC 
### 
Another year, another Super
Howl champion from the
NFC. It's become clock
work. Just as certain as the sun
sets and rises each and every
morning, an NFC power pounds
an AFC weenie each and every
January.

There's no use in trying to
explain it. Thousands of theories
and hypotheses abound. Some say
it's a difference in ownership,
with NFC owners more willing to
pour big bucks into championship
teams. Others say the imbalance
of power hinges on the perfor
mance of a few coaches like Bill
Walsh, Hill Parcells, Jimmy John
son and even Joe Cibbs. Yet, some
people attribute it all to a differ

once in the style of play. Kach the
ory seems logical, but none seem
complete. Such sheer dominance
by one conference over another is
not only unprecedented in sports,
it's downright unnatural. One
would think that some natural
law of parity would set in.
There may be a change over
the horizon, but it will be due to
something that is anything but
natural. While pundits have
been prognosticating an AFC
renaissance for years — the old
pendulum theory — no such
shifting or swinging of power
has occurred. Ry month's end,
the masses will have yet another
world champion from the
National Football Conference.
Yes, the road is clear for the Dal
las Cowboys to win their third
championship in four years,
shellacking yet another hapless
AFC squad. Oh Terry Hradshaw,
where have you gone?
While there'll be no sign of
Hradshaw or a resurgence of the
Steel Curtain this year for the
AFC, whose likely sacrificial lamb
will be none other than Pitts
burgh, help may not be far

behind. The NFC may finally
have to relinquish its vise-like
grip on the Lombardi Trophy.
Hut it won't be due to any ordi
nary changing of the guard.
Indeed, it will be a result of one of
the most shocking occurrences
this season in the NFL: the resig
nation of Miami coach Don Shula
and his successor.
Ironically, with Shula — one of
the men who brought the AFC to
prominence in the '70s — step
ping down, his replacement, who
will guide the AFC back to great
ness, is the same man that helped
establish the NFC's supremacy.
Love him or hate him, the man is
great.
The man is Jimmy Johnson.
And nowadays, there seems to
be much reason to hate him. Not
only was he a key player in the
ousting of coaching legend Tom
Landry in Dallas, but now John
son is undeniably a main factor in
the"resignation" of coaching god
Don Shula in Miami.
A lot of people may deny John
son's role, saying that it was
Shula's performance, not John
son's specter, that led to Shula

leaving. Wrong. First of all, as a
coach for 33 years of his 66-year
life, Shula would never walk away
without pressure. While it may
technically he a resignation, in
reality, it was a firing by the
masses. Shula was pushed out.
Even ESPN's Mike Tirico acci
dentally slipped, referring to this
young year's biggest sports story
as Shula's "firing."
That brings us to the question
of why? Why would anyone think
of removing the greatest coach of
all time in such a seemingly irrev
erent manner? You name it,
Shula's done it. Most wins, high
est winning percentage, champi
onships, even a perfect season.
The Don has done it all. Sure, it
may be a case of "what have you
done for me lately?" But it's not
as if the Dolphins haven't won
and haven't been competitive.
Plain and simple, the reason was
fliminy Johnson.
Nothing short of a Super Howl
this season would have prevented
any of this because the fans know
that .Johnson can brini: them that
