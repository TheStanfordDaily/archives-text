# Fond memories, fine drinks and a football farewell
## 
### 
Last spring, when I
secured the football beat,
most people thought it
was a rather dubious honor. A
new coach, a new quarterback,
coming oft' a dismal 3-7-1 sea
son — this team wasn't sup
posed to do jack. How much
fun could covering losses be?
But I had faith and slated
the Cardinal for a fourth-place
finish (the KZSU guys can back
me up on that one). Lo and
behold, that's exactly where
Stanford finished, above and
beyond the expectations of the
"experts."

Covering the team gave me
some pretty impressive perks
— a seat near the 50-yard line
at each and every game, six
paid vacations throughout fall
quarter and a spot on KZSU's
halftime show. All in all, travel
ing with the team was a sweet
deal. I'd like to share some of
my adventures with y'all.
I arrived in Palo Alto the
evening before the team's first
game of the year against San
Jose State. Coincidentally, the
season's first kickoff fell on the
21st anniversary of the day I
first appeared on this earth. I
remember most of the game,
but what happened afterwards
is more than a little bit cloudy,
although the toilet bowl at The
Goose is firmly entrenched in
my head for some reason.
Luckily, 1 wouldn't have to
write for another two and a
half weeks, so I could afford to
put myself out of commission.
The following week, I trav
eled to beautiful Salt Lake
City. The paper paid for the
trip even though I wouldn't
actually be writing anything
about the game in the immedi
ate future. The editors weren't
too happy about the expenses I

racked up — "You went to
Utah, you stay in Utah!" is
what they told me — but I con
vinced them it was all in the
name of research. After all,
how could I be expected to
write about the team if I wasn't
at all the games? If I wasn't
laboring over an article, then
what, pray tell, was I doing?
Not a whole lot of singing with
the Tabernacle Choir, I'll tell
you that much. Despite the
religious affiliation of a large
number of the city's residents,
Joe Karlgaard (KZSU's play
by-play announcer) and I man
aged to find a few interesting
bars in which to spend some
time.
The home game against
Wisconsin was rather unre
markable, though I did get a
kick out of the Cheeseheads.
Unfortunately, my vacation
was over — I bad to start earn
ing my keep. 1 was drafted by
the Badger Herald, which
couldn't afford to send a writer
out here.
In Eugene, we got a taste of
the heights that the Cardinal
would reach in 1995. The upset
over the Ducks gave me a
chance to laugh at the guys
seated to my right in the press
box — the fellas from Oregon's
student paper who had been so
confident of victory.
I didn't see any sasquatches
on the trip north, hut I met
some humans that might have
had the same IQ. The evening
before the game, the guys from
KZSU and I were throwing a
football around in the parking
lot of the hotel. Karlgaard was
doing his best Montana
impression (which isn't very
good) and the rest of us were
running some pass patterns.
Some security guard (L.
Mandarich was the name on
the tag) came up and asked us
if we were getting ready for the
game. This guy really thought
we were members of the Stan
ford team until we set him
straight. How dumb was he?
Would any coach let his guys
run around in a hotel parking
lot the night before a game?

Goldstein
And at 5-foot-10, 175 pounds, 1
don't look much like a football
player, and I was the biggest of
the bunch. 1 can only hope that
this guy wasn't representative of
Oregon's population.
From there on in, the beat
became a lot more work. Dead
lines, features, all sorts of stuff.
Don't be fooled by their innocent
appearances — Courtney Mann
and Daniel Kao, the two sports
editors, are merciless people.
They worked me to within an inch
of my life.
Luckily, the bve week came
along, giving me a chance to
adjust to my class schedule. But
then it was back to work — I was
off to Tempe.
Over the course of the season, 1
was exposed to a number of press
boxes. Hut nothing could ever
compare to the accommodations
at Sun Devil Stadium. I shouldn't
have expected anything less.
After all, this is the same place
that hosted the Fiesta Bowl and
will host Super Bowl XXX. It was
first class all the way, even if we
were so high above the field that
the players looked like ants.
The big home stand was a bit
of a letdown. I prefer to put the
losses to UCLA and Washington
completely out of my head.
The next bit of excitement
came while I was in Los Angeles
for the USC game. We stayed next
to the Fox Plaza, a.k.a. the
Nakatomi Tower from Die Hard.
I kept expecting Hans Gruber to
come flying out of the sky.
The bus ride to the Coliseum
was like driving through a war
zone. The stadium itself was com
pletely barricaded from the sur
rounding neighborhood. Armed
patrols hovered nearby, making
sure no unwanteds breached the
lines.
The atmosphere in the press
box was no different. Guards
herded us from one area to anoth
er. Ifyou were out of your seat for
too long, someone would come
over and ask you to return to it. I

was surprised that no one fol
lowed me into the bathroom. USC
may be the Evil Empire, but this
was ridiculous.
I never thought I'd see
Moscow, but the football beat got
me there. Moscow, Idaho, that is.
We stayed there during the trip to
Washington State.
Pullman was cold and wet. I
nearly got pneumonia. The WSU
press box was as bad as ASU's
was good. The roof leaked, the
building was cold and they served
the worst-tasting hot dogs known
to mankind.
The fact that I had 100 bucks
riding on the game only made the
situation worse. When the Cardi
nal was down 17-3, I thought I
had seen the last of my money.
Luckily, the team came back, and
I got paid. The game of football
became a whole lot more exciting
when my personal fortune was on
the line.
After the game, as I basked in
the knowledge that I would find a
C-note waiting for me when I
returned to the Farm, I was priv
ileged to see the normally stone
faced Coach Willingham crack a
smile. Tyrone lit up a big stogie
mi the flight home to celebrate
the team's sixth victory of the
year, guaranteeing him a winning
rookie year.
Just a note: I know there were
some questions raised about Will
ingham's coaching experiences
and what may have motivated his
hiring. If the team's performance
on the field hasn't convinced you
that all that stuff was just talk,
then take it from me — he's for
real. In just a few short encoun
ters with him, I could tell that
he's a born leader. Stanford is
lucky to have him, and I hope that
he makes the Farm his home for
the long haul.
After Big Game, I waited anx
iously to hear if Stanford would
he invited to a bowl game. I was
angry that the Aloha Bowl chose
UCLA over the Cardinal, even
though 1 understood the reasons
and probably would have done the
same thing had I been in the
selection committee's shoes. It
was a hit of a letdown to he going
to Memphis for the Liberty Bowl

after dreaming of a Christmas in
Hawaii, but beggars like me can't
be choosers, right?
Karlgaard and I once again
made the obligatory tour of drink
ing establishments on Beale
Street while in Memphis. At one
point, we were so inebriated that
we stumbled willingly into Silky
O'Sullivan's, the ECU pep rally
headquarters.
As the only red-and-white
waves in an ocean of purple and
gold, the two of us stood out like
sore thumbs. But the ECU fans
were very hospitable. After some
good-natured heckling, we bought
each other rounds and talked
football. They were good people,
even if they were rednecks. Stan
ford fans could probably learn a
lot about going to football games
from them.
A couple of the Pirate fanatics
convinced Karlgaard and I to buy
a Silky's special known as "The
Diver," a large bucket filled with
god knows what. We guzzled it
and then I woke up on the floor of
my hotel room with a large
headache. What happened in
between is very dim, although I
remember watching Karlgaard
try to put the moves on some 17-
vear-old while I had a long, philo
sophical conversation with a
homeless guy outside the bar. It
was an interesting evening to say
the least.
1 was so hung over at the game
that even a convincing win
wouldn't have been able to lift my
spirits. The ugly contest only fur
ther depressed me. The next-to
unstoppable Stanford offense
came to a screeching halt, leaving
me with no choice but to vote for
The Stanford Band as the Cardi
nal's "Best Offensive Player of
the Game."
I think the real reason I was so
down was that I realized the party
was finally over. Win or lose, it
was the last game I would see as a
Stanford student. The joy I
received from following the
squad's triumphant year (even if
it did have an unhappy ending)
pales in comparison to the sad
ness derived from that fact. I'll
move on, but I'll never forget.
It's been a good year.

season's first kickoff fell on the
21st anniversary of the day I
first appeared on this earth. I
remember most of the game,
but what happened afterwards
is more than a little bit cloudy,
although the toilet bowl at The
Goose is firmly entrenched in
my head for some reason.
Luckily, 1 wouldn't have to
write for another two and a
half weeks, so I could afford to
put myself out of commission.
The following week, I trav
eled to beautiful Salt Lake
City. The paper paid for the
trip even though I wouldn't
actually be writing anything
about the game in the immedi
ate future. The editors weren't
too happy about the expenses I

racked up — "You went to
Utah, you stay in Utah!" is
what they told me — but I con
vinced them it was all in the
name of research. After all,
how could I be expected to
write about the team if I wasn't
at all the games? If I wasn't
laboring over an article, then
what, pray tell, was I doing?
Not a whole lot of singing with
the Tabernacle Choir, I'll tell
you that much. Despite the
religious affiliation of a large
number of the city's residents,
Joe Karlgaard (KZSU's play
by-play announcer) and I man
aged to find a few interesting
bars in which to spend some
time.
The home game against
Wisconsin was rather unre
markable, though I did get a
kick out of the Cheeseheads.
Unfortunately, my vacation
was over — I bad to start earn
ing my keep. 1 was drafted by
the Badger Herald, which
couldn't afford to send a writer
out here.
In Eugene, we got a taste of
the heights that the Cardinal
would reach in 1995. The upset
over the Ducks gave me a
chance to laugh at the guys
seated to my right in the press
box — the fellas from Oregon's
student paper who had been so
confident of victory.
I didn't see any sasquatches
on the trip north, hut I met
some humans that might have
had the same IQ. The evening
before the game, the guys from
KZSU and I were throwing a
football around in the parking
lot of the hotel. Karlgaard was
doing his best Montana
impression (which isn't very
good) and the rest of us were
running some pass patterns.
Some security guard (L.
Mandarich was the name on
the tag) came up and asked us
if we were getting ready for the
game. This guy really thought
we were members of the Stan
ford team until we set him
straight. How dumb was he?
Would any coach let his guys
run around in a hotel parking
lot the night before a game?


Seth
Goldstein
And at 5-foot-10, 175 pounds, 1
don't look much like a football
player, and I was the biggest of
the bunch. 1 can only hope that
this guy wasn't representative of
Oregon's population.
From there on in, the beat
became a lot more work. Dead
lines, features, all sorts of stuff.
Don't be fooled by their innocent
appearances — Courtney Mann
and Daniel Kao, the two sports
editors, are merciless people.
They worked me to within an inch
of my life.
Luckily, the bve week came
along, giving me a chance to
adjust to my class schedule. But
then it was back to work — I was
off to Tempe.
Over the course of the season, 1
was exposed to a number of press
boxes. Hut nothing could ever
compare to the accommodations
at Sun Devil Stadium. I shouldn't
have expected anything less.
After all, this is the same place
that hosted the Fiesta Bowl and
will host Super Bowl XXX. It was
first class all the way, even if we
were so high above the field that
the players looked like ants.
The big home stand was a bit
of a letdown. I prefer to put the
losses to UCLA and Washington
completely out of my head.
The next bit of excitement
came while I was in Los Angeles
for the USC game. We stayed next
to the Fox Plaza, a.k.a. the
Nakatomi Tower from Die Hard.
I kept expecting Hans Gruber to
come flying out of the sky.
The bus ride to the Coliseum
was like driving through a war
zone. The stadium itself was com
pletely barricaded from the sur
rounding neighborhood. Armed
patrols hovered nearby, making
sure no unwanteds breached the
lines.
The atmosphere in the press
box was no different. Guards
herded us from one area to anoth
er. Ifyou were out of your seat for
too long, someone would come
over and ask you to return to it. I

was surprised that no one fol
lowed me into the bathroom. USC
may be the Evil Empire, but this
was ridiculous.
I never thought I'd see
Moscow, but the football beat got
me there. Moscow, Idaho, that is.
We stayed there during the trip to
Washington State.
Pullman was cold and wet. I
nearly got pneumonia. The WSU
press box was as bad as ASU's
was good. The roof leaked, the
building was cold and they served
the worst-tasting hot dogs known
to mankind.
The fact that I had 100 bucks
riding on the game only made the
situation worse. When the Cardi
nal was down 17-3, I thought I
had seen the last of my money.
Luckily, the team came back, and
I got paid. The game of football
became a whole lot more exciting
when my personal fortune was on
the line.
After the game, as I basked in
the knowledge that I would find a
C-note waiting for me when I
returned to the Farm, I was priv
ileged to see the normally stone
faced Coach Willingham crack a
smile. Tyrone lit up a big stogie
mi the flight home to celebrate
the team's sixth victory of the
year, guaranteeing him a winning
rookie year.
Just a note: I know there were
some questions raised about Will
ingham's coaching experiences
and what may have motivated his
hiring. If the team's performance
on the field hasn't convinced you
that all that stuff was just talk,
then take it from me — he's for
real. In just a few short encoun
ters with him, I could tell that
he's a born leader. Stanford is
lucky to have him, and I hope that
he makes the Farm his home for
the long haul.
After Big Game, I waited anx
iously to hear if Stanford would
he invited to a bowl game. I was
angry that the Aloha Bowl chose
UCLA over the Cardinal, even
though 1 understood the reasons
and probably would have done the
same thing had I been in the
selection committee's shoes. It
was a hit of a letdown to he going
to Memphis for the Liberty Bowl

after dreaming of a Christmas in
Hawaii, but beggars like me can't
be choosers, right?
Karlgaard and I once again
made the obligatory tour of drink
ing establishments on Beale
Street while in Memphis. At one
point, we were so inebriated that
we stumbled willingly into Silky
O'Sullivan's, the ECU pep rally
headquarters.
As the only red-and-white
waves in an ocean of purple and
gold, the two of us stood out like
sore thumbs. But the ECU fans
were very hospitable. After some
good-natured heckling, we bought
each other rounds and talked
football. They were good people,
even if they were rednecks. Stan
ford fans could probably learn a
lot about going to football games
from them.
A couple of the Pirate fanatics
convinced Karlgaard and I to buy
a Silky's special known as "The
Diver," a large bucket filled with
god knows what. We guzzled it
and then I woke up on the floor of
my hotel room with a large
headache. What happened in
between is very dim, although I
remember watching Karlgaard
try to put the moves on some 17-
vear-old while I had a long, philo
sophical conversation with a
homeless guy outside the bar. It
was an interesting evening to say
the least.
1 was so hung over at the game
that even a convincing win
wouldn't have been able to lift my
spirits. The ugly contest only fur
ther depressed me. The next-to
unstoppable Stanford offense
came to a screeching halt, leaving
me with no choice but to vote for
The Stanford Band as the Cardi
nal's "Best Offensive Player of
the Game."
I think the real reason I was so
down was that I realized the party
was finally over. Win or lose, it
was the last game I would see as a
Stanford student. The joy I
received from following the
squad's triumphant year (even if
it did have an unhappy ending)
pales in comparison to the sad
ness derived from that fact. I'll
move on, but I'll never forget.
It's been a good year.
Last spring, when I
secured the football beat,
most people thought it
was a rather dubious honor. A
new coach, a new quarterback,
coming oft' a dismal 3-7-1 sea
son — this team wasn't sup
posed to do jack. How much
fun could covering losses be?
But I had faith and slated
the Cardinal for a fourth-place
finish (the KZSU guys can back
me up on that one). Lo and
behold, that's exactly where
Stanford finished, above and
beyond the expectations of the
"experts."

Covering the team gave me
some pretty impressive perks
— a seat near the 50-yard line
at each and every game, six
paid vacations throughout fall
quarter and a spot on KZSU's
halftime show. All in all, travel
ing with the team was a sweet
deal. I'd like to share some of
my adventures with y'all.
I arrived in Palo Alto the
evening before the team's first
game of the year against San
Jose State. Coincidentally, the
season's first kickoff fell on the
21st anniversary of the day I
first appeared on this earth. I
remember most of the game,
