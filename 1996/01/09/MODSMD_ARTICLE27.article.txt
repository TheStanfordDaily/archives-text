# Fond memories, fine drinks and a football farewell
## 
### 
Last spring, when I
secured the football beat,
most people thought it
was a rather dubious honor. A
new coach, a new quarterback,
coming oft' a dismal 3-7-1 sea
son — this team wasn't sup
posed to do jack. How much
fun could covering losses be?
But I had faith and slated
the Cardinal for a fourth-place
finish (the KZSU guys can back
me up on that one). Lo and
behold, that's exactly where
Stanford finished, above and
beyond the expectations of the
"experts."

Covering the team gave me
some pretty impressive perks
— a seat near the 50-yard line
at each and every game, six
paid vacations throughout fall
quarter and a spot on KZSU's
halftime show. All in all, travel
ing with the team was a sweet
deal. I'd like to share some of
my adventures with y'all.
I arrived in Palo Alto the
evening before the team's first
game of the year against San
Jose State. Coincidentally, the
season's first kickoff fell on the
21st anniversary of the day I
first appeared on this earth. I
remember most of the game,
but what happened afterwards
is more than a little bit cloudy,
although the toilet bowl at The
Goose is firmly entrenched in
my head for some reason.
Luckily, 1 wouldn't have to
write for another two and a
half weeks, so I could afford to
put myself out of commission.
The following week, I trav
eled to beautiful Salt Lake
City. The paper paid for the
trip even though I wouldn't
actually be writing anything
about the game in the immedi
ate future. The editors weren't
too happy about the expenses I

racked up — "You went to
Utah, you stay in Utah!" is
what they told me — but I con
vinced them it was all in the
name of research. After all,
how could I be expected to
write about the team if I wasn't
at all the games? If I wasn't
laboring over an article, then
what, pray tell, was I doing?
Not a whole lot of singing with
the Tabernacle Choir, I'll tell
you that much. Despite the
religious affiliation of a large
number of the city's residents,
Joe Karlgaard (KZSU's play
by-play announcer) and I man
aged to find a few interesting
bars in which to spend some
time.
The home game against
Wisconsin was rather unre
markable, though I did get a
kick out of the Cheeseheads.
Unfortunately, my vacation
was over — I bad to start earn
ing my keep. 1 was drafted by
the Badger Herald, which
couldn't afford to send a writer
out here.
In Eugene, we got a taste of
the heights that the Cardinal
would reach in 1995. The upset
over the Ducks gave me a
chance to laugh at the guys
seated to my right in the press
box — the fellas from Oregon's
student paper who had been so
confident of victory.
I didn't see any sasquatches
on the trip north, hut I met
some humans that might have
had the same IQ. The evening
before the game, the guys from
KZSU and I were throwing a
football around in the parking
lot of the hotel. Karlgaard was
doing his best Montana
impression (which isn't very
good) and the rest of us were
running some pass patterns.
Some security guard (L.
Mandarich was the name on
the tag) came up and asked us
if we were getting ready for the
game. This guy really thought
we were members of the Stan
ford team until we set him
straight. How dumb was he?
Would any coach let his guys
run around in a hotel parking
lot the night before a game?
