# True Cardinal family reminisces about past half-century on campus
## 
### Dee-Ann Durbin 
There are very few people left,
on campus who am boast of at
tending Big Game in 1930. Philip
Duffy is one of those people. He
even remembers the score.
"Stanford, 31-0," he said.
"We've never done it again,
though I've been waiting for it."
It was the first Big Game he
ever saw at the school which
would later become his alma
mater, his longtime employer
and home for almost 50 years.
Duffy, Class of '36, has lived on
campus since he became the Uni
versity's purchasing agent and
business manager of Tresidder
Union.
Even at 82, Duffy is quintes
sential Stanford, from his red
and-white checkered shirt to the
Stanford books that line his
shelves to the Cardinal bumper
sticker on his back door.
Duffy now sits in a chair that
was especially fitted for him. His
body is weak from post-polio syn
drome and he needs a walker and
some assistance to move around.
But his memory and wit were
sharp as he reminisced about the
university community he loves so
much.
A communication major,
Duffy became managing editor of
The Stanford Daily in the fall of
1935. His favorite issue was un

doubtedly the one that appeared
on April Fool's Day in 1936.
At that time, Duffy said, there
were many children suffering
from measles at Palo Alto Hospi
tal. The Daily wrote a front-page
story in bold face type announcing
t hat, due to t lie measles epidemic,
the Board of Trustees had voted
to close Stanford two weeks early.
By the time the ruse was uncov
ered, many students had already
packed to go home.
"Yes, that was a San Quentin
offense," Duffy said. "We were all
lucky we didn't get thrown out."
At the time he graduated from
Stanford, newspaper reporters
were earning $5 per week in San
Francisco. Although he was
promised a job at the Sacramento
Bee, he wanted to work closer to
Salinas, where his fiancee, a grad
uate of San Jose State, was teach
ing. Philip and Esther Duffy mar
ried in August 1937 and moved to
Manteca.
Soon, Duffy was back in the
business of his youth, running a
feed yard for cattle, following in
the footsteps of his father, who
had been the supervisor of a
2,500-acre state-owned ranch in
Napa Valley. Duffy worked 7,500
head of cattle at Manteca before
sett ling at a smaller cattle yard in
Fresno.
"Coming from a farm and
being in the cattle business is
something you don't get out of
your hide," Duffy said.
When World War II began,
Duffy wanted a communication
position in the army but didn't
pass the physical. Instead, he
went to work in Sausalito's ship
yards, where he first received
training in purchasing.
After the war, Duffy took a trip
to Stanford to visit his friend and
classmate, Alf Brandin, who
would later become Stanford's
provost. Since Stanford was with
out a purchasing agent for over
two years, Brandin saw an oppor
tunity. Duffy was hired.
The Duffys moved to Stanford
in April 1947 and settled on Sal
vatierra Street. One of Duffy's
first challenges as a purchasing
agent was furnishing Crothers
Memorial, the newest dorm on
campus. Duffy ordered the stu
dents' beds from a company in
Sheboygan, Wis., which soon
proved to be a mistake.
"Those guys thought Califor

nia was a suburb of L.A.," he said.
The beds were sent to Los
Angeles, where they got stuck
behind a special train that was car
rying Harry Truman. Duffy had to
send trucks down to rescue them.
He said he still remembers stu
dents sitting on the front steps of
Crothers, waiting for their beds.
Five years later, in September
1952, Duffy was struck with
polio. It was cruel timing, a year
before Salk's vaccine was devel
oped. Stanford supported Duffy
throughout his illness, however,
and he was soon well enough to
walk with a cane. In March 1953,
he returned to work, his two sec
retaries putting an arm each
around his shoulders and helping
him into the office each day.
Duffy's main responsibility
soon became purchasing equip
ment for the Medical Center. The
Center was located in San Fran
cisco until 1958, when it moved to
Stanford and incorporated Palo
Alto Hospital. Duffy marveled at
the Center's continued expansion
since then.
"In 1958 the school moved it
here," he said, "and the hammers
have never stopped since."
In the same year, the Duffys

moved to their current home at
762 Esplanada Way, where they
continued to raise their three
children. The children attended
Stanford Klementary School and
the Duffys* son, Tim, eventually
went to Stanford. Their daugh
ters went to San Jose State and
Berkeley.
"We wanted to spread the
wealth around," he joked about
sending a child to Stanford's
arch-rival.
Duffy said he remembered
when the kids used to run home
after school to go to Governor's
Corner, where the Duffys kept
three or four horses. They rode
the horses all over campus, from
the Red Barn and Lake Lagunita
to the present site of the Stanford
Shopping Center.
A photo of the three children
on their horses still hangs in the
front hall. Tim is on the family's
favorite, Chappo, a stocky white
horse. Chappo, who was pur
chased in the 1950s for just $35,
was over 33 vears old when he
died.
"He had no use for grown
ups," Duffy said. "But all the kids
on campus had rides on him."
When Duffv retired in the late

19605, he continued to live at
Stanford. To this day, he said he
can not imagine living anywhere
else. He and his wife think of
Stanford as their own giant park.
And what is Duffy's favorite spot
in that park?
"I suppose you should say the
church," Duffy said. "Hut I'd say
the stadium."
While there's no counting the
number of Big Games Duffy has
attended, his photo album is full
of pictures of him and Esther at
tailgate parties. He even shared
his thoughts on the Stanford
Tree.
"How would you like to spend
$25,000 a year to have your kid
Ibe the Tree) at college?" he
asked.
Duffy's current goal is to make
it to his milestone year: 1997. He
will celebrate his 60th wedding
anniversary in August of that
year. In September comes the
50th anniversary of living at
Stanford. And in November, the
100 th Big Game.
Until then? A lot of reading
and reminiscing.
"It's been a wild ride," Duffy
said. "There's no other place like
Stanford in the world. Period." ?

sett ling at a smaller cattle yard in
Fresno.
"Coming from a farm and
being in the cattle business is
something you don't get out of
your hide," Duffy said.
When World War II began,
Duffy wanted a communication
position in the army but didn't
pass the physical. Instead, he
went to work in Sausalito's ship
yards, where he first received
training in purchasing.
After the war, Duffy took a trip
to Stanford to visit his friend and
classmate, Alf Brandin, who
would later become Stanford's
provost. Since Stanford was with
out a purchasing agent for over
two years, Brandin saw an oppor
tunity. Duffy was hired.
The Duffys moved to Stanford
in April 1947 and settled on Sal
vatierra Street. One of Duffy's
first challenges as a purchasing
agent was furnishing Crothers
Memorial, the newest dorm on
campus. Duffy ordered the stu
dents' beds from a company in
Sheboygan, Wis., which soon
proved to be a mistake.
"Those guys thought Califor

nia was a suburb of L.A.," he said.
The beds were sent to Los
Angeles, where they got stuck
behind a special train that was car
rying Harry Truman. Duffy had to
send trucks down to rescue them.
He said he still remembers stu
dents sitting on the front steps of
Crothers, waiting for their beds.
Five years later, in September
1952, Duffy was struck with
polio. It was cruel timing, a year
before Salk's vaccine was devel
oped. Stanford supported Duffy
throughout his illness, however,
and he was soon well enough to
walk with a cane. In March 1953,
he returned to work, his two sec
retaries putting an arm each
around his shoulders and helping
him into the office each day.
Duffy's main responsibility
soon became purchasing equip
ment for the Medical Center. The
Center was located in San Fran
cisco until 1958, when it moved to
Stanford and incorporated Palo
Alto Hospital. Duffy marveled at
the Center's continued expansion
since then.
"In 1958 the school moved it
here," he said, "and the hammers
have never stopped since."
In the same year, the Duffys

moved to their current home at
762 Esplanada Way, where they
continued to raise their three
children. The children attended
Stanford Klementary School and
the Duffys* son, Tim, eventually
went to Stanford. Their daugh
ters went to San Jose State and
Berkeley.
"We wanted to spread the
wealth around," he joked about
sending a child to Stanford's
arch-rival.
Duffy said he remembered
when the kids used to run home
after school to go to Governor's
Corner, where the Duffys kept
three or four horses. They rode
the horses all over campus, from
the Red Barn and Lake Lagunita
to the present site of the Stanford
Shopping Center.
A photo of the three children
on their horses still hangs in the
front hall. Tim is on the family's
favorite, Chappo, a stocky white
horse. Chappo, who was pur
chased in the 1950s for just $35,
was over 33 vears old when he
died.
"He had no use for grown
ups," Duffy said. "But all the kids
on campus had rides on him."
When Duffv retired in the late

19605, he continued to live at
Stanford. To this day, he said he
can not imagine living anywhere
else. He and his wife think of
Stanford as their own giant park.
And what is Duffy's favorite spot
in that park?
"I suppose you should say the
church," Duffy said. "Hut I'd say
the stadium."
While there's no counting the
number of Big Games Duffy has
attended, his photo album is full
of pictures of him and Esther at
tailgate parties. He even shared
his thoughts on the Stanford
Tree.
"How would you like to spend
$25,000 a year to have your kid
Ibe the Tree) at college?" he
asked.
Duffy's current goal is to make
it to his milestone year: 1997. He
will celebrate his 60th wedding
anniversary in August of that
year. In September comes the
50th anniversary of living at
Stanford. And in November, the
100 th Big Game.
Until then? A lot of reading
and reminiscing.
"It's been a wild ride," Duffy
said. "There's no other place like
Stanford in the world. Period." ?
There are very few people left,
on campus who am boast of at
tending Big Game in 1930. Philip
Duffy is one of those people. He
even remembers the score.
"Stanford, 31-0," he said.
"We've never done it again,
though I've been waiting for it."
It was the first Big Game he
ever saw at the school which
would later become his alma
mater, his longtime employer
and home for almost 50 years.
Duffy, Class of '36, has lived on
campus since he became the Uni
versity's purchasing agent and
business manager of Tresidder
Union.
Even at 82, Duffy is quintes
sential Stanford, from his red
and-white checkered shirt to the
Stanford books that line his
shelves to the Cardinal bumper
sticker on his back door.
Duffy now sits in a chair that
was especially fitted for him. His
body is weak from post-polio syn
drome and he needs a walker and
some assistance to move around.
But his memory and wit were
sharp as he reminisced about the
university community he loves so
much.
A communication major,
Duffy became managing editor of
The Stanford Daily in the fall of
1935. His favorite issue was un

doubtedly the one that appeared
on April Fool's Day in 1936.
At that time, Duffy said, there
were many children suffering
from measles at Palo Alto Hospi
tal. The Daily wrote a front-page
story in bold face type announcing
t hat, due to t lie measles epidemic,
the Board of Trustees had voted
to close Stanford two weeks early.
By the time the ruse was uncov
ered, many students had already
packed to go home.
"Yes, that was a San Quentin
offense," Duffy said. "We were all
lucky we didn't get thrown out."
At the time he graduated from
Stanford, newspaper reporters
were earning $5 per week in San
Francisco. Although he was
promised a job at the Sacramento
Bee, he wanted to work closer to
Salinas, where his fiancee, a grad
uate of San Jose State, was teach
ing. Philip and Esther Duffy mar
ried in August 1937 and moved to
Manteca.
Soon, Duffy was back in the
business of his youth, running a
feed yard for cattle, following in
the footsteps of his father, who
had been the supervisor of a
2,500-acre state-owned ranch in
Napa Valley. Duffy worked 7,500
head of cattle at Manteca before
sett ling at a smaller cattle yard in
Fresno.
"Coming from a farm and
