# True Cardinal family reminisces about past half-century on campus
## 
### Dee-Ann Durbin 
There are very few people left,
on campus who am boast of at
tending Big Game in 1930. Philip
Duffy is one of those people. He
even remembers the score.
"Stanford, 31-0," he said.
"We've never done it again,
though I've been waiting for it."
It was the first Big Game he
ever saw at the school which
would later become his alma
mater, his longtime employer
and home for almost 50 years.
Duffy, Class of '36, has lived on
campus since he became the Uni
versity's purchasing agent and
business manager of Tresidder
Union.
Even at 82, Duffy is quintes
sential Stanford, from his red
and-white checkered shirt to the
Stanford books that line his
shelves to the Cardinal bumper
sticker on his back door.
Duffy now sits in a chair that
was especially fitted for him. His
body is weak from post-polio syn

But his memory and wit were

to close Stanford two weeks early.
By the time the ruse was uncov
ered, many students had already
packed to go home.
"Yes, that was a San Quentin
offense," Duffy said. "We were all
lucky we didn't get thrown out."
At the time he graduated from
Stanford, newspaper reporters
were earning $5 per week in San
Francisco. Although he was
promised a job at the Sacramento
Bee, he wanted to work closer to
Salinas, where his fiancee, a grad
uate of San Jose State, was teach
ing. Philip and Esther Duffy mar
ried in August 1937 and moved to
Manteca.
Soon, Duffy was back in the
business of his youth, running a
feed yard for cattle, following in
the footsteps of his father, who
had been the supervisor of a
2,500-acre state-owned ranch in
Napa Valley. Duffy worked 7,500
head of cattle at Manteca before
sett ling at a smaller cattle yard in
Fresno.
