### Frank Guinan Editorial staff 
Former Stanford Police officer
James Fitzhenry has filed .suit
against the University for wrongful
termination and violation of civil
rights after being discharged from
the Department of Public Safety
more than a year ago.
Fitzhenry claims in his suit that
he was fired because he testified in
favor of another former Stanford
Police officer, Gregory Hensel, who
was accused of stealing a television
set during a police search in 1992.
Hensel was later acquitted by a
jury of those charges with the help
of Fitzhenry's testimony.
According to a law brief filed by
Fitzhenry's attorney, Fitzhenry
"was warned a supervisor that if
Ihe] testified in a manner favorable
to Hensel, that [hej would suffer
reprisals and that his employment
with [Stanford| would be placed in
jeopardy."
The brief, filed Nov. 30 in Or
ange County Superior Court, also
states that prior to Fitzhenry's ter
mination he was harassed at work
and scrutinized excessively, con
ditions which Fitzhenry said were
stressful "to the point of being
nearly unbearable."
In addition to Stanford Univer
sity, the lawsuit also specifically
names Stanford Police Chief
Marv Herrington as one of the
defendants in the case.
"Part of the basis of the law

suit revolves around actions
taken by Herrington, which we
believe to be acts that violate basic
civil rights Fitzhenry has as a
public safety officer," said Seth
Kelsey, Fitzhenry's attorney.
"[Herrington| can be named and
held accountable."
Because of the harassment
Fitzhenry allegedly received, the
suit claims that he was forced to
miss a day or two of work. 1 le was
later denied worker's compensa
tion for the stress-related injury
he allegedly received while assist

ing Hensel.
When Fitzhenry applied for
disability retirement funds, the
suit states that Stanford rejected
the request based on the "mis
taken belief that as a 'private'
university, it may pick and
choose as it deems appropriate
those California statutory
employee-related provisions
relating to retirement and proce
dural due process."
The denial of disability retire
ment funds is in violation of the
Public Safety Officer's Bill or

Rights, the suit goes on to say.
This Bill of Rights is a section of
California governing law which
states the due process rights that
a safety officer has as a law
enforcing official.
"It states the rights a peace
officer has," said Kelsey. "It par
allels t he guarantees of every citi
zen."
Susan Hoerger, the attorney
handling the case for Stanford, is
currently on vacation and could
not be reached for comment.
A year before Fitzhenry was

fired from the department, he
had filed a complaint stating that
he was unfairly demoted,
harassed and treated unreason
ably when be requested sick
leave. The Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Department then
launched an investigation in
December 1993 into the com
plaints, but the matter didn't go
any further.
"It was totally cleared as far as
I can remember," said Michael
Roster, general counsel for the
University. He declined to say any

more about the matter, however.
"In employment matters, we are
really limited in what we can say,"
be added.
Herrington also declined to
comment, stating that personnel
issues had to be kept confiden
tial. He did confirm, however,
that Fitzhenry bad worked for
the department from 1987 to
1994.
Fitzhenry currently resides in
Southern California and works as
a private investigator. He could
not be reached for comment.
