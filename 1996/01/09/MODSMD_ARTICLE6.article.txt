Former Stanford Police officer
James Fitzhenry has filed .suit
against the University for wrongful
termination and violation of civil
rights after being discharged from
the Department of Public Safety
more than a year ago.
Fitzhenry claims in his suit that
he was fired because he testified in
favor of another former Stanford
Police officer, Gregory Hensel, who
was accused of stealing a television
set during a police search in 1992.
Hensel was later acquitted by a
jury of those charges with the help
of Fitzhenry's testimony.
According to a law brief filed by
Fitzhenry's attorney, Fitzhenry
"was warned a supervisor that if
Ihe] testified in a manner favorable
to Hensel, that [hej would suffer
reprisals and that his employment
with [Stanford| would be placed in
jeopardy."
The brief, filed Nov. 30 in Or
ange County Superior Court, also
states that prior to Fitzhenry's ter
mination he was harassed at work
