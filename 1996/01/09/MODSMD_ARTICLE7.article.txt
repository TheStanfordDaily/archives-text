# Former Delt house gets new occupants
## 
### Sara Southern Contributing writer 
The residents of the house for
merly known as Delta Tau Delta
moved in yesterday to 353 Cam
pus Drive, starting the quarter in
clean two-room doubles or singles
apparently untouched by the
Delts' last nights of partying.
Residents gushed over the
physical condition of the house. "I
haven't noticed any damage at
all," said senior Jennifer Pacheco.
Pacheco, who returned from San
tiago, ('bile, this quarter, adding
t hat the Delts left the house "look
ing good."

"It was really unfair that the
Delts were kicked out in the mid
dle of the year," said Susan Fish
man, a junior returningto campus
from the London School of Eco
nomics. "But I'm psyched because
I got good housing," she added.
Junior Jeremy Smith said the
housing was much better than
anything a mid-year walk-on
could expect.
Diana Conklin, associate direc
tor of Residential Education, said
she was "quite impressed" with
the condition of the house. "There
were some minor patches in paint
and a few small burn marks on
the cement in the inner court
yard, but all in all the state of the
house was a very pleasant sur
prise."
She added that Mark Lippert,
the chapter president, "did a
tremendously good job of closing
the house and was very conscien
tious in general."
Res Kd and Dean of Students
Marc Wais decided last quarter to
evict the Delts from their house
due to what Wais called "manage
ment issues."
Thi' Delts accrued $41,000 in
debts to the University during
their occupancy of the house.
Behavioral problems were also a
factor in the eviction, Wais said
last quarter.
According to Beth Schmid,
undergraduate housing assign
ment supervisor, members of the
fraternity had the option of
adding their names to the wait
ing list for housing. Schmid said
11 Delts joined the list, and the
rest either found off-campus

housing or no longer needed
housing.
Over half of the new residents
are students returning from
study abroad, said House Manag
er Jenny Scheuerlein.
Both Scheuerlein and Pro
gram Manager Jennifer Maynard
studied overseas. "I think the fact
that this house will have an inter
national flair is great," said May
nard. "I have lots of ideas for spe
cial programs if people are up for
it."
Residents seemed pleased with
the arrangement. Sara Sheriff, a
junior returning from Santiago,
said she is "positively excited"
about the opportunity to meet
new people.
"It's great because every
body's new to everybody else,"
said Sheriff. "It's not like we're
moving into a dorm where every
one's been here a quarter
already with established friend
ships. This is a good ice-break
er."
Smith agreed, adding that
"people returning from over
seas usually feel a little left out
in their new housing, but
clearly that won't be the case
here."
