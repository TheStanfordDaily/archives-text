# Native American gene could be key to origin
## 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
A group of Stanford researchers
has made an important discovery
about genetic markers that could
ultimately answer questions about
the migration and ancestry of an
cient peoples.
According to an article to Ik>
published today, the group found a
mutation on the Y chromosome —
found so far only in Native Ameri
cans — that could lead to a defini
tive answer to the mystery of

where Native Americans dwelled
before migrating to the Americas.
The finding is the result of a new
method of genetic scanning called
denaturing high-performance liq
uid chromatography (DHPLC).
"This discovery is very satisfy
ing," said Peter I nderhill, a Genet
ics Department research assistant
and lead author of the article, pub
lished in The Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences. "It
provides an important piece of the
puzzle of the people of the New
World.
"We are trying to find (hese pop
ulation-specific polymorphs,"
Underhill said. "Ifsuch a mutation
happens at a certain point in
human history, we can glean a lot
of neat information about migra
tion and the mixing between popu
lations."

According to the article,
researchers found a "polymorphic
C to T transition" on the Y chro
mosome distinctive to Native
Americans. Such a transition,
according to Underbill, happened
as the result of a harmless muta
tion in one person about HO,OOO
years ago.
"It is a simple point mutation,"
he said. "These mutations are
extremely rare. When they happen,
they happen only once in human
history, to one male, 'l'hat little
marker can be distributed geneti

cally to a lot of people. In this case,
we believe at least 30,000 years
ago, a man passed on a Y chromo
some with a mistake. That person
became the ancestor of a significant
proportion of Native Americans."
Underhill said that there is a
possibility that the mutation could
also be found in some untested
Asian peoples. Such a discovery
would essentially prove that Native
Americans originally came from
Asia.
"There is always a prospect that
they will find the T-allele I the

mutated portion of the chromo
some I back in Asia," he said.
"Maybe they will find an ancestral
stock population. That would be
neat."
Over the past six months, the
research team has found 10 such
mutations in various world popula
tions using DHPLC. Before the
invention of DHPLC by Underhill
and Biochemistry Department
researcher Peter Oefner, scientists
would have been lucky to find one
such mutation in a year, Underbill
said.

"It is like digging a hole with a
spoon as opposed to a shovel. We
think we invented the shovel," he
said, calling previous methods "dif
ficult to do both in time and effort."
"Prior to the invention of this
technique, we never would have
found 10 mutations in this time
frame," he said.
University of Arizona research
scientist Michael Hammer told the
Associated Press that while the
method used by Underbill and
Oefner is "potentially important,"
it needs to be reproduced in other

research laboratories.
Underbill said that be thinks
the method will catch on. "We have
added an important piece of the
puzzle. Other researchers will find
this marker to be valuable. We are
setting our sights on finding addi-
polymorphs."
Ultimately, Underhill said he
hoped that finding such genetic
mutations and variations could
allow scientists to build a compre
hensive family tree of humankind.
"We are all very enthusiastic
about this method," he said.
