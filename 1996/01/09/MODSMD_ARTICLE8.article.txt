A group of Stanford researchers
has made an important discovery
about genetic markers that could
ultimately answer questions about
the migration and ancestry of an
cient peoples.
According to an article to Ik>
published today, the group found a
mutation on the Y chromosome —
found so far only in Native Ameri
cans — that could lead to a defini
tive answer to the mystery of

where Native Americans dwelled
before migrating to the Americas.
The finding is the result of a new
method of genetic scanning called
denaturing high-performance liq
uid chromatography (DHPLC).
"This discovery is very satisfy
ing," said Peter I nderhill, a Genet
ics Department research assistant
and lead author of the article, pub
lished in The Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences. "It
