# Granted
## Med School nets award of $3.4M 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
The School of Medicine won a
four-year, $3.4 million grant yes
terday to establish an awards pro
gram for junior faculty and a fa
cility for making genetically-engi
neered mice.
The grant comes from the
Howard Hughes Medical Insti
tute, a research organization
based in Chevy Chase, Md. Stan
ford was one of 30 medical schools
selected to share $80 million in
grant money from the institute.
The grants are meant to help
schools maintain their research
infrastructure, as well as to assist
young faculty start their research
programs.
At Stanford, about $2.5 mil
lion of the grant money will be
used to develop junior faculty
scholars awards programs, said
Developmental Biology Prof.
David Clayton, chair of the com
mittee that submitted the grant
proposal. The program will pro
vide two-year, renewable awards
to seven or eight junior faculty
members each year, Clayton
said.
These awards will be of two
types, with the first aimed at aug
menting recruitment packages
for new faculty and the second in
tended to supplement the re
search of first-term assistant pro
fessors. Clayton said award recip
ients will be selected by spring.
This funding is especially im
portant in light of the increased
competition for federal research
monies today, Clayton said. Most
junior faculty members have in
vested 10 years in post-baccalau
reate study and work and"the
last thing we want is for them to
end up" without any funding for
their research projects, he said.
He complimented the institute
for recognizing that medical cen-
ters need this kind of assistance
or the renewability of their facul
ty research programs would be
jeopardized. "It's a very valuable
use of dollars," Clayton said.
The remaining $900,000 of
Stanford's grant money will be
used to establish and operate a
mouse embryo manipulation facil
ity, which will create genetically
engineered or transgenic mice.
Assoc. Pathology Prof. Michael
Clearv, who does research with

transgenic mice, said the new
facility will be used to "generate
mouse models for human dis
eases," including leukemia, other
malignancies and auto-immune
diseases. The facility will also
offer embryo freezing services so
that valuable transgenic mouse
lines can be preserved for future
researchers.
The facility should be open
within six months and two new
workers will be hired shortly
thereafter, Cleary said. The work
ers will be responsible for operat
ing (he technical, highly special
ized instruments.
David Jarmul, a spokesman for

the institute, said competition for
the grants was stiff. Proposals
came from 117 medical schools,
which the institute judged on
such criteria as scientific excel
lence and performance. There are
about 180 medical schools nation
wide.
The grants come at a time of
increased pressure on scientific
budgets. "Medical schools today
are under a lot of pressure due to
decreasing patient revenues com
bined with a tight, federal bud
get," Jarmul said.
The grants were awarded as
part of the institute's Research
Resources Program for Medical

Schools. Other medical schools
receiving awards include Har
vard, Johns Hopkins, Northwest
ern, Columbia, Duke, UCLA, UC-
San Francisco, IIC-San Diego and
USC. The schools, which are
located in 21 states, will each
receive between $550,000 and $1
million annually for four years.
The primary purpose of the
Howard Hughes Medical Insti
tute is to carry out biomedical
research. The institute employs
almost .'5OO researchers at 62 uni
versities and academic research
centers nationwide. Since 1988,
the institute has awarded $548
million in grants internat ionallv.
