The School of Medicine won a
four-year, $3.4 million grant yes

to seven or eight junior faculty
members each year, Clayton
said.
These awards will be of two

junior faculty members have in

last thing we want is for them to
end up" without any funding for
their research projects, he said.
He complimented the institute
for recognizing that medical cen-
