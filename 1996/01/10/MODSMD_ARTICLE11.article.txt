Budget talks break down
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Clinton and Republican
congressional leaders broke off budget talks yesterday, adding a
new element of doubt to their hunt for a compromise on elimi
nating the federal deficit by 2002 and cutting taxes.
After nearly two weeks of face-to-face White House negotiations,
the two sides said their sessions would pause for a week or more. But
they offered divergent interpretations of what the suspension means,
bringing new confusion to a year-long battle between Republicans
and the administration over paring the size and scope of government.
Clinton was upbeat, telling reporters at a news conference, "A
final agreement is clearly within reach."
He said the bargaining would halt until next Wednesday at the
latest, and said he had made a new ofTer to Republicans that nar
rowed their differences further. But he conceded, "It will require
some additional steps to bridge the gaps."
Republicans were less encouraging.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and House Speaker
Newt Gingrich of Georgia said the talks would recess for about seven
to 10 days and said they would await a new offer from Clinton.
Another hospital seized by Chechens
MOSCOW (AP) — Chechen rebels seized a hospital and took
2,000 people hostage yesterday in a southern Russian city, bat
t ling troops in the streets and threatening to "turn this city to hell
and ashes" if Russia doesn't pull its forces out of Chechnya.
At least 23 people were killed in the bold assault on Kizlyar, in
the republic of Dagestan, 60 miles northeast of the Chechen capi
tal of Grozny. It was the second time Chechen rebels stormed a
hospital and took hostages.
Early today, the rebels demanded buses so they could leave
with 300 of their hostages for Gudermes, Chechnya's second
largest city, a high-ranking Dagestani security official told the
Interfax news agency. The hostage-takers were still negotiating
with local officials.
Sarajevan peace disrupted
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) - A grenade blamed on
Bosnian Serbs landed in Sarajevo's notorious Sniper Alley yester
day, tearing a hole in a streetcar and in Bosnia's tentative peace.
One man was killed and at least 19 people were wounded.
The attack was the worst cease-fire violation since an Oct. 12
truce by Bosnia's warring factions, which signed a U.S.-brokered
peace agreement Dec. 14.
The attack may have been designed to test the resolve of troops
that replaced U.N. forces in the Bosnian capital three weeks ago.
It also marred modest celebrations marking the end of one of the
few U.N. successes of the Bosnian war — the longest aid airlift in
history.
The White House announced yesterday that President Clinton
would travel to Bosnia this weekend to visit American peacekeep
ing troops who are part of the 60,000-member NATO-led force
enforcing the peace accord.
