# Clinton vetoes GOP welfare plan
## President keeps promise; congressional majorities too slim for override 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Clinton,
just as he promised, yesterday vetoed a Repub
lican plan to overhaul the nation's primary
welfare programs and end the federal guaran
tee of aid to the poor.
Clinton complained in his veto message that
the Republican bill "does too little to move peo
ple from welfare to work," but said he was will
ing to work with Congress on a new version "to
enact real, bipartisan reform."
The House and Senate passed the bill the
week before Christmas, but by margins less
than the two-thirds majorities needed to over
ride Clinton's veto.
But Clinton waited until two weeks of
White House talks with Republicans over end
ing federal deficits by the year 2002 and simul
taneously cutting taxes broke down yesterday
before taking out his pen for the welfare bill
veto.
It was the 12th veto of Clinton's presidency.
Of the previous 11 vetoes, only one — on a
measure making it more difficult for investors
to bring class-action securities fraud suits

against companies — has been overridden by
Congress and become law.
The sweeping rewrite of the nation's 60-
year-old federal welfare system would have
replaced federal guarantees to the Aid to Fam
ilies with Dependent Children program with
block grants that could be used by the states to
fashion their own welfare plans.
A centerpiece of Republican House candi
dates' "Contract With America"in 1994, the
bill also would have capped the total amount of
federal funding for welfare over the next seven
years, with an estimated savings of $58 billion.
Republicans saw the bill as restoring the
work ethic and binding families closer togeth
er Democrats said they also support those val
ues but complained that the GOP measure
took away too much at the expense of children.
Clinton said he wanted a welfare reform
plan that is motivated by the urgency of
reform rather than by a "budget plan that is
contrary to America's values."
"The current welfare system is broken and
must be replaced, for the sake of the taxpayers

who pay for it and the people who are trapped
by it,"he said in his veto message. But the leg
islation is "burdened with deep budget cuts
and structural changes that fall short of real
reform."
He also said Congress should abandon
efforts to gut the Earned Income Tax Credit,
which he called a "powerful work incentive."
Clinton said the bill was designed to meet
an arbitrary budget target rather than to
achieve serious welfare reform, and would
make structural changes and budget cuts that
would fall hardest on children and undermine
states' ability to move people from welfare to
work.
He objected specifically to cuts in foster care
and adoption assistance, help for disabled chil
dren and legal immigrants, food stamps and
the school lunch program.
He said the final legislation should reduce
the magnitude of the budget cuts and the
structural changes in the vetoed bill that have
"little connection to the central goal of work
based reform."
