## Airports, roads reopen; more snow expected overnight, on weekend

IAP) — Crews digging the East
out after the Blizzard of '96 piled
the snow 15 feet high or dumped it
by the truckload into rivers yester
day as cabin fever set in among idled
workers and snowbound children.
"For the first time in my life I
felt like a prisoner. You couldn't
leave, you were a hostage here, a
hostage to the weather," said Jim
Vanstone, a traveler from Montreal
stuck for two days at Newark Inter
national Airport in New Jersey.
At least 95 deaths were blamed
on the storm that paralyzed much
of the East under 1 1/2 to 3 feet of
snow.
In New York, airline flights
Ix'gan arriving and taking off again
a.s runways were cleared of snow
drifts up to 20 feet high. Frustrated
commuters elbowed for space on
the few suburban trains running.

"Everyone looks a little dazed
today, like they really don't want to
be going where they are going," said
New York City transit police Sgt.
Thomas McNamara, surveying the
crowd in a Brooklyn subway sta
tion.
"I'm going home, baby, and I
ain't coming back," said Stefan
Kraus as he boarded a morning
flight from Philadelphia back home
to Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "Snow
blows."
Schools remained closed yester
day from northern Georgia to New
Hampshire. New York City's 1 mil
lion schoolchildren got another day
off — the first snow days ever in t he
lives of those kids who have always
lived in the city; New York's schools
last closed in 1978.
Many government offices and
businesses were closed for a second

day, but the Internal Revenue Ser
vice stirred itself to announce that
quarterly tax payments due from
residents of 15 snow-bound states
from North Carolina to Maine
could be sent in a week late.
A new but weaker storm headed
for the region; 3 to 5 inches was
possible overnight in Mas
sachusetts wit h light snow in New
York. Snow also fell again during
the day in Washington.
Still more snow could arrive this
weekend, hut it w.ls too soon to pre
dict how much.
Getting t he blizzard's 2 to 3 feet
of snow off sidewalks, streets, high
ways and runways was just the
beginning. For starters, where do
you put it?
Philadelphia city crews dumped
truckloads into the Schuylkill
River. Crews excavating New York

City's Rockefeller Center heaped it
up outside the "Today" show studio
and then trucked it to docks to lie
dumped into the Hudson River.
Trenton, N.J., scraped it up and
made a mountain out of a parking
lot at the Trenton Thunder base
ball stadium.
New York's Kennedy and
LaGuardia airports opened, as did
Newark. But the Port Authority,
which operates the metropolitan
area's three airports, said airline
service might not be back to normal
for two to three more days.
Washington's Dulles and
National airports reopened, as did
airports in Philadelphia and
Boston. Baltimore-Washington
International opened for 90 min
utes, shut down again as Hying
snow cut visibility, then reopened
five hours later.
