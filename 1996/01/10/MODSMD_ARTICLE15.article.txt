Students should get
an early start finding
summer internships

MANY STUDENTS return
to Stanford after a relax
ing Christmas break and
wish they were at home. Fall quar
ter, with its warm weather and fun
social activities, is history. It is
replaced by rain, colder weather
and the endless cycle of classes.
But rather than fall into a rut of
classes, students should also be
thinking about what they may
want to do this summer. Unfortu
nately, the sheltered life at Stan
ford will not last forever. Many
students, particularly freshmen,
will face the harsh realities of the
real world beyond Palm Drive
sooner than they may realize.
The inescapable reality for most
undergraduates is finding a sum
mer job — not any job, but a sum
mer position that can have an
impact on their future career
choice. The best medium for any
undergraduate to discover career
interests such as medical research,
financial management and crimi
nal law is an internship. Freshmen
can realize their future goals in life
by working for a private firm, the
government or a university during
the summer or school year.
An internship provides students
valuable experience and skills to
get a job after they graduate. In
most cases, graduates will receive
higher salaries and more job offers
if they have experience from
internships. An internship also
emphasizes the skills needed for a
real job after college.
But of course, the big problem
is landing one of those coveted
internships. Students here, as
precocious as they may be, are
competing in a pool which also
includes students from a host of
other elite institutions. Those

who are counting on name-brand
recognition to land them an
instant summer internship at
some investment bank or the
White House are naive. Unless
their parents are either well-con
nected or very wealthy, students
should start looking now for a
summer position. Those who
wait until the middle of spring
quarter to begin the process may
find themselves working at the
local fast-food establishment or
video-rental store for the sum
mer.
Any undergraduate can learn
more about internship opportuni
ties by visiting the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center. The
staff at the CPPC can assist stu
dents in the internship search
with counseling, workshops and
library resources. Students should
set up appointments now, as time
slots fill up quickly.
Students can also receive help
from the counselors at the Under
graduate Advising Center in Sweet
Hall. The center contains numer
ous resources on how to write a
cover letter and resume for an
internship.
Even if counselors are not avail
able, students should attend one of
the many seminars that the CPPC
holds on a regular basis. In addi
tion, there are reference binders
and books at the CPPC for stu
dents to contact alumni who work
in fields students may be interest
ed in exploring. Students can
reach alumni by going to the Bow
man Alumni House on campus
and contacting the alumni director
in a specific region.
Departments on campus also
keep track of internships in vari
ous fields of study. Campus career
fairs give students opportunities
to ask corporate representatives
about their employment experi
ences in various fields. Students
can also use the computer
database "Odyssey" to research
available internships.
So don't get lost in the shuffle.
Get help and apply now for a
rewarding summer experience.
