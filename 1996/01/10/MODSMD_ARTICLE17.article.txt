AI). What is Vulture Capitalism? A
slick opportunity for Stanford grads to
overwork while prostrating themselves
before Corporate Mecca, abandon morals
for a chance on the fast track of a plastic
life! Signing bonuses include faux fur
jacket and leather socks. If interested,
read the Sex Doctor's new book, "('ream
of the Crop."
OATQ. Silicon-soiled sternum sur
vivors support group will meet at the
Firehouse early this Saturday morning.
To attend the white boys foot-eating con
test meet in the quad at noon every day
next week. Eat, eat, eat and piutebt mul
ticulturalism.
Editorial. Dead white males kicked
again! Georgetown University recently
announced that students majoring in
English will no longer be required to read
the works of Milton, Chaucer or Shake
speare, so they might take classes that
are more "relevant" to their experiences.
Stanford should consider this proposal
(listen, L'Heroux) and modify English
requirements to better suit its students.
Perhaps these modifications may bo
appropriate: English — all works read
on-line; cartoon core — study the history
of comics from Archie Andrews to Marvel
Comics to Marmaduke (and of course,
graphic novels); and English etymology
— learn how this language creates its
own cultural empire, adopting words

from other languages while smothering
their existence.
Letter to the Editor. I've got a solu
tion to the walker / biker dynamic on
campus. Rip up all asphalt, save for a few
narrow paths. These paths will be used
by bikers. The rest will return to a more
natural state and be used by walkers.
Mountain bikers may also ride here in
the name of preserving the Stanford tra
dition of nailing unobservant, or too over
ly observant, freshmen. And get rid of the
pseudo-European "Do Not Walk On
Grass" signs in front of the Crown Quad.
What kind of bureaucratic fascism is
that? Beseechingly, Spark Nagel.
Column. It wasn't Gohlke; it wasn't
good.
Science Hug. Why does my nose run
when I eat spicy foods? Answer: When
the bite of jalapeno pepper hits the
tongue, sweat beads on the forehead, eyes
water, nose runs, and a sense of satisfac
tion and pleasure spreads throughout the
body. The chemicals in spicy foods, such
as hot mustard, ginger, black pepper,
horseradish, and chili peppers, contain
chemicals that trigger pain receptors in
the mouth. These receptors connect to
the trigeminal cranial nerve which reacts
to protect the body from chemical irri
tants such as smoke and tear gas. It
increases secretions to dilute the irritat
ing substances with saliva and mucous.
This flushing response can have a thera
peutic effect as the sinuses clear out in a
hurry.

Chemicals in spicy foods aren't dan
gerous, but the body behaves as if they
were. As a counteraction to the alarm,
the brain releases opiate-like chemicals,
such as endorphins. Could this be why so
many people are addicted to spicy foods?
Ad. Hey Daily Staffers! Guess who's
coming to visit? Felice Bennett, paper boy

biz! Bring your own plastic newspaper
bags, rubber bands and a limber shoul
der.

priate sport (Row and Coweil: billiards;

as well as electric personalities.
Ad. Inter-varsity, Hillel, and the Stan
ford Bookstore present: Meet author
