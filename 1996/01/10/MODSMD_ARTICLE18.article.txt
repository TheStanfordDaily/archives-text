Student feels his W grade was given unfairly

IN EARLY NOVEMBER, I happened
to break a bone in the side of my
foot. This unfortunate event obvi
ously interfered with my life here at
Stanford. 1 had to use crutches for over
a week, wear an orthopedic shoe for
more than a month and, most signifi
cantly, I had to discontinue a dance
class I was taking. There was no way
around it — I simply couldn't perform
the basic steps without pain, and my
doctor advised me not to push it any
way.
Being a freshman, I was uninitiated
in the ways of dropping a class. I soon
discovered that the drop deadline had
passed by a week, so I instead withdrew
from the class and at the same time
filed a petition to drop. I was confident
in the outcome of the petition — break
ing your foot is about as legitimate an
excuse as you can get, right? Wrong.

My petition was denied. I even app
ealed the case to the Subcommittee on
Exceptions to Academic Policy, but it
too rejected my petition. As Roger Print
up, the University Registrar, stated in a
letter sent to me (dated Dec. 1), "It (the
subcommittee) did not find your circurn
stances sufficiently compelling to set
aside University policy for dropping
courses after the deadline." An attempt
was made to ease my conscience,
though, with these comforting words:
"The subcommittee does not view the VV
grade as punitive in any way. It simply
reflects that you withdrew from the
course after the drop deadline."
I hope I'm not alone in finding this
decision outrageous. My question is
this: what constitutes "circumstances
sufficiently compelling . . . for dropping
courses after the deadline" if not an
incapacitating injury that directly

relates to one's ability to complete a
class? When I spoke with Assistant to
the Academic Standing Adviser Phil
Spitz asking what sort of petition would
be "sufficiently compelling," he could
think of none. Academic Standing
Adviser Teresa Nishikawa stated that
only in cases of a computer error would
a petition ever go through. I understand
that the new grading policy is designed
to get tough on dropping classes, but
denying perfectly legitimate claims is
ridiculous! Why even allow students to
petition to drop if they will always be
denied? Why have a Subcommittee on
Exceptions to Academic Policy when,
apparently, there arc none?
The subcommittee has rationalized
its decision by telling me that "the sub
committee does not view the W grade as
punitive in any way." I'm glad that it
doesn't see it as punitive, but that's cer

tainly not the prevailing opinion. The
Registrar's Office informed me of the
logic behind the new policy. Whereas
transcripts used to be regarded as mere
ly a record of achievement, they are now
meant to be a "historical record" of one's
academic career. Why should I be pun
ished for when I broke my foot? Had it
been one week earlier, I could have
dropped the class and avoided this
whole mess. Somehow, I don't see the
"historical" significance of that one
extra week.
This letter is intended as a warning
to fellow Stanford students. To save
others from repeating my experience, I
would like to convey the message which
the University has clearly sent to me:
You had better (literally) watch your
step.
