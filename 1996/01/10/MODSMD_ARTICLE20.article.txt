## A 						body's rancid reaction to freedom 
### 
Could you shut up for just five minutes ?
I'm making myself vulnerable here!
— My brother, while throwing up, New
Year's Day '96.
I WALKED HOME the long way from
my last final. Siuv'y strolling, I wan
dered by a tree that'd been very much
affected by the change in the seasons and
I lazily noted its leaves' colors. I took the
moist, sweet winter air into my lungs and
then I threw up for about 15 minutes.
It was a tsunami-style reverse peristal
sis the likes of which perhaps even God
has not seen. I evacuated everything I'd
eaten in three weeks. It was fairly
unpleasant.
So I wiped my chin on a scarf I didn't
like much and made my way home, cough
ing violently the whole way. And then I
noticed a pain in my groin. I threw up
again and subsequently found — to my
complete horror — that my left testicle
had ascended.
All this just after handing in a blue
book — my last bluebook ever, actually.
You see, I am finished with classes.
Save a five-unit seminar and my honor's
thesis, I have nothing left to do here as an
undergraduate. No classes. No lecture
notes. No defending some argument on a
book I haven't readjust to keep awake in
section.
Nothing to do for the rest of the year

but plan out the rest of my life.
And the first thing my body thought to
do in the face of this newfound freedom
was puke.
And then, as I've mentioned, my testi
cle ascended. Crawled halfway up from
whence it came, as if to hide from this
thing called "a future" — that awful ogre
whole lurks just beyond and to the left of
the comforts of the undergraduate rou
tine.
Now clearly — aside from relegating
my plans for a romantic weekend with my
new honey to Disney movies and sensual
(though unconsummated) massages
this array of ailments had me bothered.
Worried. For my spiritual well-being as
well as for the contents of my package.
Still, I resolved to wait a few days at
home and see if things corrected them
selves. I didn't have time for a doctor
unless this became an emergency; after
all, I had my resume to write and a stack
of grad school applications to fill out.
Of course, things got worse.
Within three days, I stopped needing to
shave regularly; my characteristic scruff
ceased to flow. My clothes started feeling
quite loose; I thought I'd lost weight, but
in truth I felt smaller, shorter. Even my
voice had risen almost an octave. Soon I
found myself craving a Rubik's Cube and
"You Can't Do That on Television" re
runs. I took on a fondness for drinking

warm milk while watching my mother get
dressed. It was like puberty in reverse,
except my hairline didn't budge.
I declared emergency status. Some
thing was happening to me, and it
couldn't be anything good. (My doctor
suggested it might be trichinosis until I
explained that the jaw pain I'd com
plained of was probably the result of rela
tional overcompensation, not my malady.)
But nothing organic could be found.
And thus I was left to consider my condi
tion of physical regression, to ponder why
my body might yearn so deeply for its ear
lier states that it was willing to undo the
work it'd done rather painstakingly
through puberty.
In my emotional panic I couldn't dis
cern what had provoked all this. What
was so different in my life? What had
changed?
Finally, one afternoon, while playing
Atari, the obvious occurred to me:
Perhaps my symptoms were not a
product of some physical ailment but of
my ontological state: the near graduate.
Yes, perhaps my body was outwardly
manifesting some internal desire to revert
to a less advanced state, to my early youth
a time when I owed nothing to matu
rity.
Of course! I had already resisted in
every way the transition to adulthood.
Hut there were no ways out. Coterming is

behind me as an option, a sixth year is
downright socially unacceptable and the
position of full-time tour guide has
already been usurped by my old room
mate, the bastard.
I am now obliged not only to decide
what to do with the rest of my stupid life,
but to go ahead and do it! I am now
responsible to become all the things I've
ever said I wanted to lx? — be it a fireman,
or a psychologist or an author or a third
world despot or one of those guys on the
"Saturday Night Live" writing staff who
makes other people do his photocopying.
And if anything on that grand list
doesn't come to pass some time soon, I
won't have my academic responsibilities
to blame for it. Not anymore.
Handing in my final final — the last of
my fully-registered, undergraduate career
— then being faced with applications and
my resume must have made me, at least
subconsciously, excruciatingly aware of
the magnitude of all this liberty.
Of course I hurled.
And then, as if to hoodwink fate from
noticing me as a new candidate for failure,
as a being ensconced in his own agency,
my body tried to camouflage itself as a
pre-adolescent — as if to say, "Hey,
instead of the whole of me rising, how
'bout just a nut?"
Well, clearly this wouldn't work. Des
tiny, future, fate — these are not things

so easily fooled. And I had no intention of
going on into the world as a frightened,
uni-testicled sixth-grader look-alike.
But then, strangely, immediately, my
body began its return to normal. After
recognizing Profound Fear® as my life's
new copilot, I became actual size again.
The thickets of body hair resumed their
places and I once again lost the rather
lovely singing voice I had at my Bar Mitz
vah. (Epiphany goes a long way in psycho
somatic illness.)
Oh, and yes, all is quiet on the South
ern front as well — even my testicle found
its familiar nest after being goaded back
down the inguinal canal by my doctor's
gentle, albeit insistent, forefinger.
Unfortunately, however, realization
wasn't enough to quell anxiety and now I
am faced with my new dread of the future.
It's real and it's insistent and it's perva
sive.
But I guess from now on I'll just have
to plan my life without throwing up.
Because Freudian symptomology doesn't
blend well with success and, more impor
tantly, because I don't think I could han
dle puberty a third time.

Michael Green's inner child is currently
enjoying the two feet of New York snow,
but his grown-up persona hopes to get out
of the airport.

doesn't come to pass some time soon, I
won't have my academic responsibilities
to blame for it. Not anymore.
Handing in my final final — the last of
my fully-registered, undergraduate career
— then being faced with applications and
my resume must have made me, at least
subconsciously, excruciatingly aware of
the magnitude of all this liberty.
Of course I hurled.
And then, as if to hoodwink fate from
noticing me as a new candidate for failure,
as a being ensconced in his own agency,
my body tried to camouflage itself as a
pre-adolescent — as if to say, "Hey,
instead of the whole of me rising, how
'bout just a nut?"
Well, clearly this wouldn't work. Des
tiny, future, fate — these are not things

so easily fooled. And I had no intention of
going on into the world as a frightened,
uni-testicled sixth-grader look-alike.
But then, strangely, immediately, my
body began its return to normal. After
recognizing Profound Fear® as my life's
new copilot, I became actual size again.
The thickets of body hair resumed their
places and I once again lost the rather
lovely singing voice I had at my Bar Mitz
vah. (Epiphany goes a long way in psycho
somatic illness.)
Oh, and yes, all is quiet on the South
ern front as well — even my testicle found
its familiar nest after being goaded back
down the inguinal canal by my doctor's
gentle, albeit insistent, forefinger.
Unfortunately, however, realization
wasn't enough to quell anxiety and now I
am faced with my new dread of the future.
It's real and it's insistent and it's perva
sive.
But I guess from now on I'll just have
to plan my life without throwing up.
Because Freudian symptomology doesn't
blend well with success and, more impor
tantly, because I don't think I could han
dle puberty a third time.

Could you shut up for just five minutes ?
I'm making myself vulnerable here!
— My brother, while throwing up, New
Year's Day '96.
I WALKED HOME the long way from
my last final. Siuv'y strolling, I wan
dered by a tree that'd been very much
affected by the change in the seasons and
I lazily noted its leaves' colors. I took the
moist, sweet winter air into my lungs and
then I threw up for about 15 minutes.
It was a tsunami-style reverse peristal
sis the likes of which perhaps even God
has not seen. I evacuated everything I'd
eaten in three weeks. It was fairly
unpleasant.
So I wiped my chin on a scarf I didn't
like much and made my way home, cough
ing violently the whole way. And then I
noticed a pain in my groin. I threw up
again and subsequently found — to my
complete horror — that my left testicle
had ascended.
All this just after handing in a blue
book — my last bluebook ever, actually.
You see, I am finished with classes.
Save a five-unit seminar and my honor's
thesis, I have nothing left to do here as an
undergraduate. No classes. No lecture
notes. No defending some argument on a
book I haven't readjust to keep awake in
section.
Nothing to do for the rest of the year

but plan out the rest of my life.
And the first thing my body thought to
do in the face of this newfound freedom
was puke.
And then, as I've mentioned, my testi
cle ascended. Crawled halfway up from
whence it came, as if to hide from this
thing called "a future" — that awful ogre
whole lurks just beyond and to the left of
the comforts of the undergraduate rou
tine.
Now clearly — aside from relegating
my plans for a romantic weekend with my
new honey to Disney movies and sensual
(though unconsummated) massages
this array of ailments had me bothered.
Worried. For my spiritual well-being as
well as for the contents of my package.
Still, I resolved to wait a few days at
home and see if things corrected them
selves. I didn't have time for a doctor
unless this became an emergency; after
all, I had my resume to write and a stack
of grad school applications to fill out.
Of course, things got worse.
Within three days, I stopped needing to
shave regularly; my characteristic scruff
ceased to flow. My clothes started feeling
quite loose; I thought I'd lost weight, but
in truth I felt smaller, shorter. Even my
voice had risen almost an octave. Soon I
found myself craving a Rubik's Cube and
"You Can't Do That on Television" re
runs. I took on a fondness for drinking

warm milk while watching my mother get
dressed. It was like puberty in reverse,
except my hairline didn't budge.
I declared emergency status. Some
thing was happening to me, and it
couldn't be anything good. (My doctor
suggested it might be trichinosis until I
explained that the jaw pain I'd com
plained of was probably the result of rela
tional overcompensation, not my malady.)
But nothing organic could be found.
And thus I was left to consider my condi
tion of physical regression, to ponder why
my body might yearn so deeply for its ear
lier states that it was willing to undo the
work it'd done rather painstakingly
through puberty.
In my emotional panic I couldn't dis
cern what had provoked all this. What
was so different in my life? What had
changed?
Finally, one afternoon, while playing
Atari, the obvious occurred to me:
Perhaps my symptoms were not a
product of some physical ailment but of
my ontological state: the near graduate.
Yes, perhaps my body was outwardly
manifesting some internal desire to revert
to a less advanced state, to my early youth
a time when I owed nothing to matu
rity.
Of course! I had already resisted in
every way the transition to adulthood.
Hut there were no ways out. Coterming is

behind me as an option, a sixth year is
downright socially unacceptable and the
position of full-time tour guide has
already been usurped by my old room
mate, the bastard.
I am now obliged not only to decide
what to do with the rest of my stupid life,
but to go ahead and do it! I am now
responsible to become all the things I've
ever said I wanted to lx? — be it a fireman,
or a psychologist or an author or a third
world despot or one of those guys on the
"Saturday Night Live" writing staff who
makes other people do his photocopying.
And if anything on that grand list
doesn't come to pass some time soon, I
won't have my academic responsibilities
to blame for it. Not anymore.
