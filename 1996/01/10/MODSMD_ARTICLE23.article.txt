## Chronic heartburn need not be a chronic problem Quiting smoking, fewer beers, less caffeine: Those New Year's resolutions can help ease the pain 
### Alison Davis Contributing writer 
Heartburn is a sensation we are all too familiar with after
indulgent holiday feasting. Like lava emanating from the base
of a volcano, powerful stomach acids flow back 112 rom the stom
ach into the esophagus, or swallowing tube, leading to a painful
burning sensation in the throat.

The acid's backward journey from the stomach is called gastroe
sophageal reflux (GER), and is experienced by nearly 100 million
people nationwide on a regular basis, according to Dr. David Utley
of Stanford's Head and Neck Surgery division. In fact, every
one experiences reflux several times a day without

knowing it.
Utley has written a new book, "Stop the Heartburn,"
that addresses the needs of the many victims of gastroe
sophageal reflux disease (GERD). The book has just been
released at several bookstores in the Bay Area.

Large numbers of patients — around 20 percent of those *
who walk into the ear, nose and throat clinic complain of
symptoms such as sore throat, change in voice, sour taste or
chronic cough, to name a few. This prompted Utley to
write his book, which advocates diet and lifestyle
changes as a first line of attack against GERD. . J

Utley emphasized that "Stop the Heartburn" calls
for simple changes in lifestyle as initial therapy for
GERD, as opposed to expensive drugs like Zantac
which are very effective but expensive. "The cost of
two days of Zantac pays for the cost of the book," i
Utley said. /

Drug-free therapy is an especially attractive
option for a large contingent of GERD patients.
Elderly patients are prone to GERD due to
decreased saliva production, which normally
helps wash down the acid. This population of
patients may already be taking handfuls of medi
ent ion Hnilv

c;u lUII uauy. \ "
The same holds for pregnant women, who have\
high levels of progesterone in their blood circulation.
This hormone relaxes gastrointestinal sphincters

and promotes the backflow of stomach acid.
Heartburn is a common but annoying symptom
of pregnancy, more so since expectant mothers
should avoid medicines when possible.
Dietary modifications and relatively simple
lifestyle adjustments — reducing coffee, alcohol

and tobacco use, and raising the head at night — are the "cor
nerstone of the therapy," according to Utley. His wife Kather
ine, a Stanford dietitian, collaborated on the project and wrote
a chapter on specific dietary recommendations — including
sample recipes.
Utley said that at first he was slightly uncomfortable about

recommending his own book to patients,
but "my attending (physicians] have
given it their vote of confidence."

Ted Slosberg, assistant profes
sor at the Medical School's
Division of Gastroenterology,
also recommended the book as
a source of general guidelines
ana information that patients
can read with relative ease.

In a busy clinic — as most are
— physicians have little time to
spend discussing non-drug thera
py and lifestyle changes with their

' patients. "Stop) the Heartburn"
helps physicians by allowing them to
recommend or prescribe the book to

patients so that they can become better

/informed about GERD.
But Slosberg cautioned that the book is not a

/ substitute for a doctor. "Patients with ongoing,
recurrent problems should consult their physician

' before making any changes, and medications should
not be discontinued without their doctor's OK."
Prescription drugs, like Zantac, which block stomach

acid secretion, do work to completely control the symptoms of
GERD. So why should a patient change his or her lifestyle and diet
when they can simply take a pill?

'In the 1980s, that type of thinking worked," said Utley. However, in
today's penny-pinching health care environment, in which insur
ance companies exert more and more control over dollars spent,
patients do not always have the luxury of a choice.
So what's a patient to do? According to Slosberg, the lifestyle

and dietary interventions advocated in "Stop the Heart
burn" can virtually eliminate heartburn for most people
with mild to moderate symptoms. In more serious cases,
drugs or surgery can be a very effective mode of treat
ment. A couple of post-burrito antacids every now and
then can also be a great help for an occasional bout of
heartburn, he added.
