# Straight out of sci-fi: life on Mars?

Life on Mars? No, this isn't sci
ence fiction, hut don't go packing
your magnifying glass and butter
fly traps yet. According to a new
study by Geophysics Prof. Nor
man Sleep, Mars was a better
environment for life to develop
than the Earth, at least for a time.
Kevin Zahnle of NASA's Ames
Research Facility co-authored the
study, which Sleep presented at a
Dec. 12 meeting of the American
Geophysical Union.
According to Sleep, Mars' rela
tively small amount of surface
water made it easier for organisms
to survive the impact of large
meteors that were common
between 4.5 and 3.8 billion years
ago.
Sleep and Zahnle calculated
the effects of impacts with large
asteroids and comets, objects
ranging between 70 and 400 kilo
meters in diameter. A collision
with a 70-kilometer meteor would
have released enough energy to
vaporize all the water in the lakes

Mars once had, while it would
take a 400 kilometer meteor to
vaporize Earth's oceans.

Having more surface water
would seem to be helpful to life
under most circumstances, but
water's capacity to store heat also
acted to keep the Earth hotter for

a greater period of time after a
monstrously powerful slam with a
meteor.
Mars' water, once vaporized,
could condense hack in only about
25 years, while the Earth would
bake budding life forms for about
500 years. Even if hit by a 400
kilometer meteor, Mars would
still cool after only 25 years. The
heat not absorbed in water evapo
ration would be lost quickly into
space.
Lifeforms on the surface of
either planet would not have sur
vived a minute, let alone 25 years,
after a large meteor impact. How
ever, fissures far below the sur
face might have sheltered organ
isms until the water returned, due
to the fact that rock is poor at
transferring heat. "The surface of
Mars was a dangerous place to
live. But the subsurface was safe
even from large impacts," said
Sleep.
Some organisms in surface
rocks might have gotten blown
out of the atmosphere by the
meteor impact, falling back years
later — or even reaching other

planets. These organisms could
potentially have survived in outer
space for up to 25 years. Scientists
have been able to identify some
meteor remnants found on Earth
as pieces of Mars.
In a scenario straight out of the
classic sci-fi film "The Andromeda
Strain," evidence suggests that
meteors like these could have
transported Martian viruses or
bacteria to Earth.
Sleep's new study comes at a
time of renewed interest in explor
ing Mars — the United States,
Russia, Japan and the European
Space Agency all plan to search for
life on the Earth's red neighbor,
despite the failures of two recent
Mars probes and the disappoint
ing revelation in 1976 that Mar
tian soil is unfit to support life.
The four space agencies plan to
send unmanned missions every
two years for the next 20 years,
some with the capability of send
ing samples back to Earth.
Depending on how these missions
go, humans might be taking their
first steps on Mars sometime after
2020.

According to Prof. Norman Sleep, the rocky surface of Mars — shown here via a telescopic camera aboard the Viking I — might have shel
tered organisms from heat created by the impact of huge meteors billions of years ago, due to the poor conductive qualities of the surface
materials.
