Q. How does a football fly
• without wobbling?
A Over the weekend, I
• got together with some
• of my bug buddies to
watch the football games on
the tube. Needless to say, it was
amazing to see some of the
league's best athletes in action,
and some — I'm not even going
to mention the names of some
specific members of the Boys of
Rod and Gold Tights — in inac
tion.
Now that 1 have completely
recovered from my post-49ers
humiliation, I feel the need to
return to the game of football
— for, as I keep telling myself,
it is only a game — and look at
the sport from a more objective
and clinical standpoint.
Which brings us to this
week's ponderous question.
Ever wonder how those NFL
quarterbacks throw the ball so
well? I mean, the pigskin just
zips through the air without a
wobble, a perfectly symmetric
spiral aimed straight at the
numbers. So the question is:
How do you throw a football in
a perfect spiral? Well, the bug
has analyzed all the aerody
namics of the game, and come
up with just the tips you —
Troy Aikman — need.
The easiest way to figure out
how to throw a football straight
is to look at the motion of a
well-thrown football — back
wards. Once a football is
already flying, it just keeps on
going, until it hits the ground.
No surprises here — it's simply
good ol' gravity.
Of course, how far the ball
actually goes depends on how
hard it's thrown, but there's
more to it. The football spins
while it's flying. This spin is
absolutely crucial — it keeps
the ball steady in flight. If the
ball is not thrown well, it will
have a tendency to wobble.
If the ball does wobble from
side to side, even if it's still
spinning, it won't go quite as
straight or far. The wobbling
slows down the ball by increas
ing its air resistance. A nice
tight spiral keeps the shaking
down to a minimum, allowing
the ball to slice through the air
like a missile, squishing inno
cent hitch-hiking bugs like me
along the way.
Okay, okay! — Enough of the
physics. So how in the world do

you throw the ball with a nice
spin anyway? After all, a foot
ball is not exactly round. Well, it
isn't really so difficult. I mean,
the whole idea is to throw the
ball with lots of spin and no
wobble.

What makes a football
slightly more complicated to
throw than say, a baseball, is
that the football has only one
axis around which to spin —
only one axis that allows for a
nice spiral. A baseball, on the
other hand, can be pitched
around any of an infinite num
ber of axes.
So, here's the bug's take on
the classic description of how to
throw the pigskin, step-by-step.
First, stand with your feet com
fortably spread apart. Pretend
there's a shelf right behind you
on the playing field. The foot
ball is in a little slot on this
shelf at the level of your head
and just off to the side.
With your back to the shelf,
you reach your arm back while
twisting your trunk — and pull
the ball off the shelf. Next, step
forward with your left foot (if
you're right-handed), so all
your weight flows forward.
This forward movement is the
source of your accuracy.
Then, untwist your torso,
uncurl your shoulders, and bring
your arm forward. The motion is
the same as if you were trying to
kill a peskv fly with a fly-swatter.
Finally, snap your wrist straight
down and around the outside of
the pigskin. This will provide the
perfect rotation. Oh! Don't for
get to hold the ball correctly —
with the middle finger across the
first lace.
Voila! You know how to
throw a perfect football spiral.
Who knows, with enough prac
tice, one of you loyal bug fans
out there will be the next John
Elway or Steve Young. Till then,
this is the Science "Showtime"
Bug. See you in the end zone.
