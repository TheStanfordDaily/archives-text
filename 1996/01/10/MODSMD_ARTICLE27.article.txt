### Sara Southern Contributing writer 
At last night's brief ASSU meeting, senator
Bill Shen addressed the issue of selecting the
new Nominations Commission chair.
Shen said the process for selecting the com
mission chair would be "very organized and
thorough," after going through the standard
approval of minutes and reports of committee
chairs.
The need to hire a new chair arose at the end
of fall quarter when former chair Scott Wein-

traub resigned, saying he felt unethical pressure
from Council of Presidents members to select
certain student representatives to University
committees.
E-mails will be going out to numerous lists
and advisers of student groups on campus will
be given the opportunity to nominate candi
dates, said Shen. He added newspaper adver
tisements will also be published within the next
two weeks announcing the availability of the
position.
Interviews will be conducted in the first or
second week of February.

"We're going to be very careful this time
around about (selecting a chair for the commis
sion!," said Shen.
In other business, Shen stud he will also l>e
meeting with Undergraduate Residence Facili
ties Manager Diana Conklin soon to discuss the
possibility of additional bicycle parking on cam
pus.
The senate also approved their winter quar
ter schedule. University President Gerhard
Casper will address the senate Jan. 23 and
Provost Condoleezza Rice will speak on a date to
Ik* announced.
