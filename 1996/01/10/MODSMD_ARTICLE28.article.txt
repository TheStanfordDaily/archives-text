## Women's hoops must fight off injuries to start Pac-10 No. 6 Cardinal women's basketball seeks back-to-back titles, seventh crown in eight 
### Hobby Cuza Staff writer 
Bruised but not beaten, the sixth
ranked Stanford women's basketball
team (9-2 overall, 2-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) limped into Pac-10 play last
weekend and emerged with convincing
wins at Arizona and Arizona State. But
as they approach their Pac-10 home
opener this Thursday against UCLA,
the biggest question facing the Stan
ford women is whether they can sur
vive a grueling nine-week conference
schedule despite a recent rash of
injuries that has sidelined three of the
Cardinal's top six players.
"|The losses I affect us most in our
depth," said head coach Amy Tucker of
injuries to junior Jamila Wideman,
senior Bobbie Kelsey and sophomore
I leather Owen. "We have to play smart.
We have to stay out of foul trouble."
Serving in place of the departed Tara
VanDerveer, who left her post as
women's head coach to oversee the
1996 Olympic Team, Tucker has guided
the Cardinal to a 7-2 non-conference
record â€” highlighted by a 90-72 upset
of then-No. 2 Tennessee on Dec. 16
and a 2-0 start in Pac-10 play. But the
women haven't gotten by without their
share of casualties.
Wideman, the team's starting point
guard, has sat out the last two games
with a sprained ankle. She is listed as
day-to-day. Owen, a 6-foot-2 cen
ter / forward and the Cardinal's first
woman off the bench, was establish
ing herself as a valuable inside
weapon before suffering a stress frac
ture in her left foot. According to
Tucker, Owen could see limited action
in Saturday's game against USC.
Kelsey's injury is the most serious of
the three. The fifth-year senior for
ward, who serves as team co-captain
along with Wideman, started the
team's first 10 games before falling
prey to an injury to her right knee. An
MRI exam performed Monday revealed
damage in her anterior cruciate liga
ment. Kelsey is scheduled to undergo
arthroscopic surgery on Thursday, at
which time her status for the remain
der of the season will bo determined.

Tucker said the team will miss
Kelsey's defensive presence more than
anything. "She's been playing really
well lately, putting a lot of pressure on
people defensively," she said. "We'll
miss that for sure."
Junior point guard Charmin Smith
has taken over the reigns of the offense
in Wideman's absence, playing nearly
40 minutes in last week's wins over the
Wildcats (9-1, 1-1) and Arizona State
(4-7, 0-2). To compensate for the loss of
Kelsey, sophomore Vanessa Nygaard
has moved into the 3 position, with
sophomores Naomi Mulitauaopele and
Olympia Scott rounding out the front
court. With 6-2 junior Kate Starbird at
the off-guard position, the Cardinal
boasts three starters 6-2 or taller.
"In terms of our starting lineup, it's
very solid," Tucker said.
"Solid" has proved to he an under
statement considering the women's
lopsided 77-55 win over previously
unbeaten Arizona at the Wildcats'
McKale Center last Saturday. That tri
umph followed the Cardinal's 88-71
drubbing of the Sun Devils in Tempo on
Thursday.
"I thought people really stepped up
without two starters and our sixth
player," Tucker said.
Starbird, the team's most talented
player, was on fire in last weekend's
contests. Against ASU, she poured in
24 points while grabbing eight
rebounds and dishing out six assists. At
Arizona, she scored 27 points, pulled
down five boards and added four
assists. She currently leads the team in
scoring with 18.8 points per game.
With Wideman and Owen listed as
day-to-day and Kelsey out indefinitely
as the women embark on conference
play, Starbird and Co. must continue to
step up if Stanford is to succeed in cap
turing its seventh Pac-10 champi
onship in eight years.
"We have a young team," Tucker
said. "They are the defending Pac-10
champions, so that helps keep people
focused a little bit. We have some really
intense people who are hungry. They
were on the team last year, but now
they're an integral part of the team and
it's really up to them."

Oregon State stands as the most
likely candidate to loosen the Cardi
nal's stranglehold on Pac-10 suprema
cy. Led by 6-2 senior forward Tanja
Kostic, the upstart Beavers (9-1, 1-0)
have worked their way up to a No. 11
ranking after returning all five starters
from a 1994-95 squad that handed
Stanford its only conference loss last
season. Kostic, last year's Pac-10 Play
er of the Year and the conference's fifth
all-time leading scorer, currently aver
ages 25.6 ppg to go along with 11.3
rebounds per game. Both figures top
the conference.
"Oregon State is going to be very,
very tough to beat," Tucker said.
Oregon won't prove much easier.
The Ducks (8-3, 0-1), who lost a 59-58
squeaker to OSU in Corvallis last Fri
day, are looking for a third-straight
appearance in the NCAA tournament
under head coach Jody Runge. Junior
forward Arianne Bowyer (18.2 ppg, 8.1
rpg) and 6-3 senior center Renae
Fegent (13.1 ppg) spearhead the Ore
gon squad.
Washington could pose another seri
ous challenge to Stanford. The Huskies
(8-5, 2-0) finished 25-9 last season,
landed a second-place finish in the con
ference and won two games in the
NCAA tournament. They lost most of
their scoring, rebounding and assists
from last year's squad but have proven
themselves a formidable foe while
stringing together a five-game winning
streak entering this weekend's series
against the Oregon schools.
"The Pac-10 is tough this year,"
Tucker said. "It's probably as tough as
it has been in maybe four or five years
in terms of overall parity."
USC (5-6, 0-2) also sought to adver
tise itself as a serious contender in the
Pac-10, but t he Trojans have fizzled in
the early going. Coach Fred Williams'
troops were embarrassed in their open
ing game by Oklahoma State 85-55 and
stumbled in home losses to Washing
ton and Washington State last week
end. USC will visit the Cardinal at
12:30 p.m. on Saturday at Maples
Pavilion.

Sophomore center Olympia Scott finds herself surrounded by Lady Vols, but the Car
dinal managed to upset then-No. 2 Tennessee.
UCLA, meanwhile, brings a 6-5
record (1-1 Pac-10) into Thurs
day's 7 p.m. meeting with Stan
ford at Maples. The Bruins, who
finished a disappointing eighth in
the conference last season, could
cause matchup problems with 6-5
senior Zrinka Kristich and 6-4
Kisa Hughes in the frontcourt.
UCLA has enough talent to
fight its way out of the bottom
half of the conference this season,
but the same can't be said for Cal
(5-6, 1-1) and Washington State
(9-3, 1-1), who will battle the Ari
zona schools to keep out of the
conference cellar this season. Cal
has won four of its last six, but the
Bears will have to overcome a sig
nificant lack of experience to
remain competitive.
The same story applies to Ari
zona, the Pac-10's youngest team.
WSU is off to a strong start at 9-3,
but don't look for the Cougars to
repeat last year's success, when
they just narrowly missed the
NCAA tournament. And don't
count on ASU bettering last
year's 2-16 conference mark.
Add it all up, and there's a well
balanced, highly-competitive con
ference race with four or five
teams leading the pack.
"It's huge in terms of the post
season," Tucker said when asked
about the importance of a Pac-10
title. "You have to do well in your
conference games to get a great
seeding lin the NCAA tourna
ment | and hopefully play at home.
"This is the season right now.
This is what you're really working
for."
