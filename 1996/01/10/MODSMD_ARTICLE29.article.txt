While much of the nation huddled around fireplaces
over winter break, Hawaii felt the heat of a new and
improved Stanford men's crew team.
From Jan. 3-7, the Cardinal competed in the Hawaiian
Henley, and in a performance exceeding all expectations,
Stanford tied for first place.
Participants in the regatta included Stanford, Califor
nia, Harvard, Japan's Kyoto University and Washington
State, its well as several local and alumni teams. Senior
team captain Robert Biggler, seniors Barrett Adams,
Grant Dawson and Jason Hool, juniors Matt Miller and
Mark Thomas and sophomores Jamie MacQuarrie and
Matt Jolly represented Stanford. Senior Eva Kim rounded
out the squad at coxswain.
The race united the rowers as well as demonstrated
their abilities. "It showed us we could really move the
boat," Biggler said. "One of the best parts was that it drew

the team together."
The Henley consisted of four days of regular competi
tion, which each team raced two other teams. Points were
awarded for each day's performance and the top three
teams continued to the final day of racing. A single day of
racing involved a 1,000 meter race followed by a 500 meter
race.
Over the four-day span, Stanford won all but one of its
eight races. The team's record entering the final races
raised eyebrows: 4-0 versus California, 4-0 versus Wash
ington State and 1 -1 versus Harvard. At. that juncture, the
Cardinal held first place with 23 points, followed bv Har
vard (21 points) and Cal (19).
These top-three teams competed in the final round on
Sunday under intense weather conditions. Heavy winds
required extra caution on the water. In the 1,000 meter
race, Stanford and Harvard quickly pulled away from Cal.
The Cardinal and the Crimson stayed close until the end,
