## Bloomingdale's to move into Stanford mall spot 
### Adrian Keatinge-Clay Contributing writer 
When a shopping center is home to 127
specialty shops and four department stores,
the addition of one new retailer shouldn't
cause that much excitement. But then again,
Bloomingdale's has always claimed to be
"like no other store in the world."
After months of speculation about its in
tentions, Federated Department Stores,
Inc., announced late last month that it will
close its Emporium store at the Stanford
Shopping Center and replace it with the first
Bloomingdale's in Northern California. The
upscale department store will open at the
shopping center in November.
Emporium, after 40 years of operation as
one of the center's anchor tenants, will close
its doors in March. The store's clearance sale
began last Friday. Bloomingdale's will open
after the space undergoes eight months of

renovations.
"The arrival of Bloomingdale's will have a
very positive impact on the shopping cen
ter," said David Longbine, manager of the
Stanford Shopping Center. "With Macy's,
Neiman's, Nordstrom and now Blooming
dale's, the Stanford Shopping Center will
have four of the top department stores,
which will surely attract more customers."
The changes at the Stanford Shopping
Center are part of a larger overhaul in the
nationwide department store industry.
"Nationwide, Emporiums, as well as
Macy's and Broadways, have been pur
chased by Federated Department Stores,
Inc.," said Bill Phillips, managing director of
real est ate projects for the Stanford Manage
ment Company, which runs the shopping
center. He further explained that Federated
plans to close the Broadway and Emporium
chains and use the locations they
occupied for new Macy's or
Bloomingdale's stores. Locations
that are not used for the remain
ing chains will be sold.
Bloomingdale's, a New York
chain which is known for its fash
ionable clothes, will also sell
other types of apparel, personal
items and home furnishings.
"Stanford's Bloomingdale's is
not trying to attract the Stanford
students more than the rest of
the public, but its location is ideal
for the collegiate shopper," said
Longbine.
Karla Alvarez, a senior and
self-described avid shopper, was
excited to hear Bloomingdale's is
coming to the Stanford Shopping
Center.
"It's fabulous! I can't wait to
shop there," she said.
Longbine said other Northern
California Emporiums are being
converted into Macy's, and that
three Bloomingdale's will be open
ing up in Southern California.

"These are the first Blooming
dale's outlets west of the Rocky
Mountains; the Minneapolis
Bloomingdale's was formerly the
westernmost store," he added.
"People will come from far
away to shop at the only Bloom
ingdale's in Northern Califor
nia," Phillips said.
"In the future, there will prob
ably be other Bloomingdale's in
Northern California. Sights in
downtown San Francisco and
Valley Fair, San Jose, have been
talked about," he added.
The addition of Blooming
dale's has another upside for the
shopping center. "Bloomingdale's
arrival will make the Stanford
Shopping Center more attractive
for other stores to lease a spot
here," Longbine said.
"The top stores are already at
the center or are hoping to find a
way of getting in. Any slots for
lease here exist because the
Stanford Management Company
is looking for a business to pro
vide a specific service there," he
said.
Bloomingdale's has already
begun extensive radio and televi
sion advertising.
