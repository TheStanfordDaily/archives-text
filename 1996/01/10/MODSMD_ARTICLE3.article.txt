Bloomingdale's in Northern California. The
upscale department store will open at the
shopping center in November.
Emporium, after 40 years of operation as

have four of the top department stores,
which will surely attract more customers."

Center are part of a larger overhaul in the
nationwide department store industry.

Macy's and Broadways, have been pur

Inc.," said Bill Phillips, managing director of
real est ate projects for the Stanford Manage
ment Company, which runs the shopping
center. He further explained that Federated
plans to close the Broadway and Emporium
