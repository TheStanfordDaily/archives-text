# Holiday sports do nothing to provide stimulation for an armchair quarterback
## 
### 
It should have been three weeks of
nothing hut televised excitement. In
anticipating my holiday break, I wel
comed the return of the NBA on TNT,
college basketball on the Deuce and
Sportscenter to my life after a three
month absence (as you all know by now,
I'm one of the poor souk on campus that
still lacks cable). For a simple man like
myself, these activities should have been
enough to keep me happy for the entire
break.
Yet, the sports which were to fill my
vacation did not provide the satisfaction
which they should have. The bowl games,
NBA contests, college hoops and NFL
playoffs which took place in the last three
weeks simply did not make my waste of
time worthwhile.
Take, for instance, the bowl games.
While the Liberty Bowl and the Cardinal
did manage to foster a different sort of
excitement — anger, frustration, violence
— the rest of the games did nothing for
me. After waiting a week for them to
begin, I anxiously flipped on the Aloha
Bowl onl}' to lose interest a quarter and a
half into the contest.
Kven the games which I was specifical
ly looking forward to (Fiesta Bowl, Cop
per Bowl) were not close enough for me to
justify spending my time watching. On
the other hand, the games that were close
(Orange Bowl) meant so little to me that I
opted to watch horrible, late-night HBO'2
flicks, featuring Michael J. Fox as the
übiquitous bellhop.
Even the Rose Bowl, which, being from
Chicago, was a tremendous event,
received such overkill coverage by the
local media that by kickoff, the sight of
purple nauseated me. After being unable
to avoid witnessing 24 consecutive hours
of Northwestern football, the Wildcats'
trip to Universal Studios (along with
every other bathroom stop they made in
Southern California) and alumnus Charl
ton Heston predicting the outcome of the
game, the dream season had become a
nightmare.
I did appreciate the numerous Bulls
games which I had the opportunity to see
over the break. However, 20-point
blowouts are not exactly a cure for bore
dom. Don't got me wrong. As far as I'm
concerned, winning is everything when it
comes to basketball, and with a winning
percentage above .900, the Bulls are get
ting pretty darn good at it. However, to be
that good, you have to sacrifice a little
suspense and thrill. After being a fan of
Stanford football, I've been on the short
end of those "thrilling" one-point losses a
number of times, so 1 think I'll take the
2H-3 record. Besides, a fourth trophy in
six years will be exciting enough.

Besides, the only joy the NBA brings
me in December and January is the
return of the NBA on NBC. Not only do I
get Bob Costas, but it's on network televi
sion. That means even us backwards
Stanford students may get a chance to
watch some ball.
Seeing the NBA's failure, I never
thought college basketball would let me
down. Over the years, I have found myself
fascinated by countless meaningless
matchups of all shapes and sizes. It never
mattered in the past who was playing,
what they were ranked, what conference
they were in, etc.
Yet, the most exciting moment in my
college hoops observations over the past
few weeks was that the Long Beach State
uniforms say "The Beach" on the front.
Even the powerhouse matchup between

No. 1 Massachusetts and then-No. 3
Memphis — despite how close the game
was — did little to peak my interest. I
flipped back and forth between that game
and old "Thirtysomething" reruns. The
Nevada-Marshall game almost made up
for all of them, but Nevada pulled away at
the end.
The NFL playoffs looked like they could
have been the gem of the holiday sports
world. I took a shot to the face when the
Bears missed the playoffs because the Nin
ers couldn't beat (he Falcons. The Niners
got what they deserved eventually, and the
thought that I actually found myself root
ing for the Packers in a football game
almost thrust me into cardiac arrest.
The rest of the playoffs, outside of the
San Francisco debacle, have been inter
esting at best. The rest of the NFC side
has been dull, and no one is really watch
ing the AFC bracket, are they? I would
love to see a Packers-Colts Super Bowl,
but if Dallas wins next weekend, I think I
might just watch the commercials.
Meanwhile, back on the Farm, it has
been two whole days without that lack of
sports titillation, and I would take the
boredom of KSPN and TNT back in a sec
ond. After three weeks of sports on cable
television, one thing is clear: I need you,
Sportscenter. Life just isn't the same
without vou.
