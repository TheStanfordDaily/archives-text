## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The Haas Center for Public Service has re
ceived two new grants totaling almost
$300,000 that will help the center broaden its
scope.
A two-year, $160,000 grant from the Surd
na Foundation of New York and a two-year,
$118,000 grant from the U.S. Department of
Education both focus on cooperation and
sharing ideas, said Haas Center Director Tim
Stanton.
The grant from the Surdna Foundation
will allow the center to design and establish a
"Multicultural Citizen Leadership Develop
ment" program which will help coordinate the

varying public services activities organized by
student groups.
With the grant, the Haas Center will be
able to offer workshops, training, consultation
and mentoring for student groups, Stanton
said.
Such training will "bring them together so
they begin to think of themselves as a commu
nity of like-interested folks," Stanton said.
Many community service groups may have
the same goal or even work in the same area,
which often causes overlaps and decreases ef
ficiency and effectiveness, he said.
"This was brought to our attention by peo
ple in the community who, while very thank-
ful for the work students do,
wonder out loud if work couldn't
be better coordinated," Stanton
added.
Another area staff hopes to
explore is tin- conflicts that arise
between some of these groups
despite similar troals.

"We're particularly interested
in the fact that there are a huge
number of student service
groups on campus . . . with ideo
logical or cultural differences
about what service is about,"
Stanton said.
The $1 18,000 from the
Department of Education's Fund
for the Improvement of Post-
Secondary Education will allow
Stanford to hold conferences
with California State University-

Monterey Bay, Mills College and
Portland State University in
order to share ideas on commu
nity service teaching and learn
ing.
"They are all taking different
attacks at building service learn
ing into their curriculum," Stan
ton said of the other schools
involved. "Stanford has some
thing to learn from those institu
tions.
The Education Department

grant is "known for its stiff
competition," Stanton said.
"We were pleased to get that
award."
Both will help Stanford and
the Haas Center further develop
their commitment to public ser
vice, he added.
"The award itself reflects the
work that's been done here at
Stanford by students and faculty
in service learning," Stanton
said.
