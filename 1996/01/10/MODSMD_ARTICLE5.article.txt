# New spots sought for FRI students
## Some scholars will go to UC-Berkeley program 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Although the closure of the Food Re
search Institute still requires approval by
University President Gerhard Casper and
the Board of Trustees, representatives
from both the Provost's Office and the in
stitute are in the process of determining
where the continuing doctoral candidates
will study next year.
Since the Advisory Board of the Academ
ic Council approved the basic concept of the
proposal to eliminate the 75-year-old insti
tute's doctoral program put forth by John
Shoven, dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences, both faculty and students
have considered the closure a fait accompli

and are now trying to transfer to other
Stanford departments or other schools.
University administrators are arranging
for approximately one-fourth of the doctor
al students to transfer to the Department of
Agricultural and Resource Economics at
UC-Berkeley, while the remaining stu
dents will be divided among Stanford's de
partments of engineering-economic sys
tems and economics and the Graduate
School of Business. In addition, students
close to completing their dissertations may
opt to stay with the proposed interdiscipli
nary center.
There are currently 23 doctoral students
in the program.
"Initially, the important thing
is to try and see which of the pos
sibilities would match their inter
ests and skills," said Dean of
Graduate Policy George Dekker,
selected by Provost Condoleezza
Rice to supervise the student
transition.
In the last three weeks, Dekker
and Assoc. Food Research Prof.
Jeffrey Williams met individually
with each of the available doctoral
students to determine their best
option.
Since the Agricultural Eco
nomics Department at UC-Berke
ley is among the institute's top
competitor for students, Williams
said it was a natural consideration
by students and faculty.
"Many people had already
applied there and taken Stanford
over Berkeley," Williams said.
The department, housed in
UC-Berkeley's School of Natural
Resources, boasts 14 professors
and programs ranging from an
undergraduate minor to its doc
toral degree. It normally accepts
between 15 and 18 students from
an application pool of 111), said
Prof. David Zilberman, the
department chair at Berkeley.
After being contacted by insti
tute students, Berkeley Prof.
Brian Wright received approval to
accept a limited number of Stan
ford students to the program.
"We basically know that these
are good students I audi given the
situation ... it may be reasonable
to accept them," said Zilberman,
adding that the prospective trans
fers are subject to the same
admission requirements.
Wright, who is handling admis
sions this year, met Monday with
institute students interested in
transferring and expects more
students to meet with him today.
Jeff Muller, one of the students
traveling to Berkeley today, said
although the decision is not final,

the probability of the institute's
closure is too high to refrain from
planning for the worst.
"Our understanding is that
with the dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, the
provost and the | Advisory Board]
already lined up behind closure,
there is little likelihood that the
president or the board will over
ride that," said Muller, a second
year doctoral student. "People
have sort of shifted their efforts
from fighting for the survival of
FRI to figuring out their transi
tion strategies."
If possible, Stanford students
plan to begin coursework at
Berkeley on Tuesday, the start of
the spring semester, he said. The
two schools currently offer an
exchange program which requires
departmental approval and not
university admission. Students
who wish to transfer to Berkeley
for the 1996-97 academic year will
have to file an application by the
normal February deadline.
While the Stanford institute
.stresses research abroad and the
application of economic theory to
development issues — two quali
ties which opponents of FRl's
closure claimed made the insti
tute unique — the Berkeley
department is more theoretical
ly-based.
"It is an option to go abroad,
but I think we are much more
emphasizing the economic foun
dation," Zilberman said of Berke
ley's program. "We provide simi
lar but different products. You
have to be a development expert
first I at t he Food Research Insti
tute]. Here you have to be a top
notch economist first. Then if you
want to know development,
nice."
The transition process is hard
est for the students currently
abroad conducting research.
Dekker said those students who
have a well-defined thesis will be
allowed to stay, while students
still narrowing a topic may be
asked to return to Stanford until
it is determined.
