# New spots sought for FRI students
## Some scholars will go to UC-Berkeley program 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
Although the closure of the Food Re
search Institute still requires approval by
University President Gerhard Casper and
the Board of Trustees, representatives
from both the Provost's Office and the in
stitute are in the process of determining
where the continuing doctoral candidates
will study next year.
Since the Advisory Board of the Academ
ic Council approved the basic concept of the
proposal to eliminate the 75-year-old insti
tute's doctoral program put forth by John
Shoven, dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences, both faculty and students
have considered the closure a fait accompli

and are now trying to transfer to other
Stanford departments or other schools.
University administrators are arranging
for approximately one-fourth of the doctor
al students to transfer to the Department of
Agricultural and Resource Economics at
UC-Berkeley, while the remaining stu
dents will be divided among Stanford's de
partments of engineering-economic sys
tems and economics and the Graduate
School of Business. In addition, students
close to completing their dissertations may
opt to stay with the proposed interdiscipli
nary center.
There are currently 23 doctoral students
in the program.
