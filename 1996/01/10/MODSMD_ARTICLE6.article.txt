## Students will learn from diplomats, heads of state 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
This summer, Stanford students will have
the chance to learn about the rules of inter
national relations from the diplomats who
write them.
Joining ambitious young scholars from
around the world, students from Stanford
and nine other U.S. universities will be se
lected to attend the first month-long Inter
national Student Symposium on Negotiation
and Conflict Resolution.
The symposium is scheduled to take place
from July to August at the Institute of High
er European Studies (IHES) in The Hague,
Netherlands, one of Europe's leading schools
of international affairs.
"Stanford University was selected be
cause of its free-spirited and independent
minded student body, as well as its fine acad
emic standing," Cody Shearer, the architect
of the program and president of the Institute

for International Mediation and Conflict
Resolution (lIMCR), said in a press release.
The other U.S. universities chosen for the
applicant pool are Columbia, Duke, North
western, Princeton, UCLA, Florida, Min
nesota, UNC-Chapel Hill and Washington.
"We're looking for very articulate, bright,
self-motivated students . .. who want to be
key players in the new world order," Shearer
said. "By and large, Stanford students are
better read, better traveled and more inquis
itive than most students."
Melanie Greenberg, associate director for
the Stanford Center for Security and Arms
Control, said the program is a "wonderful op
portunity" for young students.
"The earlier students are exposed to the
theory and practice of conflict resolution, the
more they will excel as scholars in an explod
ing field of research in graduate and law
schools," Greenberg said.
