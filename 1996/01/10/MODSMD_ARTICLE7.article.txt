# Student attitudes are changing
## In recent years, Stanford frosh have become more 'strategic' 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
It's become a common grumbling in
recent months: Frosh are becoming
more school-focused, more work-fo
cused, more career-focused. Stanford
students just aren't as much fun, as
well-rounded — cynical upperclass
men are wont to say — as they used to
be.
An old complaint, maybe, but the

kvetching is not necessarily unfound
ed. After all, in the past year, the Uni
versity has unveiled two new initia
tives designed to attract the nation's
top students to Stanford: the Presi
dential Scholars program and the
early decision admissions option.
Craig Zajac, a coterminal student
who in his four years at Stanford has
spent time as a resident assistant,
chairman of the Axe Committee and
Flicks Guy, has had a good deal of con

tact with freshmen.
"It's not a secret that the Universi
ty has made an effort to go after the
top students in recent years," he said.
"On the whole, what I've seen ... has
been more of an academically oriented
kind of stance."
Asst. History Prof. Philippe Buc, a
professor in the Cultures, Ideas and
Values program for four years, said he
has seen a change in the caliber of
incoming freshmen.
"There's been an improve
ment" in the quality of his CIV
students, Buc said. "I've met
more frosh with whom I can be
intellectually engaged." In fact,
he said, the section he led in His
tory CIV last year was the best
he's ever taught.
"I can't see why all of the sud
den Istudents] would focus more
on their work. ... I expect it has
more to do with admissions," Buc
said.
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid James
Montoya said he agrees that the
focus of entering students has
changed.
"Are students approaching
Stanford in a more serious
way?" he asked. "All you have to
do is look at the growing number
who are graduating in three
years."
But he does not attribute that
change to a shift in admissions
policies. "I do think that students
are more concerned about how
they can use their Stanford expe
rience," he said, "but I'm not sure
that they know exactly where it is
they wish to go when they get
here."
An illusion?
"I think that we have seen
more students who are more con
cerned about careers and majors
over the past few years," said
Hector Cuevas, director of the
Undergraduate Advising Center.

"I think that students are focus
ing more on schoolwork, focusing
more on grades."
Dandre DeSandies, associate
director of the UAC, said he has
seen students giving more consid
eration to how a Stanford educa
tion will help them in the future.
Whereas in the past, students
would generally begin to research
and compare different majors at
the end of their sophomore year
or beginning of their junior year,
he now sees students starting
that process a year early — at the
end of their freshman year or
beginning of their sophomore
year.
Nonetheless, some believe that
any changes are being overem
phasized.
Asst. Chemistry Prof. Daniel
Stack, who teaches Chemistry 31:
"Chemical Principles," said he
has not seen any changes in the
freshmen in that class. If fresh
man really are more academically
oriented, he said, "I guess I'm just
not very observant."
Assistant to the President
Jean Fetter, a former dean of
admissions, said she does not
believe that a perception of
change is well-grounded.
"I think that whenever there's
a change in office, people look for
comparisons, and they tend (o
generalize," she said, adding that
such generalizations are often
inaccurate. Montoya succeeded
Fetter as dean in 1991. The next
year, Cerhard Casper was named
University president.
It is interesting to hear stu
dents argue that Montoya, as
dean of admissions, is admitting
more academically oriented stu
dents than she did as dean, Fetter

said, when the same charge was
leveled against her as compared
to her predecessor.
She cited a 1990 column in The
Stanford Review which said,
"since Dean Fetter took over,
there has been a noticeable decline
in the prevalence of well-rounded
students in favor of those intellec
tually gifted in one way or anoth
er. In more direct parlance, there
is an increase in the number of
nerds / geeks / tools or whatever
word you choose."
Recruitment changes
However, two new admissions
programs have been implemented
in the past year specifically tar
geting the nation's most desirable
high school seniors.
Last year, Montoya said the
Presidential Scholars program
which offers designated prospec
tive freshmen a $1,500 research
grant and an expenses-paid visit
to the campus — was a way to
"recruit top scholars in much the
same way as top athletes."
And when the early decision
program — first implemented
this year — was announced last
November, Montoya said that
"Stanford's lack of an early deci
sion program has put the Univer
sity at a disadvantage in attract
ing and enrolling . . . highly
recruited students."
Nonetheless, Montoya said he
does not believe that Stanford is
changing its admissions criteria
but rather thinks that the admis
sions pool is changing.
There will always be a certain
number of "academic superstars"
who are admitted, be said, and
they continue to be admitted at
the same rate. At the same time,

though, the percentage of the
applicant pool which can be
described as "superstars" is grow
ing.
In fact, he added, during his
tenure as dean of admissions, a
greater emphasis has been placed
on extracurricular activities.
Now, in addition to noting the
breadth of extracurricular
involvement, admissions officers
examine the impact that a stu
dent's activities have had upon
his or her community.
"Students just seem to be more
strategic," Montoya said. Many
applicants come from profession
al families where they have seen
relatives with comfortable jobs on
Wall Street or as lawyers sudden
ly become unemployed, he said.
"Students no longer assume that
Stanford, bv itself, is a ticket to
success."
The earlier interest in examin
ing majors and planning how to
maximize the resources available
at Stanford, DeSandies said, is
also a result of outside influences.
"It's probably a sign of the finan
cial pressure of a Stanford educa
tion," he said.
Hardworking though they
might be, current freshmen
don't always seem to bear out
the proposition that they're less
fun.
Freshman Jeff Ellingson said
his classmates are "on the week
days more work-oriented and on
weekends more party-oriented."
And freshman Marcello Isaac's
description of a typical Saturday
night will ring true for students
in all classes: "1 ask around about
what's going on, go to whatever's
going on, and then come back and
bitch about it
