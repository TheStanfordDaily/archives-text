# UCLA study of frosh finds decline in political interest
## 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
Echoing the findings of a recent Stanford Daily
poll, a national study of college freshmen by
UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute
has found that levels of political interest and ac
tivism have fallen markedly from their highest
points in 1992.
According to the UCLA poll — published in this
week's Chronicle of Higher Education — interest in
"participating in a community action program" has
fallen from 26.1 in 1992 percent to 23 percent this
year, while interest in "cleaning up the environ
ment" has dropped from 33.6 percent to 22.5 per
cent.
In The Daily's poll, conducted in mid-November,
only 35 percent of Stanford students indicated that
they were involved in community service, though 77
percent said they had engaged in community service
work while in high school.
Haas Center for Public Sei*vice Director Tim
Stanton - who disputes the findings of The Daily's
poll based upon its research methods — said he has
not seen a drop in involvement at Stamford.
"There's a lot of indicators that Stanford stu
dents are still pretty gung-ho," he said.
He did acknowledge, however, that the level of in
terest in public service seems to be reaching a
plateau. "For many, many years it's been rising," he

said. "| But now] we've seen a level
ing off in it."
Still, Stanton said, "I haven't
seen a decline. ... At Stanford,
there's still many, many students
involved."
In contrast to The Daily's poll,
however, the UCLA study found
that nationwide, freshman stu
dents' interest in politics is drop
ping to an all-time low.
For the third consecutive year,
the study found that student com
mitment to "keeping up to date
with political affairs" dropped, this
year to 28.5 percent, the lowest per

centage of students the survey has
recorded. The highest, in 1966, was
57.8 percent. Only 14.8 percent of
students discuss politics regularly,
the all-time low, as compared with
the 1968 high of 29.9 percent.
In the Daily poll, however, 59
percent of students said they "fol
low national or international
issues" either "closely" or "some
what closely."
The UCLA study also found
that students are increasingly
labeling their political views as cen
trist. More than half of the respon
dents called themselves "middle of
the road" in this year's poll.
At the same time, however, the
percentage of students who label
themselves ;ls "far left" or "far
right" reached record highs. An all

time record 1.6 percent of students
considered themselves "far right,"
while a 25-year high 2.7 percent
consider themselves "far left."
Sophomore Danny Bramzon,
founder of the Moderate Majority,
a fledgling centrist political group
at Stanford, said he believes the
growing number of students label
ing themselves as "middle of the
road" is a reaction to the growing
polarization of the political system.
"It's basic but it's very true... .
The two political parties available
to us now are becoming more and
more extreme," he said.
Student views on major contro
versial issues are also shifting to the
center. While support for casual sex
and abortion rights is dwindling,
both homosexual relationships and

marijuana legalization are receiving
more support than in the past.
An iill-time low number of stu
dents believe both that homosexu
al relationships should be prohibit
ed and that "if two people like each
other, it's okay for them to have
sex even if they've only known
each other for a short time."
The survey found that although
an overwhelming majority of stu
dents support the use of race as a
criterion in college admissions,
there is an even split in opinion
when the name "affirmative action"
is attached. It found a drop in inter
est for careers in law and engineer
ing and an increase in interest for
education careers. The survey also
noted that students continue to feel
escalating financial concerns.
