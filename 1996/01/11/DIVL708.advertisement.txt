Welcome Back Stanford
Chef Chu's offers customers dishes adapted from
authentic Chinese recipes which appeal to both the
Chinese and American palate. The restaurant received
the Epicurean Rendezvous Award given for Best
Chinese Restaurant in Northern California.
And recently, the readers of San Francisco Focus
Magazine awarded him the same honor.
For over twenty-six years Chef Chu's has used the
freshest ingredients to prepare exotic dishes. Friendly,
caring, efficient sew ice has always been our tradition.
Relax and let your senses guide you. You be the judge.
