# GOP says no hope for budget

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Agreement on a bal
anced-budget plan is now unlikely, Republican lead
ers said yesterday, as they and the Clinton adminis
tration positioned themselves for an election year of
blaming each other. Financial markets plunged in
reaction.
"I think the odds are better than even, as of today,
that there will be no agreement," House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said during a campaign visit to
Wyoming. "And I find that a very difficult prospect."
"Can we reach an agreement? I don't know," Senate
Majority Leader Rob Dole, R-Kan., said on the Senate
floor. "Is it doubtful? Probably. Is it possible? Yes."
The leaders' remarks further doused hopes for a
pact with President Clinton on eliminating deficits by
2002 and cutting taxes. And they contrasted with their
comments Tuesday as the talks broke off, when they
were careful not to characterize the odds of success.
Stock and bond markets sank shortly after Gin
grich spoke. The plummet reflected worry by
investors who believed until Tuesday the yearlong
budget stalemate would be resolved.

GOP leaders are undecided what to do when tem
porary spending authority lapses on Jan. 26 for
dozens of federal agencies. Republicans were the driv
ing force behind the first two federal shutdowns, but
many believe the strategy did not work for them and
want to avoid another one.
Talks were unlikely to resume until next Wednes
day at the earliest, time Clinton and the GOP leaders
will use for political appearances, to sound out their
constituencies and to watch public opinion polls.
House Majority leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, reit
erated GOP demands that Clinton produce a new pro
posal before meetings resume. But to that, House
Minority leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., told reporters
"I don't expect new numbers" from the president.
With the protracted battle looking increasingly
likely to end in impasse, both sides began embroider
ing strategies to convince voters the other is at fault.
Lacking a budget agreement, the parties' warring
visions of government's reach and cost should
become a major theme of the 1996 presidential and
congressional contests.
