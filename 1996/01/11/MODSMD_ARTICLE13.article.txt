The University should
forgive some late fees
to ease students' return

Students here at Stan
ford have had a lot to
accomplish since returning
to campus this week. Most of
them not only needed to resettle
into their rooms, but also had to
get hack in touch with numerous
professors and other associates to
plan their academic and extracur
ricular calendars. Additionally,
many students had to battle the
long lines in the Bookstore to
purchase their books and class
materials in order to keep up
with the quick pace of the quar
ter system.
Considering such complica
tions at the start of each new aca
demic term, it seems the Univer
sity could assist its students
tremendously by allowing them
more time to pay their bills with
out being penalized by punitive
late fees. This change in the pay
ment policy would be particularly
useful to the many at Stanford
who receive financial aid.
Under the current payment
process, students with financial
aid must stand in time-consum
ing long lines to collect loans and
pay their bills — all during the
one day before instruction
begins. Understandably, it is
important for the University to
receive payment as soon as possi
ble. And undoubtedly, it would
require significant expenses and
manpower to distribute loans and
handle personal accounts on a
large scale for an extended pay
ment period.
However, the gains from a
more lenient payment schedule
might in truth outweigh the actu
al costs. Indeed, to provide stu
dents with more time to manage
other aspects of their lives at
Stanford, it seems the University

need not maintain a large sta
beyond the traditional one-dy
time frame in which to hand
loans and bills. As long as sti
dents can wait to pick up the
loans and settle their account
they can take care of their final
cial affairs through the day-t<
day channels which exist for sue
purposes.
Furthermore, the Universit
must keep in mind that otht
complications could prevent sti
dents from paying their bills o
one day. Take the snowstori
which has crippled the Has
Coast, for instance. True, sti
dents who don't receive financi;
aid can mail in their checks earl

claiming their loan checks
checks which can only b
obtained on campus in person
And even if they could afford t
pay their bills with one larg
check, should students be penal
ized because thev failed to predic
an act of nature?
Admittedly, in light of individ
ual circumstances, students ca
petition to waive their late pa)>
ment fees. Even in the case c
needy students, the Universit
does provide deferment loan pre
grams to assist students who, fo
one reason or another, can no
collect their loan checks in tim
to make their payments.

ficulties of various natures -
personal, academic or otherwise
The University could perform

instruction or for however lon
the University can afford. Th
fact that the penalty for late bill

of the quarter seems to indicat
that this move would not be to
costly.
