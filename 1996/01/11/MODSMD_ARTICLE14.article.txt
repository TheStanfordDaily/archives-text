Student decries poor service of ASSU shuttle

FELLOW STUDENTS: Think twice
before deciding to try the ASSU's
student shuttle service. I have
taken the student shuttle service a total
of four times now, but after this winter
vacation shuttle experience, never again.
My reasons for trying the student shuttle
were twofold: to save some money, and to
help support the ASSU.
But the ASSU still has much to learn
about running a shuttle service. More
than simply transporting a student from
campus to the airport, a shuttle service
must have professionalism, competitive
service and promises that it keeps.
The ASSU shuttle has none of these.
So what's wrong with the student
shuttle? Let me share my past three expe
riences as examples. The second time I
tried the student shuttle was at the end
of the last school year, during which I
encountered the first of the ASSU's bro
ken promises: arrival at the airport at
least thirty minutes before your (light.
The first time, I was scheduled to be
picked up was more than a couple hours
before my flight, and I was all prepared to
leave when I received a call that 1 would
be picked up close to an hour later. Real
izing that this would be cutting it close, I

patiently waited in front of Flo Mo at the
new time .. . and waited . . . and waited.
Finally the shuttle came, and we were
told that our luggage would ride in a sep
arate vehicle — something commercial
shuttles never do. I wound up being
dropped off about five to ten minutes
before my (light (after waiting for the lug
gage van to catch up), a far cry from the
ASSU's promised thirty minutes, and
very nearly missing my plane. There can
be no blame placed on traffic, for the
highways were clear.
So vhat would convince someone to
try the ASSU shuttle yet again twice this
break? I guess I wanted to give the ASSU
a chance to redeem itself, and at $10 leav
ing and $11 returning, it seemed like a
good deal considering I had paid $17 to
Super Shuttle in the past. Bad idea. The
first most noticeable difference in service
compared to commercial shuttles is that
the ASSU shuttle is not door to door; you
must be picked up or dropped off at either
Lag or Wilbur. This was only a slight
inconvenience for me living at Stern, but
pity the poor souls living at Flo Mo or on
the Row.
After paying the ASSU, I noticed yet
another service corner cut: "Two pieces of

luggage per rider (or $2 service charge)"
was written on t he back of my ticket. It
seemed to me that they would charge a
total of $2 per trip for any additional lug
gage. Since I took home my skis, I had
four pieces of luggage. But even with $2
added, it still was cheaper than Super
Shuttle, so I figured. But instead, when I
caught the shuttle (and later when I
returned), I was told by the driver that I
had to pay a $2 per bag, for a total service
charge $4 each way. As far as I can recall,
I was never charged for additional bag
gage I brought along on Super Shuttle.
Yet another broken promise by the ASSU
When arriving back at campus after
this break, 1 had yet another very bad
experience. Upon arrival at the airport,
one must go to special courtyard areas to
be picked up, unlike Super Shuttle which
picks up directly outside your airline's
terminal. After waiting for over an hour
(I never had to wait for Super Shuttle
longer than thirty minutes), the shuttle
finally came. Our driver yet again was
highly unprofessional. Obviously inexpe
rienced, he drove around the airport for
over a half hour, frequently slamming on
the breaks and making tight turns, look
ing for more people.

Finally, after driving around for half
an hour, he gave up searching and we
started on t he trip to Stanford. When we
were almost back, right at the stop light
on Embarcadero in front of Town and
Country Village, our driver actually got
into a heated argument with a truck that
he thought cut him off. I found it hard to
keep myself from laughing as our driver
tried to tell the other guy off. How ridicu
lous! Give me a break.
And to top it off, the ASSU has the
nerve to print everywhere, "Please do not
forget to tip drivers" (they depend on
them?!). After broken promises and
unprofessional non-door-to-door service,
they won't be gett ing a tip from me any
time soon, that's for sure.
So I ended up paying $14 and $15 for
departure and arrival shuttle service, sav
ing a grand total of $5 from taking Super
Shuttle. And for that $5 savings, the
ASSU shuttle offered me inferior and
unprofessional service, broken promises,
and, in the end, not that competitive a
price. Don't be fooled as I was. Think
twice before committing to such a home
brew operation.
