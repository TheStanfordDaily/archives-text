## Notes from East Africa 
### 
DEAR DIARY - THINGS to do in
Africa during the holiday break:
take lots of pictures, get a bit of a
tan, contract a really cool virus like
malaria or Ebola. I jotted that down near
ly a month ago. I was off to Sierra Leone
to visit Mom and Dad. They moved there
this fall both to escape the "hoods of
Coronado" and to work under the guise
of international diplomacy.
When I look back at this journal entry,
1 have to laugh, because, to toll you the
truth, I was sheepishly naive. As 1
stepped onto the tarmac that humid
African eve, I didn't realize that my inno
cent world was about to be shattered by a
small, tight group of one-eyed mercenar
ies.
Once through customs, I greeted my
parents with hugs and kisses and high
fives and was then sped to a waiting vehi
cle. Then it hit me. These were not my
parents! Okay, maybe I should have
noticed the eye patches adorning both of
my "parents," or t lie fact that mv father's
shiny bald pate was now covered in glori
ous locks of blonde-headedness. Maybe it
should have registered somewhere in my
mind that my mom was actually a burly
6-foot-2 black male armed with an AK
-47. But c'mon. It was late and I was suf
fering from jet lag. Plus, I hadn't seen my
parents in over nine months, so how was
1 to know how they had changed?

However, I do credit myself for one
thing. I remembered that my mother had
always preferred the Uzi to the cumber
some AK-47. Besides being a more intim
idating weapon, it also matched her
wardrobe. Armed with this knowledge, I
struck.
"You're not my mom!" (accusatory)
"So!" (with a sharp blow to my head
with a gun butt)
Upon waking, I discovered that I had
been involuntarily recruited by a small
group of one-eyed mercenaries involved
in some sort of diamond smuggling ring
between Freetown and Reykjavik. I'm
not afraid to tell you that I wanted to cry
like a little baby, but I was strong. Bol
stered by the fact that I had spent my
summer watching and reenacting Jackie
Chan movies, I decided to act.
My poor-as-hell adaptation of the
"Drunken Master" technique was
rewarded by a swift kick to my groin.
"Let me go now or I swear to God I'll
scream like a little school girl," I threat
ened.
That received only laughs.
Then I let them have it. I told them
that I had master-minded an extensive
covert rubella smuggling operation run
out of North Dakota in '89, that I had
read "Rogue Warrior" four times, and
that my deceiving 6-foot, 135-pound
frame had carried me through three

tours of duty as a Navy SEAL in 'Nam.
Needless to say, they were impressed
and immediately accepted me into their
ranks with embraces and an eye patch.
They also code-named me "Huggy-Bear"
(that's Mr. I luggy-Bear to you, dear read
er). I was appointed their official missile
systems operator / dance coordination
specialist / sex toy. The following six days
were the among the greatest days of my
life.
On Christmas morning, however, my
parents shattered this perfect world.
Overreacting, as usual, they had taken it
upon themselves to ambush our small
guerrilla outfit. Cleverly disguised as eye
patch vendors, they successfully infiltrat
ed our camp and proceeded to gun down
my new-found friends with Yuletide cries
of "Suck on this!" and "Diplomatic
immunity rules!" My real parents (they
both had Uzis — I checked) then ripped
off my eye patch and brought me straight
home.
1 guess I should be thankful, but damn
it, aren't parents always getting in the
way of your vacation fun?
Tune in next week for Mr. Blackford's
stirring holiday adventures in central
Ohio.
