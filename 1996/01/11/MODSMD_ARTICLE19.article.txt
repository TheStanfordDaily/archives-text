Computer thief back in action
Christmas came early for a thief who stole pricey
computer equipment from both the Braun Music
Center and the Graduate School of Business during
the closing weeks of 1995.
Between Dec. 15 and 18, an unknown suspect
entered a locked office in Braun Music Center and
removed $11,000 in Macintosh equipment. Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said the equip
ment was new and waiting to be installed.
In the other incident, an unknown suspect
entered a secured building in the Business School
through unknown means between Dec. 17 and 21
and took a laser printer, Niemeyer said.
"It's been a real bad year in computer thefts
the worst of the worst ever," Niemeyer said. "We
had 57 separate incidents, which eclipses the previ
ous record of 49 separate cases in 1987."
Niemeyer said the cost of stolen computer equip
ment in 1987 totaled $166,000. This past year, how
ever, the cost was $184,000.
Thieves do not have a difficult time breaking into
buildings, Niemeyer said, since many campus build
ings remain unlocked during the night.
"We call these guys 'semi-pros' since it doesn't
take a lot of stealth and knowledge to walk into an
office," Niemeyer said.
Police stud they suspect Kenneth Hennigan in
connection with the two burglaries and have posted
wanted fliers throughout the campus.
"We know he's at large . . . and has an affinity for
this place," Niemeyer said.
Police arrested Hennigan for being a parolee-at
large two years ago, when he was found sleeping in
a campus building.
"He doesn't admit to anything," Niemeyer said.
"When we arrested him, he invented this cock-and
bull story why he was on campus. He said he was
working with a professor on eradicating the fire
ants of Arizona. Yeah, right. ''
Hennigan is a 6-f'oot 1-inch tall white male and is
66 years old. He has gray hair, blue eyes and walks
with a slight limp.

Kidnapping at Sweet Hall
A woman's ex-boyfriend held her against her will
in a Sweet Hall office for over two hours on Dec. 11.
Steven Mitzenmacher, 23, of Mountain View,
went to his ex-girlfriend's office and began an
intense mid protracted conversation with her, said
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer. The conver
sation occurred in the aflermath of a failed dating
relationship between the two University workers,
who are also former students.
Niemeyer said Mitzenmacher refused to leave
when his ex-girlfriend ordered him to get out of her
office. He would not let her leave or answer her
phone.
On two occasions, however, the woman was able
to call her roommate in Mountain View, Niemeyer
said. When the roommate received the first call, she
did not call police. She instead waited an hour and
then called the woman back only to learn that
Mitzenmacher refused to leave.
Niemeyer said after two hours and 15 minutes,
Sweet 1 lall staff members distracted Mitzenmacher
and then called the police.
Mitzenmacher was booked on a felony fidse
imprisonment charge and for battery, Niemeyer
said. Because the violence was minimal, the district
attorney lessened the charge to a misdemeanor for
false imprisonment.
Mitzenmacher is awaiting trial.
Attempted suicide at EBF
A woman attempted to commit suicide in
Enchanted Broccoli Forest on Dec. 4 by slitting her
wrists.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said the
woman was suffering from depression when she
attempted to commit suicide. She was treated and
received therapy at the Stanford University Medical
Center.
The woman continues to receive therapy and is
improving, Niemeyer said.
