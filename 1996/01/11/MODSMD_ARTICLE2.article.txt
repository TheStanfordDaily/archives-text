# 40 volunteer for layoffs at SLAC
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Officials at the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center said yesterday that 40 em
ployees have agreed to be voluntarily laid
off.
The layoffs are the result of the de
crease in federal funding from the De
partment of Energy, which was an
nounced last November.
Despite these first volunteers, still
more employees must leave SLAC invol
untarily. Officials originally estimated
between HO and 70 total layoffs.
Department directors are currently

looking at budgets and voluntary layoff
numbers to determine where additional
layoffs are needed, said SLAC Personnel
Director Lee Lyon. SLAC will notify
those employees facing involuntary lay
offs by Feb. 15, he said.
"The numbers are still being
crunched, and it is hard to tell how many
will be laid off," said P.A. Moore, acade
mics resource and program officer at
SLAC. "We all would like the layoffs to
occur with minimum negative impact."
SLAC's budget was slashed by 7 per
cent, or about $7 million, last November
when President Clinton signed the Ener
gy and Water Bill containing the budget

of the Department of Energy. This de
crease in federal funding necessitated
that some of SLAC's 1,350 employees be
laid off.
Officials encouraged iSLAC employees
to participate in a voluntary layoff pro
gram. Volunteers receive no special ben
efits by choosing to leave, receiving (he
same severance pay as those employees
who are involuntarily laid off.
"The number of voluntary layoffs is
about what we expected — a little high
er," said Lyon. Employees who have cho
sen to participate in the voluntary pro-
gram will leave SLAC on individ
ually negotiated dates from nov
until next September, whicl
marks the end of the fiscal year.
The volunteers are spread
"fairly evenly" across the organi
zation, not concentrated in an)
specific area. Lyon added that ht
did not yet know how many invol
untary layoffs would he neces
sary, hut said he was pleased thai
"the lab was able to minimize tin
number of involuntary layoff?
through the voluntary program.'
Although layoffs are being
made at SLAC, 20 new positions
have been added at Stanford Syn
chrotron Radiation Laboratory
These positions will be held open
until SLAC employees facing

involuntary layoffs have a chance
to apply.
"We wanted to have our laid
off employees have an opportuni
ty to apply — it is always awk
ward to be laying off and hiring at
the same time," said Lyon. "We
wanted to be sure they had a fair
opportunity." The positions at
SSRL will be advertised in late
January, and SLAC employees
can apply until Feb. 23.
To help lessen the psychologi
cal impact of a reduction in force,
SLAC' is providing career counsel
ing and resume services, Lyon
said.
As University employees, all
personnel belong to a career
resource center in Palo Alto.
Lyon saifl SLAC would also be
putting together a resume book
which will be sent to local
employers who "hire the kind of
people we have."
