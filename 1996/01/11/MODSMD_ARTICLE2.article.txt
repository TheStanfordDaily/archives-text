# 40 volunteer for layoffs at SLAC

Officials at the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center said yesterday that 40 em
ployees have agreed to be voluntarily laid
off.
The layoffs are the result of the de

crunched, and it is hard to tell how many
will be laid off," said P.A. Moore, acade

SLAC. "We all would like the layoffs to
occur with minimum negative impact."
SLAC's budget was slashed by 7 per
cent, or about $7 million, last November
when President Clinton signed the Ener

that some of SLAC's 1,350 employees be
laid off.
Officials encouraged iSLAC employees
to participate in a voluntary layoff pro
gram. Volunteers receive no special ben
efits by choosing to leave, receiving (he
same severance pay as those employees
who are involuntarily laid off.
"The number of voluntary layoffs is
about what we expected â€” a little high
er," said Lyon. Employees who have cho
sen to participate in the voluntary pro-
