## Women's hoops set to host UCLA Bruised and battered Cardinal up against Bruin twin towers 
### Bobby Cuza Staff writer 
Tonight's conference home
opener against UCLA shapes
up like a battle of the giants
for the Stanford women's bas
ketball team.
With 5-foot-6 point guard
Jamila Wideman out with a
sprained ankle and 5-11 for
ward Hobby Kelsey sidelined
indefinitely by a damaged
right knee, the sixth-ranked
Cardinal (9-2 overall, 2-0
Pacific 10 Conference) will
field a starting lineup that
includes three players 6-2 or
taller. But the Stanford
women will need all the height
they can get against a UCLA
lineup that features 6-4 Kisa
Hughes and 6-5 Zrinka Kris
tich.
"They'll give us maybe
some matchup problems with
our big lineup," said Cardinal
head coach Amy Tucker.
UCLA, picked sixth in the
conference in the preseason,
brings a 6-5 record (1-1 Pac
-10) into tonight's 7 p.m. con
test at Maples Pavilion. How
ever, three of those five losses
have come at the hands of
teams in the Associated Press
top 10.
In last Friday's conference
opener, the Bruins needed a
career-high 27 points from
junior guard Nickey Hilbert to
power their way past Wash
ington State 85-75. On Sun
day, however, the Bruins got
into foul trouble and watched
a 10-point second-half lead
dissolve in a 78-66 loss to
Washington.

Hughes, UCLA's senior
center, posted double figures
in both points and rebounds
against Washington and
WSU. The Bruins' leader in
scoring, rebounding, blocked
shots and field-goal percent
age last season, Hughes is
currently averaging 14.1

At this point,
[Jamila Wideman]
is day to day, so
she's definitely
improving. She'll
be back.'

points and a team-high 8.1
rebounds.
"She'll be tough to defend,"
Tucker said.
Stanford could also
encounter problems defend
ing the Bruins' talented back
court. Freshman Erica Gomez
won the starting point guard
position in the season's third
game and hasn't relinquished
it since. She tied a school
record against Long Beach
State with 15 assists and cur
rently leads the Pac-10 in
steals with 3.2 per game. She
teams up in the backcourt
with Hilbert, the redshirt
junior who leads the team in
scoring with 16.2 per game.
"She's very, very quick off
the dribble," Tucker said of
Hilbert.
Stanford, meanwhile, will
continue to rely on the firepow
er of junior t' Kate Starbird
and sophomore sharpshooter
Vanessa Nygaard. Starbird cur
rently averages a team-best
18.8 points to go along with 4.2
rebounds and 4.7 assists.
Nygaard ranks second on the
squad with 16.6 points per game
and is a big reason the Cardinal
leads the Pac-10 in three-point
ers. She currently shoots 46.8
percent from beyond the arc,
having buried 36 of 77 treys on
the season.
Team co-captain Wideman is
expected back soon, but don't
count on seeing her on the floor
tonight.
"At this point, she's day to
day, so she's definitely improv
ing," Tucker said.
"She'll be back. We don't
know if it's going to be [today];
we don't know if it'll be Satur
day. "
Charmin Smith will start in
Wide man's place. The 5-10
junior played well last weekend
in victories at Arizona and Ari
zona State.
With Kelsev suffering from a
damaged anterior cruciate liga
ment, Tucker has moved
Nygaard to the 3 position. That
leaves 6-3 Naomi Muli
tauaopele and 6-2 Olympia
Scott to defend UCLA's twin
towers.
UCLA leads the all-time series
against Stanford 17-14, though
the Cardinal has taken the last
three contests. Last season, Stan
lord topped the Bruins 88-49 at
Maples Pavilion and 84-49 in
Westwood.
