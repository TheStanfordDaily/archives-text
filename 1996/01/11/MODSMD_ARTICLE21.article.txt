## Basketball looks to topple Bruins 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
It will be a battle of execution
versus emotion tonight in Los
Angeles as the Stanford men's
basketball team tips off against
the chest-thumping, in-your-face
dunking UCLA Bruins in an
early-season showdown of the
Pacific 10 Conference's top teams.
Except for the absence of
sophomore center Tim Young, the
No. 24 Cardinal (8-2 overall, 2-0
Pac-10) enters the game against
the No. 19 Bruins (9-3, 2-0) with
just the right mind set and
momentum. With senior guard
Dion Cross regaining his hot
hand and the Cardinal snapping a
15-game losing streak against
Arizona last Saturday, Stanford
has the look of a giant-killer.
"Beating Arizona and Arizona
State â€” those were the best back
to-back games we've had all sea
son," said head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "At least we know now
we can play good basketball."
Knowing that he can't rely on
sheer physical talent or an experi
enced bench to dig his team out of
any slumps, Montgomery has been
preaching all year that it will take
little things like working hard for
40 minutes a game to win night in
and night out.
Unfortunately for Stanford, it
took eight non-conference games
and the loss of Young to knock
that sense into Montgomery's
squad.
"You can't just take a player of
Tim's caliber out and not expect
changes," the coach said. "He
gives rebounding and defense
along with a potential 20 points
every night. At some time, that
loss will come up and bite us.
"We can't expect Dion to get 30
(points) every night. People are
going to have to perform consis
tently. Over an 18-game schedule,
you will lose games that you
shouldn't, and the good teams
don't do that."

The Cardinal has a chance to
prove that last weekend's win
over Arizona wasn't a fluke as it
attempts to break a nine-game
losing streak to the defending
national champions at Pauley
Pavilion at 7:30 p.m.
With four interchangeable
parts at guard and forward and a
dominating shot blocker in fresh
man center Jelani McCoy, the
Bruins force more matchup prob
lems than acne-faced kids at a
middle-school dance.
"We don't have a lot of choic
es," Montgomery said. "They run
so fast and jump so high, all five
are capable of going to the
boards."
Bruin sophomore Toby Bailey,
thrown into the point guard posi
tion due to injuries to Cameron
Dollar seven games ago, creates
the biggest problem because of his
6-foot-5 frame. He can post up
smaller players and outjump any
one in the gym.
Montgomery believes his point
guard duo of junior Brevin
Knight and freshman Arthur Lee
can pry some turnovers out of the
demonstrative Bailey. The Bruins
average 18.3 turnovers per game.
Lee, along with fellow fresh
man Mark Seaton, hails from the
Los Angeles area and already has
experience playing against some
of UCLA's players.
"I'll be full of emotion. It'll be
fun because I know 95 percent of
their team," Lee said. "I've been
playing against those guys for two
or three years. They are just nor
mal guys. All that hype doesn't
get to me."
As for the cover-boy Bailey,
Lee and Knight are not
impressed.
"Toby never really seemed to
be a problem to me," Lee said. "I
think that will be a weak spot for
them. Starting out with Brevin
against Toby, I think Brevin can
take care of him."


Senior foward Andy Poppink throws down a rim-rattling jam against
Arizona. The Cardinal hopes to dunk UCLA tonight.
