## After long break, No. 1 women ready to defend top spot 
### Ratha Harntha Editorial staff 
After a month of training and
practice, the top-ranked women's
swimming team will finally get a
chance to face an opponent in
this weekend's dual meets
against Villanova and Nevada at
deGuerre Pool.
The Cardinal has not compet
ed in a dual meet since its 182-
117 victory over then-No. 3
Texas on Nov. 17. Its last race
was the Texas Invitational,
which took place from Nov. 30 to
Dec. 2.
"Everyone is excited to race,"
said senior co-captain Jane Skill
man.
After the Texas Invitational,
the Cardinal headed for the
Olympic Training Center in Col
orado Springs, Colo., where it
began to concentrate on speed.

Villanova and Nevada aren't likely to stand up against the splash and splendor of top-ranked Stanford
this weekend.
Normally, the camp lasts until
Dec. 16, but since 1996 is an
Olympic year, the swimmers did
not leave for home until Dec. 2.'3.
Then, from Dec. 26 to Jan. 8, the
tram returned to Stanford for
further conditioning.
"We're in great shape," Skill
man said. "We've been closer
than we've been all season [after

the training over winter break|."
The focus continues to be the
U.S. Olympic Trials, which will
take place in March. Stanford
trained for an extra week over the
break with the intention of peak
ing during the trials. This week
end's meets will provide an oppor
tunity for Cardinal swimmers to
see how fast they can swim under
pressure.
The divers have also been on a
hiatus from competition, but
unlike the swimmers, they will
not field their full team. Two-time

All-American junior Megan Gard
ner, junior Stephanie Forrest and
sophomore Holly Hindman will
compete at UCLA this weekend.
In addition, junior Britt Mattern
suffers from a back injury that
may force her to redshirt this
year. According to sophomore
Sally Mason, however, Stanford
diving should nonetheless hold its
own against Villanova and Neva
da.
"We should be able to win fthis
weekend's meets] handily," Skill -
man said.
