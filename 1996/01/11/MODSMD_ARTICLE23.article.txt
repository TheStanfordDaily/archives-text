# Wrestlers primed to take down Falcons

Having worked themselves into their best
shape of the season, the Stanford grapplers
are poised to wrestle the Air Force Academy

into the mats tomorrow at Burnham Pavilion.
The wrestling squad posted a disappointing
performance over winter break in the Oregon
Classic, which took place at Oregon State Dec.
28-29. Poor conditioning brought about by
Dead Week and finals resulted in lackluster

outings by individual wrestlers.
However, two members of the Cardinal
starting lineup, senior Matt Cano (126
pounds) and sophomore Jason Gladden
(177), managed to reach the semifinals of the
16-man brackets before losing. They ulti
mately placed sixth in their respective
weight groups. All Cardinal team members
who hail from Oregon participated in the
tournament.
Stanford wrestlers returned to campus on
New Year's Day and began practicing twice a
day. Seeking to regain their winning ways,
they quickly got into shape and shook off the
cobwebs.
"I feel that we're going to do really well
against the Air Force Academy," Cano said.
"Coach |Chris] Horpel has been working us
very hard. The team is much better prepared
than it was before or during the vacation.
We've been working very hard."
Despite being at its physical peak, the Car
dinal will find the Falcons a challenge.
"(Tomorrow's meetl is too close to call with
most of the matchups being first-time meet
ings between the athletes," Horpel said.
It is difficult to compare the two teams
because they have met only once since their
head coaches, Horpel and the Falcons' Wayne
Haughman, each took the reigns of their
respective programs 17 years ago. In 1990,
Stanford claimed victory with a score of 28-10.
This season, both squads have wrestled and
defeated San Francisco State. Stanford won
bv a score of 26-12 while Air Force won 22-9 in
its onlv dual meet of the season thus far.
