# Wrestlers primed to take down Falcons

Having worked themselves into their best
shape of the season, the Stanford grapplers
are poised to wrestle the Air Force Academy

into the mats tomorrow at Burnham Pavilion.
The wrestling squad posted a disappointing
performance over winter break in the Oregon
Classic, which took place at Oregon State Dec.
28-29. Poor conditioning brought about by
Dead Week and finals resulted in lackluster

outings by individual wrestlers.
However, two members of the Cardinal
starting lineup, senior Matt Cano (126
pounds) and sophomore Jason Gladden
(177), managed to reach the semifinals of the
16-man brackets before losing. They ulti
mately placed sixth in their respective
weight groups. All Cardinal team members
who hail from Oregon participated in the
tournament.
Stanford wrestlers returned to campus on
New Year's Day and began practicing twice a
day. Seeking to regain their winning ways,
they quickly got into shape and shook off the
cobwebs.
"I feel that we're going to do really well
against the Air Force Academy," Cano said.
"Coach |Chris] Horpel has been working us
very hard. The team is much better prepared
than it was before or during the vacation.
We've been working very hard."
Despite being at its physical peak, the Car
dinal will find the Falcons a challenge.
"(Tomorrow's meetl is too close to call with
most of the matchups being first-time meet
ings between the athletes," Horpel said.
It is difficult to compare the two teams
because they have met only once since their
head coaches, Horpel and the Falcons' Wayne
Haughman, each took the reigns of their
respective programs 17 years ago. In 1990,
Stanford claimed victory with a score of 28-10.
This season, both squads have wrestled and
defeated San Francisco State. Stanford won
bv a score of 26-12 while Air Force won 22-9 in
its onlv dual meet of the season thus far.


Aaron Green â€” Daily file
Cardinal Jay Jackson and Stanford will have their sights set on grounding Air Force Friday.
Air Force is well-balanced and is
especially strong in three upper
weights: 167, 177 and 190 pounds.
This should provide interesting
matchups, as Stanford is also strong
in these three weight divisions.
Unfortunately for Stanford, the
Cardinal must compete without
several of its starters. Freshman
Frank Ruiz has become too big for

his weight class of 118 pounds, so
Stanford will forfeit at 118 for the
rest of the season due to a lack of
reserves. Tod Surmon (142), an
undefeated senior, will sit out due to
his knee injury. Junior Ryan Barnes
(150) is sidelined for the season as a
result of a dislocated elbow.
Meanwhile, senior team leader
Sahlan Martin (158) should return
to the team after recovering from a
neck injury. Junior Bryan Vaniman
(190) will wrestle if his skin infec
tion subsides.
On Saturday, Stanford will send

27 wrestlers to the Aggie Open at
UC-Davis, where there will l>e a 16-
man bracket for each weight divi
sion. Cal State-Bakersfield, Fresno
State, UC Davis, San Francisco
State, the Air Force Academy and
Southern Oregon will all send
wrestlers to the tournament.
"We've been training very hard
for the last 11 days," llnrpel said.
"This will provide a good picture of
where we are now and what kind of
progress we've made. [The UC-
Davis] tournament will offer some
tough competition."
