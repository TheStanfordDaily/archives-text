# Grads start on-line used car service
## 
### Jennifer Brinsky 
Thanks to two recent Stanford graduates,
the hectic days of dealing with used car sales
men are over.
Sani El-Fishawy and Robert Mardjuki,
recent graduates in electrical engineering, along
with El-Fishawy's brother, Karim, recently cre
ated Classifieds2ooo (http://www.classi
fieds2ooo.com), a World Wide Web home page
which allows people in the Bay Area to buy and
sell vehicles on-line.
"Our goal," explained Sani El-Fishawy,
"was to be able to have anyone sit down at a
computer and easily be able to use Classi
fieds2ooo to find any car they want."
The revolutionary aspect of Classi
fieds2ooo lies in its use of a full relational
database, which makes it different from other
on-line classified advertising. While some
newspapers put their classifieds on-line, the
buyer still must sort through pages of text to
find what he or she is looking for. With Clas
sifieds2ooo, though, the power of an Oracle
database backs the site, cutting out this sift
ing through text.
With a few clicks on an on-line form, a user
can enter information about the kind of vehi
cle he or she wants to buy or sell and (-lassi
fieds2ooo will automatically match up buyers
and sellers.
"Our users are thrilled to discover that
they can instantly find exactly what they are
looking for. Users can easily issue powerful

queries such as 'Japanese hatchbacks built
after 1990, priced below $15,000, fewer than
100,000 miles, with air conditioning' all with
a few clicks on a very simple form," Sani El-
Fishawy explained.
Then, every morning, Classifieds2ooo's
"Cool Notify" service consults the database
and informs the user via e-mail of all the vehi
cles with his or her specifications which hit
the market that day.
Classifieds2ooo is an especially great
resource for students, said Sani El-Fishawy.
Not only do users not have to waste hours
sorting through pages of classifieds, but
advertising on-line is free as compared to $30
or $40 in a local newspaper.
As Karim El-Fishawy explained, the high
number of schools was one reason for starting
Classifieds2ooo in the Bay area. The El-
Fishawy brothers and Mardjuki said they felt
the response in the area would be positive
because of the number of college students and
the high-tech industry of the Silicon Valley.
"Everyone," says Karim El-Fishawy, "has
access to the Web here."
Since its arrival on the Net on Oct. 1, the
response to Classifieds2ooo has been astound
ing. The El-Fishawys and Mardjuki receive
dozens of letters each day from people who
love the page, which is rewarding for them,
and thousands of queries have been coming m
every week.
"Classifieds2ooo belongs to the buyer,"
said Sani El-Fishawv "Our crn.-il iv:»« in

full use of the computer to do everything for
[the buyer 1."
Included on the page are also advertise
ments for several local dealerships. The page
asks consumers to rate dealers from which
they buy, and only those deemed reputable
are allowed to advertise.
Eventually the El-Fishawys and Mardjuki
intend to generate revenue from advertising,
but Sani El-Fishawy emphasized that "buyer
feedback will continue to guide the develop
ment of the system."
The idea for Classifieds2ooo began as a
vision of using the Web to buy and sell used
skis on-line. They dropped that plan in
favor of selling used cars. Eventually, they
plan to have Classifieds2ooo encompass
everything from real estate to roommate
searches.
"The Internet is a very powerful tool," said
Karim El-Fishawy, who handles the market
ing aspect of the page, "that can be utilized to
revolutionize shopping."
Based on the incredible response in the Bay
Area to Classifieds2ooo, its three developers
have plans to expand. Los Angeles, Boston
and New York are the three spots Sani and
Karim El-Fishawy and Mardjuki hope to
reach next with Classifieds2ooo.
"Our vision is that within a year anyone
using the Internet to buy, sell or rent goods or
services anywhere in the country will come
first to Classifieds2ooo," said Sani El-
Fish nwy.
