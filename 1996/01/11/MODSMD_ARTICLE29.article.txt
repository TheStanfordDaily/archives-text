# Woolf re-written:
## Staging "The Waves" 
### 
Jw ike sands through the
fW hourglass... like petals on
flower . . . like
tailing in the forest... . Nature's
metaphors tor life are over-utilized
cliches. Vet Virginia Woolf's "The
I Waves" still rings true, its tidal
A rhythms mimicking the ebb and
flow of daily life.
The famous novel's univer
sality attracted director Katie Peterson to
write a stage adaptation. "The Waves" opens
today in 1 leanor Prosser studio. Both the
novel and the play follow the lives of m\
friends from <. hildhood to their deaths.
"It's a huge book, says Joanna Sel/nick,
who plays Susan, "and to scale it down is re
ally reductive, in a way. bach line is packed
with metaphorical meaning. | Peterson | did a
really good job."
"I had to really strip it down to the bare
narrative and see what was going on, because
drama is about conflict, not pretty
metaphors, Peterson savs. The unique dial
lenge of creating a play from a novel about
words with little plot struck her.
While she tried to be true to the novel, IV
terson says there's something necessarily lost
in the translation from page to stage. "What
distinguishes the characters are the
metaphors and images and certain experi
ences they repeat. Repetition is a big part of
the novel and not of the script because I
didn't want to bore people.'
She decided to pi*, k one metaphor for each
character and illustrate it in the first scene.
This metaphor functions as a trope for the
character throughout the play.
Peterson, a senior, became interested in
staging the production in I ebruary while at
the Stanford in Oxford program. "I was see
inga lot of theater in I ngland and feeling dis
tance 112 rom theater there, she says."It was the
firsi time in my life that I wasn't involved in a
play."
This artistic distance sparked .in interest
in directing a play. "I was becoming aware of
how a play was constructed from (the point
of view of] an audience member, Peterson
says.
After receiving a URO (irant, she began to
research Woolf. "I went to Sussex, to the
lighthouse, to all the Woolf places where all
the Woolf heads walk around.' I here, she
recognized Woolf's universal appeal.
7 he novel contains inherent confu
sion about dialogue, which the
characters must articulate. "It's not
really clear what we're vocalizing. Are we ar
ticulating ... idealized thoughts?" asks actor
Charles Cohen (Neville).

"The language is really metaphorical and
sometimes it's what s underneath the
metaphor, the feeling or the subtext behind
the metaphor, that will realh come across,
s.iys Selznick.
"Acting is an immediate intimao with the
words," says Peterson. "You have to show
those things without actually doing them.
Thus, rhythm and movement become im
portant to the play, "Katie asked me to direct
movement and I was interested because it
was not something I'd done before,' says
choreographer Jenny James.
James, trained in classical ballet, struggled
with the lack of dance in the play. "Since I do
a very structured form of dance, I want some
kind of structured choreography. Basically,
what I've found is that

what works is

naturalistic
an d .

s p o 11
tane o us
movement.'

11.mil Bin ( artist)
agrees, saying she was chosen for the role of
the artist "because of the way I moved on
stage."
Monica Bjel (Rhoda) finds the choreogra
phy of the play similar to the shape of waves.
" I here are a lot of curves and roundness in
the movement, she says.
Movement, says Bjel, is inherent to exis
tence. "You're always moving, always being
affected by forces that you can't control.
eterson's casting was done in tradi
tional show-biz style she cast
# her friends. "I got involved because
I'm dating the director,'' jokes ( ohen.
But this move was not as nepotistic as it
seems. "I detest the audition process," says
Peterson. " There were so many talented peo
ple. ... I really cast on the basis of merit'
Part of the cast's cohesiveness is due to
their time together in Oxford. When Peter
son directs a warm-up exercise, she can in
struct the >.ast to walk along 1 Ugh street and
decide from which store their characters
might buy something.
"It makes the cast very tight," says Cohen.
Ironically, the two non-Oxfordians 111 the

cast Jordan Harrison (l.ouis) and Bjel
"pla\ characters who bond with each other
and are isolated from the rest of the group.
l"his separation doesn't bother "outsider
Bjel, who is used to working with strangers.
"I like that I have a fresh perspective," she
says."I think that when you work with
li iciuls, you're not as effective because you re
too familiar.

7 he cast spent much time doing exer
cises, some would say at the expense
of the production. "There have been
a lot of focusing exercises. There's been a lot
of discussion and not a lot of running and
polishing things, Cohen says. "Ultimately,
vou have to iust uet up and do thinus."

"We'll invent a
whole scene. One

time we had
. to walk

acr os s
the stage as

though we were
going to kill someone on

the other siuc then walk as though wc were
going to kiss someone on the other side and
see how that motivates how you're walking,"
explains Selznick.
Peterson, as a director, emphasizes the
process. Her stage directions are questions
more than imperatives. "Do you think there
is any happiness in that word?" she asks an
actor.
Cohen agrees. "Because the language is so
difficult, really getting into character and get
ting into the moment is a difficult thing to
do, so you really have to work on character
and the moment and visualizing more than
you have to work on delivery or blocking,"
she says.
" I he Waves' lends itsell to this painstak
ing rehearsal process. "A lot of Woolls writ
ing is about process, the idea that it's the
process, not the end result, which is the most
important thing," Peterson says.
The work has paid off. The actors discuss
their characters as it they were good friends,
knowing their inner psychology. Cohen de
scribes the emotional wave that holds all the
characters together, "the inherent tragedy in
lile, and the need to overcome that."

Of the six friends, Neville is perhaps th.
most tortured. "Neville is gay. 1 le feels he has

Bjel describes her character half-jokingly
as "a very disturbed person, which isn't i
stretch because my life is very disturbing
right now. She has a semblance of normality,
but she's suicidal."
The challenge for Bjel is creating a con
vincing portrayal of a depressed person,
don't want her just to be the one-dimension
al psycho-suicidal character. There's a lot of
different sides to her; she's artistic."
Bui, whose artist does not interact with
other characters, suggests that her role is
uniquely theatrical. "It reminds me of tin
role of the Greek chorus," she says, "not that
my lines are a narrative interpretation of
what's happening on the stage, but there is a
connection between the characters' lives and
my life."
"The play is about finding out about your
hopes, desires. We're each a wave that has one
full cycle, then we crash and then we're n> >
more," Bjel says. "There's a high point, there
a low point, and it breaks and that's in
evi table."
Peterson sums up the play by con
necting it to the audience. "I think
theater in Eleanor Prosser Studio
... has everything to do with intimacy anil
with connecting with the audience. These
people have a split consciousness between
what's going on in their lives and the thing*
they think but can never say. They have to sa\
them to someone, and theater is partly con
fessional."
"In that way," she concludes, "I feel like
I'm doing something redemptive witl

acters singular, jl| let them be intimate witl
the other characters, (creating) a form of «

Cohen agrees. "Because the language is so

Bjel describes her character half-jokingly
as "a very disturbed person, which isn't i

right now. She has a semblance of normality,
but she's suicidal."
The challenge for Bjel is creating a con
vincing portrayal of a depressed person,
don't want her just to be the one-dimension
al psycho-suicidal character. There's a lot of
different sides to her; she's artistic."
Bui, whose artist does not interact with
other characters, suggests that her role is
uniquely theatrical. "It reminds me of tin
role of the Greek chorus," she says, "not that
my lines are a narrative interpretation of
what's happening on the stage, but there is a
connection between the characters' lives and
my life."
"The play is about finding out about your
hopes, desires. We're each a wave that has one

a low point, and it breaks and that's in

Peterson sums up the play by con
necting it to the audience. "I think
theater in Eleanor Prosser Studio
... has everything to do with intimacy anil
with connecting with the audience. These
people have a split consciousness between
what's going on in their lives and the thing*
they think but can never say. They have to sa\
them to someone, and theater is partly con

cliches. Vet Virginia Woolf's "The
I Waves" still rings true, its tidal
A rhythms mimicking the ebb and
flow of daily life.
The famous novel's univer
sality attracted director Katie Peterson to
write a stage adaptation. "The Waves" opens
today in 1 leanor Prosser studio. Both the
novel and the play follow the lives of m\
friends from <. hildhood to their deaths.
"It's a huge book, says Joanna Sel/nick,
who plays Susan, "and to scale it down is re
ally reductive, in a way. bach line is packed
with metaphorical meaning. | Peterson | did a
really good job."
"I had to really strip it down to the bare
narrative and see what was going on, because
drama is about conflict, not pretty
metaphors, Peterson savs. The unique dial
lenge of creating a play from a novel about
words with little plot struck her.
While she tried to be true to the novel, IV
terson says there's something necessarily lost
in the translation from page to stage. "What
distinguishes the characters are the
metaphors and images and certain experi
ences they repeat. Repetition is a big part of
the novel and not of the script because I
didn't want to bore people.'
She decided to pi*, k one metaphor for each
character and illustrate it in the first scene.
This metaphor functions as a trope for the
character throughout the play.
Peterson, a senior, became interested in
staging the production in I ebruary while at
the Stanford in Oxford program. "I was see
inga lot of theater in I ngland and feeling dis
tance 112 rom theater there, she says."It was the
firsi time in my life that I wasn't involved in a
play."
This artistic distance sparked .in interest
in directing a play. "I was becoming aware of
how a play was constructed from (the point
of view of] an audience member, Peterson
says.
After receiving a URO (irant, she began to
research Woolf. "I went to Sussex, to the
lighthouse, to all the Woolf places where all
the Woolf heads walk around.' I here, she
recognized Woolf's universal appeal.
7 he novel contains inherent confu
sion about dialogue, which the
characters must articulate. "It's not
really clear what we're vocalizing. Are we ar
ticulating ... idealized thoughts?" asks actor
Charles Cohen (Neville).

"The language is really metaphorical and
sometimes it's what s underneath the
metaphor, the feeling or the subtext behind
the metaphor, that will realh come across,
s.iys Selznick.
"Acting is an immediate intimao with the
words," says Peterson. "You have to show
those things without actually doing them.
Thus, rhythm and movement become im
portant to the play, "Katie asked me to direct
movement and I was interested because it
was not something I'd done before,' says
choreographer Jenny James.
James, trained in classical ballet, struggled
with the lack of dance in the play. "Since I do
a very structured form of dance, I want some
kind of structured choreography. Basically,
what I've found is that
