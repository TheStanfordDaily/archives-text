# Snow's over...maybe
## Students able to return 
### Tristan Sorah-Reyes Contributing writer 
One of the worst snowstorms to hit the East
Coast in 70 years is finally over, and stranded
Stanford students are trickling back to school.
Even though the Blizzard of '96 has sub
sided for now, more snow fell yesterday and
another big storm is expected this weekend.
Yesterday's snow came after a fierce blizzard
that dumped 18 to 36 inches of snow across the
Northeast and shut down most schools and
businesses earlier this week. At least 100
deaths are blamed on the storm.
Despite the number of Stanford students
from the East Coast who haven't yet found
their ways back, the storm has not had a large
effect on the payment of University bills, said
Bursar Jon Erickson.
"I am sure there has been some slight de
crease in the amount of bills turned in on time,
but it has not been a significant issue for us,"
he said.
Erickson added that if students have legiti
mate reasons to be tardy, the late fees normal
ly charged to their bills will be waived.
According to admissions figures, approxi

mately 15 percent of the Stanford undergrad
uate student body comes from the East.
Tuesday in New York, flights began moving
again as runways were cleared of snowdrifts
up to 20 feet high. New York's Kennedy and
LaGuardia airports opened, as did Newark.
But the Port Authority, which operates the
metropolitan area's three airports, said airline
service might not be back to normal for two to
three more days.
"Things were ridiculous with the airport,"
said stranded sophomore Jonathan Levitt.
"Newark was right in the middle of the bliz
zard. . .. There are so many people wanting to
get on (lights because theirs were canceled."
Levitt was still in New Jersey yesterday and
said he would try to return on a flight last night
to avoid the rush during the day.
Sophomore Becky Zimmerman, from
Great Ealls, Va., near Washington, D.C., got
back to school around 1 a.m. yesterday after
six of her reservations had been canceled.
"They told us that our flight was going to be
delayed because they forgot the plane we were
supposed to be on in San Francisco because of
all the delays," Zimmerman said.
"How do you misplace an air
plane?"
Zimmerman added that every
one at the airport was angry to be
delayed further and that furious
passengers were throwing fits.
"The flight attendants were
angry, too, because the hotels

they had been staying at were
running out of food and they were
hungry," she said.
Washington's Dulles and
National airports opened Tues
day afternoon, and sophomore
Chris Gregory hoped to catch a
flight back to Stanford yester
day. However, Gregory must
now contend with the four days'
worth of people trying to get out
of the area by plane and the
delays he said he anticipates at
the airport.

By now, a number of students
have missed sign-ups or the first
day of classes. The University
does not have a specific policy for
an occasion such as this and sign
ups are done on a departmental
basis, according to Registrar
Roger Printup.
"Missing the first day of class
because of storm delays is a per
fectly acceptable excuse," said
Humanities and Sciences Lectur
er Gita Van Heerden, who teaches
a sophomore seminar.
