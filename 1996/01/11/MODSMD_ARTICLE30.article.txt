tious and in
trospective
reviewer would
clearly state his or
her biases in order
to pre-empt the ac
cusation of uncon -
scious bias. So let it

be known that biography is my least favorite
genre: In its unabashed preference for life over
art, and scholarship over art, it willingly im
poses the severest constraints with regard to
linguistic and structural innovation.
When biography presents itself as a vera
cious account of a life, rather than an interpre
tation of one, it compounds the sin of its con
ventionality with intellectual dishonesty.
Often, its readers and writers arc motivated
more by idle curiosity than a quest for knowl
edge. Barely wetting its toes in the "why," it re
lentlessly serves up the answers to a lifetime's
trivia of "what, when and who" (and those
which claim to answer definitively the "why"
are all the more suspect!). Finally, its end can be
predicted with chilling accuracy.
Only biographies of writers can budge my
bias enough to crack the spine, although in my
experience, these works prove even more dis
appointing. One of the most original and inge
nious novelists of the twentieth century, Djuna
Barnes was dubbed the "Garbo of Letters"for
her glamour and zealous insistence on privacy,
which earned her premature and undeserved

obscurity, if Phillip 1 lerrington's biography,
"Djuna: The Life and Work of Djuna Barnes"
resurrects interest in her work, then perhaps it
can be excused for falling prey to all the sins
catalogued above.
"You have condensed your agony until it's
pure platinum," Djuna Barnes' mother wrote
to her regarding her novel, "Nightwood," a
brilliant satirical tragedy that is as rife with
profound insight into the human condition as
it is with the grotesquely carnivalesque. like a
sorcerer's mischievous apprentice left to his
own devices, 1 lerrington reverses the alchemi
cal process, transforming the platinum of
Barnes' prose back into her agony.
As a literary scholar, Herrington keeps his
nose to the grindstone of assiduous research
and textual reconstruction. In contrast to the
eccentricity of his flamboyantly Bohemian
subjects, I lerrington's biographical method is
stringently conventional: linear narrative in
terspersed by the similarly linear biographies
of Barnes' family members and friends. An al
ternative geometry is conceivable: If "Djuna"
were as delicious as her works, it would be
comparable to a Brach's chocolate covered
peanut cluster, with Barnes at the center of a
constellation of equally fascinating characters.
1 lerrington begins his account with the life
of Djuna's grandmother, Zadel, who, as "an
abolitionist, free-thinker, raconteur, abstainer,
known for her turbans; seizures; wit" exercised
great influence on Barnes. The fact that even
audacious Zadel lies as flatly on the pages of
1 lerrington's biography as in a casket is indica
tive of his descriptive powers. Since in biogra
phy the plot is given, its success depends upon
its skillful evocation of people. milieux and his

torical context, as well as an original slant and
thoughtful conceptual framework. In the life
and works of Barnes, Herrington has a cornu
copia of material at his disposal: the Greenwich
Village scene of the 1910s, expatriate artistic
and intellectual circles of 1920s and '30s Paris
— to say nothing of Barnes* works: "The
Ladies Almanack," "Ryder," "Nightwood" and
"The Antiphon". Yet due to his arid prose and
narrow analysis, his subjects remain distant
and two-dimensional: lunar paper dolls spied
through a low-powered telescope.
Herrington's self-proclaimed motivation
for writing Barnes' biography was the convic
tion that he would not be able to comprehend
the undeniably perplexing "Nightwood" —
which seems to revel in its brilliant opacity —
without recourse to biographical information.
Yet he beats upon his simplistic thesis as if play
ing the bongos at the Copacabana: Barnes
wrote to avenge herself on her loved ones. Un
deniably, she had grievances: namely, her rape,
or involuntary sexual initiation by an older
man (perhaps her father, perhaps her neighbor
at her father's behest). Barnes' father, Wald,
lived according to an irresponsible Bohemian
ethos that consigned the family to penury. In
keeping with his polygamist philosophy, he in
stalled his mistress in their household and pro
ceeded to sire yet another brood.
Both Barnes and her mother suffered from
this betrayal, but Barnes faulted her mother
for favoring the boys ('On me she cast the
privy look of a dog, who turns to qui/ his
droppings"), and for failing to intervene in
her father's violation (whether direct or indi
rect) of her. Barnes felt again unforgivably be
trayed by her father and grandmother when

the families separated and she was left to sup
port her mother and brothers with her writ
ing. She was contemptuous of her brothers,
who were sobered by their brush with starva
tion and compromised artistic inclinations
for security in a bourgeois lifestyle. Finally,
there was Thelrna Wood, her faithless lesbian
lover of 8 years, who would be portrayed as
"Nightwood" 's disturbingly subhuman
somnambulist.
There is sufficient evidence that Barnes
sought revenge in her writing ("1 know of no
writer as mean as 1 would be."), but not that re
venge was the primary impetus for her writing.
Paradoxically, she remained at the same time
purblind to her maliciousness, and the effect it
was likely to have on her targets.
Barnes' "dual vision" — her profound in
sights vs. her incredible insensitivity— is one
of the most vexing mysteries of this visionary
novelist. Herrington might have provided a
more illuminating analysis of Barnes by prob
ing what appear to be glaring contradictions:
her intense loyalty to friends and family and
her flagrant mistreatment of them; her early
ardent lesbianism and her latent misogyny; her
pessimism and cynicism life and ide
alism vis-A-vis art; her uncompromising aes
thetic standards and fixation on the grotesque;
her remarkably prescient character sketches
and profound lack of self-knowledge.
Ultimately, it is this absence of self-revela
tion that makes this biography a success — its
obdurately elusive quarry rather than the biog
rapher. Barnes remains, as she would have pre
ferred, occluded by the vivid figures of friends,
family and lovers, while she averts her gaze,
presenting her beautifully inaccessible profile.

Aconsc ie n -
tious and in
trospective
reviewer would
clearly state his or
her biases in order
to pre-empt the ac
cusation of uncon -
scious bias. So let it

be known that biography is my least favorite
genre: In its unabashed preference for life over
art, and scholarship over art, it willingly im
poses the severest constraints with regard to
linguistic and structural innovation.
When biography presents itself as a vera
cious account of a life, rather than an interpre
tation of one, it compounds the sin of its con
ventionality with intellectual dishonesty.
Often, its readers and writers arc motivated
more by idle curiosity than a quest for knowl
edge. Barely wetting its toes in the "why," it re
lentlessly serves up the answers to a lifetime's
trivia of "what, when and who" (and those
which claim to answer definitively the "why"
are all the more suspect!). Finally, its end can be
predicted with chilling accuracy.
Only biographies of writers can budge my
bias enough to crack the spine, although in my
experience, these works prove even more dis
appointing. One of the most original and inge
nious novelists of the twentieth century, Djuna
Barnes was dubbed the "Garbo of Letters"for
her glamour and zealous insistence on privacy,
which earned her premature and undeserved

obscurity, if Phillip 1 lerrington's biography,
"Djuna: The Life and Work of Djuna Barnes"
resurrects interest in her work, then perhaps it
can be excused for falling prey to all the sins
catalogued above.
"You have condensed your agony until it's
pure platinum," Djuna Barnes' mother wrote
to her regarding her novel, "Nightwood," a
brilliant satirical tragedy that is as rife with
profound insight into the human condition as
it is with the grotesquely carnivalesque. like a
sorcerer's mischievous apprentice left to his
own devices, 1 lerrington reverses the alchemi
cal process, transforming the platinum of
Barnes' prose back into her agony.
As a literary scholar, Herrington keeps his
nose to the grindstone of assiduous research
and textual reconstruction. In contrast to the
eccentricity of his flamboyantly Bohemian
subjects, I lerrington's biographical method is
stringently conventional: linear narrative in
terspersed by the similarly linear biographies
of Barnes' family members and friends. An al
ternative geometry is conceivable: If "Djuna"
were as delicious as her works, it would be
comparable to a Brach's chocolate covered
peanut cluster, with Barnes at the center of a
constellation of equally fascinating characters.
1 lerrington begins his account with the life
of Djuna's grandmother, Zadel, who, as "an
abolitionist, free-thinker, raconteur, abstainer,
known for her turbans; seizures; wit" exercised
great influence on Barnes. The fact that even
audacious Zadel lies as flatly on the pages of
1 lerrington's biography as in a casket is indica
tive of his descriptive powers. Since in biogra
phy the plot is given, its success depends upon
its skillful evocation of people. milieux and his

torical context, as well as an original slant and
thoughtful conceptual framework. In the life
and works of Barnes, Herrington has a cornu
copia of material at his disposal: the Greenwich
Village scene of the 1910s, expatriate artistic
and intellectual circles of 1920s and '30s Paris
— to say nothing of Barnes* works: "The
Ladies Almanack," "Ryder," "Nightwood" and
"The Antiphon". Yet due to his arid prose and
narrow analysis, his subjects remain distant
and two-dimensional: lunar paper dolls spied
through a low-powered telescope.
Herrington's self-proclaimed motivation
for writing Barnes' biography was the convic
tion that he would not be able to comprehend
the undeniably perplexing "Nightwood" —
which seems to revel in its brilliant opacity —
without recourse to biographical information.
Yet he beats upon his simplistic thesis as if play
ing the bongos at the Copacabana: Barnes
wrote to avenge herself on her loved ones. Un
deniably, she had grievances: namely, her rape,
or involuntary sexual initiation by an older
man (perhaps her father, perhaps her neighbor
at her father's behest). Barnes' father, Wald,
lived according to an irresponsible Bohemian
ethos that consigned the family to penury. In
keeping with his polygamist philosophy, he in
stalled his mistress in their household and pro
ceeded to sire yet another brood.
Both Barnes and her mother suffered from
this betrayal, but Barnes faulted her mother
for favoring the boys ('On me she cast the
privy look of a dog, who turns to qui/ his
droppings"), and for failing to intervene in
her father's violation (whether direct or indi
rect) of her. Barnes felt again unforgivably be
trayed by her father and grandmother when

the families separated and she was left to sup
port her mother and brothers with her writ
ing. She was contemptuous of her brothers,
who were sobered by their brush with starva
tion and compromised artistic inclinations
for security in a bourgeois lifestyle. Finally,
there was Thelrna Wood, her faithless lesbian
lover of 8 years, who would be portrayed as
"Nightwood" 's disturbingly subhuman
somnambulist.
There is sufficient evidence that Barnes
sought revenge in her writing ("1 know of no
writer as mean as 1 would be."), but not that re
venge was the primary impetus for her writing.
Paradoxically, she remained at the same time
purblind to her maliciousness, and the effect it
was likely to have on her targets.
Barnes' "dual vision" — her profound in
sights vs. her incredible insensitivity— is one
of the most vexing mysteries of this visionary
novelist. Herrington might have provided a
more illuminating analysis of Barnes by prob
ing what appear to be glaring contradictions:
her intense loyalty to friends and family and
her flagrant mistreatment of them; her early
ardent lesbianism and her latent misogyny; her
pessimism and cynicism life and ide
alism vis-A-vis art; her uncompromising aes
thetic standards and fixation on the grotesque;
her remarkably prescient character sketches
and profound lack of self-knowledge.
Ultimately, it is this absence of self-revela
tion that makes this biography a success — its
obdurately elusive quarry rather than the biog
rapher. Barnes remains, as she would have pre
ferred, occluded by the vivid figures of friends,
family and lovers, while she averts her gaze,
presenting her beautifully inaccessible profile.
