# A 						Moving "Cry":
## Singh discusses his new film 
### 
Stephen Kumalo is a weepy, bearish man
with ,1 voice of smooth thunder. He is
played by James Karl Jones in the recently
released movie, "Cry the Beloved (Country."
I lis counterpart, lames larvis, is .1 white prop
erty owner played by Richard Harris. Anant
Singh ("Sarafina!"), the first black South
African film producer, made the film.
Singh and I sal together in a plush San I ran
usco hotel that Miramax uses for interviews
and overnight stays. I had seen the movie .1 day
earlier. It isan epk stor\ about two men on op
posite sides of the race line — who are friends
when they should be enemies seeking revenge.
The cinematography is filled with beautiful
panoramas of the South African countryside
in Natal and gritty shots of a hellish Johannes
burg. It presents a deep view of what life was
once like in South Africa, and of what hasn't
changed.
I larris and Jones play two aging fathers who
chase down their sons in an impoverished,
morally empty and violent Johannes
burg. One is a white man who lives in a large
estate with stables and trim lawns, the other is
a black minister who preaches in a small
church with a leaky roof.
I he movie attempts to stay true to the at
claimed novel of the same name by Alan Raton,
as it relates to South Africa's present condition
of a country working towards unity.
"The spirit of what Alan I'aton wrote about
was what we had to harness to get our free
dom." said Singh from a comfortable chair in
the hotel suite.
Recovery
"( ry the Beloved C Country is a good movie
because it transforms the viewer. The film is
too mainstream and schmaltzy to go down in

history as a classic, but the story and the actors'
talent make it an engaging two hours. You walk
out of the theater more knowledgeable about
the teat of enduring apartheid 111 South Africa,
as well as about the personal trials of overcom
ing racism.
" I he story of 'Cry' is of two people, one
black and one white, coming together,"' Singh
said. It focuses on the healing process, he said,
not onlv the pain of South Africa's recent past.
Other reporters and I settled into our seats
as the movie began. When it finished, a re
porter and Ins friend were weeping two aisles
behind me; the rest of us left the theater stony
fated and somber. I lie heroism of two men
overcoming the violence and injustice of
apartheid is an emotional burden to bear.
1 hose audience reactions pay tribute to the
excellent performances. Singh hand-picked
his actors, recruiting two stars from abroad
and using South African talent to fill out the
iast. I'he international combination is stun
ning. James Karl Jones works seamlessly with
Ins co star, Vusi Kunene, who plays a troubled
minister; Richard Harris sells himself as the
older, white South African who can't under
stand why apartheid leads to black violence.
Recruiting the talent necessary to gain popular
appeal was relatively easy for Singh.
"I went to James l arl Jones five years ago
and said to James, 'I'm going to make the
movie someday and I'd like you to play the lead
role,' " Singh said. Jones was thrilled, he added.
After buying the film rights to the novel
years before apartheid ended, Singh waited
until the African National Congress' rise to
power before making the movie. 1 Je wanted to
show South Africa and the world what a na
tional reconciliation could be, but only with
the right timing. In the midst of apartheid,

freedom was the focus, not healing, and the
project went untouched. After international
boycotts and divestments, angry demonstra
tions, political challenges and finally a new
government coalition, South Africa now needs
.1 new kind of movie, he argued.
"The cinema of liberation as we knew it is
now ended," Singh said, meaning that the time
is ripe for rapprochement films, not revolu
tionary statements. One and a half years into
Mandela's rule, Singh has given South African
cinema a different model to work from. It is
based on coming together, instead of overcom
ing injustice.
"The violence and trauma of apartheid is
something I wanted to stay away from, and
focus on a human story," he said. "It was more
relevant when we emerged as a democracy."
The common ground that Richard Harris' and
James Marl Jones' characters discover could
function as a national blueprint for human re
lations, if audiences gravitate towards the film.
Box office transformation
Hillary Clinton and Nelson Mandela both
saw premieres of the movie and immediately
connected the story from the late 1940s to cur
rent issues in both South Africa and the Unit
ed States.
"The audiences that went to see the film
largely were moved by it," Singh said, raising
his soft voice emphatically, "and embraced it."
On the business side, he quietly added, "the
film has opened as the highest-grossing South
African film ever."
Singh, a small man, wore a pair of blue jeans
and a white,"(>y the Beloved Country" t-shirt
to the interview. I le was modest, gracious and
unassuming. He didn't try to charm me with
personal flash because the film is the testament
to his achievement, not to A-list friends.
Singh first started in film distribution as an
18-year-old when he bought a 16-millimeter
film rental store in Durban, South Africa.
When video came to the forefront of home
viewing, he adjusted to the market and ex
panded his business into distribution. He cre
ated Videovision Enterprises, one of the largest
national motion picture distribution compa
nies in South Africa, and became an active
player in global entertainment.
Nine years ago he began producing films,

mostly financed with his own money. His most
popular was "Sarafina!" which did well. Now
he has "(>y the Beloved Country" to add to his
list. So far it has been commended by audi
ences throughout Europe, Africa and North
America.
Reversed hatred
South Africa has successfully changed
course and become a true democracy in a ver\
short period of time. But in America wc
haven't achieved nearly as much, he said.
"It's nip-flopped," Singh added. Now the
United States is subject to close media scrutiny
over issues of race as South Africa emerges .is a
leader in shedding national racism. The roles
of oppressor, usually associated with South
Africa, and liberator, normally America, have
been exchanged in certain ways.
"The fascinating thing is that a large per
centage of the audiences feels that the film is
very, very relevant to America today, with the
O.J. Simpson trial and the Million Man March.
Racism is a big issue in America,"he said.
Singh argued that the U.S. is lacking what
South Africa has finally achieved, a national
commitment to end racist policies. The movie
transcends South African politics and, as he
said, American audiences can easily relate to its
themes of prejudice and renewal.
"Cry the Beloved Country" provokes
American viewers because there is so little
unadulterated interracial communication in
the United States. Singh has not created a mul
ticultural film in the institutional sense of the
word, with planned activities that are political
ly corrected to avoid offense. Rather be has
portrayed a vision, through his movie, ol what
can happen for a healing nation.
Surprisingly, his film does not seem overtly
political. As he said earlier, "it's a human story."
There may very well be political references in
the plot that Americans won't understand, but
they .ire too subtle to hamper the story's devel
opment.
I he film addresses universal issues of
human relationships. It leaves its mark on
the audience — people either cry or hard
en to its harsh story. But it isn't a sad
movie, it should invigorate the viewer to
look at the world again, and recast racism
into friendship.

Richard Harris and James Earl Jones muse deeply against the backdrop of the South
African landscape.
Stephen Kumalo is a weepy, bearish man
with ,1 voice of smooth thunder. He is
played by James Karl Jones in the recently
released movie, "Cry the Beloved (Country."
I lis counterpart, lames larvis, is .1 white prop
erty owner played by Richard Harris. Anant
Singh ("Sarafina!"), the first black South
African film producer, made the film.
Singh and I sal together in a plush San I ran
usco hotel that Miramax uses for interviews
and overnight stays. I had seen the movie .1 day
earlier. It isan epk stor\ about two men on op
posite sides of the race line — who are friends
when they should be enemies seeking revenge.
The cinematography is filled with beautiful
panoramas of the South African countryside
in Natal and gritty shots of a hellish Johannes
burg. It presents a deep view of what life was
once like in South Africa, and of what hasn't
changed.
I larris and Jones play two aging fathers who
chase down their sons in an impoverished,
morally empty and violent Johannes
burg. One is a white man who lives in a large
estate with stables and trim lawns, the other is
a black minister who preaches in a small
church with a leaky roof.
I he movie attempts to stay true to the at
claimed novel of the same name by Alan Raton,
as it relates to South Africa's present condition
of a country working towards unity.
"The spirit of what Alan I'aton wrote about
was what we had to harness to get our free
dom." said Singh from a comfortable chair in
the hotel suite.
Recovery
"( ry the Beloved C Country is a good movie
because it transforms the viewer. The film is
too mainstream and schmaltzy to go down in

history as a classic, but the story and the actors'
talent make it an engaging two hours. You walk
out of the theater more knowledgeable about
the teat of enduring apartheid 111 South Africa,
as well as about the personal trials of overcom
ing racism.
" I he story of 'Cry' is of two people, one
black and one white, coming together,"' Singh
said. It focuses on the healing process, he said,
not onlv the pain of South Africa's recent past.
Other reporters and I settled into our seats
as the movie began. When it finished, a re
porter and Ins friend were weeping two aisles
behind me; the rest of us left the theater stony
fated and somber. I lie heroism of two men
overcoming the violence and injustice of
apartheid is an emotional burden to bear.
1 hose audience reactions pay tribute to the
excellent performances. Singh hand-picked
his actors, recruiting two stars from abroad
and using South African talent to fill out the
iast. I'he international combination is stun
ning. James Karl Jones works seamlessly with
Ins co star, Vusi Kunene, who plays a troubled
minister; Richard Harris sells himself as the
older, white South African who can't under
stand why apartheid leads to black violence.
Recruiting the talent necessary to gain popular
appeal was relatively easy for Singh.
"I went to James l arl Jones five years ago
and said to James, 'I'm going to make the
movie someday and I'd like you to play the lead
role,' " Singh said. Jones was thrilled, he added.
After buying the film rights to the novel
years before apartheid ended, Singh waited
until the African National Congress' rise to
power before making the movie. 1 Je wanted to
show South Africa and the world what a na
tional reconciliation could be, but only with
the right timing. In the midst of apartheid,

freedom was the focus, not healing, and the
project went untouched. After international
boycotts and divestments, angry demonstra
tions, political challenges and finally a new
government coalition, South Africa now needs
.1 new kind of movie, he argued.
"The cinema of liberation as we knew it is
now ended," Singh said, meaning that the time
is ripe for rapprochement films, not revolu
tionary statements. One and a half years into
Mandela's rule, Singh has given South African
cinema a different model to work from. It is
based on coming together, instead of overcom
ing injustice.
"The violence and trauma of apartheid is
something I wanted to stay away from, and
focus on a human story," he said. "It was more
relevant when we emerged as a democracy."
The common ground that Richard Harris' and
James Marl Jones' characters discover could
function as a national blueprint for human re
lations, if audiences gravitate towards the film.
Box office transformation
Hillary Clinton and Nelson Mandela both
saw premieres of the movie and immediately
connected the story from the late 1940s to cur
rent issues in both South Africa and the Unit
ed States.
"The audiences that went to see the film
largely were moved by it," Singh said, raising
his soft voice emphatically, "and embraced it."
On the business side, he quietly added, "the
film has opened as the highest-grossing South
African film ever."
Singh, a small man, wore a pair of blue jeans
and a white,"(>y the Beloved Country" t-shirt
to the interview. I le was modest, gracious and
unassuming. He didn't try to charm me with
personal flash because the film is the testament
to his achievement, not to A-list friends.
Singh first started in film distribution as an
18-year-old when he bought a 16-millimeter
film rental store in Durban, South Africa.
When video came to the forefront of home
viewing, he adjusted to the market and ex
panded his business into distribution. He cre
ated Videovision Enterprises, one of the largest
national motion picture distribution compa
nies in South Africa, and became an active
player in global entertainment.
Nine years ago he began producing films,

mostly financed with his own money. His most
popular was "Sarafina!" which did well. Now
he has "(>y the Beloved Country" to add to his
list. So far it has been commended by audi
ences throughout Europe, Africa and North
America.
Reversed hatred
South Africa has successfully changed
course and become a true democracy in a ver\
short period of time. But in America wc
haven't achieved nearly as much, he said.
"It's nip-flopped," Singh added. Now the
United States is subject to close media scrutiny
over issues of race as South Africa emerges .is a
leader in shedding national racism. The roles
of oppressor, usually associated with South
Africa, and liberator, normally America, have
been exchanged in certain ways.
"The fascinating thing is that a large per
centage of the audiences feels that the film is
very, very relevant to America today, with the
O.J. Simpson trial and the Million Man March.
Racism is a big issue in America,"he said.
Singh argued that the U.S. is lacking what
South Africa has finally achieved, a national
commitment to end racist policies. The movie
transcends South African politics and, as he
said, American audiences can easily relate to its
themes of prejudice and renewal.
"Cry the Beloved Country" provokes
American viewers because there is so little
unadulterated interracial communication in
the United States. Singh has not created a mul
ticultural film in the institutional sense of the
word, with planned activities that are political
ly corrected to avoid offense. Rather be has
portrayed a vision, through his movie, ol what
can happen for a healing nation.
Surprisingly, his film does not seem overtly
political. As he said earlier, "it's a human story."
There may very well be political references in
the plot that Americans won't understand, but
they .ire too subtle to hamper the story's devel
opment.
I he film addresses universal issues of
human relationships. It leaves its mark on
the audience — people either cry or hard
en to its harsh story. But it isn't a sad
movie, it should invigorate the viewer to
look at the world again, and recast racism
into friendship.
