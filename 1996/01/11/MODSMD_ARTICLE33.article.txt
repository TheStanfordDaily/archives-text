# Stereolab
## space-age sounds and modern-day fun 
### Arnold Pan 
best vva\ to start describing the
I music of Stereolab is to begin with the
H obvious: It is different. A dynamo of
squeaks and skronks, pretty vocals, chinking
guitars, groov\ rhythms and more, the
band's art of sound resembles nothing else in
this dimension of time and space. Kvoking
images of stars and satellites, the spacev stuff
plays like hits for the cantina crowd in Star
Wars or the in-flight audio selections for the
lrew in 2001. Yeah, it's still rock and roll, but
rock and roll of the future for the present,
where Stereolab takes its cues from 60s pop
music, '70s art-rock and a 90s indie game
plan and creates its own uniquely 21st-cen
tury tunes.
Not only different from others, Stereolab's
songs are defined by the differences within
them. The Brit sextet combines disparate
pieces into a dazzlingly cohesive whole. With
its penchant for melding technology with
warm pop-song instinct, Stereolab succeeds
in making easy listening experimentation.
Quiet yet loud, structured yet random, the
composition of the band's pieces are always
challenging and even obscure, while they
never get away 112 rom being enjoyable and ear
friendly. I he tone of the music radiates with
serious thought as well as a happy disposi
tion, at once bearing philosophical content
and spinning a dizzying daze.
"It is the case, but 111 a subliminal, juxta
position kind of way,' replies second vocal
ist / guitarist Mary Hansen to a query about
the balance of rhetoric and good \ ibes in the
layers of the music. " I lie music is so breezy.
And then, the music is also so drone\, like in
the more linear songs, but those do tend to
make one ponder."
Six p.m., London time, and Mary
I lansen is finishing up an interview be
fore bitting the town to see guitar free,
art-noise compatriots Moonshake perform
on a mid-November night. It's a break from a
hectic schedule of touring and recording and
promotion that busied Stereolab through the
summer and autumn of 1995. The band had,
at that time, recently returned from a circuit
of Kurope, and, before that, the group was
supporting its second offering of the year, the
compilation "Retried Ectoplasm," which has
wowed indie enthusiasts worldwide since its
October release.
Due for release in April, a forthcoming
album will be Stereolab's seventh full length
(among a galaxy of seven-inch records, Hi's
and one-off split singles) in their five-year
existence. It includes material from London
and Chicago sessions, the former recorded
with long-time collaborator Paul Tipler and
the latter with John McL.ntire of stateside
post-rock band Tortoise at Brad Wood's Idful
Studios. Hansen claims that stuff from
Chicago features sounds "quite distinctively
different" from the songs pieced together in
London, attributing the discrepancies to the
"equipment we had at our fingertips [in

Chicago)," which included mellotrons and
synthesizers and contraptions the band is
hard-pressed to find in England. "There's a
lot of electronic noisesand things going on in
the stuff from (Chicago," Hansen explains.
As a whole, Hansen characterizes Stereo
lab's latest output as in the vein of more re
cent offerings, the splendid, best-of-1994 LP
"Mars Audiac Quintet" and the 1995 art-ex
hibit soundtrack "Music for the Amorphous
Body Study Center," done in conjunction
with contemporary artist ('harles Long. Call
ing the newest selections a "natural progres
sion within the band," Hansen says that the
sound has taken on "a more jazzy feel," and

that it is "slightly more sophisticated than the
stuff we have done."
songwriting duties are borne by
I Stereolab's co-founders, Tim (Jane
I and Laetitia Sadier. With a clear sense
of purpose, Cane — billed in the liner notes
of "Mars Audiac Quintet" as playing the gui
tar, vox organ, farfisa, moog, bass — creates
the otherworldly music with the help of his
varied and ample record collection. As
Hansen tells it, he "listens to things and just
picks upon little, tiny bits that he'll be able to
make something out of. Then, it'll become
our own, like Stereolab's."

The French and English lyrics Sadiercon
tributes are no less thought-provoking and
revolutionary in-its content than the form of
its musical complement. The theme of
progress recurs through Sadier's words, be it
the Marxist notion of historical movement
or a reevaluation of social mores. On "Wow
and Flutter" from "Mars Audiac Quintet,
she sings, "Look at the symbols, they are alive
/ They move, evolve and then they die." Vet
she delivers her serious message in such a
fluid and soothing register that it makes her
radical revelation seem comforting.
"[Laetitia] has very strong ideas about
how she would like things to be," Hansen
says."And she likes to get her message across
to as many people as possible, but, you know,
without standing on a platform, like Billy
Bragg might tend to do. It's a little bit more
subliminal. It contrasts with the music, so
that people don't see it right away. It takes a
few listens. Everyone says it takes a few listens
before they really think about what its say
ing. And it's quite funny sometimes the way
Laetitia writes them, since her phrasing is
quite interesting."
Take "Ping Pong," the first single from
"Mars Audiac Quintet" co-opted by MTV for
"Real World" ads, as a paramount example of
the completeness of the parts. As (lane blast s
the retro-rockets to forge a gleaming, pulsat
ing soundscape of the future, Sadier croons
her progressive manifesto in auto pilot, an
nouncing, "Every economical cycle tends to
revolve / In a round of decades three stages
stand out in a loop / A slump and war then
peel back to square one and back for more,
in her beguiling, French-accented voice. So
when Sadier sings, "Don't worry / Be happy /
Things'll get better naturally," it's easy to take
her at her word, to indulge in the hopeful
tone despite the suspicions that she's being
sarcastic or, at the least, cheeky. Hansen's
faint la-la-las running in the undercurrent
ups the pure-pop giddiness of the tune,
muddying the distinction between the hea\ \
message and cheery music.
"It's very ambiguous, some of the things
that are said in the song, and can be inter
preted in different ways," Hansen says."And
a lot of times, grammatically, things are said
in a way that people maybe think Laetitia is
actually saying something else, completely
different. There are heaps and heaps of dif
ferent interpretations that we hear from her
songs and lyrics."
The ambiguity parallels the anonymity of
the music: Though Stereolab's unique craft
isn't anonymous in the sense that anybody
could do it (nobody else does), it is in the
sense that no one part obscures the whole.
Stereolab, which includes long-time persua
sive percussionist Andy Ramsay, new key
boardist Morgane Lhote, temporary bassist
David Pajo (ex-Slint, currently Tortoise) and
a cast of contributors, sound like a band
working as a team, where there are no stars
but only space. The music clings together so

seamlessly, a simultaneous assault of pleasant
sounds, weighty textures, unheard-of noises.
! ike I said, Tim writes the music and
I aetitia writes the lyrics, and the rest of us
kind of go along with that," I iansen savs. "Be
cause I like being in the band. But I can't
comment much on l.aetitia's lyrics, except for
the fact that I think that they make a good
combination, and that it really works togeth
er. I think it's just being in the band for such
,i long time, and that l.aetitia's lyrics have
changed a lot since the band first started. Asa
band, we kind of understand each other as far
.is the music and the songs go."
lustI ust as the songs are literally about
progress, so the cohesion within the
band and completeness of its music
have developed over time. Hansen points to
the early Stereolab recording "Super Elec
tric" as an example of how the group has
moved forward with its initial ideas. Accord
ing to Hansen, Stereolab has played "Super
I lectric" at every live show since the begin
ning and that the cut transforms into some
thing else with every rendition. "It sounds so
different, and it's evolved from the begin
ning," she explains. "And it's the same song."
With its entrancing repetition of buzzing
organ blurts and swirling vocals, "Super
I lectric" holds up well on disc, the skeletal
prototype of the more refined pop songs on
Mars Audiac Quintet." Released in the au
tumn of 1991 (and reissued on "Switched
On," a 1992 compilation of the band's first
three records), it was Stereolab's second sin
gle, and it gives an indication that (iane and
Sadier knew where they were headed, even it
they hadn't gotten there at that point.
l'he two formed Stereolab in 1991, a year
after their previous gig Mc( arthv broke up.
\S 112 lansen tells it,( Jane "had a very clear idea
of what he wanted, like even down to the
name of the band." In a 1991 interview with
British rock rag Melody Maker, the song
writer pointed to the Beach Boys' "Pet
Sounds" album, artsy '70s kraut rockers
\'eu!, John Cale and avant composer John
( age as the wide-flung influences on the
Stereolab aesthetic.
Along with the new musical project, (iane
and Sadier started their own imprint, Duo
phonic Super 455, which released the band's
first single as well as subsequent recordings
hipster Anglo indie Too Pure didn't service.
Even the artwork adorning early Stereolab
releases carried a carefully meditated mes
sage. ( iane and Sadier took cells of a cartoon
from a '60s Swiss-German fan/ineand made
a series of cover artwork featuring a fellow
pointing a finger, then a revolver. While he
moves from gesture to revolution from one
record sleeve to the next, the bloke has come
to represent the band and its artistic evolu
tion, where its distinct identity remains read
ily recognizable as it continues to change.
The gun goes off with a "Peng!," Stereo
lab's 1992 full-length debut. Heard in retro

spect, "Peng!" lays the groundwork for Stere
olab's fully-realized present. Though the
music seems a step slow and the balance be
tween the vocals and the rest of the whole a
bit off, the album establishes some of the
band's signature sounds. 1 lansen and drum
mer Ramsay came aboard on the "Low I i"
record, released in the autumn of 1992.
Along with the El' "The (iroop Played Space
Age Bachelor Pad Music, "l ow Fi" exhibits
some of the outfit's most oblique pieces. Vet
where "I ow Fi" chugs then drones on, "Space
Age Bachelor Pad Music" drones on and on,
the (iroop's most atmospheric and experi
mental recording.
Having outgrown Too Pure, Stereolab
signed with I lektra to a deal which al
lowed the band to release records in
the U.K. do-it-yourself-like on Duophonic
Ultra High Frequeno Disks while letting the
major label do the work everywhere else. The
first I lektra offering, "Transient Random-
Noise Bursts with Announcements," extends
Stereolab s sound further, another novel
variation 011 the uncommon theme. Sound
ing denser and set with a darker tone, the
album exhibits more diversity from track to
track than any other Stereolab recording to
date.
Where "Transient Random-Noise Bursts"
shows the (iroop at its most varied, its 1994
opus "Mars Audiac Quintet" is Stereolab's
most coherent endeavor, nearly 70 minutes
of space-age sounds that remain cohesive
without ever getting monotonous. I lere, the
vibe is miraculously constant, though the
styles change often between the 15 tracks.
"Mars Audiac" bounds from shiny ditties
to slow, drifting numbers to roaring, soaring
rockers. While Sadier aims her critiques at an
audience, she never climbs the soapbox be
cause thinking about what she's getting at is
at least part of the point. For instance, the
swaying "Transona Five" doesn't rant politi-

call\ so much as it
reaches out 011 a per
sonal level, as the lead
singer instructs crvp
tically, "We can't
avoid dying / Burst
ing through our bar
riers," while Hansen
coos contentedly.
Ot course, Stereo
lab has its fun too,
and perhaps the
band's simplest mo
ment ot "Interna
tional Colouring
Contest" also hits
hardest. What seems
nothing more than .1
Huffy, bubble-gum
standard astounds
because its far-out
touches are so under
stated, with its ran
dom squeaks and
lusii organ flourishes
flawlessly integrated.
Perhaps the experi
ence and sense ol
teamwork Hansen
speaks of explains the

exquisite conception of the tune in specific
and the album as a whole, where literate del
icacyand intricate ambiguity result from tlu
rounded edges.

Stereolab s two
1995 self- released
albums
"Music for the Amor
phous Body Study
( enter" and "Retried
Ectoplasm" — capture
the past-present-future
of the (iroop that plays
space-age bachelor
pad music. Ihe 112 irst
gives a glimpse of
where the band is
going, with a light,
zippy sound on which
Stereolab is apparently
expanding. The latter is
a look back, a compila
tion of rare singles and
unreleased treats put
together by the band
because it was con
cerned fans were pay
ing "out the nose" for
hard-to-find records,
as I i a risen puts it.
With the mere fact
that there's a following
calling for such a col
lection, "Retried Ecto
plasm" also speaks to
the current popularity
of Stereolab. Chart po
sitions confirm that
suspicion. The I P hit
No. 1 on the U.K. indie
charts and entered the
top 30 of the national
charts while breaking
into the top 10 on U.S.

college radio lists.
Hansen doesn't believe that Stereolab's
success resulted from mainstreaming the act.
Rather, she attributes the growing attention
to the natural charm of the music and to an
audience more accepting and more accus
tomed to hearing the unknown.
"W hen people say our sound has changed,
1 think that we've moved on," she says. "But I
think the original sound and ideas are still
there.
"I don't think the sound has changed. I
think more people have heard ot it, because
maybe its been played on the radio a little bit.
As I said before, I think it's very easy to listen
to. Its always been like that."
Indeed, the original sound and ideas are
still there, even if they, and the band that
creates them, have moved ahead. After all,
Stereolab has always been about opening
minds.
"I think, eventually, after a few listens, that
people do think," Hansen says. "Now we're
getting appealing to a broader audience, so
maybe they're starting to think too. That can
only be a good thing, can't it?"
