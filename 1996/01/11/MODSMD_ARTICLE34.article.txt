## THE 						ROLLING STONES Stripped THE 						BEATLES Anthology 1 
### 
The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the
ultimate rock and roll dichotomy. Not only
did a literal artistic and commercial rivalry
exist between the two bands, but they each
chose very different images.
As a pop band, the Beatles wanted to
please you; as a blues band, the Stones want
ed to intimidate you. Thus, the prevailing
view of the dichotomy between the two
bands was established from almost the very
beginning. One was good, and one was evil.
The Beatles recorded "I Wanna I lold Your
Hand and "l et It Be." The Stones made "1
lust Want To Make I ovc To You" and "l et It
Bleed"
furthermore, as time marches on, both
bands have been presented with the ultimate
question for the aging artist â€” once one has
past his or her creative peak, how does that
artist continue? Should one rest on the mk
cesses of the past and not risk cheapening it
with inferior work in the present, or should
one push ahead, understanding that while
the best is past, one still mas have something
to give?
bach band hascome up with very different
answers to these questions. The first part of
the Beatles' "Anthology," covering the period
up to "Beatles For Sale," is nothing if not a
worship of their past.
The album is a true mixture, composed of
released and unreleased alternative takes, live
performances and interviews, 112 rom a purely
musical viewpoint, the two discs are quite in
consistent and often obtuse.
While a Beatles fanatic could appreciate
the minor differences between the original
and alternative takes, the casual fan would
likely care little that, for example, "Please
Please Me" originally lacked its trademark
harmonica part.
Nevertheless, taken as a historical work,
"Anthology" succeeds brilliantly. The discs
can show how the Beatles' creative process
worked if one is willing to put a little effort
into it.
Plus, some rare recordings from the peri
od before they signed with EMI provide fas
cinating listening. "That'll Be The Day"from
1958 is painfully raw, but the enthusiasm
somehow makes the track worthwhile. "Ain't
She Sweet," recorded in Hamburg, Germany,
is deliciously fun. Also, tracks from the
group's Decca and KM I auditions show how
the group's choice of material almost killed
their chances of ever getting a recording con
tract.
The album does contain some welcome
surprises, such as vibrant live recordings of
"Shout" and "Money." Still, the much-hyped
new Beatles track "Free As A Bird," taken
from an unfinished Lennon demo from
1977, is a letdown. Any emotional power it
might generate surely must be generated
solely by the listener.
While the Beatles are milking their past,

the Stones are pushing ahead triumphantly.
Their new, partly acoustic live album
"Stripped" is quite simply a classic. That they
accomplished this over 20 years after most of
the songs were written is phenomenal; that
they at tuallv improved and deepened a num
ber of them is unbelievable.
Taken from small shows and rehearsals
from the recent "Voodoo Lounge" tour, the
album is basically a revisiting ot the Stones'
most fertile period in a stripped-down tor
mat, taking half of the tracks from the four
albums from "Beggar's Banquet" to "Exile
On Main Street."
I he remakes are almost uniformly worth
while. "Wild Horses," "Dead Flowers" and
"Slipping Away are as compelling as ever in
the very intimate format of the album.
A number of the tracks, however, are
much more than faithful visits to the band's
past. "Not Fade Away" raises the percussive
element o! the song above that of the origi
nal, letting the song roll along freely instead
o! smoldering like the original, showcasing
('.harlie Watt's brilliant control of swing.
Mick Jagger's singing is what allows "Let It
Bleed" to rival its original version. The per
fect mixture of irony and conviction, his vo
cals can let one enjoy the song equally as an
expression of severe alienation or as a natur
al groove.
Further, the new version of "Shine A
I ight" is truly something special. A decadent
gospel track from the classic album "FxileOn
Main Street," the new version is more assured
and much more powerful, owing a great deal
to the ferocious guitar solos punctuating the
vocal grandeur of the song.
How could the Stones reinvent such a
track so brilliantly after so many years? Cer
tainly, the answer lies within the different ap
proaches the two bands currently take to
their music. The Beatles may have been rock
and roll's greatest moment, but the Rolling
Stones are rock and roll's greatest band.
