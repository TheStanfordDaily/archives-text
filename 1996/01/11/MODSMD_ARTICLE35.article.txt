# ERICK SERMON
## Double or Nothing 
### 
With sleek professionalism and calculated
funk, Erick Sermon lias once again dimmed
the lights on yesterday's unresolved charades.
Marred by the unceremonious crumbling of
rap dynasty 1-PMD and a drizzly reception
for his solo hatchling "No Pressure," Sermon
has done little else than remain calm. Provid
ing a textbook lesson in blase finesse, rap's
premier impresario has assembled a cartel of
rhvmelords destined to rebuild a sooty and
decaying hip-hop infrastructure — one
rocked by ego-ridden controversy and lifeless
posturing.
The result is "Double or Nothing," a gam
ble orchestrated by Erick Sermon and his
new I)ef Squad, a team that includes charis
ma giants Redman and Keith Murray. With
Garcia Vega aplomb and glass-eye stoicism,
Sermon has masterfully balanced styles and
sounds to create an album of admirable pro
portion and sophisticated confidence. Open
ing with the chart topper "Bomdigi," a track
of honey-glazed bass and oceanic bounce,
microphone CEO Mr. Sermon ponders his
elite abilities with metaphorical grace: "The

E-R-I-C-K gets down for the public / [I'm]
doper than Janet Jackson's stomach".
The swagger continues on "Set It Off," a
mood raiser fueled by the Parliament sample
"Ahh, The Name is Bootsy Baby," a jam of
deliriously saucy funkiness and monstrous
slap-happiness. I-.rick Sermon, nicknamed

the "E-Double" by loyal followers, places ut
most confidence in his ability to downsize
others' Herculean self-images: "I heat it up
like hell's kitchen when I'm bitch in' with this
rendition / chill or you might get an asswhip
pin'."
Yet the dice tossing on "Double or Noth
ing" seems to pay back the most when Def
Squad comrade Redman delivers his
jalapeno sass. On "Freak Out," a densely
packed concoction of heavy bass and übiqui
tous organ, the outspoken hip-hop personal
ity lives up to his blasty reputation: "I'm
funky like fat people having intercourse / Ba
sically the funk's stuck in your teeth so get
your dental floss".
Perhaps the best element of "Double or
Nothing" is the precedent it has created.
Er : ;k Sermon, a savvy dealmaker and keen
businessman off the stage, has beautifully
upped his reputation by forming the Def
Squad — rap's newest posse. Sermon, like
other past performers, may just be getting by
with the help of his friends.
