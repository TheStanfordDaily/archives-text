# ERASURE
## 
### 
Erasure arc by no means newcomers to the
unconventional. From ABBA-esque song*
such as "Take A Chance on Me" to quirky
music videos where they prance gailv in dray

clothing, they have established themselves as
true innovators in the music industry. On
their newest album, "Erasure," the duo of
Vince Clarke and Andy Bell finish up where
their '80s hit, "Oh L'Amour," left off. They
have abandoned technopop's typical vocals
and upbeat rhythms of yesteryear and as
cended into the celestial bodies of spiritual
music with their new age sound and delec
table vocals.
The first track on the album is called
"Intro: Guess I'm Into Feeling." Feeling is
definitely what this album is all about. Con
templative lyrics, harmonious vocals and
soothing instrumental fuse into a glorious
compilation of some of Frasure's best works.
The lyrics from "sono luminus" — "I'm
looking for the love / The one that can in
spire / Lift me higher, high as heaven can be"
— accurately reflect Frasure's quest for feel
ing and spiritual revelation on this album.
With their previous albums, many of Fra
sure's songs seemed forced — never given
enough time to breathe and to sprout on
their own. On this album, time is given gen
erously and judging from their new sound, it
is time well spent. Rather than opting for
radio-ready three-minute singles, they have
increased the length of each song, with their
first single, "Stay With Me," clocking in at six
minutes and 43 seconds and "Rock Me Gen
tly" at 10 minutes and one second.
Can you imagine Bell warbling for 10
minutes straight on "Rock Me Gently?" For
tunately, he doesn't try. After three minutes
of Bell's reflective vocals, "Rock Me Gently"
transparently segues into a tranquil six
minute instrumental so peaceful that it can
send the most uptight Stanford student to
sleep. Even though Bell's trademark vocals
are lightly sprinkled here and there, his
steady, uniform voice becomes redundant.
The revamped instrumental are impres
sive, with exploratory soundscapes reminis
cent of Pink Floyd's instrumental meander
ing. Throughout the album, the deft key
boards whisper in the background, evoking
sounds similar to the relaxation tapes found
at Natural Wonders stores.
Erasure has already garnered widespread
acclaim from the mainstream masses. But
with this new album, they certainly broaden
their appeal and set a new benchmark for
Erasure albums to come.
