## Sudden Death 
### 
It's been called "Die
Hard in a hockey
rink" and that's a

pretty good assessment ot what "Sudden
Death" is all about. Don't let the unoriginali
tv of the plot force you into an unflattering
opinion of the film, however. Remember, it's
not always the story that does the trick.
Sometimes it's the manner in which the
story's told that makes it enjoyable.
It's the seventh game of the Stanley Cup
I inals in Pittsburgh and the Vice President is
in attendance. A renegade Secret Service
agent ( Powers Boothe) and his team of mer
cenaries take the Veep hostage in the owner's
luxury box and demand some big-time
buckeroos from the federal government,
threatening to blow up the entire stadium it
the money isn't paid by the end of the game.
Meanwhile, the Penguins and the Chicago
Blackhawks light it out on the ice below
they and their fans have no idea that their
lives are on the line.
As ineffectual law enforcement agents sur
round the rink, only one man can make a dif

Terence (sound familiar?). Jean-Claude Van
Damme portrays a fire inspector who man
aged to wheedle a couple of tickets to the big
game tor his two kids. Unfortunately for the
bad guys, one of the kids ends up in the luxu
ry box and Van I )amme goes on the obligato
ry rampage, ruining the well-planned plot as
he saves his loved ones.
Like any stunt-action film, this one begs
a few questions. For instance, could the Se
cret Service actually be as incompetent as
the script makes it out to be? And, even with
a fireman's knowledge of arson tactics, how
does Van Damme manage to locate the ter
rorist's incendiary devices?
There's some amusing moments as well. Van
Damme battles it out with a stuffed penguin. In
order to avoid some thugs, he dons some hock
ey gear and wanders out onto the ice, where's
he's forced to stop some pucks before he can get
on with beating the crap out of the bad guys.
So it's not great art. It's not even art of the
Bruce W illis-Arnold Schwarzenegger variety.
But it is Van Damme's best outing yet. I real
ize that's not saying much, but it's actually a
decent flick.
