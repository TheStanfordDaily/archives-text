# Jumanji
## 
### 
Lions and tigers and
.. . well, Robin

Williams, the Hairy Man, make for madcap,
scatterbrained jungle adventure in this special
effects fiesta loosely based on Chris Van Alls
burg's award-winning picture book.
The title comes from the deadly board
game at the heart of the plot, a game buried in
an isolated New England town. Allen Parrish,
a very unhappy boy, stumbles upon it in I %9
and with his friend Sarah begins to play, onh
to be physically sucked into the game and
trapped inside Jumanji. Twenty-six years
later, two orphaned children (Kirsten IHinst
and Bradley Pierce) find the game and free
Allen — now all grown up into a very unhap
py man played by Robin Williams, wearing
what looks to be his "Hook" costume, per
haps due to unfortunate budget cuts.
T he problems have already begun for our
threesome, for in the process of freeing Allen,
Jumanji the board game from hell has un
leashed a lion, giant killer mosquitoes and a
gang of destructive monkeys on their sleepy
little town. Oh, no — what to do?
To make the pesky critters disappear, they
have to find adult Sarah, played by Letterman
protege Bonnie Hunt, and finish the game. |u
manji creates a man-eating vine, an elephant

stampede, a vicious hunter with an Uzi anc
other computer-generated horrors to sto|:
them. While surviving all these dangers, the
adults find love and companionship while the
children gain parental figures. Who knew ii
computer-animated beastie could solve all
these psychological problems?
The actors all give fine performances
though the formidable comic talents of both
Williams and Hunt are largely wasted as they
just have to yell, scream and run. 1 )irector Jot
Johnston keeps everything moving at a fast
exciting pace and manages to throw in a few
laughs throughout. Besides a fairly weak plot,
the most unfortunate thing is that the so ex
pensive special effects just don't look very re
alistic. The monkeys especially look like .1
piece of "Toy Story" thrown into a live action
movie — a bit disconcerting.
Adults may find "lumanji" farfetched and
thinly plotted and younger children may find
it scary, but it's perfect for the 8-13 age group.
My nine-year-old sister bounded out of the
theater proclaiming, "Ten stars!!" and the two
kids in front of me were demanding a trip to
Toys 'R' Us for action figures and the board
game before the credits rolled. For Jumanji,
Oscars and good reviews don't matter. The
real deal is the Happy Meal — yum.
