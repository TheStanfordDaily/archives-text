# Four Rooms
## 
### 
It was an interesting idea
brine together four of the

industry s "up and coming young screen
writers / directors and have them collaborate
on one film. Unfortunately, the idea was
much better in theory and the result may
have damaged some ot the directors' "up and
coming" reputations.
"Four Rooms" is set in the Hotel Mon
Signor. Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell,
Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino
each put together a "room." The only recur
ring character is Ted, the Mon Signor's belea
guered bellhop, played well by Tim Roth.
Although each director worked separately
from the others, when the time came to piece
their skits together, they discovered each had
written a dark comedy.
At least that's what the media release says.
I, on the other hand, have always believed
that a comedy, dark or otherwise, should
make you laugh or amuse you in some way.
By that definition, a couple of these skits
can't possibly be comedies. I'm not sure ex
actly what they were (the phrase "drug-in
duced hallucinations" comes to mind), but
they definitely weren't comedies.
Anders' "room" involves a coven of witch
es (Madonna and Valerie (iolina, among
others). Perhaps a member of the fairer se\
might get a kick out ol it, but I doubt it. It
there was a point or a punch line to this one,

it went right over my head.
Rockwell's "room" throws Ted into the
middle ot a rather dicey domestic quarrel.
This one actually had a chance to he humor
ous, but never quite got over the hump. I was
relieved when led escaped from the situa
tion, not because I feared for his life, but be
cause I was sick ot having to watch it.
Rodriguez does his best to save the film. 1
had just about given up hope when Ted is
roped into baby sitting tor the misbehaving
children of a Mexican gangster-type (Anto
nio Banderas). It's a tiny bit slapstick, a la the
Three Stooges or the Marx Brothers, but
quite effective.
Tarantino, perhaps the best-known of
these four young directors, does himself a
disservice by casting himself in a prominent
role in his own skit. 1 le's just not a good actor
and made the long-winded story of three
drunken 1 lollvwood-ites trying to recreate a
Hitchcock storv even harder to bear.
Although "Four Rooms" is studded with
stars, like Bruce Willis and Marisa Tomci,
eager to work with these bright, young direc
tors, they can't save the mostly miserable
scripts. It I was rating each room individual
ly, Anders' and Rockwell's would get one star
apiece, Rodriguez's would receive four, and
l arantino's would get two. Overall, it's a two
star show, and I'm betting that Rodriguez
would like to be able to disassociate himself
from at least a couple of his co-directors.
