# New program established for budding entrepreneurs

Citing the growing im
portance of entrepreneurs
to the American economy,
the School of Engineering
has established a new pro
gram to teach students the
skills necessary to turn their
ideas into successful busi
nesses.
The Technology Ven
tures Co-op Program will

place selected students at high-tech start-up
companies in Silicon Valley.
In the program's first year, only coterminal
students in an engineering discipline are eligi
ble to apply. Ten will be chosen to participate
for the summer between their fourth and fifth
years.
While the co-op programs at other major

engineering schools typically try to place stu
dents at large established firms, Stanford's
program is unique in its entrepreneurial
focus.
"It is intended to exploit the fact that so
much of the economy is based on young, new
start-ups," said Thomas Byers, consulting as
sociate professor of industrial engineering and
director of t he new program. He credits School
of Engineering Dean James Gibbons with the
basic idea for the program.
"Former Stanford students have started a
large number of companies in Silicon Valley
and elsewhere, many of which have made
major contributions to our nation's economic
strength and robustness," Gibbons said in a
University news release. "By paying careful
attention to the entrepreneurship process and
giving students significant experiences in en
trepreneur ial firms, we hope to increase the


Gibbons
probability that our students will
start and develop successful com
panies."
The program will consist of
more than just a summer job.
Those chosen for the program will
take a course during spring quar
ter which will teach entrepreneuri
al skills related to marketing, ven
ture financing, cash flow manage
ment, organization and leadership.
During the summer, the students

will work at a start-up company,
which Byers defined as a firm typi
cally having less than 200 employees
and $20 million in annual rev
enues. Students will hold meetings
and periodically throughout the
summer to discuss their experiences.
In the fall, participants will take
a final seminar in which they will
exchange what they learned about
the entrepreneurial process.
The School of Engineering will
also use the program to evaluate
the effectiveness of current engi
neering courses in preparing stu
dents for the challenges faced by
high-tech start-up companies.

"Most major engineering
schools have extensive co-op pro
grams. But as far as I have been
able to determine, none have set up
a program like this," said Byers in
the news release.
While TVC will be limited to 10
students in its inaugural season, if
the program is a success, it will be
expanded both in terms of the
number of participants and eligi
bility, said Byers.
Two information sessions —
tomorrow at 4 p.m. and Tuesday at
5:30 p.m. — will be held in Terman
Auditorium for those interested in
participating.
