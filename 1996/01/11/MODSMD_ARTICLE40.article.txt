pagne, limousines, mansions, well-designed
tuxedos, remakes. Well, it anyone could redo a
Billy Wilder classic it would he Sydney Pollack.
And it anyone was going to take on roles 01 igi
nated by Humphrey Bogart and William
Holden it would be I iarrison l ord and ... talk
show host (ireg Kinnear?
As it turns out, Kinnear is perfect as playboy
1 )avid Larrabee. I le'scute, he's boyish, heoo/es
charm. (Sabrina points out, "No one's as hand
some as I )avid, not even David") Ford is stern
but lovable as tycoon brother I.inus who lives
to make money, and in my opinion an im
provement on the decidedly dour performance
Bogart gave. Pollack certainly does justice to
the original, although for some reason mod
ernized movies just do not seem as romantic
— maybe it needs black and white.
The weak link is unfortunately Julia Or
mond in the title role. She had some mighty big
shoes to fill, and she isn't a new Audrey Hep
burn by any stretch of the imagination — who
is? Ormond is certainly beautiful to look at but
lacks the warm, endearing quality needed to
charm, bxceedingly regal, Ormond was fabu
lous in " The Young Catherine," but here she
delivers her lines with a sort of lackluster finish
and as Sabrina just doesn't captivate.
The updated plot is much the same as the
original. Sabrina, the mousy chauffeur's
daughter, watches the glittering lite of the
Larrabees from above the garage and obsesses
about the womanizing younger brother,
David. The fabulous Larrabees completely ig
nore Sabrina until she returns from an intern
ship in Paris (this time as a '90s photographer
instead of Hepburn's chef) looking dazzling
and no longer shy. Of course David immedi
ately falls in love with the new Sabrina.

But ho is engaged and the marriage means a
lucrative business merger tor Linus and the
bride-to-be's lather. Linus plots to come be
tween David and Sabrina to save his merger
(and lord busts out that lopsided grin) and
voila! a romantic triangle ensues.
I his modern "Sabrina" is cute and often
funny, but not much of a love story. The emo
tions seem to be based on the surface, a veneer
ot wealth or charm or beauty or slick wit. And
it's a hell of a lot easier to chase after one's
beloved if you can take the (ioncord, don't you
think? The whole idea of a remake seems like
an excuse not to do something new, and while
this movie is enjoyable, it's nowhere near cre
ative. "Sabrina" is supposed to be about an
ugly duckling who turned into a beautiful
swan and won two brothers. But this flick is ac
tually about a 1:30 a.m. talk show host who
turned into a movie star and won many offers.
