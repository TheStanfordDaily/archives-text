## Waiting to Exhale 
### 
"Waiting to bxhale" is .1 very
important hut very disap-

pointing movie. Actor director 1 orest
Whitakcr brings this insultingly simplistic
and hyper romantic talc of four two ilimen
sional black women whose primarv concern
in life is getting .1 good black man.
The movie, adapted from ferry Mi Mil
lan's best selling novel, has no point because
it has no plot. Whitakcr s lilm is more of a
music video, lie leads us from quasi comical
sequences to quasi moving sequences to
quasi deep sequences accompanied In bain
face's fierce soundtrack. I he mov ie s best lea
ture is its soundtrack.
Whitney Houston plavs Savannah, a
woman who either meets jeiks or married
men. Houston's acting has not improved
since " I he bodyguard. So her part basically
entails posing and moving her neck.
Angela bassett plavs bernadine, a woman
w hose husband leaves her for a v\ hite woman.
1 he film paints black women .is being pettv
and inherently jealous of white women.
W'hitaker also needed to suggest subtletv to
Bassett. I lei performance was more over the

top than when Peirdre I lall was possessed by
an evil spirit on "I )ays ol Our 1 ives.
I he only good performance of the four
main characters comes from the character

who's husband left her for a man — hut the
lover was black, so it was okay. (lloria, played
hy l.oretta Devine, cares lor her son Tarik,
played c|iiite stereotypically hy Donald I aison

("Clueless") and instead of indulging in men,
she eats. 1 )evine's a beautifully sincere actress
who has some nice genuine moments with
her newfound love played by(iregory Hines.
The fourth Monchichi is Robin, played by
I ela Rochon ("Boomerang"). She is supposed
to be a brilliant businesswoman with an aw lul
love life. She can't find the right man either.
This actress is good enough for the part. But
she fails to do much more than frown at any
one who is not Mr. (iorgeous Successful
Money Bucks with 12 inches.
Both Rochon and Houston have scenes
where \\ hitaker forces us to watch them have
bad sex with men who are too excited and fin
ish too quickly.
These women bitch about not being able to
find men with something to offer them. But
what nobody bothered to discover was what
do these women have to offer any of the eligi
ble men they want? Since their characters are
defined by their interactions with men, one
wonders what they'll do when they do find
Mr. Right. Whitaker would have us believe
they're just gonna turn on the radio, turn
down the lights, break open a box of extra
large condoms and Shoop for eternity.
