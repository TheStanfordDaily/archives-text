the spectacular rendition <>112 the ostentatious
opulence of I harles li s court. In fact, not
even the fascinating albeit tragic historical
backdrop ot the bubonic plague and vivid
portrayals of severity in the lives ot 17th cen
turv I nglish commoners touch its most out
standing aspect. Beneath the Baroque glit/
and scripted comedy stands a poignant
drama about one man's sear*, h for light in an
age ot superstition, deception anil darkness.
Based on the 1989 novel bv Rose Trcmain,
the movie centers on the lite ol Robert
Merivel ( Robert I )ownev, 11 . a half hearted
physician and lull hearted playboy. A sir
cesstul curing ot ( harles li s (Sam N'eill
beloved spaniel soon leads Merivel down a
luxurious path ot high court revelry, lor the
next third ol the film, the plot follows Meriv
el frolicking in a garish decorating fren/y,
falling into unrequited love and eventually
falling out of favor with the king.
Here, the surface glamour ol the movie
shines most powerfully. With decadent cos

tuming, lavish staging and a plethora ol gild,
velour tapestiv and neoclassical sculpture,
one could almost breathe in the air ol 17th
century I nglish Baroque madness on screen.
While much ol the visual splendor dissi
pates after Merivel is discharged from court,
the strengthening ot the plot and Merivel's
character more than make up lor it. In short,
Merivel returns to his former profession ol
healing, finds love in a madwoman (played
wonderful!) by Meg Ryan) and slowly gains
faith m himself and his work. And iiist in
time lor the bubonic plague to hit.
I hnvnev delivers a commendable perfor
mance. lie carries oil the comic moments,
vet manages to stii up a few tears during
some of the movie's more touching scenes.
David Thewlis also gives a notable perfor
mance. Hugh Grant makes a delightfully
funny and briel appearance ( v\ ith character
istic stutter and baffled looks). Michael
Hoffman, "Soapdish", directs this wholly
worthwhile movie which takes the audience
from larger than-life comedy to evocative
drama. If you're up for a few teary moments,
considerable laughs and a profound story,
"Restoration" is waiting ....
