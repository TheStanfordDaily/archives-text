, In this latest adapta
tion ol "Othello,'

first time director Oliver Parker intends to
give us a modernized, revolutionary interpre
tation of Shakespeare's famous tragedy. For
one thing, for the first time on screen, the role
of the noble general is played by an African-
American actor, Laurence l ishburne (Orson
Welles and Laurence Olivier did the honors
before).
Parker also obviously intends to draw the
audience in b\ portraying Othello to be as
dangerously powerful in the bedroom as on
the battlefield. In the title role, lishburne
does not disappoint. With a stern visage and
a grim, brooding presence, he is positively
magnetic.
And, surprisingly enough, I ishburne holds
his own against veteran Shakespearean Ken
neth Branagh, who plays Othello s treacherous
ensign, lago. Branagh truly gives credentials to
this production, l ew actors can address the
camera in sell searching monologues as he
can and still appear absolutely serious. At
times, the lines roll so tluidK oil his practiced

tongue tli.it everyone else's carefully Kliza
bethan Inglish sounds stilted in comparison.
Inglish itself is somewhat of a stumbling
block tor Swiss actress Irene Jacob ("Red") in
the role of Desdemona; she is far more potent
when she lets her eyes alone speak for her.
In making the film more contemporary,
however, Parker overreaches himself. Thedia
logue primes your ears for tamous quotes and
the visuals become cliches, like the white
knight-black knight-on a-chessboard analo
gy between lago and Othello. The setting (sup
posedly ( vprus) is nondescript Mediter
ranean, and most of the confrontations t.ike
place in dank dungeons. The costumes look
fainth Venetian, faintly Hlizabethan, faintly
from nowhere at .ill.
I he flashbacks to the first meeting between
Othello and Desdemona are poignant, but by
the time Othello imagines seeing his wife in
bed with his lieutenant — in a cra/v hybrid ol
images reminiscent of some slasher Ilick
you wish Parker would uist slick to the original
play, but if you take this adaptation for its face
value, vou realize thai it succeeds in making
Shakespeare entertaining in a mainstream
fashion.
