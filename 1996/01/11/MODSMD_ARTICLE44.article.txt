# Shanghai Triad
## 
### 
Anyone who has seen some ol
/hang Yimou's previous

lilms — sikh as the stunning Red Sorghum,
his moving piece "Raise the Red I antern" or
the brilliantly filmed "ludou" would expect
nothing but excellence in filmmaking. Unfor
tunately for Yimou's usualh faithful audience,
it seems that the famous director was unable to
fill his own shoes with his latest film, "Shang
hai Triad."
The film's plot is fairly interesting, a story
about the Chinese Mafia in Shanghai in the
earlv 19305. The narrative is told through the
eves of Shuisheng (convincingly played by
Wang Xiao Xiao), the 14-year-old nephew of
Mr. Tang, the "(iodfather" (played by I.i Boat
ian). 1 le has been given the jobol watching and
serving Tang's mistress, Xiao linbao.
As Yimou followers can imagine, his fa

voi itc actress — and, until just recently, mis
tress (long Ii is the female lead linbao. 1 ler
acting is ot its usual high caliber, playing the
mistress who aspires to be Shanghai s most
watched cabaret singer. Ihe only problem is
that she is supposed to be a luulcabaret singer,
anil unfortunately for the plot, she does prett\
well. Aside from (long I.i, the rest ol the per
formances are good, and Wang especially does
well as the young boy who hates linbao and
then comes to realize her pain.
The gangster sequences are well-directed,
but not particularb memorable. I \cept for
an interesting sequence when Shuisheng
runs through the house amongst blood
stains after a shootout, they don't have much
to offer. After the shootout, the gang's top
three heads and linbao head to an island to
regroup. It is only in a tew island scenes
where Yimou's usually breathtaking direct
ing comes through. Unfortunately, by the

time those scenes appear, the viewer has be
come bored bv a film that lias become repeti
tions and long-winded. Ihe film is no longer
moving along in plot, the directing hasn't
moved beyond decent and the audience is
practically asleep.
I'he conclusion leaves much to be desired,
not only in terms of the anticlimactic plot end
ing, but directoriallv speaking, Yimou seems to
be trying to say something moving in the last
scene but simply tails to evoke any emotion
other than bafflement. 1 wonder, considering
the fact that in a printed interview Yimou re
fused to talk about the production problems, if
the Chinese government didn't simply push
Yimou into making a film about the corrupt
politics of pre-communist China and his re
sentment is shown through the low quality of
the film. Or maybe he was iust heartbroken be
cause Gong 1 i left him.
