## Heat 
### 
From the streets ot "Miami Vice" to

the streets of LA., director Michael Mann has attempted
to take t he standard cops and robbers hunt and show
down to an epic level. After three hours, you'd think he'd
have succeeded. Unfortunately, "Heat" fails to ignite the
screen, flaring only briefly with the presence of its covet
ed stars, Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro in two brief
scenes.
Mann's intense preoccupation with lifting the genre
to another level is his downfall. Hie pace of the film,
which begins promisingly with an intricate robbery se
quence, starts to stumble into a maze of tangents that
looseh tie together the convoluted finale. If only the film
had the unity of the crew that pulls off the heists in the
film — crack professionals who work in perfect sync
with one another. The film and its multitude of charac
ters and sub-plots doesn't fare so smoothly.
The most prevalent flaw of the film lies in the lack of
scenes between Pacino and DeNiro's characters. Pacino's
intense cop, Vincent Hanna, and DeNiro's meticulous
mastermind, Neil McC Pauley, are two brush strokes of the
same painting, single-minded in their approach to their
work. Predictably, the film is intent on conveying the
parallel nature ot their lives as the hunter and the hunt
ed — Pacino as the "heat" around the corner and De
Niro ready to drop everything to beat it. The film focus
es on Pacino's team of detectives, who play cat and
mouse with DeNiro's crew.
DeNiro is captivating as the thief extraordinaire who
breaks his own credo of being a loner, leading to his
demise. His presence fills the screen with security and
purpose, something that the rest of the film lacks. Paci
no has never seemed more in control, more confident
and imbedded in a role. Unfortunately, that role is con

fined to a more or less one-dimensional cop whose per
sonal life is constantly sacrificed for the all-consuming
hunt for the had guys. Nothing new on that end.
100 often this film drowns out potential breakthrough
character explorations with cliches. Moments of
poignancy, brilliantly carried off by Val Kilmer and Ash-
Icy ludd as a young duo in crime and in love, and then
again when Pacino and DeNiro are paired together, are
inundated by the profundity of action and psychological
plays weaving directionlessly throughout the film.
When this "Heat" comes at you, you will have to think
twice before sitting through it with no expectations of
grandeur or making a clean break.

Robert DeNiro plays a bad guy very well.
