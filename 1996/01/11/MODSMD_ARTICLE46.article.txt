### 
The Super Stud Goddess of Acting in
I lollywood films, Emma Thompson stars

in the best thing I've seen all year. Thompson wrote the witty screenplay
for "Sense and Sensibility," adapted from Jane Austen's novel. Under the
direction of Ang Lee ("The Wedding Banquet"), Austen's romance avoids
being overly indulgent or cute. Lee keeps the film honest.
Thompson plays Elinor Dashwood, who's forced to move upon her fa
ther's death because her father's son from another wife inherits her
home. Thompson is exquisite gliding through each moment with subtle
charm. It you watch her carefully, you can see her character development
— a phenomenon ignored by most Hollywood actors and actresses.
Hugh Grant plays Thompson's love interest, Edward Ferrais. Although
Grant was wonderful, his costumer must also be credited for making him
look so perfectly uncomfortable in his clothes.
I hompson and (irant make an exciting couple acting together for the
tirsi time. Their scenes together could serve as curriculum for a class on
Acting i)ii Film. There is a brilliant scene where (irant is surprised to see
both Thompson and his fiancee in the same room, having thought nei
ther knew of the other. Kate Winslet ("Heavenly Greatures") plays
Thompson's younger sister, Marianne, who has her own love story. She's
an understated actress who can not only internalize well, but possesses
precise comic timing.
This film was probably expected to do poorly at the box office because
it's a British film. But you don't need a connection to British culture to
appreciate the film. You just need a connection with humanity. It's nice
to see a movie that really understands people, and this is due to the
screenwriter. Thompson also infused the script with some strong femi
nist undertones. In one scene, she tells Grant, "You will inherit but we
can't even get hired,' The novel's feminist undertones are nicely exem
plified in the film.
"Sense and Sensibility 's real shortcoming is that Lee was not eco
nomic with the final cut. The film is two and .1 half hours, but doesn't
need to be. Many shots simply are not crucial. Nonetheless, despite the
film's length, it is in every other way quite beautiful.
