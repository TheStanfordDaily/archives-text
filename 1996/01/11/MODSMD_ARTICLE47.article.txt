## Mike Noren and George Dillon Cheers to Presley, Barrett and Migration 
### 
This week marks the 61st anniversary of
Elvis Presley's birth. Sixty-one years ago he
was born, and 18 years ago he died, but
within that time, F.lvis established himself as
a quality army man, ladies' man, suave
movie star, philanthropist, husband, father,
gunman, good ol' boy and undisputed King
of Rock and Roll.
In another matter, not completely unre
lated, this week has been recognized as Na
tional Migration Week, and so it's only fit
ting that hordes offans and admirers should
migrate to Memphis on Elvis' birthday to
see Graceland — the home and final resting
place of the King.
Graceland is relatively modest in size
(unless you count the big horse stables and
fields out back) but extremely lavish in
decor. A pleasant audio headset tour tells of

the life and living arrangements of Elvis and
the fabled "Memphis Mafia," leading Grace
land-goers through a series of rooms and
telling a corresponding series of anecdotes
along the way.
The tour takes us down Elvis' dizzyingly
mirrored staircase to a room with three TVs
side by side, which Elvis would view simul
taneously. According to the headset, Elvis
loved to watch football games.
Up another staircase — this one with
floors, walls and ceiling covered with pea
green shag carpeting — we approach Elvis'
famed "Jungle Den," an entertainment
room with a waterfall running down one
wall and animal prints just about every
where. Elvis recorded music there a few
times, the headset says.
Approaching the kitchen and dining

room, the headset tells us of the time that
Elvis had meat loaf for dinner every night
for six months. That's the first sign that we
will soon be learning about his sad
demise.
Through Elvis' billiards room, shooting
range, racquetball court and trophy room,
the tour concludes with some details of
Elvis' last days and a trip to the meditation
garden, where Elvis and the deceased mem
bers of his family are buried. The site of
Elvis' grave is surprisingly plain and under
stated, with the exception of the huge cruci
fied Jesus Christ statue with "PRESLEY" en
graved across the bottom.
Perhaps more imposing than Graceland
itself is the neighboring strip mall which of
fers store after store of Elvis paraphernalia
— shot glasses, t-shirts, hats, candles,

bumper stickers, life-size cut-outs, fake
Elvis driver's licenses, sheriff's badges with
the King's picture on it and loads of stuff
emblazoned with Flvis' TCB lightning bolt
logo, which stands for "Takin' Care of Busi
ness in a Flash," Elvis' personal motto.
Still, with all this celebration of Elvis and
Migration Week, we must not overlook the
birthday of another brilliant artist of yester
year, former Pink Floyd visionary Syd Bar
rett. Barrett led Pink Floyd through their
earliest stages and later released a few great
solo albums before mental illness forced
him to quit recording altogether.
Barrett was the off-beat genius, Elvis the
flashy performer, and both were instrumen
tal in bringing the entertainment world
from where it was to where it is now.
Hence, Migration Week.
