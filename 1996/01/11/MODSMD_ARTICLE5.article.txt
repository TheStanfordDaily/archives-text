# Report urges merger of small departments
## Fac Sen to discuss planning in 'era of change' 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
In order to maintain Stanford's excel
lence as a research university in the face of
federal budget cuts, the University should
encourage the merger of smaller depart
ments, timely faculty retirement and in
creased flexibility in Ph.D. curricula, a new
report argues.
The report, titled "Planning in an Era of
Change," will be the main topic of discus
sion at today's Faculty Senate meeting. It
was authored by the Planning and Policy
Board, a committee created three-and-a
half years ago bv the senate to undertake
strategic planning.
To increase administrative efficiency
and allow greater choice in hiring, the re
port recommends that small departments
be merged.
"In terms of budget savings, there will
not be very much," said Geological and En
vironmental Sciences Prof. Gordon Brown.
"Hut there will be some economies of scale
in terms of administrative work. Only one
chair will be needed instead of two, but a
given size faculty will still need the same
number of support staff."
However, larger departments will allow
more efficient and selective faculty hiring,
as well as cushioning against a sudden
wave of retirements, which could cripple a
small department, said Walter Falcon, di
rector of the Institute for International
Studies.
Combining small departments is an on
going trend at Stanford, said Biology Prof.
Robert Simoni, citing the recent restruc
turing of the language departments into
one division. The Operations Research and
Engineering-Economic Systems Depart
ments also have plans to merge.
The report also recommends examin
ing ways to encourage faculty retirement.
Some suggestions it offers are restructur
ing contributory retirement plans, chang
ing the early retirement program and

standardizing and en
hancing emeriti privi
leges.
"There will be rela
tively less renewal of fac
ulty in the future than
there has been in the
past," Simoni said. "Sev
eral things contribute to
this, including the re
moval of the cap on

mandatory retirement and the fact that
the University is not growing in terms of
faculty."
Further, the structure of most profes
sors' pension plans provides incentives to
retire later, Falcon said.
This lack of turnover is significant be
cause "new people coming into the Uni
versity are the lifeblood of the Universi
ty," Simoni said. "The worst thing that
could happen is for all existing faculty to
stay on until they are 90. This prevents
the hiring of replacements. The reason
one would like more retirements is be
cause it allows new people to be hired,
and this is important to University vital
ity."
Late retirement also saps Stanford's fi
nancial health, as younger professors are
generally cheaper in terms of salary and
benefits than older professors, Falcon
added.
Another area which the report ad
dresses is the availability of jobs for doc
toral graduates. Despite a national unem
ployment rate of less than 2 percent for
such graduates, the committee was con
cerned.
"There is not a concern that there are not
jobs, but that there may not be jobs that peo
ple feel they have been trained for," said Biol
ogy Prof. Patricia Jones. "Most graduate stu
dents hope to go on to be professors. That is
the environment they are coming from. They
want the opportunity to do research as well


Simoni
as teaching.
However, Simoni disagreed.
"I'm not sure what the concern is,"
he said. "There is a notion that stu
dents who receive Ph.D.s from
Stanford ought to get jobs at
research universities and that any
thing less is failure. Hut I do not
think it is a failure."

Hut Simoni added that the
unemployment data is averaged
across all disciplines and that in
some areas such as physics, there
may be more severe problems with
job shortages than in others such
as biology.
In order to deal with this con
cern, the report advises depart
ments to restructure doctoral pro
grams so as to be more versatile.
For example, a department such as
biology could give its doctoral stu
dents more training in a field such

as biotechnology, Jones said.
The report also advises that
potential doctoral students be pro
vided with information about job
prospects, and doctoral completion
rates and durations in their fields.
Despite the fact that Stanford's
research funds have grown 3 per
cent over the last 20 years, the
report argues there have been sev
eral negative trends and a general
expectation that research funds
will decline in the future. The Fac
ulty Senate first discussed advising

graduate students of their poten
tial job opportunities last spring.
The growth in research funds
has affected schools unevenly, the
report says. School of Medicine
research funds have increased
while School of Engineering funds
have decreased. This difference is
largely due to the budget process in
Washington. For example, Nation
al Institutes of Health funding
(which pays for medical research)
has increased while National Sci
ence Foundation funding (which

pays for engineering research) has
decreased, Simoni said.
Further, professors also must
write more grants in order to
receive the same amount of money.
"Stanford professors are work
ing very hard to keep research rev
enues up," Falcon said. "They are
putting in more grant applications
and doing more revisions. They are
receiving a greater number of
smaller grants. This is a great
source of faculty unhappiness."
More time spent grant-writing

can be harmful because it detracts
from other research and teaching
activities, Simoni said.
The report also recommends
that money be set aside for cush
ioning the effects of tuition remis
sion and for funding equipment
purchases as required by grants.
Additionally, it suggests that
tenured faculty be encouraged to
teach more introductory-level
undergraduate courses and that
faculty be consulted before major
changes in research policy.

"There is not a concern that there are not
jobs, but that there may not be jobs that peo
ple feel they have been trained for," said Biol
ogy Prof. Patricia Jones. "Most graduate stu
dents hope to go on to be professors. That is
the environment they are coming from. They
want the opportunity to do research as well

as teaching.
However, Simoni disagreed.
"I'm not sure what the concern is,"
he said. "There is a notion that stu
dents who receive Ph.D.s from
Stanford ought to get jobs at
research universities and that any
thing less is failure. Hut I do not
think it is a failure."

Hut Simoni added that the
unemployment data is averaged
across all disciplines and that in
some areas such as physics, there
may be more severe problems with
job shortages than in others such
as biology.
In order to deal with this con
cern, the report advises depart
ments to restructure doctoral pro
grams so as to be more versatile.
For example, a department such as
biology could give its doctoral stu
dents more training in a field such

as biotechnology, Jones said.
The report also advises that
potential doctoral students be pro
vided with information about job
prospects, and doctoral completion
rates and durations in their fields.
Despite the fact that Stanford's
research funds have grown 3 per
cent over the last 20 years, the
report argues there have been sev
eral negative trends and a general
expectation that research funds
will decline in the future. The Fac
ulty Senate first discussed advising

graduate students of their poten
tial job opportunities last spring.
The growth in research funds
has affected schools unevenly, the
report says. School of Medicine
research funds have increased
while School of Engineering funds
have decreased. This difference is
largely due to the budget process in
Washington. For example, Nation
al Institutes of Health funding
(which pays for medical research)
has increased while National Sci
ence Foundation funding (which

pays for engineering research) has
decreased, Simoni said.
Further, professors also must
write more grants in order to
receive the same amount of money.
"Stanford professors are work
ing very hard to keep research rev
enues up," Falcon said. "They are
putting in more grant applications
and doing more revisions. They are
receiving a greater number of
smaller grants. This is a great
source of faculty unhappiness."
More time spent grant-writing

can be harmful because it detracts
from other research and teaching
activities, Simoni said.
The report also recommends
that money be set aside for cush
ioning the effects of tuition remis
sion and for funding equipment
purchases as required by grants.
Additionally, it suggests that
tenured faculty be encouraged to
teach more introductory-level
undergraduate courses and that
faculty be consulted before major
changes in research policy.
