First, she asked permission to speak from her
heart. She did, drawing applause throughout her
moving speech.
NAACP Chairperson Myrlie Evers-Williams,
keynote speaker for the Martin Luther King Jr.
commemoration program, won two standing ova
tions last night in Tresidder Oak Lounge. The
crowd of about 60 listened with enthusiasm as
Evers-Williams evoked King's visions for the fu
ture and shared her own ideas for change.
"We are living in a time when we must take into
our hands our destinies and our futures. We can
not depend on anyone else to do that for us. To do
so is the ultimate mistake," said Evers-Williams.
"We must build our own economic base and be
come our own bankers. We must stop blaming
everyone for what is happening to us. We have the
strength and the power and the money. We have it
all to become strong and determine our future."
Evers-Williams knew King personally, plavinga
supporting role as her late husband, Med gar Evers,
worked with him to "change America into a better
place for each and every one of us." She remem
bered King as a man of vision who believed in
"equality, justice, freedom and the pursuit of hap
piness for his people and America as a whole."
At a tribute to King, Evers-Williams walked
with her daughter and Robert and Ethel Kennedy,
and as "we walked, we talked about the contribu
tions that Martin Luther King had made, and the
importance of others in carrying on the dream so

the dream would become a reality."
Evers-Wiliiams carried on the
dream through her civil rights
activism, which culminated
recently in her election as chair
person of the NAACP, a position
that she won by one vote.
"We must persevere. Never
lose sight of what your goals are,"
said Evers-Williams. She exhort
ed the audience to keep their eyes
"on the prize" and pull to move

generations together, "so people
of different races can communi
cate and work together."
After talking about King,
Evers-Williams offered her views
on the current America. "I'm not
sure it knows what it is, and I'm
not sure it knows what it wants to
be," she said.
"I look at an America that has
become mean," added Evers-
Williams, launching into an attack
of "those in high places who rep
resent us. There is a mean-spirit
edness here. Let's not fool our
selves. You can call him Newt or
Nit — someone who would dare

work to pit one ethnic group
against another."
Evers-Williams also criticized
California Gov. Pete Wilson for
his stance against affirmative
action and called the idea of the
"angry white male" a manufac
ture.
As a final note, Evers-Williams
insisted that, "as we move for
ward, and as we look for new
approaches, do not forget the past.
Do not linger in it, but use it as
information."
The commemoration will con
tinue through the rest of the
month.
