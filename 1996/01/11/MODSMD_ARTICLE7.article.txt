# New group combines music and service

For many recent graduates of Stan
ford, advanced studies in medicine, law or
business loom ahead.
But this was not the case for Andrew
Turitz, who graduated last June and ac
cepted the position of managing director
of the newly formed Amphion Benefit
Productions.
Amphion, which was founded by its ex

ecutive director, Andrew Lisac, uses the
power of music for public good. The three
main goals of Amphion, according to
Lisac, are to raise funds, research non
profit organizations in need of fund-rais
ing help and educate the music-loving
public.
Turitz and Lisac met when Lisac
served as Turitz's freshman adviser at
Stanford. Turitz's focus on a career in the
music industry attracted Lisac's atten
tion, and he offered Turitz the position at

Amphion as he was preparing to gradu
ate.
Lisac, a member of the Class of '81,
performed in Bay Area punk bands such
as The Leather Scabs and Toxic Shock
while a student. Until last year, Lisac was
assistant dean of continuing studies and
of the summer session at Stanford and
resident felJow at Muwekma-tah-ruk, the
Native American theme house. Current-
Iv, in addition to his position as
executive director of Amphion,
Lisac is serving on San Francisco
Mayor Willie Brown's transition
team, which is assembling the
mayor's new administration.
According to Turitz, Amphion
will "focus on grassroots organi
zations in the Bay Area doing pro
gressive work." Presently Turitz
and Lisac are reviewing and
researching the organizations
themselves. As word spreads
about Amphion, a definite review
process will be set up, Turitz said.
The board of directors and the
advisory board of Amphion will be
involved in reviewing organiza
tions.
The first major event Amphion
plans to produce is The San Fran
cisco Groove Fest. The Groove
Fest will be held Jan. 18 at Club
1015. MoTVssionals, Big Brutha
Soul, One Nation Underground
and Los Angelitos are scheduled
to perform.

The Groove Fest will benefit
Project Open Hand and the San
Francisco Food Bank, both of
which provide food to the home
less, sick or poor.
Representatives from the two
nonprofit organizations will be on
hand at The Groove Fest to
answer questions. Lisac said orga
nizers will stress that the event is
a benefit as well as a chance to
enjoy the local music scene.
Amphion has many ideas for
events after The Groove Fest.
Possibilities include Life Beat,
which will enable the music
industry to help organizations
which benefit AIDS causes; an
anti-hate, anti-violence concert
which will bring together differ
ent groups from various parts of
society; and a project called Green
Team involving environmental
organizations.
Lisac said he thought Turitz's
position as managing director was
an outstanding opportunity
because, at 23, Turitz "is already
producing and in contact with
people in the music industry with
whom he would not have had the
chance to meet had he started at a

record company."
While at Stanford, Turitz —
who plays the violin, piano and
guitar and was a member of the
band Fez — did promotion for Vir
gin Records and publicity for
Windham Hills Records in Palo
Alto.
This fall, while building the
foundation for Amphion, Turitz
and Lisac have been meeting with
representatives of the music
industry and non profit organiza
tions. The two are confident their
plan to build an organization
which uses music for public good
is excellent in theory, but they
needed help to put the theory into
practice.
"We hope to establish a tradi
tion in the Bay Area that links
music and good causes so effec
tively, it will be taken for granted
that a public concert gives some
thing back to the public," Lisac
said.
Tickets are $12 if purchased in
advance and $15 at the door. Tick
