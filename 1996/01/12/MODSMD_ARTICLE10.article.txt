# Price drops for Flicks passes

The intrepid bargain-hunter is finally being
rewarded. The price of admission to Stanford's week
ly paper-throwing movie event is dropping.
The price of a Flicks pass has fallen from $20 to $15
this quarter, and Hicks Manager Craig Zajac is hoping
that more students will buy passes in recognition of
the better deal.
Zajac said the number of times a Flicks pass is used
in a quarter averages around six — so when an indi
vidual ticket is only $3, the $20 pass isn't a deal.
"People just weren't getting their money's worth,"
said Zajac. "Last quarter, individual ticket sales were
up, but pass sales have dropped a lot."
Stanford Band manager Josh Schiller said he was
happy pass prices has dropped. Traditionally, most
band members attend flicks on a regular basis.
"Our attendance hasn't dropped over the past few
years with the rise in prices, but we are glad the price
is going down anyway," said Schiller. "It saves every
one money, including us."
In the past, Flicks has usually made a healthy prof
it, and Zajac is not worried that the price reduction
will hurt Flicks financially.
"Pass sales are going verv well right now," he said,

"and I think enough more will be sold because the
price is at $15."
Toni Marengo, resident assistant in Naranja, said
she could see the reduction in price making a differ
ence in sales. "I made a deadline for midnight last
night, and there was a good response," she said.
"Some of the residents were really happy with the
selection of movies, but a lot were calculating how
many of the movies they would want to see — the
price reduction changes things because now seeing
only five flicks is a deal, she added.
Pass sales for Flicks were down last quarter, but
Zajac said he didn't think it was because of the price of
the pass. "We had a weak crop of summer movies, and
there was not a good artsy-comedy flick last quarter; I
doubt there will be any Academy Awards out of that
bunch," he said. "The films were mainstream, and we
lacked the something-for-everyone style."
Zajac said this was the impetus for putting both
"Heathers" and "Brothers McMullen" into this quar
ter's schedule. "If you have even one cult flick it will
increase pass sales. It fills the pseudo-artsy genre.'
Zajac said the decision to lower the price of the pass
was made with a "we'll see what happens" attitude,
and that he would like to keep the new price for spring
quarter. "It doesn't damage us financially, and it's
better service for the students," he said.
