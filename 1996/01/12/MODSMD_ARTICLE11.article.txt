## Clinton stands behind Hillary Travel office scandal gets messy 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Addressing pointed
questions about his wife, President Clinton said
yesterday she will do "whatever is necessary" to
clarify her role in the White House travel office
firings and the tangled Whitewater affair.
Allegations about her conduct are "not the
same thing as fact," Clinton said at his first major
news conference in five months. He said White
water questions are "apparently part of the price"
of his presidency, and he expressed sympathy for
staff members facing big legal bills even though
they are "completely innocent of any wrongdo
ing."
Clinton offered a rousing defense of first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and expressed exaspera
tion at suggestions that his administration has
not cooperated fully with Congress and investiga
tors.
While declaring that Mrs. Clinton should "fully
answer" all questions, the president stopped short
of saying she would testify before congressional
committees. Republican lawmakers have suggest
ed her testimony might be necessary.
When it comes to the Whitewater affair
involving a bungled real estate deal and a failed
savings and loan — the allegations have "virtual
ly always borne no relationship to the fact," he
said. "An allegation comes up and we answer it,
and then people say, 'Well, here's another allega
tion, answer this.' And then, Here's another alle
gation, answer this."
"An allegation is not the same thing as a fact,"
the president said.
Separately, in an interview to be aired tonight
on the ABC-TV news program "20/20," Mrs. Clin
ton denied ordering the 1993 travel office firings
despite White House documents portraying her as
the architect of the dismissals. She said she only
expressed concern "about the financial misman
agement that was discovered when the president
arrived" in 1993.
"I think that everyone who knew about it was
quite concerned and wanted it to be taken care
of," Mrs. Clinton said. "But I did not make the
decisions. I did not direct anyone to make the
decisions."
Other documents suggest that Mrs. Clinton
was more active than she has acknowledged in
representing the failed Arkansas thrift that is at
the heart of the Whitewater affair.
Taking the same line as the president, she said
she would do "whatever it takes to cooperate"
with congressional investigators.
"At the end of the day the American public will
know we have nothing to cover up," she said.
"There is nothing that we have done that should
be of any concern to anyone.
At his news conference, Clinton acknowledged
that various investigations — including a sexual
harassment suit filed by Arkansan Paula Jones
could bankrupt him. He said he felt badly that 20
years of his savings may be lost on legal expenses
but "if I stay healthy, I'll be able to pay my bills
and earn a pretty good living."
The president said taxpayers should not shoul
der any of his legal costs.
Despite suggestions that Mrs. Clinton might be
a liability in his reelection campaign, Clinton said
the first lady will keep a high profile.
