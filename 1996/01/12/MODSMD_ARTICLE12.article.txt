# Thousands mourn at Mitterrand's funeral

### 
PARIS (AP) — Francois Mitterrand
was laid to rest yesterday with his own
thoughts on life and death ringing in
the ears of the kings, princes and presi
dents who came to Notre Dame cathe
dral to bid him farewell.
"Is there not, in man, a bit of eterni
ty that death gives birth to?" Mitter
rand mused in recently published writ
ings, which Cardinal Jean-Marie
Lustiger quoted in his eulogy.
Mitterrand, the Socialist who led
France longer than anyone else this
century, died Monday of prostate cancer
at 79.
In accordance with his wishes, a
simultaneous ceremony for relatives
and friends was held in his hometown of
Jarnac, in southwest France. Mitter
rand's body, flown from Paris at dawn,
was placed in his family's tomb there.
In Paris, some 250 world leaders and
dignitaries slowly filed into the packed
cathedral, taking their places in small
wooden and wicker chairs facing
Lustiger's pulpit. African presidents
and Saudi princes arrived in bright,
flowing robes, accompanied by wives
and uniformed generals.
Mitterrand's longtime friend and
political ally, Chancellor Helmut Kohl
of Germany, shed tears as a choir sang.
The two leaders, who had hold hands
during a recent World War 1 commemo
ration, were together the strongest pro

moters of the European Union.
Vice President A 1 Gore sat in the sec
ond row behind the president of Togo.
Russia's Boris Yeltsin, Britain's Prince
Charles, Cuba's Fidel Castro, Spain's
King Juan Carlos, Sweden's King Carl
XVI and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak were among those seated in
the front row reserved for heads of
state.
On the plaza outside, hundreds
watched a large screen broadcasting the
Mass.
"The whole world sent its leaders to
salute Francois Mitterrand," Loic
Ducos, a 19-year-old philosophy stu
dent, said as he watched the screen
before Mass began. "I'm really very
happy and honored to be here. I'll
remember this for the rest of my life."
At Mitterrand's birthplace, Jarnac,
the service was off-limits to all but about
200 relatives and close friends, but loud
speakers carried the funeral Mass to the
crowds that gathered outside St. Pierre
Church. Mitterrand's parents were mar
ried in the austere 12th-century stone
chapel, and he was baptized and received
his first communion there.
As she walked from her car toward
the church, Mitterrand's widow,
Danielle, stared at the ground, a son on
each arm, Jean-Christophe and Gilbert.
Mitterrand's longtime mistress, Anne
Pingeot, and their 21-year-old daugh
ter, Mazarine, walked behind them.
"He brought light into obscurity. He
fought against injustice," regional Bish
op Claud Dagens said in his eulogy of the
man who led France from 1981 to 1995.
At least 10,000 mourners more than
doubled Jarnac's population. People
began lining the streets near the church
well before dawn, massing behind steel
police barricades in hopes of one last
glimpse of their former leader.
Church bells pealed funereal hymns
and onlookers huddled beneath black
umbrellas to keep the cold drizzle away.
Some sang the hymns as the bells tolled.
After the service, Mitterrand's sim
ple oak coffin, embossed with a golden
cross, was brought out of the church
and placed into a blue hearse for the
short drive to the family crypt.
Mitterrand was buried in his family's
simple, stone tomb in Grandes Maisons
cemetery, before a small circle of family
and friends. Two bouquets of roses and
irises were left on his grave, as he
requested, but anonymous well-wishers
quickly added a small mountain of red
roses — the Socialist Party symbol.
President Jacques Chirac, who on
Monday delivered a stirring speech on
national television in honor of his old
rival, declared yesterday a national day
of mourning.
