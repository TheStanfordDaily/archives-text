# An internal alarm
## Study shows people are able to wake themselves up 
### 
DECORAH, lowa (AP) — You're in a strange place,
there's no alarm clock and it's important to wake up
early.
Do you stay up all night? Luther College Professor
Bill Moorcroft said many people have discovered a bet
ter way — the brain's own no-clock alarm.
"Not everybody can do it. There are some who need
three alarm clocks and a bucket of ice to get up. But
many people really can do it on their own," Moorcroft
said.
That's one view.

Critics say it's poppycock.
"This is an old wives' tale. People have studied this
since the 19205.
"They say they can wake up any time they want,
but what it comes down to is, all the evidence comes
from their own reports. You don't have any objective
statistics," said Harold Zepelin, a professor of psychol
ogy at Oakland University in Rochester, Mich.
Some people, he said, might be able to wake up if
they have a regular sleep pattern and if their intended
wake-up time corresponds to the cycles of rapid eye

movement sleep. REM occurs every 80 to 100 minutes.
Greg Mader, an official for the American Sleep Dis
order Association in Rochester, Minn., said the topic
has been batted back and forth in the group's periodi
cal Sleep.
Moorcroft, however, said he has new ammunition.
"The problem with other surveys is, you ask people
the results but you're never sure they tell the truth,"
he said.
Moorcroft recruited 15 volunteers, aged 19 through
62, who claimed thev had an internal alarm. Each was

asked to set a time to wake up without any external
alarms. Each was given three tries, thus providing 45
tests, and some varied the wake-up time at least once.
Of those 44 nights, 18 of the subjects awoke 15 min
utes or less before the stilted time. Another 10 were
late by no more than 15 minutes.
"The interesting thing, and we didn't expect this, is
that the ones who had one or more different times
were more successful than those who had the same
time. 1 have no idea why. It's counterintuitive," he
said.
