Shuttle blasts off
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
Warmed by heaters to keep its O-rings
supple, space shuttle Endeavour lifted
off with six astronauts yesterday in the
coldest launch weather since the Chal
lenger disaster and began chasing a sci
ence satellite.
The astronauts plan to capture the
Japanese satellite on Saturday, their chief
job in orbit during the nine-day flight.
Endeavour began the 300-mile-high
chase with a brilliant early-morning
launch.
"It was a great ride uphill," com
mander Brian Duffy said.
It was 44 degrees for the 4:41 a.m.
liftoff, the lowest temperature at launch
since Challenger exploded on Jan. 28,
1986, and the second-lowest ever in 15
years of shuttle flight. The timing was
dictated by the course the shuttle must
follow to catch the satellite.
The temperature was 36 when Chal
lenger blew up after launch, killing all
seven crew members. Investigators said
the cold had stiffened the O-rings in the
shuttle's booster rockets, allowing hot
gas to leak through a joint.
One pike's revenge
KONAKOVO, Russia (AP) — One
Russian fisherman has a story about
the big one that he wished had gotten
away.

According to an ITAR-Tass news
agency report yesterday, the man and
some ptils were ice-fishing on the Ivanko
vo reservoir about 60 miles northwest of
Moscow when he caught a 28-inch pike.
Showing off for his buddies, he raised
the fish high and kissed it on the mouth.
The pike clamped down hard on the
fisherman's nose.
The pike's jaws remained tightly
locked on the fisherman's nose even
after his companions beheaded it-
Doctors at a local hospital finally set
the man free. ITAR-Tass did not say
when the incident happened.
Stormy skies
(AP) — The third storm in a week
made its relentless way eastward yes
terday, blanketing the Midwest and
sending snow-weary residents scram
bling to stock up on supplies.
Five inches fell on Pulaski, Indiana,
and three inches fell in the Chicago area
as the storm picked up speed. Winter
advisories were posted from the
Appalachians to the Carolinas and the
mid-Atlantic coast, where forecasters
predicted either a foot of snow or rain or
freezing rain tomorrow.
"I don't want it," JoAnn Udes of Bal
timore groaned. "I've had enough."
Most people were still trying to navi
gate snow-stuffed sidewalks buried in
the weekend's blizzard, a storm blamed
for at least 100 deaths.
