# Hashimoto elected to be prime minister

TOKYO (AP) — It was Ryutaro Hashimoto's
moment in the sun.
Thirty-two years after he first entered Parliament,
the tough trade negotiator with the slicked-back hair
was elected yesterday as Japan's prime minister in an
overwhelming vote by his colleagues.
Yet in the magazines and on television, the talk
was of another man: Ichiro Ozawa, the opposition
leader and self-styled reformer.
It is Ozawa's strategy and his proposals for over
hauling Japan's government that have shaped
Japanese politics in the past three years. And the sur
vival of Hashimoto's new government could hang on
the effectiveness of Ozawa's attacks.
The first round went to Hashimoto.
Packed by his Liberal Democratic Party and its
coalition ally, the Socialist party, Hashimoto defeated
Ozawa 287 to 166 in the parliamentary vote.
But Ozawa, leader of the New Frontier Party,
wasted no time in fighting back.
Denouncing the coalition as an "illicit cohabita
tion," he demanded an immediate popular vote.
Hashimoto, 58, best-known for his successful
hard-line stand at auto trade talks last year with the
United States, has made his name as an ally of the
career bureaucrats whom Ozawa has criticized.
Among the reforms Ozawa, 53, has proposed is
breaking down the grip of the government bureaucra
cy. He accuses the bureaucracy of slowing down eco
nomic growth with red tape as well as of fostering an
irresponsible follow-the-leader mentality.
The two men's clashes are expected to dominate
Japanese politics, at least for the next half-year,
beginning with the dispute over the government's
plan to use $6.5 billion in taxpayer money to rescue
failed housing lenders.
