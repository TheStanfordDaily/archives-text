## Admission approval 
### 
The initial figures on
Stanford's new early admis
sion program are in and it
appears that the change has met
with early success.
Opponents of the plan had said
that early decision would lower the
quality of the applicant pool and
pressure high school seniors into
making a decision they may not have
been prepared to make.
But the numbers have not only
proved the skeptics wrong, they
exceeded the expectations of the
Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions. Over 3,000 early applications
were received. Those accepted could
possibly fill greater than 35 percent
of the slots available for the Class of
2000.
The large number of early admits
has not compromised the academic
integrity of the incoming freshman
class. According to Dean of Under
graduate Admissions and Financial
Aid James Montova, "The qualitv

and quantity of the early decision
pool is well beyond our expecta
tions. . . . The early decision chuss we
admitted in December is stronger
than any freshman class admitted in
all previous years."
Montoya's statement also puts to
rest the assumption that less-quali
fied candidates who decide that Stan
ford is their first choice will take the
spots from more-talented and quali
fied candidates who apply later.
Admittedly, while it is gratifying
to see so many gifted and capable
students apply, the possible pres
sures brought on by the Early Deci
sion I and 11 plans could still present
a problem.
Nevertheless, such concerns
should not dim the great accomplish
ment of the Admissions Office.
According to initial indications at
least, it has successfully streamlined
the application and evaluation pro
cess and maintained, if not sur
passed, standards of quality.
