## The 						fumes of passion 
### 
WHEN MY IOTH-grade English
teacher gave as the first assign
ment of the year a "compare and
contrast" essay, I chose divorce versus
death — the two possible final outcomes of
marriage — as my subject. Amid scores of
papers on the merits of dogs versus cats or
the advantages of hamburgers versus hot
dogs, Mrs. Sutherland was apparently
shocked by my essay.
At the end of class, she wanted to speak
with me. "I can't believe someone so young
could be so cynical," she said, waving the
two pieces of notebook paper at me.
"Just wait," I could have said. "I'm get
ting older."
Despite the reprimand, the genre
remains one of my favorites. However, in
the interest of dealing with the greatest
forces in my own life on a more fundamen
tal level, I have revised the terms of com
parison. "Divorce" has become the more
immediate "girlfriends," and "death" the
more tangible "cigarettes." Girlfriends ver
sus cigarettes. Essentially a more appropri
ate choice, at my young age — whether I
would prefer divorce or death as an even
tual goal.
The comparison is natural for me
because 1 took up smoking about three
months ago, when I broke up with my girl
friend of three years. Immediately, it start
ed. "Those things'll kill you, Josh," or
"Please quit smoking, Josh," or "You're a
filthy, worthless addict, Josh."
That was when I began wondering
where all these concerned people were

when 1 started dating my girlfriend.
Nobody said "Don't do it, Gohlke," or "Bad
for your health, Gohlke," or "Addictive,
Gohlke — and dangerous."
No worried relatives admonished that
"If your mom finds out you have a girl
friend, you're dead."
When I showed up at a party with her
on my arm, no concerned confidante pulled
me aside to say "Look, I'll give you my pills,
you give me the girl. We'll both try to quit."
One might search through the papers
forever in vain for the proper support
group. "Break up within ONE month!"
And what if one succeeds on his own?
"I quit smoking."
"Congratulations."
"I dumped my girlfriend."
"Bastard."
I of available help is not the only fac
tor that makes the girlfriend habit more
pernicious than the smoking. For instance,
I would probably have to smoke for 15-20
more years to get lung cancer, while it has
never taken a girl more than eight months
to completely ruin my life.
Everyone pointedly laments my finan
cial fate. "Oh, man, cigarettes are so expen
sive." But then, they cost me less than 10
bucks a week. I've never been on a date
that cheap.
With cigarettes, I know exactly what
I'm getting into, because all the worst pos
sible outcomes are printed right there on
t he package. My girlfriend bore no equiva
lent government-mandated labeling on the
tags of her clothing, such as "The Surgeon

General has determined that this woman
is crazy."
T told my friend that smokers have the
option of filtered cigarettes, whereas girl
friends come only in the raw, unfiltered,
all-the-particulates variety. My friend, a
junior who understandably wished to be
identified only as "Mitch," replied "Well,
one coidd argue that filtered, toned-down
women are widely available here at Stan
ford."
If I ever do stop smoking, you won't see
me getting upset and calling customer ser
vice at Philip Morris Inc. when I see other
people smoking my brand. "Listen, I know
I quit, but does that mean you have to start
selling Marlboros to every other guy in
town?"
Maybe if relationships were more
restricted, I would have understood more
quickly. "Hey, is that your girlfriend? You
can't take her inside the restaurant,
buddy. You two finish up outside."
By the way, my relationship with
cigarettes is going great. We never fight
and we're always together. It's been three
wonderful months, and I actually like
them more now than I did when we start
ed.
