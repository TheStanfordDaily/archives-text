# Bosnian 'boy scouts'?
## Hoover fellows discuss rationale for U.S. involvement in NATO peace efforts 
### Amy Slucter Staff writer 
More questions than answers
were posed last night as Hoover
Fellows Williamson Evers, Abra
ham Sofaer and Richard Starr
discussed the merits of U.S. in
volvement in the Bosnian conflict
at a forum sponsored by the Stan
ford College Republicans.
The variety of opinions held,
even among the three professed
Republicans, exposed the com
plexity of the war that has domi
nated the news for the last four
years.
The panelists were quick to
unpack the issues: Is the United
States responsible for keeping the
peace in Europe? Why is the Unit
ed States in Bosnia?
According to Sofaer, it is not in
the United States' national inter
ests to intervene in Bosnia. In
stead, he asserted, America's only
interest is to prevent genocide.
During his introductory
speech Sofaer lamented the atroc
ities suffered by the Bosnian
Muslims.
"We have done everything we
possibly could to deprive the Mus
lims of the ability to protect them
selves and t heir families," he said,
lifting his hands from his pockets.
Sofaer later presented an analogy
to contest the assertion that arm
ing the Bosnian Muslims would
simply bring about more murder.
"Because more people would
die if you armed the J<>ws in the
Warsaw ghetto [during World
War 111 does not mean that we
should not arm them," he said.
"This is wrong. We should not
condemn one people to die."
The NATO implementation
force, called IFOR, will have the
obligation to prevent such geno
cide. The peace enforcement
troops will no longer just be keep

ing the peace, but will have the
authority to enforce peace.
These troops, according to
Staar, will be composed of a rotat
ing force of 100,000 people. For
every peace enforcer on the
ground, two will be in training.
The costs for this, Staar said, will
be about $2.5 billion.
Yet Staar said he is skeptical
about the success of this mission.
It took the United States 1(5
months to withdraw from Soma
lia after beginning "Operation
Restore and Continue Hope," he
noted. Based on these calcula
tions, Staar projects that the

United States might stay in
Bosnia for eight years instead of
the one year that is planned.
If Bosnia is a disaster, us Staar
claimed it will be, then Sofaer said
he believes that the Republicans
will be the ones to blame.
"These goody, goody politics
and boy-scout enforcement will
be the fault of the Republican
Party," he claimed.
Unlike the other two panelists,
Evers chose to sit down during his
presentation, trusting his voice
would be heard by the 60 people
who were assembled in the Oak
East Lounge in Tresidder. Evers,

who managed to draw hisses of in
credulity from the crowd, spoke
bluntly and proactively.
"Our security from invasion or
attack is not at stake in Bosnia,"
he announced. "So let's get out
right now."
The United States, Evers ex
plained, has been pursuing a bad
foreign policy. In a pithy histori
cal lesson, Evers pointed out that
current policies were contrary to
the vision of America that was
held by Presidents Washington
and Jefferson. Both of them, he

said, did not support U.S. (
involvement in the affairs of (
European nations. c
"The Clinton administration t

is arrogant, and they think they
can control the whole world,"
Evers said. "People think that
we should patrol the world as a
benign British empire in order to
enforce stability. But if we do
this, we will have violated the
constitutional rights of other
peoples."

Julie Johnson, president of
the College Republicans, said the
presentation exemplified the
diversity within the Republican
Party.
"We chose to do (a forum] on
Bosnia because there are a lot of
people in the area who have a lot
to contribute," she said.
