# Time to nominate

DOWN HERE ON the Farm,
it's common knowledge that
Stanford students excel in a
number of fields — on the playing
field, for example, or in research or
music.
It's also well-known that profes
sors are busy with teaching,
research and administrative duties.
At some point in their busy days,
though, it would be nice if they
could help others recognize those
students who have demonstrated
exceptional talents both in and out
of the classroom.
There are a number of national
and University awards and grants
given every year, many of which are
not prominent enough for students
to have heard about them. But fac
ulty members, in a better position
to be aware of these prizes, often
don't take the time to nominate or
inform their students.
Some of these awards offer stu
dents invaluable experiences. The
best-known prizes may be the
Rhodes and Marshall Scholarships,

which were awarded last month,
but smaller, less prominent awards
— the National Endowment for
Humanities Scholarships, for
example — exist as well.
Some professors do encourage
their students to go for the honor of
winning an award, but others
couldn't seem to care less. Students
deserve support, recognition and
the possibility of receiving excellent
learning opportunities through the
use of their scholarships.
But they can't do it alone. Begin
ning in the upcoming weeks,
numerous awards will be opened
for nominations and applications.
Faculty members should encourage
or nominate students who they
think are worthy — which hopeful
ly isn't that hard at Stanford.
And if student gratitude isn't
enough, think of it as an invest
ment in Stanford. After all, it can't
hurt a university to have as many
students as possible recognized
locally or nationally for their abili
ties.
