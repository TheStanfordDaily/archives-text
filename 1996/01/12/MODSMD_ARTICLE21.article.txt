ASSU shuttle service was unjustly criticized

1 DISAGREE WITH Jim Maricondo's
letter to The Daily yesterday, which
criticizes the ASSU for being "unpro
fessional" in the management of its air
port shuttle because it does not offer the
perks available from retail shuttles that
charge $17 to get you to the airport.
The shuttle is a program of the
ASSU's newest business project —
Group Discounts. It's mission is to save
cash-strapped members of the ASSU
(and that's every student) money by
negotiating bulk rates on the services
students use most. Last quarter alone,
over 1,000 students benefited from the
$10 shuttle to both local airports during
Thanksgiving break and winter break.
There were a few things we did to
keep prices down.
Among them were centralizing pick
up sites at Wilbur Hall and Lagunita
Hall and limiting the amount of excess
baggage on vans, if students could do so.
This is in no way "unprofessional." It's
less expensive and it's what allows us to
offer a shuttle for $10 instead of $17.
With two centralized sites, the drivers
didn't spend an extra 40 minutes driving
around campus to pick up people, so we
could offer more pick-up times in a day.

Also, we could provide an airport
shuttle staffer to check you in at the
site, talk to the shuttle on a radio to let
you know when it would lie arriving and
take care of any problems that might
arise.
If you weren't checked in by 10 min
utes prior to your scheduled shuttle, the
staffer called you to remind you of your
time and location and would even
reschedule you for another shuttle if you
weren't ready yet.
In the few cases that people missed
their scheduled shuttle, project man
agers from other ASSU business projects
personally drove them to the airport.
You never get this kind of service
from the retail shuttles — you would
have to stand on the corner wondering if
your shuttle were even coming and
endure the stress of the unknown while
you watched the clock.
It's true that there was a $2 charge
for bringing over two bags and a carry
on along. We have a responsibility to
make sure there's room in the shuttle
for everyone who bought a ticket and
their luggage.
When people bring a huge amount of
luggage, it slows the loading time down

and really cramps the room in the van,
making the ride uncomfortable for
everyone involved. The extra charge is
clearly indicated on the ticket and the
vast majority of customers who couldn't
fit three weeks' worth of clothing into
two bags and encountered the charge
were fully expecting it. No promises
were broken.
We realize that this is not the way
that more expensive shuttles work, so
we did everything in our power to
inform customers about the differences
of our shuttle service before they used it.
When you bought the ticket at the
ASSU, you received a man of the pick-up
sites and a notice of the charge for more
than two bags.
Most of our customers agreed that
$10 instead of $17 for a shuttle ride is a
significant savings. Most students who
took the shuttle really appreciated the
savings and didn't mind the walk so
much.
We understand that some students
can afford the $17 that they pay to
Super Shuttle for the benefit of avoid
ing the walk to Wilbur or Lagunita and
the ability to carry home five bags over
winter break. The ASSU encourages

these students to use the retail shut
tles.
Finally, apparently Jim Maricondo
used a student-run shuttle la c t year that
ran over an hour late and didn't treat
him very well. He is horribly mistaken
when he identifies this as an ASSU
shuttle. The ASSU has not operated a
shuttle service since 1991.
I find it terribly "unprofessional" that
Maricondo didn't figure out whose car
he rode in to go to the airport last year
before attributing poor service to the
ASSU on the of The Daily. The
Group Discount staff worked long and
hard hours — often in the rain — during
finals week to make sure customers got
to the airport as promised and deserve to
be commended for the service they pro
vided to the campus, rather than be
wrongly chastised through a poorly
argued and completely misinformed pub
lic letter.
The ASSU Business Office and Group
Discounts welcome suggestions and
comments that will help improve the
service we can offer to members of the
Association.
