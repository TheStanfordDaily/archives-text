# Stanford students sure are spoiled
## 
### 
This fall quarter, I had the pleasure
of being the head teaching assistant for
Statistics 190 / Economics 80. It has
been a memorable experience in many
ways — bad ways, for the most part.
Even before TAing this class, I recog
nized that Stanford students don't
always deserve the outstanding reputa
tion they enjoy throughout the country
and world. Over the last two months,
however, I have had some very special
encounters. To list only a few exam-

ples, there were:
1. The student who wanted to meet
in the Coffee House because she had
never been to any office hours before.
She also doubted that she could find
Sequoia Hall (the Department of
Statistics) on her own.
2. The student who was not able to
buy a textbook in 10 weeks time. He
therefore needed to borrow a book
from the TAs to study for the midterm
and the final.
3. The student who sent e-mail
because she "was not happy" about how
she did on the midterm. She therefore
asked whether we might disregard her
midterm score and only count the final.

4. The student who made an extra
effort to leave a long phone message,
urging us to "reconsider" the decision
to have an open-book final. His reason
was that then "everybody would do
well," depriving him of the chance to
make a special impact. I was very sorr>
that I could not get back to him, as he
"forgot" to leave his name.
5. The two students who showed up
half an hour late for the midterm
because they had been attending the
Jesse Jackson speech, which had been
"so exciting." They seriously expected
to get an extra half hour of time and
were very offended when they had to
turn in the exam at the same time as

everybody else.
Why is it that some Stanford stu
dents seem to think that they are enti
tled to special privileges? I believe
something should be done to address
this attitude. The teaching at a univer
sity like Stanford should not be limited
to course work (unless "Real Life 101"
will be added to the curriculum).
I have often seen, read or heard
complaints that after graduating, stu
dents can't find jobs even though they
have a degree from Stanford. The more
I see of the undergraduate world, the
less I wonder why.
