## 
### Alex Scherbakovsky 
Senior Matthew Rabinowitz
became the world's lOth-ranked
debater during Stanford's com
petition at the 15th annual
World's Debating Association
tournament.
Rabinowitz, as part of Stan
ford's team, competed against
more than 600 other debaters
from countries around the
world at the tournament, held
from Dec. 27 to Jan. 5 at Coun
ty Cork University College in
Ireland.
Rabinowitz's success was
lauded by other members of the
Stanford debate team. "I am
really glad he earned such a
high ranking," said senior
Matthew Meskell, another
team member. "Matt is an
excellent debater."
Rabinowitz began debating
when he was growing up in
South Africa. As chair of the
Vitts University Debating Soci
ety in Johannesburg, Rabi
nowitz. organized debates that

dealt with the political and eco
nomic situation in South Africa
at the time. "The debates got so
heated at times that they were
disrupted by people throwing
stones," he recalled.
At Stanford, Rabinowitz par
ticipates in team competitive
debate and has captured
numerous titles throughout his
career.
Joining Rabinowitz at the
world tournament were Meskell,
senior Patrick Shields and
junior Brendan Maher. Maher
and Meskell currently form the
top-ranked debate team in the
United States.
Although neither of the two
Stanford teams advanced into
the semi-final round, Rabi
nowitz expressed satisfaction
with the team's performance,
which he attributed to their
preparation for competition in
the different style of parliamen
tary debate practiced outside of
the United States.
Whereas American debaters
are used to two-on-two debat

ing rounds, the Oxford style of
parliamentary debate — which
was used at the world tourna
ment — involves four teams of
two. Each team must not only
support its own case and dis
prove its opponents, but must
also to do so better than the
other team arguing the same
position.
Each speaker in each team is
allotted seven minutes to affirm
his case and rebut the argu
ments raised by the opposition.
Three judges score each round
and victory goes to the debater
who best displays "eloquence,
clear organization, ability to
think quickly and insightfully,
a sense of humor and general
knowledge of the topic," said
Rabinowitz.
Although the program does
receive assistance from the
Willard Fund, members hold
summer debate camps for high
school students and host high
school debate tournaments to
raise funds for trips like that to
the world tournament.
