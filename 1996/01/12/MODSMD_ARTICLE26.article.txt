# COP members to teach class
## 
### Marni Leff Contributing writer 
Hoping to "demystify" the
ASS I' and introduce students to
I niversity politics, Council of
Presidents members Rich Stolz
and Nicole Vazquez, both
seniors, are teaching a class this
quarter titled "Stuoent Gover
nance and the Multicultural Uni
versity."
School of Education Dean
Emeritus Jim Lyons, who will
advise Stolz and Vazquez on
teaching the course, said he sees
two objectives to the course.
"First, lit will] teach students
about t he dynamics of institution
al government and help them
understand their role as institu
tional citizens. Students will be
expected to take significant
responsibility fort heir own learn
ing," hi' said.
"Secondly, the course will be a
forum for students to express their
ideas freely and have them criti
cized in a friendly way," he contin
ued. "It's as complicated and simple

as that. My role
is to help, not to
lecture or direct
the course. It's a
student-generat
ed, student-dir
ected course."
As part of the
course, Vazquez
said, students
will find one

issue in the University that con
cerns them and be asked to learn
as much as possible about that
issue.
"They will be asked to come up
with a plan to reform the issue, to
think creatively about it," she said.
"Hopefully that will give students
the confidence to then pursue
these issues and act on them later.
We'll also take action ourselves
and use the research that's other
wise not so readily available to cre
ate files that current and future
student leaders can look through
to learn about problems."
In addition, Vazquez said, she
and Stolz hope to make students
more aware of student group

activities and encourage students
to attend events put on by those
groups. Vazquez added that she
and Stolz will invite University
President Gerhard Casper and
possibly other administrators to
speak to the class.
"I think the course will be a
good way for freshmen without
an institutional memory to bridge
the time gap," Vazquez said. "But
it's really a good way for any stu
dent to demystify the ASSU.
Right now, unless a student is
really involved with the ASSU,
the ASSU is hard to understand
and it's been that way for a long
time. The course is a way for stu
dents to become initiated with
issues without a long-term com
mitment."
Vazquez is unsure of the num
ber of students who will apply for
the class, as information about it
was released only this week. Appli
cations, available in the ASSU
office, are due today by 5 p.m. The
course is being offered for two
units, and a list of 10 students
selected will be posted Monday.
