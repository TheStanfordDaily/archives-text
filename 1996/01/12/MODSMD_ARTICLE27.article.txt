# Encina Hall: The original men's dorm, it's led a busy life
## Once home to Hoover and Steinbeck and now site of the Office of Development, the building is ready for a new phase 
### Stephen L. Shih 
Sometimes a building has a life of its own and a
story to teU.
It may be easy, amidst the palm trees, the Califor
nia sunshine and the red-tiled roofs, to relegate a Uni
versity structure to the status of lifeless classroom or
student dwelling.
But Encina Hall, one of the oldest buildings on cam
pus, defies such labeling. And a new chapter will soon
be added to the building's rich history.
In early October, the Board of Trustees gave con
cept approval for the renovation of Encina Hall East,
which has been unused for over 20 years. After an esti
mated $11 million to $13 million in repairs and
restoration projects, the building will house the Insti
tute for International Studies.
Housing the lIS will simply be the latest in a long
line of duties for Encina Hall. Encina was built in 1891
as the original men's dormitory on campus and is
made of the same sandstone as the Main Quad, accord
ing to Mark Jones, director of Facilities Project Man
agement.
Encina developed an early life full of everything one
would expect from the men's residence at a new uni
versity: camaraderie, wild parties and late nights spent
playing poker.
In the 1904 edition of the Stanford Quad, Everett
W. Smith, Class of 1899, described Encina as a haven
from fraternal rivalries and divisions, "the common
meeting place where all gather as Stanford men with
no other thought than that they are Stanford men."
Smith called Encina "the center of Stanford life and
the source of college spirit." It was the site of "inci
dents gay and grave, roughhouses at night . . .
impromptu stag dances" and failed attempts to enter
tain "the Roble girls."
It was the home of "Ikey" Switzer and others who
fought and died in the Spanish Civil War, giving Stan
ford what Smith called "the proudest possession of any
college, her martyrs."
In this early period, Encina underwent several

alterations, such as the installation of room partitions
in 1906 and the remodeling of the attic in 1916, which
increased the number of floors to six, including the
basement.
During Encina's life as a dorm, it was home to some
of Stanford's most famous male students, including
President Herbert Hoover and author John Steinbeck
â€” who is rumored to have left his initials somewhere
in the building.
In the late 19505, Encina was converted from a res
idence to an administrative building. Some, such as
Assoc. Director of Admissions Jon Reider, joke about
the "ghosts of students walking the halls at night."
But the building did not become a den of boredom
and bureaucracy, as one might expect. According to
Reider, Encina was the site of a major demonstration
by students protesting the Vietnam War during the
early 19705. Reider was working on the third floor of
Encina that night, and said students broke glass and
gained access to sensitive files, such as salary figures of
University faculty and employees. Bloodshed was nar
rowly avoided when it was announced that the stu
dents had voted to leave the building, Reider said.
In 1972, the East Wing of Encina suffered a major
fire that damaged the roof and several of the upper
floors. According to Jones, a temporary flat roof was
installed to protect the building from the weather, but
the wing was closed because of safety considerations.
The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake caused further
damage to Encina Hall East.
Since that time, the rest of the building has contin
ued to serve various functions. Encina Hall currently
houses the Philosophy Department, the Environmen
tal Policy Forum, the Development Office and other
campus organizations. The East Wing has remained
closed due to "lack of a programmatic need and fund
ing," Jones said.
The approval granted by the board entails a com
plete refurbishment of the East Wing. Jones expects
the project to include seismic strengthening, accessi-

Encina Hall has served many functions over its more than 100 years. Once an all-male dormitory, as
shown here with residents from the year 1895, Encina housed both President Herbert Hoover and
author John Steinbeck.
