Stanford and UCLA gave new mean
ing to the words "ugly basketball" last
night as the No. 19 Bruins (10-3 overall,
3-0 Pacific 10 Conference) held on to win
64-56 in front of 12,695 in Pauley Pavil
ion.
The most amazing part of the game
was the fact that Stanford, despite being
outscored 22-6 to start the game and
finding itself down 31-17 at halftime,
pulled to within two at 41-39 around the
10 minute mark in the second half.
"We played so bad in the first half we

didn't give ourselves an opportunity later
in the game," said head coach Mike
Montgomery "Fortunately,as bad as we
played, they weren't much better."
Each team shot under 40 percent for
the game, indicative of the type of
defense each team has shown all year.
The two teams are 1-2 in the Pac-10 in
defensive field-goal percentage.
The Bruins jumped out to a double
digit lead early in the first half as the No.
21 Cardinal (8-3, 2-1) missed nine of its
first 11 shots Intimidated by the UCLA
shot blockers, Stanford failed to play
with any aggression in the first half.
"We were not the aggressor in the first
half," Montgomery said. "Typically, the
aggressor will get the calls. We didn't
react well n the first half, didn't move the
ball well. We had 'stand-around-itis.'"
Freshman Jelani McCoy, the Bruins'
long-armed swatter, capped three Stan
ford shots in the first half to set the

defensive tempo. The Cardinal came out
stronger in the second half, getting both
McCoy and sophomore J.R. Henderson
into foul trouble with 10 minutes to play.
"We tried to take it to the big guys and
get fouls," said junior point guard Brevin
Knight.
At that point, senior Andy Poppink,
who finished with a Cardinal-high 12
points and nine rebounds, hit a jumper to
pull Stanford within two. A three-pointer
by sophomore Toby Bailey at the top of
the key, followed by another Bailey
jumper, pushed the Bruin advantage
back out to seven. Bailey led all scorers
with 14.
The Cardinal cut the lead to four with
seven minutes to play and again to five
with 37 seconds remaining, but the Bru
ins made enough of its free throws (10-17
over the last 6:52) to hold on.
