Stanford and UCLA gave new mean
ing to the words "ugly basketball" last
night as the No. 19 Bruins (10-3 overall,
3-0 Pacific 10 Conference) held on to win
64-56 in front of 12,695 in Pauley Pavil
ion.
The most amazing part of the game
was the fact that Stanford, despite being
outscored 22-6 to start the game and
finding itself down 31-17 at halftime,
pulled to within two at 41-39 around the
10 minute mark in the second half.
"We played so bad in the first half we

didn't give ourselves an opportunity later
in the game," said head coach Mike
Montgomery "Fortunately,as bad as we
played, they weren't much better."
Each team shot under 40 percent for
the game, indicative of the type of
defense each team has shown all year.
The two teams are 1-2 in the Pac-10 in
defensive field-goal percentage.
The Bruins jumped out to a double
digit lead early in the first half as the No.
21 Cardinal (8-3, 2-1) missed nine of its
first 11 shots Intimidated by the UCLA
shot blockers, Stanford failed to play
with any aggression in the first half.
"We were not the aggressor in the first
half," Montgomery said. "Typically, the
aggressor will get the calls. We didn't
react well n the first half, didn't move the
ball well. We had 'stand-around-itis.'"
Freshman Jelani McCoy, the Bruins'
long-armed swatter, capped three Stan
ford shots in the first half to set the

defensive tempo. The Cardinal came out
stronger in the second half, getting both
McCoy and sophomore J.R. Henderson
into foul trouble with 10 minutes to play.
"We tried to take it to the big guys and
get fouls," said junior point guard Brevin
Knight.
At that point, senior Andy Poppink,
who finished with a Cardinal-high 12
points and nine rebounds, hit a jumper to
pull Stanford within two. A three-pointer
by sophomore Toby Bailey at the top of
the key, followed by another Bailey
jumper, pushed the Bruin advantage
back out to seven. Bailey led all scorers
with 14.
The Cardinal cut the lead to four with
seven minutes to play and again to five
with 37 seconds remaining, but the Bru
ins made enough of its free throws (10-17
over the last 6:52) to hold on.

Junior point guard Brevin Knight drives the lane in last Saturday s victory over Ari
zona. Knight led the Cardinal into battle last night against UCLA.
"That's a typical Stanford game
for us," said UCLA head coach Jim
Harrick. "They came out like a cat
in a corner in the second half, claw
ing and scratching. The first half
was the best defense we played all
year."
Coming out of halftime, Stan
ford held the Bruins to 4-of-12
shooting as the lead was narrowed
to two. In that stretch, Knight got
tangled up with McCoy going for a
loose ball, resulting in a personal
foul on Knight and a technical foul
on senior Darren Alloway for
protesting the call.
"When you have everybody
woofing, it's hard to single out one
player for the 'T,'" Knight said,
upset with the call. "We got togeth
er and decided that they weren't
going to get momentum off of it,
;ind that we were."
After the technical, however,
Stanford couldn't find a way to
crack UCLA's aggressive, overplay
ing defense. With a myriad of 6-
foot-5 players (lying in the Cardinal
shooters' faces, open looks were
hard to come by.
Montgomery said that UCLA
had scouted Stanford's offense very
well, and senior Dion Cross also
acknowledged that, when he came
off his screens, a Bruin defender
would always be waiting for him.
Cross was 0-for-7 from behind the
three-point line, 4-for-14 from the
field overall. Whether it was Kris
Johnson or Charles O' Bannon or
Bailey, UCLA switched without
hesitation because they have the

athletic personnel to do so.
"Their defense gets you a half
step off stride," Montgomery said.
"The switching defense hurt us
because they were willing to switch
all five players."
That UCLA athleticism showed
up on the Bruins' offensive end as
well. All but one of UCI A's baskets
came from 10 feet or closer to the
basket. The bruins outrebounded
Stanford 51-30, and the starting
five of Bailey, McCoy, Henderson,
Johnson, and O' Bannon grabbed
47 boards.
"We wanted to take away their
second shots and had no luck doing
that," Montgomery said.
The game was remarkably simi
lar to last year's contest at Pauley,
in which Stanford faced a 17-point
halftime deficit yet came back to
take a lead with a minute to play
before losing 77-74. Once again, a
slow start doomed the team.
"We just couldn't get over the
hump," Knight said. "We know
next time to come out like we did in
the second half for the whole game.
We've been embarrassed once this
year [an 87-63 loss to North Caroli
na], and we vowed that that will
never happen again."
For the game, Stanford shot
34.4 percent, was outrebounded by
21 and converted only four of 17
three-point attempts. In the first
half, the Cardinal shot 7-of-23 from
the floor.
"There's no way you are going to
win in this conference with num
bers like those," Montgomery said.
"If Brevin had lit it up on them, it
would have changed the whole
game. They were playing soft on
him, but he just wasn't shooting
well."
