# Trojans on deck for Cardinal hoops
## Stanford seeks victory at USC after disappointing performance at UCLA 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES â€” Trying to regroup
after last night's grueling loss to UCLA,
Stanford takes two days off before tack
ling the USC Trojans Sunday at 12:30
p.m. in the L.A. Sports Arena.
The Cardinal (8-3 overall, 2-1 Pacific
10 Conference) will need more than one
good half of basketball to beat the upstart
Trojans (8-6, 1-2). A win over Washing
ton State in Pullman and close losses to
California and Washington proved that
USC can play with anybody in the Pac
-10.
With last night's loss to the Bruins,
Sunday's game becomes that much more
important in the conference race.
"We came down (to Los Angeles 1 to
win both games," said junior point guard
Brevin Knight. "We know we have to win

at least one now."
l'he Trojans have already exceeded the
number of wins they had all last season.
New head coach Charlie Parker has
installed not only a team attitude, hut
also new uniforms, locker rooms and a
conditioning program.
Symbolic of the "new" Trojan style,
US(' has reversed last year's trend of los
ing close games. The Trojans are 4-1 in
games decided by four points or less this
year, while (hey dropped all eight close
games during last year's dreadful 7-21
season.
Parker also brought hack center Avon
dre Jones, one of the Trojans' top
recruits two years ago. Jones spent his
freshman year at USC but then trans
ferred to Chaffey College in Rancho
Cucamonga, Calif, for his sophomore
campaign. Last year, he averaged 15
points, eight rebounds and live blocked

shots.
This year, Jones averages 11.8 points
(third on the team), 6.5 rebounds (sec
ond) and .'i.9 blocks. With five blocks last
night against Cal, he already holds the
Trojan single-season record with 51.
"Avondre, like [UCLA's Jelanil
McCoy, is a long arm and a shot blocker,"
said head coach Mike Montgomery. "He's
a guy that can jump above our people. We
can't let him get deep and catch the ball
because we are not going to be able to
alter any shots he is going to take at that
point."
Stanford's Darren Allaway, forced
into playing center with the loss of sopho
more Tim Young, has performed well
over the last few games defensively
despite his lack of size at 6-foot-8.
