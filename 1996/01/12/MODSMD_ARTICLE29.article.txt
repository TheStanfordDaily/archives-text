# Trojans on deck for Cardinal hoops
## Stanford seeks victory at USC after disappointing performance at UCLA 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Trying to regroup
after last night's grueling loss to UCLA,
Stanford takes two days off before tack
ling the USC Trojans Sunday at 12:30
p.m. in the L.A. Sports Arena.
The Cardinal (8-3 overall, 2-1 Pacific
10 Conference) will need more than one
good half of basketball to beat the upstart
Trojans (8-6, 1-2). A win over Washing
ton State in Pullman and close losses to
California and Washington proved that
USC can play with anybody in the Pac
-10.
With last night's loss to the Bruins,
Sunday's game becomes that much more
important in the conference race.
"We came down (to Los Angeles 1 to
win both games," said junior point guard
Brevin Knight. "We know we have to win

at least one now."
l'he Trojans have already exceeded the
number of wins they had all last season.
New head coach Charlie Parker has
installed not only a team attitude, hut
also new uniforms, locker rooms and a
conditioning program.
Symbolic of the "new" Trojan style,
US(' has reversed last year's trend of los
ing close games. The Trojans are 4-1 in
games decided by four points or less this
year, while (hey dropped all eight close
games during last year's dreadful 7-21
season.
Parker also brought hack center Avon
dre Jones, one of the Trojans' top
recruits two years ago. Jones spent his
freshman year at USC but then trans
ferred to Chaffey College in Rancho
Cucamonga, Calif, for his sophomore
campaign. Last year, he averaged 15
points, eight rebounds and live blocked

shots.
This year, Jones averages 11.8 points
(third on the team), 6.5 rebounds (sec
ond) and .'i.9 blocks. With five blocks last
night against Cal, he already holds the
Trojan single-season record with 51.
"Avondre, like [UCLA's Jelanil
McCoy, is a long arm and a shot blocker,"
said head coach Mike Montgomery. "He's
a guy that can jump above our people. We
can't let him get deep and catch the ball
because we are not going to be able to
alter any shots he is going to take at that
point."
Stanford's Darren Allaway, forced
into playing center with the loss of sopho
more Tim Young, has performed well
over the last few games defensively
despite his lack of size at 6-foot-8.
USC junior Jaha Wilson, last year's
top rebounder in the Pac-10,
teams with Jones down low. Wil
son, whose first name means
"King of Warriors" in Swahili,
lives up to that label with a bruis
ing presence under the boards.
Although only 6-5, he has 19

career double-doubles and cur
rently averages 11.3 points and
6.9 rebounds per game. Last year
against Stanford, he averaged
15.5 points and 11 rebounds in
two games.
Luckily for Montgomery and
the Cardinal, USC uses a three
guard lineup similar to Stan
ford's. Sophomore Cameron
Murray, junior Stais Boseman
and senior Brandon Martin can

all score and distribute the ball.
The pesky threesome averages
40.4 points and 10.9 assists per
game compared to Stanford's
backcourt of Knight, Dion Cross
and David Harbour, which tallies
a combined average of 38.3 points
and 11.7 assists per contest.
Martin, Murray and Boseman
are also all capable defenders who
have the luxury of Jones' shot
blocking inside to allow them to

overplay and gamble for steals.
"Those guards, they can get
after you defensively," Mont
gomery said.
Last Saturday against Wash
ington State, the Trojans
snapped a 15-game conference
losing streak when Martin buried
a three-pointer with less than a
second to go to win 83-81.
As for Stanford, the Cardinal
got some good news on the injury

front. Young, out with a bulging
disk in his back, underwent
another MKI test and an EMG,
which studies the health of the
nerve. Young met with Dr. Gor
don Campbell, Dr. Michael
Fredrickson, Montgomery and
team trainer Tim Eakins late
Wednesday to gain some insight
on any change.
The bulging disk has been
causing inflammation in Young's

back, aggravating a nerve and
causing him to lose strength in
his legs.
According to Eakins, Young's
back is still sore but his legs are
better. Rest appears to be the
chosen course of action, as
surgery has been ruled out of the
immediate future. However,
there is still no timetable as to
when Young may return to
action.
