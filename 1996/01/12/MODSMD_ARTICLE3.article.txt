Measures to close the Food Research In
stitute and merge two departments in t he
School of Engineering passed their penul
timate tests yesterday, winning the ap
proval of University President Gerhard
Casper.
The merger of Operations Research with
Engineering-Economic Systems and the
closing of the 75-year-old institute, ap
proved by school deans and the Advisory
n J _J»aL _ A s .• _ n • l 1 i ...

Board of the Academic Council last month, now only require ap
proval from the Board of Trustees.
"These two recommended changes are consistent with my
long-held belief that universities must regularly review all their
activities, including academic ones," (Jasper told the Faculty
Senate yesterday.
While the merger of the engineering programs received facul
ty support from the two departments, FRl's closure was bitterly
protested by food research faculty and students. Casper said,
however, that despite the protests, the closure is in the best in
terests of the University's future.
"Re-examination of this sort, of course, sometimes leads to
difficult choices, choices that understandably make some un
happy," he said. "Nevertheless, Stanford must respond to
changing conditions and future challenges for the good of the
University as a whole."
Casper announced that he will recommend the creation of a
new Center in Development Economics to be housed at the In
stitute for International Studies.
Food Research Prof. Walter Falcon, director of lIS and for
mer director of FRI, was traveling and unavailable for comment.

Moving faculty and students to other universities and de
partments, Casper said, will be conducted in a "satisfactory"
manner. Most of the remaining doctoral students will transfer
to the Departments of Economics, Engineering-Economic
Systems, the Graduate School of Business or to UC-Berke
ley's Department of Agricultural Economics.
