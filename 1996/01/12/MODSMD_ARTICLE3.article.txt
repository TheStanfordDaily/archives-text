Measures to close the Food Research In

School of Engineering passed their penul

Board of the Academic Council last month, now only require ap
proval from the Board of Trustees.
"These two recommended changes are consistent with my
long-held belief that universities must regularly review all their
activities, including academic ones," (Jasper told the Faculty
Senate yesterday.
While the merger of the engineering programs received facul
ty support from the two departments, FRl's closure was bitterly
protested by food research faculty and students. Casper said,
however, that despite the protests, the closure is in the best in
terests of the University's future.
"Re-examination of this sort, of course, sometimes leads to
difficult choices, choices that understandably make some un
happy," he said. "Nevertheless, Stanford must respond to
changing conditions and future challenges for the good of the
University as a whole."
Casper announced that he will recommend the creation of a
new Center in Development Economics to be housed at the In
stitute for International Studies.
Food Research Prof. Walter Falcon, director of lIS and for
mer director of FRI, was traveling and unavailable for comment.

Moving faculty and students to other universities and de
partments, Casper said, will be conducted in a "satisfactory"
manner. Most of the remaining doctoral students will transfer
to the Departments of Economics, Engineering-Economic
Systems, the Graduate School of Business or to UC-Berke
ley's Department of Agricultural Economics.

Another option for the doctor
al students, Graduate Special
Programs, is under review by the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences and could face its own clos
ing. The program allows students
to perform interdisciplinary
research in fields which cannot be
reasonably completed in an
already-created department or
interdisciplinary program.
The rationale for Casper's
decisions fits with a new report by
a faculty planning committee
which recommended small
departments be merged and that
departments with many retiring
professors be reviewed.
"Deans should be watching for
those situations lin which there
are a wave of retirements] as the

first signs that a
visiting commit
tee should come,"
said Materials
Science and
Applied Physics
Prof. Arthur
Bienenstock,
chair of the Plan
ning and Policy
Board which pre-

sented its report to the senate
yesterday.
At the senate meeting, Casper
also discussed federal budget
action in Washington and its like
ly effects on Stanford's research
funds. Research budgets of the
Department of Energy and the
National Institutes of Health
should increase, he said, while
funding from the Department of
Defense and NASA will decrease.
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, a federally-funded pro
ject, will see a limited increase in

its construction budget.
Casper said he is most con
cerned with the heart of the bud
get standoff — possible cuts to
Medicare and Medicaid. Because
the Medical School's operating
budget is contingent on this fed
eral money, proposed cuts could
cause serious problems.
"Your guess is as good as
mine," Casper said. "But I expect
it to be very discouraging."
Casper also commented on a
recent letter to The Daily from a
freshman who broke his leg and
was denied permission to drop his
dance class after the drop dead
line had passed. Both Casper and
Printup stressed that the W grade
he received is not a penalty but is
intended to demonstrate a more
historical record.
"I would be very apprehensive
if the W was viewed as a negative"
grade, Casper said. "It is not
meant to be punitive."
