# Men's volleyball set to open season against Banana Slugs
## 
### Keith Rabkin 
Tonight at Burnham Pavil
ion, Stanford men's volleyball
hopes to start off the season by
pounding UC-Santa Cruz and
deflecting anything that the
Banana Slugs spike at them.
The 7 p.m. contest promises
excitement, as the fourth
ranked Cardinal will experi
ment with a new lineup. Cardi
nal head coach Ruben Nievis
will try an unorthodox forma
tion by sending three middle
blockers to the court instead of
the normal two. "Since we
have three of the league's best
blockers, we should use them,"
Nievis said. The modification
will give Stanford a strong
defensive presence.
The Cardinal, which beat
UCSC in their last meeting
three games to none, is opti
mistic about its first game.
Stanford returns a talented
core of veterans to lead a pow
erful group of freshmen.
"We're going to go out
against them and play our
game," said junior co-captain
Stewart Chong. Stanford hopes
not only to win, but also to
muster a unified team effort
and play as best as it can. Stan

ford feels that its height and expe
rience gives it the strength to win.
The Banana Slugs feature
senior Marty Leshin and rookie
coach Mark Mattern. In their sec
ond match of the season, Leshin
and the Banana Slugs will try to
upset the dominant Stanford
offense.
The Cardinal showcases
Chong, a formidable setter and
defensive specialist. Also at setter
will be sophomore Tyler Neal,
who looks to rebound from knee
tendonitis this season. Freshmen
Jeremy Bart and P.K. Diffen
baugh serve as young but skilled
play makers who can fill in for the
veterans.
With an average height of 6-
foot-7, Stanford's three middle
blockers can deflect almost any
thing coming their way. Junior
Brian Moore returns this year
after winning a gold medal this
summer at the Olympic Sports
Festival. Junior Mike Hoeffer is
another experienced blocker who
has played on the U.S. National B
Team and in the World Universi
ty Games. Finally, sophomore
Keenan Whitehurst returns as a
starter hoping to replicate last
season's league-leading hitting
percentage.
After recovering from arthro

scopic surgery on his shoulder,
junior Matt Fuerbringer hopes to
the outside hitters to a suc
cessful season. "Fuerbringer is a
potentially dominant force,"
Nievis said.
Junior Aaron Garcia proved
pivotal in Stanford's wins last
year and figures to be a key play
er again this year. Sophomores
Jeff Bender and Tad Hoffman will
lead a young nucleus of returning
hitters, which includes sopho
mores Chris Griffith and Devin
Poolman. Freshmen Patrick
Klein and Joshua Palacios will
join these powerful hitters to add
to the Cardinal's explosive attack.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
two-time All-American Mike
Lambert will not perform on the
court this year. Lambert has
decided to redshirt the season in
an attempt to make the U.S.
Olympic Team. The Cardinal will
miss Lambert, but remains opti
mistic.
"This is a positive change,"
Nievis said. "It gives everyone a
chance to contribute. We will be
even stronger next year when
Lambert returns."
A win against UCSC could be
the first step in a Stanford run at
the National Championships,
which will take place May 3-4 at
UCLA. First, however, Stanford
must weather a rigorous schedule
with matches versus USC, Pep
perdine and Hawaii to reach post
season playoffs.
