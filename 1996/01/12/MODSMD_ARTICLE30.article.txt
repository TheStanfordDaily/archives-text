# Men's volleyball set to open season against Banana Slugs
## 
### Keith Rabkin 
Tonight at Burnham Pavil
ion, Stanford men's volleyball
hopes to start off the season by
pounding UC-Santa Cruz and
deflecting anything that the
Banana Slugs spike at them.
The 7 p.m. contest promises
excitement, as the fourth
ranked Cardinal will experi
ment with a new lineup. Cardi
nal head coach Ruben Nievis
will try an unorthodox forma
tion by sending three middle
blockers to the court instead of
the normal two. "Since we
have three of the league's best
blockers, we should use them,"
Nievis said. The modification
will give Stanford a strong
defensive presence.
The Cardinal, which beat
UCSC in their last meeting
three games to none, is opti
mistic about its first game.
Stanford returns a talented
core of veterans to lead a pow
erful group of freshmen.
"We're going to go out
against them and play our
game," said junior co-captain
Stewart Chong. Stanford hopes
not only to win, but also to
muster a unified team effort
and play as best as it can. Stan
