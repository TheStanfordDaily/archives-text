Finals week can certainly l>e a
stressful time for Stanford stu
dents. Just ask freshman tennis
sensation Ryan Wolters.
Playing tennis by day and taking
finals via fax machine by night,
Wolters helped lead the I nited
States Junior Tennis Team to its
first Junior Davis Cup title in 11
years. With the help of teammate
Justin Gimelstob, a freshman from
UCIA Wolters knocked ofTt lie top
seeded Argentine duo of Mariano
Zabaleta and Giullenno ('anas 7-5,
4-6, 7-6 (7-2) in the decisive doubles
match on Dec. 17 to clinch Ameri
ca's 16th title since the tourna
ment's inception in 1958.

"We can say right now that the
United States is the top country,"
Wolters said. "That feeling is just
great."
The victory by the I '.S. in the 39-
country tournament proved all the
more remarkable considering the
circumstances. The teams played
on clay courts, the American
squad's worst surface. The U.S. was
also seeded fifth, which placed
Americans in tougher matchups.
Last but not least, Wolters, Ameri
ca's N'o. 2 seed, was cramming in
nearly a dozen matches while also
cramming for exams.
Playing in his last junior event,
Wolters went out in dramatic style
against defending champion
Argentina. Cheered on by a biparti
san crowd of 100 waving tin 1 stars

and stripes, Wolters easily dis
patched fourth-ranked Mariano
Puerta 6-3, 2-6, 6-2 in the opening
singles match.
After Gimelstob dropped his sin
gles match 6-3, 6-1 to Zahaleta,
Argentina had the momentum
entering the decisive doubles
match. However, it came down to a
tie breaker. Using strong serves and
volleys, Wolters and Ciimelstob
zoomed to a 6-0 lead. After Argenti
na saved one match point, Wolters'
wide serve drew a weak return from
the Argentine players, which Gimel
stob slammed away for the victory.
Now that Wolters has completed
his strong run at the junior level, he
can return to being a Stanford fresh
man again â€” not to mention being
America's top collegiate tennis player.
