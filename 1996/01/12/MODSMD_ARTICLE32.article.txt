Stanford 81
UCI.A 77

For a period and a half last
night at Maples Pavilion, it was
hard to tell the nation's sixth
ranked team from the team
picked to finish sixth in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference.
Led by a career-high 29 points
from guard Nickey Hilbert,

UCLA (6-6 overall, 1-2 r uc-10) —
a team slotted to place in the hot-

'[Brevin] was playing
hard, playing well,
running the club.'

torn half of the conference in a
preseason media poll — gave the
No. 6 Stanford women (10-2, 3-0)
all they could handle, leading bv
as many as 13 in the second half
before the Cardinal pulled togeth

er for a dramatic 81-77 come
from-behind victory.
"This is the best that I've seen
UCLA shoot the ball," said Stan
ford head coach Amy Tucker. "It
didn't matter what we did. When
we were in a man, we couldn't
stop IHilbert). We went to our
zone and she was hot."
Hilbert wasn't the only one
with a hot hand — the Bruin
offense shot a scorching 66 per
cent from the field in cruising to a
44-35 halftime lead. And with 6-
foot-5 forward Zrinka Kristich
and 6-4 center Kisa Hughes dom

the post game (Kristich was a
perfect 7-for-7 in the first half),
it looked as though Stanford
would never get its feet off the
ground.
"Early in the game, we were
running and executing our
offense very well," said UCLA
head coach Kathy Olivier.
The same couldn't be said for
the Cardinal. Junior Kate Star
bird scored 18 first-half points
but was 0-for-5 from behind the
three-point line. Even sopho
more Vanessa Nygaard, who
ranks fourth in the nation in
three-point field goals per game,
was a dismal 0-for-5. Combine
that with seven turnovers in the
first seven minutes, 12 seconds
of the game and the Cardinal
found itself with a nine-point
halftime deficit.
"We never really had much
flow offensively," Tucker said.
"We had trouble getting the ball
in the high post, and we had a
hard time reversing it when we
did have it in the high post."
Things didn't get much bet
ter at the start of the second
half, as the Bruins extended
their lead to 48-35 with 19:01
remaining and still led by as
many as 11 with 14:29 to go.
Every time Stanford crept with
in striking distance, Hilbert
responded with another big
play.
Finally, with UCLA up 68-61
with less than nine minutes to
go, the Cardinal embarked on
an electrifying 14-2 run that

put it in the driver's seat.
Nygaard scored eight of those
points, including two clutch
three-pointers — sandwiched
around a Kate Starbird layup —
that cut the Bruin lead to one at
70-69 and sent the Maples
Pavilion crowd into a frenzy.
Starbird's 14-foot jumper from
the left corner capped the run.
"(In the] second half they
picked it up a level," Olivier
said. "They started collapsing
down low and fighting over the
screens a little more. Any time
you allow your opponent 21
offensive rebounds, you're
gonna get in trouble."
Starbird, despite her three
point shooting woes (she was 1-
of-7 on the night), still finished
with a career-high 33 points to
pace the Cardinal. Nygaard
added 16 points and 10 boards
while point guard Jamila Wide
man — in her return from an
ankle injury that has kept her
sidelined the last two games —
picked up eight points and seven
assists.
Saturday, the women will try
to extend their 23-game home
winning streak when they
return to Maples for a 12:30
p.m. matchup against USC (6-6,
2-1). The Trojans began the
year with high expectations,
ranked 16th at the start of the
season, but were embarassed in
their opener by Oklahoma State
85-55 and has since dropped
Pac-10 contests to Washington
and Washington State last
weekend. USC is paced by
junior forward Tina Thompson,
who ranks second in the Pac-10
with 22.0 points per game.
