# No. 6 women survive despite injury
## Kelsey out for season, Wideman returns to pace Cardinal 
### Jermey Stone Staff writer 
Usually, top-10 teams aren't
just trying to survive. But the
injury-riddled Stanford women's
basketball squad is weathering
the Pacific 10 Conference storm.
On a night that the team
learned its senior co-captain's
Cardinal career was over, its
other general returned to the
lineup and cemented an 81-77
squeaker over a mediocre but
improved UCLA team.
Bobbie Kelsey sat at the end of
the bench in street clothes, while
junior point guard Jamila Wide
man entered the fray for the first
time in 1996 after spraining her
ankle in the closing seconds at
Texas on Dec. 30. Although Wide
man came off the bench, she did
not rest in the second half en
route to totals of eight points,
seven assists and six boards.
"I was obviously just excited
that Jamila was healthy enough
to play," said Stanford coach Amy
Tucker. "I thought she was the
difference in the game."
In the final minute, while
other Stanford players missed the
front ends of three one-and-ones,
Wideman nailed all four of her
opportunities, including the
clinchers with seven ticks left.
Wideman has now taken over the
team lead in free-throw percent
age to go along with her lead in
steals and assist average. More
importantly, Wideman continued
a season-long trend of providing
offense when the squad needs it
most.

Smith has plugged the gap when

Junior Kate Starbird led the Cardinal to victory last night with a
career-high 35 points on 14-of-25 shooting from the field.
