# No. 6 women survive despite injury
## Kelsey out for season, Wideman returns to pace Cardinal 
### Jermey Stone Staff writer 
Usually, top-10 teams aren't
just trying to survive. But the
injury-riddled Stanford women's
basketball squad is weathering
the Pacific 10 Conference storm.
On a night that the team
learned its senior co-captain's
Cardinal career was over, its
other general returned to the
lineup and cemented an 81-77
squeaker over a mediocre but
improved UCLA team.
Bobbie Kelsey sat at the end of
the bench in street clothes, while
junior point guard Jamila Wide
man entered the fray for the first
time in 1996 after spraining her
ankle in the closing seconds at
Texas on Dec. 30. Although Wide
man came off the bench, she did
not rest in the second half en
route to totals of eight points,
seven assists and six boards.
"I was obviously just excited
that Jamila was healthy enough
to play," said Stanford coach Amy
Tucker. "I thought she was the
difference in the game."
In the final minute, while
other Stanford players missed the
front ends of three one-and-ones,
Wideman nailed all four of her
opportunities, including the
clinchers with seven ticks left.
Wideman has now taken over the
team lead in free-throw percent
age to go along with her lead in
steals and assist average. More
importantly, Wideman continued
a season-long trend of providing
offense when the squad needs it
most.
Although junior Charmin
Smith has plugged the gap when

Junior Kate Starbird led the Cardinal to victory last night with a
career-high 35 points on 14-of-25 shooting from the field.
Wideman has been unable to go,
Wideman averages a team-lead
ing 35 minutes per game and
remains the straw that stirs
Stanford's drink.
"It looks they're a lot more
comfortable with Jamila in
there," said UCLA coach Kathv
Olivier. "She denied Nickey
[Hilbertl the ball a little better
than Charmin did. She's more of
a floor leader."
Although Wideman admitted

to apprehension about picking
up UCLA's freshman point
guard Erica Gomez on the drib
ble, she still notched three steals
and showed few ill effects from
her injury.
Other Stanford players
couldn't share in Wideman's
fortunes. Sophomore power for
ward Heather Owen, trying to
recover from a stress fracture in
her left foot, joined the fun for
seven minutes but couldn't go
on. Her post partner Naomi
Mulitauaopele suffered a foot
sprain as well and will undergo
x-rays today, but after a brief
jaunt to the locker room, she

returned and performed effec
tively down the stretch. The
squad's third-leading scorer
posted 15 points on 7-of-ll
shooting.
With Mulitauaopele's status
up in the air, Tucker joked
about turning to a familiar face.
"By that point, I was getting
ready to dress myself," Tucker
said.
The former Ohio State stand
out never thought about bring
ing in the four players at the end
of Stanford's bench and will not
have the chance to use Kelsey
again. Kelsey, who sports an
NCAA championship ring from

1992 and was voted the team's
most inspirational player
despite redshirting then, ended
her college career the same way
her illustrious high school
career came to a close — with
serious knee surgery early in
her senior year. This time,
exploratory surgery exposed the
right knee.
"She is probably our most
aggressive perimeter defender,
with the exception of Jamila,"
Tucker said. "She's been play
ing very well for us defensively
and she's also an excellent
three-point shooter. It hurts our
rotation."
