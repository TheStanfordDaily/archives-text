# WEEKLY WORLD DIVERSIONS
## Diversions Columnist Writes Column!! Another confrontation with my psychic sistah 
### 
"You're soooo 95."
It was only seven hours into the new year when she
returned to my bed to slap me with an anachronistic label and
her jet black feather boa (the bitch).
"Wake up and smell the soy milk latte, you has-been you!"
"Go away," I warbled under my drool-encrusted quilt.
Despite my linguistically economical attempt to ward off my
anti-Krist, the feathered one managed to divest me of decent
REM; She swiped my quilt, stripping me of my somnolent
wrappings. Anguished to the max, 1 witnessed the moist
dreamscapes of my slumber quickly dissolve into the irksome
reality of tickling ostrich feathers.
I lunged for the stash of melatonin on the night table to
eradicate my dreamless condition.
"I wouldn't touch those pellets if I were you,"' cooed the
anti-Krist. "Come March, they will be proven to cause Legion
naire's Disease in half-breed laboratory rats."
"Yeah, right."' 1 scoffed. "And Keanu Reeves is gay."
"He'll make the official announcement on the next Barbara
Walters special."
"Keanu Reeves is gay?"
"Of course! Keanu Reeves and Macaulay Culkin and the
model from that 'All men are NOT created equal' poster. I pre
dict that they will be the major closet-outings of '96."
"Keanu Reeves is gay?!?"
"And Lou Ferigno. He'll do it on 'Malcolm J.
"You mean 'X.'"
"I mean Malcolm Jamal-Warner's new talk show."
I made another lunge. This time for the carafe of NyQuil
next to the melatonin stash.
"I wouldn't do that if I were you. There will be a definitive
link proven between NvQuil and syphi—"
"I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!" I lambasted. "Last year you
told me that Jerry Garcia is the Unabomber! Last year you
told me that Charo will open for Woodstock 2! Last year you
told me that 1995 would be the end of menses!!!"
"I said Mcnsa."
"Even so, you're a FAKE! You think you know everything
and you don't! Every freaking 1st of January, I have to put up
with your so-called predictions and above-thou distinctions
between what's in and what's in my closet."
"You insolent, insolent mortal! Have you already forgotten
how 1 foretold the resurrection of the hiphugger pants, the
Hugh Grant incident and the soft porn debut of a certain
"Saved by the Bell" valedictorian? 1 even predicted the exact
hue of her new hair color, I'm so brilliant! How dare you mock
my gift to foresee the future."
She whipped me with her boa, seeing to it that the feather
ends were dipped in NyQuil (the wetter the feather, 'tis better
than leather).
"I'm tin* only anti-Krist you deserve," she huffed as she
primped her feathers for her grand exit.
"When you come back next year," I called out after her,
"don't wake me until 'Carnie' starts."
"But it'll be canceled."
"Precisely."
