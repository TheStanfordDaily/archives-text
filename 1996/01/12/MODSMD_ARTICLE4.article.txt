# Fac Sen debates small department mergers
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate debated the merits of merging small
er departments at a heavily attended meeting yesterday.
The debate was sparked by the presentation of a re
port from the Planning and Policy Board, which the sen
ate created 3 1/2 years ago to engage in strategic plan
ning.
The report makes several recommendations, including
the merging of small departments, regular departmental re
view by peers from other universities, stronger faculty com
mitment to undergraduate education, lobbying for less bur
densome indirect-cost regulations, creating pools of funds
for cushioning tuition remission and financing equipment
purchases, encouraging faculty
retirement, making doctoral pro
grams more versatile and insti
tuting better data collection by
the University.
The main focus of the discus
sion on the report was the recom
mendation concerning the merg
er of small departments. Sup
porters argued that combining
smaller departments will
increase flexibility in allocating
new billets and foster innovation,
as well as decrease administra
tive costs.
"There is less of an opportuni
ty to venture out into something
new in a small department than
in a big department," said Materi
als Sciences and Applied Physics
Prof. Arthur Bienenstock, co
chair of the committee.
Genetics Prof. David Botstein
cited the Biology Department at
Berkeley as an example. Previ

ously, it had been divided into 20
different departments. After the
merger of the 20 parts, the
department improved its quality
and innovativeness.
However, Statistics Prof.
Bradley Efron disagreed, saying
that there would be little admin
istrative savings while there
would be great loss if small
departments merged.
"There would not be great sav
ings [from mergers]. In my expe
rience, it is big departments that
are the budget busters," Efron
said. "If size makes more innova
tive departments, then Berkeley
should be twice as good as Stan
ford, but it is not. Many of the
best departments are the small
ones. Stanford has a good tradi
tion based on small depart
ments."
Merging small departments is
only a political ploy by big depart
ments to protect themselves from
budget cuts, Efron added. Small
departments are also the only
departments that can be closed
given campus political climate.

Small departments actually
foster more innovation than big
departments, said Philosophy
Prof. John Perry. Without prod
ding from the Philosophy Depart
ment, Perry said, the History
Department would have never
created the History and Philoso
phy of Science program.
Other discussion focused on
whether lack of faculty retire
ment and turnover was a prob
lem.
Chemistry Prof. Michael Fayer
noted that only one faculty mem
ber in the entire University was
70 or over.
"If the turnover rate of the fac
ulty is 5 percent, then in 20 years
the turnover will be 60 percent,"
Fayer said.
Citing his own experience,
Bienenstock said when he moved
to Stanford from Harvard, he
thought that Stanford's depart
ment was inferior to Harvard's.
But high faculty growth at Stan
ford combined with stagnation at
Harvard has allowed Stanford to
surpass Harvard.
