### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate debated the merits of merging small
er departments at a heavily attended meeting yesterday.
The debate was sparked by the presentation of a re
port from the Planning and Policy Board, which the sen
ate created 3 1/2 years ago to engage in strategic plan
ning.
The report makes several recommendations, including
the merging of small departments, regular departmental re
view by peers from other universities, stronger faculty com
mitment to undergraduate education, lobbying for less bur
densome indirect-cost regulations, creating pools of funds
for cushioning tuition remission and financing equipment
