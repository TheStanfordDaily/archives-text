Continuing its winning streak, Stan
ford has been ranked one of the top Cali
fornia schools in a survey of high school
guidance counselors.
In the second annual Collegiate Infor
mation Services survey of the nation's
counselors, Stanford took top honors in
overall quality of education, along with
the California Institute of Technology
and Harvey Mudd College.
According to Collegiate Information
Services President Larry Chiugouris, this
study provides feedback for colleges on
how t hey are viewed by high school guid
ance counselors, which he said are one of
the most influential groups for potential
college students.

A random sample of 502 counselors,
representing the different regions of the
nation, were asked to rank each college
from a list of more than 800 schools in 10
areas. Among these areas are leadership
opportunities, financial aid opportunities,
academic programs, athletic programs
and value for the money.
Ranking the schools on a scale of zero
to 100 in each area, the guidance coun
selors completed the self-administered
questionnaire during the 1994-95 acade
mic year.
Although Stanford scored well in most
areas, counselors said the University's
key strength is its academic programs, ac
cording to the poll.
Hesitant to trust the results of yet all
ot her noil, William Stone, president of the

Stanford Alumni Association, said, "I'm
suspect of beauty contest polls, not so
much because it's not good news so much
as it's in the eye of the beholder.
"But if you're going to be in a pageant,
you might as well come in first," he
addi'd.
Chiugouris conceded that there is no
one set of criteria that can best measure
t he "overall quality of education" at any
college or university. Rather the results of
the Collegiate Information Services study
are sent to high school guidance coun
selors to be m-ed as a tool when they advise
their students, he said.
"Our philosophy is that there is no one
best school," Chiugouris said. "But there
is a best school for the particular student
based on the student's particular needs."
