# Mem Aud booking practices changed

Maintenance concerns in
Memorial Auditorium have
prompted a change in the proce
dure used to honk the facility, said
Stanford Events Director Lois
Wagner.
Under the previous system, a
request to use the space in Mem
Aud would first go to Non-Acade
mic Facilities Scheduling (NAFS),
which would consult the Drama
Department for any potential con
flicts with its academic needs,
Wagner said.
Only with Drama Department
approval would NAFS certify the
auditorium as available. The orig
inal requester would then fill out
the necessary paperwork and sub
mit the forms to Stanford Events

— which would determine
whether the event meets Univer
sity guidelines for public events —
for a final approval.
Under the new system, howev
er, Stanford Events — in addition
to the Drama Department — will
be contacted by NAFS to npprove
the use of the facility, Wagner said.
Therefore, Stanford Events
will, in effect, approve requests
twice — once when the request is
first made, to avoid scheduling
conflicts, and again to ensure con
formity with University guide
lines.
The new procedure recognizes
both University and Drama De
partment authority over the facil
ity, Wagner said.
"The new procedure is really
just a minor adjustment to exist
ing procedure so that both princi
pal managers . . . have a review
before the request is filed by
NAFS," said Drama Department
Chair Charles Lyons.
"We are merely following the
same procedure other facility
managers follow in the schedul
ing of events," Wagner said.
The catalyst for this adjust
ment comes as a result of the
major facilities work planned for
Mem Aud over the next few
years.
The lighting system in Mem
Aud is one of the major mainte
nance concerns that will be

addressed.
"We have been working on
determining the scope of the
lighting problem and possible
solution as well as securing fund
ing since the failure last spring.
This will continue through the
planned demolition and installa
tion this summer," Wagner said.
The current lighting board
ceased to operate last spring dur
ing the Ram's Head production of
"Once On This Island." Without
a lighting board, Mem Aud is lim
ited to having its lights turned on
or off.
Wagner said there are many
other maintenance issues to con
sider in addition to lighting.
"Mem Aud has more than the
lighting to be concerned with over
the next two to three years.
Rather than waiting for parts of

the hall to break and then attempt
to get it fixed, as in the case of the
lighting system, we are currently
working on a list of deferred main
tenance, fire and safety issues
that need to be addressed in the
near future. We anticipate secur
ing funding for these needs and
work being scheduled as possible
through 1998," Wagner said.
Flicks manager Craig Zajac
said he was pleased with the
change because now it is clear to
him who is responsible for the
Mem Aud facilities.
"Ever since University Events
and Services split into three
areas last year, the responsibility
has been unclear to me," he said.
"The fact that [Stanford Events]
is taking responsibility for the
non-technical maintenance in
Mem Aud is good."
