# Commemoration
## Montgomery bus boycott remembered 
### Joe El Rady Contributing writer 
Stewart Burns wouldn't miss
the 40th anniversary celebration of
the Montgomery bus boycott for
anything in the world.
"The idea was not just to re
member the past, but to use the
past to build a future," Burns said
about the event he attended last
month.
Burns — who is the resident fel
low for West Lagunita, a social his
torian, a former lecturer in Ameri
can History and a former editor of
the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers
Project — has spent several years
working on the third volume of the

King Papers, which will be pub
lished this fall.
The volume, titled "Birth of a
New Age," covers the boycott,
which Burns has spent the last six
years studying.
The many speakers and atten
dees of the five-day-long Alabama
event included some of the original
leaders of the civil rights move
ment. Rosa Parks, now in her 80s,
and Coretta Scott King were among
those who addressed the estimated
i ,000 attendees.
However, the ceremonies were
geared less toward commemorat
ing the boycott than toward estab
lishing a new impetus for contin
ued civil rights action, Burns said
"The purpose of the people who
organized this anniversary com
memoration was to fire up young
people and show them what ordi
nary people am do. The purpose
was to catalyze young people to take
actions themselves to fight poverty
and racism and drugs," he said.
Though Burns does not feel
that youth involvement is lacking,
he said that "it is important to con
nect the elders of the movement
with the young people. The aim is
to jump start the civil rights move
ment and empower young people."
Another major emphasis of the
anniversary celebration was to
commemorate and revitalize com
munity action.
"The important thing to under
stand about the bus boycott is that
it was a collective effort by many
community leaders. King was the
spokesman, but many others, espe
cially African-American women,
were at the forefront," said Burns,
who has researched the complex
leadership of the boycott as a
model of community effort.

But the message delivered in
Montgomery last month stressed
more than community effort, he
said. It stressed a rebirth of com
munity self-reliance.
"The message was one of self
help and community empower
ment, not aid from t he federal gov
ernment," Burns said. "The mes
sage was don't dismantle social
programs, but we also need to take
the responsibility to help our own
community," he added.
"There was a sense that if the
black community was able to har
ness its economic resources, this
would lead to greater economic jus
tice and equality," said Burns.
"These people are definitely pro
gressives, but the message sound
ed somewhat conservative. The
difference is that conservatives
speak of traditional values and
self-reliance but don't offer the
tools to enable local communities
to become self-reliant.
"Now there is a renewed call for
self-reliance, with some help from
the federal government," he added.
"The community is not asking for
new social programs, but they are
insisting on appropriate assistance
and the continuance of the current
programs, which, though inade
quate, have been essential."
Burns summarized the mood at

the commemoration as "somber but
hopeful." He explained, "I am hope
ful — I tend to be ;ui optimist — but
I am hopeful that, if we can
tlirough this immediate future which
looks bleak, we csin make achieve
ments. I am very impressed with the
young people that I have mentioned,
and I have a lot of confidence in the
new generation," he said.
"My personal highlight hap
jjened halfway through the mass
meeting at the Holt St. Baptist
church, which marked the -10th
anniversary of the first Mont
gomery Improvement Association
meeting," Burns added. "The
speaker said turn around and
introduce yourself. I turned to a
woman in her 50s named Mary
Ixjuise Smith, who was arrested
before Rosa Parks for not giving
her seat to a white man. She
became one of the four plaintiffs in
Browder v. Gayle, the case which
eventually reached the Supreme
Court and abolished bus segrega
tion.
"There she was, this person out
of history, this unsung hero. Hold
ing hands with her while we sang
'We Shall Overcome,' in the
church where it started, holding
hands wit h one of the heroes who
helped to get it started, was a
thrill."
