## Montgomery bus boycott remembered

Stewart Burns wouldn't miss
the 40th anniversary celebration of
the Montgomery bus boycott for
anything in the world.
"The idea was not just to re
member the past, but to use the
past to build a future," Burns said

Burns — who is the resident fel

the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers
Project — has spent several years
working on the third volume of the

King Papers, which will be pub

New Age," covers the boycott,
which Burns has spent the last six
years studying.

and Coretta Scott King were among
those who addressed the estimated
