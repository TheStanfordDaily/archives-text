TTH 3:15-5:05, Blclg. 200, room 107
Assistant Professor Laura Leets
The reality of interethnic and intercultural relations in the world today is obvious
both within the U.S. as well as in other countries and international relations. The
increasing contact seems to inevitably manifest itself in misunderstandings and
conflict. In order to meet these challenges and in general confront difficulties
created by interethnic contact it is helpful to understand the nature of interethnic
relations and attitudes as well as learning skills for more effectively addressing the
problems and issues associated with such relations. The specific objective of this
course is to examine the influence of ethnicity on the process of interpersonal
communication by exploring the problems and opportunities inherent in
communication among people from different ethnic groups and value orientation.
