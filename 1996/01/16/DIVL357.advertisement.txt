Jeremy Kirsch Senior. HANK: Calisthenic commando
MAJOR: Economics
Imagine waking up each day to a breakfast consisting of a brisk 3 mile run.
Then imagine following that up with a snack comprised of 6 sets of 10 pull
ups. and 6 more sets of 30 push-ups. And then washing the whole thing down
with a nice half-hour swim. That was Jeremy Kirsch's hearty diet during
preparations for the United States Test for Navy Seals and Divers Training last
year. Don't let all this military stuff give you the impression that Jeremy's some kind of
lone survivalist type: despite his success in the solitary training and competition,
Jeremy's individual achievements never overshadow his team spirit. Unless lie's in a
workout, it's difficult to find this senior in the Navy Reserve Training Corps by him
self. As Vice President of Alpha Epsilon Pi, he's helped the fraternity expand its pres
ence during its lirst few years of existence. And his common stints shooting the rock on
the campus blacktop and huddling up on the intramural football field all reflect his true
nature as a team player. But be forewarned: if you happen to confront him as a member
of the opposing team during a Navy Seal training exercise, it's every man for himself.
Lily Chen Sophomore. MOTTO: Bye-bye birdie
Call it shuttlecock diplomacy. Lily Chen bounces back and forth between
men's and women's badminton tournaments with athletic skills that know no
boundary. As co-captain of Stanford's badminton team, Lily dominated the
competition on the women's circuit so thoroughly that she now also competes
in the men's division. And her leap across the gender line hasn't exactly made
her a second class citizen: at the 1995 Stanford open, Lily captured her lirst
men's title in the C division. She has also earned eight individual first-place titles,
including an astonishing performance at the UCSD Sungod tournament, where she won
the women's singles and doubles titles and made it to the finals of the men's consola
tion round. A two-time state CIF champion during high school, Lily graduated to col
lege-level playing without a hitch: last summer she led the Cardinal to a gold medal
finish at the Olympic Festival, finishing second in doubles. Although her proficiency
hasn't yet lead her to the pros, who knows? This badminton thing could turn
out to be quite a racket.

Peek at the Peak. The first U.S. women's
skier ever to win a world cup
downhill title. Picabo
Street has found a new mission.
"Peek" decided to donate 10 per
cent of her world cup earnings to
NIKE'S P.L.A.Y. (Participate
in the Lives of America's Youth) program. Given
the positive impact playing sports can make in the
lives of girls, she wants more girls to have the
opportunity to participate in sports. As of this print
ing. Peek has already won one race this season at
Lake Louise in Alberta, Canada.

This is the lirst Stanford University SPORTSPAGE
Right about now you're probably wondering. What the heck is this thing? It's SPORTSPAGE. The all-around
informational, intramural, extracurricular, cross-campus, lean, mean, scoop-getting SPORTSPAGE. It's the first of its
kind. And it's gonna continue. The main point is to give you a convenient schedule of sports-related events on
campus and update you on athletic accomplishments by some students. But the real main point is for you to
get inspired and get involved. To participate. Also: if you have an idea, don't keep it to yourself. If you know of
a great athlete or event on campus that we should cover in SPORTSPAGE. reach out to us. Shout. Fax. Holler.
Or get in touch with your NIKE student rep. Then watch for another SPORTSPAGE next month.
In creating this SPORTSPAGE. NIKE has
made every effort to accurately present
the time and location for upcoming
athletic events on campus. We regret any
schedule changes or omissions. If your
club or intramural sport wasn't covered,
let your NIKE student rep know and
we'll try again next month.
