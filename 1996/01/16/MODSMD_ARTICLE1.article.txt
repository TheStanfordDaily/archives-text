# Students find D.C. snow a problem
## 
### David Stein Contributing write 
Just as Washington, D C., began
to escape the icy hold of a govern
ment furlough, Mother Nature's
recent snowstorms on the East
Coast put the nation's capital —
and the Stanford in Washington
program — in a deep freeze.
Over two feet of snow, unbear
able traffic conditions and the fed
eral government's shutdown pre
vented the 15 Stanford students
who came to Washington this quar
ter to study environmental issues
from starting their government in
ternships and completing their ori
entation program.
While a few people arrived at
their internships on time, the ma
jority of students were stranded at
the Stanford center, able to work
only one day last week. In addition,
the students' traditional tours of
Capitol 1 lill and the Library of Con
gress were canceled.
Most classes, which students at
tend at night after work, were held
as scheduled since they are given at
the center. However, a seminar on
natural resources was canceled last
Tuesday evening because the in
structor could not make it to work.
Commuting to and from work
was nearly impossible as the bus
lines and the Metro, Washington's
subway, were constantly jam
packed. In addition, the Metro cars
which run above grotind were
trapped in the snow, pushing the
commute from the Stanford center
to government offices to nearly an
hour and a half.
Even if the students braved the
weather, the federal government,
which provides most of the intern
ships, was closed for the greater
part of last week.
According to program director
Adrienne Jamieson, the missed
days of work will not have to be
made up, nor will they affect the
amount of credit the students re
ceive.
"The students' attendance
won't count against them because
they are graded upon the paper
they write for the internship,'
Jamieson said.
The snowstorm did seem te
have an effect on the students'
attitudes, Jamieson commented
"The students have a sort of
Cabin fever; they just want to get
out and get rolling," Jamieson
said. "It's been difficult, since this
is the beginning of the quarter."
Echoing these feelings was

Dairy Wheeles, a senior human
biology major interning at Con
servation International, an envi
ronmental policy agency.
"It was cool to see the weather
and have the time off, but I've
been really restless. I came here to
work and learn and I wanted to
start right away," Wheeles said.
Wheeles said it was "nice to get
my feet wet" when she finally got
to work last Thursday to pick up
some background reading. How
ever, come Friday, she was stuck
at the center once again.
While Jamieson said the

weather appears to be improving,
she also noted tlicit the difficul
ties are far from over. As long as
the federal budget situation
remains unclear, so do the stu
dents' futures, Jamieson
explained.
"The budget allows for gov
ernment workers to be paid, but
the agencies for which most of
the students w<rrk still have not
been funded," Jamieson said.
"After the [Martin Luther King
Jr. Day) holiday, the agencies
will be involved in a budget bat
tle."
