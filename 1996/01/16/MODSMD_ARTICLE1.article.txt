# Students find D.C. snow a problem

### David Stein Contributing write 
Just as Washington, D C., began
to escape the icy hold of a govern
ment furlough, Mother Nature's
recent snowstorms on the East
Coast put the nation's capital —
and the Stanford in Washington
program — in a deep freeze.
Over two feet of snow, unbear
able traffic conditions and the fed

vented the 15 Stanford students
who came to Washington this quar

from starting their government in
ternships and completing their ori

While a few people arrived at
their internships on time, the ma
jority of students were stranded at
the Stanford center, able to work
only one day last week. In addition,
the students' traditional tours of
Capitol 1 lill and the Library of Con

Most classes, which students at

as scheduled since they are given at
the center. However, a seminar on
natural resources was canceled last
Tuesday evening because the in
structor could not make it to work.
Commuting to and from work
was nearly impossible as the bus
lines and the Metro, Washington's
subway, were constantly jam
packed. In addition, the Metro cars
which run above grotind were
trapped in the snow, pushing the
commute from the Stanford center
to government offices to nearly an
hour and a half.
Even if the students braved the
weather, the federal government,
which provides most of the intern
ships, was closed for the greater
part of last week.
According to program director
Adrienne Jamieson, the missed
days of work will not have to be
made up, nor will they affect the
amount of credit the students re
ceive.

won't count against them because
