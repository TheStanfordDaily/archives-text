First lady denies nefarious intent
WASHINGTON (AP) — Hillary Rodham Clin
ton said yesterday that her conversations with pres
idential aides on reported financial mismanagement
at the White House travel office could have unin
tentionally prompted the mass firings there.
While continuing to maintain that she didn't
order the travel office purge, the first lady said
that aides could have misconstrued her remarks
to mean she wanted the seven employees dis
missed.
"The mere expression of concern could be, I
guess, taken to mean something more than . . .
was meant," Mrs. Clinton told the "Diane Rehm
Show" on Washington radio station WAMU-FM.
The first lady made the remarks as she launched
a tour for her new book.
Mrs. Clinton said she was told by White House
aides in the days before the firings that an

accounting firm had been engaged to examine
possible financial mismanagement in the travel
office, and"I said that sounds like a good idea."
Seinfeld to stay for eighth season
PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — NBC and the star
of its highest rated comedy, Jerry Seinfeld, con
firmed yesterday that they are passing up a
chance to quit while they're on top. "Seinfeld" is
returning for an eighth season.
Critics lamented a slip in quality last year but
the show regained its creative footing and is a
linchpin of NBC's powerful Thursday night
schedule that includes the drama "ER."
TV Guide reported last week that "Seinfeld"
was being renewed, but the network would not
comment until yesterday, when NBC Entertain
ment President Warren Littlefield announced
schedule changes for the current season.
