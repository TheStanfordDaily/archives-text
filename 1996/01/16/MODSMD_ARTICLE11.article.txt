# Powerful drug lord nabbed
## Captured in Mexico, cartel head is behind bars in Houston 
### 
MEXICO CITY (AP) - One
of Mexico's most notorious drug
lords, a fugitive on the FBl's 10
most-wanted list, was behind
bars yesterday after eluding
authorities on both sides of the
border for years.
The arrest of Juan Garcia
Abrego was an enormous victory
for the government, coming
after critics said widespread cor
ruption has prevented the gov
ernment from halting the (low
of narcotics into the United
States.
Garcia Abrego has been
linked to top Mexican officials
accused of corruption, including
Raul Salinas, the elder brother
of the former Mexican president.

"The capture of Garcia
Abrego is a triumph for the
Mexican government and for
close U.S.-Mexican collabora
tion in anti-narcotics matters,"
U.S. State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said
in Washington."It illustrates
the commitment of both govern
ments."
Details of Garcia Abrego's
arrest were sketchy, but both
U.S. Drug Enforcement and
State Department officials con
firmed the capture of the heavy
set, mustachioed drug lord.
It was not immediately
known if Garcia Abrego, who
last year was reported to be try
ing to negotiate a conditional

surrender, had turned himself
in.
Garcia Abrego, 51, is the
reputed head of the Gulf cartel,
Mexico's second most powerful
drug organization.
Last March, U.S. Attorney
General Janet Keno put him on
the FBl's 10 Most Wanted list.
The Mexican government had
offered a $1 million reward for
his arrest and the U.S. govern
ment had offered $300,000.
Garcia Abrego was arrested
Sunday in the northern city of
Monterrey, Burns said. He was
deported yesterday, arriving in
Houston around 5:30 p.m. CST.
There was no immediate word
on where he was being held.
