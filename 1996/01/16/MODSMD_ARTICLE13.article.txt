## Undebatable win

Dominance is usually not
an adjective used to describe
the achievements of West
Coast collegiate debate programs.
Mentioning the words "debate" and
"forensics" might conjure up the
grim, ivy-covered halls of Harvard
or Yale.
But this year, the little-noticed
but extremely formidable Stanford
Debate Society has posted a season
that rivals if not surpasses any of
the traditional powers back East.
This year, the society's accomplish
ments include a triumph at the
Harvard Cup, an event akin to win
ning the Rose Bowl.
John Bronsteen, president of the
Harvard Debate Society, was
extremely impressed by Stanford's
Stellar performance at this year's
Harvard tournament. "I haven't
seen that kind of dominance in any
tournament in the years that I've
been debating," he said.
Stanford's teams swept every

category at the tournament. And
by receiving the top aggregate plac
ing, the University was also given
the "Top School" award.
Unknown to many students, the
debate society had established itself
as a force in the past and has only
encountered difficulties in recent
years. In fact, the Cardinal current
ly boasts the lOth-ranked debater
in the world, senior Matthew Rabi
nowitz. If the society can maintain
its present momentum, Stanford
can return to its glory days and
once again challenge East Coast
powers year in and year out.
The Stanford Debate Society
deserves recognition and congratu
lations for its efforts at maintaining
a top-notch program without major
resources other than the commit
ment and determination of its
members. Moreover, the society has
proven that you don't need glam
our and national TV exposure to
make a top-notch team.
