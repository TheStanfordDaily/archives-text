# Yet another first
## 
### 
AS FAR BACK as May 10,
1869, when old Leland
Senior drove in the golden
spike to complete the transconti
nental railroad, and as recently as
June 18, 1983, when alumna
Sally Hide blasted off as the first
woman in space, the Stanford
name has been inextricably linked
with notable firsts.
As we move into the '90s — a
time of financial constraints and
mounting responsibilities for the
University — it is gratifying to
see that Stanford departments
and divisions have not lost their
zeal for bravely breaking new
ground. Just a few months ago,
for example, SLAC physicist Mar
tin Perl won the Nobel Prize for
being the first to discover the tau
lepton.
And now, another notable first
comes from an unexpected source:
History is being made by the Stan
ford Management Company.
Refusing to bow to complacen
cy, the management company and

its intrepid leader, David Long
bine, have pulled off a retailing
coup de grace bv announcing late
last month that the Stanford
Shopping Center, already home to
Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and
an awfully big Macy's, will soon
receive a new major tenant:
Bloomingdale's.
Through hard work of the man
agement company and through
the benevolence of Federated
Department Stores Inc., Stanford
will proudly become the home of
the first Bloomingdale's in North
ern California, one of the first
four Bloomie's west of the Rock
ies.
So congratulations, then, are in
order. To the Stanford Manage
ment Company and to Mr. Long
bine, we must wish — as is said
back in New York, home to the
Bloomie's chain — a hearty mazel
tov. And we must also thank you
for doing your part to keep Stan
ford ahead of the educational —
and retailing — packs.
