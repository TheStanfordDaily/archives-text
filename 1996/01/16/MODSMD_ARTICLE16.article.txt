## Slave to the survey

IS STANFORD THE best university
in the country? To answer t hat ques
tion, don't look at the classes, and
forget about the caliber of the teaching.
Further, whether or not students are
happy and satisfied with their education
won't help you judge Stanford either.
An in-depth look into Stanford is
unnecessary because U.S. News and
World Report has happily done this for
us. As most of us neurotics are aware,
Stanford is now recognized by the "must
rank everything that exists" magazine
as the fourth-best university in the
nation. A few years ago, we were the
best, then we were the third-best, then
the fourth-best, then the sixth-best,
after which we improved and became the
fifth-best, and now we are the fourth
best university in the country.
All these shifts in our caliber in lesn
than a decade. Call it an educated guess,
but something tells me that the folks at
U.S. News don't know what the hell
they're talking about.
The publication, which would rank
ice cream if the ranking could sell maga
zines, uses a grab bag of mathematical
formulas and superficial surveys to give
universities a magic number, a digit by
which schools get a magic rank.
What shocks me about the ranking is
not that it exists, but that university
leaders treat it like the 1 Ith command
ment. Stanford policies are being twist
ed to improve our appearance under the
skewed and baseless lens of a magazine.

This year, Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid James Montoya started
the Early Decision program. It gives a
student an easier shot at getting into
Stanford il the student gives up all legal
rights to choose anywhere else.
Why the Early Decision program? The
real goal is to increase our "yield," the
percentage of students we get into Stan
ford who choose Stanford. Ry increasing
the yield, we increase our "student selec
tivity" rank, and then, if we're really
lucky, that will improve our overall uni
versity rank. Of course, an increase in
such a rank would not mean we were
more selective or that the students we
admit were smarter in any way. Con
trary to popular myth, lowering our
admissions standard for students who
really want to come here will not make
for a more "selective" student body.
Ever since U.S. News included an
"alumni satisfaction" rank, where Stan
ford placed somewhere behind the Uni
versity of Kentucky, University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper has worked dili
gently to improve our numbers. From
expanding and broadening our beg-a
thon to labeling University giving a
"moral responsibility," Casper has suc
ceeded in improving our alumni sat isfac
tion rank.
Of course, this doesn't mean that
Stanford alumni are any more satisfied
than they were three years ago. If any
thing, with Casper's U.S. News rank
ings-based policies, we've only succeed-

Ed in improving our alumni annoyance
level. When we graduate, we'll all be
sentenced to a lifetime of phone calls
asking us for a piece of our hard-earned
income.
It is disturbing to see Montoya and
Casper, two of the nation's top educa
tional leaders, bark and roll over to the
calls of a capricious magazine. The more
time Montoya and Casper spend on
making Stanford look better, the more
time is diverted from truly improving
the University.
What we should aim for is a universi
ty that is so far superior to its rivals that
nnv magazine which asserts otherwise
will look senseless for saying so. Help or
get rid of the many teachers who can't
teach. Shrink the size of class sections.
Slow the pace of reading schedules to
allow for real learning. Put in a real stu
dent union, or transform Tresidder into
one.
There are so many substantial ways
to improve Stanford that the last thing
Montoya and Casper should be working
on are the vacuous ranks as defined by
some money-thirsty magazine.
We can still be the best in the nation.
We don't need a ranking to tell us so.

Mr. Small would be more interested in a
ranking of ice-cream makers.
