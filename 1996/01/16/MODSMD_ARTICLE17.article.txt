Law faculty politics sank Hing's tenure nomination

DESPITE SOME HALF-hearted
efforts by the administration, it
looks like a certain clique of pro
fessors over at the Law School is set on
turning that institution into a first-class
School of the Damned. U.S. News and
World Report — are you listening?
Latest case in point: the botched
tenure nomination of Professor Bill Ong
Hing. At Stanford since 1985, Hing is
the Law School's resident expert on
immigration law. He is a cornerstone of
the school's public interest curriculum.
He teaches practical clinical courses on
immigration law and education law. He
has published articles in leading legal
journals and has published an immigra
tion law treatise.
But last month, after realizing that
he faced almost certain defeat if his
tenure nomination came up for a vote,
Hing wisely withdrew himself from the
process and opted to make a bid for a
non-tenured, six-year renewable profes
sorship. It was a dramatic if disappoint
ing moment, particularly for Hing's stu
dent and faculty supporters who had
been wringing their hands since last

spring, when the faculty tabled Hing's
tenure vote.
Even more dramatic, if contemptible,
were the antics of some of the anti-Hing
professors who, rumor says, lobbied
their colleagues to vote against Hing.
And you thought you'd seen the worst of
petty, pouty politics during the election
for class president back in the seventh
grade.
No one seems to be talking much, so
it's been difficult trying to decipher the
motive that drove these professors to
swipe the Law School's welcome mat
from underneath Hing's feet and then
shake the dust out right in his face. The
most widely circulated opinion is that
the self-appointed Star Chamber did not
feel that Hing's academic products
passed its test for valuable legal scholar
ship (sic), and that Hing himself there
fore was not worthy of a tenured posi
tion.
Please. Knowing the pettiness that
infects a great deal of the Law School
community, I wouldn't be surprised if
the real reasons driving the anti-Hing
professors were much simpler and more

personal than that.
Hing may have lost in his bid for
tenure, but the real loser in the whole
affair is Stanford Law School. In addi
tion to providing the school with immi
gration and education law expertise,
Hing, an Asian American, would have
improved the Law School's up-to-now
spotty record for faculty diversity.
Hing's rejection marks the fourth time
in four years that the school has dissed
and dismissed a faculty member of color.
Remember Mari Matsuda, Charles
Lawrence and Jerry Lopez?
The fact is Stanford Law School likes
to put its diversity where its mouth is
but rarely puts it where it counts: on the
tenured faculty. The school waves the
banner of equal opportunity, but,
through its tenure process, makes it
clear that some faculty members are
more equal than others. It denigrates
the academic contributions of professors
like Hing and denies those professors a
home base from which to work toward
securing recognition of the value of their
research.
This whole business almost makes me

feel sorry for the current Law School
administrat ion. At least if someone
accuses University President Gerhard
Casper of fostering a minority-hostile
climate in his administration, he can
point to people like Provost Condoleezza
Rice and Dean of Admissions and Finan
cial Aid Jim Montoya, momentarily
silencing even the most critical tongues.
But who or what is the Law School
going to point to — the handful of
minority professors who have yet to
undergo the tempering flames of the
tenure process?
How ironic that the day after Hing
withdrew his nomination, Jesse Jackson
whipped the crowd in White Plaza into a
froth, talking about the enemies of an
inclusive society. At certain points in his
speech, Jackson seemed to imply that
the enemies and the battle lay over
"there," somewhere else. After all, it's
easier to find the courage to fight an
enemy who is far away. But, if anything,
Hing's failed tenure bid reminds us that
there's plenty of battle right here.
