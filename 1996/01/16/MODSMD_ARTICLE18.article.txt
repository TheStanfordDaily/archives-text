# Wolf is unreasonable to impress his view of life on those who took class
## 
### 
As a Stanford alum, I must take excep
tion to the remarks made by Michael
Wolf in a letter printed in the Jan. 12
issue of The Stanford Daily regarding
Stanford undergraduates. The comments

demonstrate his own lack of exposure to
the world beyond the University.
There are individuals in every aspect
of society who seek the easy path and an
even greater number of people who sim
ply choose a different path from his own
Hut so what? If some of his students did
not choose to learn on his terms, so be it
It is not, as he suggested, a teaching
assistant's responsibility to inflict his or
her own views of the real world on his or

her students.
I was particularly troubled, though,
with Wolfs comments about the chal
lenges Stanford grads face today in find
ing work. I simply do not see a connection
between this alleged sense of entitlement
on the part of Stanford students and a
tight job market. There are fewer jobs for
all college grads these days; a sense of
entitlement has nothing to do with it.
Perhaps when he completes his own

degree and begins a job search, he will
develop adequate empathy for young job
seekers.
It is unfortunate that Wolf has had
difficulty relating to his students, but
why does ho feel that a Stanford TA
should have it any easier than a TA at
any other school? Take a bit of your own
advice, Mr. Wolf, and quit your whining.
