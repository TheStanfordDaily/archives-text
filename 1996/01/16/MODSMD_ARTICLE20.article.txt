# Wolf should take time to get to know students instead of criticizing them
## 
### 
This fall quarter, I had the great pleasure of
being a teaching assistant for Human Biolo
gy 177 / Psychology 177. Unlike those of
Michael Wolf, who authored a letter in the Jan. 12
issue of The Daily, my experiences have reinforced
my view that Stanford students are a truly diverse
and hard-working group of individuals.
In his letter, Wolf expounds on the "spoiled"
attributes of undergraduate Stanford students, cit
ing five examples as evidence. Ile asks why "some
Stanford students seem to think that they are enti
tled to special privileges" and requests that some
thing "be done to address this attitude." Perhaps it
is his own attitude that needs to be adjusted, not
that of the Stanford undergraduate population.
In a supposedly telling example, Wolf relates an
incident in which a couple of students showed up
30 minutes late for a midterm "because they had
been attending the Jesse Jackson speech, which
had been so exciting." He writes that "they seri
ously expected to get an extra half hour of time
and were very offended when they had to turn in

the exam at the same time as everybody else."
Perhaps Wolf was too busy making mental note
of yet another preposterous act of spoiled under
grads to add to his list. How else could he have
failed to notice that one of those students was the
main organizer of the rally, Bill Shen, who almost
single-handedly brought Jesse Jackson to our cam
pus for an affirmative action rally attended by
more than 2,000 students (mostly undergrads)?
In light of Stanford's infamous political apathy,
the fact that so many students took time away
from their classes to become politically aware or
involved is a mark of anything but being spoiled
brats who are grade-obsessed and self-promoting.
Given Wolf s own words that "teaching at a univer
sity like Stanford should not be limited to course
work," his inflexible attitude towards education
and failure to grant Shen the extra time on an
exam smacks of hypocrisy.
It is disappointing to hear such condescending
and ill-founded negative views from a fellow TA.
Wolf is obviously far removed from the undergrad

uate world of pressures, stresses, dreams and
ambitions. He is forced to use a few misapprehend
ed anecdotes as illustrations of the supposedly
spoiled nature of Stanford undergrads.
Of course, I recognize Wolfs frustrations. I too
have had my share of inappropriate requests and
inconsiderate excuses from students. Some of these
instances are the result of miscommunicating my
own expectations and some are cases of students
trying to take advantage of the system. These lat
ter instances, however, are not unique to Stanford
University undergraduates and certainly cannot be
made the base of overriding stereotypes stemming
from a biased sample.
More importantly, however, if there is anything
specific to Stanford students, it is the frantically
busy schedule of most undergraduates. While any
TA has the right to feel frustrated when a student
flakes on an appointment or asks to meet at a more
convenient location, he or she should consider
whether these "spoiled acts" are not just the out
come of an over-committed schedule.

In my experiences as a TA, I have been humbled
by the quality of thought and diligence by which
most students approach the material presented in
a course. I would recommend being a TA to anyone
who feels discouraged about their Stanford peers.
It has been an experience which has forced me to
consider the different educational needs of stu
dents from various cultural and socioeconomic
groups while simultaneously demonstrating that
Stanford undergrads share a quality of academic
perseverance that speaks true of our reputation
after all.
In the future, I would hope that Mr. Wolf would
think more carefully about his students' circum
stances before jumping to harmful conclusions.
Regardless of our individual preferences and hang
ups, as TAs, we have a responsibility of encourag
ing other students in their academic endeavors,
not admonishing them for our own misunder
standings and misled stereotypes.
