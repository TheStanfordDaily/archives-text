# Hospital fixes understaffing
## Low nurse-to-infant ratios corrected in neonatal unit 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
After spending parts of the summer in hot water
due to reported violations of state regulations, admin
istrators at the Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hos
pital are facing new allegations of mismanaged rare.
The latest disagreement between state officials and
the hospital — this time over how many nurses should
be assigned to the hospital's facilities for seriously ill
newborns — appears to be nearing settlement, and a
related accusation that the hospital had an abnormally
high rate of infection for infants in those facilities was
found to be false by state investigators.
Dawn O'Connor, director of communications for
the hospital, said the central issue in this year's regu
latory discussions has been the "interpretation of
guidelines" for the hospital's neonatal intensive care
unit.
State law requires that the hospital devote one
nurse to such units for every two babies at the highest
level of risk. The state found that staffing levels at the
hospital dipped to one nurse |xt three infants several
times in the p;ist few months 42 times in November
and 13 times in December.
O'Connor, however, argued that because not all of

the babies in Packard's neonatal unit were at the high
est level of risk, staffing levels were actually above state
guidelines in some of those instances.
A state official said yesterday that the violations
were not serious and that the practices leading to
understaffing had been corrected. Nevertheless, future
meetings with state regulators are scheduled to go over
the hospital's plan of correction, O'Connor said.
This is the second time in six months that the
Department of Health Services, the state agency that
oversees the hospital cited the hospital for violations.
In June, a surprise inspection revealed lapses in paper
work at the hospital.
After filing a 25-page report of the violations, the
agency gave the hospital 30 days to correct the prob
lems, and placed the hospital on warning that its Medi
care and Medi-Cal funding could be withheld. The
issue wasn't fully resolved until August, when the
department approved a 100-page correction plan put
together by the hospital.
A similar correction plan has been submitted in the
more recent case, and officials on both sides expect
approval in the coming weeks.
The hospital has been ranked among the top 5 per
cent of all hospitals in the country by the Joint Com
mission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.
