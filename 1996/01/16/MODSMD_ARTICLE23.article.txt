Stanford 80

A reliable friend abandoned the No. 24
Stanford men's basketball team Sunday
afternoon in Los Angeles. A previously
stingy Cardinal defense allowed an oppo
nent to shoot over 50 percent in a game for
the first time this year as USC downed the
Stanford 84-80.
The Trojans (9-6 overall, 2-2 Pacific 10
Conference) made 27 of 49 shots from the
field and sealed their victory by hitting 15-
of-20 from the free-throw line as a desper
ate Stanford comeback fell short in front of
a funereal 2,401 fans. The win snapped
USC's five-game losing streak to the Cardi
nal.
"Our defense was terrible today, espe
cially down low," said senior forward Dar
ren Allawav. "We didn't make the plays we
were supposed to. We're seniors and
juniors, but we played like freshmen."
Ahead 59-50 with 10 minutes, 24 sec
onds to play in the game, the Cardinal (8-4,
2-2) then fell on the wrong end of a 17-2
run. Four turnovers and six missed shots
by Stanford contributed to the turnaround,
but the momentum did not fully swing
away from the Cardinal until Trojan Bran
don Martin nailed a three-pointer from the
corner at the 5:50 mark.
Martin got open because Cardinal point

guard Brevin Knight was crumpled in a
heap on the sideline near midcourt. He
took a knee to the back in a scramble for a
loose ball, aggravating a back problem.
Freshman Arthur Lee replaced Knight
for only 15 seconds, but during that span,
he threw a bad pass from the top of the key
which led to a breakaway dunk by Trojan
Stais Boseman. Senior Dion Cross was
called for a touch foul on the dunk and
Boseman sank the free throw to give USC a
65-61 lead with 5:35 left.
"I couldn't tell you where we lost it, but
that dunk by Boseman was big," said
Knight, who led Stanford with 20 points.
After Boseman's dunk, USC extended
its lead to as much as seven, but Stanford
wouldn't die. Fouling every Trojan posses
sion starting at the 2:45 mark, the Cardinal
could never narrow the margin to less than
four until Lee hit a three-pointer with 18.4
seconds to play.
"We couldn't come up with a key play,"
said head coach Mike Montgomery. "Even
in the end, it was still a two-possession
game. With a three or a steal, it becomes a
one-possession game. They just made plays
when they had to."
Boseman, a 35.7 percent free-throw
shooter in conference play who shoots 63.2
percent overall, kept the Trojans on top by
going 8-for-10 from the free-throw line
over the final 2:45. Leading all scorers with
22, Boseman took control of his team after
junior point guard Cameron Murray was
sidelined with back spasms after playing
only two minutes.
