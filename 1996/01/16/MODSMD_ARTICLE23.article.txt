Stanford 80

A reliable friend abandoned the No. 24
Stanford men's basketball team Sunday
afternoon in Los Angeles. A previously
stingy Cardinal defense allowed an oppo
nent to shoot over 50 percent in a game for
the first time this year as USC downed the
Stanford 84-80.
The Trojans (9-6 overall, 2-2 Pacific 10
Conference) made 27 of 49 shots from the
field and sealed their victory by hitting 15-
of-20 from the free-throw line as a desper
ate Stanford comeback fell short in front of
a funereal 2,401 fans. The win snapped
USC's five-game losing streak to the Cardi
nal.
"Our defense was terrible today, espe
cially down low," said senior forward Dar
ren Allawav. "We didn't make the plays we
were supposed to. We're seniors and
juniors, but we played like freshmen."
Ahead 59-50 with 10 minutes, 24 sec
onds to play in the game, the Cardinal (8-4,
2-2) then fell on the wrong end of a 17-2
run. Four turnovers and six missed shots
by Stanford contributed to the turnaround,
but the momentum did not fully swing
away from the Cardinal until Trojan Bran
don Martin nailed a three-pointer from the
corner at the 5:50 mark.
Martin got open because Cardinal point

guard Brevin Knight was crumpled in a
heap on the sideline near midcourt. He
took a knee to the back in a scramble for a
loose ball, aggravating a back problem.
Freshman Arthur Lee replaced Knight
for only 15 seconds, but during that span,
he threw a bad pass from the top of the key
which led to a breakaway dunk by Trojan
Stais Boseman. Senior Dion Cross was
called for a touch foul on the dunk and
Boseman sank the free throw to give USC a
65-61 lead with 5:35 left.
"I couldn't tell you where we lost it, but
that dunk by Boseman was big," said
Knight, who led Stanford with 20 points.
After Boseman's dunk, USC extended
its lead to as much as seven, but Stanford
wouldn't die. Fouling every Trojan posses
sion starting at the 2:45 mark, the Cardinal
could never narrow the margin to less than
four until Lee hit a three-pointer with 18.4
seconds to play.
"We couldn't come up with a key play,"
said head coach Mike Montgomery. "Even
in the end, it was still a two-possession
game. With a three or a steal, it becomes a
one-possession game. They just made plays
when they had to."
Boseman, a 35.7 percent free-throw
shooter in conference play who shoots 63.2
percent overall, kept the Trojans on top by
going 8-for-10 from the free-throw line
over the final 2:45. Leading all scorers with
22, Boseman took control of his team after
junior point guard Cameron Murray was
sidelined with back spasms after playing
only two minutes.
"lUSC| played under control and they
didn't take bad shots," Mont
gomery said. "Since Murray was
out, they became very patient."
Coming off a 51-30 drubbing
on the boards against UCLA
Thursday night, Stanford went to
the glass hard Sunday, outre
bounding USC 44-27. Allawav led
the way with 13 rebounds (eight
offensive), tying a career-high as
he seemed to get at least one hand
on every errant shot. Allaway also
added a season-high 15 points.
"I thought we were supposed
to win games when we outre
bound them," Allaway said with a
painful grin. "The loss had more
to do with our inability to make
plays. My lane violation (on a
made free-throw by Cross), that
foul on the dunk . . . those silly
plays, when you look back on
(hem, you get that searing feeling
in your chest and a wrenching in
your gut."
The Cardinal suffered through
another tough shooting day at
40.0 percent, the fifth game in a
row Stanford has shot under 50

percent. After finding his shot
against Arizona, Cross struggled
this weekend, going 4-lor-19 from
three-point range. Although hi
scored 16 points against USC, it
came on 4-of-Hi shooting, drop
ping his season field-goal percent
age to 37.8 percent.
Senior forward Andy Poppink,
who fouled out at the 1:44 mark
in the second half, saw a connec
tion between the poor showing
by both the offense and defense.
"I think we got flustered on
offense and tried to extend our
selves too much on defense," hi'
said "We had a chance to win,
but for some reason, we couldn't
pull it out."
Despite playing only 18 min
utes, Poppink had his way on
offense. Scoring 1 1 points (on 4-
of-8 shooting) and grabbing eight
rebounds, Poppink said he felt
like he was constantly getting
caught in the wrong place at tin
wrong time on defense. As for his
fifth foul, the referee saw Pop
pink grab an open rebound with a
Trojan player falling away from
him and instinctively called I'op

out, they became very patient."
Coming off a 51-30 drubbing
on the boards against UCLA
Thursday night, Stanford went to
the glass hard Sunday, outre
bounding USC 44-27. Allawav led
the way with 13 rebounds (eight
offensive), tying a career-high as
he seemed to get at least one hand
on every errant shot. Allaway also
added a season-high 15 points.
"I thought we were supposed
to win games when we outre
bound them," Allaway said with a
painful grin. "The loss had more
to do with our inability to make
plays. My lane violation (on a
made free-throw by Cross), that
foul on the dunk . . . those silly
plays, when you look back on
(hem, you get that searing feeling
in your chest and a wrenching in
your gut."
The Cardinal suffered through
another tough shooting day at
40.0 percent, the fifth game in a
row Stanford has shot under 50

percent. After finding his shot
against Arizona, Cross struggled
this weekend, going 4-lor-19 from
three-point range. Although hi
scored 16 points against USC, it
came on 4-of-Hi shooting, drop
ping his season field-goal percent
age to 37.8 percent.
Senior forward Andy Poppink,
who fouled out at the 1:44 mark
in the second half, saw a connec
tion between the poor showing
by both the offense and defense.
"I think we got flustered on
offense and tried to extend our
selves too much on defense," hi'
said "We had a chance to win,
but for some reason, we couldn't
pull it out."
Despite playing only 18 min
utes, Poppink had his way on
offense. Scoring 1 1 points (on 4-
of-8 shooting) and grabbing eight
rebounds, Poppink said he felt
like he was constantly getting
caught in the wrong place at tin
wrong time on defense. As for his
fifth foul, the referee saw Pop
pink grab an open rebound with a
Trojan player falling away from
him and instinctively called I'op
pink for the push-off
"I didn't touch anybody," Pop
