Playing what he calls "Tommie Frazier
Ball," Nebraska quarterback Tommie Fra
zier put his personal stamp on the 71st
Annual East-West Shrine Game, which
took place Saturday afternoon at Stanford
Stadium.
Frazier, who led the Cornhuskers to
their second-consecutive national champi
onship two weeks ago, directed the West
squad to a 34-18 victory over the East with
his pinpoint passing and strong runs. Con
necting on 11 of 20 passes for 163 yards
and a touchdown, the Cornhusker signal
caller secured the game's offensive MVP
award and drew rave reviews from his West
teammates and coaches.
"He's really good. I think he can be a
good NFL quarterback," said Stanford
wide receiver Mark Harris. "He throws the
ball real well. He's a good leader. He'll do
all right."
"IFrazier) really helped himself in this
game," said West head coach Terry Don
ahue. "Somebody's going to invest in this
guy I in the NFL] and he's going to raise
havoc on a football team. He's magical."

Not to be outdone, the West defense
wreaked some havoc of its own, limiting
the East to 219 net yards in total offense.
Heisman Trophy winner Eddie George
managed only 32 rushing yards on 11 car
ries. The West pass rush, led by standout
defensive ends Tedy Bruschi of Arizona
and Colorado State's Brady Smith, contin
ually harassed the East's quarterbacks into
hurried throws and wrapped them up for
six sacks on the day.
"Our whole defense played very, very
well. Our defensive front really impressed
me," Donahue said. "We rotated guys all
day. As it turned out, I think we were real
ly quick on defense. We could really run to
the ball, and did."
The game started out slowly as the
crowd of 68,500 witnessed an exchange of
punts. Both quarterbacks were out of their
element in the pro offense. Indeed, Vir
ginia's Mike Groh lost a yard passing while
Frazier misfired on his first three pass
attempts.
Groh settled down first, leading the East
to the r first score of the game. Starting at
his own 24-yard line, he quickly found
Florida wide receiver Chris Doering for 26
yards. Eight plays later, the East drive
stalled at the West 25-yard line. Connecti
cut's David DeArmas came on to boot a 42-
yard field goal to give the East a 3-0 lead.
The West responded with a 12-play drive
highlighted by a 16-yard run around left
end by Frazier. Three plays later, Texas
Christian's Andre Davis punched
it in from two yards out to put the
West up 7-3 with two minutes, 31
seconds left in the first quarter.
Early in the second period, the
West defense sacked Michigan
State quarterback Tony Banks,
forcing a fumble that was recov
ered by Oregon linebacker Jere
my As her. The offense, now led by
Washington signal caller Damon
Huard, quickly marched the team
down to the East's 11-yard line.
Facing third-and-10, Huard
dumped a pass to Davis coming
out of the backfield. Davis did the
rest, jumping over a defender at
the goal line and flipping into the
end zone for the score as the West
cruised into intermission with a
13-3 advantage.
The East quickly rallied in the
second half as South Carolina's
Stanley Pritchchett scored on a
four-yard scamper with 11:50 left
in the third quarter to narrow the
gap to 13-10. Temple linebacker
Willie Brown set up the score by
slipping through to deflect and
recover a West punt.
"Well, I did something right for
a change," said Brown, who gar
nered defensive player of the
game honors. "Since I have the
same name as the San Francisco
mayor, maybe he can give me a
job."
After thr'tfe Straight punts,
Michigan's Mercury Hayes gave
the East excellent field position
with an electrifying 46-yard
return to just over midlield. It
took Banks only one play to hit
pay dirt, finding Doering on a 49-
yard bomb.
Doering, who finished with
four catches for 93 yards, out
jumped his defender in the lower
corner of the end zone. Banks
then found Michigan's Amani
Toomer in the back of the end
zone for the conversion as the

East regained the lead 18-13 with
just over five minutes remaining
in the third.
Frazier replaced an ineffective
Huard and preceded to secure not
only a victory for Donahue's
squad, but perhaps also a future
as an NFL passer. With several
pro scouts looking on, the Fiesta
Bowl MVP used several of his
receivers, including Harris on a
12-yard sideline route, to move
the ball downfield.
After finding Davis on a key
fourth-down conversion, Frazier
bootlegged around right end for a
five yard score, capping off the
nine-play, 84-yard drive. He
would finish the day with 33
yards rushing on six carries to go
along with his score. The conver
sion pass to Calgary's Don Blair
put the West up for good 21-18
with 10 minutes to go.
On the ensuing series, Texas
A&M's Ray Mickens picked off a
pass intended for George. Wast
ing little time, Frazier handed off
to Nevada's Alex Van Dyke, who
launched a tight spiral and con
nected with wide-open Fresno
State receiver Charlie Jones for a
36-yard touchdown reception.
With just under five minutes
left, Frazier capped off his bril
liant performance by finding
UCIjVs Kevin Jordan for a 52-
yard touchdown pass.
"Donahue and [assistant head
coach Mike] Price played against
me [before] and they knew what
kind of arm I had," Frazier said.
"They felt it was very important
for them to go out and let people
know what type of arm 1 have. "
Despite his 33-3 record at
Nebraska and remarkable perfor
mance in the Shrine game, Fra
zier believes there are still
doubters. "You could be the best
player on earth, but someone is
always going to have room to cri
tique you," he said. "You see
Michael Jordan out there and you
have someone critiquing him. It's
part of life."
For Cardinal players Harris

and offensive tackle Jeff Buckey,
the Shrine exhibition was the last
game of their careers. Harris fin
ished with two receptions for 21
yards.
"It was really great playing for
such a great cause and it was nice
to L r <> out of here a winner," Buck

ey said.
"The best thing, 1 think, is
meeting the guys from different
schools that you've competed
against," Harris said. "Getting a
chance to finally be teammates
with them is a great honor. It's
really a great experience."
