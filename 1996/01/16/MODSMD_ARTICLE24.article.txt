Playing what he calls "Tommie Frazier
Ball," Nebraska quarterback Tommie Fra
zier put his personal stamp on the 71st
Annual East-West Shrine Game, which
took place Saturday afternoon at Stanford
Stadium.
Frazier, who led the Cornhuskers to
their second-consecutive national champi
onship two weeks ago, directed the West
squad to a 34-18 victory over the East with
his pinpoint passing and strong runs. Con
necting on 11 of 20 passes for 163 yards
and a touchdown, the Cornhusker signal
caller secured the game's offensive MVP
award and drew rave reviews from his West
teammates and coaches.
"He's really good. I think he can be a
good NFL quarterback," said Stanford
wide receiver Mark Harris. "He throws the
ball real well. He's a good leader. He'll do
all right."
"IFrazier) really helped himself in this
game," said West head coach Terry Don
ahue. "Somebody's going to invest in this
guy I in the NFL] and he's going to raise
havoc on a football team. He's magical."

Not to be outdone, the West defense
wreaked some havoc of its own, limiting
the East to 219 net yards in total offense.
Heisman Trophy winner Eddie George
managed only 32 rushing yards on 11 car
ries. The West pass rush, led by standout
defensive ends Tedy Bruschi of Arizona
and Colorado State's Brady Smith, contin
ually harassed the East's quarterbacks into
hurried throws and wrapped them up for
six sacks on the day.
"Our whole defense played very, very
well. Our defensive front really impressed
me," Donahue said. "We rotated guys all
day. As it turned out, I think we were real
ly quick on defense. We could really run to
the ball, and did."
The game started out slowly as the
crowd of 68,500 witnessed an exchange of
punts. Both quarterbacks were out of their
element in the pro offense. Indeed, Vir
ginia's Mike Groh lost a yard passing while
Frazier misfired on his first three pass
attempts.
Groh settled down first, leading the East
to the r first score of the game. Starting at
his own 24-yard line, he quickly found
Florida wide receiver Chris Doering for 26
yards. Eight plays later, the East drive
stalled at the West 25-yard line. Connecti
cut's David DeArmas came on to boot a 42-
yard field goal to give the East a 3-0 lead.
The West responded with a 12-play drive
highlighted by a 16-yard run around left
end by Frazier. Three plays later, Texas
