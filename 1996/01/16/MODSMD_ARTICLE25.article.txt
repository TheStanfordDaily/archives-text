# Starbird sets record in 88-67 win

Stanford 88
USC 67

There was only one story in
Stanford's 88-67 victory over
USC Saturday afternoon at
Maples Pavilion, and that story
was Kate Starbird.
Starbird, the Cardinal's resi
dent superstar, rang up 44 points
with the help of 7-of-ll shooting
from three-point land to eclipse
Jeanne Ruark HofTs 16-year-old
school record and upstage co-head
coach Marianne Stanley's debut
appearance against her former
employer.
Stanley, who coached the Tro
jans from 1989-1993, said she was
glad Starbird's performance
diverted some of the media atten
tion away from the fact that she
was coaching against her former
team.
"I'm very happy, but not just
because [Starbird's fireworks]
came against USC," she said. "I
was just sitting there watching
I Starbird] and thinking this is
one of the best I've ever seen. And
I've seen some great players. Boy
was I glad I was here to see it. I'm
really happy for her, and so is
everyone else."
It was hard not to be happy for
Starbird on a night when she sim
ply couldn't miss. The junior
guard / forward was virtually
flawless in the first period, drilling
seven of 12 shots from the field —
including a phenomenal 5-of-6
from behind the three-point line
en route to 24 first-half points.
Starbird kept it coming in the
second half until finally, with four
minutes, 21 seconds remaining, a
driving lay-up put her within two
points of Hoff s school record.
"Three-and-a-half minutes left
in the game, when no one was

taking me out, I kept wondering
when the person at the podium
was going to come for me," Star
bird said. "Then, during the time
out, [head coach Amy Tucker]
said, 'I just need you to make one
more,' and then I did, and then
she said, 'You just tied it. I need
you to make one more."'
Starbird tied the record at the
2:20 mark in dramatic fashion,
stealing the ball from Trojan star
forward Tina Thompson and then
driving the length of the court,
crossing from right to left under
the basket to sink a breathtaking
one-handed reverse lay-up.
That shot set the stage for the
record-breaker. USC guard Erica
Jackson fouled Starbird with only
39 seconds remaining, sending
Starbird to the free-throw line
with a chance to etch her name in
the record books. Calm and col
lected, Starbird drained both
shots — the final Stanford points
of the game — to set a new school
standard.
"I guess it really hasn't sunk in
yet," Starbird said. "All I know is
I did it, then 1 got lifted up by the
big girls and I was about seven
feet tall.
"As a freshman 1 had no clue
I'd ever get to play. I had no clue
I'd ever break the record for
points scored in a game."
Starbird finished 13-of-25
from the floor and 1 l-of-13 from
the free-throw line. Her 44 points
were the most scored by a Divi
sion I player this season and the
fourth-highest total in Pacific 10
Conference history.
Perhaps overlooked in the
wake of Starbird's performance
was the return of junior point
guard Jamila Wideman, who
played extensively in Thursday's
81-77 win over UCLA but started
Saturday for the first time since
Dec. 30. Wideman, who suffered a
sprained ankle two-and-a-half
weeks ago, finished with 11 points
and eight assists. The Stanford

defense also performed well,
holding Thompson, the Pac-10's
second-leading scorer, to 5-of-19
shooting.
Meanwhile, Stanley enjoyed a
victory in her first coaching
assignment against the school
with which she is currently
embroiled in a bitter legal battle.
Stanley filed a lawsuit against
USC in 1993 after her request
for a salary equitable to that of

the men's basketball coach led to
the loss of her job and her home.
Her case is awaiting appeal.
With Saturday's win over the
Trojans (6-7 overall, 1-3 Pac-10),
Stanford improved to 11-2 (4-0
Pac-10) while extending its
home winning streak to 24
games, now the longest of its
kind in the nation after No. 3
Connecticut's home loss to
Georgia on Monday. With last
weekend's sweep of the two
Southern California schools, the
Cardinal also climbed one spot to
No. 5 in the Associated Press top
25.
