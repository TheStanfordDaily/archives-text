# Starbird overshadows Stanley's debut
## 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
In spite of junior Kate Starbird's
heroics on Saturday, USC managed to
put forth its best showing at Maples
Pavilion in three years. Since current
Cardinal co-head coach Marianne Stan
ley left Los Angeles, the Women of Troy
have frequently landed on the wrong
end of career nights and records for
Stanford.
Cardinal post players have consis
tently out-performed their Trojan coun
terparts. In 1994, then-junior Anita
Kaplan took future Naismith Award
winner Lisa Leslie to school for a
career-best .34 points, avenging an earli
er loss in L.A. to the eventual Pacific 10
Conference champions. Last year,
Kaplan hit her first nine shots before
mercifully resting very early in the sec
ond half in Stanford's 109-53 victory,
the worst drubbing in Pac-10 history.
This year, without former coach

Cheryl Miller, USC allowed Starbird to
score more than anybody in Division 1
in a single game this season as Stanford
moved ahead 16-15 in the all-time rival
ry between the squads for the first time
since Stanford won the schools' first
meeting in 1979.
Starbird's 77-point homestand last
weekend put her on a pace to set the
Cardinal single-season scoring mark as
well, expanding her average to 21.8
points per game and 32.0 in Pac-10
play. Oregon State's Tanja Kostic, the
defending Pac-10 Player of the Year,
had been the clear-cut frontrunner to
secure the conference's highest honor.
After last weekend, however, another
Ail-American candidate emerged to
challenge her, and it wasn't the most
talented Woman of Troy, junior post
player Tina Thompson.
USC coach Fred Williams couldn't
make an adjustment to stop the 6-foot
-2 Starbird. Six-foot swing player Jody
Anton surrendered a ton of quickness,

while 5-8 guard Erica Jackson stareÂ® at
a half-foot disadvantage. Hut on Satur
day, it might not have mattered any
way. The only contest Starbird had any
chance to lose was against her team
mates, and she settled for a 44-44 tie in
the scoring column. Despite launching
25 shots from the floor, she never
turned the ball over.
When Starbird wasn't burying
threes from her favorite spot at the
wing, she was pulling up inside the arc
or taking it right to the basket, cutting
backdoor and getting easy baskets on
Jamila Wideman assists. Even in the
end, when Stanford became aware that
a record was imminent, Starbird was
kept from the record momentarily only
because she missed an uncontested 10-
foot pull-up.
True to form, Starbird tied the
record with a stunning baseline drive.
