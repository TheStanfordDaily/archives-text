Stanford men's volleyball
opened its season Friday night
at home, using Santa Cruz to
prove itself worthy of its No. 4
ranking and cruising to an easy
victory in straight sets 15-3, 15-
6, 15-1. Despite the Banana
Slugs' efforts, the Cardinal
quickly and convincingly put
the match away in a little over
an hour at Burnham Pavilion.
"This is one of our better
starts," said junior Mike Hoe
fer. "Last year, we had prob
lems putting away teams that
we should have absolutely
destroyed."
"It went really well," said
freshman Josh Palacios. "We
had to beat fSanta Cruz] con
vincingly and we did it."
Taking advantage of Stan
ford's new formation, which
uses three middle blockers
instead of the customary two,
Brian Moore quickly set the
tone for the evening in game
one. The 6-foot-9 junior
blocked an attempted kill to
even the score at one. This
started a burst of seven

straight points for the Cardinal,
primarily on the strength of
Moore's blocks.
"IThe new formation) makes
our lineup taller than anyone else
in our division," said senior Jeff
Bender.
"This is something that has
never been done before," Hoefer
said. "It really screws up the
other team."
After the Slugs called timeout
to regroup, Stanford's onslaught
continued. Junior co-captain
Stewart Chong's kill put the Car
dinal ahead 11-1. Sophomore
Devin Pool man eventually closed
the match with a kill of his own
for the 15-3 margin of victory.
Game two started ominously
for Stanford. Santa Cruz ran off
the first four points as Cardinal
hitters sent balls out of bounds.
Cardinal coach Ruben Nieves
called timeout to settle his crew.
"He just told us to settle
down," Hoefer said. "[The deficit]
was mostly stuff we were doing to

ourselves. We were having a few
problems passing. But you just
have to put it behind you and play
like it's 0-0."
The Cardinal followed through
on Nieves' advice immediately.
Moore blocked an attempted kill
to put the Cardinal on the board
and sophomore Keenan White
hurst's block evened the score at
four. From that juncture, Stan
ford never looked back. The Car
dinal scored 11 of the last 13
points, ending on yet another
block by sophomore Tad Hoff
man.
The final game was a quick
study in demoralizing an oppo
nent. The Cardinal played error
free volleyball except for one ball
that sailed out of bounds, giving
Santa Cruz its only point in game
three. Aces by junior Aaron Gar
cia and strong defense paced the
Cardinal to a 12-1 lead. The Slugs
saw the ball fly out of bounds on
them three straight times to put
an end to the match.
Stanford will next compete in
the UC-Santa Barbara Collegiate
Tournament in Santa Barbara
this Friday and Saturday before
tackling California on Jan. 26.
