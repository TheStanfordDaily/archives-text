Hampered by an unusually
large number of injuries, the
Stanford wrestling team suffered
its first dual-meet defeat of the
season at the hands of Air Force
last Friday at Burn ham Pavilion.
A combination of forfeits and a
lack of starters broke the Cardi
nal's back, leading to its 24-17
loss. Fewer than half of Stan
ford's starters were able to wres
tle and three matches were auto
matically lost by forfeit.
Despite the severe disadvan
tages, however, the Cardinal
started off the meet on a strong
note, taking a 17-6 lead into the
sixth match. Unfortunately for
Stanford, sophomore Scott Chap
man (167 pounds) encountered
trouble in the sixth match and
eventually lost to Jeremy Potvin
3-2. The only other Cardinal
defeat that did not result from
forfeit was junior heavyweight
Chris Serjak's 10-4 loss to Jake
Sherer.
Stanford victors included
seniors Matt Cano (126) and
Jimmy Aguire (142), sophomores
Robert Hatta (134) and Jeff
Grant (158) and freshman Doug
Bardsley (150»
"Starting the dual behind 18-0
(due to forfeits) against Air Force
Academy was disheartening,
especially when we have one of
our best teams ever this vear —

when all our starters are in the
line-up," said 17-year head coach
Chris Horpel. "My hat is off to the
team with how they reacted to
that challenge. They competed
with a lot of heart."
The Cardinal entered the

match knowing very little about
the Falcons, whom Stanford has
met only once since Horpel took
over. The Cardinal did know,
however, that it was going to be

an uphill battle with so many
injuries. One of the more damag
ing injuries to the team is that of
senior leader Tod Surmon, who
sat out with a sprained knee. He
is slated to return in two weeks.
Surmon ranks first in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference and fifth
nationally at 150 pounds.
Other injured wrestlers
include junior Ryan Barnes
(150), out for the season with a
dislocated elbow, senior Sahlan
Martin (158), out with a neck
sprain and due back within two
weeks, and sophomore Jason
Gladden (177), who is sidelined
by nerve problems in both
elbows. Gladden should return
to action soon.
In spite of its misfortunes,
the Cardinal bolstered its confi
dence by performing well at
Saturday's Aggie Open, which
took place at UC-Davis. "The
tournament showed us that we
have made a lot of progress in
the last two weeks," Horpel

said. "My hope is that we can
continue to improve at this
rate. This kind of progress cou
pled with a speedy recovery of
our injured athletes will help us
get a record number of quali
fiers to the NCAA champi

onships."
At the Aggie Open, Cano won
his bracket while freshman Zach
Zimmerer captured third place
at 126 pounds. Freshman Beau
Weiner (142) placed second in
his bracket. Bardsley and Grant

finished fourth and third in
their respective brackets.
The Cardinal will tackle Fres
no State tomorrow. Horpel is
keeping his fingers crossed that
two of three forfeits will be
avoided this time around.
