# Clinique sits pretty in Bookstore
## Stanford greets new skin care and cosmetics counter on campus 
### Joanna Dickler Contributing writer 
Students searching for a fresh look to
usher in the new year may find their make
up muse in, of all places, the Stanford
Bookstore.
Answers to skin care and cosmetics
questions — and the products to back
them up — are available at the Bookstore's
latest permanent installation: a full-scale
Clinique department on the second floor,
complete with bonuses, a "Cyberface"
interactive computer program and work
shops designed specifically with college
students in mind.
The counter, which opened Dec. 29, is
part of the Clinique company's "Clinique
on Campus" program. Stanford's is the
12th Clinique counter to open in a college
bookstore since the program began in
1994.
According to Laura Dowling, the gener
al merchandise division manager for the
Bookstore, Clinique approached the Book
store about six months ago with the pro
posal to open a department there.
"We were already aware" that stu

dents would be interested in having cos
metics available at the Bookstore, Dowl
ing said.
She and Fred Piccirilli, the Bookstore's
buyer for gifts and accessories, said sur
veys conducted bv the Bookstore suggested
that customers were particularly interest
ed in skin care products.
"It wasn't convenient for Icustomers] to
get I skin care products] on campus," Pic
cirilli said.
Dowling said the Bookstore contacted
other university bookstores with Clinique
counters, including those at Yale Universi
ty, Brown University, UC-Santa Barbara
and UC-Davis, and "got very positive feed
back "
She added that Clinique's moderate
prices convinced the Bookstore to install a
Clinique counter.
So far, the response has been favorable
from a varied stream of customers.
"It's l>een unbelievable; it's really mind
boggling at this point," said Reva Gore
langton, the Clinique counter coordinator,
estimating that about 200 people have
been stopping by the department each day.
Interestingly, she said, nearlv half of the

customers have been men, a marked differ
ence from the 5 percent of business the
Clinique company usually attributes to
male consumers.
"We've been seeing faculty, staff, young,
old, everything," Gorelangton said. "For
the most part, people are really curious. I
haven't heard anyone say, 'Oh, this is so
stupid.' "
Gorelangton, who is the department's
only full-time employee (there are three
other part-time salespeople, including two
students), said the level of customer com
fort may be due to the construction of the
department itself, which was specifically
designed with the Bookstore's available
space in mind. Unlike department stores,
where customers wait in front of a counter
and ask about products in order to see
them, the Clinique department at the
Bookstore has no barrier.
"IPeople can) pick things up and touch
them," Gorelangton said. "It's accessible."
Students are already taking advantage
of that accessibility, albeit sometimes
with a bit of skepticism. Sharmi Dasgup
ta, a senior, came with senior Sharon
Fang to pick up a free skin-care sample.

They admitted they were there only for
the gift and would "probably not" use
Clinique now just because it's at the

Bookstore.
But, said Dasgupta, "I've seen a lot of
L r irls come bv and check it out."
