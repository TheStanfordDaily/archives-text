After a high-speed car chase and a nine-hour man
hunt Saturday, Palo Alto police apprehended a sus
pect in the Peninsula's recent string of serial rapes.
Romel Demetrias Reid, 25, whose last known ad
dress is in East Palo Alto, was arrested at 11 a.m. yes
terday.
The white van which Reid allegedly used in sever
al of his attacks helped lead police to the suspect,
though authorities would not elaborate on how they
found him. Palo Alto Police Officer Lori Kratzer said
after examining the evidence, authorities "feel
strongly that the van is connected to the rapes" and
that Reid is "linked to the van."
She also said Reid was linked to an attack early
Saturday morning which police believed was tied to
the other serial rapes.
The attempted rape Saturday in a residential area
in Mountain View — believed to be the 10th assault by
a single rapist — spurred the search for a man who has
been terrorizing women since August. A 15-year-old
girl who was walking alone to a friend's house at 1:30
a.m. was attacked from behind, but by screaming and
fighting back, managed to frighten off her attacker.

The girl's description of the attacker matched pre
vious descriptions of the serial rapist — a muscular
black man in his early 20s. The girl told police she had
seen a white van slowly pass her shortly before she
was attacked.
Later in the morning, at 7:08 a.m., Palo Alto Pa
trol Officer Tom Pohl tried to stop a white van driving
south on El Camino Real near San Antonio Road. But
when the driver "reached his hand out the window
and motioned the officer to go around him and then
suddenly accelerated," Kratzer said, a chase began.
The pursuit finally ended when the van reached a
dead end on Beech Street in East Palo Alto, hit the
curb and crashed into a levee. The driver of the van
fled on foot into the nearby marshes of the Baylands
Nature Preserve. Officers present said he matched
the description of the attacker from earlier that
morning in Mountain View.
Despite a nine-hour search and the use of heli
copters and bloodhounds, police were unable to locate
the man at that point. Because no blood was found
near the van, police did not believe the man had been
injured in the crash, Kratzer said.
Police took the van to the Santa Clara County
