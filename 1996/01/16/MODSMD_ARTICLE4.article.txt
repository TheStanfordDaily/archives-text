# Stanford feeling effects of U.S. budget showdown
## Research funding delayed by government shutdown 
### September Trevi√±o Staff writer 
The federal budget stalemate which prompted two
partial government shutdowns in the past two
months has created setbacks for more than federal
employees.
The shutdown also affects federally funded re
search, stalling the receipt of continuing grant dis
bursements and postponing new research start dates
for many projects on the Stanford campus.
Public grants fund more than half of the Universi
ty's research projects; the Department of Health and
Human Services, NASA and the Department of De
fense are among the University's biggest supporters.
Because of the recent furlough of federal employ
ees which officially ended Jan. 8, several government
agencies were unable to process the necessary paper
work to approve new grants or issue disbursements
for multi-year grants with a December or January
pay cycle.
According to a Jan. 5 article in the Chronicle of
Higher Education, by the end of December, about
2,000 new and continuing awards sponsored by the
National Institutes of Health were
delayed by the shutdown. Similar
ly, the National Science Founda
tion, which funds research in both
biological and behavioral sciences,
estimated that "a few hundred"
new grants totaling about $100 mil
lion had yet to be signed to finalize
payment.
"What Congress, in it.s infinite
wisdom, fails to understand, is (be
hand-to-mouth nature of the world
we're living in," said Assoc. Engi
neering-Economic Systems Prof.
Michael Fehling. "1 have to tell stu
dents, 'I will write you in as a
research assistant, but then the
government says you'll have to wait
to get the money.' "
"This is a disaster," said
Fehling, who is awaiting approval
for new funds on a continuing

research project. "It is destroying
the ability to get the quality of com
mitment to these [research] tasks
that's required to do the kind of
research that has kept the U.S. out
in front."
Hut Dean of Research Charles
Kruger, who recently returned
from Washington, said he "got a
fairly optimistic reading of Capitol
Hill" alter meeting with legislators.
He added that they predicted the
112 unding situation would be resolved
in the "not-so-distant future."
But in the meantime, Victor
Sosa, contract officer fort he School
of I lumanities and Sciences, said no
new awards and very few continu
ing grant disbursements have been
received since the two shutdowns.
He added that despite an official
end to the government furlough
hist week, numbers have yet to pick
up because of the snowstorms in
t he East.
The NSF even sent a letter to the
University warning of a funding

delay. In fact, no NSF awards have
come in since the first government
shutdown in November, said Sosa.
The School of Medicine is facing
similar problems. "Depending upon
where the proposal is in the
approval cycle, (applicants) may not
receive their awards for some
time," said Kathleen Thompson,
grant manager for the Medical
School. Thompson said very few
new or continuing awards have
arrived since the shutdown.
Because there is no way of
knowing which new proposals have
been approved until actual notifica
tion, University administrators
said it is difficult to pinpoint exact
ly how much money is being held in
limbo. Thompson did say however,
that the Medical School usually
receives about 30 awards a month,
each totaling at least $100,000. She
added that the volume of awards
received since the two shutdowns
has dropped sharply.
But Assoc. Dean of Research

Craig 1 leller said it is too early to be
alarmed.
"The review process has defi
nitely been held up," I leller said.
But he added that researchers sun
ply awaiting the annual disburse
ment of a multi-year grant should
not worry. "This delay is not seri
ous for those who have funding
notification. .. . Even though they
are not receiving checks, accounts
can be set up for them."
I le said the University most like
ly will be able to (ill the funding gap
for continuing grants until the fed
eral budget is signed, provided the
stalemate does not persist much
longer.
But for many researchers and
their assistants, the confusion in
Washington translates directly.
New applicants who were expect ing
a December notification must sim
ply wait. In the meantime, research
start dates for some projects must
be pushed back and research assis
tants turned away.
