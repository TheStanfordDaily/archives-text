# Foreign students run into visa difficulties
## 
### September Trevi√±o Staff writer 
Imagine .spending your winter break braving
a three-hour wait in freezing temperatures just
to secure the right to return to school this quar
ter. One student did just that.
In fact, many international students whose
visas expired over break were frustrated as the
second government shutdown crept into Janu
ary. delaying renewal of their student visas and
increasing doubt about a winter quarter return.
"The government shutdown directly affected
their ability to secure the proper visa stamps,"
said Rolando Villalobos, assistant director of
Bechtel International Center. "They had the
necessary paperwork to go to the
consulate, but it was closed."
Villalobos said over break he
received a fax, some e-mail mes
sages and at least a dozen phone
calls from all over the world com
plaining about the inability to
renew visas.
Many international students
even changed their travel plans
for winter break, predicting
renewal problems.
"Most students wouldn't take
the risk," he said.
One international student,
who asked not to be identified,
decided to take the risk and
returned to his home in the
Sichuan province of China for his
wedding.
The student said he was unable
even to set a wedding date in
advance because he had to make
multiple trips to either the
Sichuan capital, a four-hour drive
from his hometown, or Beijing,

nearly 1,000 miles away. Because
the embassy in Beijing is only
open weekdays, he had to leave
Sichuan earlier than he had
intended.
"Every day I called the
embassy," he said. "The problem
was that they didn't know when
they were going to open, so it was
very frustrating for me."
One morning, he went to the
American Embassy in Beijing
where he waited for three hours
in 20-degree weather for the
embassy to open.
"I'm just one example," he
said. "I think [legislators] are
violating our right to study in the
States."
"All of the U.S. embassies
were closed," he said. "You can
imagine what kind of problems
that produced." lit' added that he
is considering writing a letter to
Speaker of the House Newt Gin
grich, R-Ga., to complain.
The student was able to obtain
his visa Jan. 8, and arrived in
San Francisco on Thursday. He
said he and his new wife are plan
ning a proper ceremony later this

year.
But for many international
students, the wait isn't over yet.
Some were still nervous last
week, even after embassies
reopened, concerned that backlog
would contribute to further wait
ing.
"The shutdown has caused
delays and headaches, but I'm
confident that they will get their
visas," Villalobos said, adding
that by the middle of last week
calls to his office had stopped.
Villalobos was most concerned
about those international stu
dents who traveled to countries
other than their home states. He
said they are usually a low prior
ity for visa approval and would
experience even longer delays.
One Spanish student who
intended to begin graduate work
this winter is still stuck in Lon
don after the U.S. consulate
there denied her request. Villalo
bos said the student has since
hired an immigration attorney
and has accepted that red tape
may push her arrival into spring
quarter.
