Editor's note: This is the third installment of an occa
sional series. It is the true story of seven freshmen
picked to live in an all-frosh dorm, Junipero, and
have their lives challenged. Find out what happens
when the small talk ends and people start getting real.
The Real World, Stanford.

No matter how
many times the
topic is brought up,
discussed and com
plained about in ca
sual conversation,
the subject of datinp
never fails to bring a

grimace to everyone's face. That is, there appears to
be an insufficiency of it on campus, according to
rumor. The seven members of the Real World gather
around the dinner table to share their freshman per
spectives on this tainted subject.
When asked if they see much datingon campus, the
crew simultaneously avowed an assertive "No!"
So the main question here is: Why not?
"We're so Isolated here," said Jean 1 )e La Torre. "Espe
cially for those people who don't have cars, there's no
where to go. And it sounds really cheesy to ask someone to
go to Flicks."
Joe Freund, on the other hand, has a different
opinion.
"I think it's female repression," he suggested.
