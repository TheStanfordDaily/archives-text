# Freshmen pine over dearth of dating on Farm
## 
### Jenn Huie Contributing writer 
Editor's note: This is the third installment of an occa
sional series. It is the true story of seven freshmen
picked to live in an all-frosh dorm, Junipero, and
have their lives challenged. Find out what happens
when the small talk ends and people start getting real.
The Real World, Stanford.

No matter how
many times the
topic is brought up,
discussed and com
plained about in ca
sual conversation,
the subject of datinp
never fails to bring a

grimace to everyone's face. That is, there appears to
be an insufficiency of it on campus, according to
rumor. The seven members of the Real World gather
around the dinner table to share their freshman per
spectives on this tainted subject.
When asked if they see much datingon campus, the
crew simultaneously avowed an assertive "No!"
So the main question here is: Why not?
"We're so Isolated here," said Jean 1 )e La Torre. "Espe
cially for those people who don't have cars, there's no
where to go. And it sounds really cheesy to ask someone to
go to Flicks."
Joe Freund, on the other hand, has a different
opinion.
"I think it's female repression," he suggested.

"Most people who come to Stan
ford are really hard workers and
probably haven't had as much
social activity as the average per
son. For example, those people
who went to a private or boarding
school might not have had the
chance to get out much."
Kevin Chen, who attended a
four-year boarding school, took
offense and playfully punched Joe
in the arm.
"Hey, that's stereotyping," he
cautioned.
Joe continued despite his room
mate's warning.
"Then, when a girl gets herself
into a 'situation,' she doesn't
know what to do."
After a little coercing from the
women in the group, Joe accepted
that the same "repression" may
also hold true for males.
"Well, at least it's the guys who
are looking for relationships," Joe
claimed. "Guys are the ones look
ing for girls."
Both Chandra Christenson and
Jean laughed incredulously at
Joe's "naivete." They argued that
it works the other way around
females hunt for male prey. After
only a few months of life on the
Farm, Jean has formed her own
view of college men.
"1 think guys are more interest
ed in getting drunk and just being
a 'guy,' " she said. "They'd rather
bounce around meeting girls than
settling down in a relationship."
In an attempt to defend himself

and the rest of the male popula
tion, Grant Brown stepped in to
voice his opinion.
"That's more of a second choice
for guys," he said. "It's like, if a
guy can't find a girl, then he gets
drunk. It's not a conscious deci
sion either, Guys seem to do what
ever they feel like doing at the
time."
So where on campus do stu
dents go to meet that special some
one? Dorms? Parties? Guess again.
"CIV section!" said Chandra. "I
think it's great to find a guy in
every class."
"And fantasize about him!"
Kevin interrupted.
Chandra's cheeks turn a pale
shade of red as everyone breaks
into laughter. Jean attempts to
rescue her dormmate by giving a
more detailed explanation.
"You see, we're in the same
math class, and there are a lot of
cute guys in there, too," she
admitted reluctantly. "So when
we get bored, we have something
... to observe."
Joe, with his usual discerning
commentary, couldn't resist this
chance to remark on Chandra and
Jean's situation. "See, if guys did
that, it'd be called sexual harass
ment," he said.
Perhaps it's not "where", but
"how." Tasha Dwamena said she
believes that it depends more on
the circumstance, not the place.
"You can meet a guy by bump
ing into him with your bike,"
Tasha remarked.
But everyone knows that it's
not quite that simple.
"Sometimes a girl thinks that
she's sendinir out these reallv

obvious signals, but the guy could
have absolutely no clue," said
Grant. "They could be sending us
these vibes that say, 'I really like
you, come over and talk to me.'
But we just won't get the message.
When it comes to dating and
relationships, men and women
might as well be from opposite
realms of the universe.
"Girls and guys definitely have
very different ideas about the
'ideal date,' " said Joe. "My ideal
girlfriend would have to have
three distinct qualities. One: It
would have to be an open relation
ship. I have to be able to see other
people. I guess she could too. Two:
She has to enjoy doing guy things,
like watching football. And three:
She has to be ... I'm trying to
think of a politically correct way of
saying this."
Joe ponders a moment, choos
ing his words of wisdom wisely.
"Morally challenged!"
A mischievous smile spreads
across his face as he remembers
another criterion for his ideal
woman.
"And she has to have 'abun
dant personalities,' " he said, his
hands gesturing a well-endowed
chest.
Not all agreed with Joe's ideals.
Expectations of the ideal date vary
not only between genders, but also
within them.
"It's hard to name attributes; it
really depends on the person,"
said George Holbert. "Someone
who has a passion about some
thing. Someone you could hang
out with and just do whatever.
And definitely friendship first.
Love at first sight just doesn't

happen.
Kevin described his ideal girl
friend as "nice." Me retracted his
statement and tried again when
his description drew a ridiculing
laughter from the gang.
"She has to be into whips and
chains," he conceded. "And she
has to be good with ropes."
1 lowever, some skeptics believe
that the ideal boyfriend / girl
friend doesn't exist.
"Ideal? I don't think that's pos
sible," said Tasha. "Everyone

wants someone who they re com
fortable with, someone who
makes them laugh. But that's
what I look for in a friend. Rela
tionships should develop from
friendships."
Grant, the only member of the
group tied down to a home-town
honey, disagreed. Speaking from
his own experience, lie shared
one of the benefits of romance
first.
"If two people are friends going
into a relationship, they share the

same group of friends, he said.
"Then you're always hanging out
with the same people. You'll never
be able to be independent and
spend time with your own
friends."
Overall, these freshmen seem to
fit the mold of typical anti-dating
Stanford students. But one ques
tion may never be answered: Did
these freshmen come in with low
romantic expectations or has their
skepticism arisen because they've
entered the semi-real world?

The Real World frosh are not immune from the perils of dating at Stanford, and agree with the stereo
type that it is scarce on campus.
