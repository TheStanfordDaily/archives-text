### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
An all-campus birthday party and an
open house of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Papers Project reminded people of the life
and works of one of America's greatest civil
rights leaders
About 50 people gathered in White Plaza
Friday at noon to hear the Stanford Band blast
out the Beatles' "Birthday" and to eat a slice of
birthday cake.
The Martin Luther King Jr. Commemora
tive Committee wanted to include the entire
campus in the celebration.
"The King holiday became politicized as a
black holiday," said Rose Adams, reference li
brarian coordinator of Multicultural Services.
"We wanted everyone to take part."
Tina Gridiron, assistant director of the
Black Community Services Center, said a di
verse array of depart ment s, students, faculty
and staff participated in the planning.
"King's vision was to bring people togeth
er," Gridiron said. "The planning mirrors his
legacy of unity of community."
People who attended the birthday party ex
pressed pleasure at this recognition ofthe King
holiday.
"My high school in Connecticut doesn't cel
ebrate the holiday," freshman Na'eem Salaam
said. "I'm glad to be here."

celebrate a holiday that doesn t get
enough attention."
Adams stressed the importance
of the King holiday.
"It's not just another day off,"she
said. "The holiday is named after a
person, not an icon."
Sophomore Anndretta Lyle, co
chair of the committee, said she hopes
to invite performing groups next year.
"We want to represent the diver
sity of communities, with groups
such as Taiko or Ballet Folklorico,"
Lyle said.
Festivities continued later that

afternoon with an open house of the
Martin Luther King Jr. Pa{x>rs Pro
ject. The Papers Project is placing
King's works into 13 volumes and
into a computer database.
Letters from King, posters of
black political groups and other
memorabilia were displayed on the
walls. Visitors also had the opportu
nity to see the research room where
the King files are housed.
History Prof. Clayborne Carson,
the senior editor of the project, said
the open house showed the special
relationship Stanford hits to King.
"The project allows us to have a
special role, to keep the legacy alive,"
he said.
Carson emphasized the impor
tance of student involvement in the

project.
"We couldn't do the project with
out the students," he said. "Their
research often results in the publica
tion of their work."
Senior Michelle Scott, a history
major, described her experiences
working with the project since her
freshman year.
"At first I learned general
databasing," she said. "Now I'm
writing footnotes and headnotes to
King's sermons and speeches."
The Papers Project is important
because King's message bears great
relevance to the Issues of today, Car
son said.
"His agenda is unfinished," he
said. "People net>d to look at the cre
ative use of nonviolence."
