Deadline Reminder!
We are presently accepting applications for
The Minority Summer Research Exchange Program
The mission of this program is to provide motivated undergraduates with
a special opportunity to acquire or improve research and analytical skills in
their chosen field. During the eight-week residential program, students
perform research involving substantive work under faculty mentorship
and participate in other enrichment activities such as seminars, workshops,
and group tours. Such experience will more easily facilitate preparation for
graduate school admission and advanced degree attainment for faculty and
research careers.
This consortial program, which is funded by the Mellon and Ford
Foundations and participating institutions, is conducted in cooperation
with Cornell, Princeton, UC Berkeley, UCI.A, and Yale campuses,
between mid-June and mid-August. Travel funds and stipend included.
Current sophomore and junior African-American, American-Indian,
Mexican-American and Puerto-Rican students who are U.S. citizens with a
2.8 minimum GPA are invited to apply.
Interested students should contact Geneva Lopez at 725-2536 or
Kathrine Montoya at 725-6641, or pick up an application at the following
locations: Undergraduate Advising Center, CPPC, El Centro, Theme I louses,
American Indian Program Office, Black Community Services Center,
