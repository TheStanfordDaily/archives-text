Communication 001, 21 1,301
"Mass Communication & Society"
MW 2:15-3:45
Terman Auditorium
Old and new media technologies are converging. A new digital world combines
traditional print, television, and film with computers, telephones, and communication
networks to form a collection of products and services that significantly influence all
aspects of personal and community life. Communication 01 will examine the
technologies and industries that make up the new world of "digital convergence," and
we will examine their effects on psychological life, on industry, and on communities
local and global.
In addition to demonstrations and critiques of a wide range of communication
products and services, the class will cover theory and research on a wide range of
communication topics.
Pre-registration not required.
