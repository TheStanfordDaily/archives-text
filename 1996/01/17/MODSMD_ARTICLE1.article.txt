## Feminist author shares insights 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Addressing an audience that packed Memorial Auditorium
last night, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker spoke
out against female genital mutilation.
Walker — brought to Stanford by the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau — read from her book, "Possessing the Secret of Joy,'' de
scribing how the character Tashi makes the "ignorant decision
to be mutilated out of her own wish."
Walker said she realized it is hard to imagine that there are
places in the world where people don't know about the practice.
When questioned about the need to be sensitive to mutila
tion as an aspect of culture. Walker responded that she believed
it is good that people are taught to be tolerant to others' ways,
but that it is important never to takeone's attention away from
the fact that a child is suffering.
"Torture is actually torture," said Walker. "There is no get
ting away from it. We have a right as humans to stand up for

anybody who is suffering."
Reading the last phrases of "Possessing the Secret of Joy,"
Walker had tears in her eyes. "Resistance is the secret of joy,"
the sentence read.
Walker commented 011 how she found it hard to reconcile
this belief in resistance with her recent study of Buddhist
thought.
"There, resistance is the cause of the problem," Walker said.
"1 am unable to see how, when the victim is a child and the cul
ture is in cahoots to damage this child, how there can not be re
sistance."
Walker also discussed public reaction to the film adaptation
of her best-known work, "The Color Purple," which won the
Pulitzer Prize for firt ion in 1983.
"1 was trashed by people who felt the film was demeaning
black men and that 1 hate them," Walker said. "That was ter
rible slander. The issue goes right to the heart if you are ac-

cused of hating people.'
Walker also read a scene in
which the character Tashi
receives a female clay doll which is
fingering its genitalia. Walker
explained that the rare dolls were
taboo and that Tashi had been
reprimanded when she looked at
it.
While telling the anecdote she
emphasized the importance of
keeping cherished things fresh.
"It is crucial to hold onto things

that are precious," said Walker.
"Take Bob Marley, who has got
ten this society through so many
hard times — he has been diluted
and commercialized.
"We can defeat this process
and keep expression rare and pre
cious — you put things away for a
long time voluntarily, then take it
out and it is fresh."
After reading from "Warrior
Marks," her documentary
account of female genital mutila
tion, Walker said finishing the
book left her in a state of particu
lar exhaustion. "I felt I had lost
my innocence and optimism — I
needed solitude," said Walker.

She took a year off, and it was
during this resting period that her
latest book — "The Same River
Twice: Honoring the Difficult "
was born. Today, Walker begins a
tour to promote the book, which
describes the filming of "The
Color Purple."
Walker explained that the title
refers to the difficulty in making
a Hollywood movie. "It is about
the integrity and the pain of col
laboration," Walker said.
"Things are still difficult it is
like being on a razor's edge
writers are solitary people, and
the challenge is to learn to work
with others."
