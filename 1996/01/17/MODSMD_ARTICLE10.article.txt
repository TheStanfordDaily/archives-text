Abused wife spared death penalty
SPRINGFIELD, 111. (AP) — An abused wife who
had demanded she be put to death for killing her
husband was spared yesterday by Gov. Jim Edgar
hours before she was to become the second woman
executed in the United States in at least 20 years.
Guinevere Garcia apparently had had a change
of heart: "Thank God that this has happened,"
her lawyer quoted her as saying after Edgar com
muted her death sentence to life in prison with no
chance of parole.
Garcia, 37, was to have been executed shortly
after midnight for shooting her husband during
an argument that grew from a botched robbery.
Death-penalty opponents, including Bianca
Jagger, had campaigned for clemency over Gar
cia's objections, arguing that she had a harrowing
life that included alcoholism and sexual abuse in
childhood and prostitution as a teen-ager.

Edgar, a Republican who hadn't overturned a
death sentence in five years in office, said the facts
of Garcia's crime didn't justify her execution. He
cited evidence that she apparently didn't plan to
kill her husband.
Forget apples, we want fries!
WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans are eating
four times as much Mexican food and three times
as much popcorn and pretzels as they did two
decades ago. We arc managing to eat less fat, but
putting on the pounds anyway.
An Agriculture Department survey of 5,500
Americans in 1994 found that half ate no fruit on
a given day. They readily passed up dark green
and deep yellow vegetables, despite official advice
to eat more. One in three adults was overweight.
Children were getting off to a sweet start, switch
ing from milk to soft drinks or apple-based juices.
