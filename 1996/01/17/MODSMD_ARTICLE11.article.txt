PERVOMAYSKAYA, Russia
(AP) — The Chechen guerrilla war
flared outside Russia's borders for
the first time yesterday, with gun
men seizing more than 100 people
aboard a Turkish ferry. Their
hostage-holding comrades battled
Russia's best troops in a burned
out village filled with dead.
Chechen gunmen clung to their
positions as Russian tanks and
helicopter gunships assailed Per
vomayskaya for a second day.
Despite salvo after salvo of mis
siles and artillery fire, they refused
to release dozens of hostages.
Tank rounds slammed across
frozen fields and rockets from heli
copter gunships exploded in the
burning remains of the village as
black columns of smoke rose in the
winter sk\\

At least 100 people had been
killed and injured in the fighting.
It was not known if any hostages
were among the dead.
Maj. Gen. Alexander Mikhailov,
a spokesman for the Federal Secu
rity Service, claimed the rebels had
suffered terrible losses. "We're not
counting them in terms of corpses
— we're counting them in terms of
arms and legs."
Russian jets rocketed a convoy
of guerrilla reinforcements trying
to reach Pervomayskaya, leaving
about 150 rebels dead, according
to Yevgeny Ryabtsev, an Interior
Ministry spokesman. There was
no independent confirmation of
the reported clash 12 miles south
east of the village.
Hundreds of miles away,
masked gunmen seized a ferry in

Trabzon, Turkey, yesterday and
threatened to kill all the Russians
on board, the semiofficial Anatolia
news agency said. The gunmen
shouted slogans demanding inde
pendence for Chechnya, then set
sail for an unknown destination,
reportedly with 165 people on
board. It was not known how
many were Russian; the ferry was
scheduled to have gone to the Rus
sian city of Sochi.
Chechens have turned to
hostage-taking as they fight for
independence from Moscow. In
Pervomayskaya, a village in the
southern Russian republic of
Dagestan on the border with
Chechnya, they were believed to
be holding between 70 and 120
hostages before the Russian
assault began Monday morning.
