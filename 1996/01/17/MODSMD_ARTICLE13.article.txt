## Editorials The 						power outage 
### 
POWER OUTAGES ARE
rarely welcome events. And
when they strike at poten
tially disruptive times — such as
the end of last quarter — they can
lead to severe problems.
When strong storms left sever
al houses along the Row in the
dark last month during the most
frantic time of the quarter —
finals week — Stanford adminis
trators were ready to respond.
With so many other things on
their mind, the last thing stu
dents needed was to worry about
basic commodities like heat or
food.
Thanks to the University, they
didn't have to.
Stanford's response was fast
and effective. Flashlights and
blankets were quickly distributed
to students in affected residences,
and Row houses with power were
opened to students in need of a

lighted (and warm) place to study
The University even left mat
tresses in the lounges of some res
idences in case students preferred
to sleep there instead of in their
unheated residences.
University officials also recog
nized and acted on less obvious
problems. For example, they col
lected food from the refrigerators
and freezers of affected houses,
storing it elsewhere to avoid
spoilage. In addition, affected
Row residents were offered free
meals at University dining halls
In short, the University, which
was not at fault for the outages,
did the best job it could possibly
do considering the magnitude and
poor timing of the situation. Dis
ruption of students' lives —
although still significant — was
minimized as much as possible.
Kudos to Stanford for a job well
done.
