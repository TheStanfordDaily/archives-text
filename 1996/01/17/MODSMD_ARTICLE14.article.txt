# Selecting speakers
## 
### 
Traditionally, the Uni
versity has limited its choice
of Commencement speakers
to candidates with formal Stanford
affiliations. Last year, for instance,
the University selected U.S. Secre
tary of Defense William Ferry, an
engineering-economic systems
professor currently on leave
because of his duties in Washing
ton, D.C.
Considering the caliber of such
speakers, it is admittedly difficult
to argue that restricting the choice
of speakers to Stanford-affiliated
persons diminishes the Universi
ty's ability to procure individuals
worthy of delivering the Com
mencement address. But even so,
the current process of selection
raises some worries.
First and foremost, Stanford
has long prided itself for combat
ing elitist practices. Unfortunately,
the method by which the Universi
ty searches for its Commencement
speaker itself appears exclusion
ary. Why not invite figures outside

the Stanford community to speak
at Commencement, so long as they
are influential members of society
who will offer important insight?
The most important quality of a
Commencement speaker should be
his or her ability to provide wis
dom and inspiration, not whether
he or she can claim any formal ties
with Stanford. It is tragic that the
University places more signifi
cance on a person's institutional
affiliations than on what a person
has to say.
Second, senior class presidents,
who advise the University on pos
sible choices, have not yet actively
solicited input from seniors on a
sufficiently large scale. Senior
class presidents must reach out to
the entire graduating class and ask
for suggestions through such
means as e-mail and fliers.
A little more searching within
the graduating class and outside
the Stanford community could go
a long way in terms of finding a
good Commencement speaker.
