## Good jobs at Stanford ? 
### 
THIS ONE'S FOR all the under
privileged. Having decided to look
for a job, I recently scouted all the
places that typically employ students.
Green Library was my first stop. As I
approached the face of glass that is its
entryway, a thought struck. I don't know
where it came from; it certainly didn't
come from me. It must have been a cos
mically free-floating thought.
The glass was, luckily, resistant. I
claimed ownership of the thought and
mentally examined it. It suggested I turn
around immediately and look elsewhere
— advice unheeded. Hut I did not imme
diately ask for a job. I initially perused
the environs of Cecil's place.
Going toward the reference section, I
took a quick left after seeing the wan
death masks of the librarians at the ref
erence counter. I did not want to deal
with their blend of surliness and disori
entation, not to mention their firm habit
of offering solutions which seemingly
incorporate high information technology
hut actually involve only obscure FOR
TRAN programming skills (I think this
is why the libraries have been automat
ing so slowly — FORTRAN is too dusty).
I lurched down the stairs and faced
the map at the bottom. Ripping my eyes
from it, I decided to follow my own intu
itive direction. Where did I go? Of course,
to the South Stacks. It always gives me
faintly pleasurable memories about the
can: walking through cages to a place
where sexual practices undisclosed in

normal society become revered and com
pulsory habits.
After winding in unknown directions
through the stacks and pools of
unknown liquid, I found a tall, dark man
sitting at an obscure carrel. He looked
Russian. He said, without prompting,
that he was working on translating the
Talmud into Arabic and the Koran into
Korean. I realized this man was no
Solzhenitsyn. I figured that if I wanted
to work in a library, I might as well do so
at Hoover, where Alex and other respect
ed men spend their time. Plus, their win
dowless chambers are many stories
above ground and quite restricted to the
populace — a perfect breeding ground
for bizarre activities.
I went to the Co Ho, thinking that I
could work at a place that might be
socially rewarding. Though the starting
pay was less, non-monetary benefits had
to abound. I could meet plenty of nice
people. Though worried that I did not
have enough black clothes or would have
a conflict with the management about
checking IDs, I found that the main
problem was the selection of hours open
for a worker. Friday evenings. Tuesday
and Thursday mornings. Saturday
evenings. Next place.
Across White Plaza. Ever since my
freshman year, I have been curious
about the Bookstore's student spies.
Though everyone I knew who has done
this job has eventually gone nuts, they
have also become part of the black-mar

ket network of Bookstore thieves (what
do you think the book guy used to do, or
where he gets his stock?), a much more
lucrative job than spy. I'm already nuts
and thought I could just work as a spy
for a bit to learn the trade before I
turned coat, so the Bookstore was look
ing like a good possibility.
But when I went in and acted like a
spy, 1 became too engrossed in the maga
zines. I had spent about two hours in
front of the rack reading dozens of rags,
not even noticing the slick guy next to
me hiding all the copies of Mac World
under his trench coat. And I was eventu
ally accosted bv a real (well, pay rolled)
spy and accused of theft. An outrageous
charge, but not as outrageous as her fail
ure to give me a direct link to the thiev
ery gang.
Instead, I am running some
entrepreneurial businesses. Need a
usurer? Call me. Rates begin at 25 per
cent. 1-900 lines. Buying and reselling
real estate (I learned this from a pro
gram I bought from Leonard Brooks
after watching a great infomercial).
Endangered species trade. Lethal
enforcement and modern soldiery. Mon
kev hustling. Pimping. . . .

Eating endangered species is quite a
perk.
