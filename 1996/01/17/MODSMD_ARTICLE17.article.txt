Wolf clarifies his accusations against students

GIVEN THE ENORMOUS res
ponse to my letter in the Jan. 12
issue of The Daily, I must have
hit a nerve in the Stanford community.
Judging from the feedback of (most)
fellow teaching assistants, various pro
fessors and staff, I do not stand alone
in my opinion that Stanford students
are often irresponsible and expect spe
cial treatment. Naturally, there are
others who disagree. Please allow me to
address some points in the two respons
es printed yesterday.
1. I never criticized the undergradu
ate population as a whole. This should

be clear from phrases like "don't
always live up to the outstanding repu
tation" and "Why is it that some Stan
ford students. ..." The headline "Stan
ford students sure are spoiled," imply
ing maybe that "all Stanford students
sure are spoiled," was chosen by The
Daily, not me. Jan Leu is therefore
wrong in charging me with "using a few
misapprehended anecdotes as illustra
tions of the supposedly spoiled nature
of Stanford undergrads."
2. I am well aware of the "frantically
busy schedule of most undergradu
ates," as Leu put it. However, most

graduate students don't have a very
idle schedule either. Some masters stu
dents whom I have TAed have had full
time jobs on the side. So why is it that
the share of inappropriate requests —
both in my experience and others — is
so much higher on the undergraduate
side?
3. I commend Bill Shen for almost
single-handedly bringing Jesse Jackson
to our campus. Had he informed us in
advance of this, we surely we would
have given him special consideration
(as we gave more than 10 other stu
dents who could not make it to the

midterm for valid reasons). However, it
is not appropriate to show up late after
the fact. To give a related example:
Imagine you have a job interview, but
can't make it on time due to a flat tire
on the way. I think most people in that
situation would have the common sense
to make a phone call and excuse them
selves ahead of time for being late. I am
in the dark as to why Leu accuses me of
not having noticed Bill Shen's task (and
of hypocrisy). Am I supposed to have
taken a course in mind reading?
