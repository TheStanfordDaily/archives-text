# Law students buck trend of reduced community service
## 
### 
I write in response to recent stories
published in The Daily about the inter
est of Stanford students in public-inter
est work (Jan. 10, "Student attitudes
are changing;" Jan. 10, "UCLA study
of frosh finds decline in political inter
est;" Jan. 9, Timothy Stanton's letter

challenging the results of the poll, stat
ing that Stanford students lack public
interest because the poll included 51
percent graduate students).
I am proud to report that Stanford
law students are an exception to what
may be a national trend — our students
are becoming increasingly involved in
public-interest work.
Last summer, 98 first- and second
year law students obtained public-inter
est summer employment — up from 65
the year before. About 80 law students
currently work for the East Palo Alto

Community Law Project, helping resi
dents with housing, environmental,
economic, educational and familial
problems and issues. Additionally, this
fall saw the beginning of a public inter
est externship program, where over 35
students assist numerous public inter
est and government agencies in their
work.
Additionally, dozens of students par
ticipate in additional independent pub
lic-interest activities during the school
year. Furthermore, many law students
also provide service to the Law School

community through involvement in law
journals, student groups and student
government.
The experience of the Law School
demonstrates that multifaceted admin
istrative support facilitates and
expands law-student involvement in
public-interest work. The Law School
recognizes the importance of communi
ty service for a law student's education
al, professional and moral development.
