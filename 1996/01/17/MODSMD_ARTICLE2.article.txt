# CPPC on-line security can be breached easily

### Adam Kemezis Contributing writer 
students who register with the Career
Planning and Placement Center may be giv
ing personal information to more people
than they think, due to a glitch in the CPPC 's
network security.
Although the security issue is resolved
when files are cleared each day, the personal
files of a student registering for interview
bids are open for several hours to anyone who
knows where to look.
Since the beginning of last quarter, stu
dents looking for jobs have been able to regis
ter for the CPPC's On-Campus Recruiting
Program using the World Wide Web.
Students using the system access the
CPPC's web page and fill in a form that asks

(or basic personal information, including so
cial security numbers, as well as details of
academic, extracurricular and workplace ex
perience.
This information is then stored in a file on
the network which is temporarily accessible
to anyone who has a Leland account and
knows the name of the file and directory.
The person who has accessed the account
can then read and change information in
cluded in the file. A list of those registration
forms filled out in any given day is offered to
whoever logs in.
Lance Choy, assistant director of the
CPPC, said he was unaware of the problem
but would try to correct it immediately.
Despite the few hours when a file is acces-
sible, information is cleared every
day at 4 p.m., removing the file in
question from the network, Choy
said. After the day information is
submitted, it is secure.
Choy said the CPPC realized
last quarter that files for register
ing for bids had been incorrectly set
up. The solution to the earlier secu
rity problem appeared to be the
simple matter of changing the
access privileges of the file so that
only the CPPC could read it, he
said. CPPC staff members are sup
posed to be the only people with
access to a file.

But Choy said files are now list
ed as available only to the CPPC'
;dthough the information Ls avail
able to effectively the entire cam
pus.
Although he offered no ideas for
an immediate solution, Choy said, a
computer error is likely the cause.
Students coming out of the
CPPC building were surprised to
learn about the security lapse.
While some students were upset
over the lack of security, most
assumed that because no one knew
about the flaw in the system, no
harm would come of it.
Graduate student Steve Fong
said, "it doesn't really matter."
Brendan Harrington, another
graduate student, planned to take
extra precautions. "I have to check

mine out to see if it's still cool, he
said.
However, Choy confirmed that
there is no way for a student to
access his or her file once it is off
the network and suggested that
concerned students "could re-sub
mit" the registration to ensure
accuracy.
He also stressed that, while the
lapse in security is not acceptable,
the actual danger is extremely
slight.
"I don't know who would [mis
use the information)." he said, "I
don't think it's a big thing. I don't
think people are malicious."
Coterminal student Evan Shin
was among those who agreed that
misuse was unlikely, asking sim
ply, "Who would do that?"
