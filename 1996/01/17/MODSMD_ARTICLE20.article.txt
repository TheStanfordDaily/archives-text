## Outclassed by cable — too much on TV? 
### 
SO I HAD myself a windfall weekend
at the end of winter break. A torrent
of white stuff left me and several
thousand tri-state others stuck where we
stood and I had to find something to occu
py those two days of snowtime until Delta
felt emotionally fit to bring me back to
school.
So I decided to treat myself by conse
crating those bonus blizzard days to an
activity that once comprised my whole life.
I resolved to regress some and entertain
myself by doing what I'd done throughout
my entire pre-college life.
I watched cable.
Now you have to understand, I was
once frighteningly good at watching TV. I
knew what was on at any point in time on
any one of the 35 or so existing channels.
Ix'd by the mantra "There is always some
thing on TV," I could sit and sit and sit
and run the channels for days on end. And
I did.
Name a program, any program, and I'd
swiftly tell you what time it was on, on
what channel and, generally, if it'd be a re
run this week. I knew every network by
name and number and major sponsor. It
was almost balletic; yes, I was the Barysh
nikov of basic cable.
It's true. As a youngster, cable was my
source of power. Sitt ing on the couch wit h
a remote in one hand and chocolate milk

in the other, I was in control. Because I
ruled that video-world with my supreme
and infallible knowledge of what comes
next. I was the surfer's soothsayer and I
knew no equal: I could ascertain the value
of any program before it even appeared; I
knew what w;us best to watch at any given
moment; I was the Chosen One of pre
cable prophecy.
This went on for years. Until I came
here, actually.
And so, during my bonus break, I
thought that maybe I'd make myself a
mug of Nestle's, sit back down on the
couch, grab the remote and reclaim my
glorious title.
Only when I did sit down, fully pre
pared to reign anew, I found that some
thing had happened in my undergraduate
interim something both wonderful and
terribly frightening.
Cable had expanded.
Tremendously. Where there were once
35 channels, there are now some 70.
Where I could once keep tabs on all that
went on in that mystic cablerific realm,
there is now — gulp — too much to man
age
Comedy Central with its sultry calls of
"The Kids in the Hall," "I)r. Katz," and
MST3K; "Ancient Warriors" on The
Learning Channel teaches me the Kung
Fu techniques of the monks of Shoalin,

China; "The Secret Life of Machines"
explains in layman's terms the technology
of the fax machine; The Cartoon Network
tweaks a nostalgic nerve by wooing my
memories of Hanna-Barbera bliss; on
some station 1 never even heard of doctors
performed a mesmerizing vasectomy
reversal. .. and on and on and on.
I began to think, "Could it be that there
are actually too many channels? Too many
for mortals to manage? Has it truly come
to the point where if stations didn't place a
translucent icon in the bottom right cor
ner of the screen, I simply wouldn't know
what channel I was on?
"Starrnan" on Bravo; "Barbarclla" on
TNT; Beavis on MTV; "The Getaway"
(where Kim Basinger reveals her breasts
for the first time) on Showtime; "Is the
Shroud of Turin real?" on Lifetime; 100
different talk shows on 100 different chan
nels, and, if you happened to miss any of
them, a mockery of their highlights can be
caught on El's tasty "Talk Soup". . . .
How can I deny the truth? I have been
outclassed by cable — thoroughly shamed
in my once field of expertise.
I couldn't even run to the bathroom for
fear of missing something essential. It was
a perfect programming blitzkrieg with no
end (but infomercials) in sight. What to
watch? When everything is worthwhile,
what takes priority? Yes, flipping channels

in today's cable world is a constant
"Sophie's Choice" of amusement.
Because the gods of visual stimulus
have pandered to our technopassivity so
brilliantly that there is a channel for every
facet of one's personality. Every subinter
est you have has a station competing for
your attention.
In my TV prime I never knew from
such dilemmas. The worst it ever got back
then was conflicting "M*A*S*H" episodes
on TBS and SBK. (The choice was easy:
Just go with the earlier episode and rest
easy, for you have chosen wisely.)
But now Patrick Stewart narrates
A&E's documentary on Jupiter while
simultaneously on The Discovery Channel
James Earl Jones lectures on the migra
tion of wildebeests in the Serengetti.
Which?
Do I watch Adam West as "Batman" on
F/X or do 1 turn to "Batman the Animated
Series" on FOX? Do I let Clarissa explain
it all on Nickelodeon or do I hold fast on
VHl's "Fashion 'I'V" to see if the camera
man slips and lets me see Iman's nipple
again?
"Inside the NFL" cuts into "I Love
Lucy" and "Bewitched" shares a slot with
"Birdman" and "Space Ghost" humps
into "Star Trek" and everything conflicts
with "Cheers". And all this is without the
sports and news and videos and infomer

cials that keep time with eternity.
Even my cooking show fetish is utterly
boggled by the selections. A late-seventies
Julia Childs (back before her hump was
noticeable on camera) poaches halibut on
The TV Food Network while one of the
"Great Chefs of the East" prepares a
flourless chocolate cake with caramel
sauce on PBS. As if we were courting in a
Jane Austen novel, "The Frugal
Gourmet" must compete with Pasquale
and Yan and Emiril for my affections. One
brings me candy, another chocolate,
another wine, another pasta.
How is a girl to choose?
Alas, I know defeat. The options have
become too great for TV to give me any
sense of power or security. Gone are the
days when I knew what I wanted to see
when — welcome the era of entertainment
overload.
For I am not meant to control the tele
vised world as a viewer any longer. My
time is no longer infinite and my mind,
(un)fortunately, has found things of inter
est outside the blessed box.
Now it seems I am far better off re
reading Hobbes' "Leviathan" than watch
ing Hanks' "Bachelor Party."
Okay, well maybe not if it's uncut on
HBO — none of that edited-down USA
"Up All Night" crap.

on TBS and SBK. (The choice was easy:
Just go with the earlier episode and rest
easy, for you have chosen wisely.)
But now Patrick Stewart narrates
A&E's documentary on Jupiter while
simultaneously on The Discovery Channel
James Earl Jones lectures on the migra
tion of wildebeests in the Serengetti.
Which?
Do I watch Adam West as "Batman" on
F/X or do 1 turn to "Batman the Animated
Series" on FOX? Do I let Clarissa explain
it all on Nickelodeon or do I hold fast on
VHl's "Fashion 'I'V" to see if the camera
man slips and lets me see Iman's nipple
again?
"Inside the NFL" cuts into "I Love
Lucy" and "Bewitched" shares a slot with
"Birdman" and "Space Ghost" humps
into "Star Trek" and everything conflicts
with "Cheers". And all this is without the
sports and news and videos and infomer

cials that keep time with eternity.
Even my cooking show fetish is utterly
boggled by the selections. A late-seventies
Julia Childs (back before her hump was
noticeable on camera) poaches halibut on
The TV Food Network while one of the
"Great Chefs of the East" prepares a
flourless chocolate cake with caramel
sauce on PBS. As if we were courting in a
Jane Austen novel, "The Frugal
Gourmet" must compete with Pasquale
and Yan and Emiril for my affections. One
brings me candy, another chocolate,
another wine, another pasta.
How is a girl to choose?
Alas, I know defeat. The options have
become too great for TV to give me any
sense of power or security. Gone are the
days when I knew what I wanted to see
when — welcome the era of entertainment
overload.
For I am not meant to control the tele
vised world as a viewer any longer. My
time is no longer infinite and my mind,
(un)fortunately, has found things of inter
est outside the blessed box.
Now it seems I am far better off re
reading Hobbes' "Leviathan" than watch
ing Hanks' "Bachelor Party."
Okay, well maybe not if it's uncut on
HBO — none of that edited-down USA
"Up All Night" crap.

SO I HAD myself a windfall weekend
at the end of winter break. A torrent
of white stuff left me and several
thousand tri-state others stuck where we
stood and I had to find something to occu
py those two days of snowtime until Delta
felt emotionally fit to bring me back to
school.
So I decided to treat myself by conse
crating those bonus blizzard days to an
activity that once comprised my whole life.
I resolved to regress some and entertain
myself by doing what I'd done throughout
my entire pre-college life.
I watched cable.
Now you have to understand, I was
once frighteningly good at watching TV. I
knew what was on at any point in time on
any one of the 35 or so existing channels.
Ix'd by the mantra "There is always some
thing on TV," I could sit and sit and sit
and run the channels for days on end. And
I did.
Name a program, any program, and I'd
swiftly tell you what time it was on, on
what channel and, generally, if it'd be a re
run this week. I knew every network by
name and number and major sponsor. It
was almost balletic; yes, I was the Barysh
nikov of basic cable.
It's true. As a youngster, cable was my
source of power. Sitt ing on the couch wit h
a remote in one hand and chocolate milk

in the other, I was in control. Because I
ruled that video-world with my supreme
and infallible knowledge of what comes
next. I was the surfer's soothsayer and I
knew no equal: I could ascertain the value
of any program before it even appeared; I
knew what w;us best to watch at any given
moment; I was the Chosen One of pre
cable prophecy.
This went on for years. Until I came
here, actually.
And so, during my bonus break, I
thought that maybe I'd make myself a
mug of Nestle's, sit back down on the
couch, grab the remote and reclaim my
glorious title.
Only when I did sit down, fully pre
pared to reign anew, I found that some
thing had happened in my undergraduate
interim something both wonderful and
terribly frightening.
Cable had expanded.
Tremendously. Where there were once
35 channels, there are now some 70.
Where I could once keep tabs on all that
went on in that mystic cablerific realm,
there is now — gulp — too much to man
age
Comedy Central with its sultry calls of
"The Kids in the Hall," "I)r. Katz," and
MST3K; "Ancient Warriors" on The
Learning Channel teaches me the Kung
Fu techniques of the monks of Shoalin,

China; "The Secret Life of Machines"
explains in layman's terms the technology
of the fax machine; The Cartoon Network
tweaks a nostalgic nerve by wooing my
memories of Hanna-Barbera bliss; on
some station 1 never even heard of doctors
performed a mesmerizing vasectomy
reversal. .. and on and on and on.
I began to think, "Could it be that there
are actually too many channels? Too many
for mortals to manage? Has it truly come
to the point where if stations didn't place a
translucent icon in the bottom right cor
ner of the screen, I simply wouldn't know
what channel I was on?
"Starrnan" on Bravo; "Barbarclla" on
TNT; Beavis on MTV; "The Getaway"
(where Kim Basinger reveals her breasts
for the first time) on Showtime; "Is the
Shroud of Turin real?" on Lifetime; 100
different talk shows on 100 different chan
nels, and, if you happened to miss any of
them, a mockery of their highlights can be
caught on El's tasty "Talk Soup". . . .
How can I deny the truth? I have been
outclassed by cable — thoroughly shamed
in my once field of expertise.
I couldn't even run to the bathroom for
fear of missing something essential. It was
a perfect programming blitzkrieg with no
end (but infomercials) in sight. What to
watch? When everything is worthwhile,
what takes priority? Yes, flipping channels

in today's cable world is a constant
"Sophie's Choice" of amusement.
Because the gods of visual stimulus
have pandered to our technopassivity so
brilliantly that there is a channel for every
facet of one's personality. Every subinter
est you have has a station competing for
your attention.
In my TV prime I never knew from
such dilemmas. The worst it ever got back
then was conflicting "M*A*S*H" episodes
on TBS and SBK. (The choice was easy:
Just go with the earlier episode and rest
easy, for you have chosen wisely.)
