## Custom-fit vaccine: taking a shot at lymphoma 
### Alison Davis Contributing writer 
Cancer is one of the leading killers of humankind— the out-of-con
trol multiplication of what were once normal cells in the body. Only a
very few types of cancers are curable, and most available cancer ther-

apies have only a limited effectiveness.

Most standard chemotherapeutic regimens operate by one
simple principle — kill all dividing cells, with the hope that can
cer cells will be the main targets, since they divide very quickly
compared to most cells in the body. Since they are relatively
non-specific, they can and do exhibit debilitating and toxic side
effects.
Fortunately, a new era of cancer therapy — biological
immunotherapy — is on the horizon. One of the pioneers in this
field is Oncology Prof. Ron Levy. In collaboration with Prof. Ed

Kngleman of the Pathology Department, Levy is currently eval
uating a novel approach to cancer vaccines, which is gaining
nation-wide attention.

The research team, led by Levy and Kngleman, just published
its preliminary — and very promising — results of an exciting
new vaccine they have developed to treat patients with a certain
variety of immune system cancer, known as non-Hodgkin's

lymphoma.
In contrast to traditional chemotherapy, biological
immunotherapy uses the body's own immune system to attack
tumor cells. The beauty of this avenue of therapy is the amaz

ingly low to non-existent toxicity.
The aim of any vaccine, cancer or otherwise, is to teach
the immune system to specifically recognize a target antigen
for destruction. Antigens are foreign substances that trigger an
immune response — usually proteins on the surface of cells.

Vaccines for other diseases, such as polio, art' in theory easier to
design, since the antigen is vastly different than any normal protein

in the body. Designing a cancer vaccine is much trickier, since differ
ences between normal proteins and cancer cell proteins are often

minute.
The trick is to successfully "emphasize the differences," said Dr. Frank
Hsu, an oncology fellow in Levy's lab and lead author of the study, which
appears in the January issue of Nature Medicine.
Another hurdle is getting the vaccine to the right address a site where
the immune system can recognize it. The new vaccine is inherently differ-

ent from previous vaccines. It is composed of two parts, the tumor antigen and dendritic cells

a special type of cell that's especially good at presenting a target to the immune sys
. tem, Levy said.

Representing less than 1 percent of all white blood cells, dendritic cells are rare.
They serve as an immune 'delivery truck' — carrying antigens to the immune sys
tem. "As a delivery system, dendritic cells are one of the most potent," Hsu said.

The procedure begins by taking a sample, or biopsy, of the patient's lymphoma,
and painstakingly identifying the tumor antigen. Then, the protein is manufactured in

large quantities in culture, a process that collectively takes several months,
according to Hsu.
Once the antigen is ready, the patient undergoes leukaphoresis, or sort
ing of white cells from the blood. From there, the cells are further sorted, sepa
rating the dendritic population from the rest, through a process perfected by

Kngleman

At that point, the dendritic cells are first mixed with
large quantities of the tumor protein and then injected back
into the patient. This takes only a few days. "Both the protein
and the cells must be from the patient. It's really a custom
job," said Levy.

One essential discovery of the team was that this mixing

step had to be done while the dendritic cells were still maturing, or
differentiating, said Levy. This assures that the dendritic cells are

correctly primed, or specialized, so that they will be most effective at
stimulating an immune cancer-killing response in the patient.

For a cancer vaccine, that is the paramount issue — generating a

robust immune response. With previous vaccines, some patients just
never developed an immune response, according to Hsu.

"The difference with this [dendritic vaccinel is the consistency of
producing an immune response," said Hsu. "In the current

trial, we've gotten a strong immune response in every
patient." And that's accompanied by tumor shrinkage —
one patient has been in remission for over two years,

he continued.
The bottom line is that this treatment is not toxic and is

effective for this incurable form of cancer. However, despite
the promise of the new vaccine therapy, both Hsu and Levy

* regretfully emphasize that they are not accepting any more
patients for the trial, due to the overwhelming number already

waiting for treatment.
Although work is currently under way to speed up the cus-

tomization procedure, the inherent nature of the process is a major
hurdle to the development of a readily available vaccine.
