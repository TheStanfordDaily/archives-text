Why is lactose intoler
ance such a big deal /
A You may have noticed
• recently the increasing
• numbers of lactose diges
tive aids appearing at your local
grocery store. Yes, now everyone
can enjoy the wholesome good
ness of lactose-containing prod
ucts without fear.
No longer do you have to be
the only one who can't have a
milk-mustache. No longer do you
have to eat your ()reo cookies (see
Nov. 15 Science Bug article) or
cereal dry. No longer do you have
to substitute beer for milk.
Instead, through the miracles of
modern science, you can pop a
few lactase tablets and Ijecome a
lean, mean, lactose-digesting
machine.
Lactose is a sugar found in
milk and other dairy products.
Lactose can be absorbed bv our
digestive systems after it is split
into simpler sugars by the Clever
ly named enzyme, lactase.
Lactose ferments into lactic acid
when milk sours. Lactose is "esot
cal" spelled backwards.
At birth most humans produce
high levels of lactase and can
therefore digest all the lactose you
throw at them. For many people,
however, lactase levels drop off as
they grow older.
This is called lactase nonper
sistence or lactose malabsorption,
and is what people commonly
attribute lactose intolerance.
About 25 percent of American
adults and 75 percent of the world
population are lactase nonpersis
tent.
For most lactose intolerant
people, consuming a large
amount of lactose, like the
amount present in a quart of
milk, will lead to gastrointestinal
problems.
You may be wondering about
smaller amounts of milk, though.
Well, in a study reported in the
July 6, 1995, New England
Journal of Medicine, researchers
measured the effects of drinking
240 milliliters of milk on 30 indi
viduals who claimed to be severe
ly lactose intolerant. All of the
participants claimed that drink
ing even small amounts of milk
rendered them completely inca
pacitated and unable to function
as normal human beings.
Of course, you have to wonder
about the normal part, being that
they all supposedly knew what
240 milliliters of milk looks like.
But before you go out to get your
measuring cups and metric con
version tables. I'll tell you that
that's about eight ounces.
Of the 30 people that partici
pated in the study, upon scientific
testing (which I suspect involved
shouting at them very loudly, "Are
you SURE you're lactose intoler

ant?" "Are you REALLY SURE?"
"You're really, REALLY
SI RE? ), nine were found to be
able to digest lactose. The other
21 people really were lactase non
persistent and had digestive sys
tems which could not absorb lac
tose.
The researchers tested the 30
participants over two weeks, one
week with regular milk and one
week with milk treated to remove
all traces of lactose. The 30 par
ticipants were required to avoid
all other dairy products during
the study and record all svmp-

Toms of — 1 warned you earlier —
bloating, abdominal pain, diar
rhea and, here 1 use the scientific
term, flatus.
At the end of the study, the
researchers found that there were
no significant differences
between the symptoms the par
ticipants experienced while drink
ing lactose-free and lactose-con
taining milk. There were also no
significant differences between
the people who produced lactase
and those that didn't.
So. why is it that small
amounts of milk don't affect peo
ple too much?
If lactose is not hydrolyzed
before it reaches your colon, then
bacteria in your colon ferment
the lactose and produce some
fatty acids and gas. These prod
ucts are usually very quickly
absorbed by the bloodstream or
consumed by bacteria.
Only when you overburden
these mechanisms do you experi
ence gas and other unpleasant,
related sensations. However,
small amounts of lactose, like the
12 grams of lactose in 240 milli
liters of milk, apparently aren't
enough to cause noticeable prob
lems. Well, that is assuming you
don't have any problems to start
with.
To summarize, let's recap
what we have learned today:
1) You may be lactose intoler
ant.
Bl You may not be lactose
intolerant.
Three) It really doesn't matter,
as long as you don't consume too
much lactose in a day.
IV) 240 milliliters sounds like
a lot, but it really isn't.
And finally, drink your milk.
Your mommy worries about you.
