# Beyond earth-shaking discoveries
## Two new geophysics studies attempt to identify source of earthquakes 
### Prithika Balakrishnan Staff writer 
Earthquakes? They've been around for a
while, they happen with some frequency in
these parts and as long as you're willing to
crouch idiotically beneath a friendly desk,
you're as prepared as humanly possible. So
what's the big deal?
Scientists at the Geophysics Department
beg to differ.
Two separate findings have lead to a better
understanding of how and where earthquakes
form. Gregory Beroza, assistant professor of
geophysics, and graduate student Douglas
Dodge, along with William Ellsworth of the
U.S. Geological Survey, recently authored a
study concerning the phenomenon of the
silent start earthquake.
Beroza's colleagues, Geophysics Prof.
Simon Klemperer and postdoctoral research
associates Bruce Beaudoin and John Hole -
in a separate project — have nearly completed
the first three-dimensional picture of the
northern end of the San Andreas fault.
Both studies have major implications on
current models of earthquake mechanics,
and, of vast importance to individuals living
in the midst of a tectonic war-zone, on the
future of earthquake prediction.
Slips and Cascades
The start of an earthquake, known in geo
physics as nucleation, has long been believed
to be a tiny rupture which triggers a series of
small quakes which then triggers a major
earthquake. However, when Beroza and
Dodge began analyzing the mechanics of fore
shock sequences preceding six recent Califor
nia earthquakes, they found that small

quakes were more like-i

ly to relieve the stress
that lead to the maini

quake. "Instead of
taking the maini

shock closer to

failure, the fore-

shocks took the main shock
further away from failure,"
Dodge said

Both the foreshocks and the
main shock appear to be trig-

gered by some other mecha
nism, occurring hours to
days before the earthquake.
This pre-slip stage is silent
— too slow and too subtle
to pick up with seismic
instruments. However, one

aspect of the pre-slip stage — the
foreshock — is easily detected and mea
sured. By analyzing foreshocks as part of a

seismic ensemble, Dodge discovered

a way to distinguish mean-

ingfully among fore
shocks.
Beroza and Dodge's
data indicates that the
larger and more exten-

sive the pre-slip — in time,
area and size — the more
likely that the ensuing
quake would also be large.
However, not all fore
shocks can be counted
equally.
If the foreshock shows a

stress change in the same direction as the
main shock, then the foreshock loaded the
main shock — increased the seismic stress
and the chance that the main fault would fail,
leading to a major earthquake. On the other
hand, if the direction of the foreshock is away
from the main shock, then it serves to de-

stress the main earthquake.
This distinction among fore
shocks, Dodge and Beroza's
major contribution, might serve
to help predict potential major
earthquakes, an impossibility
with the cascade model. This
data, "is really ground-break
ing, given the importance of
foreshock sequences," Beroza
said. If a certain foreshock can
be analyzed in relation to the
pre-slip's direction, it can deter
mined whether or not it added
to the stress of the specific fault.
However, earthquakes do
still occur when foreshocks
release shock stress — four of
the six earthquakes Dodge stud
ied were preceded by foreshocks
moving away from the main
shock. This data, according to
Beroza, shows that, "if the fore
shocks are all that's causing the
main earthquake, then in at
least four cases the main shock
shouldn't have happened. How
ever, if there is some hidden
hand — if something like slow

pre-slip is occurring in addition to the fore
shocks — then that could explain all of our
observations." This hidden hand is the next
mystery that confronts researchers of earth
quakes.
Birth of a fault
Mapping part of the San Andreas fault is
an achievement of literally ground-breaking
proportions. Not only were Beaudoin, Hole
and Klemperer forced to winnow through one
million traces of seismic data, they were also

confronted with the task of displaying two
continental plates and a 10 to 12 mile deep fis
sure as a three-dimensional picture.
Their map is the first to show where the
San Andreas fault lies as it curves out under
the ocean, from Point Arena to Mendocino,
pinpointing its exact location for the first

time.
Using data from the Mendocino Triple
Junction Project, which sent sound waves
deep into the earth's crust from ship and
shore stations, and recording these sounds as
they bounced off different layers of rock, the
team is attempting to use computer codes
developed by Hole to create an unconvention
al seismic model. "The best analogy for the
difference may be that it is like looking at
many X-rays, versus one three-dimensional
CAT scan," Beaudoin said.
The Mendocino Triple Junction, near the

town of Petrolia, is the meeting place of three
tectonic plates — the Pacific Plate to the south,
the Gorda to the north and the North Ameri-

can to the east. The

boundaries
between these
plates are formed

by the Mendocino, Cas
cadia and San Andreas
faults.

For the past 29 mil
lion years, the two

ocean plates
have been

slowly
moving

north
ward
along the

edge of the
North Amer-

ican continen
tal plate, caus-

ing earthquakes,
tsunamis, feeding

hot springs, geysers
and volcanoes. At the

boundary between the

two oceanic plates, the
continental margin under-

goes a transition, clashing
against the Pacific Plate as it

dips undeVneath the Gorda. At
this point, the San Andreas fault

begins.
The geophysics teams complete three
dimensional profile of the fault line's north
ern end should give a clearer picture of the
transition zone between the three continental
plates. It should show how a fault is born.
According to Klemperer, "The same process
happened in the San Francisco Bay Area six
million years ago. The present, at Cape Men-



Sothy Cnhe — Daily
Geophysics Prof. Simon Klemperer and postdoctoral
research associates Bruce Beaudoin and John Hole have
nearly completed the first three-dimensional picture of
the San Andreas fault's northern end — where three tec
tonic plates come together.
