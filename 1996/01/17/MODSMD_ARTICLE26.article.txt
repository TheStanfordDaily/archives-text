### Ratha Harntha Editorial staff 
Not even a month-long layoff

The weekend victories raised the
top-ranked Cardinal's record to 4-
0 and extended Quick's dual-meet
record to 55-0 since he took over
as head coach in 1988.
"Neither one of the teams were
a threat to us from a team stand
point," Quick said.
The competition did not give
Stanford an idea of its season
progress. However, Quick recog
nizes that his squad has much to
accomplish. "We need to get bet
ter in every single area," he said.
"As a team, we don't have a lot of
easy speed."
Currently, the Cardinal must
expend a significant amount of
energy to reach maximum speed.
"We've got to focus on training,"
Quick said. "It's time to start
swimming faster."
Nonetheless, although they
are not quite up to speed yet,

Stanford swimmers posted sever
al impressive performances over
the weekend.
"Some were disappointed [with
(heir performance] and some
were happy," said senior co-cap
tain Jane Skillman. "I think we're
in real good position for March
I when the NCCA championships
take place]."
The Cardinal captured every
event in Friday's win over Vil
lanova. Skillman led the way for
Stanford, cruising to victories in
both the 200- and 400-meter
freestyle. Senior Jessica Tong and
juniors Claudia Franco and Sarah
Anderson joined Skillman as the
four Cardinal swimmers who won
two races. Freshman Carissa
Zenorini took the 1 -meter and 3-
meter diving competitions.

up as Stanford prevailed in all but
one event. Klin Austevoll, Chan
tal Kawn, Suzanne Toledo and
Zenorini all captured two events.
Zenorini again won both diving
contests.
"Racing against Villanova and
Nevada [were good experiences
for the freshmen]," Skillman
said. "The freshmen are learning
more about their bodies and what
they need to do to race well."
