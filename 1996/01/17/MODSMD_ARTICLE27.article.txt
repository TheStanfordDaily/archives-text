# Fresno State up next for injury-plagued wrestlers
## Tough-luck Cardinal looks to change fortunes

As if a formidable Bulldog squad
weren't enough, Stanford wrestlers
must overcome a slew of injuries to
emerge victorious from this evening's
contest *t Fresno State.
The Cardinal is coming off a tough
loss to Air Force last Friday that result
ed in large part from injuries to key
team members. Despite strong perfor
mances from most of its healthy
wrestlers, the Cardinal suffered from

the Cardinal's capabilities.
Against Fresno State, Stanford
hopes it will only have to forfeit two
matches. Whatever the number of for

Horpel alko pointed out that while
Stanford's recent rash of misfortune is
disappointing, a team's dual-meet
record is of very little importance in the
long run. Dual-meet records do not
influence a wrestler's opportunity to
qualify for the NCAAs, which will take
place March 21-23 at Minnesota.
Regardless of records, all Pacific 10
Conference teams will compete in fhe
conference tournament March 2-3 at
Cal State-Bakersfield. A wrestler's per
formance at the Pac-10 championships
will determine whether or not he quali
fies for the national tournament. So
