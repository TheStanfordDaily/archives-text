# Fresno State up next for injury-plagued wrestlers
## Tough-luck Cardinal looks to change fortunes 
### Karim Fahkry Contributing writer 
As if a formidable Bulldog squad
weren't enough, Stanford wrestlers
must overcome a slew of injuries to
emerge victorious from this evening's
contest *t Fresno State.
The Cardinal is coming off a tough
loss to Air Force last Friday that result
ed in large part from injuries to key
team members. Despite strong perfor
mances from most of its healthy
wrestlers, the Cardinal suffered from
an automatic 18-0 handicap caused by
three forfeits. As Stanford won five
matches and lost only two to the Fal
cons, the 24-17 final tally did not reflect
the Cardinal's capabilities.
Against Fresno State, Stanford
hopes it will only have to forfeit two
matches. Whatever the number of for
feits however, the Cardinal must con
tend with an imposing Bulldog squad

which has finished in the top 10 nation
ally for the last four years.
'"We are the underdogs in many of
the weight divisions, so we're going to
have to pull some upsets to beat them,"
suid Stanford head coach Chris Horpel.
Horpel alko pointed out that while
Stanford's recent rash of misfortune is
disappointing, a team's dual-meet
record is of very little importance in the
long run. Dual-meet records do not
influence a wrestler's opportunity to
qualify for the NCAAs, which will take
place March 21-23 at Minnesota.
Regardless of records, all Pacific 10
Conference teams will compete in fhe
conference tournament March 2-3 at
Cal State-Bakersfield. A wrestler's per
formance at the Pac-10 championships
will determine whether or not he quali
fies for the national tournament. So
long as a wrestler places in the top four
at the Pac-10 event in his
respective weight division, he
gains a NCAA berth.
Therefore, Horpel and his
squad view dual meets simply as

indicators of where the team
stands and what Stanford must
improve.
"(Fresno State isl a good
measuring stick for us," Horpel
said. "Our guys have to be able
to battle with a team like Fresno
State if they are going to meet
the goals they have set for them
selves."

Nevertheless, physical recov
ery is vital for the Cardinal,
especially since the injured ' Ist
includes wrestlers who have the
best chances of qualifying for
NCAAs.
Senior team-leader Tod Sur
mon ranks first in the Pac-10
and fifth nationally at 142
pounds, but remains sidelined
with a sprained knee. He hopes
to return within the next two
weeks.
Senior Sahlan Martin (158
pounds) also hopes to recover
from his neck sprain in the
upcoming two weeks. Sopho
more Jason Gladden (177) must
shed nerve problems in both
elbows.
Stanford's most serious
injury belongs to Ryan Rarnes
(150). A dislocated elbow forced
the junior to forfeit his entire
season.
