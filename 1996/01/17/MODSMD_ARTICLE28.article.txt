# Athletics just as legitimate as academics in advancing in life
## 
### 
It is long after sundown, and a young boy
returns home from the city playground
after hours of playing ball. He has been
there since school let out five hours ago,
unwinding and practicing his game.
Whether too tired, too lazy or too frustrated
to fail, he neglects his homework, showers,
watches an hour of television and goes to
sleep.

Twenty-five miles north of the city, a boy
of the same age sits at his desk reviewing for
the final time the fifth draft of his English
paper. He has been at that desk all after
noon and into the night since school let out.
Whether too tired, too lazy or too frightened
to fail, he has not visitnd the local play
ground in months. H<' showers and watches
an hour of TV to unwind from the long
hours of studying and goes to sleep
Four years later, that young boy from the
city receives a four-year, full scholarship to
a national basketball powerhouse. The
truth is, the boy who spent his secondary
education on the blacktop probably would
never have gotten into school without his
basketball skills, nor would he have been
able to afford it if he had.
Through his athletic ability, he turned
heads and got a look that never would have
come his way if he had stayed within the
confines of the classroom. He was at home
between the sidelines, in the lane, behind
the three-point line, but uncomfortable in
the classroom. His family realized the
importance of education, but in his neigh
borhood, the playground stars get more
recognition than the bookworms. His par
ents could not afford to send him to a better
public school or private school, and by

sophomore year, it was apparent that bas
ketball was his ticket to a higher education.
So athletics became the priority.
The other boy received attention from
universities as well, but for different rea
sons. His grades, his standardized test
scores and his recommendations turned
heads and earned him entrance into college.
His success reflected the values of his sub
urban family and community. He was at
home at his desk, in the science lab, on the
computer, but uncomfortable in the gymna
sium and in the locker room. He tried to
enjoy athletics but always felt uncoordinat
ed and vulnerable. So academics was his
strength, and he would ride them to their
potential.
Somewhere along the road, someone
docidod thai the young man who took
advantage of his mind throughout high
school had chosen the "correct" path. Earn
ing good grades in high school and receiving
acceptance to college was appropriate. How
many times have we heard a derogatory
statement about the athlete that never
would have gotten into school? "That guy
would never be here if it weren't for foot
ball!"
Why exactly is that so inappropriate?
Intelligence and athletic ability are both
genetic, both character traits determined by
parents and grandparents and so on. Some
have both; they are seen as the most apt to
succeed in the long run. Some have neither
and are discounted. Both talents can be
developed with hard work and determina
tion. Many have athletic superiority and
must work hard to improve upon the lack of
academic gifts they inherited. Others have
the opposite, brilliant minds that must work
hard to compete athletically.
What are the differences between
Lawrence Phillips and Einstein? Phillips
does not have Einstein's mind, of course,
yet I doubt Einstein could outrun a defense
like Phillips. Why is one ability so widely
â€¢accepted as better than the other? Should
Phillips' lack of Einstein's ability exclude
him from any opportunities?
