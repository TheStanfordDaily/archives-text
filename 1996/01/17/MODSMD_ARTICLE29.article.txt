# Cardinal rugby juggernaut smashes UC-Santa Cruz in season opener
## No. 1 Stanford easily rolls over Banana Slugs 83-6 
### Seth Goldstein Senior staff writer 
The top-ranked Stanford men's
rugby team began the 1996 season in
fine fashion on Saturday as it wal
loped UC-Santa Cruz 83-6 at Mal
oney Field. The Cardinal's second
team also met with great success in a
46-7 triumph, while the women's
team shut out the floundering
Banana Slugs 35-0.
"1 was expecting that we'd win
easily, but I didn't think Santa Cruz
would he that poor," said men's
coach Franck Boivert. "Their posi
tioning was horrible."
Although the Cardinal destroyed
the outmatched Banana Slugs in
every phase of the game, Boivert was
not pleased with some aspects of
Stanford's performance.
"The backs had a very poor perfor
mance," he said. "It was very disap
pointing."
On the other hand, the forwards
showed why the Cardinal is rated No.
1 in the nation. However, as Boivert
warns, the season has just begun and
the competition will improve dramat
ically.
"No firm conclusions can be drawn
yet," the coach said.
The Cardinal shares its No. 1
ranking with arch-rival California

and will clash will the Golden Bears
in early March. Until then, Stanford
must fend off a number of lesser
known, but nevertheless dangerous
foes.

This is the first time
[we've been ranked No.
I], and I don't know if
we're going to know
how to deal with it. I
remind them about stay
ing humble in their atti
tude to the game and
practice.'
— Franck Boivert

Boivert considers his team's lofty
ranking "unfortunate" because of
the attitude problems that can
accompany it. He is anxious to see if
his team will live up to its advance
billing in the weeks to come.
The Cardinal is the new kid among

tlu; powerhouses of collegiate rugby
and could possibly crack under pres
sure.
"This is the first time Iwe've been
ranked No. I|, and 1 don't know if
we're going to know how to deal with
it,"he said.
Boivert will remind his players
consistently of the importance of
keeping their minds on the game
rather than on their reputation.
"I keep them working on their
weak points," Boivert said. "And I
remind them about staying humble
in their attitude to the game and
practice. They need to be No. 1 on the
field, not No. 1 in the polls."
In 1995, a breakthrough year for
Stanford rugby, the Cardinal placed
eight of its members on the Pacific
Coast Select Team and four members
on the Ail-American squad. Three of
the four Ail-Americans — seniors
Bobby Blunt, Joe Clayton and Jeff
Sieman — are with the Cardinal
again in 1996.
"We have really high hopes for the
season," Blunt said. "But the team
still has to play well to make it to the
playoffs."
Stanford will travel to Tucson this
Saturday to battle Arizona. Accord
ing to Boivert, the Wildcats should
prove much more formidable than
UC-Santa Cruz.
