# On-line ASSU fee refunds move to World Wide Web
## 
### Boris Bershteyn 
Making use of its new World Wide Web
server, the ASSU has created a Web site
which it says will make special-fee refund ap
plications easier to file this quarter.
According to ASSU fee refund coordinator
Stephanie Li, one of the main reasons for cre
ating the site was the "greater accessibility
and convenience" that the Web provided.
Previously, students requested fee refunds
by using a complicated UNIX-based system.
The change was initiated in the beginning
of the school year by ASSU business manag
er John Hall.
ASSU fees are paid by students as part of
the University bill and help fund an array of
campus groups and organizations. Individ

ual students can withdraw support from spe
cific programs by requesting a partial or com
plete fee refund.
The deadline for requesting refunds is the
third Friday of each quarter, although re
quests made last quarter carry over to this
quarter and in the spring.
The new site, located at http://assu.stan
ford.edu/refund.html, also contains sum
maries of all current groups and organiza
tions and their submitted line-item budgets.
"I encourage all students to look through
t he Web site and investigate," Li said, adding
that awareness of ASSU-funded programs is
"a personal responsibility."
In addition to the change in making re-
quests, refunds will now appear
on the student's University bill
for the following quarter. Previ
ously, personal checks were
mailed to those who filed refund
requests.
The savings from the shift are
expected to reduce about $1 per
request in administrative costs,
;»i (1 Li.
Aside from technicalities, Li
declined to speculate on the
impact that the Web site will have
on the financial support for spe
cific student groups.
A few years ago, controversy
plagued the refund system as
graduate students organized
against programs that ignored
their interests. Consequently,
refund rates reached a high of 36
percent in 1993. Last quarter's
refund rate was 13.9 percent.

Significant disparities in
refund rates between graduate
students and undergraduate stu
dents prompted the ASSIJ to
change its special-fee system.
Starting this year, student
groups and organizations can
apply for funding from the under
graduate population, the gradu
ate population or both.
In expectation of the refunds,
student groups have been known
to overestimate their funding
needs. Buffers and other respons
es to erratic refund rates became
a subject of wide discussion a year
ago.
Last January, the Balanced
Funding Deal, an ASSU amend
ment. aimed at abolishing the fee
refund system, narrowly failed to
gather sufficient approval by stu
dents. Shortly thereafter, alterna
tive approaches to the issue were
debated by representatives of the
ASSU Senate, Council of Presi
dents and student groups, yet no
new arrangement was oassed.
