Kate Starbird
As an encore to her prolific performances against ASU
and Arizona two weekends ago, Kate Starbird exploded for
a career-high 33 points last Thursday in Stanford's win
over UCLA and then broke that mark with a 44-point out
burst in Saturday's victory over USC, setting a new Stan
ford record for most points scored in a single game.

Brian Moore
Stanford's fourth-ranked men's volleyball team started
its '96 campaign off on the right foot hy defeating Santa
Cruz in three easy games. Junior Brian Moore charged the
Cardinal's dominating victory over the hapless Banana
Slugs. The 6-foot-10 middle blocker set the tone of the
game with 12 kills and a .588 hitting percentage.
