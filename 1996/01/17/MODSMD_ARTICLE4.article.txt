# CSRE appointment raising controversy
## Asian sociologist's qualifications questioned 
### Amy Tovar 
The recent proposed ap
pointment of an Asian soci
ologist to the Asian-Ameri
can Studies component of
the interdisciplinary pro
gram in Comparative Stud
ies in Kace and Ethnicity has
reignited controversy on
campus over ethnic studies.
Concerned that they are
being left out of the process
of choosing faculty for the

University's new ethnic studies program, stu
dent leaders met last night to discuss develop
ments in hiring.
One of the two faculty billets allotted to the
ethnic studies program — designated for an
Asian-American Studies professor — was of
fered to University of Chicago Sociology Prof.
Grace Kao. The offer came through the Sociol
ogy Department, but Kao would have also
taught some Asian-American Studies courses.
Though Kao declined the offer, a dispute
over her credentials in the field has worried

students and faculty involved in the program's
development.
Faculty planning curriculum for the new
major said the controversy began over Kao's
appropriate role. The Sociology Department
had an open position and did not initially look
for an Asian-American studies scholar. Kao
was later considered for a position in both
areas, although some faculty said they felt she
was not qualified in Asian-American studies.
For students, concern centered around
their role in decision making. During discus
sion of the new program last spring, students
emphasized that their participation in hiring
was an integral part of their satisfaction with
the initiative.
Asian American Students Association
leader Kris Hayashi said Dean of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven had promised that
students would have input in the selection
process and that he "wouldn't fill the position
with someone who they didn't support."
Shoven has not been available to meet with
Asian-American students since they returned
