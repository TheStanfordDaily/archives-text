# CSRE appointment raising controversy
## Asian sociologist's qualifications questioned 
### Amy Tovar 
The recent proposed ap
pointment of an Asian soci
ologist to the Asian-Ameri
can Studies component of
the interdisciplinary pro
gram in Comparative Stud
ies in Kace and Ethnicity has
reignited controversy on
campus over ethnic studies.
Concerned that they are
being left out of the process
of choosing faculty for the

University's new ethnic studies program, stu
dent leaders met last night to discuss develop
ments in hiring.
One of the two faculty billets allotted to the
ethnic studies program — designated for an
Asian-American Studies professor — was of
fered to University of Chicago Sociology Prof.
Grace Kao. The offer came through the Sociol
ogy Department, but Kao would have also
taught some Asian-American Studies courses.
Though Kao declined the offer, a dispute
over her credentials in the field has worried

students and faculty involved in the program's
development.
Faculty planning curriculum for the new
major said the controversy began over Kao's
appropriate role. The Sociology Department
had an open position and did not initially look
for an Asian-American studies scholar. Kao
was later considered for a position in both
areas, although some faculty said they felt she
was not qualified in Asian-American studies.
For students, concern centered around
their role in decision making. During discus
sion of the new program last spring, students
emphasized that their participation in hiring
was an integral part of their satisfaction with
the initiative.
Asian American Students Association
leader Kris Hayashi said Dean of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven had promised that
students would have input in the selection
process and that he "wouldn't fill the position
with someone who they didn't support."
Shoven has not been available to meet with
Asian-American students since they returned


Saldivar
from winter break, she said. He is
currently out of town and could
not be reached for comment. Kao
could also not be reached for com
ment.
Hayashi's Concerned Students
for Asian-American Studies orga
nized a meeting last night to dis
cuss the move. The group, along
with other campus ethnic leaders,
announced its support for Kao's
decision to decline the Stanford
position.
According to Assoc. Prof, of
Comparative Literature and
CSRE Curriculum Committee
member David Palumbo-Liu, the
controversy played a role in Kao's
decision.
Palumbo-Liu said that "any
serious input from ethnic studies
scholars was disregarded" before
Kao was offered the position.
Prof. Cecilia Ridgeway, chair of
the Sociology Department,
described Kao as "a highly recom
mended race and ethnicity scholar
with a special concentration in
Asian-American studies."
The Sociology Department had

an opening and the primary objec
tive was to hire a first-rate sociol
ogist, Ridgeway said. When adver
tised, the position did not require
or request applicants to have an
Asian-American studies concen
tration.
If hired, Kao would have been
"100 percent in sociology with
some cross-over courses in Asian-
American Studies," Ridgeway
said.
CSRE Curriculum Committee
Chair and History Prof. A 1
Camarillo said that, although Kao
had experience in the field of
Asian-American studies, in order
for a person to qualify for the bil
let, "it is particularly important
for [that person] to be fully
enmeshed in Asian-American
studies."
Palumho-Liu and other mem
bers of the Asian-American and
Chicano Studies curriculum com
mittees agreed that Kao was not
an acceptable candidate because
her work did not fall centrally
into Asian-American studies.
Before winter break, a scholar
from outside the University was
asked to evaluate Kao's qualifica
tions as an Asian-American stud
ies expert, Palumbo-Liu said.
The outside scholar came to the

conclusion that Kao's background
in Asian-American studies was
not sufficient to receive his rec
ommendation for the position.
Palumbo-Liu said he objected
to the fact that, despite this nega
tive evaluation of Kao, she was
still offered the position.
Both Palumbo-Liu and Camar
illo said they did not dispute
Kao's ability as a sociologist; they
simply did not believe she was
concentrated enough to fill the
position in the ethnic studies pro
gram.
Ridgeway admitted that
"errors were made on both sides."
One reason for the controversy,
she said, was the Sociology
Department's hiring schedule.
The chair of the search com
mittee 1 received no communication
early last quarter from the ethnic
studies program because the com
mittee assumed that the selection
process would take place later in
t he year, she said.
When Shoven announced his
intention last year to establish an
interdisciplinary program in eth
nic studies, he was greeted with
guarded enthusiasm. Students
and faculty members alike
responded positively to the pro
posal for the program.

All sides acknowledge procedu
ral difficulties as the root of the
growing controversy and continue
to see future obstacles. According
to Camarillo, the problem arose
out of the "differing opinions of
the | Office of the Dean of Human
ities and Sciences], the Asian-
American Studies (program), and
the Sociology Department."
Ridgeway said "structural
problems arise when a faculty
member is 100 percent in one field
and affiliated with another."
Palumbo-Liu is "still dubious"
and said it will be necessary to
"clean up the process" in the
future. When the Asian-American
Studies billet is finally filled, he
said he hopes the candidates will
be evaluated by Asian-American
studies scholars.
Hayashi said she is aware of a
search underway in at least one
other department in the school to
fill the ethnic studies billet
declined by Kao.
The interdisciplinary program,
sponsored by the School of
Humanities and Sciences, will
eventually enable students to spe
cialize in Asian-American, African
and Afro-American and / or Chi
cano Studies, among other con
centrations.
