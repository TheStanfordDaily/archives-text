Hoover Fellow and
human rights activist Harry
Wu — who spent part of last
summer in a Chinese prison
fighting the country's abus
es of its people — has been
recognized with a presti
gious award for his work to
expose human rights viola
tions in China's labor camps
The Beggar's Resistance
Foundation, a group devot-

Ed to opposing dictatorship, named Wu the
199(5 recipient of the Beggars' Medal on Mon
day. The medal will be presented at a March
13 ceremony in Vlaardingen, the Nether
lands.

Wu currently works ;is executive director
at the Laogai Research Foundation and is a re
search fellow at the Hoover Institution.
Born in Shanghai, Wu moved to the Unit
ed States in 1985 after spending 19 years in
Chinese labor camps. Since then, he has re
turned to China five times, risking imprison
ment, to videotape human rights abuses in
lahor camps.
He returned to China last June and was ar
rested at a border crossing with Kazakhstan
on charges of spying. The government ex
pelled him from China in August.
Wu said he plans to return to China soon
because it is his native country. Because of
that and the nature of his work, he said, the
Chinese government should not stop him.


Wu
Wu's long struggle for human
rights makes him deserving of
the award, said Fred van Leer of
the Beggars' Resistance Founda
tion.
"He has since the 1960s fought
against the Communist regime in
China because he thought that
the regime was betraying the peo
ple and their Chinese culture,"
van Leer said. "When he was
caught last summer, it was the
hist straw for us to give him this
award."
Wu said it is hard to assess the
progress that has been made in
China ir. the area of human
rights.
"After 47 years, the people
have learned from their own
experience," Wu said. "In 1949,
people supported the Communist
government, but now they believe
that it is wrong."
He said increased awareness
on the part of the Chinese people
was encouraging but added that
the Chinese government has
made no progress in improving
human rights.
Wu said he plans to write a

book describing his experiences
in the labor camps, his visits to
China from 1991 to the present
and his life at Stanford.
He said he is "very honored" to
be this year's recipient of the Beg
gars' Medal.
The award stands for truth, he
said, and he will encourage people
to become involved in the quest to
improve human rights all over
the world.
The foundation presents the
Beggars' Medal each year to an
individual or organization that
helps preserve and advocate
democracy and encourages the
rejection of all forms of dictator
ship.
The award was named after a
Dutch resistance group that
begged for money to support the
resistance against Spain during
the Eighty Years War for indepen
dence in the 16th and 17th cen
turies. A second resistance group,
also named the Beggars, formed
during the German occupation of
the Netherlands in 1940.
The first Beggars' Medal went
to Amnesty International in
1987. Recipients in past years
have included the Anne Frank
Foundation, Doctors Without
Boarders USA and former Czech
president Vaclav Havel.
