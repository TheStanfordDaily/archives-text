Born in Shanghai, Wu moved to the Unit
ed States in 1985 after spending 19 years in
Chinese labor camps. Since then, he has re
turned to China five times, risking imprison
ment, to videotape human rights abuses in
lahor camps.
He returned to China last June and was ar
rested at a border crossing with Kazakhstan
on charges of spying. The government ex
pelled him from China in August.
Wu said he plans to return to China soon
because it is his native country. Because of
that and the nature of his work, he said, the
Chinese government should not stop him.
