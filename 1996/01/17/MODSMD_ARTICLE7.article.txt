# Undergraduates who choose to marry find 'liberating effect'

spend some time with her."
Having been married for over
a year now, Ginstrom has dis
covered that his group of friends
has changed as well.
"You still have your single
friends that you like to go out
with, but after you get married
you don't see them so much any
more," he said. "You get more
friends that are married."
The Turleys said they some
times have difficulty relating to
their undergraduate unmarried
friends. "We're kind of separat
ed from the undergraduate side
of things because people don't
advertise over here," Steve said.
Ginstrom, however, ex
pressed no regrets about being
married. "You have a sense of
permanence. If you're just dat
ing, even if you think it's going
to be for long term, there's an
idea of it being temporary."
Steve agreed, adding that sta
bility is one of the best things
about being married. "It takes
some of the pressure off," he said.
"Even if I make a silly decision in
the future, even if the bottom
falls out of everything, I have a
rock solid support at home."
When they first announced
their wedding plans, all three
found their friends to be mainly
supportive. A few, however, re
acted with shock or disappoint
ment.
"I was the first of most of my
friends to get married, so they all
thought it could never happen to
one of us," Ginstrom said.
Ruth noticed more negative
reactions from her elders. "A lot
of people from her home town
were concerned that she wouldn't
finish her degree," Steve
explained. "But interestingly I
didn't get a single piece of nega
tive feedback. So 1 don't know if
it's a gender thing or if I was just
lucky, but everyone was very sup
portive of me."
Although Ruth's mother tem
pered her blessing with a warning
to be sure and finish school, all
three students received extremely
positive feedback from their par
ents.
Steve's parents backed their
verbal support with financial sup
port. "They agreed to pretend
financially that nothing had
changed because Stanford does
kind of a crazy thing with finan
cial aid," Steve said. "Even if the
federal government sees you as
independent from your parents,

Stanford does not. So even if
you're married, they still consider
your parents' finances in your
financial aid."
Ginstrom, however, pays for
his own tuition through work
study, loans and savings. His wife,
Reiko, is not a Stanford under
graduate, and her earnings help
contribute to paying the bills.
"Money is tough," Ginstrom
admitted. "You don't have a safe
ty net because your parents
aren't really covering anything."
Being married cost Ruth in
terms of scholarship opportuni
ties. She lost one of her scholar
ships and was automatically dis
qualified from a Rhodes Scholar
ship because she was married.
Then she was nominated for an
Irvine Fellowship at Stanford,
but was again disqualified
because it was a residentially
based program.
"It made me wonder about
how (Stanford) values marriage,"
she said. "Those three experi
ences — that fellowship, the
scholarship that I lost and then

the Rhodes Scholarship that I
wasn't even considered for —
made me realize that society
doesn't value marriage as much
It's a commitment
before God. We just
really wanted to
share everything, not
just going out on
dates. We wanted to
share our entire
lives.'

as I thought it did."
Despite these experiences,
Ruth said she regards marriage as
"absolutely wonderful." She
would not, however, recommend
a similar course for everyone.
"Obviously that depends on

the person, on the specific circum
stances," she said. "But age isn't
all that relevant in determining
whether or not a person can or
should get married. It's more
dependent on maturity."
Steve agreed. "I would warn
anyone from saying, 'I should
wait until I graduate,' or 'I should
wait until I accomplish this, I
should wait until I have a career,'
because that's really irrelevant,"
he said. There's always going to
be something. . . . But in saying
all that I realize that we've been
very fortunate."
For the Turleys, a shared reli
gious faith has contributed to the
harmony of their marriage.
"For us the aspect of God —
we're both Christian — was
important for us as a Christian
marriage has perhaps a different
meaning than just that it's some
legal commitment," Ruth said.
"It's a commitment before God.
We just really wanted to share
everything, not just going out on
dates. We wanted to share our
entire lives."
