spend some time with her."
Having been married for over
a year now, Ginstrom has dis
covered that his group of friends
has changed as well.
"You still have your single
friends that you like to go out
with, but after you get married
you don't see them so much any
more," he said. "You get more
friends that are married."
The Turleys said they some
times have difficulty relating to
their undergraduate unmarried
friends. "We're kind of separat
ed from the undergraduate side
of things because people don't
advertise over here," Steve said.
Ginstrom, however, ex
pressed no regrets about being
married. "You have a sense of
permanence. If you're just dat
ing, even if you think it's going
to be for long term, there's an
idea of it being temporary."
Steve agreed, adding that sta
bility is one of the best things
about being married. "It takes
some of the pressure off," he said.
"Even if I make a silly decision in
the future, even if the bottom
falls out of everything, I have a
rock solid support at home."
When they first announced
their wedding plans, all three
found their friends to be mainly
supportive. A few, however, re
acted with shock or disappoint
ment.
"I was the first of most of my
friends to get married, so they all
thought it could never happen to
one of us," Ginstrom said.
