IMAGING, INC
Electronics for Imaging (EFI) changed the way the world sees color and has become a $150
million company and the leader in the color server market. Since our beginning in 1989,
we've grown an average of 40% per year and now rank #19 in Inc. Magazine's Top 100 Fastest
Growing Companies. Our product, the Fiery, is a high-end printer controller based on cutting edge
RISC technology. It transforms color copiers into color printers, providing a much better price to
performance ratio than laser desktop color printers and produces images of almost photographic
quality.
We are currently hiring college graduates for
hardware, software, and technical support positions.
