# Telling the world's stories

Her photographs are vivid yet haunting;
from the wide eyes of Mexican children
caught in an age-old land dispute to bloody
portraits of civilian death on Chiapas dirt
roads. Liliana Nieto del Rio's talent is her
ability tobringa Latin American viewpoint to
a broader audience.
Although she has resided in the United
States for 12 years, Mexican-born photojour
nalist Nieto del Rio's interests still lie largely
in her Latin American roots.
"1 always wanted to tell stories about the
people and the world around me," said 38-
year-old Nieto del Rio, who is spending the
year in Stanford's Knight Fellowship pro
gram. Granted by the Communication De-

partment, the fellow
ship offers profes
sional journalists a
chance to return to
the university set
ting.

"I came to the States to study [at New York
University's Film Institute] and stayed on to
work, hut I always maintained my interest in
[Latin America]."
This intimate vantage point helped the
former New York Newsday and Los Angeles
Times staff photographer land a major free
lance job; from 1994 through 1995 Nietodel
Rio documented for The New York Times the
recent and deep-rooted unrest in Chiapas,
Mexico, between indigenous Zapatistas and
the Mexican military.
Nieto del Rio said her cultural identity as

both Mexican and a U.S. citizen gave her in
sight into the situation and allowed her to
better convey to the removed American pub
lic the violence, emotion and people involved
in the Chiapas situation.
"Being Latin American gave me an outlet
to say what was going on to people outside
Mexico," she said. "Some of the press lacked
this kind of perspective."
Although she said "probably not even 1
percent" of her Chiapas photographs were
published due to the space limitations of

newspapers, "when they were,
they had a certain impact."
According to Nieto del Rio, it
was the power of the medium as
well as the nature of the profes
sion — especially freelance
assignments such as Chiapas —
that initially drew her to photo
journalism.
"I like to go to places and be a
presence in people's lives, if they
let me. That's part of the privilege
of being a journalist," she said.
Along with this "privilege"
comes the challenge of capturing
those lives and conveying them to
an audience, she said.
In Mexico, for example, some
indigenous people are wary of
cameras, believing that having
one's picture taken is a bad omen.
"It has to do with their soul; they
just have a different view of the
world," she said.
Still, Nieto del Rio seems to
capture a slice of life in her pho
tography.
In her Chiapas collection,
images of Zapatista women wait

ing for the return of soldier sons
and husbands juxtaposed with
scenes of the Mexican army
searching deserted Zapatista
homes portray years of struggle
and endurance. Behind colorful
handkerchiefs, women guerillas
carrying rifles that look hand
made march through towns.
As for her outlook as a Mexico
native, "You always try to main
tain objectivity, but even if
you're supposed to be an objec

tive journalist, you can't help
seeing what you see," Nieto del
Rio said.
"There was very little time to
be that analytical [in Chiapas],
unfortunately, because when
things break, you follow," Nieto
del Rio said.
Since deciding to make a per
manent home in the United
States and moving to California,
Nieto del Rio has also become
interested in immigration issues.

"America is what it is: a nation
of immigrants, for better or for
worse," she said.
"People focus on only what
(immigrants) are taking away;
they should also be focusing on
what they can contribute," she
said. "For instance, if immigrant
farm workers were to strike for a
week, this country's economy
would go nuts."
Nieto del Rio herself immigrat
ed from a "very traditional soci
ety" in Mexico to pursue a more
professional way of life in the U.S.
"Not to put down housewives,"
she said, "but I wanted something
else. In Mexico it's a little bit
hard."
Although she said she feels
that her decision to leave the
country of her birth was general
ly a positive one, she takes an
active political stance: "This is
the richest country in the world.
The government just shouldn't
allow certain things to happen,
urban poverty being one of
them," she said.
As a Latina immigrant to the
United States and among what
she calls "the .009 percent privi
leged immigrant population,"
she said she feels compelled to
use her privilege and her occupa
tion to shed light on the situa
tion of immigrants in the United
States.
Upon completing her Stanford
fellowship, Nieto del Rio ulti
mately plans to resume her politi
cally charged freelance photogra
phy — though she said she is still
interested in documentary film
making, which she originally
studied at NYU and revisited in a
Stanford class last quarter
Meanwhile, she said she is
interested in new forums for pho
tography display — namely pub
lishing on the Internet.
"There's so much to learn
about how journalism is becom
ing part of this whole new infor
mation (network|," she said.
Her most immediate project,
however, promises to be the baby
she's expecting this spring. But
according to Nieto del Rio, a child
won't change her "follow-the
action" mentality. Rather, she
said, "I think that he or she will
just have to adapt."

former New York Newsday and Los Angeles
Times staff photographer land a major free
lance job; from 1994 through 1995 Nietodel
Rio documented for The New York Times the
recent and deep-rooted unrest in Chiapas,
Mexico, between indigenous Zapatistas and
the Mexican military.
Nieto del Rio said her cultural identity as

both Mexican and a U.S. citizen gave her in
sight into the situation and allowed her to
better convey to the removed American pub
lic the violence, emotion and people involved
in the Chiapas situation.
"Being Latin American gave me an outlet
to say what was going on to people outside
Mexico," she said. "Some of the press lacked
this kind of perspective."
Although she said "probably not even 1
percent" of her Chiapas photographs were
published due to the space limitations of

newspapers, "when they were,
they had a certain impact."
According to Nieto del Rio, it
was the power of the medium as
well as the nature of the profes
sion — especially freelance
assignments such as Chiapas —
that initially drew her to photo
journalism.
"I like to go to places and be a
presence in people's lives, if they
let me. That's part of the privilege
of being a journalist," she said.
Along with this "privilege"
comes the challenge of capturing
those lives and conveying them to
an audience, she said.
In Mexico, for example, some
indigenous people are wary of
cameras, believing that having
one's picture taken is a bad omen.
"It has to do with their soul; they
just have a different view of the
world," she said.
Still, Nieto del Rio seems to
capture a slice of life in her pho
tography.
In her Chiapas collection,
images of Zapatista women wait

ing for the return of soldier sons
and husbands juxtaposed with
scenes of the Mexican army
searching deserted Zapatista
homes portray years of struggle
and endurance. Behind colorful
handkerchiefs, women guerillas
carrying rifles that look hand
made march through towns.
As for her outlook as a Mexico
native, "You always try to main
tain objectivity, but even if
you're supposed to be an objec

tive journalist, you can't help
seeing what you see," Nieto del
Rio said.
"There was very little time to
be that analytical [in Chiapas],
unfortunately, because when
things break, you follow," Nieto
del Rio said.
Since deciding to make a per
manent home in the United
States and moving to California,
Nieto del Rio has also become
interested in immigration issues.

"America is what it is: a nation
of immigrants, for better or for
worse," she said.
"People focus on only what
(immigrants) are taking away;
they should also be focusing on
what they can contribute," she
said. "For instance, if immigrant
farm workers were to strike for a
week, this country's economy
would go nuts."
Nieto del Rio herself immigrat
ed from a "very traditional soci
ety" in Mexico to pursue a more
professional way of life in the U.S.
"Not to put down housewives,"
she said, "but I wanted something
else. In Mexico it's a little bit
hard."
Although she said she feels
that her decision to leave the
country of her birth was general
ly a positive one, she takes an
active political stance: "This is
the richest country in the world.
The government just shouldn't
allow certain things to happen,
urban poverty being one of
them," she said.
As a Latina immigrant to the
United States and among what
she calls "the .009 percent privi
leged immigrant population,"
she said she feels compelled to
use her privilege and her occupa
tion to shed light on the situa
tion of immigrants in the United
States.
Upon completing her Stanford
fellowship, Nieto del Rio ulti
mately plans to resume her politi
cally charged freelance photogra
phy — though she said she is still
interested in documentary film
making, which she originally
studied at NYU and revisited in a
Stanford class last quarter
Meanwhile, she said she is
interested in new forums for pho
tography display — namely pub
lishing on the Internet.
"There's so much to learn
about how journalism is becom
ing part of this whole new infor
mation (network|," she said.
Her most immediate project,
however, promises to be the baby
she's expecting this spring. But
according to Nieto del Rio, a child
won't change her "follow-the
action" mentality. Rather, she
said, "I think that he or she will
just have to adapt."
