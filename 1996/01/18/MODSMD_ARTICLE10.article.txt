Bosnians withdraw on time
PANJIK, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — After
burning and looting houses in an apparent
attempt to prevent Bosnian Serbs from returning,
government soldiers were withdrawing yesterday
from a bitterly contested front line in north-cen
tral Bosnia.
NATO officials said the withdrawal here was
going ahead of schedule, and they expected forces
all over Bosnia to meet a deadline of midnight (3
p.m. PST) tomorrow for pulling back from former
confrontation lines.
In Washington, Defense Secretary William
Perry said the pullback of opposing forces is "the
most positive development" since NATO-led
troops entered Bosnia last month.
"It would appear that the forces will voluntari
ly remove themselves from the zone of separat ion
and the NATO forces will not be required to use
force to make that happen," Perry told reporters.
Aide's story supports First Lady
WASHINGTON (AP) - Confronted with his
own memos linking Hillary Rodham Clinton to
the White House travel office firings, a former
White House aide testified yesterday that he was
pressured to take the action but not directly by
the first lady.
"She did not order me to fire them," David
Watkins, seated alone all day at a wooden witness
table, told a House investigative committee look
ing into the May 199.3 dismissals.
But he added: "Did I feel pressure 7 Yes, 1 did."

He said others in the White House, including
the late deputy counsel Vincent Foster and Harry
Thomason, who at the time was working as a pri
vate, unpaid adviser to President Clinton, invoked
the First Lady's name in pressing for the firings.
Clinton has said that aides may have misinter
preted her expressions of concern about possible
financial problems in the travel office to mean she
wanted the workers fired, but that she never
ordered such an action.
"I did not have a hand in making the decision,"
Clinton said in an interview yesterday.
Barbara Jordan dead at 59
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Former Rep. Barbara
Jordan, whose ringing oratory made her the voice
of moral authority during the Watergate impeach
ment hearings, died yesterday at age 59.
Jordan — one of the first two blacks elected to
Congress from the South since Reconstruction
died of pneumonia believed to be a complication of
leukemia, said George Christian, a Democratic
insider and former press secretary to President
Lyndon B. Johnson.
"When Barbara spoke with that deep, booming
voice, it was as though she was speaking from
tablets of stone," former Treasury Secretary
Lloyd Bentsen said. "She had a presence as few
people do. "
Jordan also had been ill for several years with
multiple sclerosis, and used a wheelchair and
walker. She nearly drowned in 1988 when she lost
consciousness in her backyard swimming pool.
