# Russian army pounds rebels
## Hope of rescuing hostages held by Chechens abandoned

PERVOMAYSKAYA, Russia
<AP) — Russian forces gave up
hope of saving any hostages and
unleashed a scorching barrage of
rockets yesterday on the tiny vil
lage that ground troops had failed
to wrest from Chechen rebels.
One hostage — an old man
whose name was not given —
escaped from the village after dark
yesterday night and said he did not
see anyone alive, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
The assault came despite new
terrorist threats by Chechen sym
pathizers, including gunmen who
hijacked a Black Sea ferry in
Turkey carrying 200 people and
said they would blow it up unless
the Russians stopped the battle at
Pervomayskaya.
In the blowing snow, hundreds
of weary Russian troops pulled
back yesterday on the steppes
around the ruined village, allowing
their comrades to fire volley after
volley from Grad rocket-launch
ers. Pervomayskaya's cluster of
small buildings was also rocketed
by helicopter gunships and struck
by rounds of artillery shells.
Heavy machine-gun fire in the
late afternoon indicated that the
Chechens were still resisting. The

last Russian rocket attack came
shortly after 8 p.m., ITAR-Tass
said.
Reporters were expelled by
Russian military authorities from
Pervomayskaya and neighboring
villages earlier yesterday. The
region, in the republic of Dages
tan, is just across the border from
Chechnya.
The Russians began storming
the village Monday, breaking a
five-day standoff and refusing the
Chechens' demands for safe pas
sage to their homeland. At the
time, authorities said they resort
ed to force because the gunmen
were killing hostages — a charge
denied by separatist leaders in
Chechnya.
In Washington, Defense Secre
tary William Perry said Russia
was justified in using military
force in response to hostage-tak
ings.
"We reject the right of any
group to take hostages as a means
of implementing their policies, so
therefore we believe the Russian
government is entirely correct in
resisting this hostage-taking effort
and resisting it very strongly," he
said.
On yesterday, Russian officials

again claimed they escalated the
conflict because hostages were
being killed. Maj. Gen. Alexander
Mikhailov, a spokesman for the
Federal Security Service, said the
gunmen planned to execute the
captives and try to escape.
"Because the situation is
becoming more complicated, we
have decided to conclude the oper
ation," Mikhailov said.
Asked about the hostages, he
said, "We have little hope for
them."
Before the Russian assault, the
Chechens were estimated to be
holding 70 to 120 hostages, includ
ing women and children.
The hostages were among up to
3,000 seized Jan. 9 when Chechen
gunmen raided a hospital in the
nearby city of Kizlyar. At least 40
people were killed. Taking some
hostages with them, the gunmen
set out for Chechnya the next day,
but were stopped by Russian
troops at Pervomayskaya.
The rebels, estimated to num
ber between 150 and 250, have
rocket-propelled grenades and
have destroyed several armored
personnel carriers.
At least 100 people have been
killed and injured in the village.
