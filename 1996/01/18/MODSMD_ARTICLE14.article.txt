## Editorial Worried about Ws 
### 
The University must
acknowledge grade's
negative connotation

AT THE LAST Faculty Sen
ate meeting, University
President Gerhard Casper
commented on a recently publi
cized situation involving a fresh
man who broke his leg, was
forced to withdraw from a dance
class after the deadline and
unsuccessfully fought the place
ment of a permanent W grade on
his transcript. Stressing that the
W was implemented to insure
that transcripts more accurately
reflect each student's academic
history, Casper said that he would
be "very apprehensive if the W
was viewed as a negative."
According to Casper, the W grade
"is not meant to be punitive."
Admittedly, the W does provide
a more accurate account of a stu
dent's academic proceedings.
However, it would be foolish to
assume that students feel the W
is "punitive" in the sense that it
constitutes some sort of punish
ment.
Regardless of the University's
intentions, the W is in fact
"viewed as a negative." Just ask
any student if he or she would
mind having one on his or her
transcript. Surely, most students
would decline if given the choice.
In fact, there is a widespread
belief that having a W on one's
transcript is a bad thing. For
example, the head student coordi
nator for advising associates com
mented that the fear felt by many
students who dropped courses
before last quarter's deadline
could have been caused by the
negative connotations of the new
grading policy. More poignantly,
Economics Undergraduate Assis
tant Nicole Reed referred to the
Wand NP grades as "ugly."
Also, this year, both faculty

and student advisers urged their
advisees to be much more conser
vative when picking classes. It is
clear that the new grading policy
has caused people to alter both
their views and behavior.
Of course, the University
should not change its policy sim
ply because people are being more
cautious or don't like the W
grade. To its credit, the Universi
ty has done an excellent job of
insuring that everyone is
informed about the W, the new
drop deadlines and all the rest of
the changes that were enacted
this year with the new grading
policy. Furthermore, the exis
tence of the W does promote the
University's goal of creating more
accurate transcripts.
However, it is inappropriate to
deny knowledge of the negative
feelings and views of students
when discussing the policy.
Administrators need to acknowl
edge and he honest about what
people are saying, feeling and
doing in reaction to the new poli
cy. It is indeed unfortunate to see
that many administrators either
seem to ignore or, even worse, are
unaware of the evidence which
demonstrates that students do in
fact worry about the marks on
their transcripts. It would appear
that administrators are out of
touch with students.
Considering that the perma
nent W is brand new and that its
effects were not predicted by
administrators, it would seem
logical that there should be cases
where exceptions may be granted.
And because the grading system
is new, now is the time for the
University to debug it â€” before
precedents are set. It would be
unwise for the University to
ignore contingencies it could not
have planned for, it should
address them in an honest and
open manner.
Even if the poor, broken-footed
gentleman retains his W, the Uni
versity should at least acknowl
edge that it understands why he
wouldn't want one.
