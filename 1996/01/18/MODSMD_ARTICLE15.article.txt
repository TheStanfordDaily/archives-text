Athletic director justifies Liberty Bowl costs

CHRIS M. GOLDE'S letter in the
Jan. 8 issue of The Daily asks
several questions about Stan
ford's participation in (he 1995 St.
Jude Liberty Bowl Classic, most con
cerning the cost of our participation
and purpose for doing so. It is my hope
that this response will satisfy her con
cerns and others who may share them.
Let me begin by responding to the
question "why participate?" As you
know, Stanford's 1995 football season
was filled with challenges, renewed
commit ment, excitement and success.
That success was the result of the
commitment of coach Tyrone Willing
ham and his staff, who trained and

inspired the young men on the team to
work together toward a common goal.
Participation in the Liberty Howl
acknowledged the lessons they learned
and the accomplishments they
achieved. In addition, by playing the
game, Stanford's football team was
able to represent the University in a
national athletic event and be a role
model on the field for aspiring young
athletes.
Those attending — the team, coach
es, band, drill teams, faculty and staff
from the Department of Athletics and
the University — were appreciative of
the invitation, honored to accept it and
proud to represent Stanford in Mem-

phis. This invitation was a reflection of
the winning spirit that the team
embodies both on the field and in the
classroom.
As for the cost of attending the Liber
ty Howl, Stanford and East Carolina
University both received a guaranteed
payment of $750,000 from the Liberty
Howl Festival Association for their
appearances in the game. Each institu
tion also agreed to purchase 18,000 tick
ets for the event, which were available
for resale to the team and university
supporters as well as the general public.
The total cost of our participation
included travel, lodging, meals, trans
portation in Memphis, practice facilities,

equipment, publications and awards.
In order to cover these expenses,
approximately one-half of the tickets
purchased by Stanford were resold.
Golde's assertion that this event result
ed in a net loss of revenues is incorrect.
In fact, due to the good work of several
members of the University staff and to
the strong support of this team, the
costs of this event were covered.
I hope that this clears up any mis
conceptions about our participation in
the 1995 Liberty Howl. However, if it
does not, I would be happy to address
any questions that remain.
Ted Leland
Athletic director
