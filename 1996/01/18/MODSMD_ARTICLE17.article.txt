## Mad Libs, Mad Libs 
### 
OK KIDS, MAD Libs were fun
when we were little, and they're
still fun today. For those of you
who may have forgotten the rules of the
game, it's easy. You just insert words
where we dictate that you should. We
know that winter break and the holidays
often evoke feelings of lust and romance
with one's hometown hon. Eggnog with
a splash of mistletoe will do that. But we
also know that these romances are a mis
take over the long run. So, we have taken
it upon ourselves to pen a painful letter
to the hometown hon. As the song goes,
"Breaking up is hard to do." Choose your
words wisely. You don't want to burn all
your bridges; summer is just around the
corner.
Dear (insert name of soon-to-be ex),
I really enjoyed the time we spent
together during winter break. Thank
you for the (insert name of expensive
gift). I'll use it every morning. Everyone
here likes it. You caught me off guard
with it. I am sorrv I didn't have anything
quite that nice for you.
1 miss you and the things we used to
do: cuddling after (insert verb in gerund
form), holding each other's (insert
appendage) while walking down the
street, watching the snowflakes fall
while drinking (insert name of favorite

hot beverage), riding a one-horse open
sleigh while singing (insert favorite Ala
nis Morissette tune) and sharing inti
mate thoughts. The time was truly
(insert gratuitous adjective). In short, I
miss you a lot.
Which is why it is especially difficult
for me to write these next sentences. As
you may know, college is a special time,
kind of like the holidays are a special
time. But a different kind of special. For
while the holidays are a time to renew
old relationships, college is a time of
experimentation. I realize that you are
growing as a person a whole bunch in
college 1 fear that I am holding you back.
This is a timpTor you to try (insert chem
ical substance). I don't want you to look
back in a few years and be bitter because
I spoiled your chances of becoming
(insert whatever). In short, I am break
ing up with you. As Nietzsche often
remarked on such matters of the heart,
"That which is falling must also be
pushed."
It's not you who's the problem. It's
me. Lately, I have been feeling like a rat
in a cage, despite all my rage. Ever feel
like that?
I hope you understand. It's not that I
don't love you or don't want to go out
with you ever again. It's just that, oh
God, this is so difficult to say. ... I am at
Stanford, and you are not. This puts an

(insert adjective indicating really, really
huge) distance between the two of us. I
want not only to be friends, but the kind
of friends you see every Thursday at 8
p.m. You know, young, hip, (insert
favorite eating disorder in adjective
form) and virile ("virile" is not "viral").
I hope that this does not spoil the
chances of us (insert euphemism) togeth
er this summer. I really care about you,
really. I just know you need your space.
So, how is your quarter going? Taking
some neat classes? I got into a good sem
inar on (insert name of boring class that
makes you sound important and eru
dite), so I am psyched. How is that class
on whatever going? It sounded interest
ing.
Well, it looks like I have that impor
tant class pretty soon, so I had better
wrap this up. This letter was so (insert
adjective indicating angst) to write. See
you this summer!
Without remorse,
(insert your name here)

Did you think that the glow emanating
from the briefcase in "Pulp Fiction"could
really be Marcelis' soul ? Whatever.
