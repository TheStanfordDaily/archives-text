## New Greek task force may consider sorority houses 
### Libusha Kelly Contributing writer 
The prospect of housed sororities at Stanford may
once again be considered by a new task force created to
undertake a comprehensive review of the Greek sys
tem.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Maty Edmonds is
expected to announce the formation and names of
group members within a few weeks, according to the
Office of Student Affairs. Eight students — all of whom
are members of fraternities or sororities — have al
ready been nominated by the ASSU to sit on the task
force, which will look at all aspects of Greek life on the
Stanford campus.
Edmonds announced plans to review the Greek sys
tem in a speech last October, saying "it is time to mea

sure its health and see how, together, we can make the
system stronger."
"The task force will be an advisory panel of fraterni
ty and sorority members who will talk to the adminis
tration about issues which affect the [Greek) commu
nity at Stanford," said Kevin Armstrong, a member of
Sigma Phi Epsilon who has been nominated for the
panel. "Housing is probably going to be the main
issue."
Housing has always been a sticky issue for Greeks at
Stanford. According to a 1977 housing policy, known as
the grandfather clause, only I' 2 specified fraternities
have priority for housing on campus, said Fraternal Af
fairs Advisor Heather Dunn. Sororities have not been
housed at Stanford since 1944.
