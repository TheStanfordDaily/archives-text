## New Greek task force may consider sorority houses 
### Libusha Kelly Contributing writer 
The prospect of housed sororities at Stanford may
once again be considered by a new task force created to
undertake a comprehensive review of the Greek sys
tem.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Maty Edmonds is
expected to announce the formation and names of
group members within a few weeks, according to the
Office of Student Affairs. Eight students — all of whom
are members of fraternities or sororities — have al
ready been nominated by the ASSU to sit on the task
force, which will look at all aspects of Greek life on the
Stanford campus.
Edmonds announced plans to review the Greek sys
tem in a speech last October, saying "it is time to mea

sure its health and see how, together, we can make the
system stronger."
"The task force will be an advisory panel of fraterni
ty and sorority members who will talk to the adminis
tration about issues which affect the [Greek) commu
nity at Stanford," said Kevin Armstrong, a member of
Sigma Phi Epsilon who has been nominated for the
panel. "Housing is probably going to be the main
issue."
Housing has always been a sticky issue for Greeks at
Stanford. According to a 1977 housing policy, known as
the grandfather clause, only I' 2 specified fraternities
have priority for housing on campus, said Fraternal Af
fairs Advisor Heather Dunn. Sororities have not been
housed at Stanford since 1944.
The Kappa Kappa Gamma
sorority applied for housing last
year, but their request was not
granted.
Dunn said that although hous
ing for a sorority was not antici
pated for next fall, it is a possibili
ty for the 1997-98 academic year.
"We are committed to positive
change for the future," Dunn said,
adding that she hopes the task
force will include consideration of

housing policy changes.
Dunn also said she believes that
housing sororities could be benefi
cial to the campus. "There is a
value in increasing the pool of
housing options available to
women."
Jennafer Groswith, president
of the Chi Omega sorority, said
she also feels that current housing
policies are unfair to sororities as
well as unhoused fraternities.
"The grandfather clause is
exclusionary in that it prevents
any new Greek group from getting
a house," Groswith said. She
added that she also feels that the

value in housing fraternities and
sororities lies not only in giving
students more choices, but in
offering them a very different
experience from regular dorm life.
Hut Groswith was cautious
with her optimism. "I'd love to
graduate knowing that a sorority
will be housed, but I'm not certain
that will happen."
Groswith and Armstrong both
said the task force has issues
other than housing to deal with as
well. Armstrong said he hopes to
review the University's social pro
bation policy and to find ways to
foster greater cohesion within the

Greek community.
"People don't realize all that
the Greek system has to offer
here," said Groswith. "What we
need to do is present a united
front and work together as a
group to improve our image."
Armstrong added that he decid
ed to work for the task force for a
similar reason.
"Interest in and respect for the
system don't really exist here,
even within the Greek communi
ty," he said. "We need to begin
acting more like a community
rather than as disinterested indi
viduals."
