## Hot-shooting Starbird set to guide women to victory 
### Bobby Cuza Staff writer 
She can't possibly keep this
up, can she?
That's what the Oregon
women's basketball team is
probably wondering about Stan
ford's Kate Starbird. The junior
guard will seek a third-straight
career-best performance tonight
when the fifth-ranked Cardinal
(11-2 overall, 4-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) travels to Eugene, Ore.,
for a 7 p.m. meeting with the
Ducks (8-5, 0-3).
Starbird recorded a career
high 33 points in the Cardinal's
81-77 come-from-behind win
over UCLA last Thursday and
then bettered her own mark
when she amassed a school
record 44 points — the most by a
Division I player this season —
in Saturday's 88-67 romp over
USC. For her efforts, Starbird
earned Pac-10 Player of the
Week honors for the second time
this season.
Starbird is a key reason that
Stanford remains the only
unbeaten team in the Pac-10,
but she receives plenty of help
from her teammates. Sopho
more forward Vanessa Nygaard
averages 15.8 points per game
and a team-high 7.3 rebounds
per game. Meanwhile, junior
point guard Jamila Wideman
has returned from an ankle
sprain to direct the Cardinal
offense.
Unfortunately for the Ducks,
however, life hasn't proven so
dandy at Oregon, where the
Ducks are still looking to break
into the Pac-10 win column
after two weekends of confer
ence play. Picked fifth in the
conference by preseason polls,
the Ducks won seven of their
first eight en route to an 8-2
non-conference record, but Pac
-10 play has been nothing short
of a nightmare.
The future looked promising
for Oregon in its conference
opener on Jan. 5. Before a
packed house in Corvallis, the
Ducks just narrowly missed an
upset, of then-No. 12 Oregon

State when point guard Cindie
Edamura's last-second pull-up
jumper caromed off the back of
the rim.
"We hung in there — we
fought and scratched and clawed
and had a chance to win," said
Oregon head coach Jody Runge
after the 58-57 heartbreaker.
"We asked the kids to focus on
playing defense well and that
kept us in the game."
However, after nearly upend
ing the Beavers, Oregon suf
fered a near-collapse last week
end against Washington and
Washington State. Plagued by
poor shooting down the stretch,
the Ducks lost to WSU 72-59 on
Thursday and then limped away

from a 88-62 embarrassment at
the hands of Washington on Sat
urday. With a 0-3 start in Pac-10
play, the Ducks now find them
selves in the conference cellar
alongside lowly Arizona State.
"We're getting the shots we
want," Runge said. "We're just
not putting them in the basket."
As if Oregon's shooting woes
weren't enough, Runge's squad
suffered another setback last
week when star forward Ari
anne Boyer was suspended for
what Runge described as a "dif
ference of opinion." Boyer led
the team with 18.4 points and
8.3 rebounds per game.

versus USC.
"The kids have come together
and are very team-oriented,"
Kunge said. "They arc willing to
do whatever they can to make
things happen. We're doing the
best with the kids we have. If Ari
anne wants to return and be part
of this team, we will welcome her
back with open arms."
In the meantime, the Ducks
will likely field a three-guard
offense with 5-9 sophomore
Kirsten McKnight filling the
vacancy in the starting lineup.
McKnight, who has started only
three games this season, will
team in the backcourt with

Edamura, a 5-6 junior, and fresh
man Lisa Bowyer. Center Renae
Fegent, a 6-3 senior, and junior
Betty Ann Boeving will battle
down low for Oregon.
While Oregon's three-guard
look could cause problems on
defense for Stanford's big lineup
(only the 5-6 Wideman is shorter
than 6 feet), it will also give
Nygaard, 6-3 forward Naomi
Mulitauaopele and 6-2 center
Olympia Scott an opportunity to
take it inside against the diminu
tive Ducks.
And if Starbird and Co. can't
do it on talent alone, at least Stan
ford will have history on its side
when it tips off tonight against
the Ducks. The Cardinal has
taken 16 straight from Oregon, a
streak dating back eight vears.
