# Wolters unbeatable in Milwaukee Classic
## Tournament also marks return of Salzenstein 
### Brian Auld 
At the Milwaukee Tennis
Classic, which took place in
Wisconsin from Jan. 8-13,
freshman Ryan Wolters proved
he deserved his seat atop the
Intercollegiate Tennis Associa
tion's national rankings of
men's singles players.
One month ago, Wolters
jumped from his preseason
rank of 75 all the way to No. 1
as a result of his victory in the
All-American Tourney at the
University of Texas in Austin.
This past week, Wolters
struck again.
Wolters overpowered five
opponents and dropped only
one set on his march to the Mil
waukee Classic semifinals,
whereupon he ran into Michi
gan's Peter Puszati. Puszati
captured the first set and led 5-
2 in the second before Wolters
mounted a comeback to win 4-6,
7-6 (10-8), 6-3. In that match,
Wolters successfully fended ofT
three match points.
"Ryan really struggled, but
somehow found a way to win in
that match," said assistant
coach John Whitlinger, who
coached the Cardinal in Mil
waukee. "If you can pull out a
match like that one, you've got
a good chance of winning the
whole thing."
Wolters did exactly that. The
finals lacked comeback the
atrics as Wolters routinely
defeated Louisiana State's Gus
Pernandes in straight sets 6-3,
6-3 and secured his second-con
secutive tournament champi
onship.
"I'm hitting my ground
strokes with a lot of consisten
cy," Wolters said. "That consis
tency has really paid off for
me."
Indeed, Wolters, 23-1 thus
far on the season, suffered his
only loss to sophomore team
mate Paul Goldstein in the
finals of the Rolex Regional

Championships at San Jose
State early in the year. "I didn't
expect to be winning these
national events, so I'm definite
ly pleased," Wolters said. "I'm
actually surprised to be doing so
well."
Head coach Dick Gould is not
as shocked by Wolter's aston
ishing start. "I've been coaching
for too long to get surprised by
something like this," said
Gould, Stanford's coach for the
past 30 years. "Ryan has been
one of the top two in his age
group, and he's a pretty darned
good player. Of course, for him
to come in as a freshman and do
what he has done is remark
able."
But Gould assures tennis
fans that Wolters' early success
has not caused him to lose
focus. "Ryan's ranked No. 1 in
the country right now, hut it
hasn't gone to his head," he
said. "He's still working hard,
trying to improve his weakness
es. He's not wrapped up in the
rankings."
The Milwaukee tournament
also witnessed the return of
senior team captain Jeff Salzen
stein to collegiate tennis.
Salzenstein, the preseason No.
1 player in the nation, spent
most of the past summer and
fall away from the college game
to try his hand on the pro cir
cuit. Unfortunately for Salzen
stein, he was plagued by
injuries and had not had any
serious match play since Octo
ber.
In spite of his rustiness, how
ever, Salzenstein entered as the
top seed in the tournament and
advanced to the semifinals,
where he fell at the hands of
Fernandes in a close, three-set
match 7-5, 2-6, 6-4.
"Jeff did a great job and
played better and better each
match," Whitlinger said. "We
got exactly what we needed out
of him, and I'm very happy with
his play."
Seniors Ricky Becker and Jim
Thomas also performed well, as
each advanced to the quarterfi
nals. Thomas also teamed up
with Wolters in doubles competi
tion. Despite the fact that they
had never played together before,

the tandem progressed to the
finals before losing in three sets
to a team from LSU.
The Milwaukee tournament
has given Could and Whitlinger a
lot to look forward to as Stanford
begins the regular season. "Ryan
has given us a real shot in the
arm," Gould said. "He's added a
whole new dimension to this
team that we weren't certain we
would have. Right now, we just
have to keep playing good ten
nis."
