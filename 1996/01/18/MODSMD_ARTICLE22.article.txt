### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Twelve games into the season,
the Stanford men's basketball
team is having about as much
success on the road as a traveling
Coppertone salesman stuck in
New England.
Only 2-4 away from Maples
Pavilion, the No. 24 Cardinal (8-4
overall, 2-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) returns to the depths of
Maples madness for a game
against Oregon (9-5, 2-1) at 7:30
p.m. tonight. Stanford is a perfect
6-0 at home this year.
"At home, you have to win and
then go out and get what you can
on the road," said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "We had a
opportunity to win both games
last week. To say we should have
won, I'm not so sure. That's look
ing at things with a preseason
view and expectations."
The Cardinal is a different
team at home when it comes to
shooting percentages. At Maples,
Stanford hits 48.7 percent of its
field goals. On the road, however,
that percentage dips to 38.6.
Three-point percentages span an
even wider range, from 38.4 per
cent at home to 22.6 on the road.
"You talk about how it should
be the same because (he court is
the same," said junior Rich Jack
son. "There's just something
about being familiar with your
surroundings, sleeping in your
own bed and having your own
schedule."
As for preparing for Oregon,
the Cardinal is already quite
familiar with the Kansas/North
Carolina system that the Ducks
run. A lot of movement and back
screens looking for the easy, open
shot keys Oregon's offensive
scheme.
"They've got nothing in terms
of size like USC or UCLA," Mont
gomery said. "But every game is
going to be a tough ball game, and
winning or losing will be based on
performance."
Montgomery also noted that
Oregon will pressure full court
after made baskets and dead-ball
situations, as the Ducks are ath

Stanford will look for the same home-court magic tonight against Oregon.
