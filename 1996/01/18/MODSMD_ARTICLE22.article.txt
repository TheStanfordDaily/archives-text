# Men's hoops hopes to snap losing streak vs. Oregon
## 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Twelve games into the season,
the Stanford men's basketball
team is having about as much
success on the road as a traveling
Coppertone salesman stuck in
New England.
Only 2-4 away from Maples
Pavilion, the No. 24 Cardinal (8-4
overall, 2-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) returns to the depths of
Maples madness for a game
against Oregon (9-5, 2-1) at 7:30
p.m. tonight. Stanford is a perfect
6-0 at home this year.
"At home, you have to win and
then go out and get what you can
on the road," said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "We had a
opportunity to win both games
last week. To say we should have
won, I'm not so sure. That's look
ing at things with a preseason
view and expectations."
The Cardinal is a different
team at home when it comes to
shooting percentages. At Maples,
Stanford hits 48.7 percent of its
field goals. On the road, however,
that percentage dips to 38.6.
Three-point percentages span an
even wider range, from 38.4 per
cent at home to 22.6 on the road.
"You talk about how it should
be the same because (he court is
the same," said junior Rich Jack
son. "There's just something
about being familiar with your
surroundings, sleeping in your
own bed and having your own
schedule."
As for preparing for Oregon,
the Cardinal is already quite
familiar with the Kansas/North
Carolina system that the Ducks
run. A lot of movement and back
screens looking for the easy, open
shot keys Oregon's offensive
scheme.
"They've got nothing in terms
of size like USC or UCLA," Mont
gomery said. "But every game is
going to be a tough ball game, and
winning or losing will be based on
performance."
Montgomery also noted that
Oregon will pressure full court
after made baskets and dead-ball
situations, as the Ducks are ath

letic and deep in the backcourt.
Should Stanford manage to
break Oregon's press (and judg
ing by Brevin Knight's past suc
cess against most pressure, the
Cardinal will), the resulting
transition baskets could help any
residual shooting woes from last
weekend.

'At home, you have
to win and then go
out and get what
you can on the
road.'
— Mike Montgomery

"It's going to be an up-tempo
game, so when we break the
press, we'll have three-on-two
situations, four-on-three, two
on-one, and that's a great situa
tion when Brevin has the ball,"
Jackson said. "It seems like our
defense always generates our
offense, and if we get out on the
fast break, we'll get some easy
baskets. Then our offense seems
to take off more in the half-court.
You just get in a rhythm."
Like Stanford, Oregon is
stuck in the middle of what is
shaping up as a battle in the Pac

10. Unlike the Cardinal, the
Ducks had to replace four
starters from a team that went to
the NCAA Tournament for the
first time in 34 years.
Super-quick point guard
Kenya Wilkins returns as the
only familiar face on the Oregon
roster. The junior averages 15.7
points, 6.1 assists and 2.6 steals
per game. Last year, Knight held
Wilkins to only four points while
scoring *28 in a 92-87 Stanford
win at home.
Despite the loss of eight
seniors, however, the Ducks have
not inserted inexperienced fresh
men into their lineup. Bolstered
by two transfers from UC-Santa
Barbara, Kyle Milling and Rob
Ramaker, Oregon has plugged
competent players into an
already solid system.
Milling has been a pleasant
surprise for the Ducks, as he
leads the team in rebounding
(8.1 rebounds per game) and is
second in scoring (15.1 points per
game). A 6-foot-8 junior, he
earned 1993 Big West Freshman
of the Year honors as a Gaucho.
With Milling and Ramaker
starting down low, the Ducks use
a three-guard rotation of
Wilkins, Jamar Curry and Jamal
Lawrence. Oregon leads the Pac
-10 in three-point field goals
attempted (298) and made (102).
Freshman Terik Brown, the son
of former Seattle SuperSonic
"Downtown" Freddie Brown, is
the first guard off the bench and
has hit seven three-pointers in
one game this season.
