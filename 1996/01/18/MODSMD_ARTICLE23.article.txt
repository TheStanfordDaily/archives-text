# Gymnasts come up short at Spartan Open
## Defending national champion men finish second to California 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
Despite entering last weekend's Spartan
Open at San Jose State as both the No.l team
in the country as well as the defending nation
al champion, Stanford men's gymnastics came
up short, falling 225.5-220.4 to rival Califor
nia.
Six schools competed in the tournament,
including Cal, San Jose, UC-Santa Barbara,
Washington, Cal-Poly San Luis Obispo and
Stanford. All hail from the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation.
"Berkeley is very good," said sophomore
Tim Dalrymple. "They are going to be one of
our major competitors, although I think that
later in the season, we are going to be able to
beat them." Dalrymple captured first place in
the all-around competition with a score of
56.95.
"This early in the season, everyone is going
to struggle, and the team obviously struggled
this weekend," Dalrymple said. "You don't
want to peak too early."

Junior captain Keith Wiley placed seventh
all-around with a 54.8-point performance and
Jamie Ellis finished 10th with 54.1 points.
Sophomore Clarence Miao won the floor exer
cise.
This year's Cardinal hopes to win back-to
back titles without the services of two of last
season's key competitors — graduated seniors
Evan Wells and Josh Stein. Wells specialized in
the parallel bars and pommel horse. All-around
competitor Stein placed third in the NCAA
Tournament last year and second the year
before.
"Josh Stein was a big loss, but I think we will
be able to overcome that loss," Dalrymple said.
Coach Sadao Hamada must also compensate
graduation losses with a relatively small
recruiting class. Only two new gymnasts have
stepped onto the Farm — David Ludlow from
Nevada and Scott Finklestein from New Jer
sey. Unfortunately for Stanford, Ludlow
underwent back surgery in December, while
Finklestein broke a bone in his hand during a
recent practice.
However, the Cardinal will benefit from the

entrance of red-shirt freshman Jeremy Her
man, now fully recovered from surgery necessi
tated by a torn anterior cuciate ligament. He
competed on the pommel horse, parallel bars
and high bars last weekend.
"For my first NCAA performance, 1 was sat
isfied, and I thought it was a good indication of
how the season for me would be," Herman said.
Despite its slow start, small recruiting class,
injuries and loss of key players, Stanford still
expects to live up to its billing.
"The team doesn't have as much depth as
last year, but I still believe that we are the most
talented team in the nation, and when our top
guys hit |their routines], then we should be
right on top again," Dalrymple said.
Stanford has won the NCAA Tournament
three out of the last four years, and its only
NCAA-Tournament loss in those four years
came at the hands of Nebraska, who placed sec
ond in the three years the Cardinal reigned
supreme.
"We are very intense in the gym and we are
very serious about repeating as champions,"
Herman said.
