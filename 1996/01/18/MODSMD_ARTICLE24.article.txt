### John Fabian Staff writer 
After a layoff from competition
since the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships in November, the
Stanford men's swimming team
is eager to sink Arizona State and
Arizona tomorrow and Saturday
at deGuerre Pool.
"Results are starting to trickle
in from around the country," said
senior Scott Gagner. "There were
a lot of big meets last weekend.
We're ready to show people what
we have in stock for them at
NCAAs."
While many students relaxed
during winter break, Cardinal
swimmers returned to school after
a 12-day break to begin two-a-days.
"Everybody came back in good
shape and made it through train
ing fine," Gagner said. "It's been
good working with the post-grads

Men's swimming busts out of its winter hibernation this weekend in its homestand against Arizona State
and Arizona.
I Kurt Grote, Tyler Mayfield,
Derek Weatherford, Jeff Rouse
and Brian Rettererl who are
training for the Olympic Trials."
With the Olympic Trials com
ing March 6-12, the whole season
has been thrown slightly off
track. For one, the Pac-10 meet
took place in the fall (Nov. 25-27)
rather than in the spring. Second,

those who plan to try out had to
change their training schedules to
be ready sooner, concentrating
more on speed and less on
endurance.
In any event, however, Stan
ford welcomes this weekend's
opportunities to see if its fresh
men can consistently turn in the
kind of performances they posted
in November against California
and at the Pac-10 meet. Accord
ing to initial indications at least,
Tate Blahnik, Dud Wales, Matt
O'Mara, Justin Ewers and Blake

I lolden are all ready to become
contributors for the Cardinal.
"The freshmen are doing
tremendously well," Gagner said.
"They're going to be a big factor
points-wise in these dual meets
and leading into NCAAs."
The home meets against the
Wildcats and Sun Devils offer the
Cardinal a chance to start off the
dual-meet season on the right
foot and get the ball rolling
towards NCAAs.
Tomorrow's meet against the
Sun Devils will be a regular, short

short course dual meet. The short
course helps swimmers get back
into the competitive frame of mind.
Against the Wildcats, the Cardinal
will switch to a long-course compe
tition to help its athletes prepare
for the Olympic Trials.
Arizona will compete without
the services of Chad Carvin.
Carvin is an NCAA champion and
one of the nation's best distance
swimmers. Unfortunately for the
Wildcats, he had to end his career
this year when doctors discovered
he had a heart problem.
