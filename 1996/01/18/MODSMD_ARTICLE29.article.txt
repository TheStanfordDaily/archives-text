# Grub Focus on: King's Table
## Knights of the King's Table 
### Experimental Food Group (featuring Arnold Pan 
The Experimental Food Group (The
E.F.G.) explores new forms of eating. The
preferred mode of dining is the buffet. Its co
pious assortment of foods is designed with
the purpose of experimental eating in mind.
The buffet line inspires in its juxtaposition of

tastes; for example, it merges the taco bar
with hand-sliced ham.
In our collective search for innovative cui
sine, the E.F.G. convened at King's Table in
Sunnyvale. Our visit was presaged by visions
of Arthurian splendor, of club-like turkey
legs and kingly seating and dank, medieval
decor. Such a smorgasbordian environment
is conducive for our mission.
However, the table of the king offers no
such embarrassment of riches. A "Miami
Vice"-esque neon sign of green and pink
stands at the entrance, a harbinger of the
poor, unexceptional fare within the mall-se
curity gates. The furnishings are spare,
booths and stray tables rather than the brutal
elegance of a sovereign's court.
The promises of experimentation and all
you-can-eat living were dashed with the wilt
ed lettuce and the dicey potato salad; at a
$7.50 price tag, quality is as necessary as
quantity. Proceeding down the line, the

bland selections include a standard cafeteria
menu, from soggy bread to tasteless mashed
potatoes to greasy meat offerings to some
soups to the aforementioned ham at the end
of the circuit.
The first round of heaped dishes con
firmed all suspicions of King's Table. The
fried chicken tasted no different than the en
tree of a "Hungry Man" meal; the processed
mashed potatoes with watery gravy and ker
neled corn completed the TV dinner ensem
ble. The elementary-school pizza was less
palatable. The ham proved the most disap
pointing of all the dishes, with its spongy
consistency and bits of plastic wrapping left
on the edges of the meat.
Round two: The E.F.G. conceded that the
King's Table experience would be no more
than a test of endurance and mass consump
tion. Only the simplicity of boiled cabbage
and rice made the cut. The cabbage's bland,
watery "flavor" was refreshingly weak and

gave the group the resolve to continue. Un
fortunately, that led one member to sample
the chili, that pastiche of puny beans and
amber meat pellets.
Dessert delivered the knockout blow. The
serving trays held the last scraps of what
E.F.G. investigators hypothesized was cob
bler; however, no member could make a
positive identification, as no one dared to
taste test the traces of red and yellow goos.
The self-serve frozen yogurt was no more
appetizing than the empty cobbler contain
ers looked; the swirls of iced confection
were granular and chalky, instead of smooth
and creamy.
