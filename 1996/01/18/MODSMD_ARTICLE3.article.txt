### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Stanford Prof. John William
Hanbery died Jan. 1 -1 at his home in
Atherton. He was 76.
After a lengthy career at the
University that spanned his under
graduate years through his term as
head of the Neurosurgery Depart
ment, Hanbery retired in 1989. He
continued working asa private con
sultant until 1994.
Hanbery was born in Enid,

Okla., in 1919 and grew up in Long
Beach, Calif. In 1942, he graduated
from Stanford and married a class
mate, Shirley Wendt of San Jose.
Three years later, he received his
medical doctoral degree, also from
Stanford.
The class time was followed by a
residency at the Stanford Universi
ty 1 lospital and six years studying
at the McGill University Montreal
Neurological Institute.
In 1954, when Hanbery re
turned to San Francisco, he joined

Stanford Hospital as an assistant
professor of neurosurgery, later
shifting to a position as clinical as
sistant professor and joining the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic.
It was in these first few years
that longtime friend Dr. George
Koenig first met Hanbery.
Koenig was a medical student in
1958 and took some lectures on
neurosurgery from Hanbery. He
gave lectures "which were ab
solutely wonderful," Koenig said.
"They were so well-organized and
crystal clear that we all sat there
with our mouths open."

Hanbery
accepted a posi
tion as clinical prr>-
fessor of neuro
surgery in 1961,
helping to estab
lish Stanford's
neurosurgery
training program.
By 1964, he was a
full professor and

executive head of the Division of
Neurosurgery.
Twenty-six residents completed
the now nationally recognized
training program between 1961
and 1989.
Grateful students established
The Hanbery Society in 1974 in
recognition of his help in their
careers â€” a move that Koenig said
was hut a token of the thanks Han
bery had earned.
Koenig remembered "the way
he got personally involved in vour

development as a neurosurgeon.
He guaranteed personally that you
would learn the technical skills
needed," he said.
More than that, Hanbery
offered personal support for the
students. "He was a really neat
guy," Koenig said. "You could
relate to him on every level.
"I think everyone in the neuro
surgery program really felt they
were part of the Hanbery family.
He returned at least as much as he
S ot "
Koenig is survived by his wife
of 53 years, Shirley; daughters
Carol MacKay of Austin, Texas,
Janet MacKenzie and husband
James of Atherton, Calif., and
Lynn Fuller of Albany, Calif.; son
John Hanbery of San Francisco;
sister Virginia Dickie and husband
Charles of Long Beach; and five
grandchildren.
A memorial service will be held
in Memorial Church at 2 p.m. on
Feb. 3. In lieu of flowers, the fami
ly requests donations be sent to
