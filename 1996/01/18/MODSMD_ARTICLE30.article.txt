## A 						NEW ERA OF COLLABORATIVE FILMMAKING

t is ironic that Krzysztof Kieslowski's "The
Double Life of Veronique" steeled inde
pendent filmmaker Robert Miller's re
solve to pursue his love of film and make it
his life's work. In that film, two women lead
parallel lives not knowing the other existed
until Veronique understands that Veronika
lives a life which appeals neither to herself
nor to Veronique. Miller made a similar rev
elation, leaving his job of six years at Stan
ford in August 1994 to do filmmaking full
time.
In a screening room that fit a little over
100 people, viewers saw nine short films
Dec. X at the IMAGE (Independent
Media Artists Group) film festival, in
cluding the world's first all-digital live
action film, "Mail Bonding," made by
Miller. IMAGE, hosted this year at DeAn
za College in Cupertino, is a venue fea
turing the works of up-and-coming film
makers.
"The dream is to be able to make the
movie you want to make and not have peo
ple derail you," said Miller. His words of ad
vice did not fall on deaf ears among his peers
at the festival.
Cooperation was the main theme run
ning through the selections at the festival.
Without the networking that goes on at film
festivals, projects like Miller's would not be
possible. Independent filmmakers already
fight an uphill battle with production costs,
editing tasks and finishing touches. They
need all the help they can get.
They learn from one another, passing
along tips and war stories. Robert Miller's
story is one example of the indie made good.

Robert Miller, a former journalist who
flew to Australia on a one-way ticket to
cover the America's Cup, came to Stanford
seven years ago and has been in Palo Alto
ever since.
Miller discovered that filmmaking was
more than a passing interest while working
as the multi-media coordinator of Stan
ford's Television Network (SITN), produc
ing videos for the computer science depart
ment. Then he got turned onto film and
never looked back.
Like many other filmmakers who have
yet to make the transition from a day job to
full-time filmmaker, necessity determined
that Miller hold his job until the time was
right. Miller worked to pay the bills while
learning about the film industry in his spare
time. Calling it "earn while you learn,"
Miller was able to translate his skills and in
tuitive savvy into a highly-successful cam
paign to make and circulate "Mail Bond
ing."
Miller did his homework once he realized
he wanted to make films, voraciously read
ing case studies about production, writing
screenplays and exploring his options. He
also knew that using film would run up as
tronomical costs, so he turned to digital
technology as an alternative.
"Film is prohibitively expensive," he said.
"Let's put it this way: Five-and-a-half hours
of footage (which turned into his 12-minute
short) would have cost $29,000 using 35
mm film. With the digital tape, it costs
$1,200."
"Productions hemorrhage money,"

Miller said. "I tried to plug as many holes as
I could through sponsorship
To make his film, Miller wove through
the intricacies of the solicitation process and
found powerful and wealthy sponsors who
were not convinced by the traditional sales
pitch, but by the benefits they had in store
should they support the project.
You see, Miller didn't ask them for
money.
Armed with a prospectus and business
plan, he sold himself and his project by pre
senting it as something that would most
benefit the companies he went after and
only asked for loans of equipment and ser
vices — the source of most expenses.
"I clearly showed them they would re
ceive publicity they could not buy," Miller
said. Among his sponsors were Sony (which
lent him one of only two Digital Betacam
camcorders), Apple Computers, Pacific
Video Resources and Avid.
"It was a fairy tale," Miller said when
asked about his big break. Hooking up with
Apple allowed Miller to show his film at the
1995 Sundance film festival at the Apple
CD-ROM exhibition area. Although a small
screen production, "Mail Bonding" has
given Miller the exposure he needs to move
onto his next project. The film has also been
shown at the New York Underground Film
Festival, the Los Angeles Independent Film
Festival and other venues.

"Mail Bonding" has a story every bit as
engaging as its technical background. Writ
ten by Alan Jacobs ("Nina Takes A Lover"),
a graduate of Stanford Business School, the
film has a compelling narrative element that
carried during the film festival. Shot mostly
in black and white, the suspense is kept high
when a chance meeting between a mysteri
ous mail carrier and a down-and-out writer
results in an off-beat romance. Color fanta
sy sequences inserted amidst the silent ac
tion showcases the clarity Miller was able to
achieve in this new medium.
The combination of different technolog
ical components and sponsors on the pro
ject is something student filmmakers strug
gling through production costs could look
to for guidance.

The connections that groups like IMAGE
provide are invaluable for the tightly-knit
filmmaking community. Fach meeting

brings together potential players and oppor
tunities. A member of IMAGE since its for
mation two years ago, Miller praised the
group. He is an advocate of the value of feed
back and input from his peers and organiza
tions like IMAGE which facilitate such inter
actions.
The end result is control — having a vi
sion and following through from beginning
to end, holding on tightlv to autonomy and
integrity along the way.
Miller's advice for up-and-coming film
makers is twofold. First, bond with the pro
duction house, keeping in mind that most
want an outlet for artistic expression and
love film for the same reasons the filmmak
er does. Second, find a mentor who is will
ing to mentor and work with you.
For the filmmaker, what Miller sees as
important is "to be passionate about the
material." He also advises that the filmmak
er needs to be "intelligent and responsible
about the execution of it."

Independent filmmakers go through a
long process before they see their produc
tions on the screen. Sometimes it takes up to
a year if not several years for a film to come
to fruition — past the writing, casting,
shooting, editing, post-production, before
the film is screened for an audience.
Organizations like IMAGE are like fami
lies, small at first and then expanding rapid
ly with in-laws, cousins and extended mem
bers. Based in Palo Alto, the organization is
rapidly attracting renowned and experi
enced professionals as well as enthusiastic
amateurs. Innovative techniques are also
premiering through IMAGE, as evidenced
by the January 1995 debut ot "Mail Bond
ing" at an IMAGE meeting.
"This is only IMAGE'S second film festi
val," said Sasha Parisot, whose film "Fluf"
was also screened. According to Parisot,
IMAGE will work on advertising for next
year's festival soon. The response from this
year's promised more offerings than the 20
entries that were received this year.
The end of 1995 brought with it promis
es of continued success in the film industry,
while the new year brings with it the reality
of pulling resources together to make those
dreams happen.
For now, Miller is off again to Park City,
Utah for the Sundance Film Festival, where
he will again show "Mail Bonding" and get
feedback for his next project.
