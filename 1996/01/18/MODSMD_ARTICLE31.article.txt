# Superchunk's dilemma: Here's where the fame comes in
## 
### Taylor Antrim 
Jim Wilbur, lead guitarist for Super
chunk, gropes for a song title on the
other end of the phone line.
"It's by Smashing Pumpkins. It's got
this really annoying refrain. Something
about a rat in a cage."

u 'Bullet with Butterfly
Wings'" 1 tell him.
"Right. I'm playing it, and I've
never even heard it. I don't listen to
the radio."
He's describing his side project:
an annual benefit concert for a
local Chapel Hill, NC, food bank.
He and his friends get together to
rehearse once a year.
"We cover buzz bin songs," he
tells me. "We butcher them. This
year, it was like, every single one of
these songs suck. It's not even fun.
It's not even fun to make fun of
these people."
I actually like the Smashing
Pumpkins song, but I keep that to
myself.
"I'm probably getting old and
curmudgeonly. The kids like it. Far
be it from me to tell them that
they're foolish and idiotic."
I could mention that Super
chunk's newest single, "Hyper
Enough,'' itself teeters precari
ously on the rim of the Smashing
Pumpkins-friendly buzz bin,
I'm a little taken aback, though.

too happy to slip into polite conversa
tion rather than into cross-examina
tion.
But Jim should have his snobbery read
back to him because there's a slight whiff
of hypocrisy here. Superchunk's favorite
formula ~~ three chords, a punch and a
siuile offer* little in the way of anti*
commercial revision. Superchunk is not
exactly mainstream, but it's dose. Jim
should Yess up to that. He should realize
his band's biggest credit is its easy-access
appeal.
Superchunk's latest album, "Here's
Where the Strings Come In," has slated
the band for success better than any of
their other albums in their six-year ca
reer. So I pass off Jim's elitism to growing
pains. He's probably nor ready to join
the dub yet; not comfortable with the
idea that a few years down the road some
upstart indie band might be parodying

In 1989,1ead singer Mac M«. Caughan en
listed Jim, a college friend, to play in the
then-embryonic Superchunk. Jim
joined Mac and bassist, Laura Ballance.
for what he thought would be a few
months. "It was just friendship," he says.
"1 certainly wasn't a good guitar player.
I'm still not." A year of touring and a

record deal from Matador later, Mac,
Laura and Jim lured Jon Wurster from
other local projects to complete the four
some.
Jim makes the whole thing sound hap
hazard and accidental. "At first we put out
seven inches and pressed 500 copies. Then
it was like, 'Matador's going to put out our
record, and we're going to go out on tour,"
and i was like,' tour, that's a big deal.' I re
ally only meant to ck> it for two months.
Whether it would work out T wasn't sure.
There was no plan. Everything sort of
happened."
Jim's low-pitched, lazy mumble com
municates the laid-back ethic he says plays
a part in the band's recording habits.
" i here s a catain attention between us
all in the band. We re just really used to
playing together. We write songs really eas
ily, and we manage to come up with mate
rial quickly. That just comes from pkymg
together a lot, knowing what to expect of

each other. I hate using words like chem
istry' and 'vibe,' but really that s what it iv
Superchunk can afford Jim's cool,
sang-froid demeanor. Mac MeCaughan
owns and runs Merge, Superchunk's par
ent independent record label, so there's no
boss hanging over the band's collective
shoulder.

"I just don't like major labels for their
ethics,'' Jim says. "1 don't think they're
very good at promoting records. I think
they take very few risks overall. There's a
lack of craft to what they do. At Merge, we
don't get big advances, but we get paid
reguiarlyand we get to keep the money we
make."
According to Jim, finances have been
getting better and better, but, he reports,
there's still some anxiety about the vol at ile
tastes of the indie rock community.
"J don't think about whether the
band's going to break up or not. 1 think
what would happen if people stopped lik
ing us enough to buy our records. There is
a stress to maintain your level of success,
whatever u may be. Sometimes 1 thujk it
could ail disappear. Audiences are fickle.
11l that sense I think about the tutu re.
We're getting bigger, but it's very gradual.
"I see these bands that come up that
didn't exist a war ago and now they're

huge. Very rarely do they last because its
sort of too much too soou, and rock and
roll cab its young. We resist that. We resist
the big leaps. But we do try to sell records.
We're not anti-commercial. The things
you're willing lo do to sell a record are the
things that we think about. 11
This seems to be in some way .1 kind ot

justification tor his earlier auti
mainstream bravado. He's situated
himself somewhere between hard
line integrity and sell-out oppor
tunism, and his sincerity convinces
me that his position is comfortable,
his footing sure.
/uperchunk's newest album should
V really be all the justification the
needs. "Here's Where the
Strings Come In" is an invigorating
blend of rock-and-roll histrionics
and relaxed experimentalism. lor
once Superchunk is wonderfully all
over the map, and past slander of
staid, by-rote conservatism seems
out of date.
"Everyone's the happiest with it,"
Jim says. "We sort of threw every
thing at the wall and whatever fell off,
fell off and whatever stuck, stuck.
Rather than saying 'organic,' I'll say
'nonchalant' We never sat down and
talked about what our artistic goals
were. We'd just say, 'That sounded
like shit.' That sort of thing."
1 suspect that the previously
"curmudgeonly" Jim might have
some gripes to share about Super-

chunks rising popularity. I ask about one
such problem spot: their billing on this
year's Loliapalooza second stage.
"I really didn't want to do it,"he savs,
sighing. 4< lt became a financial concern.
We needed the money. I really felt awk
ward about it. I totally expected to hate it.
But it turned out the people who were
running it were so cool and nice and
down to earth. It turned out to be one of
the best playing experiences that I've ever
been involved in."
How about that? Jim Wilbur, ardent
defamer of Smashing Pumpkin-esque
hysteria, actually enjoyed Loliapalooza.
Once again, I let it go. This lack of ac
countability is aft over their music; it's
last-paced and manic, with lyrical nods to
various adolescent melodramas. Full of
catch-me-if-vnti-can irony and altitude.
1 he best idea ts probably to Mop pursu
ing v to let Superchunk have their success
anv wav thev want.

But Jim should have his snobbery read
back to him because there's a slight whiff
of hypocrisy here. Superchunk's favorite
formula ~~ three chords, a punch and a

commercial revision. Superchunk is not
exactly mainstream, but it's dose. Jim
should Yess up to that. He should realize
his band's biggest credit is its easy-access
appeal.
Superchunk's latest album, "Here's
Where the Strings Come In," has slated
the band for success better than any of
their other albums in their six-year ca
reer. So I pass off Jim's elitism to growing
pains. He's probably nor ready to join
the dub yet; not comfortable with the

upstart indie band might be parodying

"1 certainly wasn't a good guitar player.
I'm still not." A year of touring and a

record deal from Matador later, Mac,
Laura and Jim lured Jon Wurster from
other local projects to complete the four

Jim makes the whole thing sound hap
hazard and accidental. "At first we put out
seven inches and pressed 500 copies. Then
it was like, 'Matador's going to put out our
record, and we're going to go out on tour,"
and i was like,' tour, that's a big deal.' I re

Whether it would work out T wasn't sure.
There was no plan. Everything sort of
happened."
Jim's low-pitched, lazy mumble com
municates the laid-back ethic he says plays
a part in the band's recording habits.

all in the band. We re just really used to

Superchunk can afford Jim's cool,
sang-froid demeanor. Mac MeCaughan

boss hanging over the band's collective
shoulder.

"I just don't like major labels for their
ethics,'' Jim says. "1 don't think they're
very good at promoting records. I think
they take very few risks overall. There's a
lack of craft to what they do. At Merge, we
don't get big advances, but we get paid
reguiarlyand we get to keep the money we
make."
According to Jim, finances have been
getting better and better, but, he reports,
there's still some anxiety about the vol at ile
tastes of the indie rock community.
"J don't think about whether the

How about that? Jim Wilbur, ardent

Jim Wilbur, lead guitarist for Super
chunk, gropes for a song title on the
other end of the phone line.
"It's by Smashing Pumpkins. It's got
this really annoying refrain. Something
about a rat in a cage."

u 'Bullet with Butterfly
Wings'" 1 tell him.
"Right. I'm playing it, and I've
never even heard it. I don't listen to
the radio."
He's describing his side project:
an annual benefit concert for a
local Chapel Hill, NC, food bank.
He and his friends get together to
rehearse once a year.
"We cover buzz bin songs," he
tells me. "We butcher them. This
year, it was like, every single one of
these songs suck. It's not even fun.
It's not even fun to make fun of
these people."
I actually like the Smashing
Pumpkins song, but I keep that to
myself.
"I'm probably getting old and
curmudgeonly. The kids like it. Far
be it from me to tell them that
they're foolish and idiotic."
