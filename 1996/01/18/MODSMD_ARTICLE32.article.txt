Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis arc togeth
er in a hospital for the mentally insane,
lb add to the sense of disruption and
schizophrenia, U I2 Monkeys" director
ferry (iilliam skews some ot his shots, so
that the audience sees the scene slightly
tilted, slightly diagonal.
"Yes, I was experimenting with those
shots," (.'iilliam said, pausing slightly to
express himself exactly. "But I wanted to
make sure not to go too far, I didn't want
them to be too much like M lA'." for
anyone who has seen the film, ii is oh\ i
oils tli.it Gilliam went just far enough,
creating the right mood in that scene,
and in many others, with his directorial
intuition and visual talent.
The unexpected interview
Who would have thought that
Gilliam would do a press tour: For
most Gilliam aficionado,s, who know
his Monty Python work and who are
familuu with "lime Bandits and
"Brazil. having the director advertise
his film within the Hollywood para
digjm would be defined out ot charac
ter. Gilliam began as a cartoonist, drew
for Monty Python, has written many
scripts and has directed plenty of films.
But he just does not seem the type to
do PR.
Nonetheless, on the last day of finals
F week in December, there was ( iilliam in
front of seven reporters, sitting comfort
ably in a private suite at the plush Ritz-
Carlton in downtown San Francisco.
Long-haired but clean-shaven, a know
ing smile crept onto his face when the
topic of his again working with Univer
sal Studios arose. It was the expee'ed
question.

The unexpected studio
Gilliam had major troubles
with I Jnivcrs.il Studios when they
refused to release his version of
"Brazil," a film he made in
which has three existing versions.
I he fate of (iilliam's version is still
apparently unknown.
When (iilliam answered the
query ol 'why Universal?' the
reporters seemed to breathe a
sigh ol relief. No one really
wanted to offend him, Init our
curiosity could not he kept at
ba\ "Well, the reason for work
ing with Universal is that they
know me In- now, (iilliam said,
almost jokingly, "and I don't
think they will make the same
mistakes. Plus, the president of
Universal Studios has been re
placed since "Brazil.
The unexpected stars
Unlike some of (iilliam's
films, this one boasts a star
studded cast. Willis stars .is
( ole, an unwilling volunteer

who is sent back in time from 2035 to I he
year 19% to try to save humanity from a
disease unleashed by the so called "Army
of the 12 Monkeys." Madeleine Stowe,
who Gilliam said "impressed him with
her intelligence," is the psychologist who
interns Willis and then starts to believe
him, just as he stops trusting himself.
I'itt does an intense job of portraying
Jeffrey Cioines, a man who Willis sus
pects is the leader ol the army. While .ill
these stars usualh make a director
proud, it seems they actually caused
some uncertainty for Gilliam.

"We're not sure what's going to hap
pen (when the film is released]," said
(iilliam. "Some people might go to see
the stars, and some to see it because it's
my film. Or, in the worst-case scenario,
my fans won't see it because ot the stars
and fans of Willis won't see it because it
seems too weird."
The unexpected success
At this point, Gilliam's worries have
most likely been quelled. His futuristic
dystopia, a description that has also
been used for "Brazil," opened in the top

spot and has sustained that run since its
release. Its momentum doesn't seem to
be slowing.
Despite, or maybe aside from, its
stars, "12 Monkeys" succeeds because
(iilliam succeeds. He serves up another
visually stunning and intellectually
mind-bending film, fare which die-hard
(no pun intended) tans have come to ex
pect and initiates will certainly enjoy.
Maybe the time is right for dystopias.
