## RANCID 
### 
as long as it has been around, punk
I rock lias belonged to the alienated, disil
lusioned and forgotten children of
America and the rest of the world. It has been a
place where it was OK tor you to look, dress and
think differently, a place that accepted you no
matter how strange or foreboding you appeared
to be.
Depending on when you start counting, the
beginnings of punk can be traced back to the
late '70s. It has always been the music of the un
derclass. The Clash were about being working
class and proud, the Sex I'istols were about
being angry and anarchistic. The music gave the
kids a sort of unity never before experienced. It
gave them something to belong to and some
thing to believe in. I ven it it was iust loud gui
tars.
The ironic thing now is that punk rock is "in."
Crunge has been replaced, flannel has given
way to ripped jeans and t shirts. Long hair has
given way to mohawks and loud guitars â€”well,
loud guitars will be a staple as long as there is
rock and roll, but the packaging ot alienation,
distrust and teen angst has recently become big
business.
Bands such as Creen Day, the Offspring,
Rancid, Pennvwiseand NoFX nov\ top the pop
ular charts. In particular, Rancid have become
sort of hometown heroes, considering that they
hail from Berkeley. Lirs Frederiksen (guitars
and vocals), Brett Reed (drums), Tim Arm
strong (vocals and guitar) and Matt freeman
(bass) comprise the band.
Rancid's sound is remarkably reminis
cent of the sound of earl\ punk stan
dards such as the Sex Pistols and, prob
ably more noticeably, the Clash. It was a sound
that seemed to vanish som; time around the
start of the HOs. I lowever, with Rancid's emer
gence on the popular music scene, it is safe to say
that punk never really went away; it simply hi
bernated. But as 112 rederiksen contends, while it
is flattering to be compared with those two leg
ends, it is also important to the band that they
are acknowledged as being original.
"That's cool because that's the music that we
grew up listening to," ex
plains Frederiksen. A

"| But] the (Hash and the Sex Pistols and bands
like that are just one of the 3,(XX) bands that
we've all seen and heard.... Most of the people
that want to compare us to the Clash have either
never heard our first two records or just read
everybody else's reviews... .We're not really too
bothered by it, but we have our own identity."
After some early recordings, Rancid released
their second I P, "Let's Co," on 1 pitaph Records
in June of 1994, and experienced heavy radio
play with the single "Salvation." Then in August
of 1995, they released their third I P "... And
Out ( onie the Wolves." The initial success from
"1 et's Co" carried over to this record and land
ed them a Bu// ( lip on MTV for the single
"Ruby Soho."
Between all the touring and recording, Fred
eriksen says he can think of no defining moment
for the recent attention. But even given their
new-found success, the band members remain
loyal to their roots, lifestyle and, most impor
tantly, to themselves. Rancid still retains the
strong willingness to work that enabled the
band to tour and record lor nearly the last four
years straight.
"What we are fortunate to have is a very big
work ethic," 112 rederiksen explains. "We will just
do it. We'll tour. We'll make the records. We'll do
those things. We'll get out and kick some ass.
We're not lazy people.
All the members ot Rancid come from
lower-middle-class environments. Frederiksen,
in particular, is from the town of Campbell,
( .il it. I le grew up in one of the two low-income
housing projects in the city and credits this to es
tablishing his work ethic.
"I think it's just because of the way we all grew
up." he says. "We all grew up in sort of working
Jass families.... When you're a kid and you're
growing up and you watch your mom or your
dad work their ass off to bring home to support
two kids or three kids or whatever the case may
be, 1 think that sort of sticks with you.
most people, Rancid exists merely as
I an emblem of the current punk rock fad.
But to the band members, Rancid is
something far less superficial than that.
"The most important thing in this band is
the friendship," says Frederik-

sen. "The band and
the music and what
ever, 1 wouldn't say

comes second, but I'm just saying that the
friendship has always been the most important
thing. If something happens where we're not
being friends then it's time tor us to break up."
For the members of Rancid, the band ex
tends beyond just something to do. It is their
family. This extreme loyalty can only be ex
plained by looking back to the band's begin
nings.
Rancid formed sometime in 1991, after the
demise of freeman's and Armstrong's original
ska band, Operation Ivy. Frederiksen was re
cruited six months later. With Armstrong a
long-time alcoholic and Frederiksen a heroin
user, the band had a rocky start. Frederiksen re
counts how the band helped him out ofhis situ
ation.
"From where 1 was at the time I was pretty
fucked up," he says."I mean it's happened to all
of us, I think, in this band. As far as, like Tim
I Armstrong], four \ ears ago the kid was living in
a fucking Salvation Arm\ homeless shelter.... I
was living in some fucked-up place high on
heroin and fuckin digging myself into an early
grave before I got into this band.
"I iust think that it gave me a little more hope
as far as in life because the music gave me some
thing to believe in again. The band gave me
something to believe in. As far as gaining a fam
ily with these guvs I think is probably the most
important thing. Caining the friendship, be
cause I never had friendship quite the way I have
with these guys. Not only music but just them as
people helped save my life. Especially Tim, he
helped me out incredible amounts."
The loyalty between the members of Rancid
is defining for the band. Without the bond de
veloped during the unstable beginnings, it is
doubtful that the band would be where it is
today. It has carried them over the rocky road to
success.
Rancid has recently come under attack as
a "sell-out" band, losing credibility.
Adding fire to the debate was Rancid's
consideration of a $1.5 million major-label
record contract. Although the band eventually
decided to stay with the

smaller Ipitaph label, some die-hard punks
were screaming "sell-out " at the band for even
entertaining the notion. The band's reasons for
staying with I pitaph ran deeper than money
and fame, l ike most things with Rancid, the de
cision was centered around loyalty and love.
"It was just more of a spiritual decision, I
think. 1 mean, we just wanted to stay where we
were loved," I rederiksen says. "We were only
human. We were iust seeing what else was out
there. We didn't want to totally narrow down
our options and be narrow minded with
life.... 1 think at the end of the day when it was
all said and done, [F.pitaph owner] Brett C.ure
wit/ just basically said that he loved us. And
that's all it really took"
liven amidst all of these accusations, the
members of Rancid have retained a nonchalant
attitude of self-reliance characteristic ot their
beginnings.
"I don't really give a shit what people think
about what we do as a band or what they want
to call us or whatever," I rederiksen savs. "I mean
we're just making music and that's important
for us. It doesn't really matter what people think
about y0u.... It"we want to sign to a major label
then that's what we'll fucking do. If we want to
make a full rap record then that's what we're
gonna do. We always live by the gut instinct,
honesty and realness.... People want to call us
this and call us that. Man, people have been call
ing me tucking names lor years, all of us. What,
now it's going to hurt me or something? No it
just makes it stronger.
So even with new and unexpected success,
not much has changed for Rancid. I lie
four still live in Berkeley when they're not
touring. Their lifestyle has not changed drasti
cally. Their fashion sense certainly has not
changed. But most importantly, their dedica
tion to punk rock as an ideology has not
changed.
"1 don't really see myself different than any
one. None us do. Punk rock was invented to
break down all the hero worship and crap like
that," he explains. "I think a lot of people do un
derstand that there's a lot more to it than fuckin'
just the Buzz Clip on MTV.

I heres a lot more to
u5.... Just because
we're in a band, we're

touring and we're popular doesn't mean we're
going to change our lives drastically.... If I
started driving Ferraris and having big houses
with chicks with liposuction and fake boobs
then yeah, talk to me, but right now I'm just the
same guy."
And the band members can never forget why
they love punk rock in the first place. Through
out their lives, the music has been the only thing
that has always been there for them. The music
was there any time they needed solace or any
time they felt like they didn't belong. To para
phrase Rancid s "Radio," it gave them a place to
go. C>n the new album,"... And Out (lome the
Wolves," the song "Roots Radical' alsoconcerns
just that topic.
"It's about kind of feeling alienated and
tucked-up and just like the only thing that you
really got is the music when you came home,"
explains I rederiksen. "The only thing that
made you feel like you had a friend was the
records.... I mean none of us really had friends
growing up. We always had our records, you
know. I hose were my best lriends for many,
many years."
Most importantly, through all ot their
ordeals, Rancid members have come
to realize that when it comes down to
it, the only tiling in this world that truly matters
to them is them. In a world where their success
will live and die by popular trends, the members
maintain their loyalty to Rancid and more im
portantly to one another.
" There was a time when the only people that
were happy with us were us," Trederiksen says.
"Everybody from fucking record companies to
the media to friends to family to your fucking
girlfriend to whatever had an opinion about
what the fuck you were doing. Whether it was
good or bad, everybody had opinion about
what we were doing.
"We sort of realized that the only people that
really mattered were the four of us. This is our
life, you know."
