## FRANK BLACK The Cult of Ray 
### 
Charles Thompson was the fat kid who sat
in the hack of the class, ate paste and came to
every I lalloween party dressed as a character
112 rom Star Trek. Perhaps as an attempt to out
grow th.it stigma, he recreated himself as
Black Francis, rhythm guitarist and lead
c rooner of the late '80s availt punk-mega-in
fluential underground-near-success of the
Pixies. After more than five years in thischar
acter, he disappeared only to return this time
as 1 rank Black, sell proclaimed " Teenager ot
the Year."
His third album, " The Cult of Ray" on
American Recordings, opens with Black ask
ing us "If you wanted to get somewhere and
it took you .1 long time to get there, would
you rush back here?" Or maybe it would be
more correct to say that he's asking himself
this question because he goes on to answer it
with "I didn't think so."
It is an appropriate question to ask since
it is apparent that with this new album,
Frank Black is taking decisive steps toward
his inevitable persona: a rock and roll star
— or at least in his dreams. That's because
T'rank Black is as much of a rock and roll
star as Bruce Springsteen is a post-punk vi
sionary. But then again, it can't hurt to
dream.
The "Cult of Ray" is nothing more than
straight-forward rock and roll. Nothing
could characterize this transformation more
than the fact that the same man whose idea of
a love song consisted of lyrics like "I ley, been
tryin' to meet you / Hey, must be a devil be
tween us / or whores in my head / whores at
my door / whores in my bed" now has a song
entitled "I Don't Want to Hurt You" with the
chorus "1 don't want to hurt you / Every sin
gle time, no /1 just seem to hurt you / Every
single time."
That 's not to say the new album isn't good.
It is quite good in fact. Songs like "Punk Rock
City" and "Jesus Was Right" drive and pulse
in perfect pop-noise nirvana. The problem is
that it just seems so obvious. From his tin

ker ings with the Pixies to his fascination with
UFOs, we've just come to expect so much
more from Frank / Charles / Black — what
ever his name is. So, in a world where rock
and roll will live forever, Frank Black will not.
With " The Cult of Ray," he's acknowl
edged the relative merits of nostalgia. A little
bit more for the Pixies couldn't hurt.
