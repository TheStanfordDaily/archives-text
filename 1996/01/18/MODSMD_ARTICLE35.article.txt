# SPIRITUALIZED
## Pure Phase 
### 
Musical eclecticism can he
a difficult issue. While
hands like Velvet Under
ground and artists like Neil
Young have made brilliantly
eclectic music, embracing
numerous styles and diverse
instrumentation, the path
has become a dead end for
many, many groups. Stress
ing musical experimenta
tion over good songwriting,
the music can be as aggra
vating as it is enlightening.
"Pure Phase," a new album
by the Spiritualized, pro
vides an excellent example
of this problem. The music
is ambitious and varied, but
the work never becomes a

cohesive whole.
The songs are an exercise in thick, tex
tured pop music similar to the work of
Smashing Pumpkins. The trio of Jason, Kate
Radley and Sean Cook, along with their
many associates, employ an enormous musi
cal palette, using everything from a string
quartet to a dulcimer to a farfisa, to create a
very unique experience.
Nevertheless, one is left with the impres

sion that the band is too eclectic for its own
good. Despite their mastery of a full range of
instruments and styles, the songs often wan
der down a path leading nowhere. One is im
pressed by the band, but not by the music.
The first track, "Medication," starts pleas
antly enough with an airy synthesized organ
line which is as catchy as it is entrancing.
Soon, however, the song descends into aural
chaos as the band's control of the track's
hook slowly slips away from them.
Another track, "Let It Flow," begins with a
rapturous background vocal line which
seems to foreshadow a truly great song. Un
fortunately, the lead vocals never even come
close to reaching their potential, meandering
in boredom for about live minutes until the
track comes to a very disappointing conclu
sion.
The real tragedy is that Spiritualized suc
ceeds brilliantly at almost everything they do
try to accomplish. On "Spread Your Wings,"
the band tries for a cathartic track and do re
markably well. A gorgeous violin solo carries
the song over the top and suggests that Spiri
tualized may truly be capable of a great
album.
Unfortunately for them, the great irony of
"Pure Phase" may be that its grasp somehow
exceeds it reach.
