# OASIS (What's the Story) Morning Glory
## 
### 
Hailed as "'the next Fab Four" and pro
claimed as the best band in Britain, one
would think that Oasis are getting too big for
their britches. But don't be too quick to dis
count the media hype surrounding this stel
lar band. On "(What's the Story) Morning
Glory," Oasis' sequel to their hugely success
ful debut, "Definitely Maybe," the band ef
fortlessly yet superbly sings its way through
50 minutes of soulful rock, dispelling the
myth of the sophomore jinx.
Oasis, who have the admirable quality of
making each single 10 times better than the
previous, have done it again. On "Wonder
wall," this album's first single, the euphoric


ballad slinks the listener into a rousing state
of nostalgia. Meanwhile, on the title track,
the band blitzes the listener with furious gui
tars and drums while enchanting with hedo
nistic lyrics ("All your dreams are
made / When you're chained to the mirror
and the razor blade / Today's the clay that the
world will see").
While other rock bands center their works
011 gritty, heart-pounding instrumentals,
Oasis carefully construct their masterpieces
around Liam Gallagher's irresistible vocals.
Gallagher's vocals evoke images of John
Lennon's eternal voice — the timeless,
breathtaking feel. The vocals delightfully
linger like a beautiful sundown which never
sets. Noel Gallagher's riffs, spontaneous and
exciting, are seamlessly threaded with each
I.iam croon, resulting in a fine patchwork ol
aural pleasure.
All too often, critics and tans alike are
quick to dub a young, upstart band as the
next Beatles. But this time, it seems as il they
may have gotten it right, but Oasis does not
simply duplicate the style of the original 1 ab
Four or mindlessly rehash the popular rock
motifs of today. Instead, their romantic vo
cals and deft instrumentals and the (iallagher
brothers' notorious on-stage tussles have cre
ated something different, something new
something that's distinctively Oasis.
