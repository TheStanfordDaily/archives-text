## RED RED MEAT Bunny Gets Paid 
### 
According to the press kit, Red Red Meat's
last album was about "wanting something,'

Thursday, January 18,1996

while their new album, "Bunny Gets Paid," is
about "having something and not knowing
what to do with it."
Whatever, it all comes down to being sad,
and Red Red Meat are better than just about
anybody at it. With an emotional strength
that most sad songwriters have long given up
on and an instrumental spaciousness that
most bands simply aren't capable of, these
downcast songs have substance, even as they
seem hopelessly muddled and buried within
their own sound.
"Ghain Ghain Ghain" is the album's pop
song, with a sturdy verse-chorus-verse struc
ture that's only slightly covered in atmos
pheric lu//. Vocalist Tim Rutili sounds char
acteristically tattered and worn, and this is
him at his most peppy.
(",atchy as it is, "Ghain C !hain Chain" is ac
tually a comparatively weak spot, as the
group's best stuff is the stuff that wanders
slowly on the verge of falling apart. With de
liberate pop hooks hidden amongst shreds of
acoustic and electric guitar, Red Red Meat
create messy masterpieces with what would
be average ballad material in the hands of
most bands.
"Carpet of Horses," "Buttered" and
"Gauze" deliver fine images with an exhaust
ed beauty, both rugged and frail at the same
time, while "Rosewood, Wax, Volt/. + Glitter"
is a classic junkyard of guitar noise, brutish
rhythms and stubbornly scrambled vocals.
The arrangements here .ire purposefully
sloppy and comfortably loose, as this is a
band more content drifting apart than stick
ing together.
Still, more than any of the individual
songs themselves, the appeal of this album
lies in its wallowing pace, artful production
.mil iauued improvisation. Better than anv ol

their previous work, "Bunny Gets Paid"
clings together with a steady character that's
richly talented, wintiingly patient and
h ear t wren ch i ngl y co n fused.
