# THE 						EMBARRASSMENT Heyday 1979-1983
## 
### 
By most historical records, the late-'7os
Kansas underground didn't offer much in the
way of a bustling music scene, and that might

be just what made the Embarrassment so
special.
A mostly forgotten midwestern punk-pop
quartet, the Embarrassment made music
from the middle of nowhere about being in
the middle of nowhere — celebrations of
happy independence tainted with a persis
tent, spooked loneliness — ultimately creat
ing great songs that demanded far more than
the hopeless obscurity they'd always seem
destined for.
Finally, the Embarrassment have been
honored with a long-overdue two-disc retro
spective, "Heyday 1979-1983," featuring over
two hours of the groups finest moments. The
first disc contains "The Standards," mostly
material from out-of-print albums and sin
gles. The second offers "The Scarcities," rang
ing from top-notch B-sides to random live
tracks recorded in "Jerry's Farm" in rural
Kansas.
Disc one is the band at their best, making
surprisingly complex songs about odd topics
like "Fli/.abeth Montgomery's lace," seeing
Art ( barney at an artistic party and an obnox
ious guy named Scott who drives around in
his Trans Am yelling"! ley, get outta my way /
I haven't had any sex all day."
"Wellsville" would be a great TV jingle,
while "Two Cars" and "Age Five" showcase
the quirky pop smarts that groups from the
Ramones to They Might Be Giants have
made careers out of.
Disc two is only slightly less impressive.
"Two-Week Vacation" could be the band's
catchiest song, wondering "where can I go,
what can 1 do" before blasting through re
peated choruses of "I don't want to sing
about love again."
Their cover of Led Zeppelin's "Immi
grant Song" is hilariously spazzy and
shrill, and "Sound of Wasps" works won
ders with its loungey paranoia ("I guess I
got stung once / It's an ever-present dan
ger"). Even Scott and his Trans Am come
back on the second disc to get what they
deserve: "Scott's Trans Am has the win
dows down / pull his pants down / pull
his pants down."
From start to finish, "Heyday" pre
sents the Embarrassment as a long-over
looked band that better not be over
looked any more — 15 years old, their
music is still some of the freshest stuff
a rou nd.
