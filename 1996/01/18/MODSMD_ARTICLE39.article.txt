## Georgia 
### 
In "Georgia," directed by Ulu Grosbard,
Jennifer Jason Leigh is .it her ravaged best as
a perpetually drugged and boo/.ed-out rock
and-roll singer, Sadie, whose failure to
launch a musical career contrasts sharply
with the success of her older and more mel
low sister, Georgia.
Played with understated grace by Mare
Winningham — who has been friends with
Leigh since the two met at a summer arts
camp as teenagers — Georgia is a popular
country singer who vacillates between her
love for her sister and her an tier and i»uilt at

having to put up with Sadie s recurring effu
sions of jealousy and effrontery. The film's
greatest strength is this depiction of sisterly
conflict, which resonates with complexity
and realism and offers no tidy resolutions.
The film opens with Sadie as a motel cham
bermaid who attaches herself to a mediocre
musician and then flees from him when the
situation becomes dangerous. Soon, drugged
out and gaping behind her raccoon-eye make
up, she lands on Georgia's doorstep — a last
ditch measure to which she has doubtlessly re
sorted before. Georgia acts as though she is
used to bailing her sister out of trouble, acting
impassively as she later watches Sadie talk
about drugs in front of her children.
Of course, (ieorgia can only tolerate Sadie

for so long before the younger sister's stabs at
helplessness and self-pity become an un
comfortable assault on her own success as a
singer. The conflict comes to a head after she
allows Sadie to squeal out an epic rendition
of Van Morrison's "Take me back" at her con
cert (in a startling scene that will either make
or break audience sympathy for Sadie). She
then confronts her sister with the bitter com
ment, "You can't sing." Yearning desperately
for her sister's approval, Sadie seems to take
these words as a blow to the heart but also as
the truth. Yet it is significant that she does not
buckle under the weight of such an attack,
but returns in the final scene to her strained
but heart-felt singing.
Without question the gem of the film is

Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays the gritty bad
girl Sadie with apparent effortlessness. Such
a role is not foreign to Leigh, who has por
trayed similarly compulsive and dangerous
types in "Last Exit to Brooklyn" (1989),
"Miami Blues" (1990), "Single White Fe
male" (1992) and "Mrs. Parker and the Vi
cious Circle" (1994).
In the end, "Georgia" boasts a gripping
story and convincing performances, but the
intensity of the sisterly conflict is not for all
tastes. Leigh's tortured singingand her down
and-out lifestyle may strike some as over
whelmingly depressing, but for those who
want to avoid the typically mindless Holly
wood fare, this film is an excellent choice.
