Friends and teachers of Chinua
Sanyika struggled to comprehend
yesterday why the first-year med
ical student allegedly shot and
killed his ex-girlfriend and then
himself last weekend in Los Ange
les.
West Los Angeles Police said
they answered reports of shots at
11:30 a.m. on Saturday from the
apartment of Anthea Williams,
where they found Sanyika, 24,
and Williams, 26, already dead.
"I knew him very well. He was a
gentleman," said Elliott Wolfe, as
sociate dean of medical student
and graduate affairs, who taught
Sanyika in a small psychiatry
course last quarter. He added that
Sanyika was well-liked by others
at the Medical School.
"He did quite well," Elliott
said. "No academic difficulties at
all."
Although a police statement
said the murder-suicide "appears

to involve a love triangle," Khalid
Channell, a first-year medical stu
dent and friend of Sanyika, said
Williams and Sanyika had been in
volved for "six or seven years,"
and that Sanyika had never said
anything to him about breaking
off the relationship.
West L.A. Police Detective De
tron Phillips refused to confirm or
deny a Stanford News Service re
port that Sanyika had left a sui
cide note.
Channell and other friends
learned of Sanvika's death after a
family friend contacted Graduate
Residences Director Christine
Griffith on Tuesday.
A meeting was held yesterday
in Fairchild Auditorium to re
member Sanyika. The meeting
was attended by an audience of
medical students, faculty and oth
ers who had known him here and
at Harvard, from which he gradu
ated in 1993.
Sanyika participated in an
early matriculation program and
took classes at the Medical School
in the summer. Elliott said the
program is intended to prepare
students for academic or teaching
positions in medicine.
According to Channell, Sanyi
ka spent winter break with his
family in Altadena, Calif.
Although he remains at a loss to
explain Sanyika's alleged actions,
Channell remembered one con
versation that seemed uncharac
teristic in the few days he saw
Sanyika after break.
"He said he had not gone to
class the first two days, and that
he needed time to get into things .
. . but he had always gone to
class," Channell explained.
However, Channell said he had
not been concerned because, even
with the missed classes, Sanyika
had not seemed at the time to be
in an unusual mood.
"Although, looking back, he
did seem a little preoccupied,"
Channell added.

He also said Williams had visit
ed Sanyika a few times in the fall
quarter, but that Sanyika did not
seem at all obsessed with the rela
tionship.
"He never really talked about
it," Channell said.
At one point last year,
Williams had talked about
returning to South Africa, her
home country. Although Sanyika
planned to end the relationship if
that happened, he had not
appeared to be greatly concerned
about it, Channell said.
Sekou Ford, a medical student
and friend of Sanyika, also said
Sanyika had not seemed dis
turbed last week He added that
Sanyika had said he was going to
spend that weekend with his fam
ily in Altadena.
Ford knew nothing about a
"love triangle," and said Sanyika
had said nothing about problems
with Williams.
Channell said Sanyika's funer
al took place yesterday in an
Islamic cemetery in Las Vegas.
Sanyika's family will hold a
memorial service 40 days after
the funeral on Feb. 26, in accor
dance with Islamic custom.
