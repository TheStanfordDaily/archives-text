Who's the bad guy?
That's the question that should be tackled
in a story where the mother of a murdered
child takes justice into her own hands — the
moral issue of whether murder merits mur
der. Instead, "Eye I or An Eye' conveniently
dodges that issue by presenting the audience
with an entirely repulsive one-dimensional
antagonist. The question is not whether or
not he should die — the only issue is how fast.
Sally 112 ield plays Karen McCann, a career
woman whose teenage daughter is brutally
raped and murdered while she listens help
lessly on a cellular phone in Los Angeles grid
lock. ( Irocery deliverer Robert Doob (Kiefer
Sutherland) is arrested for the crime, but
altera technicality renders DNA evidence in
admissible, he is set free. Despite the urgings
of her husband — portrayed sincerely by Ed
I l.iri is — McCann plans to seek justice in her
own fashion. The discovery of an under
ground vigilante group further facilitates her
motive, and she sets about to find Doob and
exact her revenge.
field delivers a powerful and complex
portrayal of a woman .it first paranoid by and
then obsessed with the killer of her eldest
daughter. Alternating between utter grief
and an almost sinister will to see I )oob dead,
she is entirely believable as she transforms
from a loving mother to a calculating killer.
Though Sutherland plays a clear-cut bad guy,

Fields McGinn is far from a pure-white
heroine. She yells at her five-year-old daugh
ter and lies to her husband straight-faced.
She is the one who lends a twist to an other
wise simplistic plot.
Joe Montegna also offers a subtly solid
performance as a seasoned homicide cop
who hates Doob but must still play by the

rules. Director Joel Schelinger ("Midnight
Cowboy") manages to keep the movie sus
penseful, but even his deft touch cannot keep
the film from having an almost TV-movie
documentary feel. One almost expects
"Based on a true story" to be flashed 011 the
screen before the credits. He does have the
courage, however, to take a stand on the con

troversial issue of capital punishment, albeit
by painting the picture too simply — the
killer has no remorse and in fact kills again.
Despite solid performances by the entire
cast, the film is ultimately less than the sum
of its parts. If you miss "Eye For An Eye,"
don't despair — you aren't missing much.
