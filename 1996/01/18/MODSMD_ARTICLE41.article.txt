# Cutthroat Island
## 
### 
A sense of doom followed me
into the theater to watch "Cut-

throat Island," the Gcena Davis pirate movie
with such bad advance publicity that Holly
wood insiders would have considered any suc
cess to be a miracle. The pitiful box office re
sults may have indicated merely a poor market
for piracy, but the empty theaters also reflected
a vacuous movie without the intelligence to
make an enjoyable action movie.
"Cutthroat Island" is a textbook-case pirate
movie, complete with hidden treasure, endless
swordplay and a ruthless villain, with the only
innovation being the replacement of a male
captain with a feisty heroine (Davis) who in
herits her father's ship and takes control of its
crew to pursue a legendary fortune in gold.
It seems a shallow premise, as the principal
characters have no higher "mission from God"

like lake and Elwood; they just want to get rich
and continue their anti-establishment ways.
The plot could make for simple no-brainer en
tertainment, except that director Renny Harlin
doesn't stretch the film much farther than im
ages of exploding buildings and boats (Harlin
did direct the "Die Hard" series, after all) and
Davis repeatedly humiliating every man in the
movie with her trusty sword, knock-out
punches and long-legged kicks (Harlin is also
Davis' husband).
The weakest aspect of "Cutthroat Island" is
the dialogue, obviously sacrificed to the visual
feats of this reportedly $100 million-plus ac
tion flick. Davis, as the fearless Morgan Adams,
displays more breast than wit, and Frank Lan
gella as the evil Uncle Dawg actually delivers
the hackneyed line, "I'll be back, Morgan, if it's
the last thing I do!" Only Matthew Modine, as
a con artist whose help Morgan enlists to trans
late the treasure map, has some clever lines,

perhaps as compensation for his apparent
physical helplessness. Morgan seems to be con
stantly ordering him about or pulling him back
to his feet when he slips.
I did enjoy this attempt at a message of fe
male self-sufficiency and power, but the senti
ment predictably fades as the movie progress
es. Once Davis and Modine have sealed their
flirtation with a kiss, he persuades her to agree
to a 50-50 partnership and equal share of the
treasure. The theme of the movie becomes one
of interdependence, as the lovers grow to trust
and need each other — not actions immedi
ately attributed to an effective pirate.
In an era when movies like "Leaving Las
Vegas" have so much substance that they haunt
me for weeks, I had to remind myself to think
about "Cutthroat Island" 10 minutes after it
ended. I can't vouch for the other three people
in the theater, though.
