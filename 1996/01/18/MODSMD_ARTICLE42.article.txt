## Allison Amend Oh, mon Paris: Vive la nostalgie 
### 
I knew this would happen with the same
certainty that follows a particularly good day,
standing beneath the low-hanging clouds,
mouth wide open, waiting for the other shoe
to drop. It clattered and clanked to the floor
when I saw "Sabrina."
It was not a particularly good movie; the
'90s update wasn't that successful and Julia
Ormond's naivete was grating rather than in
gratiating. But the first half of the movie took
place almost entirely in Paris.
In MY Paris.
Not Sartre's Paris of the left bank, nor
Miller's Paris of Pigalle, nor Picasso's Paris of
Montmartre. This was Les Halles, Chatalet,
St. Eustache, around the corner of my apart
ment in Paris.
Though I was in Stanford's Paris program
last year, I had little to do with the center. My
one class there met once a week, and I rarely
went otherwise. When the program ended, I
stayed on and my life changed very little.
My apartment was small (by American
standards), old (there was a well in the cave—
wine cellar — that dated back to the Middle
Ages), and, yes, garret-like, poised as it was on
the sixth floor of a twisted, colorless staircase,
but it had a large bathroom with a sky-light
and a well-equipped heating system.

My experience was Parisian more than it
was French. I spent my time with Anglophilic
French, Poles and Australians, Spaniards and
Americans. I spent days without talking to
anyone, when the oppressive clouds kept me
cooped up in my apartment reading or writ
ing. The week my four major papers for the
year were due (in as many languages), I didn't
leave the apartment once, except to mail the
finished product. Apparently, walking
around Paris in your pajamas and tennis
shoes, even on a 4 a.m. trip to the all-night
post office, is unacceptable, judging by the
looks I received.
I have to admit, and please keep this just
between us, that I hated it. I hated not being
able to speak the language, I hated walking by
Commc des Carbons and Yohi Yamahoto and
Agn£s B. every morning on my way to the
metro not being able to buy anything. I even
hated the metro, but the bus took an eternity
and I hated walking even more, persecuted as
I was by the stares of the homeless and an un
lucky propensity for continually stepping in
the most Parisian of dirt: dog feces.
I was lonely and wet (I went through four
umbrellas during my time in Paris). I resent
ed early mornings in the Biblioth&que Na
tionale where the only sources on my thesis

topic (Julio Cortdzar) were in German, and
the French attention span, a full six hours
longer than my own, put me at a disadvan
tage. In that large hall, books crowding up to
the ceiling, and in the back rooms, (as my eyes
told me on my behind-the-scenes look at the
inner workings of the National Library, since
my guide was Alsacian and I couldn't under
stand a word of her abbreviated French) I felt
the insistent gaze of the French greats: Ra
belais, Proust, Balzac, their busts on
podiums high in the hall.
And now Sabrina had to take it all away.
She fixed scarves at the Place des Inno
cents, 30 yards from my doorstep, site of a
story I wrote about the oversized, disembod
ied head that served as jungle gym for French
children. She spritzed mist at the models in
front of ICRAM and the Rite of Spring Foun
tain, whose nonchalant absurdity I appreciat
ed in the darkest moments of my stay. She
drank 20-franc coffees on the lie St. Louis,
which I could never afford, and she managed
to write intelligently in her journal, whereas I
was reduced to reading movie magazines on
my intellectual hiatus.
She met Louis.
She seduced Harrison Ford.
That Paris was mine, I couldn't help but

feel, mine, as I nudged my movie companion
here in the U.S. I remember when that movie
was filmed, the large trucks and the gen
darmes roping off the place so that I sighed
and had to walk around Les Halles to get to
the metro.
And 1 knew it would happen, knew it even
as I ran to catch the bus, late for class, and
missed it, flinging sopping wet bangs out of
my forehead as the rain spat at me, adding in
sult to injury. I knew it as the bank teller said,
"That's impossible without this form, but it
needs to be filled out on Thursday and today,
sadly, is Friday." I knew it even as I trudged up
the six flights of stairs to my apartment, ex
hausted from my day, and — having been
heedless of Simone de Bouvoir's warnings
about wearing heeled shoes in Paris — with
blistered and bruised feet, realizing I'd forgot
ten something essential at the dry cleaners or
the hyper-march£ so that I'd have to go back
down and begin again.
1 knew that when I saw Sabrina co-opting
my existence, my triumphs without my trials
and tribulations, my successes without my
setbacks, 1 would feel the sweeping sourness
of nostalgia and the sweetness of memory,
that 1 would feel territorial and proprietary.
That 1 would miss it terribly.
