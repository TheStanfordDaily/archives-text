# Rape suspect faces 17 charges in court
## Reid to be arraigned today in Palo Alto 
### Frank Guinan Editorial staff 
Romel Demetrias Reid, the
prime suspect in a series of Penin
sula rapes, will be formally
charged with 17 felony counts, in
cluding rape, attempted rape,
sodomy, kidnapping and robbery,
at his arraignment today at the
Palo Alto Courthouse.
Reid was arrested and taken
into custody Monday by Palo Alto
police, who said that evidence
links Reid to the white van con
nected with several rapes
throughout the South Bay region
over the last six months. Police re
covered the van and arrested Reid
after a nine-hour manhunt Satur
day.
Police believe the same man
committed at least 10 sexual as
saults in the Peninsula area since
August. The victims have ranged
from women in their 40s to a 15-

year-old who was attacked last
Saturday. The attacks have oc
curred in Menlo Park, Palo Alto,
Mountain View and Sunnyvale.
While a rash of rapes occurred
in August and September, police
thought the rapist left town in Oc
tober after the attacks ceased.
However, December marked the
return of the rapist when more at
tacks occurred.
Police released a composite
sketch of the suspect in the fall,
and victims described him as a
black male, in his 20s to early 30s,
standing around 6 feet tall and
weighing between 160 to 180
pounds. Reid is 25 years old,
stands 6 feet 4 inches tall and
weighs 195 pounds.
Reid's mother and girlfriend
described Reid as gentle and out
going and insisted he could not be
a rapist, the Associated Press re
ported.
Police stopped Reid in October
for a traffic citation but did not
apprehend him at the time
because he did not closely resem
ble the sketch and was not doing
anything suspicious, detective

Sgt. Dennis Burns told the AP.
Reid has run into trouble with
the law before. He has served
three years in state prison and has
been previously charged with
assault with a deadly weapon,
assault with force to commit great
bodily harm and receiving stolen
property.
He was paroled in June 1993
but was arrested again six months
later for a parole violation.
