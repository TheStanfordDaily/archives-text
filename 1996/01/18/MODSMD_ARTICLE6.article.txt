Chatting about such hot topics as the current gov
ernment shutdown, the success of the "Republican
revolution" and Nixon's emotional state during his
presidency, former Secretary of State George Shultz
answered students' questions at Kimball Hall last
night.
Despite recent Republican setbacks, Shultz, a dis
tinguished Hoover fellow commended the GOP Con
tract with America and the Republican-dominated
Congress' legislation this session.
"They promised, they went down the list, and they
had a vote on everything," Shultz said. "My opinion is
that whether or not people agreed with what they
want, they kind of liked it that people actually did what
they said they would do."
But even while praising Republican efforts to stick
to their contract, Shultz criticized the current govern
ment shutdown.
"I'm sick of these games," Shultz said. "When we
had a Republican president and a Democratic Con
gress, the Democrats played that game. Now we have a
Democratic president and a Republican Congress, and
1 he same games are being played."
Reminiscing about his government service, Shultz
talked about his term as President Reagan's secretary of
state, describing Reagan as an important politician who
transformed what people thought about economic de
velopment and brought about the end of the Cold War.
Comparing Reagan to Nixon, Shultz said, "Nixon
wjus one of the most insecure people I've ever known.
