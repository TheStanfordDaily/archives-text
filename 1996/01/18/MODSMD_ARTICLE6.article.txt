# Came the Secretary: Shultz, in rare appearance, raps at Kimball
## 
### Dana Hangai Contributing writer 
Chatting about such hot topics as the current gov
ernment shutdown, the success of the "Republican
revolution" and Nixon's emotional state during his
presidency, former Secretary of State George Shultz
answered students' questions at Kimball Hall last
night.
Despite recent Republican setbacks, Shultz, a dis
tinguished Hoover fellow commended the GOP Con
tract with America and the Republican-dominated
Congress' legislation this session.
"They promised, they went down the list, and they
had a vote on everything," Shultz said. "My opinion is
that whether or not people agreed with what they
want, they kind of liked it that people actually did what
they said they would do."
But even while praising Republican efforts to stick
to their contract, Shultz criticized the current govern
ment shutdown.
"I'm sick of these games," Shultz said. "When we
had a Republican president and a Democratic Con
gress, the Democrats played that game. Now we have a
Democratic president and a Republican Congress, and
1 he same games are being played."
Reminiscing about his government service, Shultz
talked about his term as President Reagan's secretary of
state, describing Reagan as an important politician who
transformed what people thought about economic de
velopment and brought about the end of the Cold War.
Comparing Reagan to Nixon, Shultz said, "Nixon
wjus one of the most insecure people I've ever known.

I le was a great strategist, but he
was always uncomfortable with
himself. He was a troubled man."
"Reagan, however, always had
confidence in himself," he added.
"Unlike some of today's Republican
presidential candidates, Reagan
didn't quake before the hard right.
Thev liked him and he liked them,

but he had a mind of his own. "
Accountability is a key factor in
today's politics, he said.
"With the plethora of informa
tion about," Shultz said, "people
nowadays know more about what
is going on. It used to be not so
long ago that if you were a leader
in the government, if someone
questioned you, you could say that
the person didn't know what they
were talking about."
"That doesn't happen today
anymore," he continued. "People

nowadays can judge how compe
tent their leaders are."
The accountability of govern
ment officials is essential to a
healthy nation, Shultz said, adding
that when problems arise, the gov
ernment must find a solution
instead of hoping for a "bail-out."
"Remember Orange County's
bankruptcy," Shultz said. "I'm
chairman of Governor (Pete) Wil
son's economic board. When
Orange County's bankruptcy
came, he called me."

The question-and-answer ses
sion was sponsored by Kimball
Hall. Senior Alison Pulliam.a Kim
ball resident assistant who orga
nized the event, estimated that
about 70 people attended. "It was a
really good turnout," she said.
"It's important that we have a
diversity of viewpoints in our
meetings," said Resident Fellow
John Rickford. "We wanted to
reflect views not just 112 rom the lib
eral side, but also the conservative
outlook."
