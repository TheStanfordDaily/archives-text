Car thefts rising
It's been u busy week for car thieves.
Stanford Police received two separate
reports of stolen vehicles and recovered
another vehicle which was reported
stolen to the San Mateo County Sheriffs
Department.
On Jan. 8, a 1988 Ford Escort was
reported stolen from the Beacon Service
Station on campus after it was simply
taken away by a tow truck and never
seen again.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemey
er said the car was inoperable and had
been sold to an employee of the gas sta
tion by junior Dale Johnson. Before
Johnson had sold the car, however, he
had looked into having the air towed.
"I had called wrecking yards to get
offers on the car, I but 1 they were only
offers," said Johnson. "But then I talked
to the mechanic, and he said he would
match one of the best offers. Ho paid off
my bill at the garage and we exchanged
titles."
The car was left sitting at the gas .sta
tion. Then on Dec. 1, a shiny, red tow
truck came and picked up the vehicle,

Niemeyer said. The vehicle has not been
seen since.
Police have called tow truck compa
nies in the area, and no company reports
having sent a red tow truck to pick up
the Escort.
"I don't think the wrecking yards
took it," Johnson said. "There was no
money exchanged, it had been a month
or two since 1 talked to them, and no
company knew the car was at the service
station."
In a separate incident, a 1990 Jeep
Wagoneer was reported stolen Jan. 9
between 12:30 p.m. and 8 p.m. from the
east side of the Oval, Niemeyer said. The
vehicle was parked, locked and unat
tended at the time.
On the same day, a car was recovered
from Stanford campus. Niemeyer said
the car had been reported stolen from
Redwood City. It had not been stripped
and appeared to have been stolen only
for a joy ride.
"Car thefts are going up in general,"
Niemeyer said. "The good ones are
stripped. The neat cars — collectibles —
head off-shore or go to Mexico."
Niemeyer added that "the Russian

mafia is suspected of sending exotic cars
in containers overseas."
Obscene caller back again
Some people just don't have anything
productive to do in their spare time.
Oscar is one.
Stanford Police Detective Mark
Swineford said five women reported
receiving calls this week from the
obscene phone caller identifying himself
as Oscar.
One senior who reported receiving a
call said Oscar asked for her by name. 1 le
started using words like "pussy" and she
hung up.
Swineford said Oscar generally does
not call women back who simply hang up
when they hear his voice and name.
Oscar will, however, call women back
who involve him in conversation. He will
call them either right back or within a
day or two.
The infamous Oscar has been harass
ing women since April 1995 with obscene
phone calls and uses a high voice.
Police continue to investigate the
calls. They are requesting for people

with information on Oscar's identity to
call Swineford at 723-9633.
White van scare
A man driving a white van, a vehicle
which has been made infamous by the
Peninsula serial rapist, allegedly fol
lowed a woman jogging on the Stanford
campus Jan. 10.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemey
er said a woman observed a dirty white
van with ladders on its roof passing her
and doubling back as she jogged along
Esplanada Way, Alvarado Row and May
field Avenue at 6:15 a.m. She hid behind
a tree to lose the follower and later
reported the incident to a deputy.
The deputy who received the report
was patrolling in the area where she had
been jogging, spotted the white van, and
pulled the driver over. Niemeyer said the
driver admitted to having been in the
area even though he does not live near
the Stanford campus.
The case is still under investigation to
determine why the man was driving his
van slowly around the campus so early
in the morning. Niemeyer said, however,

that police do not suspect the man to be
connected to the Peninsula rapes.
University scooter stolen
On Jan. 7, Redwood City Police recov
ered and returned a scooter stolen from
the Office of Technology Licensing on
Welch Road.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said Redwood City Police saw juveniles
riding a scooter and signaled for them to
stop. When the juveniles refused, a foot
chase ensued, which ended with police
apprehending the suspects.
The juveniles told police they had
bought the scooter earlier from an indi
vidual, but when police traced the
license plate number, they found that
the scooter was registered to Stanford
- University.
Christina Hatch, receptionist for the
Office of Technology Licensing, said the
office did not even realize the scooter
had been stolen. The office has two vehi
cles, the scooter and a van. The scooter
was very rarely used and appeared aban
doned.
