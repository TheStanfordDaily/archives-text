We are proud to bring back now for the second year this
extraordinary young English artist, whose all-embracing
musicianship is praised by the 8.8.C. as the standard towards
which all theatre organists should aim.
"I urgently recommend that our regular patrons not miss
Simon's concert, which will surely be one of the great
evenings of our entire year." David W. Packard
