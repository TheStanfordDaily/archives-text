## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
The man accused of perpetrating "a reign of terror"
since August by allegedly committing a series of rapes
in the Bay Area was arraigned yesterday at the Santa
Clara County Municipal Court in Palo Alto.
Romel Reid has been charged with six counts of
rape in addition to multiple counts of robbery, sodomy,
assault with intent to commit rape and evadinga police
officer. He will not enter a plea until next month.
In a press conference after the arraignment, Palo
Alto Police Chief Chris Durkin applauded the cooper
ation of task forces throughout the Bay Area, a group
which included special agents from the Federal Bu
reau of Investigation and the Department of Justice.
"We are very glad to bo giving an all-clear signal,"
Durkin said. "I feel this was an exception â€” crimes do
occur, but it has been many years since there was a
similar series of crimes in this area. We are grateful he
is in custody."
Durkin said they are looking at other crimes that
have occurred on the Peninsula since August and are
considering Reid as a potential suspect. "It is impor
tant to find out what extent the crimes have come to,"
said Durkin.
FBI Asst. Special Agent in Charge Mark Mershon
said a psychological profile of the suspect that was re
leased in early October came "substantially close to the
mark."
Profiles are based on statistics of criminal behavior
by sexual offenders. FBI agents conducted thousands
of interviews. The profile of the suspect was based on
"things that were said during sex acts, the time of the
crime," said Mershon.
Mershon said Reid's "propensity for violence," and
the fact that he "committed other crimes besides sex"
were predicted in the profile.
Palo Alto Police Officer Lori Kratzer refused to
comment on whether victims have yet been given an
opportunity to identify the suspect in a lineup.
