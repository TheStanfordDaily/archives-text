President Boris Yeltsin declared
the nine-day-old hostage crisis in
southern Russia to be over yester
day, claiming all of the Chechen
rebel captors were killed and most
of the captives survived.
Yeltsin said 82 hostages were
rescued and 18 were missing.
There was no way to indepen
dently confirm his account, which
contradicted a statement by
Prime Minister Viktor Cher
nomyrdin earlier in the day that
-12 hostages had been freed and
the rest appeared to he dead.
Throughout the hostage crisis
in the village of Pervomayskaya,
Russian officials have issued wild
ly conflicting accounts of the
numbers and fate of the gunmen
and hostages involved.

Russian military authorities
expelled reporters from Pervo
mayskaya and neighboring vil
lages Wednesday, as Russian
troops unleashed a scorching
rocket attack intended to crush
the separatist rebels.
Sounding a tough line, Yeltsin
indicated that rebel leader
Dzhokhar Dudayev, could expect
harsh treatment, and that Russia
had no intention of tolerating
more terrorist attacks.
"We have taught Dudayev a
sound lesson, and now it is neces
sary to deliver strikes on
Dudayev's strongholds . . . to put
an end to terrorism on Russian
soil," Yeltsin said.
There was no immediate reac
tion from the rebel forces to
Yeltsin's remarks. It was not

immediately clear whether his
statement had reached rebel sym
pathizers who hijacked a passen
ger ferry in Turkey and said they
would blow it up unless the Rus
sians stopped the battle at Pervo
mayskaya.
Yeltsin told reporters in
Moscow after meeting with his
security chief that the military
operation in Pervomavskaya was
over, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
The missing hostages "must be
presumed alive," Yeltsin said.
Gen. Mikhail Barsukov, head
of the Federal Security Service,
said troops found no dead
hostages when they entered Per
vomayskaya, but he acknowl
edged that rebels may have
buried some bodies.
