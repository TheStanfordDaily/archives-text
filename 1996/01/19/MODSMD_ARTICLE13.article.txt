## Future challenges 
### 
Faculty must take the
opportunities offered
in the strategic plan

FOR THE FIRST time in a
long time, Stanford's Facul
ty Senate has the opportuni
ty to act on something truly mean
ingful for the University: a recent
ly released long-term strategic
plan which honestly confronts the
harsh realities of higher educa
tion's future. Now, it's up to that
illustrious body — famed for its
arcane debates over minute details
— to recognize the report as a seri
ous vehicle for change and to seize
the opportunity to act.
The document, entitled "Plan
ning in an Era of Change," was
drafted by the senate's inconspicu
ous Planning and Policy Board,
created three years ago for the
express purpose of giving Stanford
faculty more participation in Uni
versity planning.
This faculty committee has
maintained a low-profile over the
last few years, so it's rather drastic
recommendations — which
include the merging of smaller
departments, an increased depart
mental review process, timely fac
ulty retirements and increased
flexibility in Ph.D. curricula —
come as something of a surprise.
It is particularly interesting when
these recommendations are com
pared with those made a year ago by
the Commission on Undergraduate
Education, which received, in con
trast, a great deal of attention from
administrators, faculty members
and the outside world. The commis
sion's recommendations were
meaningful to all facets of under
graduate education, but its mission
was to stay within Stanford's usual
paradigm of academia.
In one unheard-of report, how
ever, the Planning and Policy
Board has recognized the fiscally
tight realities facing higher educa

tion these days. In a refreshing
move, it has recommended deci
sively, stepping outside the tight
academic arena into a place where
many faculty members seem
uncomfortable.
It is not yet clear where this
report is going —whether it will be
passed by the senate or simply dis
cussed and passed on into oblivion.
But this is a valuable opportunity
for the faculty to take a stand on
its own future, because whether or
not this particular report is
passed, these issues will increas
ingly confront this University over
the next lew years.
In its typical fashion, the senate
spent much of its meeting last
week discussing only one of the
report's 15 major recommenda
tions: the proposal to merge small
departments. Granted, it's a con
troversial subject; senators need to
realize, however, that it is the
report in its entirety which is truly
important. They cannot let them
selves get bogged down in minuti
ae.
The senate spent a large part of
its last year debating and passing
parts of the report of the Com
mission of Undergraduate Educa
tion. "Planning in the Era of
Change" should receive even
more attention. Sad as it is, belt
tightening is unquestionably the
future of universities. The faculty
needs to recognize this and then
involve itself as heavily as possi
ble into areas generally left to
administrators.
This is not the type of document
that the Faculty Senate has, in
recent years at least, dealt much
with or seemed to feel comfortable
handling. It looks farther beyond
the University than most reports
do, and it will be interesting to see
how — or even if — the senate
handles it.
"Planning in an Era of Change"
is blunt. It is to-the-point and it is
scary. But it is extremely impor
tant that faculty members recog
nize how much they need to con
front it, and to consider its impli
cations for the future.
