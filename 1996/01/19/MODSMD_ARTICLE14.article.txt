SOMEBODY IS SERIOUSLY con
fused. I am Erik Flister. Ryan
Shaw and I (notice that NEI
THER of our names is Bill Shen) are
the two students who decided to skip
part of our Stats 190 exam because
Jesse Jackson's speech was, as Michael
Wolf demeaningly described it, "so
exciting."
Please, no one try to make Wolf
understand. We already tried. He can't.
Wolf claimed that we "seriously
expected to receive extra time on our
exam" and "were seriously offended
when told that we would not." Appar
ently, he was too busy taking notes in
his "bad undergraduate" notebook to
excel at his weighty job of understand
ing student needs.
Jackson's address was scheduled to
end shortly before 1 p.m., leaving, we
nooumn/] nmrtln i i »■*■* f/\ kilm <Ka fW \

yards to our midterm. At 1 p.m., while
Jackson was still going strong, Ryan
and I decided that it was an important
part of our life experience to hear what
Jackson had to say — so important that
it was worth giving up a half hour of
Wolfs statistics midterm.
We inferred AT THE TIME that he
and Statistics Prof. Joseph Romano
would probably not understand, based
on their attitudes throughout the quar
ter. We knew we would lose the half
hour. Although he couldn't seem to
understand it, we couldn't ask Wolf
beforehand because it hadn't happened
yet! If Jackson were scheduled in con
flict with the exam, t hen of course it
would have made sense to discuss it.
We had hoped, in naivete, that Wolf
and Prof. Romano would have our
holistic, liberal education in mind as we
made our appeal; seeing Jackson was a

valuable part of such an education. In
fact, we pay them $30,000 a year to
make sure that we're "prepared for
life." That's probably more money than
Wolf will make in awhile, as computers
are taking over his future career.
Anyway, I'm more content having
seen Jackson in person than I would be
with an A in Wolf's class. That is a sen
timent I expressed to him personally. I
do not believe that is "spoiled."
Wolf inferred that it was his respon
sibility to prepare us for life. Apparent
ly, his interpretation of responsibility is
to present himself as an unbending pil
lar of establishment against inspiration
who doesn't understand the exhilara
tion of the opportunity to see Jackson
speak in person. Well, he's just alienat
ed the better portion of this intellectu
al, inspired institution.
"Seriously offended," Mr. Wolf? I

don't think so. We told you and Prof.
Romano that we understood that you
had to do what you decided was appro
priate. We did not argue with your deci
sion. In the face of your intolerant
incomprehension, we expressed t hat we
were sorry that the situation had to
turn out the way it did. We weren't
apologetic, mind you, of the decision we
made. Between you and me, sir, I'm dis
gusted that more of our class didn't
find it crucial to their education to lis
ten to one of the most important speak
ers and thinkers our hemisphere has
ever seen.
Intolerance is the issue here. As pro
gressive as this University is (and Mr.
Wolf, we DO pay you out of our a—es to
be progressive), we must still champion
tolerance.
