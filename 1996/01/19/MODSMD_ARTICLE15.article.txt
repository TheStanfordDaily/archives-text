# Wolf writes again to clarify facts of issue
## 
### 
Please allow me to respond a second
time to the letter of Jan Leu in the Jan.
16 issue of The Daily.
It actually turns out that Rill Shen,
unlike Leu claimed, was not one of the
two students who came late to the
midterm due to the Jesse Jackson
speech. These two were spectators who
had nothing to do with the organization
of the rally. Indeed, three of the people
who were given special consideration
and were allowed to take the midterm at
a later date belonged to the organizers.
May I suggest that Ms. Leu gets her
facts straight before accusing somebody
else publicly of hypocrisy the next time
around. Or should I use Leu's own

words: "It is disappointing to hear such
condescending and ill-founded negative
views from a fellow TA."
