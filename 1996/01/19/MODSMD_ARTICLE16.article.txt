# Mann's column on athletes was biased and misinformed
## 
### 
COURTNEY MANN'S ARTICLE in
the Jan. 17 issue of The Daily, ("Athletics
just as legitimate") was at best dim-wit
ted. As a former member of your editorial
staff, it made me wince. Its hoped-for lib
eral approach was fake; it presented ugly
stereotypes with a smile. It was unin
formed and thoughtless.
Mann claimed to be trying to demon
strate that athletics are as worthy a

manner as academics for achieving suc
cess. Worthiness is beside the point, for
the athletics route is entirely less
promising — just look at the graduation
rates at most colleges and universities
for scholarship athletes. Or better yet,
look at the numbers of high-school ath
letes who hope for scholarships and
never get them.
Yet this was the high point of the col
umn, for Mann then goes on to assert,
wholly without qualification, that "intelli
gence" is determined by genetic inheri
tance. Before 1 leave aside the nature / nu
rture debate, I should say that not even
those who most closely adhere to the
genetic-inheritance theory stick to it as
thickly as Mann does in this column.
How could a sports reporter be so
clueless as to the intelligence required of
an excellent athlete? I would like to list
some traits needed by athletes to per-

form:
• concentration
• planning
• discipline
• character
• empathy
• four-dimensional perception
• forbearance
• a sense of scale and balance
• the desire to practice
• visualization
• the ability to imagine breaking former
boundaries
And, of course, there are more.
As a teaching fellow here and else
where, I have found, almost without
exception, my student-athletes to be
superb students, due, I believe, to the
above qualities.
