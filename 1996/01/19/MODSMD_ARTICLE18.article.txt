## Walking the tightrope 
### 
WALKING. IT SEEMS like
everyone is walking these clays.
Transportation on loot is at an
all-time high with 63 percent of Ameri
cans admitting that they have walked at
some point in their lives. On college
campuses, walking is even more popular
than in the rest of the country — stu
dents walk to class, to parties, even to
the bathroom in the middle of the night.
"Everywhere you look, some damn
young punk is walking somewhere," one
parent observed.
On behalf of the concerned people at
The Balance Beam, who have been very
busy lately, I've decided to look at this
ambulatory trend with the sort of para
noiac vigilance it deserves. We as stu
dents need to start thinking before we
walk. What follows is a brief account of
the health benefits and — more impor
tantly — the hazards of walking.
If it all seems hard to believe, try sit
ting on the toilet and reading it about
800 more times.
Walking can be useful in modera
tion.
According to U.S. Census data, walk
ing is a very common practice among
humans aged 1-86. This is understand
able; often, when one needs to got from
one location to another, walking seems
like the best method.
Walking can be harmful in many
ways.
Despite its accessibility and populari
ty, many of the dangers of walking have

been overlooked and the practice can
certainly be abused. According to a Nike
spokesman, walking is the No. 1 cause of
tennis-shoe wear in the United States,
far ahead of the second-most common
cause, which is just scraping one's shoe
back and forth on the ground.
Walking can also be dangerous if done
in the wrong places. Well over half of the
pedestrians who were hit by cars last
year were walking at the time. Further
more, walking on slick surfaces or on a
bunch of little marbles can cause one to
lose one's footing and fall down. At least
one-third of slip-and-fall lawsuits last
year occurred when someone walked
and then slipped and fell.
A common misconception is that
walking is for everyone, but certain peo
ple should not walk. These include clum
sy people, who will often run into objects
or other people, or will simply trip all by
themselves when they try to walk.
Walking can be addictive.
Due to tin accessibility and apparent
usefulness of the practice, walkers can
easily become trapped in a downward
spiral of walking dependency and abuse.
It often starts with pressure from
friends: "Hey, wanna walk to class with
us?" Soon, walking becomes the only
way these people know how to get any
where. They forget about other forms of
transportation, like buses and skate
boards.
Chronic walkers may even exhibit
physical symptoms such as foot blisters
and leg-muscle fatigue. Other signs

include wandering during the day and
trouble with finances (spending too
much on shoes).
Walking is a temporary solution to
permanent problems.
We often get caught up in walking
from place to place and don't bother to
realize that the only outcome of walking
is more walking. Walking is irreversible.
Once a person walks somewhere, the
only thing to do is walk back.
People will always need to get from
certain places to certain other places.
Just getting up and walking there seems
like an easy way out, but it doesn't solve
anything.
There are several simple methods
to prevent walking.
The most frequent methods of walk
ing prevention are other forms of trans
portation, such as biking, driving, etc.
But even these involve some hazardous
walking to r et to the necessary vehicle.
In the final chapter of his book, "No
More Walking," Dr. Yong Sam Wok
offers a more absolute solution to the
problem. "It seems that the best way to
completely avoid the practice of walk
ing," Wok writes, "is to just sit on your
ass all day."
