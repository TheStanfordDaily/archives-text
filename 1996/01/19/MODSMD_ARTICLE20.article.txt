### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
With songs and speeches, mem
bers of Stanford's Jewish commu
nity will begin a week-long period
of celebration, education and
entertainment today. During Jew
ish Culture Week, organizers hope
to celebrate Jewish culture and
traditions while informing the
entire Stanford community about
Judaism.
"We want to show that
Judaism is a culture, not just a
religion," said Corinne Medovoy,
Stanford Hillel's program direc
tor. "The week should be all
encompassing, so it should be a
good chance to showcase that."
The events, held during the
week of Jan. 19-27, are sponsored
by the Hillel Foundation at Stan
ford, a Jewish student organiza
tion, and will feature appearances
by media figures, entertainers and
scholars.
This week will present a larger
and more ambitious venture than
last year's celebration. Thirteen
independent student groups are
scheduled to participate in the
events.
There are more than 2,000
Jewish students at Stanford,
according to Hillel.
"We wanted to educate the
Stanford community about anot h
er ethnic community," said sopho
more Lisa Rubin, an intern at Hil
lel. "Judaism is a subconscious
part of a lot of people's lives."
The program begins today with
a speech by "Sneak Previews" co
host Michael Medved titled "Is
Hollywood Created in a Jewish
Image?" The speech will be deliv

ered as part of a special Friday
nipht Shabbat dinner.
Medved will also speak on Sat
urday night. His speech, "Mixed
Jewish Messages from Hollywood:
The Good, The Bad and The
Ugly," will be at 7 p.m. in Cubber
ley Auditorium.
Organizers hope that the diver
sity of offerings will attract non-
Jews as well as members of the
Jewish community.
Organizers do not view the cel
ebration as tied solely to the Stan
ford campus. "This is part of a
national movement driven bv stu
dents to inform others about Jew
ish life in more ways than just reli
giously," said senior Natalie Grun
feld, chair of the Jewish Relations
Council. "We are becoming more
confident in what it means to be
Jewish."
The program continues on
Sunday with a discussion spon
sored by the Jewish Campus Rela
tions Council titled "Reaching
Consensus on Jewish Communal
Issues: The Role of the Jewish
Campus Relations Council."
In addition to other events,
Rabbi Yoel Kahn will discuss
"Ritual Liturgy and Gay / Lesbian
/ Bisexuality" on Tuesday, and the
Jewish Student Association will
sponsor a cafe night with Jewish
entertainer Marsha Attie on
Thursday.
"We hope to give non-Jewish
students a better glimpse of what
Jewish culture is about," said
Grunfeld. Noting the variety of
programs offered as part of the
week, she said, "We're hoping that
students will be interested in see
ing how Judaism deals with homo
sexuality or kosher wine."
