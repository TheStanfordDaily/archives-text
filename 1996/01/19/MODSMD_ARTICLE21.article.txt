## Women win sixth straight Cardinal hoops to clash with OSU for conference lead

It is said that the measure of a great
team is how well it performs against the
teams it's supposed to beat.
If last night's game is any indication,
then the Stanford women's basketball
squad is headed for big things.
Fresh off an 88-67 thumping of USC
last Saturday, a game which saw Kate
Starbird rack up a school-record 44
points, the Cardinal improved to 5-0 in
Pacific 10 Conference play last night with
a 61-42 drubbing of Oregon (8-5 overall,
0-4 Pacific 10 Conference) — a team
picked to finish fifth in the Pac-10 — in a
tuneup for tomorrow's 7 p.m. showdown
against No. 12 Oregon State.
Starbird and sophomore Naomi Muli
tauaopele paced the Cardinal with 16
points each, while Vanessa Nvgaard
pitched in 13 points and 10 rebounds.
The offense wasn't clicking early for
Stanford, which was held scoreless for the
first five minutes, seven seconds of the
game. Oregon led 9-4 and 11-6 in the
early going, but an 8-0 run gave the Car
dinal a 17-12 lead that it would never

relinquish. Up 25-20 at the break, Stan
ford then used a 9-1 run at the start of
the second half to pull away from the
Ducks as Starbird and Co. cruised to a 61-
42 win.
Oregon head coach Judy Runge caused
a mild stir by reinstating Duck forward
Arianne Boyer before the game. Boyer,
the team's leading scorer, was suspended
from last Saturday's game at Washington
over what Runge referred to as a "differ
ence of opinion."
Boyer did not start but played 34 min
utes in the loss. She was largely ineffec
tive, mananging only 3-of-12 shooting for
a total of nine points — well short of her
18.4 season average.
The rest of the Ducks didn't fare much
better, as Oregon shot only 32 percent
from the field, including a miserable 28
percent in the second half. Only Cindie
Edamura broke into double figures with
11 points.
Starbird, meanwhile, couldn't quite
live up to the stratospheric standard she
set for herself last weekend. The star for
ward buried seven of 14 shots from the
floor but experienced an inevitbale 28-
point dropoff from last Saturday's record
breaking performance. Nonetheless, the
Cardinal improved to 12-2 heading into
tomorrow's game at OSU.

that advanced to the second
round of the NCAA tournament
and, perhaps more notably, hand
ed Stanford its only conference
loss of the season in a 78-73 win
at Gill Coliseum.
This season, with USC strug
gling and Washington limping out
to a 6-5 non-conference record,
Oregon State has emerged as the
leading contender to challenge
the Cardinal's reign atop the Pac
-10 standings.
The Beavers climbed as high as
No. 11 in the top 25 after jumping
out to an 11-1 start, but dropped a
notch in the rankings this week
after suffering a 64-63 loss to
Washington State last Saturday.
"Against Washington State I
thought we had a lackluster
defense," said OSIJ head coach
Judy Spoelstra.
"In the second half, we spent a
lot of energy coming back and we
ran out of gas on offense down the
stretch."
Spearheading the Beaver
offense is superstar forward
Tanja Kostic, last year's Pae-10
Player of the Year who currently
leads the conference in both scor
ing and rebounding with a whop
ping 25.5 points and 11.1
rebounds per game.
A 6-2 senior, Kostic currently
boasts the second-highest scoring
average in the nation.
Kostic leads a formidable
frontline attack that also includes
6-5 center Tina Lelas — last
year's Pac-10 field-goal percent
age champion - and senior for
ward Anette Mollerstrom.
Senior point guard Boky Vidic

and A.J. Dionne comprise the
backcourt.
"Stanford is very solid and
very deep," said Spoelstra of
tomorrow night's matchup.
"Starbird is putting up some good
numbers and we must try to con

tain her the best we can."
If last weekend were any indi
cation, however, such a task may
not prove so easy.
"I don't, know that you can
shut her completely down,"
Spoelstra said.
