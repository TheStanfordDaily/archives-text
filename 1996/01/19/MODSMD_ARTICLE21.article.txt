## Women win sixth straight Cardinal hoops to clash with OSU for conference lead

It is said that the measure of a great
team is how well it performs against the
teams it's supposed to beat.
If last night's game is any indication,
then the Stanford women's basketball
squad is headed for big things.
Fresh off an 88-67 thumping of USC
last Saturday, a game which saw Kate
Starbird rack up a school-record 44
points, the Cardinal improved to 5-0 in
Pacific 10 Conference play last night with
a 61-42 drubbing of Oregon (8-5 overall,
0-4 Pacific 10 Conference) — a team
picked to finish fifth in the Pac-10 — in a
tuneup for tomorrow's 7 p.m. showdown
against No. 12 Oregon State.
Starbird and sophomore Naomi Muli
tauaopele paced the Cardinal with 16
points each, while Vanessa Nvgaard
pitched in 13 points and 10 rebounds.
The offense wasn't clicking early for
Stanford, which was held scoreless for the
first five minutes, seven seconds of the
game. Oregon led 9-4 and 11-6 in the
early going, but an 8-0 run gave the Car
dinal a 17-12 lead that it would never

relinquish. Up 25-20 at the break, Stan
ford then used a 9-1 run at the start of
the second half to pull away from the
Ducks as Starbird and Co. cruised to a 61-
42 win.
Oregon head coach Judy Runge caused
a mild stir by reinstating Duck forward
Arianne Boyer before the game. Boyer,
the team's leading scorer, was suspended
from last Saturday's game at Washington
over what Runge referred to as a "differ
ence of opinion."
Boyer did not start but played 34 min
utes in the loss. She was largely ineffec
tive, mananging only 3-of-12 shooting for
a total of nine points — well short of her
18.4 season average.
The rest of the Ducks didn't fare much
better, as Oregon shot only 32 percent
from the field, including a miserable 28
percent in the second half. Only Cindie
Edamura broke into double figures with
11 points.
Starbird, meanwhile, couldn't quite
live up to the stratospheric standard she
set for herself last weekend. The star for
ward buried seven of 14 shots from the
floor but experienced an inevitbale 28-
point dropoff from last Saturday's record
breaking performance. Nonetheless, the
Cardinal improved to 12-2 heading into
tomorrow's game at OSU.
Currently ranked No. 12 by the Associ
ated Press, the Beavers (12-2, 3-1) return
