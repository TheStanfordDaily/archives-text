## Cardinal prepared to fight country's best competitor 
### Edward Guzman Contributing writer 
Looking to continue the momentum it
gained from last Friday's trouncing of UC-
Santa Cruz, the fourth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team ventures south today
for the 32nd annual UC-Santa Barbara Col
legiate Tournament. UCSB will host 24
teams fort his two-day affair, including eight
of the top 10 teams in the country. No. 2
Long Beach State. No. 5 UCLA, No. (3 USC,
No. 8 Pepperdino, No. 9 Cal State-

Northridge and No. 10 BYU will all partici
pate.
"This is considered the toughest tourna
ment in the country," said Cardinal head
coach Ruben Nieves. "The only disclaimer is
that for many teams, it's their first or sec
ond competition fof the season]. The team
that usually wins is considered the early
favorite, but they are not necessarily the
best team in the long run."
Nieves emphasized that depth and stami-
na will prove pivotal. The team
will play eight matches over the
course of today and Saturday.
"It will be a lot more playing
than we'll ever have," he said.
"If we can win, that's great —
but not with the same six guys
out there. You don't want to
risk an injury doing something
silly that could hurt you later
on."
Accordingly, Stanford will
mix up its strategy. The Cardi
nal will use its new three-block
er alignment less in the UCSB
tournament. Nieves cited the
need to diversify the attack as
well as the need to compensate
for Stanford's depth problems.
"We're a little thin at middle
blocker," he said "I think play
ing [the new alignment] would
mean playing [junior Mike] Hoe
fer and [sophomore Keenan]
Whitehurst more, and I don't
want to do that."
The Cardinal will carry only
15 players, while some teams
will take 20. Nevertheless, Stan
ford remains optimistic about
its chances.
"I think we can win and do
well," Nieves said.
