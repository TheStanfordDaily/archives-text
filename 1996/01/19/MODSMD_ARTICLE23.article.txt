# There's no place like home
## No. 24 Cardinal rolls to 20-point win at Ducks' expense 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Oregon 74

Stanford took it at Oregon early and often and capitalized on
Duck defensive breakdowns to put away its first easy Pacific 10
Conference win of the year 94-74 in front of 4,053 fans in
Maples Pavilion yesterday.
Unshaken by Oregon's defensive switches and full-court
pressure, the No. 24 Cardinal (9-4 overall, 3-2 Pacific 10 Con
ference) put forth its strongest offensive game of the year. The
94 points and 25 assists were both season-highs and the eight
turnovers set a season-low, as Stanford repeatedly beat Duck
defenders back down the court for easy transition baskets.
"I think the assist-to-error ratio tells the whole story," said
Oregon head coach Jerry Green. Oregon turned the ball over 15
times and had only six assists.
Starting in man-to-man and testing the Cardinal with a box
and-one, the Ducks tried to mix up their half-court defense
before trying their full-court press.
"We really handled any defensive changes they had well,"
said head coach Mike Montgomery. "That's the first time we've
shot 50 percent in a long time. Obviously, we play better at
home."
Junior point guard Brevin Knight led all scorers with 30
points (24 in the second half) on 8-of-12 shooting and 11-of-12
from the line. Oregon (9-6, 2-2) could do little to stop him, as he
buried open jumpshots when defenders backed off him and
drove around any defender foolish enough to play him tightly.
I le also had eight assists.
"Brevin's a little streaky, like most kids," Montgomery said.
"Hegot some pretty clean looks, and playing against |thes-foot
-10 Kenya] Wilkins means he doesn't have to look up to him."
Both teams raced out of the opening tip but neither could
grab any advantage over the first 10 minutes. Freshman Kris
Weems nailed a three-pointer to put Stanford up 19-15 and trig
ger a 19-6 run. A three-point play on a lob to Mark Seaton and
eight points during transition pushed the Cardinal ahead 35-21
despite Oregon's full-court defense.
"They really didn't start pressing until we put in our subs,
but that didn't rattle them," Knight said.
The Ducks answered with a mini-run of their own, closing
the halftime score to 37-32, Stanford.
Knight then proceeded to put the game in his back pocket,
making or assisting on seven of the Cardinal's first eight made
baskets in the second half. Suddenly, Stanford was up 63-44
with 10 minutes, 36 seconds left in the game.
"Brevin was excellent and Dion was his usual self," Green
said. "They just ran their offense well regardless of who was in

there.
Mixing and matching his lineup throughout the game, Mont
gomery finally got the contributions off the bench that he's been

Seaton, Rich Jackson and Peter
Sauer all played double-figure
minutes, while Arthur Lee saw
nine minutes of action. The five

him to do. Me scored when he
had opportunities, and when we
needed the ball, he broke up
plays defensively and got us
going the other way."

rebounds with eight.

every position Oregon State will
attempt to run the shot clock
down on every possession.
"They'll do everything they
can to shorten the game," Mont
gomery said. "They'll spread the
court to control the tempo,
which can be psychologically dis
couraging. They'll also change
defenses every opportunity,
from man to zone to box-and-one
to triangle-and-two to trapping."
