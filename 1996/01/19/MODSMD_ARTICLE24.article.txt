# Cardinal reserves spell solid reliefs
## 
### Daniel Kao Editorial staff 
After being run ragged in last week
end's road trip down in Southern Cali
fornia. the Stanford men's basketball
team could hardly wait to bring its
show back home to the friendly con
fines of Maples Pavilion. The familiar
court, friendly faces and cheering
crowd were waiting to stoke the flames
of Cardinal basketball.
But with a sub-capacity audience of
4,053 present for last night's 94-74
Cardinal skewering of the Ducks, the
true Sixth Man came not from any
crowd or bleacher seat but from Stan
ford's very own bench. And it wasn't
just the sixth man off the pine either. It
was the seventh, eighth, ninth, etc. A
languishing, bruised and battered Car
dinal squad found the boost it needed
from its reserves.
Despite the scintillating 30 points of

super guard Brevin Knight, it was the
bench, consisting of guards Arthur Lee
and Kris Weems as well as forwards
Rich Jackson, Mark Seaton and Pete
Sauer, that provided Stanford with an
unlikely group of heroes.
"We had great contribution off the
bench," said Cardinal head coach Mike
Montgomery. "I think that really
helped us. Kris Weems came in and hit
his first couple shots. Rich Jackson
came in and got a couple boards and
made a couple of nice plays defensively.
Art Lee allowed us to rest Brevin a lit
tle bit, made a bucket and played pret
ty smart basketball. I thought that
really helped us to get some time off
the bench.
"We got some guys some time, and I
think that's important because we're
knicked and beat-up and worn down a
little bit physically. It was important to
get some other guys in there to keep
our focus going."

With the Cardinal clinging to a ten
uous 16-15 lead midway through the
first half, freshman Weems started off
the understudy extravaganza with a
three-pointer that extended the Stan
ford lead to four. Weems followed the
trey with a 14-foot baseline jumper on
Stanford's next possession.
Not to be outdone, fellow freshman
Seaton continued the Cardinal bench
roll by laying in an alley-oop despite
being fouled. Overall, in the opening
period, Stanford reserves scored 14 of
the Cardinal's 37 first-half points,
shooting a rock-solid ti-of-9 from the
field.
It wasn't just on the scoreboard
where the bench impressed however.
Montgomery called on freshman back
up point guard Lee to defuse the Ore
gon press in the first half and give
Knight a breather. Lee performed
admirably, scoring two points
with one assist and, more impor
tantly, no turnovers.
"The guys off the bench did ;i
great job," Knight said. "|()ro
gon] really didn't start pressur
ing until we put in subs, and
[the pressurel really didn't rat
tie our subs at all."
While the second half turned
out to he the Hrevin Knight
Show, with the stellar point

guard pouring in 24 dazzling
second half points, there was no
douht that the undercard
belonged to Rich "Action" .Jack
son.
Jackson, proving that the
Stanford bench was more than
just a collection of freshman
wunderkinds, produced four
quality points in the first half
off a slashing layup and hard
nosed tip in, but it wasn't until
the second half that he had the
crowd screaming for more.
Jackson ignited t he ('ardinal
midway through the second half
with an electrifying series of
plays With 12:08 to play, Jack

son tipped in a bucket amidst a
flailing crowd of Duck meat to
give Stanford a 57-42 lead. On
the next Stanford possession,
the hustling Jackson saved a
rebound headed out of bounds,
passing it right to Knight for a
three-point jumper. Jackson
112 ueled the crowd's flames of pas
sion even further bv swiping an
errant Duck pass less than a
minute later. The crowd chant
ed, calling for more action and
more Jackson.
"Rich got some things off the
boards, made a couple of defen
sive plays," Montgomery said.
"And I think that sparked every

body."
Even freshman Sauer, who
did not play in the first half, got
into the act with six second-half
points. With star center Tim
Young out indefinitely with a
back injury, the play of the
bench becomes key for Stanford.
"The play of the bench is
going to be important for the
rest of the year, especially with
Tim out," Jackson said. "Obvi
ously, you lose some scoring
punch with Young out, but I
think people are going to be
ready to pick it up in different
ways in order for us to be suc
cessful. I think it gave the team

a nice lift and energized us in
the first half and through the
second half."
For the game, the Cardinal
bench of Jackson, Lee, Sauer,
Seaton and Weeins shot 12-of-19
for 28 points. Jackson chipped
in with four assists, and Seaton
pounded the boards for five
rebounds.
"I thought they ran their
offense well regardless of who
was in there," Green said. "They
were tough to guard regardless
of who was in there. Seaton
looked better tonight than on
the films we saw, as well as
Sauer. I thought fSauerl was a

lot steadier."
The game ended in fitting
fashion with Seaton jamming a
ball through the hoop, placing
an exclamation point on a night
that proclaimed the power of the
Stanford pine.
"IThe bench] did a great job
for us, said senior guard David
Harbour, a former super sub
himself. ' There are going to be
certain guys who aren't going to
he playing up to par. This shows
how valuable the bench is espe
cially with injuries. You can go
down the list and our bench
gave us a great lift, and that's
what we needed."

his first couple shots. Rich Jackson
came in and got a couple boards and
made a couple of nice plays defensively.
Art Lee allowed us to rest Brevin a lit
tle bit, made a bucket and played pret
ty smart basketball. I thought that
really helped us to get some time off
the bench.
"We got some guys some time, and I
think that's important because we're
knicked and beat-up and worn down a
little bit physically. It was important to
get some other guys in there to keep
our focus going."

With the Cardinal clinging to a ten
uous 16-15 lead midway through the
first half, freshman Weems started off
the understudy extravaganza with a
three-pointer that extended the Stan
ford lead to four. Weems followed the
trey with a 14-foot baseline jumper on
Stanford's next possession.
Not to be outdone, fellow freshman
Seaton continued the Cardinal bench
roll by laying in an alley-oop despite
being fouled. Overall, in the opening
period, Stanford reserves scored 14 of
the Cardinal's 37 first-half points,
shooting a rock-solid ti-of-9 from the
field.
It wasn't just on the scoreboard
where the bench impressed however.
Montgomery called on freshman back
up point guard Lee to defuse the Ore
gon press in the first half and give
Knight a breather. Lee performed
admirably, scoring two points
with one assist and, more impor
tantly, no turnovers.
"The guys off the bench did ;i
great job," Knight said. "|()ro
gon] really didn't start pressur
ing until we put in subs, and
[the pressurel really didn't rat
tie our subs at all."
While the second half turned
out to he the Hrevin Knight
Show, with the stellar point

guard pouring in 24 dazzling
second half points, there was no
douht that the undercard
belonged to Rich "Action" .Jack
son.
Jackson, proving that the
Stanford bench was more than
just a collection of freshman
wunderkinds, produced four
quality points in the first half
off a slashing layup and hard
nosed tip in, but it wasn't until
the second half that he had the
crowd screaming for more.
Jackson ignited t he ('ardinal
midway through the second half
with an electrifying series of
plays With 12:08 to play, Jack

son tipped in a bucket amidst a
flailing crowd of Duck meat to
give Stanford a 57-42 lead. On
the next Stanford possession,
the hustling Jackson saved a
rebound headed out of bounds,
passing it right to Knight for a
three-point jumper. Jackson
112 ueled the crowd's flames of pas
sion even further bv swiping an
errant Duck pass less than a
minute later. The crowd chant
ed, calling for more action and
more Jackson.
"Rich got some things off the
boards, made a couple of defen
sive plays," Montgomery said.
"And I think that sparked every

body."
Even freshman Sauer, who
did not play in the first half, got
into the act with six second-half
points. With star center Tim
Young out indefinitely with a
back injury, the play of the
bench becomes key for Stanford.
"The play of the bench is
going to be important for the
rest of the year, especially with
Tim out," Jackson said. "Obvi
ously, you lose some scoring
punch with Young out, but I
think people are going to be
ready to pick it up in different
ways in order for us to be suc
cessful. I think it gave the team

a nice lift and energized us in
the first half and through the
second half."
For the game, the Cardinal
bench of Jackson, Lee, Sauer,
Seaton and Weeins shot 12-of-19
for 28 points. Jackson chipped
in with four assists, and Seaton
pounded the boards for five
rebounds.
"I thought they ran their
offense well regardless of who
was in there," Green said. "They
were tough to guard regardless
of who was in there. Seaton
looked better tonight than on
the films we saw, as well as
Sauer. I thought fSauerl was a

lot steadier."
The game ended in fitting
fashion with Seaton jamming a
ball through the hoop, placing
an exclamation point on a night
that proclaimed the power of the
Stanford pine.
"IThe bench] did a great job
for us, said senior guard David
Harbour, a former super sub
himself. ' There are going to be
certain guys who aren't going to
he playing up to par. This shows
how valuable the bench is espe
cially with injuries. You can go
down the list and our bench
gave us a great lift, and that's
what we needed."
