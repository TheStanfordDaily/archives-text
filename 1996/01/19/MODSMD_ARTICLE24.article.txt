# Cardinal reserves spell solid reliefs

### Daniel Kao Editorial staff 
After being run ragged in last week
end's road trip down in Southern Cali
fornia. the Stanford men's basketball
team could hardly wait to bring its
show back home to the friendly con
fines of Maples Pavilion. The familiar
court, friendly faces and cheering
crowd were waiting to stoke the flames
of Cardinal basketball.
But with a sub-capacity audience of
4,053 present for last night's 94-74
Cardinal skewering of the Ducks, the
true Sixth Man came not from any
crowd or bleacher seat but from Stan
ford's very own bench. And it wasn't
just the sixth man off the pine either. It
was the seventh, eighth, ninth, etc. A
languishing, bruised and battered Car
dinal squad found the boost it needed
from its reserves.
Despite the scintillating 30 points of

super guard Brevin Knight, it was the
bench, consisting of guards Arthur Lee
and Kris Weems as well as forwards
Rich Jackson, Mark Seaton and Pete
Sauer, that provided Stanford with an
unlikely group of heroes.
"We had great contribution off the
bench," said Cardinal head coach Mike
Montgomery. "I think that really
helped us. Kris Weems came in and hit
his first couple shots. Rich Jackson
came in and got a couple boards and
made a couple of nice plays defensively.
Art Lee allowed us to rest Brevin a lit
tle bit, made a bucket and played pret
ty smart basketball. I thought that
really helped us to get some time off
the bench.
"We got some guys some time, and I
think that's important because we're
knicked and beat-up and worn down a
little bit physically. It was important to
get some other guys in there to keep
our focus going."

With the Cardinal clinging to a ten
uous 16-15 lead midway through the
first half, freshman Weems started off
the understudy extravaganza with a
three-pointer that extended the Stan
ford lead to four. Weems followed the
trey with a 14-foot baseline jumper on
Stanford's next possession.
Not to be outdone, fellow freshman
Seaton continued the Cardinal bench
roll by laying in an alley-oop despite
being fouled. Overall, in the opening
period, Stanford reserves scored 14 of
the Cardinal's 37 first-half points,
shooting a rock-solid ti-of-9 from the
field.
It wasn't just on the scoreboard
where the bench impressed however.
Montgomery called on freshman back
up point guard Lee to defuse the Ore
gon press in the first half and give
Knight a breather. Lee performed
