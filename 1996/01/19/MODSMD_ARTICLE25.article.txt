# Women's gymnastics to feature youth on floor and bench in season opener vs. Davis
## Roster features rookie head coach, four sophomores and three freshmen 
### Keith Rabkin 
Tonight in Burnham Pavilion,
Lisa Izzi makes her debut as head
coach of women's gymnastics
when the Cardinal vaults into
action against UC-Davis. The
7:30 p.m. competition pits the
Cardinal, which finished 18-12
last year, against a Division II
Davis team which failed to win a

single meet last season.
In its first meet of the season,
Stanford looks to perform its
techniques cleanly and sharply.
The Cardinal will use the
encounter as a chance to train
under pressure for its upcoming
meets against Arizona and Pacific
10 Conference champion UCLA.
Although tonight's confronta
tion will be Izzi's first as head

coach, she is far from inexperi
enced. Izzi has served as the Car
dinal's assistant coach for four
years, working closely with Stan
ford gymnasts to spark confi
dence, determination and skill.
The rest of the Cardinal squad
is young as well. Only two upper
classmen return this season. Co
captains Linda Chun and Ariel
Passanisi will provide leadership

for a small team consisting of
mostly sophomores and fresh
men.
"Chun is a strong leader and
solid performer who will bring
experience to our young team,"
Izzi said. Passanisi, who posted
career-highs on the balance beam
and vault last season as a sopho
more, will also lend consistency to
the Stanford team.
The sophomores, who com
prise the majority of Stanford's
small team, are led by Misty
Moore and Keri Monahan. Moore,
who placed fifth on the balance
beam at the 1995 NCAA West
Regionals, is calm and depend
able. She looks forward to contin
uing her excellence on the beam
while adding new techniques to
her routine. "More difficult rou
tines can be a mental challenge,
but I have trained really hard,"
Moore said.
Moore will compete in all four
events (floor exercises, vault,
uneven bars and balance beam)
and attempt a new dismount from
the beam. Monahan, a 1994-95
Stanford honor athlete, will con
tribute to Stanford's success on
the vault. Last season, Monahan
set a Cardinal record for the vault
with a score of 9.900 and finished
12th in all-around competition at
the Pac-10 Championships. The

onships. The Cardinal also expects
strong seasons from sophomores
Christie Jones and Amy Neil as it

strives to place high in a competi
tive Pac-10 conference.
The team's freshmen are also
experienced, as Katie Fitzpatrick,
Tracey Kohl and Amy Murakami
have participated in many compe
titions. Fitzpatrick and Murakami
will be strong assets to the team's

bar routine; Fitzpatrick placed in
the U.S. Classic while Murakami
placed in the Capital Cup. Kohl,
who finished first all-around at the
1995 Fiesta Bowl, promises to be a
crowd-pleaser, as she brings explo
siveness to the Cardinal's floor
routine.
