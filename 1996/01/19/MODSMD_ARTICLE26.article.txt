The Cardinal wrestling team
returned to Stanford in the
early-morning hours yesterday
bearing good news and bad
news. The good news was that
the Cardinal had just gone toe
to toe with national power
house Fresno State and
remained competitive in seven
of nine matches, claiming three
victories. However, the bad
news was that Stanford let
those close matches get away in
crucial moments, falling 28-9.

â€” Jimmy Aguirre

Senior Matt Cano (126
pounds) and sophomores Doug
Bardsley (150) and Jeff Grant
(158) secured wins for the Car
dinal. Cano defeated Dan
Greene by a 3-1 margin, while
Bardsley continued his win
streak with a 9-5 decision over
Kyle Swan.
Grant continued to impress
despite gaining weight after the

Aggie Open on Jan. 13. (He had
to drop 16 pounds to be eligible
for the 158-pound weight class.)
The triumph encouraged Grant
and his teammates since Grant
beat Byron Campbell, the West
ern Athletic Conference Player
of the Week, by a decisive final
score of 10-4.
Stanford's four losses came
in matches which could have
gone either way. Junior Bryan
Vaniman (190) wrestled Lalo
Moz, ranked seventh nationally
in his weight class. The match
was tied with 15 seconds left in
the match, but in the waning
moments, Moz took down Vani
man and registered a victory.
The contest between sopho
more Scott Chapman (167) and
Fresno State's Alfonso Tucker
was also decided at the very
end. Chapman was in control
the entire match. However, as
he was getting ready to finish
off his opponent, Tucker mus
tered a surprising comeback
which began with a take-down
of Chapman.
Most down-trodden was
senior team captain .Jimmy
Aguirre (142), who lost 5-3 to
Yero Washington, whom
Aguirre had defeated in the sea
son-opening All-California Open.
The loss came as a surprise to
head coach Chris Horpel, but
Aguirre had felt a recent decrease
in his confidence.
"1 just wrestled poorly,"
Aguirre said. "It was a guy I had
already beaten. I definitely
thought that I should have beaten
him again. I think I beat myself
with lack of confidence. My tech
nique and conditioning were

good. I just need to get that confi
dence back, which comes from
more competition."
"I was pleased that we were
competitive in most of the weight
classes," Horpel said. "When the
moment becomes intense, that's
when weaknesses are finally
exposed. Vaniman, Aguirre and
Chapman made mistakes when
things got really intense, so we
now know what to work on.
"It often takes a good team like
Fresno State to show you those
weaknesses. We can now work on
those weaknesses."
The other losses came from

sophomore Robert Hatta (134), who
fell 17-7, senior Mark Ryzewicz
(177), who lost 9-4, and sophomore
Chris Serjak (heavyweight), who
was pinned in two minutes, 31 sec
onds. The Cardinal also forfeited
one match due to injury.
As far as injuries are con
cerned, Stanford hopes to have
sophomore Jason Gladden back in
its lineup this weekend when it
tackles Cal State-Bakersfield.
Seniors Sahlan Martin and Tod
Surmon should also return to
practice by next week, although
they may not be ready to enter
dual meets or tournaments.
