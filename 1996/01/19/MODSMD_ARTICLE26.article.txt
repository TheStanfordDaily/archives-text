The Cardinal wrestling team
returned to Stanford in the
early-morning hours yesterday
bearing good news and bad
news. The good news was that
the Cardinal had just gone toe
to toe with national power
house Fresno State and
remained competitive in seven
of nine matches, claiming three
victories. However, the bad
news was that Stanford let
those close matches get away in
crucial moments, falling 28-9.

1 just wrestled poor
ly. It was a guy I had
already beaten/
â€” Jimmy Aguirre

Senior Matt Cano (126
pounds) and sophomores Doug
Bardsley (150) and Jeff Grant
(158) secured wins for the Car
dinal. Cano defeated Dan
Greene by a 3-1 margin, while
Bardsley continued his win
streak with a 9-5 decision over
Kyle Swan.
Grant continued to impress
despite gaining weight after the

Aggie Open on Jan. 13. (He had
to drop 16 pounds to be eligible
for the 158-pound weight class.)
The triumph encouraged Grant
and his teammates since Grant
beat Byron Campbell, the West
ern Athletic Conference Player
of the Week, by a decisive final
score of 10-4.
Stanford's four losses came
in matches which could have
gone either way. Junior Bryan
Vaniman (190) wrestled Lalo
Moz, ranked seventh nationally
in his weight class. The match
was tied with 15 seconds left in
the match, but in the waning
moments, Moz took down Vani
man and registered a victory.
The contest between sopho
more Scott Chapman (167) and
Fresno State's Alfonso Tucker
was also decided at the very
end. Chapman was in control
the entire match. However, as
he was getting ready to finish
off his opponent, Tucker mus
tered a surprising comeback
which began with a take-down
of Chapman.
Most down-trodden was
senior team captain .Jimmy
Aguirre (142), who lost 5-3 to
Yero Washington, whom
Aguirre had defeated in the sea
