# Diversions Alter Dark
## The 						Night is still young 
### 
"Let there be light."
The Bible (early on, somewhere)
In the beginning, Night was just about all
that there was. From dawn to dusk, morn
ing to evening, early, late, sideways and
upside-down it was just, well, Nighttime all
over. Darkness just about everywhere. And
darkness, of course, was a clear indicator of
that Nighttime. And there was lots of it. And
it was good.
Then someone turned on the lights. Just
one Hip of the switch and a rivalry of more
importance than Rocky and That Russian Guy
From The Fourth Movie was born. Suddenly,
Night was vying for precious airtime with that
new concoction created by just adding light:
the Day.
Well, years have passed and the folks work
ing on the PR crew lor Day have certainly been
putting in overtime. Just look at all those com
pound words and such. Today is, well, Fri-
DAV. Two weeks from now is Groundhog
DAY. March 19th is my hirth-DAY (my
favorite color is green, thanks for asking). You
are reading the Stanford 1 )AY-ly. Yadda yadda.
No one can argue that the übiquitous Day
a concept that is nary a lew billion years old
has become an important part of our lives.
After all, on the average, Day makes up about
half of our very existence. And with that excit
ingly plosive "d" up front, you might just think
that Daytime could manage to be cool.
Sorry, try again some other Day.
Daytime is boring. It's ordinary. It's blah.
Dianetically opposed to tin* Day, however, is
wbiit mil lire intended before (lenesis hetran:

Night. And Night is just so darn cool. Night is
sleepover parties. Night is gangsters and
speakeasies and dancing and car chases. Night
is parking in the high school parking lot with
your girlfriend before the rent-a-cops arrive.
Night is shooting stars and the man in the
moon and eclipses you're allowed to watch.
Night is Gilbert Gottfried and what's-her-face
with the outfits.
Day is what's expected of you — Night, on
the other hand, is considered a challenge. If you
"stay up all Night," you've accomplished some
thing major. They've even got a name for that:
an " all-Nigh ter." See, that even sounds cool. If
you stay up all Day, however, no one even says
anything about it, if they bother to notice.
Then, of course there are "the good ole
Days." Oooh, that's exciting. And the "Days of
our lives' and "school Days" and "Daytime
soaps." Real crrrazy stuff here. Doris Day,
even. But let the sun go down and we've got
ourselves a Night to remember. "The Night of
tin* Living Dead The "heat of the Night.
Things that actually "go bump in the Night."
And don't forget "(K)Night Rider," with
young David Hasselhoff fighting crime for the
vigilante Phoenix Foundation while keeping
his best friend Kit waxed, buffed and free of
dents. That's so cool. '<)f course "Happy
Days" is cool too, but that's cause Fon/ie
wears leather, which is a whole other issue, i
And just look at the word Night. It's got
those cool-ass silent letters in the middle of it.
Not one, hut two of 'em, right there in the
middle. A "g" and an "h. And you don't hear
either of them. You could even stick a "kin
front and not change thi' pronunciation. Try

1 hiit with KDAY and it kinda sounds like a
talk-radio station.
We know that Night is cool, hut it also can
he good. "(Jood Night' makes perfect sense.
Try it. "Good Night, Mom." "Good Night,
Ladies." "Good Night, Scarecrow." Try that
with Day and it's just not the same. No one
ever says "Good Day" unless they are drink
ing a Foster's and carrying a boomerang.
Of course, the whole "good" thing brings
up the complex issue of morning, afternoon
and evening. They're all "good." too, hut just
parts of Day. Night doesn't really need parts,
though; Night is fine on its own. Day, howev
er, equals morning plus afternoon plus
evening. Plus dawn and dusk, for that matter.
Why does Day need subsets? What's up with
that? It's probably just a publicity stunt.
Anyway, it may have taken billions and bil
lions of years for it to happen, but that whole
"let there be light" thing has finally worn out
of style and an old favorite has returned to the
limelight. Nighttime has finally been given its
time in the sun.
It may be a little retro, a barkening back to
the times before Abraham and Isaac, but
Night is still a happening time to be alive.
Stock up on Vivarin, grab a friend and pause
to appreciate the simplicity and the style of
the darkness.
And let t here be Night.
