# Medical Center OKs heart-lung transplant
## Down syndrome patient approved for wait list 
### Joanna Dickler Contributing writer 
In what could he a precedent-setting rul
ing, the Stanford Medical Center has com
mitted to performing a heart-lung transplant
on a 35-year-old woman with Down syn
drome as soon as a donor becomes available,
reversing a decision it made last year.
"This is a case of absolutely continental
significance," said Dr. Bill Bronston, a Cali
fornia state rehabilitation administrator.
"It's the first case of a person with a disabili
ty getting successfully put on the waiting
list."
Sandra Jensen signed official papers at the
Medical (-enter Wednesday after a year of re
ject ions from both Stanford and UC-San
Diego, the only two hospitals in the state ap
proved by Medi-Cal to perform the operation.
She is now on the waiting list to find a suit
able donor, a process that usually takes a lit
tle more than two years.
Only about 70 heart-lung transplants are
performed in the United States each year,
with approximately 200 patients on the wait
ing list.
Don Gibbons, director of the Medical Cen
ter's Office of Communications, refused to
comment on Jensen's status with Stanford,
saying the matter was subject, to patient
physician confidentiality.
Jensen, an advocate for disabled persons,
was told by her physicians in January last
year that she had approximately two years to
live with a failing heart and lungs if she did
not receive a transplant. She has had a heart
murmur since birth, a result of her Down
syndrome.
Down syndrome is a genetic disorder re
sulting from gratuitous genetic material on

the 21st chromosome. These extra genes
cause certain characteristics to be manifested
in those with the condition, such as mental
retardation, a short life expectancy and phys
ical traits like epicanthic folds over the eyes
and decreased muscle tone. Heart problems
are another related complication.
Last March, Stanford rejected Jensen's
application, saying in a letter that her Down
syndrome made her an unsuitable candidate
for the procedure, said Dr. Philip Bach,
Jensen's cardiologist in Sacramento. Both
Stanford and UC-San Diego had said that
Jensen did not have the mental capacity to
deal with potential complications resulting
from the transplant.
Stanford "probably had some sort of
stereotype in its mind," Bach said, adding
that he thought the turnaround came when
Stanford "was willing to spend the time" to
"look at [Jensen 1 as an individual" and evalu
ate her records carefully.
A good deal of lobbying was done on
Jensen's behalf to get Stanford to reconsider
its original decision, according to Denny
Amundson, director of the State Department
of Developmental Services.
"We petitioned to have it reconsidered. We
thought Sandra was a suitable candidate and
assured Stanford that she would get appro
priate care lifter the operation," Amundson
said.
In addition, the Office of Civil Rights in
the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services informed the Medical Center that its
rejection of Jensen as a patient represented a
violation of the Americans with Disabilities
Act, said Brontson.
Stanford's initial three-sentence refusal
was "completely inadequate. 'I hey
realized they were going to leave a
black smoking hole" if the deci
sion remained unchanged, Bron
ston said.
"Every major news [organiza

tion 1 media was watching the
drama unfold," Bronston contin
ued. "Stanford was fully cog
nizant of San Diego's decision" to
put Jensen provisionally on the
donor waiting list in November,
he said.
"We're absolutely delighted
Stanford reconsidered its decision
and put Sandra on the waiting
list," Amundson said. "She's been

struggling for a year now . . . and
the clock is ticking."
Jensen "lost about 10 months
on the list," said her mother, Kav
DeMaio.
According to DeMaio, the opera
tion will probably be funded by
Medicare, Jensen's primary insurer
"The staff at Stanford does not
anticipate any problems" in get
ting Medicare's backing, DeMaio

said. She guessed that Medicare
would probably approve the
surgery by the end of the month.
The operation is expected to
cost around $250,000, according
to Bronston.
"We're very happy that Stan
ford is where we ended up," said
DeMaio. Shi' considers Stanford's
reconsideration to be a result of an
examination of her dauirhter as an

individual rather than a type.
"lit was! tenacity, 1 think,"
DeMaio said with a laugh. "Basi
cally that's been all Sandra's life,
getting people to look at her as an
individual. It was easier to look at
her than to keep ignoring her."
As for the allegations that
Jensen is in capable of doing
with post-surgical requirements
DeMaio said, "they were people

that hadn't met Sandra."
Jensen, who has lived by her
self since age 20, "is feeling very
overwhelmed," DeMaio said.
"She's always been outspoken
as an advocate for the disabled,
but she didn't like to talk about
her personal health, DeMaio con
tinued. "It has been extremely
stressful for her. Anybody fight
ing for their life, it's difficult."
