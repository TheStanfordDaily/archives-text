# Burt (sans Ernie) nabs editor's job
## 
### Jesse Ochs Feld Lizzie McG. Oldman Special to The New York Times 
In a shocking, out-of-left-field upset,
Stanford Daily Managing Editor Burt
Noble Herman was elected as the paper's
next editor in chief last night.
R. VV. Herman Jr., who displayed his
standard level of competence by popping
the champagne cork a mere four feet,
was declared the victor by a slim margin,
receiving 55 votes to the two of his clos
est competitor, ASSU apparatchik
Danny Bressler. Bressler had mounted a
wildly successful write-in campaign on
his platform of new seatbacks and large
kickbacks.
Third place was a four-way tie
between Ad Manager Penny Chu, Tiny
Tim, Joe Jonah Euclid and "someone
else."
A pall was cast over the wild festivities
at the Daily office by a reference to Burt
Ilyich Herman's long-hidden past. "He's
a fascist," was written on one ballot in
support of the Russian and East Euro
pean Studies scholar.
Known as "the Photo Stud" at the
start of his Daily career, Burt "Scotty"
1 lerman's way with women was noted by
former Daily Editor Andy Dworkin
(source # 1), who last year shared a two
room double with the tyrant-to-be. "Burt
was one of my two favorite roommates,"
said the mustachioed one.
Apparently unsure of the day of the
week, Herman answered questions from
the Daily staff in one of his stunning
weekend-wear ensembles. Asked why he
would make a good editor, Herman
pointed out that he had followed the
same non-traditional path to the editor's
seat as had the great svengali of Daily
editors, some guy named Rajiv.
His fascination with this Rajiv fellow
(the authors would describe him in
greater detail, but demonstrating a

knowledge of his identity would destroy
Herman's significance as an editor) was
further demonstrated through the
course of the traditional grill session,
prompting many to speculate that this
former editor had made a particularly
strong impact on Herman's life.
"If I've played a seminal role, woe is
the next volume," the guy (source #2)
said when contacted — damned if the
authors know how. "Tell him to take his
flattery and shove it up his ass," the man
with the funny last name continued.
Daily staffers, by and large, were
pleased with the election's outcome. "I'm
sure that Burt'll be a great editor; I just
hope I'm still around when he dies," said
Obituary Beat Writer Elizabeth Gold
man (source #3 — Phew!).
"Big deal — so he won the election,"
said current Editor in Chief Sarah Katz.
"What I want to see is that Brigadoon
dance. And don't even think of cutting
this quote, Oxfeld, you piddling con
tributing writer."
Some, however, were less than pleased
with Herman's election. "He's such a
bumbling fool," commented a vertically
challenged staffer who was out of town
and could not be reached for comment.
Herman categorically dismissed that
accusation. "Boombooly, boombooly,
boombooly," he insisted, flailing his arms
wildly.
But the complaints persisted. "I hate
Burt," said Duran From Type & Design,
who promptly began peddling member
ships in his club of the same name.
And others who once held a positive
view of the new boss were already grow
ing disillusioned. "Burt," said former
Editorial Consort Gabriela Teodorescu,
"you're starting to piss me off."
This story, completed past the 5, 6:30, H
and 10:30 p.m. deadlines, must inher
ently he as newsworthy as Kennedy's
assassination.
