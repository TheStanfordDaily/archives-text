# Loan default rate is falling

The rate of default on college loans is falling, accord
ing to a new survey conducted by the National Council of
Higher Education Loan Programs. The lower default
rate leaves taxpayers footing a smaller bill.
The Chronicle of Higher Education reported last week
that the survey found a decrease in default rates, from
22.4 percent in 1990 to 12 percent in 1993.
In addition, taxpayers spent $2.2 billion on defaulted
loans in 1995. In 1991, they spent $3.2 billion.
The council's president, Brett Lief, attributed the
default decrease to the outreach efforts of colleges,
lenders and guarantee agencies.
"If a borrower has problems, he receives more time
ly information and superior counseling," Lief said. "He
can consolidate his loans, ask for smaller monthly pay
ments. There is more flexibility." He also credited the
drop to the elimination of high-risk schools from the
program.
The council, which serves as a lobbying group for
guarantee agencies, produced the survey to help respond
to the current anti-student aid sentiment in Washing
ton.
"We need to move on from partisan politics surround
ing the issue and get the money to the kids who need it,"
Lief emphasized.
Lief also noted that Stanford has historically main
tained a low default rate, and Sue Wood, an assistant
director of the Financial Aid Office, agreed.
According to Wood, Stanford's default prevention pro
gram has not changed significantly during the past few
years. The office offers entrance and graduation loan
counseling to help students understand the terms of
their loans.
"We're doing pretty much the same thing as far as
default prevention. Perhaps the default decrease is a
function of the economy," Wood said.
The council gathered survey information through
guarantee agencies rather than using the Department of
Education's National Student Loan Data System, which
was criticized in the fall as inaccurate by many colleges
and universities, including Stanford.
Lief acknowledged the criticism. "We've had con
cerns about the new system," he said. "One of our con
cerns was the accuracy of its information, so we
obtained our information from individual guarantee
agencies."
