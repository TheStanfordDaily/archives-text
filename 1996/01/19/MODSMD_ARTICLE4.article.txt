# China, Mexico potential study sites

Hoping to got students into emerging political
and economic areas of significance, the Overseas
Studies Program is considering adding pro
grams in China and Mexico.
The two new centers — while long-standing
topics of discussion — have yet to be officially
proposed, said Overseas Studies Director Rus
sell Herman.
"China is a long-standing curiosity," Berman
said, "but not something we are considering im

minently, as in next year. There are all sorts of
questions that a program there brings up. First
there's the issue of picking a location in China —
there are lots of possible cities."
Beyond logistical issues, Berman also ex
pressed concern that the intellectual atmos
phere created by the Chinese government might
create problems for a program there.
"In a program that would offer courses about
politics, history and society, a student should bo
able to ask a question about Tibet and get a rea
sonable answer," he said. "OSP is not ready to
believe that we can guarantee our students the

requisite freedom of thought that Stanford stu
dents should have."
For three years, Stanford has run a summer
language program in Beijing. Because the pro
gram is language intensive, rather than focusing
on cultural studies, Asian Languages Prof. Chao
Fen Sun explained it has avoided issues concern
ing academic freedom.
"The way I envision a branch campus is way
different from how I see our summer campus
now," Sun said. "The last two years, our sum-
mer program was controlled by
Chinese professors. To set up a
branch campus, we need to be in
control. It's hard because we want
to use their campus and their
teachers and at the same time we
want to maintain control."
Though questions about loca
tion remain, Sun added that he sees
Beijing as the best place to set up a
Stanford center.
"From my angle, there is no bet
ter place," Sun said. "First, they
speak the standard language in Bei
jing. In Chinese the dialects are so
different that it's like the difference
between Spanish and Italian —
both are romance languages but
they aren't the same. A second rea
son is that Beijing is kind of a cen
ter for the Chinese political sys
tem."

As far as opening a campus in
Mexico, Berman said, Overseas
Studies is exploring possibilities.
"The program in Santiago is
thriving," Berman said. "But
America is a big place. We have four
campuses in Western Europe;
there's no reason we shouldn't
have more than one in Latin Amer
ica. The relations between the U.S.
and Mexico have been developing in
interesting ways in recent years,
and I see lots of possibilities there."
Overseas Studies has not offi
cially submitted a proposal to set up
campuses in either China or Mexi
co, according to Assoc. Dean of
Humanities and Science Steve
Haber.
In addition, Overseas Studies is
planning to abolish the Russian
language requirement for studying
at Stanford's Moscow campus.
Starting next fall quarter, stu
dents who don't know Russian will
be accepted into the program and
will travel to Russia on Aug. 31 — a

month earlier than students who
have studied the language — to
enter a four-week immersion pro
gram.
Utilizing that extra time, stu
dents will have covered a year's
worth of material by the end of the
quarter, said Herman. Currently,
students at the Moscow program
must have taken three quarters of
university-level Russian.
"Learning the language turned
out to be a big barrier for many stu
dents who wanted to study in
Moscow," Herman said. "Because a
year of the language was required,
it was very difficult for students to
fill that requirement."
Very few students leave high
school with a knowledge of Rus
sian, he added.
"In the lifetime of current Stan
ford students, the opportunities in
Russia for study of culture, busi
ness and politics are immense," he
said. "Russia was closed to us for an
awfully long time."

Most students who have trav
eled to Russia would agree that
they have largely learned the lan
guage while there, said senior
Melanie Ramiro, who studied in
Moscow and is an academic adviser
for the program.
"For the most part, when you're
at home over the summer and not
speaking Russian you forget a lot of
what you learned during the year,"
Ramiro said. "Students who don't
know Russian when they get there
will be taking tutorials that are
either one-on-one or very close to it,
so they'll learn really quickly."
The change will also allow more
students who aren't international
relations or Slavic language majors
to consider the program, Ramiro
said.
"There are a lot of students who
are scared to do the Moscow pro
gram because they worry about fit
ting in a year of Russian and then
[taking] a quarter or two abroad,"
he said.
