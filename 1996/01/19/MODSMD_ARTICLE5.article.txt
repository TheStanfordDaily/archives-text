# Dedication
## Newly inhabited Gates Building should be ready for opening ceremony 
### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
Though scaffolding and construction
workers still surround the Bill Gates
Computer Science Building, plans are on
for the scheduled Jan. 30 dedication cere
mony.
The main event will be a speech by Bill
Gates, chief executive officer and co-founder
of Microsoft Corp., who provided the initial
gift of $6 million for the project. Gates will
speak during a discussion open to the public
and also at an invitation-only academic sym
posium.
Mark Jones, director of Facilities Project
Management, said the building will be
ready. "The construction crews should be off'
the site by Jan. 29 — weather permitting,"
he said.
The remaining work involves "primarily
completion of some exterior finishes," in
cluding the stone siding on the north facade
and landscaping work around the building,
Jones said. Minor adjustments are still
being made to the building's state-of-the-art
lock-and-key system, he added.
The Computer Science Department
moved into the building over winter break,
transferring more than 500 people and near
ly 1,000 computers. Both professors and
graduate students have offices in the build
ing.
Some rooms are already being used for
small classes, but lecture halls might not be
used until spring quarter to allow the Stan
ford Instructional Television Network to
finish installing equipment, said Eileen
Schwappach, who helped coordinate the de
partment's planning for the building.
