# Dedication
## Newly inhabited Gates Building should be ready for opening ceremony 
### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
Though scaffolding and construction
workers still surround the Bill Gates
Computer Science Building, plans are on
for the scheduled Jan. 30 dedication cere
mony.
The main event will be a speech by Bill
Gates, chief executive officer and co-founder
of Microsoft Corp., who provided the initial
gift of $6 million for the project. Gates will
speak during a discussion open to the public
and also at an invitation-only academic sym
posium.
Mark Jones, director of Facilities Project
Management, said the building will be
ready. "The construction crews should be off'
the site by Jan. 29 — weather permitting,"
he said.
The remaining work involves "primarily
completion of some exterior finishes," in
cluding the stone siding on the north facade
and landscaping work around the building,
Jones said. Minor adjustments are still
being made to the building's state-of-the-art
lock-and-key system, he added.
The Computer Science Department
moved into the building over winter break,
transferring more than 500 people and near
ly 1,000 computers. Both professors and
graduate students have offices in the build
ing.
Some rooms are already being used for
small classes, but lecture halls might not be
used until spring quarter to allow the Stan
ford Instructional Television Network to
finish installing equipment, said Eileen
Schwappach, who helped coordinate the de
partment's planning for the building.

Still under construction, the Bill Gates Computer Science Building is already partly occu
pied and should be ready to open by the end of this month.
Despite some minor inconve
niences caused by the ongoing
construction, the building's
occupants seem pleased with
their new home.
"You're trying to dodge
things, and it's hard to get in
and out," said Laura Kenny-
Carlson, an administrative
associate, "but the building's
great."
The inconvenience "is a tem
porary situation that's going to
stop in a couple of weeks," said
Hob Englemore, a senior
research scientist in the depart
ment's Knowledge Systems Lab
oratory.
"Our goal was to be opera
tional by Jan. 9 and we succeed
ed," Scbwappach added. "People
love the building."
Jones said Project Manager
Olivier Pieron and Construc
tion Manager Maggie Burgett
deserve credit for the success.
If problems do arise, he added
that "the building will be under
warranty for some time," and
his department and others "will
be carefully monitoring for any
adjustments or repairs lhat
may be needed."
"We can't simply build it and
walk away," Jones said.
