# Later retirement ages prompt review request
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Stanford faculty members today
are retiring at a later age than they
did 20 years ago â€” a change that
has caused some to wonder what
steps can be taken to encourage
more timely retirements.
A solution to the problem may be
found in University retirement pro
grams, according to a new report
presented to the Facuity Senate last
week.
The report recommends, among
other things, a review of Stanford's
contributory retirement plan and
its early retirement buyout pro
gram in hopes of assessing their
"cost and effectiveness" in yielding
appropriate ret irement rates.
While faculty agree that the re
tirement programs should be re
evaluated, there is some disagree
ment about whether changes are
needed.
The report, titled "Planning in
an Era of Change," is the result of a
three-and-a-half year study by the
Planning and Policy Board, a com
mittee created by the senate to un
dertake strategic planning.
According to the report, in 1994
the average age of faculty retire
ment at Stanford was 68.5. In com
parison, the average age prior to
1978 was 64.
In addition, the report found
that faculty are generally older
than they were about 20 years ago.

In humanities and social sciences,
for example, the average age of
Stanford faculty has increased from
43 in 1976 to 49 in 1994. The age of
faculty in science and engineering
increased from 44 to 47 in those
same years.
These numbers match the na
tional trend at other private re
search universities, the report said.
The report also found that the
structure of Stanford's contributo
ry retirement plan encourages fac
ulty members to retire later be
cause this often nets significant fi
nancial earnings.
The correlation between earn
ings and age prompted the board's
recommendation to review the Uni
versity's contributory retirement
plan, said Biological Sciences Prof.
Robert Simoni, a board member.
Under the contributory retire
ment plan, the University con
tributes 5 percent to an employee's
retirement fund each year and then
matches employee contributions to
the fund up to an additional 5 per
cent.
Each employee chooses how to
invest these retirement monies, pri
marily into stock market funds,
said James Franklin, associate vice
provost for total compensation of
personnel services.
According to the report, retiring
at iige 70 instead of fige6s can mean
major earnings. For example, the
retirement income of a 70-year-old
will be 67 percent to 100 percent
higher than if that person retired at
age 65, assuming that the person
continues to contribute 15 percent
or more of his or her annual salary
and current retirement funds con
tinue to grow at reasonable rates.
However, faculty don't see
these financial incentives as a
major reason for the increased
retirement ages. "Personally, I
don't think faculty see money as a
key to retiring," said Anne Gaddy,
senior associate dean for adminis
tration in the School of Engineer
ing and a member of the Universi
ty's Committee on Faculty and
Staff Benefits. "Most faculty have
a real passion. . . . They enjoy
what they do."
Stanford's contributory retire
ment program differs from the kind
used at most public universities,
which is a defined-benefits plan.
Because this plan places a limit on
maximum benefits, there is no
added incentive for faculty mem
bers to stay on past the age of 65.
Therefore, public universities tend
to see lower retirement ages.
While faculty members think
frequent review of University plans
is always a good practice, some
don't see today's increased retire

ment ages as a problem.
The School of Engineering is see
ing normal retirement ages, Gaddy
said. The average age of the school's
200 faculty is 47, with ages ranging
from 27 to 68. "I don't see any evi
dence of a problem," she said.
With a 5 percent turnover rate
now, in 20 years, 64 percent of the
faculty will have been replaced. "It
seems to me that there's a pretty
significant turnover rate," said
Chemistry Prof. Michael Fayer, a
Faculty Senate member.
Others think research at Stan
ford may lx' turning stale because of
the increasing age of retirement.
"The vitality at Stanford really
depends on the turnover of both fac
ulty and students," said Geological
and Environmental Sciences Prof.
Gordon Brown, a member of the
Planning and Policy Board.
There can also lx> financial sav
ings to faculty turnover, as junior
faculty members are cheaper than
senior members.
According to 1994-95 statistics,
an assistant humanities professor
earned a median salary of $46,255
compared to a professor with 21-
plus years of service whose median
salary was $103,625. On average, a
junior faculty member is paid about
half as much as a senior member.
Furthermore, faculty renewal is
necessary so that Stanford can
expand into new areas both in
terms of research and scholarship,
said Biological Sciences Prof. Pat

Jones, a lx><ird member.
The report also calls fort he Uni
versity to review its current Faculty
Retirement Incentive Program,
which was implemented in May
1994.
This voluntary plan provides eli
gible faculty members with a single
payment at the time of retirement,
said Kathryn Gillam, senior ass(x:i
ate provost for faculty affairs.
Tenure-line professors and Med
ical Center Line faculty with at least
15 years of service and whose age is
between 60 and 09 are eligible for
the program.
The 36 faculty who had accepted
thi> offer as of Aug. 31, 1995,
received a single payment of twice
their final annual base salary,
Gillam said. A sliding rate applies to
faculty who retire now. The rate
depends on the employee's age.
Gillam said it is too soon to tell
whether the new program is sus
taining faculty interest. "We don't
have too much of a track record
yet," Gillam said.
When reviewing these two ret ire
ment programs, the University
must consider the policies at its peer
institutions like 1 larvard and Yale,
Gaddy said.
"Some changes could be good as
long as we stay similar to our com
petitors," Gaddy said. For example,
if Stanford decided to switch to a
defined-benefits program, it would
be harder to attract top scholars,
she said.
