# Later retirement ages prompt review request
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
Stanford faculty members today
are retiring at a later age than they
did 20 years ago â€” a change that
has caused some to wonder what
steps can be taken to encourage
more timely retirements.
A solution to the problem may be
found in University retirement pro
grams, according to a new report
presented to the Facuity Senate last
week.
The report recommends, among
other things, a review of Stanford's
contributory retirement plan and
its early retirement buyout pro
gram in hopes of assessing their
"cost and effectiveness" in yielding
appropriate ret irement rates.
While faculty agree that the re
tirement programs should be re
evaluated, there is some disagree
ment about whether changes are
needed.
The report, titled "Planning in
an Era of Change," is the result of a
three-and-a-half year study by the
Planning and Policy Board, a com
mittee created by the senate to un
dertake strategic planning.
According to the report, in 1994
the average age of faculty retire
ment at Stanford was 68.5. In com
parison, the average age prior to
1978 was 64.
In addition, the report found
that faculty are generally older
than they were about 20 years ago.

In humanities and social sciences,
for example, the average age of
Stanford faculty has increased from
43 in 1976 to 49 in 1994. The age of
faculty in science and engineering
increased from 44 to 47 in those
same years.
These numbers match the na
tional trend at other private re
search universities, the report said.
The report also found that the
structure of Stanford's contributo
ry retirement plan encourages fac
ulty members to retire later be
cause this often nets significant fi
nancial earnings.
The correlation between earn
ings and age prompted the board's
recommendation to review the Uni
versity's contributory retirement
plan, said Biological Sciences Prof.
Robert Simoni, a board member.
Under the contributory retire
ment plan, the University con
tributes 5 percent to an employee's
retirement fund each year and then
matches employee contributions to
the fund up to an additional 5 per
cent.
Each employee chooses how to
invest these retirement monies, pri
marily into stock market funds,
said James Franklin, associate vice
provost for total compensation of
personnel services.
According to the report, retiring
at iige 70 instead of fige6s can mean
major earnings. For example, the
