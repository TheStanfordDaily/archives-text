# Flawed hiring plans?
## Questions arise in wake of CSRE appointment 
### Sara Southern Contributing writer 
The continuing controversy over appointments to
the interdisciplinary program in ('omparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity has left students disillusioned
and faculty divided on the specifics of hiring for the
program.
Concerned students want to be more involved in
the hiring process for ( SUE, and the fact that there is
no concrete set of criteria fort hose scholars being con
sidered for CSRE has some students and faculty wor
ried that the current hiring procedure is fundamen
tally flawed.
Conflict originally arose with the proposed ap
pointment of (irace Kao, a doctoral candidate in soci
ology from the University of Chicago, as a potential
faculty member in the Stanford sociology department
who would work with CSRE as an Asian American
Studies scholar.
Althougi Dean of I lumanities and Sciences -John
Shoven, along with the sociology department, en
dorsed Kao's qualifications in Asian American Stud
ies, the Asian American Studies Curriculum Commit
tee and ('oncerned Students for Asian American Stud-


Shoven
ies disagreed.
"I thought Grace Kao was a
highly qualified candidate," Shoven
said. "In seeking someone out, I
was looking for an individual who
would contribute in some impor
tant way to CSRE besides teaching
in their department. I felt [Kao]
could have done that."
Although History Prof. Gordon
Chang, who serves on the Asian
American Studies curriculum com
mittee, declined to comment on
Kao's qualifications in the area,
graduate student Lok Siu, also on
the committee, said she didn't feel
Kao's work in the area was "up to
date."
"As a committee member, I, as
well as [Chang and Comparative
Literature Prof. David Paluinbo-
Liu] are familiar with the work
that's been published in Asian
American Studies as well as new
theories and empirical informa
tion," Siu said. "We are qualified to
evaluate people and simply found

Kao's work somewhat limited."
She added that the work com
mittees examined in evaluating
Kao's expertise in Asian American
Studies, an in-progress disserta
tion, "concerns Asian-American
ness as a variable and not a central
factor as it should."
Shoven admitted that there was
no concrete list of criteria for the
position in Asian American Studies,
something CSAAS and the Asian
American Studies Committee felt
was too subjective to act on.
"It would be ideal if those who
will be contributing to CSRE have
written a book," said Shoven. "In
this case, however, we relied on the
candidate's idea of how well she
could teach courses in Asian Amer
ican Studies. We act somewhat on
faith and bank on potential."
But Kao's qualifications were
only part of a greater problem
which Shoven referred to as "proce
dural imperfections."
One of the areas of confusion
concerned the actual origination of
the billet. Cecilia Ridgeway, chair of
the Sociology Department, said
there was an opening in the Sociol
ogy Department independent of

CSRE.
"The billet for Kao was 100 per
cent in the department," Ridgeway
said.
Shoven confirmed her state
ment, adding that "any billets asso
ciated with CSRE will be fully bil
leted within their respective depart
ments. There is no distinct set of
billets for CSRE alone."
He elaborated on the hiring pro
cedure, saying he met collectively
with the chairs of social science
departments to see if they could
find someone who supported their
disciplines as well as CSRE.
"Unfortunately, the candidates
come in a staggered way and we
have to make decisions sequential
ly," Shoven said. "I made a judg
ment call concerning Kao. Granted,
it was a controversial one, but I still
think it was the right decision."
Hut students like Siu, who is
part of CSAAS, says the "sequen
tial" nature of the hiring process is
not their concern. She added that
CSAAS has pushed Shoven, verbal
ly and in written memos, to set cri
teria for anyone who might con
tribute to CSRE in the form of a list
of qualifications.

"We wanted him to institution
alize a set of procedures," said Siu.
"He didn't respond, and I just don't
think [Shoven] has been very
respectful of the fact that Kao just
wasn't the person the Asian Ameri
can Studies curriculum committee
wanted."
She added that Shoven never
announced that Kao was being con
sidered as an Asian American Stud
ies scholar until very late in the pro
cess. Siu said she didn't know Kao
was being considered until the
weekend before Kao came to cam
pus for a departmental interview.
"Shoven gave us a verbal agree
ment that he would set up a meet
ing so that CSAAS could talk to
Kao. But all we got to do was go to
her job talk in the Sociology
Department, and even then, our
questions to her were deemed
'inappropriate.' "
Siu said that Kao did take 10
minutes afler her talk to separately
address her questions as well as
those of other concerned students.
"If I could do it over, I would
have worked the timing out bet
ter," Shoven said. "We weren't able
to invite concerned students and

faculty as early as we would've
liked."
Kao ultimately declined Stan
ford's offer and accepted a position
at the University of Pennsylvania,
where she will direct a minors pro
gram in Asian American Studies.
"The controversy over Asian
American Studies wasn't a factor in
my decision to decline Stanford's
offer," Kao said in an interview
from Chicago yesterday.
Another candidate in the Sociol
ogy Department who has been
deemed qualified to teach courses
that would be part of CSRE is still
being considered. Both that candi
date and Kao would have been
hired if they had accepted offers.
The name of the second candi
date has not been released.
The original single billet in the
Sociology Department grew to two
when the candidates turned out to
be so "stellar," Ridgeway said.
When they came to review appli
cants, the search committee peti
tioned Shoven for special permis
sion to hire two faculty members
instead of one "only in this particu
lar case."
Ridgeway added that now that

Kao has declined, the billet has
been reduced back to one. "We are
still actively recruiting | the remain
ing candidate], who would be
invaluable to Stanford."
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo, who
served on the CSRE committee,
said the controversy "amounted to
a difference between what (Shoven
and the Sociology Department]
were looking for, and what was con
sidered to be good criteria by the
Asian American Studies curricu
lum committee and concerned stu
dents."
Shoven says he is "cautiously
optimistic" about the hiring. "I
want to get thus one behind us. We
need to move on and see if we can
coordinate timing better as well as
input from the interested parties."
Siu said she and CSAAS are not
stopping. "Shoven has done good
work in the past, admittedly," she
said. "But the administration
doesn't give us anything unless we
ask for it, so we'll have to take some
proactive measures. I don't think
jthe hiring process] will be any
smoother in the future unless
Shoven comes up with a written
hiring procedure."
