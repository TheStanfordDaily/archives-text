GLOGOVA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)
New evidence that Serb militias massacred up
to 7,000 Bosnian Muslims will he handed over
to the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, a top
U.S. official said yesterday.
John Shattuck, the assistant secretary of
state for human rights, was in eastern Bosnia
collecting evidence of alleged war crimes and
checking conditions that investigators will
face in the coming weeks.
"We believe there are up to 7,000 missing,
and I'm afraid their fate could very well be
vorv clear from the mass graves and mass exe
cutions we've heard about in the area," he told
reporters.
Shattuck said survivors have named the
abandoned, bombed-out village of Glogova,
nestled among snowy hills, as the grave of
those killed in one of the worst of the alleged
war crimes.
"Up to 2,000 people were herded into a
warehouse and then fired upon by grenades
and other weapons, and anyone who was left
was shot when they left" the town of Kravice,
just up the road, Shattuck said.
Kravice was part of the eastern Muslim
enclave of Srebrenica that was overrun by the
Bosnian Serb forces on July 11, 1995. Shat
tuck did not exnlain how or whv the bodies

were moved from Kravice to Glogova.
Shattuck said he could see blood spatters
and massive holes in the warehouse from the
heavy weapons and grenades.
"Two thousand missing people very nearby
could mean that up to 2,000 people could he
buried in this mass grave," Shattuck said,
standing in a desolate, snow-covered field in
front of a gutted house.
He predicted diggers would begin work at
Glogova with the spring thaw.
The war crimes tribunal in The Hague and
other human rights investigators have been
worried that evidence of graves and possible
war crimes could be tampered with the longer
the sites are left outside international control.
NATO officials promised yesterday to do
their best to protect investigators at alleged
mass graves around Bosnia and watch for any
attempts to tamper with the sites.
Until now, Bosnian Serbs had blocked out
siders from sites where they are accused of
burying thousands of bodies.
But Shattuck commended his Bosnian Serb
hosts for being cooperative, and said he faced
no restrictions on his tour.
A Bosnian Serb leader, Rajko Kasagic, said
investigators would face no obstacles. But he
told Serbian radio that reports of massacres

were "disinformation . . . without any proof."
Shattuck also toured Nova Kasaha, another
reputed mass grave, and Konjevic Polje, whore
witnesses say 200 people were shot as they
tried to flee along the road.
In the town of Karakaj, Shattuck said his
team looked at a school house and gymnasium
where Muslims were reportedly held before
being taken out in groups of 30 and shot
before open pits.
"This is the evidence many eyewitnesses
have provided," he said.
Other reputed sites are at nearby Bratunac
and an abandoned mine near Prijedor in the
northwest.
The war crimes tribunal, a U.N.-appointed
court based in The Hague, the Netherlands,
was losing hope that NATO forces would help
secure mass grave sites and arrest indicted
war criminals.
"We will provide whatever support we can,"
said a written statement by U.S. Adm.
Leighton Smith, commander of the NATO
troops enforcing the Bosnian peace plan.
Smith did not say how much military mus
cle would he needed, but noted NATO soldiers
would "provide an environment in which
(investigators) can accomplish their mis
sions."
