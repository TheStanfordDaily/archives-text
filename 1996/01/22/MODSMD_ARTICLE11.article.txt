# GOP leader won't raise debt ceiling
## Armey contradicts others' statements 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Con
tradicting other Republican lead
ers, House Majority Leader Dick
Armey said Congress will refuse
to raise the federal debt ceiling
next month unless President
Clinton agrees to GOP budget
cutting measures.
Armey's statements on NBC's
"Meet the Press" put Republicans
on a collision course with the
White House that could bring the
fiscal integrity of the country into
question.
House Republicans in particu
lar have been reluctant to pass
stopgap funding measures for the
1996 budget and raise the debt
ceiling until the White House
moves closer to the Republicans'
seven-year balanced budget plan.
Talks on the balanced budget
broke down last week, and it's
unlikely there will bo any progress
in settling the differences before
President Clinton delivers his
State of the Union address tomor
row night. Congress returns from
a two-week recess today.
"Let's not play games with the
future of this count ry or the econ
omy of this country," White
House Chief of Staff Leon Panet
ta said later on "Meet the Press,"
warning that Clinton would not
accept a debt limit extension with
strings attached.
Last week on the same news
program, House Budget Commit
tee Chairman John Kasich, It-
Ohio, gave assurances that
Republicans would extend the
government's borrowing authori
ty before Feb. 15, when interest
due to bondholders would push
the debt beyond the current $4.9
trillion limit.
"John Kasich's willingness to
vote for it to the contrary," said
Armey, R-Texas, "it's not coming
through the House unless it car
ries with it something that is a
substantial share of our agenda of
decreasing the size and the intru
siveness of government. . ..
"We have a House that is com
mitted to getting this job done,
and we're going to use every
instrument we can to move the
ball forward," he said.
Armey said he would support
linking the debt limit increase to
language terminating the Com
merce Department, a top priority
of the Republican Congress, and
preventing the Treasury secre
tary from "ever again raiding the
trust funds of federal workers'
retirement programs."

After Clinton last November
vetoed a debt ceiling measure
with similar restrictions, Trea
sury Secretary Robert Rubin
twice tapped government trust
funds to avoid exceeding tbe bor
rowing limit.
Rubin said last week that he
would be forced to take further
actions so the government can
avoid default after Feb. 15 and
suggested that this time finding
appropriate accounting maneu
vers might be more difficult. He
said a legal review was continuing
because proposals being consid
ered did not as yet "fully pass
muster."
Armey said Congress would
probably agree to another tempo
rary spending bill when the cur
rent measure expires on Jan. 26,
avoiding a third government shut
down. He said those government
programs that haven't had their
budgets approved would be funded
at about 75 percent of 1995 levels.
Panetta said the president
would sign such a bill.
But he predicted that a GOP
attempt to use the debt ceiling to
force Clinton's hand on the bal
anced budget would fail. "Raising
these kinds of blackmail
approaches to try to get their
agenda adopted just has not
worked. It's been a disaster."
Panetta also took a swipe at
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-
Ga., for saying last week that
Clinton's opposition to the
Republican tax cut plan was
pushing the country into a reces
sion. "Maybe that's possibly what
he wishes for in order to hurt the
country for the future," Panetta
said.
The Senate has been less eager
than the House to confront Clin
ton on 1996 spending and the
debt ceiling, but Senate Majority
Whip Trent Lott, R-Miss., asked
about Armey's comments, agreed
that the debt ceiling bill will not
be "clean."
"There are two branches of
government here and we have to
have our role in developing that
action" to extend the debt limit,
he said.
House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., appearing with
Lott on ABC's "This Week With
David Brinkley," responded that
"I thought what Dick Armey said
this morning was the height of
irresponsibility. We're fooling
here with the credit worthiness of
the United States."
