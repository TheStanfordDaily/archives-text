GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP)
â€” Winning 88 percent of the vote,
Yasser Arafat emerged yesterday
from the first Palestinian election
with a resounding mandate to
complete peace with Israel and
lead his people to independence.
Final results of the race for
presidency released by the Cen
tral Election Commission late yes
terday gave Arafat 88.1 percent of
the total vote and his opponent
Samiha Khalil 9.3 percent. Offi
cials said that 2.6 percent of the
ballot slips were invalid.
"I am very proud of this very
important historic democratic
election in which a very high
majority of our people have par
ticipated," Arafat told reporters
after the results were
announced. "We hope that (it)
will be one of the most impor
tant efforts on the way to an

independent Palestinian state."
Arafat loyalists will also con
trol the newly elected 88-inember
Palestinian parliament, though
they may have to share some
power wit h uprising activists, out
spoken women and other inde
pendents who until now were
shut out of decision-making.
At least 50 of the legislators
were members of Arafat's Fatah
faction, including 10 who had
served in his appointed interim
Cabinet, according to unofficial
results released yesterday night.
Official results are expected
today.
Despite the historic event, the
mood >n the West Bank and Gaza
Strip was subdued yesterday as
Palestinians began to observe the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan
with dawn-to-dusk fasting.
Winners postponed celebra

tions until after the "iftar," the
festive meal that breaks the fast
after sundown.
Arafat will convene the legisla
ture for the first time after
Ramadan ends, said spokesman
Nabil Abu Irdeineh. That date
was not yet set.
Arafat joked yesterday about
his landslide victory, suggesting a
lower rate of approval would
probably have looked more demo
cratic. "I was looking for 51 per
cent," Arafat said after meeting
with former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter, who led a 40-mem
ber election observer team.
The voting was marred by
reports of fraud, violations that
ranged from stuffing ballot boxes
to voting more than once to illit
erate voters having their ballots
filled out for them by Arafat loyal
ists.

In the West Bank village of
Salem, an election official was
shot and killed Saturday night by
a Palestinian security agent who
became enraged when told to
leave a polling station. The gun
man was arrested by Palestinian
police.
In Hebron, also on the West
Bank, one candidate said he was
told that some 30 ballot boxes had
disappeared and that were dis
crepancies in counting.
Carter said yesterday there
were some problems in the voting,
but not on a scale that would have
altered the outcome.
"I look upon yesterday as one
of the historic turning points in
the history of Palestine and the
Middle East," said Carter, who
brokered the first Arab-Israeli
peace treaty, the 1979 accord with
Egypt.

Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres congratulated Arafat, say
ing the election "was an approval
for the agreement between the
Palestinians and ourselves by a
very impressive majority of the
Palestinian people."
But during a phone call with
Arafat, Peres also reminded him
of his promise to revoke sections
of the PLO Charter that call for
the destruction of Israel.
Peres announced he would per
mit the return from exile of all 483
members of t he Palestine National
Council, the Palestinians' parlia
ment-in-exile which has to revoke
the charter.
The members of the newly elect
ed Palestinian legislature automat
ically become members of the
Palestine National Council. In all. a
two-thirds majority is required to
revoke the charter.
