2nd network refuses GOP request
WASHINGTON (AP) — CBS became the second
network to turn down an unusual request from
Republican leaders, who want their response to
President Clinton's State of the Union speech to air
a day later in prime 1 ime.
The network considers it in the public's interest
to air both the president's speech and the GOP
response tomorrow night, Andrew Hey ward, presi
dent. (if CBS News, said yesterday.
"We feel strongly that these two events have
been linked through long tradition for a very good
reason," Heyward wrote in a letter to Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt
Gingrich.
"Presenting the two speeches back-to-back will
ensure the widest possible audience for both points
of view," Heyward wrote.
ABC turned down the Republicans' request last
week; NBC has yet to respond.
On Saturday, Dole said he hoped for the 24-
hour-delay after Clinton's speech "to sort of let him
have his day and let us have our day."

The Concorde turns 20
PARIS (AP) — The needle-nosed Concorde, a tech
nological breakthrough when it first took to the skies,
marked its 20th birthday yesterday as it roared from
Paris to New York on a ceremonial anniversary flight.
Operated by Air France and British Airways, the
Concorde travels ;it more than 1,350 miles per hour —
a speed known as Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound.
It can carry up to 128 passengers across the Atlantic in
just three hours. 53,943 passengers (lew the superson
ic luxury jet's Paris-to-New York leg in 1995.
"I spent the most beautiful years of my life
thanks to this plane," recalled Edouard Chemel, a
seven-year Concorde pilot for Air France. "Its
beauty is immortal. At all the airports on the plan
et, the Concorde has always been an attraction."
Only 16 of the jets were ever made, the last in
1980. Two planes already have been retired, but
the rest of the fleet is designed to fly until 2015.
They have flown nearly 69 million miles.
Highlights in the Concorde's 20-year reign:
• Last August, it shattered the record for around
the-world travel with a six-stage flight of 31 hours

and 27 minutes.
• It raised eyebrows on New Year's Eve 1994 when
it carried revelers who paid $23,000 apiece for a 32-
hour trip to nowhere. Travelers got to ring in the
New Year twice because the jet twice crossed the
International Date Line.
• It made headlines earlier that year when an impa
tient Saudi prince, unwilling to wait two hours for the
next conventional jet, paid $236,000 to charter one to
ferry his party of 20 from Paris to the United States.

Mel Gibson won best director honors for his epic
