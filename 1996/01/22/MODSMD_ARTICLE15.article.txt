## Housing sororities 
### 
ONCE AGAIN, THE Office
of Student Affairs is
reopening the issue of
sorority housing. This review com
mittee that will decide the matter
is part of a larger task force that
will take a comprehensive look at
the Greek system here on campus.
The committee should endorse
campus housing for sororities. The
last time that a sorority was housed
on campus was 1944. In contrast,
fraternities have managed to main
tain houses and a visible presence
on campus for quite some time.
Sororities will gain a stronger
presence on campus and in the
Greek system by getting houses
they can specifically call their own.
Currently, sororities are limited in
their ability to make an impression
on campus women in general.
Many women get their first
impressions of sororities during
the rush season. Unlike fraterni

ties, sororities are limited in terms
of where they can host parties and
other private events.
I lousing sororities would provide
year-round opportunities for Stan
ford women to associate with soror
ities and to become aware that
there are numerous housing and
social options available to them.
However, fraternities may end
up having to make sacrifices. One
of the major barriers that keeps
sororities form getting housing is
the 1977 "grandfather clause" that
gives priority for housing to 12
specified fraternities. Unhoused
fraternities may have to surrender
their priorities to increase the over
all popularity of the Greek system.
If the Office of Student Affairs
genuinely wants to improve the
stature of the Greek system, it
must resurrect the other half of
Greek life by granting housing
privileges to sororities.
