The overseas studies
Program is making a deter
mined effort to improve the
educational opportunities of Stan
ford students who want to travel
abroad. Proposed changes will not
only make studying overseas an
increasingly attractive opportuni
ty, but they will also affirm Stan
ford's interest in the international
community.
Overseas Studies is considering
developing new centers and study
abroad opportunities in China and
Mexico, two countries that have a
vital impact upon the world politi
cally and economically In addition,
the Moscow program plans to
streamline the Russian language
requirement for the Moscow cam
pus.
Both programs under considera
tion would provide excellent learn
ing environments for students to
discover a non-Western culture,
improve their knowledge of a lan
guage and witness historical and
radical events. For instance, the

proposed China program will allow
students to see one of the most
rapidly developing nations on the
planet, while the proposed Mexico
program will give students the
chance to study our next-door
neighbor's unique cultures.
The Moscow program will hope
fully become more popular as the
language requirement is stream
lined. Rather than taking Russian
here at the main campus, where
students receive only limited expo
sure, undergraduates will be able
to get a month of intensive Rus
sian in Moscow before the program
begins, free of charge. As well, this
accelerated program will make the
Moscow adventure less intimidat
ing by eliminating the three quar
ters of Russian originally required
to gain entry into the program.
Overseas Studies administra
tors are on the right track in mak
ing these changes to the Moscow
program and in considering the
expansion of educational opportu
nities abroad.
