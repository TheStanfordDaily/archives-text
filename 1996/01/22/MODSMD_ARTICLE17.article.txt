Professor writes to clarify issues in CSRE story

lAM WRITING to correct the errors
printed in the Jan. 17 article of The
Stanford Daily regarding the Com
parative Studies in Race and Ethnicity
appointment.
First, Grace Kao is not a professor of
sociology at the University of Chicago.
She is a doctoral candidate in that
department, writing a dissertation on
the images different racial groups have
of one another in secondary school and
how those images might affect their aca
demic performance. The Asian American
Studies Curriculum Committee felt her
analysis of Asian-American subjects to
be still relatively unsophisticated and
lacking a convincing grasp of the field.

Second, there is some confusion about
the origin and nature of the billet to which
Kao would have been appointed. The
Daily's article states that "The Sociology
Department had an opening." If that were
indeed the case, and if it had Ixxmi the bil
let offered Kao, we would have had no
objection whatsoever to the appointment.
However, as it turned out, the billet
offered her was not that "opening," but
rather the billet specifically created by
Dean of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven as an instrument to help estab
lish Asian American Studies — the only
billet so created. This made it inescapably
logical that such an appointment be vet
ted by scholars qualified to judge the

work of the candidate in Asian American
Studies. As was pointed out, this never
occurred until we insisted upon it. This is
tantamount to having a billet in sociology
filled by someone whose work in sociology
was never evaluated by any sociologist. 1
seriously doubt that would have met with
deaconal approval.
Finally, The Daily article seems to
indicate that the outside evaluat ion was
arrived upon solely by our committee. In
fact, the rather belated decision to solicit
the evaluation from that particular exter
nal scholar was arrived at consensually
by the deans, the Asian American Studies
Curriculum Committee and the Depart
ment of Sociology. Hence our surprise

and concern that the assessment, by a
scholar nationally recognized both as a
sociologist and as an Asian Americanist,
was completely ignored in the decision to
go ahead with the appointment without
any further consultation with CSRE.
The crux of the matter is that if we
are to have a program in Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity, Stan
ford's own faculty in that field should
obviously have a strong voice in the hir
ing process. Otherwise, it can only be
taken as a sign of lack of respect for both
those scholars and the field in general.
