# Student says Burmese trip by alumni supports regime
## 
### 
Recently, a group of Stanford alumni
and professors were denied landing per
mits by the Burmese military for a visit
to Rangoon. Our alumni association's
crime? They had expressed interest in
meeting with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi,
the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner,
leader of the democratically elected gov
ernment of Burma and prisoner held
under house arrest for seven years until
her release this July.
Upon hearing that the permits were
being revoked, the director of Travel and
Studies for the Stanford Alumni Associ
ation, instead of expressing outrage at
the military dictatorship, wrote a concil
iatory, almost sycophantic, letter to the
brutal regime. "I have already written to
Daw Aung San Suu Kyi withdrawing my

invitation," the director wrote. "I wish
to emphasize in no uncertain terms that
neither I nor any of the passengers or
staff will contact this person."
Stanford should have learned several
lessons from the revocation of the per
mits. The first is that the SLORC, the
military junta that came to power in
1988 after slaughtering thousands of
students and monks asking for democra
cy, has not made sufficient progress
toward granting freedom and liberty to
deserve our tacit approval, much less
our support and investment. Every time
that an alumni tour stops in Burma, it is
forced to give money directly and indi
rectly to the SLORC by, for example,
staying in facilities built by slave labor
ers subjugated by the SLORC.
Furthermore, by visiting Burma, the
alumni tours give credibility to the
SLORC and diminish the chances that
Aung San Suu Kyi and the people of

Burma have of gaining a space at the
bargaining table where they can ask for
freedom and democracy. Our alumni
association ignored all of this, however,
and instead focused on placating one of
the most brutal regimes in the world.
Instead of continuing its trend of
doing nothing and trying to please
everyone who has power, Stanford's
alumni association should use this
opportunity to denounce the SLORC,
urge other universities to cancel their
trips to Burma and halt all future alum
ni trips to Burma. This is what
Desmond Tutu has asked for, it is what
the UCLA alumni association has done,
and it is what a large international
activist community is calling for.
However, we all should also use this
opportunity to think about our own con
tributions to the gross injustices in
Burma. We don't just support the
SLORC when our alumni association

tours Burma, we support the SLORC
with Stanford's millions of dollars invest
ed in corporations that directly support
the SLORC â€” by the Pepsi machines
that pock-mark this campus and by our
continued quest for a Taco Bell (Pepsi
owns Taco Bell and runs a bottling plant
in Burma that hires SLORC workers,
pays money directly to the SLORC and
indirect ly uses slave labor).
While we first must listen to Aung
San Suu Kyi's warning that "it is too
early for tourists or investments to comi
pouring into Burma," we must also use
this opportunity to re-examine our
entire relationship with Burma and how
our unbridled investments and absolute
ly conscious-free expenditure of money
lead to injustice all over the world, from
Southeast Asia to East Palo Alto.
