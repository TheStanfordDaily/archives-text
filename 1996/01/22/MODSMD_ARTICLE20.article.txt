## Blaming the twin 
### 
SINCE TRUTH IS stranger than fic
tion, this week, I will entertain you
with a true story from my life about
nearly being mistakenly arrested for the
crime of stealing women's underwear.
Last week, there was a burglary in my
dorm. Instead of bikes or computers, this
innovative thief swiped a bag of dirty
laundry from the room of a good female
friend of mine.
Later that night, I decided to swing by
the bathroom before my daily visit to the
local orphanage. As I passed the crime
scene, one of the two witnesses was
describing the filthy animal capable of
such a heinous crime. "Hair?" the cop
asked. "Well, short, brown . . . well, just
like BRENDAN'S," she said pointing to
me. I stopped and stared at the officer
like a deer caught in the headlights of an
on-coming car. Erom that point on, the
cop never took his eyes off me.
The witness then continued to
describe the suspect using me as her
model. Apparently, I look identical to the
guy she saw. (Damn that evil twin broth
er of mine!) Then the other witness, who
had been kept separate to insure the gen
uineness of her story, confirmed that my
life was way too much like a terrible soap
opera and that I was indeed the walking
double of the villain.
By now, a large crowd had gathered
like hungry vultures, eager to watch a

helpless lamb breathe its last breath.
They were preparing to say good-bye to
their favorite neighbor and to remind me
not to pick up the soap in"the joint." My
roommate was crying. I reminded a few
of my friends to bring me cigarettes —
they use them like money in"the pen,"
you know.
The cop asked one last question:
"Could this have been some sort of sick
prank?" Immediately, the crowd, in uni
son, said, "If it was, it would have been
done by one of those two," and all point
ed at my roommate Erin and me.
"Mommy," I whispered, shaking uncon
trollably.
Fortunately, my cool countenance and
the lack of physical evidence kept me
from having stories to tell next week
about how I learned to strip a Camaro
and about a huge guy named Bubba, who
will make a deal to protect you, but it will
cost you.
The kind officer soon left without me
and I finally got to go to the bathroom
and think about the mistakes I made in
dealing with this situation. I now realize
that all my jokes, like "You won't take me
alive, copper!" and "But I only wear the
lacy, French ones and she doesn't have
any of those" probably didn't help the sit
uation.
During the next hour, I was taken
aside by several different people who qui

etly asked me, with very serious looks oil
their faces, "Tell me the truth — did you
do it?" A couple even did the same to my
roommate. I tried to convince them that
stealing a bag of dirty laundry just isn't
funny. Stealing all the clean underwear
from her drawer and replacing them with
a couple boxes of fruit roll-ups might
have been funny, but stealing a bag of
dirty laundry has absolutely no pizzazz.
Besides, if the underwear in question
didn't fit me last quarter, I have enough
sense to realize it isn't going to fit now.
Unfortunately, the vigilantes weren't
ready to listen.
My hope is that someone will read this
column, spot a guy who looks just like me
(see photo above) wearing women's
underwear that is way too small for him,
call the police and have the bastard
arrested. Then, maybe, my friends will
believe that I did not steal the bag of
laundry and Victoria's Secret at the Stan
ford Shopping Center will let me shop
there again.
By the way, I am a boxers kind of L r uv.

Kids, be sure and tune in next week for
TliK LAST episode of "Days of Brendan's
Life. " Same bat tune, same bat channel.
