Stanford 84
Oregon State 51

Still stinging from its losses to
UCLA and USC, Stanford took the hap
less Oregon State Beavers behind the
proverbial woodshed Saturday night
and whacked out an 84-51 victory.
The Beavers (3-11 overall, 1-4 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) could do little to stop
the brawny Stanford players as the No.
24 Cardinal (10-4, 4-2) raced out to an
18-2 lead just seven minutes, 20 sec
onds into the game, bringing the 5,569
fans in Maples Pavilion to their feet.
"This was a good-old Carolina coun
try ass-whupping," said first-year Ore
gon State head coach Eddie Payne, a
North Carolina native.
Senior guard Dion Cross keyed the
early offensive explosion, hitting four
three-pointers (three in a 1:28 stretch).

The Beavers opened the game hitting
one of their first eight shots and turned
the ball over four times before calling a
20-second timeout to staunch the bleed
ing.
"We wanted to get out early and not
let them stall," said junior point guard
Brevin Knight. "That's one of the first
times we've come out that strong this
season."
With a 43-25 halftime advantage,
head coach Mike Montgomery once
again rested his starters for much of
the second half. After getting 28 points
from the bench in last Thursday's win
over Oregon, Stanford saw six of eight
reserves score a total of 26 points Sat
urday night.
"We've got some guys who are struc
turally beaten down," Montgomery
said. "This weekend was good for us.
We shot over 50 percent in both games
and we got a lot of playing time for
some people off the bench."
Montgomery managed to cut down
on the playing time of Cross and
Knight, who look as if they were held
together with bailing wire and spit on
occasion. Cross and Knight averaged

36 and 35 minutes, respectively,
against UCLA and USC, but Mont
gomery was able to shave almost 10
minutes off those totals against the
Oregon schools.
Despite decreased playing time,
Cross and Knight cut apart the Beaver
defense like skilled surgeons. After his
quick start, Cross finished with a game
high 18 points. Knight added 16 points,
five rebounds, five assists and five
steals.
If the jumpers of Knight and Cross
were the scalpels, then give David Har
bour a chainsaw and stand back. The
senior guard tore his way through the
sapling-like Beaver defense with all the
grace of a lumberjack, scoring 13 points
and grabbing five rebounds.
"I thought we just got manhandled
right from the beginning," Payne said.
"They intimidated our players, and we
didn't respond. Physically, we haven't
been pushed around like that before."
Limiting the Beavers to 39.5 percent
shooting and outrebounding them 39-
15, the Cardinal got out on the break

easily and never fell into the trap
of Oregon State's slow-down,
clock-controlling tempo.
"They played a lot of zone and it
is very difficult to rebound out of a
zone," Montgomery said. "They're
not very big, but then again, nei
ther are we. We actually outre
bounded them 24-7 in the second
half, which is fairly incredible."
Senior forward Andy Poppink
led Stanford with eight rebounds
while freshman Mark Seaton
added seven, including four offen
sive, in 17 minutes of action. For
the game, the Cardinal corralled
14 offensive rebounds compared
to three for the Beavers.
Junior Rich Jackson added
eight points in 10 minutes and
freshman Peter Sauer tallied
seven in 16 minutes. However,
the best play by a reserve would
not come until 2:15 remained in
the game when sophomore walk
on Mark Thompson buried a
three-pointer from 23 feet with a
defender in his face. Seaton,
thinking the quick-triggered shot
was a lob pass for an alley-oop
dunk, broke hard to the hoop but
could only watch in amazement
as the shot caught nothing but
net.
Freshman walk-on Karl Wente
also got into the scoring column,
nailing a 16-footer from the wing
with 10 seconds to play.
For Oregon State, its 33-point
deficit marked the Beavers' worst
loss of the year while the 84
points surrendered were the most
Oregon State has yielded all sea
son. Senior J.D. Vetter, harassed
all game by fans because of an air
ball early in the game, led Oregon
State with 11 points.
As for Stanford, the 51 OSU
points were the fewest the Cardi
nal defense have given up this
year. The win came as the largest
Pac-10 margin of victory for Stan
ford since the 1988-89 season,
when the Cardinal defeated Wash
ington State 85-43 in Pullman.
