# Quick start keys crucial win
## Hot shooting by Cross gives No. 24 Cardinal early advantage 
### Daniel Kao Editorial staff 
When it comes to finding a panacea
for a two-game conference losing
streak, nothing quite hits the spot like
an invigorating dose of Duck pate and
Beaver road kill.
Coming home after disappointing
losses to UCLA and USC two weeks
ago, the Stanford men's basketball
team sought a remedy to the losing bug
that had so quickly afflicted the team.
The skid ended as quickly as it had
begun with the Cardinal pasting Ore
gon last Thursday night 94-74 and
whipping Oregon State 84-51 Saturday
night.

"This weekend was good for us obvi
ously," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We needed this from a
lot of standpoints. It's got to help our
confidence, although playing on the
road in this league is a lot different than
playing at home."
It might be different, but Stanford
will no doubt enjoy the home cooking
while it lasts. Thursday's action fea
tured a hungry bench that chipped in
with '28 impressive points. The story on
Saturday, however, was a Cardinal
squad that from the first tip-off proved
ravenous from top to bottom.
Preventing any chance whatsoever
for an Oregon State upset, the Cardinal
came straight out of the locker., room

fast and furious. Senior forward Andy
Poppink's play early in the game estab
lished a physical, Beaver-beating tone
from which Oregon State would never
recover.
Poppink scored the game's first
points by converting on a foul he drew
underneath the basket. Then, after Ore
gon State's Iyan Walker hit a 10-foot
baseline jumper to tie the score at 2-2,
Poppink sparked a 16-2 run, bulling his
way inside for the offensive tip-in.
The Cardinal would have free reign
inside the paint throughout the game,
outmuscling the undermanned, under
skilled Bgavers. Stanfprd crushed
Oregon State in the battle of the
boards, outrebounding the hap
less Beavers 39-15. The Cardinal
grabbed almost as many offensive
boards, 14, as the toothless
Beavers had total.
"Overall as a team, Stanford's
one of the strongest teams we've
played," said Oregon State head
coach Eddie Payne. "They play
that way. They bang you."
Banging aside, Stanford exhib
ited a rare bloodlust early on,
forcing turnovers by pressuring
and throwing a rarely-seen trap
on defense against Oregon State.
If the defense set the table for the
victory versus the Beavers, Cardi
nal Dion Cross was the one who
stuck a fork in the oversized
rodents.
"Dion shot the ball well early,
which helped everybody because
that's a key part of what we do,"

Montgomery said.
The junior sharpshooter went
for the jugular early on, knocking
down a three-pointer after Pop
pink's tip-in. The carnage had
just begun.
After senior David Harbour
drained a 19-foot jump shot to
give Stanford a 9-2 advantage,
Cross dialed long distance three
more times in less than two min
utes to give Stanford an insur
mountable 18-2 lead.
"It was a nice start," Cross
said. "It was a big lift, and our
team just fed off that for the rest
of the game. It's good to have [a
start like that) this year.
"I was surprised (to find
myself that open|. I thought that
they were going to be in my face
the whole night. I think a couple
of times they lost me on the break
and that's how I got the open
looks that 1 wanted.'
For a Cardinal squad that has
had difficulty throwing the
proverbial knock-out punch
throughout the season, the victo

ries against the Oregon schools
were just what the doctor ordered.
The all-out offensive dismember
ment of the Beavers is particular
ly impressive. Stanford, entering
the OSU contest averagingjust 76
points a contest (eighth in the
Pacific 10 Conference), racked up
84 points against an Oregon State
squad that was third in the con
ference in points allowed at 67.5.
The Beavers had managed to
suppress the fireworks through
out the season mainly by playing
a stall, slow-down game to mini
mize the number of possessions
and stay close to opponents.
"We needed two wins," said
junior point guard Brevin Knight.
"We needed to get back to our
winning ways. We just wanted to
come out here, and we wanted to
come out strong from the begin
ning. We wanted to get the lead
early. We don't want them to play
that stall game."
Knight and the Cardinal got
the lead early and never looked
back.
