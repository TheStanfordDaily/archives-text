The fourth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team spent a
sun-swept weekend in Santa
Barbara taking part in the
32nd annual UC-Santa Bar
bara Collegiate Volleyball
Tournament. It might as well
have rained, however, as the
Cardinal spent most of the two
day period indoors playing an
overwhelming number of
matches, ultimately placing
fifth in the 24-school competi
tion that included eight top-10
teams.
To squeeze such an event
into a two-day span, tourna
ment rules required a team to
win only two out of three
games instead of the custom
ary three out of five. Teams
were divided into five pools and
the top two from each
advanced into a power pool,
where the places would then be
decided.
"It's such attrition out
there," said Cardinal assistant
coach John Kosty. "If you don't
have a deep bench, people get
hurt, they wear down, players

play out of position, and it can get
pretty sloppy."
Stanford also had to contend
with the injury of All-American
Matt Fuerbringer, a 6-foot-7 junior.
Recovering from fall-quarter shoul
der surgery, he expected to play only
two matches. To accommodate
Fuerbringer's condition and the
eight-match schedule, head coach
Ruben Nieves used all his players,
rotating several outside hitters and
middle blockers.
"A lot of people came through for
us," Kosty said. "IMiddle blocker]
Brian Moore had a terrific tourna
ment. He played well throughout.
(Freshman] Josh Palacios also had
a good tournament."
The Cardinal started its Friday
slate of five matches with a 10:15
a.m. match against Sacramento
State. After getting by t he Hornets
16-14,15-11, Stanford spikers faced

off with Laverne University, Lav
erne also succumbed to Stanford in
straight games 15-3,15-1. With the
two victories, the Cardinal earned a
berth in the power pool.
The first contest of the power
round matched Stanford against
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
rival Loyola Mary mount. Stanford
escaped the struggle with a 15-10,3-
15, 16-14 triumph.
The Cardinal then battled fellow
unbeaten UC-Santa Barbara,
ranked third in the nation. Despite
Fuerbringer's eight kills in 13
attempts, UCSB maintained its
winning streak, stopping Stanford
15-6, 6-15,15-8 and eliminating the
Cardinal from first-place con
tention. Stanford capped oil its day
with a 7 p.m. match versus sixth
ranked USC, which Stanford spiked
in straight games 15-3, 15-13.
After a Friday-night reprieve,
Stanford returned to the volleyball
court on Saturday morning to
square off against Arizona State.
Showing no sluggishness despite
the 9 a.m. start, the Cardinal

knocked off the Sun Devils 15-8, 15-
8.
Against ninth-ranked Cal State-
Northridge, however, Stanford
encountered difficulties it ultimate
ly could not overcome. Staying close
throughout, Stanford eventually
fell 13-15, 12-15. With two losses in
t he power round, the Cardinal could
only play for fifth place.
Stanford's final match pitted it
against Long Beach State, the No. 2
team in the country. Because of the
constant shulllmg of lineups to give
players much-needed rest, Nieves'
squad used its three-blocker forma
tion for only the second time in the
tournament. I»ng Beach was baf
fled and lost the first game 15-4.
The 49ers adjusted in the second
game but nonetheless came up
short, falling 15-10 as the Cardinal
secured fifth place.
"We're happy with fifth place,"
Kosty said. "It was a good time to
have the team show what they've
got, and no matter what the situa
tion, the team kept it under con
trol."
