# Bakersfield too tough for grapplers Aguirre wins lone match for Cardinal in 42-3 defeat
## 
### Karim Fahkry Contributing writer

Entering their dual meet on
Saturday, Stanford wrestlers
were fully aware that an ominous
challenge in the form of Cal State-
Bakersfield lay on their path to
victory. They knew that overcom
ing their obstacle entailed pulling
off several major upsets in Burn
ham Pavilion.
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, however, knowing was not
half the battle. The Roadrunners
affirmed their top-10 national
ranking by capturing all but one
match, winning by a final count of
42-3. The only victory that the

Cardinal managed to claim was
that of senior co-captain Jimmy
Aguirre (134 pounds), who defeat
ed Mike Mendoza 6-2.
The Cardinal began the con
test by forfeiting the 118-pound
match. From there, Stanford's
fortunes went downhill except for
Aguirre's match. Roadrunner
Coby Wright (126) beat senior
Matt Cano 15-4. Jason Ramstet
ter (142) followed suit by pinning
sophomore Robert Hatta six min
utes, 58 seconds into the match.
Next, freshman Doug Bardsley
(150) fell 6-4 to Tony DeSouza.
Continuing the onslaught,
Mickey Ritter (158) downed Car
dinal sophomore Jeff Grant, Jon
McCreary defeated sophomore
Scott Chapman (167) and Derek
Scott (177) pocketed another vic
tory for Cal State-Bakersfield
with his defeat of senior Mark

Ryzewicz. Finally, Stanford
junior Bryan Vaniman (190) lost
to Paschal Duru, and sophomore
heavyweight Chris Serjak suc
cumbed to Stephen Neal.
"We were the underdogs in all
but one weight division against
Cal State-Bakersfield," said Car
dinal head coach Chris Horpel. "I
was hoping we could pull off some
upsets and win some matches we
weren't supposed to win. Jimmy
Aguirre won as expected, but we
fell short in the upsets.
"Even still, we looked good in
our first five matches."
Indeed, Bardsley almost pulled
off a stunning upset before bow
ing out to his opponent, Pacific 10
Conference champion DeSouza.
Likewise, Grant led through most
of his match with Ritter, a Pac-10
silver medalist. Both Grant and
Bardsley serve as reserves for the
Cardinal.
In other weight divisions, how
ever, Stanford simply did not have
the firepower to defeat the Road
runners. "From 167 through
heavyweight, we were just plain
out-gunned," Horpel said. "We
gave it our best shot, but that
wasn't enough."
Although disappointed, the
Cardinal head coach remained
optimistic. "There's no shame in
[our performance]; it's just difTi

cult to watch our athletes get
man-handled," he said. "We're
young at those weights, and we'll
come back stronger next time."
The upcoming week could
bring some good news to Stan
ford's wrestling program with the
probable return of three starters
whose absence has handicapped
the team. Sophomore Jason Glad
den (177) should return after
recovering from nerve problems in
both elbows. Senior Sahlan Mar
tin (158) may also bounce back
from a neck sprain. Senior team
leader Tod Surmon (142), ranked
first in the Pac-10 and fifth
nationally, expects to get back into
action sometime this week once
his sprained knee heals.
