Not even a Pacific 10 Confer
ence-record 9,418 fans could faze
the Stanford women's basketball
team in its first big test of the con
ference season Saturday night.
Paced by Kate Starbird's 17
points, the fifth-ranked Cardinal
(13-2 overall, 6-0 Pac-10) cruised
to a 69-54 victory over No. 12
Oregon State (11-3, 3-2) in a
much-publicized showdown at the
Beavers' Gill Coliseum.
"It was a huge win for our
team on the road," said head
coach Amy Tucker. "It is such a
hostile environment."
With the win, Stanford
avenged perhaps its most bitter
defeat of the 1994-95 season. In
last year's meeting at Corvallis,
the Beavers handed the Cardinal
its only Pac-10 loss of the season
in a 78-73 upset.
"Last year's team, as good as it
was, could not win [at Gilll,"
Tucker said. "Oregon State had
their whole starting team back,
and we lost three starters.
"This was a big win to boost
our confidence. I think a couple of
upperclassmen were still smart
ing from last year's loss."
One of those upperclassmen is
Starbird. The junior forward, who
scored a school-record 44 points
in a win over USC Jan. 13, came
through with another solid per
formance on Saturday. Starbird
finished 6-of-9 from the field to
lead five Cardinal players in dou
ble figures. Overall, Stanford shot
49 percent from the floor.
However, defense proved the
key on a night that witnessed
OSU shoot a dismal 27.3 percent.
Beaver forward Tanja Kostic, who
entered the weekend as the Pac
10's leading scorer with a 26.2
points-per-game average, made
only six of 21 shots, though she
still led all scorers with 20 points.
OSU senior Anette Mollerstrom,
who averages 14.0 points per
game, was held to six.
"We came out very strong in
the first 10 minutes and were able
to keep Kostic off the boards,"
said junior point guard Jamila
