Increasing the accessibility of the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Communi
ty Center and finding funds for a full
time director should be priorities for
the University, Dean of Students Marc
Wais said Friday.
Responding to a report from the
Working Group on Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Student Needs, released last
March, Wais pointed to several areas
in which the University has already
made progress in improving the cam
pus atmosphere and accommodations
for the community.
Still, there is work to be done, Wais
said. While he has not seen any in
stances of homophobia in the 17 weeks
he has been at Stanford, the concerns
of the lesbian, gay and bisexual com
munity are real and must be heard, he
said.

The report, which was commis
sioned by former Dean of Students
Michael Jackson in October 1991, list
ed a number of recommendations for
improving Stanford for the lesbian,
gay and bisexual community.
Jackson's directive, in broad terms,
was to find ways to "enhance the qual
ity of life for lesbian, gay and bisexual
students at Stanford."
Tlu 1 challenge, according to the

working group's report, is to create an
environment in which the contribu
tions and talents of lesbian, gay and bi
sexual students are recognized and in
which students are free to study, work
and socialize without fear of harass
ment or discrimination.
The group's recommendations fell
into three categories: general climate,
academic climate and student ser
vices. The recommendations provide
the University with a means to ad
dress student needs in both tangible
and symbolic ways.
John Newsome, a member of the
working group and a staff member at
the Haas Center for Public Service,
said one of the major concerns of les
bian, gay and bisexual students was to
be able to participate in the Stanford
community the way that other stu
dents do. According to the working
group's report, lesbian, gay and bisex
ual students sometimes feel marginal
ized by the University.
"The pressures on LGB students
range from threats of physical vio
lence to intimidation in the class
room," Newsome said.
In order to improve this situation,
the report said the University should
provide academic role models for les
bian, gay and bisexual students. The
report also mentioned that an effort
should be made to integrate lesbian,
gay and bisexual scholarship into Uni
versity curricula and that an area

studies program should he developed.
"It is important to understand the
role that staff play in creating a toler
ant or an intolerant campus environ
ment," Newsome said. "Some staff re
ally misunderstand the concerns of
LGB students."
Newsome said students and profes
sors often do not want to address les
bian, gay and bisexual issues. It is his
objective as an educator to create a tol
erant environment that is supportive

of students, he said.
"The student population at Stan
ford appears to be incredibly toler
ant," Newsome said, citing a survey
conducted bv the workinggroup. "The
students aren't necessarily affirming,
but they are incredibly tolerant."
But the survey suggested that fac
ulty and staff are not so tolerant, he
said.
