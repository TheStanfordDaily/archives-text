# Report highlights gay students' needs
## Dean Wais says University has taken steps but can still improve environment 
### Amy Slucter Staff writer 
Increasing the accessibility of the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Communi
ty Center and finding funds for a full
time director should be priorities for
the University, Dean of Students Marc
Wais said Friday.
Responding to a report from the
Working Group on Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Student Needs, released last
March, Wais pointed to several areas
in which the University has already
made progress in improving the cam
pus atmosphere and accommodations
for the community.
Still, there is work to be done, Wais
said. While he has not seen any in
stances of homophobia in the 17 weeks
he has been at Stanford, the concerns
of the lesbian, gay and bisexual com
munity are real and must be heard, he
said.

The report, which was commis
sioned by former Dean of Students
Michael Jackson in October 1991, list
ed a number of recommendations for
improving Stanford for the lesbian,
gay and bisexual community.
Jackson's directive, in broad terms,
was to find ways to "enhance the qual
ity of life for lesbian, gay and bisexual
students at Stanford."
Tlu 1 challenge, according to the

working group's report, is to create an
environment in which the contribu
tions and talents of lesbian, gay and bi
sexual students are recognized and in
which students are free to study, work
and socialize without fear of harass
ment or discrimination.
The group's recommendations fell
into three categories: general climate,
academic climate and student ser
vices. The recommendations provide
the University with a means to ad
dress student needs in both tangible
and symbolic ways.
John Newsome, a member of the
working group and a staff member at
the Haas Center for Public Service,
said one of the major concerns of les
bian, gay and bisexual students was to
be able to participate in the Stanford
community the way that other stu
dents do. According to the working
group's report, lesbian, gay and bisex
ual students sometimes feel marginal
ized by the University.
"The pressures on LGB students
range from threats of physical vio
lence to intimidation in the class
room," Newsome said.
In order to improve this situation,
the report said the University should
provide academic role models for les
bian, gay and bisexual students. The
report also mentioned that an effort
should be made to integrate lesbian,
gay and bisexual scholarship into Uni
versity curricula and that an area

studies program should he developed.
"It is important to understand the
role that staff play in creating a toler
ant or an intolerant campus environ
ment," Newsome said. "Some staff re
ally misunderstand the concerns of
LGB students."
Newsome said students and profes
sors often do not want to address les
bian, gay and bisexual issues. It is his
objective as an educator to create a tol
erant environment that is supportive

of students, he said.
"The student population at Stan
ford appears to be incredibly toler
ant," Newsome said, citing a survey
conducted bv the workinggroup. "The
students aren't necessarily affirming,
but they are incredibly tolerant."
But the survey suggested that fac
ulty and staff are not so tolerant, he
said.

The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Community Center, housed in the Fire Truck
House, is currently without a full-time director.
"Some faculty responses were
hateful and terrifying," New
some said, citing a particular
response that began: "Dear fag
got lovers, I am not an insensitive
queer-basher."
On balance, Newsome believes
that the Stanford community is a
supportive place. Yet, he said, the
University has some work to do.
According to Dr. Carlos
Greaves, a psychiatrist at Coun
seling and Psychological Ser
vices, the University is sorely in
need of funding to support educa
tional activities.
"The greatest need is for
acceptance, inclusion and acknowl
edgment," Greaves said. "The
means to get there are education,
exposure and programming. All
of these things require money."
Greaves believes that some
areas of the University are more
open to lesbian, gay and bisexual
students than other areas. He
said, for instance, that the cli
mate in engineering departments
seems to be less open than in the
humanities and that the Medical
School tends to be more conser
vative than the School of Educa
tion. However, he emphasized
that inclusion is important.
"Gay people exist," he said
emphatically. "Their needs must
be attended to."
The working group report
mentioned that many lesbian,
gay and bisexual students feel
social pressures and discomfort
on a daily basis. The report stat
ed that lesbian, gay and bisexual
students are currently betrayed
by a failure of the I diversity to
fully embrace Stanford's State
ment of Nondiscrimination.
To reverse this trend, the
report recommends hiring a Uni
versity official to serve as a direc
tor for the LGBCC. Currently,
the LGBCC and the Women's
Center do not have directors,
while the other community cen
ters do. In addition, the report
recommends that each depart
ment identify ways to integrate
lesbian, gay and bisexual issues
into existing courses.
"There are so many things
simple things â€” that depart
ments can do to make a differ

ence for LGB students," said
Asst. Director of the Office of
Student Activities Troy Gilbert,
who serves as an adviser to the
LGBCC. Gilbert said it is impor
tant to note the extent to which
being lesbian, gay or bisexual can

Affect the way
people perceive
the University
and society.
According to
Gilbert, most
Stanford depart
ments are fairly
receptive to dis
cussions about
sexuality issues,
lie was particu-

larly enthusiastic about connec
tions being created between the
Haas Center for Public Service,
the Career Planning and Place
ment Center and the LGBCC.
Newsome, however, felt that
the working group's greatest
achievement was to raise aware
ness about sexuality issues.
Although he felt the working
group accomplished a great deal
through the assessment process,
he said he wants to see the pro
cess continued to ensure that
student needs are met on this
campus.
The response
Judging from his experience at
Harvard University, George
Washington University and the
University of Maryland, Wais
said, Stanford seems to be a fair
ly open and receptive campus.
But he believes that concerns
voiced by members of the lesbian,
gay and bisexual community are
important and he is prepared to
encourage the University to take
steps to create a supportive cam
pus environment for those stu
dents.
In his memorandum to the
working group, Wais emphasized
that its study has already had an
important effect on improving
the quality of life for Stanford
students.
The University has already
taken steps, for example, to cre
ate an intern posit ion at t he Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center; incorporate lesbian,
gay and bisexual concerns into
Residential Education and resi
dent assistant training; and
offer sensitivity and awareness
training for Cowell Student

Health Center staff members.
Mentors and advisers are also
now available through the
Undergraduate Advising Center
to provide lesbian, gay and
bisexual students with more
effective counseling.
According to Wais, the most
important improvement has been
the opening of dialogues between
the LGBCC and other con
stituencies at the University,
including the cultural centers,
Cowell, the Career Planning and
Placement Center and the Haas
Center for Public Service.
"The report makes it clear
that some LGB students do feel
marginalized," Wais said. "Clear
ly there are issues that still need
to be addressed."
Some of these issues include
examining the accessibility of the
LGBCC to disabled students and
conducting student satisfaction
surveys. According to Wais, the
facilities at the Fire Truck House
have already been enhanced with
new furniture. Despite this
progress, he admitted that the
question of resources for lesbian,
gay and bisexual students still
needs to be addressed.
At this time the University
does not have the financial
means to dedicate staff funds for
a full-time director at the
LGBCC, Wais said, though he
emphasized that he is uncertain
about what will occur in the
future.
"Clearly, we are not respond
ing to this issue in the way that
people had hoped we would,"
Wais said, acknowledging that he
is aware that many members of
the lesbian, gay and bisexual
community will be disappointed
by this decision.
Despite this decision, Wais
said the University is doing its
best to enhance the campus envi
ronment. for lesbian, gay and
bisexual students. His response
to the working group emphasizes
that the University values and
recognizes the contributions
that the lesbian, gay and bisexu
al community makes to Stan
ford.
"Stanford wants to create a
community that is open, recep
tive and welcoming to the LGB
community," Wais said. "1 hope
that LGB students understand
that they are an important part
