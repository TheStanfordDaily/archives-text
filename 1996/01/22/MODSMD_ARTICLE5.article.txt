# Immigration bill could be trouble for Bechtel
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
An immigration bill mak
ing its way through Con
gress threatens to tighten
restrictions on foreign stu
dents and could place
greater administrative bur
dens on the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
The Immigration Reform
Act of 1995, authored by
Sens. Alan Simnson. R-

Wyo., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., increas
es regulations on foreign students, require
ments for obtaining visas and employment,
and communication between universities and
the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Simpson said the bill will "ensure that our
generous and historical immigration tradi
tion will endure."
Among other provisions, the bill would re
quire a screening process for immigrants to
obtain permanent residence status and block
extension of foreign students' visas if their
studies take longer than expected. The bill
was approved bv the Senate Immigration
Subcommittee in November and currently is

proceeding to the Senate Judiciary Commit
tee. The House is debating a similar bill.
Officials from the Center, along with the
American Association of Universities and Stan
ford's government relations office, are attempt
ing to persuade legislators not to pass the bill.
"There's a certain sentiment in Congress
that something is wrong with immigration,"
said Bechtel Center Director John Pearson,
"that foreign students are here at the expense
of American students, and that foreign work
ers are taking the plnce of U.S. workers. Civen
that, thus is a way to rectify it."
The center, which handles paperwork for
both foreign students and professors, may not
have the resources to handle the increased bu
reaucratic work which the bill, combined with
recently proposed INS rides, would mandate,
Pearson said.
In addition to addressing these concerns,
Pearson's main objective is to educate foreign
students on the bill's ramifications, which
would:
â€¢ Require three years of employment and a
labor market screening process before most
foreign professors and students could receive
permanent resident status.
