# Immigration bill could be trouble for Bechtel
## 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
An immigration bill mak
ing its way through Con
gress threatens to tighten
restrictions on foreign stu
dents and could place
greater administrative bur
dens on the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
The Immigration Reform
Act of 1995, authored by
Sens. Alan Simnson. R-

Wyo., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., increas
es regulations on foreign students, require
ments for obtaining visas and employment,
and communication between universities and
the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Simpson said the bill will "ensure that our
generous and historical immigration tradi
tion will endure."
Among other provisions, the bill would re
quire a screening process for immigrants to
obtain permanent residence status and block
extension of foreign students' visas if their
studies take longer than expected. The bill
was approved bv the Senate Immigration
Subcommittee in November and currently is

proceeding to the Senate Judiciary Commit
tee. The House is debating a similar bill.
Officials from the Center, along with the
American Association of Universities and Stan
ford's government relations office, are attempt
ing to persuade legislators not to pass the bill.
"There's a certain sentiment in Congress
that something is wrong with immigration,"
said Bechtel Center Director John Pearson,
"that foreign students are here at the expense
of American students, and that foreign work
ers are taking the plnce of U.S. workers. Civen
that, thus is a way to rectify it."
The center, which handles paperwork for
both foreign students and professors, may not
have the resources to handle the increased bu
reaucratic work which the bill, combined with
recently proposed INS rides, would mandate,
Pearson said.
In addition to addressing these concerns,
Pearson's main objective is to educate foreign
students on the bill's ramifications, which
would:
• Require three years of employment and a
labor market screening process before most
foreign professors and students could receive
permanent resident status.


Pearson
• Prevent foreign students from
renewing their visa if their studies
take longer than they expected.
Foreign undergraduates who opt
for graduate school but fail to dis
close this before matriculation will
require the U.S. Attorney Gener

al's approval to continue.
• Require any children of foreign
students to attend private elemen
tary and high schools.
• Force universities to provide
the INS with "certain information"
about foreign students from five
unspecified countries.
• Mandate employers of foreign
ers to pay 10 percent of the work
er's salary (or $10,000, whichever
is higher) to a private fund "dedi

cated to reducing the dependence
on foreign workers."
Pearson said the bill is less
harsh now than it was in its origi
nal form. It does not, for example,
mandate that foreign graduates
work for two years outside the
United States before being eligible
for U.S. employment. The clause
was rescinded from a draft of the
bill before subcommittee approval.
Regardless, many Stanford stu

dents ;ire concerned with the bill's
consequences and the ideology
behind it.
"What the bill really represent
ed is a shift and a statement by the
federal government that basically
even legal immigration isn't a pri
ority," said ASSU graduate senator
Sandeep Singhal, who authored an
ASSU Senate bill last month criti
cizing the proposed immigration
reforms. "For students who are

here, it represented to them the
possibility that they will have a
harder time getting jobs."
Pearson emphasized that the
Bechtel Center can offer current
students counsel about the bill, but
that once foreign students gradu
ate, prospective employers may
handle things differently.
"If they're not going to stay and
work at Stanford, the paperwork is
out of our hands," ho said.
