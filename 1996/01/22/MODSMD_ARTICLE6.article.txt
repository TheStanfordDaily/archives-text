# Golden anniversary for Stegner Fellowship
## 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Contributing writer 
Wallace Stegner established Stanford's
Writing Program in 1946, believing, as he
later wrote, that "minds grow by contact with
other minds, the bigger the better, as clouds
grow toward thunder by rubbing together."
Fifty years after its founding, under the lead
ership of English Prof. Elizabeth Tallent, the
program does indeed appear thunderous.
According to John L'Heureux, former di
rector of the program and an English profes
sor, "The students at the moment are cer
tainly among the most talented and dedicated
writers I have ever taught in 2.3 years here."
In light of the success of other writers who
have spent time at Stanford — fiction writers
like Raymond Carver, Ken Kesey, Scott
Turow, Larry McMurtry, Til lie Olsen and To
bias Wolff, and poets like Donald Hall, Don
ald Justice and Robert Pinsky — such a com
ment is high praise.
The crux of the program, L'Heureux ex
plained, is the Stegner Fellowships, which
have existed since the program's inception.
The two-year fellowships offer stipends as
well as deferral of tuition to a small group of
promising writers and poets. The fellowships

also provide the structure and sup
port of writing workshops which
meet twice a week.
Each year, one or two Stegner
Fellows from both the poetry class
and the writing class are selected
to be Jones Lecturers, a position
which entails staying on at Stan
ford for three years to teach
undergraduate classes. Several
other fellowships and shorter term
teaching positions also exist.
In recent years, almost 1,000
people have applied for Stegner
Fellowships from all across the
United States and the world — 1
percent of these applicants have
been accepted.
Stegner, who died in 1993,
studied at the lowa Writer's Work
shop and taught writing at Har
vard University. To create Stan
ford's program, he combined the
best elements of both institutions,
said L'Heureux.
"IStegner] was an incredibly
dynamic, dignified, handsome per
sonage," L'Heureux said. "He had
a terrific verbal sense of humor,
but he was unequivocally serious
and dedicated to the notion that
this program should be unlike
other programs and should be the
most distinguished."
One of the unique ideas Stegner
had for attaining his goal was for
Stanford's program not to grant
degrees. By not having writers and
poets work toward degrees,
L'Heureux said, the program con
fers on them for their two-year
tenures the status of professionals
rather than of students. Addition
ally, not offering degrees has kept
the focus of the program purely on
writing as opposed to on academic
credentials.
In applying, said L'Heureux,
"The only criterion is writing. You
can get in without ever having

gone to college.
Among the writers who have
done just that is Tillie Olsen. Born
in 1912, Olsen was unable to write
or study because she was working
and raising four children. Since
her experience as a Stegner Fel
low, Olsen has published five
books, won a Guggenheim award
and received honorary degrees
from five schools.
Olsen's success is not atypical
for Stegner Fellows. "The most
satisfying part of being director
was being able to give away money
to people who really needed it, [so
they could avoid] the unnecessary
nonsense of living in a garret and
starving," said L'Heureux. "See
ing people with enormous talent
realize that talent — and that
doesn't mean being famous — is
immensely gratifying."
Currently, the number of fel
lowships granted stands at 10 per
year, having risen from six when
the program started. The money is
divided equally between poets and
writers, a precedent L'Heureux
established in 1976. Previously,
fewer poets than fiction writers
received the fellowships, lie said.
His decision "was an attempt to
equalize, so the poets wouldn't feel
like they were second-class citi
zens."
Among today's Stegner Fel
lows, neither the poets nor the
writers express feelings of second
class citizenship, mostly because
they are too busy praising the pro
gram and remarking on their luck
at being a part of it.
"For me, the fellowship came at
a time when I really needed it,"
said Jennifer Call, a poet in her
second year here. "It was a real
godsend."
Prior to coming to Stanford,
Call had been working toward her
master's of fine arts at the Univer
sity of Michigan. "I'd been teach
ing freshman composition and
thinking, 'Oh my God, I can't do
this, I'm not good at this, what am

I going to do with my life?'" said
Call. "There were specific cycles of
poems and projects I wanted to
work on, and I knew I would need
an extended amount of time."
A Stegner Fellowship offers
both tangible and intangible bene
fits, according to Call. Among the
obvious advantages, Call said, are
"connections to a university and a
library and readers." As for the
intangible benefits, "There's some
thing powerful about being told
that | writing) is all you have to do.
It's an enormous gift of time."
For Keith Scribner, a fiction
writer in his first year, the greatest
advantage of the Stegner program
is its size. Previously, Scribner was
in an master's of fine arts program
at the University of Montana.
"In an M. F. A., program, you
were squeezed in with everyone
else," Scribner said. "Here, we get
unlimited access to the professors
because there are so few of us. We
can develop relationships with
Elizabeth ITallent] and John
IL'Heureux] and [English Prof. 1
Gil [Sorrentinol. I'm welcoming
their guidance."
As proof of the positive influ
ence such mentors are exerting on
him, Scribner mentioned, "I've
had dreams with Elizabeth in
them, as this presence in my
world."
In addition to appearing in peo
ple's dreams, Tallent's responsibil
ities as program director include
teaching, fund raising and work
ing on her own short stories.
Although Tallent was not avail
able for comment, L'Heureux said
of her, "She's brought new inter
est and young energy to the pro
gram. She's passionately devoted
and enormously intelligent. I don't
think she'll change the program
except to make it better."
Scribner is as enthusiastic
about the other Stegner Fellows in
his workshop as he is about the
professors. "The group we have is
terrific," he said. "I've never been

among a bunch of writers whom I
not only like but whom I really
respect as writers."
According to Tom Barbash,
who is in his last year as a Jones
Lecturer, the workshops are not
always so successful.
"It seems to me that sometimes
in the past the group didn't cohere
as well as it does now," Barbash
said. "When they pick the Stegn
ers, they pick them on the basis of
their writing. There's no interview
process, so they don't know if the
group will work. You take your
chances."
"When people get together at
Tresidder after [the) workshop,
it's a sign that things are work
ing," Barbash added. "It's a sign
that things are working if people
who have been in a high pressure
situation for two hours want to
spend another two hours around
each other, to have beer, then din
ner."
In a situation in which every
one is interested and talented in
the same area, the possibility of
competition always exists, said
current fellows.
"Sometimes it feels like every
body in the world is a writer, try
ing for the same puny piece of suc
cess," said Cammie McGovern, a
fiction writer in her second year.
"There are times when we're all
sending (manuscripts) to the exact
same magazines and contests. You
fight [competition] by sharing
information about agents and edi
tors. In the past, it's been embar
rassing, or people have felt self
conscious, so they didn't exchange
information."
Competition also can be less
ened by the presence of a wide
range of writing styles in a work
shop. "Sam [Changl writes about
her parents' lives and being the
child of immigrants. She has his
torical placing and context," said
McGovern. "I write about contem
porary women who are losers."
Despite the intensity of the

workshops, the admiration Scribn
er conveys for his classmates and
teachers is echoed by numerous
Stegner Fellows from varying time
periods. For Tobias Wolff, a Stegn
er Fellow from 1975 to 1976 and
the author of five books including
the best-selling "This Boy's Life,"
being in a workshop "was a turning
point in my life. I'd been working
alone and at odd jobs, and I was
suddenly in a community that
cared as much as I did about read
ing and writing and talking about
reading and writing."
One of his classmates, Wolff
said, was Harriet Doerr, who
entered the program at the age of
69.
"Harriet was amazingly mod
est," Wolff remembered. "She
would always say, 'Well, I know
this isn't any good. You all are the
real writers.' " Doerr's first novel,
"Stones For Ibarra," won the
National Book Award in 1984.
At times, participants in the
program can seem like members of
a mutual fan club. L'Heureux,
according to Wolff, "is very erudite
and learned and encouraging."
Wolff, according to L'Heureux, "is
a prince among men." In a gesture
of similar affection, Doerr and
L'Heureux have dedicated recent
books to each other. McGovern,
who is pregnant for the first time,
reported that her classmates rail
her unborn child "the Stegner
baby" and have suggested that she
name it Wallace.
Although current Stegner Fel
lows readily discuss the sense of
community which extends far
beyond the classroom, they claim
to be much tamer than their pre
decessors. Most notably, they say
they differ from the legendary Ken
Kesey. Kesey, the author of "One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and
the original "Merry Prankster,"
was paid by the government to
participate in experiments involv
ing hallucinogenic drugs.
"I wasn't there for those days,

thank God," said L'Heureux.
However, L'Heureux admitted
that in the '70s, he was once called
on to bail a drunk fellow out of jail
in the middle of the night.
"Times have changed," McGov
ern said in reference to such sto
ries. "People have become bigger
nerds. We're focusing on getting
our work done."
According to Scribner, howev
er, today's fellows can rouse them
selves when the situation requires
it. "Cammie |McGovern| recently
had a great drunken bash, and we
all danced, and I was sweating pro
fusely," said Scribner. "It was
great."
The gathering, Scribner said,
was to celebrate the birthday of
Jones Lecturer Sheila Donohue.
"Just after midnight, Ken Dickson
[another Stegner Fellow 1 pro
duced a bottle of champagne, made
a really nice toast about being pur
sued by happiness, and sang a long
Irish folk song. He's from North
Carolina, but he sang in a great
Irish brogue. Everyone was a little
embarrassed for the first 10 sec
onds and then enchanted. Every
one fell in love with him for a
moment."
On a daily basis, however, life is
not quite so exciting, and writing is
almost always the focus of Stegner
Fellows' days.
"Writing is the most complicat
ed pleasure in mv life," said first
year fiction writer Peter Rock. "I
started out thinking writing was a
sexy thing, where you take cross
country driving trips and hang out
in cafes and smoke cigarettes.
I Actually, | it involves sitting at a
table all day. But the harder I've
worked, the more rewarding it's
been. I love to do it."
Wallace Stegner would be
proud.

The Stegner Fellows will give
readings of their works at the
Stanford Bookstore tomorrow and
Thursday at 7 p.m.
