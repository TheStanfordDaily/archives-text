# Stanford has mixed reactions to latest UC Regents decision
## 
### David Stein Contributing write 
Although the University of California Board of
Regents stood firm against affirmative action at a
meeting Thursday, Stanford student leaders remain
divided on the issue.
In an unruly meeting during which 11 students
were arrested, the regents decided to uphold their
decision to stop using race and sex as criteria in
admitting students, hiring professors and awarding
contracts.
Even though he was not expecting a reversal,
Council of Presidents member Rich Stolz said he felt
"personally disappointed" about the vote. He said
that although the destruction of affirmative action
programs will not immediately affect Stanford, it
may have some negative consequences.
"Our brothers and sisters and friends who will
want to attend UC schools in the future will be
hurt," Stolz explained. "Graduate students who
want to attend these schools in the future may be
affected."
However, Julie Johnson, president of the Stan
ford College Republicans, praised the vote as the
"right thing to do."
"It was the right decision the first time," she said,
"and they were obviously convinced that the policy
was still the best thing."
Johnson said she was speaking only on her own
behalf and not for the Stanford College Republicans.
ASS I' senator Bill Shen, who organized an affir
mative action rally in November featuring Jesse
Jackson, said he felt the board's refusal to overturn
its decision did not reflect the will of the people.

"The wishes of the students and faculty at the
UC schools were ignored," Shen said. "This was not
a process of the people; it was an action by the pup
pets of [California Gov.) Pete Wilson."
Wilson, who spearheaded the vote in July to abol
ish affirmative action, appointed several of the
regents. According to Shen, this seeming partisan
ship of a supposedly nonpartisan body perpetuates
"politics as usual."
On the other hand, .Johnson feels the vote reflect
ed the strong points of the political process.
"Wilson's political office did of course influence
the decision, but the people elected Wilson knowing
what he stood for," Johnson added.
Furthermore, Shen and Johnson disagreed on
the effectiveness of the protests by the arrested stu
dents, who were escorted from the regents' meeting
after they spoke longer than their allotted time.
"I believe there are ways to work within the sys
tem to get your message across," Shen said. "Get
ting arrested does undermine your position, but
there are times when that's what it takes."
Johnson took a different view, saying that "dis
cussion is more reliable than disruption." She said
she felt that, since the opponents of affirmative
action have the "moral high ground," proponents
often have to resort to "anger and disruption."
Not satisfied with the current state of affirma
tive action, Shen plans to concentrate his efforts on
the upcoming California Civil Rights Initiative,
which proposes to ban all forms of preferential
treatment.
"There is a lot of confusion right now and our aim
is to educate," Shen said. "There is still racism in
America and we have to realize it's there."
