WHY THE BUDGET CANNOT BE BALANCED
Some very important people have recently suggested that the U.S. budget should be balanced. They are
making this recommendation even though a) there has not been a balanced budget in the U.S. over a five
year period since 1925-30, b) the five prior "balanced budget" fervors in the 1800's all led to depres
sions (see Barron s 1/2/96 Current Yield Column), and c) no major industrialized nation balances its
budget. The Maastricht treaty to unite Europe requires a deficit not greater than 3% of GDP. The U.S. deficit is
currently 2.3% of GDP The main U.S. problem is the trade deficit, not the budget deficit. In Japan, deficits
were reduced (not eliminated) from 1989-1993. That country is still in recession, and is about to issue $47
trillion yen ($468 billion U.S.) in new 1996 debt to stimulate its economy.
i here is no question that we should strive to maximize productivity and minimize consumption That is
different from blindly balancing the budget.
CHALLENGE TO ALL PROPONENTS OF A BALANCED BUDGET: $400,000 to the first person who
explains wny the articles "Why There Must be a Deficit," and "Analyzing the Economy with Poker" are
incorrect in a broad sense These articles, which are available without charge by callinq 800-666-3903 or
writing to Box 7634, Beverly Hills, CA 90212 explain that
a) Cutting spending to the poor by $30 billion/year will decrease the incomes of the non-poor by
more than $30 billion/year. The poor spend virtually everything they receive. Consequently, when they
-eceive $30 bilhon.year less, they will spend roughly $30 billion/year less for food, healthcare, rent, etc.
which will cause the incomes of merchants, doctors, and landlords, etc. to go down by at least $30 billion/
year These individuals may spend the same dollar received from the poor several times over between
themselves. For example, a grocer receiving a dollar from the poor may spend that on his doctor who may
hen spend that on his car dealer. As a result, a $30 billion cut to the poor will cause incomes of the middle/
upper class to go down by substantially more than $30 billion/year.
b) Cutting income to a person creates pain similar to raising their taxes. For example, cutting spending
to the poor by S3O billion/year is about as painful to them as leaving spending the same and increasinq
taxes on them by $30 billion/year.
c) The multiplicative impact of a spending cut on the poor is more painful to the country as a
whole than thn impact of a tax increase on the rich. As argued above, a $30 billion spending cut on the
poor will ripple through the ». -;onomy from the poor to the upper classes, creating a loss of income and a
owering of demand for goods and services several times the size of the spending cut. On the other hand,
because the wealthy spend only a fraction of their before-tax incomes, and because most income to the
wealthy does not 'low back' to the poor, an increase in taxes on the wealthy will not have the same
multiplicative negative impact as will an equivalent spending cut on the poor.
d) The deficit represents a loss to the government and a "win" to the private sector. The $4* trillion
national debt represents $4 * trillion in wealth to Americans and foreigners who hold U.S. IOUs either directly
or via their accounts at banks, savings and loans, money market funds, etc. Eliminating the deficit by a
combination of tax increases and spending cuts eliminates the after-tax "win" to the private sector caused
by the deficit and has a profound impact on the incentive to produce and innovate. Aside from reducing
incomes and causing a reduction in the production of goods and services, it is likely to lead to a decline in
prires which will precipitate low interest rates and a depression, as occurred .n the 1800's, the 1930'5, and
more recently in Japan.
MYTHS CONCERNING BALANCED BUDGETS
1. Balancing the budget will lead to lower interest rates which will enhance growth." There is no
historical evidence to support the enhanced growth claim. The last six times the budget was balanced for
five or more years we had depressions.
2. Our children will be crushed by the debt we leave them." Tnis may be true, but it is predominantly a
consequence of the ongoing trade deficit, not the budget deficit. Owing money to ourselves is not nearly as
bad as owing money to foreigners. If we increase production, reduce consumption (by modifying the tax
code), and insist on fair trade, we will make good progress in this area without balancing the budget. Reducing
the mte of deficit growth is tin" bringing the deficit down to zero for prolonged periods has historically had
disastrous consequences
3. I balance my buaget why can t the government do the same." The government has to take care of
many needy people who with )ut Government help could not "balance their budgets." If for example, the
government cut in half all aid t) the blind, disabled veterans, those on welfare, medicaid, etc. you would see
a) many more pf ople begging and dying on the streets, b) much more cr.me, and c) the probable burning of
American citie" Taking care oi the needy does not help our foreign trade deficit or our government deficit
but it is the Ameiican way. Tolerating unfair trade practices and exporting American jobs overseas should
not be the American way.

disastrous consequences
3. I balance my buaget why can t the government do the same." The government has to take care of
many needy people who with )ut Government help could not "balance their budgets." If for example, the
government cut in half all aid t) the blind, disabled veterans, those on welfare, medicaid, etc. you would see
a) many more pf ople begging and dying on the streets, b) much more cr.me, and c) the probable burning of
American citie" Taking care oi the needy does not help our foreign trade deficit or our government deficit
but it is the Ameiican way. Tolerating unfair trade practices and exporting American jobs overseas should
not be the American way.
