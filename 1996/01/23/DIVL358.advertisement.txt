The Treasury Department functions as an in-house investment bank, financial advisor and investment manager for The Walt Disney
Company. The success of the Treasury Department in increasing shareholder value has earned Disney an unparalleled reputation for
innovative financing techniques and investment and risk management strategies. Major areas of focus include corporate finance, project
finance, municipal finance, cash and investment management, and investment rate risk and foreign exchange management. In addition
to developing excellent qualitative and analytical skills, the analyst can expect to gain insight into the executive decision-making process
through extensive exposure to Disney's senior management as well as to commercial and investment bankers.
A leader in the entertainment industry, The Walt Disney Studios Group is comprised of over 20 operating units including Touchstone,
Hollywood, Walt Disney and Caravan Pictures, Feature Animation, Theatrical Productions, Hollywood Records, Network Television,
Domestic and International Syndicated Television, Interactive Media, The Disney Channel, and Domestic and International Home Video.
Financial Analysts are primarily involved in the financial forecasting and reporting of the business unit and the annual operating and
five-year strategic planning processes. In addition, analysts assess new markets and opportunities. Recent projects include developing a
business plan for the newly formed Disney Interactive Media unit, analyzing potential product acquisitions for home video, and
assessing the financial viability of taking an animated feature such as Beauty and the Beast to Broadway. The Studio is a creative,
unstructured environment that demands self-starting, outgoing team players. Analysts can expect to gain an in-depth knowledge of the
entertainment business and the operations of a major studio, as well as extensive financial experience.
Resumes, cover letters, and transcripts must be received by Friday, January 26, 1996, and should be directed to the
