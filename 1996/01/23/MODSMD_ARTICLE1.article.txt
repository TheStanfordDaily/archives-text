## Debate centers on Prop. 187's effects on public health 
### Kerry Rodgers 
Although the symposium was
titled "Health Care for Illegal Im
migrants: A Moral Debate," dis
cussion had little to do with
morals and much to do with public
health and finances.
The two sides of the controver
sial Proposition 187 — a state bal
lot measure passed in November
1994 that would deny basic social
services such as welfare, educa
tion and non-emergency health
care to illegal immigrants — came
together last night in Fairchild
Auditorium, focusing more on the
initiative itself than the health
care issues it raises.
Although two-thirds of Califor
nia's voters were in favor of the
measure, it has not yet gone into ef
fect because of a complicated legal
battle over its constitutionality.
Yolanda Vera, a lawyer for the
Center for Biomedical Ethics,
which sponsored the program,
warned that failure to provide
health care to illegal immigrants
would cause a public health crisis.
She told the crowd of about 85
that it is imperative to "screen
communicable diseases" like
STDs, measles and tuberculosis
out of pure "self-interest."
However, she noted that many
of these diseases — such as conta
gious pneumonia and tuberculosis
— can seem like minor coughs.
Unless comprehensive care is pro
vided, the illness could be over
looked, causing a major threat to
the population at large.
In addition, she explained that
providing comprehensive care is
much more cost-effective than the
current federal policy of only pro
viding emergency care to illegal
immigrants. "Providing antibiotics
for an ear infection can cost $20,"
Vera said, whereas an untreated
ear infection could turn into a case
of meningitis, costing thousands of
dollars in emergency care.
Ronald Prince, an accountant
who is chairman of the pro-Propo
sition 187 group known as Save
Our State, denied accusations that
proponents of the measure are
"mean-spirited," claiming that the
issue is simply financial.
"We have too many people using
our services and not contributing,"
he said, adding that he believes this
overload will result in the imminent
bankruptcy of Los Angeles and
eventually the state of California.
"We must begin to ration our
services to those who are legally eli
gible," Prince said. He cited a
financial shortfall last November
in Los Angeles County which

would have resulted in the closure
of two major county hospitals and
30 publicly funded health care clin
ics if the federal government had
not bailed them out.
However, it is "unfair to yell 'the
sky is falling!' and point a finger at
illegal immigrants," Vera said.
Rather, the financial problem is
due to tax structure, the state shift
ing burdens to local governments
and diminishing federal funds.
Prince claimed that illegal aliens
do not pay taxes and "use services
at twice the rate of citizens."
He said it is important to distin
guish between illegal aliens who,
he noted, compose one-sixth of the
state prison population, and legal
immigrants "who came into the
country the right way."
Vera said the implementation of
regulations prohibiting care to
undocumented immigrants falls
unfairly on the shoulders of health
care workers, making them act like
police and "breaking the trust in
the patient-doctor relationship."
Prince pointed out instances in
which a patient has bodily evidence
of a crime, such as a gunshot
wound, and the doctor or nurse is
required to report it.
