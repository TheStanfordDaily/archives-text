Another shutdown possible
WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican congression
al leaders searched yesterday for a way to avoid a
new federal shutdown at week's end, but they
showed little desire to heed Clinton administration
pleas for quick action to head off a first-ever federal
default by March 1.
Eager to avoid election-year blame for a third par
tial closure of federal agencies since November, top
Republicans hoped for congressional passage as
early as tomorrow of legislation keeping programs
functioning for perhaps another month. Without
such a bill, dozens of agencies would once again have
to put some operations in mothballs after the close of
business Friday.
The trick for Republican leaders, was balancing
conservatives' demands for budget slashes with ;i
bill President Clinton would sign. They were consid
ering financing affected agencies at about 75 percent
of last year's levels and eliminating some minor pro
grams whose termination Clinton might accept
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said 12 to 1 fi small
programs might also be killed. GOP aides listed pos
sibilities as the National Biological Survey, which
studies endangered species, and the Bureau of
Mines, which the administration has already shut

under GOP pressure.
The focus on keeping the government open and
on federal borrowing reflected a belief by many
Republicans that their effort to reach a budget-bal
ancing agreement with Clinton was probably over.
Senate Majority leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., more
optimistic than many, said there was "still some
glimmer of hope" that a deal could be completed.
