### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Under
siege in the Whitewater affair,
Hillary Rodham Clinton has been
subpoenaed to testify Friday l>efore
a grand jury investigating the mys
terious discovery of her law firm
hilling records in the White House
residence.
Trying to determine whether
anyone hid the long-sought docu
ments from investigators, White
water prosecutor Kenneth Starr
also subpoenaed three White
House aides and two of the Clin
tons' personal attorneys, the White
I louse announced yesterday.
Clinton's appearance will be her
first before a Whitewater grand
jury, although she has answered
questions under oath for prosecu
tors three other times.
"As the first lady has always
said, she is as eager as anyone to
resolve questions regarding the
billing records, and she will contin
ue to provide whatever help she
can ... to resolve these issues," the

White House said in a statement.
"Friday's testimony will offer the
first lady the opportunity to tell the
independent counsel what she
knows about these matters."
Earlier yesterday, Clinton had
offered to supply written answers
to questions from the Senate
Whitewater Committee, which
also is investigating the unex
plained appearance of the docu
ments two years after they were
first demanded by Whitewater
prosecutors. The committee's
Republican chairman put off ques
tioning the first lady, saying inves
tigators want to gather more docu
ments first.
The Senate committee also
announced it plans to continue its
investigation indefinitely and
needs another $600,000. The panel
originally was scheduled to finish
its work Feb. 29.
Others summoned before the
grand jury in Washington include:
• David Kendall, the Clintons'

main Whitewater lawyer. He was'
the person notified when aide Car
olyn Huber said she found the.
records Jan. 4. Kendall turned over'
the records to prosecutors the next
day.
• Nicole Seligman, another
lawyer in Kendall's firm.
• Capricia Marshall, executive
assistant to the first lady. Marshall
had regular access to the room,
where the records were found by
Huber. Huber testified last week
she actually found the records last
August on a table in the White
House residence book room. She
put them in a box and forgot about
them until this month, when she
examined them and realized what
they were.
• Gary Walter, the head usher at
the White House. He knows who
has entered and exited the White
House personal residence.
• Jane Sherburne, special White
House counsel to the Clintons on
Whitewater matters.
