## Editorial Election countdown 
### 
ASSU and students
should plan now to
ensure smooth vote

IT'S THAT TIME of year again.
We're talking, of course, about
the upcoming ASSU elections.
Even though the actual voting on
special fees, COP slates and senate
candidates is months away, stu
dent groups are already working
on their budgets, and the ASSU
should be making preparations to
ensure that everything runs
smoothly.
To do that, the association lead
ership needs to revisit some old
business left over from last year's
election. One complaint some had
was the revised budget formats
used for the first time in last year's
Elections Handbook. Gone were
the old line-item budgets that listed
exactly where the money would be
spent; instead, the handbook listed
conglomerated annual budgets
with broad categories like salaries,
publicity, literature, food and — our
favorite — miscellaneous.
Although well-meaning, this
simplification made it extremely
difficult for voters to judge how
efficiently a group planned to use
its special-fee money. For example,
you could not look at a program
proposed by a group and figure out
how much of the cost of the event
went to food, how much to publici
ty or how much to speaker's fees.
Instead, there were consolidated
line-items that listed how much
the group planned to spend on
items like food and honoraria for
the entire year.
Fortunately, ASSU leaders say
they are already planning to
change the formats of special-fee
group budgets. That's a good
move, and the ASSU deserves
credit for having the foresight to
take on this issue ahead of time.
Another piece of old business
still needs to be addressed, howev

er: the aftermath of the "Common
Sense Fee Reform," an amend
ment to the ASSU Constitution
which passed in last year's election
but still has not officially become
part of the constitution. To become
part of that document, it has to be
approved by University President
Gerhard Casper or one of his rep
resentatives, such as Dean of Stu
dents Marc VVais. That hasn't hap
pened yet; it needs to soon.
The amendment was the culmi
nation of a history of discontent
with the special-fee process, par
ticularly from graduate students
who felt they were forced to pay
ASSU dues for services and groups
used only by undergraduates.
Overwhelmingly approved, it
divides the electorate into three
different voting "populations"
that special-fee groups can choose
to approach for the special-fee. A
group that feels it primarily serves
undergraduates, for example, can
decide to ask only for a fee from
that population. Groups can also
ask for fees from graduates only or
from the entire student body.
This change is a significant one
that will impact how groups write
and submit budgets. Given the
impending elections, the ASSU
should act quickly to ensure that it
is officially implemented. With
Casper's expected appearance at
tonight's ASSU Senate meeting,
senators might want to ask him to
clear up the situation as quickly as
possible.
Additionally, interested slates,
candidates and special-fee groups
should attend a meeting tomorrow
night at 8 p.m. in Tresidder Oak
West. Information on deadlines
and requirements will be avail
able.
On a related note, The Daily
Editorial Board — as it does in
each election — plans to interview
special-fee groups and issue recom
mendations before the vote. The
Board will be publishing its guid
ing criteria for its endorsements in
the near future so voters know in
advance what priorities are behind
The Dailv's endorsements.
