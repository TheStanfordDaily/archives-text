## One-unit opportunity 
### 
Everyone knows how impor
tant it is to be "well-rounded."
Many people, however, forget that
being well-rounded extends to the variety
of classes you take. Talk to a person who
is taking four computer science classes
this quarter and you'll get a glimpse of
the kind of thing you can turn into if all
your classes are in the same subject.
I'm not going to suggest that CS and
physics majors take English and Poli Sci
for fun. Rather, I'm suggesting that
everyone look into the whole slew of great
classes that aim to teach us skills we will
have no time to learn when our years at
Stanford are over.
I'm referring to the one-unit classes
that abound in the Department of Athlet
ics. The classes that won't help you grad
uate. The classes that you won't put on
your resume.
Get out the Stanford Bulletin and look
on pages 334-341. Jazz Dance, Argentine
Tango and Swing, Sailing, Water Polo,
Fencing, Gymnastics, Soccer, Tennis,
Volleyball and Kenpo Karate are just a
sampling of the fun classes Stanford has
to offer. If you're not taking one of these
classes this quarter, you should be
ashamed of yourself because you're miss
ing out on some of the coolest opportuni
ties here.
Many psycho-academics would
resDond to that bv lamenting their lack of

time for such frivolity. Undergraduates
at Stanford tend to be very future-orient
ed. They will look at their current sched
ule not in terms of how it can increase
their happiness now, hut how it will have
a positive or negative effect on their
future. Because of this, many students
wouldn't touch a one-unit athletics class
with a 10-foot pole, thinking about that
extra two hours they would be missing in
Green Library.
What these students don't see, howev
er, is how these one-unit gems can have a
wonderful impact on their future. Not
only does an athletic or artistic skill
increase your overall enjoyment of life,
but people in your social and working life
will be impressed with such abilities. In
10 years, no one is going to care that you
majored in biology and English. But if you
got up in a charity ball and danced a killer
swing, you can bet that people will notice.
Yes Virginia, a class can have value even if
it won't help you get into law school.
In my time here, I have made a point
of taking at least one class each quarter
purely for fun and self-improvement. My
intermediate volleyball class gave me the
skill and confidence to join any friendly
game of the sport, and my clay-modeling
class allowed me to truly appreciate the
skill that went into Rodin's "Thinker,"
which I pass by every day.
Two of the best units I ever spent here

were in Richard Powers' classes, Social
Dance of North America and Argentine
Swing and tango. Not only were the class
es incredibly fun, but the skill has already
served me well. Last summer at my
cousin's Bar Mitzvah, I had the pleasure
of dancing the tango with my grandmoth
er. To my surprise, my education-oriented
relatives were more impressed with my
steps than with where I was going to
school.
Of course, unlike many students here,
I'm lucky enough to have parents who
share my appreciation of the enjoyable
things in life, even though I'm spending
$30,000 a year to enjoy them. I under
stand that many parents coerce their kids
to double-major, to take 20 units a quar
ter, to major in something they care
nothing about. They are master chefs,
cooking carbon copies of themselves.
Never mind the fact that their kids will
turn out as unhappy as they are.
Think of the possibilities. Before you
leave Stanford, you can be a tae kwon do
black belt, a great tennis player or an
expert sailor.
The sacrifice is just one unit a quarter.
