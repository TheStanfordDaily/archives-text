Senior class presidents rebuke Daily editorial

OFTEN, THE EDITORIAL Board
of The Daily jumps to conclusions
and states its position before
doing the proper research or asking any
questions of those involved with the
issue at hand. Another instance of the
editorial staffs swiftness to criticize is
its Jan. 17 editorial titled "Selecting
speakers". We are thoroughly disap
pointed that the authors of this editorial
did not do a thorough investigation
before their assumptions were printed.
Selecting a Commencement speaker is
a difficult and time-intensive process.
Obviously, Stanford students have
encountered and admired many signifi
cant individuals whose insight would be
ideal for the setting of a graduation. Our
goal as senior class presidents was to
nominate several speakers, all of whom
would be eloquent and memorable.

We began the process of creating a list
of potential speakers in October when
we sent out a newsletter to over 1,600
seniors in which we asked for any speak
er suggestions to be e-mailed to us.
Another way in which we asked for sug
gestions was through a banner in White
Plaza. Both of these "advertisements"
were done early enough so that the com
ments of our peers, whom we represent,
could be given utmost consideration.
Besides actively soliciting classmates, we
met with and e-mailed professors,
administrators, alumni and community
members so that their ideas could be
considered as well.
Throughout the second half of fall
quarter, we constantly chipped away at
our extensive list of close to 50 possible
speakers in order to present to Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper our top

seven recommendations. Before making
decisions, we did our research to learn
more about lesser-known candidates,
and we even talked to some people who
had previously heard some of the candi
dates speak to an audience. All of this
input was thoughtfully discussed and
evaluated until we were able to finalize a
list of seven possible speakers.
In regards to the requirement that the
speaker be affiliated with Stanford, it
must be understood by all that this "tradi
tion" only began with the Casper adminis
tration. It is our opinion that although
someone without any Stanford connection
could still be an excellent speaker, a per
son who has experienced some part of
Stanford life, as a student , educator or
administrator, will best be able to relate to
the graduating class and its unique experi
ences while attending the Farm.

We view these steps taken as active
attempts to gain a varied perspective on
a selection process that otherwise may
have been political or secretive. Hopeful
ly, the Stanford community will be more
than satisfied with the decision that is
made and will wait to judge the speaker
until after they have heard him or her at
Commencement. We are confident that
this year's speaker will be inspiring to
all. '
As always, we encourage our class
mates and anyone else to offer their sug
gestions to us so that we can make the
senior year of the Class of '96 an out
standing one. Please take the time to e
mail us at seniorclasspresidents
