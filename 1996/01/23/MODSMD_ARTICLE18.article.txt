# Alum says response from Leland was inadequate
## 
### 
It was quite big of you, Mr. Leland,
to respond directly to Chris Golde's
perceptive concerns about the cost of
the football team's bowl trip to Mem
phis. Unfortunately, you utterly failed

to address the main point of her let
ter.
We know Stanford earned a
$750,000 payday from the Liberty
Bowl, but it appears from Golde's
information that the costs of the trip
combined with those of the unsold but
guaranteed ticket purchases were
larger, making the trip a scandalous
money loser. If true, how can you even

begin to justify such actions when
your department apparently already
operates in the red?
Now is the time for you to open tin
books and give us some hard and fast
figures if you want anyone on this
campus to believe your assertion that
the Liberty Bowl trip wasn't a finan
cial drain on scarce resources. We
want real proof, not the palaver you

choose to serve us.
Additionally, I won't even bother to
question the logic of sending a team to
a minor bowl after more than a month
layoff. We can blame that on the bozos
at the Aloha Bowl who earned every
minute of mighty UCLA's tremendous
display of offensive football.
