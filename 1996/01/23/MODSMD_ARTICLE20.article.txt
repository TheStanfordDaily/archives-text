## Homeless need everybody's help 
### Al Camarillo 
SINCE 1990, I have taught a service-learning course on poverty
and homelessness in America, and this year, as in the past, I am
deeply impressed with the level of commitment students enrolled
in the course make to the academic study of the social issue of serv
ing homeless people in shelters.
In addition to their formal studies, students are involved in an
intensive six-month internship at a variety of shelter agencies
serving homeless adults and children in Santa Clara and San
Mateo counties. What strikes me as different about 1996, in com
parison to 1990 when I first offered the course, is that volun
teerism today to help the homeless is much more critically needed.
Why is this?
Beginning in the 1980s, when homelessness was identified as a
"national social issue," a variety of non-profit organizations and
governmental agencies responded with resources to address the
crisis. An increasing trend of joblessness, industry layoffs and eco
nomic restructuring coupled with recession cycles and the growing
lack of affordable housing cast hundreds of thousands of Ameri
cans into the streets searching for shelter.
A fragile network of emergency and transitional housing pro
grams for homeless families and individuals sprouted across the
urban and suburban landscapes of the U.S., a development that
allowed a large percentage of homeless people to be housed tem
porarily while they struggled to regain some stability in their lives.
National, state and local agencies contributed to this effort in
helping impoverished Americans gain access to emergency shelters
and services. Volunteers across the nation also responded to this
new crisis by giving of their time and money. Stanford students
were part of this movement.
This safety net — a combination of federal, state and county
programs — is badly tattered and ridden with holes, and families
and individuals are falling through the gaps. Federal resources are
shrinking in a Congressional environment that seeks to cut back
tremendously on services to the poor. If the Republican-controlled
Congress is able to achieve its goal of abolishing direct-benefit pro
grams to the impoverished — the majority of whom are children
and instead provide block grants to states to use them as they see
fit, the precarious safety net will surely crumble.
In 1994, in our neighboring counties of San Mateo and Santa
Clara, nearly 15,000 parents and children experienced an episode
of homelessness. Thousands used the safety net of shelters and
local, state and federal services to regain their balance and search
for permanent housing.
In the nine Bay Area counties in 1994, nearly 43,000 children
found themselves at one time or another without a roof over their
heads. The crisis of homelessness strikes children with a force we
cannot begin to understand in terms of long-term social and psy
chological effects.
Stanford undergraduates, in my course and through the Haas
Center for Public Service, continue to volunteer their time and
energy serving the homeless and poor citizens who live near cam
pus. To see the students in my course begin the process of their
internships in working with homeless families and children reas
sures me that Americans who care can make an enormous differ
ence.
But volunteerism must be accompanied by the commitment and

will of the nation to address social issues of great importance. As
people, we demonstrate humanity by serving and helping our fel
low human beings, but as citizens, we must insist that out nation
ally-elected officials and our democratic institutions not pull back
the scarce resources committed to supporting disadvantaged sec
tors of our society. Indeed, we must all do what we can through vol
unteerism and through the political process to maintain the safety
net that keeps millions of Americans from utter destitution and
despair.
