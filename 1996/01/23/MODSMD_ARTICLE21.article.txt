# Homelessness statistics for U.S. show trends and insufficiencies
## 
### 
• According to Housing and Urban Development estimates,
seven million people experienced homelessness in the last half of
the 80s.
• Poverty is the basic cause of homelessness and the number of
poor people in the U.S. has been increasing despite aggregate
economic growth. From 1992-1993, the number of poor people
in the U.S. increased from 38 million to 39.3 million. In 1993,
22.7 percent of all American children lived in poverty.
• The majority of homeless families are headed by women.
Homeless women often become homeless when they flee domes
tic violence and find shelters for battered women already filled.
For example, in New York City's domestic violence programs, 59
percent of the women and children seeking shelter are turned
away. About 50 percent of homeless women and children are
fleeing abuse.
• Veterans from the U.S. armed forces make up one-third of the
single male homeless population
• Over the last 20 years, 1.3 million low-rent housing units have
disappeared from the market. In the same period, the demand
for low-income rental units has gone up by over three million
units.
• Public housing is also insufficient for present needs. A 30-city
survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 1994 found that the
average wait for public housing was 21 months.
• Currently, 18 percent of the homeless population is employed.
Today's minimum wage jobs are often insufficient to cover hous
ing costs. A full-time minimum wage job (after taxes and tax
credits) left a family of four $5,100 below the poverty line in
1993.
• Over half of homeless single adults have drug or alcohol prob
lems. Is alcohol and drug abuse a serious problem for the home
less population? Yes. However, substance abuse can be both a
cause of homelessness and a reaction to homelessness. Treat
ment programs can help, but the lack of a sober environment
once a recovering abuser is ret urned to the streets often makes
sustained sobriety difficult.
• Mental illness is another image regularly associated with the
homeless. One-third of the single adult homeless population suf
fers from some form of severe and persistent mental illness. As
with substance abuse, the stress involved in living homeless
often exacerbates the mental illness and produces a cycle effect.
Once homeless, a mentally-ill person is likely to be homeless
longer, have less contact with friends and family, have more bar
riers to employment, be in poorer physical health and have more
contact with the legal system than other homeless people.
