# Those most qualified to speak on homelessness are often silenced
## 
### Cary A. Crittenden Jonathan Miller 
Too often, it is the case that the people with the
most valid testimony are listened to the least.
The welfare debate is owned by Congress. It col
lects the applicable statistics, consult its experts,
becomes advised and casts the votes which will
uphold or deny public assistance. Curiously, no
member of Congress receives a welfare check. Its
experts are sociologists, economists, university pro
fessors and others who have homes and eat daily.
The input from actual poor people is collected, inter
preted by middle-class minds, then given to upper
class minds for the last analysis. The complexity of
people's behavior as shaped by their history and
material circumstances is reduced to numbers.
A year ago, the Palo Alto City Council became
concerned with panhandlers begging in a manner
which it considered offensive. The council called this
conduct "aggressive panhandling" and created a
task force to make recommendations for city action.
Curiously, those panhandlers being accused of
aggressive behavior were not asked to speak at task

force meetings. In fact, not one homeless or panhan
dling person was asked to join the task force. How
ever, "experts" on the issue of panhandling, such as
the chief of police and the head of the Downtown
Marketing Committee, were guaranteed positions.
A year later, the council is concerned with pollu
tion of the San Francisquito Creek, which runs bv t he
Stanford Shopping Center. Homeless people camping
by the water are causing some of this pollution. Not
only are these homeless people not being invited to
city meetings concerning creek issues, but they are
actually denied entrance under the premise that they
will be "disruptive." Without dialogue, therefore, they
are being forced to move out of that area.
This article is not an invalidation of the opinions
of housed, privileged people. Rather, it serves as ;i call
for honest, respectful, inclusive dialogue dialogue
led by the very people being discussed. Somewhere in
this dialogue between housed and unhoused, privi
leged and poor lies an end to poverty and homeless
ness. However, this dialogue which we feel is essen
tial cannot occur while one group is act ively silenced,
its views eclipsed by the "experts."

We know of no thinkers more qualified than
homeless people to understand the causes and signif
icance of their extreme poverty. Dialogue with
oppressed people, their inclusion into the spheres
commonly considered "legitimate," is a beginning to
(he process of coalition-building, of coming together
not only despite our power differences, but because of
them in order to remove them. Oppressed people
will necessarily guide and direct this communication,
and we will attempt to dialogue with one another
horizontally as peers, becoming conscious of the
unjust harriers placed between us. These barriers
will then be the objects of our conscious work. When
we work to serve profit rather than life, these barri
ers are instead fortified. We must speak with one
another, investigate our common world, try to figure
out how we got to where we are and work to get to
where we need to be. To practice exclusion instead is
(o uphold oppression.
The discussion of homelessness printed here is
not meaningless, but if you want frank dialogue
about poverty and homelessness at Stanford, invite
poor people on campus. Talk solutions with them.

Allow them access to Stanford and its institutions.
There is no substitute for real dialogue. A newspaper
article written from a homeless perspective cannot
be "the voice of the street."
There is as much if not more diversity of perspec
tive and life experience among Americans on the
street as exists among housed Americans. In each of
these life stories and in every person's honest analy
sis of the significance behind their social situation,
however, lies the answers to society's weary list of
ills. Something as small as an article from a home
less perspective begins the gradual emergence from
silence, making accessible those people who have the
knowledge necessary for any legitimate action. In
this way, dialogue becomes not an end but a means
— a means to where or to what we do not know, but
it will involve homeless and other oppressed people
transforming the world.
