## Cardinal baseball set to swing No. 2 Cardinal to utilize rotation, experience to return to Omaha 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Last season, the Stanford baseball
team got a taste of the College World
Series in Omaha, Neb.
This year, the Cardinal, ranked No. 2
in the preseason by Baseball America
and Collegiate Baseball, looks not only
to reserve a seat at the table, but also to
top off its season with a College World
Series championship as the icing on the
cake.
In 1995, Baseball America named
Stanford as its No. 1 team in its presea
son rankings. The Cardinal fought
injuries early in the season, however,
and quickly fell in the polls.
Nevertheless, instead of folding,
Stanford bounced back in the second
half of the season, winning 14 of its
final 19 contests to post a 40-25 mark
for its 1995 campaign. Stanford fin
ished with a 20-10 record in the Pacific
-10 Conference's Southern Division
(Six-Pac), good for second place behind
national runner-up USC.
The Cardinal advanced to the Col
lege World Series by winning the Mid
west I Regional Championships in
Wichita, Kan. in dramatic fashion.
Faced with elimination after dropping a
3-1 decision to top-seeded Texas Tech,
the Cardinal reeled off three consecu
tive victories, including two over the
Red Raiders by scores of 3-2 and 6-5, to
earn a trip to Omaha.
This year's version of coach Mark
Marquess' tradition-laden program will

rely heavily on pitching and consistent
hitting to land itself back in the College
World Series in June.
The projected starting rotation
includes four of Baseball America's top
55 college prospects — junior Jason
Middlebrook, freshman Chad Hutchin
son, freshman Jeff Austin and sopho
more Kyle Peterson.

'Obviously, one of the
strongest points of our
team is the pitching staff.'
— A.J. Hinch

As a freshman last year, Peterson, a
hard-throwing right-hander, set numer
ous Stanford pitching records en route
to a 14-1 record and 112 strikeouts.
Middlebrook has recovered fully from
an elbow injury which ended his 1995
season in late March and looks to regain
the form of his freshman season, in
which he earned Third-Team All-Amer
ica honors from Collegiate Baseball.
Rounded out by senior Mario Igle
sias, the Cardinal starters, all right
handers, could comprise the best rota
tion in school history. The bullpen fea
tures returnees Brendan Sullivan, Tom
Reimers and John David Brammer,
who made a combined total of 64
appearances out of the bullpen in 1995.
"Obviously, one of the strongest
points of our team is the pitching staff,"
said senior A.J. Hinch. "In the four

years I've been here, this is definitely
the strongest staff with the most depth
we've had. We have two of the premier
pitchers in the country in Middlebrook
and Peterson. We'll look for good things
from both of them all year."
While the pitching staff should lead
Stanford to numerous victories, Hinch,
who has started in 173 of his 174 career
games behind the plate, stressed consis
tency in hitting as another key to Stan
ford's success.
"For our team, we as hitters have to
be consistent all year," Hinch said.
"With our pitching, there will not be
many games where we will be blown
out, so we need to do our best to get
runs on the board. We want to have
more of an action offense, not wait for a
big inning."
Hinch, a preseason First-Team All-
American selection and the only colle
giate player guaranteed a spot on Team
U.S.A. for the 1996 Olympic Games,
returns for his final season on the Farm
with a career batting average of .342
after hitting a career-best .366 last
year.
With the loss of Steve Carver, whose
14 homers led the Cardinal last season,
Hinch (20 career home runs, nine in
1995) is Stanford's leading power hitter
as well.
"One thing we won't impress people
with is our power," Sullivan said. "But
we still have a solid lineup from top to
bottom with good speed."
