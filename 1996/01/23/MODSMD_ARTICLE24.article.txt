# Swimmers drown Arizona, ASU
## Men maintain focus to dispose of Wildcats, Sun Devils with ease 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
Last weekend was business as usual for the No. 3
Stanford men's swimming team, which whipped No.
12 Arizona State on Friday 151.5-97.5 and thumped
No. 9 Arizona on Saturday 150-80. The Cardinal's
first meets since the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships in November demonstrated that Stanford
remains serious as always in its annual quest for a
national title.
"Sometimes it's hard to get ready to swim in ( ho
middle of training," said sophomore Tom Wilkens.
"But everybody motivated well considering that
there's more of a focus right now on getting ready
for the Olympic Trials (March 6-12) and the NCAAs
(March 28-30 at Austin, Texas)."
The two meets supplied a number of exciting
moments for the Cardinal. Though the caliber of
competition offered by the Sun Devils and the Wild
cats did not exactly inspire Stanford swimmers, the

Cardinal looked to itself and its individual perfor
mances to find plenty of motivation.
"We definitely had a good meet on Friday," said
senior co-captain Ray Carey. "But in a similar situa
tion on Saturday against a similar team, we realized
we had to get the excitement from ourselves. It was
good to repeat in dual meets what we had done in
Pac-10s without the hype and excitement surround
ing them."
The excitement came from many sources. Senior
diver David Johns put together two spectacular
meets, winning the one- and three-meter diving
competitions on both days.
"It's good to see David Johns diving well," said
coach Skip Kenney. "For us to do what we want to
do at NCAAs, all 18 swimmers have got to score
points."
Wilkens and junior Kevin Radvany each recorded
two wins on Friday while junior Scott Jones won two
races Saturday. Carey turned in an impressive per-

formance of his own in the 200-
ineter butterfly Saturday, beating
the second-place finisher by 14
seconds and posting a time that
would place him in the top four or
five in the world.
The freshman class also used
the weekend to showcase its value
to the team. Tate Blahnik contin
ued his solid season with victories
in the 200-yard backstroke on

Friday and in the 200-meter back
stroke on Saturday. Matt O'Mara
pushed Radvany in the distance
events and knocked eight seconds
off his career-best in the 1,000-
yard freestyle.
"The freshman are really set
ting themselves up to be the best
freshman class in the country,"
Wilkens said. "And the juniors
and seniors are starting to really
step up and provide some good
leadership."
The midseason meet gave the
Cardinal an opportunity to see
where it stands in its preparation

for the big meets in March.
"The meets acted as a road
map," said sophomore Scott Clay
pool. "It looks like everyone is
where they want to be at this
point in the season. And for those
few exceptions who aren't, they
know what they have to do to get
to where they want to be."
The most important priorities
for the swimmers at this point in
the season are to adhere to their
training schedule and to refine
their technique.
"We all swam well in terms of
putting our races together and
getting the technique down," said
Claypool. "Since Arizona and Ari
zona State are not real great
teams, it was more mental prepa
ration, and we see what we're
capable of doing."
"It's only seven weeks until the
big meets," Kenney said. "That's
where we're focusing and we're
right exactly where we wanted to
be at this time of year."
In preparation for the Olympic
Trials, the Cardinal swam a long
course meet Saturday instead of
the traditional short course. Sat
urday's contest was just one of
many indications that the trials
are influencing the Cardinal's
season.
However, many Stanford
swimmers believe that rather
than serving as a distraction, the
trials will help the team to swim
better at NCAAs.
"The best possible way to swim
fast at NCAAs is to go in as an
Olympian," Carey said.
