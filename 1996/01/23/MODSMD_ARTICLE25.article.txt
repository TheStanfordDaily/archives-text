Spectacular performances
from freshmen helped the
Stanford women's gymnastics
team dominate UC-Davis at
home in the schools' first
meeting last weekend.
The Cardinal easily defeat
ed the Aggies in its season
opener last Friday at Burnham
Pavilion. Stanford had prac
ticed until 7:30 p.m. the night
of the meet but nevertheless
managed to defeat the Aggies
189.375-180.75. The rigorous
training schedule gave the Car
dinal a competitive advantage
and allowed it to capture all
four exercises (floor exercises,
uneven bars, balance beam and
vault). For the Aggies, the loss
was their 19th straight.
Sophomore Keri Monahan
led the way for Stanford, dom
inating early on in the vault.
She continued her strong per
formance by winning the bal
ance beam and uneven bars
with a 9.775 and a 9.60 respec
tively. Monahan's routines cat
apulted her into first place
overall (38.725).
"Monahan was strong in all
events," said freshman Tracey
Kohl.
Kohl also impressed. In her
college debut, she tied for sec
ond place overall with a score
of 37.550. Kohl posted solid
performances on the vault and
in floor exercises. She was
pleased with her outing. "I
didn't make any major mis
takes," she said. "Now I just
have to fine-tune my rou
tines."
Freshman Katie Fitzpatrick
also competed well, finishing
second on the beam with a
score of 9.65. Sophomore
Misty Moore tied Kohl for sec
ond overall by winning the
floor exercise with a 9.70 and
holding her own on the uneven
bars.
