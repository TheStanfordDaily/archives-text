## Sophomore Monahan leads the way with first-place overall finish 
### Keith Rabkin 
Spectacular performances
from freshmen helped the
Stanford women's gymnastics
team dominate UC-Davis at
home in the schools' first
meeting last weekend.
The Cardinal easily defeat
ed the Aggies in its season
opener last Friday at Burnham
Pavilion. Stanford had prac
ticed until 7:30 p.m. the night
of the meet but nevertheless
managed to defeat the Aggies
189.375-180.75. The rigorous
training schedule gave the Car
dinal a competitive advantage
and allowed it to capture all
four exercises (floor exercises,
uneven bars, balance beam and
vault). For the Aggies, the loss
was their 19th straight.
Sophomore Keri Monahan
led the way for Stanford, dom
inating early on in the vault.
She continued her strong per
formance by winning the bal
ance beam and uneven bars
with a 9.775 and a 9.60 respec
tively. Monahan's routines cat
apulted her into first place
overall (38.725).
"Monahan was strong in all
events," said freshman Tracey
Kohl.
Kohl also impressed. In her
college debut, she tied for sec
ond place overall with a score
of 37.550. Kohl posted solid
performances on the vault and
in floor exercises. She was
pleased with her outing. "I
didn't make any major mis
takes," she said. "Now I just
have to fine-tune my rou
tines."
Freshman Katie Fitzpatrick
also competed well, finishing
second on the beam with a
score of 9.65. Sophomore
Misty Moore tied Kohl for sec
ond overall by winning the
floor exercise with a 9.70 and
holding her own on the uneven
bars.

Sophomore Keri Monahan's total of 38.725 was good enough for
first place overall against UC-Davis last weekend.
Meanwhile, freshman Amy
Murakami rebounded from a
back injury to win the vault. Her
score of 9.775 helped to secure
the event from a hungry Davis
team. Despite committing
numerous errors on the uneven
bars, the Aggies showed talent on
the vault, highlighted by a daz
zling routine by senior Shauna
Duggins.
Yet, Duggins' display did not
prove enough, and the Aggies
were unable to challenge the Car

dinal after the second event. The
Cardinal cruised to victory on the
floor and the beam.
According to Kohl, the Cardi
nal entered the contest with con
fidence. "We competed as a team
and were not concerned about
individual performances," she
said. "Team support was impor
tant." The Cardinal cheered each
other on and vigorously gave out
high-fives after strong perfor
mances.
Head coach Lisa Izzi made her
own contributions to the Cardi
nal triumph. A former competi
tor, Izzi is able to relate to her
athletes, understand their
injuries and instill confidence in

them. Her skill in pushing the
team to perform earned her the
first win in her head-coaching
career. I/./.i believes her team can
become a powerhouse in the
Pacific 10 Conference by continu
ing to show its team spirit and
determination.
Friday's meet served as a prac
tice for Stanford's encounters
against UCLA and Arizona next
week, as the Wildcats and defend
ing Pac-10 champion Bruins will
present the Cardinal with a more
formidable challenge than the
Aggies. In preparation for these
powerhouses, Stanford will con
tinue to improve its routines by
sharpening excecution.
