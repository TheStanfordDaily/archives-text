# Aikman and Cowboys to have Super afternoon verus not-so-Super Steelers
## 
### 
No sports section of any
major newspaper would be
complete this week with
out its very own supplement of
Super Bowl hype. Seeing how it's
rather unlikely that the Cowboys
or Steelers will be making local
coverage with an on-campus
appearance anytime soon, it
appears as if I'll be the lone source
of this fish wrap's dose of Super
Bowl hysteria.
Let the hype begin! After over
five months of the drama and sus
pense, the ups and downs, the
blood and sweat, the laughter and
tears that's known universally as
NFL football, it's all just finally
beginning. The Super Bowl is
finally here.
Not too excited?
Well, unless you're a Cowboys
fan, there's really no reason to be.
Entering the game as nearly two
touchdown favorites, Dallas
should have less trouble than it did
in its masterful 38-27 NFC Cham
pionship victory over Green Bay.
On the other hand, Pittsburgh,
the AFC's latest sacrificial lamb,
barely beat the Cinderella Colts 20-
16 in their conference champi
onship game. Sure, Indianapolis is
gritty and spunky, but comparing
the Colts to the Cowboys is like
comparing Mugsy Bogues to Anfer
nee Hardaway. One claws and
scraps. The other simply dominates.
And boy, will the Cowboys dom
inate. Not only will Dallas cover
the generous spread (final score
42-17), but the men wearing the
stars will put on an exhibition of
football supremacy like no other.
Offensively, there will be no
stopping or even containing Dal
las. Record-breaking running
back Fmmitt Smith will pile on
the yardage and touchdowns
behind the mammoth Cowboy
offensive line and tough-blocking
fullback "Moose" Johnston. Pitts
burgers, anyone?
While Sun Devil Stadium will
momentarily turn into the
Fmmitt Zone, let's not forget the
Cowboys' aerial assault either.
Big-time wide receiver Michael
Irvin broke out of his triple-cover

age-induced slump last weekend,
snaring seven catches for over
100 yards. After missing nearly
the entire season with a torn knee
ligament, Steeler All-Pro corner
back Rod Woodson wants to make
his return in the Super Bowl. For
Woodson's sake, I hope he
doesn't. After not seeing game
action for close to five months,
Woodson does not want to make

his comeback against football's
biggest playmaker in the biggest
game of the year.
If the Steelers decide to follow
the lead of many Cowboy oppo
nent's this season and roll triple
coverage onto Irvin, then speedy
wideout Kevin Williams and tight
end Jay Novacek will be ready to
pick up the slack. Williams has
come on strong the last month,
proving he's not just window
dressing on Dallas' masterpiece of
offensive efficiency. As for
Novacek, he'll just be his old secu
rity-blanket self, snagging crucial
third-down receptions and find
ing the opening in the end zone.
There's also a certain multi
nicknamed, multi-position player
on the Cowboy squad that might
make a few plays on the nation's
biggest stage. Just imagine how
much Deion Sanders is salivating,
trying to decide whether to tango,
waltz, cha-cha, tap or swing.
However, let's not forget who
will key this offensive odyssey:
America's quarterback, Troy Aik
man himself. Always one to rise to
playoff levels of performance, Aik
man will most assuredly raise his
play up another notch, as he has
done in the past, to Super Bowl
levels of performance.

No matter how tough, physical
or intense Pittsburgh's defense is,
it won't stand a chance against
the crushing hammer or slicing
scalpel of Dallas' offense. Unless
the Cowboys turn the ball over six
times, it'll be a long Sunday for
the Steeler "D."
On the defensive side of the
ball, the only threat Pittsburgh
poses is its brand of smash-mouth
rushing, especially against a Dal
las defense that displayed a soft
defensive belly the last few weeks
of the regular season. Since then,
however, with the return of tack
le Russell Maryland and middle
linebacker Robert Jones, the erst
while Cowboy tummy of flab on
defense has turned into abs of
steel.
There won't be a whole lot of
relief through the air either for
the Steelers. As much as Neil
O'Donnell would like to think,
beard or no beard, he's just a
mediocre quarterback. The Steel
er wideouts are interesting to
watch, but that's all they'll be
with Sanders and Larry Brown on
the corners. Nothing more.

Dallas should have
less trouble than
it did in its master
ful 38-27 NFC
Championship
victory over Green
Bay.

Oh yes, it will be an extrava
ganza to remember. But then
again, looking at all this, it won't
be very competitive. It won't be
all that exciting. It'll be another
soporific blowout of a Super Bowl
in which the ads will probably be
more anticipated than the next
Dallas touchdown.
That is, unless your a Cowboys
fan.
