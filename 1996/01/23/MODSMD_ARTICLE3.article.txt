# Burmese officials ban alumni group
## Request for meeting with pro-democracy leader causes permission to be revoked 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
The military junta which controls Burma,
also know as Myaninar, has blocked a group of
Stanford professors and alumni from entering
the country after learning of the group's inter
est in meeting with a pro-democracy leader.
The group, on a trip sponsored by the Stan
ford Alumni Association, had hoped to meet
with Aung San Suu Kyi, the winner of the 1991
Nobel Peace Prize, in the capital city of Ran
goon.
Suu Kyi had been under house arrest for six
years until the order was lifted this July. She

gave the keynote address at
this year's U.N. Conference
on Women's Rights in Beijing.
The visit to Burma was to
be part of a 28-day round-the
world tour by several profes
sors and alumni.
However, the group real
ized that their visit would be
unwelcome when government
officials revoked the group's
permits to land in Rangoon.

"We knew the trip would be controversial,'
said Annie Darrow, associate director of th<
Alumni Association and the tour's director

"but we were unprepared for this flat-out re
jection without documentation."
The group appealed to the government
through a letter sent last December, claiming
"their sole purpose of visiting Burma is to
enjoy the tourist sites." However, authorities
declined this appeal.
The Alumni Association's proposed trip to
Burma drew fire from some student activists,
who claimed that (lie visit supported SLORC,
the military regime currently in control of the
country.
In a letter to The Daily yesterday junior Nick


Thompson
Thompson, head of the Students
for Environmental Action at Stan
ford, criticized the Alumni Associa
tion for the trip: "Every time that
an alumni tour stops in Burma, it
is forced to give money directly and
indirectly to the SLORC by, for
example, staying in facilities built
by slave laborers subjugated by the
SLORC."
Organizers of the tour, how
ever, say the Alumni Association
has never avoided controversial
areas. "Putting your head in the
sand is not the correct
response," said Darrow. "We
shouldn't shy away from the

challenges and complexities."
Alumni Association President
Bill Stone cited the group's visits
to Vietnam and Cuba as examples
of this kind of learning.
"We're tackling more contro
versial areas," he said. "It's a new
kind of education."
The lack of written documen
tation regarding the denied land
ing permits prevented the Alumni
Association from making a formal
complaint to the State Depart
ment, according to Duncan
Beardsley, the director of the
Alumni Association's travel-study
office.
The Alumni Association
departed Jim. 19 for its 28-day
world tour, substituting a trip to
Cambodia for the planned visit to
Burma.
