# Burmese officials ban alumni group
## Request for meeting with pro-democracy leader causes permission to be revoked 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
The military junta which controls Burma,
also know as Myaninar, has blocked a group of
Stanford professors and alumni from entering
the country after learning of the group's inter
est in meeting with a pro-democracy leader.
The group, on a trip sponsored by the Stan
ford Alumni Association, had hoped to meet
with Aung San Suu Kyi, the winner of the 1991
Nobel Peace Prize, in the capital city of Ran
goon.
Suu Kyi had been under house arrest for six
years until the order was lifted this July. She

gave the keynote address at
this year's U.N. Conference
on Women's Rights in Beijing.
The visit to Burma was to
be part of a 28-day round-the
world tour by several profes
sors and alumni.
However, the group real
ized that their visit would be
unwelcome when government
officials revoked the group's
permits to land in Rangoon.

"We knew the trip would be controversial,'
said Annie Darrow, associate director of th<
Alumni Association and the tour's director

"but we were unprepared for this flat-out re
jection without documentation."
The group appealed to the government
through a letter sent last December, claiming
"their sole purpose of visiting Burma is to
enjoy the tourist sites." However, authorities
declined this appeal.
The Alumni Association's proposed trip to
Burma drew fire from some student activists,
who claimed that (lie visit supported SLORC,
the military regime currently in control of the
country.
