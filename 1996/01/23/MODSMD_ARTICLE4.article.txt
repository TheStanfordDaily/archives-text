# Many disabled face problems with healthcare
## Jensen case shows common problem 
### Libusha Kelly Contributing writer 
The decision to place Sandra
Jensen on the waiting list for an
organ transplant should have
been obvious, according to staff
members who work with the dis
abled.
Jensen, a 35-year-old woman
with Down syndrome, was reject
ed from consideration for a heart
lung transplant last year by both
the Stanford Medical Center and
UC-San Diego because of her con
dition. Last Thursday, the Stan
ford Medical Center announced
that it had reconsidered Jensen's
case, and is committed to perform
ing the transplant as soon as a
donor becomes available.
Nancy Deason, assistant dean
of students and director of the Dis
ability Resource Center at Stan
ford, was surprised by the decision
to deny Jensen a place on the wait
ing list. "Why would there be any

question in the first place? She's a
human being. It was definitely un
fair. The medical community is
making decisions about quality of
life: what kind of life should (the
disabled) live, and in a case like
this, should they live at all," she
said.
Unequal medical treatment is a
controversial issue in the disabled
community. "Everybody who is
disabled has a different opinion,"
said Kimberly Thompson, a mem
ber of the Disability Staff Forum
at Stanford.
Some disabled people feel that
they are discriminated against
even in situations which are not
life-threatening, Deason said.
"Many people with disabilities
feel that they get treated differ
ently by the medical community,"
she said. "Like when they go in to
see a doctor, the first thing the
doctor sees is their wheelchair
when all they may have is a cold."
This insensitivity is especially
troubling when doctors are placed
in a position to recommend or
deny care that may be crucial to
survival. "Having other people
make decisions about their quali
ty of life is something that dis
abled people struggle with," Dea
son said. "They are often denied
equal access and treatment."
The Medical Center is keeping

information surrounding its
reconsideration of Jensen's case
quiet. "To say anything meaning
ful about her case would be to
break patient-physician confiden
tiality," said Don Gibbons, direc
tor of the Medical Center Office of
Communications.
About 70 heart-lung trans
plants are performed in the Unit
ed States each year, although
there are approximately 200 peo
ple on a waiting list for organs.
Because Jensen was put on the
list a year later than she original
ly hoped, her treatment will be
delayed far longer than it might

have been.
Dr. James Theodore, Jensen's
physician, summed up the contro
versy surrounding her case with
the observation that decisions
regarding patient competency
must be made on an individual
basis. "It's a complicated and
emotional issue," said Thomas.
He said one reason for the lack of
information released was for the
good of Jensen herself, and her
acceptance to the wait list is only
the beginning.
"She is still faced with the
arduous task of getting ready for
an enormous operation," he said.
