# Glitch sends FD the wrong signals
## 
### September Trevi√±o Staff writer 
J The University's automated
fire detection system experienced
technical difficulties earlier this
month when the dispatch center's
scanner scrambled fire alarm sig
nals, reporting incorrect address
es and forcing delayed responses
from fire crews.
University Fire Marshal
Joseph Leung said that while he is
uncertain what exactly caused the
malfunction, the problem was
fixed within 24 hours of detection.
Although the reporting glitch
could have potentially affected
about half of the buildings on cam
pus, Leung said safety was never
compromised.
"The mix-up did not affect the
fire alarm system protecting each
building. Fire alarms still went off
and people were still evacuated,"
said Leung. "The only problem

was the reporting of the alarm to
the fire department."
The scanner typically reports
the location of the fire, its address
and where in the building the
alarm was tripped. When the scan
ner was down, it confused report
ing signals and relayed bogus in
formation.
The first problematic incident
occurred Jan. 7 at about 11 p.m.
The scanner incorrectly reported
a fire alarm at the Sunken Dia
mond when one had actually gone
off at the Carnegie Institution on
the opposite side of campus. The
mix-up caused delays, and fire
crews arrived on the scene only
after someone called in the
alarm.
Regardless, Leung recom
mends self-reporting even under
nor m a 1 c i rc u m stances.
"Calling the (ire department is
always a good backup measure,"
he said. "That way, the dispatcher
definitely knows it's not a false
alarm and can pinpoint exactly
what the problem is."
After a facilities administrator
notified him of the reporting errors,
lining sent a mass e-mail message
Jan. 10 urging building occupants
to call in fire emergencies.
The problem was fixed by Jan.
11, Leung said.
