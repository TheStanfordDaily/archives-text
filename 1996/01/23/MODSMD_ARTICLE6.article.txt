# Student lauded for finding bone marrow donors
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Although none of the bone marrow typed during
two drives at Stanford last year matched that needed
by junior Evan Chen, organizer Yul Kwon has been re
warded for his tireless efforts.
Not only have at least 20 other people been
matched to potential bone marrow donors because of
the drive, but Kwon has been named Volunteer of the
Year by the Asian American Donor Program.
Kwon, who was Chen's roommate at the time,
helped register more than 1,000 people in two drives
on the Stanford campus last spring, allowing the
Asian American Donor Program to sign up more than
6,000 people in 1995.
The drives were organized to help save Chen, who
suffers from leukemia. Despite the large number of
Asians registered on campus, the only two matching
donors for Chen came from Taiwan.
"I kind of felt like this was a wasted effort," Kwon
said, "and it didn't make a difference for him or any
one else."
But in the months after the drives, Kwon found out
that his labors had benefited others. The award, he
said, is "an honor, of course."
Karen Seth, recruitment and education director
for the Asian American Donor Program, said Kwon
was chosen because of the unusually large number of
people he was able to register and the large core of vol-
unteers he coordinated to get the
results.
"We'll look at each volunteer and
how many hours he contributed,
how many donors were actually
recruited," Seth said. Kwon is the
third winner of the annual Volun
teer of the Year award since its
inception three years ago.

"Yul's | work 1 was especially
exceptional because of the number
of donors he recruited and all the
different volunteers he motivated,"
Seth said.
Kwon w;ls quick to deflect praise
onto the people who were typed and
helped coordinate the drives.
"I'm really surprised and really
honored," he said. "But I think
something like this should probably
go to people who volunteered out of
their own initiative.
"For me, to have gotten involved

with bone marrow drives was easy
in a sense because it was affecting
someone who was very much part of
my life. It was easy to get concerned
and do something."
Donors didn't need to know
Chen to get involved, Kwon said.
The donor program presented
Kwon the award at a holiday party
in December. His selflessness in
accepting the honor impressed
Seth.
"It's hard to put into words the
kind of person Yul is," Seth said.

"He just fills your heart with so
much appreciation and thankful
ness. He's a very, very bright and
energetic and resourceful young
man."
Marrow typing drives are espe
cially important in minority com
munities. The chances of a person of
Chinese ancestry finding a compati
ble match are one in 20,000 because
so few Asians are registered.
Chen is currently recovering
from his bone marrow transplant,
performed in October.
