# COMICS IN COMBAT
## Cartoon Stanford alum helps to explain Bosnian war 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
Stanford grad Tracy Kulich is dig
ging in the trenches alongside U.S.
troops in Bosnia. But instead of a
gun, she is using her camera to shoot
photos for USA News.
She's smart, sexy, speaks Serbo-
Croatian and is the star reporter of
the comic strip "Tracy Kulich: As
signment Bosnia."
Cartoonist Joe Barcelone, in col
laboration with writers Melissa
Milich and Greg Voss, designed
Kulich's character in the hopes of ed
ucating the American public about
the Bosnian civil war.
Barcelone, also creator of the
"Desert Storm Comics," approached
Arlene Hudson, advertising manager
of the Gilroy Dispatch, with the idea
for a strip about the war in Bosnia.
"I wanted to do a publication with
meaning," Barcelone said. "I wanted
to entertain as well as educate."
Gavilan, the company which pub
lishes the Dispatch, invited creative

partners Milich and Voss to work on
the comic strip.
Voss, a believer in the power of
using the visual for communication,
and Milich, of Serbo-Croatian de
scent and long interested in the civil
war, both enthusiastically agreed to
join the project.
Milich has a personal stake in the
comic strip.
