# COMICS IN COMBAT
## Cartoon Stanford alum helps to explain Bosnian war 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
Stanford grad Tracy Kulich is dig
ging in the trenches alongside U.S.
troops in Bosnia. But instead of a
gun, she is using her camera to shoot
photos for USA News.
She's smart, sexy, speaks Serbo-
Croatian and is the star reporter of
the comic strip "Tracy Kulich: As
signment Bosnia."
Cartoonist Joe Barcelone, in col
laboration with writers Melissa
Milich and Greg Voss, designed
Kulich's character in the hopes of ed
ucating the American public about
the Bosnian civil war.
Barcelone, also creator of the
"Desert Storm Comics," approached
Arlene Hudson, advertising manager
of the Gilroy Dispatch, with the idea
for a strip about the war in Bosnia.
"I wanted to do a publication with
meaning," Barcelone said. "I wanted
to entertain as well as educate."
Gavilan, the company which pub
lishes the Dispatch, invited creative

partners Milich and Voss to work on
the comic strip.
Voss, a believer in the power of
using the visual for communication,
and Milich, of Serbo-Croatian de
scent and long interested in the civil
war, both enthusiastically agreed to
join the project.
Milich has a personal stake in the
comic strip.

the news didn't care about that
edge of the world," Milich said.
"People ask why, with the budget
crisis, the U.S. is sending troops to
Bosnia. The strip answers those
questions."
Barcelone explained how he
drew an initial sketch of Kulich. "I
was sitting in a coffeehouse. I drew
the waitress and added a bit of
Candace Bergen, Cindy Crawford
and Geena Davis."
In creating Tracy's character,
the collaborators knew that she
came from a high-tech capital, had
relatives in Bosnia, and was a mod
ern liberal with an old-fashioned
faith in humanity, Voss said.
Milich said Stanford University
was the natural place for Tracy to
earn her degree in international
relations. "Summa cum laude,"
she added. None of the comic's cre
ators attended Stanford.
Though Barcelone originally
envisioned Kulich as a solider, the
three collaborators realized that a
reporter would have more freedom
to search for the truth.
"Kulich knows how to get the
news," Barcelone said. "She won't
be manipulated by the military."
Barcelone revealed an upcom
ing plot in which Kulich goes
north, behind the lines, to look for
the 8,000 bodies buried in the
mines.
Besides showing the horror of
the war, the strip aims to show the

tremendous resilience and sense of
humor of the Bosnians, Milich
said.
"That's how Croatians can sur
vive, by finding something to laugh
about," Milich said. "We want to
show the human spirit through
the tragedy."
Voss cited an example of how
Sarajevans continued to produce a
full theatrical production of the
musical "Hair" during the war,
stopping only after they ran out of
gasoline for the generators. "The
actors walked through sniper fire,"
he said.
The three of them work on the
strip in a place they've dubbed the
"War Room."
"There's lots of yelling and
screaming," Barcelone laughed.
"It's been inspiring and challeng
ing for me."
Milich added, "We try to bring
into words and pictures what is
unspeakable. It's exhausting and
exhilarating. I go home and col
lapse."
They are also working on a
longer version of the comic strip
for a book, with more complex,
extended versions. Twenty thou
sand copies of the publication are
being sent to troops in Bosnia on
Feb. 14. Copies will be available to
the public soon after, Barcelone
said.
A portion of the proceeds will go
to Bosnian relief organizations.
"We have such long days work
ing. The hope that I'm helping a
school [reopen] or a hospital buy
supplies keeps me going," Milich
said.
