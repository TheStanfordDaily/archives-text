The Robert Hofstadter Memorial Lectures
January 29 and 30, 1996
These lectures are free and open to the public.
Call (415) 723-4347 for more info.
Invited Speaker: Professor Britton Chance
Public Lecture: Monday, January 29, 1996
at 8:00 PM in the Bloch Auditorium
(Physics Lecture Hall, Room 100)
"NON-INVASIVE APPROACHES TO MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY"
The manifold developments of non-invasive imaging using penetrating X-irradiation are
now nicely complemented by low energy perturbations: ultrasound, MRI and, most
recently, diffusive wave optical tomography using light in the near-infrared region. This
technique is based on the well-known equations for thermal and photon diffusions and
affords sensitive localization and approximate imaging of brain bleeds, stroke volumes and
tumors of breast and brain.
Afternoon Colloquium: Tuesday, January 30, 1996
at 4:00 PM in Physics 101
"PHOTON DIFFUSION IN TISSUE SPECTROSCOPY AND IMAGING"
The biomedical applications of photon diffusive waves to important clinical problems
involve diffusion theory, experimental time and frequency domain apparatuses, and novel
amplitude/phase cancellation electronics that give picamole and millimeter detectability
and single object location deep within highly scattering objects such as breast and brain.
Britton Chance
Professor Chance is an internationally known expert in bioenergetics, a field in which he
has made many key advances, using and developing new biophysical methods. He was one
of the pioneers in the use of NMR in biological systems. In recent years he has studied the
cerebral metabolism of newborns and infants by transillumination of the head by light
beams in the near-infrared. Prof. Chance is the recipient of numerous awards, including
the National Medal of Science (1974), the gold medal of the Society of Magnetic
Resonance in Medicine (1988) and the Benjamin Franklin medal of the American
Philosophical Society (1990).
