We're looking for people who
look at this glass and say:
"There's gotta be other
glasses of water."
We need people capable of going
beyond half full or half-empty
thinking. People who see
subtleties Who are quite frankly
bored by easy answers and off
the shelf solutions.
People who are constantly
challenging their own thinking
and are thirsty for new ideas
and knowledge.
You'll have a degree from a
top school. Getting a job won't
really be an issue. The question
is: which job? Which industry''
You don't want to get locked
into one area and then discover
three to five years from now that
you don't like it. By then you've
invested too much.
Andersen Consulting offers
you the chance to work on a
variety of projects—with clients
In a wide range of industries.
