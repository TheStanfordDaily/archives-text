GOP split on plan to avoid shutdown
WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans rallied yesterday
behind a plan to avert a new federal shutdown this weekend, but
insisted on tacking on abortion restrictions that Senate GOP leaders
were refusing to accept.
Staring at a new round of partial agency closures Saturday unless
action is taken, the unpredictable House GOP rank-and-file signaled
its support for a leadership proposal to finance programs through
March 1. Though the measure would not target any of President
Clinton's top priorities, it would reflect the Republican budget-cut
ting ideology by eliminating a dozen minor programs and reining
spending on most agencies.
"1 want to see progress toward a balanced budget," said freshman
Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., expressing a sentiment many of his col
leagues share. "Anything that's not progress toward a balanced bud
get, I'm opposed to."
The decision reflects a desire to avoid a third confrontation with
Clinton over shuttering federal agencies, which have previously cost
Republicans public support. With their budget-balancing talks with
Clinton all but dead, it also illustrates an effort by the GOP to avoid
a do-nothing Congress label bv trying to enact pieces of their budget
agenda one at a time.
Democrats did their best to stoke public dissatisfaction with
Republicans over past shutdowns and their festering confrontation
with the administration over averting a jolting government default.
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters that
letting government agencies close was "playing with matches. If we
fail to deal with the debt limit, we're playing with dynamite."
Leaders of both chambers were hoping for passage as early as
tomorrow of legislation heading off a shutdown, but failed to agree
to a compromise when they clashed over one provision.
According to participants, House Republicans were demanding
language blocking U.S. aid for overseas abortion programs until
Congress authorizes such spending in separate legislation — an
event considered unlikely. The more moderate Senate GOP was
resisting. The two sides planned to meet again today.
The deadlock underlined the power anti-abortion forces wield in
the House, and the Senate's stronger abortion-rights views. If
authorized, the government envisions spending less than $400 mil
lion for international abortion programs over the next two years.
France's chefs losing their touch?
PARIS (AP) — Some of France's top chefs are suffering a major
case of heartburn.
The 1996 GaultMillau food guide is out, and it boasts a new,
tougher rating system designed to weed out what it calls overpriced
mediocrity. Some long-established restaurants have been taken
down a few notches.
Second in influence only to the red Michelin guide, the GaultMil
lau rates 8,000 restaurants and hotels on a scale of 1-19. It also
awards one to four "toques" — the tall white hats chefs wear — for
"exceptional tables," those restaurants scoring 13 or more.
In the 1995 guide, 30 restaurants earned the top rating of 19
points and four toques. But this year, only 12 made the grade.
