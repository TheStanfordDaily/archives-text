# Clinton proclaims union 'strong'

WASHINGTON (AP) - Deliv
ering his State of the Union
address to a skeptical Republican
Congress, President Clinton con
fronted the GOP on the budget,
demanding they "never — ever"
shut the government again.
Democrats rose with loud
cheers but Republicans sat in stony
silence at Clinton's challenge. GOP
lawmakers —- particularly the
rebellious House freshmen — had
been coached by party elders to be
on good behavior and not boo Clin
ton, as some did last year.
The speech was brief by Clinton
standards, 61 minutes by one
count, 62 by another. Either way,
less than last year's record 81-
minute marathon.
Senate Majority Leader Hob
Dole — front-runner for the GOP
presidential nomination — made
the Republican response, outlining
differences with Clinton and
assailing the president as "the
chief obstacle to a balanced bud
get." He called the president "the
rearguard of the welfare state."
Dole said Clinton was "careen
ing dangerously off course" in wel
fare, education, Medicare and
taxes. "We will challenge Presi
dent Clinton again and again to
walk the t<ilk he talks so well,"
Dole vowed.
Clinton proposed several new
initiatives, among them $1,000
college scholarships for the top 5
percent of graduates from every
high school, and turning the FBI
loose on youth gangs.
With Republicans controlling
the Congress, Clinton's proposals
are unlikely to see the light of day,
especially in an election year.
The House chamber overflowed
with Senate and House members,
Clinton's Cabinet, the Supreme
Court justices in their black robes
and ambassadors from around the
world. House Speaker Newt Gin
grich, Clinton's yearlong nemesis,
sat immediately behind the presi
dent, applauding politely on some
occasions, and sitting in stern
silence when the president criti

cized Congress.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. said
he thought Clinton delivered a
"cheap shot" by having a hero
from the Oklahoma City bombing
stand up by way of setting up his
remark "about how we are shut
ting down the government."
First lady Hillary Rodham Clin
ton, listening along with her GOP
Whitewater critics, was applauded
as she entered with her 15-year
old daughter, Chelsea, who was
making her first State of the
Union appearance. The president
introduced the beleaguered Mrs.
Clinton as a "wonderful wife, a
magnificent mother and a great
first lady," and Chelsea led a
standing ovation of Democrats and
Republicans alike.
"The era of big government is
over," Clinton said, twice, as if to
capture a campaign slogan. Repub
licans liked that, and answered
with applause. Democrats hailed
Clinton's next sentence: "But we
cannot go back to the time when
our citizens were left to fend for
themselves."
Clinton began his remarks
expressing pride in U.S. peace
keepers in Bosnia.
He said the state of the union
was "strong" and cited economic
and falling crime rates to make the
case. In all, Clinton was interrupt
ed 78 times by applause.
With tempers rubbed raw by
months of battle, Republicans have
accused Clinton of standing in the
way of balancing the budget, cut
ting taxes and reforming welfare.
Clinton's speech provided a
clear counterpoint to the Republi
can agenda. He challenged their
stands on welfare reform, tax cuts,
the minimum wage, health insur
ance, Medicare and Medicaid, envi
ronmental cleanup, crime-fighting
and foreign policy.
The budget crisis loomed
paramount over the House cham
ber. The next budget deadline
comes at midnight Friday with the
expiration of a temporary spend
ing measure that has kept much of

the government open.
"I am convinced we will balance
the budget," Clinton said, adding,
"Now is the time to finish the job."
He said both sides should lock in
agreed-upon budget savings and
continue negotiating the differ
ences.
Clinton said they shouldn't stop
there. "On behalf of all Americans,
I challenge Congress to preserve
the full faith and credit of the
United States, to honor our obliga
tions as we have for 220 years, to

rise above partisanship and pass a
straightforward extension of the
debt limit."
On other sensitive points, Clin
ton urged Congress to enact a wel
fare reform plan, replacing the
Republican version he vetoed, and
to increase the minimum wage,
which the GOP has opposed. He
also urged a tax cut for working
families, failing to acknowledge
the Republicans own tax-cut plan
that was part of the GOP budget
that Clinton vetoed.
