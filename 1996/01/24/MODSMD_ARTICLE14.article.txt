## Editorials Wrong roommate 
### 
Conflicts often result
from misunderstandings.
This can be particularly true
of roommates who are randomly
assigned and have little or nothing
in common, making it difficult to
communicate their behavioral
preferences.
The task of finding compatible
roommates is particularly difficult
at the beginning of the winter and
spring quarters. During the
autumn draw, even if students are
separated from their draw groups
or get into a dorm by themselves,
they will at least have the opportu
nity to choose their roommates.
Currently, wait-listed applicants
are given space on a priority sys
tem. However, people often pick by
location. This can have conse
quences later, as the current occu
pant of the room and the new
roommate have no idea what the
other is like.

One solution for a smoother
transition might be to allow
greater disclosure of roommate
expectations beforehand by having
the current room occupant(s) and
incoming roommates submit a
behavior preference card detailing
the characteristics each would
most like in a new roommate.
This strategy could be incorpo
rated into the current walk-on and
wait list procedures. During the
winter and spring walk-on draw,
students on the wait list could be
informed of the behavioral prefer
ences of current occupants so they
don't just blindly pick housing
assignments on the basis of loca
tion. Such disclosure would reduce
some of the new, unknown room
mate nervousness, lessen chances of
conflict and show that administra
tors are making an effort to match
both people up rather than simply
leaving the matter up to chance.
