# Expand student TV
## 
### 
WHILE THE university
has devilishly created an
on-campus television
monopoly, charging students even
for access to basic network chan
nels, all is not lost. Thanks to the
ASSU, students who refuse to buy
cable and are bored with public
TV stations and SITN broadcasts
can watch free movies on Stan
ford Cable Broadcast Network.
Instead of running to a video store
op paying (or h premium cable chan
nel, students can simply tune in to
SUNET channel 5. The project, enti
tled Tele Flicks, shows movies Mon
day-Saturday at 11 p.m. Targeting
students with children (or just the
kid in all of us), it also runs movies
geared towards younger audiences
(like "The Lion King" and "Pete's
Dragon") every Monday at 6 p.m.
As the driving force behind this
new venture, the ASSU Business
Office should be congratulated for
loaning SCBN money for the nec
essary equipment and paying for
the movies.

Besides earning the gratitude of
students, Tele Flicks has had a sec
ond positive result — it has great
ly increased the audience of Stan
ford's student television station.
However, while SCBN is riding
high right now, there is still room
for improvement and growth.
Granted, SCBN does not have a lot
of high-tech equipment and capa
bilities, but it should do the best it
can with what it has.
For example, last spring, there
was talk of broadcasting ASSU
Senate meetings and other campus
events. SCBN should also focus its
efforts on recording and re-broad
casting off-campus speakers spon
sored by groups like the Speakers
Bureau (which had to turn away
many students after it sold out the
Alice Walker speech).
While the station is no doubt
resting its hopes on the spring
election and its special fee, there
are still steps it can and should
take right now to play a greater
role in student lives.
