## To be, or not to be...

UNLIKE A LADY who used this
student newspaper to announce
knowledge of four languages in
unveiled self-acclaim, I will quote a line
from Camus I have read only in English:
"There is only one true philosophical
problem, and that is suicide. There is but
one truly philosophical problem, and that
is suicide."
It seems that many highly-contempla
tive thinkers have developed similar atti
tudes — not that suicide is necessarily
the most profound philosophical prob
lem, but a serious objective of contempla
tion. I read in Harper's a few months ago
about how three French philosophers
had recently committed suicide because
they felt their life's work had been done
and they had no more to offer. This is
similar to the analysis a friend told me
about why Hemingway died — as a dete
riorating 62-year-old man, he saw all
about him that he valued lessening and
disappearing.
What do Virginia Woolf and Kurt
Cobain have in common with each other
but not with you? They both killed them
selves after struggling to diminish exter
nal pressures that stifled their need for
self-expression. Using succinct and
poignant artistic methods, Woolf and
Cobain were able to reveal the outlying
societal norms which, when unconscious
ly, subconsciously or consciously created,
were discretely obscured.
Woolf showed how the developmental
possibilities of a bright young woman

early in this century (and in earlier ones)
were the same ones open to a dull
woman. Cobain signified the bind that
modern low-class latchkey kids are stuck
in. They can enter the army (see below),
work as a crank mechanic or pursue any
thing else that fits the stereotype. What
happens if they don't go to Boys State?
Sure they can't still be president like our
current hillbilly who grew up among
empty Old Turkey bottles. 1 don't know
why these two people killed themselves,
but I would guess it's because it took
such hard work to push through the
innumerable boundaries the rest of the
world puts up so that they will be unable
to have their own room or show what
non-90210, teenage / adolescent, working
class life can smell like.
Or what happens when a poor kid feels
that he must play the guitar, but his sin
gle father refuses. If he's sincere and per
sistent enough, he may get a guitar
it'll be a real piece though. The music
that comes out may be more endearing
than that made by any cocktail pianist at
Max's Opera Cafe. I believe it's hap
pened.
But what if that happens to someone
. . . black. That brings even more obsta
cles. No one in the early '60s wanted a
gangly, acne-faced, mostly black, partly
Indian to become an icon for young
American music lovers. No one would
think that a huge concert would be
played in Harlem, or planned in Pago
Pago, American Samoa (an event with a

younger Rev. Jesse Jackson intervened
— Jimi Hendrix's death).
Even while he was popular, Hendrix
was confined from musically exploring
what he chose by raving white fans who
wanted to see a colored person pretend to
play guitar. Even though he had
emerged from his trail circuit of playing
rhythm guitar for white performers in
the South, he still had limits on what he
could do.
But what are you going to do? Are you
going to live at the Bridge to look fine on
a med school application or connect with
a peer who needs genuine help (which I
sincerely believe cannot be found at the
Bridge). Eat fatty prime rib so you can
take a two-hour lunch break from
Microsoft for a bike ride? Eat prime rib
at lunch and then try to sweat it off in
the sauna? If you don't know what you'll
become, read "Cream of the Crop," a
book about Stanford grads 10 years
after graduation (by the sex doctor).
Hey, join politics so you can write Clin
ton's speech for the dead Texas Con
gresswoman with whom he had no
attachment.
Might as well write pretentious mem
oirs about Paris — it seems like a better
alternative to me.

Look upwards to find your ground
