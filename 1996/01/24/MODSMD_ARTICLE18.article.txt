University can go too far in pursuing LGB goals

WHILE IT IS proper to adopt the
global goals of making Stanford
open, receptive and welcoming
to the lesbian / gay / bisexual community
so that students, to quote the Jan. 22
issue of The Daily, "are free to study,
work and socialize without fear of
harassment or discrimination," it's
another thing to pursue these goals in
the basically irrelevant ways advocated
by the Working Group on Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Student Needs.
Threats and intimidation have no
place on campus, but asking that the
University "provide academic role mod

els" for lesbian, gay and bisexual stu
dents seems a rather unpromising way
of preventing these outbursts. Nor does
integrating lesbian, gay and bisexual
scholarship and issues into existing
courses, or adding an area studies pro
gram, appear to be significantly useful
or necessary measures if the goal is sim
ply to permit lesbian, gay and bisexual
students to live and work at Stanford as
freely as other students.
And there needs to be a better argu
ment in favor of hiring a full-time direc
tor for the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center than the fact that

other communities have such directors.
Different student sub-communities at
Stanford have different needs and legiti
mate concerns, and if the lesbian, gay
and bisexual students can live free of
unfair discrimination without such a
director (or if expending the funds to
hire a director would not substantially
advance the basic goal), then they
should do without one and should not
react with claims of "marginalization."
Stanford has done a great deal that
was called for in treating lesbian, gay
and bisexual students like equal mem
bers of the community. As long as big-

otry and discrimination continue, there
may be more left for the University to do
(though we ought to recognize that
there is a limit to what the administra
tion can do to change attitudes and that
some efforts in this direction are likely
to have more harmful consequences
than good ones). While lesbian, gay and
bisexual students have some legitimate
grievances, not every grievance they
express need be accepted as legitimate.
Those that seek unwarranted special
treatment ought to be rejected.
