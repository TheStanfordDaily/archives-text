# Casper speaks on Honor Code reform
## President says process is 'cumbersome' 
### Sara Southern Contributing writer 
In a formal
statement
made during
last night's
ASSU meeting,
University
President Ger
hard Casper
declared an
"urgent" need

to review the University's legisla
tive and judicial charter.
The charter, composed of the
rules governing student conduct,
dates hack to 1968 and includes ju
dicial procedure for Honor Code
and Fundamental Standard viola

tions. Casper announced yester
day his intention to convene the
Committee of 15, which is written
into the charter as the only body
recognized to modify the judicial
system.
Casper said the judicial process
for such violations is currently
"highly bureaucratic and procedu
rally cumbersome." He cited two
reasons for modifying the current
system — the lengthy time frame
from the initial reporting of a vio
lation to its final resolution, and
the fact that students violating the
code usually choose a route which
bypasses peer involvement.
A student charged with violating

the Honor Code or the Fundamen
tal Standard can choose what
Casper called "the dean's route" or
the "student route."
The former involves a meeting
with the dean of students, in which
the charged student admits fjuilt,
describes mitigating circumstances
and awaits the dean's recommen
dation for punitive action to either
the provost (for Honor Code viola
tions) or the vice provost and dean
of student affairs (for Fundamental
Standard violations).
Dean of Students Mark Wais
said such recommendations are
"based on the nature of the viola
tion."
The second option is one in
which a charged student may argue
guilt or innocence before the Stan
ford Judicial Council, composed of
four students and four faculty.
Casper drew a parallel bet ween
choosing the dean's route and the
plea-bargaining which occurs in the
public sector. He hastened to add
that a disproportionate amount of
students choose this route.
"It is vital that we increase stu
dent involvement in the judicial
process," Casper said.
The Committee of 15 is com
posed of six members of the aca
demic council, three staff members
who are appointed bv the president,
and six students chosen by the
ASSU Nominations Commission.
The last time the charter was
amended was in 1981, and any new
changes made in the charter must
1k i passed by the president, the aca

demic council and the ASSU.
When asked how long the
amendment process would take,
Casper said ideally the new system
will be in effect next year, although
he added that he was "skeptical as
to whether that's really do-able."
"The impetus for reviewing the
charter is to make it a quicker pro
cess and a less bureaucratic one,"
Casper said. "I'm asking for stu
dent support of the changes made,
ones I believe are vital for improv
ing the current system."
Following Casper's address, sen
ator Andre Vanier asked Casper if
he planned to make any provisions
for "extenuating circumstances"
involving students who withdraw
from a class. Casper replied with a
definite "no," adding that "the W is
not punitive in any way and is
meant only to indicate that a stu
dent withdrew, for whatever rea
son."
In other ASSU business, the
senate approved several appoint
ments and announced various
upcoming deadlines. Juniors Lisa
Corrigan and Jeffrey Giesea were
appointed to the Cultures, Ideas
and Values Commission as student
representatives.
The hearings officer position,
which involves overseeing the elec
tion and ensuring candidates follow
regulations for the 1996 elections,
was granted to Solomon Ix-fler.
Deadlines were also announced
concerning special fee refunds and
the Nominations Commission
chair. Students interesting in hav
ing fees refunded must do so by this
Friday at 5 p.m., and those inter
ested in the Nom Comm position
must submit their application
today by 5 p.m.
