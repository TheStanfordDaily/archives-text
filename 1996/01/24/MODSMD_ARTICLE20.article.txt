## The
						gestalt of Serta: a true confession 
### 
Trying to decide what to do with the
rest of one's life requires a fair
amount of soul-searching. Along that
route, sometimes, one learns a few disturb
ing details about one's inner being.
I was deep into a meeting with Ambition,
Romance and Greed when a potentially
awful truth about myself became apparent.
This was it:
My life's goal is to stay in bed.
It's true. I'd never leave unless I had to.
I'd stay in my flannel womb where it's
warm and happy and I'd never leave. Ever.
Don't ask me why — it's simply my
nature. I know this about myself now: All
that I do, I do so I can stay in bed, or at least
return there. Unless compelled to leave, I
don't. I am happiest nestled in my blanket;
I am the sultan of sloth.
It doesn't even matter what I'm doing.
I testing, reading, testing my television pow
ers — they're only good if I've got my butt
on a mattress. For, like the fungi and the
algae comprising lichen, like the pragma
tism and ignorance that make bureaucracy,
my bed and I bind together to make a larger
thing.
It's not even so much a matter of sleep
(though that's certainly a large portion).
Even if I take my 10 hours a night I still
don't want to get up and out of lx>d. I like it

there. It is my chrysalis in which I can avoid
change. It is where I belong.
Honestly, the only reason I do leave bed
at all is to go do whatever needs to get done
so that I can get right back in. I'd never
move if I didn't have to eat or pee.
But the problem is, of course, that I do.
Certain needs — physical or otherwise —
demand the occasional separation from the
futonic love. And only by placating those
needs can I return.
Perhaps you've experienced this too:
You 're lazing about, cozily bunked, when
suddenly you feel a pain in your stomach.
It's hunger — you've felt this before. Now
your bed bliss is disturbed, and you know
that you will not be able to fully enjoy that
time until the desire for food is appeased. So
you go to the kitchen, toast a Ixigel, slather
on some cream cheese, grab a Coke, carry it
back 1 if eating in Ix'd is your custom) and all
is well once again.
Hut, unfortunately, such urges are not
always easily sated. Food, after all, must be
acquired. At times, one is forced to go
beyond the kitchen to gain sustenance.
Restaurants, dining rooms, Safeway — yes,
travel is occasionally required before the
resolved return is possible.
And let's not forget that the means to
purchase the essential foodstuffs necessary

to remain blithely bedded are not always
available. This lack of funds can severely
disrupt the l)ed process. Which is why I now
fear that I will one day take a job solely to
support my bod habit (even though regular
employment will make the precious incuba
tion even less frequent).
Even more insidious than all that, how
ever, are the internal, psychic urges which
force one to leave bed. For myself, the need
to write often pulls me out of an otherwise
perfect repose. Strangely, I can ignore most
other responsibilities — classes, fire drills,
infections — but this one will not let me
rest. And so I get up, scribble what needs to
be scribbled, polish it until the impulse
dwindles and return to the sanctity of my
egg-foamed futon.
Now take, for example, t he need for com
panionship: You're in bed, but you feel lone
ly. It happens. So you call up a friend ami
ask her to come over. She says she can't but
she would like to meet you at the Coffee
House in an hour or so. You agree. You go.
You talk. You feel Ix'tter. You go home and
curl back into bed, solemnity restored
Unfortunately, things don't stay that
simple. For things become rather complicat
ed once one is challenged by the recurring
need for intimacy and or sex. After all, sex
is an activity that often takes place in I**l

to engage in it (without risking rug burns)
one must allow another individual into that
highly personal realm, risking great imbal
imce to this already delicate process.
Hut still, you are compelled to bring her
(sorry, I hate that gender neutral crap) in
and hope for the best. If things don't work
out, at least the nook helps you rest easy for
the a short while.
Hut if things do mesh nicely and you do
begin to like that new one enough, two odd
feelings may arise: a) You find you want to
share your time in bed with her; and, worse,
b) You find that you cannot enjoy your own
time in bed without her. (Ironically, you're
probably in bed alone wondering why you
aren't happv in bed alone when you realize
all this.)
And so you drag yourself out mid you go
find her again and you do and say whatever
must be said and done to get her to come
back to Ixkl with you (and to please bring an
extra pillow along).
Hut now comes the hard part. Hecause
when you invite someone to share your bed,
you become obliged to teach that person
your entire bed system, learn theirs, and,
perhaps, compromise between the two. (For
example, I am a shoes-bad, food-okay, two
pillows, light-blanket bedder, while my
hoochie is more of a shoes-fine, food-fine,

tpillows no!, heavy-blanket type. Not impos
sible to work with, but it took gobs of time to
rework the routine.)
Now if things go well, bedtime is notably
improved. But if all goes awry, that bounti
ful beauty of bed, the calming comforts of
the comforter, are lost.
And then you have no one but yourself to
blame because this outside being that you
brought in to soothe your sleepy state actu
ally went and made it worse.
All this trouble, till this risk, just to get
back to bed.
I suppose I should be emb.irrassed that I
have such an elaborate cosmology sur
rounding my metaphorical bed. (Remem
ber, it's not just the actual bed that matters
- the physical bed is an enabler. Rather,
bed is a conceptual state that extends
beyond my queen-sized pine futon into my
mahogany twin in NY, my hoochie's
clamshell queen upstairs, to my green nau
gahyde couch, to the grave.)
Yes, I was embarrassed at first, but now
I'm rather pleased by my discovery. For
today 1 am rest peacefully, knowing I have
found my place. "lis a consummation
devoutly to be wish'd.
I'll bring the crackers, you bring an extra
pillow.
