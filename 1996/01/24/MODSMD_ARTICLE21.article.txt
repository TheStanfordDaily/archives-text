## Flashing Bug lights (sort of) The 						Strobe effect 
### Anand Ramachandran Staff writer 
Why does it look like
you have a hundred
• fingers when you wave
your hand in front of a TV?
A If you've never tried
• this, try it now. Turn up
• the brightness on your
TV or computer screen and
shake your hand back and forth
in front of the screen. You will
see multiple copies of your hand
and fingers. So, how does this
happen?
The reason for this strobe
effect is the same as why a strobe
light appears to slow down
motion — but this doesn't really
answer the question. With a
strobe light, the quick light puls
es illuminate the moving object
— say a partying Stanford stu
dent — at short intervals.
During these intervals, the stu
dent moves slightly. Since you
can only see the student when
the light is on, you don't see the
entire range of motion.
But you do see the student at
frequent enough intervals to fig
ure out how he or she is moving.
The effect is an apparent slowing
down of motion. Think of it like
a sports replay on TV where
each frame advances slowly, and
you see the player's movement
in slow motion. With a strobe
light, each pulse of the light rep
resents a different frame.
In the case of the dancing fin
gers though, the TV screen or
computer monitor is the strobe
light. Your TV or computer mon
itor does flicker, even if it's in
perfectly good working condi
tion. Most monitors these days
have a refresh rate of about 70
Hz., or cycles per minute.
That means the image on the
screen is being redrawn at that
rate, which is far too fast to
notice with your naked eye. You
can notice it, though, through a
video camera, for example,
which is why computers always
look really stupid on TV When
you shake your hand in front of

the screen, the flickering light of
your monitor illuminates your
hand at very frequent intervals,
just like the strobe light. And
voila! - you get 100 fingers.
What is even more interesting
than shaking your hands is using
a tuning fork The effect on the
fork is quite different if you wig
gle it horizontally or vertically.

The monitor refreshes the
screen in u horizontal line from
the top down. This causes a fork
with the tines vibrating horizon
tally to appear bent and wave
like. The fork looks wavy
because each second the fork is
moving and each segment of the
fork is illuminated at different
times bv the monitor. The effect
is greatest if the fork vibrates at
an integer multiple of the refresh
rate of the monitor.
For example, a 440 Hz., fork
(the standard A in music) works
well with a 70 Hz. monitor since
the frequency of the fork is about
six times that of the monitor.
Holding the fork so the tines
vibrate vertically has the same
effect as the strobe light.
If you don't have a tuning fork,
you can do the same thing with a
pencil, although you'd have to
wiggle it pretty fast. Now all you
couch potatoes and computer
hackers out there have something
to do while you flip channels or
take a break from that mentally
exhausting rerun of Cheers. Just
don't forget to yell "Norm" at the
appropriate times.
