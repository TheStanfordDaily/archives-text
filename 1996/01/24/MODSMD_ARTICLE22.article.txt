# Strokes: Which drug is worth the money?
## 
### Alison Davis Contributing writer 
It's been long known that pre
scribing blood-thinning drugs
like aspirin or warfarin are the
best ammunition for preventing
strokes in patients with atrial
fibrillation, an irregular heart
beat condition.
But warfarin costs about 80
times as much as aspirin, accord
ing to Dr. Douglas Owens, a
health services research associ
ate at the Veterans Affairs Hos
pital and an assistant professor
of General Internal Medicine at
the Medical Center
"There's no question that
warfarin is effective," Owens
said. However, because of cost
and other reasons many patients
who would benefit from warfarin
are not receiving it, according to
Dr. Brian Gage, a former Stan
ford undergraduate and postdoc
toral fellow who is currently an
assistant professor at Washing
ton University School of
Medicine in St. Louis.
Gage was the lead author of a

cost-effectiveness study com
paring the drugs which

appeared in the Dec.
20 issue of the
Journal of the
American Medi-

cal Association,
For the
study, Gage,
Owens, Assoc.
Neurology
Prof. Gregory

Albers and
undergraduat

Andria Cardi
nal li compiled
the results of j

eight pub
lished trials
which com- 4
pared vari- *
ous treat-

ments for

patients with
atrial fibrilla-

tion. Atrial fibrilla
tion increases the risk of

stroke fivefold, according to Gage.
They divided the data into
three, groups — high, medium
and low risk — based on
whether the patients had addi
tional stroke risk factors. They
aimed to determine "how cost -

effective is warfarin with respect
to aspirin," said Owens.
They found that despite the
annual cost of $800, high-risk
patients who use warfarin live
longer and save money. In this
patient population, warfarin is
clearly the drug of choice.
The savings are due to the pre
vention of the occurrence of
strokes, which are not only debil
itating but extremely costly from
a health care perspective, accord
ing to Owens. Strokes don't often
kill people, but they can severely
reduce their quality of life, he
continued.
With medium-risk patients,
the cost-effectiveness ratio for
using warfarin instead of aspirin
was .$B,OOO per quality-adjusted
year saved. With the quality-of
life adjustment, this still makes
warfarin the better drug for
these patients, Owens explained.
For low-risk patients, how-

ever, this value is
$370,000, ren
dering

aspirin the preferred therapy for
that group.
Terms like quality-adjusted
year and cost-effectiveness ratio
might seem out of place in the
medical research world — more
characteristic of a financial
spreadsheet than a medical
study.
However, in today's health
care climate, cost-effectiveness
analysis is especially important
in determining the actual value
of treatment. That translates to
the "money spent per quality
adjusted year of life saved," said
Owens, meaning that the best
treatment plan should take into
consideration both the costs to
lengthen life and to improve its
quality.
Another finding of the study
was the increase in life span with
the high-risk patient group with
warfarin therapy. "On the aver

age, people live about three
months longer," said Owens. He
likened the situation to other fre
quently employed preventative

measures such as screening
for breast cancer with phys-

ical exam and mammog-

raphy, which results
in an average gain

in life expectan
cy of 45 days.
One reason war
farin therapy

costs so much more
than aspirin is that
warfarin requires

monthly blood

monitoring.
Un fortu
nately, this
require
ment for
blood test
ing is not
likely to
change. A

recent study
of aspirin com-

bined with
"mini"-dose war
farin — a combina-

tion which doesn't
require blood testing —

failed to prevent stroke, Gage
noted.
But for the time being, the
high price tag of warfarin is not
as bad as it might seem for high
risk patients, who in the long
run could actually save money
and improve their quality of
life with warfarin instead of
aspirin.
