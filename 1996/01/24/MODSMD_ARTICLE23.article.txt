Understanding Genetics Prof. Neil
Risch's latest findings on patterns of
disease inheritance among Eastern
European Jews may require a little
more than a working knowledge of the
fundamentals of genetics. One may
need to learn a few things about histo
ry and geography as well.
Published last February in the jour
nal Nature Genetics, Risch's studies on
idiopathic torsion dystonia (ITD), a
movement disorder prevalent among
Ashkenazi Jews, give a glimpse into
the challenges genetic epidemiologists
face due to the interdisciplinary nature
of their research.
The reliability of genetic analysis
often depends substantially upon accu
rate knowledge of the historical and
geographical trends relevant to the
populations carrying the genes of
interest.
Research conducted by Risch and
colleagues at Yale, Columbia, Harvard
and Oregon Health Sciences University
has strengthened speculations that
ITD can be traced to a single founder
mutation that originated approximate
ly 350 years ago in the Ashkenazim,
the Jewish settlement from which
Risch's own ancestors originated.
This area, the northern part of the
historic Jewish Pale of settlement, is
located in present-day Lithuania and
Bvelorus, in Eastern Europe.
One of a handful of genetic diseases
occurring at high frequencies within
the Ashkenazi population, ITD is a
movement disorder characterized by
cramping of voluntary muscle groups.
Its severity ranges from generalized
impairment of limbs and axial muscles
to focal involvement of a single body
region, such as writer's cramp.
Age of onset varies dramatically as
well, ranging from early childhood to
the eighth decade. Risch's studies
focused primarily on families with the
early onset — before age 28 — form of
ITD.
Research on ITD began in 1987
when clinicians at Columbia suspected
a genetic basis for the disease. "The
majority of cases were isolated, but it
appeared to have a higher frequency
among Ashkenazi Jews, compared to
non-Ashkenazi Jews or non-Jews,"
said Risch.

"People wanted to do family studies
and locate the gene," he said. "My par
ticular area of interest is more the pop
ulation genetics and the history of the
disease."
Due to its incredible demographic
history — highlighted by uncharacter
istically rapid expansions and contrac
tions — as well as its endogamous ten
dencies, Ashkenazi Jews are subject to
a range of genetic disorders unique to
their population, including Tay-Sachs
disease, high levels of breast cancer
and ITD.
Prior to the release of Risch's find
ings, there was considerable debate
regarding ITD's mode of inheritance.
Many scientists believed that ITD, like
Tay-Sachs disease, was caused by a
recessive mutation — meaning that a
person needed to inherit a copy of the
mutant gene from both parents to
express symptoms of the disorder.
Under this assumption, the high fre
quency of ITD in Ashkenazi Jews was
commonly explained by heterozygote
advantage, a theory which suggests
that carrying a single copy of a mutant
gene, which would normally be detri
mental if both copies were present,
could actually be favored within a pop
ulation if it confers some sort of pro
tection against another harmful condi
tion.
However, Risch's studies have
shown that ITD, unlike other Ashke
nazi disorders, is transmitted via dom
inant inheritance, but with low — 30
percent — penetrance. That is, only
one copy of the mutant gene is neces
sary to have the disease, but only 30
percent of such carriers will actually
show symptoms.
According to Risch, discovering that
ITD is caused by a dominant mutation
has greatly facilitated analysis of the
disease's history because it avoids the
potential complications that often
arise when studying recessive disor
ders, in which heterozygote advantage
often skews expected gene distribu
tions.
Based upon studies of 59 Ashkenazi
Jewish families with ITD, Risch's find
ings have also provided solid evidence
to explain how and why ITD was able
to spread so rapidly throughout a spe
cific population.
After molecular techniques allowed
scientists to map the gene for early
onset ITD to a specific region on chro

mosome nine, Risch and his colleagues
began characterizing the history of the
mutation.
They showed that 90 percent of the
families in their study had an identical
pattern of genetic markers surround
ing the ITD gene. This strongly sup
ported the genetic drift theory, which
predicts that ITD arose from a single
mutation that was rapidly amplified
because a single family who carried the
mutant gene produced a large number
of offspring who married within a lim
ited founder population.
These genetic analyses also revealed
that some of these genetic markers
occur at frequencies different than
would be expected from their distance
apart on the chromosome.
This situation, known as linkage dis
equilibrium, often occurs when there

has been insufficient time for the genet
ic markers to reach equilibrium — since
one of the markers was introduced into
the population fairly recently.
Risch and his colleagues were able to
identify the oldest mutant gene carri
ers in the families they studied and to
correlate their geographic origin with
known migration patterns of Ashke
nazi Jews in order to pinpoint the
region in which the ITD mutation orig
inated.
Another important consideration in
Risch's interdisciplinary approach of
genetic analyses of disease within
small populations is the influence of
socioeconomic status on marriage and
fertility patterns. Historical records
suggest that ITD was spread primarily
through the upper classes of Ashkenazi
Jews, since the more affluent tended to

have significantly more children and
higher survival rates than did the
lower classes.
The conclusions drawn regarding
the history of ITD have strengthened
the belief that genetic drift could well
explain most, if not all the genetic dis
eases occurring at high frequency in
the Ashkenazi Jewish population
today.
This presumption could be further
tested by looking for linkage disequi
librium in other Ashkena/.i genetic dis
orders to see whether the origin of
these conditions could be traced back
to a similar time point in history.
If so, it is likely that genetic drift
was primarily responsible for the dra
matic increase in frequency of genes
that cause a variety of disorders preva
lent in the Ashkenazi population.
