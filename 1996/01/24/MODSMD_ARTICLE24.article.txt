## Stanford fencing heads East to clash with nation's best 
### Laura Drum Contributing writer 
Six years ago, discussions of
Stanford sports rarely involved
the word "fencing." However,
toiling behind the scenes the
past few seasons, the Stanford
men's and women's fencing
teams have thrust themselves
into the national spotlight.
Tomorrow, Stanford fencers will
travel to Pennsylvania to prove
once again that they deserve the
attention they now receive.
"Six years ago, Stanford
didn't exist on a fencing map,"
said men's head coach Zoran
Tulum. "Now, schools from the
Ivy League don't even want to
fence us because losing is bad for
their record."
This year's teams include one
member of the Senior National
Team, two members of the Junior
National Team and two Junior
National Team substitutes. The
men's top fencer, sophomore Sean
McLain, will rodshirt tliis year to
train for the 1996 Olympics. Despite

the loss of McLain, the Cardinal looks
forwaixl to a strong .season.
The four-day Pennsylvania
trip features matches against
some of the top fencing teams in
the country. Stanford begins
competition tomorrow in
Philadelphia against three East
Coast schools. On Saturday,
matches will continue at State
College. In all, the Cardinal will
face 10 teams, including No. 1
Penn State and No. 2 St. Johns.
While the Nittanv Lions and
the Red Storm ure formidable
obstacles, the Cardinal men arid
women expect to defeat the
other schools with ease. "This is
the first year I'm traveling with
full confidence," Tulum said.
The men's team will send
saber, epee and foil squads,
each with three members, while
the women will send two four
membered squads. Stanford's
youth holds promise for the
future, and the trip will provide
the Cardinal's young talent
with its first exposure to colle
giate fencing.
Sherry Posthumus, head coach
for the Cardinal women, and
Tulum are no strangers to the
fencing scene. Posthumus' back
ground as three-time Olympic
fencing manager and Zoran's

experience as a national coach
have keyed the development of
Stanford fencing.
The Cardinal must draw upon
this experience on the Pennsylva
nia trip. In general, East Coast
schools are stronger and more
experienced than West Coast
clubs.
"Psychologically, going from
the West to East Coast is like
stepping into enemy territory,"
said senior women's fencer Chloe

Sladden. Nevertheless, the Cardi
nal remains confident that it will
successfully overcome the upcom
ing challenge. Stanford fencers
eagerly anticipate the Pennsylva
nia trip, their only scheduled
adventure on the East Coast.
"I've watched this team work
ing hard since the first day," said
sophomore men's fencer Sasha
Zucker. "It'll be good to see us
come together against some of the
best teams in the country."
