# Ex-coach Walsh to return to NFL and San Francisco 49ers

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -
Former Stan ford football coach Rill
Walsh, who designed the offense
that has made the San Francisco
49ers one of pro football's most
powerful teams for nearly two
decades, is returning to the club.
The team called a news confer
ence yesterday involving Walsh,
coach George Seifert and presi
dent Carmen Policy would attend.
Walsh will have the title of
administrative assistant and will
have an office at the team's prac
tice compound in Santa Clara the
San Francisco Chronicle reported
yesterday, quoting sources who
were not identified.
San Francisco's offensive coor
dinator, Marc Trestman, came
under some criticism this season,
his first with the team, despite the
fact that the 49ers led the league
in scoring for the fourth straight
season.
Walsh led the team to three
Super Rowl titles during the
1980s and was elected to the Pro
Football Hall of Fame in 1993.
Rut he's been out of the NFL
since 1989. He left the team after
his third Super Rowl victory for a
three-year career in broadcasting.
Team spokesman Dave Rahn
said Monday night he could not

confirm reports that Walsh was
returning to the team.
Walsh's addition won't affect
the position of Seifert, who has
guided San Francisco to two Super
Howl triumphs in the seven years
since succeeding Walsh in 1989.
The last time Walsh was
reported to be planning a return,
after the 1991 season, Seifert
opposed it and the deal fell
through.
Now, however, Walsh is 64,
further removed from the days
when he led the team and appar
ently more willing to accept a sub
ordinate role, The Chronicle said.
The 49ers were knocked out of
the playoffs this month, when the
Green Rav Packers beat them 27-
17.
Walsh, whose offensive system
is still run by the 49ers, operated
quarterback camps and worked
for the NFL in an advisory role
over the past year.
He spent the previous three
years in a second tour as Stanford
coach before resigning last year.
Walsh passed up a chance to work
with the 49ers as a consultant and
took the coaching job at Stanford
in 1992. The school gave Walsh
his first major head coaching job
in 1977.
