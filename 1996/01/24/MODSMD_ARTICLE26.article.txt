# Women's tennis takes two titles
## Scott, Burt and Chiminello bring home metal from Pac-10 Indoors 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
Sophomore Julie Scott and the
doubles team of senior Amy
Chiminello and junior Emily Burt
secured tremendous wins for Stan
ford in the 1996 Women's Pacific
10 Conference Indoor Tournament
last weekend in Seattle, Wash.
The tournament, which began
last Thursday and concluded on
Sunday, divided its participants
into three singles flights and
three doubles flights. The No. 1
and No. 2 singles players from
each team competed in one flight,
No. 3 and No. 4 in a second flight
and No. 5 and No. 6 in the third
flight. The doubles competition
used a similar format.
Stanford received the No. 1
seed in all three doubles flights,
but only the pair of Chiminello
and Burt managed to emerged vic
torious in the third flight.
Chiminello and Burt hammered
Monique Allegre and Betsy Min
nghoff of Arizona 6-0, 6-0 in their
first match and then defeated Ani
cia Mendez and Kelly Rudolph of
UCLA 6-2, 6-3 to reach the cham
pionship. In the final, Chiminello
and Burt faced second-seeded
Reka Cseresnyes and Torey Pratt
of Arizona State and won convinc
ingly 6-3, 6-3 to polish off the
tournament without losing a set.
As for singles competition,
Scott began as the second seed in

the third flight behind No. 1 seed
Chiminello. Chiminello lost to
eventual finalist Karen Goldstein
of Arizona 7-6 (6), 6-4 in the
quarterfinals while Scott breezed
through the other side of the
draw. Scott defeated Lindy Irving
of Washington 7-5, 6-0, Mendez
of UCLA 6-0, 6-1 and Stephanie
Tibbits of California 6-0, 6-2 en
route to the final.
Although the final match
against Goldstein proved to be
Scott's most difficult encounter
of the tourney, Scott won in
straight sets 6-2, 7-5. The victory
gave Scott her second-consecutive
Pac-10 indoor title.
"I thought I was playing pretty
well," Scott said. "There was no
pressure because it's the first
tournament of the season."
Cardinal head coach Frank
Brennan noted that Scott contin
ues to improve. "She consistently
picks up her game," he said. "She
gets better every day. She's prob
ably been our best player since
the first day of the year."
Scott also reached the doubles
final in the second flight with her
partner, senior Kim Shasby.
However, Shasby pulled a leg
muscle, forcing the top-seeded
tandem to default to Goldstein
and Stephanie Sammaritano of
Arizona. Until the injury, Shasby
and Scott played excellent tennis.

Sophomore Julie Scott took the flight-three title this weekend at the
Pacific 10 Conference Indoor Championships in Seattle, Wash.
"I think we had a good chance [to
win], but it was safer to let her
miss," Scott said. "I'd rather her
miss one match now than miss the
whole season." Shasby, who
reached the semifinals in the second
singles flight before defaulting due
to her injury, should return to 100
percent by the end of next week.
In other competition, sophomore
Ania Bleszynski played exceptional
tennis before losing 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 in
the semifinals of the top flight to
defending national champion Keri
Phebus of UCLA. Brennan consid
ers Phebus as one of the best play
ers in the country.
"(Bleszynski is] aggressive and
looks very motivated on the court,"
Brennan said. "She's much
improved over last year, physically
and mentally. Her game is impos
ing, and she's potentially a very
dominating player."
In doubles action, Bleszynski
paired with junior Katie Schlukebir
and won their first match in the top
flight over Shanelle Kaneshiro and
Ali Napier of Oregon 6-1,6-1. In the
semifinals however, Bleszynski and
Schlukebir ran into Phebus and
Paige Yaroshuk of UCIA and lost a
grueling match 7-5, 6-3. Schlukebir
also competed in singles competi
tion but was upset by Cseresnyes of
Arizona State 5-7, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (3) in
the quarterfinals.
Brennan believed that the for
mat of last weekend's tournament
made it more competitive. "It's very
tough competition," he said.
"There's not a whole lot of slack.
The No. 1 seed doesn't get to play
the No. 4 or No. 5 seed."
As for the outlook on the rest of
Stanford's season, Brennan
remains positive about his team's
capabilities but hesitat(.*l to make
any predictions.
"It's still very early," he said.
