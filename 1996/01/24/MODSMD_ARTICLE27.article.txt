## Stanford women will be tested this weekend with USC, UCLA, Cal 
### Ratha Harntha Staff writer 
For better or worse, the Stanford women's
swimming and diving team will finally face an

opponent that has the ability to win when the
Cardinal heads down to Southern California
to face third-ranked USC on Saturday.
Before its showdown with the Trojans, Stan
ford (4-0) will also face UCLA and California

in Los Angeles on Friday in its first Pacific 10
Conference dual meets of the year.
"USC is an extremely well-balanced
team," said Cardinal head coach Richard
Quick. "There is not one event that won't be
contested for first. One of the big keys is not
to get swept [in any eventj.
"I always expect to win. We could lose.
USC is that good, but I expect to have a good
meet."
The Trojans enter the contest after a 178-
84 stomping of Michigan two weeks ago. The
Wolverines were ranked No. 1 in the presea
son.
"It's the type of meet where you have to
have everyone swim well," Quick said.
Senior co-captains Lisa Jacob and Jane
Skill man, senior Jessica Tong and juniors
Sarah Anderson and Claudia Franco will lead
the way for the Cardinal. Skillman, Tong,
Anderson and Franco are all coming off
impressive meets against Nevada and Vil
lanova, in which they scored at least two vic
tories in just one of the contests.
Jacob did not participate in either compe
tition because of an injured shoulder, but she
will return to action this weekend. "I want to
win and have fun," she said. "My expecta
tions aren't that high Ibecause of the shoul
der injury], but I feel a lot better."
Jacob's recovery is especially important
for the Cardinal considering Stanford no
longer boasts a superstar like Jenny Thomp-
