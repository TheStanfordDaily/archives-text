# Jordan continues to prove he's the best there ever was
## 
### 
«"i\ n ichael Jordan is a man with
l\/| old, saggy breasts." Those
-i-V-Lpainful words were uttered by
a dear friend just seven months ago after
the Orlando Magic defeated the Chicago
Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals.
Michael was not Michael in that series,
turning the ball over late in crucial games,
looking tired, frustrated and defeated. Yet,
such words were not wise to speak. While
they were on the minds of many, such obvi
ously imprudent beliefs do not deserve to be
heard by human ears.
My friend would regret those words. You
just don't talk trash to Michael Jordan.
Here we are, seven months later, and Jor
dan is in a familiar position: atop the scor
ing leaders. Michael's 31.7 points per
game is over five points better than his
nearest competitor, Utah's Karl Malone.
But even that is not indicative of the tear
Jordan has been on as of late.
In the month of January, Jordan has
exploded for an insane 36.9 points a game in
nine contests through Monday, including
48 against Philadelphia and 46 the follow
ing game against Washington. No player in
recent history has come close to a 37-point
average over any extended period of time.
Jordan last did that in his 1986-87 cam
paign, in which he poured in 37.1 points a
game.
This 30-plus average, assuming no one
will catch him (and no one will), may allow
Jordan to eclipse Wilt Chamberlain's seven
straight scoring titles. It will be the eighth
consecutive year in his career that Jordan
will have won the scoring championship.
Jordan also currently ranks fourth in the
league in steals with 2.2 takeaways per
game.
The National Basketball Association

recently named Jordan Player of the Week for
the second time this season after he registered
38 points a game along with seven rebounds,
a .529 shooting percentage from the field and
a .462 shooting percentage from behind the
three-point arc in four Hulls victories.

Jordan doesn't reach such heights by
taking more shots than anyone else in the
league. His field-goal percentage is above
.500, a rather impressive feat considering
the degree of difficulty of his attempts. But
not even this signifies the extent to which
Jordan is back.
So for all of you who still believe, despite
what you've seen this season, that Jordan is
not the same player he was when he left, I
now submit the following evidence:
Jordan's career averages in points,
three-point percentage and rebounds: 32.2
points (the highest in NBA history), 27.4
percent, 6.3 boards.
Jordan's averages in the same categories
for this season through Monday: 31.7
points, 31.8 percent and 6.2 boards.
This isn't golf, ladies and gentlemen.
Those hip numbers mean good things for
Bulls fans. The differences in scoring and

rebounding are quickly being
erased by Jordan's unfathomable
January.
Some will still argue that
despite the statistics, Jordan is
not the same player he was when
he left the game. He doesn't have
the legs that carried him from the
free-throw line to the rim. He
can't do the things that he once
did. Fools, I call such people. Jor
dan hasn't been that, player since
1990. As he grew older, Jordan's
game changed considerably, and
by the time he left the game after
the 1993 Finals, Jordan had
become a jump-shooting two
guard.
In fact, with Jordan's born
again enthusiasm for the game, I
find him sometimes playing with
more aggression than he did two
years ago. By the third champi
onship, Jordan was done with the
finger rolls and reverse layups.
He knew that his body would not
be able to keep up with that type

of game and that the longevity of
his career depended exclusively
on converting himself into a con
sistent outside threat. He still
dominates games, albeit in a dif
ferent way. He remains the only
player in the league that can score
a quiet 36 en route to another
Bulls victory.
He made changes primarily
because you all told him he
couldn't. Jordan is the ultimate
athlete, spurred by challenges
and obstacles. Throughout the
first years of his career, every
one was awed by his offensive
explosiveness and athleticism.
Yet, they criticized him for his
defense. The next season, Jor
dan not only received the NBA
Offensive Player of the Year
award, but he earned Defensive
Player of the Year honors as
well.
Next, they told him that he
was an athlete, that his jumper
wasn't good enough. For proof of
his jump shot, see the first half of
Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals.
Jordan scored 35 points in the
first half against Portland, high
lighted by 6-of-8 from three-point

land in perhaps the most amazing
offensive display of this decade.
I have to thank you, all of you
— including my dear friend who
allowed those words to pass over
his lips that day. It is those words
that have provided Jordan with
exactly what he needed — motiva
tion, challenge, hurdles.
And now, he is back.
The most impressive thing
about Jordan's game is that he
now can dominate a game in
many ways — defensively, offen
sively, distributing the ball,
rebounding, whatever it takes. He
can score 31 quietly or he can
score 31 on five dunks and six
spectacular reverse layups. He
will launch all night from behind
the three-point stripe or he will
hit 15 free throws.
People around the league said
he wasn't the same last year — a
true statement. But there are still
skeptics this year, and I fear for
them the moment they step on
the court with Jordan. There's
nothing more frightening than
Jordan, equipped with firm pec
toral muscles, with something to
prove.
