# Jordan continues to prove he's the best there ever was
## 
### 
Â«"i\ n ichael Jordan is a man with
l\/| old, saggy breasts." Those
-i-V-Lpainful words were uttered by
a dear friend just seven months ago after
the Orlando Magic defeated the Chicago
Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals.
Michael was not Michael in that series,
turning the ball over late in crucial games,
looking tired, frustrated and defeated. Yet,
such words were not wise to speak. While
they were on the minds of many, such obvi
ously imprudent beliefs do not deserve to be
heard by human ears.
My friend would regret those words. You
just don't talk trash to Michael Jordan.
Here we are, seven months later, and Jor
dan is in a familiar position: atop the scor
ing leaders. Michael's 31.7 points per
game is over five points better than his
nearest competitor, Utah's Karl Malone.
But even that is not indicative of the tear
Jordan has been on as of late.
In the month of January, Jordan has
exploded for an insane 36.9 points a game in
nine contests through Monday, including
48 against Philadelphia and 46 the follow
ing game against Washington. No player in
recent history has come close to a 37-point
average over any extended period of time.
Jordan last did that in his 1986-87 cam
paign, in which he poured in 37.1 points a
game.
This 30-plus average, assuming no one
will catch him (and no one will), may allow
Jordan to eclipse Wilt Chamberlain's seven
straight scoring titles. It will be the eighth
consecutive year in his career that Jordan
will have won the scoring championship.
Jordan also currently ranks fourth in the
league in steals with 2.2 takeaways per
game.
The National Basketball Association

recently named Jordan Player of the Week for
the second time this season after he registered
38 points a game along with seven rebounds,
a .529 shooting percentage from the field and
a .462 shooting percentage from behind the
three-point arc in four Hulls victories.

Jordan doesn't reach such heights by
taking more shots than anyone else in the
league. His field-goal percentage is above
.500, a rather impressive feat considering
the degree of difficulty of his attempts. But
not even this signifies the extent to which
Jordan is back.
So for all of you who still believe, despite
what you've seen this season, that Jordan is
not the same player he was when he left, I
now submit the following evidence:
Jordan's career averages in points,
three-point percentage and rebounds: 32.2
points (the highest in NBA history), 27.4
percent, 6.3 boards.
Jordan's averages in the same categories
for this season through Monday: 31.7
points, 31.8 percent and 6.2 boards.
This isn't golf, ladies and gentlemen.
Those hip numbers mean good things for
Bulls fans. The differences in scoring and
