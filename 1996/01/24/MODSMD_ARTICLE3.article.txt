# Grant funds study of long-term plan
## 
### Beth Berselli Senior staff writer 
A new, privately funded project
to study Stanford's long-term ad
ministrative strategy is moving
forward, University officials say.
The James Irvine Foundation
has awarded the University
$800,000 to continue its efforts to
plan for the future. The grant, an
nounced hy University President
Gerhard Casper at the last Facul
ty Senate meeting, will be admin
istered over the next two years.
The project will focus on acade
mic planning and restructuring,
bringing toget her a team of ana
lysts and planners under the direc

tion of an advisory board.
The goal of the project is to put
"tools in place so that we can re
spond to certain changes" in the
future, said Geoffrey Cox, vice
provost for institutional planning.
Cox will direct the project, while
Provost Condoleezza Rice will
chair the advisory board.
According to the proposal sub
mitted to the Irvine Foundation,
the project will attempt to answer
several questions, including how
the University plans to maintain
and strengthen its programs with
fewer resources. The University
will also explore how to become
less dependent on real increases
in tuition and how to continue
increasing diversity among facul
ty, students and the curriculum.
To find answers to these ques
tions, the advisory board will
direct eight research projects dur
ing the next two years. The pro
jects include evaluating programs,
analyzing the cost of the academic
enterprise, examining the system
of faculty rewards and incentives
and developing new models for
administrative services. Other
areas to be researched are infras
tructure planning, technology, the
"tuition puzzle" and ways to
maintain diversity.
"It's certainly not the first
time nor the last time that we'll
be looking at these issues," Cox
said.
Earlier this month, the Faculty

Senate's Planning and Policy
Board released a strategic plan
ning report, titled, "Planning in
an Era of Change." The report
was the result of more than three
years of study.
Of the eight proposed research
projects, Cox said administrators
don't view any single one as more
important than the others. "I do
think that ultimately they are all
related," he said.
Cox said the research areas
"aren't hard and fast," and that
new areas may come up during
the two-year period.
Other universities will likely
benefit from the findings of the
Stanford project. "We're all facing
very similar issues," Cox said.
Members of the advisory board
should be named by next week,
Cox said. The board will consist of
about a dozen experts from inside
and outside the University.
The grant will further provide
funding for three or four new full
time staff positions, including

analysts and a
project director,
Cox said. The
positions will last
for two years.
"This is a
chance to deal
with some timely
issues . . . but
without commit
ting to a long-

term staff," Cox said. Stanford
has never established a full-scale
office of "institutional research,"
Cox said, although Stanford
administrators have historically
been leaders in the field.
University trustees praised the
project for its forward-looking
approach. "I think it's terribly
exciting. It's great that the Irvine
Foundation saw fit to honor Stan
ford in this way," said Trustee
Ruth Halperin. The proposal for
the project was presented to the
Hoard of Trustees last month.
Halperin said the project will
"make a difference down the road"

as the University participates in
long-term planning. The project
will help Stanford "make the most
of its resources," she said.
The James Irvine Foundation
was founded in 1937 with the aim
of promoting the general welfare
of the people of California. The
San Francisco-based foundation
has assets of $700 million and
annually awards about $30 mil
lion in grants, said Happy Esty,
assistant to the president of the
Irvine Foundation.
The foundation is pleased to
support Stanford's efforts in
restructuring and academic plan
ning, Esty said.
"We've had a historic relation
ship with Stanford. . . . We have a
general confidence in Stanford"
based on the success of previous
projects funded by foundation
grants, she said. In the last decade,
the University has received three
grants — totaling about $4 million
— for projects encouraging diversi
ty at Stanford.
