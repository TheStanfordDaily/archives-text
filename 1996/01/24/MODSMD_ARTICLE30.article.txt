# Stanford Fund chief leaves for Duke post

### Kristie Lilje Smith Contributing writer 
Stanford Fund Director Nancy
Wells has said she will leave
Stanford next month in order to
assume a top fund-raising posi
tion at Duke University.
As director of the fund, Wells
managed the University's efforts
to raise money from undergradu
ate alumni. The fund was created
two years ago to provide a cen
tralized pool of funds for under
graduate education.
"I'm not leaving because of
any dissatisfaction with the
Stanford Fund," Wells said.
"This was a totally voluntary
resignation."
Wells, who worked for more
than three years at the Universi
ty's Office of Development, will
become director of major gifts at
Duke.
In September 1994, the Stan
ford Fund replaced the Annual
Fund as the fundamental mecha
nism for soliciting gifts from all
undergraduate degree holders at
Stanford, including alumni who
hold undergraduate degrees from
the Schools of Humanities and
Sciences, Earth Sciences and
Engineering.
General support for the Uni
versity is solicited exclusively by
the Stanford Fund, and proceeds
are used by Provost Condoleezza
Rice, in consultation with the
deans of the three schools and
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds, to advance
undergraduate education at
Stanford.
Although Wells has worked
with Stanford for more than
three years, she assumed the
position of director of the Stan
ford Fund at its inception.
Student controversy sur
rounded the Stanford Fund last
year because of a proposed alum
ni-giving policy that would have
limited student groups' ability to
solicit alumni. In an effort to
unify the University's fund-rais
ing efforts, the policy would have
prohibited groups from soliciting
funding from alumni who had
not given to t he group within the
past five years.
As Stanford Fund director,

Wells was a key participant in the
partnership between the admin
istration and the students that
resulted in a compromise policy.
The policy gave student groups
alternative fund-raising opportu
nities â€” such as working for the
Stanford Fund.
In its first year, the Stanford
Fund raised more than $3.8 mil
lion to further advance under
graduate education, according to
the Annual Report of Alumni
Giving for 1994-95.
In fact, Wells said because the
fund is doing so well now, she
feels it is a good time for her to
take advantage of the "great and
unexpected opportunity" Duke
has offered her.
According to Wells, the fund
has raised $700,000 more at this
point in the fiscal year than it had
last year at the same time.
"Our momentum is strong,"
Wells said. "We have a very
strong staff here."
Wells said she doesn't think
that her departure will cause a
loss in that momentum. She
added, though, that "it is impor
tant to announce [a new director]
soon," so as to not lose any
ground.
Stephen Peeps, associate vice
president of the Office of Devel
opment, is looking for the new
director, Wells said.
The job opening has been post
ed through the Personnel Office
to the Stanford community for
about three weeks, according to
Peeps.
"It's important to take the
time to find an excellent succes
sor for Nancy," Peeps said. "I
won't rush [the process] just to
fill the position more quickly," he
added.
Peeps said he feels confident
that someone will emerge from
the Stanford community that can
fill the vacant position. "It would
be icing on the cake" if that per
son were currently affiliated with
the Stanford Fund or the Office
of Development, but it's not a
critical qualification for the job,
he said.
Peeps "will make a strong
appointment," Wells said. "And
I'll be working very hard up until
Feb. 9," she added.
