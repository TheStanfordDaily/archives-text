# Down syndrome patient gets new heart and lungs
## 
### Frank Guinan Editorial staff 
After a surprisingly short wait, San
dra Jensen received a new heart and
lungs yesterday in a 4 1/2-hour opera
tion at the Medical Center.
Jensen, 35, was flown in from her
home in Sacramento late Monday night
after a donor became available. She re
mained in critical condition as of 9 p.m.
last night with stable vital signs, which
is typical for patients recovering from
this kind of operation.
Afflicted with Down syndrome,
Jensen required surgery because of a
congenital heart defect associated with
the genetic disorder. She was given only
two years to live when diagnosed by her
cardiologist in January 1995.

Late last week, Jensen was placed on
Stanford's waiting list for a heart-lung
transplant by Stanford medical officials.
Both Stanford and UC-San Diego reject
ed putting her on their waiting lists last
year, claiming that she didn't have the
mental capacity to deal with potential
complications after the operation.
After the Medical Center received
written warning that its action was in vi
olation of the Americans with Disabili
ties Act, Stanford officials reconsidered
Jensen's case and reversed their deci
sion.
Dr. Bruce Reitz, chair of the Depart
ment of ( ardiot horacic Surgery, served
as lead surgeon for the operation, which
according to a Medical Center press re
lease, "went smoothly." The operation
becan around 4 a.m. vesterdav morninrr

and Jensen began post-operative care at
about 9 a.m.
According to the Medical Center, the
average wait for a heart-lung transplant
patient with a B blood type like Jensen is
410 days.
"Not many donors come along with
that type," Reitz said.
He added that there were two other
people with a compatible blood type on
the waiting list. "They were larger
though, and Sandra was the only one
able to use the smaller organs," he said.
Reitz said he expects Jensen to be in
critical condition for the next two or
three days. Barring complications, she
will then spend the next two to three
weeks in the hospital recovering.
Both Jensen and her mother,
Kav DeMaio, plan to be in the
Stanford area for the next three
months.
After returning home, Jensen
will be given the proper care by

her local doctor. "She will be con
tinually followed here in some
intervals," Reitz said.
Keitz performed the world's
first successful heart-lung trans
plant at the Medical Center in
1981. Since then, Stanford has
performed 138 such operations.
In 1995 alone, the Medical Center
operated on 16 patients for a
heart-lung transplant.

Jensen's operation is being
paid for by Medicare and is
expected to cost around $150,000,
depending on her post-operation
care, said Reitz.
The identity of the person
who donated the organs has not
been released. Medical officials
said the donor died somewhere
outside the San Francisco Bay
Area.
