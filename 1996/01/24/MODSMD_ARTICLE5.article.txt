# Byerwalter fills finance post
## After two years, Stanford alumna takes CFO position 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
After almost two years of searching,
University President Gerhard Casper
announced that a Stanford alumna and
former ASSU Council of Presidents
member will be the University's next
chief financial officer.
Mariann Byerwalter, now chief oper
ating officer and chief financial officer of
America First Eureka Holdings, will
begin her new post in mid-February,
Casper said.
"I'm very happy she decided to return
to the University," Casper said, adding
he originally was not sure he could per
suade her to leave America First. Casper
said he was impressed by Byerwalter's
analytic capacity and coolness under
pressifre.
"1 hope to apply the lessons I've
learned to the institution 1 know and
love," Byerwalter said. "I always liki* to

make sure that every
practice and every dol
lar spent is done the
most practical way."
She succeeds Peter
Van Etten, who in 1994
became chief executive
officer of Stanford
Health Services. Geof
frey Cox, vice provost
for institutional plan
ning, acted as interim

financial officer after Van Etten left.
Aware that her arrival at Stanford
comes in the wake of a financial crisis,
Byerwalter said she realizes she will be
strapped for resources.
"We clearly have to all be more inven
tive, much like the business I've come
from," she said.
Byerwalter's ties to the University
aro numerous, and she considers the re
lationship "unbroken." She graduated
in 1982 with degrees in economics and

political science, and has since served on
boards of directors of the Stanford
Alumni Association and the Lucile
Salter Packard Children's Hospital. She
is currently a member of the Board of
Trustees.
"Stanford will face very difficult
questions about its future finance and
relations with other parts of the world
which require financial analysis,"
Casper said. "I need that additional ca
pacity. She's offering it."
He added that at age 35, Byerwalter
brings a new generation's perspective to
University decision making.
Due to the board's bylaws which pro
hibit University employees from serving
on the board, Byerwalter will resign her
trustee position before taking the helm
of University finances.
Outside of Stanford, Byerwalter is a
board member of Rureka√üank and a co-
