# Kimball hosts 3 Nobel winners
## 
### Dana Hangai Contributing writer 
Discussing topics ranging
from the principles of general
economic equilibrium to the
quality of Stanford's football
team, three of Stanford's
Nobel laureates spoke last
night in Kimball Dining Hall.
Nobel laureates in econom
ics Kenneth Arrow and
William Sharpe and Nobel lau
reate Henry Taube, who re
ceived his prize in chemistry,
took part in a reception and
dinner and met in informal
groups with students.
Answering students' ques
tions, the three laureates
talked about their areas of ex
pertise, relating stories con
cerning their prize-winning
work to about 50 students.
Talking about why he se
lected economics as his field of
study, Arrow, a professor
emeritus, said his childhood
during the (treat Depression
was a primary motivation.
"People always talk about

how the past was either the best
of times or the worst," Arrow
said. "In my case, it was the
worst, with a large number of the
population out of work. After
that, I wanted to help people, and
it was either sociology or eco
nomics, and I felt economics was
more appropriate."
Arrow received the Nobel prize
in 1972 for his contributions to
general economic equilibrium
theory and welfare theory.
Taube, emeritus professor in
chemistry, also talked about his
reasons for studying chemistry

and his experiments in electron
transfer reactions in metal com
plexes, for which he received the
Nobel prize in 1983.
The professors did not confine
their discussions to their academ
ic careers. After being asked
about Columbia University's tra
ditionally poor football team,
Arrow quipped, "Sometimes I
wonder why we need a football
team." Arrow received his doctor
al degree from Columbia.
He added, "However, Stanford
does pretty well without buying
team members, like some schools
do. It's definitely better than
schools such as Columbia, Har
vard or Princeton."
Senior Shahriar Heidary, head
advising associate for Kimball,

said the dinner was part of a
theme program begun by Resi
dent Fellow John Rickford last
year.
"We're trying to bridge the gap
between faculty and students,"
Heidary said. By introducing stu
dents to people they might not
normally meet, Heidary said, they
would learn about more of the
resources available at Stanford.
"When students want to fill
out medical applications, they
should be able to find people at
the Medical School, for example,"
Heidary said. "We're not trying to
tell students they have to do this,
but maybe if we introduce differ
ent people to the students, they'll
be encouraged to do it them
selves."

Former Secretary of State and
Hoover Fellow George Shultz
came to Kimball last week as part
of the program.
"It was a good experience,"
sophomore Tomoeh Murakami
said. "It was a great chance to be
able to talk with important people
and find out that they're not
unreachable, but everyday peo
ple."
The Nobel laureates also said
they enjoyed the experience.
Sharpe, a professor at the
Graduate School of Business and
a pioneer in the theory of finan
cial economics, said, "At the Busi
ness School we're on sort of an
island. It's great to be able to talk
with students and find out what's
really going on."
