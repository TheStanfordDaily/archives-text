# Report fails to satisfy LGBCC leader
## Needs, concerns of queer community still have to be addressed, he says 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Although the University is taking important
steps forward in recognizing the needs of gay, les
bian and bisexual students, some questions and
issues demand more attention, said David
Barba, student coordinator of the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center.
"There have certainly been some important
improvements made in the past years," Barba

said. "But many of us who have been at Stanford
for the past four years are skeptical of promises.
We want more action now rather than promises
for the future."
He added that some major concerns which
weren't addressed sufficiently were: more de
tailed information about the financial obstacles
that prevented the appointment of an official
LGBCC director, more clarity on how to make
concrete improvements out of the report's
promises and more efforts to make the report

more widely available to the public.
While the report is "thorough and compre
hensive," Barba said he feels that its wording
"makes it sound like there's a lot more happen
ing than there really is." For instance, while the
report mentions that the Undergraduate Advis
ing ('enter has a list of faculty and staff contacts
for queer students seeking advice, Barba said
there is only one person on the list.
