# Report fails to satisfy LGBCC leader
## Needs, concerns of queer community still have to be addressed, he says 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Although the University is taking important
steps forward in recognizing the needs of gay, les
bian and bisexual students, some questions and
issues demand more attention, said David
Barba, student coordinator of the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center.
"There have certainly been some important
improvements made in the past years," Barba

said. "But many of us who have been at Stanford
for the past four years are skeptical of promises.
We want more action now rather than promises
for the future."
He added that some major concerns which
weren't addressed sufficiently were: more de
tailed information about the financial obstacles
that prevented the appointment of an official
LGBCC director, more clarity on how to make
concrete improvements out of the report's
promises and more efforts to make the report

more widely available to the public.
While the report is "thorough and compre
hensive," Barba said he feels that its wording
"makes it sound like there's a lot more happen
ing than there really is." For instance, while the
report mentions that the Undergraduate Advis
ing ('enter has a list of faculty and staff contacts
for queer students seeking advice, Barba said
there is only one person on the list.
The report — released last
March — highlights needs such as
an official LGBCC director, aca
demic role models, the integration
of lesbian, gay and bisexual studies
into the University curriculum, the
encouragement of a hospitable
social and academic climate and an
open-mindedness toward lesbians,
gayes and bisexuals on campus.
In responding to the report,
Wais emphasized that progress
remains to be made. There has
been improvement recently, he
.4aid, including the ftffifling of a

graduate student internship at the
LGBCC, sensitivity training for
resident assistants and staff at the
Cowell Student Health Center and
the widening of dialogues with
other campus organizations.
Wais "apparently realizes that,
in comparison to other campus
organizations, the LGBCC is finan
cially disadvantaged. It seems that
he's going to make changes about
the way the LGBCC is funded in
the future," Barba said.
However, referring to Wais'
claim that the University lacks the
funds necessary to hire an official
LGBCC director, Barba said there
needs to be more elaborate discus
sion on the future possibility of
nppoirifing h'director. Community

centers for other student groups,
such as El Centra Chicano or the
Asian American Activities Center,
currently have directors, he said.
The report received praise for
its approach, which some said was
a serious effort to improve both the
lives of lesbians, gayes and bisexu
als students and attitudes about
homosexuality on campus.
"The dean evidently has a very
strong interest in wanting to help
out our community," said Sara
Sperling, the LGBCC's graduate
student intern. "It's encouraging
to see that he's willing to advocate
our interests."
Sally Dickson, director of the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment, said Wais' response to the

report "shows the seriousness in
which he and his office take the
issue of lesbian, gay and bisexual
student needs."
Although the Stanford commu
nity in general is supportive of gay,
lesbian and bisexual concerns, Dick
son said, "There are still feelings of
homophobia on campus. We need to
engage in discussions and address
where those feelings come from."
Dickson, who was a member of
tlie working group that issued the
report, said the input of queer stu
dents will continue to be crucial in
the future.
The LGBCC has scheduled a
meeting with Wais, open to any con
cerned students, for next Tuesday
at 6 p.m. in the Women's Gentler.
