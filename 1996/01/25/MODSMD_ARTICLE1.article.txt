# Bikes to get more parking
## 
### Adam Kemezis Contributing writer 
New plans are in the works to
lessen the problems for cyclists
and pedestrians caused by the
shortage of bicycle parking on
campus.
The Stanford Department of
Public Safety aims to step up ef
forts to remove abandoned bikes
locked or chained up around cam
pus.
Dan Smith, special services
manager at the department, said
the plan would target "hikes that
are obviously not going to be dri
ven." He explained that such
"trash bikes" would be identified,
a notice would be posted on them,
and that after 72 hours they
would be removed and given to
charity.
He said he was looking into the
legal possibilities of removing and
impoundingsuch bikes and charg
ing a fine for their recovery, al
though he had no estimate of
what the fine might be. Removals
of both obstructing and aban
doned bikes would be done by "fa
cilitators," who are students em
ployed bv the Department of Pub
lic Safety.
The additional spaces this
would create on existing bike
racks, Smith added, would help al
leviate the other problem his of
fice is working on â€” bikes locked
up in front of doors and on stair
wells and wheelchair ramps.
Asst. Director of Multicultural
Development Rosa Gonzalez said
bikes that obstruct pathways are a
very real problem to the blind and
people in wheelchairs who cannot
get into a building without clear
access to doors, ramps or railings.
