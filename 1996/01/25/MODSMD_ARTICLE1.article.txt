# Bikes to get more parking
## 
### Adam Kemezis Contributing writer 
New plans are in the works to
lessen the problems for cyclists
and pedestrians caused by the
shortage of bicycle parking on
campus.
The Stanford Department of
Public Safety aims to step up ef
forts to remove abandoned bikes
locked or chained up around cam
pus.
Dan Smith, special services
manager at the department, said
the plan would target "hikes that
are obviously not going to be dri
ven." He explained that such
"trash bikes" would be identified,
a notice would be posted on them,
and that after 72 hours they
would be removed and given to
charity.
He said he was looking into the
legal possibilities of removing and
impoundingsuch bikes and charg
ing a fine for their recovery, al
though he had no estimate of
what the fine might be. Removals
of both obstructing and aban
doned bikes would be done by "fa
cilitators," who are students em
ployed bv the Department of Pub
lic Safety.
The additional spaces this
would create on existing bike
racks, Smith added, would help al
leviate the other problem his of
fice is working on — bikes locked
up in front of doors and on stair
wells and wheelchair ramps.
Asst. Director of Multicultural
Development Rosa Gonzalez said
bikes that obstruct pathways are a
very real problem to the blind and
people in wheelchairs who cannot
get into a building without clear
access to doors, ramps or railings.
"It's not just an inconve
nience; it means they're being
denied their civil rights," said
Gonzalez, who is in charge of
helping the University comply
with the 1990 Americans With
Disabilities Act.
She also said she hopes this
quarter to begin educating stu
dents about the problems that
obstructions create for disabled
people.
All involved are confident
that a little education, some
extra parking spaces and a mea
sure of deterrence will lead to
people thinking before they
park their bikes, and very few
bikes will actually have to be
removed.
"We really don't want to get
into the heavy-duty impound
ment business," said Bicycle Pro
gram Coordinator John Ciccarelli.
Other plans call for the bicycle
program at the Transportation
Office to build bike "garages" at
several points on campus this
year.
Ciccarelli said his office
installed racks for 2,000 bikes
last year and is continuing to
expand outdoor space.
The first of several new
garages will open at the Gates
Computer Science Building next
week and will hold about 40
bikes. The bicycle program is
planning to build up to six more
shelters this year at locations on
the w;>st side of campus, possibly
including the Beckman building,
Jordan Quad North and South
and Roble Gym, as well as an
expansion at the Gates building,

Ciccarelli said
The garages would primarily
be used by people who commute
to Stanford by bike from off cam
pus, according to Ciccarelli. He
said 50 percent of the people in
some departments commute by
bicycle.
"We want to do big things for
commuters," he said.
According to Patrick Sieg
man, an administrative assistant
at Facilities Operations, com
muters' bikes tend to be of a
high quality and vulnerable to
theft.
The new garages, Ciccarelli
said, will be similar to the one
already serving the Gilbert and
Herrin buildings. Access to the
garages — described as "covered,
secure enclosed parking spaces"
— will be limited to bicycle com
muters who have an office in
those buildings or use them as
their primary workplace. Garage
users obtain the combination to
the lock from the building man
ager.
Inside the garage, there are
fixtures to which bikes can be fas
tened with a 1 -lock.
Ciccarelli said his eventual
objective is to accommodate all of
Stanford's bicycle commuters
with garages, and that he is look
ing at data from departments to
determine exactly how many
spaces that would require. The
bicycle program has an annual
budget of $650,000, which comes
from the Transportation Office's
funds. The office also is in charge
of the Marguerite shuttle and
other services.
Ciccarelli said he hopes the
cost of the garages per space
would not be more than that of
outdoor racks, which he estimat
ed at $170 per space.
