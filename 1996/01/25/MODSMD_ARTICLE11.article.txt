## Republicans signaling for compromise 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional Republican
leaders invited President Clinton to pursue a modest
package of spending and tax cuts yesterday, signaling
retreat from their long-sought goal of a budget-bal
ancing deal. The White House quickly showed its
interest.
The exchange underlined a desire by both sides to
salvage something from their intractable budget
impasse. Even if the two sides could shake hands on
some savings, it would leave the parties' yearlong con
flict over reshaping Medicare, Medicaid and welfare to
be decided by the voters in this autumn's elections.
"Barring a dramatic change of heart on President
Clinton's part, I don't expect us to get a seven-year bal
anced budget while President Clinton is in office,"
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., told reporters.
"But 1 do think you can take steps."
Gingrich was discussing his plan yesterday evening
with House GOP freshmen, a large, confrontational
group that has Ixhmi adamant all year that they want
nothing less than a seven-year budget-balancing deal.
In th*' search for savings, Gingrich said he hoped
the Republicans and White 1 louse could agree to more
than $100 billion over seven years, plus more than $29
billion in tax cuts for families and businesses. But he
said he would be surprised if Clinton would agree to
more than $50 billion in savings.
In a letter to Clinton, Gingrich and Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., called the savings and (ax
cuts a "down payment" on balancing the budget, and
aid both would be included in legislation extending
the government debt ceiling. The administration has
said tlir government would be forced into a disruptive,
first-ever default bv March 1 if its borrowing authority
is not extended.
On that matter, one of Wall Street's chief credit-rat -
ing agencies threatened yesterday to lower the credit
rating on some U.S. bonds. Moody's Investors Service
said, " The positions being taken in the current debate
over the budget and the debt ceiling have significantly
increased the risk of a default."
In Louisville, Ky., Clinton said he had "a good con
versation" with Gingrich about the Republican lead
ers' proposal. The president made the call, from Air
Force ()ne.
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said
administration officials were encouraged by the GOP
proposal, and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said
the suggestions "are constructive, need to be dis
cussed."
Gingrich said Clinton did not express opposition to
the idea of putting spending and tax cuts on the debt
limit measure and said.
()n a separate track, I louse and Senate Republicans
remained bitterly divided over legislation aimed at
sidestepping a new federal shutdown this weekend.
House conservatives were insisting on banning U.S.
aid to overseas family planning programs that use
abort ions, a provision the more moderate Senate want
ed dropped.
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said
Clinton would veto the bill keeping the government
open if it contained the abortion restrictions.
