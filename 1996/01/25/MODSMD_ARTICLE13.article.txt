# Budget crisis a threat to Wall Street ratings
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” The federal bud
get deadlock drew an ominous warning
yesterday from one of Wall Street's chief
credit-rating services, which threatened
to lower its quality rating on $387 billion
in Treasury debt.
The move by Moody's Investors Ser
vice marked the most dramatic reaction
yet in the financial world over the possi
bility of a first-ever default by the U.S.
government.
Moody's said it was placing Treasury
bonds with interest payments due Feb. 29
and April 6 "on review for possible down
grade."
"The positions being taken in the cur
rent debate over the budget and the debt
ceiling have significantly increased the
risk of a default on the above-mentioned
security obligations," Moody's said.
A downgrade would be a stunning blow
to the government's creditworthiness.
U.S. Treasury bonds are regarded as the
safest in the world because they are
backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States government, which has
never defaulted on its obligations.
Republican leaders who've taken a mil
itant approach to the budget talks had no
immediate comment on Moody's
announcement. Telephone messages left
with House Majority Leader Dick Anney
weren't immediately returned.
Armey, R-Texas, revived the possibili
ty of default as a pressure tactic earlier
this week. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, himself a Republican,
reportedly visited Armey on Tuesday to
repeat his view that America's financial
creditworthiness shouldn't be used as a
bargaining tool.
Democrats called the Moody's move a
reflection of Republican irresponsibility
over the default issue.
"Some of these Republicans are play
ing with fire and everyone could get

burned," said Charles Schumer, a senior
Democrat on the House Banking Com
mittee. "In certain ways, the inmates are
running the asylum here."
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
issued a brief statement expressing his
belief that the debt impasse will be
resolved by the end of February.
The amount under review represents
only a part of the $2.3 trillion of Treasury
debt currently rated Triple-A, the rating
service's highest grade.
Moody's said the possible downgrade
doesn't reflect "any underlying deteriora
tion in the fiscal position of the United
States Government, but rather from the
peculiar circumstances surrounding the
present political controversy over the
direction of federal economic and social
policy."
The Republican-led Congress has said
it might refuse to extend the govern
ment's borrowing authority unless the
Clinton administration capitulates in the
budget brawl, although there were possi
ble signs of conciliation on yesterday.
Rubin has said he has little leeway in
making interest payments and other pay
ments starting late next month unless
the $4.9 trillion debt ceiling is raised by
Congress.
Bond prices lost some of their earlier
sharp gains late yesterday afternoon as
word of the Moody's announcement
spread. But the reaction was muted, part
ly because the announcement represent
ed just a threat.
Standard & Poor's Corp., another lead
ing debt-rating service, made similar
warnings on Nov. 10, when the issue of a
possible default first arose in the budget
negotiations. Still, the wording of the
Moody's announcement was far more
blunt and specific.
S&P expects an announcement within
the next several days.
