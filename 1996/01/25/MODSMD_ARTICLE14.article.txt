Fake fat approved by FDA
WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans will soon
be eating potato chips made with the first zero
calorie artificial fat.
The Food and Drug Administration approved
Procter & Gamble's olestra yesterday, over the
protests of some scientists who called the fake fat
dangerous.
The FDA warned consumers that olestra can
cause such gastrointestinal side effects as diar
rhea and can literally wash out of the body certain
nutrients, particularly when eaten along with that
lunchtime bowl of soup or pile of carrot sticks.
But the FDA concluded that while some people

will find olestra unpleasant, it is safe for the gen
oral population to eat in potato chips and other
snack foods — as long as the foods bear a label
warning of those side effects.
Wells Fargo takes over
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Wells Fargo & Co.,
a bonk with roots in the Wild West, won a corpo
rate' shootout yesterday for control of First Inter
state Bancorp with a hostile $ 11.0 billion bid that
is the richest ever in banking history.
As a result of the combination, 350 bank offices
will close in California, eliminating thousands of
jobs. But the combined bank, the eighth largest in

the United States, is promising $45 billion in loans
and investments in low-income areas in the next
10 years, estimating that will create 715,000 new
jobs.
There had been estimates of 7,000 lost jobs in
the merger, but the banks said that was too high
"Jobs are certainly an issue, 1 won't sugarcoat
it," Wells Fargo Chairman Paul Hazen said during
a press conference in Los Angeles.
Hazen and First Interstate chairman William
E.B. Siart said it is too early to say which branch
es would close or what regions might be hardest
hit. Without elaborating on (he exact number of
jobs to be cut, Hazen said the layoffs would be
spread equally between both banks.
