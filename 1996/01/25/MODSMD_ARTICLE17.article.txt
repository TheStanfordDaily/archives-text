COP and other parts
of ASSU must follow
lead of business side

IT HAS BEEN said that those
who can't do, teach. This
maxim, while admittedly a lit
tle inappropriate in a university
setting, could increasingly be
applied to this year's Council of
Presidents.
The COP's biggest achievement
this year seems to be the creation
of a new course entitled "Student
Governance and the Multicultural
University," taught by COP mem
bers Rich Stolz and Nicole
Vazquez. The class aims to "intro
duce students to the many factors
involved in student politics at
Stanford," according to the syl
labus, and promises to "train stu
dents in community-organizing
techniques, multicultural sensi
tivity and organizational models."
Elected to improve the lives of
the entire student body, the COP
is wasting its time on a class which
fewer than a dozen students are
taking. Its goals — to "demystify"
the ASSU, introduce students to
University politics and make stu
dents more aware of available
groups — are too vague to say
whether the class will have any
beneficial effect.
In addition, students, for their
final projects, are expected to
"take on an issue of relevance to
the association and compile a
report on this issue," according to
the syllabus. These issues include
funding for the ethnic centers,
minimizing tuition increases and
examining Residential Education
— all things which the COP mem
bers, in their roles as student body
presidents, are expected to
research and address themselves.
Nowhere in the syllabus does it
say whether the projects will be
used by the COP, but one can
probably assume that COP mem

hers won't throw the work away.
We can only hope they give more
recognition than two units of
directed reading to the students
who do the research for them.
The only other visible thing the
COP has done this year is dis
tribute dorm surveys to gauge stu
dent reactions on various issues
— a step in the right direction,
granted, but only if it acts on the
results. If the COP has done more,
its constituents have yet to hear
about its efforts or achievements.
In contrast, the financial side of
the ASSU has had an extremely
active year already — making
changes that the majority of stu
dents con use and, in most cases,
are using.
The association's business lead
ership has worked with SCBN to
create Tele Flicks, nightly show
ings of big-name movies on a net
work accessible to anyone on cam
pus. It has made two much-need
ed improvements to the special
fee refund system: paying refunds
through the University bill rather
than spending extra money on
cutting checks; and, more recent
ly, putting the entire fee refund
application onto the World Wide
Web to increase student accessibil
ity.
Only halfway through the year,
the ASSU's financial side has bro
ken away from the bureaucracy
that has slowed it in previous
years. We see no reason why the
executive branch cannot do the
same.
Only half a year remains. The
COP must stop and evaluate its
focus now. Are COP members
making tangible changes for the
better, like their financial counter
parts? Or are they simply practic
ing the kind of business-as-usual
which turns people away from stu
dent government in the first place?
If it's the latter, then no amount of
teaching will fix the problem.
Teaching is noble, but when it
comes to governance, there is no
substitute for action. Anyone
leading a class on the subject
should know at least that much.
