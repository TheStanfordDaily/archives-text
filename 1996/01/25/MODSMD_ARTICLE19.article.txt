# Jon Ganz and Rand Blackford
## Those consulting fools 
### 
ONCE AGAIN, IT'S that magical
time of the year when spring
peeks its cute, cupid head around
the corner and young men and women's
minds suddenly stray from academics.
We don't mean their fancies turn to love
and romance and the occasional beer-gog
gled misadventure. No, no, NO! Some
thing even more tantalizing.
That's right. — Bain, Goldman Sachs,
BCG, Silicon Valley, Microsoft, McKin
sey, Cornerstone and the rest of the soul
sucking bandits are comin' to town. We
fill our days with late-night chats over
microbrews, arguing over appropriate J.
Crew garb for "informational meetings"
at the Blue Chalk, swapping paisley-pat
terned resumes and discussing in fren
zied anticipation the first-round inter
view. The bookstore teems with purchas
es of "Interview Tactics That'll Knock
'Em Out and Net You Six Figures" and
those little brown leather folder-thingies.
But all of this preparation verges on
being gratuitous. Trust us. We've actually
been there in the trenches of interview war
fare. We've seen the mangled flesh, experi
enced the agony and defeat of being rudely
declined a third-round interview. But, we
also understand the orgasmic triumph one
experiences upon receiving a job oiler at a
cocktail party at the Stanford I Intel.
Sleep easy. We have condensed all of
our experiences into a compelling, yet
terse column. We have found that the fol
lowing questions pop up a lot. Do not kid
yourself that there are many correct
answers — ours are the only correct ones.

Memorize them.
Where do you envision yourself in 5-
10 years?
In the mirror.
What is your greatest strength?
Stapling; I have won several awards. I am
also a people person.
What do you fear the most?
One baby in 10 trash cans. I really want
to work for you. Did I mention I got an A
in Math 43?
How was Stanford?
He was great. I mean, I never knew him
personally, but I'll bet he was a great
man. He's older than my dad.
Why did you choose art history if you
want to work for (insert name of
random consulting firm)?
I am excited by the fast-paced dynamic
world of opportunities at (the firm). Out
rageous remuneration and the process of
consultation fascinate me. I can also col
late.
How do you feel about working 1 la
bour weeks for two years straight?
Excited! I thrive in a fast-paced dynamic
work environment. My stamina is
unprecedented.
Do you thrive on caffeine?
I thrive in fast-paced dynamic work envi
ronments.
How many licks does it take to get to
the center of a Tootsie Fop?
Funny you should mention licking. Can I
lick your boots?
Can you converse only in buzz
words?

Affirmative, client-interface meetings
and on-site project analysis create a sus
tainable, fast-paced dynamic work envi
ronment. So there.
Who would you have dinner with if
you could choose anyone in the
world?
God. I have a few nagging questions
about the platypus.
What is pi to the 16th decimal place?
I opt for the physical challenge. Did I
mention I was good at stapling?
You have three glasses of water. One
is five ounces. The second is a liter.
The third is a shot glass. Measure pi
ounces. You have one minute. 1
remind you there are a lot of other
qualified applicants.
(This is a trick question. They want to see
how you deal under pressure. Instead,
take a mouthful of water and gargle.)
Ficard or Kirk? Defend your
answer.
(This is another trick question. They
didn't mention that new female captain
on Star Trek Voyager — you sexist pig!)
What do you hope to get from this job?
1 hope to get relevant work experience
and exposure to a number of business
fields while at the same time artfully
avoiding the nascent cocaine addiction
that seems to inflict others at your firm.
Look again at the title, read it fast and
then slowly. It's good for an extra laugh.
