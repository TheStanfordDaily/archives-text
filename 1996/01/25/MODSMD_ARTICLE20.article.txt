Visitor to Stanford relates to Daily column on rankings

AS A VISITOR to your campus hist
week, and as a Reed College gradu
ate, I was interested to read Tony
Small's column regarding the U.S. News &
World Report rankings. While his com
ments in reference to the administration's
action regarding the Early Decision pro
gram, instated to raise Stanford's ranking
in the magazine, were certainly warranted,
I wanted to make you aware of some addi
tional information regarding that ranking.
Last year, Reed College refused to par

ticipate in the survey. For several years
prior to this act, the college had ongoing
discussions with the U.S. News honchos
regarding the statistics used to rank
schools. Those statistics are unfavorable to
small libertd-arts colleges such as Reed
because of the way they are calculated, and
Reed was generally ranked lower on the
scale than it deserved (if I do say so
myself).
But one of the biggest factors in the col
lege president's decision not to return the

survey w;is the fact that apparently many
colleges flat-out lie on the surveys to
change their rankings. The survey, appar
ently, is just a form sent to the college,
which the college fills out with numbers
like the average SAT score for entering
students, etc. There is no verification
made on these numbers.
There was some legal wrangling sur
rounding Reed's refusal to return the sur
vey. I don't remember the exact details,
but basically, U.S. News threatened to sue

to compel the college to cooperate. The
Reed lawyer shot back that U.S. News
could not legally do so.
It might interest you to know that U.S.
News not only did not rank Reed, but sin
gled us out in a special mention as having
refused to cooperate, the exact quote I do
not remember. A full report on this inci
dent was given in the Reed College alumni
magazine several quarters ago.
