# Student says The Daily's editorial lauding quick response was mistaken

Often, during memorable events,
individuals will distinguish themselves
without regard for recognition or even
a gold star. Difficult circumstances
have a way of throwing forward people
whose actions truly make a difference.
While the great power outage of 1995
isn't on the level of the Blizzard of '96
or even the mad Cabbage Patch Rush
of '82, it certainly tested the mettle of
a good many students, not to mention
their sanitv. Anyone who braved a

freezing shower and found themselves
stuck studying for a final by candle
light will know what I'm talking about.
That's why I was particularly dis
mayed by The Daily's recent editorial
lauding the University administration
for its "fast and effective" response.
While it is true that the University did
distribute much-needed blankets and
flashlights and provided free dining
services (well, two out of three isn't
bad), it certainly was not fast.
What actually happened was that
after 24 hours of shivering in darkness
without food, a student by the name of
Sara DeWitt took it upon herself to see
why the University had not done any
thing to alleviate the situation. The

power went out Tuesday morning. By
Wednesday afternoon, Sara was on the
line with University President Ger
hard Casper's office, which referred
her to the housing office. As a direct
result of her efforts, the administra
tion finally got its act together.
Perhaps inertia was the cause of the
initial lack of action. Whatever the rea
son, things get started only after Sara
acted as the gadfly. Of course, not too
many people know about this, and
judging by last Wednesday's congratu
latory editorial, neither does The Daily
Some would say that the power out
age wasn't Stanford's fault and thus
the University is under no particular
obligation to help affected students.

These people should bear in mind that
nearly every student writes out a nice,
fat check to the order of Stanford Uni
versity at the beginning of each quar
ter. Whether it was PG & E's fault or
the fault of the University, Stanford
must meet the obligations that stu
dents have already paid for. This
should be done on a self-initiated basis
and not because one determined and
frustrated student had had enough of
stumbling in the dark, trying to find a
can of Spaghetti O's to go with her
Nilla Wafers.
Kudos to Sara DeWitt for a job well
done.
