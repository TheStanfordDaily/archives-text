## Women's basketball to meet Washington Perfect Pac-10 record on the line 
### Bobby Cuza Staff writer 
Midterms are still a week or two away
for most Stanford students, but it's exam
time once again tonight for the sixth
ranked women's basketball team.

It's tough [playing OSU
and Washington back-to
back].'

Last Saturday, the Cardinal saw how
well it matched up with one of the Pacific
10 Conference's best teams in a show
down against then-No. 12 Oregon State.
But in the rough-and-tumble world of
women's hoops, there's no time for admir
ing past achievements. Tonight at 7 p.m.
in Maples Pavilion, Stanford must prove
itself once again when it meets Washing
ton — second in the conference standings
at 4-1 — in another clash of Pac-10 pow
ers.
"It's tough [playing OSU and Washing
ton back-to-back]," said head coach Amy
Tucker. "But I think we're ready. This is
what we prepare for all year."
With a 6-0 record in conference play
(13-2 overall), the Cardinal finds itself
perched rather comfortably atop the Pac
-10 standings. Oregon State is mired in a
three-way tie for fourth place at 3-2, while
IJSC — billed as a legitimate contender at
the beginning of the season— has slipped
to seventh after a 2-4 start in Pac-10 play-
Only Washington (10-6) — half a game
behind the Cardinal — poses an immedi
ate threat.
Stanford could go a long way towards
eliminating that threat with a victory
tonight. To do so, the Cardinal must keep
an eye on the Huskies' fabulous freshman
duo of Jamie Redd and Malinda Lynch.
Redd, a 5-foot 9 guard who worked her
way into the starting lineup almost
immediately at the start of the season,

leads the Huskies in scoring with a 14.9
points-per-game average. Lynch, mean
while, has started 10 of the 15 games
she's appeared in and is Washington's
second-leading rebounder with 5.9 boards
per game.
The loss of six players from a 1994-95
squad that compiled a '25-9 overall record,
finished second in the Pac-10 and won
two games in the NCAA Tournament
forced the Huskies to rely on their fresh
men. Along with fellow freshmen Amber
Hall and Molly Hills, Washington's first
year players have accounted for 41 per
cent of the Huskies' total point produc
tion.

is what we prepare for all
year.'

"We look different this year," said
Washington head coach Chris Gobrecht.
"The team ihasl a completely different
personality."
With seven wins in its last eight games,
the Huskies look forward to another solid
campaign. But success hasn't come easily.
Washington, which began the season
ranked 25th, lost its first four games by a
combined 45 points and placed seventh in
an eight-team field at the Kona Tourna
ment in Hawaii.
Gobrecht, however, has managed to
turn the season around in much the same
way she turned around the Husky pro
gram after her arrival in Seattle 11 years
ago. Washington has advanced to the
NCAA tourney in 10 of those 11 years
while capturing three conference titles.
And while teams like Oregon State and
USC have made noise in recent years with
flashy, big-name players, Washington has
been quietly establishing itself as one of
the most consistently successful programs
