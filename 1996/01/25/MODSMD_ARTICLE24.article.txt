The original, unabridged ver
sion of the 1996 Cardinal
wrestling (earn is almost back
and ready to take down Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo and UC-
Davis on the road this weekend.
Senior team leader Tod Sur
rnon (150 pounds), out for the
past few weeks with a sprained
knee, has finally returned to bol
ster the Cardinal's injury-rid
dled roster. Surmon ranks first
in the Pacific 10 Conference and
fifth in the nation in his weight
clans.
Before his injury, Surmon
rolled over his opponents, com
piling a 9-0 record. With his
return, the Cardinal will field its
best lineup since the beginning
of the season.
"I'm really glad to be back,"
Surmon said. "I'm feeling good
and I've been going really hard
in practice. I'm ready for compe
tition."
As for Surmon's aspirations
for a national title, little has
changed as a result of his injury.
"There is still a month-and-a
half before the [Pacific 10 Con
ference] tournament," Surmon
said. "I've got to improve my
conditioning. Other than that,
everything is working fine. Its
still my goal and plan to be vic

torious at the NCAA tourna
ment at year's end."
Although the Cardinal wel
comes the resurgence of its lead
er, Surmon's back-up has per
formed well the past three
weeks. Freshman Doug Bards
ley (150) ended his impressive
two-win streak last week with a
6-4 loss to Cal St ate-Bakers
field's Tony DeSouza, the
defending Pac-10 champion at
150 pounds.
Surmon's recovery does not
come as the week's only high
light for Stanford. Despite its
three-meet losing skid, the Car
dinal has made some si/able
improvements in the past week
of practice. "The team has
rebounded ... as I had hoped,"
said 17th-year head coach C'hris
Horpel. "They have really
increased their intensity during
workouts and have made quite a
jump in their conditioning and
technique. I feel good about the
progress they have made in the
last week."
Despite all the favorable
news, the Cardinal has two
strong opponents to tackle. Cal
Poly boasts a formidable dual
meet team. The Mustangs have
amassed a 6-3 record, recently
capturing victories against
Pacific, Portland State and Ore-

gon. The Ducks are among the
Pac-10's most talented.
Horpel acknowledged that CaJ
Poly will not prove easy, but he
believes his team has a good shot
at victory. "I think we have a
legitimate shot at winning five or
six matches against (the Mus
tangs)," he said.
UC-Davis is also a force to be
reckoned with. Although the Car
dinal beat the Aggies by a decisive
32-9 margin in their Nov. 17 dual
meet at Burnham Pavilion, the
Aggies are improving at a fast
pace and could present a real
challenge this time around.
The Cardinal starting lineup
shifted somewhat this week as
sophomore Scott Chapman
jumped up to the 177-pound
weight class and freshman Van
Young replaced him in the 167
pound slot, starting for the first
time in his young career.
Senior starter Sahlan Martin
(158) is still out with ;i necS
sprain. Sophomore 177-poum
starter Jason Gladden recently
sprained his ankle.
