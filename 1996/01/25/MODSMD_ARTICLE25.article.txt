# Men's hoops invades U of W
## Knight, Poppink try to solve road mystery 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Amid the high-fiving and back-slapping fol
lowing Stanford's 84-51 win over Oregon State
last Saturday night, a grave look came across
junior Brevin Knight's face when the question
of playing on the road came up.
"We won't lose two, I promise you that,"
Knight said, still seething long after dropping
both games during Stanford's Los Angeles road
trip two weeks ago. "No way I'm going any
where else on a road trip and losing two games."
That promise will certainly be put to the test
against Washington (10-4 overall, 3-2 Pacific 10
Conference) and Washington State (8-5, 1-4)
today and Saturday, respectively. The Ever
green State has proven notoriously difficult for
the Cardinal in recent history, as Stanford has
lost at least one game on the Washington road
trip the past six years.
In regard to Washington, history is on Stan
ford's side, as the No. 25 Cardinal (10-4, 4-2)
has captured four in a row over the Huskies.
However, Washington has a bit of tradition
running in its veins as well, as the Huskies are
off to their best start since 1985.
The rejuvenation of Washington basketball
comes mostly from third-year coach Hob Ben
der's passion for the game. It also doesn't hurt
to have a player like high-flying forward Mark
Sanford, either.
The 6-foot-8, 200-pound sophomore from
Dallas, Texas gives the Huskies a legitimate
star for the first time since Detlef Schrempf and
Christian Welp guided Washington to the
NCAA Tournament in the mid-1980s.
Sanford ranks fifth in the Pac-10 in scoring
(18.8 points per game) and also averages 5.5
rebounds per game. In conference play, tie ups
his scoring average to 20.(5. He has recorded
two of the top four scoring performances in the
conference so far this year, twice tallying 35
points.
"He moves around pretty well," said senior
forward Andy Poppink, who draws the defen
sive assignment for the Huskies' top dawg. "I
just have to stay close to him and let him know
I'm there at all times, which probably will
include being a little physical with him when he
gets near the basket."

Arizona State.
Two seven-footers provide
Washington with a potentially
giant presence in the middle. Red
shirt freshman Todd MacCulloch
(270 pounds) and freshman
Patrick Femerling (225 pounds)
each play approximately 12 min
utes a game in conference action.
Senior Mike Amos (6-9, 260) has
also seen time in the pivot and
gives the Huskies more experi
ence down low.
Despite such size, Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery is
not overly worried about mis
matches because of the physical
strength of his veterans, Poppink
and senior Darren Allaway.
Like Stanford, Washington
starts a three-guard lineup featur
ing point guard Jason Hamilton,
shooter Bryant Boston and swing
man Jamie Booker. Although
Booker often earns the label of
defensive stopper, all three play
ers are excellent defenders, help
ing the Huskies lead the confer
ence in steals at 10.8 per game.
Boston is the only other dou
ble-figure scorer for Washington,
averaging 14.7 per game. Hamil
ton's 50 percent three-point
shooting percentage (14-28) is
second in tin l league.
On paper, the Huskies may
seem like a team that won't pre
sent many problems for Stanford.
Nothing could be further from
the truth, however, according to
Montgomery.
"There's no specific thing," he
$aid. "They are just playing very
good basketball. They are defending
very well, they're using good .judg
ment on offense, they are getting
good contributions from eight or
nine players, but nothing spectacu
lar. They're hard to beat because
they don't beat themselves."
Montgomery's words sound
similar to what coaches have been
saying about the Cardinal for the
past few years. Indeed, the styles
of both teams reflect attention to
fundamentals and touirh defenses

that trigger the teams' offenses.
Defensively, the Huskies lead
the Pac-10 in fewest points sur
rendered at H5.(5 (the Cardinal
remains a close second at 66.2)
and forced turnovers (21.9 per
game). It may not be pretty, but
Bender has infused a fighting
spirit into the Huskies and has
them looking for their first post
season bid in nine years.
"They've got a taste of it,"
Montgomery said. "They are sell

ing out the games. They're 10-4
and have a real chance to make a
move and be in the top half of the
conference."
Like most Pac-10 teams,
Washington is tough at home,
posting an 8-1 record in Hec
Edmundson Pavilion this season.
At home, the Huskies average
78.4 points per game, but like
Stanford, the Huskies drop off on
the road, scoring only 64.2 a
game.

Montgomery said. "They are sell

ing out the games. They're 10-4
and have a real chance to make a
move and be in the top half of the
conference."
Like most Pac-10 teams,
Washington is tough at home,
posting an 8-1 record in Hec
Edmundson Pavilion this season.
At home, the Huskies average
78.4 points per game, but like
Stanford, the Huskies drop off on
the road, scoring only 64.2 a
game.
