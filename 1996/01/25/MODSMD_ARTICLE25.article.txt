# Men's hoops invades U of W
## Knight, Poppink try to solve road mystery 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Amid the high-fiving and back-slapping fol
lowing Stanford's 84-51 win over Oregon State
last Saturday night, a grave look came across
junior Brevin Knight's face when the question
of playing on the road came up.
"We won't lose two, I promise you that,"
Knight said, still seething long after dropping
both games during Stanford's Los Angeles road
trip two weeks ago. "No way I'm going any
where else on a road trip and losing two games."
That promise will certainly be put to the test
against Washington (10-4 overall, 3-2 Pacific 10
Conference) and Washington State (8-5, 1-4)
today and Saturday, respectively. The Ever
green State has proven notoriously difficult for
the Cardinal in recent history, as Stanford has
lost at least one game on the Washington road
trip the past six years.
In regard to Washington, history is on Stan
ford's side, as the No. 25 Cardinal (10-4, 4-2)
has captured four in a row over the Huskies.
However, Washington has a bit of tradition
running in its veins as well, as the Huskies are
off to their best start since 1985.
The rejuvenation of Washington basketball
comes mostly from third-year coach Hob Ben
der's passion for the game. It also doesn't hurt
to have a player like high-flying forward Mark
Sanford, either.
The 6-foot-8, 200-pound sophomore from
Dallas, Texas gives the Huskies a legitimate
star for the first time since Detlef Schrempf and
Christian Welp guided Washington to the
NCAA Tournament in the mid-1980s.
Sanford ranks fifth in the Pac-10 in scoring
(18.8 points per game) and also averages 5.5
rebounds per game. In conference play, tie ups
his scoring average to 20.(5. He has recorded
two of the top four scoring performances in the
conference so far this year, twice tallying 35
points.
"He moves around pretty well," said senior
forward Andy Poppink, who draws the defen
sive assignment for the Huskies' top dawg. "I
just have to stay close to him and let him know
I'm there at all times, which probably will
include being a little physical with him when he
gets near the basket."
