# Olympic hopefuls return to the Farm
## Grote, Retterer and Kanner train with men's swim team

The 1996 Summer Olympic
Games are just around the corner,
and few people are more aware of
that fact than the Stanford men's
swimming team. The approach of
the Olympic Trials, which will
take place March 6-12, has not
only affected the competition
schedule, training, mental prepa
ration and practices of Stanford
swimmers, but it has also brought
Stanford graduates back to train
with the team.
Along with several members of
the current Cardinal team, and
some older alumni, three leaders
from last year's Stanford squad —
Kurt Grote, Brian Retterer and
Dan Kanner — have been train
ing throughout the 1995-96 sea
son for the trials. The three swim
mers, who played integral roles on
the Cardinal's last three national
championship teams, enjoy quite
an edge over other post-graduates
training for the Olympics because
of their Stanford affiliations.
They can take advantage of Stan
ford facilities, the opportunity to
train with other individuals who
share the same goals and the
guidance of Skip Kenney, head
coach of both the Stanford and
the U.S. men's swimming teams.
"You're surrounded by a group
of guys focused on the same
thing," said Kanner, who had con

sidered training at home with a
local club. "It's rare to have such
a talented group. We get the all
around program. We get motiva
tion and stroke techniques, good
coaching, a team doctor and the
team physical therapist. I'm sur
rounded with a winning attitude."
"It's a huge benefit," Grote
said. "You get a lot of input from
the other guys on the team, and
you work a lot harder when oth
ers are pushing you. We have a lot
of experience among us, and we
feed on that."

While the three members of
the Class of '95 emphasize their
appreciation of the opportunities
afforded them, Kenney appreci
ates the impact Grote, Kanner
and Retterer have had on his
younger swimmers.
"They're great role models
because their work ethic is so
good," Kenney said. "They never
miss and they're always on time.
They're always there to answer
questions, and not a day goes by
that one of the other guys doesn't
ask for help. And the more teach

ing they do, the more opportunity
they have to learn."
At this juncture, however,
there is not much time to learn.
Grote, Retterer and Kanner have
all spent the last year focusing on
one thing — making the Olympic
Team. Their chance to realize
that goal is now less than six
weeks away.
A year ago around this time,
Grote, who had been admitted to
Stanford Medical School, was not
