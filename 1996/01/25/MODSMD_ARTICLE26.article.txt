# Olympic hopefuls return to the Farm
## Grote, Retterer and Kanner train with men's swim team 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
The 1996 Summer Olympic
Games are just around the corner,
and few people are more aware of
that fact than the Stanford men's
swimming team. The approach of
the Olympic Trials, which will
take place March 6-12, has not
only affected the competition
schedule, training, mental prepa
ration and practices of Stanford
swimmers, but it has also brought
Stanford graduates back to train
with the team.
Along with several members of
the current Cardinal team, and
some older alumni, three leaders
from last year's Stanford squad —
Kurt Grote, Brian Retterer and
Dan Kanner — have been train
ing throughout the 1995-96 sea
son for the trials. The three swim
mers, who played integral roles on
the Cardinal's last three national
championship teams, enjoy quite
an edge over other post-graduates
training for the Olympics because
of their Stanford affiliations.
They can take advantage of Stan
ford facilities, the opportunity to
train with other individuals who
share the same goals and the
guidance of Skip Kenney, head
coach of both the Stanford and
the U.S. men's swimming teams.
"You're surrounded by a group
of guys focused on the same
thing," said Kanner, who had con

sidered training at home with a
local club. "It's rare to have such
a talented group. We get the all
around program. We get motiva
tion and stroke techniques, good
coaching, a team doctor and the
team physical therapist. I'm sur
rounded with a winning attitude."
"It's a huge benefit," Grote
said. "You get a lot of input from
the other guys on the team, and
you work a lot harder when oth
ers are pushing you. We have a lot
of experience among us, and we
feed on that."

While the three members of
the Class of '95 emphasize their
appreciation of the opportunities
afforded them, Kenney appreci
ates the impact Grote, Kanner
and Retterer have had on his
younger swimmers.
"They're great role models
because their work ethic is so
good," Kenney said. "They never
miss and they're always on time.
They're always there to answer
questions, and not a day goes by
that one of the other guys doesn't
ask for help. And the more teach

ing they do, the more opportunity
they have to learn."
At this juncture, however,
there is not much time to learn.
Grote, Retterer and Kanner have
all spent the last year focusing on
one thing — making the Olympic
Team. Their chance to realize
that goal is now less than six
weeks away.
A year ago around this time,
Grote, who had been admitted to
Stanford Medical School, was not

Olympics.
even sure if he would try out for
the Olympic Team. Though he
emerged as a tremendously suc
cessful NCAA champion in col
lege, he remained uncertain
where the future would take him.
However, after taking a couple of
months off and swimming well
during the summer, Grote
returned to Stanford this season
with a sponsorship from Nike
and an eye on the trials.
Now, for Grote, it is just a
matter (if completing his train
ing. "I've been training better
than I've ever trained before," he

said. "I've been doing some extra
weights and biking. Now I'm
going to start focusing and get
ting a little more race-specific,
trying to get my lifetime best.
"I'm starting to get a little bit
excited. I don't really anticipate
getting nervous, just excited."
Unlike Grote, Retterer has
been preparing for the 1996 trials
ever since he participated in the
1992 trials. Having tried out
before, he has a fairly clear idea
of what he needs to improve.
"Last time I was at the trials, I
let myself get too caught up in
other people's swims," he said.
"This time, I want to focus on not
getting distracted and saving all
of my energy for my race (the
100-meter backstroke)."

The story of the season for
Retterer has been focus. He has
spent more time this year on aer
obic training, as Olympic courses
are longer than NCAA courses.
"Mentally, I've really tried to
keep focused on what I'm doing,"
he said. "When I get to trials, I
want to know I've done every
thing I can to get ready. And at
this point, I have done everything
I wanted to do."
Like Retterer, Kanner swam
in the 1992 trials and is deter
mined to compete in the 1996
Olympics.
"I remember coming out of
high school and finishing ninth
while they take six guys," Kanner
said. "I remember thinking,
'When I swim in '96, I'll be the

best.
For the past year, Kanner has
been doing all that he can to
establish himself as the best.
When he was in high school, his
coach (and father) pushed him to
swim 3,000 meters in 30 minutes
to get himself in excellent physi
cal shape. Last fall, he accom
plished this feat.
"I'm stronger and more expe
rienced," Kanner said. "Now I am
focused on making the team. It is
the pinnacle of competitive swim
ming. When I think about it, I
think about what an incredible
feeling it'll be."
As with the other two swim
mers, Kanner must now focus on
perfecting the little things that
will help him to swim at his best.

"Right now, I need to get a sense
of my internal clock so I can
know what pace I want to swim
and do it,"he said. "It's just men
tal preparation — fine-tuning of
your body and resting. When I
get there, I expect to be so pre
pared that I don't get nervous."
Kenney believes that Kanner,
as well as Retterer and Grote, are
well prepared.
"So far. they're doing the right
thing in practice, and I see noth
ing but good things and positive
things day in and day out," he
said. "The way they're swimming
in meets, the way they're train
ing in practice — they're right on
schedule. Their mental approach
on the day of their race will deter
mine their success."
