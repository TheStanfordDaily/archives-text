# Women's gymnastics heads to the desert
## No. 13 Stanford to challenge Wildcats, Bruins in Pac-10 meets 
### Keith Rabkin 
The No. 13 Stanford women's gymnastics
team will try to preserve its undefeated record
tomorrow at Arizona when it challenges last
year's Pacific 10 Conference champions, the
fourth-ranked UCLA Bruins, and the seventh
ranked Arizona Wildcats. The three teams will
meet to determine who is the best in the Pac-10.
Tomorrow's contest should prove signifi
cantly more difficult for the Cardinal than
Stanford's last meet against UC-Davis.
"UCLA and Arizona are two of the top teams
in the league," said Cardinal head coach Lisa
Izzi. "They will be much more difficult to
defeat with their large core of juniors and
seniors than UC-Davis."
Arizona hopes to rebound from its third
loss in four games. Four-time Pac-10 Coach of
the Year Jim Gault will field a formidable
Wildcat squad, led by Becky Bowers, a 1995
All Pac-10 selection and the favorite in the

uneven bars. Bowers, who has scored a perfect
10.0 on the bars in previous competitions, will
receive help from all-around competitor Tenli
Poggemeyer.
The Cardinal must also stop a hot Bruins
team, which after losing to Cal State-Fuller
ton, rebounded to defeat Boise State. Four
time AU-American Stella Umeh will try to cap
ture her second-consecutive all-around com
petition after scoring a 38.750 last week
against Boise State. Leah Homma and Kristin
Harmell will provide consistency on the vault
and uneven bars. Together with freshman
Kiralee Hayashi, the Bruins feature a well
balanced team that will put the Cardinal to
the test.
However, Stanford boasts talent of its own.
Izzi will look to sophomores Misty Moore and
Keri Monahan to spearhead the Cardinal to
victory. Monahan won the all-around competi
tion against UC-Davis last weekend, while
Moore finished a close second. Monahan will

also look to continue her dominance on the
vault as Moore tries to win her second-straight
floor-exercise title.
The Cardinal won't change its routines sig
nificantly, but will nevertheless make adjust
ments. "Our floor routines need some work,"
Izzi said, "but we hope to come out challeng
ing the tough competition and to make the
meet close."
Although the Wildcats and Bruins carry
more athletes than the Cardinal, Stanford
hopes its sheer skill and determination will
make up the difference. After crushing the
Aggies, Stanford gymnasts are excited about
their upcoming challenge and are ready to add
another win to the Cardinal's record.
The strong opposition at the Arizona meet
will also serve as a measuring stick to see how
the Cardinal stacks up in the Pac-10. A victo
ry at tomorrow's meet will show that the Car
dinal can defeat the best the league has to
offer.
