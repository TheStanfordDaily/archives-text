# Research rules may be relaxed
## Faculty looks to outside funds

Stanford re
searchers may
be able to col
laborate more
with outside in
dustry as result
of a proposed
change to the
University poli
cy on research

jlijj

participation agreements.
The change — a recommenda
tion from the Committee on Re
search — will be debated at
today's Faculty Senate meeting.
The committee hopes to simpli
fy the administrative procedure
for outside companies or other
groups to use Stanford's equip
ment and facilities by revising the
Preparation, Review and Submis
sion of Sponsored Project Propos
als policy from 1979.
While not prohibiting such
agreements with outside re
searchers, the 1979 policy dis
couraged them.
But faced with federal cuts to
research funding and few other
sources of money, Stanford must

open its facilities to outsiders and
the money they can bring in, said
Committee on Research Chair
Robert Ryer, an applied physics
professor.
The original policy was "quite
negative about University faculty
and students interacting with in
dustries and other universities,"
Ryer said. "If we wanted to have a
company come in and work using
Stanford facilities, it could do so,
but there were a great deal of ad
ministrative hurdles that could
come in."
A research participation agree
ment must be completed whenev
er the services of Stanford person
nel, academic facilities or labora
tory equipment are used by an
outside party. Generally, Stanford
employees or students do the
work on the project.
Stanford has a number of
unique facilities that are appeal
ing to researchers outside the
University, Ryer said.
For example, Stanford is the
home of both "measurement
equipment that's unique ... and
expertise that may reside in how
to use specialized equipment," he
said.
Maintaining such equipment is
expensive, however, Byer added.
With less money coming in from
Washington, scientists find it
harder to argue that the Univer
sity should spend the necessary
money to maintain the equip
ment.
At the same time, years of
Stanford research and expertise

would be lost without it. "It's
expensive to maintain and oper
ate but absolutely crucial for fac
ulty, graduate students and even
undergraduates to continue their
research," Byer said.
The policy change, he said,
"allows us to support a greater
range of research facilities on cam
pus so the students and faculty can
work with first-rate equipment."
According to the revised policy,
several criteria must be met by
outside users, including disclo
sure of possible resulting patents
and compliance with any restric
tions placed bv the source which

paid for the building or equip
ment being used.
Byer said he expects to find lit
tle opposition to the proposed pol
icy at today's meeting although
there is "always concern that the
University might be getting too
closely associated with other labo
ratories or institutes."
Also on the agenda are a report
from the Steering Committee clar
ifying the general undergraduate
education requirements and a dis
cussion of the future of the Plan
ning and Policy Board and the
implications of its recent report .
Further discussion of the

report, titled "Planning in an Era
of Change," which was released
two weeks ago, may be divided
into three areas, said Senate
Chair Gail Mahood, a professor of
geological and environmental sci
ences.
Discussion will center on how
departments are evaluated and
whether one evaluation technique
can be used in a number of differ
ent situations; on who takes
responsibility for training of doc
toral students and its funding; and
on the role of tenure-line faculty in
teaching classes for freshmen and
sophomores.
