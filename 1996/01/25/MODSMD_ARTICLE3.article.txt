But faced with federal cuts to

The original policy was "quite

and students interacting with in
dustries and other universities,"
Ryer said. "If we wanted to have a
company come in and work using
Stanford facilities, it could do so,
but there were a great deal of ad
ministrative hurdles that could
come in."
A research participation agree
ment must be completed whenev

tory equipment are used by an
outside party. Generally, Stanford
employees or students do the
work on the project.
Stanford has a number of
