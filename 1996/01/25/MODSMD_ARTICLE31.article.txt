# THE 						MOUNTAIN GOATS

Gnside the sleeve of the Mountain Goats'
■ new album, there's a short essay about
"Sweden, particularly about that coun
try's clever knack for "obscuring their
true nature." The Mountain Goats ex
plain, "Everything about the Scandina
vian country, from its understatedly sim
ple tlag design to its studious neutrality in
both World Wars, has been carefully craft
ed to lull us into accepting the Swedes as a
nation of cheery blue-eyed blondes with
nothing better to do than sip aquavit and
eat smorgasbord. Nothing could be fur
ther from the truth."
The clincher comes at the end: "Even
the Swedish Chef himself, long a staple on
The Muppet Show,' was not fully what he
seemed: Close inspection reveals that he
was the only Muppet to have human
hands rather than Muppet hands, an
anomaly that has never been satisfactori
ly explained and whose secret apparently
went to the grave with honorary Swede
Jim Henson in 1990."

Mountain Goats also
i- are not what they seem. They cre-
what appear to he simple folk
songs with minimal instrumentation,

yet they are
never "mellow."
In the words of
singer / guitarist
John Darnielle,
they're "a punk
rock hand with
out a drummer
or an clectric
guitar." Beneath

their basic melodic appeal, songs carry
meaning in their own wrenching emo
tional code, typically loaded with jar
ring imagery and obscure references to
mythology and world travel.
Even the songs labeled "Standard Bit
ter Love Song," while indeed hitter, are far
from standard: "Well, I see you've left me
a photograph / Of a leopard tearing an
antelope in half / What have you
done / With our love?" begins "Standard
Bitter Love Song #4," while "Standard
Bitter Love Song #7" takes things a step
further with "11 I'd been one of these Hies /
I would have lodged myself firmly under
neath your eyelid." That's not even getting
to the series of songs involving Quetzal
coatl, God of the Aztec pantheon ("Quet
zalcoatl Eats Plumbs," "Quetzalcoatl Is
Born"), or any of the "Going to.. ."tracks
("Going to Georgia," "Going to Wiscon
sin," "Going to Bolivia," "Going to
Queens," and so forth).
Even the people who create the
Mountain Goats' recordings bear a cer
tain mystery. Most songs feature just a
voice and an acoustic guitar, yet
Darnielle insists that the Mountain
Goats are a band, and that he is just one
of the members. Earlier material has
been credited to "Rachel, lohn, Sarah,
Amy and Rosanne" (once with the ad
dendum, "and people who say otherwise
arc LIARS"), though the list has recently
been trimmed to a more believable
"lohn and Rachel." And no one seems to
know who the frequently credited
"Bright Mountain Ghoir" is. No band

photo was available for this article.
fjn a recent through-the-mail inter-
Bview, Darnielle, while polite, seemeil
"intent to let the mystery be. In re
sponse to an opening question about the
title of his 1994 work, "Zopilote Ma
chine," he set the tone for what would
become a skewed series of questions and
lengthy "answers."
"I'm afraid you've started with a ques
tion which will indicate to you why inter
viewers tend to be profoundly dissatisfied
with me," he writes. "There is a direct an
swer to this question, but I 'm not going to
give it to you, because the reason lor giv-

ing things obscure titles is as follows:
Some listeners become engaged with the
records at a very sincere and committed
level, looking up hard-to-trace quota
tions and asking around until they figure
out what's going on title-wise, lyrically
and so forth. The only way we have of ex
pressing our gratitude to listeners who
maintain an ongoing involvement with
our records is letting them keep the trea
sures they've dug up without our speak
ing from the pulpit and rendering all
their hard work pointless.
"That said, you could do a lot worse
than looking up the word zopilote in a
comprehensive Spanish dictionary and
then viewing lobe Hooper's film "The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre." This is not a
red herring; the cover, the title and the
content of the film are all related ideolog
ically to that movie."
&)pilote translates to "buzzard," but —
with the exception ofthe brutal simplicity of
Lcatherface's murderous style and a few
probably coincidental details — "The Texas

Chainsaw Massacre" told nie nothing.
Still, a sort of Leatherface-like directness
does seem indicative of the Mountain
Croats' approach. Generally limited to their
rigid acoustic strumming and thin yet ex
pressive vocals (though electric bass and
backing vocals have become more com
mon on recent releases), the Mountain
Goats pack their punch with little in the
way of musical excess. Indeed, in a defining
moment from the cassette-only "Hot Gar
den Stomp," Darnielle sings thankfully to
an unknown other, "You showed me a
thing or two about power/in its purest
form."
Unfortunately, having not yet been enlight-

ened by "The Texas Ghainsaw Massacre" or
"I lot (iarden Stomp" at the tame of our inter
view, I asked 1 >arnielle if he'd ever considered
recording with a more full band.
"A 'more full' band: your rhetoric gives
you away," he answers smartly. "There's a
paradigm in the minds of most folks that says
there's a 'real' band set-up, i.e., guitar-bass
druim-vocals, and then there's everything
else, which is consequently viewed as 'novel
ty* — lacking the privilege granted to those
willing to adhere to the model. We are out to
smash this paradigm because its false: not
onlv does the accepted model get dull in a
hurry — the most rocking stuff out there re
jects it."
1 >arniellc's musical interests, though, aren't
always quite as radical as such a comment
might suggest. After naminga few ofhis favorite
hardcore bands (Born Against, Native Nod,
Antioch Arrow), he explains that his tastes tend
to d isappt >int pot >ple:" 1 'e<>ple who 1 ike our stuff
hate hearing me say that I'm going to go out
today after work and buy the new Melissa
F.theridge album," he says. "It's true, though, be

cause I think she's great."
Nevertheless, in the last few months, the
Mountain C ioats have taken two solid steps along
their own paradigm-smashing course, with a
new HP ami an even newer full-length album.
Ihe fine "Nine Black Poppies" EP delivers nine
bleak pop songs while the epic "Sweden" is
weightier, each of the 19 tracks leaving a more
striking, lasting impact
"Considering the two as prizefights,"
1 >arnielle says simply, "One might say that 'Nine
Black Poppies' is a number of straight hard shots
to the jaw, whereas 'Sweden' is a drawn-out
vengeful sequence oflxxfy blows."
espite Darnielle's fittingly violent box-
II ing analogy, and despite the Moun
tain Goats' penchant for exploring the
grim and misaligned aspects of human re
lations, Darnielle's loves have always been
as crucial a part of the Mountain Goats'
music as his misfortunes. The group's
humor and common personality lend
everyday relevance to otherwise distant ex
pression, giving songs like "Alpha Incipi
ens" and "Deianara Crush" a clever imme
diacy that such ambitious songs don't often
find.
"Nine Black Poppies" begins with "Cubs

In Five," a sarcas
tically hopeful
love song told
with a sideways
focus on
Darnielle's own
interests — in
cluding the team
which he very ex
citedly describes

as "the greatest baseball team in the history
of the game, who will win the World Series
next year, crushing whatever miserable AL
franchise those designated-hitting frauds
throw out against them and once again
proving the old adage: 'The American
League sucks.'"
Darnielle's Cubs enthusiasm surely has
something to do with the fact that he cur
rently resides in Chicago, but a quick look
at the lyrics or liner notes of any Mountain
Goats release should make it clear that
Darnielle's true love and devotion remain
with his home state of California. One track
on "Sweden" refers two Californians "gaz
ing westward," while another, titled "Cali
fornia Song," features the chorus, "I got joy
joy joy in my soul tonight"
"Oh God, I love California," Darnielle
writes. "Can one explain why one loves
one's own mother, or why one likes nothing
more than being warm and safe and loved?
I love California because it is California. I
love to say its name. 1 love to look at maps
of it. I love the freeway system. I love the
ethnic chaos that is Southern California. I
love Malibu. I love the Inland Empire. 1 love
the Callaci brothers."
Darnielle goes tin, ultimately summing
up his Californian love with the same myste
rious simplicity that all but defines the
Mountain Goats.
"There is no 'why,'" he says. "There's only
'ves.'"
