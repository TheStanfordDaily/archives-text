# Beastly rhymes: 'La Bête' on stage
## 
### Samuel Park 
ools arc sometimes the wisest char
acters in theater, telling a Shylotk
that it is a wise father who knows his
own child or bringing light into the folly of a
12th night.
In the world of "La Bete, a hilarious come
dy with plenty ol profound things to say (in
iambic pentameter, no less!), this is no excep
tion. Playing through Sunday at I he Nitery,
the play opens with the folly of Valere (Robin
Moroney), a 17th-century street comedian
with an ego as large as Roseanne's waist.
Absurd and egotistical, he brings hilarious
one-man showmanship into a theater troupe
used to serious drama. As the intricate plot in
terweaves medium with theme, the play forces
the audience to participate actively, reacting to
the play's comment on art, language and the
puckish realization of oh, what fools these
mortals be.
For though Valere may think himself a ge
nius, Elomire (Jan Kuzminski), the leader of
the troupe, does not regard him as such. A se
rious playwright, Elomire believes in high
standards for art and decries the poverty of
Valere s thought. Despite her second-in-com
mand Bejart's (Dan Pintauro) appeals to re
straint, Elomire cannot accept Valere into the
group. But neither can she get rid of him, since
the troupe's patron, Prince Conti (Joaquin
Torres), greatly admires Valere's comedic
skills.
Like the other characters in the play, Valere
is based on a real person. Elomire. for in
stance, is an anagram for Moliere. Best known
for his satirical farces, Moliere started out as a
serious playwright, but, to satisfy his patron's

wishes, had to write comedies, subtly sneaking
in satirical bite and profound insights.
7 his particular production of "La
Bete' has the airs of a miracle all over
it. First ol all, "I a Bete' wasn't sup
posed to be one of the Drama Department's
winter shows; Steve Martins "Picasso at the
Lapin Agile" was. Stanford had the rights to
produce it, but after a hit run at the Mark
Taper Forum and the promise of Broadway,
the "Picasso" people pulled the rights. By then,
"Picasso" had already been cast, with Torres as
the artist, Moroney as a scientific genius and
Chris Walton (who in "La Bete'' plays De Brie)
as Elvis.
What followed was graduate student Jaca
lyn Royce's 10-day frantic race to find another
comedy. The director chose the play according
to the actors she already had, a fact that the
people in the show refuse to believe, according
to Royce. "But the play was chosen for them,"
she insists, aware of the cast's comic potential.
The play that she did pick was intellectual
and language based, with its complex use of
the iambic pentameter form. She told the cast
to think of the language as "Moliere channeled
through Dr. Seuss" and think of themselves as
members of a string quartet.
In fact, for an exercise at rehearsal, the cast
stood in a circle and went through the lines as
if they were playing the piano together, with
each person hitting his note at the right time.
What the cast does in the play through lan
guage is akin to reciting a long, brilliant, excit
ing poem, with each person reading a different
line (dialogue as poetry). The result is breath-

taking.
Anot It e r
obstacle for the
production was
the fact that some
members of the
cast were per
forming in other
plays. Torres and
Ali Hileman, for
instance, were
involved in last
quarter's
"Dreams of a
City," and others
were in "Gai
eties." The first
rehearsal with
the entire cast
was held last
Thursday, less
than a week be
fore yesterday's
opening night.
Instead of the
usual four- to six
week rehearsal
period, "La Bete"
had three. The
miracle here is
that "La Bete"
came together
well — quickly.
Much of
the success may
be due to the
closeness of the
cast. At dinner
together at Pin-

tauro's Mountain View apartment, sometime
during the four-hour marathon of laughter,
fun and opera, a cast member reminded the
others to remember the moment. After all, be
fore the play begins, the characters are sup
posed to be having a merry meal at Prince's
Perenas estate.
And it is exactly this post-champagne ex
citement that carries onto the stage. Often, re
hearsals are dull, long and of no interest for
anyone outside the production itself, but at a
rehearsal for this play, the energy of the cast
was so high and the talents so obvious that
they could just as well have opened that day.
Moroney pulls off a 22-minute monologue
with ease, and Pintauro and Kuzminski (both
professional actors) bring a touching rapport
to their scenes together. Torres is spellbinding
as the affected Prince, and Lindsay Campbell
makes a deliciously aloof Therese. Again, it's a
miracle.
ne particular delight of the play is
W m Playwright David Hirson's language,
which is done in verse. "He took the
rhyming couplets form ofa French play, which
are based on 12-beat lines, and wrote them in
10-beat lines, which are really easy to do," said
Royce.
Hirson took his gift for language to the ex
treme in Valere's act-one monologue, which
lasts for nearly -400 lines. Although each line is
a pleasure to hear, they could burden an actor's
memory. But according to Royce, it wasn't
hard for Moroney to learn the lines because of
the style and playwright Hirson's use of lan
guage and rhyme.
"You go from one joke to another, like a
stand-up monologue," Moroney said. "You're
just moving the plot along. Also, everything
rhymes, and that helps me along."
The rhymes made things easier, according
to Royce, because of their musical quality and
because of the built-in transitions. "If you
break down the speech, each thought leads to
the next. You're just looking lor the right word
to lead you to the next thing," she said, using
the metaphor of singing a song.
It's an important speech, one that reveals
the foolishness and self-love of Valere, a born
performer. For Moroney, it's a tour de force

moment, as he carries on his shoulders a large
chunk of the play. "I'm shit scared of forget
ting my lines on opening night," said Moroney
with a laugh.
the play is set in the 17th cen
40BHttury, it deals with a struggle familiar
m modern audiences: that conflict
between high art and mere entertainment. So
although all the costumes and furniture are
faithful to the period, there are several
anachronisms. There is a radio on stage, and
during intermission, we hear New Orleans
jazz instead of chamber music.
"I don't want the audience to have the com
fort of saying, 'Oh, it's the 17th century.' It's a
way of saying that these issues are in your face
right now," said Royce. "I don't ever want the
audience to think they are looking at some
thing happening inside a picture."
To achieve this effect, Royce broke the
fourth wall, having actors interact with the au
dience. The edges of the set bleed into the
darkness, and the closeness of the seating in a
theater like The Nitery forces the audience to
feed into the play.
There is a real connection between the ac
tors in the play and the audience watching it.
The audience's role becomes larger than just
that of giving thunderous applause at the end,
and we come to realize that perhaps it is the
audience to which the title is referring. The
identity of the fool is never clear. The only
fools who are clearly fools arc the people who
miss this play, which is really the best show we
have had on campus all year and quite likely to
be talked about hereafter.
