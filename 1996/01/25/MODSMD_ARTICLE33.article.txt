# INTERVIEWING SIR IAN: ACCLAIMED ACTOR IN "RICHARD III"
## 
### ATHIMA CHANSANCHAI 
Act I: Power, Corruption and Lies
The ambush happens with no prior
warning, and as the troops storm the head
quarters of the Tudor family, one man's blue
eyes can be seen through a gas mask. The
murderous intent behind those eyes is real
ized quickly and so begins the latest incarna
tion of "Richard 111." Professional soldier
turned politician, Richard kills with mali
cious accuracy, and through his manipula
tion of other's weaknesses, he is able to keep
the pace at breakneck speed in lan McK
ellen's modern adaptation of William Shake
speare's play.
The conspiracy begins almost immediate
ly. Maybe it began when he was a child in an
uncaring household. Once he is older, he re
ceives respect, if not love, as a soldier, merci
less and relentless against his enemies. In
politics he is no different. His strategy re
mains unerringly consistent — to eliminate
whoever stands between him and the throne.
A recent interview with McKellen re
vealed a man dedicated to his profession, to
Shakespeare and to recognizing gay actors in
the film industry. We began by talking about
Richard and what motivation drives a char
actor whose actions are reprehensible.
"Women don't fancy him. The ugliness on
one half of his face is a dreadful stumbling
block," McKellen said, probing the deep
trauma that created the monster.
"His mother hated him from the minute
he was born," he said. "Imagine the treat
ment he got in the playground." His killing
"is a responseto that. He picks up the chal
lenge ol other people's disaffection for him
and turns it back on them. It's a spirit of re
venge — revenge on the world that despises
him."
McKellen cuts to the heart of Shake
speare's portrayal of soldiers like Richard 111
and Macbeth. "Shakespeare has an obsession
— what happens to soldiers when they are
idle.
"[Richard] conquered his disability—ad
mirably I think — and then he leaves his cho
sen profession and things go wrong."

Act II: 1930s — Conspiracies and Chaos
Everyone's doing covers nowadays, so it';
inevitable that someone would get around tc
doing Shakespeare with a modern twist
McKellen and director Richard Loncraint
collaborated on a screenplay that retainec
the essence of the original "Richard III," but
could work in a setting audiences could relate
to easier — in this case, an imagined England
of the 19305.
McKellen was exuberant as he talked
about his new film and its adaptation
"Shakespeare would approve of what we'vi
done," he said. "[The film) asks audiences u
take |the situation) seriously, [acknowledg
ing that theyl have emotional frailties of their
own."
Lords and ladies of the I nglish aristocrat
are dressed smartly in regal dresses and dash
ing uniforms, which McKellen said help:-
clarifies the many roles and positions that till
up the screen.
A device McKellen reprises on the screen
from the stage keeps an intimate bond be
tween the audience and Richard. Staring di
rectly into the audience and giving us the ah
solute truth of his intentions, McKellen
forces us to become accomplices in Richard's
duplicity. "I worried it wouldn't work on the
big screen," McKellen said.
Although he has starred in over 23 films,
including "Scandal" and"And the Band
Played On," he is known as a stage actor of
great repute in his native England. He
worked at beingat ease in front of the camera
by appearing in several films recently, such as
"Restoration" (which just premiered) and
HBO's upcoming "Rasputin" (he plays Czar
Nicholas).
Richard's mascot, the boar, takes on
ridiculous proportions as a symbol as lethal
as the Na/i swastika, its ominous black im
print on a red background an obvious reaf
firmation of the modern fascist implications
of Richard's reign. In creatinga fantasy world
with allusions to an England that might have
been had Edward and Wallis Simpson
reached the throne, it is chilling to realize
that Kdward was in fact friends with Sir Os-

wald Mosley, the head
■ of England's Fascist
„ pa«y.
t I am concerned that
the screenplay or re-
working should be ex
|( cellent and good and
c sympathetic and has the
I proper budget," said
McKellen, who has a
j passionate regard for the
! craft of acting. He was
c delighted to work with
, t the ensemble cast that
read like a who's who of
r British I V and cinema,
including Kristin Scott
v Ihomas, lim Broadbent
and Dame Maggie
s Smith. Annette Benning
II and Robert Downey Ir.
also star.
1 Act III: Domination,
Deformation and De
feat
No person is better
suited to play Richard
than McKellen, or Sir
lan since he was knight
ed in 1491, the first
openly-gay man to have

\ 7 —'
. the privilege. Having
performed the role over 300 times with the
Royal National Theatre, McKellen wears
Richard like a second skin.
McKellen makes us forget how physically
hideous Richard is; through the power of
Shakespeare's language he is transformed
into an eloquent example of the princely dic
tator. So absorbed is he that he inserts sincer
ity into a role rife with insincerity.
Richard, disloyal to everyone but himself,
expects absolute loyalty from others. Any-
I thing less is an automatic death warrant. Be
ginning with his trusting brother Clarence
(Nigel Hawthorne, "The Madness of King
George"), he kills or plots to kill, systemati
cally and single-handedly bringing down the
House of York after doing away with the
House of Tudor. Richard has no one to top
but himself for outrageous behavior. He has
no outlet but to wreak havoc, perpetuate
chaos and in the shambles remain standing,
hunchbacked and handicapped in one arm
but more powerful than the physically per
fect individuals around him.
Having such little regard for human life,
Richard doesn't seem to have a conscience.
We are allowed two or three rare glimpses
into the real nature of the man, the tortured
life he has led, which leads him to such
heights of duplicity. Richard is plagued by
nightmares, evidence that whatever con
science he has seeps out to trouble him, de
priving him of blissful sleep.
After seeing a few of McKellan's other
films — in fact, after speaking to him — it is
hard to believe the same man has imbued
such savagery to his role as Richard. McK
ellen is likely to be a contender for Best Actor
for an Academy Award this year.
"It's parts that win prizes, not actors,"
McKellan said. "But, I do think I've had one
ot the best roles. Who knows? It draws atten-

tion to the work."
Act IV: Facades, Sexuality and Courage
When McKellen came to San Francisco to
talk to Terry Anderson about "And the Band
Played On," he realized the importance of
making public his homosexuality.
"It improved the quality of my life," he
said of coming out in 1988.
"Hollywood is in itself a fantasy machine
McKellan complained when asked about the
taboos that arc still in place regarding an
actor's sexuality. "Hollywood hasn't caught
lip."
Now a gay rights activist and co-founder
of the Stonewall group, which lobbies for
legal and social equality for lesbians and gav
men in the U.K., McKellen said with partial
lar disdain that "Actors are encouraged to lie
about their sexuality in order to retain their
jobs."
McKellan is waiting for the day when an
openly-gay actor will play a gay role.
"Persuade an American actor to play an
openly-gay man," he said. "It will be a bit of a
breakthrough. It will make all this look ver\
silly and unnecessary. It's very cruel to that
individual that they should lie — [it's] not
good for them, not good for society as a
whole, and it perpetuates the myth."
McKellen will not remain relatively un
known to American audiences for long it the
year continues to yield positive reviews and an
influx of interest in "Richard III."
Until then, McKellen has proven he has the
power to suspend our belief for a couple of
hours; that despite the new setting, there is a
story that enthralls and captivates, a story that
can not only endure improvisation but thrive
as well. Richard, smiling on the road to hell,
would probably meet Shakespeare some
where along the way, who will say, "Well
done."

cally and single-handedly bringing down the
House of York after doing away with the
House of Tudor. Richard has no one to top
but himself for outrageous behavior. He has
no outlet but to wreak havoc, perpetuate
chaos and in the shambles remain standing,
hunchbacked and handicapped in one arm
but more powerful than the physically per
fect individuals around him.
Having such little regard for human life,
Richard doesn't seem to have a conscience.
We are allowed two or three rare glimpses
into the real nature of the man, the tortured
life he has led, which leads him to such
heights of duplicity. Richard is plagued by
nightmares, evidence that whatever con
science he has seeps out to trouble him, de
priving him of blissful sleep.
After seeing a few of McKellan's other
films — in fact, after speaking to him — it is
hard to believe the same man has imbued
such savagery to his role as Richard. McK
ellen is likely to be a contender for Best Actor
for an Academy Award this year.
"It's parts that win prizes, not actors,"
McKellan said. "But, I do think I've had one
ot the best roles. Who knows? It draws atten-

tion to the work."
Act IV: Facades, Sexuality and Courage
When McKellen came to San Francisco to
talk to Terry Anderson about "And the Band
Played On," he realized the importance of
making public his homosexuality.
"It improved the quality of my life," he
said of coming out in 1988.
"Hollywood is in itself a fantasy machine
McKellan complained when asked about the
taboos that arc still in place regarding an
actor's sexuality. "Hollywood hasn't caught
lip."
Now a gay rights activist and co-founder
of the Stonewall group, which lobbies for
legal and social equality for lesbians and gav
men in the U.K., McKellen said with partial
lar disdain that "Actors are encouraged to lie
about their sexuality in order to retain their
jobs."
McKellan is waiting for the day when an
openly-gay actor will play a gay role.
"Persuade an American actor to play an
openly-gay man," he said. "It will be a bit of a
breakthrough. It will make all this look ver\
silly and unnecessary. It's very cruel to that
individual that they should lie — [it's] not
good for them, not good for society as a
whole, and it perpetuates the myth."
McKellen will not remain relatively un
known to American audiences for long it the
year continues to yield positive reviews and an
influx of interest in "Richard III."
Until then, McKellen has proven he has the
power to suspend our belief for a couple of
hours; that despite the new setting, there is a
story that enthralls and captivates, a story that
can not only endure improvisation but thrive
as well. Richard, smiling on the road to hell,
would probably meet Shakespeare some
where along the way, who will say, "Well
done."

McKellen in royal garb as the evil king.
Act I: Power, Corruption and Lies
The ambush happens with no prior
warning, and as the troops storm the head
quarters of the Tudor family, one man's blue
eyes can be seen through a gas mask. The
murderous intent behind those eyes is real
ized quickly and so begins the latest incarna
tion of "Richard 111." Professional soldier
turned politician, Richard kills with mali
cious accuracy, and through his manipula
tion of other's weaknesses, he is able to keep
the pace at breakneck speed in lan McK
ellen's modern adaptation of William Shake
speare's play.
The conspiracy begins almost immediate
ly. Maybe it began when he was a child in an
uncaring household. Once he is older, he re
ceives respect, if not love, as a soldier, merci
less and relentless against his enemies. In
politics he is no different. His strategy re
mains unerringly consistent — to eliminate
whoever stands between him and the throne.
A recent interview with McKellen re
vealed a man dedicated to his profession, to
Shakespeare and to recognizing gay actors in
the film industry. We began by talking about
Richard and what motivation drives a char
actor whose actions are reprehensible.
"Women don't fancy him. The ugliness on
one half of his face is a dreadful stumbling
block," McKellen said, probing the deep
trauma that created the monster.
"His mother hated him from the minute
he was born," he said. "Imagine the treat
ment he got in the playground." His killing
"is a responseto that. He picks up the chal
lenge ol other people's disaffection for him
and turns it back on them. It's a spirit of re
venge — revenge on the world that despises
him."
McKellen cuts to the heart of Shake
speare's portrayal of soldiers like Richard 111
and Macbeth. "Shakespeare has an obsession
— what happens to soldiers when they are
idle.
"[Richard] conquered his disability—ad
mirably I think — and then he leaves his cho
sen profession and things go wrong."

Act II: 1930s — Conspiracies and Chaos
Everyone's doing covers nowadays, so it';
inevitable that someone would get around tc
doing Shakespeare with a modern twist
McKellen and director Richard Loncraint
collaborated on a screenplay that retainec
the essence of the original "Richard III," but
could work in a setting audiences could relate
to easier — in this case, an imagined England
of the 19305.
McKellen was exuberant as he talked
about his new film and its adaptation
"Shakespeare would approve of what we'vi
done," he said. "[The film) asks audiences u
take |the situation) seriously, [acknowledg
ing that theyl have emotional frailties of their
own."
Lords and ladies of the I nglish aristocrat
are dressed smartly in regal dresses and dash
ing uniforms, which McKellen said help:-
clarifies the many roles and positions that till
up the screen.
A device McKellen reprises on the screen
from the stage keeps an intimate bond be
tween the audience and Richard. Staring di
rectly into the audience and giving us the ah
solute truth of his intentions, McKellen
forces us to become accomplices in Richard's
duplicity. "I worried it wouldn't work on the
big screen," McKellen said.
Although he has starred in over 23 films,
including "Scandal" and"And the Band
Played On," he is known as a stage actor of
great repute in his native England. He
worked at beingat ease in front of the camera
by appearing in several films recently, such as
"Restoration" (which just premiered) and
HBO's upcoming "Rasputin" (he plays Czar
Nicholas).
Richard's mascot, the boar, takes on
ridiculous proportions as a symbol as lethal
as the Na/i swastika, its ominous black im
print on a red background an obvious reaf
firmation of the modern fascist implications
of Richard's reign. In creatinga fantasy world
with allusions to an England that might have
been had Edward and Wallis Simpson
reached the throne, it is chilling to realize
that Kdward was in fact friends with Sir Os-

wald Mosley, the head
■ of England's Fascist
„ pa«y.
t I am concerned that
the screenplay or re-
working should be ex
|( cellent and good and
c sympathetic and has the
I proper budget," said
McKellen, who has a
j passionate regard for the
! craft of acting. He was
c delighted to work with
, t the ensemble cast that
read like a who's who of
r British I V and cinema,
including Kristin Scott
v Ihomas, lim Broadbent
and Dame Maggie
s Smith. Annette Benning
II and Robert Downey Ir.
also star.
1 Act III: Domination,
Deformation and De
feat
No person is better
suited to play Richard
than McKellen, or Sir
lan since he was knight
ed in 1491, the first
openly-gay man to have

\ 7 —'
. the privilege. Having
performed the role over 300 times with the
Royal National Theatre, McKellen wears
Richard like a second skin.
McKellen makes us forget how physically
hideous Richard is; through the power of
Shakespeare's language he is transformed
into an eloquent example of the princely dic
tator. So absorbed is he that he inserts sincer
ity into a role rife with insincerity.
Richard, disloyal to everyone but himself,
expects absolute loyalty from others. Any-
I thing less is an automatic death warrant. Be
ginning with his trusting brother Clarence
(Nigel Hawthorne, "The Madness of King
George"), he kills or plots to kill, systemati
cally and single-handedly bringing down the
House of York after doing away with the
House of Tudor. Richard has no one to top
but himself for outrageous behavior. He has
no outlet but to wreak havoc, perpetuate
chaos and in the shambles remain standing,
hunchbacked and handicapped in one arm
but more powerful than the physically per
fect individuals around him.
