## A 						perfect snowflake of a novel 
### Allison Amend 
Minimalist writ
ing came in with
Hemingway, con
tinued with Jim
Harrison and went
out with ... well, it
never really left
modern fiction. Yet
evervonce in a blue

moon a book comes along to reaffirm mod
ernist sparsity with a clarity and precision
that is the one perfectly original snowflake in
a storm.
"Snow Falling on Cedars" is such a book.
Author David Guterson's first full-length
effort, "Snow Falling" is the painfully
poignant story of the small island of San
Piedro near Puget Sound. The equally en
thralling dual plots take place on two planes.
The first is the story of a 1954 courtroom bat
tle, with Japanese American Kabuo Miyamo
to on trial for the murder of fellow fisherman
Carl Heine. It appears someone boarded
Carl's boat one night; he was found drowned
in his fishing net five hours later.
The second plot plays out as a history of
the island. Newspaper reporter Ishmael
Chambers grew up on the island, hunting for
clams and discovering love with the Japanese
descended Hatsue. After Pearl Harbor, her

family was sent to an internment camp and
Ishmael was drafted to kill Hatsue's "broth
ers" overseas.
What both plots reveal, in subtle waves of
insinuation and hatred, is the racist under
currents in the small island community.
From the first push of immigration, when
poor Japanese took over the manual labor of
the island, raising raspberries and strawber
ries on the fertile soil, to the mounting ten
sions leading up to Pearl Harbor, the Ger
man-Dutch immigrants look upon the
Japanese with trepidation and fear, tinged
with the sentiment of superiority.
The puppy love between I latsue and Ish
mael, touchingly and easily rendered by
Guterson, is an impossible one. Both of their
parents forbid the union. The hollowcd-out
base of the cedar tree where they meet in se
cret becomes a trope of their relationship. The
cedar smell and the green moss serve as bed
and bedroom for their "marriage."
But I latsue's separation from Ishmael and
her sense of daughterly duty marry her to
Kabuo, whose search to reclaim the land his
father paid for — but was prevented from
owning — provides him with both motive
and opportunity to commit murder. Ishmael,
watching Kabuo's trial from his scat in the
press section of the courtroom, rubs the stub
of his amputated arm, of which he is painful
ly conscious, and envies Kabuo his ties to the
one woman Ishmael has ever loved.

Guterson's novel is exquisitely and relent
lessly well-written. Outstanding passages
abound, but those dealing with the harvest
are especially sensual and well-rendered. "He
watched while she held her hair back with one
hand, the other moving in search of the
sweetest fruit, grazing among the canes....
She slid the berries in between her lips, still
holding her hair, the canes rebounding in
quiet arcs when she freed the berry caps from
their cores. He stood watching and imagined
that if he kissed her that night the taste of the
raspberries would be cool in his mouth."
Yet the sensuality of the passage occasion
ally contributes to the detriment of the novel.
Guterson seems obsessed with the sex lives of
his characters. We often read descriptions of
sex scenes that seem synechdotal for the char
acter. Therefore, Ishmael is the kind of boy
who, when Hatsue feels uncomfortable in
their first sexual experience "pulled himself
out, away. I le was a decent boy, a kind boy."
Sympathy is created for the dead Carl
when we learn that, though his wife and he
existed in a nonverbal environment, "their
sex life had been at the heart of their mar
riage," and we are treated to several pages of
description of their idyllic coupling (which
functions as a male fantasy of a woman de
scribing the perfect sex partner). Not that de
scriptions of two characters having sex can't
be a way to gain insight into their relation
ship, but when it exists instead of dialogue or

narrative, it assumes an unnatural impor
tance in fiction.
The novel does tend to wax "Bridges of
Madison County"-esque in revealing places.
Guterson paints himself into a corner with
the ending: If Kabuo committed the crime,
then the stereotype of the aggressive Japanese
Kendo warrior is reinforced. If he is not guilty,
then the island community experiences a
racial rift that would seem irreparable. Guter
son manages to come up with a Scooby Doo
ending worthy of John Grisham; however, it is
only slightly more literary that traditional Gr
isham fare.
I take exception, as well, to the cover and
title, which are obviously the brain-child of
some Vintage marketing dolt, and don't do
the novel justice. As well, the map of the is
land gives the book a science-fiction feel that
is gimmicky rather than helpful. The nature
imagery invoked on the front cover is grate
fully muted and restrained within the pages.
Truly, this novel can stand on its own, with
out the epigraph from Dante's "Divine
Goniedy."
These arc minor disagreements, however,
with a veritably special text. Deserved winner
of the PF.N/Faulkncr award and defender of
many weeks on the New York Times Bestseller
1 ist, "Snow Falling on Cedars" is historical yet
engaging, beautiful and timeless so that you
turn the pages quickly, hoping it will never
end.
