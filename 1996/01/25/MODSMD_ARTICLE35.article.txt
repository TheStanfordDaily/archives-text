## A 						random sampling of undergraduate artists 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Jen Graves 
I picture a masterpiece deconstructed and ren
-Ajered curiously magical by a I hawing I class.
You've seen the face before, but not like this.
Its Irida Kahlo staring down your fears with that
famous cryptic glare. Hut in the version of
"Thinking About 1 )eath" that hangs in the lobln
of Cummings Art Building, I rida is looking
through a grid ol varying styles—the distinct sig
natures ol I (1 students in Prof. I nriqueC lhagoya's
class last quarter.
The assignment was oddly mathematical.
1 adi student was given a small square sectioned
on a grid from which they reproduced the details
on an enlarged scale using whatever style or color
scheme they pleased. No one was told what they
were drawing, so they focused on the task of ren
dering the intricacies accurate and aesthetically
unique.
I'wo hours later, they assembled the fragments.
"When everybody was done, and we finally put it
all together, it was like a miracle," Chagoya says
with a boyish grin. "Everyone, mvselt included,
was amazed to see how beautiful it was."
fhev call her "Deconstructed I rida." Vivid

flesh tones lie juxtaposed against a charcoaled
cheekand eye, and somehow nothing clashes. The
peculiarities of each grid are engaged in a visual
conversation about the interplay of artistic sensi
bilities. Together, the voices of each fragment say
the same thing I rida once wrote in her diary: "Di
versity in unity.
I veil though every fragment is remarkable in
its own right, one seduced my admiration more
powerfully than the others — the rich hues and
immaculate honesty of the centerpiece. Kvery
thingelse arranges itself around the regal beautyof
her fecial features.
When I met lal lonia lee, a junior majoring in
art, I knew before she told me that she had drawn
the face. Something soft and unspoken about her
own face emits a passion for the details of person
ality that hide in the gestures of lips and eyebrows.
I ler big, lazy eyes disguise the thoughts she saves
tor her own self-portraits.
"Rather than wearing what I'm feeling on my
face, I put it in my portrait," she says. " The best
thing about putting thoughts into my self-por
t raits is that 1 don't have to explain what's goingon.

It's up the viewers to fig
ure it out."
Hach of her self-por
traits has its own style.
One is a flat sketch

drawn with clean and careful curves. Another is
only one side of her face, a hasty impromptu with
an eye focused on faceless passers-by. In another,
she reads with her eyes closed. They are anatomies
of moods and feelings we've all experienced, ex
pressed more eloquently than words could
achieve.
In one of Lai lonia's favorite assignments, she
was asked to make a self-portrait out of anything
()ther than her face. She drew her shoes. "My sin >es
show where I've been, which is a lot of who I am,"
she says, glancing at them. "I'm always wearing
them, so if someone sees this drawing, they'll
know it's me."
My favorite work is a drawing in reverse, the
figure of a model crouched pensively hugging her
knee. 1 ler body and the mute features of her
downcast face are shadows seen only because the
light has been erased away. In it, LaHoma trans
lates an exercise in gesture drawing into a moment
of silent privacy. She admits that she rarely speaks
what she's feeling. She doesn't need to. 1 ler art
speaks for her.
When Monica Lam was young, her art
teacher would make her cut pho
tographs out of magazines and draw
them perfectly, rendering every minute detail a
precise reflection of the original. "It was scary, but
I built up good technique,' she says, looking at a
small painting that hangs above her bed — an or
nately detailed wooded stream she painted when
she was nine. "It was important to get the me
chanics down, but it didn't allow me to build up
my personal understanding of my art. That's what
I'm trying to do more of now."
Monica's current fascination is monotype, a
process in which ink is painted on a plate, then
moist paper placed on top of the plate is passed
through a press. The image that appears is a one
time, one-of-a-kind replica of the configuration
of the paint.
"Once you print it it's gone. There is something
more spontaneous to the whole process that I re
ally like. It's this motion that flies out of me," she
says boisterously.
One series, called "Train Windows," was on
display this summer at the Palo Alto C lultural C Wri
ter in "Radius '95," an exhibit that featured six Bay
Area artists. Each image is a freeze frame of veloc
ity that l(X)ks swift enough to whisk itself away
from a viewer's gaze. I n silence, they sound the rat -
tie of an approaching train inside one's head.
In another series, Monica inks out pieces of the
street, highlighting patterns caused by loose as
phalt, cracks in the pavement, the fall ofleavesand
pine needles and the edges of crosswalk paint.
"I have a constant fascination with the way nat
ural and urban things work together," says Moni
ca, a senior urban studies major. "The two forces
are so often in such interesting conflict with each

other, especially here in California where when
you drive down 280, and these big chunky high
ways are meshed with lovely hills going off in the
distance."
A wild print of the Dumbarton Bridge is a
thoughtfully reckless summary of Monica's two
current passions: motion and nature in an in
creasingly urbanized world. The bridge is a rapid
streak that smears in a grand curve over marshes
and across the bay. In the background, the Sierra
foothills hover over the pretense of the scene as
though they're wondering what the bridge and all
the darting cars are doing there.
"I really like this one," she says with a charac
teristically modest smile.
There are no mirrors in Ginny's room. Her
paintings hang where mirrors might and
say more about her than mirrors could. Vi
brant hues of pink and azure play with somber
green and anxious yellows in jubilant tangos of
color.
Whether a solemn self-portrait, an imaginary
landscape where pools have eyes or the elegant
curves of a female figure reclined in a pose of self
questioning grace, Ginny Robinson's paintings
are visually thrilling serenades that give silent col
ors the power to sing.
"The most exciting thing about painting is the
color," says the junior art history major. "I love to
get my palate out and mess around with all the
colors," she says, running her finger along the
bright, curvy shadows of a model study. "Rather
than concentrating on actual forms, I think its
exciting to see how different colors react against
each other."
1 lor eyes wander across the room to a dreamy
abstract that hangs at the foot of her bed. In one
corner of the work, a languid explosion of forms
and colors drools out ofsomethingthat looks like
it might be a tube of paint. In another corner, a
goldfish swims in a bowl that blends into a nebu
la of gentle, earthy tones. Each new viewing sug
gests different visual games for eyes to play. It's like
a jigsaw puzzle that fits regardless of the configu
ration of pieces.
"This painting was really exciting for me be
cause, for a long time, I felt kind of trapped, like I
had to look at something to paint. With this
painting though, I escaped."
In other paintings, the roofs and cheekbones
of her subjects are altered with strokes of her de
sire to make the real look imaginary. One of her
landscapes looks like it's pretending not to be it
self. Radiating ripples on the surface of a pool
Iwk like eyes. Next to it is a house that looks like
it's midway through transforming itself into the
home of a psychedelic gingerbread man.
"I like to imagine a world, make up the whole
situation and watch where it gt>es," she says, turn
ing her head sideways as though she just spotted

something new floating on the surface of the
pool.
I rving to describe what inspires her to paint,
Ginny admits what most artists seem to have in
common. "It's an addiction," she says.
Becky Schweig, a senior majoring in anthro
pology and photography, has been taking
pictures since third grade. Her subjects, she
smilingly recalls, were Cabbage Patch kids set in
various positions. "I don't always feel like I'm
looking through the viewfinder, but to some ex
tent I frame my vision and always have—back to
the Cabbage Patch kids."
Schweig has developed a style deeply connect
ed to the framing of her subjects. As opposed to
finding pictures, she prefers to create them.
"What I like to do most is to make photos, but it
depends on what I 'm doing. I have done docu
mentary work, but I'm usually not document
ing"
She controls a scene with props and lighting
instead of cropping the negative. "When you're
making a picture, you can manipulate it in so
many ways. You can cut the negative to show
what you want to show, but I don't like to do that

because I want the negative to be saying every
thing I want it to say." In some of her favorite
works, she uses fruit and vegetables as stand-ins
for body parts otherwise concealed, making the
viewer notice the texture and shapes of the
human body and introducing elements of
humor and the absurd.
In the past, Schweig has mainly done black
and-white photos, but she has recently become
interested in color. Formal qualities separate the
two types. "Black and white is more about tex
ture, and the surprise of your eye seeing black
and white tends to make you look at things that
are more subtle than what you would see in daily
life," she says. However, Schweig disagrees with
the common myth that black and white is some
how a purer art than color. A color photo will
draw the eye to aspects ofthe picture that a black
and-white one will miss, and vice versa.
Schweig works mainly with models whom she
knows. "All these photos are interactions with
me, since I know them and they know me. It's re
ally uncomfortable to be in front of a camera,
maybe even more so if the person knows you. I

like to take a bunch of rolls of some
one at one time to get them in be
tween poses.' So while Schweig's
photography is staged, it also has a
spontaneous side and depends total
ly on her eye's artistic vision.
Schweig creates photographs that
not only act asa visual exploration of
human bodies and forms, but also as
a moving, lite-like scene. "I want
some kind ot sound or motion. I like
when I hear something in a picture,
even it it's silence."
One of her favorite artists and in
fluences is ( iiulv Sherman, who
photographs only herself, posed in
various compromising positions
that have historically accompanied
the representation of the female in
art. "She takes great pictures and also
has a political statement," Schweig
says. Shermans political agenda
serves her aesthetic style, instead ot
vice versa.

Schweig's style can ho seen this way as well
While she might have intentions and interpreta

tions to give to the world, her pictures stand on
their own for any viewer. "A picture is what it is to
the viewer," she says. "It's all there, and you can
take out of it what you want."
Carina Merrick spent her first three years at
Stanford attempting to enjoy various ma
jors, including philosophy, linguistics
and symbolic systems. In high school, she took art
classes "just for fun." She did drawing "on the
side," and her junior year here, she painted her fa
vorite painting covering the 10-foot by 6-foot wall
in her Alpha Sig room. At the beginning of her
fourth year, she declared art as her major.
Since that time, Merrick has produced paint
ings in so many periods that looking at her work
is like being in the Smorgasbord Room of the
MOM A (right next to the "Andy Warhol Does
I listorical Oil Paintings" room). In the studio is
a painting in an "impressionist nude" vein, one
that's more "Fauve, Matisse-like," a stroll down
Cubist lane, a realist / Surrealist scene, her large
experiment in "neo-Cubist, Kandinsky"-style
and even the "perfunctory depressive artist

phase." Merrick says that since she has no idea
what she is doing, these phases suit her for now.
But her hopes are high. "After a while, maybe Ill
settle down with one nice style, with which I'm
compatible, and we'll have little style kids and a
little style picket fence, t )r maybe not," she says in
complete seriousness.
Merrick stresses that her art is not the result of
divine inspiration or a talent that accompanied
her through the birth canal. "Four years ago, I
could not draw tosave my life. It's really a lot more
practice-based than even 1 thought — I wasn't
born doing this shit. Though," she amends the
rule, "I do have one friend who tried to draw a
frog, and based on that, I would say there's really
no hope for her."
Merrick's interests in painting lie more in the
technical aspects of color, line and brushstroke,
while her drawings rest on a more realist premise.
She has never finished a painting. "I've never got
ten any single painting to the point where I've said
to myself, 'This is finished.' So that's my goal."
Although unfinished, she has spent 20 hours
so far on the large neo-Cubist painting. "I like it,
but I don't think I like it as much as everybody else
does." For the painting, which appears as an ex
tensive exercise in the interweaving of shapes and
planes represented in bright color, she used the
world as her template, although one would never
know it."The painting is not representational,
but the lines are basal on actual objects and
places while the color choice is purely composi
tional." Like much of abstract art, it is aesthetical-

ly expressive
and impressive
while it re
mains totally
personal to the
artist. "Despite
claims that 'My
five-year-old
can do that,'"
says Merrick, "I
am much more
interested in
abstract art
than 1 used to
be."
Though she
doesn't tend to
imitate reality
in her paint
ings, Merrick
does interest
ing things
when "they
bring us naked
people to look

at." In one of her paintings where the assignment
was to create a multiple-figure painting from a
nude, she explored the form of the nude in terms
of brushstrokes, making a painting with three
women all appearing to belong in separate paint
ings, but forcing their mutual space to come to
gether by their coexistence on the canvas. The
painting looks Surrealist, and Merrick's favorite
artists are specifically Salvador Dali, Rene
Magritte and Francis Bacon, master of the
grotesque.
Speaking of garish scenery, the painting Mer
rick created on her wall two years ago involves an
interesting story. The painting was of a Sand Man
comic — "basically, Sand Man goes to I fell." Red
and black, it portrayed Beelzebub looking down
over the plains of 1 lell, with all the demons wan
dering. Apparently, during a convention in the
summer after Merrick lived in Alpha Sig, Stan
ford housed a family with an eight-year-old girl
there. The painting gave the little girl nightmares.
"At this point, the family complained to the Uni
versity. So to remedy the situation, Stanford put
up wood paneling. They didn't paint over it. Ap
parently, they thought it was cool. But they cov
ered it up, and as far as I know, it's still covered up
now"
Maybe the University will uncover the painting.
Regardless of the painting's fate, Merrick wonders
about her post-graduation destiny. "How many
times a day can I say, 'Do you want cheese on
that?'" Also, her mother wears combat boots. She
said I could print that.
