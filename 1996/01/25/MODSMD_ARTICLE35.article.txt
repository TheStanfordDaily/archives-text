# Student art
## A random sampling of undergraduate artists
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Jen Graves 
I picture a masterpiece deconstructed and ren
-Ajered curiously magical by a I hawing I class.
You've seen the face before, but not like this.
Its Irida Kahlo staring down your fears with that
famous cryptic glare. Hut in the version of
"Thinking About 1 )eath" that hangs in the lobln
of Cummings Art Building, I rida is looking
through a grid ol varying styles—the distinct sig
natures ol I (1 students in Prof. I nriqueC lhagoya's
class last quarter.
The assignment was oddly mathematical.
1 adi student was given a small square sectioned
on a grid from which they reproduced the details
on an enlarged scale using whatever style or color
scheme they pleased. No one was told what they
were drawing, so they focused on the task of ren
dering the intricacies accurate and aesthetically
unique.
I'wo hours later, they assembled the fragments.
"When everybody was done, and we finally put it
all together, it was like a miracle," Chagoya says
with a boyish grin. "Everyone, mvselt included,
was amazed to see how beautiful it was."
fhev call her "Deconstructed I rida." Vivid

flesh tones lie juxtaposed against a charcoaled
cheekand eye, and somehow nothing clashes. The
peculiarities of each grid are engaged in a visual
conversation about the interplay of artistic sensi
bilities. Together, the voices of each fragment say
the same thing I rida once wrote in her diary: "Di
versity in unity.
I veil though every fragment is remarkable in
its own right, one seduced my admiration more
powerfully than the others — the rich hues and
immaculate honesty of the centerpiece. Kvery
thingelse arranges itself around the regal beautyof
her fecial features.
When I met lal lonia lee, a junior majoring in
art, I knew before she told me that she had drawn
the face. Something soft and unspoken about her
own face emits a passion for the details of person
ality that hide in the gestures of lips and eyebrows.
I ler big, lazy eyes disguise the thoughts she saves
tor her own self-portraits.
"Rather than wearing what I'm feeling on my
face, I put it in my portrait," she says. " The best
thing about putting thoughts into my self-por
t raits is that 1 don't have to explain what's goingon.

It's up the viewers to fig
ure it out."
Hach of her self-por
traits has its own style.
One is a flat sketch

drawn with clean and careful curves. Another is
only one side of her face, a hasty impromptu with
an eye focused on faceless passers-by. In another,
she reads with her eyes closed. They are anatomies
of moods and feelings we've all experienced, ex
pressed more eloquently than words could
achieve.
In one of Lai lonia's favorite assignments, she
was asked to make a self-portrait out of anything
()ther than her face. She drew her shoes. "My sin >es
show where I've been, which is a lot of who I am,"
she says, glancing at them. "I'm always wearing
them, so if someone sees this drawing, they'll
know it's me."
My favorite work is a drawing in reverse, the
figure of a model crouched pensively hugging her
knee. 1 ler body and the mute features of her
downcast face are shadows seen only because the
light has been erased away. In it, LaHoma trans
lates an exercise in gesture drawing into a moment
of silent privacy. She admits that she rarely speaks
what she's feeling. She doesn't need to. 1 ler art
speaks for her.
When Monica Lam was young, her art
teacher would make her cut pho
tographs out of magazines and draw
them perfectly, rendering every minute detail a
precise reflection of the original. "It was scary, but
I built up good technique,' she says, looking at a
small painting that hangs above her bed — an or
nately detailed wooded stream she painted when
she was nine. "It was important to get the me
chanics down, but it didn't allow me to build up
my personal understanding of my art. That's what
I'm trying to do more of now."
Monica's current fascination is monotype, a
process in which ink is painted on a plate, then
moist paper placed on top of the plate is passed
through a press. The image that appears is a one
time, one-of-a-kind replica of the configuration
of the paint.
"Once you print it it's gone. There is something
more spontaneous to the whole process that I re
ally like. It's this motion that flies out of me," she
says boisterously.
One series, called "Train Windows," was on
display this summer at the Palo Alto C lultural C Wri
ter in "Radius '95," an exhibit that featured six Bay
Area artists. Each image is a freeze frame of veloc
ity that l(X)ks swift enough to whisk itself away
from a viewer's gaze. I n silence, they sound the rat -
tie of an approaching train inside one's head.
In another series, Monica inks out pieces of the
street, highlighting patterns caused by loose as
phalt, cracks in the pavement, the fall ofleavesand
pine needles and the edges of crosswalk paint.
"I have a constant fascination with the way nat
ural and urban things work together," says Moni
ca, a senior urban studies major. "The two forces
are so often in such interesting conflict with each

other, especially here in California where when
you drive down 280, and these big chunky high
ways are meshed with lovely hills going off in the
distance."
A wild print of the Dumbarton Bridge is a
thoughtfully reckless summary of Monica's two
current passions: motion and nature in an in
creasingly urbanized world. The bridge is a rapid
streak that smears in a grand curve over marshes
and across the bay. In the background, the Sierra
foothills hover over the pretense of the scene as
though they're wondering what the bridge and all
the darting cars are doing there.
"I really like this one," she says with a charac
teristically modest smile.
There are no mirrors in Ginny's room. Her
paintings hang where mirrors might and
say more about her than mirrors could. Vi
brant hues of pink and azure play with somber
green and anxious yellows in jubilant tangos of
color.
Whether a solemn self-portrait, an imaginary
landscape where pools have eyes or the elegant
curves of a female figure reclined in a pose of self
questioning grace, Ginny Robinson's paintings
are visually thrilling serenades that give silent col
ors the power to sing.
"The most exciting thing about painting is the
color," says the junior art history major. "I love to
get my palate out and mess around with all the
colors," she says, running her finger along the
bright, curvy shadows of a model study. "Rather
than concentrating on actual forms, I think its
exciting to see how different colors react against
each other."
1 lor eyes wander across the room to a dreamy
abstract that hangs at the foot of her bed. In one
corner of the work, a languid explosion of forms
and colors drools out ofsomethingthat looks like
it might be a tube of paint. In another corner, a
goldfish swims in a bowl that blends into a nebu
la of gentle, earthy tones. Each new viewing sug
gests different visual games for eyes to play. It's like
a jigsaw puzzle that fits regardless of the configu
ration of pieces.
"This painting was really exciting for me be
cause, for a long time, I felt kind of trapped, like I
had to look at something to paint. With this
painting though, I escaped."
In other paintings, the roofs and cheekbones
of her subjects are altered with strokes of her de
sire to make the real look imaginary. One of her
landscapes looks like it's pretending not to be it
self. Radiating ripples on the surface of a pool
Iwk like eyes. Next to it is a house that looks like
it's midway through transforming itself into the
home of a psychedelic gingerbread man.
"I like to imagine a world, make up the whole
situation and watch where it gt>es," she says, turn
ing her head sideways as though she just spotted
