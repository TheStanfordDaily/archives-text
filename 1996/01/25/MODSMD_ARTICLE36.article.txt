BLACK GRAPE
It's Great When
You're Straight • • •
Yeah

In .1 hyper-inflation ol bloated egos and
colorless mediocrity, Black Grape kindly
ofler a splash ol infectious excitement. Their
debut album, "It's Great When You're
Straight . .. Yeah," will effortlessly soak you
with fluorescent animation and blockbust
ing tit illation and make you constantly
nag for another spin
l ed by former Happy Mondays helms
man Shaun Ryder, Black (irape carries on a
musical tradition that begins and ends with
the party. Combining the harmonica dri
ven tingle of Blues Traveler with the funk
infused grooves ol Sly and the Family
Stone, "It's (ireat When You're Straight" is
best approached with a "Damn, let's get
down!" kind of goal in mind.
The most talked about track on the
album, "In the Name of the l ather," is a
Hurry of multicultural musical mayhem,
laughingly melting reggae, funk and mid
dle-eastern influences. Packed with subtle
samples, cool effects and splish-splashy
playfulness, the lead track is a microcosm of
all things Black Grape, a wonderful sample
of what this album is soon to offer. "Kelly's
Heroes," another auditory shindig further
along, is bolstered by a devilishly memo
rable guitar lead and a chorus chant that
defies coherent thought structure: "Don't
talk to me about heroes / most of these men
sing like Serbs / Jesus was a black man,
Jesus was Batman / No, no, no — that was
Bruce Wayne!"
Although such lyrical debauchery con
tinues throughout most of the album,
rarely is there a need for clarification. Fu
eled by a restless pulse and a festive attitude,
"It's Great When You're Straight . . . Yeah"
basks in the moment at hand, creating a
soulfulness that can rarely be captured by
the carefully-orchestrated studio approach.

Such spontaneous creativity shines in
tracks like "I ittle Bob," a groovy explo
ration that avoids conventional methods of
songwriting. With a commitment to jam
ming away, the concluding track conveys
the feeling of a great outdoor concert, a
free-floating exploration into synergistic
metamorphosis.
Perhaps that's what makes this band
from Manchester the No. I group in I .on
don and a firestorm in the states "It's
Great When You're Straight is simpb up
lifting.

Punk You: Musit for
the Discerning
Slacker Punk, Vol. I

Punk rock, punk rock, punk rock. Punk
o-freakin'-rama.
Punk rock is the newest fad in popular
music. We have Green Day, Rancid, NoFX,
etc., etc. Whatever you want to call it, punk
rock is big business and it only seems nat
ural that the next logical way to capitalize
on such a fad would be to come out with an
insipid compilation of early punk record
ings.
Well wait no longer, because EMI
Records has just released a compilation en
titled "Punk You: Music For The Discern
ing Slacker Punk, Vol. I." It features early
EMI punkers from '76-'Bl, such as Gener
ation X (Billy Idol's original band), Wire,
Blondie, the Buz/cocks and Adam and the
Ants. Please contain me.
Music for the discerning slacker? The
extended title alone is enough to make you
wretch. The term "slacker" in and of itself
is degrading to the bands who — for the
most part — possessed deep-rooted work
ethic from growing up in lower middle
class environments. The idea is that F.MI
wishes to portray this marginalized sector

of society as lazy and cool
to appeal to the fickle
tastes ofTop 40 music fans.
It is just another way for
the record label to make a
little more money while
this music still tops the
charts.
Don't get me wrong. The
songs on this compilation
are quite good. As with
most early p*mk songs,
they .ire iatchv, honest and
likable. In particular,
"Deut seller Girls' by
Adam and the Ants and
"The Greatest Cockney
Ripoff" by the Cockney
Rejects are energetic and
have you singing along be
fore the song is through.
Ihnve\er, that is still no
reason to purchase this
marketing vomiturition. If
vou are at all interested in
am band on this compila
tion, please buy the band's
albums and not this com-

pilation. Metier yet, make a dub from a
I riend.

TESLA
Time's Makin'
Changes

The 80s were truly memorable. Guys
were on their Atari 2600s trying to get the

high score on Pac-Man, and girls were busy
trying to figure out if Axl Rose really didn't
wear any underwear. Everyone assumed that
Michael Jackson was undergoing his 100 th
face lift (and probably his 200 th by now), and
we were shocked by Boy George's revelation
on "Karma Chameleon." And in the midst of
all this excitement, there was a rock band
named Tesla.
On Tesla's new greatest hits compilation,
"Time's Makin' Changes," the band embod
ies all the passion and energy of the '80s. On
"Edison's Medicine,' lead singer left Keith
takes a page from A( "/DCs repertoire with a
gripping, in-your-face anthem while gui
tarist Tommy Skeoch dazzles all with blister
ing, Eddie Van Halen-like guitar solos.
Meanwhile, on "Paradise," Tesla takes a walk
(Mi the flipside with a charming ballad remi
niscent ol Kix's "Don't Close Your Eyes.' And
"Modern Day Cowboy," Tesla's grand sym
phony of guitars, drums and vocals, is an im
itation of the Scorpions glam rock signature.
Tesla definitely offers its greatest songs,
like "Modern Day ( owhoy," "Edison's Medi
cine and "Signs," their wildlv popular single
from the "l ive Man Acoustical lam" album.
Yet, fan favorites such as "Call It What You
Want" and "Did It For The Money" have
been left out.
The album's title, taken from a lyric
from "Changes," is supposed to exemplify
Tesla's ability to keep up with the changing
times of the music industry. Without a
doubt, they have been faithful to their
credo — carefully implementing hard
rock's best elements of the past decade. But
"Steppin' Over," the album's only new sin
gle, is at best a half-hearted effort. It is a
holding pattern for Tesla; Keith's loud,
uninspiring shrill cloaks the band's impo
tent instrumentals.

TESLA
Time's Makin'
Changes

The 80s were truly memorable. Guys
were on their Atari 2600s trying to get the

high score on Pac-Man, and girls were busy
trying to figure out if Axl Rose really didn't
wear any underwear. Everyone assumed that
Michael Jackson was undergoing his 100 th
face lift (and probably his 200 th by now), and
we were shocked by Boy George's revelation
on "Karma Chameleon." And in the midst of
all this excitement, there was a rock band
named Tesla.
On Tesla's new greatest hits compilation,
"Time's Makin' Changes," the band embod
ies all the passion and energy of the '80s. On
"Edison's Medicine,' lead singer left Keith
takes a page from A( "/DCs repertoire with a
gripping, in-your-face anthem while gui
tarist Tommy Skeoch dazzles all with blister
ing, Eddie Van Halen-like guitar solos.
Meanwhile, on "Paradise," Tesla takes a walk
(Mi the flipside with a charming ballad remi
niscent ol Kix's "Don't Close Your Eyes.' And
"Modern Day Cowboy," Tesla's grand sym
phony of guitars, drums and vocals, is an im
itation of the Scorpions glam rock signature.
Tesla definitely offers its greatest songs,
like "Modern Day ( owhoy," "Edison's Medi
cine and "Signs," their wildlv popular single
from the "l ive Man Acoustical lam" album.
Yet, fan favorites such as "Call It What You
Want" and "Did It For The Money" have
been left out.
The album's title, taken from a lyric
from "Changes," is supposed to exemplify
Tesla's ability to keep up with the changing
times of the music industry. Without a
doubt, they have been faithful to their
credo — carefully implementing hard
rock's best elements of the past decade. But
"Steppin' Over," the album's only new sin
gle, is at best a half-hearted effort. It is a
holding pattern for Tesla; Keith's loud,
uninspiring shrill cloaks the band's impo
tent instrumentals.

BLACK GRAPE
It's Great When
You're Straight • • •
Yeah

In .1 hyper-inflation ol bloated egos and
colorless mediocrity, Black Grape kindly
ofler a splash ol infectious excitement. Their
debut album, "It's Great When You're
Straight . .. Yeah," will effortlessly soak you
with fluorescent animation and blockbust
ing tit illation and make you constantly
nag for another spin
l ed by former Happy Mondays helms
man Shaun Ryder, Black (irape carries on a
musical tradition that begins and ends with
the party. Combining the harmonica dri
ven tingle of Blues Traveler with the funk
infused grooves ol Sly and the Family
Stone, "It's (ireat When You're Straight" is
best approached with a "Damn, let's get
down!" kind of goal in mind.
The most talked about track on the
album, "In the Name of the l ather," is a
Hurry of multicultural musical mayhem,
laughingly melting reggae, funk and mid
dle-eastern influences. Packed with subtle
samples, cool effects and splish-splashy
playfulness, the lead track is a microcosm of
all things Black Grape, a wonderful sample
of what this album is soon to offer. "Kelly's
Heroes," another auditory shindig further
along, is bolstered by a devilishly memo
rable guitar lead and a chorus chant that
defies coherent thought structure: "Don't
talk to me about heroes / most of these men
sing like Serbs / Jesus was a black man,
Jesus was Batman / No, no, no — that was
Bruce Wayne!"
Although such lyrical debauchery con
tinues throughout most of the album,
rarely is there a need for clarification. Fu
eled by a restless pulse and a festive attitude,
"It's Great When You're Straight . . . Yeah"
basks in the moment at hand, creating a
soulfulness that can rarely be captured by
the carefully-orchestrated studio approach.

Such spontaneous creativity shines in
tracks like "I ittle Bob," a groovy explo
ration that avoids conventional methods of
songwriting. With a commitment to jam
ming away, the concluding track conveys
the feeling of a great outdoor concert, a
free-floating exploration into synergistic
metamorphosis.
Perhaps that's what makes this band
from Manchester the No. I group in I .on
don and a firestorm in the states "It's
Great When You're Straight is simpb up
lifting.

Punk You: Musit for
the Discerning
Slacker Punk, Vol. I

Punk rock, punk rock, punk rock. Punk
o-freakin'-rama.
Punk rock is the newest fad in popular
music. We have Green Day, Rancid, NoFX,
etc., etc. Whatever you want to call it, punk
rock is big business and it only seems nat
ural that the next logical way to capitalize
on such a fad would be to come out with an
insipid compilation of early punk record
ings.
Well wait no longer, because EMI
Records has just released a compilation en
titled "Punk You: Music For The Discern
ing Slacker Punk, Vol. I." It features early
EMI punkers from '76-'Bl, such as Gener
ation X (Billy Idol's original band), Wire,
Blondie, the Buz/cocks and Adam and the
Ants. Please contain me.
Music for the discerning slacker? The
extended title alone is enough to make you
wretch. The term "slacker" in and of itself
is degrading to the bands who — for the
most part — possessed deep-rooted work
ethic from growing up in lower middle
class environments. The idea is that F.MI
wishes to portray this marginalized sector

of society as lazy and cool
to appeal to the fickle
tastes ofTop 40 music fans.
It is just another way for
the record label to make a
little more money while
this music still tops the
charts.
Don't get me wrong. The
songs on this compilation
are quite good. As with
most early p*mk songs,
they .ire iatchv, honest and
likable. In particular,
"Deut seller Girls' by
Adam and the Ants and
"The Greatest Cockney
Ripoff" by the Cockney
Rejects are energetic and
have you singing along be
fore the song is through.
Ihnve\er, that is still no
reason to purchase this
marketing vomiturition. If
vou are at all interested in
am band on this compila
tion, please buy the band's
albums and not this com-

pilation. Metier yet, make a dub from a
I riend.
