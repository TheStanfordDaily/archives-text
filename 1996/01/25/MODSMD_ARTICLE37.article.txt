Tesla was the one band whose name we
could never remember. And if nobody told
us, we probably wouldn't have known that
tour of their last five albums went plat
inum. But Tesla has definitely been a mover
and a shaker in the rock scene. And they are
right; time is making changes, but for Tesla
with a decade's worth of near-perfect
work behind them — change may not be so
good.
—Lewis I.in

SPACEHOG
Resident Alien

Spacehog's first single conjures up the lat
est in British chic: four pasty-white expatri
ates stomping around New York in vinyl
pants, butterfly collars and wrap-arounds.
An attractive mix of English delicacy and
American muscle, "In the Meantime" is hip
to its bone. It's up-to-date glam, satin-rock, a
go-go boy's wet dream.

The rest of
Spacehog's debut
album, "Resident
Alien," sadly never
again achieves
these seedy
heights. The first
half of the record
is a reluctant stab
at campy bravado,
a half-hearted
tribute to old
Bowie and Queen.
In "Starside,"
Koyston l.ang
don's precious
falsetto stretches
embarrassing ref
erences to
"Starsky and
Hutch" like taffy.
I he whole tiling is
too bland. Suede
did it better.
On the self-refer
ential "Space hog,"
a line like "It's just
5,4,3,2,1 ... baby
I'm a spacehog"

could be just the ticket to tongue-in-cheek ir
reverence, but the glossy, major-label produc
tion strips the song of much-needed irony. It
comes off arbitrary, not funny. "Space is the
Place" is a similar misfire. A daring challenge to
the exclusive queer-straight hang-up gets dry
docked by simple-mindedness. A sample: "Just
because you're fucking him / It doesn't mean
you don't love me /1 )o what you want, be what
you want to be." Then Royston starts shouting
"Oi! Oi! Oi!" and the whole thing degenerates.
There should be a law.
The second half of the album offers some
not-so-bad points. The all-retro "Never
Coming Down (Part I)" delivers, and both
"Only a Few" and"The l ast Dictator" aban
don one-trick glibness for sweet, glittery pop.
The finale, "To Be A Millionaire ... Was It
Likely," is a breezy relief, the only song on the
album you don't have to work to like.
Verdict: artificial and trendy, hut still
worthwhile. Spacey glam offers a happy
medium between retro and rave, between
disco and techno. Spacehog may, in fact, be
the trend of the future — a nice way of saying
they've got a long way to go.

ENYA
The Memory of Trees

-I'iiya Ni Bharonain has built a career out
of making utterly unique music which, at its
introduction, was almost entirely unprece
dented lor popular audiences.
The brilliant success of "Watermark" in
198N underscored both a significant artistic
achievement for Knyaand an important intro
duction of world music to a mass audience.
Unfortunately, Knya's original vision
seems to have ended with the majesty of "Wa
termark." Her subsequent work has been
repetitive and uninspired, a trend that con
tinues with her newest work, "The Memory
of Trees."
The problem is not that her singing is less

beautiful or the music less lovely. The problem
is that she seems to have nothing new to say.
Songs blend together until one track is al
most indistinguishable from the next. F.ach
song flows along easily, lulling the listener
into an almost submissive trance. The music
fails to annoy, but it also fails to enlighten.
The album opens with the title track, "The
Memory of Trees," .111 enchanting song which
seems to promise great things until one real
izes that halfof album is not significantly dif
ferent from this piece.
The next song, "Anywhere Is," actually
succeeds in interrupting the flow of the
album, but only because it seems to mark
Enya's nadir as an artist. The melody is hor
ribly unimaginative, to the point of render
ing the song virtually unlistenable. The
track evokes images of a laboring song

writer, which makes one wonder exactly
how inspired Ftiya was to make this new
album.
Another track, this time notable for its bril
liance, is "Once You Had (iold," a sparse, hvmn
like song, which Knya's majestic voice carries to
ethereal heights. The song is as redeeming as it
is beautiful, coming as close as a song can to
making an entire album worthwhile.
Unfortunately for Hnya, one cannot forget
that her work used to be so much more. "The
Memory of Trees" contains many beautiful
moments and will undoubtedly satisfy many
1 nva fans, but the essential repetitiveness of
the album is difficult to accept.
The irony is that this repetitiveness is the
very antithesis of what initially was Enya's
greatest strength, her originality.
