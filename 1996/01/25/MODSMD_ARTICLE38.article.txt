## Dead Man Walking 
### 
The second directorial outing of
.ictor lim Robbins. who earnered

critics' acclaim tor his political satire "Hob Roberts ', "Deac
Man Walking" tells the tale of an innocent and compassion
ate Louisiana nun who befriends an irascible death row con
vict.
Sister I lelen (Susan Sarandon) insists on helping the pris
oner (Sean Penn) both legally and spiritually when he con
vinces her that he has been unjustly convicted of a crime
\\ hich left two teenagers dead and mutilated in a neighboring
forest. 1 ler decision to assist him understandably upsets tin
victims' families, who denounce her efforts to minister to (Ik
"animal" who murdered their children.
"1 )ead Man Walking' was based upon a novel published ii
1993 by Sister I lelen Prejean, herself a nun who had person
ally visited convicts in prison. "I found myself in this terrible
tension between on the one hand accompanying people oi
death row to their execution and going through it with tin
'unseen victims' — the families of the ones executed," com
ments Prejean about her experiences. Eventually, "I began t<
write, I began to tell all their stories from a point of view o
compassion."

Although the plot of the film may seem
ready-made tor a simple minded critique of
capital punishment, it develops a welcome
degree of balance and credibility — thanks
mostly to Robbins, who, in a stroke ot good
judgment, allows the events of the film to
speak for themselves rather than sentimen
talizing the characters' dilemmas.
The two leads also deserve ample praise
for their restrained portrayals of the central
characters. Sarandon suctesslully conveys
1 lelen s sinceritx and moral confusion, while
Pen 11 s performance swings convincingly be
tween bitterness, gratitude and fear without
romanticizing his fate.
I lie only substantial flaw of the film is the
predictability ot the prisoner's execution,
which allows us to anticipate the convict's in
evitable confrontation with death, as well .is
Sister Helen's intensifying dilemma of sup-

porting both the convict and the victims' families.
On account of this deficiency, "Dead Man Walking"
emerges as a less adept film than it could have been. One can
not help but wish that it explored more than the obvious con

tlict between the opposing interest groups involved in a capital
punishment case, or the evident problems which beset an out
sider who serves as an intermediary between the two.
