The best thing about "From Dusk Till
1 )awn" is that it allows C ieorge (llooney to shut
Tarantino up every time it looks as though he's
about to go off on yet another vintage Taranti
no tirade.
By the time you leave this film, you'll won
der how all the "vampires" are able to suck any
more life out of this unholy mess th 111 it began
with. Although they look like Dracula's ban
ished Central American relatives, these crea
tures aren't vampires. Thev are no more vam
pires than Tarantino is an actor. Instead, they
are grotesque variations on the "Night of the
Living Dead" ghouls.
Directed by Robert Rodriguez ("I I Man
at hi," "Desperado") and originally scripted by
Tarantino, the film begins with (lloonev's Seth
and Iarantino's Richie as two brothers running
away from the law, one a professional thief and
the other one a psychopath. Just guess who
plays which role. They abduct Harvey Keitel's
family, including juliette Lewis and her adopt-

ee! Chinese brother, to get across the border.
Clooney, though appalled by the randomness
with which Richie explodes in maniacal rage, is
still unconditional in his loyalty to his younger
brother. His bad-ass role is a departure from
the compassionate hot-head doctor he plays on
TV's "E.R." He and Keitel, as the preacher
struggling with a loss of faith, alone save the
film from being a complete drain.
The trail of corpses they leave on their way
to Mexico is nothing compared to what hap
pens after they get there. They go to their ren
dezvous point, the Titty Twister, a cavernous
bar filled with writhing, half-naked women,
bikers and truckers. The fun begins, but ends
all too soon, as the women, the bartender, the
bouncer, the band and the pimp turn on their
customers with feverish glee, devouring
everyone in sight.
The gore fest is an over-the-top exercise in
mass mutilation andgetseven more outrageous
when our heroes light back. The battle escalates
as limbs and blood become interchangeable be
tween vampires and humans, the boundaries
between the two crossing intermittently.
It's best to drive a stake through this film and
give it the unnatural death it deserves.
