# Got ID: One quarter on, card use to expand
## 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
Stanford's new universal ID card system
has been in use for a full quarter and ad
ministrators consider both the card and its
attendant debit account feature great suc
cesses, although it has caused some unex
pected problems for student groups.
The computerized identification proce
dures which operate with the new cards
are spreading throughout campus most
notably into the University Libraries sys

tem — and designs are in place to add to
the number of on-campus retailers accept
ing payment through the Stanford Card
Plan.
"I think overall it's been a great success,"
said University Registrar Roger Printup. "A
year ago, I think I here were a lot of skeptics
as to whether we were going to pull this
thing off, but within the past year we were
able to bring up a very sophisticated campus
card system and issue cards to almost
29,000 people.
"We have accomplished what we set out

to do," he added
One of the chief advan
tages of the new system is
1 fiat it protects against use
of Stanford IDs by people
no longer affiliated with
the University. Since reg
istration and employment
status — which can change 5
from day to day — are |
recorded in a database.

computerized card readers
facilitate the verification of a cardholder's

current status.
Next month, the University's libraries
will install card readers at their entrances,
according to Debra Pounds, administrative
assistant in the privileges department of
University Libraries.
According to Pounds, people can now
enter the library by showing an ID card,
whether or not they are currently affiliated
with the University. After card readers are
installed, she said, people will he required to


Printup
swipe their cards through the
reader to gain access to the
library. Staff members will still be
posted at the entrance to super
vise the identification process.
However, at least one campus
group which uses ID cards to ver
ify student registration expressed
dissatisfaction with the new sys
tem.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau
provides free tickets for its events
to registered students who have
not refunded their special fee
from the group. When distribut
ing tickets, the Speakers Bureau
checks whether a student has
requested a fee refund — but lists
can be generated only of students
who have refunded and are regis
tered. People who request tickets
and are not listed may not be reg
istered students at all.
"People who have paid their
special fees will be paying for
graduates and alumni (who still

have ID cards) to attend events,"
said Speakers Bureau Director
Jan Leu.
"There are a lot of ramifica
tions (for use of ID cards) which
perhaps they have not consid
ered," she said.
Printup said groups like
Speakers Bureau can simply
make use of the new technology.
"Any area of the University which
has a need of determining
whether a person is still a student
or still an employee . . . can get
these readers" which cost approx
imately $1,000 each, he said.
But getting a reader is "not a
viable option," said Leu. Requir
ing students to not have refunded
their special fee in order to receive
free tickets is designed to save the
Speakers Bureau money, she said,
and purchasing a reader would
"defeat the whole purpose of try
ing to save money."
Stanford Card Plan to expand
Attached to the new II) cards is
the option to participate in the
Stanford Card Plan, a debit
account for use in on-campus

retail establishments. The card is
currently accepted for payment at
only three campus locations: Bon
Appetit outlets in Tresidder
Union, Cowell Student Health
Center and the athletic ticket
office.
There are currently 1,389 stu
dents using the Stanford Card
Plan, and Bursar Jon Erickson
anticipates that a "fully-imple
mented," campus-wide plan will
have about 4,000 students partic
ipating. The current low enroll
ment can be attributed to "the
limited number of venues in
which the card can be used," he
said.
Now that introductory prob
lems have been ironed out, Erick
son is looking to expand the pro
gram. "We have had bumps in the
road . . . whether it was getting
the hardware working correctly
or getting the coffee cleaned out
of one of the card readers at the
Corner Pocket," he said.
"One of the highest priorities
we have is to try to bring up
Tresidder Express," Erickson
said. "I would hope that by spring

quarter it will be up and running."
Other pending additions to the
Stanford Card Plan include laun
dry and vending machines on
campus, some of which may be
functioning by spring quarter.
"The vending contractor is hav.
ing new vending machines manu
factured as we speak," said Erick
son.
According to Printup, 100 new
machines designed to accept the
cards are on order.
Which locations are selected
will be dictated by considerations
of cost efficiency. "Wilbur is an
ideal setting for the Card Plan
laundry because you've got one
big laundry room and all the
washers and dryers are right
there," he said. "We know the
laundry and vending will not be
appearing on the Row this year."
The Bursar's Office is also
planning to create easier methods
to add money to a Stanford Card
Plan account. Erickson said the
office is looking to install an
ATM-like machine through which
students could access their
accounts.

Other pending additions to the
Stanford Card Plan include laun
dry and vending machines on
campus, some of which may be
functioning by spring quarter.
"The vending contractor is hav.
ing new vending machines manu
factured as we speak," said Erick
son.
According to Printup, 100 new
machines designed to accept the
cards are on order.
Which locations are selected
will be dictated by considerations
of cost efficiency. "Wilbur is an
ideal setting for the Card Plan
laundry because you've got one
big laundry room and all the
washers and dryers are right
there," he said. "We know the
laundry and vending will not be
appearing on the Row this year."
The Bursar's Office is also
planning to create easier methods
to add money to a Stanford Card
Plan account. Erickson said the
office is looking to install an
ATM-like machine through which
students could access their
accounts.
