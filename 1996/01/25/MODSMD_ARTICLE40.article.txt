# Mr.Holland's Opus

### 
When Princi
pal Jacob

(Olympia Dukakis) retires, she gives her "fa
vorite teacher," Mr. Holland (Richard Drey
fuss), a golden compass, instructing him to use
the compass to give direction to his students.
Director Stephen Herek should have used
this compass to give "Mr. Holland's Opus" a
clearer direction. Enhanced by the captivating
musical score and 1 )reyfuss' superb acting, the
movie meanders through 30 years of American
history and of a music teacher's life.
In "Forrest Gump" style, 1 lerek uses histor
ical montages to show the passing of time. He
covers everything from the Warren Commis
sion's report to 1995 federal funding cuts for
the arts. At times the historical events are de
tached and detract from Mr. Holland's story.
1 lowever, 1 lerek creates an intriguing movie.
Patrick Sheane Duncan's script begins as a
trite fairy-tale but rises above simplicity to de
velop complicated and moving characters.
Mr. Holland takes a job as a high school
music teacher to make the money lie needs to
follow his dream of composing a symphony.
Complications arise when his son is born deaf

and he is forced to set aside his composing
dreams.
I )revfuss is exceptionally ordinary. I le takes
his time in every scene with his dialogue and his
facial expressions. Dreyfuss' scenes with lean
Louisa Kelly, who plays a beautiful student
singer, Roweena, are both touching and chilling
because the two share the same passion for
music and connect as I lolland never does with
his wife. Kelly literally glows, especially when
Roweena sings Gershwin's "Someone to Watch
Over Me" to a mesmerized Mr. Holland in a
crowded auditorium.
Herek's depiction of male friendship be
tween Holland and the football coach (lay
Thomas) is refreshing. The comical scenes of
Hollands stint as a drivers education instruc
tor and his first band practices are hilarious.
Despite ils occasional lack ol unity and ten
dency towards sappiness, this is an entertaining
and thought-provoking film. Mr. I lolland tells
his students that music is not just about notes
on a page, but about love, moving people and
emotions. "Mr. Holland's Opus" is not just
about the words of the script. It's about dreams,
family and inspirational teachers who have the
unique abilities to change lives.
