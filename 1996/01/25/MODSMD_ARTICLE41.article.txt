Of course, I can't
speak for you, hut I

have never spent sleepless nights wondering
whether or not Shakespeare was really Fnglish.
Yet, John Malkovich's character in "The (Ion
vent" has made it his life's obsession. 1 lis ensu
ing research into the idea that Shakespeare was
Spanish brings him to a Portuguese monastery
with his estranged wife Helene (Catherine
1 )eneuve).
From the moment of the couple's arrival,
Baltar, the guardian of the convent — played by
the immeasurably talented Luis Miguel ('intra
— is attracted to Helene. He arranges to have
the beautiful but pure Picdade (newcomer
I eonor Silveira) assist the professor in his —
ahem — research, hoping to distract him.
Thrown into this pot of plot is a childishly
reductive version of Goethe's "Faust," a mytho
logical transformation, a supernatural mastur
bation scene and a mysteriously-lighted statue.
The soup that forms is an altogether confusing
and unrealistic movie.

Portuguese director Manoel de Olveira is
undeniably imaginative and has a strong grasp
of epic movie making, effectively creating the
appropriate atmosphere of myth and mystery.
As Deneuve says flatteringly, "I le is not a direc
tor, he is a filmmaker." Lighting and music are
used to add suspense. Vet when set against a
background of flimsy plot and lazy acting, the
somber effects become high melodrama in
stead of profound insight.
Literature becomes a vehicle, as the charac
ters carry around "Faust," reading to each other
in German. It seems we are supposed to infer
that one of the characters is the devil. But which
one? Is Baltar under 1 lelene's spell or vice versa?
Baltar laughs the laugh of I ucifer and he lures
Piedade into the forest to seek revenge for
Helene on her straying husband, yet Helenes
icy teasing keeps Baltar doing her bidding.
Deneuve is cold and, dare I say it, fat. Where
is the sensuously repressed French queen from
"Belle du Jour?" A scene where she emerges
from the water (here, the myth of Helen ofTroy
is obviously evoked) becomes a soap-opera-like
studv in hide-thc-tummy. Why is Baltar the

guardian attracted to her?
Malkovich is his monotone, lizard-like usual
seductive character, although he remains celi
bate during the movie. Yet, this act is getting a
little tiresome and, when coupled with a reced
ing hair line and expanding waistline, even
harder to believe. His acerbic humor ("I hope
there'sadevil — it there isn't, I don't have much
of a career") is as skewed as his sense of scholar
ship. Piedade fulfills her role as the beauty, but
her character is so devout as to be boring.
Still, we must credit the efforts of the new
l uropean Union to make movies by and about
Kurope, and a collaborative effort from no
fewer than five cultures is a I lerculean feat. Hut
plurality is another problematic point: you have
to be a linguist to understand this movie, di
rected in five languages. My paltry four couldn't
keep up, even with color-coded subtitles.
The epilogue brings unintentional and ex
traneous levity to a supposedly serious movie.
Malkovich summed up my response when he
misheard a question 1 asked him last year at a
press conference in Cannes, France: "Did you
say erotic or erratic?" Indeed.

And we never discover whether or not
Shakespeare really was Spanish.
