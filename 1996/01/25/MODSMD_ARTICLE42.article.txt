## Gabriela Teodorescu Psychological theories on unit/ penis envy 
### 
Units.
Here, at the most ivory of ivory towers in the
West (not related to the administration's polit
ically-correct adjective to describe Stanford Le.
"western"), the talk about units, the sheer
number attached to the classes one is taking,
becomes the paradigmatic equivalent of com
paring penis length. It thus leads to another
unique phenomenon which must only happen
at the few, select schools which are on the quar
ter system:
Sigmund Freud would have called it "unit
envy."
However, unlike Freud's simplistic theory,
we intellectual students have made sure to give
unit envy complexity and modifications. It be
gins quite innocently in those weeks when we
are all "shopping" for classes (funny, depite the
term, the University never seems to have semi
annual sales on units or sale racks for unpopu
lar classes).
You're walking or biking across campus
from one of your nine classes, half of which
overlap and thus prevent you from making a

fully-informed decision about the work load,
the professor and the attractiveness of the guy /
girl in the fourth row. In the process, you see an
acquaintance whose name you actually re
member, a person whom you were "good
friends" with at some low point in your fresh
man year and into whom you always seem to
bump at just about this time of the quarter.
Considering that it's a new year and you
haven't seen him or her, you decide to stop (the
probability of stopping increases of course if
they are members of the sexual group you hap
pen to prefer). The conversation goes some
thing like thus, minus the introductory niceties:
"So, what are you taking this quarter?"
"Um, I'm not sure, maybe two Hum Bio
classes, a DR class, a class on the inter-ethnic
problems of Mediterranean cooking and golf."
(This is said with slow pauses, some counting
on fingers to emphasize the sheer number and
putting on a sheepish look to hide the smug
feeling of "unit stamina.")
"Wow, how many units is that?"
"Well, it's really 22, and the ethnic class has

a project. But I'm going to register the DR class
for just four units instead of six so I can get
away without having to petition. What about
you?"
"Uh, well, I, uh, was just going to take 12
units. And probably sailing."
"Twelve units? Isn't that the least you're al
lowed to take?"
"Yeah, but techie classes take sooo much
more time than your classes. I mean, a three
unit techie class, like the EE ones I'm taking this
quarter, arc more like six units each. So, I'm re
ally kind of taking the fuzzy equivalent of 24,1
guess." (This is said in between gestures of
pushing up thick glasses, sticking one's tongue
out and looking up and trying to justify such a
low number.)
"Hmm, interesting. I'll see you around.
Give me a call and we'll do something."
"Sure. Bye."
(Insert subtext: "Hah, he/she will never
make it with that many units. I can't wait to talk
to them after the drop deadline.")
Then, there are those quarters when you

just can't seem to "inch" up to enough units:
the equivalent of "unit impotence." Or the
overachievers who have absolutely no qualms
about unit "length" but seem to brag about
width and tell you the following:
"I'm only taking three units: Physics 4501
Finally, sometimes units are not only some
thing to be envied, but they also have a great
functional value in being able to reject a date to
see some a cappella group on campus, as in:
"What are you doing Friday? Mixed Mendi
cants and Fleet Company are singing."
"Studying. I have sooo many units. I'm try
ing to graduate in three years and then co
term, so I'm taking six classes: one on symbol
ism and Transylvanian wolves, three philoso
phy classes with 1,0()0 pages of reading a week,
two small lit classes and one unit of time man
agement at the Center for Teaching and Learn
ing. I'm really taking like 25 units, but I've
shaved some off."
"So you're studying on Friday night?"
"Yeah, sorry. Hut wait. 1 low many units do
you have?"
