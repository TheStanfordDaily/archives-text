# Students work to salvage building

Though Sequoia 11all will be demolished this spring
to make way for the new Science and Engineering
Quad, students working with the University's Plan
ning Office hope to save some of the building's historic
features for reuse in other campus buildings.
Among die features that might be recyclable are doors
with foil r carved panels and float-glass windows — atype
of glass with an uneven surface — which .ire no longer
manufactured and are quite valuable. They are among
the original installations of the hall, which was the first
all-women's dorm before it was renovated in 1957. It is
the current home of the Statistics Department.
The project was conceived at a meeting last quarter
of the Stanford Energy and Environment Forum, a
group formed last year by students interested in work
ing with faculty and staff to evaluate the soundness of
Stanford's environmental and energy-related policies.
Under the direction of senior Melissa Hung, one of
the group's organizers, and Catherine Palter, environ
mental planner in the Planning Office, volunteers are
providing dimensional descriptions and photographs
of some of the building's features. They will present a
list to the new quad's architects in the hopes that the
builders will be able to use some elements in the new
buildings, according to Hung.
Though the project will likely preserve older, his
toric objects from the hall, the primary goal is "to get as
much recycled as possible so nothing will have to go to
a dump," Hung said.
She added that even if the architects cannot use the
saved features, she hopes to get the features "reused in
some way," perhaps in already existing campus struc
tures.
"The Planning Office thought (the recycling pro
ject | would l)e a good idea," Palter said. She noted that
though the office has conducted similar projects in
other campus buildings, this is the first time it has been
done "formally."
Palter said before any objects are reused, their con
dition. ability to meet building codes and the funding
available to move t hem must Ix? ascertained.
"We have a couple of ideas for where we might use
them," Palter said, but she emphasized that "we're not
sure yet" which buildings would be able to use the
items. The decision to recycle will be made before the
demolit ion process begins in the spring.
Hungsaid in the future her group hopes to continue
working with the Planning Office on such long-term
projects as creat ing a set of environmental policy guide
lines for the University.
