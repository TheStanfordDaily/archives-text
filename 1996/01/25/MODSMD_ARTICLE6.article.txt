# Sculpture garden suffers snakebite
## 
### Molly Stephens Staff writer 
The intricately carved sculptures of
the Papua New Guinea sculpture garden
near Roble Hall attract the attention of
many admirers. They also attract the at
tention of thieves.
A wo;)den carving of a snake was
stolon from the sculpture garden be
tween Jan. 9 and Jan. 11, said Jim
Mason, director of the New Guinea
Sculpture Project. The snake — made of
twisty, medium-dark wood — is 12 feet
long and eight inches in diameter.
Mason said that unlike all the other
sculptures in the garden, the snake carv
ing was not cemented into the ground,
and while hidden, was still moveable. At
the time of the theft, Mason was deciding
where to place it permanently.
"We would like it back," Mason said.
"No charges will be pressed, no questions

asked. We just want it returned. It's a fa
vorite of the garden."
The snake is not the first carving to be
stolen from the garden. In September
1994, unknown suspects removed a
sculpture portraying two elongated ab
stract faces and a female figure. The
sculpture was later recovered after
Mason received information leading to
its location.
Despite the theft of the sculptures,
Mason said he does not plan to increase
security measures. Because the sculp
tures are all cemented into the ground
and many of the sculptures weigh thou
sands of pounds, Mason does not foresee
any problems in the future.
In addition to the two burglaries,
completion of the New Guinea Sculpture
Project — originally scheduled for last
November — has been frustrated by
many delays. However, Mason said the
project is progressing smoothly.

"The project has been an open-ended
artistic process that we have been devel
oping as we go along," Mason said. "The
various aspects of design and construc
tion took longer than expected.
"I work slow," he said. "I'm an obses
sive perfectionist."
The sculpture garden, which boasts
40 carvings from 10 artists representing
two different cultural groups in Papua
New Guinea, is scheduled to open in late
spring or early summer, Mason said. The
project will be completed with the addi
tions of a lighting system similar to that
used in the Rodin Sculpture Garden and
signs that explain the stories behind the
sculptures. U.S. Ambassador to Aus
tralia Bill Lane and his wife recently
made a donation allowing the completion
of the signs.
Mason asks that anyone with infor
mation on the location of the stolen
snake carving call him at 641-5021.
