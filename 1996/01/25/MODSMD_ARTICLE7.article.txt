Doug Donaldson has an inter
esting perception of himself.
"There is a crazy man loose
tonight that's going to be talking
here," Donaldson said. "I swear.
I know him well."
Donaldson, head of the Sub
way Development Corporation of
New England — a division of the
sandwich chain — spoke to a
rainy-night group of 25 people
last night in Cubberley Auditori
um, sharing numerous stories
and experiences as a business
man and a professional baseball
umpire.
During his speech, titled
"From Head Screwball to Head

Iloncho: How a Screw-up King
Became King Sandwich Artist,"
Donaldson kept the audience
laughing as he talked about, the
difference between perception
and reality.
He illustrated this difference
by discussing his 20 years as an
amateur and professional um
pire, saying that the game on the
field is not always the same as it
appears in the stands.
For example, he showed the
audience a picture of Los Angeles
Dodgers Manager Tommy La
sorda face-to face with an um

team is playing lousy. Can I stay
out here and yell at you for a
while?' " Donaldson said.
Donaldson, who is currently
the umpire in chief of the Big
East Baseball Conference,
explained that what is in a mas
cot's water bottle may not neces
sarily be water.
"When a mascot offers you a
water bottle, you have no idea what

is in that thing,' he said, comment -
ing that he preferred when the bot
tle was filled with rum.
Donaldson also discussed his
beginnings with the fast-food
chain Subway. I le bought his first
store in Vernon, Conn., in 1982.
"I hated the business," he said.
"1 had to work every hour myself. 1
lived 45 minutes away from this
place, and we were only closed eight
hours a day, so 1 would often sleep
in the store. I did not have a shower
in my store; I did not have a shower
for five or six days at a time."
Since then, Subway has experi

enced tremendous growth by tak
ing a goal-oriented approach, and
Donaldson has gone along for the
ride.
"What did I have to do with
it?" he a.sked. "Nothing!"
Subway is currently on a drive
to replace McDonald's as the
largest franchise in the world.
Under the leadership of founder
Fred DeLuca, Subway recently
met a goal by opening 8,000
stores over 10 years.
"I was at the meeting when he
announced this goal," Donaldson
said. "I wet my pants."

said. "Wo all graduated from the

But, the company kept on getting
a little bit better all the time."
At the end of his talk, in a ran
serious moment, he urged audi
ence members to understanc
their perceptions of others.
"You have got to know a little
about yourself, and what percep
tions you're putting out," he said
"Knowing the way others per
ceive you gives you power. That's
important for vou to know."
