You are cordially invited to attend a very special happy hour today at
5 p.m. in the Daily office. Not only will it be the last happy hour of Vol. 208
(moment of silence, please), but we will also be hosting the John S. Knight
Fellows, professional journalists who are spending the year at Stanford.
It's your chance to eat, drink and shmooze with people who do this kind of
work for a living. Maybe you'll get a good lead on a job. Or you could just
come to see all those wonderful Daily editors. After all, the food is free.
