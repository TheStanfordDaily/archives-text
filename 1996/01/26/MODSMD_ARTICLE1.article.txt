## EV residents learn the joy of gardening 
### Kristie Lilje Smith Contributing writer 
Nestled in what many around campus
would call the run-down living area of
Escondido Village, there is a Garden
Eden. A garden of tomatoes, a garden of
flowers and a garden of trees.
With some high-powered gardening
strategies and a love for the land, the res
idents of Escondido have created a blos
soming patch of veggies, fruits and flow
ers of all types. And with new garden co
ordinator Debbie Wood in charge, many
more people will be able to reap t he joy of
gardening faster than ever before.

Wood arrived at Stanford this fall
from Georgia after her husband was ac
cepted to the doctoral program in eco
nomics. After approaching the Escondi
do staff about acquiring a garden plot,
Student Affairs Specialist for Graduate
Residences Patricia Pickett asked
Wood if she would be interested in as
suming the vacant garden coordinator

position. Wood accepted the volunteer
job and immediately began to organize
what she calls a "poorly managed" gar
den area.
The garden area was moved from the
Rains area to Escondido about eight
years ago when Rains opened, said ()ffice

garden had been located in Rains
prior to moving to Escondido, "the
garden is ancient," Ward said.
One reason the University
decided to set aside and finance an
area for a community garden may
have to do with the location of
Stanford.
"The unusual Bay Area micro
climate — close to a Mediter
ranean-type climate with dry and
wet seasons and fairly moderate
temperatures throughout the year
— makes Stanford, a great place to
garden,^Wo<xi explained. Current

Wood said.
Elizabeth Andrews is a resident
of Escondido who gardens at Stan
ford. "There's camaraderie in gar
dening," she said. "I've met some
of the nicest people there."
Andrews did express a wish for bet
ter management of the garden,
though.
Wood said her goal as coordina
tor is to make sure that the area is
better managed. One of her many
challenges has been to delineate
which of the plots are taken and
which ones are vacant. According
to Wood, the original plots were 10
by 18 feet in size, but have since
been subdivided several times.
Problems with the plots in the past
have ranged from basic neglect to
encroachment, which Wood said
could be eliminated if the plots
were clearly marked and staked off
from one another.
Residents moving in and out of

Escondido without notifying any
one has also created a problem
with managing the garden plots in
the past, but Wood said she hopes
to keep better records. In fact, last
quarter she was busy establishing
a master list of gardeners and a
way to contact them.
In November, the gardeners
had their first organized meeting
and outlined rules for gardening in
the area. One of the key courtesies
the gardeners request is that the
gardens be kept organic.
"We are trying to keep the soil
as pure as possible by asking the
gardeners to use organic gardening
techniques rather than pesticides,"
she said.
Many residents are also putting
nutrients back into the soil with
out the use of fertilizers by com
posting old plants, Wood said.
According to Wood, the ground's
crews in Escondido are also helping
with this process by depositing
raked up leaves into the garden
area so that they can be recycled
back into the soil.
Eredi Hauri, another resident
who has been gardening in Escon
dido for about one year, specializes
in biointensive gardening using a
process called double digging. Dou
ble digging is a way to keep the
r<x)ts growing down into the soil
rather than laterally, Hauri
explained. The plants can tap down
into the soil for water and nutri
ents this way and can be grown
closer together which saves land
and water as well, she said.
As Wood explained, the garden
meetings also provide another way
of sharing tips and information to
each other about these organic
techniques.
"We are also in the process of
establishing an e-mail distribution

list so that the gardeners can more
easily communicate tips and infor
mation," she added.
Several other improvements
were made last quarter, Wood said.
"We were thankful to have some of
the overgrown tree limbs trimmed
recently, which opened up some
more plots to sunlight," she said.
"The University also replaced the
heads on the water spigots in the
garden, which makes hooking up
the water hoses much easier," she
added.
Although Wood has made sever
al organizational improvements
within the last quarter, she said
she would still like to have a way to
fund the purchase of the common
tools and equipment needed to
increase the quality and efficiency
of the garden area.
"Here at Stanford, there is no
established budget or means of get
ting money to purchase the tools
and equipment we need," Wood
said.
"It's interesting to note that
each of the Escondido courtyards
has a paid graduate resident assis
tant and has housing funds avail
able to pay for courtyard social
events such as pizza parties," she
explained. "Yet, the position of gar
den coordinator is completely vol
untary and as many families and
students are represented in our
garden community as in a typical
social event, but with no funds
allotted."
Carol Nyholm, the assistant
director for Escondido Village
and administrator in charge of
disbursing these funds, said
Escondido housing funds are
divided among 23 neighborhoods
on the basis of community make
up. Couples and singles pay $20
per quarter, whereas families

only pay $10 per quarter, she
said. Eseondido has a master
account which funds events for
the entire community, but within
each of the 23 neighborhoods, the
GRAs are responsible for decid
ing how the money is spent, she
explained.
However, the University does
not charge Stanford residents any
special fees to use the garden —
unlike many other community
gardens. For instance, Palo Alto
has four garden areas available to
the community, according to
Senior Ranger for Palo Alto Gor
don Bailie Although the city sub
sidizes the amount of money
needed to maintain the gardens,
residents are still charged 10
cents per square foot of space,
which works out to about $30-$4O
per year for most people, he said.
Each of the four gardens in
Palo Alto is run by a volunteer
garden coordinator, whose duties
are similar to Wood's at Stanford,
Bailie said. The four gardens are
also strictly organic, he
explained.
Another difference between
the Stanford and Palo Alto gar
dens is that the wait ing time for a
garden plot in Palo Alto, even
with four gardens available,
ranges from two to three years,
Bailie said. At Stanford, the wait
ranges from two weeks to one
quarter, Wood explained.
"We are very grateful that the
garden area has been made avail
able to the [Eseondido] families
and students. It has provided a
great sense of personal satisfac
tion and wonderful vegetables and
flowers for the residents here,"
Wood said. "There's nothing quite
like biting into a homegrown sun
ripened tomato off the vine."

garden had been located in Rains
prior to moving to Escondido, "the
garden is ancient," Ward said.
One reason the University
decided to set aside and finance an
area for a community garden may
have to do with the location of
Stanford.
"The unusual Bay Area micro

Elizabeth Andrews is a resident
of Escondido who gardens at Stan
ford. "There's camaraderie in gar
dening," she said. "I've met some
of the nicest people there."
Andrews did express a wish for bet
ter management of the garden,
though.
Wood said her goal as coordina
tor is to make sure that the area is
better managed. One of her many
challenges has been to delineate
which of the plots are taken and
which ones are vacant. According
to Wood, the original plots were 10
by 18 feet in size, but have since
been subdivided several times.
Problems with the plots in the past
have ranged from basic neglect to
encroachment, which Wood said
could be eliminated if the plots
were clearly marked and staked off
from one another.
Residents moving in and out of

Escondido without notifying any
one has also created a problem
with managing the garden plots in
the past, but Wood said she hopes
to keep better records. In fact, last
quarter she was busy establishing
a master list of gardeners and a
way to contact them.
In November, the gardeners
had their first organized meeting
and outlined rules for gardening in
the area. One of the key courtesies
the gardeners request is that the
gardens be kept organic.
"We are trying to keep the soil
as pure as possible by asking the
gardeners to use organic gardening
techniques rather than pesticides,"
she said.
Many residents are also putting
nutrients back into the soil with
out the use of fertilizers by com
posting old plants, Wood said.
According to Wood, the ground's
crews in Escondido are also helping
with this process by depositing
raked up leaves into the garden
area so that they can be recycled
back into the soil.
Eredi Hauri, another resident
who has been gardening in Escon
dido for about one year, specializes
in biointensive gardening using a
process called double digging. Dou
ble digging is a way to keep the
r<x)ts growing down into the soil
rather than laterally, Hauri
explained. The plants can tap down
into the soil for water and nutri
ents this way and can be grown
closer together which saves land
and water as well, she said.
As Wood explained, the garden
meetings also provide another way
of sharing tips and information to
each other about these organic
techniques.
"We are also in the process of
establishing an e-mail distribution

list so that the gardeners can more
easily communicate tips and infor
mation," she added.
Several other improvements
were made last quarter, Wood said.
"We were thankful to have some of
the overgrown tree limbs trimmed
recently, which opened up some
more plots to sunlight," she said.
"The University also replaced the
heads on the water spigots in the
garden, which makes hooking up
the water hoses much easier," she
added.
Although Wood has made sever
al organizational improvements
within the last quarter, she said
she would still like to have a way to
fund the purchase of the common
tools and equipment needed to
increase the quality and efficiency
of the garden area.
"Here at Stanford, there is no
established budget or means of get
ting money to purchase the tools
and equipment we need," Wood
said.
"It's interesting to note that
each of the Escondido courtyards
has a paid graduate resident assis
tant and has housing funds avail
able to pay for courtyard social
events such as pizza parties," she
explained. "Yet, the position of gar
den coordinator is completely vol
untary and as many families and
students are represented in our
garden community as in a typical
social event, but with no funds
allotted."
Carol Nyholm, the assistant
director for Escondido Village
and administrator in charge of
disbursing these funds, said
Escondido housing funds are
divided among 23 neighborhoods
on the basis of community make
up. Couples and singles pay $20
per quarter, whereas families

only pay $10 per quarter, she
said. Eseondido has a master
account which funds events for
the entire community, but within
each of the 23 neighborhoods, the
GRAs are responsible for decid
ing how the money is spent, she
explained.
However, the University does
not charge Stanford residents any
special fees to use the garden —
unlike many other community
gardens. For instance, Palo Alto
has four garden areas available to
the community, according to
Senior Ranger for Palo Alto Gor
don Bailie Although the city sub
sidizes the amount of money
needed to maintain the gardens,
residents are still charged 10
cents per square foot of space,
which works out to about $30-$4O
per year for most people, he said.
Each of the four gardens in
Palo Alto is run by a volunteer
garden coordinator, whose duties
are similar to Wood's at Stanford,
Bailie said. The four gardens are
also strictly organic, he
explained.
Another difference between
the Stanford and Palo Alto gar
dens is that the wait ing time for a
garden plot in Palo Alto, even
with four gardens available,
ranges from two to three years,
Bailie said. At Stanford, the wait
ranges from two weeks to one
quarter, Wood explained.
"We are very grateful that the
garden area has been made avail
able to the [Eseondido] families
and students. It has provided a
great sense of personal satisfac
tion and wonderful vegetables and
flowers for the residents here,"
Wood said. "There's nothing quite
like biting into a homegrown sun
ripened tomato off the vine."
Nestled in what many around campus
would call the run-down living area of
Escondido Village, there is a Garden
Eden. A garden of tomatoes, a garden of
flowers and a garden of trees.
With some high-powered gardening
strategies and a love for the land, the res
idents of Escondido have created a blos
soming patch of veggies, fruits and flow
ers of all types. And with new garden co
ordinator Debbie Wood in charge, many
more people will be able to reap t he joy of
gardening faster than ever before.

Wood arrived at Stanford this fall
from Georgia after her husband was ac
cepted to the doctoral program in eco
nomics. After approaching the Escondi
do staff about acquiring a garden plot,
Student Affairs Specialist for Graduate
Residences Patricia Pickett asked
Wood if she would be interested in as
suming the vacant garden coordinator

position. Wood accepted the volunteer
job and immediately began to organize
what she calls a "poorly managed" gar
den area.
The garden area was moved from the
Rains area to Escondido about eight
years ago when Rains opened, said ()ffice
