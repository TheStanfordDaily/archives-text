# Government will stay open through March 15
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - With Republi
cans bruised by two government shut
downs, the House overwhelmingly
approved legislation yesterday to keep
federal agencies running through March
15. The White House said President Clin
ton would sign it as the yearlong budget
fires cooled on all fronts.
After settling an impasse with the
White House over abortion restrictions
and spending levels, the House voted 371-
42 for a stopgap measure that would tem
porarily finance dozens of federal agen
cies, though at lower levels than 1995.
The Senate was expected to approve the
legislation today.
"Let's quit wasting the taxpayers'
money," said House Appropriations Com
mittee Chairman Bob Livingston, R-La.,
the GOP's rallying cry all year. But
reflecting his party's new, less confronta
tional mode, he added, "Let's keep the
government open."
"We're satisfied that a lot of give-and
take has produced an agreement the pres
ident can live with," White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said.
Lawmakers had faced a deadline
tonight that if breached would see civil
servants furloughed for an embarrassing
third time since November.
After taking a drubbing in public opin
ion polls for their confrontational tactics,
Republicans were no longer vowing to
halt government's most basic functions
unless their demands for a balanced bud
get in seven years were met. With this
fall's elections on their minds, both sides
seemed to feel the best path, for now, was
to settle immediate differences and save
their most stubborn disputes over Medi
care, Medicaid and welfare until next
year.
But all the embers from the budget
inferno were not dead. Despite an apparent
truce over extending the debt limit and
pressure from Wall Street to do so, the two
sides fenced over how it would be accom
plished.

"Since I gave the State of the Union
address, there have been some encourag
ing things said by the congressional lead
ers," Clinton told mayors visiting the
White House, continuing the positive
tone he took in that speech. "But I would
remind you that we still have some road
blocks in the way that I think need to be
cleared away."
For the next seven weeks, the stopgap
spending measure would finance many
agencies whose 1996 budgets are incom
plete, including the departments of Veter
ans Affairs, Interior and Labor and the
Environmental Protection Agency. Most
would receive less than they got in 1995,
and 10 minor programs — such as money
for the native Hawaiian and Alaska
native cultural arts — would be eliminat
ed. None of Clinton's major initiatives
would be cut below 75 percent of last
year's levels.
"Nobody wants to close down the gov
ernment," said House Appropriations
Committee Chairman Bob Livingston, R-
La., reflecting GOP leaders' new strategy
of disavowing confrontation as a tool for
pressing their budget ideology.
The measure included $12 billion for
foreign aid for the rest of the fiscal year.
In a compromise between conserva
tives and abortion-rights lawmakers, the
measure would block U.S. funds to inter
national family planning programs, but
only until July. After that, the money
could be dispersed, though at just 65 per
cent of last year's levels. The program
would thus spend $367 million over the
next year and a half.
It also would limit embryo research.
In addition, travel restrictions would
be slapped on many Cabinet officers, a
clear poke at the controversial trips of
Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary and
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. And in
a symbolic win for the OOP's effort to
shrink government, congressional offi
cials were ordered to sell a House office
building.
