Pan Am returns
NEW YORK (AP) - Pan Am, the
defunct airline whose distinctive blue
globe logo remains one of the world's
best known trademarks, may be coming
back.
Former Pan Am executive Martin
Shugrue and Miami real estate develop
er Charles Cobb are reportedly close to
raising $30 million to fund the new ven
ture.
Cobb, who paid $1.3 million in a
bankruptcy court auction for Pan Am's
name, said he already has invested sev
eral million dollars in the new airline.
Pan American World Airways closed
in December 1991 after years of losses
and heavy debts forced it into bankrupt
cy earlier that year.
Under the proposed deal, Cobb would
be chairman and Shugrue would be
president and chief executive, Cobb said.
Shugrue didn't immediately return
phone calls.
The new Pan Am would be a domes
tic carrier, offering international con
nections and fares about half the price of
existing airlines.
Initially it would serve Miami, New
York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San
Francisco — a far cry from the days
when Pan Am pioneered international

air travel. The operation still needs to
get federal government approval.
Pregnant runaway found
HOUSTON (AP) — A girl who disap
peared after claiming she was 10 years
old and 8 1/2 months pregnant was
found with a phony birth certificate and
is probably about 14, authorities said
yesterday.
Police also discovered that the girl
they knew as Cindy Garcia is actually an
illegal immigrant from Mexico named
Adella Quintana.
The girl's flight from social workers
earlier in the week prompted a desper
ate hunt because of fears that she was
endangering her life and that of her
unborn child.
Police found her with her 22-year-old
boyfriend, Pedro Sotelo, hiding in a
Houston apartment Wednesday night.
Sotelo was jailed under $200,000 bail on
a charge of aggravated sexual assault
and could receive a sentence of life in
prison.
"The certificate that we had is the
only documentation of her age and
apparently a fake," said Linda Edwards,
a spokeswoman for the Texas Depart
ment of Protective and Regulatory Ser
vices. "We think she's about 14. We
don't know exactly."
