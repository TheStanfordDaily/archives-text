## Editorial Staffing CSRE 
### 
University needs to
re-examine faculty
appointment process

CONFUSION AND misunder
standing are at the heart of
the current problems plaguing
the faculty appointment process for
the new interdisciplinary program in
Comparative Studies on Race and
Ethnicity. Solving the controversy
will take more than just papering
over the differences.
Grace Kao, a doctoral candidate in
sociology at the University of Chica
go, was offered a position in the Soci
ology Department. Believing that
Kao could also teach courses in the
Asian American Studies component
of CSRE, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven endorsed the
offer.
The primary responsibility in this
case was to fill the billet in the sociol
ogy department. The fact that pro
fessors slated to teach courses in
CSRE would be hired by other estab
lished departments was never in
doubt, and Kao's ability and qualifi
cations to teach sociology were not in
question.
The apparent problem was that
Shoven offered the joint appoint
ment even as members of the Asian
American Studies curriculum com
mittee — the panel which is guiding
the process of creating this new field
— suggested that Kao was not quali
fied to toach Asian American Stud
ies. History Prof. Gordon ("hang and
graduate student Siu, two repre
sentatives on the committee, said
they were displeased with the choice
of Kao, finding her work and
research in that field to be "some
what limited."
Shoven's actions were perceived
as high-handed. Siu went so far as to
say that Shoven "had not been
respectful" of the selection process
and had disregarded the recommen
dations of the committee. Siu also
claimed that Shoven broke a verbal

agreement with members of the
campus group Concerned Students
for Asian American Studies. Mem
bers who thought they could speak
with Kao about her qualifications at
a meeting were instead told that
such questions were "inappropri
ate."
In the past, committee members
said, Shoven has been hesitant to
formalize a set of specific procedures
for choosing people to fill posts in
CSRE. But in making the controver
sial decision that Kao should teach
Asian American Studies, he has
highlighted the need for institution
al guidelines.
These guidelines must also go
beyond requirements for the hiring
process alone. No one has really been
able to determine who would be a
"qualified" CSRE instructor.
Shoven's own interpretation obvi
ously does not match that of com
mittee members. Shoven, the com
mittee and CSAAS should come to
some agreement for the criteria they
will all use to judge and rank schol
ars who wish to teach CSRE tracks,
even though such instructors will be
hired through other departments.
Finally, student opinion should
not be neglected in the decisions.
During last year's debates over the
creation of CSRE, students were
promised a voice in the hiring pro
cess of any professor who was to
teach CSRE. Even though this case
may simply be bad timing, in bypass
ing the opinions of CSAAS, Shoven
has cast doubt in many students'
minds concerning whether his
promise will be honored when future
joint billets come up for review.
If CSRE is to gain credibility as a
program, then steps must be taken
to ensure that all parties are consult
ed before decisions are made. Siu
was correct in calling for a set of for
malized procedures and criteria to
prevent miscommunication and
keep mixed expectations from form
ing. The arbitrary appointment of
professors to positions hardly gives
CSRE the prestige and reputation it
will need to thrive, or to compete
with ethnic studies programs at
other institutions.
