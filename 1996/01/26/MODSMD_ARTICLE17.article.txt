## Juice boost me, please 
### 
LAST WEEKEND WAS terrible
enough, and then my friend asked
me if I wanted to go to Juice Club.
"No," I said. "I hate that place." Then she
said she would pay for mine. I wanted to
ask, "Will that change the fact that it's still
just juice?" Instead, I reluctantly agreed to
go, and before I knew it, I was paying for
both of us because she "forgot" her wallet.
"Yes, could I have two, uh, juices
please?"
"Sure. That'll be $32.50."
My "friend" hasn't paid me back yet,
but this isn't a column about her. It's a col
umn about juice and the exclusive organi
zation that controls it — Juice Club.
"Freshman year, I just didn't get it,"
admitted senior Bryan Hwang. "I won
dered, 'Is it really a club? Do you need a
membership or something?' "
Hwang's worries were weighty indeed,
but as I surveyed the 100-strong Palo Alto
High work force behind the counter (four
blenders, one-half square foot floor space
per kid), the foremost question in my mind
remained.
"So this place just sells juice, right?"
An EBP 1 resident who wished to be iden
tified only as "an EBF resident" replied,
"Yeah, but they mix it all up and put stuff
in it. It's crazy."
Crazy was clearly the correct word for
the Juice Club crowd. In the space of 15
minutes, I almost got into two fights. One
granola-fed, long-haired creeper impa
tiently tapped my shoulder because he felt
I was causing the line to lag a bit. Then a
quietly desperate yuppie drone wanted to

kick iny ass for standing in front of the
straws too long.
These two men, along with till the other
juice fiends in the place, were thinking only
one thing: "I need my juice, man."
The Juice Club has always enjoyed
undeserved popularity, but these guys
were junkies. Juice Club employee
"Mitch," a chronic inner-ear bleeder due to
prolonged exposure to blender noise,
explained how the business finally crossed
the line between club and cult — the new
1996 menu, a few samples of which I give
below.
Scoop O' Dirt
The first of the club's new "juice addi
tions" takes you to the outer limits of
health consciousness. Vitamins and wheat
germ are for squares because now your two
free additions will get you a good trowel
full of soil in your Strawberries Wild.
There's nothing more earthy than a good
chunk of the mother planet herself.
Wheat Grass (If You Know What Wc
Mean)
That's right, the Juice Club has
matured beyond denial and now realizes
the type of people who patronize it. A cou
ple scoops of this wacky herb in your juice
gets you through your 10 o'clock and gives
a whole new meaning to the phrase, "Man,
I've been going to the Juice Club way too
much!"
I)orm Juice
Straight out of the Roble Hall juice dis

penser and into your reusable mug, this
high-viscosity stuff is from concentrate!
Complete with little, dead fruit (lies float
ing around in it.
North Carolina Twister
The club's juice technicians slip a few
Marlboro Reds into this milkshake and
then whip it up for that smooth tobacco
taste. Tar: 4 oz.
Weil-Being
The first in the Juice Club's new line of
intangible juice additions. Ask for one or
two shots of this stuff to infuse your
smoothie and yourself with a general sense
of serenity. Also, try a scoop of machismo if
you're one of the Club's regular male visi
tors. Chances are you could use some.
Heroin
Look out — Lou Reed's favorite is here!
Caffeine is for pansies, but nothing keeps
you up all night like a couple doses of
"junk" in your Finals Flip. You'll get your
paper done and feel like Jesus' son.
The Juice Club cannot be ignored,
because it has everything you need. This
very moment, people you know are search
ing for their own souls and finding nothing
but an empty space echoing with the hol
low desire for juice.
