There's an old toast that says something about
hoping that the road will always rise to meet your
feet to speed you on your trip. For Stanford this
year, it's been more like the road rising to slam
itself into the Cardinal's face.
Washington (11-4 overall, 4-2 Pacific 10 Con
ference) was the most recent stop on the Stanford
Frustration Tour. The Cardinal (10-5, 4-3)
dropped a cardiac decision 71-71 to the Huskies as
two last-second three-pointers missed the mark.
Down 16 points with only seven minutes, 31 sec
onds to play in the second half, the Cardinal sud
denly found the toughness and desire that had
been absent the previous 33 minutes. With head
coach Mike Montgomery sitting most of the veter
ans for the second half, the comeback was started
by Stanford's freshman unit.
Outscoring the Huskies 23-8 over the next
seven minutes, the Cardinal pulled within one on
two free throws by Peter Sauer with 24.7 seconds
left. After two free throws by Washington fresh
man Donald Watts pushed it to a three-point lead,
Stanford set up a play to run Dion Cross off a
series of screens to get open for a game-tying shot.
Cross' shot was off the mark, but Brevin
Knight corralled the ball on the wing in time for a
desperation attempt. It also missed, and Stanford
was again left with a case of the "could-have
beens."
"I can't tell you why against Oregon State we go
up 18-2 and never look back and then against
Washington we go down (8-01," Knight said. "We
were never Stanford tonight. Our intensity wasn't

in it.
"We had a chance to tie and that's good," Mont
gomery said. "But I'm more concerned with the
way we played overall."
Like the UCLA road game two weeks ago, Stan
ford dug itself into a hole early on, falling behind
14-3 seven minutes into the game. A three-pointer
by Andy Poppink — part of a career-high 28, along
with 11 rebounds — cut the score to 16-13
Huskies, but the Cardinal could never take control
of the game.
