There's an old toast that says something about
hoping that the road will always rise to meet your
feet to speed you on your trip. For Stanford this
year, it's been more like the road rising to slam
itself into the Cardinal's face.
Washington (11-4 overall, 4-2 Pacific 10 Con
ference) was the most recent stop on the Stanford
Frustration Tour. The Cardinal (10-5, 4-3)
dropped a cardiac decision 71-71 to the Huskies as
two last-second three-pointers missed the mark.
Down 16 points with only seven minutes, 31 sec
onds to play in the second half, the Cardinal sud
denly found the toughness and desire that had
been absent the previous 33 minutes. With head
coach Mike Montgomery sitting most of the veter
ans for the second half, the comeback was started
by Stanford's freshman unit.
Outscoring the Huskies 23-8 over the next
seven minutes, the Cardinal pulled within one on
two free throws by Peter Sauer with 24.7 seconds
left. After two free throws by Washington fresh
man Donald Watts pushed it to a three-point lead,
Stanford set up a play to run Dion Cross off a
series of screens to get open for a game-tying shot.
Cross' shot was off the mark, but Brevin
Knight corralled the ball on the wing in time for a
desperation attempt. It also missed, and Stanford
was again left with a case of the "could-have
beens."
"I can't tell you why against Oregon State we go
up 18-2 and never look back and then against
Washington we go down (8-01," Knight said. "We
were never Stanford tonight. Our intensity wasn't
•x »
in it.
"We had a chance to tie and that's good," Mont
gomery said. "But I'm more concerned with the
way we played overall."
Like the UCLA road game two weeks ago, Stan
ford dug itself into a hole early on, falling behind
14-3 seven minutes into the game. A three-pointer
by Andy Poppink — part of a career-high 28, along
with 11 rebounds — cut the score to 16-13
Huskies, but the Cardinal could never take control
of the game.

A key play came with four min
utes to play in the first half, as
David Harbour was called for an
intentional foul on a breakaway
by Washington's Mark Sanford
just after the Cardinal had cut the
deficit to three. Sanford sunk
both free throws and Jason
Hamilton hit a three-pointer on
the ensuing possession, pushing
the lead back to eight. Washing
ton led 37-29 at halftime.
"We should never have been in
that position," Poppink said. "It
took us getting down before we
put in a concentrated effort."
Poppink and Sanford proceed
ed to trade baskets at the start of
the second half. Poppink scored
eight of the Cardinal's first 10
and Sanford hit for 10 of the
Huskies' first 14, totalling 24 on
the night.
Stanford should have known it
would get no breaks when San
ford broke ahead of the pack for a
monster dunk later in the second
stanza. After taking the ball
behind his head with his right
hand, the thunderous throw
down bounced off the back rim
only to shoot straight up into the
air and back through the hoop,
giving Washington its biggest lead
at 18 with 11:54 to play.
"We weren't ready to play
tonight," Montgomery said.
"Washington was way more ready

than us. They were the aggressor,
and we couldn't execute."
Montgomery went with the
youth brigade for much of the sec
ond half due to a combination of
illness and poor play. Senior Dar
ren Allaway could only muster 14
minutes because of the flu, and
the backcourt of Cross, Knight
and Harbour shot a combined 7-
for-28.
"They weren't getting it done,"
Montgomery said. "I had to find
somebody who could score the
ball. We found a combination of
young guys who could make some
plays."
Mark Seaton and Kris Weems
each chipped in eight points and
Peter Sauer added six. Overall,
the bench scored 25, the third
straight game the reserves tallied
more than 20 points.
Seaton and Sauer each had
four offensive rebounds, showing
a greater desire for the ball than
the Huskies down the stretch
despite the presence of one or two
seven-footers under the hoop.
The towering duo of Patrick
Femerling and Todd MacCulloch
caused Stanford problems much
of the night. With Allaway play
ing limited minutes, Poppink
and Harbour often found them
selves battling the Husky behe
moths in the lane. MacCulloch
was especially troublesome,
blocking five shots and scoring
13 points.
As well as foiling many offen
sive attempts, Washington's size
forced Stanford out of its seldom

used 2-3 zone in the first half
because of rebounding difficulty.
Now, the Cardinal must make
the difficult journey, both physi
cally and psychologically, to Pull
man to battle Washington State
tomorrow at 3 p.m. Although the
Cougars (8-6, 1-5) haven't lived
up to preseason predictions,
WSU's Friel Court always always
proves to be a formidable venue
for Stanford.
Also, Washington State will
have the services of the versatile
Mark Hendrickson back. The 6-
foot-9 senior fractured his left
hand Dec. 27 and has been out
ever since. Before going down, he
was averaging 17 points and 9.9
rebounds.
Hendrickson returned to
action last night against Cal,
pouring in 27 points and 14
rebounds in a losing effort. It was
Hendrickson's 35th career dou
ble-double.
The Cougars are led by junior
guard Isaac Fontaine, the leading
returning scorer in the Pac-10
this year. Fontaine averages 19.5
points per game along with 6.4
rebounds from his guard/forward
position.
Point guard Dominic Ellison
had been sidelined two weeks ago
for acadmic reasons but has
returned to action. He may or may
not start, according to Washing
ton State coach Kevin Eastman.
Stanford split with the
Cougars last year, losing 77-63 in
Pullman but winning 79-72 at
Maples.
