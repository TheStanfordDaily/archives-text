# Prof, studies computer networks

Words like elaine, forsythe and axess
are common enough in the Stanford vo
cabulary.
But a federally funded study has found
that although computers are an essential
part of life at many universities, some fac
ulty and students still don't realize the
ramifications of computer networking.
The 15-month study, headed by Syra
cuse University Prof. Charles McClure, in

cluded visits to three unidentified research
universities and a series of interviews with
technology experts in higher education.
"It's kind of like God and apple pie and
Chevrolet: It's perceived to be a good
thing... . But when you say, 'How do you
know?' then the conversation becomes
silent," McClure said in an article in the
Chronicle of Higher Education last week.
According to Sandra Senti, director of
Networking Systems at Stanford, the Uni
versity has served as a model for other

schools in introducing technology on ami
pus.
Some departments were connected to
the University network in 1982. Stan
ford's Residential Computer Coordinator
program, which consists of students who
help their peers use technology in dorms,
provides an example for other schools, she
said.
With 1 million e-mail messages and 10
million World Wide Web hits being
executed from campus computers
every day, Stanford also leads uni
versities in the amount and
growth of computer use.
According to Ronald Burback,
manager of the Distributed Com
puting Environment, computer
use in the classrooms has doubled
in the last year.
Still Senti admitted that she has
little knowledge about the conse
quences of technology at the Uni
versity. "We try to teach people how
to use technology, but as far as eval
uating the effects ... we haven't."
In an attempt to help colleges
evaluate the use of technology so
they can take full advantage of it,
McClure and his associates are
publishing a manual in the begin
ning of March titled, "Assessing
the Academic Networked Environ
ment: Strategies and Options."
McClure said this report is the first

of its kind.
The manual is expected to
include a summary of networking
issues for colleges such as its effect
on teaching, learning, research
and administration. Other topics
include how the college's social and
cultural environment may have
been changed and whether net
working has contributed to stu
dents' professional development.
Senti agreed that an evaluation
of the use of technology at univer
sities needs to come from academic
research and not from the technol
ogy providers.
"Technologists can then use the
results from research to either
change the way technology is being
used or the type of technology they
are providing" for universities,
Senti said.
Continuing progress into the
Information Age, Burback empha
sized that people will never be
replaced. "Although networks are
less personal, it will force us to be
more personal," he said. "The
importance of one-on-one contact
will be even more."
