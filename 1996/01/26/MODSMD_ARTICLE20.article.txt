# No mercy for spiking Weenies
## Men's volleyball hopes to continue dominating Cal 
### Ed Guzman Contributing writer 
The fourth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team completes
its preparation for league play
with a trip into Weenie country
for a 7:30 p.m. match against
California tonight.
Coming off a strong fifth
place finish at the UC-Santa
Barbara Collegiate Tournament,
the Cardinal looks to uphold his
tory this evening in the latest
meeting between the two fabled
rivals. Stanford has not lost to
Cal in 20 years, and Cardinal
head coach Ruben Nieves hopes
his team can overcome Cal's
determination to end the streak.
"They would like nothing
more than to beat us," Nieves
said. "That's why [playing Cal]
is helpful for us, because it's
someone that wants to beat us
bad."
Stanford spikers will face an
unusual team in Cal. The Bears
are a self-funded club that nor
mally competes a notch below
the varsity level, although they
will occasionally play varsity
teams like Stanford. "There is a
definite difference in varsity and
club teams," Nieves said. "But
they have beaten varsity teams."
The Bears have also emerged
as the best club team in the
nation. "1 don't know the exact
numbers, but they've won some
thing like five club national
championships in six years,"
Nieves said.

Junior Matt Fuerbringer swings at a high set
against BYU last spring.
However, those teams suc
ceeded under the tutelage of for
mer head coach Dave Nichols.
This year, first-year head coach

Ken Rogers assumes the chal
lenge of maintaining Cal's
prominent volleyball tradition.
Led hy setter Chris Hopkins
and outside hitter John Lee, Cal
also participated in the UCSB
Collegiate last weekend and fin
ished 11th. The Bears were one
of only two club teams that
placed in the ton half of the 24-

team tournament. Along the
way, they upset lOth-ranked
BYU, demonstrating their ability
to beat a formidable varsity
squad.
"[The victory over the
Cougars] was an indication that
they're dangerous," Nieves said.
Stanford will counter with its
vaunted three-blocker alignment

that netted the Cardinal five
matches at UCSB last weekend.
The Cardinal will field its
strongest lineup, featuring junior
middle-blocker Brian Moore and
junior setter Stewart Chong.
Ail-American junior Matt
Fuerbringer, who appeared in
only two matches last weekend,
will continue to play a limited

role while he recovers from
shoulder surgery. "We'll play
him at least one game, and if we
feel we're in control of the
match, we'll sit him down,"
Nieves said. "We just want him
to get into a rhythm."
Sophomore setter Tyler Neal,
who suffers from tendonitis in
his knees, will also play sparingly

as a back-up for Chong.
Despite the apparent disad
vantage the Weenies face, Nieves
knows his team must pass a
stern test in the Cardinal's last
non-league match. "Once the
match starts, fans will forget
[Cal's club status], and it'll just
be Stanford against Cal," the
coach said.
