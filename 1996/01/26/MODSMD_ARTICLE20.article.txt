# No mercy for spiking Weenies
## Men's volleyball hopes to continue dominating Cal 
### Ed Guzman Contributing writer 
The fourth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team completes
its preparation for league play
with a trip into Weenie country
for a 7:30 p.m. match against
California tonight.
Coming off a strong fifth
place finish at the UC-Santa
Barbara Collegiate Tournament,
the Cardinal looks to uphold his
tory this evening in the latest
meeting between the two fabled
rivals. Stanford has not lost to
Cal in 20 years, and Cardinal
head coach Ruben Nieves hopes
his team can overcome Cal's
determination to end the streak.
"They would like nothing
more than to beat us," Nieves
said. "That's why [playing Cal]
is helpful for us, because it's
someone that wants to beat us
bad."
Stanford spikers will face an
unusual team in Cal. The Bears
are a self-funded club that nor
mally competes a notch below
the varsity level, although they
will occasionally play varsity
teams like Stanford. "There is a
definite difference in varsity and
club teams," Nieves said. "But
they have beaten varsity teams."
The Bears have also emerged
as the best club team in the
nation. "1 don't know the exact
numbers, but they've won some
thing like five club national
championships in six years,"
Nieves said.
