# Women's tennis hosts Huskies
## Cardinal to face improved UW without Shasby 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's tennis team is
set to kick off Pacific 10 Conference play
against Washington today in its first dual
match of 1996. The Cardinal, which com
peted in several tournaments since early
October and won a dual match against
Hawaii in November, will get its season
into full swing with today's contest.
Unlike Stanford's first dual match
against the Rainbows, which consisted of
six singles matches and three pro-set dou
bles matches, the Cardinal's showdown
with the Huskies will follow the typical
dual-match format for women's tennis.
The top six singles players as well as the
top three doubles teams from each school
need only capture two of three sets.
The Cardinal is coming off of a success
ful weekend at the Pac-10 Indoor Champi
onships in Seattle, where it managed to get

an early glimpse at Washington's lineup.
Sophomore Julie Scott, who won the flight
three singles competition in Seattle, was
the only Cardinal player who faced an
opponent from Washington last weekend.
Scott defeated Lindy Irving 7-5. 6-0 in a
first-round match.
Senior Kim Shasby was scheduled to
face Kori Sosnowy of Washington. Howev
er, a pulled leg muscle forced Shasby to for
feit. Shasby will not compete today, but she
expects to return to action by next week
end.
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan
acknowledged that Shasby's absence will
create a few changes in his usual lineup.
"[Shasby] is not playing," he said, "and
except for Beth Berris' wrist, everyone else
is healthy." Nonetheless, Brennan's lineup
will remain tentative until today's 1:30
p.m. start.
While Brennan may be unsure
about the group he will field, he is
certain that Washington will pro
vide a formidable challenge.
"They're better and better every
year," he said. "Their No. 1 player
lost in three sets to [defending
NCAA champion Keril Phebus last
weekend, and they are pretty solid
on down."
Phebus captured the
flight-one singles title at the Pac-10
Indoor Championships last week
end. She also defeated Stanford
sophomore Ania Bleszynski in a
grueling 6-4, 7-5, 6-4 battle.
Over the years, the Huskies have
not finished well in the Pac-10.
However, Brennan noted that
Washington is much improved. He
pointed out that at one juncture, he
would have used a match against
Washington to rest some of his top
players and allow some of his other
athletes to play. Today, however, he
will not rest any of his healthy play
ers.
"I don't plan to rest anybody," he
said. "1 hope the weather's great. It
should lx? fun."
