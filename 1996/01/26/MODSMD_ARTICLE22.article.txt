On a night when nothing seemed to be working
for the Stanford women's basketball team, junior
point guard Jamila Wideman took matters into her
own hands.
Mired in a 26-26 deadlock after one half of play —
a half which saw Stanford's leading scorer Kate
Starbird held to 0-of-4 shooting — Wideman explod
ed for 18 second-half points last night to lead the
sixth-ranked Cardinal to a 67-54 victory over Wash
ington at Maples Pavilion.
With the win, Stanford improved its Pacific 10
Conference record to a perfect 7-0 (14-2 overall),
two-and-a-half games ahead of its nearest competi
tors, while extending its conference home winning
streak to 41. The Huskies (10-7 overall), who
entered the game with sole possession of second
place, dropped into a four-way tie for the No. 2 slot
at 4-2.
"It wasn't very pretty," said Stanford head coach
Amy Tucker. "It was a very frustrating first half for
our team offensively. I'm sure it was very frustrat
ing for our fans to watch as well.
"In the second half, we did a much better job of
running some clear plays. If they're really gonna
play people as tightly as they do, we'll just let people
go one-on-one to the hole. I wouldn't say it was a
great team effort in terms of our offense, but we did
the right things that we needed to do to win."
The Cardinal didn't seem to do anything right in
the first half. Washington point guard Laure Savas
ta and lightning-quick freshman Jamie Redd gave
the Stanford defense fits on the perimeter. And with
the the offense making sloppy turnovers and with no
post game to speak of, Stanford was lucky to stay as
close as it did.
"With the kind of defense they play, they gamble
on teams not being able to penetrate and take care of
the ball, and we kind of played right into their hands
in the first half," Wideman said.
Starbird, meanwhile, couldn't seem to shake the
stifling coverage of Husky guard Shannon Kelly.

Starbird entered the contest averaging 21.1 points
per game but didn't put her first points on the board
until 22 minutes and 26 seconds of play had elapsed.
"It is kind of frustrating to always have somebody
on you that picks you up at about halfcourt," Star
bird said. "But that gives other people an opportuni
ty, and I think [Wideman] did a really good job of
stepping it up in the second half and taking control
of the game."

Junior Jamila Wideman led the Cardinal to its 16th
straight Pac-10 win and eighth-straight overall with
18 second-half points.
"Taking control" might be an
understatement. Time after time,
Wideman took Savasta to the bas
ket with quick, darting drives
while the rest of the Stanford
offense cleared out. Wideman fin
ished 5-of-6 from the field in the
second half while burying eight of
12 free throws. She also added
eight assists on the night.
"On this team, I think [scor
ing] has to be more of a responsi
bility for me." Wideman said.
"Especially because teams can
key on Kate, and you can't afford
to have your whole offense fall
apart if they're going to key on
one person.
"But having the kind of post
game that we do, people have to
pay attention to them, [and] peo
ple have to pay attention to Kate,
which I think gives me a little bit
of a head start in terms of making
my own offense."
"We did a much better job in
the second half in terms of keep
ing them off the boards, giving
them one shot," Tucker said.
"[But] obviously, the key to the
game was Jamila's ability to take
people to the hole one-on-one."
Starbird finished the game 3-
of-11 from the floor for 10
points, her lowest point total
since a dismal 4-of-20 shooting
performance in a loss to Texas
Tech on Dec. 28. Sophomore
Vanessa Nygaard added 11
points and 13 rebounds, while
post players Olympia Scott and
Naomi Mulitauaopele pitched in
10 apiece.
Overall, however, it was clear
that the Cardinal was not pleased
with its performance.
"1 think as a whole, we were
lucky to win this game," Wide
man said. "To play like this
against any other team in the
Pac-10, especially on their court,
it might have been a very differ
ent story."
Stanford also has to be con
cerned about Starbird. After her
recent scoring tear — she scored a

school-record 44 points two weeks
ago against USC — it's become
obvious that teams are going to
start paying closer attention to
the star forward.
"I think Kate's gonna attract
some attention, just the way she's
been playing, the way she's been
scoring," Tucker said. "But I
think the key for us will Ih> get
ting the ball inside. We have to do
a better job of getting the ball to

our post players than we did
tonight."
The Cardinal will have a
chance to redeem itself tomor
row at 7 p.m. when it faces off
against Washington State. The
Cougars, picked to finish seventh
in the conference in the presea
son, have turned heads with
some big wins this season,
including an upset of No. 15 Ore
gon State two weekends ago.
