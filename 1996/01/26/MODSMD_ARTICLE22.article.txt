On a night when nothing seemed to be working
for the Stanford women's basketball team, junior
point guard Jamila Wideman took matters into her
own hands.
Mired in a 26-26 deadlock after one half of play —
a half which saw Stanford's leading scorer Kate
Starbird held to 0-of-4 shooting — Wideman explod
ed for 18 second-half points last night to lead the
sixth-ranked Cardinal to a 67-54 victory over Wash
ington at Maples Pavilion.
With the win, Stanford improved its Pacific 10
Conference record to a perfect 7-0 (14-2 overall),
two-and-a-half games ahead of its nearest competi
tors, while extending its conference home winning
streak to 41. The Huskies (10-7 overall), who
entered the game with sole possession of second
place, dropped into a four-way tie for the No. 2 slot
at 4-2.
"It wasn't very pretty," said Stanford head coach
Amy Tucker. "It was a very frustrating first half for
our team offensively. I'm sure it was very frustrat
ing for our fans to watch as well.
"In the second half, we did a much better job of
running some clear plays. If they're really gonna
play people as tightly as they do, we'll just let people
go one-on-one to the hole. I wouldn't say it was a
great team effort in terms of our offense, but we did
the right things that we needed to do to win."
The Cardinal didn't seem to do anything right in
the first half. Washington point guard Laure Savas
ta and lightning-quick freshman Jamie Redd gave
the Stanford defense fits on the perimeter. And with
the the offense making sloppy turnovers and with no
post game to speak of, Stanford was lucky to stay as
close as it did.
"With the kind of defense they play, they gamble
on teams not being able to penetrate and take care of
the ball, and we kind of played right into their hands
in the first half," Wideman said.
Starbird, meanwhile, couldn't seem to shake the
stifling coverage of Husky guard Shannon Kelly.

Starbird entered the contest averaging 21.1 points
per game but didn't put her first points on the board
until 22 minutes and 26 seconds of play had elapsed.
"It is kind of frustrating to always have somebody
on you that picks you up at about halfcourt," Star
bird said. "But that gives other people an opportuni
ty, and I think [Wideman] did a really good job of
stepping it up in the second half and taking control
of the game."
