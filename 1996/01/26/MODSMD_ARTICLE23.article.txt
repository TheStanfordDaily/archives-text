# No. 2 baseball opens season in paradise
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
While wintry temperatures are keeping Stan
ford students and staff bundled up on campus,
the Cardinal baseball team will escape the frigid
Bay Area for the sunny shores of Waikiki for a
three-game weekend series against the Hawaii
Rainbows.
Coach Mark Marquess' squad isn't in for a
vacation, however, as the No. 2 Cardinal looks to
open its year on a winning note. While Stanford
will start its season today, the Rainbows have
already begun their 1996 campaign and current
ly boast a 2-1 record.
Marquess' veterans will primarily concern
themselves with avoiding the early-season slump
the Cardinal endured last year. Stanford's schedule
allows little time for fine-tuning, as the Cardinal
hosts Cal State-Fullerton. the defending national
champion, next week at Sunken Diamond.
"We need to get out to a fast start this sea
son," said senior catcher A.J. Hinch. "The pitch
ing staff is very well prepared. They are much
further along — as far as readiness — than our
hitting."
