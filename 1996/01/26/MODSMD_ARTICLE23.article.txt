# No. 2 baseball opens season in paradise

### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
While wintry temperatures are keeping Stan
ford students and staff bundled up on campus,
the Cardinal baseball team will escape the frigid
Bay Area for the sunny shores of Waikiki for a
three-game weekend series against the Hawaii
Rainbows.
Coach Mark Marquess' squad isn't in for a
vacation, however, as the No. 2 Cardinal looks to
open its year on a winning note. While Stanford
will start its season today, the Rainbows have
already begun their 1996 campaign and current
ly boast a 2-1 record.
Marquess' veterans will primarily concern
themselves with avoiding the early-season slump
the Cardinal endured last year. Stanford's schedule
allows little time for fine-tuning, as the Cardinal
hosts Cal State-Fullerton. the defending national
champion, next week at Sunken Diamond.
"We need to get out to a fast start this sea
son," said senior catcher A.J. Hinch. "The pitch
ing staff is very well prepared. They are much
further along — as far as readiness — than our
hitting."

Sophomore starting pitcher
Kyle Peterson, whose 14-1 mark
last year tied the Stanford record
for victories in a season, said even
the pitchers may be shaking off
some rust in these opening con
tests. "It'll take awhile for me to
get to midseason form, but it's
very important to start out on the
right foot," he said. "If we get
things going our way, I think it
will give us a lot of confidence
going into the Fullerton series."
After his record-breaking
efforts last year, Peterson, the
probable starter for today's meet
ing, spent the off-season develop
ing an effective curveball to add to
his overpowering fastball and
changeup pitch. "I wanted to add

a quality third pitch, so I put
extra emphasis on the curve,
especially this fall," he said. "The
biggest thing for me this weekend
is to be able to throw my fastball
and changeup for strikes. If I'm
able to throw the curve for strikes
also, that's an added bonus."
With the starters not yet in
midseason form, the Cardinal
bullpen, full of veteran hurlers, is
prepared for action in Hawaii.
"These first couple of week
ends, when the starting pitchers
aren't going to go the whole way,
we're going to be ready," said
reliever Brendan Sullivan.
"We've got 10 pitchers making
the trip and every single one of
them is very confident."
Hinch, who attained career
highs in batting average (.366),
home runs (nine) and runs-batted
in (58) in 1995, expects a tough
series with the Rainbows.

"We need to bear down and
concentrate," Hinch said. "We
want to go out and play baseball
and let our abilities take over. It's
a big park with a lot of area.
There may be higher scoring
games, but we want both the
offense and the defense to play
consistently."
The Rainbows finished 1995
with a 30-24 record, but managed
only a 12-17 record in Western
Athletic Conference play, good for
sixth place. Hawaii is led by staff
ace Mark Johnson, a junior right
hander who competed for the
U.S. National Team last summer.
"They'll hit the ball, run the
bases and pitch well," Sullivan
said. "They've got a week jump on
us and they've got a tough crowd
that really supports them. It's
going to be a tough series, but we
know that if we play our game, it
will take care of itself."
