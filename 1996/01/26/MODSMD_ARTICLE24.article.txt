# Men's tennis primed for Las Vegas opener

### Brian Auld 
Entering tomorrow's match against UNLV in
Las Vegas, the top-ranked Stanford men's tennis
team rides a 29-match winning streak dating back to
Nov. 25, 1994. Yet, one wouldn't know that from
talking to head coach Dick Gould or any of his play

young season.
"UNLV isn't the best team or the worst team we
will face this year," Gould said. "This is a good
match to get things going."

ranked collegiate singles player. Pettersson encoun
tered Stanford freshman Ryan Wolters in the finals
of the All-American Championships last October
and lost 6-4, 6-2.
"Any player that can advance to the finals of a
national tournament like that can definitely play,"
Gould said.
The match should provide a good test for Salzen
stein, who only recently recovered from injury and
has seen little match play in the past few months.
"I'm back physically," Salzenstein said. "Howev-
