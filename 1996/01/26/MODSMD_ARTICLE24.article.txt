# Men's tennis primed for Las Vegas opener
## 
### Brian Auld 
Entering tomorrow's match against UNLV in
Las Vegas, the top-ranked Stanford men's tennis
team rides a 29-match winning streak dating back to
Nov. 25, 1994. Yet, one wouldn't know that from
talking to head coach Dick Gould or any of his play
ers.
"I don't really think about the rankings or the
streaks," Gould said. "We're not always going to be
No. 1, and we're going to get beat sometimes. Our
focus at this time of the year is to make our game
better for the NCAA Championships."
Senior captain Jeff Salzenstein echoed his
coach's sentiments. "Basically, the team is not con
cerned about that kind of stuff (rankings), or even
who we play," he said. "We need to take care of our
selves and do what we need to do to keep improv
ing."
That is exactly what the Cardinal will try to
accomplish when it battles the Running Rebels Sat
urday at noon. Stanford has run off to a 2-0 start so
far this year, and the 36th-ranked Rebels will come
as Stanford's first substantial opposition of the
young season.
"UNLV isn't the best team or the worst team we
will face this year," Gould said. "This is a good
match to get things going."
Salzenstein will play No. 1 singles for the Cardi
nal and should face Roger Pettersson, the 17th
ranked collegiate singles player. Pettersson encoun
tered Stanford freshman Ryan Wolters in the finals
of the All-American Championships last October
and lost 6-4, 6-2.
"Any player that can advance to the finals of a
national tournament like that can definitely play,"
Gould said.
The match should provide a good test for Salzen
stein, who only recently recovered from injury and
has seen little match play in the past few months.
"I'm back physically," Salzenstein said. "Howev-

match could help me get to that
point."
"Jeff is not all the way back to
where he will be, but he is playing
very well," Gould said. "He's not
far."
Wolters will assume the No. 2
singles spot for the Cardinal.
Tomorrow's contest will be Wolters'
first match since winning the Mil
waukee Tennis Classic on Jan. 13.
Wolters, the No. 1 player in the
country right now, brings to the
court a team-best 23-1 record.
Yet, in spite of the fact that
Wolters hiLs already competed in 24
collegiate matches, Saturday will give
Gould hLs first opportunity to coach
Wolters during a match. Assistant
Coach John Whitlinger has guided
Wolters in hLs previous tournament
runs. "These early matches allow me
to establish good coach-player rela
tionships," Gould said. "I am certain
ly kxjking forward t<> working with
Ryan for the first time."
Wolters also looks forward to the
chance to play under Gould. "I've
worked well with IWhitlinger] so

far," he said "He's a great coach.
Hut I'm definitely interested to see
how Coach Could will affect me."
The UNLV match will also be
Wolters' first team competition
since his arrival at Stanford.
Wolters compiled his 23-1 mark in
tournament appearances. "Those
individual tournaments are great,
but I'm really excited about playing
in a team match — really contribut
ing to Stanford tennis," Wolters
said.
Sophomore Paul Goldstein will
play No. 3 singles tomorrow. Gold
stein boasts an impressive 10-1
record thus far, including a win at
the Rolex Northern California Invi
tational. Goldstein could not partic
ipate in the Milwaukee Classic due
to the East Coast blizzard and is
anxious to return to match play.
Senior Jim Thomas, the Cardi
nal's No. \ singles player, has also
gotten off to a g<x>d start, amassing
a 11 -3 mark. Two of his three losses
have come at the hands of Wolters
in tournament play, the most recent
during the quarterfinals of the Mil
waukee Classic.
In the No. 5 and No. 6 slots,
junior Grant Elliot and senior Ricky
Becker will try to improve on their
<Hand 11-3 records, respectively.

Due to illness, Elliot did not com
pete in the Milwaukee tournament.
Becker lost to finalist Gus Fernan
des of in the quarterfinals of
the Milwaukee event.
In the doubles segment of tomor
row's confrontation, Salzenstein
and Goldstein will play together as
the No. 1 doubles team while
Wolters and Elliot will team up in
the No. 2 spot. The No. 3 doubles
team will consist of Thomas and
Becker.
"Above all, I'm interested in our
doubles," Gould said. "Now that
Jeff is back, I'm reallv anxious to see
how our doubles teams work
together."
Gould is very excited about his
team and expects that Stanford will
continue to perform to its abilities
on Saturday. "I have a lot of respect
for these guys and for their compet
itiveness," he said. "These guys are
always ready to play. It's a tradition
that has carried over from last year,
and I exjxH.'t that to continue. And
as of today, everyone on this team is
in great physical and mental
health."
"I'm excited to start this year,
and I'm excited about this team,"
Salzenstein said. "It is going to be 1
fun to watch."
