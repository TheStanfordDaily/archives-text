History. What would the world have
been like without it? A lot sadder,
that's what. Hut luckily for us, some
one wrote down all the important things that
ever happened, so now we are knowledgeable
and wise.
The process of learning about human his
tory begins early in life â€” more specifically,
when we're old enough to understand car
toon.-. These children's programs, especially
those with plots that allow for time travel,
have succeeded in pithily encapsulating
everything we ever needed to know about his
tory Through cartoons, we've learned to dis
tinguish between the five distinct periods in
world history. Let's review.
The Caveman Period The earliest peri
od of history was. of course, the Caveman
Period, known to the layperson as When
There Were Cavemen. Comic strips often
romanticize the Caveman Period of history.
"8.C.," for example, portrays cavemen as sen
sitive. peg-legged contemplatives who sat
under trees and wrote poetry to commemo
rate national holidays. All lies.
"The Far Side also had a lot of cavemen,
and boy. were they funny. I used to miss "The
Far Side," until I discovered "Mutts."
"Cathy" is also humorous It is funny how she
goes on diets and buys shoes.
The Kgyptian Period file second period
of histor\ was the Kgyptian Period. Some
people believe the pyramids were built by
aliens, and they are right. The Kgyptians
were important because they mummified
everything they could get their grubby little
paws on. I've seen bug mummies, monkey
mummies, alligator mummies and kitty
mummies. Kitty mummies are the cutest
the legs are ;ill wrapped up so the kitties are
just little lumps with ears. Awwwww.
The Medieval Period. The next chapter

in the book of world history was entitled the
Medieval Period. During this period, knights,
dragons, wizards, half-elves and ogres jousted
with ribald abandon. Usually, the winner was
determined by the number of skill and
strength points versus the roll of the eight
sided dice.
Speaking of eight-sided dice, in my home
town, there's this store called Gauntlet where
gamers sell Dungeons and Dragons parapher
nalia to, well, themselves. A friend of mine
claims to have witnessed the Gauntlet gang in
a park, wearing long cloaks and dueling with
PVC pipe. The prize, he says, was a bucket of
Kentucky Fried Chicken watching from the
wings (ouch) like a lady of high birth who's
just tied her colors on her chosen gallant.
"It is for thee I do battle, my lady!" cries
the pudgy combatant, gripping his plastic
weapon with pale, sweaty hands. Blushing,
the bucket of chicken curtsies deeply and
hopes beyond hope that her brave knight tri
umphs.
The Cowboy Period History entered
modern times with the Cowboy Period. You
may be thinking. "Hey, weren't there 500
years between the Medieval Period and the
Cowboy Period? Yes, there were. But nothing
important happened then, except for Shake
speare and the pilgrims, so that time doesn't
matter.
The Cowboy Period was a rollicking time
with lots of gunfights, outlaws, and whores in
purty dresses. The best thing about this era
was the Bar Fight First, the bad guy (wear
ing black) enters the saloon, making the
piano player (wearing a derby) stop playing
the piano. All talking and merrymaking stops
and the poker players hide under the table.
You'll he sorry, poker players.
Then, for some reason, the fighting begins.
Gunshots! Fisticuffs! Folks fallin' off balconies

and crashing onto tahlfs. crushing tin* poker
players like peanut shells! Some cowboy guy
gets slid along the bar until he crashes into a
barrel of whiskey. Then the mayhem ends, and
the participants ride away to fight another
day.
The Future Period We are about to
enter the Future Period of history. Some his
torians claim we are already in this period,
what with computers and all. but most agree
that this era will begin in The Year 2000. The
Year 2000 will never be referred to as just
"2000," but always as "The Year 2000. On
our papers, we will write "January 2fi, The
Year 2000." Just so you know.
We do not know what the Future Period
will bring. There are two possibilities. The
first is that the Future Period will he a happy
time, with everyone wearing white clothes
and driving silver egg-shaped cars. In this
Utopia, all our needs will be cared for by
robots, we will communicate with friendly
aliens, and we will all wear jet packs. Wheeee!
The second possibility is not so happy. Per
haps the world of the Future Period will be a
post-apocalyptic wasteland, where robots
gone had hunt us down and shoot us with
lasers. Everything will be dusty, and we will
abandon our sophisticated system of currency
in favor of a primitive bartering system in
which we trade garbage for crackers and gas
kets.
We'll know in four years what tin 1 future
holds. Until then. 1 find it hard to sleep at
night. But I comfort nivself with the knowl
edge that I am familiar with history as it rolls
ever onward like a giant robot with blinky
lights for eves.
