Under a new project, Stanford
students will have the chance to fa
cilitate communication about race
and ethnicity among local high
school students.
Tomorrow, Stanford will host a
training program for the California
Students Talking About Race, or
STAR, Project. About 25 Stanford
students are expected to attend the
seminar, said Bay Area STAR Pro
gram Coordinator Maria Martinez.
The facilitator seminar "trains
college students as peer mentors to
help middle and high school stu
dents confront their prejudices
about race and diversity," Martinez
said.
Students interested in becoming
facilitators learned about the pro
gram from an orientation session
conducted on campus in early De
cember. Similar training programs
tire being offered at San Jose State,
San Francisco State, University of
San Francisco, Cal State-Hayward
and Humboldt State.
"We really need help from col
lege students," said Martinez.
"(Younger) students look at college
students close to their age and see
them as role models."
After participating in the one

are committed to facilitat ing discus

Martinez said many facilitators

"It's awesome. It was very hard
and very discouraging at first," said
San Francisco State student Kevin
Mickey, a veteran facilitator. "But

they talk and you c;ui really see the
change."
After completing his term as fa
cilitator thus fall, Hickey became a
local program coordinator intern.
His duties include facilitator re
cruitment.
Sometimes facilitators begin the
discussion of the scheduled topic
but soon find that students will tai
lor the program to their own needs.
One student brought in a disturb
ing letter which addressed Ku Klux
Klan activities, said Axel Vogt, a
San Francisco State student and
program coordinator.
"She read the letter, and the
whole class was really listening to
her — they were fidgeting before —
and they were totally captivated,"
Vogt said.
The STAR Program is funded by
the national organization, People
for the American Way. This nation
al fund was created 15 years ago by
a group including Norman Lear, a
Hollywood producer. Concern
about growing racial intolerance
sparked the founding of this organi
