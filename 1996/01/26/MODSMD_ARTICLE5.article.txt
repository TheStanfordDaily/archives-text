Hoping to attract new
funds to maintain unique
research equipment, the
Faculty Senate approved
a new policy governing the
use of Stanford's research
facilities by outside enti
ties in its meeting yester
day.
The new policy reverses
the previous procedure of

1979 which discouraged t he use of Stan ford fa
cilities by outsideent ities such as other univer
sities, research labs and private corporations.
It allows Stanford faculty to sign research par
ticipation agreements â€” which are essentially
rental agreements wit h outside groups.
"While federal research support has in
creased, the nature of it has changed," said
Applied Physics Prof. Robert Byer, chair of
the senate's Committee on Research. "It is
much harder for faculty to maintain their
unique and high-quality equipment. Re
search participation agreements will allow
the faculty to continue to maintain their ...
equipment."
The policy sets out several guidelines for
research participation agreements, including
that resources used be unique, that the work
relate to Stanford's academic mission, that a
faculty member have oversight and that the
work not interfere with University teaching
and research, Byer said.
Under the guidelines, the research activi

ties must also follow the terms of the Secrecy
in Research Policy, and Stanford faculty and
students must have first priority on the
equipment. Finally, the use cannot violate
the terms imposed by the donor of the facility,
Byer said.
Intellectual property rights under such
agreements will be governed by public patent
law. If Stanford personnel invent something,
the title belongs to the University; if the in
vention is a result of collaboration between
University personnel and outside entities,
then the ownership is shared; and if the out
side entity is solely responsible, then the title
belongs to that group, Byer added.
English Prof. John Bender questioned
whether the oversight required of Stanford
faculty by the policy would distract them
from teaching and research.
But Byer said faculty members willingly
enter into such agreements to maintain their
equipment and that the burden would not be
heavy.
Also at yesterday's meeting, John Shoven,
dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, said he will work with the relevant de
partment to decide who fills openings in the
new Comparative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity major.
"There are no parties which have veto
power on these types of appointments,"
Shoven said.
Asian-American student groups protested
a faculty billet offer to a doctoral candidate in
sociology last week, claiming that she lacked
experience in Asian-American Studies. The
