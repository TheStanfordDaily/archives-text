# Race still the matter
## West explains value of affirmative action 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
It was with powerful rhetoric and
preacher-like cadences that Harvard
African American Studies Prof. Cornel
West told a cheering audience that it. is im
perative to address America's history of
white supremacy before continuing the
current affirmative action debate.
Hailed by Assoc. English Prof. Horace
Porter, chair of Stanford's African and
Afro-American Studies Program, as "one
of the leading public intellectuals of our
time," West discoursed for more than an
hour on the racial issues currently facing
this country.
"We did not have to wait for the O.J. ver
dict to know how irrational things can get
when talking about race," he said, citing
America's continuing unwillingness to
deal with its history of racial oppression.
West's lecture — titled, like his best

selling book, "Race Matters" — was pre
sented by the President's Committee on
Culture and Cultures as part of a series of
symposia dealing with racial and ethnic is
sues. In his talk, West discussed his view of
affirmative action as a small effort toward
redressing the injustices historically in
flicted on members of minority groups.
The country's attitudes on race, West
said, have historically been "absurd."
"The indigenous people — the black
people, the red people — up against white
supremacy don't need to read Sartre or see
a play by Samuel Beckett to know the ab
surd," he said.
This irrational relationship between the
races, West said, has existed since the
country's founding. "It haunted America
then, and it still haunts America 220 years
later."
Nonetheless, "we'd rather live a life of
denial because we're American,"
he said. Americans like to believe
that any problem can be over
come if we work together to
address it. Such a message, West
said, was heard from President
Clinton in his State of the Union
address Tuesday night and is
heard in many similar speeches
from politicians.
"Black people are cast as prob

lem people, not people with prob
lems," West said. "The question
is, in all seriousness, how does it
feel to be 'a problem?' " All people
have problems, he said, but "to be
cast as a problem people is an
added burden."
To help offset — at least to
some degree — the burdens
caused by a history of white
supremacy, he advocated the use
of race as a consideration in
admission to institutions such as
Stanford which produce the
nation's elites.
West argued that affirmative

action programs do not result in
the admission of unqualified can
didates. Many more applicants
than spots available meet the min
imum requirements of even the
most highly selective universities,
and it is thus necessary to employ
other criteria to select those who
will be admitted, he said. Prefer
ence for athletes and legacies, and
considerations of geographic
diversity are considered accept
able, but "bring in racial diversity
and all hell breaks loose," he said.
Unaddressed racial divisions
are threatening the underpin
nings of our system of gover
nance, West said, and "those who
are serious about the democratic
tradition cannot afford to avoid or
evade the legacy of white
supremacy."
He sounded apocalyptic warn
ings in his analysis of democra
cy's future. "There is no guaran
tee that the democratic tradition
can make it into the 21st century
in a healthy place." However, if it
does fail, West concluded in his
remarks, "I'll be there with you,
'cause I'm going down fighting."
The packed audience, which
awarded West with a standing
ovation, engaged him in a
thoughtful question-and-answer
period after the close of his pre
pared remarks.
To one student, who inquired
about specific policies that might
bring blacks and whites together,
West stressed the importance of
ensuring that efforts to bring the
races together are inclusionary.
"It's not about pointing fingers at
the white brothers and saying 'we
don't give a damn about you,' " he
said. "That's what drives them
into Rush Limbaugh's camp."
