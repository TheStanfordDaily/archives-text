# Abortion put under scrutiny
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Doctors and pro-life advocates
will gather today and tomorrow at
Stanford for a public forum on abor
tion and its long-term medical, so
cial, legal and psychological effects
on women — issues that remain
"largely unexamined," according to
Stanford Students for Life, the or
ganization hosting the forum.
Sponsored by the ASSU,
"Women and Abortion: Beyond the
Procedure" will focus on topics
such as a recent study showing pos
sible links between abortion and
breast cancer, legal issues related to
informed consent and the relatively
unexplored psychological ailment
known as post-abortive syndrome.
"Legal abortion has become a
norm in our society," said Bridget
Quigg, president of Stanford Stu
dents for Life. "Our generation has
grown up with the law. . . .Most are
uneducated about it, and now we're
simply comfortable with it.
"Our hope is that people at Stan
ford and in the local community
who arc interested in women's
health will come to gain greater
insight on the related issues so
that they can be better informed as
voters," said Quigg.
While all speakers participat
ing in the forum are against
abortion, Quigg — who original
ly intended to attract leaders
from both sides of the debate —
said she contacted leaders from
various pro-choice organiza
tions, such as the National Orga
nization for Women (NOW),
Planned Parenthood of San Jose
and the Stanford Pro-Choice
Alliance.
Because plans with pro-choice
leaders either never materialized
or fell through, Quigg said she
decided to format the discussion as
a forum in which audience mem
bers can challenge the speakers.
Describing one such setback,
Quigg said a clinical administra
tor at San Jose's Planned Parent
hood told her that "the debate
format is generally unproductive
in terms of resolving conflict and
offers little valuable insight."
Leaders of other student
organizations say they are trou
bled by the one-sided panel and
fear that the forum will inade
quately address a complex ethi
cal issue.
"The speakers will be doctors
with opirVi<Ws' who
have conducted quick literature
searches and read propaganda,"
said Nathan Watson, leader of
Stanford Medical Students for
Choice. "Anyone who goes will be
getting a one-sided sales

pitch. ... I hope that not too
many women are unduly influ
enced by this forum."
Skeptical about the basis of
alleged health risks related to
abortion, Watson cited 1993
statistics from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention,
showing that the death rate of
women who give birth is 11 times
higher than that of women who
have abortions. From the same
study, he added that the risk of
complications with abortion is
less than 1 percent.
Courtney Clark — president of
the recently established campus
NOW chapter and former presi
dent of the Stanford Pro-Choice
Alliance — said she was enthusi
astic about the forum even
though she doesn't agree with the
opinions that will likely be dis
cussed there.
"Any discussion is better than
no discussion, even if it's from a
skewed perspective," she said.
"Even though the views that will
be expressed aren't mine, I'm
excited that there is actually going
to be a forum on abortion. There
are so few of them on this campus.
I hope people who go will become
angered and get more involved
with the women's community."
Emphasizing that the ASSU's
funding is not an indication of
support of the (brum's agenda,
ASSU Deputy Senate Chair Bill
Shert"sftid that "the University
has an 6fcligB£ron to sure
that"all* opinions are fairly aired
so that students know what's out
there."
The forum will be held in
Tresidder Union's Oak West
room from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. today
