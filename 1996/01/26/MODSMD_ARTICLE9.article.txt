## Hearings begin Whitewater Committee hears its first testimony 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Aware of Bill Clinton's friendship
with the owner of a failing Arkansas savings and loan, a state
regulator warned one of Clinton's aides the federal govern
ment was about to crack down, the regulator testified yester
day.
Confronted with a handwritten note she sent to the gover
nor's office, Beverly Bassett Schaffer said she knew S&L
owner James McDougal had been a friend of the governor and
1 believe . . . abused his relationship with Hill Clinton."
Schaffer, the former Arkansas securities commissioner,
told the Senate Whitewater Committee that she was con
cerned McDougal might try to approach the governor's office
for help. She said she sent the July 2, 1986, note to aide Sam
Bratton so that the governor's office would have nothing fur
ther to do with McDougal.
As Schaffer testified, committee Republicans released
another note written 12 days after hers, this one by Clinton
aide Betsey Wright asking about Clinton's Whitewater real
estate venture.
Wright's note to Clinton asked whether, in light of McDou
gal's "current problems," Clinton still had stock in the White
water real estate venture. "If so, I'm worried about it," Wright
wrote.
Clinton scribbled back, "No, don't have any more," with
the word "any" underlined. In fact, the Clintons didn't sell
their stock in Whitewater until late in 1992, after it had been
an issue in the presidential campaign. At the time of Wright's
note, McDougal was trying to buy out the Clintons' Whitewa
ter interest and it was unclear who had the company's stock.
White House spokesman Mark Fabiani said the president
doesn't recall Wright's note.
Republicans, meanwhile, continued their attacks on first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's veracity, comparing a state
ment she made under oath to regulators in 1994 with Schaf
fer's testimony.
Schaffer said she informed Mrs. Clinton in a 198. r ) tele
phone call that she was comfortable with the idea of issuing
stock in McDougal's savings and loan, Madison Guaranty.
Mrs. Clinton did not mention Schaffer's comment in writ
ten answers to federal regulators when questioned about the
phone call, saying she had only a vague recollection and was
not even certain she made a call to anyone at the state agen
cy-
After Schaffer's phone call with Mrs. Clinton, two regula
tors who worked for Schaffer, Charles Handley and William
Brady, raised questions about the plan — which would have
involved issuing preferred, non-voting stock in the institu
tion. The proposal was later dropped.
Issuing preferred stock had never been done previously by
an S&L in Arkansas.
A year later, in 1986, McDougal was about to be removed
by federal regulators from the S&L and Schaffer wrote her
note to Clinton aide Bratton. She testified that she didn't

know at the time that Clinton and McDougal were partners in
the Whitewater real estate venture. But she said McDougal
had bragged about his relationship with Clinton and she had
heard that he tried to exert his influence on the governor's
office.
Schaffer's note to the governor's office says, "Madison
CJuaranty is in pretty serious trouble. Because of Bill's rela
tionship w / McDougal, we probably ought to talk about it."
The note says federal regulators would be holding a meet
ing nine days later — a meeting in which McDougal was
removed from control of the S&L. Attached to Schaffer's
handwritten note was a three-page letter from federal regula
tors to Madison Guaranty's board detailing restrictions to be
placed on the institution's operations.
