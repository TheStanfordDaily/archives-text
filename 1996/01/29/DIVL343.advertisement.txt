Daily columnists: Those privileged few who can write whatever they please on this hallowed page.
It's a long and proud tradition. And now, The Stanford Daily is looking for a few (new) good columnists.
To apply, submit two sample columns (about 550 words each), samples of any previously published work and
a letter telling us about yourself and the type of writing you'd do, to our office by this Friday, February 2.
Questions? Want more information? Call Jesse or Jamie at 725-2100.
