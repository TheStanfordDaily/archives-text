That's our domain, after all. Some 23,000
miles above the earth. As a premier, global
designer of satellites for communications
and weather monitoring purposes, we
offer a great variety of projects for you
to develop. Besides designing satellites,
we also launch them. We have launch
sites in such exotic places as South
America, China, Kazakhstan and even
Florida. In fact, we presently have a
backlog of 75 satellites! Because we
have over 35 years of satellite communi
cations experience, it's safe to say we'll
be around for the long haul.
Our satellites enable people to make
instantaneous connections with
others. From wireless hand-held
telephone service and video
conferencing, to digital services
involving voice, video, and data
transmissions. In addition, we
do extensive R&D with
propulsion systems,
rechargeable nickel
hydrogen batteries and
power electronics, solar
arrays, advanced composites, attitude
control systems and all-weather testing
of antenna subsystems.
/■;
We will be on campus interviewing
for the following positions:
•Mechanical Engineers
•Electrical Engineers
•Finance
Positions are also available in Manufacturing and Industrial Engineering.
Thursday, February 1 and
Friday, February 2
Contact your Career Placement Center for more information.
We are an equal opportunity employer.
