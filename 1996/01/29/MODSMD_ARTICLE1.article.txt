# Chicano Studies hires in progress

### Sara Southern Contributing writer 
In contrast to the recent con
troversy over hiring for the Asian
American Studies component of
the Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity program, the
process for the Chicano Studies
concentration seems to be run
ning smoothly.
Two candidates for faculty po
sitions are being considered by the
English Department; they would
contribute to Chicano Studies
within CSRE if hired. Members of
the Chicano Studies Curriculum
Committee and the Chicano com
munity in general say they feel the
department has handled the hir
ing process well.
E-mail messages went out to
members of the Chicano / Latino
student group MEChA announc
ing the proposed hirings, includ
ing times and dates the candi
dates, Paula Moya and Stanford
graduate Josie Saldana, would be
available for student meetings.
"The English Department is an
exemplary model for the search
for CSRE positions," said Spanish
Prof. Yvonne Yarbro-Bejarano, a
member of the Chicano Studies
Curriculum Committee.
Chris Gonzalez Clarke, assis

tant director of El Centro Chi
cano, had similar feelings. "I
think those students who are in
terested in the subject have been
well-informed," he said. "The
Chicano graduate students in the
English Department have done a
lot of outreach and made sure the
candidates were highly accessi
ble."
One of those graduate stu
dents, Chicano Graduate Student
Association President Maria
Cotera, has been particularly ac
tive in informing the community
about the candidates. Cotera
serves on the search committee
within the English Department.
Frances Morales, director of El
Centro, said she has seen "a lot of
excitement on the part of the stu
dents about (he candidates." She
added, however, that most of the
students whom she saw at the stu
dent meetings with the candidates
were graduate students.
Yarbro-Bejarano said the
process might be proceeding more
smoothly in the English Depart
ment because there has been a
greater historic presence of ethnic
studies scholarship in the human
ities. The proposed hiring of
Grace Kao, a doctoral candidate in
sociology who was deemed by
some to be unqualified in Asian
American studies, raised a contro
versy earlier this month.
"Unfortunately, there has al
ways been less of a history and

presence in American ethnic stud
ies within the social sciences. I
think hiring ethnic studies schol
ars who are in that field is inher
ently more problematic," said
Yarbro-Bejarano. "That may have
had something to do with the com
plications over Kao and the Sociol
ogy Department."
The issue of African American
Studies seems even more quiet â€”

partly due to the fact that an
African and Afro-American Stud
ies major existed before the cre
ation of the new comparative
studies program.
"Hiring in African American
studies has been pretty stable as
far as I know," said Black Student
Union President Courtney Mey
ers. "Honestly, I haven't heard
anything about new candidates."
