## Ride 'em Cowboys Dallas beats Pittsburgh Steelers, 27-17 
### 
TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) â€” Those limo-ridin'
glamour boys from Dallas backed up their
bluster, but barely.
And they am thank one of their least glam
orous players, Larry Brown, for their third
Super Bowl victory in four years.
The Cowboys beat Pittsburgh 27-17 yester
day to extend the NFC's streak of victories in
the NFL's showcase game to an even dozen.
And while Troy, Emmitt and Michael all
had their moments, the biggest moment was
reserved for Brown, the right cornerback over
shadowed by the spotlight on left corner, a guy
named Deion Sanders.
Brown came up with two interceptions at
moments when Pittsburgh was just about to
take control of the game and was named the
Super Bowl's most valuable player.
His 44-yard return in the third quarter of
Neil O'Donnell's pass set up a 1-yard touch
down run by Emmitt Smith that put I)allas up
20-7 after Pittsburgh, which fell behind 13-0,
seemed ready to take the lead.
Then, after Pittsburgh had closed to 20-17
and had the ball with four minutes left, Brown,
just as he did to seal the NFC title game with
Green Bay, made another interception,
returning it 34 yards to set up another Smith
TD run, this one of four yards.
Only then did the Cowboys and coach Barry
Switzer celebrate a struggling Super Bowl vic
tory that capped a struggling season. And the
hugs in the end zone reflected relief more than
the "in-your-face" braggadocio with which the
Cowboys faced Super Bowl week.
Dallas controlled the first half, with help
from O'Donnell, the Pittsburgh quarterback
who was high and outside most of the time.

even on his completions.
But while they scored on their first two pos
sessions, they could convert those only into 13
points, leaving the Steelers within striking
range, even with O'Donnell struggling so
much.
Then the Steelers, as they have so often,
scored in the last two minutes, turning it into
a 13-7 game.
But while the Dallas offense fizzled, the
defense didn't, particularly Brown, who joined
Miami's Jake Scott 13 years ago as the only
ot her defensive back to win a Super Bowl MVP
trophy. And that was enough for the Cowboys
to join San Francisco as only teams to win five
Super Bowls.
Pittsburgh, which won four Super Bowls
during the 19705, lost for the first time in five
appearances.
Dallas' victory also bailed out Switzer, who
took over from Jimmy Johnson hist season
after Johnson and Dallas owner Jerry Jones
had their well-publicized divorce. Switzer thus
joined Johnson as the only coaches to win both
college and pro championships despite a sea
son of gaffes that left him labeled "Bozo the
Coach."
The Cowboys were favored by 13 1/2 points,
hut after the narrow win even the trophy cele
bration was subdued.
"This ball game represents the kind of sea
son we've had," said Jones in accepting the
Vince Lombardi Trophy from commissioner
Paul Tagliabue, who had bitterly attacked
Jones on national television earlier in the day.
"This was a struggle," said Jones, who
turned away quickly as he accepted the trophy.
"But this for me was the sweetest."
