NEWTOWN SQUARE, Pa. (AP) -
An heir to the du Pont fortune was
captured by SWAT team members yes
terday as he stepped outside his man
sion to fix his boiler, ending a 48-hour
standoff that began with the shooting
death of a top wrestler.
John E. du Pont, who had been
without heat since police cut off his
boiler system Friday night, told nego
tiators he was cold and was leaving his
house, said Newtown Township Police
Chief Michael Mallon.
He did not carry one of the many

weapons he kept on his 800-acre
estate. No one was injured in the cap
ture.
"His Intent was to make repair to
the boilers because he was without
heat," Mallon said. "Within a few
moments our SWAT teams were on
the location and they made a capture."
Police, who had cleared the
entrance to the estate hours earlier,
picked up du Pont at about 3:30 p.m.
and took him to the police station.
Du Pont, 57, arrived kneeling in a
black van, his hands handcuffed

behind him. Wearing a jacket advertis
ing his world-class wrestling center
and team, Foxcatcher, and running
tights, du Pont looked dazed as an offi
cer grabbed him by the handcuffs and
lifted him out of the van.
I)u Pont was arraigned on murder
and weapons charges, then jailed with
out bond pending a Feb. 1 hearing.
The capture ended a standoff that
police said began Friday afternoon
with du Pont shooting Dave Schultz, a
wrestler living on du Pont's estate.
Police said Du Pont pulled up in his
silver Lincoln Town Car and opened
fire as Schultz was standing outside
his home on the estate grounds, where
he lived with his wife, Nancy, and their
two children.
Mrs. Schultz read a short statement
to reporters after the standoff ended,
surrounded by the couple's 9-year-old
son, Alexander, 6-year-old daughter,
Danielle, and other family members.
"Our family is devastated and sad
dened by Dave's brutal, unexpected
loss," Mrs. Schultz said. "He was not
only a world class athlete, coach and
mentor, but a devoted and loving
father to our children and husband to
me for the past 14 years."
She refused to discuss the circum
stances of the case or answer ques
tions.
"While I have no idea why John
committed this senseless and brutal
killing of my husband, I am confident
that the police and authorities will
conduct a thorough investigation and
bring him to justice," she said.
According to an affidavit, Mrs.
Schultz saw du Pont fire the third and
final shot into her husband's body
after he had already fallen to the
ground. She told police that at one
point, du Pont pointed the .38 caliber
revolver at her, the affidavit said.
