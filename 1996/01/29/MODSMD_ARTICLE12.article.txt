Challenger tragedy remembered
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — At a mournful, 10-
year remembrance yesterday, the rumbling flyover of Air
Force jets at the precise moment of Challenger's last liftoff
gave way to 73 seconds of pained silence.
The silence, marking the doomed flight's duration, was
punctuated only by traffic and the screams of sea gulls.
Some 400 people — ex-astronauts, shuttle managers,
Kennedy Space Center workers and many tourists — were
united by their memories of that awful day when the
seven crewmembers died.
"Thank goodness I had sunglasses on," said a weepy
Hetty Ranck, visiting from Honey Brook, Pa.
Darlene Drouillard of Belle River, Ontario, brought her
two daughters, ages 6 and 8, to teach them two important
lessons: that good can come from tragedy and anyone can
aspire to a dream.
Before the ceremony, she explained to her daughters
that a schoolteacher — much like their own schoolteach
ers — had died aboard Challenger.
"They understand that it was the first time, with
Christa McAuliffe, that we'll say a regular person was able
to aspire to a dream," she said.
"Mommy, who's she?" interrupted 6-year-old Lauren.
Indeed, many of the children accompanying their par
ents to the Kennedy Space Center for the Astronauts
Memorial Foundation ceremony had not yet been born
when Challenger shattered 8.9 miles above the Atlantic
Ocean 73 seconds after liftoff at 11:38 a.m. on Jan. 28,
1986.
French urged to halt nuclear testing
PARIS (AP) France ignored calls from world leaders
and environmentalists to stop its nuclear testing in the
South Pacific, refusing to say yesterday whether its latest
atomic explosion would be the last.

France set off the sixth blast of its highly unpopular
nuclear testing program on Saturday.
France's Defense Ministry said the blast took place at
10:30 p.m. French time (1:30 p.m. PST) on Fangataufa
Atoll in French Polynesia, about 750 miles southeast of
Tahiti.
Saturday's explosion released less than 120 kilotons of
energy, according to the Ministry's statement.
In comparison, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima
in 1945 yielded slightly less than 20 kilotons.
Pacific nations reacted angrily to Saturday's blast, with
the Australian, New Zealand and Japanese governments
delivering formal protests to their respective French
ambassadors. Officials from Sweden, the Netherlands and
Norway urged French President Jacques Chirac to end
the program immediately.
Gay weddings could soon be realized
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Lori Guidos and Cheryl
Deaner went to City Hall, paid $35 and received a certifi
cate that said San Francisco officially recognized them as
partners.
While they had the certificate, they watched heterosex
ual couples get marriage licenses and head for civil wed
ding ceremonies.
"People get a piece of paper for the marriage license and
people get a piece of paper for domestic partners, but
they're not equal," Guidos said.
The city's Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote
today on a proposal that would allow the city to perform
symbolic domestic partnership marriages. The union,
which could be performed for homosexual or heterosexual
couples, would carry no legal weight.
At least 3,000 unmarried couples, most of them gay,
already have filed as domestic partners since the city legal
ized the procedure in 1991.
