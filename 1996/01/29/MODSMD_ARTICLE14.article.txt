## Editorials ID sticker shock 
### 
IT TOOK A great deal of plan
ning, organization and patience
before the University finally
implemented the new ID card stan
dard. But finally, this year every
one has their permanent, mag
striped, Cardinal-dollar-bearing,
potential-ATM II) cards.
Unfortunately, the new system
still offers no way to determine at a
glance whether card holders are
current students. A special elec
tronic card reader must still be
used.
However, in some cases, groups
like the Speakers Bureau and
dorms and fraternities, which offer
admittance to events or parties
only to current Stanford students,
have been left out in the cold.
This is most likely a simple over
sight on the part of the University.
In all fairness, no one could have
been expected to foresee all poten
tial uses and problems with the
new system.

However, the dilemma of deter
mining student status was raised
early last quarter and the Universi
ty has had ample time to consider
its options.
And while the problem could
have been solved with the use of
attachable stickers, such a crude
solution seems to have escaped
the powers that be. It would seem
that the gee-whiz, high-tech
aspects of the new universal Stan
ford ID cards may have overshad
owed the consideration of such
simple solutions. Telling the
Speakers Bureau and any dorm or
fraternity to shell out $1,000 for
an electronic reader to host an
event limited to current Stanford
students is simply unfair.
Instead, the University should
make readers available on loan for
just such occasions. Hopefully, the
failure of the University to offer
such a service is also just another
oversight.
