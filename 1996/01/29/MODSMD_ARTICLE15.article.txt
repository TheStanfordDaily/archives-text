# An unfair policy

ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS
destined to be one of the hot-hut
ton issues of the 1996 campaign
season, but all too often the issue
gets mired down in politics and polit
ical posturing. In its attempt to stem
the flow of illegal immigration,
Congress may also make legal immi
gration more difficult with the
Immigration Reform Act of 1995.
Commendably, Stanford has
opposed the bill through its office of
government relations. At issue are
the thousands of foreign students
who come to American colleges and
universities to study and do
research. Among other provisions,
the bill blocks the extension of stu
dents' visas if their studies take
longer than expected and requires a
screening process for students who
want to receive permanent resident
status.
The problem is that if some for
eign students have a bad quarter or
if they suddenly discover that their
research would take longer than pre

dicted. they would not automatically
have the option of staying longer.
Those who want to do so or wish to
continue as graduate students
would have to petition their request
through the U.S. Attorney General's
office.
As well, students who need on
the-job training to complement their
academics would be inconvenienced
by the screening process. If
Congress insists on passing its bill, it
should also work on loosening for
eign-work visa laws for students.
The bill is more than just an
inconvenience. Such bureaucratic
increases would severely strain the
resources of organizations such as
the Bechtel International Center,
which handles the paperwork for
international students. Such centers
may not be able to keep up without
additional staff.
The new bill fits poorly with the
realities of higher education, and
the University must continue to
oppose it.
