## Brendan's secret shame 
### 
AT A SCHOOL where you are
more likely to have a third nipple
than a date, there is only one sub
ject that I have left to abuse before my
15 minutes of fame are up: masturba
tion.
Despise it, deny it, disguise it, the
truth is that 95 percent of your red
faced roommates are indeed performing
the five-knuckle shuffle as soon as you
turn your back. And, of course, 95 per
cent of them assure you that they are
among the five percent who not only
have never indulged in "five against
Willie," but also become nauseous at
the mere thought. It is here that our
society has gone wrong.
In a time of AIDS and other STDs,
the safest sex of all is, ironically, the one
that makes people feel most guilty. Our
conservative history has reduced self
lovemaking to a level of respect far
below flatulence. Is this right?
"Manual sex," in this sense, is actu
ally humankind's only natural luxury.
It is sex without the commitment.
Everyone involved is happy, no one is
pregnant, VDs aren't even a concern
and it doesn't cost a cent. But I am not
the first to honor "boxing the puppet."
Robinson Crusoe once said, "I cannot
describe what I owe this gentle art," and
Cetewayo, the Zulu hero, declared, "A
jerk in the hand is worth two in the
bush." Mark Twain spoke of a line of
prose dear to him on the subject: "None
know it but to live it, none name it but

to praise." Even as far back as ancient
Greece, Homer proclaims, "Give me
masturbation or give me death!" in the
second book of the Iliad.
Furthermore, few realize that it was
actually the astonishing observation of
monkeys proudly playing "wanker the
anchor" that made Charles Darwin sus
pect that men evolved from intelligent
apes. "Who would have thought the key
to our existence would be so close at
hand?" he was heard to have said.
Yet, those who oppose it have some
how managed to convince the world at
large that masturbation is wrong. One
such person is St. Thomas Aquinas,
who dubbed this indulgence an "unnat
ural vice." Yet, no one remembers that
he also mentioned it was the least seri
ous. I believe he also mentions that
leaving the toilet seat up is a more rep
rehensible act, but never do both at the
same time. Solomon said, "There is
nothing to recommend it but its cheap
ness," and Galen went so far as to say,
"It would be better to decapitate the
Major than to use him so."
More recently, Americans found out
that endorsing "holding your own" will
make you the former Surgeon General,
even though we all know that this
instance wasn't the first time Bill Clin
ton "fired the Surgeon General," if you
know what I mean. And how can I leave
out Pee Wee Herman's big adventure?
But take heart. The American Medi
cal Association has considered it "nor

mal sexual activity" for 24 years now,
and there is no mention of hairy palms,
going blind, acned brows or even
damnation. Not that those risks ever
stopped anyone though.
I believe that society's condemnation
of masturbation is simply a matter of
wording. After all, very few admit to
masturbating, but all but a few have
given into spanking Hank, saluting the
general, varnishing the banister, con
sulting with their silent partner, slap
ping Johnny on the back, stretching the
truth, lubricating the monkey, making
the world safe for democracy, shaking
hands with the unemployed, exercising
their right to privacy, shaking hands
with the governor, teaching their chil
dren to fly or simply playing it safe.
Before I end, I would like to thank
the five different librarians that did not
throw me out of the library when I told
them I needed help with masturbation,
and Mark Twain, for his insights and
literary research on the subject.
Finally, a warning from Mark Twain
himself: "If you must gamble away your
lives sexually, don't play a Lone Hand
too much."

When I came to The Daily, / was but the
learner. Now I am the master. (Only a
master of evil, Mr. McCulloueh).
