SCBN is unworthy of The Daily's praise

In the Jan. 24 issue of The Daily, an
editorial was published praising the
Stanford Cardinal Broadcast Net
work for starting the new Tele Flicks
service. The editorial encouraged SCBN
to continue to strive for improvement
and growth in its services. As a member
of Stanford Taiko, a student organiza
tion that has dealt with SCBN in the
past year, I found these laudatory com
ments to be undeserved. While SCBN
may merit praise for starting such a
great new project, it should be duly
noted that SCBN has abandoned an old
one, leaving members of Stanford Taiko
to go around apologizing for SCBN's
shortcomings.
On May 14, 1995, Stanford Taiko
hosted two other collegiate taiko
(Japanese drumming) groups in what
was called the Stanford Taiko Invita
tional '95. Several professional guest
performers also made trips to Stanford

to give clinics and perform in the invita
tional's finale concert. Earlier in spring
quarter, a representative of SCBN
approached us and offered to videotape
the concert. He said that SCBN would
do the taping for free and merely asked
that all tapes be sold by SCBN at a rate
of $10 per tape. We agreed and at the
concert itself, the emcee announced that
SCBN would be taking orders for video
tapes in the lobby.
Approximately 50 videotapes were
ordered. We were told the tapes would
be ready in two weeks. For the out-of
town guests who ordered videotapes,
SCBN promised that as long as we gave
them addresses, the tapes would be
mailed out to them with no extra
postage charged.
Admittedly, the two-week turn
around time sounded too good to be
true. And it was â€” it has now been
eight months.

Sometime in the middle of the sum
mer, a batch of about 10 tapes were given
to a member of our group who happened
to be on campus. These were distributed
first to our guest clinicians. A few Stan
ford Taiko members also got tapes. Many
of these tapes, however, were defective.
Some had only an audio track or only a
video track. Anyone who has seen a taiko
performance knows that taiko is both an
audio and visual experience.
As of yet, the remainder of the orders
have not been filled. Stanford Taiko has
received multiple complaints about the
lengthy wait and has been forced to apolo
gize on behalf of SCBN. Repeated inquiries
have been made to SCBN as to the where
abouts of the tapes. One member of Stan
ford Taiko is currently designated to deal
with the "SCBN problem." It is sad that
this situation has become the last vestige of
a concert that was an amazing, milestone
accomplishment for our group.

To add insult to injury, in mid-Octo
ber 1995, SCBN broadcast the video
from our invitational. Many of our
members had not even seen the tape at
that point. Unfortunately, we were hav
ing a rehearsal on that night and could
not be at home to watch it.
If SCBN were having problems fulfill
ing its obligations, we would have been
happy to find a way to copy and dis
tribute the tapes ourselves. After all, we
understand the limitations of time and
resources in operating a voluntary stu
dent group. However, watching SCBN
expand its services and be praised for
doing so is quite disconcerting. If SCBN
had problems copying and distributing
50 videotapes, the ASSU and the stu
dent body may choose to be skeptical
about any further expansion.
