## Heart-lung patient recovering slowly 
### Frank Guinan Editorial staff 
Sandra Jensen, the first person
with Down syndrome believed to
undergo a major transplant, was
downgraded from fair to critical
condition over the weekend at
Stanford Medical Center.
Jensen, 35, who suffers from
the genetic disorder, received a
new heart and lungs in a 4 1/2-
hour operation last week. She was
placed in critical condition imme
diately after the operation and re
mained there for a day and a half,
after which her condition was up
graded to fair.
Jensen is currently on a respi
rator and her vital signs are sta
ble, according to Medical Center
spokeswoman Ilosanne Spector.
Stanford and UC-San Diego,
t he only two places in California
approved to perform a heart / lung
transplant under Medicare, origi
nally refused to perform Jensen's

operation, citing her disability as
one of the main reasons. Both
medical centers stated she would
not be able to cope with her post
operative condition.
Stanford officials reversed
their decision after Jensen's case
received national attention. Their
actions were criticized as being in
violation of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
Jensen's stepfather, who pre
ferred not to be named, said he
was encouraged bv her progress
last week. Although he expected
to fly back to his home in Oregon
last Thursday, he said he will re
main in California until he feels
Jensen is out of danger.
Over the weekend, hospital of
ficials said Jensen was communi
cating with sign language. "She is
aware and oriented . . . and is
doing a little better," said Spector.
Jensen was one of approxi
mately 200 people nationwide
waiting for a heart-lung trans
plant. Only 70 such operations are
performed each year, and the nor

mal wait for a transplant was two
years.
Jensen's surprisingly short wait
was due to her blood type, which
only two other people on Stanford's
list had. The organs were too small
for the other patients, leaving
Jensen as the only one who could
benefit from the organs.
