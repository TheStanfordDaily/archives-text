It doesn't get a whole lot ugli
er than it did in the first half of
the Stanford women's basket
ball game against Washington
State Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion.

'I think both teams
got after it defensive
iy-'
— Harold Rhodes

Vanessa Nygaard, the Cardi
nal's sharp-shooting sophomore
forward, missed all five of her
field-goal attempts. Kate Star
bird, junior forward extraordi
naire, shot an uncharacteristic
2-of-9. All in all, the Stanford
women went a combined 8-for
-33 from the floor on the half —
a horrendous 24.2 percent -
and missed nine of 10 from
three-point range.
Luckily for the sixth-ranked
Cardinal, however, the Cougars
didn't fair much better. On a
night when Stanford and Wash
ington State shot a combined
32.1 percent from the field,
Stanford (15-2 overall, 8-0
Pacific 10 Conference) relied on
its defense, rebounding and
near-flawless free-throw shoot
ing to pull out a 66-50 win over
(he Cougars (13-5, 4-3) before a
season-high crowd of 6,746.
"I think both teams got after
it defensively," said Washington
State head coach Harold
Rhodes. "And when you have
(wo teams that play that hard
defensively, you're going to have
some ugly situations. You're

going to have some (statistics)
that don't look as appealing. But
you have to credit how hard
those two teams worked on the
defensive end of the court."
Stanford head coach Amy
Tucker suspected that her
team's shooting woes might
have resulted from an altogeth
er different cause. "You know,
we got new rims in Maples in
December," she said. "Better
call the court guard and ask him
to put the old ones back on
because these new ones are not
working. We've been shooting
atrocious percentages here."
"Atrocious" pretty much
summed up the game as far as
the offenses were concerned.
The Cardinal connected on only
19 of 62 shots for a season-low
30.6 field-goal percentage.
Washington State held the
three-point-happy Stanford
women to just one trey in 18
tries.
"1 felt we played a very good
defensive game," Rhodes said.
"We got after them the way that
we wanted to."
Unfortunately for the
Cougars however, Stanford
played a good defensive game as
well. The Cardinal held WSU to
33.9 percent shooting and outre
bounded the Cougars 53-30.
And while Washington State
made 19 shots — the same num
ber as the Cardinal — free
throws ultimately made the dif
ference.
"Basically, what really hurt
us was the fact that we shot 14
free throws and they shot 30,"
said Washington State forward
Jenni Ruff.
Stanford buried 27 of those
30 free throws (a season-best 90
percent). On a night when the
Cardinal couldn't make much
from outside 10 feet, Stanford
simply couldn't miss from the
free-throw line.
Nevertheless, that fact didn't
