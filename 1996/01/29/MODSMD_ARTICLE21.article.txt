It doesn't get a whole lot ugli
er than it did in the first half of
the Stanford women's basket
ball game against Washington
State Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion.

'I think both teams
got after it defensive
iy-'
— Harold Rhodes

Vanessa Nygaard, the Cardi
nal's sharp-shooting sophomore
forward, missed all five of her
field-goal attempts. Kate Star
bird, junior forward extraordi
naire, shot an uncharacteristic
2-of-9. All in all, the Stanford
women went a combined 8-for
-33 from the floor on the half —
a horrendous 24.2 percent -
and missed nine of 10 from
three-point range.
Luckily for the sixth-ranked
Cardinal, however, the Cougars
didn't fair much better. On a
night when Stanford and Wash
ington State shot a combined
32.1 percent from the field,
Stanford (15-2 overall, 8-0
Pacific 10 Conference) relied on
its defense, rebounding and
near-flawless free-throw shoot
ing to pull out a 66-50 win over
(he Cougars (13-5, 4-3) before a
season-high crowd of 6,746.
"I think both teams got after
it defensively," said Washington
State head coach Harold
Rhodes. "And when you have
(wo teams that play that hard
defensively, you're going to have
some ugly situations. You're

going to have some (statistics)
that don't look as appealing. But
you have to credit how hard
those two teams worked on the
defensive end of the court."
Stanford head coach Amy
Tucker suspected that her
team's shooting woes might
have resulted from an altogeth
er different cause. "You know,
we got new rims in Maples in
December," she said. "Better
call the court guard and ask him
to put the old ones back on
because these new ones are not
working. We've been shooting
atrocious percentages here."
"Atrocious" pretty much
summed up the game as far as
the offenses were concerned.
The Cardinal connected on only
19 of 62 shots for a season-low
30.6 field-goal percentage.
Washington State held the
three-point-happy Stanford
women to just one trey in 18
tries.
"1 felt we played a very good
defensive game," Rhodes said.
"We got after them the way that
we wanted to."
Unfortunately for the
Cougars however, Stanford
played a good defensive game as
well. The Cardinal held WSU to
33.9 percent shooting and outre
bounded the Cougars 53-30.
And while Washington State
made 19 shots — the same num
ber as the Cardinal — free
throws ultimately made the dif
ference.
"Basically, what really hurt
us was the fact that we shot 14
free throws and they shot 30,"
said Washington State forward
Jenni Ruff.
Stanford buried 27 of those
30 free throws (a season-best 90
percent). On a night when the
Cardinal couldn't make much
from outside 10 feet, Stanford
simply couldn't miss from the
free-throw line.
Nevertheless, that fact didn't

seem to matter in the first half.
Ruff, who entered the week as
the Puc-10's second-leading scor
er with a 22.4 per-game average,
made five of nine shots in the
first 20 minutes to help the
Cougars keep pace with the cold
shooting Cardinal. Defensively,
WSU switched to a 2-3 zone in
the early going, and suddenly
Stanford forgot how to make bas
kets.
"We're really struggling offen
sively," Tucker said. "When they
went into that zone, we got really
cold. I think we're getting good
looks. We're spending a lot of
time on shooting, land! people
have confidence.
"You're going have games
like this, I hut] it's nice to know
that we can count on our
defense and our rebounding to
win games."
Stanford entered halftime
clinging to a 27-26 lead and
trailed 32-31 with 15 minutes, 11
seconds remaining in the second
half. That's when the Cardinal
embarked on a 10-0 run, capped
by point guard Jamila Wide
man's driving layup with 8:17
left in the game that put the Car
dinal ahead 41-32.
Sophomore Heather Owen's
16-foot jumper from the right
corner with 3:46 remaining con
cluded an 8-0 run that pushed
Stanford ahead 57-42, and that
was that for the Washington
State women. The Cardinal made
all eight of its free throws down
the stretch to ice the 66-50 victo
ry.
Starbird finished with a team
high 18 points and a career-best
10 rebounds. Sophomore forward
Naomi Mulitauaopele added 15
points and 10 rebounds, while
Wideman contributed 11 points
and five assists. Nygaard, on the
other hand, finished with just
two points after missing 10 of 11
shots.
"It was not a pretty offensive
game for us," Tucker said.

Stanford buried 27 of those
30 free throws (a season-best 90
percent). On a night when the
Cardinal couldn't make much
from outside 10 feet, Stanford
simply couldn't miss from the
free-throw line.
Nevertheless, that fact didn't

seem to matter in the first half.
Ruff, who entered the week as
the Puc-10's second-leading scor
er with a 22.4 per-game average,
made five of nine shots in the
first 20 minutes to help the
Cougars keep pace with the cold
shooting Cardinal. Defensively,
WSU switched to a 2-3 zone in
the early going, and suddenly
Stanford forgot how to make bas
kets.
"We're really struggling offen
sively," Tucker said. "When they
went into that zone, we got really
cold. I think we're getting good
looks. We're spending a lot of
time on shooting, land! people
have confidence.
"You're going have games
like this, I hut] it's nice to know
that we can count on our
defense and our rebounding to
win games."
Stanford entered halftime
clinging to a 27-26 lead and
trailed 32-31 with 15 minutes, 11
seconds remaining in the second
half. That's when the Cardinal
embarked on a 10-0 run, capped
by point guard Jamila Wide
man's driving layup with 8:17
left in the game that put the Car
dinal ahead 41-32.
Sophomore Heather Owen's
16-foot jumper from the right
corner with 3:46 remaining con
cluded an 8-0 run that pushed
Stanford ahead 57-42, and that
was that for the Washington
State women. The Cardinal made
all eight of its free throws down
the stretch to ice the 66-50 victo
ry.
Starbird finished with a team
high 18 points and a career-best
10 rebounds. Sophomore forward
Naomi Mulitauaopele added 15
points and 10 rebounds, while
Wideman contributed 11 points
and five assists. Nygaard, on the
other hand, finished with just
two points after missing 10 of 11
shots.
"It was not a pretty offensive
game for us," Tucker said.
