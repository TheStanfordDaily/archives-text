## Cross, Knight alleviate Cardinal road woes

Stanford answered any ques
tions about lackluster play on the
road with a gutty, foul-filled 78-
67 victory over Washington State
in front of a frost-bitten crowd in
Beasley Coliseum Saturday after
noon.
Despite the frightful weather
outside, the Cardinal (11-5, 5-3
Pacific 10 Conference) and the
Cougars (8-7, 1-6) proved equally
scary at times during a game that
never got into a groove. Stanford
committed a season-high '21
turnovers but managed to hold
Washington State to 32.4 percent
shooting. The teams combined for
61 personal fouls.
"When we didn't score, they
didn't score," said Cardinal senior
Dion Cross. "That was the key
our defense. We were more
aggressive."
The Cougars and Cardinal bat
tled closely throughout the first
half, with neither team ever lead
ing by more than six. With for
wards Darren Allaway and Andy
Poppink both saddled with two
fouls apiece, head coach Mike
Montgomery turned once again to
freshmen Peter Sauer and Mark
Seaton for key minutes.
The freshman frontcourt duo
responded, playing 10 and 13
minutes respectively. Seaton tal
lied 10 first-half points and Sauer
added five and three rebounds.
"We got great play off the
bench," Montgomery said.
"Seaton and Sauer came in and
were really good in the first half."
The two freshmen went on to
play 21 minutes each, two more
than either Poppink or Allaway.
Seaton finished the game with 12
points (one shy of tying his
career-high) and Sauer scored
eight despite injuring his left
hand.
After the back-and-forth first

half, the Cardinal bided its time
before finding the right spot to
pull ahead. After Cougar Mark
Hendrickson's free throw cut
Stanford's lead to four at 38-34
three minutes into the half, the
Cardinal clamped down on the
Cougars defensively.
For the next 1 1 minutes,
Washington State was as cold as
the Pullman weather, making
only four of 18 shots. At one
point, despite pounding the offen
sive glass, Washington State
missed 10 straight shots.
"At some point, we had to
come out and show some intesti
nal fortitude, if you will," Mont
gomery said. "We started, and the
shots didn't go down. But what
we did do is translate back to the
defensive end so we never let
them get away from us, and then
we started playing."
During the Cougar drought,
Stanford moved from a four-point
lead to a 14-point advantage,
punctuated by a three-pointer by
Sauer at the five-minute, 45-sec
ond mark. After that, Washington
State never got closer than eight.
Cross, who led all scorers with
22, did not let a poor shooting day
from three-point territory dis
courage him. Despite missing
four of five from behind the arc,
he used his dribble to get past the
first wave of defenders to knock
down several mid-range jumpers.
He also went 9-for-9 from the
free-throw line, raising his season
average to 93.8 percent.
Brevin Knight added 19 points
(8-for-11 from the line) and a
team-high seven rebounds.
Knight harassed Cougar point
guard Dominic Ellison through
out the game. Ellison missed all
seven of his field-goal attempts,
and Knight stole the ball from
him in the open court on back-to
back possessions, showing Ellison
who reigns as the real king of Pac
-10 point guards.
"This is what we expected,"
Knight said. "We wanted to play
hard. We didn't want to let them
get any confidence. We just want
ed to hang in there until we could

make a move. If we keep playing
defense, the shots will fall."
After falling behind by double
digits, Washington Stale wit
nessed a string of its players foul
out. Ellison, called for his fourth
personal with 4:23 left, protested
the call as David Harbour lined up
for a free throw and was reward
ed with a technical foul, which
counted as his fifth personal.
One minute, 23 seconds later,
Shamon Antrum sat down for
good, followed by Hendrickson 78
seconds later and Carlos Daniel
with 41 seconds remaining
The Cardinal also, committed
several hard fouls of its own.
However, the Cougars were
unable to capitalize from the line,
shooting only 18-for-32 free
throws. Hendrickson, a 78 per
cent shooter on the year, missed
11 of 21. The poor performance
may have been partly due to the
large pad on Hendrickson's bro
ken shooting hand, which had
sidelined the senior forward for
six games.
Saturday's win came as Stan
ford's first at Washington State
since the 1989-90 season. It was
also the first Pac-10 road win for
the Cardinal since beating USC
85-82 on Jan. 28 last year.

After falling behind by double
digits, Washington Stale wit
nessed a string of its players foul
out. Ellison, called for his fourth
personal with 4:23 left, protested
the call as David Harbour lined up
for a free throw and was reward
ed with a technical foul, which
counted as his fifth personal.
One minute, 23 seconds later,
Shamon Antrum sat down for
good, followed by Hendrickson 78
seconds later and Carlos Daniel
with 41 seconds remaining
The Cardinal also, committed
several hard fouls of its own.
However, the Cougars were
unable to capitalize from the line,
shooting only 18-for-32 free
throws. Hendrickson, a 78 per
cent shooter on the year, missed
11 of 21. The poor performance
may have been partly due to the
large pad on Hendrickson's bro
ken shooting hand, which had
sidelined the senior forward for
six games.
Saturday's win came as Stan
ford's first at Washington State
since the 1989-90 season. It was
also the first Pac-10 road win for
the Cardinal since beating USC
85-82 on Jan. 28 last year.
