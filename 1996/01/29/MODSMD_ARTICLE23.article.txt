# Basketball unbeatable despite struggles
## 
### Bobby Cuza Staff writer 
The Stanford women's basketball team's
Pacific 10 Conference opponents received both
good news and bad news last Saturday night.
The good news was that Stanford is mired
in its worst shooting slump of the season and
suddenly looks very beatable — even when
the opponent was Washington State, a team
the Cardinal mauled last year by scores of 94-
59 and 81-47.
However, the bad news was that no matter
how badly Stanford plays, the Cardinal just
can't seem to lose.
Last Thursday, Washington suffered a 13-
point defeat at the hands of the Cardinal on a
night when the Huskies held junior phenom
Kate Starbird scoreless for nearly 23 minutes.
Saturday night, the Cardinal bested Washing
ton State by 16 points despite posting its worst
shooting performance of the season.
"I guess the only redeeming thing about the
game is [that] it's nice to know that you can
win games and not play well, not shoot well,"
said Cardinal head coach Amy Tucker after
Saturday night's 66-50 victory.
In what was supposed to be a rebuilding
year for Stanford after losing three starters
and head coach Tara VanDerveer (not to men
tion the departure of sophomore sensation
Kristin Folkl, who will train with the U.S.
National Volleyball Team), initial results indi
cate that the sixth-ranked Cardinal simply has

too many weapons for its undermanned Pac
-10 foes.
If it's not Vanessa Nygaard burying threes,
Jamila Wideman splintering defenses with her
darting drives to the hole or Kate Starbird
draining the net from inside and outside, then
it's the post tandem of Olympia Scott and
Naomi Mulitauaopele wreaking havoc on
opposing defenses. There's always somebody
ready to pick up the slack for this year's Car
dinal squad.
Thursday, with Starbird in hibernation and
the rest of the Cardinal offense struggling,
Wideman took it upon herself to shred the
Washington defense for 18 second-half points
while lifting Stanford to a 67-54 victory. Sat
urday, the entire team was stone cold, but the
Cardinal still had enough defense, rebounding
and pinpoint free-throw shooting to "squeeze
out" a 16-point win.
With the midway point in the conference
season less than a week away, Stanford (8-0
Pac-10) now enjoys a two-and-a-half game
cushion in the Pac-10 standings. Washington,
with a 5-2 conference mark, is the Cardinal's
nearest rival.
But that's not all. As if Stanford weren't
formidable enough to begin with, the Cardinal
is just now beginning to recover from a rash of
injuries that plagued the women over the hol
idays.

waning moments of a 72-68 win
at Texas Dec. 30 and missed three
starts. But the team co-captain is
now back at full strength, as evi
denced by her game-saving per
formance last Thursday night.
Sophomore center / forward
Heather Owen, meanwhile, is
slowly recovering from a stress
reaction in her left foot that
forced her to miss six games.
Owen performed well in 19 min
utes of action Saturday (nine
points, four rebounds), the most
time she'd seen since the Cardi

rial's 90-72 win over Tennessee
on Dec. 16.
"It feels pretty good," Owen
said. "Actually, this is probably
the one game I've come away
from not I feeling] real painful. In
practice, I'm doing more — more
running, more pounding activi
ties — so I think I'm on my way
back."
The Cardinal didn't escape
unscathed, however. Senior
guard Bobbie Kelsey suffered a
sprained right knee in practice
three weeks ago, an injury which
was later tied to anterior cruciate
ligament damage. Kelsey under
went reconstructive surgery on
Jan. 18 and will remain sidelined
for the rest of the season.

While Kelsey's injury has
thrust junior Charmin Smith into
the starting lineup, the Cardinal
has absorbed the loss with rela
tive ease — nine straight wins will
attest to that fact. Now, if Stan
ford could just break out of its
nasty shooting slump. . .
"I think we have good shoot
ers," Tucker said. "I don't think
this is indicative of the type of
shooting team we have, but obvi
ously, I think that these things
can catch up with you. If you con
tinue to have these types of prob
lems — not executing offensively,
not hitting shots when you're
open, people maybe not stepping
up a little bit offensively — it can
catch up with you."
