# Swimming falls to USC
## Women's swimming's winning streak comes to end 
### Ratha Harntha Editorial staff 
The worst thing about
streaks is that they eventually
have to come to an end.
Third-ranked USC upset the
top-ranked Stanford women's
swimming and diving team 153-
147 last Saturday in Los Ange
les, giving Richard Quick his
first loss in the 58 dual meets
since he took over the head
coaching position at Stanford in
1988.
"I'm really disappointed,"
said senior co-captain Jane Skill
man. "It was a heartbreaker. No
one performed out of their
minds, but everyone did their
job. |USC] just out-performed

us, but we went down with a
fight."
Entering the second to last
race of the competition, Stan
ford (5-1 overall, 2-1 Pacific 10
Conference) desperately needed
a victory to have any hope of
pulling out a win in the relay,
the last race of the meet. Fortu
nately for the Cardinal, fresh
man Kari Edwards came
through in the 400 IM. She
slipped past USC freshman Ali
son Fealy by .1 seconds and gave
the Cardinal hope.
"She beat someone she's not
suppose to beat to give us a shot
lat winning the meetl," Skill
man said. "That's the kind of
effort it takes to win at the
NCAAs."
In the end, however, the Cardi
nal fell short. The Trojans cap
tured the 400-meter relay with a
time of three minutes, 50.48 sec
onds, handing Stanford its first
loss in eight years. The relay was
the Trojans' 10th win of the meet.

We gave it our best
at this point [in the
season]'
— Lisa Jacob

"We gave it our best at this
point [in the season]," said senior
co-captain Lisa Jacob. "We're
still in great position. Losing
sucks, but our focus is March,
and we kept that in mind."
Even with the loss, there

were some bright spots for the
Cardinal aside from Edwards'
victory in the 400 IM. Junior
Sarah Anderson captured both
the 400- and 800-meter freestyle
with times of 4:18.26 and
8:51.76, respectively. Junior
Megan Gardner finished first in
the one-meter diving competi
tion with a score of 258.45.
Junior Claudia Franco and
Jacob captured the 50- and 200-
meter freestyle, respectively.
The Cardinal also competed
against California on Saturday
and crushed the Golden Bears
244-56. On Friday, Stanford
overpowered UCLA in its first
meet of the weekend.
"We used UCLA as a warm
up for USC," Jacob said.
In the end, last weekend will
be remembered for the loss to
USC and its impact on the rest
of the season, especially the Car
dinal's next meeting with the
Trojans at the I*a« 10 Champi
onships on Feb. 15-17.
"We are going to be foaming
at the mouth to win the confer
ence championship," Skillman
said.

fell short this weekend against USC.
