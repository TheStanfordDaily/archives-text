The fourth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team stared his
tory in the eye last Friday night at
Berkeley, and history blinked
first — barely.
On the strength of their inside
hitting, the Cardinal spikers
finally wore down an inspired
California team three games to
one to maintain their 20-year
mastery of the Bears. But Cal,
despite being a club team, gave
Stanford all it could handle. The
Bears won the first game 15-7
before succumbing in the final
three games 15-13, 15-2, 15-11,
spoiling the Weenies' home open
er at Harmon Gym.
"The match was tougher than
I expected," said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves. "We entered
a situation where the team is
playing their biggest game of the
season. They played real well."
With a 1-2 record, Cal looked

to continue its streak of wins over
varsity teams and reach .500. At
the UC-Santa Barbara Collegiate
Tournament two weekends ago,
the Bears knocked off 10th
ranked BYU on their way to an
1 lth-place finish.
In their season opener on Jan.
5, the Bears dropped a three
game decision to eighth-ranked
Pepperdine and later suffered a
three-game blowout at the hands
of UCLA on Jan. 12. "We were
just blocked off the court in that
one," said Cal assistant coach
Cody He in.
In front of a raucous home
crowd, the Weenies came out as if
they had been locked in a room
for three days, ready to take out
their frustration on the Cardinal.
Cal junior Pat Aparicio got things
rolling with a strong block. After
Stanford junior Stewart Chong
evened the score with an ace, the
Bears pushed ahead with another
ace and a block by Aparicio.
The Cardinal answered with a
surge of its own with sophomore
Keenan Whitehurst's block that
put Stanford up 4-3. At that junc
ture, the Cardinal looked ready to
take over the game. Instead, how
ever, the 4-3 advantage was its

last lead in game one.
Cal ripped off four points in a
row before junior Matt Fuer
bringer's kill ebbed the tide slight ly
to make the score 8-5. Unfortunate
ly for Stanford, unforced errors did
the Cardinal in, as junior Mike 1 loe
fer's hit sailed out of bounds to give
the Bears a one-game lead.
"Cal passed the ball real well and
that allowed them to run their
offense," Nieves said. "They also

played tremendous defense. That
put pressure on our hitters."
More sloppy play marked the
start of the second game as the
Bears jumped out to an 8-3 lead.
But the Cardinal spikers main
tained their composure as they
methodically chipped away at the
deficit. Five straight kills by Stan
ford, two each by Fuerbringer and
junior Bri;ui Moore, gave the Cardi
nal a 10-9 edge.
After Cal nudged ahead 11-10,
Moore's and Fuerbringer's kills
brought the Cardinal within a point
of evening the match. But the Car
dinal kept losing serve, and that

allowed Cal to get within one at 14-
13. The ser\'e kept going back and
forth before the lk>ars saw the ball
sail out of bounds on them to end
the second game and give Stanford
a collective sigh of relief.
"What we did that allowed us to
win the match was that we stayed
poised and patient, and we contin
ued to play within ourselves know
ing that we were the better team,"
Nieves said.
The third game proved to be a
20-minute clinic on blocks and kills
put forth by Chong, Whitehurst,
Moore, Hoefer and Fuerbringer. Cal
cringed under the wrath of Stan
ford's three-blocker alignment, as
Moore's thunderous kills and
Chong's and Whitehurst's blocks
buried the Weenies in a 8-1 hole.
Moore then teamed with Hoefer
and Fuerbringer on blocks to make
it 13-1. Chong and Fuerbringer
added the finishing touches on the
third game.
However, just when it appeared
the Weenies would lay down for
their roast, they bounced back and
made things interesting in the final
game. Hoefer's kill gave the Cardi
nal a 5-1 lead, but Cal stormed back
to make it 6-5 on senior Chris Hop
kins' and senior John kills.
Stanford pulled away again as
Whitehurst's block pushed the Car
dinal ahead 14-8. But Cal, irritating
lis a rash by this time, struck back
with a Hopkins ace and junior Ivan
dale's kill to make it 14-11. Moore
ended Cal's run with a kill to regain
serve, however, and then posted yet
another block to put the Bears out
of their misery.
For the match, Moore let! the
way with 21 kills and a .421 hitting
percentage while Whitehurst
chipped in 17 kills for a .535 hitting
percentage. Stanford's team hitting
percentage was only .275, .100
lower than last year's team average
of .375.
Some of the decline was due to
Fuerbringer's performance. Fuer
bringer, still recovering from
surgery, committed 13 errors to go
with his 15 kills in 40 attempts.
Nieves did not plan to play his AII-
American much, but when the
match got tight, he had no choice.
"That was the one bad thing about
the match," Nieves said. "I had to
play Fuerbringer the whole way."
Nevertheless, Nieves was
pleased with the Cardinal's perfor
mance. "Now that it's done and we
survived, its great," he said. "It was
nice that we won where we were in
a hostile environment against an
opponent that's playing well."
