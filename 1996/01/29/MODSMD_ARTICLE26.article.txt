The fourth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team stared his
tory in the eye last Friday night at
Berkeley, and history blinked
first â€” barely.
On the strength of their inside
hitting, the Cardinal spikers
finally wore down an inspired
California team three games to
one to maintain their 20-year
mastery of the Bears. But Cal,
despite being a club team, gave
Stanford all it could handle. The
Bears won the first game 15-7
before succumbing in the final
three games 15-13, 15-2, 15-11,

Cody He in.
In front of a raucous home
crowd, the Weenies came out as if
they had been locked in a room

rolling with a strong block. After
Stanford junior Stewart Chong
evened the score with an ace, the
Bears pushed ahead with another
ace and a block by Aparicio.
The Cardinal answered with a
surge of its own with sophomore
Keenan Whitehurst's block that
put Stanford up 4-3. At that junc
