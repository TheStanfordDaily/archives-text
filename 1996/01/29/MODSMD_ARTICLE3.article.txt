# FRI closure raises faculty tenure, contractual issues

As University officials negotiate with assis

the question of tenure entitlement could play a
large role in whether the talks end peacefully or
with a lawsuit.

rights," Weisberg said. "Anybody is going to
learn in the first year that things are going to
happen that might change the nature of (the
contract]."

two of them within two years of the expected
tenure review process.

opportunity for tenure review when they
signed with Stanford, said Asst. Food Research
Prof. Scott Rozelle. However, most faculty
hope the situation can be resolved without legal
action.
"It is implicitly and explicitly in the contract
