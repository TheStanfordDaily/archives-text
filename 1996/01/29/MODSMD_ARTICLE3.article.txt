# FRI closure raises faculty tenure, contractual issues
## Junior professors say lawsuit could be their last resort 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
As University officials negotiate with assis
tant professors at the Food Research Institute,
the question of tenure entitlement could play a
large role in whether the talks end peacefully or
with a lawsuit.
Since December, representatives of Provost
Condoleezza Rice have met individually with
the institute's junior faculty and offered them
nonspecific plans for their futures at Stanford.
Specific proposals may not be approved until
later next month, however.
The talks were prompted by a decision by
the Advisory Board of the Academic Council,
subsequently approved by University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper, that the institute be
closed, its doctoral program eliminated and its
junior faculty members laid off.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, who also serves
as the vice provost for faculty recruitment and
development, has given junior faculty mem
bers preliminary options for either completing
their duties at Stanford or transferring to an
other department, junior faculty at the insti
tute said.
University lawyers are determining which
circumstances warrant changing contracts for
faculty members. In addition, it is unclear

whether faculty members are guaranteed the
right to a tenure review.
"Changed circumstances can sometimes
justify changes and limitations in contractual
rights," Weisberg said. "Anybody is going to
learn in the first year that things are going to
happen that might change the nature of (the
contract]."
The institute has four assistant professors,
two of them within two years of the expected
tenure review process.
Food Research faculty members have con

sidered suing the University for breach of con
tract, claiming that they were guaranteed the
opportunity for tenure review when they
signed with Stanford, said Asst. Food Research
Prof. Scott Rozelle. However, most faculty
hope the situation can be resolved without legal
action.
"It is implicitly and explicitly in the contract
that says I will come up for tenure," said Asst.
Food Research Prof. Fred Zimmerman. "Now

that's not going to happen."
Zimmerman, in his second
year at the institute, said he was
offered two more years with an
option for a third year to teach
at the new Center for Develop
ment Economics, an offshoot of
the institute that will be housed
in the Institute for Internation
al Studies.
The University is negotiating
with institute faculty in four sec
tions ranging from the most se
nior faculty to Zimmerman and
Asst. Prof. Heidi Albers, the most
junior faculty. The University's
offers vary by section, Zimmer
man said.
As part of their offer, Zimmer
man and Albers will receive a sum
mer salary and more release time
but will have added teaching du
ties and have to develop new
courses, Zimmerman said.
The two senior assistant pro
fessors — Rozelle and Marcel
Fafchamps — received different
offers. Fafchamps said he will like
ly have a choice between receiving
two more years at the institute to
complete his research or apply for
tenure in another department. Be
cause Rozelle was out of the coun
try until last week, he has not yet
received a comprehensive plan.
However, it is unclear whether
departments such as engineering
economic systems, economics or
the Graduate School of Business
will have openings for institute
faculty. Because of the institute's
unique field of study, its faculty
may not match with the courses
and research approaches of other
departments.
"The tough thing is, do we
have to fit into I another! depart
ment?" Rozelle said. "It has to be
a two-way street. I Economics | or
(engineering-economic systems]
would have to want you and you
would have to think you fit into

their program in both teaching
and advising."
Some faculty have also received
offers from other universities.
However, most university eco
nomics departments require that
applications for junior positions
be completed by early December.
The tenure question, however,
is still under review, both by Weis
berg and Senior University Coun
sel Thomas Fenner. Fenner de
clined to comment.
The faculty handbook, which
presents guidelines for tenure
track and non-tenure-track facul
ty, states that appointments can
only be terminated early for rea
sons of incompetence, disciplinary
action, prolonged absence or "se
vere financial emergency."
The handbook, Weisberg said,
"certainly contemplates the possi
bility that departments will close.
What actually happens when de
partments close is not spelled out
in great detail."
To prevent Fafchamps and
Rozelle from automatically ac
quiring tenure, the two-year op
tion offered them will likely in
volve non-tenure appointments.
While institute faculty have
discussed a lawsuit as an option,
most hope a mutually beneficial
solution can be reached.
Fafchamps said he hopes the
University's proposals will dis
miss the thought of a lawsuit from
his mind.
"I'm not following that truck
right now," he said. "I want to give
Weisberg a chance."
Rozelle said he understands
why the lawsuit is under consider
ation, but also hopes it can be
avoided.
"Right now, I see myself trying
to minimize the damage caused by
the whole process," Rozelle said.
"We've all thought about |suing|.
The fact is, Stanford breached our
contract. For us in particular, we
put a lot of time and effort into try
ing to get our program reviewed
for tenure. They take away that
right, that's a breach."
