## 'Flexible' Meyer Library computer lab combines high-tech savvy with low-tech charm 
### Adam Kemezis Contributing writer 
Imagine relaxing on a comfort
able bean bag chair.
Imagine sitting in a computer
lab working on the Internet and the
W< >rld Wide Web.
Now imagine doing both while
attending class.
This thought has now become
reality thanks to a new experimen
tal classroom designed to combine
technological resources with lively
face-to-face interaction.
The Flexible Class Lab, on the
second floor of Meyer Library, was
officially opened Friday and looks
very different from the average
computer lab. Instead of stationary
desktop computers, it is equipped
with laptop computers that stu
dents can use anywhere in the
room.
Also prominent is a video screen
several feet wide that can show tele
vision or videos and am be hooked
up to any of the laptops in the room
via outlets in the floor. The screen
can be used to display a student's
work or a page on the World Wide

Web.
The desks in the room tire small,
and they can easily I>e rearranged
into any configuration. The room
also contains a number of brightly
colored beanbag chairs for use in
discussion sessions.
Charles Kerns, head of the
Media Center at Meyer, said the
aim of the new classroom was to
allow instructors to use all the tech
nological resources of a computer
lab without having to adapt their
teaching style to the kind of "old
fashioned rows and columns"
arrangement, which often focuses
too much on the instructor.
"We don't think of this as a fixed
design but as a place where faculty
can try out new teaching tech
niques," Kerns added.
Kerns said the idea for the class
room first came about in 1994,
when theCurriculum Development
Lab at Meyer received a $165,000
grant from t he Culpepper Founda

tion and a similar amount from the
President's Fund.
Seppo Lehto, a systems integra
tion engineer at Minnesota West
ern, the company that designed and
built the screen and the system of
outlets in the floor, said t he arrange
ment makes studying in small
groups "more natural" by allowing
students to face each other and see
each other while using the laptops.
"Facial gestures and things like
that area big percentage of commu
nication," Lehto said. "It's break
i n g a wall bet wee n teac hers and stu -
dents."
Although the classroom was offi
cially opened in a ceremony Friday,
classes have been meeting there
since the beginning of fall quarter,
though without the benefit of the
video screen. Before fall quarter,
some experimental classes had met
in a mock-up of the classroom in the
basement of Sweet I lall, University
Librarian Michael Keller said in a
speech at the opening ceremony.
The ceremony was also at tended
by University President Gerhard
Casper, who declared himself "very
impressed" and said he would be

visiting in the near future to see the
Flexible Class Lab in action.
Among the courses taught in the
lab fall quarter w;is a second-year
French course taught by John Bar
son, who was enthusiastic in his
praise of the new classroom.
"This is the first computer lab
where they've done it right," he
said, calling it "pleasant, comfort
able and cheerful."
The lab has also been used in a
Writing and Critical Thinking sec
tion taught by English Lecturer
Marjorie Ford, who was also
pleased and impressed with the
room.
The room, Ford said, made stu
dents less nervous and restrained
and let them "think about who they
are writing for, who is their audi
ence."
Other courses taught in the
Flexible Class Lab include begin
ning Polish, human biology and in
troductory logic.
Student reaction to the class
room was mostly favorable.
"It adds a lot to make the class
really relaxed," said freshman Kelly
Burnell, who is in Ford's Writing

and Critical Thinking section.
"The biggest benefit has been
that I look forward to going to class,
even if I've had a bad day." said Bur
ners classmate, freshman Alfredo
Soto.
Most of the comments focused
on the informal, relaxed atmos
phere.
"You get <1 lot closer interaction
with the instructor," said sopho
more Alex Unongo.
But while the atmosphere was
highly praised and wide acclaim for
the beanbag chairs was heard, not
everyone felt they had learned more
as a result of the technological re
sources.
Martin Bruncko, a sophomore
majoring in modern thought and
literature, said the room was
"amazingly well technically
equipped" but said be was unsure
about the value of the equipment in
education.
"1 think I've learned less than I
might have otherwise," he said.
"There's too much technology. . ..
Maybe it's just that because it's be
ginning, | technology I was overem
phasized."
