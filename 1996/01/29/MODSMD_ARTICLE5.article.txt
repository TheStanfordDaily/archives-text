## 'Flexible' Meyer Library computer lab combines high-tech savvy with low-tech charm

Imagine relaxing on a comfort
able bean bag chair.
Imagine sitting in a computer
lab working on the Internet and the
W< >rld Wide Web.
Now imagine doing both while
attending class.
This thought has now become
reality thanks to a new experimen
tal classroom designed to combine
technological resources with lively
face-to-face interaction.
The Flexible Class Lab, on the
second floor of Meyer Library, was
officially opened Friday and looks
very different from the average
computer lab. Instead of stationary
desktop computers, it is equipped
with laptop computers that stu
dents can use anywhere in the
room.
Also prominent is a video screen
several feet wide that can show tele
vision or videos and am be hooked
up to any of the laptops in the room
via outlets in the floor. The screen
can be used to display a student's
work or a page on the World Wide
