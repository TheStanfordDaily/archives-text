# TV or face to face?
## Study contests value of distance learning 
### Marni Leff Contributing writer 
In a study scheduled for publi
cation next month, the American
Federation of Teachers has raised
concerns about maintaining the
quality of various distance learn
ing programs across the nation.
According to an article pub
lished in last week's Chronicle of
Higher Education, the AFT feels
distance learning is a poor substi
tute for the face-to-face contact
that takes place in traditional
classroom settings between un
dergraduate students and profes
sors.
"There's a common stance for
traditional educators against dis
tance learning, and I think there's
some truth to their charge," said
Education Prof. Decker Walker.
"The biggest problem they see is
that people who start courses by
remote typically don't finish."
At Stanford, distance learning
has made its mark through the
Stanford Instructional Television

Network, which allows students
in graduate degree programs and
in undergraduate courses — of
fered primarily in computer sci
ence and electrical engineering —
the ability to learn from afar using
the latest technology.
While some students attend the
actual classroom lectures with the
professor, classes are videotaped
and broadcast both live and on
tape so students as far away as
Spain can learn along with the
students on campus. Students in
volved in the remote learning are
given — through e-mail and the
World Wide Web — the chance to
"talk" to professors and teaching
assistants in much the same way
that on-campus students attend
office hours.
One of the major problems edu
cators point out, Walker said, is
the difficulty of maintaining high
academic standards. Because dis
tance learning is still relatively
new, he added, many companies
that provide distance learning are
in it for the money and don't ade
quately teach students.
"I think that there are genuine
problems," Walker said. "Hut it
doesn't mean that distance learn
ing can't be just as good."
Quality control, explained
SITN Director Andy DiPaolo, is
something SITN has worked to
maintain.
DiPaolo said a five-year study
conducted by Dean of Engineering
Jim Gibbons, who founded the
SITN program 25 years ago, de
termined that students who
learned through SITN videocon
ferencing performed better than
other students.
"We looked at the students who
were actually in the class, the stu
dents who watched the televised
"lectures by themselves and stu
dents who watched in a small
group with a tutor and tracked
them," DiPaolo said. "It turns out
that the students who were en

gaged with the tutor did better, as
far as GPA, than those who actu
ally attended the class. The key is
interaction."
In the future, DiPaolo said, dis
tance education will play a critical
role in education both for econom
ic and time-saving reasons.
"It can save time, lower cost
and enhance learning," DiPaolo
said. "I think as technology con
tinues to improve, it can serve as
the great equalizer. Distance
learning allows people who can't
attend classes to learn."
The key to successful remote
learning programs, DiPaolo said,
is lots of interaction between pro
fessors and students, via e-mail
and the World Wide Web.
Investigating the future of dis
tance education, the Asynchro
nous Distance Education Project
(ADEPT), funded by a $500,000
grant from the Sloan Foundation,
is experimenting with making
SITN classes available to distance
students on demand. Dil'aolo and
Electrical Engineering Prof. Dale
Harris are directing the project.
In addition, University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper formed a

committee in 1994 to look into
using technology to enrich Stan
ford's teaching and learning. This
group has already committed to
studying the expansion of distance
education.
A process needs to be imple
mented, Harris said, to make sure
that quality is maintained for dis
tance learning.
"It remains to be seen how that
plays out," Harris said. "I think
that people overvalue face-to-face
communication because that's the
way it's always been done. I think
that people in technological fields
are far better able to substitute
electronics, because they have
been doing it for so long that it's
easier than for others without
that experience. The jury's kind of
still out on that issue."
One major advantage distance
learning can provide, Harris said,
is allowing people who are other
wise employed to take classes with
out having to come to campus.
"It's a matter of weighing the
value of what we gain," Harris
said. "If something is lost from
distance education, look then at
what we have gained."
