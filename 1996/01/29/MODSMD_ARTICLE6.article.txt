## Study contests value of distance learning

In a study scheduled for publi
cation next month, the American
Federation of Teachers has raised
concerns about maintaining the
quality of various distance learn
ing programs across the nation.
According to an article pub
lished in last week's Chronicle of
Higher Education, the AFT feels
distance learning is a poor substi
tute for the face-to-face contact
that takes place in traditional
classroom settings between un
dergraduate students and profes
sors.
"There's a common stance for
traditional educators against dis
tance learning, and I think there's
some truth to their charge," said
Education Prof. Decker Walker.
"The biggest problem they see is
that people who start courses by
remote typically don't finish."
At Stanford, distance learning
has made its mark through the
Stanford Instructional Television

Network, which allows students
in graduate degree programs and
in undergraduate courses — of
fered primarily in computer sci
ence and electrical engineering —
the ability to learn from afar using
the latest technology.
While some students attend the
actual classroom lectures with the
professor, classes are videotaped
and broadcast both live and on
tape so students as far away as
Spain can learn along with the
students on campus. Students in
volved in the remote learning are
given — through e-mail and the
World Wide Web — the chance to
"talk" to professors and teaching
assistants in much the same way
that on-campus students attend
office hours.
One of the major problems edu
cators point out, Walker said, is
the difficulty of maintaining high
academic standards. Because dis
tance learning is still relatively
new, he added, many companies
