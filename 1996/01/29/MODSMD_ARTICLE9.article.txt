## Program will bring three public service veterans to Stanford as role models 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
The Haas Center for Public Service has kicked
off its 1996 Visiting Mentors Program by choos
ing three models in the world of public serv ice to
share their experiences with service-minded stu
dents.
Stuart Burden, Suzan Shown Harjo and
Linda Wong are all professionals with extensive
experience in the arenas of public and communi
ty service. Each will spend a week interacting
with faculty and stafTon campus.
The three-year-old mentor program, co-spon
sored by the Stanford Alumni Association, aims
to "providestudents with different modelsofhow
people am commit to public and community ser
vice throughout their lives," program director
Jackie Schmidt-Posner said in a press release.
There is a wide range of experience among this
year's selections. Burden, the only Stanford
alumnus in the group, graduated in 1984 with a
degree in human biology. As a program officer in
the Population Program at the Mac Arthur Foun
dation, Burden writes grants and raises funds for
such causes jus reproductive health and rights is
sues and HIV prevention. He will be on campus
during the week of Feb. 25.
I larjo will visit the week of May 5, the week be
fore the annual Stanford Powwow, one of the
biggest Native American cultural festivities in
the nation. 1 larjo, a poet, is the president and ex
ecutive director of The Morning Star Institute, a
national Native American nonprofit organiza
tion. A member of the Cheyenne and Hodulgee

Muscogee tribes, she was responsible for drafting
the Presidential Executive Order on Native
American Religious Freedom and Sacred Lands
Protection.

Wong, the general counsel
and chief financial officer for
Rebuild L.A., a nonprofit orga
nization created to facilitate
economic rebuilding in Ixis An
geles County after the 1992
riots, will be coming to Stanford
next fall. She has also worked
with the Mexican American
Ix>gal Defense and Educational
Fund.

The mentors were chosen from a pool of 60
nominees by an 18-member selection committee
including students, faculty and staff represent
ing various ethnic centers, focus residences, the
Law Sch(X)l and the Alumni Association. The
groups solicited nominations in the fall. Many of
the nominations came from personal connections
such as past internships with potential mentors,
said senior Lisa Dawe, the co-director of the pro
gram.
Dawe said the program had only two mentors
in previous years. Because three mentors are vis
iting this year, there will be "more of a continuous
stream" over the next three quarters, she said.
"When [Schmidt-Posner] described the pro
gram to me, it seemed like kind of a synthesis of
stuff I was interested in — service learning and
an experiential kind of learning where the men
tors come to campus and have real substantive
communication, one-on-one, with the students,"

Dawe said.
Mentors will participate in discussions, semi
nars and meals hosted by dorms and other groups
on campus. They may also visit classes and hold
informal chat sessions.
"It's almost like a little mini-sabbatical for
them," Dawe said, adding that she looks forward
to the mentors addressing the concerns of stu
dents, especially seniors, about a life dedicated to
public service.
Elizabeth Dumanian - Class of '85, member
of the National Advisory Board at the Haas Center
and a University trustee — has chaired the pro
gram's selection committee for two years.
"I think the program is phenomenal in that it
lets students talk in a very personal way with peo
ple who have spent at least 10 years out of college
within and wit hoe >fthe public sector," Duman
ian said.
"The advantage and goal of t his program" is
that it allows "informal contact," she added. Stu
dents will be able to ask questions on topics rang
ing from parents' reactions to their children
choosing a life of public service to "what it's like
to be white and middle class and working with
people of color," Dumanian said.
In many ways, she added, the program offers
an opportunity for the mentors to reflect on their
own careers and give t he kind of advice they wish
they had received when they started in public ser
vice.
Speaking about the program, I bias Center Di
rector Tim Stanton said, "1 he people we've had
so far have been terrific, and we have equal ex
pectations for these next three
