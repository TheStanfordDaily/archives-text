THE STANFORD DAILY IS LOOKING FOR NEW COLUMNISTS.
To apply, submit two sample columns (about 550 words each), samples of any previously published work and
a letter telling us about yourself and the type of writing you'd do, to our office by this Friday, February 2.
We're also looking for people to sit on our editorial board. I kip write the treatises that appear on the top left of
this page. To apply, submit a letter telling us about yourself and why you'd be a good editorial board member.
Questions? Want more information? Call Jesse or Jamie at 725-2100.
