Launched in 1989 at a cost of 51.6 billion, the
Galileo probe streaked into the atmosphere of
Jupiter at a speed of 106,000 mph, relaying new

before being destroyed by high pressure and
temperatures. Last Monday, NASA/AMES
held its first press conference to share this
information with the public. Come to Kimball
to get the inside scoop on this historic mission
from one of the NASA/AMES scientists most
directly involved in it.
