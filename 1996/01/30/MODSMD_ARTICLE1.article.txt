# Muslim students celebrate Ramadan
##

Fasting every day for four weeks is hard
enough. For university students, the task,
which observant Muslims must fulfill during
the month of Ramadan, is even more compli
cated.
Abstaining from dawn to dusk is one of the
five pillars ofthe Islamic faith. Ramadan — the
month according to the lunar calendar in
which the first texts ofthe Koran were revealed
to the prophet Mohammed — falls between
Jan. 22 and Feb. 20 this year.
Many Stanford students observe the fast,
though they may encounter logistical diflicul-

ties.
"It's kind of a problem," said sophomore
Omer Saeed, because most meals are during
daylight hours.
Many Muslim students switch their meal
plan from all-you-can-eat to the equivalent
number of points for the month. However,
those wanting a refund can only get back from
Dining Services one-third of total amount they
paid — just covering the cost of food.
Islamic students said they can find a great
deal of support within the Muslim community
while going through the foodless days.
Junior Munira Rahemtulla said, "It's been
a bonding experience for Muslims on campus,"

some of whom meet every evening for iftar, the
breaking of the fast, which is cooked hy mem
bers of the Islamic Society at Stanford. Follow
ing the meal they have presentations, discus
sions and prayer.
Walid Az/.am. a graduate student, noted
that the point of the fast is not just to abstain
from eating, drinking, smoking and sexual ac
tivities but rather to "abstain from bad
habits."
After all, lie says, ''What does God care if you
don't eator drink?" Instead the emphasis is on
cleansing oneself spiritually.
