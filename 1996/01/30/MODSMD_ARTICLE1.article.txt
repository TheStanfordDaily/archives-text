# Muslim students celebrate Ramadan
## 
### Kerry Rodgers 
Fasting every day for four weeks is hard
enough. For university students, the task,
which observant Muslims must fulfill during
the month of Ramadan, is even more compli
cated.
Abstaining from dawn to dusk is one of the
five pillars ofthe Islamic faith. Ramadan — the
month according to the lunar calendar in
which the first texts ofthe Koran were revealed
to the prophet Mohammed — falls between
Jan. 22 and Feb. 20 this year.
Many Stanford students observe the fast,
though they may encounter logistical diflicul-

ties.
"It's kind of a problem," said sophomore
Omer Saeed, because most meals are during
daylight hours.
Many Muslim students switch their meal
plan from all-you-can-eat to the equivalent
number of points for the month. However,
those wanting a refund can only get back from
Dining Services one-third of total amount they
paid — just covering the cost of food.
Islamic students said they can find a great
deal of support within the Muslim community
while going through the foodless days.
Junior Munira Rahemtulla said, "It's been
a bonding experience for Muslims on campus,"

some of whom meet every evening for iftar, the
breaking of the fast, which is cooked hy mem
bers of the Islamic Society at Stanford. Follow
ing the meal they have presentations, discus
sions and prayer.
Walid Az/.am. a graduate student, noted
that the point of the fast is not just to abstain
from eating, drinking, smoking and sexual ac
tivities but rather to "abstain from bad
habits."
After all, lie says, ''What does God care if you
don't eator drink?" Instead the emphasis is on
cleansing oneself spiritually.

The point of Ramadan is "not to
torture yourself, "Azzam said. Fast
ing beyond sunset is not recom
mended; in fact, "the religion speci
fies that you should eat before
dawn, and you shouldn't delay
breaking the fast in the evening,"
said senior Imran Maskatia.
Maskatia believes that the
willpower necessary to fast during
the day helps him "to be strong in
other parts of life."
Graduate student Yaser Had
dara admits to missing his usual 10
a.m. coffee break, although, he said,
"you get used to it."
More than just an exercise of dis
cipline, the fast enhances a divine

relationship. The purpose "is not tc
get trim but to elevate yourself spir
itually," said Azzam.
Graduate student Youssef Is
mail described the month as a "spir
itual boost" and a time for "wor
shipping God."
Ramadan is also intended tc
"make you aware of the plight of the
poor," said Haddara. "Many people
are not eating — not because they
choose to, but because they cannot."
Sophomore Sabir Muhammad
agreed with Haddara's statements.
The fast "brings you closer to hu
manity" as well as "closer to God,"
he said.
Because of the time of year dur
ing which Ramadan falls this year,
the fasting is "not so bad," said
Muhammad. When Ramadan
comes during the winter, there are
fewer than 12 hours of sunlight.
