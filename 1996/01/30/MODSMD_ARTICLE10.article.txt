# Chirac ends nuclear testing

PARIS (AP) - President
Jacques Chirac ordered an early end
yesterday to underground nuclear
tests in the South Pacific, saying
they had achieved their objective â€”
giving France a "viable and modern
defense."
The last experimental blast, by
far the most powerful since the
series of explosions began last sum
mer, was detonated Saturday. Two
days later, Chirac, denounced
across the world for months, said he
was calling "a definitive halt to
French nuclear tests."
"I know that the decision that I
made last June may have provoked,
in France and abroad, anxiety and
emotion," Chirac said on state-run
television yesterday night. "I know
that nuclear weaponry may cause
fear. But in an alwavs-dangerous

world, it acts for us as a weapon of
dissuasion, a weapon in the service
of peace."
France began the tests with a
Sept. 5 blast beneath Mururoa
Atoll. That detonation, roughly the
size of the atomic bomb dropped on
Hiroshima in 1945, broke a three
year international moratorium on
nuclear testing.
It made France the only nation
besides China to test weapons of
mass destruction since 1992.
France insisted it had to resume the
tests to check its nuclear arsenal
and develop computer simulation
that will make actual detonations
unnecessary in the future.
The testing outraged Australia,
New Zealand and other South
Pacific countries and provoked riot
ing in Tahiti. But it did not elicit

strong response from such mayor
French allies as the United States,
Britain and Germany.
The environmental group
Greenpeace, which fought the tests
with bitter denouncements and
high-seas protests, expressed relief
at Chirac's decision.
Chirac was probably anxious to
settle the issue before leaving for
the United States on Thursday, and
he is also eager to repair damaged
relations with the nations of the
South Pacific.
Chirac announced last June that
France would conduct up to eight
such underground tests, then stop
for good and sign the Comprehen
sive Test Ban Treaty. Late last year,
he said the tests would end by
March and would number six or
seven.
