WITH POMP AND fanfare
befitting a world leader or
national hero, Bill Gates,
the chairman and co-founder of
Microsoft, has come today to chris
ten the new $38 million computer
science building which bears his
name. But while his donation of $6
million is sizable, Stanford should
also make 1 an effort to recognize the
other donors who made the project
possible.
Gates' contribution to the huild
ing was the largest single donation
and without his help, the project
might not have been as successful.
Having a big name to rally around
helps when trying to get other indi
viduals and corporations to give.
Even so, however, Gates can only
claim partial credit for the success
ful completion of the project.
The publicity surrounding the
christening raises some questions
— the first of which concerns the
level of excitement expressed bv

Stanford administrators over the
opening of a single building. Among
the other major donors were the
Fujitsu and Intel corporations.
Would the University have been this
high-key if the building had been
named the Fujitsu Information Sci
ences Building?
Perhaps the most disturbing
matter is not that other donors have
been overlooked, but that Stanford
has bent over backwards to make
sure that the speaking engagements
with Gates today receive maximum
exposure. Organizers have limited
admission to the opening ceremony
and given the event publicity and
hype that could rival the Superbowl.
Others gave millions too, and like
the credits which roll by at the end
of a movie, the University should
also mention the names of other
donors next to the main attraction
when touting the opening of a major
new building.
