# Dean does deeds

Accessibility has rarely
been a hallmark of Stanford
administrators. However, in
his first year on the job, Dean of
Students Marc Wais has already
achieved an impressive record for
reaching out and listening to stu
dents. Wais has not only made his
office more accessible and less
intimidating by establishing
"office hours" for students to meet
with him on an informal basis, but
he is also creating needed links to
the campus community and
becoming more responsive to the
needs of the student population.
Wais did not have much of a
"honeymoon" period. Almost imme
diately after he took office, the prob
lems with the Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity housing situation forced
Wais to hit the ground running. Ini
tially, he was criticized for acting
prematurely and perhaps a bit
overzealously, especially given the
circumstances he was placed in and
the limited knowledge he had at the

time. However, W r ais was not afraid
to reassess the situation and gave
the Delts more time to present their
side of the case.
Wais has instituted a wide vari
ety of outreach programs trying to
make student services from the
ethnic centers and the Lesbian Gay
and Bisexual Community Center
to Tresidder Union more respon
sive and pertinent to student
needs. He started a system of chan
nels for feedback and plans, r t,y pro
duce a report on his efforts
year.
In addition, Wais is trying to
respond to concerns that the
administration is not open enough
by scheduling University President
Gerhard Casper for a open-house
discussion with students early in
March.
"Building bridges in the com
munity and breaking down the
culture of us versus them" is and
will hopefully remain Wais' philos
ophy for his term.
