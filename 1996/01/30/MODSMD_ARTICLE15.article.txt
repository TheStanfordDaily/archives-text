## Having an Asian fetish 
### 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN especially
attracted to Asian women. Two years
ago, if you asked me why I had an
Asian fetish, I would first deny it, then
excuse it via a quagmire of cultural rea
soning. I had seen so many Jewish
male / Asian female relationships, 1 knew
that there must be some kind of histori
cal synergy between the two groups.
Yeah, that's it. Both our cultures are
very education-oriented, family-oriented
and success-oriented. Both cultures have
faced oppression and both cultures have
overcome it.
Yeah, that must be it.
Then last year, I talked with a Jewish
friend of mine whose Asian fetish is even
more pronounced than mine. He dis
missed my reasoning and went on to
assert that the root of his preference was
quite simple — he liked the way Asians
looked.
Bull's-eye. That was it. I guess being
at Stanford made me think that I was a
much more complicated individual than I
actually am. When you get right down to
it, the first reason wo are attracted to
anybody is because we like tin* way he or
she looks. When I see a cute female, I
don't ponder her cultural roots, nor do I
weigh her ethnic background. She could
be from Mars for all I care — if she's
attractive, I'll probably be attracted to
her.
Before I incite a letter-writing cam
paign, let me just clarify a few things. By
fetish, I don't mean the dictionary mean

ing of "a thing abnormally stimulating or
attracting sexual desire." I am merely
saying that I am broadly more attracted
to Asians than to people of other races.
By this definition, most people, in fact,
have some kind of fetish. I know a girl
who has a strong black fetish, while
another friend of mine has a white,
blonde fetish.
And then, to my dismay, many Asian
girls have Asian-guy fetishes.
Oh well.
No one should be embarrassed about
having a particular preference. As long
as your fetish is not rooted in a racial
stereotype, there's nothing wrong with
it. There is no difference between an
Asian male who prefers the look of
Asian females and a Jewish male who
feels the same way. Both have an Asian
fetish despite the fact that the Asian's
preference is somehow seen as more
normal.
Imagine an African-American male
saying, "I prefer the look of a black
woman. I'm more attracted to African-
American women than women of other
races." This image evokes positive feel
ings in us — a "Good for him!" response.
Now take the same exact quote and
attribute it to a white male. How does it
sound now? Weird? Unusual? Unaccept
able? Should the race of the speaker
change our reaction to what was said?
It's hard to say when my Asian fetish
took form. I've had so many crushes in
mv life, I can't even remotely remember

them all. One girl, whom I knew for less
than a year in the fourth grade, sticks out
in my mind. She was nice, friendly, lived
about 10 houses down from me and was
Asian. At that age, I didn't even know
what Asian meant, much less that I was
at the first stage of a long-term fetish. Of
the 20 or so girls in my fourth-grade
class, many were prettier and many were
more popular than this one girl. But she
was the one I liked.
So why do so many Jewish guys have
Asian-girl fetishes? I'm not going to do
the math on this one, but the phe
nomenon can't be ascribed to mere coin
cidence. I used to joke with an Asian
friend of mine, advising her to drop by
the next Hillel gathering if she ever got
lovesick. In answering why, you can't
point to mass culture because Asian
females are noticeably underrepresented
in advertisements, modeling, television,
etc. Perhaps some common quirk in our
genetic makeup is the answer. Perhaps
many Jews share the same chromosomal
organization that determines everyone's
particular preference.
Perhaps it's the hair, the skin, the
eyes.
Yeah, that's probably it.

Mr. Small's last column is dedicated to
anyone who agrees with him.
