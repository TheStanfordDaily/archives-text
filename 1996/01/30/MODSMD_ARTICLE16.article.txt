COP responds to charge of ineffectiveness

THE DAILY, LOOKING for some
thing to criticize, happened to
focus its fleeting attention on a
class being coordinated by the Council of
Presidents this winter. As members of
the Council of Presidents, perhaps we
haven't made clear why we consider Edu
cation 180: "Student Governance and the
Multicultural University" an important
initiative — it has a lot to do with history.
The course has several components
which demonstrate the need for the
course as well as the value of the issues
which the class engages. Readings
include ASSU and University documents
which are not normally accessible to the
average Stanford student, such as text
from the University Committee on
Minority Issues and the 1994 Report on
the Recruitment and Retention of Grad
uate Students. Exercises and thought
papers are integral to the course because
they allow students to connect their per
sonal experience and skills to historical
and contemporary accounts on the topic
of student activism.
The project, which The Daily criti
cized as being an exploitative tool, gives
students the opportunity to explore stu
dent-University issues in depth, with the
freedom to use creative and innovative
approaches to problem-solving.
Providing these opportunities to
studv and research student activism,

governance and the multicultural con
text within a formal academic arena
serves to attract those students who
would like to explore issues without the
constraints of traditional institutional
approaches. Most students who engage
in the work of the ASSU are rarely ever
recognized. For the eight students cur
rently enrolled, we have been able to
obtain two units — even though for
some of them, the amount of time they
spend on these projects will be worth
many more. This is invaluable because it
gives students an opportunity to pursue
issues they care about with the full sup
port, resources and experience of the
current Council of Presidents behind
them. By offering units, we can attract
to the ASSU students not normally
involved in student government.
"Student Governance" Ls actually part
of a tradition at Stanford that we are try
ing to revive and give legitimacy to. This
course is simply the most recent and pub
lic of a series of student-initiated courses
dating back to the 19605. At Stanford,
these efforts on the part of students to
give relevance to their coursework and to
explore new intellectual territory have
had several different manifestations rang
ing from individually designed directed
readings to a University-sponsored pro
gram encouraging student intellectual ini
tiative that met its demise in the early

19905. In fact, in the 19605, when stu
dents felt they had a strong right to con
trol the nature of their education, the
ASSU actually allocated funds for the pay
ment of an ASSU professorship.
"Student Governance" is also part of
a movement to encourage the integra
tion of coursework and experiential pub
lie service. This movement, called study
service or service-learning, recognizes
the value a formal education can con
tribute to social needs and issues and
attempts to combine formal and experi
ential learning in such a way as to serve
the community. Through this particular
methodology, we hope to enrich the ser
vice experience with formal reflection
and analysis and empower the class
room experience with actual field work.
In this case, Stanford University is the
community which this course is meant
to serve.
And perhaps most pragmatically,
through this course, we have been able
to compile an ongoing history of the
ASSU dating back to the 19505. By ana
lyzing the past, we hope to be better pre
pared to affect the future and to prepare
future generations of ASSU representa
tives to build on the achievements of the
past. The political side of the ASSU, not
having the benefit of a structured sys
tem of turnover enjoyed by the financial
offices, is very prone to setbacks due to

process mistakes and a lack of institu
tional memory. An effort such as this
that documents the past and points to
the future, we feel, can go a long way in
addressing this problem.
In the end, "Student Governance"
has a lot to offer the University. If all it
does is encourage students to be more
active in the development of intellectual
experiences they will have at Stanford,
support the effort to integrate service
and learning, contribute to the institu
tional memory of the ASSU and make
the ASSU accessible to more students,
then we're satisfied. If The Daily is not
satisfied, perhaps it should pay more
attention to the other COP initiatives
which the work involved in putting
together the course complements, such
as the course guide, financial-aid aware
ness week, the tax-counseling service,
special-fee reform, the
campus polls and the teaching awards.
Teaching is doing, and anyone who
challenges that needs to look critically at
the role and definition of activism, espe
cially within the context of an education
ally based environment and institution.
It has always been there.
