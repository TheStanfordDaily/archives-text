## The
						Honor Code is not yet uniformly enforced 
### 
THE HONOR CODE of our University is truly
the force which forms the student. As students,
it is our responsibility to uphold the code and
earn respect from faculty and the administration. It is
incumbent on the student not to "cheat" and at least
to admit to "cheating" if confronted.
Currently, though, execution of the code falls into
the hands of professors and the Judicial Affairs Office
— parties whose consistency in enforcement has been
lacking. To demonstrate my point, I will illustrate
three types of enforcers, supported by true examples.
• There's the "quick-to-the-gun professor" who,
rather than investigating the situation on his own,
almost immediately sends his suspicions to Judicial
Affairs, ignoring the fact that the Honor Code calls on
"all members of the community to prevent and deter
violations rather than on proceedings to impose
penalties after violations have occurred."
In one case, a student was not even informed of the
proceeding investigation by Judicial Affairs. The pro
fessor never confronted him with his suspicions. The
behind-the-back inquiry shocked the student because
he was neither guilty of wrongdoing nor even aware

his professor suspected him of "cheating." Funda
mentally, the success of the Honor Code rests on the
behavior of professors: "The faculty also should be
ready and willing to consult with students."
• The "perfect professor" is one who investigates
adequately any violations he may suspect through
interviews with teaching assistants and the accused
before deciding whether to pass the situation on to
Judicial Affairs. This type of professor has realized
that "for making the Code effective . . . faculty coop
eration is essential."
In one case, a professor met with each of the
accused students individually, informing them fully of
his suspicions and asking for possible explanations of
the suspected violation. He then met with all the TAs
involved to correlate the explanation of the accused
and to develop a complete understanding of the inci
dent. Basically, the professor gathered all the neces
sary information to make an intelligent and fair deci
sion. This case was solved at the professor-student
level because the professor lived up to the responsibil
ity of his role in the code.
• The "cheating professor" is the most serious. A

professor in the School of Engineering gave out a
take-home final — a perfectly acceptable action. How
ever, the final was timed, violating "procedures which
place honorable and conscientious students at a dis
advantage." This professor, though unaware of his
wrongdoing, was not doing his fair share "to minimize
inducements to dishonesty." He failed to remember
that "if take-home examinations are given, they
should not be closed-book examinations, nor should
there be a specified time limit less than the full period
between the distribution of the examination and its
due date."
Obviously, I do not believe professors should be
suspended for breaking the code. However, there are
radical inconsistencies in the implementation of the
student-professor agreement. I wish the code could be
followed in the consistent and proper manner of the
"perfect professor." My critics will probably draw my
attention to the Judicial Affairs Office — the body
charged with the fair investigation and implementa
tion of Stanford's Honor Code.
Yes, we are privileged to have a Supreme Court of
sorts (in comparison to individual professors). But is

this theoretically good set-up actually succeeding in
practice? I assume Judicial Affairs oversees a fair and
open process of deciding whether an accused student
is guilty of breaking the code. However, the entire
process of Judicial Affairs seems ambiguous and
secretive. Furthermore, I do not truly believe that
those on the receiving end of the process are ade
quately informed of the system either.
The University is ignoring the dutiful explanation
of an important process in hopes that students will
never have to experience it. Unfortunately, students
are not angels and many are also inaccurately
accused. Students are forced onto the field of Judi
cial Affairs, but most do not know the rules of the
game.
I do not want the preceding observations (all based
on true events) to bo considered simply negative,
angry criticism of the Honor Code and its implemen
tation. I only offer my insight, recognizing that my
opinion counts only because the Honor Code has ele
vated a student's voice to a respectable level.
