# Professors must spell out assignment guidelines
## 
### 
IN A 1980 survey of Stanford undergraduates, 10
percent of the respondents said that, while they
had been at Stanford, they had "collaborated on
an assignment when the instructor required individ
ual work." In a similar survey conducted in the fall of
1995, 30 percent of the Stanford undergraduate
respondents said that they had engaged in unpermit
ted collaboration. Recent research on other campuses
has found many types of cheating unchanged from
earlier years, the dramatic exception being unpermit
ted collaboration where the increase is three-fold or
more.
Attitudes toward collaborative work have also
changed. The work world increasingly requires and
rewards good teamwork, and employers look to col
leges and universities to expose students to the skills
involved in effective collaborative learning. Most peo

ple learn best in group settings where problem
approaches are debated and applications and solu
tions are compared. The student who knows the ter
minology does the write-up, the math whiz does the
calculations, the potent ial English teacher proofreads
the resulting text, and the group member with wheels
gets the assignment in on time.
What's wrong with this picture? What if the
assignment guideline says, "You may discuss the
assignment in a general way with other students, but
your write-up must be done independently?" If this
were indeed the guideline, the teamwork described
above would have been in violation of the Honor
Code. If the assignment done collectively had been
submitted as the individual work of the group mem
bers, it would have been fundamentally dishonest.
In recent years, approximately one-third of the

Honor Code problems reported to the Judicial AfTairs
Office involve unpermitted collaboration. Sometimes,
the assignment guideline prohibits any discussion at
all. More often, the guideline allows some discussion
but also requires some individual work. The instruc
tors and teaching assistants are clear about the
boundary between permitted and unpermitted collab
oration; unfortunately, the students are often less
clear about where the line is drawn — or they draw
the line in a different place. The group discussion isn't
as general as the teaching staff would like; or the one
student who really understands the material talks
about the assignment while the others take detailed
notes before going off to do their "individual" write
ups; or after general discussion and individual write
ups, the students compare their answers and recon
cile any discrepancies.

Look around the Stanford curriculum and multi
ply this problem by the number of different assign
ments, courses and instructors, and it's no wonder
that an increasing number of students admit to
"unpermitted collaboration" on anonymous surveys!
The real number must be many, many times higher
and is destined to continue increasing until some clar
ity and order prevail over the current confusion.
The extremes are clear to everyone: total collabo
ration, where the names of the group are listed on the
assignment, and total individual work submitted
under one name. The large gray area in between,
where some collaboration is allowed but assignments
are submitted under individual names, is problematic
and should be avoided. Here are some suggestions for
faculty who wish to encourage dis
cussion but also assess individual
maste, of material:
1. Use the extremes. Allow com
plete collaboration on some work,
no collaboration on other work.
Within an assignment, allow col
laboration on half of the questions
and individual work on the other
half.
'?. Require students to identify
the people with whom they worked
or from whom they received ideas
and assistance.
3. Discuss the policy on collabo
ration and its rationale at the

beginning of each course or assign
ment and urge students to seek
clarification if they are unsure
about the guideline.
4. If the guideline allows some
but not total collaboration, give
specific examples of what is and is
not permitted.
5. Raise the topic of collabora
tive student work at department
meetings and meetings of the Fac
ulty Senate. Ask the Student Con
duct Legislative Council to develop
a University-wide statement on
the topic.
Students can and should help in
this endeavor. Ask questions, seek
clarification and examples and
make suggestions for alternative
approaches. Many of your faculty
are grappling with a fundamental

dilemma: how to encourage collab
orative work, on the one hand, and
how to assess individual achieve
ment and record individual grades
on the other.
These are legitimate and impor
tant goals — too important to be
lost in the current confusion and
debate about where the line is
drawn between permitted and
unpermitted collaboration. We're
mixing educational and ethical
issues to the benefit of no one. The
educational goals and require
ments need to be clarified before
the ethical goals and requirements
of the Honor Code can be effective
ly addressed.
