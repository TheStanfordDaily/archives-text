# Czech athletes feel let down by Stanford
## 
### David Stein Contributing writer 
For Victor Ireland and the two
youth soccer teams he brought
from the Czech Republic to train at
Stanford, the fields aren't always
greener on t he other side.
Although Ireland, president of
World Soccer Inc. — a company
which conducts professional com
munity coaching year round in the
Bay Area — agreed in December on
a verbal commitment to pay $5,000
to the University for use of Mal
oney Soccer Field, he was notified
five days before the teams' arrival
that they would not be able to play

on their intended site.
"I hit the roof. I went ballistic,"
Ireland said.
Ireland explained that the two
teams, comprised of 1(S- to 18-year
olds who are already contracted to
professional teams, were offered
the adjacent football training fields
for practice. But then, last Wednes
day, they were told that rain had
made the fields unplayable and
they would have no fields at all.
However, upon arriving at Stan
ford, Ireland said that the women's
lacrosse team was practicing on (he
fields they thought were unavail
able. This came as a "complete sur
prise" to him, he said, especially

after he was not offered any alter
natives.
"When we made the deal for the
training facility, there was not be
lieved to be a problem," Ireland
said. "Nobody mentioned rain in
terfering with us getting a field."
In defense of Stanford's deci
sion, Assoc. Athletic Director Va
lerie Veronin said "the soccer peo
ple were very clear with what the
Czech teams could and could not
do."
Veronin also said she thought
the lacrosse teams were practicing
on the intramural fields, northwest
of Maloney.
In a memo sent from the Athlet

ic Department to World Soccer on
Jan. 16, it was stated that "in light
of recent weather.. . the Stanford
Men's Soccer program reserves the
right to cancel field use and / or re
assign fields."
Ireland counters t hat t his clause
was "absolutely not" part of the de
cision reached during a "friendly"
talk between his son, Gary, and the
men's soccer assistant coaches
when the verbal agreement was
made.
While there is talk that a partial
refund may be given to World
Soccer, Ireland siiid money is not
their main concern. The University
had been paid prior to its decision
preventing World Soccer from
using the fields.
"We are embarrassed for Stan
ford," Ireland said. "What does this
say about Stanford's spirit and com
mitment to international rela
tions?"
Ireland said the Czechs, who
spent almost $200,000 to fly out
and practice in California, were dis
appointed by the limitations in
training time they had to endure. In
addition, he said it was a shame that
"people coming to the United States
for the first time had to go through
so much bureaucratic red tape."
