## Men's spikers out for blood tonight against the Tigers 
### Ed Guzman Contributing writer 
The fourth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team opens
Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation play today with a 7 p.m.
match against league-rival
Pacific at Stockton. After
knocking off UC-Santa Cruz in
three games and California in
four to go along with their fifth
place finish at the UC-Santa
Barbara Tournament, the Car
dinal spikers hope to continue
their success against the Tigers
and return to first place in the
Pacific Division.
Last season, coach Ruben
Nieves' squad beat Pacific twice
on its way to a 14-5 conference
record, placing Stanford second
to top-ranked Hawaii. However,
Nieves warns that the Tigers
should prove better than they
were last season.
"We saw them at the Santa
Barbara tournament, where
they finished ninth," Nieves
said. "They boat Loyola Mary
mount in their final match, and
[Loyola) gave us a real tough
match." Apart from the Santa
Barbara event, Pacific has
matched up against UC-Santa
Cruz and Cal State-San
Bernardino, garnering victories
on both occasions. Fourth-year
coach Joe Wortman now looks
to improve on last season's 3-16
conference record.

The return of many key play
ers from a year ago contributed
to Pacific's quick start. The
Tigers are led by 6-foot-8 junior
opposite hitter Greg Wakeham,
who carries a big hitting load for
the Tigers. "At times, he can be
unstoppable," Nieves said. "If
he gets going and gets hot, he
can make life miserable for us."
Another important player for
Pacific is senior Russell Gahn, a
three-year veteran setter.
Despite his smallish six-foot
frame, he brings experience and
poise to the Tigers as well as a
dynamic flair for running the
offense.
Newcomers for Pacific
include 6-8 sophomore German
import Martin Berkenkamp. As
a middle blocker, German pro
vides a formidable presence up
front that could pose trouble for
the Cardinal spikers.
"This Berkenkamp guy pre
sents us with a challenge,"
Nieves said. "Neither opponent
[we played 1 had this big a guy.
This gives them a stronger,
quicker attack, and we'll also
see a bigger block."
Stanford will counter with its
three-blocker attack, spear
headed by junior middle block
ers Mike Hoefer and Brian
Moore. Meanwhile, junior setter
Stewart Chong will direct the
offense.
Nieves also expects junior
Ail-American opposite hitter
Matt Fuerbringer to bounce
back in the league opener after
his poor performance against
California. Despite his 15 kills,
Fuerbringer only registered a
.043 hitting percentage.
"This guy is a two-time All-
American, " Nieves said. "He's
a proven quantity — a gamer.
The more pressure in a game,
the better he tends to perform.
He's had a few bad matches,
but lie's always bounced back."
Should Fuerbringer come
through, he will spread Pacif
ic's defense. The Tigers won't
key on the middle of the court
to stop Stanford's middle
blockers.
"It would be nice if we don't
rely on our quick hitters as
much and have the outside hit
ters carry a little of the load,"
Nieves said. "We did some
things (Sunday) to try to
spread the opponent's blocks.
It's not something different,
but we hope to do better [than
we did in the Cal match!."
