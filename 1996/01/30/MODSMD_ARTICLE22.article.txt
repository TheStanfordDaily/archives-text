# No. 2 baseball takes series in Hawaii
## Cardinal drops the opener, bounces back to take next two 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
In Hawaii, aloha means hello.
Last Friday night, the second

ranked Stanford baseball team
received a less-than-friendly
island greeting from the Hawaii
Rainbows, dropping its season
opener 11-1.

But aloha also means good-bye,
and the Cardinal bid farewell to
Hawaii by capturing the final two
games of the weekend series to
return home with a 2-1 record.

In game one, the Rainbows out
played the Cardinal in every phase
of the game, as Stanford's starting
pitcher Kyle Peterson (0-1) fell
victim to a surprisingly sharp
Rainbow lineup. Hawaii put runs
on the board in each of the first
three innings to take a 5-0 lead
and then added two in the fifth
and four runs in the sixth to put
the game out of Stanford's reach.
The Cardinal offered little
resistance against Rainbow ace
Mark Johnson, who allowed one
unearned run on just four hits,
none of them for extra bases.
"They just killed us," said
Stanford skipper Mark Marquess.
"We didn't do much offensively —
Johnson killed us. He's a really
good pitcher."
Senior catcher A.J. Hinch
agreed with his coach. "He domi
nated us," Hinch said of Johnson.
"We came out timid Friday night,
which is very out of character for
this team. Every part of our game
broke down and nothing seemed
to work. We got beat soundly, but
it was a wake-up call."
The lopsided loss may indeed
have been a blessing in disguise
for the highly-touted Stanford
squad, as the Cardinal came out
of the gates hitting on all cylin
ders in Saturday afternoon's con
frontation.
Stanford routed the Rainl>ows
16-0 behind 19 hits, seven of which
were for extra bases. Senior out
fielder Cale Carter and sophomore
designated hitter Jon SchaefTer led
the offensive explosion with three
hits apiece. Senior second base
man Brian Dallimore collected a
career-high five runs-batted-in.
