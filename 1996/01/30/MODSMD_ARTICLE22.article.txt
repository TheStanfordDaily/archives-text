# No. 2 baseball takes series in Hawaii
## Cardinal drops the opener, bounces back to take next two 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
In Hawaii, aloha means hello.
Last Friday night, the second

ranked Stanford baseball team
received a less-than-friendly
island greeting from the Hawaii
Rainbows, dropping its season
opener 11-1.

But aloha also means good-bye,
and the Cardinal bid farewell to
Hawaii by capturing the final two
games of the weekend series to
return home with a 2-1 record.

In game one, the Rainbows out
played the Cardinal in every phase
of the game, as Stanford's starting
pitcher Kyle Peterson (0-1) fell
victim to a surprisingly sharp
Rainbow lineup. Hawaii put runs
on the board in each of the first
three innings to take a 5-0 lead
and then added two in the fifth
and four runs in the sixth to put
the game out of Stanford's reach.
The Cardinal offered little
resistance against Rainbow ace
Mark Johnson, who allowed one
unearned run on just four hits,
none of them for extra bases.
"They just killed us," said
Stanford skipper Mark Marquess.
"We didn't do much offensively —
Johnson killed us. He's a really
good pitcher."
Senior catcher A.J. Hinch
agreed with his coach. "He domi
nated us," Hinch said of Johnson.
"We came out timid Friday night,
which is very out of character for
this team. Every part of our game
broke down and nothing seemed
to work. We got beat soundly, but
it was a wake-up call."
The lopsided loss may indeed
have been a blessing in disguise
for the highly-touted Stanford
squad, as the Cardinal came out
of the gates hitting on all cylin
ders in Saturday afternoon's con
frontation.
Stanford routed the Rainl>ows
16-0 behind 19 hits, seven of which
were for extra bases. Senior out
fielder Cale Carter and sophomore
designated hitter Jon SchaefTer led
the offensive explosion with three
hits apiece. Senior second base
man Brian Dallimore collected a
career-high five runs-batted-in.

Stanford baseball connected for two wins in three games in its series against the Rainbows last week
end.
While the Cardinal batters
rested from rounding the bases,
junior Jason Middlebrook (1-0)
and freshman Jeff Austin kept
Hawaii off the scoreboard, com
bining on the season's first
shutout for Stanford's highly
regarded pitching staff.
Middlebrook, returning from
an injury-plagued 1995, threw
five strong innings and allowed
just two hits.
"[Middlebrook! looked great,
especially considering he hasn't
competed since March of last
year," Marquess said. "He had
good control and a great breaking
ball. He was throwing hard, but I
think he'll throw harder each
time out. He should get stronger
as the season goes on."
Making his first collegiate
appearance, Austin picked up
right where Middlebrook left off,
keeping the Rainbow bats silent.
Austin struck out eight in four
scoreless innings of work.
"I'm sure he was nervous,
being a freshman, but Jeff
showed what type of pitcher he
will be in the college game,"
Hinch said. "He threw hard and
showed a good breaking ball with

no problems getting it over the
plate."
Austin admitted to feeling jit
ters, but said the situation
allowed him to remain confident.
"It was nice to enter a game with
an 11-0 cushion," he said. "I have
to give credit to the hitters for
putting up runs and to Jason
Middlebrook for shutting them
down up to that point."
After trading blowout victories
in the first two games, Hawaii and
Stanford played a close contest on
Sunday, with the Cardinal regis
tering the win by a score of 5-3.
The Rainbows got on the board
early, taking advantage of Stan
ford starting pitcher Mario Igle
sias for three runs in the first
three innings. However, reliever
Tom Reimers (1-0) stifled
Hawaii's bats over the final six
innings, notching nine strikeouts
without surrendering a single run
to pick up the win.
"I just wanted to keep things
close," Reimers said. "I wanted to
keep them from scoring because I
knew we'd get some runs."
Hinch and the rest of the Car
dinal batsmen appreciated the
chance.
"Tom was awesome," Hinch
said. "He had all four pitches
going and had good control. He
gave us the opportunity to come
from behind and win."

Reimers attributed his success
to the good locations of his pitch
es and the Rainbows' inability to
put the bat on the ball.
"I wasn't trying to do anything
special," Reimers said of his
career-high strikeout total. "They
were missing my pitches. My con
trol enabled me to dictate to the
hitters what they were going to do
with the ball."
The tight game allowed Stan
ford to show off all the attributes
which led to its high spot in the
national rankings. The Cardinal
used power, in the form of home
runs by freshman center fielder
Jody Gerut and Hinch, and smart
base'-running (seven stolen
bases) to put runs on the board.
"On Friday, we had no oppor
tunities," Hinch said. "When you
fall behind early, it limits what
you can do. On Sunday, we had a
chance to do some things in the
close game. The power and the
base-running will help us develop
a reputation — it will put fear
into opponents."
Despite the opening-game loss,
Hinch and the Cardinal were
happy to say aloha to the islands
in style.
"Hopefully, we got all our
nerves out," Hinch said. "Sunday
was a true team win. We had the
home runs and big hits. It was an
all-around team effort."
