## Women's epee squad goes undefeated in Pennsylvania 
### Laura Drum Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's and
women's fencing teams per
formed solidly in Pennsylvania
at their season openers this past
weekend, highlighted by a bril
liant undefeated performance by
the women's epee squad. Other
impressive showings came from
the men's team, which defeated
North Carolina and Duke for
the first time in Cardinal fenc
ing history.
The Stanford teams first
traveled to Philadelphia and
then to State College to face
some of the nation's best fenc
ing squads. In two intense days,
the Cardinal dueled eight
schools, including No. 1 Penn
State, No. 2 St. Johns and North
Carolina, Duke and Rutgers,
which are all among the nation's
top 10.
A total of 17 fencers repre
sented the Cardinal in the tour
naments. The men's team sent
saber, epee and foil squads, each
with three members, while the

women sent four-membered
epee and foil squads. Overall,
Stanford fencers felt they per
formed remarkably well.
"We had a couple of unprece
dented things," said senior
men's fencer Krrol Hunter,
referring in part to the astound
ing performance of the women's
epee team.
Women's epee went undefeat
ed, capturing a total of eight
matches in Pennsylvania,
including one against Penn
State. The victory was a mile
stone in Stanford fencing — it
was the first time the Cardinal
beat the Nittany Lions.
"[Women's epeel tore every
body apart," said women's head
coach Sherry Posthumus.
Stephanie Wien, senior
women's epee fencer and team
captain, credited the experience
of the squad for its success.
Women's epee boasts two
seniors as well as experienced
freshmen and sophomores.
"We're happy with how we did,"
Wien said. "I think it was a suc
cessful trio."

The men's team also proved
formidable with victories over
the Tar Heels and Blue Devils.
In all, men's epee finished with
six wins and one loss. Men's foil
compiled a 5-2 record, while
men's saber went 4-3.
The women's foil team fell
short of its hopes at 2-6, but the
youth and inexperience of the
squad still leaves hope for the
future.
The youth of men's epee,
with three freshmen, and men's
foil, with two freshmen and one
sophomore, also promises many
years of strong Stanford fenc
ing.
"They have the potential to
make the NCAA finals next
year, especially with how far
they've already gone," Posthu
mus said.
Most importantly for the Car
dinal fencing teams, the trip
East prepared them for the
NCAA regional qualifiers, which
will take place March 2-3.
"We're looking to maintain
our reputation as a powerhouse
this year," Hunter said.
