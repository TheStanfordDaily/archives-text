### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's tennis
team completed a clean sweep of
Washington and Hawaii last
weekend in its first dual matches
of the 1996 season. The Cardinal,
now 3-0 in dual-match competi
tion, defeated the Washington
Huskies 8-1 on Friday before fin
ishing off the Rainbows of Hawaii
8-1 on Sunday.
Stanford sophomore Julie
Scott spearheaded the Cardinal
onslaught, continuing to domi
nate her opponents. After regis
tering tremendous wins in the
Pacific 10 Conference Indoor
Championships a week ago, Scott
followed up her act with near
flawless play against Washington.
Scott faced Kari Luna and won 6-
0, 6-0 as Stanford's No 4 singles
player. Scott also teamed with
senior Wendy Sacks in doubles to
battle Lindy Irving and Karen
Costi, whom Scott and Sacks
defeated 6-1, 6-3.
The rest of the Huskies could
fair no better than Costi and Irv
ing, as Washington managed to
capture only one match. The
team of Katherine Costain and
Kori Sosnowy upset Stanford's
No. 1 doubles team of sophomore
Ania Bleszynski and junior Katie
Schlukebir.
