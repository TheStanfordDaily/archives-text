# Women's tennis shakes off injury
## Cardinal takes every match except No. 1 doubles 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's tennis
team completed a clean sweep of
Washington and Hawaii last
weekend in its first dual matches
of the 1996 season. The Cardinal,
now 3-0 in dual-match competi
tion, defeated the Washington
Huskies 8-1 on Friday before fin
ishing off the Rainbows of Hawaii
8-1 on Sunday.
Stanford sophomore Julie
Scott spearheaded the Cardinal
onslaught, continuing to domi
nate her opponents. After regis
tering tremendous wins in the
Pacific 10 Conference Indoor
Championships a week ago, Scott
followed up her act with near
flawless play against Washington.
Scott faced Kari Luna and won 6-
0, 6-0 as Stanford's No 4 singles
player. Scott also teamed with
senior Wendy Sacks in doubles to
battle Lindy Irving and Karen
Costi, whom Scott and Sacks
defeated 6-1, 6-3.
The rest of the Huskies could
fair no better than Costi and Irv
ing, as Washington managed to
capture only one match. The
team of Katherine Costain and
Kori Sosnowy upset Stanford's
No. 1 doubles team of sophomore
Ania Bleszynski and junior Katie
Schlukebir.

Sophomore Ania Bleszynski secures a Cardinal victory in the No. 1
singles position.
Costain and Sosnowy found
themselves ahead after winning a
grueling tie-breaker in the first
set 8-6, but Bleszynski and
Schlukebir fought back in the
second set. The Stanford tandem
led 5-4 when rain postponed the
match. After a brief hiatus, play
resumed, and Bleszynski and
Schlukebir took the second set 6-
4.
However, although Bleszynski
and Schlukebir jumped ahead 3-2
in the final set, they eventually
fell 6-3. Nevertheless, the out
come did not affect the dual
match since Stanford had won
the previous eight matches of the
day.
In singles action, No. 1
Bleszynski and No. 2 Schlukebir
both prevailed. Schlukebir defeat
ed Paige Stringer 6-2, 6-1 while
Bleszynski blasted Costain 6-2, 6-
4.
Junior Sandra De Silva defeat
ed Sosnowy in the No. 3 slot 6-3,
6-1, while senior Amy Chiminello
and Sacks finished off the No. 5
and No. 6 spots with 6-2, 6-1 and
6-1, 6-0 wins over Erica Stoloff
and Irving respectively. Chiminel
lo also teamed with junior Emily

Burt in the No. 2 doubles spot and
won 6-1, 6-2.
The pairing of Chiminello and
Burt has found unexpected suc
cess thie season. Chiminello
matched with Burt after Burt's
usual partner, senior Beth Berris,
sustained a wrist injury.
Nonetheless, not only has the
new pair won major matches at
the Pac-10 Indoor Champi
onships and in this weekend's two
duai matches, but the duo has
done so without dropping a set.
On Sunday, they easily defeated
Hawaii's Ean Phoumaly and
Petra Turelt 8-2.
Chiminello expects Berris to
return soon, but she noted that
the ability to mix and match part
ners makes for a stronger team.
"It's good for [head coach Frank
Brennan] to see us all playing well
together," she said. "It's a long
season and anything can hap
pen."
Senior Kim Shasby also sat out
last week due to a pulled muscle.
As a result, her longtime partner
Scott has mixed and matched
with other players. Shasby is
recovering and hopes to return to
the Cardinal lineup by next week
end.
The absences in Stanford's
usual lineup meant that some
players received unexpected play
ing time. Sophomore Heidi Stalla

moved into the No. 6 singles posi
tion on Sunday and beat Hawaii's
Alicia Lee 6-0, 6-0. Sacks and
Burt also joined the singles rota
tion, playing in the No. 4 and No
5 spots respectively. Sacks played
Turelt and won 6-2, 6-0, while
Burt defeated Phoumaly 6-1, 6-0.
Bleszynski, Schlukebir and
Chiminello occupied the top three
singles slots. Bleszynski overpow
ered Amy Kusch 6-2, 6-2,
Schlukebir cruised to a 6-1, 6-1
win over Michelle Radman, and
Chiminello crushed Salani Lesa
6-0, 6-0.
Bleszynski and Schlukebir alsc
defeated Kusch and Radman 8-C
in doubles competition — in
approximately 15 minutes. In
other doubles action, Stalla
paired with sophomore Sophy
Woodhouse to face Lesa and
Natalie Messiona. Stalla and
Woodhouse remained competitive
but were unable to prevent Lesa
and Messiona from taking
Hawaii's only win of the day 8-6.
Brennan was pleased with the
outcome of last weekend's match
es although Hawaii was missing
some of its top players because of
injury and illness. "We stayed
focused pretty well and did a good
job," he said. "Each match gets ii
little more difficult and a little
