The only thing stopping the
Stanford men's tennis team
these past few days is the weath
er. The excited Cardinal players
were disappointed when Satur
day's scheduled match against
Las Vegas was canceled due to
rain.
However, when the rain let
up, Stanford saw rainbows.
The Hawaii Rainbows came
into town yesterday to play the
No. 1 Cardinal (3-0) for the sec
ond time this year. As it did in
its previous encounter with
Hawaii, Stanford won convinc
ingly, sweeping the match 7-0
and extending its nation-best
win streak to 30.
"It is a long season, and this
is a good way to start," said
assistant coach John
Whitlinger. "We need these
matches because some guys
haven't played in awhile."
"This isn't the best team we
will face, but I was pleased with
the individual efforts today,"
said head coach Dick Gould.
"The guys really came out and
did a good job."
The Cardinal's stellar indi
vidual efforts included a solid
performance by senior captain
Jeff Salzenstein. In the No. 1
singles match, Salzenstein faced
Alex Sugai, a gutsy player from
nearby Milpitas, Calif. Salzen
stein easily captured the first set
6-2 hut struggled in the second,
falling behind 2-4 before pulling
out a 6-4 victory in the end.
"Sugai played very well, and
he is a very hard hitter," Gould
said. "He is a little erratic
though, and Jeff capitalized on
that."
Although Salzenstein admit
ted to playing below his capabil
ities, he was pleased to get

another match under his belt.
"That was a good match to
play," he said. "It will help me
get ready for the matches this

weekend | against Fresno St.and
Minnesota)."

Senior Jeff Salzenstein returned to dual-match action last week
end with a win over his counterpart from Hawaii.
At No. 2 singles, freshman
Ryan Wolters continued his out
standing play and defeated his
opponent 6-1,6-2. In the process,
Wolters, the top-ranked singles
player in collegiate tennis, bol
stered his record to a whopping
24-1. "I hit the ball well today,"
he said. "I still feel good about the
way I'm playing."
As Stanford's No. 3 singles
player, sophomore Paul Goldstein
overpowered his opposition, win
ning 6-2, 6-2 and improved his
record to 11-1 on the year. Senior

-Jim Thomas breezed to a 6-4, 6-1
victory in the No. 4 singles match.
The No. 5 singles court hosted
the tightest match-up of the day.
Junior Grant Elliot needed three
sets to knock off his opponent 6-2,
2-6, 6-1. Finally, in the No. 6 slot,
senior Ricky Pecker prevailed 6-2,
6-3 to complete the Stanford
sweep.
While Gould was pleased with
hid team's singles performances,
he was particularly impressed by
the doubles play. Salzenstein and
Goldstein teamed at No. 1 doubles
and bageled Hawaii's top team 8-
0. "We're really starting to work
together well," Goldstein said.
Wolters and Elliot paired to
win 8-1 as the No. 2 doubles tan

dem, while sophomores Charles
Hoeveler and Misha Palecek oust
ed their adversaries 8-2.
The Cardinal didn't savor its
successful sweep for long, howev
er. "The guys did a really good job
today, but right now, we need to
focus on next weekend's matches
[against Fresno St.and Minneso
ta)," Gould said. "It would have
been nice to have played the
UNLV match. We're trying to
play a lot of matches early in
preparation for the National
Team Indoors Championships
later this month."
The indoor event will take
place Feb. 22-25 in Louisville, Ky.,
and should provide the Cardinal
with formidable competition.
