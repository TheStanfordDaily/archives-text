The only thing stopping the
Stanford men's tennis team
these past few days is the weath
er. The excited Cardinal players
were disappointed when Satur
day's scheduled match against
Las Vegas was canceled due to
rain.
However, when the rain let
up, Stanford saw rainbows.
The Hawaii Rainbows came
into town yesterday to play the
No. 1 Cardinal (3-0) for the sec
ond time this year. As it did in
its previous encounter with
Hawaii, Stanford won convinc
ingly, sweeping the match 7-0
and extending its nation-best
win streak to 30.
"It is a long season, and this
is a good way to start," said
assistant coach John
Whitlinger. "We need these
matches because some guys
haven't played in awhile."
"This isn't the best team we
will face, but I was pleased with
the individual efforts today,"
said head coach Dick Gould.
"The guys really came out and
did a good job."
The Cardinal's stellar indi
vidual efforts included a solid
performance by senior captain
Jeff Salzenstein. In the No. 1
singles match, Salzenstein faced
Alex Sugai, a gutsy player from
nearby Milpitas, Calif. Salzen
stein easily captured the first set
6-2 hut struggled in the second,
falling behind 2-4 before pulling
out a 6-4 victory in the end.
"Sugai played very well, and
he is a very hard hitter," Gould
said. "He is a little erratic
though, and Jeff capitalized on
that."
Although Salzenstein admit
ted to playing below his capabil
ities, he was pleased to get

another match under his belt.
"That was a good match to
play," he said. "It will help me
get ready for the matches this

weekend | against Fresno St.and
Minnesota)."
