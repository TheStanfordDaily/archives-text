# Finally, after all the columns and hours, an editor rediscovers the love
## 
### 
It all began with a confident if not overly arrogant
column entitled "D is for Dallas, Deion,
Dynasty" that marked my editorial debut way
back at the end of September. Now, in the twilight of
my sports editing career here at The Daily, things
have come full circle with the waning days of my
tenure culminating in a predicted, predestined Cow
boy Super Bowl victory.

Yes, it's nice.
But just like the last outs, final buzzers or closing
seconds of any season, even if it were a Super Bowl
one, there comes an irrepressible finality. And while
the Cowboys will have next season to show once
again why they are the best team ever assembled —
even if their performance Sunday against Pitts
burgh were less than overwhelming — never fear,
because next season, they'll get to prove it all again
with undoubtedly a few new twists (star defensive
back Kevin Smith back on the corner, more Deion
on offense, etc.). Even if their season were a bit
unfulfilling — although I can't imagine for the life of
me how a Super Bowl championship season could be
unfulfilling — they have next year.
However, unlike Charles Haley and Magic John
son, my column is retiring for good. And while at


Dan
Kao
times, it was a struggle as well as a
pain, there's a small sense of reluc
tance to give up the reigns. I've chat
ted about many tilings. There was
the plea for college football playoffs,
which proved unnecessary this sea
son but will undoubtedly l>e a neces
sity in the future. I ventured the
query of yet another Buffalo Super
Bowl, which, by the way, definitely
would have happened had All-World
defensive end Bruce Smith not been
bitten by the flu bug.
Then there was the Halloween
State of Stanford Athletics Address,
which looks all the scarier now
because the Cardinal hiis yet to cap
ture a national championship.
Hopefully, that will change a mil
lion-fold by the end of my succes
sors' run.
I also took a quick jaunt through
the wild and wacky world of college
basketball, and my vision has
turned out thus far to be a hit fuzzy
but not altogether myopic. No. 2
Kentucky, despite dropping its first

game after I crowned the Jay hawks
as future champions, has been
strong. Our very own Cardinal has
faltered at times, but what am one
expect with an injury to an All-Pac
-10 center? UCI A has not crumbled
yet, but just wait until the tourna
ment. Arizona has struggled but
held steady, and the Weenies once
again prove to Ix- their namesake
underachieving once again while
possessing the most talent.
Then these last couple of weeks,
with my eye towards the Super
Bowl, I looked into the crystal ball of
both the Jimmy Johnson-led Miami
Dolphins as well as the I )allas (low
boys, These two teams will win at
least three out of the next four
Super Bowls.
Speaking of the future, it appears
as if my time now has come and
gone. Yet, t here is so much left to be
said. I guess because sports is life,
we'll all end up saying that same
thing when our time has come. You
don't get another season in life.
But my column and I are not
quite dead yet. As a matter of' fact,
you can say that a rebirth has
occurred. In a twist of irony, amidst
the ultra-hvped, media-inundated

circus known as the Super Bowl, I
rediscovered what sports is all
about, hut not by watching the
game itself.
I rediscovered it with the snip
pets of hard-nosed Pee Wet; football
in between the live action of million
dollar athletes dancing and taunt
ing. I rediscovered it when 1 was
overcome by a nauseous sensation
watching Heisman Trophy winner
Eddie George, not even signed yet
by an NFL team, shamelessly [x>r
traying "the business of sports" by
hawking Tylenol. I rediscovered it
during halftime when instead of
watching Oscar Myer's flamboyant,
over-glitzed halftime show, I played
some good-old tackle football in the
mud and felt the essence of sports
splattered in dirt all over my lx>dy.
All volume long, I've watched
spoils and written about sports, but
t hat's not what sports is all about.
Sports is about being an active par
ticipator, not a spectator or a com
mentator. It's not a story, business
or drama. You ain't talk, read, write
or watch sports. You have to be
sports.
I've said all along that sports is
life, and now I know it is.
