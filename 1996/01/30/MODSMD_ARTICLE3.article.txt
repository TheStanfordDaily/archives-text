Contrary to what some might think, Stanford po
lice officers are not sheltered from the criminal ele
ments festering beyond the borders of campus.
Two weeks atro. Stanford Police as-

sisted the Palo Alto, Mountain View
and Sunnyvale Police Departments
in searching for the serial rapist,
controlling a gang fight and search
ing for four armed robbers.
"If something heavy is going down,
we help lather police departments!
out," said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. "I can't really say
how often we help them out because

it varies.
On Jan. 13, the Palo Alto Police Department re
quested the aid of Stanford Police in setting up a
perimeter in East Palo Alto to find and catch the
Peninsula serial rapist, Niemeyer said. Stanford Po
lice sent three deputies to search the area and pre
vent the escape of the rapist. Although the rapist was
not found in the attempt, a suspect has now been
charged.
The next day, Palo Alto Police requested assis-

tance from Stanford Police
when a gang fight broke out at
The Edge, a local club, Niemey
er said.
"Shortly after midnight at The
Edge, a humongous gang fight
was going on," Niemeyer said.
"We were basically sent over as
field support. We did not make
any arrests, although several

arrests were made by Palo Alto
police [officers]."
On Jan. 15, Stanford Police
assisted Palo Alto, Mountain
View and Sunnyvale Police in the
search for four armed robbers,
Niemeyer said.
The robbers held up a Safeway
store in Sunnyvale, and Sunny
vale Police responded to the call.
Niemeyer said when police got to
Safeway, the robbers fled the
scene. Police gave chase.
The chase ended near Shore
line Amphitheatre. The four

police departments set up a
perimeter around the amphithe
ater to find and prevent the
escape of the robbers, Niemeyer
said.
Niemeyer said that Stanford
Police also handled calls to the
Palo Alto Police Department
while the search took place.
Niemeyer said that other police
departments generally request
assistance from Stanford Police
when they are short on staff
because their officers are busy
with other matters.
