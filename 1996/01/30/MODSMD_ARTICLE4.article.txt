# Slipping back in sponsored funds
## Increased costs mean fewer grants 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Funding for sponsored research
is becoming more difficult to ob
tain, as fewer requests are granted
despite researchers submitting
more proposals.
The conditions are reflected in a
report issued recently by the Plan
ning and Policy Board of the Facul
ty Senate entitled, "Planning in an
Era of Change." The report found
that while the number of grants
awarded has increased slightly
since the late 19705, t he percentage
of proposals receiving funding
dropped from 72 percent to 57 per
cent between 1978 and 1994.
"The cost of doing research has
really increased," said Bonnie
Hale, information editor at Stan
ford's Sponsored Projects Office.
"The federal government can no
longer support the same numbers
as it used to â€” the competition has
gotten way more intense."
Among the problems created bv
the decline in funding is an inabili
ty on the University's part to sup
port postdoctoral students.
"There has been a definite de
cline in postdoctoral fellowships,
especially in foreign scholars,"
Hale said, explaining that it is get
ting harder for postdoctoral stu
dents to find jobs.
Hale said postdoctoral students
used to be able to move easily into
assistant professorships at the uni

versity where they did postdoctoral
work, but now that has become un
usual. She said that while medicine
and medical research still enjoy
good financial support, the social
sciences have been hit hard.
"Although the federal govern
ment hasn't passed them yet, there
are potential caps on the amount of
money you can put in for grad stu
dent support," Hale said.
Asst. Psychology Prof. Felicia
Pratto said funding graduate stu
dents makes financing tight all
around.
"We are interested in helping
fund graduate students, but I don't
end up having any money to travel
to conferences, buy books or pay re
search subjects," she said.
Asst. Physics Prof. Charlie Mar
cus said the funding problem has
created a clash between the govern
ment and departments, and the
faculty is caught in the middle.
"The conflict lies in what we can
spend the money on," Marcus said.
"Most of the money we spend on
people."
Problems for new faculty
New faculty are finding it hard
er to obtain funding than older fac
ulty who already have been granted
money for projects.
"I began working from scratch,"
said Asst. Chemistry Prof. John
Griffin. "You need to demonstrate
