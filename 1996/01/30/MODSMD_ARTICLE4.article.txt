# Slipping back in sponsored funds
## Increased costs mean fewer grants 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Funding for sponsored research
is becoming more difficult to ob
tain, as fewer requests are granted
despite researchers submitting
more proposals.
The conditions are reflected in a
report issued recently by the Plan
ning and Policy Board of the Facul
ty Senate entitled, "Planning in an
Era of Change." The report found
that while the number of grants
awarded has increased slightly
since the late 19705, t he percentage
of proposals receiving funding
dropped from 72 percent to 57 per
cent between 1978 and 1994.
"The cost of doing research has
really increased," said Bonnie
Hale, information editor at Stan
ford's Sponsored Projects Office.
"The federal government can no
longer support the same numbers
as it used to — the competition has
gotten way more intense."
Among the problems created bv
the decline in funding is an inabili
ty on the University's part to sup
port postdoctoral students.
"There has been a definite de
cline in postdoctoral fellowships,
especially in foreign scholars,"
Hale said, explaining that it is get
ting harder for postdoctoral stu
dents to find jobs.
Hale said postdoctoral students
used to be able to move easily into
assistant professorships at the uni

versity where they did postdoctoral
work, but now that has become un
usual. She said that while medicine
and medical research still enjoy
good financial support, the social
sciences have been hit hard.
"Although the federal govern
ment hasn't passed them yet, there
are potential caps on the amount of
money you can put in for grad stu
dent support," Hale said.
Asst. Psychology Prof. Felicia
Pratto said funding graduate stu
dents makes financing tight all
around.
"We are interested in helping
fund graduate students, but I don't
end up having any money to travel
to conferences, buy books or pay re
search subjects," she said.
Asst. Physics Prof. Charlie Mar
cus said the funding problem has
created a clash between the govern
ment and departments, and the
faculty is caught in the middle.
"The conflict lies in what we can
spend the money on," Marcus said.
"Most of the money we spend on
people."
Problems for new faculty
New faculty are finding it hard
er to obtain funding than older fac
ulty who already have been granted
money for projects.
"I began working from scratch,"
said Asst. Chemistry Prof. John
Griffin. "You need to demonstrate
a level of achievement before being
granted funding — fewer than one
in five projects actually get fund
ed."
Hale agreed that age can be a
problem. "Newer faculty are hav
ing to scramble," she said. "They
are failing to support themselves or
their grad students."
The problem could be helped,
Hale said, if graduate schools of
fered training for students in how
to write proposals and better pre
pared them for jobs outside acide
mia.
"Programs need to do a better
job of telling students about the re
ality that there may not be a job for
them," she said.
Funding losses
The funding situation changes
when looked at from the perspec
tive of different departments at the
University.
The Planning and Policy Board
reported that most departments

at Stanford have not suffered
losses. The School of Medicine
and independent labs have had re
spective growth rates of 3.1 and
4.2 percent.
The School of Engineering,
however, has suffered small losses
in inflation-adjusted dollars. The
Electrical Engineering and Com
puter Science Departments have
lost research volume, leading to a
2.2 percent real loss, according to
the board's report
Director of Sponsored Projects
Katharine Ku attributes the losses
to recent scrutiny by the Defense
Department, which is a major
source of funding for engineering
research. Most of the government
funding for engineering research
comes from departments like the
Depart inent of Defense and the De
partment of Energy or from the
Environmental Protection Agency,
said Ku.
The National Institutes of
Health and the National Science
Foundation also give significant
grants to medical and engineering
projects.
Electrical Engineering Depart
ment Chair Joseph Goodman said

the decrease in electrical engineer
ing research funding was more
likely due to the fact that three fac
ulty positions in the department
are vacant.
"We have not suffered signifi
cant losses. We have grown from
$60 million to $69 million over the
past four years," Goodman said.
"These fluctuations are only on a
small scale."
Still, there can never be too
much government funding. With
attitudes in Washington changing,
grants remain endangered.
Marcus said he feels there is a
general perception that science is
"good enough," and money does
not need to be spent on basic re
search any more.
"Nothing could be further from
the truth," Marcus said. "What we
know is infinitesimally small. Sci
ence needs more than a droplet."
Accumulating reserves
The Planning and Policy
Board's report also advised depart
ments to gather monetary reserves
in case of a lack of grants to gradu
ate students, but to many faculty
this seems an impossibility.

"I would be shocked if we had
any reserves," Pratto said. "I can't
imagine there is anything to save.
Any dean seeing that there is
money left over wouldn't give it to
you again next year."
Some departments have been
accumulating reserves, but be
cause they appear as unrestricted
money at the University's disposal,
department heads say they have
been encouraged to spend down the
reserves they have accumulated.
"There is a real conflict here.
Here in the report it is recommend
ed we save money, but the provost
has been pushing us to spend it,"
said a department chair in the
School of Engineering who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
Senior Assoc. Dean of Engineer
ing Jim Plummer said depart
ments do have reserves, and they
are vital to carrying departments
through rough periods.
"The school and the department
and the administration all under
stand the need for reserves," Plum
mer said. "We expect our faculty to
act like entrepreneurs and back
stop their own ability. To do that,
they need reserves, and no one is

trying not to let thern have them."
Plummer said the reserves do
not factor into the departments'
ability to obtain project funding.
"The reserves are a small frac

tion of our spending," he said.
"They don't support a significant
part of research. If they were used
that way, they would be spent to
nothing."

reserves they have accumulated.
"There is a real conflict here.
Here in the report it is recommend
ed we save money, but the provost
has been pushing us to spend it,"
said a department chair in the
School of Engineering who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
Senior Assoc. Dean of Engineer
ing Jim Plummer said depart
ments do have reserves, and they
are vital to carrying departments
through rough periods.
"The school and the department
and the administration all under
stand the need for reserves," Plum
mer said. "We expect our faculty to
act like entrepreneurs and back
stop their own ability. To do that,
they need reserves, and no one is

trying not to let thern have them."
Plummer said the reserves do
not factor into the departments'
ability to obtain project funding.
"The reserves are a small frac

tion of our spending," he said.
"They don't support a significant
part of research. If they were used
that way, they would be spent to
nothing."

Funding for sponsored research
is becoming more difficult to ob
tain, as fewer requests are granted
despite researchers submitting
more proposals.
The conditions are reflected in a
report issued recently by the Plan
ning and Policy Board of the Facul
ty Senate entitled, "Planning in an
Era of Change." The report found
that while the number of grants
awarded has increased slightly
since the late 19705, t he percentage
of proposals receiving funding
dropped from 72 percent to 57 per
cent between 1978 and 1994.
"The cost of doing research has
really increased," said Bonnie
Hale, information editor at Stan
ford's Sponsored Projects Office.
"The federal government can no
longer support the same numbers
as it used to — the competition has
gotten way more intense."
Among the problems created bv
the decline in funding is an inabili
ty on the University's part to sup
port postdoctoral students.
"There has been a definite de
cline in postdoctoral fellowships,
especially in foreign scholars,"
Hale said, explaining that it is get
ting harder for postdoctoral stu
dents to find jobs.
Hale said postdoctoral students
used to be able to move easily into
assistant professorships at the uni

versity where they did postdoctoral
work, but now that has become un
usual. She said that while medicine
and medical research still enjoy
good financial support, the social
sciences have been hit hard.
"Although the federal govern
ment hasn't passed them yet, there
are potential caps on the amount of
money you can put in for grad stu
dent support," Hale said.
Asst. Psychology Prof. Felicia
Pratto said funding graduate stu
dents makes financing tight all
around.
"We are interested in helping
fund graduate students, but I don't
end up having any money to travel
to conferences, buy books or pay re
search subjects," she said.
Asst. Physics Prof. Charlie Mar
cus said the funding problem has
created a clash between the govern
ment and departments, and the
faculty is caught in the middle.
"The conflict lies in what we can
spend the money on," Marcus said.
"Most of the money we spend on
people."
Problems for new faculty
New faculty are finding it hard
er to obtain funding than older fac
ulty who already have been granted
money for projects.
"I began working from scratch,"
said Asst. Chemistry Prof. John
Griffin. "You need to demonstrate
a level of achievement before being
granted funding — fewer than one
in five projects actually get fund
ed."
Hale agreed that age can be a
problem. "Newer faculty are hav
ing to scramble," she said. "They
are failing to support themselves or
their grad students."
The problem could be helped,
Hale said, if graduate schools of
fered training for students in how
to write proposals and better pre
pared them for jobs outside acide
mia.
"Programs need to do a better
job of telling students about the re
ality that there may not be a job for
them," she said.
Funding losses
The funding situation changes
when looked at from the perspec
tive of different departments at the
University.
The Planning and Policy Board
reported that most departments

at Stanford have not suffered
losses. The School of Medicine
and independent labs have had re
spective growth rates of 3.1 and
4.2 percent.
The School of Engineering,
however, has suffered small losses
in inflation-adjusted dollars. The
Electrical Engineering and Com
puter Science Departments have
lost research volume, leading to a
2.2 percent real loss, according to
the board's report
Director of Sponsored Projects
Katharine Ku attributes the losses
to recent scrutiny by the Defense
Department, which is a major
source of funding for engineering
research. Most of the government
funding for engineering research
comes from departments like the
Depart inent of Defense and the De
partment of Energy or from the
Environmental Protection Agency,
said Ku.
The National Institutes of
Health and the National Science
Foundation also give significant
grants to medical and engineering
projects.
Electrical Engineering Depart
ment Chair Joseph Goodman said

the decrease in electrical engineer
ing research funding was more
likely due to the fact that three fac
ulty positions in the department
are vacant.
"We have not suffered signifi
cant losses. We have grown from
$60 million to $69 million over the
past four years," Goodman said.
"These fluctuations are only on a
small scale."
Still, there can never be too
much government funding. With
attitudes in Washington changing,
grants remain endangered.
Marcus said he feels there is a
general perception that science is
"good enough," and money does
not need to be spent on basic re
search any more.
"Nothing could be further from
the truth," Marcus said. "What we
know is infinitesimally small. Sci
ence needs more than a droplet."
Accumulating reserves
The Planning and Policy
Board's report also advised depart
ments to gather monetary reserves
in case of a lack of grants to gradu
ate students, but to many faculty
this seems an impossibility.

"I would be shocked if we had
any reserves," Pratto said. "I can't
imagine there is anything to save.
Any dean seeing that there is
money left over wouldn't give it to
you again next year."
Some departments have been
accumulating reserves, but be
cause they appear as unrestricted
money at the University's disposal,
department heads say they have
been encouraged to spend down the
reserves they have accumulated.
"There is a real conflict here.
Here in the report it is recommend
ed we save money, but the provost
has been pushing us to spend it,"
said a department chair in the
School of Engineering who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
