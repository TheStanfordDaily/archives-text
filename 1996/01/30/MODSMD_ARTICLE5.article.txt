## Russians want out of Hoover deal 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
The Russian government has
canceled a historic agreement with
the Hoover Institution to microfilm
Communist Party records and
other documents of Soviet history
previously closed to the public.
Russian officials informed the
institution that they must either
stop work on the project within six
months or renegotiate a deal more
favorable to Russian interests.
"We're trying to negotiate a new
agreement," said Charles Palm,
deputy director of the institution.
"I'm hopeful that we will be able to
continue the project."
Organizers of the project met
with leaders of Rosarkhiv — the
Russian Federation's Committee
on Archival Affairs — two weeks
ago to begin negotiating a new
agreement.
The cancellation of the agree
ment was prompted bv the resur
gence of the Communist Party in

Russia and pending legislation
which tightens international infor
mation exchanges by Russian gov
ernment agencies, Palm said.
Under the terms of the April
1992 agreement, scholars from the
institution were allowed to transfer
important documents of Soviet his
tory to microfilm. Copies of the mi
crofilm were given to the Russian
National Library and Library of
Congress, as well as to Hoover.
The project was funded by the in
stitution, which also gave $250,000
in royalties to Russia for the use of
the microfilms. In addition, Hoover
was to give Russia copies of micro
films from its extensive collection of
Russian holdings.
Some Russians said they feel
that the agreement was canceled
because the terms of the deal were
unfair.
"Generally speaking, the sale of
archival 'raw material' is being
compared by specialists to the
pumping of crude oil to the West,"
wrote Izvestia, a Russian newspa
per. "It is more profitable to lx.* en
gaged in the production of refined
oil-products."

Palm characterized such alle
gations as unfair. "They were
given a great deal," he said. "Thej
just didn't like what we were
doing."
Work on the $8 million project
will continue until the July dead
line.
So far, the project has put more
than 8 million sheets of paper ontc

microfilm, a height equal to 10
Hoover Towers, Palm said.
The project, which deals with
the largest collection of materials
on modern Russian history outside
of Russia, has already reproduced
important documents on topics in
cluding Josef Stalin's secret police
and the Communist Party's Cen
tred Committee.
