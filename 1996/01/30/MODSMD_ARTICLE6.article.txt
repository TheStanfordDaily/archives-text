# Must-see TV: Med students gather for 'ER'

Scapular anastamoses. Neutrophils. George
Clooney. First-year medical students have a lot on their
minds.
Fortunately, t hey are aided in the effort to juggle
their complicated schedules by communal "ER" screen
ings. At 10 p.m. on Thursdays, as other TV rooms fill up
all over campus, anywhere from a sixth to a third of the
first-year students at Stanford Medical School gather in
an Escondido Village apartment to watch the critically
acclaimed NBC drama.
These informal weekly assemblies were the brain
child of Harvey Fishinan and Jeff Goldberg, both mem
bers of the first-year class.
"We learned about the different people in our class
fduring orientation). People talked about political is
sues. We were paired up to make diversity contracts,"
says Fishman.
Fishman and Goldberg were assigned as partners,
and the goal of their diversity contract, they derided,
was to encourage cohesion among their classmates.
"We decided to make 'ER Night,' to make our class
stronger," says Fishman.
As for the format of the nights, they consist primari

Gathering together in an Escondido Village apartment every week, first-year Stanford Medical
School students watch on televised the surgical operations that they may in the future carry out
themselves.
ing at the screen, talking during the
commercials and cheering loudly
when the television d(x-tors use a
recognizable phrase or term.
"The first episode we watched as
a group, they mentioned hemop
neumothorax," says Daniel Green
wald, another first-year student.
"We had learned about it in anato
my earlier in the week. Everyone
shouted out [when the actor men
tions! it]." Greenwald adds, "It's a
game to hunt out words and terms
we understand."
On a night in early December,
the various plot lines on the show
focus on a child who dies of Sudden
Infant Death Syndrome, a man
whose wife tries to kill him by dri
ving into him and then smothering
him with a pillow, a woman who re
ceives a toxic dose of anesthetic, a
man who is mentally unstable and
hordes pencils, a man who injures
himself by falling on a reindeer dis

play and a woman who is married to
one of the doctors but gets involved
in a car accident with her new
boyfriend.
Sensational as these themes
might seem, Greenwald claims, "A
lot of clinical cases relate to some
course work we're already begin
ning to learn."
Because the students have an
exam tomorrow, they quiz each
other during commercials. "What
are the hormones of the posterior
lobe?" calls out Goldberg, and a gar
ble of voices respond. When the
show resumes, the students imme
diately shush each other.
Unlike many other viewers of
"ER," the mod students say they are
not disgusted by the vivid opera
tions performed on screen. Blood
and guts, they explain, have become
routine.
"As pail of an anatomy course,
we watch videos of operations," says
Fishman. "We watch them at noon,
over lunch. They show people's
faces coming off, or evulsed baby's
eyeballs."
In addition, savs Fishman,

"We've dissected the entire human
body, and we're used to seeing
bizarre things."
Despite FLshman's assurances,
when the woman who received the
toxic dose of anesthetic goes into a
seizure on screen, a small voice in
the living room can be heard mur
muring, "Ew." This voice is, howev
er, the exception. For the most part,
the students do indeed watch the
screen calmly and silently, even dur
ing the most graphic scenes.
But the medical students are not
entirely different from other view
ers of the show. Between making
various anatomical observations, a
student notes about a female resi
dent, "She's stopped curling her
hair."
This blend of the medical and the
mundane is what makes "ER
Night" so successful, according to
its participants.
"There's a lot to learn about in
med school," says Fishman. "It can
be overwhelming. It's a lot of fun to
learn about the differences between
medicine on 'Wand medicine in real
life."
