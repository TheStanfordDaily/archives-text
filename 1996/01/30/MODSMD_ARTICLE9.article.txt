New AIDS drug inspires hope
WASHINGTON (AP) — A triple-punch combi
nation of an experimental new AIDS drug and two
others already on the market is by far the most
potent treatment yet for people infected with the
deadly virus, researchers reported yesterday.
The therapy does not cure AIDS. At best, it will
slow and perhaps stall the disease for long peri
ods. Even this could be a significant advance,
since currently available virus medicines do little
to extend AIDS patients' lives.
The treatment involves one of a new class of
drugs called protease inhibitors and is still in
early stages of human testing. Nevertheless,
AIDS researchers who have seen many promising
initial results go sour in the past are enthusiastic
about the latest findings.
The key to the new combination is indinavir, a
still-experimental protease inhibitor developed by

Merck & Co. It is combined with the standard
AIDS medicines AZT and 3TC.
Dr. Roy Gulick and colleagues from New York
University gave the combination to 26 patients.
After six months, they could find no measurable
trace of the AIDS virus in 24 of them. Their treat
ment is continuing, but researchers say it is still
too soon to know how long this effect will last.
Magic moment for the Lakers
Magic Johnson's return was greeted around
the NBA by what seemed a universal response —
Welcome back.
league officials and players believe .Johnson
will give the Los Angeles Lakers a huge boost, and
the NBA as well. There also seemed a consensus
that increased knowledge and acceptance of HIV
should make that a non-issue in his comeback.
"I think he never should have retired in the first
place," Indiana Pacers guard Reggie Miller said.
