Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates came
to Stanford yesterday to dedicate the new
building named for him a structure built
with money he chose to give to the University,
although he never graduated from college him
self'.
"I'm a college dropout," Gates said at the
dedication of the $.18.-1 million William Gates
Computer Science building, for which he do
nated $6 million."I didn't even drop out of the
right college."
A number of other organizations and indi
viduals contributed funding to the project, in-

cluding Hewlett-Packard, NEC, and J. Eric
Jonsson of Texas Instruments.
Gates, who spent a few years at I larvard be
fore leaving to help start Microsoft Corp., now
a computer industry giant, spent all yesterday
on campus, giving a talk, touring the building
named for him and leading a symposium for
computer science students.
"It's fantastic to see this building and how
it's come together so well,'' Gates said at a for
mal dedication in the afternoon.
Although his contribution was significant,
Gates said he wished he had waited longer be
fore making his donation.
" I sold Microsoft shares to raise the money,"
he said. "I should have waited a couple years,

Starting it up at Stanford:
Microsoft mogul Bill Gates
dedicates the computer science
building that bears his name

and 1 would have been able to give two-and
one-half times as much."
Many of the day's events focused on the fu
ture of both computer science and the Stanford
Computer Science Department.
In a morning speech on "Personal Comput
ing and the Intra / Internet" and an afternoon
symposium on the "Future of Computer Sci
ence Technology," Gates and other speakers
looked to the seemingly endless possibilities of
technology.
"I have no doubt that great things will hap
pen in this building over t he next few decades,"
said John Eriedenrich, chair of Stanford's

Board of Trustees.
Dean of Engineering Jim Gib
bons was also enthusiastic about
the research possibilities the build
ing will create.
"The building is too new yet to
have its own special history and
patina, but it won't take the stu
dents and faculty too long to rectify
that," he said. "So here is my predic
tion: Within the next 18 months,
something will happen here, and
there will be some place, some office,
some corner, where people will point
and say, 'Yeah, that's where they

worked on the fill-in-the-blank in
1996 and 1997.' "
In his morning speech, held at a
packed Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
Gates spoke about areas in comput
er technology that will see a lot of
change in the coming years, includ
ing personal computers, CD-ROMs
and the Internet.
1 le drew t he crowd's laughter by
showinga video, titled "State of the
Art," by the Bermudan musician
Digital Obsession. The reggae tune
defined a "state of the art" person as
one who, among other things, uses
acronyms "without apology;" ex
amples of today's fascination with
technology were scattered through
out the video.
At one point, a man confessed to

a priest that "it's been six weeks
since I backed up my hard drive,"
and the priest sent him to Mother
Theresa's site on the World Wide
Web — www.mom.sufTering.nun.
"One thing that's happening in
credibly rapidly is the focus on the
Internet," Gates said. "One of the
big issues about delivering on this
excitement is the speed of the net
works involved."
While university campuses often
already have the fastest networking
equipment available, small busi
nesses and individuals using
modems must be able to catch up,
using equipment that transfers in
formation at a speed faster than the
28,800-baud modems that are cur
rently top of the line, he said.
Other issues that may come up
include advertising on the Internet
and questions of security and copy
rights, Gates said.
"There's a lot to l>e done to fulfill
the incredible promise that's being
made today," he said.
Gates noted that, despite tech
nological advances, unifying the de
partment was an important step.
"It's amazing that even in this
age . . . it's really important to have
people all in the same place," he
said.
Before moving into the Gates
Building during winter break, the
Computer Science Department was
scattered in eight locations across
campus. The new building includes
conference rooms, a robotics labo
ratory and a number of auditori
ums and classrooms — many
named after donors, including
Stanford alumni William Hewlett
and David Packard, who attended

the ceremony.
During a tour of the building,
Gates saw presentations and tried
out some of the equipment current
ly under development. A three-di
mensional image of his head was
scanned in and shown to the crowd
at the symposium.

As he left theGates Building, dis
cussing the importance of advances
in technology for universities, he
was met by the Stanford Band,
playing "She Blinded Me With Sci
ence."
The phenomenon of classrooms
without walls is likely to be seen

more and more, as video and other
technologies link people across the
world to universities, Gates said.
"We're just at the beginning of
that," he said, adding that it would
be "up to the students" to deter
mine what is done with such tech
nology.
