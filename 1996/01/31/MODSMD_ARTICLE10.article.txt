# Quest for balanced budget appears to be out of reach
## President Clinton and Republicans now aim to bring congressional moderates to their team 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Barring a
miracle, the quest for a grand balanced
budget deal is dead. But each side's elec
tion-year drive to portray the other as the
villain is just beginning.
In professed attempts to revive the
budget-balancing effort, President Clin
ton and Republicans are waging separate
long-shot campaigns to woo congression
al moderates from the other party to
their warring visions of spending and tax
cuts.
At the same time, Republicans may
force House votes next month on the two
camps' final offers at the budget talks, in
hopes of showing that few Democrats
support Clinton's plan while there is
bipartisan backing for the GOP proposal.
Real budget work remains. The admin
istration says a cataclysmic federal
default will occur unless Congress
extends the debt limit in February. And
temporary spending authority for dozens
of agencies, renewed last Friday, will have
to be extended once again by March 15.
Rut for now, both parties — aware
that voters want federal deficits eliminat
ed — are trying to avoid blame for the col

lapse of the yearlong budget effort.
Each side's attempt to gain support
from House and Senate moderates is all
but certain to fall short of producing a
compromise that can become law, partic
ipants concede.
"We just decided we're going to keep
working, even if it's a very slight chance,"
said Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minn., a
leader of the so-called Blue Dogs, conser
vative House Democrats who have been
meeting with leaders of both sides.
Even so, the chairmen of the Senate
and House budget committees, Sen. Pete
Domenici, R-N.M., and Rep. John Kasich,
R-Ohio, plan to meet tommorrow with
leaders of the Blue Dogs and Senate mod
erates of both parties, led by Sens. John
Breaux, D-La., and John Chafee, R-R.I.
Last Thursday, White House chief of staff
Leon Panetta and Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin met with the Senate group.
Both the Blue Dogs and Senate moder
ates have produced budget plans with
proposed savings in Medicare, welfare
and other programs that fall mostly
between Clinton and the GOP.
The biggest gulf is over tax cuts: the

Blue Dogs have proposed none and the
Senate moderates want $130 billion over
seven years, well below the near $200 bil
lion the GOP has sought.
The problem with crafting a package
that satisfies the moderates is that con
servative Republicans and liberal
Democrats are likely to be alienated in
sufficient number to prevent a congres
sional package. Many House Republi
cans, for instance, are adamant that any
final plan include sizable tax cuts.
"We can't spend all our time worrying
about the House of Representatives,"
said the moderate Chafee in an interview.
"So far what they've done is come up
with programs that don't have a chance
in"the Senate.
Nonetheless, each side hopes it can
drum up enough moderate votes to pres
sure its opponents to return to the bar
gaining table and make major conces
sions. Even that is unlikely.
But in the meantime, the effort helps
each camp depict itself as dedicated to
eliminating the deficit — which could
become especially valuable if continued
deadlock causes the financial markets to

dive. As they do virtually every day, both
sides focused on that theme yesterday.
"The president believes there remains
a centrist, bipartisan majority in favor of
a historic balanced budget agreement and
we're going to see if we can assemble that
coalition," said White House spokesman
Mike McCurry.
McCurry added that Republicans
eventually would "want to get on some
thing other than the caboose."
As a demonstration of determination
to reach a deal, Clinton met yesterday
with about 20 House moderates.
"He's going to scratch and claw and
find an agreement wherever he can,"
Rep. Gary Condit, D-Calif., said after
leaving the meeting.
"We're going to work hard as we can
for an agreement until they turn out the
lights, lock the doors and send us home,"
Condit said.
Campaigning in lowa for the GOP
presidential nomination, Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole said that if Republicans
can't reach a budget deal with the presi
dent, "we're going to send him bill after
bill after bill that sends power to the peo

pie . . . and find out where the president
stands."
Meanwhile, GOP leaders considered
whether to schedule House votes on the
final offers by Clinton and Republicans at
the defunct budget talks.
Yesterday, after a meeting, the GOP
leaders decided not to stage the votes this
week, but planned on delaying them until
after lawmakers return from a recess in
late February.
Some Republicans, hoping to see Clin
ton embarrassed, believed few Democrats
would support Clinton's plan because of
its spending cuts.
They also thought enough Democrats
would vote for the GOP offer to let Repub
licans spend the 1996 election campaign
arguing that only Clinton blocked a bipar
tisan budget-balancing deal.
Hut others feared the strategy would
backfire, giving Democrats a record vote
for a balanced budget, thus removing a
campaign argument against them. One
Democratic aide suggested that
Democrats might vote against the Clin
ton package en masse to invalidate the
entire exercise.
