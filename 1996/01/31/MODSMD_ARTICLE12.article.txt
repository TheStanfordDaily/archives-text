# Who's afraid of Forbes?

WASHINGTON (AP) — First it was
George Herbert Walker Bush, now Mal
colm Stevenson Forbes, Jr. For Hob Dole,
it is a scenario all too familiar: Just when
he thinks the presidential nomination is
within reach, a preppy challenger with
inherited wealth threatens his grip.
Dole isn't the only 1996 Republican
candidate to take potshots at Forbes' priv
ileged upbringing and publishing family
fortune. "Richie Rich," is Texas Sen. Phil
Gramm's label for Forbes. Pat Buchanan
talks of Forbes crafting his Hat tax plan
"down at the yacht basin" and of a palatial
Forbes estate complete with polo ponies.
But while these salvos are usually deliv
ered with a good-natured smile, Forbes is
clearly grtting under Dole's skin.
When he takes after Forbes' wealth, it
is sometimes done with deft humor; the
other day Dole predicted he would win
once voters "add up our assets," but then
he jokingly cringed and said of Forbes,
"He's got a lot of those." But increasingly,
Dole's references to Forbes' fortune are
made with a nervous, .biting sarcasm —
not unlike some of the swipes Dole took at
Bush in their 1988 nomination battle.
Over the weekend, for example, Dole
was campaigning in New Hampshire and
criticizing Forbes' self-financed multimil
lion-dollar advertising campaign, most of
it dedicated to labeling Dole a tax-raising,
wasteful-spending Washington insider.
The Senate majority leader started with
a joke: "I've seen so many negative ads
about Bob Dole I probably wouldn't vote

for myself. I can't be that bad." After a
brief pause, Dole scowled and added: "I
can't be that rich, either."
It's not just the money.
Aides who remember Dole's 1988 expe
rience say it frustrated him that Bush, the
son of a wealthy senator, pot to be vice
president although his only experience in
elective office was four years in the House.
Some also say Dole's resentment toward
Bush is why he rejected advice to drop out
of the 1988 race after being trounced on
Super Tuesday, instead staying on to
endure several more embarrassing
defeats.
"I went to public schools. Some of the
candidates don't have that advantage,"
was a favorite Dole way of drawing a con
trast with Bush, who attended the exclu
sive Phillips Academy and then Yale.
"Nobody gave it to me," Dole said in
that campaign. "I didn't have rich and
powerful parents. I made it the hard way. I
worked at it."
Eight years later, it is much the same.
Clearly frustrated with Forbes' surge,
Dole now more and more recalls his hard
scrabble upbringing in Russell, Kan., the
onetime paperboy and soda jerk whose
family endured hard times by moving into
the basement of their home and renting
out the upstairs.
Shaking his head at the picture of his
career painted in the Forbes ads, Dole
offers a different take: "It's been about
values and honesty and decency and self
reliance and discipline."
