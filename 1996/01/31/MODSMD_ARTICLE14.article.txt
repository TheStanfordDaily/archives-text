Provost Rice should set
up panel to review costs
of revenue-making depts.

THREE YEARS AGO, Stan
ford administrators said
that the only way to keep
the University from falling into
fiscal crisis was to cut budgets
quickly. At the time, it was agreed
that efforts should he focused on
cost-cutting in non-revenue gen
erating departments in response
to drastic reductions in Stan
ford's indirect-cost recovery rate.
In the end, the University was
able to meet its goal of paring $18
million from the consolidated
budget.
With the first phase of this
painful period of belt-tightening
behind us, Provost Condoleezza
Rice and the University should
keep their promise of trying to
reduce costs overall by focusing
resources on improving the effi
ciency of departments that do
generate revenue — like Housing
and Dining Services.
The only reason that Housing
and Dining Services was spared
the budget-cutting laser several
years ago was, in fact, its status
as a revenue-generating opera
tion; at that time, the University
implicitly promised to go back and
scrutinize exempted units like
food service a* thoroughly as it
analyzed non-revenue generating
areas like the Stanford libraries,
where budget cuts have severely
limited services.
At the ASSU Senate meeting
on Nov. 7, Rice — in addition to
predicting the return of the Axe
to its rightful home — conceded
that a review of units like Hous
ing and Dining Services had not
yet been done, but promised to
take action in the near future,
suggesting that summer might be
a good time. This is great news for
students in light of the wide

spread suspicion that Housing
and Dining Services is a very ine
fficient operation that charges too
much.
However, if reforms are going
to he carried out this summer as
implied, Rice needs to get some
framework of ideas on the table so
that students can offer input on
this important issue. Just as
graduates and undergraduates
were involved in the numerous
budget-cutting task forces con
vened during the recent compre
hensive cost-cutting campaign,
students must be consulted if the
University is serious about
streamlining a division of services
which has a direct impact on stu
dent lives' everyday.
In the past, students were
appointed by the ASSU Nomina
tions Commission and were influ
ential and useful in the decision
making process. For a unit as
closely wedded to student affairs
and life as Housing and Dining
Services, it's absolutely vital to
have students involved in the
decision-making process.
Therefore, Rice should set up a
task force as soon as possible. Such
a task force could be composed of
Housing and Dining Services per
sonnel, University administrators,
financial advisers and perhaps
dorm food-service representatives.
In addition, the working group
established by the Council of Pres
idents and Dining Services could
advise members of this new panel
with their initial findings concern
ing student needs and how best to
keep those services that are most
in demand. It would be a good step
in improving the sense that stu
dents are welcome in decisions
that affect their own quality of life
at Stanford. It would also make it
more likely that future students
will actually see a difference in
their dining halls and board bills.
We hope that Rice's promise
to assess Housing and Dining
Services critically will prove as
substantive as her prediction of
the return of the Axe to the
Farm.
