SCBN station manager responds to network critics

SINCE ITS INCEPTION in 1992,
the Stanford Cardinal Broadcasting
Network has been laying the foun
dation for an enlightening and entertain
ing television network. We have been
ardently fine-tuning our service to the
Stanford community and would like to
express our gratitude to The Stanford
Daily, KZSU and the ASSU for acknowl
edging SCBN's continued growth and
improvement, having confidence in our
efforts. Equally, without the help of Troy
Gilbert and the Office of Student Associa
tions, we would not have the facilities and
resources upon which to build a viable
communication medium. Above all, we
would like to thank the SCBN staff mem
bers for the dedication, effort and vision
they've infused into the spirit of the net-

work toward more promising horizons.
In response to Susan Kanagawa's Jan.
'29 letter to The Daily, we would like to
address her belief that SCBN is "unwor
thy of The Daily's praise" in striving for
improvement and growth in our services.
We believe that pursuing such develop
ment goals not only makes SCBN more
effective as a campus television station,
but an exciting component of the Stan
ford experience as well.
Regarding the Taiko performance tape
to which Kanagawa referred, SCBN com
pleted what it set out to do within the
two-week time frame. We produced a pol
ished, broadcast-quality master from
which we could make dubs. What has
taken eight months has been to provide
copies, numbering far more than 50, to

those wishing to preserve a memory of
the Stanford Taiko experience. Nonethe
less, we appreciate Kanagawa's acknowl
edgment of "the limitations of time and
resources" that volunteer student organi
zations face. We hope to continue provid
ing quality video productions of Stanford
performances, a service SCBN provides
at-cost, and at times, at a loss, for the
benefit of the entire community.
SCBN's future holds a lot of promise.
Ventures such as Teleflicks, our new
weekly-variety show "SCBN Live;" con
tinued coverage of campus events such as
the AASA Fashion Show, Gaieties, Win
ter One Acts, Sanskriti's annual Mela and
Oliver Stone's visit to campus have
enabled us to act as a powerful resource
for the community. In addition, SCBN

assists those exploring the field of broad
cast television and narrative video,
empowering many Stanford students to
pursue careers at MTV, Warner Bros.,
Disney and many other venerable enter
tainment avenues.
We've come a long way, but there are
still many obstacles ahead. For those who
have stuck by us through thick and thin,
we sincerely thank you for your support
and we invite everyone to stop by our stu
dio to experience some of the magic only
beginning to gain momentum.
