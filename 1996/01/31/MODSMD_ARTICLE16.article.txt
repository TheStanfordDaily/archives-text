# Assoc. Director of Housing & Dining Services says letter was unfair and uninformed
## 
### 
The factual inaccuracics of Shervin
Malekzadeh's letter in the Jan. 25 issue
of The Stanford Daily should not go
unanswered.
To read Malekzadeh's description of
the events of mid-December, you would
think the University was unresponsive
during the storms, did not notice that
power was out in several houses on the
How and would not have bothered to
secure the campus and residences had it
not been for the efforts of one specific

undergraduate who contacted Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper's office.
Grandiose as it is, this would be a
harmless account if it were not so dis
counting of the efforts of the literally
dozens of staff members in housing and
throughout the University who extended
themselves to respond during the storm,
helping students all over campus who
were adversely affected during finals
week. We were acutely aware of the bad
timing of the storm and made concerted
efforts to get information from PG & E
about when the power would be restored
to the houses on the Row.
When it became clear after the first
night that this information would not
be forthcoming and that, unlike previ-

ous PG & E outages, this one was likely
to be protracted, staff throughout
Housing and Dining Services mobilized
to provide blankets, flashlights, meal
service, alternative sleeping and study
spaces, computer equipment support
and many other arrangements. All
these measures were discussed the
afternoon of Dec. 12 and underway in
many houses early Wednesday morning
before any call referenced in
Malekzadeh's letter. We would have
been happy to share this information
with Malekzadeh had he called our staff
in Housing Facilities directly before
making some of the assumptions in his
letter.
I want to thank The Daily for its ear

lier editorial on the University's
response to the storm's effects on stu
dent housing. These efforts were under
taken responsibly, conscientiously and
in consultation with many students in
houses on the Row. They were not the
sole result of any specific student's
action or phone call. It is gratifying to
see hard-working staff have their efforts
recognized bv the students they serve,
and we appreciate The Daily's efforts to
acknowledge some of the many good
things going on around campus in the
midst of a difficult and unforeseen situa
tion.
