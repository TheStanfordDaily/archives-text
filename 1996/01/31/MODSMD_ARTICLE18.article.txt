## A 						columnist reflects 
### 
THIS IS MY last column, finally. To
anyone considering writing a col
umn in the next volume, I exhort
you to forget it, for many reasons. First,
the fame factor is non-existent. Only
about two people have mentioned any
thing to me about my columns (the fact
that they were bad is beside the point).
Just like no one cared about mine, no
one will care about yours (I rarely read
any columns this quarter). I even tried
posturing at the Co Mo, but encountered
no success: the adulating crowds formed
around the people who would buy beer
for the underage. I was left with the itin
erant freaks and the same songs over
and over.
Secondly, you'll be pushed around by
The Daily's editorial wonks, who don't
even believe "expressivity" is a word
without a Webster confirmation. Even if
it weren't, who cares? Journalists can
wedge their creations into banal "Strunk
and White" masterpieces, but columnists
are not Daily employees. We don't get
paid, we don't get secretaries, we don't
get to write other articles for The Daily
a professional distance must be cut.
And I, for one, have no interest in
writing in style-free formulaic mode. I've
tried my best, but have been cut down by
my editors, even after I have sat down
with them to "edit" my piece. A column
less readable than "Finnegan's Wake"
might be much more gripping than
another column about dating at Stanford
that has no split infinitives. Often times,
1 tried to use unorthodox punctuation

technique to produce a different reading
experience but was chopped down by peo
ple using a helicopters-and-gingerbread
style of writing. In fact, I am sure that
there will be a few aspects of this column
changed from its original form after it
enters the Storke Publications Building.
Another point: do you want to be like
Tish Williams or Michael Green?
Wouldn't it be interesting to see a graph
ic in the space of a column once a week?
Though The Review has an obviously
biased slant, its reporting is often writ
ten much more intellectually and engag
ingly than this rag.
I am not going to reflect on any of my
hypocrisy. I'll let you little ones (readers)
do that.
On the topic of columnists, I certainly
think it is cool that Ellen Goodman is
here, but perhaps for a bit of balance, we
should get ex-reporter Pat Robertson or
radio show host Ollie North here to teach
a class.
I leave this space with a poem I found.
Technicolor seasons / Offer attractive
reasons/To miss the past / Leaving the
present for the last / Asserting a life in
the now / While being actual at the other
ends / Towards times fresh and back to
times far/Where value is the judgment
of being/If time is a solitary relative
package / Bundled and separated only to /
Be managed by / A rational mind / That
needs to find / A solution respectful of its
immuration / A unique, inescapable situ
ation.
And this too.

Down by the stream I was
My hands clamped to my forehead.
I felt the blemish and remembered
her.
Her beautiful lies and supple tears
That washed away my existential
pain.
Excursions of the flesh
All rendered meaning less by godfa
ther Reagan.
Regal damnation sets my loins
aflame.
Ecstatic, I find myself in trans-human
land.
Ascetic, I feel the Pythagorean twang.
I cry to the sky, "Let me show you
sweet delight."
With gnashing teeth and rippled
thighs
I espy the chasm and touch foreign
highs.
A white cloud consumes my mem
berâ€” (ship of state).
My forehead now a tabula rasa pur
ple-green plate.
The stream flows open and I feel
release
False, though, as I find myself upside
down again
Nuthin's gunna change my luv 4 (let
ter) U.

Good riddance. Alas, parting is such
sweet sorrow (cliche, but at least the
masses will understand it, Mr. Kazaks).
