# Government shutdown?
## Reform bill sparks walkout 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Two senators walked
out of last night's ASSIi
Senate meeting in
protest over senate ac
tions, trying to use their
power of breaking quo
rum to prevent the intro
duction of a constitution
al amendment on cam
paign reform.

Undergraduate senators Steve Russell
and Howard Loo left an arguing senate
room, saying they were furious that other
senators were manipulating the legislative
process.
At issue was a specific section of a com
prehensive election bylaw amendment
which would have severely reduced cam
paign expense limits in the ASSU constitu
tion. Although the section was struck from
the bill as it was introduced, several mem-

hers of the senate — particularly Senate
Chair Alane Murdock — wanted to reintro
duce that particular measure as a part of
the entire amendment.
The section would have severely reduced
campaign expense limits for individual can
didates, changing the candidate limit from
$120 to $60, and placing a cap on the special
fee group campaign spending at $500. The
hill also placed a $100 cap on party spend
ing, which currently has no restrictions.
Loo and Russell grew frustrated when
Murdock tried to reintroduce the section
for voting even though others had called for
more discussion.
"I did want to break quorum," Loo said
in an interview after the meeting. "I
thought the bill should be presented as the
authors intended, and not just the way the
senate chair wanted."
Hut Murdock said it was necessary to
consider t he ent ire bill as a whole, with both

election bylaws and campaign fi
nance reform together, because
she was afraid that the issue of
campaign finance reform would
never be addressed.
After the walkout, the senate
still had quorum, but the proposal
to consider campaign spending
alongside election bylaws was de
feated. Instead, the spending mea
sure will be considered separately
at the next senate meeting.
The senate also addressed an
other major bill last night — spe
cial-fee reform. Passed in last
spring's general election, the
Common Sense Fee Reform
changes the system of special fee
allocation.
Previously, the entire student
body, both graduate and under
graduate, voted on whether to
grant student groups their special
fee. With the Common Sense Fee
Reform, groups can now apply to a
particular student population
graduate, undergraduate or both.
Fees are t hen awarded by majority

within that population.
Before the bill received its final
authorization from the senate,
some senators raised concerns
over its financial impact. Senators
discussed the potential that stu
dent groups who mainly serve one
of those communities will appar
ently have more chance of gaining
their special fee under the reform.
But the change also means that
some fees may be hiked up because
only one population may be forced
to supply all the funding for a cer
tain group.
Student groups who apply for
their special fee to only one popu
lation cannot deny their services
to the other population. They
may, however, charge a per capita
special fee.
ASSU service and business pro
jects were barred from applying to
only one community on the
grounds that the ASSU seeks to
serve both communities, and
needs to concentrate on represent
ing all students.
The senate also passed several
bills which affect an wide range of
University issues: allocating win
ter quarter funds, requesting a re
view of teaching assistant status,

appointing a new Nominations
Commission chair and encourag
ing the University administration
to speed up the process of bill rati
fication.
When addressing the Universi
ty's relationship to the ASSU, the
senate emphasized the impor
tance of University respect. The
bill explained that it took Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
more than nine months to accept
the Common Sense Fee Reform.
The senate also passed a bill
that requests a University review
of teaching assistant status and
training. "The University typical
ly does a review of TAs every three
or four years," said graduate sena
tor Doug Natelson. "Nothing has
been done since 1988 — and a lot
of financial restructuring has con
spicuously gone on since then."
In another measure which
ended the two-month controversy
over the Nominations Commis
sion, the Senate approved junior
Paul Kim as the new commission
chair. Senate Deputy Chair Bill
Shen said work on a training pro
gram will begin immediately and
Kim will be ready to make ap
pointments in the spring.
