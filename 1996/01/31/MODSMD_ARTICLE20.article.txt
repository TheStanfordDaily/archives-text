## Basic break-up methodology — which will it be? 
### 
T)mt which does not kill me makes me
bitter.
— Ari Newberger
I think I might got dumped some time
soon. I have a feeling: A glance that didn't
linger, a strand of hair fallen over my face
that she didn't brush back, a dark smudge
of lipstick on her collar (I only go with pinks
— I'm a winter). .. these things tell a story.
And the story ends with me getting my
sorry ass dumped.
I wonder how she'll do it. I wonder how
my hoochie will try to let me go.
There are, after all, only a few standard
methods of terminating a relationship still
in use today — there's very little creativity
to be found in the euthanizing of emotion.
True, the days of "Let's just be friends"
are over and done with — thank (rod — but
while there were once some 50 ways to leave
your lover, now it seems the modern female
population has a working knowledge of
four.
Let's review the basic techniques, shall
we?
I Ignore and Hope He Cioes Away
I love this one — just dwindle and pre
sume. It works Ih'st and when the relation
ship is still in the undefined, still-don 't-talk
everyday stages and the guy has his hopes

up.
More specifically:
One day, you call mid you get no answer
back. You spend a week on the fence asking
anyone who'll listen (RAs get paid for thus
part) if it's okay to call back before she does.
Finally, you do.
Only, once again, no response. It is
expected that you will recognize this as a
"hint." Failure to do so will cause ridicule
before her friends and future nookmates
(i.e., your draw mates).
Of course, you feel you deserve better,
but, of course, you never do say so. If you
bump into one another by chance, courtesy
demands you pretend you're tying your
shoe at the time and don't notice her pass
ing by.
Prediction: I don't think my hoochie
will go with this one. We live too close by to
keep the chance encounters to the necessary
minimum and we're way past the unsure
stages. Also, I'm pretty sure she under
stands me well enough to know that I relish
confrontation and would demand some kind
of reasoning.
II The Boldface Lie
For this rather basic mctluKl, some kind
of untruth is presented in place of the cur
rent reality.
You're mackin' down on the futon one
night. Suddenly, she stops. Though she's

really thinking, "Every time I see you I want
to tear out your nose hairs," you only hear
the ruse:
"My long-lost Italian lover has just called
me from Florence," she claims, "and he's
coming to move in with me."
"Do you think he'd mind me staying over
from time to time?"
You didn't quite get it. And so the poor
lass must think on her feet. "I need to spend
more time alone with my cat."
"Hey, trim hor claws and bring her to bed
with ya!"
"I don't believe in pre-marital orgasm."
"You don't believe it exists?"
"My asthma makes every lxiut of sex a
dance with death."
"Life's full of risks, baby."
A moment passes. "I have no vagina!"
she declares triumphantly, expecting you'll
want to leave now.
Which you do.
Prediction: I believe I shall lie spared
this method as well. My hoochie has no
capacity for falsehood; her lies are never
believable. Get this: Once, she tried to tell
me she had to cancel a date because she
didn't think she could hold her food down if
I was there. Who could ever fall for such
nonsense?
11l The Speech™
Sometimes 1 think The Speech IM is print

ed on the inside of tampon boxes — it's the
only way the fail-safe sermon could be glob
ally circulated without men ever knowing.
"I don't know how to toll you this," she
begins...
Within a few painful minutes it's all over.
Prediction: No way. My hoochie knows
that I'm hip to the tune of The Speech'" and
that I am quote that bugger line for line bet
ter than she can.
You see, the hist time I thought I'd be
getting dumped, I went and bought myself a
box of Kotex. So when the young woman
with the bad news sat me down and began
with, "I don't know how to tell you this," I
just started reciting, going straight through,
"Really, you're everything I want in a guy
but.. . v , rattling on and on till it's last lying
line: "Of course we'll still spend time
together |A friendly, one-armed hug is
appropriate at this point — do not press too
hard]." Boy, was she surprised.
IV. Cruel to be cruder
This is your basic "oops and sorry"
scheme. Brutal honesty is a courtesy pur
portedly extended to mollify the pain of loss,
but in truth it acts something like a raequet-
Ixdl to the groin.
"I think we should break up," she says.
No explanations are proffered; no chances
for persuasion are given; she's got one hand
in her pocket and the other one is sharpen

ing a bowie knife.
Still, you give it a shot. "Buy why?"
"Honestly?" she asks. She smiles, know
ing the trap is set.
And you, like a schmuck, say, "Yes."
"Because I'm not nearly as attracted to
you as I am to the guy in my Stats section
who offered to take my midterm for me if I
go out with him."
And that's it. And you can't even argue
because you, like a schmuck, asked for it.
Prediction: Knowing what I know of
my hoochie, I think she'll go with some form
of this one. Like tearing off a Band-Aid in
one swoop and grimace: direct, honest,
awful.
It's her way.
It kind of reminds me of how we met —
how she stomped on my foot with the heel of
her black stiletto and said, "Oh well, now
that you ain't walk I guess I'll have to carry
you back to my place."
Which she did.
Ah, but reminiscing might very well be
superfluous now. It's probably only a mat
ter of moments before some taller, buffer
yutz with that Cool Guy Hair™ that falls
over one eye and just hangs there, swoops
in, asks her if she'd like a Shiatsu and, thus,

pushes her off that teetering edge.
But then again, maybe her fetish
for balding men still extends past

Picard and into me. Maybe I'm just
oozing with insecurity because my
winter-pudge is hitting Cabbage
Patch proportions. Maybe I'm just
not getting enough calcium.
Who knows? Either way I 'm pre
pared now.
Wish me luck.
