## Ozone regeneration a possibility Three Major Forces of Ozone Formation 
### Alison Davis Contributing writer 
What would happen if the ozone layer
completely disappeared? How long would it
take to reform?
Surprisingly — "about 95-98 percent
would regenerate in about nine months,"
said Asst. Prof. Mark Jacobson, of the
department of Civil Engineering. Jacobson
predicts this information based on a comput
er model which he has been developing.

is capable of simulating ozone depletion and
reformation processes across the globe, as well
as various other atmospheric conditions.
According to Jacobson, the stratospheric
ozone layer shields the earth from solar-gen
erated ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which
would be lethal to all flora and fauna —
everything from phytoplankton to humans.
Over the last 20 years, this protective
ozone barrier has been slowly chipped away,
leaving earth lings at increased risk of radia
tion exposure from the powerful sun that
looms over the stratosphere.
Both natural and unnatural processes
contribute to the degeneration of the ozone
layer. The main culprits are a group of ele
ments called the halogens, namelv chlorine.

Although chlorine is produced naturally
from oceans and volcanoes, the biggest con
cern is with man-made chlorine, arising from
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions. As
we've all heard, well-known sources of CFCs
include aerosols, refrigerants and by-prod
ucts of certain industrial processes.
Just how do CFCs and chlorine destroy
stratospheric ozone? CFCs themselves are
harmless. Higher up in the atmosphere (clos
er to the sun) however, UV radiation reacts
chemically with CFCs to produce chlorine —

deplete ozone.

According to Jacob
son, one aim of the model was

to predict the maximum amount of

time required to reform the ozone layer

wiiiiV/ i vtjmi vu ww tiiw wtinic iajci
from scratch. In order to do that, he had to
make a few key assumptions — the complete
absence of both ozone and chlorine in the
atmosphere.
Then, he asked, "How long does [the
ozone] take to regenerate? To my surprise, it
didn't take long at all," Jacobson said. Near
ly all of the ozone reformed within nine
months.
"But removing chlorine is not trivial," he
cautioned. Most importantly, Jacobson's pre
liminary results give insight into the scientif
ic processes that are involved in ozone forma
tion.
What makes the model unique? The major
advance is that Jacobson's model incorpo
rates several different chemical and physical

parameters dynamically, or three-dimension
ally.
The major forces which govern the forma
tion of the stratospheric ozone layer — chem
ical, radiative and transport processes — are
coupled together in a dynamic fashion.
The chemistry arm of the model concerns
the production of ozone from reacting oxygen
and UV radiation. But the actual positioning
of the ozone shield is also dependent on con
tinually changing transport processes —
mostly due to wind.

Wind moves ozone gas away from its site
)f formation — near the equator where the

sun is closest to the earth. The net effect is
the creation of an ozone blanket over the
planet.
In reality, each of these processes affect
each other, but previous computer simula
tions were unable to integrate all the pro
cesses at one time. "Up until recently, com
puters were too sluggish," Jacobson said.
Even so, the simulation Jacobson ran to
analyze ozone depletion took 25 days to com
plete. That's using a Cray mini-supercom
puter at Stanford which is about five times
slower than the fastest Cray supercomputer,
he said.
Aside from the interesting preliminary
conclusions that can be drawn from the
model about the forces involved in ozone
depletion and reformation, Jacobson can also
use the model to study other scientific issues.
For example, Jacobson is currently using
the model to investigate the effects of
aerosols on temperature, a scenario in which
he can learn more about urban pollution.
