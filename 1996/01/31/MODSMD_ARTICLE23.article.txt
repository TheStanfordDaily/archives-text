# Throwing money away...
## Lethal pennies 
### Jessen Yu Staff writer 
If you threw a penny off
of (he Empire State
• Building and it hit
someone on the ground, would it
he life-threatening?
A As if the death rate in
• New York isn't high
• enough already, now
they have to worry about —
excuse the expression — pen
nies from heaven.
Seriously though, you'd
think that dropping almost any
thing off something that tall
would be pretty lethal to those
walking bv below. If you were
geekv enough, you might have
even gone home from a visit to
the Empire State Building and
tried to apply your knowledge of
physics to see how fast the
penny would be going when it
reached the bottom. For those of
you who haven't visited the
Empire State Building, but
would still like to show off your
geekiness anyhow, the building
is 1250 feet, or 380 meters, tall.
And so in the end. you might
have figured that the penny
should be going around 200
miles per hour when it hits the
ground. Furthermore, you prob
ably thought to yourself, "Boy,
that's fast!"
Well, you'd be wrong. A
penny dropped off of the Empire
State Building won't even get
close to falling that fast. Why?
Because of air resistance. Air
resistance not only prevents
parachuters from plummeting
to their deaths, it also keeps
pennies 112 rom achieving extreme
speeds when they fall.
The drag force from air resis
tance pushes against a moving
object in the opposite direction
of its movement. In this case,
since most things fall down, the
drag force pushes upwards on
the penny, slowing its descent.
The drag force also pushes pro
portionally to the speed of the
object, so the faster an object
goes, the more drag force it feels.
As the object picks up speed, the
drag force increases and eventu
ally it reaches a velocity where
the drag force counteracts the
force of gravity. At this point, the
object no longer picks up speed,
but instead falls to the ground at
a constant velocity. This speed is
called the terminal velocity.
So. the question we need
answered here is, "What is the
terminal velocity of a penny —
and could it kill someone?"
There are a few ways of cal

culating the effects of air resis
tance and terminal velocity, but
they really aren't that accurate.
Using some simplified formulas
and crude estimates, I came up
with a theoretical estimate of
the terminal velocity of a penny,
about 20 miles per hour. Of
course, theory can only go so far.
The theory of a floating dirigible

filled with hydrogen was well
founded, but look where that
got the Hindenhurg.
I had to do an experiment. By
attaching a penny to a string
and holding the string out the
window of a moving car, not
only could I draw attention to
myself, but I also got a rough
estimate of the terminal velocity
of the penny. The speed of the
car when the string was at a 45
degree angle with the ground
should have been about the
same as the terminal velocity.
When the string is at this angle,
the force on the penny due to air
resistance should be equal to
the force of gravity on it, which
are the same conditions that
apply to a penny traveling at
terminal velocity.
So, with my penny on a
string and my roommate's car,
we determined that the termi
nal velocity of' a penny is about
25 miles per hour, pretty darn
close to my theoretical estimate.
Feeling all happy about myself, I
decided to try the next obvious
experiment — finding the ter
minal velocity of a quarter,
which came out to about 35
miles per hour. We would have
gone on and done more experi
ments with currency on strings,
but we ran into a stumbling
block when we couldn't get our
hands on one of the large stone
coins of the Yap Islanders.
The point is, for a penny
dropped from any building on
earth, the greatest speed it can
achieve is about 25 miles per
hour. People can throw coins
faster than that. There's more
of a chance that you'll die in a
Nerf related accident than get
killed by a falling coin.
Just be glad that they don't
have any skyscrapers on the
Island of Yap.
