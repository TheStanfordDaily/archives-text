# 'Infecting' cells with a virus: a new form of treatment
## Medical Center researchers develop new gene therapy for cystic fibrosis patients 
### Joe Westersund 
A team led by Dr. Phyllis Gardner and Dr. John Wag
ner of the Medical Center is now conducting the first
phase of testing of a new gene therapy treatment for cys
tic fibrosis. Three patients out of the six in the trial have
received the first dose of the drug, which uses the adeno
associated virus (AAV) as the base for a viral vector to
"infect" cells in the maxillary sinuses with healthy ver
sions of the gene that carries cystic fibrosis. After receiv
ing the first dose in one maxillary sinus, the patients will
be monitored for a month and then receive a different
dose in the other sinus.
Using the AAV virus is a step forward for gene thera
py, and hopefully will avert some of the problems that
previous attempts at CF gene therapy encountered. Ear
lier trials used the adenovirus, one of the viruses that
causes the common cold, as the vehicle to insert healthy
genes. The adenovirus, even with its replication genes
removed, tends to cause symptoms like fever and stuffy
lungs. And the adenovirus viral vector contains enough
adenovirus DNA to cause cells to make viral proteins.
These foreign proteins are recognized by the immune
system, which subsequently kills off the cells that had
just been implanted with the healthy CF gene.
CF is a deadly genetic disease that affects about
30,000 Americans and is carried without symptoms by
about one in every 23 people. It is a recessive disease, so
two defective genes, one from the father and one Irom
the mother, must both be present in order for CF to be
expressed.
AAV has several characteristics that should help
avoid the problems encountered with the adenovirus.
AAV, as its name suggests, normally appears in associa
tion with the adenovirus. AAV is much smaller than the
adenovirus (5,000 DNA base pairs as opposed to 40,000)
and cannot reproduce itself without the help of the ade
novirus. Alone, AAV causes no disease in humans.
Viral vectors must contain enough original viral
genetic material to allow the healthy genes to be
implanted, but not enough to allow the virus to repro
duce or cause reactions in the body. The adenovirus has
codes for its viral protein spread in different parts of its
DNA, making it very difficult to cut out all of these sec
tions without making the viral vector totally ineffective.
AAV is much simpler than adenovirus, and almost all of
its genetic material can be replaced with the healthy CF
gene.
Because the viral vector must be made unable to

replicate itself, one AAV vector is required for each sinus
cell that is to be genetically altered. Luckily, only about
5 or 10 percent of the cells must be changed in order to
see improvement. Wagner, the administrator of the
trial, hopes to be able to change about one quarter of the
sinus cells.
Periodic treatments with the vector will be necessary,
because the cells that are treated die off naturally over
time. In earlier trials with monkeys, treatments were
necessary about every six months. Wagner suspects that
the frequency might be similar for humans.
The current AAV trial is in phase one, which tests
increasing doses in a total of six patients to test for safe
ty. Phase two is likely to begin sometime in April, and
will test the effectiveness and safety of the treatment in
about 50 patients.
The Stanford study is being done in parallel with a
Johns Hopkins University study testing the same viral
vector on the lungs rather than sinus tissue.
Though CF poses much more of a threat in the lungs,
testing the new drug in the sinuses allows for less inva
sive application of the drug and monitoring of progress,
and, since there are two maxillary sinuses, one below
each eye, each patient can in effect act as their own con
trol. If successful in the sinuses, the treatment would be
likely to also work in the lungs
Though much simpler than treatment in the lungs,
the sinus treatment does present hardships for the
patients. Each dose requires an overnight stay in the
hospital and requires patients to bleach their bodily
secretions for four days until lab tests can verify that the
virus isn't spreading in their body.
Genetic treatments must pass through even bigger
bureaucratic obstacles than conventional drugs. This
study had to be approved by Stanford's Biosafety and
Human Subject committees, then went on to the Food
and Drug Administration and a Recombinant I)NA
Advisory Committee. This is one of the reasons, accord
ing to Wagner, it will likely be "not tomorrow, and not
next year" that a genetic treatment for CF gets official
approval.
The CF gene contains the code for a protein called the
Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR),
which helps control the flow of chloride ions across coll
membranes. Without this protein, a thick buildup of
mucus develops in the sinuses and lungs, leading to
infections and eventually death. The median life of CF
sufferers is now 28 years, though it was only eight years
a.s recently as the 19fi0s.
