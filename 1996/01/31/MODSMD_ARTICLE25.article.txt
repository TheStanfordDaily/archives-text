## Men's hoops set for Cal showdown 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
It seems fitting that the first
half of the Pacific 10 Conference
schedule should end by pitting
Stanford against California in
front of a sold-out Maples Pavil
ion.
Armed with nearly identical
records — the Cardinal is 11-5
overall, 5-3 in Pac-10 play, the
Bears 11-5, 6-2 — the two teams
get a chance to set the tone for
the rest of the season tonight at
7:30 p.m. That tone could depend
greatly on how Stanford tackles
the unenviable chore of defending
Cal freshman Shareef Abdur-
Rahim.
"Shareefs the most talented
big man in the league," said head
coach Mike Montgomery. "He can
take it at you on the break or
work from the high post extend
ed. His quickness causes prob
lems."
The 6-foot-10 Abdur-Rahim
leads the Pac-10 in scoring at 23.9
points per game and also grabs
8.3 rebounds per contest (third in
the conference). On top of that,
he has quick hands and plays
passing lanes well enough to lead
the conference in steals (2.5 per
game).
"What makes him good is his
ability to finish plays," said senior
Andy Poppink, who gets the call
defensively against Abdur-
Rahim. "It's not necessarily
because of his outstanding athlet
ic ability. Hopefully, the [defen
sive] help will come from a couple
different places. We just have to
make sure he's not free to run all
over the place."
Montgomery's decision to put
Poppink on Abdur-Rahim frees
up senior Darren Allaway to help
on double-teams, a strength of
Allaway's game, according to
Montgomery.
If Abdur-Rahim puts the ball
on the floor in the low post,
expect quick help from the

perimeter in double-teaming,
according to senior David Har
bour.
"Everybody's going to rotate
and zone up the backside when
we go to double-team him," Har
bour said. "We want the ball out
of ShareePs hands as much as
possible. The key will be how well
we are able to rotate once he kicks
it out. We don't think he'll kick it
out that much — he likes to
shoot."
Despite Abdur-Rahim's over
whelming presence on the court,
Montgomery warned about focus
ing too much on one playe, only to
be beaten by the rest of Cal's tal
ented team.
"We don't want to give every
body else numbers they shouldn't
have," he said. "(Edl Gray comes
in a-firing — there are some
games where he's scored nine in a
row — and then you add
Tremaine Fowlkes to the whole
thing."
Fowlkes, out for the first 14
games of the season for illegally
accepting money from an agent,
returned last Thursday night
against Washington State. In his
two games this year, he averaged
13.5 points, seven rebounds and
25 minutes per game.
Gray, a transfer from Ten
nessee by way of the College of
Southern Idaho, averages 17.0
points in the sixth-man role for
the Bears. Like Abdur-Rahim, he
has a definite shoot-first, pass
second mentality — the two have
taken 250 shots in 16 games and
dished out only 41 assists. Cal is
10-0 when Gray scores 19 points
or more.
While Cal's backcourt hasn't
put up big offensive numbers
with the exception of Gray, the
trio of Randy Duck, Prentice
McGruder and Anwar McQueen
have worked hard to steady an
offense with so many potential
scorers.

Freshman Peter Sauer lays it up and in during the men's win over
Oregon State Jan. 20.
"Gray's the only guy we'll have
to worry about until they prove
otherwise," Harbour said.
While Duck's scoring has
increased from last year, Mont
gomery noted that it looks like
Duck has become much more of a
leader on the court, looking to shoot
less and distribute the ball more.
The one element lost in this
discussion is the play of inconsis

tent guard .Jelani Gardner, last
year's main point guard for Cal.
Gardner has bounced around the
lineup, starting six games at point
and six games at shooting guard.
He missed the road trip to Wash
ington last weekend because of ill
ness and may or may not start,
depending on whether Cal coach
Todd Bozeman wants t< go big or
small.
"They can have so many line
ups," Montgomery said. "You
could drive yourself batty trying
to figure out what they'll do at
any triven time."

Like most teams, Cal loses
when it has trouble shooting. In
five losses, the Bears were held to
40.H percent shooting. In their 11
wins, they shot 49.3 percent from
the field.
Stanford, third in the confer
ence in field-goal percentage
defense, is allowing opponents to
shoot only 41.7 percent from the
field.
Last year, the Cardinal swept
Cal for the first time since the
1987-88 season. Stanford won 78-
73 at Berkeley and 83-70 at
Maples.
