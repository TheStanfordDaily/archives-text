# Women's gymanstics falls to UCLA, Arizona
## Fourth-ranked Bruins, No. 7 'Cats hold off No. 13 Cardinal 
### Keith Rabkin Contributing writer 
In its Pacific 10 Conference opener in Tuscon
last Saturday, the 13th-ranked Stanford
women's gymnastics team fell to both No. 7 Ari
zona and the defending Pac-10 champion UCLA.
The Wildcats won the meet by defeating both the
No. 4 Bruins and the Cardinal with a score of
192.600. The loss dropped the Cardinal's overall
record to 1-2.
The match was close, however. UCLA, which
totaled 191.350, only beat the Cardinal by three
tenths of a point. This slim margin of defeat
pleased the Cardinal.
"We were in striking distance of UCI.A," said
sophomore Keri Monahan. "We felt good know
ing that we could compete with the best the Pac
-10 has to offer."
Stanford remained competitive on the floor,
vault and uneven bars, but could not rally to win
the team. While they tied for the win on the bars,
their trouble on beam landed the Cardinal gym

nasts a second-place finish.
Arizona was outstanding, with freshman
Heidi Hornbeek taking first place in the vault
with a 9.90 and senior Jessica Marshall placing
second with 9.775. Hornbeek's fine all-around
performance allowed her to capture second in the
overall standings. The Wildcats also captured the
uneven bars and placed second in both the floor
and the beam.
The Bruins were also impressive, placing first
in the floor exercise and balance beam. Junior
Leah Homma led UCI.A by taking third on the
vault and first on the beam, enough to capture
first place overall for the competition.
The Cardinal did post some outstanding indi
vidual performances. Star freshman Amy
Murakami won her second routine of the year by
capturing first place on the bars. Murakami also
finished third on the vault. Freshman Tracey
Kohl put up her best performance of the year wit h
a score of 38.375, second on the Cardinal squad.
Monahan had a great all-around outing, plac
ing third all-around with a 38.625 and marking

the second straight time she has placed in the top
three all-around competitors. Sophomore Misty
Moore finished third on the beam with a score of
9.675.
While the Cardinal's performance was disap
pointing compared to last week's win against
unranked UC-Davis, Stanford gymnasts are
proud of themselves for performing so well
against much tougher opposition.
"UCLA is one of the best teams in the country,
so for us to finish so close shows our skill," Mon
ahan said. Not only did the Cardinal nearly beat
the Bruins, hut it scored a season-high 191.05
points.
Head coach Lisa Izzi and the Cardinal now
have two weeks to sharpen their skills before fly
ing East to face Georgia. The team will focus on
individual parts of routines, fine-tuning small
sections of performances so that it can be domi
nant against the Bulldogs, a top-five team in
1995. The team will definitely focus on the beam
to pinpoint the problems which kept Stanford out
of contention this weekend.
