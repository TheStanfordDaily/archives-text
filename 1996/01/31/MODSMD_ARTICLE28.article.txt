The fourth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team stared
into the eye of the Pacific Tigers
last night in its league opener in
Stockton. By the end of the
match, the Tigers were reduced
to mere kittens, falling to the
Cardinal in three straight
games 15-8, 15-5, 15-11. Stan
ford improved greatly from its
match against California last
weekend, getting strong outside
hitting from sophomore Tad
Hoffman and junior Matt Fuer
bringer and simply better team
hitting overall.
"It was more even than I
thought, but we got solid pass
ing from Hoffman and Fuer
bringer," said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves. "That
allowed us to run our offense."
Despite what the three-game
sweep suggests, Pacific put up a

fierce battle early on. The Tigers
were able to forge a 3-3 tie and
forced the Cardinal spikers to
lose their serves on several occa
sions. But then Stanford, riding
the strength of Hoffman and
Fuerbringer, ran off a streak of
points that swung the momen
tum in the Cardinal's favor for
the rest of the first game. Stan
ford used its 16 first-game kills
to finish off the Tigers 15-8 and
take a one-game lead.
The second game saw the
Cardinal get out of the blocks
quickly and never fall back with
in reach of the Tigers. "The sec
ond game was probably our eas
iest game of the night," Nieves
said. "We got ahead early and
made nice plays. It was also our
best sideout game."
The Cardinal also displayed
solid hitting and passing, reflect
ed in its .405 hitting percentage.
In 37 attempts, the Cardinal
executed 19 kills while only com
mitting four errors. Stanford's
defense was also solid, as it held
Pacific to a match-low .170 hit
ting percentage as well as forced
the Tigers into 11 errors.
