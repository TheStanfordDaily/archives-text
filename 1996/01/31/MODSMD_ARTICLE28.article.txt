The fourth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team stared
into the eye of the Pacific Tigers
last night in its league opener in
Stockton. By the end of the
match, the Tigers were reduced
to mere kittens, falling to the
Cardinal in three straight
games 15-8, 15-5, 15-11. Stan
ford improved greatly from its
match against California last
weekend, getting strong outside
hitting from sophomore Tad
Hoffman and junior Matt Fuer
bringer and simply better team
hitting overall.
"It was more even than I
thought, but we got solid pass
ing from Hoffman and Fuer
bringer," said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves. "That
allowed us to run our offense."
Despite what the three-game
sweep suggests, Pacific put up a

fierce battle early on. The Tigers
were able to forge a 3-3 tie and
forced the Cardinal spikers to
lose their serves on several occa
sions. But then Stanford, riding
the strength of Hoffman and
Fuerbringer, ran off a streak of
points that swung the momen
tum in the Cardinal's favor for
the rest of the first game. Stan
ford used its 16 first-game kills
to finish off the Tigers 15-8 and
take a one-game lead.
The second game saw the
Cardinal get out of the blocks
quickly and never fall back with
in reach of the Tigers. "The sec
ond game was probably our eas
iest game of the night," Nieves
said. "We got ahead early and
made nice plays. It was also our
best sideout game."
The Cardinal also displayed
solid hitting and passing, reflect
ed in its .405 hitting percentage.
In 37 attempts, the Cardinal
executed 19 kills while only com
mitting four errors. Stanford's
defense was also solid, as it held
Pacific to a match-low .170 hit
ting percentage as well as forced
the Tigers into 11 errors.
Pacific's top two players, junior

Greg Wakeham and sophomore
Martin Berkencamp, were also
continually bottled up by Stan
ford's blocking schemes. Wakeham
committed nine errors on his way
to a .205 hitting percentage while
Berkencamp fared only slightly
better, posting a .323 hitting per
centage. "I felt good about how we
contained them, especially Wake
ham," Nieves said. "They had a
solid night, but they didn't go
nuts."
Momentum was clearly in Stan
ford's corner entering the third
game. While the Stanford spikers
were circling for the kill, Tiger
head coach Joe Wort man looked to
his bench for a momentum-snatch
ing substitution. The Tigers
brought in senior outside hitter
Tim Lennon, sophomore middle
blocker lan Cresno and freshman
setter KeAlii Alexander. "Those
three subs really gave them fresh
blood and it helped get them
going," Nieves said.
No sooner were these substitu
tions made that the ('ardinal found
itself back on the bench in the
midst of a timeout and a 4-1 deficit.
"I basically told them that Pacific
had gone through a good spell of
play," Nieves said. "I told them to
stay poised and get right back into
it. We had them down, and we
wanted to keep them down."
As it had done all season, the
Cardinal went back to its three
blocker attack to rip off a strong
run. Pacific's lead became a hit
more tenuous and Stanford finally
caught up and ti<>d the score at
nine. The Cardinal inched ahead to
get on the verge of match point
before Pacific made one last futile
run. But Stanford's 28 kills in
game three were too much to over
come as the ('ardinal closed the
door on a three game sweep.
Fuerbringer bounced back from
his uncharacteristically poor Cal
fiasco to register 11 kills in 24

attempts, while Hoffman finished
his career night with 11 kills and
no errors in his 16 attempts.
"[Fuerbringer] bounced back

nicely," Nieves said. "It's not the
Matt Fuerbringer that Stanford
fans see play, but he's improving
game by game, week by week."
