The Winter Cup is a precursor
to the Olympic Trials in June, and
the seven gymnasts that earn a

World Championships later this
year.
Stanford will send juniors
Keith Wiley and Jamie Ellis and
sophomore Tim Dalrymple from
the current team, and graduates
Jair Lynch, Mark Booth, Josh
Stein and Kyle Asano, all of whom
served on Stanford's NCAA
