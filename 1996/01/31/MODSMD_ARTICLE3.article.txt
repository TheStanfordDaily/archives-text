# Ultimatum on CSRE hiring
## CSAAS presents demands to dean 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
A group of Asian-American stu
dents has issued an ultimatum to
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
•John Shoven, threatening to pub
licly boycott the fledgling Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity
program if their needs are not met.
In a memo delivered to Shoven
on Monday, a copy of which was ob
tained by The Daily, the Concerned
Students for Asian American Stud
ies demanded that Asian-American
students and faculty receive a loud
er voice in CSRE hiring and decision
making, and that chosen Asian
American Studies faculty teach half
their classes in Asian American
Studies, instead of focusing solely on
work in the departments in which
they were hired.
Faculty for the interdisciplinary
programs are currently expected to
be based in existing departments. It
has not yet been made clear how
many ethnic studies classes they
will teach in addition to their de
partmental work.
In addition, the memo demanded
that Shoven hire a senior Asian
American Studies professor bv the

end of the next school year and that
tenure decisions for professors in
Asian American Studies be based on
qualifications in the field, in addi
tion to the discipline for which they
are hi rod.

The memo also
stated that posi
tions should be
advertised specifi
cally as openings
for Asian Ameri
can Studies schol
ars — not for
CSRE faculty, as
they are currently
publicized.

Failure to commit in writing to
the demands by noon on Friday will
result in a public boycott of CSRE by
students representing ethnic cen
ters and a "national campaign con
cerning this boycott," the memo
said.
"The existing set of hiring proce
dures is not working to the benefit of
Asian American Studies," wrote
graduate student LokSiu andjunior
Kris Hayashi.
In a written statement issued to
The Dailv vesterdav, Havashi and


Shoven
Siu said they are hopeful an agree
ment can be reached s<x)n which
does not compromise the quality of
CSRE.
"Our primary goal is to help es
tablish a cutting-edge Asian Amer
ican Studies and Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity pro
gram at Stanford University,"
they said. "Our demands are writ
ten in the spirit of making the
CSRE a competitive and reputable
program that students, faculty
and the administration can be
proud of."
Shoven yesterday appeared re
luctant to acquiesce. He reiterated
statements he made at last Thurs
day's Faculty Senate meeting that
departments will decide faculty bil
lets and outside groups will have no
"veto power."
"There are some elements (of the
memo) that simply cannot be ac
commodated," Shoven said, adding
that he had not decided how he will
respond, beyond offering his cooper
ation.
Specifically, CSAAS — with
support from the Black Student
Union, the Stanford American In
dian Organization and "members
of the Chicana / o student commu
nity" — asked in their memo that a
steering committee be created con
sisting of four professors and two
students, with remaining members
determined by Asian American
Studies faculty. The committee
would have the authority to review
files of candidates and evaluate
them.
According to conditions laid out
in the memo, no appointments are
to be made without support from
the steering committee.
The creation of CSRE — an in
terdisciplinary program which will
offer specializations in Chicano
Studies. Asian American Studies.

African and Afro-American Studies
and individualized concentrations
— resulted from student activism
near the end of the 1994 academic
year. Currently, Shoven is seeking
faculty within existing departments
to teach CSRE-related courses. In
addition, some departments with
openings are targeting professors
proficient in CSRE when searching
for new hires.
The prospective sociology ap
pointment of University of Chicago
doctoral student Grace Kao led last
week to open dissent by CSAAS,
members of whom complained that
the candidate lacked enough experi
ence in Asian American Studies.
Kao declined the position.
Searches for faculty with dual
proficiencies are now underway in
political science, history, English
and sociology, Shoven said.
Hi- added that he will take the
student demands seriously and has
solicited advice from other members
of the administration.
"The reason we take it seriously
is that we have the potential for a
very good program," he said. "Also,
we have the potential for blowing a
very good program. Hut I want to
emphasize the positive."
Both sides are concerned that
negative publicity about the dis
agreement could jeopardize the
quality of the program and its facul
ty-
"l hope the internal controversy
doesn't harm our chances to hire
outstanding people," Shoven said.
Shoven met yesterday with His
tory Prof. A 1 Camarillo, head of the
executive committee which is over
seeing the implementation of the
CSRE program, to discuss the
threats.
"I'm going to rely on his commit
tee to give me some advice on how to
deal with (this) situation," Shoven
said.
Members of the CSRE commit
tee, each of whom received copies of
the memo, are currently consider
ing responses.
