# Ultimatum on CSRE hiring
## CSAAS presents demands to dean 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
A group of Asian-American stu
dents has issued an ultimatum to
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
•John Shoven, threatening to pub
licly boycott the fledgling Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity
program if their needs are not met.
In a memo delivered to Shoven
on Monday, a copy of which was ob
tained by The Daily, the Concerned
Students for Asian American Stud
ies demanded that Asian-American
students and faculty receive a loud
er voice in CSRE hiring and decision
making, and that chosen Asian
American Studies faculty teach half
their classes in Asian American
Studies, instead of focusing solely on
work in the departments in which
they were hired.
Faculty for the interdisciplinary
programs are currently expected to
be based in existing departments. It
has not yet been made clear how
many ethnic studies classes they
will teach in addition to their de
partmental work.
In addition, the memo demanded
that Shoven hire a senior Asian
American Studies professor bv the

end of the next school year and that
tenure decisions for professors in
Asian American Studies be based on
qualifications in the field, in addi
tion to the discipline for which they
are hi rod.

The memo also
stated that posi
tions should be
advertised specifi
cally as openings
for Asian Ameri
can Studies schol
ars — not for
CSRE faculty, as
they are currently
publicized.

Failure to commit in writing to
the demands by noon on Friday will
result in a public boycott of CSRE by
students representing ethnic cen
ters and a "national campaign con
cerning this boycott," the memo
said.
"The existing set of hiring proce
dures is not working to the benefit of
Asian American Studies," wrote
graduate student LokSiu andjunior
Kris Hayashi.
