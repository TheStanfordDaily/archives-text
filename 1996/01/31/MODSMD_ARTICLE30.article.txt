# A 						sports lover looks back on ups and downs of editorship
## 
### 
It began 15 weeks ago, and despite the
work load, I, like my partner, will have
trouble letting go of the reigns of edi
torship. Throughout my tenure, I have
experienced the highs and lows, the peaks
and valleys, the ups and downs. Yes, to be
cliche, it has been one large roller coaster,
and I would like to share the drops, loops,
twists and turns with you.
With my first couple columns, I was
introduced to the phenomenon I hesitate to
call Daily Fame. I found myself looking
familiar to people I was introduced to for
the first time (from my mug shot). One girl
I met said to me, "Don't you write for The
Daily?" I consistently ended up in argu
ments and discussions about my columns
at parties and social events. It was only the
precursor to what I was about to experience
throughout Volume 208.
Early in fall quarter, I bashed the Stan
ford student body for complaining about
ticket prices. The day my column appeared
in the paper, I received a thank-you e-mail
from Earl Koberlein in the basketball
office. It was a friendly note thanking me
for the support and asking me to let him
know if he could do anything for me. Since
I figured free tickets was a bit inappropri
ate after the column, I thought a shooting
guard position seemed reasonable.
In another column, I wrote, "Spectacu
lar stunts, but all for not." Later that day, I
received another e-mail from a dedicated,
yet obsessive reader, pointing out that the
correct grammar actually mandated the
word "naught" instead of "not." An inter
esting tidbit, don't you think?
In a very early issue of The Daily, I was
forced to whip a cycling article together.
After speaking with two members of the
team and looking over the results of their

races, I wrote the article. The following
day, I was told that the article made the
team sound too good and that no one would
come out for the team. I guess the truth
really hurts sometimes.
Dan and I managed to survive the Jour
nalist Jinx. Despite the fact that the Cardi-

nal dropped one to San Francisco at the
Cow Palace in the week that we both picked
it to dominate, most of our predictions have
come true. The Bulls are 39-3 and the Cow
boys won the Super Bowl. Not bad, huh?
Still, Stanford ends our volume without a
national championship, a fact which I am
not proud of at all.
I also mentioned in the same Stanford
hoops article that no one doubts that this
team has the potential of being the best
team this campus has ever seen. A Stan
ford alumnus took the time out to send
me some clippings of Stanford hoops his
tory as counter-evidence to that state
ment. I appreciated that reaction as much
as any that I got all volume, seeing that
someone actually backed up something
they firmly believed. Thank you for the
education, sir.

1 may have been rash, auda
cious and arrogant with my predic
tions, but despite that, I was pret
ty damn clairvoyant. Like I said,
the Bulls are 39-3 and on their way
to glory just as 1 prescribed in
"Bulls to get Finals Airtime." No
one can say that the Niners and
the Cowboys dominated the NFL
as they have in years past. The
Niners did not even make it to the
conference championship this sea
son, as the Packers seem to be just
one of the teams that finally
caught up to the 49ers. The Cow
boys did win the Super Bowl, but
without two belated Christmas
presents from Steeler quarterback
Neil O' Donnell, the AFC just
might have broken out of a serious
slump. Phoenix Suns' rookie

Michael Finley indeed, just as I
predicted, the sleeper of the ('lass
of 1995-96.
The low point of the volume
came just recently, as I was
named "dimwitted at best' by
another dedicated fan alter my
infamous academics versus atli
letics column. While I must
agree that I took that issue way
too far, it was not for the rea
sons that my favorite Ph. I),
candidate pointed out. The
established genius gifted-ath
lete comparisons fell apart as
quickly as the Orlando Magic in
a road game. Yes, there is a <lil
fere nee between the contribu
tions of Jonas Salk to t he world
and t hose of Kevin (larnet t
What can I say? I'm not a role
model, kids. I was wa\ ofl on
t hat one.
One of my proudest achieve
ments as sports editor was set
ting a Daily record when I got
the sports section ofl I he produc

tion table at 9:30 p.m. Of course,
t he headlines were spelled wrong
the next day, but at least 1 got a
good night's sleep.
It has been a glorious run,
but it has come to an end. Sports
Illustrated even bid Dan and I
adieu this week, providing us
with the most fitting issue for
us to finish our volume with.
The swimsuit issue is always a
nice gesture, but the SI budget
also included features on the
Hulls and the Cowboys. Thanks,
guys. We'll miss you too.
This is not good-bye, howev
er. Dry your eyes, ladies and gen
tlemen, I shall return in June.
I he Finals will begin and I will
be back to say I told you so.
Truthfully, all the responses,
reactions and arguments were
exciting for me. Whether you
agreed with me or not, you were
reading, and for a sports lover
who loves to hear himself talk,
that's what it's all about.
