### Molly Stephens Staff writer 
An elderly man was found dead last week in a field
near the Environmental Safety Facility off Oak
Road.
The man, identified as 70-year-old Menlo Park
resident Matthew Ninkovich, was reported missing
from his Vine St. residence on Jan. 14. The San
Mateo County Sheriffs Department took the miss
ing person's report.
A San Mateo detective said Ninkovich, who had a
history of mental problems, had recently discovered
that he was suffering from a terminal illness and was
feeling depressed.
Police knew that Ninkovich liked the Stanford

area, the detective said, and a full-scale search of the
area from Campus Drive to Menlo Park was coordi
nated on Jan. 19.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said volun
teers from the San Mateo and Santa Clara County
search and rescue teams met at the Environmental
Safety Facility for a search which began at 10 a.m.
and ended 15 minutes later with the discovery of
Ninkovich's body.
Niemeyer said police found no indications of foul
play.
"He had been out there for some period of time,"
Niemeyer said. "With the weather, he may have be
come disoriented."
Police will not know the cause of death until the
coroner completes a report, Niemeyer added.
