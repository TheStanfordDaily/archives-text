Mae Jemison, the
first black woman
to go into space,
will address the
Class of 1996 as
Commencement
speaker.

Jemison, who earned a dual un
dergraduate degree from Stanford
in 1977, has had a broad-ranging
career in research and medicine.
"She's someone who shows that
no matter what race or gender you
are, you can accomplish some
thing," said Senior Class President
Aaron Lehman, who helped select
Jemison as the speaker.
Jemison, currently on the facul
ty at Dartmouth College, served as
a general practitioner in Los Ange

as a Peace Corps worker in West
Africa.
In the last two years, she found
ed an international space camp

she has also served as host of the
Discovery Channel program,
"World of Wonder."

"It's important to get everybody
involved in science and technolo

Magazine article. "Space explo
ration is a hook."
In addition, Jemison has helped
promote the study of environmen

both among academics and
through her private foundation,
Jemison Group Inc.
She was named to the faculty of
Dartmouth College in environmen

nology in Developing Countries."
At Stanford's Centennial Cele

keynote speech stressing the Uni

Jemison entered Stanford at age
16 and went on to earn degrees in
chemical engineering and African
and Afro-American Studies. She
studied medicine at Cornell Uni
versity and USC.
In 1987, NASA selected her
from among 2,000 applicants to
train to be an astronaut. She flew
