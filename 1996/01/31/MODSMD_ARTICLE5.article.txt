### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Offering both praise and criticism to Dean of
Students Marc Wais, about 15 concerned students
met last night to discuss how the I Iniversity should
respond to a report identifyingthe needs of lesbian,
gay and bisexual students at Stanford.
Both Wais and students suggested possible
courses of action in an exchange that lasted about
an hour. Students ;ilso challenged Wais to answer
questions related to his official response to the re
port issued by the Working Group on Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Student Needs, which was released
last March.
Among other things, the report called for more
academic role models for lesbian, gay and bisexual
students and for a full-time director of the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center.
High on the agenda last night was the limited
funding currently available to the center, im-

proved disabled access and the
need for a full-time center direc
tor.
Students also stressed that dia
logue with other parts of the Uni
versity, specifically academic and
athletics departments, is crucial to
the report's success.
Responding to the need for im
proved disabled access, Wais an
nounced plans to assess the facili
ties for all of the community cen
ters. The first of the centers to be
studied, Wais said, will be the

LGBCC.
Three architectural firms are
currently in competition for an
upcoming project to recommend
appropriate means for improving
I he accessibility of each center.
Wais said the current budget
uncertainties in Washington, I).C.
seriously hinder the administra
tion's ability to finance long-term
solutions. "The fact that Stanford
is a strong, highly respected, high
ly invested research institution
means that we are particularly
vulnerable to what goes on in
Washington," Wais said.
Despite the uncertain financial
horizon, Wais said pursuing short
term remedies - in hopes that the

University's financial climate will
improve in the coming years
will likely enable tin* administra
tion to "identify more permanent
solutions" in the future.
"We recognize the desire to
have a more full-time presence" at
the LGBCC, Wais said. One possi
bility he said he will consider is
working with the LGBCC on a
proposal to the Stanford Fund
the portion of the University's
fundraising efforts devoted to im
proving undergraduate life - to
finance a full-time director.
In addition, Wais said a second
year of funding has been approved
to continue the graduate student
internship created this year, one

example of a short-term solution
he hopes will he a stepping stone to
more lasting changes.
John Newsome — community
outreach director for the Haas
Center for Public Service and a
member of the working group that
issued the report — responded
that at Stanford, like at most uni
versities, "money becomes avail
able when the University identi
fies something as a priority."
He reminded Wais that after
the 1993 student protests against
the threat of cutbacks to ethnic
centers, the Provost's Office came
up with $200,000 to give to the
four ethnic centers over two years.
Although most students who

spoke prefaced their remarks wit h
praise for Wais' sensitivity to the
concerns of lesbian, gay and bisex
ual students on campus, several
students raised concerns that
Wais' five-page response was
vague, ignoring the specifics of the
working group's recommenda
tions.
Wais insisted that his response
was not a thorough point-by-point
analysis of the 130-page report,
but rather "a snapshot of where
things currently stand and what
the University is poised to do."
David Bradfute, a first-year law
student who has been involved
with the lesbian, gay and bisexual
community since 1988, said he is

encouraged by Wais' sincere com
mitment to representing the
needs of those students to the rest
of the University. "He's clearly on
our side," he said.
In response to requests that he
solicit institutional follow-ups to
the report, Wais said that within
three weeks, he will contact the
Faculty Senate and various athlet
ic and academic departments with
requests for formal responses to
the report.
Wais said he hopes that receiv
ing feedback from various depart
ments throughout the University
will enable him and the LGBCC to
gauge how well the concerns raised
in the report are being addressed.
