# Burns shares vision of America
## Filmmaker promotes documentaries 
### Jesse Oxfeld Contributing writer 
Acclaimed filmmaker Ken
Burns, the man who created
PBS's "The Civil War" and
"Baseball" documentaries, last
night told a Kresge Auditorium
audience that it is imperative for
America to be cognizant of its
history.
"We Americans tend to ignore
our past," said Burns, wearing a
sweater emblazoned with an
American flag. "It represents
the deepest kind of inattention.
"The meaning of our freedom
as Americans is the freedom to
remember, but it is also an oblig
ation," Burns said in a speech
peppered — like his films
with relevant and often humor
ous quotations.
In his films, Burns said, heat
tempts to show the history of
this country in a way that both
respects that history and allows
current viewers to understand
what it was like to be living in t he
time depicted. They all a.->k the
question, "Who are we?"
Though best known for his
two most reccnt works " The
Civil War," broadcast in Sep
tember 1990 and "Baseball,
broadcast in September 1994
Burns has been working as a
documentary filmmaker since
his graduation from college
in1975. His early films included
"Brooklyn Bridge, Hie Stat
ue of Liberty" and "Huey
Long."
"I must admit that I have, in
many ways, made the same film
over and over again," he said,
noting that they all deal with

similar themes of American his
tory.
His "Baseball" documen
tary, for example, dealt with the
racial issues faced by the coun
try during the times covered by
that film, Burns said. "The
game of baseball became a
prism through which is refract
ed the history of this country,"
he said.
Burns is currently working on
an eight-hour series on the Amer
ican West, to be broadcast on PBS
this fall. "This is the story of one
of the great crossroads of Ameri
can history," he said. It was a
time, he said, that brought out
both the good and the bad in the
American character.
1 le is also working on a series
of biographies of famous Ameri
cans, set to be broadcast on PBS
during 1997. The first will be on
Thomas Jefferson, followed by
programs on the Lewis and
Clark expeditions, Frank Lloyd
Wright and Mark Twain.
Burns' next major project is a
12-hour history of jazz, to be
completed in 2000. "It's Ameri
ca's music," he said. "It reflects
Americans all Americans —
at their best."
When asked after his talk,
part of a university speaking
tour sponsored bv General Mo
tors, what advice he had for a fu
ture documentary filmmaker,
Burns pointed out that his expe
rience was not representative of
the norm.
"When I became a documen
tary filmmaker," he said, "I took
a vow of anonymity and poverty
and have enjoyed neither — hut
that is not usuallv the case."
