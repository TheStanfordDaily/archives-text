Crisis arises in Aegean Sea
A I HENS, Greece (AP) — Warships massed in the eastern
Aegean Sea yesterday, as Greece and Turkey threatened to do
battle over the right to raise the (lag on a rocky outcropping
that is home only to a few goats.
1 he crisis, the worst since the NATO allies nearly went to
war in 1987 over Aegean seabed mineral rights, has been
fueled by news reports in both countries making possession of
the islet a point of national honor.
"The islet of Imia is Greek," Defense Minister Gerasimos
Arsenis insisted yesterday."It is the responsibility of the
armed forces to defend Greek territory, and they are in a posi
tion to defend it."
"We favor peace, but . . . this country doesn't have a single
piece of stone to cede to other countries," countered Premier
Tansu Ciller of Turkey.
Since the conflict started over the weekend, Greece has
sent seven ships to shadow a seven-vessel Turkish force at the
10-acre islet, made up of rock clusters inhabited only by a
small goat herd.
Early yesterday, Turkey placed soldiers on one of the rock
clusters in retaliation for Greece taking the same action on
Monday, the Turkish foreign minister, Deniz Baykal, said.
Nine Greek soldiers remained on part of the islet. Accord
ing to private Turkish TV channel 1), 20 Turkish navy com
mandos had reached a rock across from the Greeks.
Turkish and Greek fighter jets chased each other in the sky
over the rocks yesterday, twice engaging in air duels meant to
drive out the opponent, said Nikos Kouris, Greece's deputy
defense minister.
Muppets hit Moscow
MOSCOW (AP) — Bert and Ernie are learning Russian.
Soon to be known as Vlas and Enik, they and other Sesame
Street characters will help teach a new generation of Russian
children to live in a free, democratic society.
Producers revealed their plans yesterday for a Russian ver
sion of the popular American children's program, which they
said would hit TV screens by fall.
The set of Ulitsa Sezam, as the show is called in Russian,
moves from a New York brownstone to a Moscow courtyard. It
is the home of three new brightly colored Muppets, a Russian
family and their neighbors.
Scenes filmed in Russia will be combined with segments
featuring familiar Sesame Street characters — dubbed in
Russian.
The producers said one of their main goals is to help chil
dren understand what it means to live in a democratic, diverse
society and give them confidence in a world that is vastly dif
ferent from the one their parents knew.
Sesame Street, which began in the United States in 1969,
now has productions in 40 other countries in 14 languages.
The American version is shown in 50 countries.
