# Muslim warlords disrupt relief aid

BANOV7CI, Bosnia-Herzegov
ina (AP) — Put out of work by
peace, warlords in this small
northern Bosnian town are try
ing out a new career: muscling in
on humanitarian aid.
This weekend, arsonists
torched a tent camp set up by a
German aid group 12 miles
southwest of Tuzla. Nine of the
12 tents were burned to the
ground, leaving 160 refugees
mostly women and children —
homeless.
Uwe Breininger, director of
Deutsche Humanitaere Stiftung
operations in Bosnia, blamed
Muslim warlords who no longer
have a cause.
He said his group might aban
don its mission in Bosnia if
authorities don't crack down on
the gangsters and give the camp
protection. He also asked police
to secure 1)1 IS warehouses and
offices.
"They have to help us help
them," he said, standing amid
piles of charred clothes and mat
tresses. "It is now up to the
Bosnian government to show
that it is a democratic country."
Breininger said local militia
men have threatened DIIS work
ers, and have insisted on helping
administer the aid, which
Breininger says is their way of
asking for a cut of the action.
Breininger would not specify
the source of the threats, and no
arrests have been made in the fire.
In addition to seeking ready
cash, the warlords are anxious to
maintain their influence now
that the peace, brokered last fall
in Dayton, Ohio, is in place.
The peace faces not only chal
lenges from continuing ethnic
tensions, but economic strains as
well. Troops returning home
have been told that the jobs they
once held in factories and on
farms leveled by the fighting are
gone.
Bosnian leaders are hoping
European economic assistance
will help create jobs and kickstart
the shattered economy — which

is operating at 5 percent of its pre
war capacity — but economists
don't expect to see signs of rea'.
recovery until the next decade.
Muscling in on refugee aid is
nothing new in Bosnia. During
the war, militia leaders in Serb
held Bosnia often demanded a cut
of aid deliveries for their troops
— and occasionally simply com
mandeered vehicles.
But the Banovici tensions are
the first known incident of war
lords trying to get a cut of peace
time aid.
Early Saturday, three men
were seen walking along the
camp's perimeter. Minutes later,
the tents were ablaze.
Ramiza Mujkic, 27, was asleep
in the tent she and her three chil
dren shared with 17 others when

she was awakened by screaming.
"When I realized there was a
fire I panicked," said Mujkic,
swaddling her 10-month-old son,
Ramo. "Children were crying.
Women were shouting. The whole
camp was running up and down."
Breininger and five colleagues
braved the flames with fire extin
guishers, but "there was nothing
we could do," he said. "Flames
were tens of meters high."
The aid group has rented
rooms in neighboring houses for
the homeless refugees, and esti
mated damage at $68,000. But aid
workers said the damage suffered
by the refugees runs deeper.
"We had these people laughing
again after a long time," said
Charles Minor.
Mujkic, weeping as she cradled

her son, said the destruction of
her tent was harder to bear than
when her house was destroyed by
Serbs during the war.
"I had just started to live a life
again," she said.
The tent camp had been well
organized and comfortable. Each
family had a room of its own
within the tents; each refugee
was allocated six square yards of
living space.
In addition, the aid group had
built a kitchen tent and a con
crete house with bathrooms and
showers.
On Monday, several men tried
to repair what remained of the
kitchen. Cans of food, vegetables
and pans lay in soot. Children
rummaged through debris trying
to find their toys.

Bosnian Serbs drive a horse-drawn cart yesterday. Many Bosnian Serbs from the suburbs surrounding
Sarajevo are leaving their homes before their district comes under government control.
