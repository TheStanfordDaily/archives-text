Bobby Blunt What: Frequent Rugby Flier. Major: Mechanical Engineering
There's nothing quite like playing a good, hard, satisfying game of rugby on a erisp morning at
Stanford. Exeept possibly playing one in Fiji. Or New Caledonia. Or New Zealand, or Australia,
or Tahiti. Bobby Blunt has managed to form scrums in all of these far-off lands, and plans next to
take his passion for rugby to South Africa. (One might think that ii would be possible to find a
decent game of rugby in California, or at the very least, somewhere on the continent of North
America.) Maybe it was while Bobby was working in a Mormon Mission in Guatemala that he
caught the travel bug, but the California native has a very intense ease of wanderlust—so much so that even
w hen lie's home, lie enjoys taking his Mights of fancy quite literally (lie lias a pilot's license) and spends spare
time soaring around the cool blue southern California skies. When he is actually on the ground at
Stanford, Bobby serves as president of the Rugby Club, in addition to being president of all 17
campus club sports.

There's an old saying, to the effect that there are two kinds of people in the world: those who
watch TV. and those who are on TV. Kris Atteberry. however, is too busy to watch much TV and
may be denied membership in the latter category due to what his mother tactfully describes as "a
face made for radio." The good news is that Kris is already a well-known voice on Stanford's radio
station and plans to steer clear of television to pursue a career in radio broadcasting. In the meantime,
in addition to being the announcer for many intramural games. Kris covers Stanford's varsity sports,
including football, basketball and baseball, and serves as the 1M Department's Executive Student
Director. Hmnim. . . . maybe there arc three kinds of people in this world. . .

Bobby Blunt What: Frequent Rugby Flier. Major: Mechanical Engineering
There's nothing quite like playing a good, hard, satisfying game of rugby on a erisp morning at
Stanford. Exeept possibly playing one in Fiji. Or New Caledonia. Or New Zealand, or Australia,
or Tahiti. Bobby Blunt has managed to form scrums in all of these far-off lands, and plans next to
take his passion for rugby to South Africa. (One might think that ii would be possible to find a
decent game of rugby in California, or at the very least, somewhere on the continent of North
America.) Maybe it was while Bobby was working in a Mormon Mission in Guatemala that he
caught the travel bug, but the California native has a very intense ease of wanderlust—so much so that even
w hen lie's home, lie enjoys taking his Mights of fancy quite literally (lie lias a pilot's license) and spends spare
time soaring around the cool blue southern California skies. When he is actually on the ground at
Stanford, Bobby serves as president of the Rugby Club, in addition to being president of all 17
campus club sports.
Sk
Kristian Atteberry It hat \ Voice For Ml Seasons Major / ngh.sh
There's an old saying, to the effect that there are two kinds of people in the world: those who
watch TV. and those who are on TV. Kris Atteberry. however, is too busy to watch much TV and
may be denied membership in the latter category due to what his mother tactfully describes as "a
face made for radio." The good news is that Kris is already a well-known voice on Stanford's radio
station and plans to steer clear of television to pursue a career in radio broadcasting. In the meantime,
in addition to being the announcer for many intramural games. Kris covers Stanford's varsity sports,
including football, basketball and baseball, and serves as the 1M Department's Executive Student
Director. Hmnim. . . . maybe there arc three kinds of people in this world. . .

Bobby Blunt What: Frequent Rugby Flier. Major: Mechanical Engineering
There's nothing quite like playing a good, hard, satisfying game of rugby on a erisp morning at
Stanford. Exeept possibly playing one in Fiji. Or New Caledonia. Or New Zealand, or Australia,
or Tahiti. Bobby Blunt has managed to form scrums in all of these far-off lands, and plans next to
take his passion for rugby to South Africa. (One might think that ii would be possible to find a
decent game of rugby in California, or at the very least, somewhere on the continent of North
America.) Maybe it was while Bobby was working in a Mormon Mission in Guatemala that he
caught the travel bug, but the California native has a very intense ease of wanderlust—so much so that even
w hen lie's home, lie enjoys taking his Mights of fancy quite literally (lie lias a pilot's license) and spends spare
time soaring around the cool blue southern California skies. When he is actually on the ground at
Stanford, Bobby serves as president of the Rugby Club, in addition to being president of all 17
campus club sports.

There's an old saying, to the effect that there are two kinds of people in the world: those who
watch TV. and those who are on TV. Kris Atteberry. however, is too busy to watch much TV and
may be denied membership in the latter category due to what his mother tactfully describes as "a
face made for radio." The good news is that Kris is already a well-known voice on Stanford's radio
station and plans to steer clear of television to pursue a career in radio broadcasting. In the meantime,
in addition to being the announcer for many intramural games. Kris covers Stanford's varsity sports,
including football, basketball and baseball, and serves as the 1M Department's Executive Student
Director. Hmnim. . . . maybe there arc three kinds of people in this world. . .

Bobby Blunt What: Frequent Rugby Flier. Major: Mechanical Engineering
There's nothing quite like playing a good, hard, satisfying game of rugby on a erisp morning at
Stanford. Exeept possibly playing one in Fiji. Or New Caledonia. Or New Zealand, or Australia,
or Tahiti. Bobby Blunt has managed to form scrums in all of these far-off lands, and plans next to
take his passion for rugby to South Africa. (One might think that ii would be possible to find a
decent game of rugby in California, or at the very least, somewhere on the continent of North
America.) Maybe it was while Bobby was working in a Mormon Mission in Guatemala that he
caught the travel bug, but the California native has a very intense ease of wanderlust—so much so that even
w hen lie's home, lie enjoys taking his Mights of fancy quite literally (lie lias a pilot's license) and spends spare
time soaring around the cool blue southern California skies. When he is actually on the ground at
Stanford, Bobby serves as president of the Rugby Club, in addition to being president of all 17
campus club sports.
Sk
Kristian Atteberry It hat \ Voice For Ml Seasons Major / ngh.sh
There's an old saying, to the effect that there are two kinds of people in the world: those who
watch TV. and those who are on TV. Kris Atteberry. however, is too busy to watch much TV and
may be denied membership in the latter category due to what his mother tactfully describes as "a
face made for radio." The good news is that Kris is already a well-known voice on Stanford's radio
station and plans to steer clear of television to pursue a career in radio broadcasting. In the meantime,
in addition to being the announcer for many intramural games. Kris covers Stanford's varsity sports,
including football, basketball and baseball, and serves as the 1M Department's Executive Student
Director. Hmnim. . . . maybe there arc three kinds of people in this world. . .
