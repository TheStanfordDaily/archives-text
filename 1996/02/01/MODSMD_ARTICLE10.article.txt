# Separated Sarajevo reunited

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) â€” Like surgeons reattaching a
limb, NATO troops have rejoined a
Serb-held section of Sarajevo to the rest
of the city, pushing away metal con
tainers and other barriers that divided
the capital's inhabitants for 3 1/2 years.
Sarajevo residents on both sides of
the former front line awoke to a
startling scene yesterday. The Bridge
of Brotherhood and Unity, a no-man's
land just a day before, was once again a
link over the Miljacka river. Gone were
the barriers that had blocked the view
from snipers.
Serbs on the southern side of the
bridge could watch the streetcars

hurtling by in the government-held
sector. Muslims looking south saw the
broad avenue leading into the Grbavica
neighborhood.
"It's so wonderful," said Maja
Davie, a woman watching from the
Serb side yesterday. "This is a symbol
of the normal life we can live again."
Across the river, a taxi driver called
Hamo smiled broadly as he gestured to
the other side. "I've waited years for
this," he said.
Still, lingering suspicions threaten
to keep Sarajevo's Serbs and Muslims
apart after the physical barricades are
swept aside.
In Ilidza, another Serb-held section

of Sarajevo, unidentified gunmen
wounded a British NATO driver in the
wrist late Tuesday and peppered a
NATO Land Rover with bullets. Two
days before, a U.S. Army officer was
grazed in the neck by a sniper's bullet.
NATO officials attribute the shoot
ings to growing apprehension in Serb
held areas about handing their territo
ry over to the Muslim-led government
by March 19.
Many Serbs have said they would
rather leave than have their sectors
submit to government control, as stip
ulated by the U.S.-brokered peace
agreement.
