## New research rules 
### 
Fac Sen's new rules
on research require
careful supervision

IN ITS MEETING last week,
the Faculty Senate passed a
new policy which would allow
Stanford researchers to collabo
rate more easily with outside
industry and research groups.
Such a change would generate
much-needed revenue for main
taining equipment and improving
facilities in the face of continuing
federal research funding cutbacks.
This is the second indication in
the past two weeks that the Uni
versity's faculty decision-making
body is taking seriously the finan
cial changes facing higher educa
tion today. The decision reverses
previous University regulations
that openly discouraged outside
entities from using Stanford for
research and development purpos
es.
Opening up University facilities
to greater use by outside groups is
a fiscally intelligent move. By giv
ing access to businesses which
wish to utilize Stanford's wealth of
equipment and talent, Stanford
will be more able to maintain
much of the equipment that is so
important to cutting-edge
research.
However, the new policy raises
several concerns about faculty
independence. At the very least,
the University needs to make sure
that it strongly enforces the other
components in the new policy,
which stipulate that Stanford
resources used in research cannot
be easily found elsewhere, that the
work relates to Stanford's academ
ic mission, that a faculty member
has oversight over the project and
that the work does not interfere
with University teaching and
research.
From a student perspective, the
last two concerns are probably the

most important. As English Prof.
John Bender mentioned at the
senate meeting, there is a question
of whether the oversight required
of Stanford faculty by the policy
will distract professors from their
regular duties of teaching or
administration. Opening the pre
mier facilities of Stanford to out
side use will undoubtedly attract
many companies to conduct
research here, and faculty will
have new oversight responsibili
ties.
Physics Prof. Robert Byers
countered that since faculty will
ingly enter into such agreements
to maintain their equipment, the
extra responsibility would not be a
burden.
But faculty willingness to coop
erate, ironically, may indeed turn
out to be the root of a problem.
Teaching is undoubtedly impor
tant to the majority of faculty
members at Stanford, but for
many researchers, maintaining
their own equipment may prove to
be tantamount on the scale of
needs. If keeping equipment in
good working order is contingent
on the supervision of research, it is
not difficult to imagine a faculty
member stuck with a trade-off
between teaching and outside
supervision.
In addition, it is important that
the University maintains the
appearance — or, if it comes down
to it, the reality — of staying away
from conflicts of interest. Though
the work must relate to Stanford's
academic mission, there is the pos
sibility a faculty member could
inadvertently enter into a research
participation agreement with an
outside entity which could damage
the University's reputation.
Admittedly, the possibility of
such a lapse in oversight is unlike
ly considering the integrity of
Stanford's faculty. However, there
is no way of telling what kind of
hand the future will deal the Uni
versity. While the research policy
appears to be a good deal for Stan
ford, administrators must cover all
the bases to make it so.
