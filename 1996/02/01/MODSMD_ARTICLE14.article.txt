Small's Asian fetish'perpetuates racial stereotypes

TONY SMALL'S COLUMN in the
Jan. 30 issue of The Daily
reached a new low. Small's piece
was hardly distinguished by its incon
sequential subject matter (his unreal
ized sexual fantasies) or its slipshod
writing style. What cannot be ignored
is the ridiculously ignorant discussion
of what Small describes as his "Asian
fetish."
Small attempts to defend himself by
insisting that his fixation on Asian
women is not a fetish in the clinical
sense, and then goes on to continue to
describe his desire for Asian women as
— you guessed it— a fetish. Small ends
his editorial by disingenuously insist
ing that his "appreciation" for Asian

women is merely an aesthetic prefer
ence for"the hair, the skin, the eyes"
before ending the column with a sar
castic "Yeah, that's probably it."
Small is completely irresponsible in
his neglect of the most obvious implica
tion of his assertions about his
"fetish"— namely, that it has nothing
to do with personal compatibility,
mutual goals or even a matter of pure
aesthetics. Rather, it is merely a per
petuation of the sexualization of Asian
women in Western culture through
their portrayal as repositories of a mys
terious and exotic sexuality. Small
claims that "as long as your fetish is
not rooted in a racial stereotype,
there's nothing wrong with it." Mr.

Small, your very choice of the term
"fetish" to describe you preference for
Asian women reflects the degree to
which it is part of the tired baggage of
cultural cliche.
If Small's piece was only an isolated
bit of egregious writing on the part of
The Daily's columnists, one could easi
ly brush it off as one example of jour
nalistic imbecility. But the problem is
much larger than one column — the
columnists for The Daily this volume
have been remarkable only for their
penchant for petty subjects, unflagging
belief in their own weak senses of
humor and lack of any commitment to
providing a forum for discussing issues
of importance to the Stanford commu

nity.
Regardless of the paucity of the
applicant pool, The Daily has an obliga
tion to maintain some standard of jour
nalistic quality, and this means finding
columnists who have something to con
tribute to discourse — whether humor
ous, intellectual or otherwise — at this
university. If you cannot find qualified
applicants who have what it takes to
produce quality columns, do something
more constructive with the space than
devote it to useless meandering, empty
humor and inarticulate writing.
