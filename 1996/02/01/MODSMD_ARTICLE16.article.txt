SLAMMING DAILY COLUMNISTS
is nothing new. In fact, it seems to
be the topic du jour. Of course, as
an opinions editor of this newspaper, I
have not been deaf and blind to the com
ments made about columnists. Never
theless, some would argue the point and
say I most certainly must have been deaf
and blind to let some of the things they
wrote slip through and be printed on the
pages of our esteemed and illustrious
campus broadsheet.
So as a service to the Stanford com
munity, and perhaps to prevent further
instances of being stoned as I walk out of
the Storke Publications Building, the
columnists that usually appear in this
spot have kindly "lent" this space to me
to write about something that, as our
critics have so eloquently put, discusses
issues of importance to the students here
at Stanford.
In truth, we would have sunk to the
ninth level of hell had we printed what
they gave us. So, I had to come up with
something to fill this space very quickly.
"What would I say that would be of use
in informing the masses of Stanford
without boring them all to tears like
some delightfully obscure CIV lecture?"
I thought. Then it struck me like a rock
— what better subject to write on than to
tell you how you can become one of the
most (in)famous people on campus — a
Daily columnist
Judging by the hate mail I get and the
sardonic remarks I hear about the

columnists, I thought the public should
get a chance to read about the twisted
and eccentric criteria The Daily uses to
decide who gets to be one. I do not vouch
for the incoming editors, who will
undoubtedly have a whole new set of
quirks ingrained in their minds. And I do
not speak for my co-editor, Danny
Bressler, who joined us mid-volume and
was not around to help pick Martin's
minions of evil during the application
process.
The process of selecting a columnist is
quite difficult. No, we do not throw darts
that's how we draft people for my
position. Last year, the admit rate was
17 percent with 100 percent yield. As you
have probably seen on this page for the
past few days, there is an advertisement
that describes what you need to turn into
us by 5 p.m. tomorrow if you wish to be
considered. I have to say, I could not
resist reading some of them before the
deadline, so quite honestly, you'll proba
bly catch the new editors in a better
mood if you turn in your stuff sooner and
not after they've glazed over 20 other
applications.
I looked for just good writing in gen
eral. I chose Brendan McCullough
because he did have an excellent first
piece. I chose Tony Small because he
wrote clearly — and he lived in my dorm,
so in case I had a problem, I could go
right over and yell at him. And I liked
Josh Gohlke because he had a most acid
and peculiar sense of humor. The others

I blame on my former co-editor.
At the time, our judgement seemed
sound; these were, in our opinion, some
of the best people we had in the applicant
pool. If you are someone who disagrees, I
highly encourage you to show us your
masterpieces of English writing.
Once you become one of the lucky
souls who wins The Daily equivalent of
the Publishers Clearinghouse Sweep
stakes, you will be expected to turn in
one column of similar length and quality
to us two days in advance of the day your
piece is printed. You get your picture in
the paper and can virtually run amuck,
saying anything you want in your allot
ted space (though I am sure that laxity
will be restricted faster than the farcical
grading policy will fix the "problem" of
grade inflation).
So there you have it — a quick run
down on how to be a columnist. Really,
though, I have enjoyed being an editor of
The Daily very much. 1 wish our critics
could have at least praised the people
here for the great effort it takes to put
out this paper every day, but too often,
people yell to criticize, but whisper to
praise. So to my fellow staffers of the
incoming volume, best wishes. I've had a
great time in the ninth level.
Editor Young says he will always love his
columnists (truly).
