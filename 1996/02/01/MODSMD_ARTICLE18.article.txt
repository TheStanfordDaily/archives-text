Stanford's black community will celebrate its free
dom and successes with Black Liberation Month,
continuing through February.
The month's events, sponsored by the Black Com
munity Services Center, all relate to the theme, "Di
versity in Our Community: Weaving a Fabric of
Unity."
Since 1969, Stanford students have referred to
February as Black Liberation Month instead of the
more commonly used Black History Month, said Tina
Gridiron, assistant director of the BCSC.
"Students here at Stanford coined the term (be
cause) for them it wasn't just about black history; it
was about moving forward in the face of adversity,"
Gridiron said. "This is a time to celebrate the
achievements of African Americans. We have been
liberated."
Activities planned for Black Liberation Month
start today and span the entire month. One of the
first events is the "Pajama Jam" party this Saturday
at Ricker Dining Hall, which will promote AIDS
awareness within and outside of the Stanford com
munity. All proceeds will benefit Free at Last, an
Fast Palo Alto AIDS program.
"Black Liberation Month will mean different

things to different people, Gridiron said. Por some
it represents a sense of pride and strength that they
are here at Stanford, and this is an opportunity to
present themselves to the Stanford community in a
positive light.
"For others it is a time for family, unity and
warmth. But most of all, I feel that this is a time to be
recognized as a presence that does exist, she added.
Highlighted events of the month include a drama
tization of the Montgomery bus boycott on Feb. 15-
16 at Lagunita Dining Hall. On Feb. 18 there will be
a "Gospel Extravaganza" in Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
featuring Bay Area choirs and radio personality
Sheila Robinson.
Gridiron stressed that these events are meant for
theentire University to participate in and not just for
the black community. The Black Community Ser
vices Center has posted fliers in all dorms and de
partments to try to reach all areas of the Stanford
community.
"We tried to market the month in a way so that
people would see the value in taking the time to come
to these different ethnic and cultural events," said
Gridiron. "We do have people outside of the black
community who are interested in ethnic involvement
and education, but this is an area that still needs to
grow for all the different cultural [groupsl on cam
pus."
