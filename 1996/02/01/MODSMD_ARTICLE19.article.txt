## Cardinal hoops bulldozes Golden Bears 93-79 Hot shooting, tough defense too much for Cal 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Stanford 93
WSU 79

Before last night's game, Cal
ifornia head coach Todd Boze
man made the mistake of telling
Brevin Knight that his guards
were going to take it right at
Stanford's junior point guard.
Knight's response — I'm
coming right hack at you, Todd.
And I'm bringing my friend
Dion Cross with me.
"It's real simple — our game
plan was to stop their guards
and we didn't do that," Boze
man said.
On a night of hot shooting by
both teams, Knight and Cross
combined for 54 points as the
Cardinal (12-5, 6-3 Pacific 10
Conference) dismantled the
Bears (11-6, 6-3) in the second
half to win 93-79.
"That's a pretty good basket
ball game," said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "We played
a great second half — the guys
really picked it up defensively
and Brevin did a great job run
ning the club."
Knight (29 points) and Cross
(25) did a remarkable job adapt
ing their games against what
seemed like a smart game plan
on Cal's part — play off Knight
and run at Cross when he gets
the ball on the perimeter.
"One's a great shooter and
one's a great penetrator and
leader," Bozeman said.
But Knight buried the open
jumpshot and Cross built off the
success he had putting the ball
on the floor last weekend

against Washington State to foil
the Bears' defensive scheme.
The two connected on 19 of 32
shots from the field, seven-of
nine from behind the three
point line. Knight also tied a
school record with 13 assists.
"When [Brevin's] shooting
the ball, it makes a difference,"
Montgomery said. "You can't
logically get into him because
he's too quick. Dion's such a
good shooter, they tried to make
him put it on the floor. He's
inside and outside now, opposite
of what they're doing with
Brevin."
This scenario has been run
ning in Bozeman's head for the
last two years. In fact, he
recruited Prentice McGruder, a
transfer from Southeastern
Community College in lowa, to
specifically tackle the tough
point guards in the conference.
Prentice was more of an
apprentice last night, picking up
two fouls in the first 33 seconds.
After a 17-minute ride on the
bench, ho played all of 14 sec
onds before grabbing his third,
which sat him for the rest of the
half.
One minute, 54 seconds into
the second half, McGruder
slammed into David Harbour in
a scuffle for a loose ball and took
a familiar place on the bench,
tallying a whopping 2:40 of
playing time while the game
was still in question.
As unsuccessful as Cal was
with its defensive game plan,
the Cardinal's attempt to shut
down the Bears' super-fresh
man Shareef Abdur-Rahim
worked nearly to perfection.
Held to only nine shots, three in
the first half, Abdur-Rahim was
constantly met by double teams
on the low block, courtesy of
Andy Poppink and Darren All

away.
"We executed our game plan
pretty well," said Poppink, who
added 18 points and nine
rebounds to his outstanding
defensive effort. "He's very good,

but he's also young, and I think
we frustrated him. I just wanted
to make sure he knew I was there
all the time."

Senior Andy Poppink rises up for two of his 18 points last night.
Poppink also held Cal star Shareef Abdur-Rahim to 13 points.
Abdur-Rahim finished with 13
points, 10 below his season average
and two above his career low. The
double-teaming also kept him off
the boards — he grabbed only two,
six under his average.
Despite the Cardinal's success
against Abdur-Rahim in the first
half, Stanford was down 48-43 at
halftime because Cal seemingly
could not miss. The Bears hit 19 of
28 shots (68 percent), including
nine of 11 threes. Ed Gray rattled
off nine straight points on three
miraculous three-pointers — a 23-
footer, a pull-up jumper cind a lean
er in Cross's face with the shot
clock near zero.
"In the locker room [at halftime),
Darren said it a million times,
'There's no way they'll shoot that
well in the second half,"' Knight said.
Stanford clamped on the defen
sive shackles to start the second
half. Nine straight points moved
the Cardinal from five down to four
up, and Stanford never looked
back. The run extended to 21-8
over the first eight-and-a-half min
utes.
"We didn't panic because we
knew Cal couldn't do that (shoot 68
percent) for 40 minutes," Mont
gomery said.
The Bears saw their shooting
percentage plummet like an ursine
cliff-diver in the second half. Cal
connected on only nine of 29 shots
and was unable to stop Stanford's
assault on the net. The Cardinal
turned up the heat, shooting 60.7
percent in the second half and 57.1
for the game.
With the game already decided
in the closing minutes, two excla
mation-point dunks by freshman
Mark Seaton brought the sold-out
crowd back into a frenzy. As Knight
dribbled out the final seconds, the
Sixth Man Club (who taunted Cal

power forward tight end Tony
Gonzalez with the cheer "fumble,
fumble" in regard to his Big (lame
deciding miscue last November)
rushed the floor to mob the victori

ous Cardinal.
"One thing we did this game is
we focused for all 40 minutes,"
Poppink said. "That's so much bet
ter than playing in spurts."

WSU 79

Before last night's game, Cal
ifornia head coach Todd Boze
man made the mistake of telling
Brevin Knight that his guards
were going to take it right at
Stanford's junior point guard.
Knight's response — I'm
coming right hack at you, Todd.
And I'm bringing my friend
Dion Cross with me.
"It's real simple — our game
plan was to stop their guards
and we didn't do that," Boze
man said.
On a night of hot shooting by
both teams, Knight and Cross
combined for 54 points as the
Cardinal (12-5, 6-3 Pacific 10
Conference) dismantled the
Bears (11-6, 6-3) in the second
half to win 93-79.
"That's a pretty good basket
ball game," said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "We played
a great second half — the guys
really picked it up defensively
and Brevin did a great job run
ning the club."
Knight (29 points) and Cross
(25) did a remarkable job adapt
ing their games against what
seemed like a smart game plan
on Cal's part — play off Knight
and run at Cross when he gets
the ball on the perimeter.
"One's a great shooter and
one's a great penetrator and
leader," Bozeman said.
But Knight buried the open
jumpshot and Cross built off the
success he had putting the ball
on the floor last weekend

against Washington State to foil
the Bears' defensive scheme.
The two connected on 19 of 32
shots from the field, seven-of
nine from behind the three
point line. Knight also tied a
school record with 13 assists.
"When [Brevin's] shooting
the ball, it makes a difference,"
Montgomery said. "You can't
logically get into him because
he's too quick. Dion's such a
good shooter, they tried to make
him put it on the floor. He's
inside and outside now, opposite
of what they're doing with
Brevin."
This scenario has been run
ning in Bozeman's head for the
last two years. In fact, he
recruited Prentice McGruder, a
transfer from Southeastern
Community College in lowa, to
specifically tackle the tough
point guards in the conference.
Prentice was more of an
apprentice last night, picking up
two fouls in the first 33 seconds.
After a 17-minute ride on the
bench, ho played all of 14 sec
onds before grabbing his third,
which sat him for the rest of the
half.
One minute, 54 seconds into
the second half, McGruder
slammed into David Harbour in
a scuffle for a loose ball and took
a familiar place on the bench,
tallying a whopping 2:40 of
playing time while the game
was still in question.
As unsuccessful as Cal was
with its defensive game plan,
the Cardinal's attempt to shut
down the Bears' super-fresh
man Shareef Abdur-Rahim
worked nearly to perfection.
Held to only nine shots, three in
the first half, Abdur-Rahim was
constantly met by double teams
on the low block, courtesy of
Andy Poppink and Darren All

away.
"We executed our game plan
pretty well," said Poppink, who
added 18 points and nine
rebounds to his outstanding
defensive effort. "He's very good,

but he's also young, and I think
we frustrated him. I just wanted
to make sure he knew I was there
all the time."

Senior Andy Poppink rises up for two of his 18 points last night.
Poppink also held Cal star Shareef Abdur-Rahim to 13 points.
Abdur-Rahim finished with 13
points, 10 below his season average
and two above his career low. The
double-teaming also kept him off
the boards — he grabbed only two,
six under his average.
Despite the Cardinal's success
against Abdur-Rahim in the first
half, Stanford was down 48-43 at
halftime because Cal seemingly
could not miss. The Bears hit 19 of
28 shots (68 percent), including
nine of 11 threes. Ed Gray rattled
off nine straight points on three
miraculous three-pointers — a 23-
footer, a pull-up jumper cind a lean
er in Cross's face with the shot
clock near zero.
"In the locker room [at halftime),
Darren said it a million times,
'There's no way they'll shoot that
well in the second half,"' Knight said.
Stanford clamped on the defen
sive shackles to start the second
half. Nine straight points moved
the Cardinal from five down to four
up, and Stanford never looked
back. The run extended to 21-8
over the first eight-and-a-half min
utes.
"We didn't panic because we
knew Cal couldn't do that (shoot 68
percent) for 40 minutes," Mont
gomery said.
The Bears saw their shooting
percentage plummet like an ursine
cliff-diver in the second half. Cal
connected on only nine of 29 shots
and was unable to stop Stanford's
assault on the net. The Cardinal
turned up the heat, shooting 60.7
percent in the second half and 57.1
for the game.
With the game already decided
in the closing minutes, two excla
mation-point dunks by freshman
Mark Seaton brought the sold-out
crowd back into a frenzy. As Knight
dribbled out the final seconds, the
Sixth Man Club (who taunted Cal

power forward tight end Tony
Gonzalez with the cheer "fumble,
fumble" in regard to his Big (lame
deciding miscue last November)
rushed the floor to mob the victori

ous Cardinal.
"One thing we did this game is
we focused for all 40 minutes,"
Poppink said. "That's so much bet
ter than playing in spurts."
