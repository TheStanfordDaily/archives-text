## Cardinal hoops bulldozes Golden Bears 93-79 Hot shooting, tough defense too much for Cal

Stanford 93
WSU 79

Before last night's game, Cal
ifornia head coach Todd Boze
man made the mistake of telling
Brevin Knight that his guards
were going to take it right at
Stanford's junior point guard.
Knight's response — I'm
coming right hack at you, Todd.
And I'm bringing my friend
Dion Cross with me.
"It's real simple — our game
plan was to stop their guards
and we didn't do that," Boze
man said.
On a night of hot shooting by
both teams, Knight and Cross
combined for 54 points as the
Cardinal (12-5, 6-3 Pacific 10
Conference) dismantled the
Bears (11-6, 6-3) in the second
half to win 93-79.
"That's a pretty good basket
ball game," said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "We played
a great second half — the guys
really picked it up defensively
and Brevin did a great job run
ning the club."
Knight (29 points) and Cross
(25) did a remarkable job adapt
ing their games against what
seemed like a smart game plan
on Cal's part — play off Knight
and run at Cross when he gets
the ball on the perimeter.
"One's a great shooter and
one's a great penetrator and
leader," Bozeman said.
But Knight buried the open
jumpshot and Cross built off the
success he had putting the ball
on the floor last weekend

against Washington State to foil
the Bears' defensive scheme.
The two connected on 19 of 32
shots from the field, seven-of
nine from behind the three
point line. Knight also tied a
school record with 13 assists.
"When [Brevin's] shooting
the ball, it makes a difference,"
Montgomery said. "You can't
logically get into him because
he's too quick. Dion's such a
good shooter, they tried to make
him put it on the floor. He's
inside and outside now, opposite
of what they're doing with
Brevin."
This scenario has been run
ning in Bozeman's head for the
last two years. In fact, he
recruited Prentice McGruder, a
transfer from Southeastern
Community College in lowa, to
specifically tackle the tough
point guards in the conference.
Prentice was more of an
apprentice last night, picking up
two fouls in the first 33 seconds.
After a 17-minute ride on the
bench, ho played all of 14 sec
onds before grabbing his third,
which sat him for the rest of the
half.
One minute, 54 seconds into
the second half, McGruder
slammed into David Harbour in
a scuffle for a loose ball and took
a familiar place on the bench,
tallying a whopping 2:40 of
playing time while the game
was still in question.
As unsuccessful as Cal was
with its defensive game plan,
the Cardinal's attempt to shut
down the Bears' super-fresh
man Shareef Abdur-Rahim
worked nearly to perfection.
Held to only nine shots, three in
the first half, Abdur-Rahim was
constantly met by double teams
on the low block, courtesy of
Andy Poppink and Darren All

away.
"We executed our game plan
pretty well," said Poppink, who
added 18 points and nine
rebounds to his outstanding
defensive effort. "He's very good,

but he's also young, and I think
we frustrated him. I just wanted
to make sure he knew I was there
all the time."

Senior Andy Poppink rises up for two of his 18 points last night.
Poppink also held Cal star Shareef Abdur-Rahim to 13 points.
