## Shaklee Corporation to build multi-million dollar facility in Stanford Research Park 
### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
Another name will join the list of
companies operating in the Stanford
Research Park when the Shaklee Cor
poration, a leading manufacturer of
nutritional supplements, builds a new
multi-million dollar research center.
Shaklee, based in San Francisco,
will build and operate the facility for its
parent organization, Yamanouchi

Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., one of
Japan's largest pharmaceutical compa
nies.
The convenience offered by Stan
ford's proximity to Shaklee's head
quarters was one reason for choosing
the location, said Karin Topping, direc
tor of public relations for Shaklee. The
company also has a research center in
Hayward, Calif., and operates in both
North America and Asia.
The research center will consist of

two buildings on six acres of land for a
total of 74,000 square feet of offices
and research and development labs.
Construction will begin in April and
should be completed by spring 1997.
The University will retain ownership
of the buildings, which Shaklee will
lease.
Initially, about 40 people will be em
ployed in the facility. That number
could change depending on the projects
being worked on at any time, said Top

ping.
Scientists in the facility will focus
t heir efforts on the development of pre
scription and over-the-counter drugs
as well as delivery technology. The cen
ter will also house other pharmaceuti
cal activity and support Yamanouchi's
expansion into foreign markets.
"It's part of the long-term plans to
support Yamanouchi's development
plans in North America," said
Topping.
Besides proximity to Shaklee's
base of operations, Topping also
cited "the good reputation that

An article in Monday's Daily

the duration of an individual's
academic appointment. Un

choosing it as the site of the com
pany's new facility.
The Stanford Research Park is
an industrial complex on Univer
sity-owned lands near Page Mill
Road. It covers 700 acres and is
home to about 150 companies, in
cluding Hewlett-Packard and Var-

pointinents. However, the Facul
ty Handbook says that, though
the University has the power to
discontinue academic programs,
in such cases it will "make every
effort to reassign tenured mem
bers of the faculty." If this is im
possible, Stanford will give
tenured professors 12 months'
notice and assist them in finding
new positions.
In addition, a Nov. 28, 1995,
article, "Bookstore costs climb,"
erred in stating that three for
mer Bookstore managers had
been involved in a "tax-evasion
scandal" in connection with
stock loss suffered by the store.

The park, opened in 1951 and
run by the Stanford Management
Company, has a long history of
promoting technology transfer be
tween academia and industry
through various collaborations,
said Susan Meaney, administra

agement company.

Bookstore was not a case of tax
evasion but the result of a m ix-up
by Bookstore accountants. It did
not involve the three former
managers, who have, however,
been accused of tax evasion on
their personal returns.
