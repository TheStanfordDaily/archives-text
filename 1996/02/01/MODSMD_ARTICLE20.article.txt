# Cardinal fired up for USC test
## Stanford men's swimming wary of upset after women's loss 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
The Stanford men's swimming team heads
south this weekend for a meet against USC tomor
row and a follow-up against UC-Santa Barbara on
Saturday. After the Stanford women's swimming
team lost its first dual meet in eight years to the
Women of Troy last weekend, the Cardinal men are
wary of the Trojan men.

USC's victory over the Cardi
nal women last weekend only
makes the men's meet more
exciting. The Trojan band was at
the women's meet last weekend,
and the Cardinal men expect it to
show this weekend as well. A
Stanford women's swimmer
overheard a USC men's swimmer
say this would be the biggest dual
meet of his life.

"Their women won and they're fired up," said
Stanford co-captain Ray Carey. "And we're excited
to do some solid racing. We haven't had a 'tough
performance' dual meet, a 'full-excitement' dual
meet. We'll definitely be fired up."
While USC does not have the depth to compete
at the Cardinal's level at the NCAA Champi
onships, it docs boast several solid swimmers who
can score wins in individual events. Trojan Jim
Wells will push Stanford freestylers in the 50- and
200-yard freestyle. Brad Bridgeforth (a Texas
transfer who did not compete in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships) will chase Stanford's

freshman Pac-10 champion Tate Blahnik in the
200-yard backstroke. Trojan Kent Johnson, the
Pac-10 champion in the mile, will offer a substan
tial challenge to Stanford distance swimmers
junior Kevin Radvany and freshman Matt O'Mara.
"They have a better dual-meet team than an
NCAA team," Carey said. "They have quality over
quantity. They don't have the point-scoring depth
that we have, but they've got guys in about seven
individual events who can win."

The point-scoring system for
dual meets enables a team like
USC to provide Stanford with a
real battle. Four years ago, when
Carey — who was redshirted last
year due to a shoulder injury —
was a freshman, the Trojans beat
the Cardinal in a dual meet
before Stanford went on to win
the NCAA championship.

"This becomes their chance to beat Stanford
since they don't have as good an NCAA-meet
team," Carey said. "And I'm the only one left from
the team that lost to them four years ago, so I have
a personal vendetta."
The Stanford men are excited to have a chal
lenging meet. After a long layoff over winter break
and two easy meets against the Arizona schools
they'll have their first competitive races in a long
time. In fact, because the Olympic Trials in March
have kept the Cardinal from scheduling regular
season meets against NCAA powerhouses Michi-
gan and Texas, this will be its
most challenging dual meet of the
season.
"It's starting to get exciting,"
said junior Scott Jones. "We had a
lot of time off. The excitement
didn't really fade, but was hidden
a little bit. Now it's starting to
come back again."
Despite all the excitement,
Stanford is not going overboard.
The Cardinal men know that if
they take care of business as
usual and perform as they should,
they will win the meet.
"The team's hoping to swim
really well," Jones said. "We beat
them pretty bad at Pac-lOs (846-
535) and we want to do it again."
In order for the Cardinal to
swim up to its expectations, the
freshmen must continue the out
standing performance they have
demonstrated thus far this sea
son.
"The freshman class has been
doing well all along, but this is
their first tough head-to-head
dual meet," Carey said. "It really
exposes how ferocious you are;
how good you really are against
the guy next to you. Unlike Pac
10s, it's not so much about times
or about technique; it's about rac
ing the guy next to vou and win

rung.
In addition to the challenges
faced bv Blahnik and O'Mara,
the Cardinal is expecting fresh
men Dod Wales and Justin
Ewers to really emerge as big
performers.
"Justin's been doing incredible
stuff in practice," Jones said.

"We're looking to see some good
times from him. I can't wait to see
how fast he swims."
The Cardinal has been t raining
for months now and is beginning
to implement that training in
races. This is one of the first big
steps on the path to the Olympic
trials and the NCAA Chamm

onships.
"Now we're refocusing," Carey
said. "This meet couldn't have
come at a better time. We've done
our training; now we need to
focus on racing. We've reached
t he turning point."
This turning point, though an
important meet, is just one of the

many steps on the path to the
NCAA championship.
"Even though it's going to he
an exciting meet, we're not so
uptight that we're going to sacri
fice all of our emotional energy,"
said Jones. "As long as we swim
like we can, we'll win. This is just
another stepping stone."
