# Cardinal fired up for USC test
## Stanford men's swimming wary of upset after women's loss 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
The Stanford men's swimming team heads
south this weekend for a meet against USC tomor
row and a follow-up against UC-Santa Barbara on
Saturday. After the Stanford women's swimming
team lost its first dual meet in eight years to the
Women of Troy last weekend, the Cardinal men are
wary of the Trojan men.

USC's victory over the Cardi
nal women last weekend only
makes the men's meet more
exciting. The Trojan band was at
the women's meet last weekend,
and the Cardinal men expect it to
show this weekend as well. A
Stanford women's swimmer
overheard a USC men's swimmer
say this would be the biggest dual
meet of his life.

"Their women won and they're fired up," said
Stanford co-captain Ray Carey. "And we're excited
to do some solid racing. We haven't had a 'tough
performance' dual meet, a 'full-excitement' dual
meet. We'll definitely be fired up."
While USC does not have the depth to compete
at the Cardinal's level at the NCAA Champi
onships, it docs boast several solid swimmers who
can score wins in individual events. Trojan Jim
Wells will push Stanford freestylers in the 50- and
200-yard freestyle. Brad Bridgeforth (a Texas
transfer who did not compete in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships) will chase Stanford's

freshman Pac-10 champion Tate Blahnik in the
200-yard backstroke. Trojan Kent Johnson, the
Pac-10 champion in the mile, will offer a substan
tial challenge to Stanford distance swimmers
junior Kevin Radvany and freshman Matt O'Mara.
"They have a better dual-meet team than an
NCAA team," Carey said. "They have quality over
quantity. They don't have the point-scoring depth
that we have, but they've got guys in about seven
individual events who can win."

The point-scoring system for
dual meets enables a team like
USC to provide Stanford with a
real battle. Four years ago, when
Carey — who was redshirted last
year due to a shoulder injury —
was a freshman, the Trojans beat
the Cardinal in a dual meet
before Stanford went on to win
the NCAA championship.

"This becomes their chance to beat Stanford
since they don't have as good an NCAA-meet
team," Carey said. "And I'm the only one left from
the team that lost to them four years ago, so I have
a personal vendetta."
The Stanford men are excited to have a chal
lenging meet. After a long layoff over winter break
and two easy meets against the Arizona schools
they'll have their first competitive races in a long
time. In fact, because the Olympic Trials in March
have kept the Cardinal from scheduling regular
season meets against NCAA powerhouses Michi-
