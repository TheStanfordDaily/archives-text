# Cardinal wrestling out to keep winning ways against Fullerton
## 
### Karim Fakhry Contributing writer 
After taking a refreshing sip
from the recently-elusive glass of

victory last weekend, Stanford
wrestlers look to extend their win
streak tomorrow night at Burn
ham Pavilion when they face Cal
State-Fullerton.

With its 23-18 win over UC-
Davis, the Cardinal regained
some much-needed confidence.
The return of senior team leader
Tod Surmon (158 pounds) played
a large role in last week's tri
umph. Surmon ranks first in the
Pacific 10 Conference and fifth
nationally in his weight division.
Surmon had been suffering
from a sprained knee, which side
lined him for several weeks. How
ever, he reemerged last weekend
to crush his opponent by an 11-0
margin.
Surmon's teammates also reg
istered impressive wins against
the lowly Aggies, who have
dropped 21 straight dual matches.
Along with Surmon's efforts,
junior Bryan Vaniman's pin in
the 190-pound class and senior
Jimmy Aguirre's decision in the
134-pound division paced the Car
dinal to victorv.

senior Tod Surmon.
Like the Aggies, the Titans
have not established themselves
as a competitive dual-meet team.
Cal State-Fullerton has prevailed
in only one of its five dual meets
this season. That sole success
came against Portland State by a
20-18 margin.
Both Stanford and Cal State-
Fullerton participated in the Las
Vegas Open in Stateline, Nev.,

back in December. The tourna
ment included the top 34 teams in
the country. Wrestling alongside
powerhouses like lowa State,
Nebraska, Wyoming, West Vir
ginia and Edinboro, the Cardinal
placed 14th. Meanwhile, the
Titans did not fare so well, finish
ing near the bottom of the heap at
No. 27.
The Cardinal vowed it would
not enter tomorrow's match with
its head in the clouds, as Stanford
knows from experience that a
struggling underdog can pull off
close upsets under the right cir

cuinstances. However, Stanford
grapplers realize that they must
draw upon their confidence.
Aguirre, for one, attributed his
upset loss at the hands of a Cal
State-Bakersfield underdog on
Jan. 20 to a lack of confidence.
Stanford's lineup this weekend
will include Surmon, Aguirre,
senior Matt Cano (126), Vani
man, freshman Doug Bardsley
(150) and sophomore Jeff Grant
1167). Grant has wrestled mar
velously in Surmon's absence,
winning three matches while los
ing one nail-biter.
