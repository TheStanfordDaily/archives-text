# Cardinal wrestling out to keep winning ways against Fullerton
##

After taking a refreshing sip
from the recently-elusive glass of

victory last weekend, Stanford
wrestlers look to extend their win
streak tomorrow night at Burn
ham Pavilion when they face Cal
State-Fullerton.

With its 23-18 win over UC-
Davis, the Cardinal regained
some much-needed confidence.
The return of senior team leader
Tod Surmon (158 pounds) played
a large role in last week's tri
umph. Surmon ranks first in the
Pacific 10 Conference and fifth
nationally in his weight division.
Surmon had been suffering
from a sprained knee, which side
lined him for several weeks. How
ever, he reemerged last weekend
to crush his opponent by an 11-0
margin.
Surmon's teammates also reg
istered impressive wins against
the lowly Aggies, who have
dropped 21 straight dual matches.
Along with Surmon's efforts,
junior Bryan Vaniman's pin in
the 190-pound class and senior
Jimmy Aguirre's decision in the
134-pound division paced the Car
dinal to victorv.
