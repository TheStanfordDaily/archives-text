# Knight dominates battle of Pac-10 premiers
## 
### Daniel Kao Editorial staff 
Two years ago, a precocious
Stanford point guard by the
name of Brevin Knight burst
onto the college basketball scene
with his gutsy attitude and
incredible play en route to gar
nering Pacific 10 Conference
Freshman of the Year accolades.
Last season, California's
Tremaine Fowlkes captured Pac
-10 Freshman of the Year honors,
drawing the attention of Bay
Area hoops fans to the rival Gold
en Bears. This year, Cal's fresh
man forward Shareef Adbur-
Rahim is the toast of the town
and the favorite, if not guaran
teed, to win this year's Freshman
of the Year, if not Pac-10 Player
of the Year award.
Therefore, last night's 93-79
Cardinal victory over the Bears
could be called a Pac-10 Fresh
man of the Year reunion of sorts,
with Freshmen of the Year from
past, present and future all
accounted for. But while all three
were present, one player still out
shone and outperformed the oth
ers, and he wasn't a Weenie.
"Brevin just did a great job of
running the club,"said Stanford
head coach Mike
Montgomery."He was feeling it.
He was making the pass to the
open man. He was very much in
control."
Prior to the contest, Cal head
coach Todd Bozeman had issued
a challenge to Knight.
"I [told Knight] before the
game that I hope he brought his
lunch because we were going to
come at him," Bozeman said.
That was probably Bozeman's
worst coaching decision of the
night.
From start to finish, Knight
showed Bozeman and his young
cubs who was still king of the Bay
Area basketball jungle. In front

of a roaring Maples Pavilion
crowd of 7,381, Knight shot,
dished and rebounded his way to
a game-high 29 points, 13 assists
and eight boards. The elder
statesman of the Freshman of
the Year club shot 10-of-17 from
the field, including 2-of-2 from
behind the three-point arc. Sim
ply put, it was sheer domination.
"I felt I was in the How â€” a
point guard zone if that's what
you want to call it," Knight said.
Knight had his remarkable
hand in 24 of the Cardinal's first
26 points, scoring nine points and
dishing six assists in the first 10
minutes of play. He would end
the first half with 11 points and
seven assists, but that was just,
his warm-up.
In the second half, with the
Stanford down 48-46 with just
under 18 minutes to go, Knight
sparked the Cardinal drive, scor
ing seven of the next nine Cardi
nal points to put Stanford up 55-
50. With Cal closing the gap to
59-56, Knight promptly dished
the ball off to sharpshooting
backcourt mate Dion Cross for
the sure three and then drove in
for an easy fastbreak lay up. After
that, the Cardinal never looked
back.
"Brevin was feeling good,"
Montgomery said. "He was shoot
ing the ball well. If he can shoot
the ball like that, he's an unbe
lievable player because he can still
penetrate. When Brevin's on, he's
awfully good."
As for the other two so-called
Cal playmakers, Fowlkes had
missed much of the season due to
a run-in with the NCAA regarding
an agent-supplied sports-utility
vehicle. Playing his third game of
the season, Fowlkes, who has tra
ditionally had mediocre games
against the Cardinal (a total of 12
points in last year's two meetings
against Stanford) failed to
