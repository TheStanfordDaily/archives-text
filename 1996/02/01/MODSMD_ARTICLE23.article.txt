# No. 1 Stanford men's tennis set to host Bulldogs, Gophers
## Cardinal seeks to continue nation's longest winning streak 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's tennis
team has yet to be tested. By
steamrolling over Hawaii 7-0 on
Monday, the Cardinal improved
its season record to 3-0, and
extended its nation-best win
streak to 30.
However, it won't be so easy
for the Cardinal to earn consecu
tive victories 31 and 32.
The 13th-ranked Fresno
State Bulldogs roll into town at
noon tomorrow, and the 23rd
ranked Golden Gophers of Min
nesota arrive at 1:30 p.m. the
very next day. Minnesota is one
of the top teams in the Big Ten
Conference, and Fresno State is
ranked tops in its region as well.
Cardinal head coach Dick
Gould is looking forward to see
ing his team face some stiffer
competition. "These are both
great matches for us," he said.
"We need matches badly. Our
players can really benefit from
some tough dual-match play."
The Bulldogs feature two of
the top players in the college
game today. Frederik Giers, a
junior from Sweden, jumped
from No. 24 all the way to No. 3
in the most recent singles poll.
Frederik Bergh, also from Swe
den, was ranked eighth in the
preseason, but dropped out of
the rankings because he did not
plav collegiate tennis during the
fall.
Stanford's senior captain, Jeff
Salzenstein, has faced both play
ers before. "Like most Swedish
players, they tend to play from
the backcourt most of the time,"
he said. "Both guys play well
enough to deserve to be in the
top 10."
Salzenstein will be playing in
the No. 1 singles position for the
Cardinal and will likely face one
of the Swedish baseliners. "I like
to serve and volley, put points
away at the net," he said. "Hope
fully, I can do that against
whomever I play. But if I need to
adjust my game because one of
those guys [Giers or Berghl is
passing me a lot, I can do that."
In sum, the first singles
match will pit one of the top net
players in the nation [Salzen
steinl against one of the best
baseliners [Giers or Berghl.
"It should be a lot of fun to
watch," Salzenstein said.

In the second singles match,
freshman Ryan Wolters will try
to continue his excellent play.

"I just want to do what I need
to do to make this team better,"
he said. "I'll go out there and
play the best that I can."
The rest of the Cardinal line
up includes sophomore Paul
Goldstein, senior Jim Thomas,
junior Grant Elliott and senior
Ricky Becker at the third,
fourth, fifth and sixth singles
spots, respectively. Playing dou
bles for Stanford will be Salzen
stein and Goldstein at No. 1,
Wolters and Elliot at No. 2 and
Thomas and Becker at the third
slot.

"We need doubles work," he said.
"The more doubles matches
these guys play, the better they'll
start playing together," he said.
Although Fresno State and
Minnesota will be the first
tough matches that the Cardi
nal will have faced this year,
Gould isn't worried about the
team being ready.
"The guys work hard, and
they'll be prepared. 1 know they
will put out a lot of effort," he
said. "We need to get comfort
able in playing tough dual
matches, and the way to do that
is by playing tough matches."
While one might assume that
such early matches are some
what insignificant, intersection
al matches like these are actual
ly very meaningful. Only eight
teams get an at-large bid to the
NCAA Championships — the
other eight teams must qualify
— and the Cardinal needs an
impressive record to earn such a
bid.
"These matches are not going
to be easy. Both teams I Min
nesota and Fresno State] have a
lot of good tennis players," said
Gould. "They should be great
spectator matches."
