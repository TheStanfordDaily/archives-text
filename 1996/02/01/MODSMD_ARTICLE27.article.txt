# Grub Focus on: Bella Vista
## 
### David Smoten 
As Valentine's Day draws near, love-struck
people everywhere begin planning how and
where to spend this national day of pro
grammed romance. No restaurant on the
mid-peninsula has come to embody roman
tic dining more than Bella Vista Continental
Restaurant in Woodside. Unfortunately, as is
often the case with pricey restaurants-with
a-view, the food is not quite as spectacular as
the view.
Perched amid the towering redwoods
along beautiful Skyline Boulevard, the cozy
Bella Vista lives up to its name by affording
dramatic views of the sloping foothills and
the San Francisco Bay. The restaurant's three
panoramic dining rooms are ringed with
table-to-ceiling windows whose views are
framed by sturdy pines and majestic red
woods. These dining rooms were once the
back terrace of a home originally built on the
site in the 19205, and the terrace construc
tion adds to the feeling of being suspended
amid the trees.
