# Bella Vista offers Valentine's romance
## 
### 
Bella Vista's low interior lighting enhances
the outside view and adds to the restaurant's
romantic charm. Antique-style candle lamps
with soft white, rose-adorned glass shades
cast a warm glow on each table, creating an
intimate space apart from the rest of the
bustling dining room. Each table is set with a
clear vase holding a single rose.
If you are lucky enough to be seated next
to one of the windows in the central dining
room, you will be treated to the table service
of one of the knowledgable waitstaff, most of
who have been there more than ten years.
Friendly and down-to-earth despite his black
jacket and bow tie, our waiter quick with
helpful advice and well-steeped in the lore of
the locale. I suggest enjoying the working
fireplace in the full service bar while waiting
for a window-side seat to open. The exposed
wood ceiling beams and neatly stacked fire
wood give the bar the look and feel of a Lake
Tahoe ski chalet.
We began our dinner with one of the
evening's appetizer specials, broiled mussels
in garlic butter sauce ($11.95). The six large
and succulent mussels came served on the
half shell, dripping with the delicious garlic
butter sauce. Bella Vista takes its hors d' oeu
vres seriously. The restaurant offers twelve
different hot and cold options, including
three different oyster dishes (Rockefeller,
$11.95; Kilpatrick, $11.95; and Blue Point,
$8.95), two varieties of escargot (de Bour
gogne; and aux Champignons, $9.95), and
two shrimp appetizers (Crevettes Bordelaisc
for two, $ 14.95; and Petites Crevettes, $8.95).
In addition, the menu includes two fettucci
ni appetizers (Alfredo for two, $8.95; Von
gole for two, $10.50).

We bypassed the lentil and onion soups,
opting instead for a tender and delicious
warm spinach salad (Les epinards au bacon
[for two], $13.50). The salad menu also in
cludes the tantalizing Liaison Bella Vista
(shrimp, mushrooms, cucumber, bacon, av
ocado, Feta cheese [for two], $13.50). French
classics les epinards & la crdme (creamed
spinach, $4.25) and champignons saut£
(mushroom saut£, $4.95) are also available.
Bella Vista's entree menu is not for the veg
etarian crowd. Entrees are divided into five
categories: seafood, veal, lamb, poultry, and
beef. I selected from the unpolitically-correct
milk-fed veal list, settling on Veau Jerusalem
(saut£ veal with light cream sauce, artichoke
hearts and mushrooms, $19.95). The veal
came accompanied by rice pilaf, zucchini,
and steamed baby carrots. Although tasty, the
dish on the whole was uninspired and not un
like veal dishes I have had for much less.
My date chose the calamari d'ore, breaded
and saut£ed, served with broiled potatoes,
zucchini, and steamed baby carrots ($16.95).
The calamari was sufficiently tender and fla
vorful, but a little heavy on the oil.
In all honesty, I have to admit to expecting a
little more of the entrees at Bella Vista. The pre
sentation, the selection of side dishes, and the
preparation of our entrees all reminded me of
many lesser restaurants and diners. Perhaps
other entrees would have been a bigger hit.
People speak highly of I .a Liaison Bella
Vista (steak and prawns, $23.95), and the
Steak Diane ($24.95) is prepared for you in the
dining room. Poulet a la Curacao (chicken
sautded in butter with mandarin oranges and
seedless grapes, $16.95) piqued my curiosity,
but for the most part, Bella Vista's menu does

not experiment much, and most items are
quite straightforward and basic. If our choices
were any indication, I would recommend
staying away from the sauces and sautes, and
opting instead for the broiled dishes such as
Veau Porterhouse (broiled veal chop with
lemon, white wine, and herbs, $24.95) or
Noisettes d'Agneau Dijonnaisc (loin of lamb
broiled with Dijon mustard sauce, $21.95).
The dessert menu is short and sweet. In
the"For Two" category, Bella Vista offers
Cerises Jubilees (cherries jubilee, $13.00) and
two souffles (Grand Marnier and chocolate,
$12.95). For those who like to order alone,
there's creme caramel ($3.95), New York
style cheesecake ($4.95), and mousse an
chocolat (chocolate mousse, $4.50). We or
dered the souffle chocolat, which came sur
rounded by an exquisite chocolate sauce with
Grand Marnier.
If it's romantic dining that you seek, Bella
Vista will not let you down. With intimate ta
bles bathed in soft candlelight, waiters in
black tie, a spectacular view, and plenty of
items on the menu "for two", you can't go
wrong. If you're searching for the ultimate
culinary experience, however, I recommend
dining elsewhere and enjoying the view from
any vista point along Skyline Boulevard.

but for the most part, Bella Vista's menu does

not experiment much, and most items are
quite straightforward and basic. If our choices
were any indication, I would recommend
staying away from the sauces and sautes, and
opting instead for the broiled dishes such as
Veau Porterhouse (broiled veal chop with
lemon, white wine, and herbs, $24.95) or
Noisettes d'Agneau Dijonnaisc (loin of lamb
broiled with Dijon mustard sauce, $21.95).
The dessert menu is short and sweet. In
the"For Two" category, Bella Vista offers
Cerises Jubilees (cherries jubilee, $13.00) and
two souffles (Grand Marnier and chocolate,
$12.95). For those who like to order alone,
there's creme caramel ($3.95), New York
style cheesecake ($4.95), and mousse an
chocolat (chocolate mousse, $4.50). We or
dered the souffle chocolat, which came sur
rounded by an exquisite chocolate sauce with
Grand Marnier.
If it's romantic dining that you seek, Bella
Vista will not let you down. With intimate ta
bles bathed in soft candlelight, waiters in
black tie, a spectacular view, and plenty of
items on the menu "for two", you can't go
wrong. If you're searching for the ultimate
culinary experience, however, I recommend
dining elsewhere and enjoying the view from
any vista point along Skyline Boulevard.
