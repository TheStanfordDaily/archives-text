# Clawing at new and old: Tennessee Williams' one acts
## 
### Samuel Park 
At the rise ot the curtain, there are a group
of artsy New Yorkers (long-filter cigarettes and
Dorothy Parker frowns), talking at Maine's
about a show from that obscure Southern

playwright Tennessee Williams.
"What a shocking show. The

singing hustlers, the
. . ... 1 _ A *

women cnanting
about creamed

entrees, the
leather..

"So avant-garde, so unexpected. This hoy,
this Tennessee creature, is no doubt a fresh
voice of the theatre."
The above quotes have been made up and
have no relation, however incidental, with the
truth. They do, however, describe a possible re
action, in a world parallel to ours, to Williams'
"Now the Cats with Jeweled Claws." A later
work ('81) coming from a different, more
splashy Williams than the one who wrote "A
Streetcar Named Desire" and "(>at on a 1 lot Tin
Root," the show will have its world premiere
tonight at the Eleanor Prosser Studio at 8 p.m.
"Now the Cats with Jeweled Claws" is one of
two one-act plays by Williams presented by the
Drama Department. A more traditional
Williams work, "27 Wagons full of Cotton," is
the other. Billed as a Mississippi Delta tragi
comedy, it presents the great American play
wright (and subject of a recently published and
much talked-about new biography) in more
familiar territory. The play deals with sexual
repression and commercial deceit in a cottage
near Blue Mountain, Miss.

I'"ra^niv 111 ed charactcrs
The 27 wagons of the
title refer to the cotton
that Silva Vicarro (Tay
lor Antrim), a Latin
American outcast living
in '3()s Delta country,
needs to gin out in an
important order from a
costumer. One evening,
a tire at his plantation
destroys his business
and forces him to go to
another gin owner, Jake
Meighan (Joel Dresch
er), who is able to take
over the order from
him.
Silva, however, be
gins to suspect that lake
is responsible for the
fire. When he finds him
self alone with Jake's
wife Flora (Cori Nelson)
at the Meighan porch,
thoughts of revenge
come to him, and he di
rects the action towards
a sinuous, tortured trap
that could eventually
unravel all three of their
lives.
Hut beneath the ac
tion happening on the
stage, there is an edgy,
disturbing subtext to

the actions and dialogue ot the characters. And
this inner layer is what attracted director Car
oline Nastro to the play. A graduate student in
the 1 )rama 1 department, Nastro was interested
in the tact that, despite a traditional story line,
many things in the play don't quite fit.

" The characters aren't at all

normal," said Nastro. "The play it
sell is not fragmented, vet the

characters and their

intentions and
what they're
going through

are fragmented.
The characters deal with really bizzarre
things. The arsonist lake, for instance, destroys
Silva but then allows Silva to enter his life and
spend time with Flora. This act raises ques
tions about Jake's relationship with Flora.
"There are all these strange things going on
under an apparently sane narrative," said Nas
tro.
Williams' enthusiasts will recognize in
Flora something of Blanche Dußois from
"Streetcar." l.ike Dußois, Flora is somewhat
out of touch with reality and brims with re
pressed sexuality. The fact that the actors here
are college students adds to the play's erotic ap
peal and the sexual tension.
Jake, for instance, who is described in the
script as a tat man of 60, is played by a tall and
muscular Drescher, who wears a sleeveless
white T-shirt and tight blue jeans in the show.
Flora, who is referred to in the play as a fleshy
woman, is played by a thin actress. The final ef
fort ic ft-i-if the covi-al toncinnc iiKoron*
nil i.> uuu 1111 UALiiti ItiiSlOna milium in im
play come to the surface.
Also heightening the underlying eroticism
of the play is Antrim's presence. Though the

character is supposed to
he a small and wiry Latin
American man,
Antrim's Vicarro is a
blue-eyed, wide-shoul
dered messenger from
Eros. Casting con
straints often prevent di
rectors from getting
exact types for their play,
but in this case the con
straints may have actual
ly helped convey some of
the play's subtext.
Another way in
which the play conveys
its themes is through the
simple yet symbolic set.
Nastro uses the basic set
(porch, door, swing) to
examine and reveal

some of the undercurrents in the play.
"When these people's lives become unsta
ble, they flee immediately to their imaginary
worlds," said Nastro. "The swing suggests a
rocky, unstable life. The porch is symbolic, and
the characters only step on it in specific mo
ments. It is defining a more unreal environ
ment. Flora almost never steps off the porch
unless forced to, and these are frightening mo
ments for her."
"Total strangeness"
More than 40 years separate "27 Wagons"
from "Now the Cats with Jeweled Claws." The
Tennessee Williams who wrote it is a different
man, exploring the comic nightmares of New
York. The Southern accents have been replaced
by the catty, quick-as-a-dagger diction of
upper-class, shop-till-you-drop women.
Good-bye country people, hello rich bitches
and street hustlers. Williams wrote it two years
before he died.
"It was .1 periotrpf paranoia for him,' said
director I.hren Fordyce. "He was taking speed
at the time. He was a little bit distant from the
world. I le hadn't had a hit for a while, so he was
out of the circuit."
So out of the circuit in fact, that the play fell
into obscurity after he died. Fordyce, a visiting
lecturer in the Drama Department, found it
not in Piavbiii but in Wiiiiams "Collected
Works." "It doesn't (it in his oeuvre in any clear
way," said Fordyce.
Indeed, unlike "27 Wagons," "Now the
Cats" has no clear storyline, the characters talk
in non-sequiturs and there is no clear connec
tion between the characters aside from the fact
that they all happen to be at a restaurant at the
same time.
"This latter play, now, is formally an excep
tion for Williams," said Fordyce. "It's not about
story. It's more about tones, more about im
ages. It's a lot more fragmented as a play. And
it's very strange." Set in a brutal, violent New
York, far from Williams' pastoral Southern ter
ritory, the play eavesdrops on the lunch con
versations of two very different sets of people.
Madge (kimberly Dienes) and Bea (Leah
Flalouf), sophisticated ladies who like to shop,
exchange trivialities and seem to be at the
restaurant for no apparent reason. Halfway
through the play, a pair of male hustlers
(leather jackets and pink shirts) come in. One

hustler (Drew Rapp) feels degraded and wants
love. The other one (Akin Salawu), more prac
tical, has an easier time unzipping for
strangers.
"There is a 'total strangeness' to it that I
didn't expect from a Williams play; people get
ting blowjobs, women talking about riots,"
said Fordyce.
Some of the language ("fucking a cunt,"
"dancing old fag") is also unexpected. But the
biggest surprise of all might be thedancingand
the singing in the show.
"One of the exciting things about staging
this production was to figure out these crazy
stage directions in the play," said Fordyce.
That includes a dialogue sung "in the style
of a Gregorian chant" and a dance which ex
presses the male prostitute's "loneliness, fear,
his violated manhood."
"So we get into rehearsal and the actors are
like, 'Are we gonna do this?" " said Fordyce.
"You come across these things and you don't
know what is going on in his head. Then you
try this out and realize this guy has an amazing
theatrical sensibility."
I he singing, according to Fordyce, suggests
the vulnerability of the characters, and the
dancing shows the hustler's vulnerability
through performance.

Tonight's show, advertised as "Two Sides ol

of America's most revered playwrights. "27
Wagons" has a veneer of normality, only hint
ing at the perversions; "Now the Cats" in
dulges in the bizarre and the menacing. One is
set at a pastoral time gone by; the other in the
madness of modern times. What they share is
Williams' interest in the erotic aspect of peo

a sinuous, tortured trap
that could eventually
unravel all three of their
lives.
Hut beneath the ac
tion happening on the
stage, there is an edgy,
disturbing subtext to

the actions and dialogue ot the characters. And
this inner layer is what attracted director Car
oline Nastro to the play. A graduate student in
the 1 )rama 1 department, Nastro was interested
in the tact that, despite a traditional story line,
many things in the play don't quite fit.

" The characters aren't at all

normal," said Nastro. "The play it
sell is not fragmented, vet the

characters and their

intentions and
what they're
going through

are fragmented.
The characters deal with really bizzarre
things. The arsonist lake, for instance, destroys
Silva but then allows Silva to enter his life and
spend time with Flora. This act raises ques
tions about Jake's relationship with Flora.
"There are all these strange things going on
under an apparently sane narrative," said Nas
tro.
Williams' enthusiasts will recognize in
Flora something of Blanche Dußois from
"Streetcar." l.ike Dußois, Flora is somewhat
out of touch with reality and brims with re
pressed sexuality. The fact that the actors here
are college students adds to the play's erotic ap
peal and the sexual tension.
Jake, for instance, who is described in the
script as a tat man of 60, is played by a tall and
muscular Drescher, who wears a sleeveless
white T-shirt and tight blue jeans in the show.
Flora, who is referred to in the play as a fleshy
woman, is played by a thin actress. The final ef
fort ic ft-i-if the covi-al toncinnc iiKoron*
nil i.> uuu 1111 UALiiti ItiiSlOna milium in im
play come to the surface.
Also heightening the underlying eroticism
of the play is Antrim's presence. Though the

character is supposed to
he a small and wiry Latin
American man,
Antrim's Vicarro is a
blue-eyed, wide-shoul
dered messenger from
Eros. Casting con
straints often prevent di
rectors from getting
exact types for their play,
but in this case the con
straints may have actual
ly helped convey some of
the play's subtext.
Another way in
which the play conveys
its themes is through the
simple yet symbolic set.
Nastro uses the basic set
(porch, door, swing) to
examine and reveal

some of the undercurrents in the play.
"When these people's lives become unsta
ble, they flee immediately to their imaginary
worlds," said Nastro. "The swing suggests a
rocky, unstable life. The porch is symbolic, and
the characters only step on it in specific mo
ments. It is defining a more unreal environ
ment. Flora almost never steps off the porch
unless forced to, and these are frightening mo
ments for her."
"Total strangeness"
More than 40 years separate "27 Wagons"
from "Now the Cats with Jeweled Claws." The
Tennessee Williams who wrote it is a different
man, exploring the comic nightmares of New
York. The Southern accents have been replaced
by the catty, quick-as-a-dagger diction of
upper-class, shop-till-you-drop women.
Good-bye country people, hello rich bitches
and street hustlers. Williams wrote it two years
before he died.
"It was .1 periotrpf paranoia for him,' said
director I.hren Fordyce. "He was taking speed
at the time. He was a little bit distant from the
world. I le hadn't had a hit for a while, so he was
out of the circuit."
So out of the circuit in fact, that the play fell
into obscurity after he died. Fordyce, a visiting
lecturer in the Drama Department, found it
not in Piavbiii but in Wiiiiams "Collected
Works." "It doesn't (it in his oeuvre in any clear
way," said Fordyce.
Indeed, unlike "27 Wagons," "Now the
Cats" has no clear storyline, the characters talk
in non-sequiturs and there is no clear connec
tion between the characters aside from the fact
that they all happen to be at a restaurant at the
same time.
"This latter play, now, is formally an excep
tion for Williams," said Fordyce. "It's not about
story. It's more about tones, more about im
ages. It's a lot more fragmented as a play. And
it's very strange." Set in a brutal, violent New
York, far from Williams' pastoral Southern ter
ritory, the play eavesdrops on the lunch con
versations of two very different sets of people.
Madge (kimberly Dienes) and Bea (Leah
Flalouf), sophisticated ladies who like to shop,
exchange trivialities and seem to be at the
restaurant for no apparent reason. Halfway
through the play, a pair of male hustlers
(leather jackets and pink shirts) come in. One

hustler (Drew Rapp) feels degraded and wants
love. The other one (Akin Salawu), more prac
tical, has an easier time unzipping for
strangers.
"There is a 'total strangeness' to it that I
didn't expect from a Williams play; people get
ting blowjobs, women talking about riots,"
said Fordyce.
Some of the language ("fucking a cunt,"
"dancing old fag") is also unexpected. But the
biggest surprise of all might be thedancingand
the singing in the show.
"One of the exciting things about staging
this production was to figure out these crazy
stage directions in the play," said Fordyce.
That includes a dialogue sung "in the style
of a Gregorian chant" and a dance which ex
presses the male prostitute's "loneliness, fear,
his violated manhood."
"So we get into rehearsal and the actors are
like, 'Are we gonna do this?" " said Fordyce.
"You come across these things and you don't
know what is going on in his head. Then you
try this out and realize this guy has an amazing
theatrical sensibility."
I he singing, according to Fordyce, suggests
the vulnerability of the characters, and the
dancing shows the hustler's vulnerability
through performance.

splashy Williams than the one who wrote "A
Streetcar Named Desire" and "(>at on a 1 lot Tin

tonight at the Eleanor Prosser Studio at 8 p.m.
"Now the Cats with Jeweled Claws" is one of
two one-act plays by Williams presented by the
Drama Department. A more traditional
Williams work, "27 Wagons full of Cotton," is
the other. Billed as a Mississippi Delta tragi
comedy, it presents the great American play
wright (and subject of a recently published and
much talked-about new biography) in more
familiar territory. The play deals with sexual
repression and commercial deceit in a cottage
near Blue Mountain, Miss.

I'"ra^niv 111 ed charactcrs
The 27 wagons of the
title refer to the cotton
that Silva Vicarro (Tay
lor Antrim), a Latin
American outcast living
in '3()s Delta country,
needs to gin out in an
important order from a
costumer. One evening,
a tire at his plantation
destroys his business
and forces him to go to
another gin owner, Jake
Meighan (Joel Dresch
er), who is able to take
over the order from
him.
Silva, however, be
gins to suspect that lake
is responsible for the
fire. When he finds him
self alone with Jake's
wife Flora (Cori Nelson)
at the Meighan porch,
thoughts of revenge
come to him, and he di
rects the action towards
a sinuous, tortured trap
that could eventually
unravel all three of their
lives.
