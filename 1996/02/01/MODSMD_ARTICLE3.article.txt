### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The downsizing of t he educational system is the
biggest issue facing universities today, State Sen.
Tom 1 layden said yesterday.
1 layden, a Democrat known for his activism in
the 1960s before he turned to a career in politics,
was on campus to research a new book and cam
paign for a colleague. He chairs the senate's Select
Committee on Higher Education.
The rising costs of education, coupled with de
clining student aid and a shrinking student body,
arc challenges facing universities today, Hayden
said in an interview with The Daily.
"The issue is (he closing of the doors, or the
downsizing of higher education in California," he
said.
There is a growing tidal wave of students —
many of them women and minorities — who are
vying for a limited number of positions in Califor
nia's schools, Hayden said. While previous waves,
such as the influx of students going to school on
the GI Bill, have been accommodated, doors are
closing in the faces of the latest rush of students,
he said.
Affirmative action is closely tied to the issue, he

said, because the same people who
favor decreased funding or enroll
ment don't want to provide educa
tion to minorities.
Rather than allow for the in
creasing number of students, uni
versities will "change admission
requirements or standards so it
will appear the tidal wave has dis
appeared," Hayden said.
Because of increasing tuition
even at the state's public universi
ties, more than 200,000 students
have been pushed away from high
er education, Hayden said.
Universities must curb the
costs, he said. "They can't raise
tuition any more without losing
students."
In addition, the struggle will
continue over "what needs to be

taught and what needs to be re
searched . . . whether students
and faculty will he able to uncover
the chapters of history that have
been neglected," he said.
Issues such as affirmative ac
tion and California's Proposition
187 — a bill passed in 1994 that
would cut off many social services
for illegal immigrants — have only
served to cover up some of this his
tory and increase the division be
tween classes, Hayden said.
Another factor that has con
tributed to the widening of the di
vide is technology, he said. Despite
its practical applications to educa
tion, so few groups can take ad
vantage of the equipment that it is
ineffective, he said.
Divisions in society are "over
laid by the Information Super
highway, which only has on
ramps for the wealthy," Hayden
said. "It can only be a small part of
the population."

For students in lower-class
areas, many of whom are recent
immigrants, "going to school is
like combat duty," Hayden said.
"These people are geniuses at cer
tain things like Nintendo . . . but
when they go to school or go home,
there is no technology."
Unfortunately, "new technolo
gy has less of a constituency," he
said, than other issues like curb
ing crime rates.
"Prisons are more important
than computers" for most of the
state, he said.
Hayden also mentioned the
issue of community service learn
ing, at which, he said, Stanford is
"better than most."
An emphasis should be placed
on community service, he said,
suggesting that partial tuition
waivers or academic credit should
be considered as methods of en
couraging students to participate
in community service.
