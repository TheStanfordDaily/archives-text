# Stormy views on 'The Tempest’
## 
### Alison Gordon 
"These our actors,
As I foretold you, were all spirits ami
Are welted into air, into thin air;
... We are such stuff
As dreams are made on, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep."
The power of theatrical illusion, of con
trolling imaginative boundaries, is
central to Shakespeare's "The Tem
pest." Such self-conscious theatricality sets a
challenge for any production — achieving a
successful balance between the techniques and
special effects and the richness of a script that
rings with poetry and music is never easy.
The American Conservatory Theater,
under the artistic direction of Carey Perl off,
has undertaken this challenge in its new
"Homecoming" production, which runs
through Feb. IS, and inaugurates the glitter
ingly restored Ceary Theater.
I he production presents a magnificent vi
sual feast — scrims lit from behind produce
some wonderful tableaux in silhouette; a
trough of water at the front of the stage is em
ployed to subtle effect; a rotating stage sug
gests the transience of the world we have en
tered — but fails to draw out and utilize the
one asset the playwright furnished long ago:
the language. Many of the actors seem to bat
tle with the words instead of using them as
weapons.
In a play where magic and dreams are spun
from a foundation of poetry, where the con
clusion insists upon the insubstantialityof illu
sion but endorses the transforming potential
of language, this is the greatest disappointment
of the A( T production.
Projected visions: the confusion of existence
T he stage darkens. The Kronos Quartet
housed in the orchestra pit begins to play furi
ously. I .oud claps of thunder roll over the audi
torium, now momentarily flooded in white
and blue light. Huge masts of a partial ship
sway and its wide sails billow wildly.
The stage heaves. Barely audible voices can
be heard shouting questions, protesting faith
and crying out farewell. The words float in the
air, and then, as it they have somehow been
caught, materialize as written projections on
the main sail.
"What cares these roarers lor the name of a
king," brightly-lighted words swim over rip
pling material only to be lost to sight — a sym
bolical casting off: The solidity of language has
no place in this turmoil.
Clever directorial touches in this opening
scene produce stunning effects and skillfully
establish the central themes of the play — the
disparity between illusion and reality, the role
of nature and the spectacular, the instability of
order and hierarchy, the quest for control. In
this initial scene, we see not only a sinking ship,
but a dissolving universe.

A strange new world.
Complete dark. Silence, l ur away from the
(ury of the winds, the powerful magician, l'ros
pero (played with rather too much venom and
too little compassion by I )avid Strathairn), and
his naive daughter, Miranda (Vera Farmiga),
watch the proceedings.While Prospero narrates
the strange story of his past, we become ac
quainted with the place that is his home.
The stage design by Kate Hdmunds is simple
but striking. A circular platform, encircled in
white paper to facilitate some beautiful light

itig effects, raises the center of the stage. The
back wall is a semicircular scrim made of the
same crumpled, crater-like paper for the pur
pose of projecting images. The result is a bar
ren, bleak moon-scape which possesses a won
derful natural asset — the potential for multi

pie transformations. Lit from different angles
and flooded with different colors, the stage
constantly changes. In this way, it reinforces
the theme of insubstantiality of both the island
and the status of the characters who inhabit it.
From the tale that he tells, we learn that
Prospero is 111 fact the rightful duke of Milan,
but was shipwrecked on this enchanted island
with his daughter and a host of spirits 12 years
ago. Now, wielding his magic to wreak havoc
with the powers of nature, he has decided to
bring the boat carrying his brother Antonio
(well played by Michael Santo), who usurped

his throne, and the king of Naples (James Car
penter) to the island. In this way, he hopes to
find a mate for Miranda in the personage of
Prince Ferdinand of Naples (the soft Daniel
Cantor); bring his usurpers to justice and re
claim the country that is rightly his.

Order Unbound
Prospero has two servants on the island:
Ariel (eloquently and gently drawn by David
Patrick Kelly), a spirit of the air who helps per
form his magic, and Caliban (played with little
subtlety by Graham Beckel), a disfigured, re
pulsive savage.
Appropriately, the lighting design and
shadow work predominate around the
sprightly figure of Ariel. One episode is parti*,
ularly memorable. Antonio and Sebastian, the
king of Naples' bother, stand at the back of the
raised stage plotting murder. Suddenly, from
behind them, a huge profile silhouette of
Ariel's face is projected onto the scrim. Togeth
erwith Ariel's haunting voice amplified on mi
crophone, the scene invokes the essence of her
spirituality and invades not only the set but the
auditorium. Created from a position offstage,
this is powerful theater indeed.
Prospero's other servant, the savage and
grotesque Caliban, speaks some of the most
beautiful poetry in the play. Ironically, it is
when he gives his allegiance to the king's drunk
en butler Stephano (the hilarious Geoff 112 foyle)
and his equally ambunctious cohort, Trinculo
(an adorable ruffian in the hands of Michael
Tucker), that he is shown at his most lyrical.
"The isle is full of noises," Caliban tells his
unappreciative audience. "Sounds and sweet
airs that give delight and hurt not." But neither
the comic duo nor the auditorium are to be
blamed for failing to notice the magic in the
language. For few of the lines realize their full
potential in terms of impact — the actors
rarely differentiate or emphasize the words
they speak. The production is so busy produc
ing special effects, it forgets to take the time
needed to convey that language in this play also
possesses an illusory and hypnotic power.
"My charms are all o'erthrown."
The ending of the play, in its sheer theatrical
bravery, creates a lingering residue of magic
which refuses to be quelled even by the Unguis
tic limitations of the production.
As Prospero speaks the epilogue, having
vowed to forsake his art and return to realit\
and his rightful throne in Milan, the house
lights are semi-lit and the scrim at the back of
the stage rises. The audience can thus see
"backstage" — an area filled with a plethora of
technical gadgetry, complicated projectors,
random chairs, untidy stands of lights and
empty boxes. The sudden effect is stunning.
Prospero, at first appearing alarmed, gradu
ally collects himself enough to entreat us:
"As you from crimes would pardoned be.
Let your indulgence set me free."
Once again, his words are overshadowed by
technical wizardry, but the audience, drawing
breath in wonder of the visual display before
their eyes, arc too entranced to notice. The
loud clapping of their hands is testimony
enough that sheer theatricality still captivates.
