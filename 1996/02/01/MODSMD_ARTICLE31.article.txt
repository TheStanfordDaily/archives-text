# San Francisco Symphony's music to your ears
## 
### Gabricla Teodorescu 
It one is to judge the caliber of the rest of
the San Francisco Symphony's season
by the sweeping sounds of I.udwig van
Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 in A major,
then one can assume that the season will be
an undebatable success.
Christoph Eschenbach was the guest con
ductor tor that particular performance,
which also included Robert

Schumann's Overture to "The
Bride of Messina" and Miklos
Rosza's Violin Concerto,

Opus 24. Eschenbach, who is
the music director of the
Houston Symphony, con
ducted the San Francisco

Symphony delicately and pre-

cisely — his version of
Beethoven's Seventh was the most

beautiful I ve heard, and the melancholy sec
ond movement brought tears to mine and
my companion's eyes.
The first two pieces were also moving. The
San Francisco Symphony premiere of "The
Bride of Messina" was interesting and prop
erly conducted, while violin soloist Ray
mond Kobler was very skilled with Rosza's
piece. Nonetheless, Beethoven's symphony
stole the show and led to four standing ova
tions in Davies Symphony Hall, certainly a
harbinger of excellence to come.
A \cw Tacc ( oiuluct iiil; a
(ircat Symphony
The symphony's 1995-96 campaign began
with a new conductor, Michael Tilson
Thomas, whose contract extends to the year
2000. Maestro Tilson Thomas has served as
principal guest conductor of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, principal guest con
ductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic
(1981-1985) and principal conductor of the
Great Woods Music Festival from (1985-

1988). More importantly,
he conducted the Lon
don Symphony Orches
tra for eight years before
coming to San Francisco.
He is also founder of the
New World Symphony
and continues to serve as
its artistic director.
Thomas' innovation
and boldness are well
known. In fact, the sym
phony's brochure is enti
tled "New Spirit for a
Coming Century," and
that kind of inspiration is
iust one of the reasons the
symphony should be vis
ited sometime between
now and spring break.

The first performances
the symphony offers in
February is a four-day run
(Feb. 1-4) of Richard
Strauss' "Don Quixote,"
which is guest conducted
by Vladimir Ashkenazy.
Ashkenazy promises to do
a stunning job, as he is
chief conductor of the
Deutsches Symphonie-
Orchester Berlin and has
served as music director o
London's Royal Philhar
monic Orchestra (1987-
1994). The perfor
mances feature SFS

principal violist Geral
dine Walther and
principal cellist
Michael Grebanier.
The program also
tures Beethoven's

"Leonore" Overture,
No. 1, as well as Elgar's "In the South (Alas
sio)." Be aware that the first performance
is at the Flint Center in Cupertino, but the
last three are at 1 )avies Symphony Hall.
If you're not really in the mood for
the typical symphony fare, you should
head to Davies Hall on Feb. 6. That
evening — and that evening only — fea
tures the British ensemble Academy of St.
Martin in the Fields. Known as "the most
recorded chamber symphony in the
world" and conducted by Kenneth Sillito,
they have a program which begins with
1 landel's Concerto Grosso in A major and
).S. Bach's Concerto in I) major for three
violins and strings. It ends with a couple
of more modern pieces, the first of which
is Igor Stravinsky's Concerto in I)

Major for string orchestra and Dvo
rak's Serenade in 1 ; Major for string
orchestra.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's
reputation among the young

has really improved
since that movie about
him came out, and it
that's the only expo-

sure you've had to

Mozart, then the Feb. 8-10 performances

are a must-see. No less
than four Mozart
pieces are to be heard:
his Violin Concerto No.
2 in I) major, "L'amero

saro constante" from"II
re pastore," "Vorrei spie
garvi, oh Dio" and "Hxsul
tate, jubilate." The Mozart

arias allow soprano Olga
Makarina to make her San Francisco debut.
The evening ends with Tchaikovsky's Sere
nade in C major for strings. The guest con
ductor is Vladimir Spivakov, who has re-

ceived much international acclaim and
founded the highly-regarded chamber

orchestra Moscow Virtuosi.
Another premiere is Dmitri
Shostakovich's Symphony No. 13,
"Babi Yar," which features Kirov

Opera bass Sergei Alexashkin on
Valentine's Day and Feb. 16-17. The
emotional piece is set to five moving

poems about life under totalitarianism by
Russian poet Yevgenii Yevtushenko, and
the guest conductor is the Russian Yuri
Temirkanov. Also, the evening begins with
Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 17. The

end of February finally brings Tilson
Thomas to the podium when he con-

ducts Berlioz's "Symphonic fantas
tique." It promises to be a fabulou

evening, which also includes 1 lar
rison's Canticle No. 3 and Mil

baud's "The Creation of the
World." These performances
run Feb. 29 through March 3

and are all at Davies Symphony
Hall.
The beginning of March, admitted-

ly, brings anxiety and stress because of dead
week and the dawn of final exams. Neverthe
less, in the brief time preceding pain, take a
date to one of the following concerts. Step
ping to the podium is Tilson Thomas con
ducting Aaron Copland's "Symhonic Ode"
and Mahler's Symphony No. 5. This runs
from March (->-8 at Davies Symphony Hall.
The last two programs that run before

exam week arc bound to be worth leaving
campus for, maybe even in a group. On
March 9, there is a Youth Orchestra Concert
which features some distinctive pieces.

The first is Vaughan Williams' "Fanta
sia" on a theme by Thomas Tall is, fol
lowed by Richard Strauss' "Till Ku

lenspiegel's Merry Pranks." The
k evening closes with Brahms' Sym
phony No. 2. The conductor tor this
evening is Alasdair Neale. Finally,
for all those piano aficionados at

Stanford — you know who you are; you

play the piano in your dorm until people
ask you to stop — renowned pianist Alfred
Brendel gives the final performance of
Beethoven's sonata cycle as part of the Great
Performers Series.
So, either with the advent of Valentine's
Day or simply as a post-midterm celebration,
going to the city and enjoying its beauty and
then listening to the magnificent sounds of
the San Francisco Symphony is a trip worth
taking.

Thomas' innovation
and boldness are well
known. In fact, the sym
phony's brochure is enti
tled "New Spirit for a
Coming Century," and
that kind of inspiration is
iust one of the reasons the
symphony should be vis
ited sometime between
now and spring break.

The first performances
the symphony offers in
February is a four-day run
(Feb. 1-4) of Richard
Strauss' "Don Quixote,"
which is guest conducted
by Vladimir Ashkenazy.
Ashkenazy promises to do
a stunning job, as he is
chief conductor of the
Deutsches Symphonie-
Orchester Berlin and has
served as music director o
London's Royal Philhar
monic Orchestra (1987-
1994). The perfor
mances feature SFS

principal violist Geral
dine Walther and
principal cellist
Michael Grebanier.
The program also
tures Beethoven's

"Leonore" Overture,
No. 1, as well as Elgar's "In the South (Alas
sio)." Be aware that the first performance
is at the Flint Center in Cupertino, but the
last three are at 1 )avies Symphony Hall.
If you're not really in the mood for
the typical symphony fare, you should
head to Davies Hall on Feb. 6. That
evening — and that evening only — fea
tures the British ensemble Academy of St.
Martin in the Fields. Known as "the most
recorded chamber symphony in the
world" and conducted by Kenneth Sillito,
they have a program which begins with
1 landel's Concerto Grosso in A major and
).S. Bach's Concerto in I) major for three
violins and strings. It ends with a couple
of more modern pieces, the first of which
is Igor Stravinsky's Concerto in I)

Major for string orchestra and Dvo
rak's Serenade in 1 ; Major for string
orchestra.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's
reputation among the young

has really improved
since that movie about
him came out, and it
that's the only expo-

sure you've had to

Mozart, then the Feb. 8-10 performances

are a must-see. No less
than four Mozart
pieces are to be heard:
his Violin Concerto No.
2 in I) major, "L'amero

saro constante" from"II
re pastore," "Vorrei spie
garvi, oh Dio" and "Hxsul
tate, jubilate." The Mozart

arias allow soprano Olga
Makarina to make her San Francisco debut.
The evening ends with Tchaikovsky's Sere
nade in C major for strings. The guest con
ductor is Vladimir Spivakov, who has re-

ceived much international acclaim and
founded the highly-regarded chamber

orchestra Moscow Virtuosi.
Another premiere is Dmitri
Shostakovich's Symphony No. 13,
"Babi Yar," which features Kirov

Opera bass Sergei Alexashkin on
Valentine's Day and Feb. 16-17. The
emotional piece is set to five moving

poems about life under totalitarianism by
Russian poet Yevgenii Yevtushenko, and
the guest conductor is the Russian Yuri
Temirkanov. Also, the evening begins with
Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 17. The

end of February finally brings Tilson
Thomas to the podium when he con-

ducts Berlioz's "Symphonic fantas
tique." It promises to be a fabulou

evening, which also includes 1 lar
rison's Canticle No. 3 and Mil

baud's "The Creation of the
World." These performances
run Feb. 29 through March 3

and are all at Davies Symphony
Hall.
The beginning of March, admitted-

ly, brings anxiety and stress because of dead
week and the dawn of final exams. Neverthe
less, in the brief time preceding pain, take a
date to one of the following concerts. Step
ping to the podium is Tilson Thomas con
ducting Aaron Copland's "Symhonic Ode"
and Mahler's Symphony No. 5. This runs
from March (->-8 at Davies Symphony Hall.
The last two programs that run before

exam week arc bound to be worth leaving
campus for, maybe even in a group. On
March 9, there is a Youth Orchestra Concert
which features some distinctive pieces.

The first is Vaughan Williams' "Fanta
sia" on a theme by Thomas Tall is, fol
lowed by Richard Strauss' "Till Ku

lenspiegel's Merry Pranks." The
k evening closes with Brahms' Sym
phony No. 2. The conductor tor this
evening is Alasdair Neale. Finally,
for all those piano aficionados at

Stanford — you know who you are; you

play the piano in your dorm until people
ask you to stop — renowned pianist Alfred
Brendel gives the final performance of
Beethoven's sonata cycle as part of the Great
Performers Series.
So, either with the advent of Valentine's
Day or simply as a post-midterm celebration,
going to the city and enjoying its beauty and
then listening to the magnificent sounds of
the San Francisco Symphony is a trip worth
taking.

It one is to judge the caliber of the rest of
the San Francisco Symphony's season
by the sweeping sounds of I.udwig van
Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 in A major,
then one can assume that the season will be
an undebatable success.
Christoph Eschenbach was the guest con
ductor tor that particular performance,
which also included Robert

Schumann's Overture to "The
Bride of Messina" and Miklos
Rosza's Violin Concerto,

Opus 24. Eschenbach, who is
the music director of the
Houston Symphony, con
ducted the San Francisco

Symphony delicately and pre-

cisely — his version of
Beethoven's Seventh was the most

beautiful I ve heard, and the melancholy sec
ond movement brought tears to mine and
my companion's eyes.
The first two pieces were also moving. The
San Francisco Symphony premiere of "The
Bride of Messina" was interesting and prop
erly conducted, while violin soloist Ray
mond Kobler was very skilled with Rosza's
piece. Nonetheless, Beethoven's symphony
stole the show and led to four standing ova
tions in Davies Symphony Hall, certainly a
harbinger of excellence to come.

ductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic
(1981-1985) and principal conductor of the
