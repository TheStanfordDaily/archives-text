I'hoto by Allison Otto
or three of his first four quarters at
I Stanford, Chi-hui Yang roused
himself up at A a.m. every Iriday to
prepare for his a.m. KZSU program.
During those hours, Vang broadcasted his
"limp rock, dork pop" alone in the KZSU
studio beneath Memorial Auditorium —
alone, save for the stray high school kid
prodding him for chemistry help or an out
of-towner telling him to take his show na
tional. To motivate himself, the sophomore
convinced himself that there must have
been more folks listening in their cars.
Yang's sunrise shifts are over. I le now
plays his poppy, punky indie stuff at .1 more
reasonable Wednesday 9 a.m. slot. Ihe
move resulted from his experience on the
air and the hours he logged volunteering at
the station. Workingat KZSU has become a
major commitment for Vang, though one
that may not seem so heavv because it is
only a function of his devotion to music.
"When I got |to Stanford], there weren't
many people with interests that I shared
musically," says Yang, who is a guitarist.
"And so the radio station was the only place
011 campus that really had people interested
in the same things I was. Also, since the
campus is.so isolated, the radio station real
Iv helped me keep in contact with the out
side world of music."
Maybe that's the best way to de
scribe the mission of college
radio — it keeps one in contact
with the outside world of music, be it a DJ
or a listener. With free-form, open-minded
programming, college stations were the
first to introduce punk to the airwaves in
the mid-'7os — at MIT and Harvard,
strangely enough — and made the alterna
tive important before it became the norm.
And lor every punk show or indie-rock
shift, there's been a kraut-rock hour or a
weekly experimental noisefest.

KZSU picks up that slack for the Stan
ford community, though, in theory and
practice, it provides music for a much
greater audience than just the campus.
With its hours of unique programming, the
station offers an opportunity to hear things
that one would be hard-pressed to find any
where else, from 1 ouisiana swamp-pop to
surfv rock to the longest running hip-hop
show 011 the West Coast (DJ Kevvy Kev's
" The Drum"), KZSU's value comes from
being different. Thus, the well-respected
90.1 FM is as much a resource as it is a ser
vice, a source of both education and
thoughtful entertainment.
"We're a place where you come and learn
about all that music you knew nothing
about before," explains Chanel Wheeler,
one of KZSU's music directors. "Just like in
your physics class, you're going to learn all
about sorts of physical things your mind
hasn't expanded to before. It's the same
idea. Although, for some reason, the stu
dents always seem to treat us as a place
where you come to play your favorite hits
from commercial radio.
"We're actually just like any other learn
ing facility 011 campus. The idea is to move
forward and go beyond what you hear al
ready."
On the most basic level, Wheeler and co
music director Christine Williams decide
what goes on the air, a process which begins
by finding new sounds and getting music
from record labels and ends with process
ing the releases through K/SU's databased
library system. In between, the two listen to
50-60 albums a week, pass them 011 to staff
reviewers and survey the records yet again
to choose what music belongs in the sta
tion's healthy, 400-release A-1 ist. In the
course of a year, Wheeler estimates that 40
percent of the material KZSU receives
spends time in rotation.
The music directors point out that the
DJ ultimately decides what makes it on the
radio. Though a portion of most shows in
clude cuts from the A-1 ist rotation, the ma -
joritv of the playlist is left to the Is discre

tion. Moreover, the A-l ist is so diverse and
plentiful that it's no burden for D|s to find
something of interest 111 it.
The extensive rotation makes for much
variety. According to Williams, the albums
at the top of KZSU s weekly charts rarely get
more than 10-12 plays in a given seven-day
stretch. So, it's conceivable listeners won't
hear the same thing twice 011 KZSU.
Williams claims that the station "is mu
sically stronger than [it has) ever been
now." And the college radio community is
noticing that. The two music directors have
made strong contacts with hundreds of la
bels, from the largest corporations to some
tiny do-it-yourself start-ups. Within the
past year, the station has started reporting
to the prestigious Gavin college radio chart,
which means that KZSU has even more ex
tensive servicing from record imprints.
Even though there is little in common be
tween K/SU's obscure playlists and C iavin's
mainstream tally, the acknowledgment is
an accomplishment, since, as Williams puts
it, "Gavin actually cares about what stations
they think might be influential in their
community and have a lot of listeners."
Moreover, the general quality of the sta
tion as a whole has steadily improved. Since
her freshman year, Williams, now a senior,
says that the I )Js have become more consis
tent and more knowledgeable about the
music they play, which has also resulted in
more adventurous playlists and a greater
willingness to explore a larger scope of gen
res. There is also better interaction among
the DJs, who give each other advice and en
couragement. It seems that recent music di
rectors are partially responsible for the
trends, as they have taken an active role in
promoting an environment open to trying
out different sounds and in pointing 1 >|sin
the direction of new music.
That hasn't always been the case at
K/.Sl'. When Wheeler started
working there five years ago, the sta
tion played music similar to what was 011
commercial radio, with stuff just a tad hip

per than Live 105 along with some classic
rock and easy-listening jazz. The Depart
ment of Music wasn't so gung ho about
seeking out unheard-of sounds as it is now,
and the music directors "were just here to
have this office and to chat with everybody
when they came through," Wheeler tells.
Wheeler uses herself as an example ol
how KZSU used to be and how it has
changed.
"When I was in school here — I was in
school here for four years, then I left for
three years and came back for two more
years of school — I listened to KZSU on
and-off a little hit during [the first] four
years, but not much,' she says. "Most of it
just sounded like noise to me, cause I was
l ive 105. 1 came back and did an embar
rassingly bad show my first quarter of just
basically 'Live 105 junior' kind of

thing.
"Then 1 realized, learning iron
everybody around here, that

there was just phenomenal
amounts of music I knew noth
ing about. And learned

about it. 1 low could I
have been so stu-

piu noi u
know that
this was
here?"

A local, Tim
Roughgarden
knew KZSU was here

even before enrolling at Stanford. During
his senior year of high school, he became
bored with the l ive 105 / MTV .Buzz Bin
tare and tuned in to KXSU to give one of
"those crazy college stations" a listen. When
Roughgarden decided to come to Stanford,
he spent his pre-freshman summer hanging

out at KZSU, initially to further his own
"musical development." Along the way, he
also got his FCX] license.
Now the junior is the station's program
director, and has held a slot in the weekly
lineup from his first quarter on. He coordi
nates the music programming, sports and
news while making sure KZSU is on the air
continuously. Scheduling is another of
Roughgarden's tasks. He determines who
gets what spot based on criteria such as
volunteer work, experience and perfor
mance.
As a result of his duties, Roughgarden
helps to define KZSU's role as both a com
munity station and the Stanford station.
Not only does he select what programs are
broadcast, but also who transmits and

when. In the big picture, Roughgarden
strives to strike a balance between

the interests of the Stanford audi
ence and those of the public

lit large. Behind the scenes,
it's up to him to organize
student volunteers and nu-

merous D)s Irom otl
campus to best serve
: both of KZSU's

audiences.
"Getting on the

air at all, I want stu-

dents to have a chance,"

Roughgarden explains. "It's a cool

thing that you may only have a chance to
do at Stanford.
"But when you're competing for the
top-level spots, you're kind ol on equal
footing. It's how awesome a DJ this is, re
gardless of the background. At some point,
1 have to think, '1 low is this going to sound

to someone driving home at 5 p.m. in the
car?' I want us to sound like the kick-ass
station. At some point, it's not that rele
vant whether they're from the community
or a student."
Leonard Iniguez is a community-based
KZSU staffer who has been coming to
campus weekly for the past two-and-a-half
years to host the "Bayou Boogie Dance
Party." To Iniguez's knowledge, his show is
singular, the only one in the area specifical
ly devoted to the music from southwest
Louisiana. In fact, Iniguez's gig is so spe
cialized that the music promoter by track
lugs in 300 albums ofCajun music, zydeco
and swamp-pop from his collection of
3,000 for each broadcast.
"For me, I'm having a lot of fun," says
Iniguez, who became interested in the re
gional genres when he raced horses in
I ouisiana. "I'm able to play music that the
average person would not be exposed to,
exposing some of the students on campus
who listen to K/.SU. I'm 40 years old, so
I'm a lot older than the students here.
There's a real neat interaction."
Iniguez tells that he has developed fol
lowings both on campus and off. 1 lis expe
riences wipe away the dichotomy between
Stanford and the larger community — a
respect for music pulls together one with
the other.
With constituencies in the East
Bay and north to San Francisco
and Marin, it seems that the
Bay Area at large appreciates KZSU more
than its immediate audience does, dome
special-fee request time, there is an under
current of grumbling among some stu
dents who feel that the school station
doesn't meet their needs and musical
tastes. In effect, those disenchanted with
KZSU want to hear what they want to hear
because they pay for it and charge the sta
tion with being elitist and sell-serving.
Vet, logically, it would make little sense
for 90.1 to offer music that is amply cov
ered by the densely-populated Bay Area
airwaves. Wheeler contends that K/.SU
couldn't compete with well-funded com
mercial stations and that the station can
never be all things to all people. Williams
sees KZSU as a resource to Stanford, rather
than an organization that serves the cam
pus.
"|KZSU is] akin to the Stanford li
brary," Williams explains. "A library isn't
going to stock the latest bestseller that
everybody wants to read, and its the same
thing [with us|. But if you want to learn
something, if you need to look something
up, the library's there.
"That's at least how I see KZSU fitting in
with Stanford. That justifies the tact that
the students pay for our station. I think it's
a shame that most students think they
should only pay for the station it they're
only going to get something out ol it, that
they're going to be entertained and hear all
the music thev want to hear. We're much
more of a place to learn.
Roughgarden takes a reverse approach
to the matter, yet comes to the same con

elusions as the music directors do. In his
view, KZSU needs to serve the students,
hut he believes emulating commercial sta
tions isn't much of a service.
"I can understand the temptation of
hearing your friends playing that kind of
music," Roughgarden savs. "Actually, it's
not that hard to learn about some bands
that I ive 105 will he playing in one year
now and have your friend play those equal
ly-accessible bands on the radio. In that
sense, I don't think we're excluding any
one.
"In a sense, as a 1M at KZSU, you have
this constraint — that our general pro
gramming philosophy is not to duplicate
those major stations. Fortunately, that
tends to be about two percent of the hand
width of the musical spectrum. There's
country, there's blues, there's grind, there's
indie rock — all kinds of different music.
Given that those aren't represented on the
dial, 1 think that by playing that, we are giv
ing a service to Stanford students, to the
Bay Area. II we weren't doing that, who
would be?
Still, those willing to give KZSU a listen
can find the playlists a bit intimidating.
Roughgarden concedes it's a risk the sta
tion runs in going with the spontaneity of
its free-form format. "1 can respect people
saying, 'I turned it on and it sounded like
people banging pots and pans together,'"
he says. "If they write us off purely on that,
then that's too bad. I'here's no question
some people like experimental music, so
I'm glad we play it."
Yasmin Craig was initially turned off
by KZSU due to a sense of punk-rock
haughtiness. As a freshman, Craig ap
proached the KZSU table at an extra-cur
riculars fair and asked if the station would
he interested in having a classical pro
gram, only to be laughed at and scorned.
After refusing to listen to KZSU her first

year, the junior discovered
the station was more than
merely a punk-rock clique
and decided to prove to
herself that she could have
her own modern classical
music show on the radio.
A violinist and a music,
science and technology
major, Craig has been
spinning contemporary
classical records on k/SU
tor two quarters now,
showcasing classical mate
rial overlooked on larger
stations in addition to new
works by composers con
nected to Stanford's Cen
ter for (Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics.
Her "A Selection of Sand
wiches" show is an outlet
for her personal and acad
cniic interests.
"112 irst of all, everybody
is kind of eccentric," savs
Craig, dubbed the peppi
est person at the station.
"Thev have their own in

terests. I'm one of those eccentricities. So
actually, 1 fit in quite well. I think people
are very supportive of each other.
"1 really like the atmosphere in which
new ideas are great ideas, as opposed to
some other places [where] new ideas are
inconceivable 'cause this might stand in
the way or it's just too avant-garde or what
ever. Whereas at KZSU, it's really the
source of inspiration."
When Dave Jang visited the Stan
ford campus as a prospective
student last spring, he asked the
information desk for directions to the
KZSU office. Before deciding on what col
lege he would attend, Jang was sure he
wanted to become involved in college
radio, so he checked out the school station
and was given a tour of the studio by Yang.
With a 3-6 a.m. shift that focuses on ska
this quarter, Jang is beginning to become
involved with the station as he had
planned. So far, it's been a tough go for
Jang, not only because of the time slot, but
also because he is having difficulty finding
enough music to fill three hours of air.
Though he admits that the show is more an
"investment" than it is fun at this point,
Jang is building a "solid base" for the future
as he explores of genres of music like indie
rock, blues and jazz. "My show's evolving,
kind of fluctuating," the newcomer self
evaluates.
"I was just listening to (Yang's show]
this morning. Last quarter, I asked him,
'Hey, man, can you make me a tape? I'm
never up at six in the morning.' Now I wake
up, there's Chi-hui on the radio. It's really
cool. F.ventually, some day, someone will
wake up to me or go to bed to me or some
thing like that.
"It's not really me. It's the music."
