## DON HENLEY 
### 
Attual Miles: Henley's
Creafest Hits

I thought it would be years before I heard
a song lamer and more obnoxious than I.ive's
"White, Discussion," but I agle Don Henley
has coughed something up worse than that
song and the"I Alone" video combined.
The second line of the horrible seven
minute rock-drama "The (iarden of Allah"
complains about "a lousy year for rock and
roll," with 1 lenlev apparently oblivious to the
fact that he's more to blame than anyone. The
track runs its tired and recycled riffs into the
ground, while 1 lenlev launches into a lengthy
spoken-word monologue featuring some of
the more annoying rock lyrics in memory:
"Y'know, I remember a time when things
were a lot more fun around here," he sings.
"When good was good, and evil was evil, be
fore things got so fuzzy. Yeah, I was once a
golden boy like you ..."
It goes on, 1 lenley assuming the character
of the Devil visiting a large Western city. It's
an ambitious though ill conceived concept
for a song, and Henley (even with his three
co-songwriters) does it terribly. The sheer
awfulness of this track damns the entire

album to a meager one-disc rating.
Aside from the unfortunate new material,
"Actual Miles" reliably delivers Henley's old
hits, though it's debatable whether that's a
good thing. "The Boys of Summer" is fine,
and "Dirty Laundry" and "All She Wants to
Do Is Dance" have their charms, but the
songs grow tiresome quickly, especially as
most run between five and six minutes. "New
York Minute" would be much better off if it
really were a minute.
Altogether, "Actual Miles" delivers a
bunch of formulaic pop songs, ranging from
respectably catchy to very dull, but you learn
to appreciate the formula when you discover
what happens when Henley breaks from it:
"The (iarden of Allah" is a very bad thing.
