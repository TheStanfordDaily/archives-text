The debut album from Virginia quartet
Sparklehorse proves that pretension can ac
tually be compelling. The uselessly cumber
some title, "Vivadixiesubmarinetransmis
sionplot," and the opening lyric, on loan
from Shakespeare, both smack of over-read
undergraduates with too much time on their

hands. While the title is pretty much unfor
givable, there's something honest about the
delivery of "A horse, a horse, my kingdom for
.1 horse," which adds emotion to misplaced
erudition. The song, "Homecoming Queen,"
is paper-thin, melody laced with acoustic
pixie dust, fragile yet somehow stirring.
I hese pleasingly luminous campfire dit
ties emerge periodically 011 the album. As in
visible as they are appealing, "Saturday" and
"Sad & Beautiful World" nestle discreetly be
tween tracks and make you forget they're
there. What's left are drug-addled thirty-sec
ond mini-tracks and the occasional hyperac
tive sing-along. "Rainmaker" proves that the
band is not so stoned they can't write a single,
and on "Tears 011 Fresh Fruit" guitars charge
from their stays like ignited Pop Rocks. So
what it these guys sound like they spun their
Pavement discs almost exclusively in college;
at least they know when to show their hands.
A successful stab at country on "I leart of
Darkness" proves that Sparklehorse's vain
glory is well earned, and "Cow" is a brilliant
slow-burn, as loaded as it is light-footed. You
have to wade through the in-jokes, the side
long allusions, even suspect sexist bravado
011 the otherwise cracking "Someday I will
Treat You Good," but it is worth the wade.
Sparklehorse is refined self-indulgence, arro
gant and attentive at once. Nicely varied, un
relentingly interesting, proving that the in
scrutable doesn't necessarily have to be off
putting.
