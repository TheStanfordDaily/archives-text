# ALICE IN CHAINS
## 
### 
The next time you bomb a midterm, don't
drown your sorrows with a couple beers. In
stead, have Alice in Chains' newest self-titled
release wash your worries away. Notorious for
their incessant battle with drue addiction,

Alice in Chains know what depression is all
about and have the elixir tor the downhearted.
Like their previous hit, "Rooster," an en
comium to Jerry Cantrell's father, the band
continues to pour forth inspirational
themes on the new album. In the soft, time
less ballad, "Heaven Beside You," the band
encourages the disgruntled to look past
their troubled lives for the "heaven beside
you."
But they've got more than the usual "I'm
good enough, I'm smart enough, and gosh
darn it, people like me" affirmation. They've
got jarring, almost unearthly melodies to
help you exorcise the monkey within you. In
"Brush Away," Layne Staley's eerie, subhu
man growl coupled with entrancing psyche
delic guitars gives a feeling of traversing a
never-ending, downward spiral. Meanwhile,
on "Head Creeps," Ministry-esque guitars
combine with Staley's heavily-distorted lead
vocals to create a work that gives Trent
Re/nor a good run for his money.
Unfortunately, not all their experimenta
tion is worthwhile. In "Shame In You," Staley
pitifully croons a shameless tear-jerker.
Meanwhile, the "Nothin' Song" would have
been more aptly titled the "Repetitive Song"
for its monotonous, unimaginative vocals,
and a disappointingone-rifflead unfairly be
lies the experience and talent of a band of
their caliber.
Alice in Chains are definitely the para
digm of metal — heavy, unremitting instru
mental and obscure, menacing vocals. liven
though some of their experimentation on
this album is exciting, Alice in Chains' new
album lacks the punch and ardor of their first
two LPs, "Facelift" and "Dirt." They're miss
ing the excitement offered by "Man in the
Box" and the soul and conviction of "Them
Bones." Despite these imperfections, this
album will still offer thrills at any post
midterm party.
