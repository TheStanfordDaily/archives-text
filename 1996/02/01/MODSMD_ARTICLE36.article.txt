## PAVEMENT Pacific Trim 
### 
Only a group as important as Pavement
could get away with putting out a handful ot
songs as pointless as these. The three songs
that make up "Pacific Trim" seem like left
overs from last year's "Wowee Zowee," yet
they lose none of the messy genius that made
that release so memorable.
I he I P begins with "Give It a 1 )av," .moth -
erin Pavement's post-"Range 1 ife" series ot
country-flavored pop songs. The song moves
along slowly, carried by pretty instrumentals
and Steve Malkmus' colorful delivery ot lines
like "Your vocal style's too preachy / All the
yokels mock your teaching." Malkmus ap
propriately mangles the chorus, preventing
the track from being as straightforward as it
would seem.
"Gangsters & Pranksters" is next, a playful
story of two gangsters getting into a light
against 22 merry pranksters. Over a pulse of
whee/y sound effects, the gangsters win, as
Malkmus points out, "Gangsters like their
knuckles bloody / Pranksters spike the
drinks of their buddies."

"Pacific Trim" concludes with the solid
"Saganaw." Aside from its loopy background
noises, the song is best noted for showing
what happens when Malkmus tries to yodel.
Thoroughly worthwhile.
