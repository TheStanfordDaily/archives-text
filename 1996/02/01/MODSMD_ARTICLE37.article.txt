# RANDY NEWMAN
## Faust 
### 
The problem of theodicy within Christian
theology is as old as the story of Job itself. The
question, quite simply, is how could an all
powerful, all-knowing god allow evil to
occur? Why do good people suffer and evil
ones prosper?
I'he debate over the answer has extended
over the millenniums, from St. Augustine to
Milton's "Paradise 1 osi" to Goethe's "Faust."
Now, Randy Newman has made his own
entry into the debate with his own version of
"Faust."
The story parallels Goethe's original but is
updated for the America of the '90s — I lenry
Faust is a "schizophrenic" college student
from Notre Dame who doesn't examine the
contract he signs with the Devil because "he
doesn't like to read on his own time."
Following the essentials of the Faust leg
end, the Devil works to corrupt Faust with
promises of power and fame. Newman brings
his well-known black humor and satirical
bend to the classic story, producing some in
teresting moments. At the end of the story,
for example, the Lord has pity on the Devil
and gives him l.as Vegas.
Aided by an all-star cast, at least from a
populist point-of-view, the work is remark
ably accessible considering its pretensions.
James laylor, Don Henley, Linda Ronstadt,
Bonnie Raitt and Flton John accompany
Newman and, in general, hold true to his vi
sion.
What seems to weigh down the work most
significantly is the blandness of the music.
Adopting theconventionsofa Broadway mu
sical, Newman's songwriting, while suffi
ciently witty, is overly glossy.
I he many genres he tries to employ are
safe, vanilla imitations of the real thing. One
track, "Bless The Children of the World," is
an absolutely pallid attempt at hard rock,

which would fail to turn the stomach of only
the most die-hard Billy Joel tan.
Indeed, the music seems made not to of
fend, which is odd considering the potential
offensive nature of some of the lyrics — such
as Newman's reference to the Hebrews as
"fools in the desert [who] invented" both
God and the Devil.
As for the problem of theodicy, Newman
is overly concerned with its apparent unfair
ness, using an example of a murderer who be
came "the richest man in Inyo county" and
was whisked up to Heaven after his death.
While Newman certainly understands the
theological problem, he adds nothing new to
the debate. No new solutions or observa
tions. lust a pointed complaint, which is cer
tainly not enough to overcome the albums
musical failings.
