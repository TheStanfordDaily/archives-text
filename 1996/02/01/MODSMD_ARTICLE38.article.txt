# CIBO MATTO
## VIVA! La Woman 
### 
The concept behind this band is classic:
I'ibo Matto — Italian tor'Tood Madness" -
make songs about food, madly exploring the
parallels between eating and loving. The
band credits their "music recipes" to various
musicians for "coughs," "howling, moaning,
sighing, thigh tapping," "banging and shak
ing," "oral titillation," "pushing buttons" and
"heavy duty shepherding," but at the heart of
the band is the duo of multi instrumentalist

Yuka Honda and vocalist Miho Hatori, who,
of course, camc up with the idea "over the
dinner table."
The food imagery is more than just a
kooky gimmick, though, as most songs do
actually manage to make sense. In "Le Pain
Perdu," Hatori rejects a lover, understand
ably, singing, "Your maple is so sweet / Hut
it's too mushy, baby." On another track, Ha
tori identifies herself with an artichoke, ask
ing "Can you peel my petals one by
one? / Your hands are like a rusty knife / Are
you gonna keep peeling me?" The lyrics are
more than just silly, as they pack an odd emo
tional punch that indicates that — contrary
to much of their press — Cibo Matto are not
a joke band.
Musically, Cibo Matto are a little less
strange. They arrange various samples over
electronic beats, forming atmospheric sound
collages that are consistently pretty, if occa
sionally unremarkable. The best moments
are the breaks in the formula: "Birthday
Cake" is a perfectly shrill screamfest, while
"Know Your ('.hicken" raps a story about un
knowingly eating a magenta chicken.
Not every song hits the spot, but "VIVA!"
should be best noted for serving up the top
three choruses ol '9(i so far: "Birthday
Cake" s "Shut up and eat / Too bad no bon
appetit / Shut up and eat / You know my love
is sweet;" "Beef Jerky" 's "Who Cares? / I
don't care / A horse's ass is better than
yours;" and"Know Your Chicken" 's ever-so
hummable "I know my chicken / You got to
know your chicken."
