## Screamers 
### 
lust as in the ads, the last
scrcam I heard was mv own

upon watching the pathetic ending to
"Screamers."
The sci-fi epic drama, set in 207N and
based on the 1952 novel "Second Variety" by
Philip K. Dick (whose novels have been the
basis lor "Bladerunner" and " Total Recall"),
begins with an interesting premise that quick
ly fizzles. I )irected by < Christian I >u( iuay, who
has helmed such forgettable genre films .is
"Scanners II and "Scanners III," "Screamers"
sets up for itself a complex plot that it ulti
mately cannot handle.
Peter Weller ("Robocop") is nonetheless
solid in his portrayal of hardened colonel
Joseph Hendricksson, the leader ol the Al
liance that has been at war with the New Kco
nomic block over the useofberynium, the so
lution to the world's energy crisis. Beryllium
has been found to emit high levels of radia
tion, poisoning the miners on the planet Sir
ius 68. Scientists and miners alike have
formed the Alliance to protest the mining of

bervnium. As a result, the NEB has declared
an all-out war on the Alliance, and it is here
where we find I lendricksson presiding over a
weak and disheartened crew whose last line ol
defense has become the Screamers, under
ground autonomous mobile swords with the
ability to slice and dice humans in a matter of
seconds. The only problem — the Screamers
have somehow evolved to kill all human life
forms, including their makers.
I lowever, the plot quickly takes some unlike
ly turns. The gaping holes cannot be ignored.
I low do the machines evolve? Why do the hu
manoid screamers wait until the others have
found out about their true identity (or non
identity) to attempt to kill them? An even weak
er element in the film, however, is the misguid
ed attempt at a romantic relationship. Weller is
awkward making the shift from serious crusad
er to sensitive protector, and the poorly scripted
lines ("(iod, you're beautiful") only adds to the
film's increasing ridiculousness.
Aside from the plot, the rest of the film is
worth a fleeting glance. The sets and back
ground that make up Sirius 6B have a realistic
industrial look that is perfectly suited to the

bleak mood of the story. Being impressed hv
these elements, however, lasts maybe 10 min
utes into the movie. Once the audience real
izes the absence of a plot, the film falls apart.
Though the moral implications of perverted
technology run rampant in the background,
the film never tackles this issue. Instead, the

ending is so absurd that it borders on the
comic, and most performances don't merit
mention. Far from being an "epic," "Scream
ers" is just another blip on the apocalyptic
and futuristic sci-fi movie continuum, des
tined ultimately for late-night cable.
