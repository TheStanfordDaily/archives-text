" Bod ol Roses" is a
sugary trip through

the occasionally nauseating world of roman
tic drama. The overlying theme throughout
is undoubtedly flowers, both figuratively and
literally. There are bunches of flowers ab
solutely everywhere. There are gardens on
rooftops in the middle of a l it y. I le sends her
flowers about seven million times. They go
on a terribly touching spree of flower delivery
.is .1 first-date activity. They speak often of
"too much perfection" in their relationship.
They save each other from solitude and other
such emotional blossomings.
The male half of the couple in question is
.1 florist played, of all people, by Christian
Slater (nobly reaching beyond his "Heathers"
and "True Romance" audiences), whose
character has been finely tuned to be the Ul
timate Sensitive Cuy. He's a former ruthless
stock broker who chucked it all to become a
master florist after the tragic death of his
wife. Not only does he spend his time picking
out his favorite flowers and tending his
rooftop paradise, but (and this is the kicker)
he occupies the rest of his time by attending
Story Hour at the local library. Writer-direc
tor Michael Coldenberg fills quite a bit of

screen time with super-cute montages of
Slater adoringly watching all the little chil
dren listening to stories. It was at this point
that I disturbed the peace by cackling loudly.

Slater's character, Lewis, decides on Lisa
— played by Mary Stuart Masterson — as the
love of his life when he spots her crying over
the untimely death of her pet fish. He sends

her the first of many bouquets and sets her on
the road to healing through plants. The love
story between Lewis and Lisa (love the"I"
sounds) follows them from their meeting
through the problems of dealing with Lisa's
troubled childhood and her fear of emotion
al closeness. Masterson is a good actress, and
her scenes are all believable. She has perfect
ed an expression of contained pain that con
veys far more than any of the maudlin lines
or say-too-much flashbacks (ioldenberg uti
lizes. Slater is sensitive and gushy and plays a
more adult character than he has before —
growing as an actor, clearly.
The flowers are completely over the top
and the metaphor of the seasons mirroring
the relationship is uninspired, but Slater and
Masterson are charming enough to cut some
of the sweetness. Masterson's portrayal of a
woman dealing with an unhappy past is also
worth watching. And while the flowers may
be cloying, there is something refreshing in a
movie about love and companionship, espe
cially with the current wave ofTarantino- Ks
/terhas-Shovvgirlian sex-and-violence flicks.
There arc no guns, no killing, and that makes
this flower-fiesta targeted just in time for
Valentine's 1 )av a roll of the box office dice -
or a marketing dream.
