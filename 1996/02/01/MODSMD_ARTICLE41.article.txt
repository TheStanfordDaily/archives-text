# II Postino

### 
Italian films rarely fail to move me, par
tially because I understand the language and
get a sense of nostalgia from watching them.
Setting all of that aside however, "II Postino
(The Postman)" still stands as one of the best
films of the year. Admittedly, it had a very
limited and relatively short-lived release last
summer. But because of Oscar hype, Mira
max decided to re-release it. So everyone in
the area should definitely go see it.
The story is uncomplicated but subtle and
moving. When Chilean poet Pablo Neruda
(Philippe Noiret) is exiled to a small fishing
village on the island of Capri in Italy for his
communist leanings and writings, the whole
community is electrified. One young Italian

man, Mario (played by MassimoTroisi), who
is bombasted by his father for not fishing like
everyone else, takes the temporary job of
postman. He finds that his only route is to de
liver Neruda's mail, hundreds of fan letters
from his mainly female readers.
When Mario falls in love for the first time
with the beautiful bar girl (Maria Grazia Cu
cinotta) at the only cafe in town, the stage is
set for Neruda's magic to help the courting
along. The relationship between the two
lovers is poignant, and Mario's initial inartic
ulateness leads him to ask Neruda for help. It
is touching to watch Neruda explain what a
metaphor is and then watch as Mario uses it
to describe his lover's smile: "Your smile
spreads across your face like a butterfly."
Michael Radford, who was nominated for a
Golden Globe for his excellent directing,
nicely intersperses Neruda's poetry with in

telligent and fitting dialogue.
Nevertheless, the friendship that develops
between the postman and Neruda really hits at
the heart of the story. Neruda not only teaches
Mario about life and poetry, but he learns from
Mario as well about simplicity and love. The
bitterest situation comes when Neruda leaves
the island and Mario continues to read about
him and hopes that Neruda will stay in touch
with him — and the audience's heart is broken
when Neruda does not reciprocate. In a touch
ing scene, Mario records the many sounds of
("apri and sends them to Neruda. The acting is
impeccable — he received a Golden Globe
nomination for his acting. The direction is
stunning and the imagery mixed with Neruda's
poetry create an absolutely fabulous film.
In a word, excellent. Forget your
midterms. Go see this. Twice.
