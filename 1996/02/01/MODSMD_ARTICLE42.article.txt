## Beautiful Girls 
### 
The snowplow

truck is a recurring image in "Beautiful
Girls", which features a '90s brat-pack en
semble cast. What this film plows is any
thing but pure and white. It shoves morality
too many times up and down our throats.
The beautiful girls are the ideals the men in
this film set against their girlfriends, to
whom they can't make a commitment.
Set in an industrial, working-class New
England town, Timothy Hutton's Willy
Connor and Matt Dillon's Tommy "the
Birdman" are attending their high school re
union. Willy, has moved to New York City,
Tommy and their other friends have stayed
in town. They're still boys on the verge of
entering the adult world.
Though most of the women are attrac
tive, it is Uma Thurman's Indira who is
"the" beautiful girl — the stranger who rolls
into town to shake up their unstable and un
happy lives. Ironically, she is the catalyst for
their lives finally falling back into place be
cause her life is so normal. She is the glam
our girl, the supermodel type who Rosie
O'Donnell rips apart as a "beauty freak" and

who Michael Rappaport calls "bottled
promise — hope dancing in stiletto heels."
The twist to this film and the most oddly

appealing part of it is the L-L-I.olita sub
plot that pairs Hutton with a precocious Na
talie Port man. Her Marti (not Martha)

strikes up a flirtatious friendship with Hut
ton, entering a tantalizing taboo subject
with more emotion and insight than the rest
of the film. Only 13 years old, she wants him
to wait for her and we want that also. And no
wonder. Port man shines in the role of in
genue, instilling a spark of hope and life to
the wandering and restless artist she calls a
"full-on Hamlet." He's Hemingway gone
Fabulous Baker Boys.
The rest of the film meanders among the
lives of Willy's friends, who are more carica
tures than characters. There is Lauren
Holly's cheating Darrien Smalls, who's still
living out the glory of high school with her
ex, Dillon, to the dismay of his long-suffer
ing anorexic girlfriend, iMira Sorvino's
Sharon. Rappaport does a nightly sopho
moric ritual of shoveling snow into the dri
veway of his cheating girlfriend, Martha
Plimpton's (an. O'Donnell and Pruitt Taylor
Vince round it out as Sharon's hairstylist
support network.
Promoted as a feel-good film, all the feel -
ing we are able to muster is longing, for a
film of more depth and poignancy rather
than the surface shoveling that passes for
plot and character development.
