## Allison Amend Can I borrow your Parker pen? No. 
### 
Clothes do not make the man, less so
his hairstyle. Backpack docs not the
woman reveal, nor accessories bring
her closer to her feminine side. The way to a
man's heart is not through his stomach, and
washing a woman's hair does not necessarily
make her fall hopelessly in love with her suit
or.
It's school supplies.
No, don't laugh. I feel about school sup
plies the way some people feel about stamps,
or how still others stuck in log-cabin delusion
obsessively mount spoons on their otherwise
perfectly stuccoed walls; I love 'em.
Don't take me to dinner; flowers will not
move me, but a nice Parker pen, with some re
placement cartridges in Vermilion, Azure and
Verdant will make my heart swim in a fount of
bliss. What is more perfect, more virginally
appealing than a field of freshly fallen snow? A
ream of white paper, bonded, perhaps, with
just a hint of ivory blended in. Shall I compare
thee to a summer's day? Would a Magic Mark
er by any name smell as sweet?
Don't let's even start on folders. I can
color-code them to my outfits, possibly even
match my eyes, brown for nasty DKs, red for
poetry, blue for Daily articles....
And perhaps the most important, if over
looked, item is the notebook. I lore, .1 decision

worthy of King Solomon rests in the balance.
To line or not to line? This choice could decide
your entire academic future. Do you really
want to be the kind of person who needs the
structure of lines to be productive? Better to
suffer the slings and arrows of the wide world
of blank paper, to have room to draw the
graphs of choice, to doodle freely in the non
existent margins. To those lions in the 7.00
who are technologically bound to their graph
paper, 1 just say "poo poo."
Where one buys his / her school supplies
can say almost as much about a person as his /
her psychiatrist's notes, or the way (s)he says
the word "harassment" (here, Freud separates
people into the two camps: the anglophilic
primal hordes who emphasize the first sylla
ble, and those hysterics who like to point out
the anal imagery in the second syllable). Do
you make a special trip each quarter to Long's
1 )rugs, I lallmark, the Museum Shop or a sta
tionery store? Or do you simple-sidle up to
the Bookstore, plop down your saddle on the
bar and say "fill 'er up?"
Where you shop oozes oodles about your
entire approach to academics. Preparation is
key, and here I'll work Freud in again. You can
trace your obsession with school supplies
back to your childhood when September
meant leaf piles, runny noses and being

dragged by your ears to do back-to-school
shopping. You could always recognize the
cool kids by their accouterments. They wrote
with pen, even in fourth grade, flaunting the
danger of impossible corrections. They could
even juggle White-Out, sniff Rubber-Cement
and some of the really bad seeds made the leap
to felt-tipped pens.
Yes, those front-row Lolitas all had Trap
per-Keepers of the fluorescent kind, complete
with graphic pictures of Scott Baio (is there
any other type?). Meanwhile, you were stuck
in the back row, miserable with your coarse,
canvas-covered three-ringer that left weird
ridges and distortions in your writing while
Scooter Predorski dipped your pigtails in the
inkwell.
Freud (third time's the charm) would link
my obsession with schools supplies to
fetishism, but I will gladly suffer for my art.
For 1 have raised it to an art form. 1 have (and
I list) one fountain pen, stolen from the cool
loot that my brother got for his bar mitzvah,
one cool magic marker I found in France that
erases fountain pen and writes over the cor
rection. (It really is magic. Not even the
sophomore MF majors in my house could ex
plain how it works, and they figured out how
to loft my bed.) One neat-o fire-engine-red
folder with tabs to act as subject dividers and

one pencil (Ticondcroga, of course, because
the letters are so much fun to anagram when
you're bored, and I couldn't possibly write in
precious library books in pen).
1 also carry around a Hello-Kitty eraser
and a Kero-Kero-Kerope flower ball-point
pen for show, although Japanese school sup
plies deserve an entire article devoted to
them; they changed the face ofschool supplies
forever. In the same way their water-color
prints influenced Western great Toulouse-
Lautrec, in the same way their food swept the
West Coast like Mrs. Cleaver in a cleaning fit,
so too, those cute little pencil holders and the
smelly-shapey erasers and funky backpacks
changed the way we write.
1 suppose 1 need to look at the larger pic
ture. What role can school supplies play in the
shaping of our nation? With which ink was
the Declaration of Independence signed? Our
Fifth Amendment? With which brand will the
International Peace Accord be inscribed? The
plans for the first supermarket on Mars?
Life as we know it did not end with the ad
vent of the printing press. It did not end with
the typewriter nor the computer. It will not
end with e-mail and the Rainforest Action
Coalition. The pen is mightier than the sword
and will endure forever and ever. Hallelujah!
I just know Freud would agree.

prints influenced Western great Toulouse-
Lautrec, in the same way their food swept the
West Coast like Mrs. Cleaver in a cleaning fit,

smelly-shapey erasers and funky backpacks

1 suppose 1 need to look at the larger pic
ture. What role can school supplies play in the
shaping of our nation? With which ink was
the Declaration of Independence signed? Our
Fifth Amendment? With which brand will the
International Peace Accord be inscribed? The
plans for the first supermarket on Mars?
Life as we know it did not end with the ad
vent of the printing press. It did not end with
the typewriter nor the computer. It will not
end with e-mail and the Rainforest Action
Coalition. The pen is mightier than the sword
and will endure forever and ever. Hallelujah!
I just know Freud would agree.
