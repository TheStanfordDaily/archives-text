# Spending reform prompts mud-slinging in ASSU Senate
## Fighting continues over bill 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Accusations flew yesterday as ASSU
senators expressed outrage over alleged
attempts to slip campaign spending re
form into an administrative bill at Tues
day night's meeting.
"I objected to Senate Chair Alane
Murdock's attempts to hide drastic and
controversial election reform within a
purely administrative text," said under
graduate senator Steve Russell, who
walked out of the meeting in protest.
The amendment in question con
tained both administrative changes to
the election bylaws and substantive
changes to campaign spending.
But the bill — which was introduced
at the meeting for discussion only, not
for passage — dealt with only the bylaws,
leaving out the spending issue. Elections
Commissioner Ryan Medders and Hear
ings Officer Solomon Lefler removed the
campaign spending portion of the bill
when they introduced it at the meeting.
The campaign finance reform would
have curbed the amount students could
spend during a campaign, lowering lim
its for independent candidates from $120
to $60 and capping groups asking for spe
cial fees from the student body at $500.

Party spending, which currently has no
restrictions, would have been capped at
$100.
Non-partisan, the Elections Commis-

sion does not usually
propose politically con
troversial legislation.
Medders said when he
and Lefler realized the
nature of the material
in the amendment, they
did not want the section
to be included. "We
didn't want to confront
the issues together,"
Medders said.

"We only want to deal with the proce
dural element of the elections," Lefler
said. "Political decisions are for the polit
ical body."
But Murdock led a campaign to in
clude the spending measure anyway,
which culminated in the walkout by Rus
sell, a member of the Students' Alliance
party, and independent undergraduate
senator Howard Loo.
Murdock said she only wanted to get
the issue taken care of before the election
season began. The senate is expected to
vote on the bill in the near future.
Other senators complained that the
controversy is just another in a series

that draw students and their leaders
away from the fundamental issue — in
this case whether campaign spending
needs to be reformed.
Murdock denied Russell's accusations
yesterday. "1 think Steve Russell pres
sured the authors of this bill for political
reasons," Murdock said. "He was hoping
the senate would not consider campaign
spending limits because it would directly
aJffect his party."
Students' Alliance and People's Plat
form — which has the majority — are
currently the only two parties in the sen
ate. Remaining senators are elected as
independents.
Murdock stepped down from the posi
tion of chair for the discussion because
she said she felt strongly and wanted to
participate in debate.
Murdock said she supported the sec
tion's inclusion in the amendment be
cause she was worried that "people
would use their power to disrupt the
issue.
"It is important that this issue be ad
dressed, preferably before this election,"
said Murdock. "If it hadn't been ad
dressed Tuesday night, it might not have
been addressed in time."

With preliminary discussions
opening on Tuesday, a final bill
could not have been voted on until
close to or after campaigning be
gins.
According to graduate senator
Doug Natelson, senators "weren't
saying their true motivations for
what they were doing."
Unlike last year, when party
politics dominated the senate's
discussions, the issue is now only
beginning to surface.
"Students' Alliance is the only
group which has campaigned

specifically as a party and so far
would fall under this new guide
line," Murdock said. "This unlim
ited source of funds specifically
hurts independent candidates who
do not have access to party funds."
ASSU Financial Manager John
Hall said he was concerned that
the issue being discussed was not
understood by all senators.
Undergraduate senator Angela
Parker confirmed his fears. "By
the end of the meeting, I had
stopped listening," Parker said. "I
hate all that procedural stuff."
Hall said the "senate needs to
stand up and carry on open and in
formed debate and not hide behind
procedural issues.
"Democracy is supposed to be

about honest disagreement," Hall
said. "A few members shouldn't
block or push issues through while
leaving the rest of the senate con
fused by obscure procedural
rules."
Undergraduate senator Armen
Panossian admitted that the Peo
ple's Platform has in recent years
caused a lot of tension, but added,
"The People's Platform isn't try
ing to ramrod something through
the senate.
"What seemed to be going on
was some senators were adamant
about keeping all the issues in the
amendment together. They
weren't taking into account the
confusion of other senators," he
said.
