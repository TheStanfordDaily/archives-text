### Jenna Land 
University President Gerhard
Casper's announcement of the 1996 fea
tured Commencement speaker earlier
this week received positive student re
sponses yesterday.
Senior Lisa Falkson said she is
pleased that Mae Jemison, the first
black woman to go into space, will speak
to graduates on June 16.
"My first reaction was to be very ex
cited about it and about graduation,"
Falkson said.
Jemison's graduation appearance
will mark her second speech at Stanford
in just five years, and she said in a Uni

sort of scary," she said. "It makes me
stop and look back at my life, and all of
the things that have happened since I
left Stanford."
Jemison was not available for an in

Since earning a dual undergraduate
degree from Stanford in 1977, Jemison
has worked as a medical doctor, chemi

NASA mission specialist. She is also a
noted public speaker.
Jemison has been inducted into the
Women's Hall of Fame, selected as one
of People Magazine's "World's 50 Most
Beautiful People" in 1993 and also
earned the Johnson Publications Black
Achievement Trailblazers Award.

According to the press release, Jemi

her address but wants to focus on the
transition period encountered after
graduation.
This period is important, she said,
"particularly at a time when the world is
in great flux and there does i it seem to
be much to anchor on to in terms of de
veloping your ideas and philosophies."
