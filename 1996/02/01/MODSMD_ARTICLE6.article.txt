# Students pleased with Jemison
## 
### Jenna Land 
University President Gerhard
Casper's announcement of the 1996 fea
tured Commencement speaker earlier
this week received positive student re
sponses yesterday.
Senior Lisa Falkson said she is
pleased that Mae Jemison, the first
black woman to go into space, will speak
to graduates on June 16.
"My first reaction was to be very ex
cited about it and about graduation,"
Falkson said.
Jemison's graduation appearance
will mark her second speech at Stanford
in just five years, and she said in a Uni
versity press release that she is very ex
cited about the opportunity.

"It's a great honor and privilege and
sort of scary," she said. "It makes me
stop and look back at my life, and all of
the things that have happened since I
left Stanford."
Jemison was not available for an in
terview yesterday.
Since earning a dual undergraduate
degree from Stanford in 1977, Jemison
has worked as a medical doctor, chemi
cal engineer, Peace Corps worker and a
NASA mission specialist. She is also a
noted public speaker.
Jemison has been inducted into the
Women's Hall of Fame, selected as one
of People Magazine's "World's 50 Most
Beautiful People" in 1993 and also
earned the Johnson Publications Black
Achievement Trailblazers Award.

According to the press release, Jemi
son is unsure about the exact topic of
her address but wants to focus on the
transition period encountered after
graduation.
This period is important, she said,
"particularly at a time when the world is
in great flux and there does i it seem to
be much to anchor on to in terms of de
veloping your ideas and philosophies."
Senior Courtney Angle said she feels
it is important for a Commencement
speaker to be able to speak to and identi
fy with everyone in attendance. Jemison
should meet this criteria, Angle said.
According to Falkson, it is easier to
relate to a speaker who is affiliated with
Stanford in some way.
"I live in Lag, and I heard she'd
lived in Lag," she said.
Senior Blake Harris said that
while it's important for a Com
mencement speaker to be affiliat-

Ed with Stanford, it shouldn't be a
necessary requirement. Current
selection guidelines require that
the speaker have some Stanford
connection.
"I think guidelines should be a
free-for-all, as long as [speakers]
have something to say that's perti
nent to the graduating class,"
Harris said. "She's done a lot with
her life, and it's cool to have a past

student come back and speak."
Falkson agreed that it's better
to have a speaker who is interest
ing and has important insights to
share rather than just a famous
person.
Angle said Jemison's speech
should fall into first category.
"It's exciting to have women
who have succeeded speak as role
models." she said.
