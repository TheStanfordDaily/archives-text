# Program to aid honors students
## Dinners encourage greater interaction, sharing of ideas 
### Richard Engel Contributing writer 
With extra classes and 100-page theses, honors
students at Stanford might not get out as much as
they should.
But Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
Ramon Saldivar is kicking off a new program de
signed to get such students out of the libraries and

laboratories.
Tonight, the first in a series of
dinners will be held at Manzanita,
Kicker, Toyon, Lagunita and Roble
dining halls. Saldivar said he plans
to schedule more throughout this
year.
While the dinners are targeted at
honors students, anyone interested
in finding out more about honors
programs is also welcome, Saldivar
said.

The dinners are part social and part academic, ex
plained Todd Davies, a lecturer in Humanities and
Sciences Programs who is coordinating t he dinners.
"We are having the dinners to get honors students
who are in close proximity to each other to meet each
other," Davies said. "Sometimes there are connec
tions that can be made with students working on re
lated projects."
Saldivar said he is enthusiastic about the pro
gram.
"This is one of the things I brought to the Dean's
Office when I came in," said Saldivar. "It was an idea
I had been working on for a year and a half."
The dinners constitute the latest effort by the Uni
versity to support students pursuing honors work.
Three years ago, Stanford inaugurated a program
called Honors College to support honors students
and guide them in their research. Each fall, before
the rest of their classmates return to the Farm, stu
dents selected by their departments to attend Honors
College finish their summer vacations honing their
research and writing skills.
"One of the things we do very well here is support
students doing honors work," said Saldivar. "But


Saldivar
what was lacking was — as good of
a job we do in setting up Honors
College — the court of scholarship
we create is soon cut off."
Saldivar explained that, at the
dinners, honors students will pre
sent their work, interact with stu

dents from other disciplines and
listen to outside speakers.
"The intent is quite simple, to
establish a forum to continue the
positive interactions of Honors
College," said Saldivar.
Unlike Honors College, howev
er, the dinners are open to everyone
and designed not only for students
who are doing honors work, but
anyone interested in seeing what
their fellow students are doing.

Saldivar said he hopes the open
dinners will attract freshmen who
might be interested in doing hon
ors work.
"I think it's a great idea," said
senior Andrea Chartock, who is
writing an honors thesis in inter
national relations. "We can learn a
lot from each other."
"It's a great way for under
grads to see what other people are
doing," she added.
