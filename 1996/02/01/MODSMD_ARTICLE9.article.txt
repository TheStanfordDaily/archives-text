Fed cuts interest rates
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the second time
in two months yesterday, hurrying to the rescue of a faltering economy. Major banks
immediately reduced their own lending rates, meaning lower borrowing costs for mil
lions of Americans.
The stock market, which had surged on Tuesday in anticipation of the Fed's credit relief,
set another record yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 5,394.94, up 13.73.
Private analysts said further rati' reductions were likely as the Federal Reserve tries
to stave off recession.
The Fed said it was cutting its target for the federal funds rate, the interest that
banks charge each other on overnight loans, from 5.5 percent to 5.25 percent. It also
reduced the rate of interest it charges on direct loans to banks, to 5 percent.
Chase Manhattan was the first major bank to announce a cut in its prime rate, and
other banks quickly followed suit. The prime rate, the benchmark for many business
and consumer loans, was cut to 8.25 percent from 8.5 percent.
Simpson questioned in civil depositions
LOS ANGELES (AP) — During closed-door deposition sessions, O.J. Simpson
denied under oath he ever beat his ex-wife, telling attorneys he was only trying to
restrain her from hurting him, sources said yesterday.
Simpson also stuck to the night-golf alibi presented by his criminal trial defense, tes
t ifying lie took two full swings wit h a club in his front yard around the time of the mur
ders, the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.
The sources portrayed last week's sessions as long, grueling and so detailed that at
one point Simpson was asked whether he had left any divots in the grass to back up his
golf alibi. Simpson said he had not, according to the sources.
The five days of questioning were conducted by attorney Daniel Petrocelli, who rep
resents t he father of murder victim Ronald (loldman. The deposition is scheduled to be
completed next month.
Simpson was acquitted in criminal court in the June 12, 1994, knife slayings outside
his ex-wife's Brentwood condominium, but attorneys for Goldman's family and the
estate of Nicole Brown Simpson have filed a wrongful death suit against him never
theless. The civil case is set to go to trial April 2.
Homeless, but wired
SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) — Neal Berry has a laptop computer, a cellular phone, a
screaming-fast modem and a slew of friends on the Internet.
About the only thing he doesn't have is a place to live and a job.
"People don't understand why 1 chose to live on the streets, hut I don't understand
why they're willing to pay $500 a month just for a place to live," he said. "All a house
is is a glorified cardboard box."
The 22-year-old thought he had it pretty good until last week, when someone aban
doned an old car near his campsite, bringing the Highway Patrol out to have a look.
What they found was Berry's tent, a mattress, some clothes and the juice that pow
ered his computer gear — several heavy-duty batteries taken from a state Transporta
tion Department worksite nearby.
He was jailed on charges of theft and possession of stolen property.
Berry, who got his first taste of the on-line world at age 17 when a friend took him
in for a while, spent his money instead on computer gear — $2,000 for a Toshiba lap
top and $500 on a modem.
His monthly bills also added up: $35 for an account with a computer bulletin board
with e-mail; $00 on his cellular phone bill; $50 for membership at a gym where he took
showers; $42 for a storage shed for clothes and other possessions he was afraid to keep
in the tent, and $12 for a mailbox.
