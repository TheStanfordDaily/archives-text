## Telecommunications reform Controversy rises over telecom bill 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Congress voted yesterday to free
the exploding television, tele
phone and home computer indus
tries to jump into each other's
fields and reshape the culture and
commerce of the 21st century.
The bill — saluted by Sen.
Larry Pressler, R-S.D., as a
telecommunications "road map"
into the new century — flew
through the House, 414-16, and
then the Senate, 91-5. President
Clinton has said he will sign it.
The reworking of the 61-year
old Communications Act would let
local and long-distance telephone
companies and cable companies
into each others' businesses,
deregulate cable rates and allow
media companies to more easily
expand their holdings. It also
would restrict smutty material on
computer networks and television.
Supporters say the measure
would boost jobs, expand con
sumer choices and potentially
lower prices for cable, telephone
and other communications ser
vices.
But opponents say that more
jobs will be lost than gained
through consolidation, that choic
es will be limited and that cable
and telephone rates are likely to
go up considerably because the
level of competition envisioned by
supporters will not emerge.
The bill covers the $700 billion
telecommunications industry,
which accounts for one-sixth of
the nation's economy.
A major roadblock to Senate
passage was cleared when Majori
ty Leader Bob Dole received

assurances from the Federal
Communications Commission
that it would not issue new digital
television licenses until Congress
decides whether broadcasters
should have to pay for them.
In the end, five senators voted
against the bill. They are John
McCain, R-Ariz., Russell Fein
gold, D-Wis., Patrick Leahy, D-
Vt., Paul Simon, D-111., and Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn.
In the House, Rep. Billy
Tauzin, R-La., said the bill "will
link us as Americans together as
never before. This is a grand cele
bration of the free market system.
It is a grand strategy to unleash
the technologies geniuses are
working on and to give them a
chance to become tomorrow's
Microsoft."
But one opponent, Rep. John
Conyers, I)-Mich., said it does
more for big business than for
consumers. Congress has decided,
he said, "that consumer protec
tion must take a back seat to
industry demand."
At one point, the debate veered
off on abortion.
Seeing a "high-tech gag rule,"
Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., joined
by Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., and
several other women lawmakers,
asserted the anti-pornography
provisions would outlaw discus
sions about abortion over the
Internet, the global computer net
work.
Rep Henry Hyde, R-111., a lead
ing abortion foe, assured mem
bers that nothing in the bill sug
gested any restrictions on discus
sions about abortion.
