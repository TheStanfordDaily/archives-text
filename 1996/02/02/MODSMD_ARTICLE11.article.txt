Simpson video
Several cable TV stations and a tabloid
newspaper that offered extensive cover
age of the O.J. Simpson trial have refused
to sell advertising to Simpson for his com
mercial video â€” a rejection his producer
calls unfair and even un-American.
The National Enquirer, which has had
Simpson on its front page more often
than not since the slayings of Nicole
Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman,
rejected an ad for Simpson's $29.95
made-for-profit, mail-order video because
it was deemed "inappropriate," said Brian
Williams, Enquirer senior editor.
In other news, sources close to the case
yesterday recounted that O.J. Simpson
called his ex-wife the night of her murder
and demanded to talk to their daughter,
according to Simpson's private deposition
testimony.
Simpson told attorneys he made the
call from his Brentwood mansion between
one and two hours before the time prose
cutors said the murders occurred, and
spoke with his daughter Sydney about
her dance recital that evening, the
sources said.
The call was never disclosed at Simp
son's criminal trial.
It was Simpson's second call to Nicole
Brown Simpson's house the day she was
murdered. Simpson had called earlier, by
cellular phone, to arrange to see the
recital.
