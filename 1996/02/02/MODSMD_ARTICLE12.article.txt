# Dole calls flat tax plan 'snake oil'
## 
### 
NASHUA, N.H. (AP) - Eager
to halt Steve Forbes' New Hamp
shire surge, Bob Dole labeled his
rival's flat tax plan "snake oil"
yesterday and enlisted the state's
popular GOP governor for a TV
ad warning Forbes would raise
middle-class taxes.
Ending a two-day New Hamp
shire swing, Dole tried to project a
picture of confidence, shrugging
off a new poll showing him trail
ing Forbes and calmly predicting
victory. "If I worried about every
poll, I'd probably have an
Excedrin headache," Dole said.
But the decision to put Gov.
Steve Merrill's prestige on the
line in the effort to blunt Forbes
reflected the volatility of the GOP
race just 18 days before New
Hampshire's leadoff presidential
primary.
"The Steve Forbes income Uix
plan increases the deficit and rais
es our taxes," Merrill says in a 30-
second spot that began airing
Thursday. Merrill says the aver
age New Hampshire household
would pay $2,000 more in federal
taxes under the Forbes plan
because it would end deductions
for mortgage interest and local
property taxes.
Dole and Merrill weren't the
only ones targeting Forbes' 17
percent flat tax.
In lowa, former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander said the
Forbes plan would raise middle
class taxes and suggested it would
hurt local education financing
because property values would
plummet and most school money
comes from property taxes.
Forbes, also in lowa, brushed
aside the criticism as sour grapes
from professional politicians

"all those who have a vested inter
est in perpetuating this mon
strous status quo."
Sending Merrill into battle
against Forbes is part of a calcu
lated Dole campaign effort to
leave sharp attacks on Forbes to
surrogates or other candidates
and have Dole offer a more upbeat
message focused on contrasts
with President Clinton.
He mostly stuck to that script
during a discussion at a Nashua
car dealership yesterday, but he
used a question about the flat tax
to take issue with Forbes' claim
that everyone gets a tax cut under
his plan.
By exempting investment
income from taxes and granting
generous exemptions to lower
income families, Dole said, a
greater tax burden inevitably
would fall on the middle class.
"There may be some snake oil
here somewhere," he said.
House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, who has a Hat-tax plan
similar to Forbes', warned Dole
against saying something that
could "haunt him for the rest of
his career."
Clinton, asked about Forbes at
an afternoon news conference,
said the publisher had been able
to use his "commanding financial
lead in advancing his positions,"
but cast doubt on his tax plan.
"I have seen no flat tax propos
al that I can support," Clinton
said.
The president's spokesman,
Mike McCurry, threw a laurel
Forbes' way by saying he "comes
closest to the president in talking
about the things that we can do to
pull this country together and have
an optimistic view of the future."
