# Clinton and Chirac work on ban of nuclear testing
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Clinton
and French President Jacques Chirac pledged
yesterday to work together for a nuclear test
ban, soothing a rift over France's recent series
of nuclear tests.
Having France for a partner, Clinton said,
"significantly increases the prospects for suc
cess."
"That is a project we can and will work on
together, and I believe we will succeed," Clin
ton said at a joint news conference after the
French leader received a tepid reception to an
address to Congress.
A large group House Democrats boycotted
Chirac's address out of anger over testing
France ended just four days before the first
U.S. visit by a French president in a dozen
years.
Clinton welcomed Chirac's assurances,
renewed in his Capitol Hill speech, that France
has ended its nuclear testing permanently.
Chirac, who also called for a test ban in his
speech, said his main messages to Clinton dur
ing an afternoon meeting were calls for reform
of the Atlantic alliance — he gave no details —
and continued aid to developing countries.
"We really must understand how absolutely
essential it is that we should not disengage our
selves from development aid," Chirac said.
Earlier, Chirac awarded France's Legion of
Honor to the families of three U.S. diplomats
killed Aug. 19, 1995, during a mission to
Bosnia. Chirac said he felt "deep emotion" in
conferring the awards on the widows of Robert
Frasure, Joseph Kruzel and Nelson Drew,

killed in a road accident.
In his address to a joint session of Congress,
Chirac promised that France is "an ally you
can count on."
Only about 30 of the House's 197
Democrats attended the speech, but it was
uncertain how many were participating in the
boycott. Blue-jacketed teen-age congressional
pages and young staff members were rushed in
at the last minute to fill some of the empty
chairs on the Democratic side. Still, many
remained empty.
Asian-American, black and Hispanic mem
bers organized the boycott to protest French
nuclear testing that ended last Saturday with
the most powerful blast of the latest series.
Applause was limited during the speech, but
Chirac received a prolonged ovation when he
made the anti-nuclear pledge and again at the
end.
Using language slightly different from his
announcement Monday in Paris of an end to
testing, Chirac told the congressmen, "France
has finished once and for all its nuclear testing,
after a final series designed to give us the
assurance that our deterrent capability is reli
able and safe."
In Paris, he stressed the achievement of a
"viable and modern defense," words he did not
use in addressing the joint session of the House
and Senate.
"Together we must promote disarmament
and combat the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction," Chirac said in an English
translation piped to members.
