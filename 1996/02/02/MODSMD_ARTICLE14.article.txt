## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Editor's farewell 
### 
IN SOME SENSE, I think I
began writing this final
farewell all the way back in
May, before my term as editor in
chief had even started.
As a chance for last reflections,
the editor's farewell is a long-run
ning tradition at The Daily. I
thought by the time I got here, it
wouldn't be hard to find some
thing profound to say I knew I'd
learn a lot as editor, and for the
first few weeks, when things
didn't always run smoothly, I'd
file away every new hurdle I over
came in that part of my brain ded
icated to documenting the pro
cess. Given proper materials, I
thought, I could easily come up
with some great meaning for it
all.
But now that I'm here, on the
last day of my volume, at the end
of a long, long process, I find that
what I've learned is an extremely
simple little life lesson: You'll get
nowhere without a practical,
pragmatic attitude and an ability
to take responsibility for your
mistakes. Oddly enough, that's
exactly what my mother has been
trying to tell me my whole life.
In the last few months, I've
found that a number of people
don't see it that way. From my
vantage point, with a finger on
"the pulse of the campus," I've
noticed an attitude of entitlement
that pervades this University —
people talk too much about what
they deserve and demand it from
others without realizing that
what they insist on may be practi
cally irrational or simply impossi
ble. In our news stories, we've
covered people who get so hung
up on specifics that they, if you'll
excuse the cliche, lose the forest
for the trees and accomplish little
as a result. And I've met those
who complain about the vague
and theoretical, finding problems
but never focusing on how to fix
them.
Too many people whine with
out ever doing. Everyone tells us
how much they hate our colum
nists, but so far only three people

have applied for the honor next
volume. Sure people are busy, but
if you see something you don't
like, don't eomplain unless you
can help fix it.
I've seen it within The Daily as
well. The work of running this
organization comes as something
of a shock as it is, but the hardest
thing for me to learn was how to
deal with the amount of com
plaining I heard about office sup
plies, staff attitudes and even the
paper itself. People are quick to
point out others' mistakes, but
often seem to have a tough time
taking responsibility for their
own deficiencies.
Don't get me wrong. The peo
ple I've met here are some of the
hardest workers I know — you
have to be to spend that much
time in this office. I'm extremely
proud, more than my staff may
know, of the work we have ione
this volume. Watching them pull
together to put out a quality prod
uct has been incredibly rewarding
for me, and though the last four
months haven't always been easy,
I certainly wouldn't trade them
for anything.
Still, I wish more people could
realize that we are not infallible.
You should always strive for per
fection, but you have to be practi
cal enough to recognize that peo
ple have limitations, that things
will go wrong. Take responsibility
for your mistakes, fix them and,
more importantly, learn from
them. And then move on.
For all I've given The Daily
over the last few years, it has
given me more in terms of life
experience. But it's odd that the
biggest lesson I'll take away from
here is so basic. Pragmatism and
responsibility are words I've
heard all my life, but I've only
learned what they meant recently.
