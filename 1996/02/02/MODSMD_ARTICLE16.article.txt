## Parties are really cool 
### 
don't like parties. But they're fun, I
guess."
— Stephen Jesse Bernstein
The first hours of last Friday night found
me seated on a firm yet forgiving Universi
ty-issue couch, smoking a reassuring
cigarette and chatting with some of the
delightful people with whom I share a
house. I was content and comfortable.
Feeling, I suppose, rather bothered by
such a strange and foreign state of mind, I
decided to ruin it and return to familiar
woe.
"Gohlke, I can't believe you're really
going to a party right now," my friend said.
He pronounced the word "party" with the
same tone one might use for "Bakersfield."
"What?" someone else demanded upon
hearing the dastardly plan announced.
"Yep, I'm going to get my notepad, go to
Kappa Sig and do some reporting," 1 said.
"It sounds like you're going to have a
miserable time."
"No, it'll be fun," I said with convincing
confidence.
I was going to have a miserable time.
This conclusion was built on a firm foun
dation, namely, a p;irty held at my own
house two weeks earlier. I began the night
utterly determined to "have fun." I ended
the night with 1) a sophomore girl's vomit
on my balcony and 2) a Sigma ('hi's urine on
my car.
From my previous columns, 1) the girl
knows I prefer cigarettes to the opposite sex

and 2) the Chis know I think they're a
bunch of pretty-boy Bible-thumpers. In
both cases, then, little remains to be said.
Returning, inevitably, to last week's
party, the first thing to strike me was the
"crappy music," as one party-goer put it.
Second were the "crappy people," as I put
it.
Closer examination revealed that closer
examination was not necessary'. Inside, boys
and girls meandered about, sipping and slip
ping in bad beer and worse karma. Their
mouths said "Woo!" even as their eyes said,
"My God, what have we become?"
Most of the celebrators present spoke of
a difficult dissonance, a dichotomy of
desires. This came about because 1) they
claims! a certain antipathy toward awful
frat parties and 2) they were at an awful frat
party.
"I love parties," said Ellie, a sophomore.
"They're lame, but I still love them." She
would not elaborate further, but did offer
instead to grab my lassume the worst]. I
told her that I would prefer that she did not,
and she, obligingly, desisted.
There were several other less direct but
perhaps more insightful approaches to the
problem at hand. Student and acknowl
edged francophile Piiscaline Cure advocated
a cultural relativist approach in under
standing fraternity parties.
"It's all about the American mentality,"
Cure said. "You work hard during the week
and on the weekend you have to get out
your aggressions and get drunk.
" En France, drinking is how you grow

up."
One member of the hosting fraternity
explained his distaste for parties via histori
ography. He said parties were "better two
years ago for two reasons: 1) more beer and
2) more chicks."
Another Kappa Sig was even more pes
simistic regarding parties.
"I paid for this beer and they're drinking
it," said senior Suresh Khanna. "No one
comes here to meet people — they come
here to binge drink. There's something
wrong with people who don't care about
making friends."
Shortly after that bitter complaint, a
touching scene ensued in which a couple of
carousing comrades tried to prove Khanna
wrong.
"I love this guy," one of the jovial youths
proclaimed, indicating his friend. "But I'm
not gay."
"I'm not gay, either," added the recipient
of the affection, sophomore Matt Hamburg.
Finally, a couple of hours into the festiv
ities, I really needed a drink, and I decided
that the best thing about Friday's party was
that it wasn't at my house.
"How was the party?" someone asked
when 1 got back home.
"It was fun, I guess."

The party's not over yet. Josh Gohlke has
been promoted. Now he gets paid to spew his
wrath. Sec yon next volume on page five.
