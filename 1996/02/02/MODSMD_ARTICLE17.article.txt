Tony Small's final column was way off base

THE DAILY HAS its share of
moronic columns and columnists,
but Tony Small's Jan. 30 column,
"Asian fetish," takes the cake.
But suppose instead of bewailing the
pathetic quality of student writing in
one of the best universities in the world,
we should actually try to make an effort
to analyze the column. What is Asian,
after all? Of course, it does not mean
people originating from the Asian conti
nent.
I myself, having spent the larger part
of my life in South Asia, was told that I
have no claim to such a status. Arabs,
Iranians and Israelis from West Asia
(better known as the Middle East to the
"geographically challenged") fail to qual
ify. Or perhaps it is just a politically-cor
rect term for "Oriental," or even worse,

"Mongoloid," one of the racial "divi
sions" of humanity (the other two being
"Caucasoid" and "Negroid") that was
used to justify imperialism.
Wait now, they tell us, surely you will
agree that there are some "physical simi
larities" among "Asians," a.k.a. Chinese,
Japanese, Korean (what the European
colonizers described as "the yellow
man;" we Indians were called the
"brown man" or the "black man"). Sure,
just like bald people or short people have
certain "overarching" physical similari
ties that set them "apart as a race,"
right? Or better, ask some native Chi
nese, Japanese or Koreans whether they
all "look the same." You might find their
answers pretty surprising.
What about "cultural" similarities?
The so-called "Asian" fetish seems only

to operate among hyphenated Americans
and "others," and hardly among natives
of these lands and Americans. Therefore,
the question is clearly an American
question and not one of cultural differ
ences. I would ask these "different" peo
ple to step outside the U.S. and presto!
You will find the hyphens quickly melt
ing and the imagined cultural "differ
ences" receding back to the imagination.
As an international student, these so
called identity searches appear exactly
that — "searches," a process of "con
struction" of imagined differences based
on "cultural heritage" that is usually
unknown by those who most seem to
espouse it. I have had some experience
with international students from all over
the world: Israelis, Chinese, Koreans,
South Africans, and they have echoed

my impression of the nebulous hyphen
on culturally-different peoples.
Mr. Small is allowed to find some
imagined similarities between a random
group of people and use any argument to
justify such behavior to himself. It is
sad, however, if the student body is
forced to read it in the campus newspa
per. It testifies not only to the pathetic
nature of intellectual discourse at this
school, but also to the dismal quality of
student opinion. Asian countries have
been sending their best and brightest to
Stanford for some years now because of
the intellectual quality of the student
body. I certainly hope the Office of
Admissions does not send The Stanford
Daily to Asia.
