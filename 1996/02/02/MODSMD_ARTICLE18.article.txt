# UCAA needs a real attitude adjustment
## 
### 
A stereotype exists that the Under
graduate Chinese American Association
is a clique and not really representative
of the Chinese Americans on campus. I
never had this image of the organization
until this past week, when I unfortu
nately had the opportunity to experi
ence it firsthand.
I sent e-mail to one of the co-chairs of

UCAA, asking what they were planning
for the upcoming Chinese New Year
holiday. In the e-mail, I said I had a few
ideas and 1 was willing to help if some
thing was not already being organized.
Much to my astonishment, I received a
very curt, almost rude e-mail from the
co-chair. The overall tone of the reply
was hostile and defensive, as if I was
implying that UCAA officers do not do
their jobs. In fact, she stated that if I
had ideas for UCAA, I should run for
one of the offices next year. Is this the
onlv wav to get one's ideas introduced

into the organization?
I sent the co-chair one more message
but this time I specified my idea of hav
ing a traditional arrangement where on
the actual eve of New Year's, people
could have a place to light incense for
their ancestors as a sign of their
respect. This is the way New Year's is
celebrated in all of China and Taiwan.
Once again, the co-chair's response was
not friendly, and she went so far as to
say that she had never heard of "my
way" of celebrating! Was it really neces
sary for her to deride my suggestion?

I do not feel that UCAA represents
my interests. I am amazed that an offi
cer of the organization would be so hos
tile to a suggestion. When ideas from
those who are not in the "inner circle"
are treated rudely, it is little wonder
t hat UCAA is not perceived as a
resource available to everyone. The offi
cers of UCAA need to seriously evaluate
their attitudes and the role that the
organization should play on this cam
pus.
