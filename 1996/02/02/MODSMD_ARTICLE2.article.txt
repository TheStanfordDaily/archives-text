## Staffer fights German censoring of neo-Nazi Web site 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
A University staff member's efforts to
fight censorship of neo-Nazi propaganda
on the Internet have raised concern over
the use of Stanford's name in the strug
gle.
Rich Graves, a network specialist with
the Distributed Computing and Commu
nication Systems office, has set up a site
on the World Wide Web that carries the
files of a Canadian neo-Nazi whose work
is being censored by the German govern
ment.
The German national phone company
Deutsche Telekom blocked its customers
last week from accessing sites maintained
by Web Communications, an Internet
service provider based in Santa Cruz.
One of the 1,500 Web Communications
customers is Ernst Ziindel, who denies
the Holocaust ever happened. As a sub
scriber, Ziindel has created his own

World Wide Web sit e on which he dissem
inates neo-Nazi materials.
Graves and several other people have
created mirror sites of Zundel's in order
to protest the censorship.
With sites at a number of universities
and companies, it is virtually impossible
for Deutsche Telekom to block all objec
tionable sites. Graves said that after he
copied the material to a loland account,
Deutsche Telekom would need to have
blocked everything on the leland server
and possibly all servers at Stanford to
successfully censor the material.
"It's a clear censorship issue, and just
the fact that they can shut down a site
with something like '2,000 'innocent
users' because of one incredibly unsavory
individual is not a good precedent to set,"
Ciraves said.
A better attack against people like
Ziindel, he said, is to open debate and dis
prove the claims.
"You do not block these people," he

said. "You put them out in public so you
can laugh at them and debunk what they
say."
But Haggai Kupermintz, a graduate
student originally from Israel, worries
that Graves' strategy may backfire.
Because more people have access to
Ziindel's site now that a group of people
have copied its material and placed it on
other servers, some may get the wrong
idea, Kupermintz said. Although censor
ship is not acceptable, anyone spreading
information must be careful, he added.
Hopefully, people exploring Zundel's
site will either "puke or laugh" at the in
formation, Kupermintz said, but others
may take it seriously, thus giving Ziindel
more publicity than he deserves.
In addition, the link to Graves' site
was originally referred to as a Stanford
University site on a home page set up to
discuss the censorship. Kupermintz said
