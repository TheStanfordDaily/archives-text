## Staffer fights German censoring of neo-Nazi Web site 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
A University staff member's efforts to
fight censorship of neo-Nazi propaganda
on the Internet have raised concern over
the use of Stanford's name in the strug
gle.
Rich Graves, a network specialist with
the Distributed Computing and Commu
nication Systems office, has set up a site
on the World Wide Web that carries the
files of a Canadian neo-Nazi whose work
is being censored by the German govern
ment.
The German national phone company
Deutsche Telekom blocked its customers
last week from accessing sites maintained
by Web Communications, an Internet
service provider based in Santa Cruz.
One of the 1,500 Web Communications
customers is Ernst Ziindel, who denies
the Holocaust ever happened. As a sub
scriber, Ziindel has created his own

World Wide Web sit e on which he dissem
inates neo-Nazi materials.
Graves and several other people have
created mirror sites of Zundel's in order
to protest the censorship.
With sites at a number of universities
and companies, it is virtually impossible
for Deutsche Telekom to block all objec
tionable sites. Graves said that after he
copied the material to a loland account,
Deutsche Telekom would need to have
blocked everything on the leland server
and possibly all servers at Stanford to
successfully censor the material.
"It's a clear censorship issue, and just
the fact that they can shut down a site
with something like '2,000 'innocent
users' because of one incredibly unsavory
individual is not a good precedent to set,"
Ciraves said.
A better attack against people like
Ziindel, he said, is to open debate and dis
prove the claims.
"You do not block these people," he

said. "You put them out in public so you
can laugh at them and debunk what they
say."
But Haggai Kupermintz, a graduate
student originally from Israel, worries
that Graves' strategy may backfire.
Because more people have access to
Ziindel's site now that a group of people
have copied its material and placed it on
other servers, some may get the wrong
idea, Kupermintz said. Although censor
ship is not acceptable, anyone spreading
information must be careful, he added.
Hopefully, people exploring Zundel's
site will either "puke or laugh" at the in
formation, Kupermintz said, but others
may take it seriously, thus giving Ziindel
more publicity than he deserves.
In addition, the link to Graves' site
was originally referred to as a Stanford
University site on a home page set up to
discuss the censorship. Kupermintz said
that while Graves or anyone else
has the right to choose what goes
on a Web site, he should make it
clear that he doesn't speak for the
University.
In response to the criticism,
Graves said he has now moved his
page to a private account.
"Haggai has a very valuable
point," Graves said. "This does
not represent him, and it
shouldn't represent him. I don't
want Stanford involved."
Graves also argues that the mir
ror sites solve the potential problem
of unintentionally giving Zundel

material a wider audience. Those
fighting the censorship worry, he
said, that Zundel has been "cryinp
censorship and getting a lot of
money from reasonable people just
because Ihe is] being censored."
But Graves said most people who
have logged on to his site do not look
farther than the first page. "No one
wants to look any deeper," he said.
Stanford Hillel Rabbi Ari Cartun
said he has faith in the Stanford
community to be reasonable and
not accept Zundel's arguments.
"Stanford is so overwhelmingly
a positive and rational place that
these things by and large do not
concern me here," he said.
On the other hand, he added,
"I have not been impressed with
the average Stanford student's

grasp of history, and therefore
there's always a need to teach the
Shoah (Holocaust)."
Meanwhile, the issue of censor
ship remains.
Denying the Holocaust is ille
gal in Germany, Cartun said, and
"Germany doesn't have the rights
for free speech that we do."
Germany is still a democratic
country, however, Graves said. It
shouldn't set a precedent for cen
sorship over material on the
Internet.
"Cuba and China have been
doing it for years," Graves said. "I
don't want this happening outside
China, or even inside China. In
Germany and other democratic
countries, we at least have a
choice."
