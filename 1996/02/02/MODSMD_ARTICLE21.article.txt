## Lights, camera, action! Clash of titans set for Sunken Diamond spotlight No. 2 Cardinal baseball meets No. 1 Fullerton in first night game at Stanford 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Whenever the top two teams in the coun
try meet in any sport, the event could be
billed as a clash of titans.
This weekend, the No. 2 Stanford base
ball team (2-1) will clash with the No. 1
Titans of Cal State-Fullerton (0-0) in a
three-game series beginning tonight at 7
p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
Regardless of the outcome, tonight's
game will be a historic one, as the much
awaited stadium lights will shine on the
Cardinal in the first night game in Sunken
Diamond history. Eight towers containing
158 1,500-watt metal-hallide luminaries
will light the playing field and foul areas.
The lights were made possible by contribu
tions from former Stanford stars and cur
rent major leaguers Steve Buchelle and
Jack McDowell.
Coach Mark Marquess and the Stanford
squad are excited by (he arrival of night
baseball on the Farm.
"I'm excited about the addition of lights
to Sunken Diamond this year," Marquess
said. "We are hoping to draw more students
and fans from the surrounding areas that
have not been able to come to our games in
the past."
There could be no better opponent for
the Cardinal on this special occasion than
the defending national champion Titans.
Last year, Cal State-Fullerton won the Col
lege World Series in Omaha, Neb., without
losing a game and ended the season with a
record of 57-9.
"They're the team to beat," said Cardi
nal catcher A.J. Hinch of the Titans.
"They're coming off of a historical year and
they have a lot of returning guys. They just
seem to reload every year."
Marquess expects the Titans to be solid,
especially at the plate. The Titans return
six position players from last year's cham
pionship squad, led by 1995 Player of the
Year Mark Kotsay. Kotsay, an outfielder
and relief pitcher, batted .422 for 21 home

runs and 90 RBIs during the 1995 cam
paign. The left-hander also notched 11
saves for the Titans.
"He's a well-rounded hitter," said Stan
ford junior Jason Middlebrook. "He has an
outstanding bat and great balance, and he's
hard to fool and hard to strike out. He's a
smart hitter."
Middlebrook (1-0) will start game two of
the series tomorrow, following Kyle Peter
son (0-1), tonight's starter. Senior Mario
Iglesias (0-0) will take the mound Sunday
afternoon in the series finale.
One goal Iglesias and his fellow senior
classmates would like to accomplish is a
series victory over the Titans, something
Stanford has not managed in the past three
years.
"Over the last three years, we haven't
been able to take a series from them," said
senior left fielder Cale Carter. "(In 1993),
we won one out of three. Two years ago, we
took one out of three again, and last year,
we won one game out of four. We're looking
for some payback. We feel we have a really
good club going into this series."
Last February, Stanford traveled to
Fullerton and played three close contests
with the Titans, losing the opener 11-9,
winning game two 11-10, then dropping
game three 5-3. The two squads met again
in the College World Series, with Cal State-
Fullerton prevailing (5-5.
"We're looking to play with these guys,"
Middlebrook said. "Last year (in Fullerton),
the pitching staff allowed 24 runners
through walks and hit batsmen in three
games. We created offense for them and
gave them opportunities."
Marquess and the Cardinal view the
series as a chance to prepare for the rigor
ous Pacific 10 Southern Division schedule
as well as an opportunity to continue a
rivalry based on mutual respect.
"These games will show where we are
before league play begins," Marquess said.
