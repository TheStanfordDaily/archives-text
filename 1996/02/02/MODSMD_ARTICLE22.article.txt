# Big Game for women's hoops
## California up next for No. 5 Cardinal 
### Bobby Cuza Staff writer 
The Cardinal women's basketball team cur
rently sits atop the Pacific 10 Conference with
an unblemished record, but as they approach
the midway point in the conference season,
the fifth-ranked Stanford women (15-2 over
all, 8-0 Pac-10) must shake the shooting woes
that plagued them in wins over Washington
and Washington State last weekend when
they travel to Berkeley's Harmon Gym today
for a 7:30 p.m. game against California (5-12,
1-7).
"I think when you play Cal, you have to
throw out our record, throw out their record,
throw out who's ranked, who's not ranked —
it's like you're starting from scratch," said
Stanford head coach Amy Tucker, "because
when we go over there, it's a battle.
"They'll have us well scouted and they'll
probably do some different things on defense
in terms of maybe some junk defense [and] a
lot of zone defense, so we don't even talk about
their record at this point. They're going to give
us a good game."
Stanford played miserably at times last
weekend despite recording 13- and 16-point
wins over Washington and Washington State,
respectively. Against the Huskies on Thurs
day, junior Kate Starbird remained scoreless
for nearly 23 minutes and the Cardinal found
itself tied at 26 at the half. Fortunatelv for
