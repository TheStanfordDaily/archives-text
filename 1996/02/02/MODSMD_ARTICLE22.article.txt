# Big Game for women's hoops
## California up next for No. 5 Cardinal 
### Bobby Cuza Staff writer 
The Cardinal women's basketball team cur
rently sits atop the Pacific 10 Conference with
an unblemished record, but as they approach
the midway point in the conference season,
the fifth-ranked Stanford women (15-2 over
all, 8-0 Pac-10) must shake the shooting woes
that plagued them in wins over Washington
and Washington State last weekend when
they travel to Berkeley's Harmon Gym today
for a 7:30 p.m. game against California (5-12,
1-7).
"I think when you play Cal, you have to
throw out our record, throw out their record,
throw out who's ranked, who's not ranked —
it's like you're starting from scratch," said
Stanford head coach Amy Tucker, "because
when we go over there, it's a battle.
"They'll have us well scouted and they'll
probably do some different things on defense
in terms of maybe some junk defense [and] a
lot of zone defense, so we don't even talk about
their record at this point. They're going to give
us a good game."
Stanford played miserably at times last
weekend despite recording 13- and 16-point
wins over Washington and Washington State,
respectively. Against the Huskies on Thurs
day, junior Kate Starbird remained scoreless
for nearly 23 minutes and the Cardinal found
itself tied at 26 at the half. Fortunatelv for

Jamila Wideman came alive in the
second half, amassing 18 points
and almost single-handodlv
sparking an 11-0 run that allowed
Stanford to pull away 67-54.
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, however, it wasn't just Star
bird who was cold in Saturday's
game versus WSU — it was the
entire team. The Stanford women
shot a season-low 30.6 percent
from the field, including a horren
dous 1-for-18 from three-point
range, and led by just one at the
half. This time, however, the Car
dinal relied on defense, rebound
ing and near-perfect free-throw
shooting to pull out a 66-50 victo
ry.
"I think it's a combination of
not shooting well, not really tak
ing good shots and not executing

our offense," said Tucker of her
team's shooting problems. "I
think we have some people who
are rushing their offense. They
will improve their percentage if
they work together a little bit bet
ter, set better screens as a team
and just use more of the 30-sec
ond clock."
Nonetheless, the Cardinal cer
tainly doesn't have much to com
plain about as it approaches the
midway point in the conference
season. Stanford has won nine
consecutive games overall and 17
straight in the Pac-10 heading
into tonight's contest.
"Obviously, we're pleased at
this point to be 8-0, and after
[tonight's] game — at the midway
point — to be in the No. 1 position
in the conference," Tucker said,
"but there's a lot of basketball
left.
"We're where we want to be,
but we're in the position of being
hunted, where everyone's kind of
gearing towards us now, and we

need to step up our level of play a
notch. People need to come ready
every night."
Tonight, the women will face a
Cal team that has won only one
game in conference play. Only the
lowly Arizona State Sun Devils
(0-7) lurk behind the Golden
Bears in the conference stand
ings.
As Tucker mentioned, howev
er, records and standings won't
preoccupy the Cardinal's mind
when it takes the court tonight.
Anything can happen on the road,
especially if Stanford continues to
shoot the ball the way it did last
weekend.
"We have to figure out our lit
tle shooting problem [andl work
on our execution of our offense, or
else it will catch up with you on
the road," Tucker said. "We're
very happy to be where we're at,
but we just know that we have to
make changes before it catches up
with us. We definitely can plav
better."
