# Undefeated women's tennis set to host San Diego, San Diego St.
## 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
Tennis is on the menu for this
weekend's activities as the Stan
ford women's tennis team hosts
San Diego's best. The Cardinal, 3-
0 in dual match competition, will
face San Diego State (1-2) tomor
row afternoon and then battle the
University of San Diego (2-1)
Sunday at 1:30 p.m.
Stanford is coming off two con
vincing victories last weekend
over Washington and Hawaii.
Sophomore Julie Scott will look to
extend her win streak, as will the
doubles pair of senior Amy
Chiminello and junior Emily Burt.
Both Scott and the doubles team
of Chiminello and Burt captured
their flights at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Indoor Championships
Jan. 19-21 and carried their suc
cess into last week's matches.
The upcoming weekend will
mark the return of senior Kim
Shasby. Shasby, who expects to

return to the Cardinal lineup
tomorrow, missed almost two
weeks due to a pulled leg muscle
she suffered at the Pac-10
Indoors. Head coach Frank Bren
nan is very optimistic about Shas
by's return.
"Shasby's going to be back in
there," Brennan said. "She played
hard yesterday and looked good."
Brennan also noted that Shasby
will only compete in singles com
petition, as he does not want
Shasby to play four matches in
two days.
While Stanford features veter
ans such as Shasby, San Diego
State head coach Peter Mattera
brings youth to the courts. His
team features two freshmen and
four sophomores, with only two
juniors and one senior adding
experience to his lineup.
Senior Christy Popstra will
likely take the No. 1 singles spot
for SDSU, and she will be accom
panied by sophomore Merete Lin
dahl and junior Emma Doyle at

the No. 2 and No. 3 positions. The
Aztecs have suffered disappoint
ing losses at the hands of Pepper
dine and Fresno State, but won
convincingly over Texas-El Paso.
The University of San Diego,
which garnered a No. 24 presea
son ranking, will take on Califor
nia tomorrow before it faces the
Cardinal on Sunday. The Toreros
won a close match over 28th
ranked Miami and defeated Long
Beach State before losing to Pep
perdine.
The big hitters for San Diego
include senior Christine Smith
and junior Yvonne Doyle. Smith
and Doyle will compete as the No.
1 and No. 2 singles players and
pair up at the No. 1 doubles spot
for USD. As a doubles team last
year, they reached the quarterfi
nals of the NCAA Tournament
and finished the year ranked 14 th
in the nation. They are currently
2-0 in doubles play and will face
Stanford sophomore Ania
Bleszynski and junior Katie
Schlukebir in Sunday's match.

Although two San Diego players
will sit out with knee iryuries, the
Toreros do have a highly-touted
freshman in Michelle Smith.
Michelle is the younger sister of
Christine and was a three-time
Canadian champion in high school.
The competition should prove

formidable this weekend, and
Brennan is uncertain how the
opposition will match up against
his team. "With them not being in
our conference, we haven't seen
them yet," he said. "They're a lit
tle better than anybody we've
played so far."
