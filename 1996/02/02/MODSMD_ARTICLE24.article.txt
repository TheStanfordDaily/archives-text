# Men's basketball ready for showdown versus Seton Hall
## Knight to face hometown school in Bay Area Classic 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Apparently, showing off to
7,381 fans in Maples Pavilion
Wednesday night wasn't enough
for the Stanford men's basketball
team. Now, the Cardinal wants to
go national.
Playing in the second game of
the made-for-television Bay Area
Classic Sunday, the Cardinal (12-
5, 6-3 Pacific 10 Conference) will
tackle the Seton Hall Pirates (10-
8, 6-5 Big East) at 12:45 p.m. in
the San Jose Arena. The shell
shocked Golden Bears of Califor
nia (11-6, 6-3) will take on
DePaul (7-11, 0-7 Conference
USA) in the first game, set for a
10:30 a.m. tip-off. ABC will tele
vise both games to a national
audience.
"Over the years, we've had
several inquiries trying to do
something," said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "But we
never could get it tied down. We
were trying to get a made-for-TV
game, kind of a neutral double
header-type deal.
"We had this game with Seton
Hall, and through some conver
sations with some people, we
finally found a group that could
deliver for us. So we signed this

contract to play this double-head
er during the Cal week."
Produced by the national
sports marketing firm DelWilber
4 Associates, the Hay Area Classic
hopes to become an annual event.
Stanford currently has a three
year contract, with next year's
games taking place at the Oakland
Coliseum before returning to the
San Jose Arena.
"It's just a good deal for us —
four visible schools and national
television," Montgomery said.
While the Bay Area Classic and
the subsequent national exposure
will benefit Stanford's program,
the trend of made-for-TV games
and the motivations behind these

Match-ups may not be so positive,
according to Montgomery.
"TV and money," he said. "You
look around and the games are
being played in front of 22,000,
19,000, 35,000 at Syracuse —
ABC is doing it, CBS is doing it,
ESPN is a player, Liberty has a
network . . . Fox is going into
sports and they want games.
"I have some real reservations
about it. Anybody who says col
lege basketball isn't big business
is just fooling themselves, because
it is. There's just too much money.
The amount of money it takes to
run programs is prohibitive, and
this is one of the ways they are
doing it. You have a $1.7 billion
NCAA package. I have some
mixed emotions, but if we can go
down and play in front of 13,000
in San Jose, I think it's fun for the
kids [and] a good experience."

As for the match-up with
Seton Hall, Montgomery is con
cerned with the physical play of
the Pirates. Led by swingman
Adrian Griffin and point guard
Danny Hurley, the Pirates have
already upset former-No. 7 Vil
lanova in the competitive Big
East Conference.
"They are a typical Big East
team in that they are physical, big
and strong," Montgomery said.
"They are not looking to run the
break that much, but they can
because Hurley is very good at
directing traffic. They kind of just
hang in there and find some ways
to win. They don't let you get
away from them."
Griffin averages 19.2 points
and 8.6 rebounds per game while
shooting 50 percent from the
floor. Against Ail-American Wild
cat Kerry Kittles and Villanova,
he scored 31 points and grabbed
10 rebounds in the Pirates' upset
victory.
Hurley, younger brother of for
mer Duke Blue Devil and current
Sacramento King Bobby Hurley,
has come back from personal
problems to become an accom
plished floor leader for head coach
George Blaney. The 6-foot-2 Hur
ley averages 16.2 points and 5.7
assists per game and will provide
another good test for Cardinal
point guard Brevin Knight.
Knight, a native of East Orange,
N.J., grew up as a Seton Hall fan.
His father Melvin played and
coached there, and his mother
Brenda still works for the universi
ty.
During Knight's freshman sea
son two years ago, Stanford lost
to the Pirates 75-69 in the cham
pionship game of (he Seton Hall
Tournament. According to Mont
gomery, Knight had a difficult
time figuring out how to act on
his first trip home.
"He didn't know whether to be
cool or how fired up to get," Mont
gomery said. "He's matured a
great deal since then. I don't think
there is any animosity — it's his
hometown. I don't think he's try
ing to prove anything. He just
grew up with Seton Hall — it's
going to be special regardless."
Tickets are still available for
the double-header, with one tick
et good for admission to both
games. Prices range from $10 for
students to $50 for court-side
"superseats." Contact the Stan

"They are a typical Big East
team in that they are physical, big
and strong," Montgomery said.
"They are not looking to run the
break that much, but they can
because Hurley is very good at
directing traffic. They kind of just
hang in there and find some ways
to win. They don't let you get
away from them."
Griffin averages 19.2 points
and 8.6 rebounds per game while
shooting 50 percent from the
floor. Against Ail-American Wild
cat Kerry Kittles and Villanova,
he scored 31 points and grabbed
10 rebounds in the Pirates' upset
victory.
Hurley, younger brother of for
mer Duke Blue Devil and current
Sacramento King Bobby Hurley,
has come back from personal
problems to become an accom
plished floor leader for head coach
George Blaney. The 6-foot-2 Hur
ley averages 16.2 points and 5.7
assists per game and will provide
another good test for Cardinal
point guard Brevin Knight.
Knight, a native of East Orange,
N.J., grew up as a Seton Hall fan.
His father Melvin played and
coached there, and his mother
Brenda still works for the universi
ty.
During Knight's freshman sea
son two years ago, Stanford lost
to the Pirates 75-69 in the cham
pionship game of (he Seton Hall
Tournament. According to Mont
gomery, Knight had a difficult
time figuring out how to act on
his first trip home.
"He didn't know whether to be
cool or how fired up to get," Mont
gomery said. "He's matured a
great deal since then. I don't think
there is any animosity — it's his
hometown. I don't think he's try
ing to prove anything. He just
grew up with Seton Hall — it's
going to be special regardless."
Tickets are still available for
