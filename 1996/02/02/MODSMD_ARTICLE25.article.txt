## Men's volleyball travels to San Diego for two league games 
### Ed Guzman Contributing writer 
Having won its Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion opener over Pacific on Tuesday night, the
fourth-ranked Stanford men's volleyball team looks
to remain unbeaten in MPSF play when it journeys
to San Diego State and UC-San Diego tonight and
Saturday, respectively.
Despite having swept all four matches against the
San Diego schools last season, the Cardinal never
theless expects competitive match-ups this weekend.
"I expect to see a more balanced team fin the
Aztecs]," said Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves.
"The word [on UC-San Diegol is that they're better
than last year. They return five of their six starters."
For the Aztecs, tonight's contest will be their first
non-tournament match of the season. Their only
prior match experience of the 1995-1996 campaign
came at the UC-Irvine Invitational, in which they
knocked off Loyola Marymount but then dropped
matches against Pepperdine and UC-Irvine.
The Aztecs look to bounce back from last season's
6-15 campaign despite losing their best player, John

Hyden. Hyden, who led the team with 506 kills last
year, has moved on to the U.S. National Team after
graduation. However, SDSU still boasts some power
up front with 6-foot-7 outside hitter Nick Pabarcus
and 6-7 middle blocker Lars Winter. Pabarcus, a
junior, finished with 194 kills and 138 digs while
Winter, a senior, registered 252 kills of his own.
Sophomore setter Dustin Cremascoll also returns
after averaging nearly 16 assists per game as a fresh
man starter.
"Last year, we keyed on John Hyden," Nieves
said. "This year, we have to play it straight since
we're facing a more balanced rotation."
The Tritons of UC-San Diego return most of their
starting lineup from last year's 2-21 team, which
mustered only a 1-18 conference record. But the one
starter not returning is middle blocker Tyson Kerr,
UCSD's top player last season. The Asics / Volleyball
Small College All-American posted 360 kills to go
along with 128 digs.
Thus far this season, the Tritons have dropped
three-game decisions io USC and Cal State-
