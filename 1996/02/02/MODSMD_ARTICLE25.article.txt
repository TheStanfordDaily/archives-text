# Spikers head south for weekend
## Men's volleyball travels to San Diego for two league games 
### Ed Guzman Contributing writer 
Having won its Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion opener over Pacific on Tuesday night, the
fourth-ranked Stanford men's volleyball team looks
to remain unbeaten in MPSF play when it journeys
to San Diego State and UC-San Diego tonight and
Saturday, respectively.
Despite having swept all four matches against the
San Diego schools last season, the Cardinal never
theless expects competitive match-ups this weekend.
"I expect to see a more balanced team fin the
Aztecs]," said Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves.
"The word [on UC-San Diegol is that they're better
than last year. They return five of their six starters."
For the Aztecs, tonight's contest will be their first
non-tournament match of the season. Their only
prior match experience of the 1995-1996 campaign
came at the UC-Irvine Invitational, in which they
knocked off Loyola Marymount but then dropped
matches against Pepperdine and UC-Irvine.
The Aztecs look to bounce back from last season's
6-15 campaign despite losing their best player, John

Hyden. Hyden, who led the team with 506 kills last
year, has moved on to the U.S. National Team after
graduation. However, SDSU still boasts some power
up front with 6-foot-7 outside hitter Nick Pabarcus
and 6-7 middle blocker Lars Winter. Pabarcus, a
junior, finished with 194 kills and 138 digs while
Winter, a senior, registered 252 kills of his own.
Sophomore setter Dustin Cremascoll also returns
after averaging nearly 16 assists per game as a fresh
man starter.
"Last year, we keyed on John Hyden," Nieves
said. "This year, we have to play it straight since
we're facing a more balanced rotation."
The Tritons of UC-San Diego return most of their
starting lineup from last year's 2-21 team, which
mustered only a 1-18 conference record. But the one
starter not returning is middle blocker Tyson Kerr,
UCSD's top player last season. The Asics / Volleyball
Small College All-American posted 360 kills to go
along with 128 digs.
Thus far this season, the Tritons have dropped
three-game decisions io USC and Cal State-
Northridge. They also lost a five
game heartbreaker to Princeton.
With the loss of Kerr, UCSD now
looks to senior veteran Tom
Black, a 6-4 opposite hitter who
finished second on the team last
year in kdls with 337. Sophomore
setter George Young returns to
run an offense in which he aver
aged nearly 14 kills a game last
season.
"They have some experience
on the court," Nieves said. "Being
set up by a frosh last season
makes a world of difference this
year in terms of experience."
The Cardinal spikers will use
their three-blocker alignment, led
by juniors Brian Moore and Mike
Hoefer. Setter Stewart ('hong will
continue to guide the offense
while outside hitter Tad Hoffman
looks to ride the momentum of
his success against Pacific.
On the injury front, outside hit
ter Matt Fuerbringer continues to
make progress on his shoulder. 1 le
has hit more effectively lately and
took advantage of the day off on
Wednesday to allow his shoulder
to recover from the UOP match.
"Now the challenge is league
matches on consecutive nights,"
Nieves said. "We hope he can take
that next step. It'll be another
step up in intensity for Matt."
In terms of defending the
Aztecs and Tritons this weekend,
the Cardinal has opted for a stan
dard read-and-react defense. "If
needed, we'll make adjustments
and start to gang up on certain
hitters," Nieves said.
With the talk among the team
focused upon getting the job done
against weaker opponents, Stan
ford has a golden opportunity to
do just that this weekend and
start conference play 3-0.
"The start of our league sched

ule is gradual," Nieves said. "We
have as good a chance as anyone
to get off to a 3-0 start, so by the
time we face Long Beach and USC

I next weekend |, we'll be ready. A
couple of victories against them
and we're up there with [the very
best!."
