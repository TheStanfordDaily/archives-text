"Andrew, what are you . . . what are you
doing? I asked pleadingly as Jason Priestley s
image laded from the screen. "Let's . . . let's
go. okav?

My friend was blank and unresponsive.
"Lrt 's (}()'." I yelped His companion whirled
'round on me.
"We're waiting for 'Scenes'!! she screeched
in chorus with the dead souls of a million Fox
viewers. Startled, my initial shock soon dis
solved to pity as I saw the remote trembling in
her gaunt hand. Her eyes were glassy. Her
cheek twitched. She was sweating venom.
With the help of his friends, our comrade
may soon pull out of it. but his associate was
severely afflicted. Sick. Pallid. Thin. I won
dered later if her malnourishment was just
that, or if it was really a purposeful attempt to
emulate the media-deemed "perfect" forms
that now scarred her self-concept.
(Semi-relevant sidenote: A friend mentioned
to me that she'd read the average supermodel

I'nited Nations standard for semi-starvation is
2") percent below. "In other words," she contin

How can I talk like this? What gives me the
right, you ask. to use this precious stockpile of
New Centur\ Schoolhook 9.5-point to spout my
views as if from some bully pulpit (Yes! I used
the phrase "bully pulpit in context!)? Why?
Why? 'Cause I've turn there, pal! And I'll he

remote and the propensity for peer pressure is
gonna send me back!
See. 1 know there's no cure for television
addiction. The best you can do is push it into
remission and hope it stays there. Anyone
who's ever learned to ride a hike or walked in
on their father and his ./cm and the Holograms
coloring books will know what I mean when I
say this: It stays with you, always.
F'rinstance, I went home for break and swift-
Is succumbed to that 24-hour-cable-ready-130-
channel-capacity-in-stereo-( where-available)-

neuron-depleting lx>x that is suburbia's substi
tute for meaningful existence. Imagine: I m
home, it's late and my left brain says to my right
brain ('course in Hebrew it's right to left),
"maybe before bod. I'll just watch a little TV," the
way one might say, "okay, maybe just one drink."
Yes, more than once I'm sad to say, the fol
lowing mid-afternoon scene would play out
with my friends and me:
"Hey man, you look exhausted.'
"Yeah, well, 1 didn't get to bed 'til three or
four..."
"But you went home at, like, midnight
what were you doing?"
"Nothing*." I'd shriek, loud enough so they
could hear me over my pained breathing and
irregular heartbeat. "Uh, uh, watching TV
maybe that OKAY with you?!?"
"Yeah yeah yeah — it's cool, it's cool!"
My friends at home wanted to help but they
didn't know how. They saw the signs and th«v
wanted to see me through, but damn my pre
tentious soul, I wouldn't let them in.
But 1 am getting better. For nlmost two
years, I was significantly addicted to "Melrose."
For several weeks now, I've watched only the
aforementioned "Scenes" segment (by far the
most difficult fragment for those stricken to
forego) and found that I'm keeping up quite
nicely. If all goes well. I'll be all but weaned by
the season finale. Not to worry. I'll get bv.
With a little help from my friends.
