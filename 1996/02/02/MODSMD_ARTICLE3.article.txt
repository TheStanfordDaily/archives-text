Don Gibbons, director of the
communications office at the
Medical Center, will be leaving
his post Feb. 15 for a position at
Harvard.
Gibbons, who was named di
rector in September 1993, said
he decided to accept a position
as director of public affairs at
Harvard, largely for family rea
sons.
"It was really a complex deci
sion; it's a great opportunity,
and my partner and I have elder
ly parents back East. We hadn't
planned to move for a while, but
we're going to go ahead and relo
cate."
Gibbons' new position in
volves internal and external
public relations, including deal
ing with the outside media.
"It's a similar position to the
one which I held here," he said.
According to Laurel Joyce,
managing editor of Stanford
Medicine magazine, a national
search is being conducted for a
new director.
Until one is chosen, Laurie
Vaughan, currently the associ
ate director, will be acting direc
tor.
"Don has really been great for
the Medical Center, and we're
really going to miss him,"
Vauuhan said.

The atmosphere at the de
partment has been somewhat
chaotic, Joyce said, since Vaugh
an is currently out on maternity
leave for her first child.
Joyce will be filling in as act
ing director until Vaughan re
turns to the job full time on
March 1.
"The Medical Center has gone
through some changes which
made it a really challenging
job," Joyce said, "but there have
been lots of laughs, too."
During Gibbons' time as di
rector, the Medical Center has
suffered budget cuts and the re
organization of its health ser
vices programs, among other
events.
The communications office is
charged with explaining the pos
sible effects of these changes
both within the medical center
and to the Palo Alto community
at large.
Vaughan agrees that the task
of starting over with a new di
rector will be difficult, but she is
optimistic.
"It's going to be challenging,
but we're all very excited," she
said.
Speaking of his time as direc
tor, Gibbons was enthusiastic
about the people and research
that he has encountered at the
Medical Center.
"Stanford has a wonderful
and fascinating intellectual
community," he said.
