## 
### Jesse Oxfeld Staff writer 
Casa Zapata's annual Zoot
Suit Week — a series of events
celebrating Chicano history and
culture — kicks off Sunday with
a screening of the movie "Zoot
Suit" in the Zapata lounge.
The week will include various
lectures and performances, and
will culminate with a dance fea
turing the popular Dr. Loco's
Rockin' Jalapeno Band in the
Zapata Dining Hall.
"In terms of fun, the highlight
of the week is going to be the
dance," said Lora Romero, Zapa
ta resident fellow. The party will
also include a swing contest and
costume contest, Romero said.
The dance is just one event in
a week designed to highlight
HMOs Chicano protests. "Zoot
Suit Week celebrates an era in
history which is very significant
for Chicanos," said sophomore

Cecilia Balli, a Zapata theme
associate and organizer of the
event.
"It's a way of commemorating
the culture and history of urban
Chicanos who lived in Los Ange
les in the 1940s and who experi
enced the Zoot Suit Riots,"
Romero said.
The riots were an expression
of ethnic tensions — much like
the recent events in Crown
Heights or South Central Los
Angeles — which began when
Latinos wearing zoot suits were
physically attacked, she said.
A zoot suit is a baggy style of
men's suit popular among people
of Mexican descent in Los Ange
les in the 19405. "It's oversized,
it's kind of exaggerated," said
senior Hilda Bravo, a theme
associate in Zapata.
Balli said the events were
designed to appeal to both stu
dents and faculty, as well as to
the many people from other area

colleges and universities who tra
ditionally attend the events of
Zoot Suit Week, now in its ninth
year.
The festivities will also
include a staged reading of the
play "Zoot Suit" by Luis Valdez,
to be performed by students, fac
ulty and staff at 7 p.m. on
Wednesday in the Zapata Dining
Hall.
The reading will be directed by
Alma Martinez, an actress who
appeared in the movie version of
"Zoot Suit" and is currently a
student in the Drama Depart
ment.
The Sunday movie screening
will be held at 7 p.m. in the Zap
ata Lounge. On Monday, History
Prof. A 1 Camarillo will speak
about the history of the zoot suit
at 5:30 p.m., also in Zapata's
lounge.
The dance will begin at 10
p.m. on Saturday and will be held
in the Zapata Dining Hall.
