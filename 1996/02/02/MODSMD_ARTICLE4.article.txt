## Judicial process tangled, some say 
### Frank Guinan Editorial staff 
Recent statements by top
ranking University officials call
ing for a comprehensive review of
Stanford's judicial charter have
brought much-needed attention
to an often obscure and cumber
some policy, according to faculty
and administrators close to the
issue.
"It just seems so unnecessarily
complex," Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole said of the charter.
' That's what I've seen from work
ing within the charter for the past
14 years."
The charter, drafted in 19(58, de
scribes in detail the University's ju

stance, violations of the Honor
Code or t he Fundamental Standard
— as well as the extent of jurisdic

over student conduct cases.
Both University President Ger
hard Casper and Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
have stated in recent months their
intention to make review of the
charter a priority this year.

Currently, the
charter divides
the responsibility
of handling disci
plinary cases into
too many places,
Cole said. The
dean of students,
the hearing offi
cers, the Student
Council Legisla-

tive Council, the Stanford Judicial
Council and the Committee of 15 all
participate in the judicial process.
Cole said a better system might
make "one or two bodies responsi
ble for everything."
According to the charter, once a
student is notified of a complaint,
he or she is brought before the
dean of students. If the student
contests the complaint, he or she
is then brought before the hearing
office for the fact-finding phase of
the process.
Hearing officers, according to
the charter, are appointed by the
president and consist of "attor
neys who are not members of the
Academic Council, the staff or the
