# Calls to review charter lauded
## Judicial process tangled, some say 
### Frank Guinan Editorial staff 
Recent statements by top
ranking University officials call
ing for a comprehensive review of
Stanford's judicial charter have
brought much-needed attention
to an often obscure and cumber
some policy, according to faculty
and administrators close to the
issue.
"It just seems so unnecessarily
complex," Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole said of the charter.
' That's what I've seen from work
ing within the charter for the past
14 years."
The charter, drafted in 19(58, de
scribes in detail the University's ju
dicial process — applied to, for in
stance, violations of the Honor
Code or t he Fundamental Standard
— as well as the extent of jurisdic
t ion certain people and groups have
over student conduct cases.
Both University President Ger
hard Casper and Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
have stated in recent months their
intention to make review of the
charter a priority this year.

Currently, the
charter divides
the responsibility
of handling disci
plinary cases into
too many places,
Cole said. The
dean of students,
the hearing offi
cers, the Student
Council Legisla-

tive Council, the Stanford Judicial
Council and the Committee of 15 all
participate in the judicial process.
Cole said a better system might
make "one or two bodies responsi
ble for everything."
According to the charter, once a
student is notified of a complaint,
he or she is brought before the
dean of students. If the student
contests the complaint, he or she
is then brought before the hearing
office for the fact-finding phase of
the process.
Hearing officers, according to
the charter, are appointed by the
president and consist of "attor
neys who are not members of the
Academic Council, the staff or the


Edmonds
student body." It is at this point
also that the student can opt for
legal counsel.
If the student is found guilty,
he or she is brought before the
Judicial Council, which hears the
case and recommends a penalty to
either Edmonds or Provost Con
doleezza Rice, who then must
approve the final action.
"One of the problems that we've
discovered is that by the time a
case gets to the Judicial Council,
the person who's up for review has
already been found guilty or not
guilty," said English Prof. Gilbert
Sorrentino, a member of the Stan
ford Judicial Council."The way it
is now, there's no way at that point
for that person to defend himself."
From his experience, Sorrenti
no added that he found the pro
cess somewhat cumbersome.
"We're stuck with the findings
of somebody else," he said. "We
think it would be better if the
whole process were combined. At
least, that was the opinion of this
year's council."
History of the charter
The Legislative and Judicial
Charter resulted from a Universi
ty referendum endorsed by facul
ty and voted on by the whole stu
dent body in 1968. The referen
dum, in turn, was the product of

student activism and protest
which was typical of the decade.
"The charter is an example of
the atmosphere of the time," Cole
said. "It was an era of very little
trust and high animosity. You can
see that reflected in some charac
teristics of the charter."
Before the charter, separate
men's and women's student coun
cils were set up by the ASSU to
deal with honor code violations
and other disciplinary cases.
Although adopted in 1968, the
charter was amended a year later.
The last time the charter was
amended was in 1981.
Originally many parties are cur
rently involved in the judicial pro
cess, only the Committee of 15 has
the power to review or change the
charter. This committee consists
of six members of the Academic
Council, three staff members
appointed by the president and six
student members appointed by the
ASSU Nominations Commission.
Although the group is not a
standing committee, Casper
announced his intention at last
week's ASSU meeting to convene
the Committee of 15 sometime
this quarter.
The last time the committee
was called together was in 1991,
stemming from recommendations
made by the Committee on Sexual
Assault. Proposals from this com
mittee included reducing the bur
den of proof of assault from
"beyond a reasonable doubt" to
"clear and convincing evidence."

Need for reform
During his visit to the ASSU,
Casper said a review of the char
ter was necessary because the
judicial process in its current form
is "highly bureaucratic and proce
durally cumbersome."
"[Casper'sl comments have
certainly been reflected in what
I've seen," said Gail Mosse, a sec
ond-year law student who is act
ing as co-chair of this year's judi
cial council."For the student
involved, it's a very time-consum
ing, even alienating process."
In addition, a large majority of
students who end up getting tan
gled up in the judicial process do
not contest the charges brought
against them. Rather, they have
the dean of students deal entirely
with their case.
"There is an alternate route
[specified in the charter] which
over 90 percent of people take,"
Cole said. The charter "would be a
more helpful document if it
addressed more on what actual
process will likely be used."
While many factors can be
involved in determining the
length of a case, Cole said the
average time frame was about six
to eight weeks. "If it takes longer,
there is usually something unusu
al in the case," she added.
"I think there's frustration at
all three points — with the admin
istration, the student and the
judicial council — with the cur
rent process," Mosse said.

From his experience, Sorrenti
no added that he found the pro
cess somewhat cumbersome.
"We're stuck with the findings
of somebody else," he said. "We
think it would be better if the
whole process were combined. At
least, that was the opinion of this
year's council."
History of the charter
The Legislative and Judicial
Charter resulted from a Universi
ty referendum endorsed by facul
ty and voted on by the whole stu
dent body in 1968. The referen
dum, in turn, was the product of

student activism and protest
which was typical of the decade.
"The charter is an example of
the atmosphere of the time," Cole
said. "It was an era of very little
trust and high animosity. You can
see that reflected in some charac
teristics of the charter."
Before the charter, separate
men's and women's student coun
cils were set up by the ASSU to
deal with honor code violations
and other disciplinary cases.
Although adopted in 1968, the
charter was amended a year later.
The last time the charter was
amended was in 1981.
Originally many parties are cur
rently involved in the judicial pro
cess, only the Committee of 15 has
the power to review or change the
charter. This committee consists
of six members of the Academic
Council, three staff members
appointed by the president and six
student members appointed by the
ASSU Nominations Commission.
Although the group is not a
standing committee, Casper
announced his intention at last
week's ASSU meeting to convene
the Committee of 15 sometime
this quarter.
The last time the committee
was called together was in 1991,
stemming from recommendations
made by the Committee on Sexual
Assault. Proposals from this com
mittee included reducing the bur
den of proof of assault from
"beyond a reasonable doubt" to
"clear and convincing evidence."

Need for reform
During his visit to the ASSU,
Casper said a review of the char
ter was necessary because the
judicial process in its current form
is "highly bureaucratic and proce
durally cumbersome."
"[Casper'sl comments have
certainly been reflected in what
I've seen," said Gail Mosse, a sec
ond-year law student who is act
ing as co-chair of this year's judi
cial council."For the student
involved, it's a very time-consum
ing, even alienating process."
In addition, a large majority of
students who end up getting tan
gled up in the judicial process do
not contest the charges brought
against them. Rather, they have
the dean of students deal entirely
with their case.
"There is an alternate route
[specified in the charter] which
over 90 percent of people take,"
Cole said. The charter "would be a
more helpful document if it
addressed more on what actual
process will likely be used."
While many factors can be
involved in determining the
length of a case, Cole said the
average time frame was about six
to eight weeks. "If it takes longer,
there is usually something unusu
al in the case," she added.
"I think there's frustration at
all three points — with the admin
istration, the student and the
judicial council — with the cur
rent process," Mosse said.
