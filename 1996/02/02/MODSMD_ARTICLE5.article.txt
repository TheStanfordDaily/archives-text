# New telescope tracks quasars, costs $250M

Stanford scientists who want to know
more about black holes and quasars are
building a telescope to give them answers
about these mysterious celestial bodies.
The Gamma Large Array Space Tele
scope ((II AST) is being designed and built
at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
and when it is eventually launched into
space, its job will be to observe and measure
gamma rays.
(lamina rays are the most energetic
form of light in the universe, and GLAST
— a $250 million project which its builders
hope to see launched in 2005 — will give
scientists a clearer picture of the places
where gamma rays are generated.
Lynn Cominsky, a professor of physics
at Sonoma State University who has been
active iri the project at SI AC, said one of

the principal sources of gamma rays in the
universe were objects called blazars.
Blazars, Cominsky stud, are a type of
quasar, or galaxies that are so far from
Earth that t hey appear to be single points
of light. What distinguishes blazars is that
t hey give off large amounts of gamma rays.
The main way to examine blazars is by
looking at the gamma rays they emit, and
since the earth's Atmosphere absorbs most
of these rays as they come in from space,
meaningful observation has to be done
from space, said P.A. Moore, director of
public affairs at the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center.
Cominsky explained that the gamma
rays in a blazar are thought to be generat
ed by an enormous black hole at its center.
Ixjss is known, however, about how these
black holes generate t he rays.
"There's a certain mystery as
to how these black holes, or what
we think are black holes, generate
these beams of particles," said
Assoc. Physics Prof. Peter Michel
son.
Cominsky also said scientists
hoped exploring the black holes
that generate gamma rays could
provide data about "how the prin
ciples of physics apply in environ
ments of extremely high gravity
and density."
She suggested that this in turn
might help scientists to under
stand more about the state of the
universe immediately after its for
mation in the Big Bang.
GLAST is also going to exam
ine other sources of gamma rays,
Michelson said, some of them in
the Milky Way. It uses some of the
same technology as was developed
for particle accelerators such as

the one at SLAC.
GLAST itself, Cominsky said,
is made up of stacks of silicon
chips separated by lead sheets.
When a gamma ray hits the sili
con, it gives off particles that can
be tracked through the remaining
layers. This track, Cominsky said,
indicates how powerful the
gamma ray is and what direction
it came from.
Cominsky said this was much
more accurate than the process
currently used in the Gamma Ray
Observatory, which tracks the
gamma rays through a "volume of
gas." The Gamma Ray Observato
ry has been in orbit since 1991.
Michelson said the launch date
of 2005 is actually fast by the
standards of projects designed to
go into space.
"We could do it in five years, but
in order to line up all the sources of
funding, we're giving ourselves
10," Michelson explained.
These sources of funding, he
said, included NASA, the U.S.
Department of Energy, and

"important foreign collaboration
from Germany and Japan."
Michelson estimated that the
final cost, including launching
the satellite into space, will be
"something over $200 to $250
million."
He called this amount "rela
tively small for a space experi
ment," and said that the Hubble
Space Telescope had cost $5 to $6
billion.
"It sounds like a lot, and it is,"
Michelson said. "But there's real
ly no other way to do these exper
iments."
Michelson is one of the princi
pal investigators for the Gamma
Ray Observatory. He said the
idea of an orbiting telescope to
measure gamma rays was first
envisioned by a Stanford physi
cist named Robert Hofstadter,
who won a Nobel Prize in 1961
for his work on the structure of
the proton. Michelson said Hofs
tadter died months before the
Gamma Ray Observatory went
into orbit.
