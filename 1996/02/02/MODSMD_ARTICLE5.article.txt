Stanford scientists who want to know
more about black holes and quasars are
building a telescope to give them answers
about these mysterious celestial bodies.
The Gamma Large Array Space Tele
scope ((II AST) is being designed and built
at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
and when it is eventually launched into
space, its job will be to observe and measure
gamma rays.
(lamina rays are the most energetic
form of light in the universe, and GLAST
— a $250 million project which its builders
hope to see launched in 2005 — will give
scientists a clearer picture of the places
where gamma rays are generated.
Lynn Cominsky, a professor of physics
at Sonoma State University who has been
active iri the project at SI AC, said one of

the principal sources of gamma rays in the
universe were objects called blazars.
Blazars, Cominsky stud, are a type of
quasar, or galaxies that are so far from
Earth that t hey appear to be single points
of light. What distinguishes blazars is that
t hey give off large amounts of gamma rays.
The main way to examine blazars is by
looking at the gamma rays they emit, and
since the earth's Atmosphere absorbs most
of these rays as they come in from space,
meaningful observation has to be done
from space, said P.A. Moore, director of
public affairs at the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center.
Cominsky explained that the gamma
rays in a blazar are thought to be generat
ed by an enormous black hole at its center.
Ixjss is known, however, about how these
black holes generate t he rays.
