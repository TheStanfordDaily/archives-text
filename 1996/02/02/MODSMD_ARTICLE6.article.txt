## Renowned columnist Goodman finds remedy for winter blahs at Stanford 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Contributing writer 
Ellen Goodman is not afraid of
making value judgments. "It's
what I do for a living," explained
the Pulitzer Prize-winning news
paper columnist and visiting pro
fessor at Stanford.
In response to the vehement
and often condemnatory opinions
expressed by the right wing,
Goodman uses many of her
columns to share her more leftist
views. She said she wishes that
other liberals would be similarly
vocal.
"People on the left have skirt
ed away from making value judg
ments. It's ludicrous. Everyone
makes decisions about what they
value."
Unlike Goodman, however,
not everyone has the opportunity
to share their decisions, via a
weekly column, with readers of
430 newspapers.
Goodman began writing
columns more than 25 years ago,
both as a voice of the women's
movement and as the voice of an
individual woman. Since then, in
addition to receiving a Pulitzer
Prize, she has been a Nieman Eel
low at Harvard and has published
six books.
Yet when she started, Good
man said, the writing she was in

terested in had no real name or
category. In 1970, Goodman said,
two kinds of female columnists
existed: the kind, like Erma
Bombeck, who wrote about do
mestic issues, or the kind, like
Mary McGrory, who wrote about
politics out of Washington, and
who, Goodman said, "did what
they boys were doing."
In contrast, Goodman said, "I
wanted a place where you could
write about nuclear bombs on
Tuesday and worryingaboutyour
weight on Wednesday and child
care on Thursday and presiden
tial politics on the next day.
There's a connection between
people's public and private con
cerns."
Goodman's career as a journal
ist began in 1963, when she grad
uated from Radcliffe. Prior to
graduating, she had not been in
volved with journalism.
"I never worked for my college
newspaper or delivered newspa
pers as a small child," Goodman
said. She admitted, though, that
writing came naturally to her. "I
must say it was relatively easy to
do my papers in college."
After graduating, Goodman
went to New York. "They were
hiring overeducated young
women for truly lousy jobs. Now

they re hiring everybody for lousy
jobs."
Goodman's "lousy" job was at
Newsweek, where she was
employed as a research assistant.
"All of the women were
researchers, and all of the men were
reporters," she said. Because the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 had not yet
passed, "sex discrimination didn't
just happen, it was legal," (ioodman
said.
After two years, Goodman
moved to the Detroit Free Press,
where she did news desk reporting.
"They had just let women into
the city room. I was on the cusp of
that change," she said.
In 1967, G<xxlman moved to The
Boston Globe, where she has
remained ever since. Once again,
she was a pioneer in her field. "I
was one of the only mothers of a
pre-school child," she said. For
pregnant women, said Goodman,
"there was no maternity leave. The
policy was that you'd leave when
you 'showed.' "
At The Globe, Goodman worked
as a street reporter for three years
before attempting to write for the
OD-ed naL'e.

"I wrote my first columns in
1970 and 1971, just as the women's
movement took off," Goodman
said. "The issues interested me as
an observer of social change and as
a woman. The changing roles of
men and women are the most inter
esting news story of my adulthood. "
In terms of which columns have
elicited the greatest response from
her readers, the soundbite-friendly
Goodman noted, "If you wrote only
about abortion and gun control,
you'd get a lot of letters." However,
she said she most values personal
correspondence.
Goodman said she is always able
to find a subject for her columns.
"You don't run out of ideas unless
you stop paying attention," she
said. If she is unsure of what topic
to tackle, Goodman said, "I start
reading, thinking, walking around,
making calls."
Already, Goodman has used
Stanford as an inspiration for a col
umn. In a piece entitled "Mid-life
Checkup at Stanford," which ran
Jan. 11, Goodman wrote that in
leaving Boston, she and her hus
band had "flown as far as you can
without leaving the continent. Sud
denly the ocean is on the wrong
side, people call it cold when the
temperature dips to 40, and the
drivers actually stop their cars
when you step off the sidewalk."

In the same column, Goodman
explained her decision to spend the
winter teaching at Stanford.
"If we are lucky and attentive,
there may be a moment when the
imperatives of adult life lighten up,
making room for something else. At
the same moment the comfortable
patterns of mid-life can seem too
comfortable. And the most rooted
of us can wonder if we're not just a
bit potbound."
Stanford's invitation to teach
was more appealing than similar
invitations from other schools for
several reasons, said Goodman.
One reason was the location.
"It's physically so different, and
I find that very refreshing," Good
man said. "I did pick the right win
ter to get out of New England."
An additional appeal was Stan
ford's quarter system. "It's a dis
crete period of time," Goodman
said. "I couldn't have done a
semester, because the presidential
campaigns are kicking into gear."
Goodman's course, which she is
teaching in addition to several sem
inars, is titled "Telling People
What You Think" and is offered
through the Communication
Department. Sixteen students are
learning about opinion writing,
which, said Goodman, "is distinct
from shooting off your mouth. It's
orderly."
