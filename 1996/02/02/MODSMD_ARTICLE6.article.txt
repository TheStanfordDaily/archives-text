## Renowned columnist Goodman finds remedy for winter blahs at Stanford 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Contributing writer 
Ellen Goodman is not afraid of
making value judgments. "It's
what I do for a living," explained
the Pulitzer Prize-winning news
paper columnist and visiting pro
fessor at Stanford.
In response to the vehement
and often condemnatory opinions
expressed by the right wing,
Goodman uses many of her
columns to share her more leftist
views. She said she wishes that
other liberals would be similarly
vocal.
"People on the left have skirt
ed away from making value judg
ments. It's ludicrous. Everyone
makes decisions about what they
value."
Unlike Goodman, however,
not everyone has the opportunity
to share their decisions, via a
weekly column, with readers of
430 newspapers.
Goodman began writing
columns more than 25 years ago,
both as a voice of the women's
movement and as the voice of an
individual woman. Since then, in
addition to receiving a Pulitzer
Prize, she has been a Nieman Eel
low at Harvard and has published
six books.
Yet when she started, Good
man said, the writing she was in

terested in had no real name or
category. In 1970, Goodman said,
two kinds of female columnists
existed: the kind, like Erma
Bombeck, who wrote about do
mestic issues, or the kind, like
Mary McGrory, who wrote about
politics out of Washington, and
who, Goodman said, "did what
they boys were doing."
In contrast, Goodman said, "I
wanted a place where you could
write about nuclear bombs on
Tuesday and worryingaboutyour
weight on Wednesday and child
care on Thursday and presiden
tial politics on the next day.
There's a connection between
people's public and private con
cerns."
Goodman's career as a journal
ist began in 1963, when she grad
uated from Radcliffe. Prior to
graduating, she had not been in
volved with journalism.
"I never worked for my college
newspaper or delivered newspa
pers as a small child," Goodman
said. She admitted, though, that
writing came naturally to her. "I
must say it was relatively easy to
do my papers in college."
After graduating, Goodman
went to New York. "They were
hiring overeducated young
women for truly lousy jobs. Now
