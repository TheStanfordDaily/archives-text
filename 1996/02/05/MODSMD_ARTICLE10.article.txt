## President will reveal budget 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Clinton's
budget for 1997 — at least a bare bones version
— will be formally unveiled today, but the presi
dent and the country could certainly be excused
for wondering, "Why bother?"
A president's budget is often declared dead on
arrival by an opposition Congress intent on set
ting its own spending priorities, but Clinton's
new budget seems to be the ultimate exercise in
futility.
While he is presenting a budget for the 1997
fiscal year, he and the Republican Congress are
still locked in stalemated talks over the 1996
spending plan, even though the current budget
year is one-third gone.
"In a sense, the 1996 budget process is being
lapped by 1997. We have the runners for the pre
vious race still on the track and the gun is going
off for the new race," said Robert Reischauer,
former director of the Congressional Budget
Office. "This is undoubtedly going to cause a
tremendous amount of confusion."
There's a simple answer why the president is
producing a new budget: He is required by law to
submit a spending plan to Congress by the first
Monday in February that will cover the fiscal
year starting the next Oct. 1.
The administration said it will meet the min
imal requirements with a 15- to 20-page docu
ment that will sketch in broad outline what his
spending recommendations are. The actual bud
get with line-by-line details won't be ready until
March 18.
Administration officials say there won't be
any surprises. Today's budget will track the
president's last offer made in early January in
the marathon budget negotiations.
As part of a compromise to end a 21-day gov
ernment shutdown, Clinton agreed to meet the
Republican demand to produce a budget that
would be in balance by the year 2002 using eco
nomic assumptions from the Congressional Bud
get Office.
