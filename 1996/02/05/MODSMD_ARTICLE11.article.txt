# Quicker FDA approval proposed

WASHINGTON (AP) - Joseph
O'Brien was prescribed a device that
might postpone his hip replacement by
pulsing electricity into his diseased
joint. But he had to buy the treatment
in Canada because it's outlawed here.
Prompted by critics who say the
Food and Drug Administration unfairly
blocks such therapies, Congress is
about to consider legislation forcing the
FDA to speed new medicines to doctors
— and to let Americans buy more treat
ments sold abroad.
The goal, said Sen. Nancy Kasse
baum, R-Kan., is to "transform the
FDA from a growing barrier to innova
tion into an active partner in innova
tion."
The FDA, responsible for the safety
and effectiveness of some $1 trillion
worth of products, is the agency every
body loves to hate. Makers of tobacco

and vitamins and medicine call the
agency too regulatory even as consumer
advocates rail it's not strict enough.
But anti-FDA sentiment rose to new
heights last year, as House Speaker
Newt Gingrich called FDA Commis
sioner David Kessler a "thug" and con
servative think tanks accused the agen
cy of murdering Americans by not
approving medicines fast enough. Their
proposals ranged from letting private
companies do FDA's job to selling unap
proved drugs as long as they bore some
"consumer beware" tag.
Now Kassebaum says she's found a
middle ground, forcing the FDA to do
its own job faster and to help companies
cut the 12 years and $350 million they
spend developing a single new medicine.
The bill's biggest change could allow
some therapies sold abroad to be sold in
the United States before the FDA offi

cially gives them the nod.
Under this provision, companies
would petition for automatic sale
based on approval by certain foreign
countries — if the FDA hasn't reviewed
a therapy within six mohths. The FDA
then would have another 30 days to
block the sale, by declaring the treat
ment unsafe or unproven.
Doctors aren't sure whether to sup
port the legislation, noting that even
Europe doesn't require safety controls
as strict as the FDA does.
"While we all chafe occasionally at
the slowness of the process of approval,
we must remind ourselves of the ten
sion there is between safety and avail
ability," cautioned Dr. Nancy Dickey of
the American Medical Association, it is
very rare for Americans not to find a
U.S. alternative for a treatment touted
overseas, she said.
