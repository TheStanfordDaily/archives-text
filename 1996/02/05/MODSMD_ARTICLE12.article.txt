BKIJING (AP) — Medics and soldiers
rushed into scenic Lijiang in southwestern
China yesterday to help survivors of a pow
erful earthquake that killed at least 238 peo
ple and injured nearly 14,000.
Fhe floors of two local hospitals were
filled with injured people, the state-run Xin
hua news agency said. Doctors also worked
outdoors and in temporary clinics set up in
tents.
Television reports showed medics attend
ing to bloodied victims who lay on mattress
es on a floor, covered with thick quilts to pro
tect them from temperatures that hovered
near freezing.
I'oday, tens of thousands of injured and
homeless people sat huddled under quilts or
dug through the rubble of their devastated
mud and rock homes.
One young rescue worker sat on the rub
ble embracing a quake victim and weeping.
"People from all walks of life have been
quick to act to help," said Chen «Jie of the
Yunnan province government. Teams of
relief workers reached all areas that were
heavily damaged, she said.
The television report said 238 people died,
3,700 were seriously injured and more than
10,000 suffered minor injuries. A male for
eign tourist was among the severely injured,
but his name and nationality were not imme
diately known, Xinhua said. Four other for
eigners suffered minor injuries, the news
agency said.
Most of the fatalities occurred in nearby
Dayan town and in the rural areas of White
Sand and (Jold Mountain, said Chen.
The picturesque town of Lijiang, 1,300
miles southwest of Beijing, is one of Yun
nan's most popular tourist areas.
But the traditional homes that decorate
the mountainous region are vulnerable to
earthquakes because they are made of mud
bricks, with heavy roofs of rounded gray tiles

on wooden rafters.
Saturday's magnit.ude-7 quake damaged
the old quarter of Lijiang, a maze of narrow,
twisting cobblestone streets and fast-flowing
canals crossed by arched stone bridges.
About 10 percent of the town's old one
and two-story wooden buildings with pillars
and balconies were destroyed, the report
said.
Most of Lijiang's residents were evacuat
ed to temporary shelters set up in tents, and
the government was providing quilts, water
and food, Chen said.
The quake collapsed nearly 180,000 build
ings across the stricken area, cut off commu
nication and, in some areas, knocked out.
water, electricity and roads, Chen said.
Nearly 200 aftershocks, including 18 that
measured between magnitudes 4 and 4.8,
were recorded in Lijiang County by yester
day, Xinhua said. Seismologists warned that
aftershocks of up to magnitude 6 could hit in
the next few days.
The Red Cross Society of China appealed
for international humanitarian aid. It was
sending dozens of doctors and nurses and
$160,000 worth of clothes, quilts and
medicine.
Ninety cars, trucks and jeeps brought sol
diers and other rescue workers into the dis
aster area, provincial official Wang Ze said.
Xinhua said teams of relief workers began
arriving at dawn yesterday.
Some of the injured were evacuated by
airplane to hospitals in Kunming, the provin
cial capital, a 35-minute flight from Lijiang.
Lijiang County is a scenic area with snow
covered peaks, including 18,300-foot Snow
Dragon Jade Mountain. Lijiang is the center
of the Naxi people, an ethnic minority with a
population of 275,000.
Yunnan, with a major fault line running
across it, is one the most earthquake-prone
regions in China.
