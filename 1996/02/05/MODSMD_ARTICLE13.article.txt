# Serbians to try war criminals

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) â€” Serbian presi
dent Slobodan Milosevic says he is willing to try sus
pected war criminals but will not extradite them.
For Secretary of State Warren Christopher that's a
disappointing setback on a moderately successful
trip to the Balkans.
Milosevic agreed yesterday to permit investiga
tors from an international tribunal at The Hague to
open an office in Belgrade. That could accelerate the
gathering of evidence of ethnic cleansing in the four
year war in Bosnia.
For Christopher, who insists ethnic hatred can
not be erased if the guilty go free, access to massacre

sites and the building of a legal case are essential.
But only a trial can produce a historical record.
Most of the 52 indictments returned by the tri
bunal were lodged against Bosnia Serbs. They
include Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the
political and military leaders of the rebel Serbs.
Christopher wants the suspects tried by the tribunal.
"They represent a dangerous, competitive power
base which has systematically undermined the
objectives Milosevic has been seeking for the past six
months," said a senior U.S. official of the widening
rift between the wartime Bosnian Serb leaders and
their backer at, the time in Belgrade.
