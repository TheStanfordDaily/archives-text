More Americans overweight
NEW YORK (AP) — Who's ahead in the latest
poll? Not dieters.
Seventy-four percent of Americans 25 or older
are overweight, up from 71 percent a year ago, 69
percent in 1994, 66 percent in 1992 and only 59
percent 10 years ago, Louis Harris and Associates
reported.
The Harris Poll asked 1,005 randomly selected
adults about their weight and compared the
responses to recommended weight ranges for var
ious heights and body sizes. The company has
been doing this regularly since 1983, using
Metropolitan Life insurance tables from that
year.
For example, the insurance table recommends
that t medium-framed 5-foot-7 man weigh 140 to
152 pounds; a woman, 133 to 147.
The survey, taken Jan. 18-22, indicates that 24
percent of adults are over their recommended
weight range by 20 percent or more. That's gen
erally agreed to be the definition of obesity,
although there has been some controversy in
recent years about whether or not the old
Metropolitan Life tables were too strict.
Sampling error should not cause the percent
ages to be more than 3 points off what would be
found if all adults were asked the same questions
in the same way.
I)i denies divorce rumors
LONDON iAIM A $9 million home in Lon
don? Another $22.5 million in investments? Not
so, says Princess Diana, denying a newspaper
report that Prince Charles has agreed to give her
a lavish divorce settlement.
A spokeswoman for the princess said yesterday
there was "no truth" to a story in The Mail yes
terday purporting to detail Diana's demands and
the resulting settlement with het estranged hus
band, Prince Charles.
Among other conditions, the tabloid said Diana
insisted on taking over Clarence House, the home
for the past 40 years of the Queen Mother, moth
er of Queen Elizabeth 11.
The heir to the British throne and his wife,
who have two sons, separated in 1992. The queen
suggested in December that it was time the couple
make their split permanent.
Charles immediately agreed, but Diana has

said she is considering her position.
Diana still lives in an apartment in Kensington
Palace as do some other members of the royal
family. Charles moved out of that palace and into
an apartment in St. James's Palace when they
separated.
In an unattributed report, The Mail yesterday
said the divorce settlement includes $22.5 million
in investments, a London home worth about $9
million and a $1.5 million retreat in the country.
The tabloid said disagreement persists over
Diana's status, and that she insists on remaining
a senior member of the royal family and retaining
a title after divorce.
The queen's recommendation to divorce fol
lowed a I3BC television interview in which Diana
admitted having an affair, questioned Charles' fit
ness to be king and said she wanted to be a good
will ambassador for Britain.
Forbes edges ahead
WASHINGTON (AP) — As if the polls showing
Steve Forbes pulling even or ahead in New Hamp
shire aren't worrisome enough to Bob Dole, con
sider this scoreboard: Forbes 516, Dole 71.
The figures aren't from any poll, or prefer
ence ballot at a GOP event. But they are trou
bling nonetheless, representing the number of
Forbes and Dole ads that appeared the week
before last on Boston television — the most
important way of reaching voters in New Hamp
shire's Feb. 20 political primary. And for the
other Republican candidates, the Forbes edge is
even more lopsided.
It is an advantage that the other campaigns
have no way of overcoming as they scramble for a
way to derail Forbes; by using his own personal
fortune to pay for his campaign, the multimillion
aire publishing heir can ignore the spending lim
its imposed on other candidates.
"If his name was Forbes Malcolm, he wouldn't
be a serious candidate for mayor of a city in New
Jersey," former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander
complained last week.
As of last week, Forbes was spending on New
Hampshire and Boston TV at a rate that suggests
the average New Hampshire resident would have
already seen 135 of his ads. By Feb. 20, that expo
sure will grow to perhaps 200 Forbes ads, com
pared to roughly 35 for Dole, according to a Dole
campaign analysis.
