ONCE YOU GET caught up in
the daily grind of Stanford
life, it becomes difficult to
step back and think about what is
going on around you. It is ironic that
here at one of the world's finest
institutions of higher education, we
become so isolated in our own pri
vate enclaves. "I've got to study" has
become the catchphrase used to jus
tify political apathy
Before moving on to look at what
is going on in the world outside
Stanford, students must first open
their eyes here. Democracies can
only function when citizens have
enough information to make
informed decisions.
Stanford doesn't exactly fit into
the model of a democracy. The pres
ident is not chosen by the same
"electorate" he governs — the stu
dents, faculty and staff — nor do
they have any political check on his
actions. A shadow government of
the students exists in the form of the
ASSU, but this body lacks the politi
cal power to act as a check on the
University's administrative bodies.
Yet there is a vote of sorts. We all
chose to study at Stanford, and our
tuition bills each quarter are a refer
endum on whether our government
— the administration — is acting in
our best interests. We elect to take
certain courses in large numbers,
and either do not attend or sleep
through others.
There is also a source of informa
tion that serves as a check on our
government, following the model of a
democracy. As an independent news
paper that does not answer to the
"government," The Daily is free to
act as a watchdog on administrative
actions. We report on what we
believe to be the fundamental issues
affecting our readership — the mem
bers of the Stanford community
But without a response at the
"polls," this information functions
as little more that entertainment.
Without action and the empower
ment that this knowledge can give,
the voice of the electorate becomes
diminished even further.
In 1994, a new grading policy was
passed which reinstated the failing
grade in the form of the NP and
tightened Stanford's previously lib
eral course-drop policy. The change
in policy attracted national media

attention, but the student body
remained largely unmoved.
Last year, Stanford's speech code
was struck down by a Santa Clara
County judge. The code was created
after a 1988 incident in which van
dals spray-painted racist graffiti on
the wall of Ujamaa, the African-
American theme house. At the time,
the campus erupted into a spirited
debate on racism. When the code
was ruled unconstitutional, stu
dents were virtually silent on the
issue — whether in favor or against
the need for a speech code.
A Faculty Senate committee
recently authored a report titled
"Planning in an Era of Change"
which makes a number of recom
mendations regarding the direction
in which Stanford is headed. In this
report, it is suggested that the Uni
versity take a closer look at the
things it is doing in order to remain
competitive in the face of economic
hardship. This report has gone prac
tically unnoticed by students at
large.
At the next Board of Trustees
meeting, held on Feb. 12 and 13, the
yearly change to tuition costs will be
approved. Over the past few years,
this annual event has met with quiet
grumbling, but there has been little
public indication of whether people
understand the need for a tuition
increase or are angry about the esca
lating costs of a college education.
The information is there to act on
the issues that face our community.
The means exist whereby we all can
influence the way we are governed.
But without intelligent action and
vibrant debate, we can do nothing.
Take the tools available to you
and use them to take informed posi
tions. Act to let those in power know
how you feel about what you read on
our pages. Insure that the winds of
freedom continue to blow through
Stanford.
