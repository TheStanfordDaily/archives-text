Response to 'Asian fetish 9 column was an ovejreaction

lAM WRITING to criticize two con
demnatory responses to Tony
Small's Jan. 30 column, "Having an
Asian fetish." Although I certainly do
not agree with everything Small wrote,
I fail to see how his article constitutes
"a ridiculously ignorant discussion"
which displays The Daily's "lack of any
commitment to providing a forum for
discussing issues of importance to the
Stanford community" as charged by
Mia Bruch and Alejandra Mazon in
their Feb. 1 response, "Small's Asian
fetish perpetuates racial stereotypes."
Judging by these critics' own heated
responses, this subject is of consider
able concern to many Stanford stu
dents and deserves to be discussed.
I proudly call myself "politically cor
rect," but I also value free speech and
the importance of reasoned discussion.
I am worried by the dismissive manner
in which both responses reject out of

hand Small's claim that he is attracted
to the physical qualities of Asian (by
which he apparently means East
Asian) women.
Bruch and Mazon tell us that
"Small disingenuously insist[s] that
his 'appreciation' for Asian women is
merely an aesthetic preference for 'the
hair, the skin, the eyes."' Why is this
so incredible? How do Bruch and
Mazon know Small is lying?
These critics are the ones trying to
stifle discussion of issues by labeling
anyone who holds or expresses a differ
ent view as "disingenuous" and
"moronic" (from Arnab Chandra's Feb.
2 response, "Tony Small's final column
was way off base").
While I take issue with some of
Small's points, I do not condemn him
for sharing his inner ideas and feel
ings. Some of his arguments were
interesting and made me think about

the issue differently. For example, he
pointed out that few people are both
ered if an African-American male
wants to date only African-American
women, but that many of these same
people would be horrified if that same
man preferred to date only white
women. This is the purpose of commu
nication; we share ideas so that we
each move beyond the limitations of
our own thoughts and experiences.
Chandra denies that someone could
have a physical attraction to such a
broad group of different-looking people
as East Asians: "ask some native Chi
nese, Japanese or Koreans whether
they all 'look the same.' " Well, when
my wife (who is Chinese) and I trav
eled to Shanghai via Tokyo, everyone
at the airport and on the plane from
Tokyo to Shanghai continually tried to
speak to my wife in Japanese. There
are obviously differences, but the dif-

ferences between, say, Koreans and
Chinese appear to me at least to be
smaller than those between, say, Kore
ans and Iranians. So, I do not neces
sarily reject as mere rationalization
Small's claim of physical attraction.
There may be other factors in his
mind, but that is unclear.
Finally, I reject Chandra's notion of
"imagined cultural 'differences.' " One
of the greatest reasons why I so love
my wife is her very strong love of fami
ly. This is unquestionably a character
istic of Chinese families relative to
American families. I am, of course,
generalizing, but we cannot discuss
such issues honestly if we pretend that
everyone and every culture is funda
mentally the same. There are differ
ences and this cultural diversity is to
the benefit of all humanity.
