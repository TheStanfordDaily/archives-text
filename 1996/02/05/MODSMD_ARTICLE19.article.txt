# Dormmate defends Small's statements
## 
### 
The amount of anger that Tony
Small's column has generated absolutely
astounds me. The two students who
expressed their disapproval in Tuesday's
Daily spoke for many but equally offend
ed others. In my dorm, where Small also
lives, some residents have been very vocal
about their displeasure.
I agree that the term "Asian fetish"

was a poor choice of words, but I am dis
appointed that so many people in the
Stanford community have overreacted
this strongly. I interpreted Small's point
to be, simply, that he had a preference for
Asian women. A proclivity. A tendency.
Not a racist desire for an Oriental doll.
Everybody has preferences about their
ideal romantic partner, whether it's
about personality, interests, background,
race or even gender.
Mia Bruch and Alejandra Mazon
angrily assert that Small's "fetish" has
"nothing to do with personal compatibili

ty, mutual goals or even a matter of pure
aesthetics. Rather, it is merely a perpetu
ation of the sexualization of Asian women
in Western culture through their portray
al as repositories of a mysterious and
exotic sexuality." I feel they unfairly
jumped to conclusions. Small did not
mean he automatically desires every
Asian, just because of her ethnicity, or
that he never discriminates among these
women on the basis of personal compati
bility, mutual goals and other interper
sonal factors.
As an Asian-American female, I under

stand how women like myself have been
"sexualized," "eroticized" and stereotyped
in American popular culture. Such actions
enrage me, too. Still, I try to recognize
people's freedom of expression, and not to
immediately assume everyone is preju
diced and everything is a racist attack. I
am saddened that Small has been unable
to express his honest, if somewhat un
politically correct, opinions without a sub
stantial percentage of the Stanford com
munity jumping down his throat.
