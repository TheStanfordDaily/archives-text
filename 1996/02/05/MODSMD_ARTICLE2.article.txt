# Bill may curb on-line obscenity
## 
### David Stein Contributing writer 
A new telecommunications bill passed by Con
gress last week may make Stanford criminally li
able for any obscene material transmitted on its
computer network.
The Telecommunications Reform Bill loosens
communications regulations which could eventu
ally reduce student rates for cable television and
phone service. However, it tightens indecency
standards, affecting computer network users all
over the country.
Only 21 legislators voted against the bill, which
President Clinton plans to sign.
Attached to the bill deregulatingcable and local
phone businesses is the Communications Inde
cency Act, sponsored by Sen. James Exon, D-Neb.,
which prohibits any "obscene, lewd, lascivious,
filthy or indecent |material 1 with intent to annoy,
abuse, threaten or harass another person" on a
network accessible to minors. Violation of this
regulation can result in fines up to $100,000 and
jail terms of two years.
Because some Stanford students are under 18
years old and the University controls more than
25,000 computers that can be accessed from any
where around the world, the indecency act may
cause a change in University policy, General
Counsel Michael Roster said.
"We have a lot of people looking at this bill, and
it definitely raises a lot of issues," Roster said. "We
will have to ask ourselves to what extent Univer
sity computer facilities can only be used for acade
mic or other legitimate purposes.

"We're also concerned because we deal with
employment and are under many government
contracts, so the use we provide may have to be
changed," Roster said.
According to Chief Information Officer Glen
Mueller, the University will take no action until it
has taken a closer look at the bill, but he said the
technology is in place to "filter" obscene material
if it is deemed necessary.
"Like any major network, we have the ability to

implement any changes [in network material] if
we need to," Mueller said.
Mueller said the University does not currently
monitor the content of computer transmissions
but that certain newsgroups already are prohibit
ed from network servers.
The bill's term of "indecency" will be hard to de
fine, said Michael Roberts, a former Stanford em-

Sothy Chhe â€” Daily

ployee and vice president of Educom,
an association of colleges and univer
sities concerned with computing and
information technology.
"The bill does not just deal with
adult sexual content lieing seen by
minors," Roberts said. "It goes way
beyond that, applying broadcast
television's very restrictive mea
sures to the Internet.
"Congress attempts to define
such things as the picture of bare
breasts or frontal nudity as ob
scene, not just the gross, porno
graphic stuff," Roberts explained.
The bill's effects are nebulous at
best, Roberts said, because there is
major opposition from both mem
bers of Congress and civil rights

groups. The American Civil Liber
ties Union has already challenged
the legitimacy of the bill, claiming
that discussion about abortion and
controversial literature such as
"The Catcher in the Rye" may l>e re
stricted from Internet discussion. In
addition, the Department of Justice
has yet to examine the bill's legality.
Although she voted for the bill,
Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., said she
strongly disagrees with the indecen
cy clause.
"I'm strongly opposed to any type
of censorship," Eshoo said, pointing
out that House republicans did not
allow any debate on this matter be
fore putting the entire bill up for
vote.
Roberts said the bill was backed
by many conservatives, including
the Christian Coalition. Many ele
mentary and secondary education
leaders also supported the bill be

cause they would be "massacred," in
Roberts' words, if parents discov
ered their children had seen sexually
explicit images on school computers.
In addition, Roberts said this bill,
after further review, might not be
applicable to institutions of higher
education.
"After all, this is the last thing the
freedom and scholarly learning
crowd needs," Roberts said.
Although the indecency act. may
curb free speech, the University will
benefit from other parts of the
telecommunications bill, which in
tends to break up monopolies of local
phone companias, Roberts added.
This could lead to lower phone and
cable television rates for students in
future years.
"Because the communication
companies will be more competitive,
the University's costs will definitely
come down," Roberts said.
