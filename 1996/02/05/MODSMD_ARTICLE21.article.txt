## Bill Shen It's time to reform the ASSU 
### 
WHAT WE need
is a good spank
ing. Nothing
kinky — just enough to
knock some sense into
me and those zany
ASSU babies. I'm
embarrassed, humiliat
ed and sick of watching
the ASSU rot away its

enormous potential.
Let me be clear — I do not live in an
ASSU fairyland. Just a guess, but you
probably don't tear into every Daily in des
perate anticipation of savoring every juicy
ASSU tidbit. Am I right? Now maybe, just
maybe, it would be correct to assume that
you would find some things more impor
tant than the latest ASSU politicking. So
for the purpose of saving space, I'm going
to simplify the situation a bit.
First things first.. . what the heck is the
ASSU anyway? Hmm . . . lately it seems to
be more like the ASSes and you. Basically
there's the business side and the political
side. I've been a part of the political zoo
much too long to be satisfied with the
bureaucracy and childish in-fighting which
accomplishes little. To be fair, the Associat
ed Students of Stanford University does
provide vital services, funding and a voice
for students and student groups.
Once in a while, a blown out of propor
tion "scandal" or feared "government shut
down" provides mild entertainment bested
by only the Jerp/ Springer Show. Truth is,
99 percent of the L r ood that we do is done by

the business side umbrella — groups like
Speakers Bureau, Cardinal Collection, Lec
ture Notes, the Directory, Group Discounts,
SURE and Flicks. Meanwhile, the political
side manages to bungle the basics, turn peo
ple ofT and storm out of meetings like
spoiled brats. The student voice has been
reduced to a whisper and the elected sena
tors and presidents who promised to "fight
for you" whimper.
The Problem. We are not a student
"government" by any stretch of the imag
ination. The idea of a "government"
implies the ability to enact and enforce
laws. At best, we are grass-roots advocates
who can, with the support of students,
promote and protect what Stanford stu
dents value. Casper, Condi, the trustees
and the other powers-that-be don't
respect an unprofessional, inefficient and
ineffective group — I don't blame them.
Let's clean house and earn their respect.
Then we'll talk about holding tuition flat,
turning Tresidder into a real student
union and maintaining a safe campus.
Cleaning House. Why in the world do
we have four presidents anyway? And who
are they? You deserve better than a nebu
lous "COP." Students should be able to hold
someone — and only one person — account
able. The COP spends most of its time
updating, fighting with and appeasing each
other. A cute idea to promote teamwork has
bred a 8.5.-to-substance ratio higher than
what students' needs demand. We need
decisions, not gridlock. And can any sensible
person tell me why we need 40 senators?

Half of the 40 aren't even allowed to vote.
The COP is too big, the Senate is too big, the
egos are too big — not reasons to shun the
ASSU, but reasons to change the ASSU.
Party 'lime. What's with political par
ties and their delusions of grandeur? Stu
dents with common interests should remain
just that; not machines unwilling to resolve
differences because of paranoia. The parties
as we know it are choking the ASSU.
Respect within will command respect with
out.
Why? The ASSU Senate and COP have
been trying hard to protect financial aid,
defend diversity, address student health
concerns and communicate with the stu
dent body — and time and time again, the
structure defeats the good intentions of
your elected representatives. Few have the
patience to stick with self-defeat and disap
pointment. But despite the lack of enthusi
asm, there are issues which need attention.
Evaluations of the alcohol policy, the
planned judicial affairs reform, Creek issues
and academic revisions are too important to
let the existing ASSU bureaucracy inter
fere.
The Solution. Real change. Fundamen
tal change. Substantial change. One presi
dent, fewer senators — accountable by
name, responsible by tasks and visible by
you. This bold vision can only happen if stu
dents want it to. It is your ASSU — it's
broke; let's fix it.

Bill Shen is deputy chair of the ASSU
Senate.
