## An annunciation of ambition: Prophecy from a peon 
### 
"And, again, one in human form touched
me and strengthened me."
— Daniel 10:18
About 18 months ago I wrote a play
that was comprised primarily of Con
kersations between m\ brother,
Daniel, and an angel with a Nestle Quik
fetish. It was pretty good, I think, and it was
rereived fairly well when it went up a
year ago this week
But:
1 recently had ;ui experience which made
me a little embarrassed about that piece.
Only last night I found myself in the midst
of a vision. And in that vision 1 think I actu
ally spoke to an angel Mind you, I'd never
had a vision before — once, I ate a bad bur
rito and hallucinated that my Powerbook
was Stephanie Seymour, but that hardly
counts (though it did cost me 600 bucks to
get the disk drive repaired). But this looked
to be the real deal.
The thing is, I'd been upall night sulking
over changes made to a script I wrote this
summer that's l>eing performed in a few
days. I 'd just hit the point where I was ready
to pitch the damn thing into a dumpster
when the Ezekielian drama began ...
The lights dropped. A trumpet blasted a
Hendrix riff 1 smellvd the color blue and
several bewinged beasts resembling the tat
too on Axl Hose's left forearm flew over my
head.

I felt a cold wind, then a mist, then a fire.
And when the still, small voice came, it
itisn '! (i<>d I sair, I tit some frumpy middle
agedguyin a bad blue suit He was balding
worse than I am.
1 asked him his name.
"Name?" he whined. "What's an
i ni names good for? You and
your consciousness arc outta here in
ahout 10 minutes."
'Well mine Michael, I offered.
(11kkI for you, Mr. Michael."
Hi.-attarl« stripped me of my confidence.
1 frit lii.'' I \v;i.- talking to a stilts TA. "Why
are you being so cantankerous?"
Ile chuckled "Hello'.' Mr. Michael is so
comfortable hallucinating that the first
tilings he can think to do in the presence of
an in;:< i are lie a wi-r ass and show off his
v< icabulary? No wonder your parents had to
tillk to sour principal so many times."
"It wasn't m\ fault, ltabhi Freedman
hated me!"
"That much at least is true. Don't worry
though, he' I een impotent for the kist four
years."
"M;. prayer u ire heard then."
'Of course, all prayers are heard. You
- -It murks are too damn lend not to hear."
"Then how come —
"I'lease, just because we hear doesn't
n>i in w-' answer Imagine if you sent away
for every credit card you gut offered in the
mail."

"Fair enough." Now, I wjis still a little
nervous at this point, but I had to ask. "Urn,
Mr. Angel-man . .."
"Fine, call me Maury, please. Anything's
gotta Ix 3 better than Mr. Angel-man."
"Fine, Maury — uh, what's going on
here? I can't have ascended to the level of
prophecy. The only holy things I've done
recently are recycle and avoid pork."
"I ley, the Big Guy said to pop by and give
you 10 minutes to ask whatever you want. I
didn't argue. So let's get on with it, ask me
something."
The pressure made me forget everything
of importance. "Umm, what is sin?"
"Sin is a byproduct of insanity."
"Ours or His?"
"Don't be impetuous — I've got autho
rization to turn you into a pillar of salt if
need be."
"No, not salt, I'm watching my blood
pressure. Peppier maybe. Or basil."
"Get on with it — you've got seven min
utes to go."
"Err, is there life alter death? Is evil its
own entity or is it the absence of good? Will
my honors thesis ever get finished?"
"Please, some questions have no
answers. Now you could save me a huge
headache, if you just ask me what I was sent
to talk to you about?"
At first I didn't realize what he'd meant.
Then, I remembered what'd been keeping
me up the whole night. "Explain to me the

human urge to create."
"Why? You knocked up?"
"No, I mean creativity. Tell me Maury,
why are we compelled to make things?" He
shrugged. "I though you said the Big Guy
told you to answer my questions."
"lie only said to let you ask — he didn't
specify I had to answer."
"Please tell me! Because it's killing me.
Why do we bother straining ourselves with
art and beauty? I mean, existentially speak
ing, life's got all the impact of a game of tic
tac-toe. So what's the point of effort? If reli
gion is a sham defense designed by chance to
kivp us from recognizing the atrocities of
existence on a day-to-day basis, why should
we bother to improve the state of things?"
"I'm sorry, your time's up."
"I've got another five minutes!"
"Yeah, but you're getting into things I'm
not very good with. Lwk, if you want me to
understand you you'll have to restate that
without the humanities jargon. Really, if I
knew it was gonna be one of these break
downs I'd have brought over Vito, my part
ner. He used to sit in on philosophy lectures
at UC-Davis."
"Really, did he have to register as an out
of-stater?"
"Can we just get to the point Mr.
Michael?"
It was time to admit it. "I'm worried
about my script." I smiled sheepishly. "You
see, I wrote this play. It's okay I guess, but

everyone wants me to change it. Only 1 can't
bring myself to."
Maury's face lit up some. "Okay, now I
understand. You're nervous about how
some audience is gonna view your piece, but
caring about all that won't gel with your
embittered (and probably way off) cosmolo
gy unless you own up to having both ego and
ambition. After all, how can life be absurd if
you give a crap?"
I think my mouth dropped. "And that's
why I'm upset?"
"Pretty much, that and because you're
not very bright.
"Great, thanks. Anything else you'd like
to tell me?"
"Yes, I have to go now."
I grabbed his sleeve. "Wait! Last ques
tion: Eighth grade — Dina Greenberg..
"She totally wanted you — you shoulda
asked her out."
And that was it. Poof.
Gone. He disappeared before I could ask
him what to do and I awoke in my bed, in a
puddle of my own drool. No messages to
deliver to Nineveh, no whales to swallow me
whole.
Nothing to ease my mind but a sincere
exhaustion and the vague feeling that petti
ness is just our way of trying making a dif
ference.
Oh, and a new appreciation for the use
lessness of revelation.
