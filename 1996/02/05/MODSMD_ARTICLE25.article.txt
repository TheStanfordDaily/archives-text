Stanford 83

Following an emotional win
over California last Wednesday
and heading into conference clash
es with USC and UCIA, the Stan
ford men's basketball team contin
ued its streak of solid, team-orient-

Ed basketball in yesterday's Inau
gural Bay Area Classic.
Stanford (13-5, 6-3 Pacific 10
Conference) notched its third-con
secutive victory with a 83-60
blowout win over the Seton Hall
Pirates (10-9, 6-5 Big East) in an
interconference clash before
11,731 at the San Jose Arena.
"It was a pretty good win," said
head coach Mike Montgomery. "It
was a good defensive effort. We
had a chance to get caved in on the
boards and did not.
"Basically, in the first half, they
were scoring pretty much on put
backs or breakdowns as compared
to set offense. So we felt that if we
shored that up, we'd be fine."
The Cardinal broke a tight
game open in the second half with
stingy defense that forced the
Pirates into a frigid 36.9 percent
shooting clip. Stanford outscored
Seton Hall 21-6 in the final 10
minutes, 17 seconds and held the
Pirates without a field goal for the
game's final seven minutes.
Stanford also out-rebounded
Seton i hill 25-13 in the second half
and 39-33 for the game. Senior
Andy Poppink pulled clown a
team-high 10 boards.
Pirate leading scorer Adrian
Griffin single-handedly kept Seton
Hall in the game for the first 30
minutes, racking up 25 points on
11 -of-19 shooting. Griffin exploit
ed a significant size advantage
over Cardinal senior David Har
bour, establishing good position in
the lane and getting good looks
over the smaller I larbour.
"We obviously had problems
with Griffin," Montgomery said.
"He is very big and strong. He's a
tough matchup for Dave anyway,
starting the three-guard lineup
like we are. We had some problems
and they ended up going to him a
lot."
The second-half defensive
charge was led by junior Rich
Jackson, who spelled Harbour at
the 13-minute mark after Har
bour picked up his third foul. Tak
ing advantage of Jackson's size,
the Cardinal held Griffin scoreless
for the remainder of the game.
"I thought Rich Jackson did a
great job," Montgomery said.
