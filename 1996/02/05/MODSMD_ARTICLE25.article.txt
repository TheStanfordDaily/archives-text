Stanford 83

Following an emotional win
over California last Wednesday
and heading into conference clash
es with USC and UCIA, the Stan
ford men's basketball team contin
ued its streak of solid, team-orient-

Ed basketball in yesterday's Inau
gural Bay Area Classic.
Stanford (13-5, 6-3 Pacific 10
Conference) notched its third-con
secutive victory with a 83-60
blowout win over the Seton Hall
Pirates (10-9, 6-5 Big East) in an
interconference clash before
11,731 at the San Jose Arena.
"It was a pretty good win," said
head coach Mike Montgomery. "It
was a good defensive effort. We
had a chance to get caved in on the
boards and did not.
"Basically, in the first half, they
were scoring pretty much on put
backs or breakdowns as compared
to set offense. So we felt that if we
shored that up, we'd be fine."
The Cardinal broke a tight
game open in the second half with
stingy defense that forced the
Pirates into a frigid 36.9 percent
shooting clip. Stanford outscored
Seton Hall 21-6 in the final 10
minutes, 17 seconds and held the
Pirates without a field goal for the
game's final seven minutes.
Stanford also out-rebounded
Seton i hill 25-13 in the second half
and 39-33 for the game. Senior
Andy Poppink pulled clown a
team-high 10 boards.
Pirate leading scorer Adrian
Griffin single-handedly kept Seton
Hall in the game for the first 30
minutes, racking up 25 points on
11 -of-19 shooting. Griffin exploit
ed a significant size advantage
over Cardinal senior David Har
bour, establishing good position in
the lane and getting good looks
over the smaller I larbour.
"We obviously had problems
with Griffin," Montgomery said.
"He is very big and strong. He's a
tough matchup for Dave anyway,
starting the three-guard lineup
like we are. We had some problems
and they ended up going to him a
lot."
The second-half defensive
charge was led by junior Rich
Jackson, who spelled Harbour at
the 13-minute mark after Har
bour picked up his third foul. Tak
ing advantage of Jackson's size,
the Cardinal held Griffin scoreless
for the remainder of the game.
"I thought Rich Jackson did a
great job," Montgomery said.

Brevin Knight drives on Pirate defender Danny Hurley. Knight won
the point guard matchup, outscoring Hurley 13-7.
"That was a key for us because
they were not getting the ball
down and [Griffin] was they guy
they were going to. We slowly but
surely started to move that lead
up."
Griffin's productivity kept the
game close throughout the first
half. His 16 first-half points
helped the Pirates keep to within
four at halftime, 35-31.
With Jackson taking Griffin
out of the picture, the Pirate
offense sputtered. Griffin, last
week's Big East Conference Play
er of the Week, got little help
aside from junior forward Bay
onee Taty's 14 points. Senior
point guard Danny Hurley had a
particularly bad afternoon, scor
ing a lackluster seven points on
just 3-of-12 shooting.
"We thought we could score
inside and we did to a degree."
said Seton Hall coach George
Blaney. "We just didn't get
enough offense from enough dif
ferent people."
At the other end of the court,
the Cardinal offense continued to
burn up the nets, converting on
53.7 percent of its shot attempts.
Yesterday marked the third
straight game in which Stanford
has shot better than 50 percent
from the field.
While Seton Hall struggled
with distribution, the Cardinal
did not. Stanford held a signifi
cant 19-9 advantage in assists
with Brevin Knight once again
leading the team with nine dish
es. Stanford's unselfish play
vaulted four different players
into double-figures.
"Stanford just executed really
well," Blaney said. "When we got
down about eight, we still
thought we were OK. We were
doing some pretty good things.
We were getting the ball inside,
we were getting the ball to the
basket and we just came up
empty a couple times. The next
thing you know, (Stanford's leadl
was over 10. And that's when
they just executed exceptionally
well. Brevin just did a terrific job
at getting the ball to the right
people."
Senior guard Dion Cross led
the Cardinal offensive attack

with 23 points on 6-of-10 shoot
ing from the floor, including 3 of
4 from three-point range. Cross
also reinforced his position as the
nation's most accurate free
throw shooter, knocking down 8-
of-8 from the charity stripe.
Knight, playing against his
hometown team, tallied 13 points
and nine assists. Poppink and
Harbour also contributed offen
sively, finishing with 14 and 11
points, respectively.
Led by Jackson's effort, the
Cardinal bench also continued its
recent surge of success. In addi
tion to his defense, Jackson con
tributed nine points while Har
bour sat on the bench in foul
trouble. Freshman Arthur Lee
also stepped in for Brevin Knight,
who picked up two early fouls.
Knight left with Stanford up 23-
19 and Lee maintained that four
point Cardinal advantage in eight
minutes of action.
"We're getting great contribu
tions off the bench," Harbour
said. "When a starter gets in foul
trouble or is not playing the way
he should be, we just bring in a
guy off the bench and he's doing a
great job."
Yesterday's inter sec tio n a 1
game was huge in regards to the
NCAA tournament, as the tourna
ment committee often looks close
ly at nonconference matchups. "It
was a must-win for us," Knight
said. "We had the USF loss and we
had the big North Carolina loss.
"We needed this. It was a
I nationally televised) game. A lot
of people were watching, and we
had to show people that we were a
good team . . .This was big for us,
this was very big."
Montgomery agreed with his
point guard's assessment.
"You get down to the end and
if Seton Hall beats a Syracuse
they lalready] did beat a Villano
va — then this thing looks good
for us," he said. "It puts us maybe
as a better basketball team in
people's eyes. But we have got to
get up in the top of this [Pac-10]
conference. We're tied for second,
but there's a whole slew of us
right now and we've got to stay
up there."
Montgomery's squad returns
to Pac-10 Conference competition
this week with a Thursday night
matchup against USC and a Sat
urday afternoon battle versus the
first-place UCLA Bruins.
