While u national television
audience watched the Stanford
men's basketball team blow out
Seton Hall in yesterday's 83-60
Cardinal victory, the Pirates saw
what is and caught a glimpse of
what could have been.
"What is" was senior Pirate
guard Danny Hurley, who was
run ragged all da\ long by "what
could have been," junior Cardinal
guard Brevin Knight. Hailing
from East Orange, N.J. Just next
to Seton Hall, and wit h both par
ents having worked with the
Pirates in some capacity there is
little doubt that had Seton Hall
offered Knight a place on its
squad, the superstar point guard
would have had some serious

thinking to do.
"llf Seton Hall had made me
an offer], it would have been
something I would have had to
think about at that time," Knight
said. "But with them nut recruit
ing me, it was an easy decision for
me to come to Stanford'."
The Pirates' loss was the Car
dinal's gain. Knight was literally
twice as effective as Hurley, his
Seton Hall counterpart. Knight
finished the game with 18 points,
nine assists, three steals and two
rebounds compared to Hurley's
seven points, two assists, two
steals and one rebound. Knight
shot an efficient, it not spectacu
lar, five-of-10 from the floor while
Hurley struggled to convert just
three-of-12 from the floor.
Knight's performance was
markedly different than that in

his first meeting against his
hometown club as a freshman,
when he scored just four points in
Stanford's 75-69 loss to the
Pirates.
"Brevin's much more mature,
like all of us from our freshman
year to our junior year," said
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "He has a much better
understanding of what his role is.
1 le's much more comfortable.
"It's still hard though. It's still
emotionally difficult for him
because it is home for him. There
is no baggage with the recruit
ment, but it is home. His mother
works there. His dad coached
there. He grew up there."
In an interview with ABC after
the victory, Knight tried to down
