# Victory is sweet for Knight

### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
While u national television
audience watched the Stanford
men's basketball team blow out
Seton Hall in yesterday's 83-60
Cardinal victory, the Pirates saw
what is and caught a glimpse of
what could have been.
"What is" was senior Pirate
guard Danny Hurley, who was
run ragged all da\ long by "what
could have been," junior Cardinal
guard Brevin Knight. Hailing
from East Orange, N.J. Just next
to Seton Hall, and wit h both par
ents having worked with the
Pirates in some capacity there is
little doubt that had Seton Hall
offered Knight a place on its
squad, the superstar point guard
would have had some serious

thinking to do.
"llf Seton Hall had made me
an offer], it would have been
something I would have had to
think about at that time," Knight
said. "But with them nut recruit
ing me, it was an easy decision for
me to come to Stanford'."
The Pirates' loss was the Car
dinal's gain. Knight was literally
twice as effective as Hurley, his
Seton Hall counterpart. Knight
finished the game with 18 points,
nine assists, three steals and two
rebounds compared to Hurley's
seven points, two assists, two
steals and one rebound. Knight
shot an efficient, it not spectacu
lar, five-of-10 from the floor while
Hurley struggled to convert just
three-of-12 from the floor.
Knight's performance was
markedly different than that in

his first meeting against his
hometown club as a freshman,
when he scored just four points in
Stanford's 75-69 loss to the
Pirates.
"Brevin's much more mature,
like all of us from our freshman
year to our junior year," said
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "He has a much better
understanding of what his role is.
1 le's much more comfortable.
"It's still hard though. It's still
emotionally difficult for him
because it is home for him. There
is no baggage with the recruit
ment, but it is home. His mother
works there. His dad coached
there. He grew up there."
In an interview with ABC after
the victory, Knight tried to down
play the emotional significance of
the game, but backcourt mate
junior Dion Cross knew better.
"It was pretty big I for
Brevin]," Cross said. "His fresh
man year he went up there and
didn't do well at all. 1 heard him
say that it wasn't big, but that's
all for TV. It's more like [he
wanted to sayl 'Seton Hall, look
what you passed up.'
"I think individually he didn't
do as well as he would have liked,
but from a team viewpoint we
won and that's more important."
Knight was handcuffed in the
first half by two early fouls. With
over 10 minutes left to play, the
Cardinal floor general picked up
his second foul and wound up
playing only 12 minutes in the
first half, collecting just two
points and three assists.
But while Knight may not
have shone offensively, he did a
brilliant job defending Hurley,
who entered the contest averag
ing 16.2 points-per-game and 5.7
assists-per-game. In the first half.
Hurley had no points, missing on
all six field goal attempts, while
committing three turnovers and
garnering just two assists.
"Hurley was a key guy for
them," Knight said. "I took it as a
challenge to try and shut him
down."
The second half didn't get
much better for the Seton Hall
point man, either. Although Hur
ley managed to convert three of
his six second-half field goal
attempts, including a three
pointer, he appeared frazzled on
the court and was eaten up on
more than one occasion by
Knight's quickness.

"I would have liked to play a
little bit more in the first half, but
I got into foul trouble," Knight
said. "But those things happened
and I had to just work through it.
Coach told me to come out in the
second half, work hard and make
a difference. That's what I tried
to do."
With 14 minutes to go and the
Cardinal up just 47-42, Knight
blew past the fiat-footed Hurley
for an easy lay-in. On the ensuing
Stanford possession, with Seton
Hall in a full-court press, Knight
sliced, diced and danced his way to
the hoop for another easy lay-up.
Meanwhile, the only thing
Hurley was doing was picking up
fouls left and right. With 11:59 to
play and Hurley draped all over
him, Knight drained a baseline
jumper and drew foul number
four on Hurley. Eventually,
senior Stanford forward Andy
Poppink put the frustrated, flus
tered Hurley, bad haircut, side
burns and all, out of his misery by
drawing a game-ending fifth foul
on the frustrated Seton Hall
guard, who probably wished it
had come sooner.
"The biggest thing is we got a
victory," Knight said. "Last time,
I didn't play well, and we lost. I
don't think I played exceptionally
well today, but I did what I had to
do for the team to win. A victory
for the team outweighs the per
sonal things."
So while there probably
weren't too many thoughts of
retribution, revenge or redemp
tion crossing Knight's mind after
the game, it still must have been
nice to show Seton Hall what it
was missing.
"It was all their choice,"
Knight said. "I wasn't what they
needed at that time and I'm
happy where I am now."
So is Stanford basketball.
