Stanford 80

Things went basically as
planned for the Stanford
women's basketball team Friday
night against Cal.
With an 8-0 record in Pacific
10 Conference play and a No. 5
national ranking in tow, the Car
dinal fully expected to dominate a
hapless California team that
hadn't won a game at home in a
month and a half.
And dominate they did.
Led by Vanessa Nygaard's 21
points and Kate Starbird's 19,
Stanford (16-2 overall, 9-0 Pac
-10) jumped out to an 46-27 half
time lead and rolled to an easy
80-55 victory over Cal (5-13, 1-8)
in a Pac-10 Conference game at
Berkeley's Harmon Gvm.
Things stayed close for a
while, despite the fact that Cal
made just eight of its first 27
shots. With tin. 1 two teams knot
ted at 18 points, it appeared as
though the Golden Bears still
had a chance to pull off the
upset.
But Cal quickly discovered
what Stanford opponents have
been learning all year — you
can't afford to make mistakes
against a team as talented as the
Cardinal. With the game still
close, the Golden Bears slipped
into a funk that saw them miss
10 of 11 shots. Stanford quickly
took advantage, taking off on an
11-0 tear that gave the Cardinal a
13-point lead at 34-21.
