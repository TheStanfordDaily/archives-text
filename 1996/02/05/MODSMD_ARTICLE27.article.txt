## Fifth-ranked Cardinal still perfect in Pac-10

Stanford 80

Things went basically as
planned for the Stanford
women's basketball team Friday
night against Cal.
With an 8-0 record in Pacific
10 Conference play and a No. 5
national ranking in tow, the Car
dinal fully expected to dominate a
hapless California team that
hadn't won a game at home in a
month and a half.
And dominate they did.
Led by Vanessa Nygaard's 21
points and Kate Starbird's 19,
Stanford (16-2 overall, 9-0 Pac
-10) jumped out to an 46-27 half
time lead and rolled to an easy
80-55 victory over Cal (5-13, 1-8)
in a Pac-10 Conference game at
Berkeley's Harmon Gvm.
Things stayed close for a
while, despite the fact that Cal
made just eight of its first 27
shots. With tin. 1 two teams knot
ted at 18 points, it appeared as
though the Golden Bears still
had a chance to pull off the
upset.
But Cal quickly discovered
what Stanford opponents have
been learning all year — you
can't afford to make mistakes
against a team as talented as the
Cardinal. With the game still
close, the Golden Bears slipped
into a funk that saw them miss
10 of 11 shots. Stanford quickly
took advantage, taking off on an
11-0 tear that gave the Cardinal a
13-point lead at 34-21.

It was all Stanford from there
on out. The Cardinal led by 19 at
intermission and cleared the
bench in the second half en route
to the 25-point win.
While the Cardinal clearly dom
inated the game throughout,
women's head coach Amy Tucker
wasn't entirely pleased with her
team's performance, insisting that
Stanford played merely "OK."
"We still didn't move the ball
real well," Tucker said.
Starbird, a junior forward, fin
ished 9-of-17 from the floor but
complained alter the game that she
missed too many easy shots.
Nygaard, meanwhile, made seven of
13 shots and buried six of eight free
throws in pacing the Cardinal with

21 points. Naomi Mulitauaopele
added 12 and Heather Owen
pitched in 10 for Stanford, which
has now won 10 straight games.
Friday's win gave Stanford a
perfect 9-0 mark in Pac-10 play at
the midway point in the confer
ence season. No women's team
has gone undefeated in the Pac
-10 since Tara VanDerveer's Stan
ford squad went 18-0 during the
1988-89 season. The Cardinal,
winner of 18 consecutive confer
ence games, has finished in at
least a first-place tie in the Pac-10
seven out of the last eight years.
Cal, on the other hand, has
been suffering through a miser
able year under head coach Gooch
Foster, a 17-year veteran and the
dean of Pac-10 head basketball
coaches. The Golden Bears, losers
of seven straight, have not been
competitive in the conference
since 1993. This season Cal

appears headed for the conference
cellar after finishing 2-16 and 5-
13 the past two seasons.
"1 don't get Fos
ter said. "We had three freshmen
out there for a while and you're
going to get that when you have a
young team. We just think about
playing games and getting ready
for the next game."
Friday night's drubbing was
witnessed by 3,282 fans, the
third-largest crowd ever for a Cal
women's home game. What they
saw was nothing new — the Bears
have not won a game at Harmon
Gym since Dec. 17.
Cal had four players in double
figures but none that tallied more
than 12 points. Six-foot-three
freshman center Jennie Leander
pulled down nine rebounds and
senior forward Kerri Barrett
scored 12 points for the Golden
Bears.
