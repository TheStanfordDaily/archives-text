An opening-night record

at Stanford's Sunken Diamond
to watch the No. 2 Cardinal bat
tle No. 1 Cal State-Fullerton, the
defending NCAA champion, in
(lie first night game ever (o be
played on the Farm.
The crowd was not disap

5-0 victory behind a stellar
pitching performance from
starter Kyle Peterson (1-1), who
carried a no-hitter through 7

run home run over the right field
fence in the fifth and making a slid
ing catch to preserve the no-hitter
in the top of the sixth.
The two teams met again on Sat
urday and, after a three-hour rain
delay, Fullerton (1-1) notched its
first victory of 1996 with a 7-0 win
over the Cardinal (3-2). Titan hurler
Brent Billingsley (1-0) held Stan
ford scoreless for eight innings
before reliever Mark Chavez nailed
down the win.
Although the Cardinal would
have liked the chance to take two
out of three from Cal State-Fuller
ton, Mother Nature called the series
a draw. Yesterday's 1 p.m. game
was rained out.
Friday night, however, the
weather was crystal clear and Peter
son threw a gem under Sunken Dia
mond's new lights. After a rocky
start last week in Hawaii, the sopho
more returned to the form he dis
played a year ago en route to a 14-1
record. After walking the game's
first batter, Peterson retired the

next 13 Titans he faced. The big
right hander worked a 1-2-3 sev
enth, then recorded the first two
outs of the eighth before surrender
ing a hit to Fullerton's number-nine
hitter, Steve Chatham. Peterson
completed the inning, then gave
way to freshman Chad Hutchinson,
who retired the side in order in the
ninth.
Peterson said the biggest differ
ence between his two outings was
the effectiveness of his change-up.
"It's a relief to throw a good
game. I'd be lying if I said I had no
doubts in my mind after last week,"
he said. "But I worked some things
out in the bullpen and got my
change back. I was able to throw it
anytime in the count."
Although Peterson came within
four outs of a no-hitter, fatigue set
in during the middle innings.
"Right now, I'm at the point
where my legs could carry me,"
Peterson said. "At this point of the
season, I don't really want to throw
eight innings, but because of the cir
cumstances, I stayed in there. "
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
was impressed by the sophomore's
performance, especially against a
Titan lineup that features several

potent bats.
"It was a great outing and the
fact that they are a great offensive
team makes it even more impres
sive," Marquess said. "His fastball
was working well, it was live. That
was his dominant pitch, then in the
later innings, he went to the
change."
While Peterson frustrated the
Fullerton bats, the Cardinal offense
chipped away at starter Kirk Irvine
(0-1), scoring a run in the second
and two in the fourth before
Carter's two-run shot in the fifth.
"This was great for our pro
gram," Marquess said, referring to
the birth of night baseball at Stan
ford. "It was perfect. We had a great
crowd and two very good teams."
On Saturday, the Titans remind
ed the Cardinal of just how good of a
team they are. Fullerton made few
mistakes en route to a 7-0 blanking.
Stanford starter Jason Middlebrook
(1-1) looked strong through the first
three innings, giving up one run.
Hut the hard-throwing right-hander
soon lost control of his pitches, walk
ing the bases loaded in the fourth.
Relief pitcher Brendan Sullivan
replaced Middlebrook and was
greeted by a two-run single by Jere

my Giambi. A balk by Sullivan
allowed another Fullerton run to
score before 1995 Golden Spikes
Award winner Mark Kotsay singled
to right to plate another Titan run
ner. When the dust settled, Stan
ford found itself in a 5-0 hole.
Walks and free bases would
haunt the Cardinal all night, as six

Stanford pitchers combined for 10
free passes, five of which eventually
came around to score.
"You can't give a team that many
free bases, especially against a team
like this," Marquess said. "They're
going to take advantage of that and
they did. We were obviously hurt by
it."'

The inclement weather which
led to yesterday's cancellation will
also affect today's game against Cal
State-Los Angeles at Sunken Dia
mond. The original game time of 2
p.m. has been changed to 7 p.m.
The Cardinal will travel to Sacra
mento State for a 2 p.m. contest on
Tuesday.

soon lost control of his pitches, walk
ing the bases loaded in the fourth.
Relief pitcher Brendan Sullivan
replaced Middlebrook and was
greeted by a two-run single by Jere

my Giambi. A balk by Sullivan
allowed another Fullerton run to
score before 1995 Golden Spikes
Award winner Mark Kotsay singled
to right to plate another Titan run
ner. When the dust settled, Stan
ford found itself in a 5-0 hole.
Walks and free bases would
haunt the Cardinal all night, as six

Stanford pitchers combined for 10
free passes, five of which eventually
came around to score.
"You can't give a team that many
free bases, especially against a team
like this," Marquess said. "They're
going to take advantage of that and
they did. We were obviously hurt by
it."'

The inclement weather which
led to yesterday's cancellation will
also affect today's game against Cal
State-Los Angeles at Sunken Dia
mond. The original game time of 2
p.m. has been changed to 7 p.m.
The Cardinal will travel to Sacra
mento State for a 2 p.m. contest on
Tuesday.
