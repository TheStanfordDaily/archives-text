The fourth-ranked Stanford men's volley
ball team stormed into sunny San Diego to
continue Mountain Pacific Sports Federat ion
play against San Diego State and UC San
Diego on Friday and Saturday, respectively.
Primarily using their depth to pull them
through, the Stanford spikers downed both
schools, knocking off the Aztecs 13-15. 15-9,
15-10, 15-6 and sweeping the Tritons, 15-11,
15-5, 15-6. ,
Friday's match in San Diego State s 1 <'tor-
son Gym started ominously for the C ardinal.
On the strength of their jump serve.-,, the
Aztecs racked up live aces and opened an
early lead.
In addition, Cardinal sophomore swing
hitter Tad Hoffman and junior middle block
er Brian Moore struggled with their hitting,
resulting in eight first-game errors and hin
dering any chances of a comeback. As Stan
ford continued to pass poorly off of the jump
serve, the Aztecs methodically put them away
and took the one-game lead.

The second game produced more of the
same as the Aztecs jumped ahead 7-6. Then,
Cardinal head coach Ruben Nieves made a
key substitution, inserting junior swing hitter
Aaron Garcia for Hoffman.
"The team played better with Aaron and
that turned the match," Nieves said. "He has
been a stronger hitter and that allowed us to
run combination plays and also opened up
our offense."
With the improved hitting, the Cardinal
spikers closed out the game with a 9-2 run,
holding the \y.tccs to a .257 hitting percent
age.
The C.irdinal's momentum carried over to
the t bird game, helping the team jump out to
a 9-6 advantage. San Diego State's jump serv
ing became less effective as Stanford adjust
ed, forcing the Aztecs intoll errors.
The Aztecs, nevertheless, pulled within
one | joint before Nieves made another key
adjustment, substituting sophomore swing
hitter Devin Poolman for Moore, who had dis
located his finger on the previous play. The
substitution revitalized the team and Pool
man's serve-for-gamc gave the Cardinal the
point and a one-game lead.
Stanford waster) little time in disposing of
the Aztecs in game four. Moore, in a display of
toughness, put his finger back into place and
went out to contribute to a dominating effort
that saw Stanford convert 27 kills in only 38
attempts
"The fourth game wasn't much of a strug
gle," Nieves said. "1 didn't call a time-out.
Basically, we got ahead and stayed ahead."
The Cardinal was led by junior
opposite Matt Fuerbringer, who fin
ished the match with 24 kills in 38
attempts. Sophomore middle block
er Keenan Whitehurst chipped in
with 17 kills in 29 attempts, leaving

their opponent defenseless.
Despite the efforts of the Aztecs'
senior outside hitter Lars Winter
(24 kills) and sophomore outside
hitter Jason Rasmussen (15 kills),
Stanford was able to complete the
four-game victory and improve to 2-
0 in league play. San Diego State
was held to only a .235 hitting per
centage for the match, while Stan
ford hit at an efficient .454 clip.

"We contained [Winter and Ras
mussen], but it was more of a case of
doing a job on their third-, fourth
and fifth-best hitters," Nieves said.
"We also handled their serves a lot
better as the match went on."
The following night, the Cardi
nal took its road show to La Jolla to
face the cellar-dwelling Tritons.
Much like the Aztecs had done the
night before, UC-San Diego made a
struggle out of the first match.
Hoffman and Moore got off to
slow starts again and junior setter
Stewart Chong was having trouble
with set location. After a time-out
with Stanford clinging to a 10-9
lead, Chong picked up the slack in a
different area and pulled his team
through to victory. Chong's serving
befuddled the Tritons, pushmg the
lead to 13-9. UC-San Diego pulled to
13-11 before Chong took over again
and served for-game-point, giving
Stanford a one game lead.
The rest of the match involved
brutal domination by Stanford. The
key was Fuerbringer, who is recov
ering slowly but surely from shoul
der surgery. With the Cardinal lead
ing 6-5, he took over serve. By the
time he lost it, the score was 14-5.
"He was the brightest spot of the
weekend," Nieves said. "He hit the
ball a lot harder."
Fuerbringer kept racking up
points in the third game, allowing
the Cardinal to jump out to a 5-0
lead. Stanford never looked back
after that as it smothered UCSD's
offense, holding the Triton to a neg
ative hitting percentage for the
match. Stanford had 20 stuff
blocks, while UCSD managed only
four.
Four Triton players finished
with negative hitting percentages,
while five others registered a .000
hitting percentage. In all, Stanford
forced their opponents into 40
errors, while allowing them only 36
kills.
Despite the 3-0 start in league
play, coach Nieves remains cautious.
"As far as concentration and
level of play, we have a ways to go,"
Nieves said. "We'll have to play bet
ter to get two wins [next] weekend.
We need to continue to work on our
serve-receive. Matt Fuerbringer
was the best passer this weekend
and the other guys have got to be as
productive in their passing as
Matt."
Stanford's league play continues
this weekend at Burnham Pavilion
with matches against second
ranked Long Beach State on Friday
and sixth-ranked USC on Saturday.

our offense."
With the improved hitting, the Cardinal
spikers closed out the game with a 9-2 run,
holding the \y.tccs to a .257 hitting percent
age.
The C.irdinal's momentum carried over to
the t bird game, helping the team jump out to
a 9-6 advantage. San Diego State's jump serv
ing became less effective as Stanford adjust
ed, forcing the Aztecs intoll errors.
The Aztecs, nevertheless, pulled within
one | joint before Nieves made another key
adjustment, substituting sophomore swing
hitter Devin Poolman for Moore, who had dis
located his finger on the previous play. The
substitution revitalized the team and Pool
man's serve-for-gamc gave the Cardinal the
point and a one-game lead.
Stanford waster) little time in disposing of
the Aztecs in game four. Moore, in a display of
toughness, put his finger back into place and
went out to contribute to a dominating effort
that saw Stanford convert 27 kills in only 38
attempts
"The fourth game wasn't much of a strug
gle," Nieves said. "1 didn't call a time-out.
Basically, we got ahead and stayed ahead."
The Cardinal was led by junior
opposite Matt Fuerbringer, who fin
ished the match with 24 kills in 38
attempts. Sophomore middle block
er Keenan Whitehurst chipped in
with 17 kills in 29 attempts, leaving

their opponent defenseless.
Despite the efforts of the Aztecs'
senior outside hitter Lars Winter
(24 kills) and sophomore outside
hitter Jason Rasmussen (15 kills),
Stanford was able to complete the
four-game victory and improve to 2-
0 in league play. San Diego State
was held to only a .235 hitting per
centage for the match, while Stan
ford hit at an efficient .454 clip.

"We contained [Winter and Ras
mussen], but it was more of a case of
doing a job on their third-, fourth
and fifth-best hitters," Nieves said.
"We also handled their serves a lot
better as the match went on."
The following night, the Cardi
nal took its road show to La Jolla to
face the cellar-dwelling Tritons.
Much like the Aztecs had done the
night before, UC-San Diego made a
struggle out of the first match.
Hoffman and Moore got off to
slow starts again and junior setter
Stewart Chong was having trouble
with set location. After a time-out
with Stanford clinging to a 10-9
lead, Chong picked up the slack in a
different area and pulled his team
through to victory. Chong's serving
befuddled the Tritons, pushmg the
lead to 13-9. UC-San Diego pulled to
13-11 before Chong took over again
and served for-game-point, giving
Stanford a one game lead.
The rest of the match involved
brutal domination by Stanford. The
key was Fuerbringer, who is recov
ering slowly but surely from shoul
der surgery. With the Cardinal lead
ing 6-5, he took over serve. By the
time he lost it, the score was 14-5.
"He was the brightest spot of the
weekend," Nieves said. "He hit the
ball a lot harder."
Fuerbringer kept racking up
points in the third game, allowing
the Cardinal to jump out to a 5-0
lead. Stanford never looked back
after that as it smothered UCSD's
offense, holding the Triton to a neg
ative hitting percentage for the
match. Stanford had 20 stuff
blocks, while UCSD managed only
four.
Four Triton players finished
with negative hitting percentages,
while five others registered a .000
hitting percentage. In all, Stanford
forced their opponents into 40
errors, while allowing them only 36
kills.
Despite the 3-0 start in league
play, coach Nieves remains cautious.
"As far as concentration and
level of play, we have a ways to go,"
Nieves said. "We'll have to play bet
ter to get two wins [next] weekend.
We need to continue to work on our
serve-receive. Matt Fuerbringer
was the best passer this weekend
and the other guys have got to be as
productive in their passing as
Matt."
Stanford's league play continues
this weekend at Burnham Pavilion
with matches against second
ranked Long Beach State on Friday
and sixth-ranked USC on Saturday.
