The fourth-ranked Stanford men's volley
ball team stormed into sunny San Diego to
continue Mountain Pacific Sports Federat ion
play against San Diego State and UC San
Diego on Friday and Saturday, respectively.
Primarily using their depth to pull them
through, the Stanford spikers downed both
schools, knocking off the Aztecs 13-15. 15-9,
15-10, 15-6 and sweeping the Tritons, 15-11,
15-5, 15-6. ,
Friday's match in San Diego State s 1 <'tor-
son Gym started ominously for the C ardinal.
On the strength of their jump serve.-,, the
Aztecs racked up live aces and opened an
early lead.
In addition, Cardinal sophomore swing
hitter Tad Hoffman and junior middle block
er Brian Moore struggled with their hitting,
resulting in eight first-game errors and hin
dering any chances of a comeback. As Stan
ford continued to pass poorly off of the jump
serve, the Aztecs methodically put them away
and took the one-game lead.

The second game produced more of the
same as the Aztecs jumped ahead 7-6. Then,
Cardinal head coach Ruben Nieves made a
key substitution, inserting junior swing hitter
Aaron Garcia for Hoffman.
"The team played better with Aaron and
that turned the match," Nieves said. "He has
been a stronger hitter and that allowed us to
run combination plays and also opened up
our offense."
With the improved hitting, the Cardinal
spikers closed out the game with a 9-2 run,
holding the \y.tccs to a .257 hitting percent
age.
The C.irdinal's momentum carried over to
the t bird game, helping the team jump out to
a 9-6 advantage. San Diego State's jump serv
ing became less effective as Stanford adjust
ed, forcing the Aztecs intoll errors.
The Aztecs, nevertheless, pulled within
one | joint before Nieves made another key
adjustment, substituting sophomore swing
hitter Devin Poolman for Moore, who had dis
located his finger on the previous play. The
substitution revitalized the team and Pool
man's serve-for-gamc gave the Cardinal the
point and a one-game lead.
Stanford waster) little time in disposing of
the Aztecs in game four. Moore, in a display of
toughness, put his finger back into place and
went out to contribute to a dominating effort
that saw Stanford convert 27 kills in only 38
attempts
"The fourth game wasn't much of a strug
gle," Nieves said. "1 didn't call a time-out.
Basically, we got ahead and stayed ahead."
