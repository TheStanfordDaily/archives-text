### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
The man accused of committing a series of
rapes in the Peninsula area, Romel Reid,
pleaded not guilty Friday afternoon to 17
charges of rape, kidnapping, attempted rape,
sodomy, robbery and evading arrest.
Reid allegedly attacked nine women in
Santa Clara County between August and Jan
uary. He is being held in the Santa Clara Coun
ty Jail in lieu of $10 million bail.
Reid appeared calm and relaxed as his
court-appointed public defender, Stephen El
rick, entered the plea in the Santa Clara Coun
ty Municipal Court in San Jose. Reid turned

and smiled briefly during the short time he was
in the room.
"He seems fine â€” quiet, reserved," Elrick
told reporters at a press conference following
the court hearing. "We get along."
Elrick said the Palo Alto Police have addi
tional reports of evidence, and he will need to
examine these "new discoveries."
Elrick said he will formally ask the prose
cuting attorneys to share evidence with him in
a discovery court hearing on Friday. He re
fused to comment on any evidence.
"We've been looking at reports, but we don't
want it to be tried in the press," he said.
Reid, 25, of East Palo Alto, is also suspected
of two attacks in Menlo Park, which will be

tried in San Mateo County courts. Reid was ar
rested last month after a high-speed chase
through Los Altos and Palo Alto.
The white van which Reid allegedly used in
some of his attacks gave police their lead.
Reid, a 6-foot, 205-pound former high
school quarterback and Wal-Mart employee,
allegedly grabbed women who were walking or
jogging alone, often attacking victims by
throwing them to the ground or into his white
van.
"This is a case of considerable magnitude,"
Elrick said.
"We'll do whatever it takes," he said, adding
that it will likely be several months before
Reid's preliminary hearing.
