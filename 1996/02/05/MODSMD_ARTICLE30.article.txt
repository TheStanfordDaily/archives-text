## 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
This weekend the Stanford men's
swimming team headed south to face
an upset-minded USC team on Friday
and to deal with UC-Santa Barbara on
Saturday. After the USC- women upset
the top-ranked Stanford women a
week ago, the Trojan men hoped to
duplicate the feat of I heir female coun

terparts. It was not to be, however, as
the Cardinal men routed the Trojans
155-84.5.
"We went down to USC and knew
they'd be pumped," said sophomore
Scott Claypool. "But we went, in and
did what we !iad to do and really put
them in their place."
Stanford went into the USC-
McDonald Swim Stadium prepared for
their most challenging dual meet of

the year, hut after the Cardinal raced
away to nearly a four-second victory in
t he 400-meter medley relay and placed
first and second in the 1500 freestyle,
the Stanford men took off, piling victo
ry upon victory. USC did not manage a
win until the fifth event when Texas
transfer Brad Bridgewater took the
200 individual medley. The Trojans'
only other victory was a win by Bridge
water in the 200 backstroke.
"We knew they wore really getting
ready for us," Claypool said. "For us to
come in as usual and just slaughter
them certainly gave them a reality
check."
I SC did its share to make the dual
meet a spectacle, with the Trojan band
even playing a bad version of "All
Right Now." Unfortunately for Tro
jans, all of their emotional energy only
excited the Cardinal swimmers even
more.
"The atmosphere was definitely
geared for fast swimming," Claypool
said. " They played 'All Right Now' and
their band booed us. The atmosphere
was definitely helpful. There was a lot
of hoopla."
Freshman Blake Holden, who
dropped 2 1 2 seconds from his career
best time in a victory in the 200 breast
stroke, agreed that IJSC's excitement
helped to teed the Cardinal's energy.
"It got the meet off to a good start,"
he said. "It was something a little dif
ferent, a little more exciting. Even
