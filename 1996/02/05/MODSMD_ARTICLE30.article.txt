# Men swim to victory over USC, UCSB
## 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
This weekend the Stanford men's
swimming team headed south to face
an upset-minded USC team on Friday
and to deal with UC-Santa Barbara on
Saturday. After the USC- women upset
the top-ranked Stanford women a
week ago, the Trojan men hoped to
duplicate the feat of I heir female coun

terparts. It was not to be, however, as
the Cardinal men routed the Trojans
155-84.5.
"We went down to USC and knew
they'd be pumped," said sophomore
Scott Claypool. "But we went, in and
did what we !iad to do and really put
them in their place."
Stanford went into the USC-
McDonald Swim Stadium prepared for
their most challenging dual meet of

the year, hut after the Cardinal raced
away to nearly a four-second victory in
t he 400-meter medley relay and placed
first and second in the 1500 freestyle,
the Stanford men took off, piling victo
ry upon victory. USC did not manage a
win until the fifth event when Texas
transfer Brad Bridgewater took the
200 individual medley. The Trojans'
only other victory was a win by Bridge
water in the 200 backstroke.
"We knew they wore really getting
ready for us," Claypool said. "For us to
come in as usual and just slaughter
them certainly gave them a reality
check."
I SC did its share to make the dual
meet a spectacle, with the Trojan band
even playing a bad version of "All
Right Now." Unfortunately for Tro
jans, all of their emotional energy only
excited the Cardinal swimmers even
more.
"The atmosphere was definitely
geared for fast swimming," Claypool
said. " They played 'All Right Now' and
their band booed us. The atmosphere
was definitely helpful. There was a lot
of hoopla."
Freshman Blake Holden, who
dropped 2 1 2 seconds from his career
best time in a victory in the 200 breast
stroke, agreed that IJSC's excitement
helped to teed the Cardinal's energy.
"It got the meet off to a good start,"
he said. "It was something a little dif
ferent, a little more exciting. Even

though it was for them, we could
still play off their excitement."
After the initial fanfare and
the Cardinal's quick start, the
meet turned into a series of well
fought races in which the Cardi
nal kept finishing on top.
"The score might not be that
close," Holden said, "but there
were a lot of good races. Going
into it we knew it would be a chal
lenge. We know we would have to
swim fast and we did. We all got
up and swam really tough."
Saturday's meet against the
Banana Slugs might have been a
little bit of a letdown after the
excitement against the Trojans
the day before, but the Cardinal
managed to swim as consistently
as ever, getting the job done with
a 174-120 victory.
"It was cloudy, windy and
rainy," Claypool said. "It was
pretty much horrible. But it was
also good mental preparation.

Things aren't always going to go
your way, but you still have to
swim hard."
The weather certainly didn't
go the Cardinal's way, as most of
the swimmers spent the time
between their races in the warm
up pool. When the time for their
race did arrive, many of them
simply ducked under the dividers,
swam over and only emerged
from the water long enough to get
on the starting blocks.
Despite the environmental fac
tors, the Cardinal focused on
business as usual and won every
event but one.
"Everything considered, we
got the job done," Holden said.
The Cardinal returns from the
road trip feeling that it is on the
right track to finish the season
strong and compete for the
national championship in March.
The Cardinal's next opportunity
to demonstrate its preparation is
Feb. 17 against California at
Stanford's deGuerre Pool.
"The team is definitely where
we need to be," Claypool said.
"We showed that we will be con

tenders at NCAAs."
Stanford winners on Friday
included junior Kevin Radvany in
the 1500 freestyle, senior Scott
Gagner in the 200 freestyle, Clay
pool in the 50 freestyle, senior Ray
Carey in the 200 butterfly, junior
Scott Jones in the 100 freestyle,
freshman Matt O'Mara in the 400
freestyle, Holden in the 200 breast
stroke and senior David Johns,
who continued his successful div
ing season with a double victory in
one- and three-meter diving.
Saturday's Cardinal victors
included sophomore Tom Wilkens
in the 400 individual medley,
junior Matt Martin in the 100
back, sophomore Sabir Muham
mad in the 100 butterfly and the
100 free, Radvany in the 1000
free, Claypool in the 200 free,
sophomore Chris Olson in the 50
free, junior Phil Trinidad in the
200 individual medley, Carey in
the 200 fly, freshman Tate Blah
nik in the 200 back, Jones in the
400 free, Holden in the 200 breast
and Johns, once again with a dou
ble victory in the one- and three
meter diving.
