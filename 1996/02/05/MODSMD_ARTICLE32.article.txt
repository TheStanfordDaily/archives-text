# SHS chief warns managed care will result in 'dire consequences'
## Health care facing drastic changes 
### Adam Kemezis Contributing writer 
Dire consequences may result from the ex
pansion of managed health care, said Peter Van
Etten, chief executive officer of Stanford Health
Services in a speech Saturday.
Van Etten spoke on "Market-Based Health
Care: A View F rom the Trenches" as part of a day
long forum titled "Ethical Issues in the New Busi
ness of Medicine." The forum also included a
speech by Business Prof. Alain Enthoven and sev
eral workshops on subjects related to health care.
The crowd that packed Fairchild Auditorium
responded enthusiastically to Van Etten's dis
cussion of the health care crisis and managed
care's contributions to that crisis.
V.ui Etten, who became CEO of SHS in 1994,
noted that the crisis in health care costs is being
blamed for many political and economic prob
lems.
In his opinion, however, the opposite is true
" liather than itself being the creator of politi
cal crises," Van Etten said, "the current medical
crisis is the result of deep-seated changes taking
place in our society."
The marked change in the health care system
that Van Etten cited was the growth of large for
profit managed care companies replacing non

profit organizations. In 1985 there were 15
health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in
California, most of them non-profit. By 1995
these HMOs had consolidated down to five, all
hut one for-profit, he said
Van Etten also discussed what he called the
"law of health care karma."
"For every change in financing there is an
often unexpected reaction," he said.
Following this rule, he listed eight unexpect
ed consequences of the growth of market-based
health care, including "adverse selection," when
companies illegally ask potential customers
health questions in order to recruit healthy pa
tients and leave costlier ones to Medicare and
Medicaid.
Also on his list were threats to inner-city pub
lic hospitals that treat indigent and uninsured
patients. These hospitals are losing managed
care patients to private hospitals that do not
have to bear the costs of treating the uninsured.
In addition, "health care's core values" and
important aspects of the patient-doctor relation
ship are being altered by disease management
techniques involving collaboration between
drug companies and HMOs, Van Etten said.
Van Etten made four predictions about the
future of health care. The first was that the de
gree of consolidation now apparent in California

HMOs will not become a national trend. Finan
cial markets will not continue to value HMO
stocks as much as they have, he continued.
Another prediction was that there would be
rising public sentiment against for-profit health
managers. Managed care already has received
unfavorable reviews in Time and Newsweek
magazines recently, he said.
I IMOs fail to respond to the traditional health
care demands of the United States, Van Etten
said. Americans are looking for choice of physi
cian and the right to expensive, risky procedures
that sometimes save lives, but are not approved
by the cost-benefit analyses done by HMOs, he
said.
His hist prediction was that managed care
would not significantly slow the growth of med
ical costs because research and development are
the underlying causes of the rise and those caus
es are not addressed by managed care.
Managed or market-based solutions are not
the answer to the health care crisis, Van Etten
said, instead offering his own idea.
"I suggest that the chaos that presently exists
will continue until the public becomes sufficient
ly outraged that a fundamental restructuring of
the health delivery system by either the state or
the federal government becomes politically ac
ceptable," he said.
