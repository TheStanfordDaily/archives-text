# Body image explored
## 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
A week for examining body
image issues kicks off at Stan
ford today, as part of the nation
al Eating Disorders Week.
Body Image Awareness
Week, organized by several stu
dents, is intended to raise
awareness in the community
about issues of body image, food
and self esteem.
"Traditionally, these prob
lems have been surrounded by
issues of shame," said senior
Sara Polgar, one of the week's
organizers. "However, the prob
lem is becoming less and less
taboo and needs to be ad
dressed."
Although Body Image
Awareness Week has been at
Stanford in the past, the pro
gram's organizers changed the
format this year to focus on
dorm-based programs, rather
than campus-wide events.
"We sent e-mail to several
(resident assistants] on cam
pus encouraging them to hold
programs," said senior Megan
Curran, the organizer of a stu
dent panel in Rinconada tomor
row. "We wanted students to
get personal connections to the
issue."

The event, which runs
through Friday, is designed to
address topics which go beyond
the traditional eating disorder
stereotypes. In focusing the
week on body image rather than
eating disorders, organizers
hope students will realize just
how many students are affected.
"When people usually think
of an eating disorder, they think
of a 70-pound anorexic woman
in a hospital," said Curran.
"However, eating and body
image fall on a bell scale. There
are extremes but most people
fall in the middle."
In addition to dorm pro
grams, the week's organizers
encouraged RAs to rent several
movies dealing with body image,
which are on reserve in Meyer
Library.
Organizers hope some of the
themes from the week will con
tinue through to an Eating Dis
orders Self-Assessment pro
gram, planned for March 7 in
the Toyon Lounge.
The program, part of a na
tional eating disorders screening
program, will focus on identify
ing the nature of an individual's
problem. Following the pro
gram, students will be able to fill
out surveys regarding the issue
and talk to trained specialists.
