# Shoven replies to CSAAS demands
## Student leaders accept dean's call for further discussion on ethnic studies 
### Shoshana Deutschkron Contributing writer 
Dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven declined to respond
to the demands of a group of Asian-Amer
ican students who are concerned about a
proposed ethnic studies program.
Instead, Shoven met the group's Fri
day response deadline by calling for more
discussions between students and admin
istrators.
In a note to the Concerned Students for
Asian American Studies, Shoven ac
knowledged receipt of the group's de
mands, assured them that their concerns
are being reviewed and asked for their
commitment to further consider the is
sues which have been raised.
Earlier last week, CSAAS sent a memo
to Shoven demanding that Asian-Ameri
can students and faculty have a larger say
in hiring and decision making for the Com
parative Studies in Race and Ethnicity

program; that selected Asian-American
Studies faculty teach half their classes in
Asian-American Studies; that Shoven hire
a senior Asian-American Studies professor

by the end of the next
school year; that tenure
decision for professors in
Asian-American Studies
be based on qualifications
in the field; and t hat posi
tions be advertised specif
ically as openings for
Asian-American Studies
scholars.
CSRE is a proposed
interdisciplinary pro-

Shoven

gram that would allow students to con
centrate in Ashm-American Studies, Chi
cano Studies, African and Afro-American
Studies or a cross-cultural theme.
CSAAS threatened to initiate a nation
wide boycott if Shoven failed to commit in
writing to their demands bv the Friday
deadline.

Although the note, according to
Shoven, "did not get into discussing each
of CSAAS' demands," both Shoven and
the students seemed content to remain in
a state of further negotiations. No defini
tive decisions concerning the student's de
mands are foreseen for at least a week.
Freshman Jane Kim, a representative
of CSAAS, said the group "wanted ac
knowledgment of the demands and will be
willing to negotiate. On both parts, by
Shoven and by us, there will be a lot more
to say next week."
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo, head of the
executive committee in charge of imple
mentation of the CSRE program, said
that the committee has already held one
"preliminary discussion" concerning the
demands and has another meeting sched
uled tomorrow. Following the meeting,
Camarillo will approach Shoven with the
committee's advice and recommenda-


Shoven
tions.
Camarillo said, "The committee
will look at all of the demands one
by one."

Despite the "temporarily choppy
waters," Shoven said he is "trying
to emphasize long-run optimism
about this program. Stanford has
the opportunity to build something
unique and exciting," he said.
Shoven said he hopes the note "will
be taken as a willingness to work with
[ CSAAS) so we can move forward."
