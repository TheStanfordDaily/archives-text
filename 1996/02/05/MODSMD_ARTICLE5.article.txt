Supporters of Byron Sher gathered
Friday night to give the Stanford law
professor a worthy send-off to his battle
for a seat in the California State Assem
bly.
Byron, an emeritus law professor and
16-year veteran of the state Assembly,
will challenge republican Patrick Shan
non in a special election March 26. Shan
non is a former adviser to Gov. Pete Wil
son.
At Friday's fund-raiser in Palo Alto,
Sher stressed the importance of getting
people to the polls for this early election,
noting that the Senate majority could be
determined by only a few votes.
Democrats currently hold a 21-19
edge in the Senate, giving them the vot
ing power. Without a Sher victory, the
republicans would hold the governor's
office and both houses of the legislature
for at least seven months.
"Our challenge is to turn out the vote,

to reach the independents and republi
cans who voted for me in the past," Sher
told the crowd at the Hyatt Rickeys
hotel. "There are certain swing voters
that are going to make a difference."

'Byron is someone totally
concerned with public
policy. He really doesn't
care for self-promotion.'

According to Sher, the "new republi
can majority of the Assembly has been
an embarrassment to all of us." By get
ting elected to the Senate, Sher said he
hopes to be able to stop the republican
backed bills.
About 100 people attended the fund
raiser, and they showered the 38-year
old Stanford professor with praise.
In an introduction by Rep. Anna
Eshoo, D-Calif., Sher was described as a

"gentleman and a scholar" and "one of
the finest legislators of all."
"We are really ailing without good
people standing with us," Eshoo said,
pointing at Sher before his turn to speak.
Eshoo noted that Sher has been an in
valuable asset in the fight for Califor
nia's environment, authoring some of
the state's landmark environmental
laws including the California Clean Air
Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act.
Palo Alto City Councilman Joe Simit
ian, who as an undergraduate at Col
orado College in 1973 interviewed Sher
for a term paper on public policy, said he
believes Sher to be among a handful of
genuine politicians left.
"Byron is someone totally concerned
with public policy," Simitian said. "He re
ally doesn't care for self-promotion."
Also attending the dinner was ASSU
Deputy Senate Chair and Stanford De
mocrats Co-Chair Bill Shen, who
pledged his support to Sher and offered
