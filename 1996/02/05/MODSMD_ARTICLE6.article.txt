# Side by side
## Siblings together on the Farm 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
The Ing sisters don't live in each
other's shadows — they live in each
other's reflections. Juniors Laura and
Elena Ing, just one of many pairs of sib
lings at Stanford, are twins.
Laura remembered one of the many in
cidents of mistaken identify.
"One of my friends, Hui Nguyen, saw
Elena walking around campus. He took a
poster out of her back-pack and hit her
over the head," Laura laughed. "He real
ized his mistake when she turned
around."
Elena added, "No ever says 'hi' to me

first. They wait for me to speak."
At first glance, the two sisters might
seem alike in ways other than appearance.
They are both majoring in electrical engi
neering and are both going to Japan this
spring. However, independence best char
acterizes their relationship and their expe
riences both at home and at Stanford.
Elena said, "We might talk more, or e
mail each other more if we both went to
other colleges."
Though two big Stanford acceptance
envelopes arrived on the same day, neither
Elena nor Laura was influenced by the
other's decision to apply and attend the

University.
"We were both surprised,"
Elena said.
Laura and Elena took different
routes to Stanford. They attended
separate high schools, one public,
the other private. When both sis
ters were accepted to Stanford,
they were the subject of an article
in the Honolulu Advertiser, on the
subject of the public-private educa
tion debate occurring in Hawaii at
the time.
"Our schools were a different
experience," Elena said. "But we
both got here."
The sisters talked about the
benefits and drawbacks of having a
sibling at Stanford.
"The best things are being able
to go to Costco and buying big bot
tles of detergent and splitting it,"

Laura said. "And when you fly
home, you don't have to sit next to
someone weird."
The only problem is that "you
have to give so much money to one
school," Laura said.
Elena stressed the equality of
their relationship.
"Maybe if a sibling was older,
they'd look after you," Elena said.
"We both came in at the same
time."
Junior Chris Daley and fresh
man Bryan Daley might disagree
with that statement. The brothers
try to avoid any sibling power dy
namics.
"I had a rough quarter. I wasn't
sure what to expect," said Chris.
"Bryan was a great help to me, re
ally supportive. At first, it was
hard for me to accept, since he was
younger. I'm glad he's here."
Their relationship has im
proved since they both started at
tending Stanford.
"We don't fight about curfews,

who gets the car, who's getting
treated more fairly," Bryan said.
"There are no parents to make us
fight."
The brothers spend a lot of time
together and share many of the
same tastes, Bryan said, which
may lead to certain erroneous, al
beit humorous, assumptions.
"This freshman asked if Bryan
and I were dating," Chris said. "I
told him, 'Seeing as he's my broth
er and he's straight, no.' "
Bryan stressed that they inde
pendently chose to start dying
their hair and to pierce their ears.
Though both have naturally
brown hair, Chris currently sports
black hair, a la Smashing Pump
kins, whereas Bryan bleached his
hair blond.
However, both brothers agreed
that they enjoy having each other
for support and understanding.
"It's different from a close
friend. We have a common point of
reference. I can be mean to him,

and he'll still be my brother,"
Chris said.
Bryan said, "I trust him.
There's nothing he doesn't know."
Freshman Kevin Friedman and
senior Katie Friedman also have a
shared understanding, which
comes from the cardinal red blood
that runs through their veins.
Their parents met while attending
Stanford Law School. From then
on, the Farm has always been a
home away from home.
Katie said her parents didn't
need to pressure her to apply to
Stanford. "I loved the whole feel of
Stanford — mellow, well-rounded.
. . so much so that I'm co-terming
next year in English."
Kevin laughed, "You told me it
was to hang out with your bro." He
added, "We help each other, com
plement each other."
Their relationship has evolved
over the years, as both have de
fined their own identity.
In high school, Kevin said, "I

tried out a lot of things my sister
did, but then I started doing my
own thing, like mathematics and
water polo. I wasn't rebellingjust
to rebel. I'm my own person
now."
These days, "Kevin under
stands the context now, and can re
late directly to my experiences,"
Katie said. "We know each other
well."
Last quarter, Katie and Kevin
took Economics 1 together.
"I think it was my mom's great
est fantasy when she called while
we were doing a problem set to
gether," Katie said.
Indeed, after Katie's freshman
year, Mrs. Friedman told her,
"You might not want to sell your
CIV books. Kevin might need
them," Katie said.
In fact, Kevin is taking his sis
ter's CIV track. "I like using her
books. Even if I don't read, the
books are already highlighted," he
said.

At another freshman experi
ence, "Faces of the Community,"
Kevin had the opportunity to see
Katie speak on the Holocaust and
their family.
"All my friends told me what a
good speaker my sister was,"
Kevin said. "I was proud of her."
Katie recounted another event
they both attended.
"When Oliver Stone came to
speak, I asked him a question,"
Katie said. "My friend told me that
a really cute guy gave a wolf-whis
tle. Later, when I was telling Kevin
about it, he said, 'That was me.' "
Both Katie and Kevin agree
that having their siblings around
has enhanced their Stanford expe
rience.
"I get such a kick seeing him
around, even though he loves to go
around telling people that he's my
older brother," Katie said.
Kevin said, "I would have come
to Stanford anyway. My sister's an
added bonus."

Indeed, after Katie's freshman
year, Mrs. Friedman told her,
"You might not want to sell your
CIV books. Kevin might need
them," Katie said.
In fact, Kevin is taking his sis
ter's CIV track. "I like using her
books. Even if I don't read, the
books are already highlighted," he
said.

At another freshman experi
ence, "Faces of the Community,"
Kevin had the opportunity to see
Katie speak on the Holocaust and
their family.
"All my friends told me what a
good speaker my sister was,"
Kevin said. "I was proud of her."
Katie recounted another event
they both attended.
"When Oliver Stone came to
speak, I asked him a question,"
Katie said. "My friend told me that
a really cute guy gave a wolf-whis
tle. Later, when I was telling Kevin
about it, he said, 'That was me.' "
Both Katie and Kevin agree
that having their siblings around
has enhanced their Stanford expe
rience.
"I get such a kick seeing him
around, even though he loves to go
around telling people that he's my
older brother," Katie said.
Kevin said, "I would have come
to Stanford anyway. My sister's an
added bonus."
The Ing sisters don't live in each
other's shadows — they live in each
other's reflections. Juniors Laura and
Elena Ing, just one of many pairs of sib
lings at Stanford, are twins.
Laura remembered one of the many in
cidents of mistaken identify.
"One of my friends, Hui Nguyen, saw
Elena walking around campus. He took a
poster out of her back-pack and hit her
over the head," Laura laughed. "He real
ized his mistake when she turned
around."
Elena added, "No ever says 'hi' to me

first. They wait for me to speak."
At first glance, the two sisters might
seem alike in ways other than appearance.
They are both majoring in electrical engi
neering and are both going to Japan this
spring. However, independence best char
acterizes their relationship and their expe
riences both at home and at Stanford.
Elena said, "We might talk more, or e
mail each other more if we both went to
other colleges."
Though two big Stanford acceptance
envelopes arrived on the same day, neither
Elena nor Laura was influenced by the
other's decision to apply and attend the

University.
"We were both surprised,"
Elena said.
Laura and Elena took different
routes to Stanford. They attended
separate high schools, one public,
the other private. When both sis
ters were accepted to Stanford,
they were the subject of an article
in the Honolulu Advertiser, on the
subject of the public-private educa
tion debate occurring in Hawaii at
the time.
"Our schools were a different
experience," Elena said. "But we
both got here."
The sisters talked about the
benefits and drawbacks of having a
sibling at Stanford.
"The best things are being able
to go to Costco and buying big bot
tles of detergent and splitting it,"

Laura said. "And when you fly
home, you don't have to sit next to
someone weird."
The only problem is that "you
have to give so much money to one
school," Laura said.
Elena stressed the equality of
their relationship.
"Maybe if a sibling was older,
they'd look after you," Elena said.
"We both came in at the same
time."
Junior Chris Daley and fresh
man Bryan Daley might disagree
with that statement. The brothers
try to avoid any sibling power dy
namics.
"I had a rough quarter. I wasn't
sure what to expect," said Chris.
"Bryan was a great help to me, re
ally supportive. At first, it was
hard for me to accept, since he was
younger. I'm glad he's here."
Their relationship has im
proved since they both started at
tending Stanford.
"We don't fight about curfews,

who gets the car, who's getting
treated more fairly," Bryan said.
"There are no parents to make us
fight."
The brothers spend a lot of time
together and share many of the
same tastes, Bryan said, which
may lead to certain erroneous, al
beit humorous, assumptions.
"This freshman asked if Bryan
and I were dating," Chris said. "I
told him, 'Seeing as he's my broth
er and he's straight, no.' "
Bryan stressed that they inde
pendently chose to start dying
their hair and to pierce their ears.
Though both have naturally
brown hair, Chris currently sports
black hair, a la Smashing Pump
kins, whereas Bryan bleached his
hair blond.
However, both brothers agreed
that they enjoy having each other
for support and understanding.
"It's different from a close
friend. We have a common point of
reference. I can be mean to him,

and he'll still be my brother,"
Chris said.
Bryan said, "I trust him.
There's nothing he doesn't know."
Freshman Kevin Friedman and
senior Katie Friedman also have a
shared understanding, which
comes from the cardinal red blood
that runs through their veins.
Their parents met while attending
Stanford Law School. From then
on, the Farm has always been a
home away from home.
Katie said her parents didn't
need to pressure her to apply to
Stanford. "I loved the whole feel of
Stanford — mellow, well-rounded.
. . so much so that I'm co-terming
next year in English."
Kevin laughed, "You told me it
was to hang out with your bro." He
added, "We help each other, com
plement each other."
Their relationship has evolved
over the years, as both have de
fined their own identity.
In high school, Kevin said, "I

tried out a lot of things my sister
did, but then I started doing my
own thing, like mathematics and
water polo. I wasn't rebellingjust
to rebel. I'm my own person
now."
These days, "Kevin under
stands the context now, and can re
late directly to my experiences,"
Katie said. "We know each other
well."
Last quarter, Katie and Kevin
took Economics 1 together.
"I think it was my mom's great
est fantasy when she called while
we were doing a problem set to
gether," Katie said.
Indeed, after Katie's freshman
year, Mrs. Friedman told her,
"You might not want to sell your
CIV books. Kevin might need
them," Katie said.

ter's CIV track. "I like using her
