Quick — what's the name of the chart used by as
tronomers to measure a star's brightness against its
size?
The Stanford College Bowl team knew it was a
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, in addition to many
other questions en route to winning the Brigham
Young Invitational Tournament this weekend in
Provo, Utah.
Stanford compiled a 9-1 record, beating both
teams from UC-Berkeley.
The team consisted of freshman Brad Harris,
sophomore Rachel Kolman Marshak, and graduate
students Roger Lee and Sherman Lo.
The tournament used the American College Fed
eration format, in which teams answer 20 "toss-up
questions." For each successfully answered toss-up
question, the team earned a chance for extra points
in a bonus question.
The questions are academic in nature, and, ac
cording to Harris, "quite difficult."
The Stanford team was confident of its ability
to succeed in Provo. "We felt really good going
into the tournament because we were usingone of
our best combinations," said Harris. "We were
the top four scorers in our last tournament, but
since we didn't use our 'stacked' line-up, we were
on different teams. This time, we used our best
line-up."
Despite the strength of the Stanford squad,

the victory was hard fought. "We had a lot of
close games, and, on overall performance, I
think Cal might have played better," said Lo.
"But we won the crucial games, so we won the
tournament."
The Stanford team views this victory as an oppor
tunity to build for success in the future. "It was good
to get a win with the two regional tournaments
ahead. It's good to get confidence and some momen
tum going," said Lo.
Next up is the Cardinal Classic, a tournament
hosted by Stanford in two weeks. "We'll probably not
field our best team, but this gives us a chance to raise
some funds and see what the other teams are like,"
said Lo. Teams are required to pay a fee to attend the
tournament.
Following the Cardinal Classic is the College Bowl
Incorporated regional tournament held in Santa
Clara, in which Stanford will compete against teams
from California, Nevada and Hawaii.
Team members expect another hard fought battle
with archrival UC-Berkeley. A victory in the region
al would allow Stanford to advance to the national
tournament in Arizona
As College Bowl has two governing bodies, there is
also a second set of regional and national competi
tions in which the Stanford team will compete later
this year.
The Stanford team is optimistic about its
prospects in the near future. "I think we really
worked well together, and I hope we get a change to
play again together," Harris said.
