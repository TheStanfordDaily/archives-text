# Clinton called to testify before jury
## 
### 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -
President Clinton was ordered
yesterday to testify at next
month's Whitewater trial for
James and Susan McDougal, his
partners in a failed northern
Arkansas land deal.
A lawyer for Susan McDougal,
whose ex-husband James ran the
failed Madison Guaranty Savings
and Loan, said last week that only
Clinton could offer testimony that
would clear his client.
Susan McDougal is accused of
receiving a $300,000 loan that a
former Little Rock banker and
municipal judge, David Hale, says
Clinton pressured him to make.
Clinton, who has not been
charged, has denied the accusa
tion.
The McDougals and Gov. Jim
Guy Tucker, who had other busi
ness dealings with the McDougals,
face trial March 4 on conspiracy
and fraud charges. Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr says the
three concocted $3 million in loans
from federally hacked lenders to
benefit themselves illegally.
If Clinton were to testify, he
would become only the second sit
ting president to give testimony in
a criminal proceeding. President
Reagan's videotaped deposition

was played at John Poindexter's
Iran-Contra trial but Reagan did
not appear in person and was not
cross-examined.
If Clinton appears in person as
Susan McDougal's lawyer wants,
he would be subject to cross-exam
ination by Starr, who was appoint
ed to investigate Clinton's land
deal and campaign finances.
Prosecutors would be allowed
to introduce evidence or testimo
ny to challenge the president's
veracity.
The appearance would also
afford Clinton an opportunity to
confront under oath the single
most serious allegation made
against him — that he pressured
Hale to make an improper federal
ly backed loan to Susan McDougal
in 1986.
Clinton has called the allega
tions "a bunch of bull" and said he
doesn't ever recall talking to Hale
about money.
U.S. District Judge George
Howard Jr.'s order directed court
officials to issue a subpoena for
the president on behalf of both
McDougals.
The judge directed the
McDougals' lawyers to proceed in
a manner that is not disruptive to
the president's ability to do his

job, perhaps using videotape or
satellite.
Jennifer Horan, another lawyer
for Susan McDougal, said the sub
poena was still being prepared yes
terday afternoon. Horan said she
would submit the subpoena to the
clerk of the court for signing today.
Once the subpoena is signed, the
president would be served.
"We have not talked to the
president or his representative
about this," Horan said.
"It's never a welcome thing for
a sitting president to be served a
subpoena," Horan added. "I don't
expect President Clinton would in
any way hold it against us.
There's no one else besides the
president."
In asking for the subpoena,
Susan McDougal's lawyers cited
Reagan's testimony, a subpoena
for President Nixon's audio tapes
during the Watergate scandal and
a recent federal appeals court deci
sion allowing Paula Corbin Jones'
sexual harassment lawsuit
against Clinton to proceed. The
Bth U.S. District, Court of Appeals
ruled a president could be sued for
his unofficial acts.
Lawyer Bobby McDaniel filed
documents last week asking for
the subpoena, saying the presi

dent's testimony was vital to
Susan McDougal's defense.
"Susan McDougal's liberty is at
stake. It's our position that the
Constitution affords her the full
level of protection and we're going
ask for that," McDaniel said at the
time.
McDaniel, the lead lawyer for
Susan McDougal, said he wants
the president to testify in person,
rather than by satellite hookup.
Testifying in person "is the best
way to evaluate the credibility of
the witness," said McDaniel.
The McDougals and Tucker
were named in a 21-count indict
ment handed up last August, alleg
ing that transactions they made
through McDougal's savings and
loan and Hale's Capital Manage
ment Services were designed to
defraud federal regulators.
Pour of the counts against the
McDougals relate specifically to
the $300,000 loan made to Susan
McDougal in 1986 by Hale.
McDaniel said Clinton's testi
mony could contradict Hale's
assertions about the loan to Susan
McDougal and possibly other
assertions Hale might make at the
trial. "Hale is going to testify in
person and the president should
too," McDaniel said.
