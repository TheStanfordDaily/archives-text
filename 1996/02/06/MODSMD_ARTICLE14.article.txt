## Athlete denies killing his ex-wife and her friend, suggests that police planted evidence

LOS ANGELES (AP) - In a surprise TV
interview yesterday, a combative O.J. Simp
son telephoned a panel of lawyers on CNN and
submitted to his most extensive public ques
tioning about the murders of his ex-wife and
her friend.
"I did not commit these crimes," he said in
an hourlong call to the program "Burden of
Proof." "And it took all of my life savings, vir
tually, to prove that, and it shouldn't be that
way."
With exasperation in his voice, Simpson
denied he degraded or repeatedly abused
Nicole Brown Simpson, played down a "Dear
John" call from a girlfriend the morning of the

murders, expressed suspicions the killings
wore linked to the drug problems of one of
Nicole Simpson's friends and suggested police
planted evidence.
Simpson also said for the first time that he
armed himself two days after the June 12,
1994, murders of Nicole Simpson and Ronald
Goldman for his own protection. He later
pointed the gun at himself as he rode in A 1
"A.C." Cowlings' Bronco the day of the
slowspeed chase.
"I had a woman killed. I had a guy, Kato
Kaelin, at the time telling me about noises at
my house. When I left my house Tuesday
(June 14) I had the tain with me. . . . And at

that time I wasn't thinking about suicide or
anything," Simpson said.
In the interview, Simpson went from calm
to combative, and sometimes joked. He often
responded to questions by reciting an 800-
number for purchase of his mail-order video.
Many of Simpson's remarks echoed those
made in five days of sworn testimony in a
deposition for a wrongful-death lawsuit filed
against him by the victims' families.
"His lawyers have to be dying a thousand
deaths," said Loyola University law professor
Laurie Levenson. "Although he seems to do all
right, he launches off into topics that could
provide information for the other side."
