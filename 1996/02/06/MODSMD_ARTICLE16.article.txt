ASSU Senate needs to
change the way it acts
in order to earn respect

IT SEEMS THAT every year
around election time the ASSU
Senate jettisons whatever limit
ed potential it has for cooperation
and effective leadership in favor of
political gamesmanship. Once again,
election-related controversy has
enveloped the Senate, further mar
ring what little respect and reputa
tion this body can lay claim to.
At last week's Senate meeting,
chaos erupted during the considera
tion of a bill supposedly authored by
two non-partisan ASSU staffers:
Elections Commissioner Ryan Med
ders and Hearings Officer Solomon
Lefler. Most of the bill was intended
to update outdated election by-laws
— and most of it was written by
these two gentlemen.
However, buried within this seem
ingly rudimentary bill was a section
that dealt with reforming campaign
finance rules, a section written by
the current Senate Chair, Alane
Murdock and, oddly enough, last
year's Senate Chair, Nawwar Kas
rawi (who is not a current student
and thus not a member of the Asso
ciation).
Hoping the Senate would rubber
stamp these "reforms" without dis
cussion or debate because they were
penned by neutral outsiders, the two
true authors kept their names off the
bill, trying to preserve the sense that
the bill did nothing more than bring
procedural election rules up-to-date.
Seeing through this ruse, and act
ing in a responsible and commend
able manner, both the Elections
Commissioner and the Hearings
Officer, when introducing the bill,
announced that they were removing
the section dealing with campaign
finance reform. They correctly
argued that it was not their role to
spearhead legislation on such an
issue and that doing so would com

promise their neutrality.
At this point, there were, at best,
some poor judgment calls and, at
worst, some severe ethical breeches.
Senate Chair Murdock, one of the
two anonymous authors of the con
troversial section, refused to let Med
ders and Lefler strike the section —
a completely illegal action on her
part and an abuse of power.
Heated discussions immediately
ensued. The Senate Chair, realizing
her ruse was called, stepped down as
chair in order to lobby her fellow sen
ators to keep her portion of the bill.
Two senators walked out of the ses
sion in protest. A third tried to fol
low, but another senator and a Coun
cil of Presidents member blocked the
exits to the room — technically com
mitting the crime of false imprison
ment.
Such behavior is deplorable. A
Senate Chair should strive to be seen
as a neutral, knowledgeable and fair
enforcer of the rules. Instead of mas
terminding sneaky subterfuge, our
student representatives should con
cern themselves with doing the right
thing.
Wouldn't it be nice if the Senate
members acted their ages? Wouldn't
it be nice if instead of hidden maneu
vers, manipulation and biased rul
ings, issues were openly raised, open
ly discussed and openly voted upon?
It's no surprise that many students
have little faith in their supposed
representatives — it's not clear if the
"representatives" deserve any.
Unfortunately, the Senate lacks a
true sense of accountability — it only
reaches out to students during elec
tions and there's no judicial branch
to oversee the Senate's actions.
If the status quo of petty politick
ing remains, the Senate will contin
ue to be irrelevant in the eyes of most
students. Students who agree with
this sentiment should let their voices
be heard and give the Senate a piece
of their minds — an e-mail to assu
senate@lists will be forwarded to all
senators. Perhaps the senators are
simply unaware of the amount of
antipathy felt toward them. Perhaps
if students make them aware, we
will, in fact, see a change.
