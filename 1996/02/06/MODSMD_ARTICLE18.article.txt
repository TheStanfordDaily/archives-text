CHINKS SUCK.
These two words
were scrawled
more than once in black
permanent marker on
the table displaying the
Korean-American jour
nal Reflections in the
Asian American Activi
ties Center. I noticed

them two weeks ago after a classmate
pointed them out to me. I wasn't sur
prised to see blatant racist remarks
scrawled at an educational institution as
esteemed as Stanford. Although I wasn't
surprised, I am still saddened by the state
of racism in this country. Hate is as
strong as ever.
Tony Small wrote last week in The
Daily that Asian Americans were "once
oppressed" and then "overcame" it. His
column in itself proves otherwise. Asian
Americans are still oppressed by stereo
types and messages in this country. You
are passive. You are hardworking. You
are a math whiz, master violinist and
black belt. Your women are sexual con
quests and your men are sexually inade
quate. You are weak and without voice
and, therefore, without power.
That is the model minority. The per

fect minority. This is an idea that exists
in the minds of all Americans and Asian
Americans. People of color are often dealt
a card, an expectation of what they are to
become. Categorization is a form of con
trol stemming from fear in this country.
You fear what you don't understand.
Chinks suck.
People often wonder why I am fighting
for Asian-American Studies. It is exactly
because this hate and fear exists. Many
students graduate, still unaware of the
sweat and blood of Asians running deep
in the building of America. Shiploads of
Asian bodies were sent home in the
1800s, killed while building our railroads.
Many others sweat in plantation fields
and menial work, barely making enough
to eat. Asians were seen as expendable
humans, as were many other people of
color, made to do the dirty work of mak
ing this country "great."
Asian Americans have a long and valu
able story that has been ignored and
marginalized in our educational system.
Lack of understanding of our story and
culture has forced harmful stereotypes to
exist as they do. Sentiments of wild-eyed
"Japs" taking over the world, "yellow
monkeys, go home," pretty China dolls
and "strangers from a different shore"

must end. Our voice must be expressed
among others. Asian-American Studies
would not be necessary if we were consid
ered valuable and integral parts of the
society at large. Hate and fear stem from
this ignorance and makes our struggle
even more pertinent.
There is a poster in Muwekma-Tah-
Ruk of the American flag. Underneath
the (lag is a statement: "Make something
of it." The fight for Asian-American
Studies is an attempt to make something
more of this University, not an attack on
it. It is important that we, as Asian Amer
icans, no longer allow ourselves to be
taken for granted and exploited in gov
ernment and judicial systems that do not
believe racism exists — or at least make
the public believe that racism does not
exist. We can no longer think that we can
achieve acceptance because we don't riot,
don't make waves, don't protest, in order
to be considered more "American." We
don't see that we've described ourselves
as a race of the mute, blind, deaf — the
perfect minority.
Let's make something of it.
