UCAA co-chair finds criticism unwarranted

lAM WRITING in response to a letter
The Daily published on Feb. 2, in
which Racy Ming criticized the
Undergraduate Chinese American Asso
ciation.
In her letter, she described a series of
four e-mails which we had exchanged. I
believe her reaction to our correspon
dences and her conclusions about the
UCAA were completely unwarranted. E
mail is a weak form of communication
and misinterpretation is possible. In her
e-mails, she said she would like to orga
nize an altar of offerings to ancestors for
the eve of the New Year. I replied that I
was unfamiliar with the tradition and
that the UCAA was planning to focus on
just the New Year celebration.
After a little research, I found that

lighting incense to honor one's ancestors
is indeed a custom practiced in Chinese
households. Although I come from a tra
ditional Chinese family, it is not a cus
tom that we practice since there are
many different ways to observe the New
Year. An altar of offerings to one's
ancestors is more of a personal, private
activity, not usually performed in the
company of many other people. UCAA is
choosing to celebrate with traditions
which a larger group of people can enjoy.
If she was a bit disappointed that we
did not immediately embrace her ideas,
perhaps she would have been less dis
pleased if she were aware of all the fac
tors that are taken into consideration
when planning large events. These
events are huge projects that need to be

planned weeks in advance. By the time I
received her first e-mail, the planning
for our Chinese New Year celebration
had already been underway for three
weeks. Nonetheless, I discussed the pos
sibility of setting up an altar on Chinese
New Year's Eve with my co-chair. Only
when we got an offer to collaborate on
another event did we decide to concen
trate solely on the event on which we
had already been working.
Addressing the criticisms of UCAA as
a whole, I do not feel that it is by any
means a "clique." All meetings and
events are open to the entire Stanford
community. We publicize through e-mail
and fliers. Anyone can subscribe to our
mailing list and our fliers are posted in
every dorm and public area throughout

campus. The corps has always worked
hard to encourage attendance and par
ticipation. The ASSU Program Board
would not have decided to fund our Chi
nese New Year celebration if they
thought it would cater to only a narrow
and exclusive circle of people.
Ming's harsh criticisms and judg
ments of UCAA were premature since
her contact with the organization was so
limited. They would seem less unfound
ed had she attended our meetings or
events. As such, I would like to invite
her and everyone to join us and share
what we have to offer.
