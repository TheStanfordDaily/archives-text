# Campbell ranks first in survey
## Party politics may have played hand in placement 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
A recent survey on California state
legislators ranked Stanford law profes
sors Tom Campbell and Byron Sher
first and 19th respectively in their
overall effectiveness. But evidence sug
gests that partisan politics may have
affected survey results.
Annually, the California Journal
surveys several hundred lobbyists, leg
islators, journalists and staff members
on their opinions of the California
State Senate and Assembly. The rank
ings are called the "Minnies" in tribute
to the goddess Minerva who appears on
the state seal. Categories include prob
lem-solving ability, intelligence, in
tegrity, energy, potential and effective
ness.
Campbell, a Republican from Stan
ford, left his state Senate seat in De
cember after election to the U.S. House
of Representatives. Of the 40 members

of the state Senate, Campbell ranked
first overall, as well as first in problem
solving, potential, intelligence and in
tegrity; second in energy; and fourth in
effectiveness.
On the other hand, Sher, an emeri
tus professor of law, did not perform as
well in the state Assembly rankings.
Among the? 9 members of the lower
house, Sher placed 19th overall, as well
as 18th in problem solving, 32nd in po
tential, sixth in intelligence, 22nd in in
tegrity, 40th in energy and 20th in ef
fectiveness.
"They still rank me high in intelli
gence and I am thankful for that," Sher
said. Sher is currently seeking to fill
the position vacated by Campbell in the
state Senate.
"Frankly I never fill them out,"
Sher said, commenting on the signifi
cance of the rankings, but he acknowl
edged that, "Everybody's interested in
them. In this country we're so much
into competition. It's not a scientific

poll; it's totally self
generated as the edi
tors will point out. "
Sher alluded to an
article published in

The Sacramento Bee that criticized the
rankings as being skewed due to the
mass of votes from Republican staff
members who were encouraged to par
ticipate in the survey.
"Obviously I would like to be high in
the rankings, but it is only a guide to
how the people who responded regard
you, and as The Bee suggests there may
be some loading," he said.
One indication of an imbalance is
the disparity of the rankings of the
staff as compared to the rankings of the
lobbyists. For example, lobbyists
ranked Sher eighth overall whereas the
staff ranked him 32nd.
"I think that they felt that would be
useful to them for campaigning," Sher


Campbell
said, speculating on why others
would desire to affect the out
comes.
Assembly wo man Dede Alport,
D-San Diego, is also currently in
volved in u Senate race. Her rank
ing of 23rd by staff members
stands in sharp contrast to the 7th
rank she received from lobbyists.

In the past few years, rankings
from the outsiders and the insid
ers have been roughly equiva
lent.
When asked about his low
rankings, Sher said, "Everyone
has to be the judge of (their valid
ity). In years past I have always
ranked highly.
"I feel very comfortable about
my integrity and think most peo
ple that I know agree with me," he
said. "My record test ifies to my ef
fectiveness; I have been the au

thor of many important pieces of
legislation." Sher was the author
of the California Clean Air Act
and the Safe Drinking Water Act.
Although filling Campbell's
shoes may not prove to be the
easiest task, Sher expressed con
fidence in his ability to represent
diverse communities. His cur
rent constituency includes cities
such as East Palo Alto and Ather
ton. Issues such as public educa
tion are constant throughout
communities, he said.
