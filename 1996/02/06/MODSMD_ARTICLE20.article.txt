# Lawyer upset with Leland's account of Liberty Bowl losses
## 
### 
I read with disbelief Athletic Direc
tor Ted Leland's accounting for the
income and expenses related to Stan
ford's losing appearance in the Liberty
Bowl. If Stanford lost money, he could
have admitted it and explained that
this loss in Tennessee was a charac
ter-building exercise and enhanced
Stanford's national image. His dissim
ulation was on par with the Stanford
explanation for charging the Federal

government for items unrelated to the
cost of the programs they were subsi
dizing.
As Sgt. Friday said, "Just give us
the facts." Some of us alumni are
tired of the baloney that is being pro
duced on the Farm.
