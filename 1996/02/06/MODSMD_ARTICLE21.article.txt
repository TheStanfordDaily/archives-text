# Body Image Awareness Week is front-page news
## 
### 
After scanning yesterday's Daily, it
struck me as kind of strange that a
substantial portion of the front page

was devoted to "Siblings Together on
the Farm." The article was heartwarm
ing and entertaining, but it led me to
assume that there weren't more press
ing issues going on around campus
that were worthy of front-page news.
Then I saw the little box — "Body
Image Awareness Week begins today.
News, back page." Hack page! Anyone
who glances in the full-length mirror
before class or the dining hall during
dinner would know this topic is in dire
need of further address and publicity
here at Stanford.
In this "kingdom of thin" that our
society has become, the less education
people receive about body image and
eating disorders, the more likely they

will be to shrug off the issue. The
Daily should realize that because of its
widespread audience, it has the power
and responsibility to inform the stu
dent body of programs and events that
might otherwise go unnoticed, espe
cially by those who could benefit from
them most.
The way we look at and feel about
ourselves is a very private concern;
however, the Stanford community is
just that — a community — and we
owe it to each other to take that rela
tionship seriously. There is an obvious
need for help here. Let's not wait until
it becomes a piercing cry.
