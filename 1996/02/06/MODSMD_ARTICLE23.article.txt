Actually, the Twins' Paradox was first
proposed by scientists trying to disprove
Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's based
on two principles of the Theory of Rela
tivity.
The first principle is that time slows
down as you move faster. The second
principle is that there are no asymmetric
differences between two different inertial
frames of reference.
So what the heck does that mean?
tackle the second principle first.
Before Einstein proposed his Theory of
Relativity, most physicists were pretty
happy dealing with what we call Newtoni
an physics. Newtonian physics is the kind
of stuff most people learned in high school.
You remember — Newton's laws of

motion, gravity and so forth. Newtonian
physics describes the observable world
around us, from falling apples to falling
pennies. Though the equations describing
the world in Newtonian terms are pretty
simple, they can get pretty messy at times.
The good thing, though, is that these
equations can be simplified when we look
at them in an inertial frame of reference.
This means that Newton's Laws apply in
exactly the same way when we look at
things while moving at a constant speed
in a constant direction.
For example, pretend you are in an air
plane, moving along at a nice cruising speed
at a nice cruising altitude, eating your nice,
complimentary peanuts which the flight
attendant gave to you. As you gently toss
the peanuts into your mouth, it's nice to see
that the peanuts act exactly the same as if
you were standing on the ground tossing
them into you mouth. Yet a person stand
ing on the ground would see you and the
peanuts moving at a few hundred miles per
hour. Even if it's honey-roasted, a peanut
traveling at 500 miles per hour is not all
that nice.
Peanuts aside, the point here is that

you really can't tell the difference
between different frames of reference
which move at constant speed. Sitting in
the airplane, it looks to you like the
peanut-watcher on the ground is moving
at 500 miles per hour, but he would say
that it was you that was moving at 500
miles per hour. In relativistic physics, the
same is true — you can't tell the differ
ence between inertial frames. In fact, rel
ativity goes on to say that if you can't tell
the difference between two frames of ref
erence, then they are equivalent.
The other principle of relativity
involved in the Twins' Paradox is that
time slows down as you go faster. More
specifically, it says that if you are observ
ing an object moving at speeds close to the
speed of light, time seems to move slower
for that object. So, if a space traveler were
to move at 99 percent the speed of light
and return to earth in 30 years, to him,
the journey would seem to have taken
only four years. Hopefully, someone
walked and fed the dog while he was gone.
The Twins' Paradox is based on a sup
posed conflict between these two princi
ples. Imagine a pair of twins, one on earth

and another traveling away from the
earth at close to the speed of light. The
traveling twin then turns around and
comes back to earth. According to Ein
stein, less time has passed for the travel
ing twin than for the stationary twin.
But now, look at it from the point of
view of the traveling twin. He also sees
the other twin depart at a very high speed
and then return. The Twins' Paradox
says that from both twins' point of view,
the other twin should be younger when
they meet the second time.
Lucky for Einstein, the problem with
the paradox is that the traveling twin is
not in a reference frame equivalent to the
stationary twin. That is, at some point
during his journey, the traveling twin
turns around to come back to earth.
Therefore, the traveling twin does not
move at a constant speed. The traveling
twin will feel some kind of acceleration
due to turning around — there is a dif
ference between their two frames of ref
erence.
Another variation on the Twins' Paradox
is even more confusing, believe it or not.
Suppose that the traveling twin doesn't

turn around to come back. Now, both twins
are in equivalent reference frames, and both
see the other twin traveling away at a very
fast speed. Which one is older?
According to Special Relativity, the
question makes no sense. You can't com
pare the ages of the twins unless they are
in the same place. This is because time
and space are closely related in relativity,
so you cannot compare the amount of
time that has passed between the two
twins without considering the space and
relative speeds between them. This
means both twins are right when they
say that time has slowed down for the
other twin.
Of course, it's probably easier just to
ignore the whole thing. The entire situa
tion is almost as confusing as watching
Special Agent Cooper dream about a
backwards-talking midget.
