Fresno SI, 2
Stanford 6
Minnesota 1

It wasn't easy, but the No. 1
Stanford men's tennis team
extended its nation's-best win
streak to 31 matches over the
weekend.
On Friday afternoon, the Car
dinal knocked off 13th-ranked
Fresno State 5-2. The next day
they came out strong again to
defeat 23rd-ranked Minnesota 6-1.
While the Cardinal won con
vincingly on Friday, it looked a
little shaky in the early going.
Stanford dropped all three dou
bles matches to the Bulldogs to
begin the afternoon.
"I was very disappointed in
our doubles," said head coach
Dick Gould. "We didn't execute
well and we were slow to adjust.
We've got a lot of work to do."
Already down one point after
poor doubles play, Stanford also
got off to a slow start in the sin
gles competition. At one point,

four Cardinal players were down
in their matches. But senior cap
tain Jeff Salzenstein wasn't
overly concerned.
"We definitely needed to turn
it around," he said. "But I know
the character of this team. Most
of us have played in tight match
es and I knew we would figure
out a way to win. I was never too
worried about our chances."
Gould was not surprised that
Fresno State came out so strong.
"They are a really solid team,"
he said. "They've got two top-ten
players in IFrederik] Bergh and
[Frederik] Giers [who played first
and second singles, respectively].
They're a team that can beat you
if you're shaky. But they are also
a team we should beat."
The Cardinal did turn it
around, winning all but one sin
gles match for the 5-2 victory.
Salzenstein, sophomore Paul
Goldstein and senior Ricky Becker
beat their opponents in straight
sets. It took senior Jim Thomas
and junior Grant Elliott three sets
to oust their opposition.
Freshman Ryan Wolters suf
fered the only loss on the day, a
three-setter to Giers, 6-4, 4-6, 6-
4. After dropping the first set,
Wolters battled back to win the
second and had a lead in the
third until he cut his left index
finger on the net-post. The injury
prevented him from hitting his
usual two-handed backhand stroke.
"That cut really got to me, both
mentally and physically," Wolters
said. "It was a tough match to
lose, but the more I think about it,
the more I realize that I can't win
every match. The important thing
is that the team won."
Wolters was able to bounce
back the next day against Min
nesota. After dropping the first
set, he came back to win the next

two relatively easily, 2-6, 6-2, 6-1.
"I have to give Ryan an awful lot
of credit," Gould said. "His confi
dence was shaken (after the Fresno
State loss]. He really impressed me
with his ability to keep plugging
away. He showed me a lot about
him as a competitor."
Becker also needed three sets
to win his match, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3.
"That was classic Becker tennis
out there," Wolters said. "We call
him 'The Doctor,' because he slices,
dices and carves up his opponents
like a surgeon. Today Ricky picked
on his opposition's weaknesses and
won a very close match."
Thomas and Elliott won their
respective matches in straight sets.

"The two matches I played were
definitely a step in the right direc
tion for me," Elliott said. "I just
need to keep improving."
Goldstein won his match at
third singles in three sets, 7-5, 4-
6, 6-2.
"Paul looked very sharp on
Friday [against the Bulldogs],"
Gould said. "He didn't play quite
as well against Minnesota, but he
is showing me a lot of things. His
improvement is really going to
help the team out."
Up next for the Cardinal is San
Jose State. The top-ranked Stan
ford team will look to extend its
winning streak to 32 at 1:30 p.m.
this afternoon.
