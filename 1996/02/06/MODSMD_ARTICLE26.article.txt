# Winter Olympics?
## Male gym stars invade Winter Cup 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
Many of Stanford's past and
present male gymnasts made a
strong showing this weekend in
Colorado at the Winter Cup
national gymnastics competition,
bringing home two spots on the
U.S. National Team, including a
first-place finish by 1994 gradu
ate Jair Lynch.
Lynch, previously ranked third
nationally, came away from the
competition with a first-place
ranking and an automatic berth
to the American Cup in March.
He scored a combined 110.52 in
compulsory and optional all
around events. A total of 36 gym
nasts competed in the event.
A second position on the U.S.
National Team went to fifth-year
senior Josh Stein, who placed sev
enth overall with a score of
109.34.
"[I did] not do as well as I
hoped as far as my actual perfor
mance," Stein said, "but I ended
up placing pretty well overall, and
I am pleased with that."
The Winter Cup serves as a
national re-ranking, a precursor
to Olympics Trials and the deter
minant for membership on the
U.S. National Team.
A position on the U.S. National
Team offers the 14 gymnasts who
qualify an opportunity for
increased recognition by the
national and international gym
nastics communities and for pos

sible funding. Additionally, the
National Team is the pool of appli
cants from which international
competitors are selected. Team
membership, however, does not
ensure a gymnast an automatic
berth to the Olympics this sum
mer.
Sophomore Tim Dalrymple, in
his first national competition,
narrowly missed qualifying for
the National Team by less than
one-tenth of a point at 106.34.
Shadowing Dalrymple's 15th
place showing, 1995 graduate
Mark Booth pulled in at 16th
with a combined score of 106.3.
Booth came into the competi
tion ranked ninth nationally, but
missed several routines and was
hit hard by an adjustment in
judging requirements. According
to Booth, many athletes were not
well informed of the changes.
"[Theadjustments] took [their]
toll on me particularly hard," he
said. "Although this event was a
little bit disheartening, it will be a
motivational factor for me."
Junior Jamie Ellis placed 18th
with a score of 105.14 while
junior Keith Wiley finished 19th
with a 105.12. Graduate Kyle
Asano rounded out the Stanford
delegation with a 104.36 for a
22nd-place finish.
Despite the high rankings, the
gymnasts felt that they did not
perform as well as they could
have. Even Lynch did not turn in
