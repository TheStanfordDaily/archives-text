Mother Nature was the big
winner this weekend in women's
tennis competition at Stanford.

The third-ranked Cardinal was
scheduled to face the University of
San Diego in dual-match competi
tion Sunday, but the rain inter
vened and forced a cancellation.
The weather also managed to

shorten Saturday's match against
San Diego State. The doubles
matches were eliminated from the
contest after a 2 1/2 hour delay at
the start of the match to allow the
courts to dry.
Once the players took the
courts, it was the Stanford team
and not the rain that dominated.
The Cardinal swept all six match
es, extending its perfect dual
match record to 4-0 and proving
that the elements and the Aztecs
were no match for them.
Senior Kim Shasby marked her
recovery from a pulled muscle with
a straight-set victory over SDSU
freshman Sarah Donovan. Shasby
looked strong in her first match in
two weeks, earning an easy victory
over Donovan 6-2, 6-2.
In other competition, sopho
more Julie Scott continued to
obliterate the opposition. Scott
has won every match she has
played since winning the Pacific
10 Indoor Championships. She
faced SDSU's Tamara Bridges
and won in a rout, 6-0, 6-0.
At the No. 1 spot, sophomore
Ania Bleszynski took control of
the match early, playing well
despite the tedious delay. She
took the first set over Christy
Propstra 6-0, but fell behind in
the first game of the second set.
Bleszynski was down 2-3 before
breaking back at 4-4 in the eighth
game of the set. From there, she
went on to win the next two
games for a 6-4, straight-set victo
ry over Propstra.
Head coach Frank Brennan
was pleased with the effort his
team displayed and felt they
responded well to the delay in the
match.
"They did a good job of getting
up [after the delay J," Brennan
said. "It's hard to sit around and
wait for the courts to dry."


Sarah Harrigan â€” Daily file
Sandra De Silva slices a backhand against Washington earlier this year. De Silva and her teammates
beat SDSU on Saturday.
Unfortunately for the Aztecs,
the rain only delayed the
inevitable Cardinal victory. The
closest match of the competition
came at the No. 3 singles posi
tion. Junior Sandra De Silva
took on Merete Lindahl and won
the first set with ease 6-3. De
Silva was cruising early in the
second, but Lindahl fought back
to take a 4-3 lead. The set
appeared to be on the verge of
entering a tie break with De
Silva serving at 6-5. Down 30-40,
De Silva won three straight
points to win game, set, and
match 6-3, 7-5.
In the other two matches of the
afternoon, junior Katie Schluke
bir and senior Amy Chiminello
prevailed over SDSU's No. 2
Emma Dovle and No. 6 Simone
Howard respectively. Schlukebir
polished off Doyle effortlessly 6-2,
6-0, while Chiminello crushed
Howard 6-0, 6-1.
Up next for the Cardinal are
the Bulldogs of Fresno State.
Weather permitting, that match
will take place today at 1:30 p.m.
The Bulldogs defeated San Diego
State in a match earlier this sea
son and are expected to bring
tougher competition to the
courts.
