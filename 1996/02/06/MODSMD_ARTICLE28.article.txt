I Stanford 6
|CalStateLA 2

It wasn't pretty, but Stanford
baseball head coach Mark Mar
quess and his squad chalked up a
win last night in front of 255
faithful fans at Sunken Diamond.
The second-ranked Cardinal
(4-2) downed Cal State-Los Ange
les 6-2 in a game which featured
nine errors — seven by the Gold
en Eagles (1-4). Stanford benefit
ed from the numerous miscues,
plating three unearned runs.
For Cal State-L.A., it was a
long day, as the Golden Eagles
needed 11 innings to defeat San
Jose State 8-3 this afternoon
before busing north to Sunken
Diamond for the 7 p.m. start.
Cardinal freshman Jeff Austin
(1-0) threw six innings and picked
up the win in his first collegiate
start. The right-hander gave up
one earned run on a solo home

run by Golden Eagles left fielder
Jay Gibbons in the top of the
sixth. Austin allowed just one hit
while striking out 11 and walking
two. Last week in Hawaii, Austin
tossed four scoreless innings in
relief, recording eight strikeouts.
"My fastball was good in the
first inning, and I kind of found
my curve midway through the

first," Austin said. "I just stuck
with those two through the sixth
inning."
Although Cal State-L.A. hit
him hard in the sixth, picking up
the home run and sending two
other fly balls deep into the night
sky, Austin said he was feeling
strong throughout his outing.
"I'm nowhere near midseason

form yet, but it's nice to have that
feeling of strength, even when
you come out," Austin said.
Having pitched both in relief
and in a starting role this year,
Austin simply looks to pitch con
sistently and keep the Cardinal in
every game.

Cale Carter hits a line drive against Cal State-Fullerton on Friday. The Cardinal beat Cal State-Los Ange
les last night at Sunken Diamond.
"I'll do whatever is best for the
team, whatever helps us win," he
said. "My confidence is in the
team."
Marquess expressed pleasure in
Austin's first effort as a starting
pitcher for Stanford.
"He's got a great curveball and
enough of a fastball to really keep
you honest," Marquess said. "This
was another good outing for him,
he's done that twice now. He got
his first collegiate win tonight and
I was very pleased with that."
Marquess also praised the other
two Cardinal hurler; who saw
work, Torn Reimers. and J.D.
Brammer. The two right-handers
combined for three scoreless
innings, totaling five strikeouts
and no walks. Reimers pitched the
seventh and eighth innings before
giving way to Brammer, who
retired the side in the ninth to
close out the game.
Although the Cardinal was
never threatened by the Golden
Eagles, scoring two runs in the
first before posting single tallies in
the third, fourth, fifth and sixth
innings, the Stanford batsmen
were frustrated with their hitting
with runners in scoring position.
Senior second baseman Brian
Dallimore, who collected one hit

and one RBI on the night,
expressed displeasure in the Cardi
nal's play.
"We just didn't play very well,"
Dallimore said. "But anytime you
get out of a ballgame with a win,
you're always happy. That's essen
tially the one thing you play for —
to win. We've got a lot of improve
ments to make all over the place,
but mostly offensively. We've got
to start scoring when we've got
guys on base."
Dallimore's disappointment
stemmed from the game's result in
light of the quality of competition
Stanford faced on the field.
"For the competition we'll face
later in the season, this wasn't that
good," Dallimore continued,
"We've got to be able to put big
numbers up against a team like
(Cal State-L.A.). We had a lot of
guys on base, but we didn't get hits
in the key spots. To be successful
later on against g(X)d teams, that's
what is going to make or break us
— coming through in the big spots.
Stanford's meeting with Sacra
mento State, originally slated for
tomorrow, has been moved to
Wednesday at 2 p.m. in the state's
capital. Marquess will send anoth
er freshman right-hander to the
hill, as Chad Hutchinson will make
his first start in a Cardinal uni
form. Hutchinson pitched one
inning of scoreless relief in Stan
ford's 5-0 victory over Cal State-
Fullerton last Friday.
