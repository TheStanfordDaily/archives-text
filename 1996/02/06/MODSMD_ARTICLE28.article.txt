It wasn't pretty, but Stanford
baseball head coach Mark Mar
quess and his squad chalked up a
win last night in front of 255
faithful fans at Sunken Diamond.
The second-ranked Cardinal
(4-2) downed Cal State-Los Ange
les 6-2 in a game which featured
nine errors — seven by the Gold
en Eagles (1-4). Stanford benefit
ed from the numerous miscues,
plating three unearned runs.
For Cal State-L.A., it was a
long day, as the Golden Eagles
needed 11 innings to defeat San
Jose State 8-3 this afternoon
before busing north to Sunken
Diamond for the 7 p.m. start.
Cardinal freshman Jeff Austin
(1-0) threw six innings and picked
up the win in his first collegiate
start. The right-hander gave up
one earned run on a solo home

run by Golden Eagles left fielder
Jay Gibbons in the top of the
sixth. Austin allowed just one hit
while striking out 11 and walking
two. Last week in Hawaii, Austin
tossed four scoreless innings in
relief, recording eight strikeouts.
"My fastball was good in the
first inning, and I kind of found
my curve midway through the

first," Austin said. "I just stuck
with those two through the sixth
inning."
Although Cal State-L.A. hit
him hard in the sixth, picking up
the home run and sending two
other fly balls deep into the night
sky, Austin said he was feeling
strong throughout his outing.
"I'm nowhere near midseason

form yet, but it's nice to have that
feeling of strength, even when
you come out," Austin said.
Having pitched both in relief
and in a starting role this year,
Austin simply looks to pitch con
sistently and keep the Cardinal in
every game.
