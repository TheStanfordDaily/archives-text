The resurgent Cardinal
wrestling team continued to
improve this past weekend,
pummeling Cal State-Fullerton
26-15 on Friday and placing
fourth in the California Invita

tional on Saturday.
Stanford, despite forfeiting
the 118-pound weight class, won
an impressive seven of nine
matches Friday at Burnham
Pavilion, including five major vic
tories (by eight points or more).
"We beat them badly. We did
really well out there and I am
really proud of the team," said
senior Matt Cano, who started the
Cardinal's rout at the 126-pound
weight division.
Cano opened the meet by beat

ing Titan Orlando Decastroveroe
9-3, a victory Cano earned in
strong fashion.
"I felt I wrestled a solid, smart
match against fDecastroveroel,"
Cano said. "He is a tough wrestler
who gave me a tough match."
Stanford continued to roll over
the Titans with victories from
seniors Jimmy Aguirre, who
scored a whopping 18-6 victory in
the 134-pound weight class, and
Tod Surmon, who remained
undefeated at 150-pounds by dis

missing Carl Sharamitaro 9-1.
Adding to the total team effort
were sophomore Jeff Grant, who
defeated Fullerton's Steve Duran
10-2, senior Mark Ryzewicz, who
beat Jon Dyreyes 8-6 in overtime,
and junior Bryan Vaniman who
topped Tim Renick 11-1.
"We just did a great job out
there," said assistant coach Jay
Jackson, who was acting as head
coach for the absent Chris Horpel.
"Scoring five major victories is
hard to do â€” we wrestled phe
nomenally."
Perhaps the most important
victory for Stanford came in the
167-pound weight class. Senior
Sahlan Martin earned the win in
his first match since a neck injury
sidelined him in late December.
Martin's return not only provided
the squad with a physical pres
ence in his weight class, but it also
seemed to uplift the team's spirits
as well.
"It was really good to see | Mar
tini back out there," Cano said.
The decisive victory against
Fullerton gave the Cardinal some
much needed momentum and
confidence going into Saturday's
invitational in San Francisco. It
would not be enough to launch
Stanford to the top, though, as
sickness and injury caught up
with the Cardinal.


The Cardinal wrestling team had a firm hold on Cal State-Fullerton, as the grapplers routed the Titans,
26-15.
With Vaniman, Aguirre, and
both heavyweights, sophomores
Mark Neglay and Chris Serjak,
out due to physical problems,
the Cardinal still finished a
respectable fourth, behind Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, Cal State-
Fullerton, and the invitational
champion, Fresno State.
Martin and Surmon carried
the grapplers to their fourth

place finish. Each won their
respective weight classes. Cano
added to the Cardinal point total
with a second-place finish, as did
Grant who took a fourth place,
and Ryewicz, who placed third in
his weight class.
"We had a lot of sickness and
injuries," Jackson said. "But the
guys we brought did a great job."
Cano was quick to add that if
his injured teammates had been
able to wrestle, the tournament
outcome would have been differ
ent.
"To be honest," he said, "if

those guys had been there, we
would have won the whole tour
nament."
Next up for the Cardinal is an
away match against Oregon. The
Feb. 11 matchup will be a diffi
cult test for Stanford, but Jack
son tries to keep it in perspec
tive.
"I do think we have a really
good chance of winning the
meet," Jackson said. "But it's
just a tune up for the Pac-10's,
that's all. Nothing else matters
until the end of the season tour
naments."
