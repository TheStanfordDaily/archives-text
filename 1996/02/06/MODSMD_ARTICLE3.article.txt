The U. S. Department of Edu
cation has approved a five-year,
$12.5 million grant to the Univer
sity to establish a center for re
search on improving post-sec
ondary education.
However, budget considera
tions in Congress may delay the
disbursement of the funds.
The Stanford center will re
search such issues as the organiza
tion of post-secondary institu
tions, transitions between school
and work, patterns of participa

tion in higher learning and accred
itation policies, according to Scott
Fleming, Department of Educa
tion director for congressional af
fairs.
Research will also address the
development of a "theory relating
environmental demands (in the
economy and society) and post
secondary organizational adapta
tions," Fleming said in a state
ment.
The center will seek to "im
prove the match between educa
tion and employer demands" as
well as to study the advantages of
alternative educational patterns,
such as the benefits of interspers
ing college with work or of attend
ing several institutions for a de
gree, he Fleming said.
The program will be conducted
in collaboration with University of
Pennsylvania and University of
Michigan. The Office of Education
Research and Innovation selected
Stanford after reviewing the ap
plications of six competing candi
dates.

Patricia Gumport, director of
the Stanford Institute for Higher
Education Research, will become
the center'B executive director.
"We are happy to make the an
nouncement," said Lewis Roth,
assistant to Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-
Calif. "This is another tribute to
the outstanding work done at
Stanford University."
According to Michael Carr at
the Department of Education's
Office of Legislation and Congres
sional Affairs, the funding is af
fected by the current "battle for
appropriations dollars."
Only $800,000 — less than one
third of the annual grant amount
— has been made available. The
Department of Education is cur

rently operating under a continu
ing resolution — a temporary
measure designed only to prevent
a government shutdown — which
is due to expire in March.
The ongoing Congressional
budget negotiations may impact
the grant, which is subject to
availability of appropriations. The
Post-secondary Education Office,
the Department of Education's
largest segment, is a possible tar
get for funding reductions.
Carr declined to predict the
specific impact of budget negotia
tions on Stanford's grant. Both
limited and full funding are possi
ble, he said, and the issue may not
be fully settled until the Novem
ber elections.
