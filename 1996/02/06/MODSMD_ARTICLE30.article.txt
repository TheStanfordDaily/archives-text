# Seahawks to L.A.?
## 
### 
In his last column as sports
editor last Tuesday, Dan
Kao informed our loyal
readership that he had — and I
quote — ''rediscovered the true
meaning of sports." Apparent
ly, while playing mud football at
halftime of the Super Bowl and
watching Nike's "This Week in
Pee Wee Football" commer
cials, Mr. Kao experienced an
epiphany.

Well, I'm glad that my prede
cessor was able to recapture
such a bright outlook on the
world of sports in the last week
of his term as editor, but I'm
afraid I can't spout such opti
mism in my first week on the
job. You see, last Thursday one
of the worst catastrophes known
to mankind struck my home
town of Los Angeles.
An earthquake, you ask?

Riot, perhaps? Fire? Flood??
Try Seahawks — as in Seattle.
That's right, for those of you who
haven't yet heard, late last week
— just a few days after Magic
Johnson set the city afire with his
return to pro basketball (you did
hear about that one, didn't you?)
— Seattle Seahawk owner Ken
Behring made public his plans to
pack up the team's bags and head
south for the City of Angels.
It was bad enough last season
when the Raiders and Rams
bolted for Oakland and St.
Louis, respectively, leaving the
nation's second-largest city with
no professional football team to
speak of. At least Southern Cali
fornia football fans had USC's
Rose Bowl-winning season and a
solid year at UCLA to tide them
over.
But the Seahawks? I think
most football fans in L.A. would
rather stick with no team than
root for the 'Hawks. I never
thought I'd hear myself say this,
but I think I'm starting to miss
the Rams. How many people in
I>os Angeles are so desperate for
gridiron action that they'd actu
ally show up at the Rose Bowl to
cheer on a second-rate perennial
loser like the Seahawks?


Bobby
Cuza
But such are the travails of relo
cation. Next year the NFL could be
proud home to the Nashville Oilers,
Baltimore Browns and, presum
ably, the L.A. Seahawks. If you ask
me, the scene of musical chairs cur
rently taking place in pro football is
just the latest reminder of every
thing that's gone bad with profes
sional sports.
It started with the introduction
of Astroturf in the late '60s. Next
came the designated hitter. Then
unrestricted free agency, sports
agents, signing bonuses, realign
ment. The Toronto Raptors' uni
forms. And now, the Seahawks in
LA
Unfortunately, pro sports is no
longer about sports — it's about
profit. Greedy owners will stop at
nothing to make a buck, even if it
means leaving town and a loyal, sup

portive fan base. Self-interested
pkivers prostitute themselves to the
highest bidder. Agents and sponsors
control the game. How can fans be
expected to cheer on their home
town teams when their favorite
players — or the teams themselves,
for that matter — don't stick around
more than two or three years?
This isn't what sports is about,
kids. It's not about antitrust law
suits, incentive clauses and
multi-million dollar endorsement
deals. As Kao so succinctly put it
last week, sports is life. It's about
the thrill of competition, it's
about teamwork, it's about
adrenaline.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not try
ing to drive any of you disenchanted
sports fans away from the game.
Sports are still alive and well —
you've just got to look a little farther
than your basic Sunday afternoon
TV sports programming. Sports are
still thriving on this nation's black
top basketball courts, Little League
diamonds, and, of course, Pee-Wee

football fields.
In fact, sports are still alive and
well on the Stanford campus, home
of the nation's most successful colle
giate athletic programs. Go check
out a ballgame sometime at Sunken
Diamond. Or catch some men's ten
nis at the Varsity Tennis Courts.
Visit a wrestling match at Burnham
Pavilion. You'll find out what I'm
talking about.
Maybe I'll take my own advice
and see if I ain't rediscover the love
the way Kao did. But I don't think
I'll find it in the ranks of profession
al sports — they lost the love a long
time ago. And I certainly won't find
it watching the Seattle Seahawks
playing in the Rose Bowl on Sunday
afternoons this fall.
Oh, maybe I'll get over this Sea
hawks thing eventually. Maybe one
day I'll even grow to like them. But
for now, I'll stick with IM basketball
and cheering on my beloved Cardi
nal.
If you'll excuse me, I think I'm
gonna go play some mud football.
