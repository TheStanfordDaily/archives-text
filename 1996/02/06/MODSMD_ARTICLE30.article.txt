# Seahawks to L.A.?
## 
### 
In his last column as sports
editor last Tuesday, Dan
Kao informed our loyal
readership that he had — and I
quote — ''rediscovered the true
meaning of sports." Apparent
ly, while playing mud football at
halftime of the Super Bowl and
watching Nike's "This Week in
Pee Wee Football" commer
cials, Mr. Kao experienced an
epiphany.

Well, I'm glad that my prede
cessor was able to recapture
such a bright outlook on the
world of sports in the last week
of his term as editor, but I'm
afraid I can't spout such opti
mism in my first week on the
job. You see, last Thursday one
of the worst catastrophes known
to mankind struck my home
town of Los Angeles.
An earthquake, you ask?

Riot, perhaps? Fire? Flood??
Try Seahawks — as in Seattle.
That's right, for those of you who
haven't yet heard, late last week
— just a few days after Magic
Johnson set the city afire with his
return to pro basketball (you did
hear about that one, didn't you?)
— Seattle Seahawk owner Ken
Behring made public his plans to
pack up the team's bags and head
south for the City of Angels.
It was bad enough last season
when the Raiders and Rams
bolted for Oakland and St.
Louis, respectively, leaving the
nation's second-largest city with
no professional football team to
speak of. At least Southern Cali
fornia football fans had USC's
Rose Bowl-winning season and a
solid year at UCLA to tide them
over.
But the Seahawks? I think
most football fans in L.A. would
rather stick with no team than
root for the 'Hawks. I never
thought I'd hear myself say this,
but I think I'm starting to miss
the Rams. How many people in
I>os Angeles are so desperate for
gridiron action that they'd actu
ally show up at the Rose Bowl to
cheer on a second-rate perennial
loser like the Seahawks?
