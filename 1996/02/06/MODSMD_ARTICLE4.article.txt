# Discussion addresses poverty, environment
## 
### Athima Chansanchai Staff writer 
Four representatives of mar
ginalized groups discussed envi
ronmental justice, racism and
community empowerment last
night in Robinson House.
The panel, moderated by Envi
ronmental Engineering Prof. Jim
Leckie, stressed that a correlation
has evolved between environmen
tal degradation and political and
economic clout.
"We, the legal services law

firms, are at the forefront of envi
ron mental justice for poor people,"
said Jay Peterson of the California
Indian Legal Services, a group rep
resenting the concerns of Native
Americans.
Peterson noted that issues in
the Native-American community
— which includes 104 tribes and
reservations on 500,000 acres of
California land — present a
unique situation in the state.
"Since California has no juris
diction on Indian lands, it presents
corporations with opportunities to
exploit them," Peterson said.
"The fundamental issue in any
country is this: That if the envi
ronment is already degradated, it
is an unstated assumption that in
cidental degradation will have less
of an impact," he said.
Jose Padilla, executive director
of California Rural Legal Assis
tance and Stanford alumnus, dis
cussed the relationship between
the lack of legal representation
and environmental destruction.
"Justice is power," Padilla said.
He spoke of the importance of giv
ing power back to the communi
ties.
"Law doesn't mean much un
less the people demand its enforce

ment," he said.
Greenpeace's Bradley Angel
said corporations that pollute the
environment tend to gravitate to
ward rural and poorer communi
ties, where they are "most likely to
find the least resistance."
"As a result, there are three
Class-1 hazardous waste landfills
in California," Angel said.
Padilla referred to the "mea
sured justice" with which largely
ineffective regulations are deliv
ered to poorer communities.
Instead of eliminating exposure
to pollutants, Padilla said, rules
governing these communities
merely try to reduce their effects.
Panelist Mike Tomaszkiewicz
of the San Francisco Advocates for
Environmental Rights (SAFER),
which functions under Communi
ties for a Better Environment, dis
cussed the organization's most re
cent campaign — "Right to Know
the Conditions of the Bay."

The campaign seeks to inform
the public about fish contamina
tion affecting people who do sub
sistence fishing off of the Bay Area
piers.
Tomaszkiewicz said that 60
percent of the fishermen are peo
ple of color and immigrants.
"These fish health warnings
have been out since the early
19705, but only in English and not
posted at the piers," said
Tomaszkiewicz.
SAFER's strategy is to go di
rectly to the sewage plants and try
to persuade them to implement
pollution prevention programs.
San Jose, Palo Alto and Sunnyvale
have already agreed to such pro
grams. Tomaszkiewicz said it
hasn't been easy to deal with the
public agencies that run the
plants.
"It's like pulling teeth," he said
"and they're supposed to be re
sponsible to the communities."
