# 568 students chosen for early admission
## More freshmen apply for Class of 2000 
### Timothy Kiefer 
Five hundred sixty-eight members of
the Class of 2000 have been admitted
under Stanford's new early decision pro
gram, exceeding the expectations of admis
sions officials.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid James Montoya said he orig
inally estimated that 25 percent to 30 per
cent of next year's freshman class would be
admitted through the early decision pro
gram. The 568 admits represent 35 percent
of the class.
Three thousand forty-seven students
applied through the early decision pro
gram, which was well above Montoya's
original estimate of 2,000 applicants. Ap
proximately one-fifth of all applicants ap
plied through the program.
Montoya attributed the higher-than-ex
pected numbers to a strong applicant pool.
"At this morning's staff meeting, sever
al members of the staff were commenting
on the strength of the applicant pool," he
said.
Under the early decision program, appli
cants promise to attend Stanford if they
are admitted. In return, they receive an
early decision on their admission.
Students applying under the early deci

sion program are admitted only if they are
seen as "clear admits." Students who could
go either way are deferred until the spring
for a final decision. Students who would be

clearly denied admission
in the general applicant
pool are also notified
early.
The program is divided
into two parts. Under the
Early Decision I program,
applicants who applied by
Nov. 1 were notified of
their status by mid-De
cember. The program ad
mitted 301 students.

Under the Early Decision II program,
applicants applied by the regular Dec. 15
deadline but were sent response letters
last Friday if they opted for early decision.
That program admitted 267 students.
Early decision programs have been crit
icized by those who feel they force high
school students to make decisions too
early. Montoya said this criticism was un
warranted.
"We have been very careful not to send
the message that if you want to attend
Stanford, you must apply early decision,"
