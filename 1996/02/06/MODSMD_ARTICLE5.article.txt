# 568 students chosen for early admission
## More freshmen apply for Class of 2000 
### Timothy Kiefer 
Five hundred sixty-eight members of
the Class of 2000 have been admitted
under Stanford's new early decision pro
gram, exceeding the expectations of admis
sions officials.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid James Montoya said he orig
inally estimated that 25 percent to 30 per
cent of next year's freshman class would be
admitted through the early decision pro
gram. The 568 admits represent 35 percent
of the class.
Three thousand forty-seven students
applied through the early decision pro
gram, which was well above Montoya's
original estimate of 2,000 applicants. Ap
proximately one-fifth of all applicants ap
plied through the program.
Montoya attributed the higher-than-ex
pected numbers to a strong applicant pool.
"At this morning's staff meeting, sever
al members of the staff were commenting
on the strength of the applicant pool," he
said.
Under the early decision program, appli
cants promise to attend Stanford if they
are admitted. In return, they receive an
early decision on their admission.
Students applying under the early deci

sion program are admitted only if they are
seen as "clear admits." Students who could
go either way are deferred until the spring
for a final decision. Students who would be

clearly denied admission
in the general applicant
pool are also notified
early.
The program is divided
into two parts. Under the
Early Decision I program,
applicants who applied by
Nov. 1 were notified of
their status by mid-De
cember. The program ad
mitted 301 students.

Under the Early Decision II program,
applicants applied by the regular Dec. 15
deadline but were sent response letters
last Friday if they opted for early decision.
That program admitted 267 students.
Early decision programs have been crit
icized by those who feel they force high
school students to make decisions too
early. Montoya said this criticism was un
warranted.
"We have been very careful not to send
the message that if you want to attend
Stanford, you must apply early decision,"


Montoya
he said.
Stanford's introduction of
early decision this year may be
part of a trend. Yale and Prince
ton also introduced early decision
programs this year. Harvard also
has increased the number of stu
dents admitted through its early
action program.
A total of 16,259 students ap
plied for both regular and early
decision admission in 1995-96.
That represents a 6 percent in
crease over last year.
It is unclear whether the early
decision program has contributed
to this year's increase in total ap
plications, Montoya said.

Applications have been steadi
ly increasing since 1992. In 1994-
95, applications increased 5 per
cent over the previous year; 1993-
94 applications increased 7 per
cent; and 1992-93 applications
increased 3 percent.
Over the past five years appli
cations for undergraduate admis
sions have increased 23 percent,
from 13,206 in 1991-92 to 16,259
this year.
"I think that speaks to the
high regard with which Stanford
is held among the nation's top
students," Montoya said.
Montoya attributed the rise in
applications to Stanford's recov
ery from a spate of bad news sev
eral years ago.
"Stanford suffered as a result
of the earthquake as well as the
negative publicity regarding the

indirect-cost investigation,"
Montoya said.
Montoya said the focus should
remain on the quality of the ap
plicant pool rather than the num
ber of applicants.
"Yes, the numbers get bigger,
but the quality just keeps getting
better," he said.
The five-year increase in ap
plications might also be part of
a larger trend. For example, ap
plications at Harvard during
the same five-year period in
creased 38 percent from 13,029
to 18,013, University officials
said.
Montoya said Harvard's in
crease might be due to its adop
tion of a common application
form used at several universities,
which makes it easier to apply
there.
