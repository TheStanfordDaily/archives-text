## Med School reaching out to private sector 
### Adam Kemezis Contributing writer 
Doing away with practices that have pre
vented full cooperation with private indus
try is now a top priority at the School of Med
icine.
In his State of the School speech last
week, Dean of the Medical School Eugene
Bauer announced a major initiative based on
the recommendations of a committee headed
by Medical and Clinical Pharmacology Prof.
Kenneth Melmon.
The committee proposed ways to achieve
greater cooperation between academia and
such sectors as the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries. Collaborative ef
forts would include partnerships for re
search, clinical trials of new products and
purchasing stock in companies, said Assoc.
Molecular Pharmacology Prof. Phyllis Gard
ner, who helped develop the recommenda
tions.
Among the committee's recommenda
tions was the creation of a centralized office

to take charge of cooperative projects with
industry.
The committee also recommended that
Stanford more clearly define its standards
with regard to issues of intellectual property
and the giving and taking of credit for pro
jects.
Melmon said the Medical School has not
historically kept up with other medical
schools or other parts of the University in
levels of cooperation with the private sector.
He said such cooperation is vital to the "basic
mission of biology and medicine, which is to
apply our work to human beings."
According to Melmon, creating a central
office to deal with joint initiatives is neces
sary because under the present system there
is not enough incentive for people to make
cooperative deals and too much incentive to
remain cautious and therefore avoid blame.
On issues of intellectual property, Mel
mon said it is necessary to create rules for de
ciding who gets credit for what.
