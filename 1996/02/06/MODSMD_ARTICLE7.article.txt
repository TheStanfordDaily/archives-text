# Precious proposals
## Alumna records favorite propositions from the heart 
### Karen Heywood Staff writer 
Imagine finding an engage
ment ring at the bottom of your
salad bowl. Or popping the ques
tion over the Internet. How
about in the middle of a bungee
jump?
All these gimmicks and more
are offered up in "Will You
Marry Me? The World's Most
Romantic Proposals," a new
book out just in time for Valen
tine's Day.
For author and Stanford
alumna Cynthia Clumeck
Muchnick, that decisive mo
ment came when her then
boyfriend and fellow Stanford
graduate, Adam, proposed on a
pocket Scrabble board at the
Rodin Sculpture Garden in
Paris.
"Halfway through the game,
he put down the word 'marry,' "
said Muchnick. "Not only did he
make a strategically bad move,
he opened up a triple word
score."
When Muchnick pointed out
his apparent mistake, "he told

used her engagement as a basis for a collection of interesting proposals. The collection will be re
leased in time for Valentine's Day.
me to read the board — on which he
had put down the words, 'Will you
marry me' — got down on one knee,
took a ring out of his blue jeans
pocket and we got engaged," she
said. "It was the only time in my life
I was ever speechless."
Her book, which alphabetically
chronicles more than 50 creative
proposal anecdotes "from Athletic
to Zany," grew out of that moment,
Muchnick said.
"I said to everyone I knew, 'Wait
until you hear about the guy I'm
marrying, the most romantic guy in
the world,' " Muchnick said. "I
found that everyone had their own
[proposal] stories, and I started col
lecting them as a hobby."
She said that after her Bay Area
wedding, while working as a 10th
grade history teacher in Ft. Laud
erdale, Fla., her husband encour
aged her to compile these stories
into a book.
"He told me to just send it off
and see what happens," she said.
After sending a sample off to a
number of publishers, she received
an offer from Macmillan Publish
ing last May.
"They asked, 'How quickly can
your finish the book?' " Muchnick
said, "and I wrote it madly over that
summer."
She said her research for the

book involved "calling everyone in
my address book; everyone I had
ever met in my life.
"It's basically a book about my
friends and their friends and their
friends and their friends," she said.
Although it is being released
with Valentine's Day in mind, the
book's appeal should carry over to
the June wedding season, Much
nick said.
And while she said the book was
written primarily to inspire men to
propose, the romance of the subject
has reached a largely female audi
ence.
"Lots of women have been buy
ing it for their boyfriends," she said.
"And lots of mothers have been
buying it for their sons. Some girl
friends have even gotten their
boyfriends' moms to buy it for them
as a hint."
Anecdotes in "Will You Marry
Me?" include such outrageous
proposals as an airplane pilot
proposing over the public address
system and an underwater en
gagement.
But Muchnick says her own
story is still her favorite. "I've prob
ably told the story of my own pro
posal hundreds of times, but every
time I tell it I get warm all over
again. It really was my inspirat ion,"
she said.
With the book's initial printing
of 25,000 copies and nationwide re
lease, Muchnick — who now lives in
Southern California — has been
busy promoting it with book sign

ink's, interviews on radio shows and
appearances at bridal expos. She is
even scheduled to appear on an up
coming episode of Sally Jesse
Raphael's daytime talk show
But Muchnick said she's espe
cially excited to promote the book at
Stanford — at the Bookstore on
Feb. 9 — where she met and fell in
love with her husband, Adam.
In fact, she added, the couple's
first kiss took place in Stanford's
own Rodin Sculpture Garden,
adding special significance to the
proposal at the Paris counterpart.
Since the completion of the
book, Muchnick said she has been
bombarded with countless other
unique proposals and hopes that
the pocket-si7.ed volume will garner
enough popularity to spawn a se
quel — for which she said she will
have no shortage of material.
"The book sort of renews our
faith that romance and love are still
alive. We see all these sad, depress
ing things in the news all the time
— this is testimony that good
things are out there," Muchnick
said.
And though she said her book is
not meant to prescribe a "recipe"
for getting engaged, she hopes it
will encourage people to make their
own proposals memorable.
"If you plan something creative
it can l)e told and retold and become
part of your family history," she
said. "[lnventive proposalsl really
start becoming folk tales that will
be passed on for years."
