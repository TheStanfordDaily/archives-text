STANFORD--If you work
or go to school at Stanford
then you can get the best
price on computer hardware
and software. Your
affiliation entitles you to
even better pricing than the
computer chain stores
across the Bay area.
What can you buy?
Companies like Apple,
Adobe, Microsoft, Sun and
IBM offer the best pricing
possible to the campus. In
some cases you can save up
to $500 off of a chain store
price.
Who is eligible?
Employees, staff and faculty
of the Stanford University,
SLAC, Lucille Packard
Childrens Hospital and
SITN are all eligible for the
discounts through the

university bookstore. "Not
everyone realizes that
because of their association
with the campus they can get
better pricing on hardware
and software at the Stanford
Bookstore than anywhere
else in the Bay Area." stated
Dave Brounstein, Division
Sales Manager at Microdisc.
He added "Microdisc stands
for MlCROcomputer
DlSCcount. The program
was started to give the
Stanford community the
ability to get the technology
tools they need at the
savings they deserve."
A visit to the Bookstore
will show Microdisc one
level down from the main
floor. The walls are lined
with over 150 titles of
software for Mac and both
Windows platforms.
