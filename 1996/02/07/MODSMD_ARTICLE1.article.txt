# Honor Code violations jump
## Stanford sees 62 percent increase from last academic year 
### Jason Lada 
The number of reported Honor Code
violations increased dramatically last
academic vear, up 62 percent from
1993-94.
Of the 47 students charged who were
charged with violations, 43 have been
penalized — a 65 percent increase from
just 26 punishments last year, accord
ing to an annual misconduct summary
released yesterday by the Office of Judi
cial Affairs. Violations of the Funda
mental Standard, however, remained
constant at 13.
Out of the cases completed, only one
student chose to protest his innocence
by going before the University's judicial
council.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said he
was "clearly not happy with the in
crease" in Honor Code violations.

With the exception of a 1993-94 dip
in violations reported, transgressions
over the past few years have been on the
rise. Administrators, however, do not
have a single explanation for the trend.
"You can't single out one cause . . .
from the end statistics," said Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole, pointing to
the fact that several events must occur
before a student is charged with an
1 lonor Code violation.
The 1 lonor Code is a contract among
all students and faculty to prevent
cheatingby monitoring oneself and oth
ers. It relies on those within the system
to report breaches of this trust.
Wais said he believes the "steady in
crease" of reported Honor Code viola
tions means that "either more students
are actively engaged in dishonesty" or
that they are becoming more vigilant in
reporting cheating.

Honor Code violations for 1994-95
included 14 counts of submittinganoth
er's work, seven of unpermitted collabo
ration, seven of giving or receiving un
permitted aid, six of plagiarism and six
of alterations to graded work.
Two-thirds of those penalized were
men, and undergraduates committed 75
percent of I lonor Code violations.
The Department of Computer Sci
ence led the pack for the second consec
utive year with nine Honor Code viola
tions, followed by chemistry and civil
engineering with four violations each.
The report also broke down 13 Fun
damental Standard offenses into 10
punishments and three cases dropped
or still pending — numbers which are
virtually unchanged from previous
years.
