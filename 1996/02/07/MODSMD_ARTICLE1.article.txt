# Honor Code violations jump
## Stanford sees 62 percent increase from last academic year 
### Jason Lada 
The number of reported Honor Code
violations increased dramatically last
academic vear, up 62 percent from
1993-94.
Of the 47 students charged who were
charged with violations, 43 have been
penalized — a 65 percent increase from
just 26 punishments last year, accord
ing to an annual misconduct summary
released yesterday by the Office of Judi
cial Affairs. Violations of the Funda
mental Standard, however, remained
constant at 13.
Out of the cases completed, only one
student chose to protest his innocence
by going before the University's judicial
council.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said he
was "clearly not happy with the in
crease" in Honor Code violations.

With the exception of a 1993-94 dip
in violations reported, transgressions
over the past few years have been on the
rise. Administrators, however, do not
have a single explanation for the trend.
"You can't single out one cause . . .
from the end statistics," said Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole, pointing to
the fact that several events must occur
before a student is charged with an
1 lonor Code violation.
The 1 lonor Code is a contract among
all students and faculty to prevent
cheatingby monitoring oneself and oth
ers. It relies on those within the system
to report breaches of this trust.
Wais said he believes the "steady in
crease" of reported Honor Code viola
tions means that "either more students
are actively engaged in dishonesty" or
that they are becoming more vigilant in
reporting cheating.

Honor Code violations for 1994-95
included 14 counts of submittinganoth
er's work, seven of unpermitted collabo
ration, seven of giving or receiving un
permitted aid, six of plagiarism and six
of alterations to graded work.
Two-thirds of those penalized were
men, and undergraduates committed 75
percent of I lonor Code violations.
The Department of Computer Sci
ence led the pack for the second consec
utive year with nine Honor Code viola
tions, followed by chemistry and civil
engineering with four violations each.
The report also broke down 13 Fun
damental Standard offenses into 10
punishments and three cases dropped
or still pending — numbers which are
virtually unchanged from previous
years.


Sothy Chhe — Daily
Based on the premise that stu
dents must respect others, the
Fundamental Standard applies to
student conduct inside and out
side the area of academics. The
Honor Code is essentially the ap
plication of the Fundamental
Standard to academic matters.
Eighty percent of the violators
of the Fundamental Standard
were men, while 90 percent were
undergraduates.
Offenses included electronic
mail misconduct, altering tran
scripts, forgery, theft and unau
thorized entry into locked Uni
versity buildings.
The severity of punishments
for both Honor Code and Funda

mental Standard offenses ranged
from letters of censure and finan
cial penalties to 80-hour work
sentences. One student was sus
pended for a quarter.
Out of 53 completed miscon
duct cases — including 43 related
to the Honor Code and 10 related
to the Fundamental Standard —
only one went before an initial
fact-finding committee and then
the Stanford Judicial Council, an
eight-member committee of stu
dents and faculty.
The rest of the students plead
ed no-contest to the charges,
choosing to go before the dean of
students, according to the report.
Cole said one explanation for
the low number of students fol
lowing the judicial path is "em
barrassment, the difference be
tween one person behind closed
doors instead of in front of a lot of

students and faculty."
The Legislative and Judicial
Charter that established the cur
rent student disciplinary process
and the judicial council dates
back to 1968.
University President Gerhard
Casper has called recently for a
reform of the disciplinary system,
hoping to make it less bureau
cratic. Two weeks ago, Casper an
nounced his intention to convene
the Committee of 15 — the only
body able to review or change the
charter — for the first time since
1991.
Though the misconduct sum
mary was originally scheduled for
a November 1995 release, Wais
explained that the Judicial Af
fairs Office was "formatting [the
report] in a different way" so that
it would provide "more info in
one quick look."
