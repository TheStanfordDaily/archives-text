BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - Pat
Buchanan seized the conservative ban
ner in the Republican presidential race
yesterday with a thumping upset of
Sen. Phil Gramm in Louisiana caucus
es. Other candidates boycotted the con
test in deference to next week's tradi
tional kickoff in lowa.
Buchanan, with deep support among
Christian conservatives, demonstrated
strength in all corners of Louisiana as
he dealt a punishing and perhaps lethal
setback to Gramm's presidential hopes.
"This is a victory for a new conser
vatism of the heart," Buchanan told
The Associated Press. "We have put
together a coalition of conservatives
and populists I now believe can win the
Republican nomination . . . We are
going to carry this on to lowa and New

Hampshire."
There were 21 Republican National
Convention delegates at stake and with
all the precincts counted, AP's delegate
survey showed Buchanan won 13 and
Gramm eight. That was a stiff setback
for Gramm in an event engineered by
his allies in the state.
Just a week ago, Gramm said: "To
become president of the United States,
I have to win here in Louisiana."
Only Buchanan, Gramm and anti
abortion candidate Alan Keyes cam
paigned here. The other GOP hopefuls
stayed away in homage to lowa's tradi
tional role as the first caucus state.
Those boycotting included the two
leading contenders, Bob Dole and Steve
Forbes, as well as former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander and Indiana

Sen. Dick Lugar. They insisted in
advance that Louisiana wouldn't mat
ter, although they also rushed to inter
pret the results as devastating to
Gramm.
"The presidential race begins next
Monday in lowa," Alexander said.
Indeed, even Louisiana Republicans
seemed to think so. The state party said
about 7 percent of registered Republi
cans participated yesterday.
"Most lowans haven't paid much
attention to Louisiana," said lowa
Republican Party chairman Brian
Kennedy. "But to the extent people did,
Phil Gramm is going to look silly
because he was the one who came up
with the idea of Louisiana jumping
ahead of lowa so that he could have a
springboard."
