CSAAS should use
accepted channels
to achieve its goals

ON A CAMPUS noted for its
lack of student activism, it is
gratifying to see students
lobby their university for changes
they feel are necessary. Thanks to
such advocacy — and months of
committee meetings and communi
ty input — Stanford created the
innovative Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity program, a
unique and welcome addition to the
curriculum.
When students try to advance
their desires by impulsively calling
for boycotts and strikes, however, it
is harder to praise the people
involved. Such is the case with one
campus group that has been in the
news recently: the Concerned Stu
dents for Asian American Studies.
The actions of these students
exhibit a disturbing pattern of
unwillingness to use traditional
avenues of advocacy — and a fail
ure to use already existing means to
have their voices heard.
Their stated mission — to push
for an Asian-American Studies pro
gram at Stanford — is a positive
one. But CSAAS's underlying goals
and aggressive approach raise some
questions.
Last week, CSAAS members
wrote a letter to Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences ;fohn Shoven with
several demands, including more
student influence over CSRE hir
ing and decision-making and the
hiring of a senior Asian-American
Studies professor by the end of the
next school year. Failure to meet
the demands by last Friday — four
days after the ultimatum was deliv
ered — would result in a public boy
cott of CSRE and a "national cam
paign" to publicize the issue, they
said.
This is ridiculous. Quite simply, it
is not appropriate for any group of

students to have veto power over the
choice of faculty. Allowing CSAAS
even the appearance of such power
would set an unwanted precedent
and raise serious questions about
the integrity of Stanford as a world
class academic institution.
Furthermore, the aggressive and
threatening nature of the letter
was uncalled for and counterpro
ductive. Members of CSAAS need
to grow up and realize that rash
and illogical demands will never
work. For those members who
haven't been around long enough
to remember the last serious
attempt at protest — the May 1994
MEChA hunger strike — a quick
history lesson: The administration
didn't cave in to MEChA's wide
ranging demands even after several
days of negative publicity. The cri
sis was finally resolved with the
promise of several committees to
look into the requests. In fact, it
was the work of one of these com
mittees which led to the creation of
CSRE.
Members of CSAAS don't seem
willing to endure the admittedly
slow and bureaucratic process of
decision-making by committee.
That the process is cumbersome is
unfortunate, but it's nothing new.
Last quarter, the ASSU's Nomina
tions Commission chairman — who
is charged with appointing stu
dents to University committees —
had trouble generating any interest
among CSAAS members in a posi
tion on CSRE's advisory commit
tee. Members of the group were so
apathetic that none had applied by
the deadline in spite of heavy solici
tation via e-mail. Only after the
deadline passed did CSAAS mem
bers realize their mistake. They
then tried to undermine the pro
cess by challenging the Nom
Comm's recommendations and
pressuring the students chosen for
the committee to decline.
So far, members of CSAAS have
failed to use the existing channels
to advocate their demands, instead
resorting to threats of boycotts and
bad publicity. That's no way to
negotiate at a place like Stanford.
