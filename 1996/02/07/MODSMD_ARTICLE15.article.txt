Shen's anti-ASSU column merely campaign propaganda

IT WAS CERTAINLY convenient for Bill
Shen to have his campaign platform
printed 13,500 times. But I wonder why
Shen didn't bother to say all this earlier in
the year. Is it just coincidence that ASSU
elections will be fast approaching?
Obviously, Shen is still mad that his

People's Platform cronies made him shave
his green hair. For what it's worth, I
believed he had full right to have green
hair. Go for it Bill — strike your old friends
where it hurts most: their ASSU toy!
I find it kind of amusing, though, how
quickly Shen has changed his opinion

regarding everything he formerly advo
cated. I wonder if he is planning to join
the Student's Alliance. While he is waf
fling more than my Eggo, he should
resign from the Stanford Democrats and
make a run for the leadership of the
Republican Youth Majority. A word to

the wise, don't try to take away the Spe
cial Fees — keep some dignity, Bill.
One last observation, I liked Shen's
idea about one president. I am curious if
he had anybody in mind.
