# Sher will more than fill Campbell's shoes
## 
### 
The Daily's front-page story on Feb. 6
reporting that former state Senator Tom
Campbell outranked Assemblyman
Byron Sher in a recent survey of state
legislators was not surprising in view of
the fact that the vote was skewed by a
mass of Republican staffers.
Much more surprising was the Daily
reporter's offhand comment that Sher,
who is running for Campbell's state
Senate seat, may not have an easy time
"filling Campbell's shoes." On the con
trary, if the criteria for excellence as a
state legislator include serving all the
people of California — not simply well
heeled contributors — and concern for
the long-term economic and social needs
of the state as a whole, then Sher
should stay out of anybody's shoes but
his own.
In his 16 years as an Assemblyman,
Sher has established as unequaled

record as an effective champion of the
environment, consumer protection,
public schools, economic development
and women's reproductive rights. As
chairman of the Natural Resources
Committee, he helped pass the Cali
fornia Clean Air Act and the Califor
nia Safe Drinking Water Act, worked
to protect old-growth forests and
helped promote environmental tech
nology as a source of new business
and employment. Unlike Campbell,
who voted to cut already meager wel
fare payments to poor mothers and
children and to the disabled poor,
Sher supports maintenance of an ade
quate safety net for society's most vul
nerable citizens.
The new Republican majority in the
state Assembly recently passed a
nightmare list of legislation that
included allowing people to carry con
cealed weapons, allowing farmers con
tinued use of a highly toxic insecticide
and cutting finds for health and wel
fare while slashing the corporate tax
rate by 20 percent. A bill to permit

corporal punishment in the schools
was barely defeated. Californians can
only hope these and similar bills will
be blocked or modified in the state
Senate, where Democrats have only a
two-vote majority. Because this major
ity is so narrow, Sher's election is cru
cial to those who value far-sighted
ness, good sense and compassion in
those we choose to represent us.
