# Museum staff troubled by theft of sculpture
## 
### 
This letter is written in regard to the
article published on Jan. 25 on the
theft of a sculpture from the New
Guinea Sculpture Garden. The Garden
is part of the Outdoor Sculpture Pro
gram and, therefore, under the jurisdic
tion of the Stanford Art Museum. I
want to correct any impression the arti
cle may have left that this theft is being

taken lightly.
The Museum has consistently made
clear that it regards any vandalism or
theft of any work of art on display as a
serious offense. We will seek legal,
financial and academic penalties for
anyone apprehended in connection with
this offense or any other attack on the
outdoor sculpture.
The work of art in this instance
was produced on the campus; the
artists gave generously of themselves,
were warmly welcomed and became
part of the community. The hope is
that their art will stand as a perma
nent reminder of their presence and
of the importance of intercultural
understanding.
The outdoor art collection is a valu
able educational asset, one which pro
vides daily enjoyment to the University
community. Those who deface or tam
per with such assets infringe on the
rights of others and reduce the value of
the University's collections.
