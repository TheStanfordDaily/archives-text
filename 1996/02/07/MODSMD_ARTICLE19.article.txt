## Troy Gilbert Thoughts on the crossing of lines 
### 
Each winter quar
ter, I spend an
inordinate amount
of my "free" evenings
facilitating the Stanford
dorm program / multi
cultural salad toss / let-it
all-hang-out bonding
extravaganza known as
"Crossing the Line."

For those of you who have never been
through it, the attendees (often most of a
dorm's residents) stand on one ominous
side of a taped line, and the leader calls out
various descriptors commonly applied to
groups of people. The descriptors begin as
non-threatening and introductory ("Any
one who wears glasses" or "Anyone who is
the youngest child"), move into general
items of interest ("Anyone who is a Social
ist"), and then to more difficult things to
disclose ("Anyone who has ever been
charged with a felony," "Anyone who has a
learning disability" or "Anyone who feels no
one really knows them at Stanford").
The program has assumed somewhat
legendary status in student culture.
There is nearly an hour of "crossing"
descriptions. Students generally enjoy
viewing their community from differing
perspectives and learning the true diver

sity that exists in a standard campus res
idence. "Crossing the Line" is an oppor
tunity to understand how others view the
world. How are others — people who on
move-in day seemed similar — different
from you? How do different experiences,
perceptions and notions form a singular
community?
But the crucial component of "Cross
ing the Line" is not the drama of who fits
what description, but rather the discus
sion afterward. We gather in small
groups or pairs and, eventually, as the
large group. Finally, after an often end
less series of questions from the facilita
tor and observations from the partici
pants, there is a point, a wonderful
moment in the discussion where some
one asks someone else, "What has that
experience been like for you?" or "How
did it feel to be the only person to have
crossed the line for that issue?" These
moments are the true essence of commu
nity-building because instead of cross
ing, talking or taking a stand, someone
wants to hear.
There has been some hoopla and
press coverage regarding the Dean of
Students Working Group Report on Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Student Needs.
In typical "Crossing the Line" fashion,

the Dean of Students has crossed the
line to create and respond to this report
and many in the lesbian, gay and bisexu
al community have crossed the line to
say why it is important to them. But it
has been a true disappointment to me
that so few people (outside of the Dean
and the queer community) have tried to
understand. Many who hear about the
report react, position, declare and cross,
but they are missing the crucial compo
nent, a real opportunity to better under
stand the queer community.
Many people and many sources con
tributed to the report — it is thus rich
with descriptions, insights and discussion
about how sexual orientation is relevant
to Stanford and academe. I think the
clear explanations of complex issues are
the report's greatest strengths. We need
to do more than position, we need to
understand. A true ally is an educated
one.
Hopefully I'll see many of you this
quarter crossing the line. And staying for
the discussion.
