# 'The world is yours to see
## Astronaut still looking ahead

Mac Jemison has always been ahead of
her time.
A high school standout, she enrolled at
the Farm at the age of l(i and was one of a
few women to play intramural football, par
ticipate in student politics and graduate
with dual degrees in chemical engineering
and African and Afro-American Studies.
The outstanding student was a prodigy
on the national scale, becoming the first
African-American female in space.
But Jemison has never forgotten her
roots in the Farm, she told The Daily in an
interview yesterday. For the second time in
five years, Jemison will return to speak at
Stanford, this time giving the keynote ad
dress at Commencement in June.
Was it simply Stanford that inspired this
woman to achieve greatness? Partially,
Jemison said, although she added she be

lievesall of her life experiences have been in
tegral.
She commended Stanford on its ability to
produce a broad range of extra-curricular
activities, which "are extremely important


Mae Jemison
for building you and preparing
you for the future.
"College is a wonderful place to
get skills in . . . a non-threatening
way," she said.
The importance of the college
experience cannot be ignored,
Jemison said. "One's education
affects their life," she said.
" Period."
Only 19 years after her own
graduation, Jemison herself will
take the podium. It is a thought
she considers exciting, yet intimi
dating.
Jemison said she remembers
the stereotypical Commencement
speaker as someone who gradu
ates rarely hear.
But as an accomplished lectur
er, Jemison hopes to mark the
graduation ceremony by providing
"perspective for graduates as well
as for family and faculty." She
considers her speech a great re
sponsibility and hopes to help

those in attendance to "digest the
past."
Jemison was horn in Decatur,
Ala. After graduating from Stan
ford, she received a doctorate in
medicine from Cornell University,
spent almost three years in the
Peace Corps in Africa and worked
as a general practitioner in Los
Angeles.
She joined NASA in 1987 and
flew aboard the space shuttle En
deavor in 1992. She currently is
the founder and president of The
Jemison Group, Inc., which aims
to integrate science and technolo
gy into daily life.
Jemison said she believes
every child is born with an eager
ness to achieve in the world, a
view she uses to explain her own
success.
"Everyone has their own innate
motivation," she said. "It is some
thing we all have as children."
It is holding on to that motiva
tion through life that is the hard
part, Jemison said. Her own strat
egy for keeping her eagerness in
tact, she added, has been by "see
ing the world is yours to see."

Jemison also emphasized the
importance of laughing at your
self.
"Often people are tragically se
rious," she said.
In addition, Jemison's parents
have influenced her throughout
her life.
"They were happy to support
me when I was interested in doing
non-conventional things," she
said. Regardless of the path she
chose, Jemison said her parents
simply "asked that I do it well and
look inside myself."
As a minority woman entering
the math and science fields 20
years ago, Jemison inevitably
faced obstacles â€” barriers which
she said minority women today
still must strive to overcome.
"There is a dangerous backlash
against women and minorities be
cause of an inaccurate perception
of what affirmative action is," she
said. Far too prevalent is the no
tion that minorities and women
"wouldn't be there if they
weren't" beneficiaries of affirma
tive action, she said, "which is ab
solutely ridiculous."
