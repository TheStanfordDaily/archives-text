Nazi-lovers. Defenders of the
Klan. For many Americans
these epitaphs are directly
linked to the American Civil Liberties
Union.
Witness the misguided ACLU and its
counter-productive commitment to
blind ideology, they will say: in 1978,
defending the American Nazi Party's
right to march through Skokie, 111., a
Chicago suburb and home to many
Holocaust survivors. Helping a Ku Klux
Klansman preach hate with impunity in
1969. Fighting for an anti-Semitic
priest's freedom to denounce Jews at a
political rally as early as 1949.
How can the good liberal troops of
the ACLU derive any satisfaction, a
sense of victory even, from watching a
parade of Klansmen or reading a neo-
Nazi Internet posting?
I suspect that many ACLU staffers are
in fact sickened by these images, but — in
truth — they have no choice but to defend
them. A group dedicated to upholding free
speech cannot use a screen of its own sen
sibilities, however widely held those views
may be, to filter out the speech it chooses
to defend — not if it expects to credibly
condemn others for repressing words and
ideas deemed offensive by another partic
ular set of sensibilities.
Or, put another way by the ACLU,

"popular and palatable ideas do not
need protection . . . only unpopular and
offensive doctrines do."
I try to remember that as I pack my
good wool suit, my hiking boots, my
down coat. I try to remember as I think
about "attending" to my cousin Aman
da's guest book, whatever attendance it
may require. I tried to remember even as
I cringed at the wedding invitation in my
post office box: a sappy picture of Aman
da and Brigham cuddling for the camera.
I leave for Idaho tomorrow to witness
the extinction of my cousin as I know
her, and the creation of Mrs. Brigham
Parker. To watch her open boxes filled
with Tupperware and bed linens, to
watch her joyously throw her 23-year
old body into her prescribed role in the
most patriarchal of schemes. To give my
tacit ascent to her choice.
And what's worse, I have to like it.
Amanda was always older and better.
Our sadistically competitive grandmoth
er had us competing in geography tour
naments and spelling bees when I was
still in pre-school; Amanda always won.
Amanda ran faster. Amanda played the
piano beautifully, and, unlike me, she
had the dedication to practice every day.
Even Amanda's deficiencies were
somehow turned into personal tri
umphs. At seven, when she quit biting

her nails, Grandma bestowed upon her
an ostentatious pink manicure set Bar
bie would have coveted. (That I never
bit my nails was somehow lost on
Grandma; even at six, my over-devel
oped sense of justice flashed red as I was
reduced to borrowing Amanda's pearl
handled clippers to avoid yet another
lecture on long nails from the sour
piano teacher.)
During high school, Amanda's father
remarried and the family converted to
Mormonism. Amanda moved to a tiny
town in rural Idaho with her family.
Our worlds became very different.
Amanda learned to farm and quilt and
cook. She raised little brothers and sis
ters. I read Anais Nin and Virginia
Woolf, wrote fiery words on the social
justice issue du jour and took myself too
seriously. After high school graduation,
Amanda stayed in Idaho for college; I
came to Stanford.
Amanda and Brigham got engaged a
month after she returned from an 18-
month mission. They'd known each
other about that long. Brigham has a
farm up the road from her father's
farm, she told me. I can't wait to start a
family, she giggled. How funny, her
mother said, that after graduating from
all that college, Amanda will end up a
farmwife, teaching piano lessons to the

neighbors' daughters.
The whole thing makes me sick.
Amanda — strong, smart, talented
Amanda — a farmwife at 23. Every fiber
of my feminist self says that she would
bring so much more to her marriage, to
her children and to herself if she had
some independence. If she'd worked, or
traveled, or lived in a home that wasn't
her father's or her husband's farm. If
she allowed herself some intellectual
challenge outside her family unit.
Amanda's decisions fight so much
that is important to me. Her choices
bewilder and horrify me: to get married
so young to someone she's known only a
short while, to give up any career ambi
tions or further education for house
wifery, to have children while she is
barely more than a child herself. I've
spent my whole life fighting these expec
tations — expectations that Amanda is
perpetuating and expectations she will
bequeath to her daughters.
But my visceral rantings betray my
weakness.
My feminism — the feminism I claim
— is about choices and freedom. It's
about the freedom to serve on the front
lines of battle and the freedom to raise a
child out of wedlock. It's about the free
dom to publish magazines and direct
films and head unions. And it's about

the freedom to have a husband and chil
dren and a farm at 23. The freedom to
lock a college diploma in a drawer and
never touch it again. The freedom to
make the choices Amanda is making
without my scorn and stigmatization.
My self-righteous attempts to cast
Amanda as a traitor to the cause make
me as narrow and dictatorial in my fem
inism as Jean-Jacques Rousseau or
Aristotle are in their misogyny. Today's
feminists speak of choice. It is easy to
respect the choices that advance the
cause of feminism. It is difficult, even
counterintuitive, to respect the choices
that don't. As hard as it is for me to
embrace my cousin's decision with the
same esteem I give to my friends in
medical school, she deserves no less. It
is her right as an autonomous individu
al, and her right as a woman. It is a
right I must protect.
Palatable ideas do not need protec
tion, only unpopular ones do.
This is the lesson I take to Idaho —
the home of neo-Nazis and Klansmen
and many, many Mormon marriages —
to witness Amanda's wedding, to test
my own feminist mettle.

Nazi-lovers. Defenders of the
Klan. For many Americans
these epitaphs are directly
linked to the American Civil Liberties
Union.
Witness the misguided ACLU and its
counter-productive commitment to
blind ideology, they will say: in 1978,
defending the American Nazi Party's
right to march through Skokie, 111., a
Chicago suburb and home to many
Holocaust survivors. Helping a Ku Klux
Klansman preach hate with impunity in
1969. Fighting for an anti-Semitic
priest's freedom to denounce Jews at a
political rally as early as 1949.
How can the good liberal troops of
the ACLU derive any satisfaction, a
sense of victory even, from watching a
parade of Klansmen or reading a neo-
Nazi Internet posting?
I suspect that many ACLU staffers are
in fact sickened by these images, but — in
truth — they have no choice but to defend
them. A group dedicated to upholding free
speech cannot use a screen of its own sen
sibilities, however widely held those views
may be, to filter out the speech it chooses
to defend — not if it expects to credibly
condemn others for repressing words and
ideas deemed offensive by another partic
ular set of sensibilities.
Or, put another way by the ACLU,

"popular and palatable ideas do not
need protection . . . only unpopular and
offensive doctrines do."
I try to remember that as I pack my
good wool suit, my hiking boots, my
down coat. I try to remember as I think
about "attending" to my cousin Aman
da's guest book, whatever attendance it
may require. I tried to remember even as
I cringed at the wedding invitation in my
post office box: a sappy picture of Aman
da and Brigham cuddling for the camera.
I leave for Idaho tomorrow to witness
the extinction of my cousin as I know
her, and the creation of Mrs. Brigham
Parker. To watch her open boxes filled
with Tupperware and bed linens, to
watch her joyously throw her 23-year
old body into her prescribed role in the
most patriarchal of schemes. To give my
tacit ascent to her choice.
And what's worse, I have to like it.
Amanda was always older and better.
Our sadistically competitive grandmoth
er had us competing in geography tour
naments and spelling bees when I was
still in pre-school; Amanda always won.
Amanda ran faster. Amanda played the
piano beautifully, and, unlike me, she
had the dedication to practice every day.
Even Amanda's deficiencies were
somehow turned into personal tri
umphs. At seven, when she quit biting

her nails, Grandma bestowed upon her
an ostentatious pink manicure set Bar
bie would have coveted. (That I never
bit my nails was somehow lost on
Grandma; even at six, my over-devel
oped sense of justice flashed red as I was
reduced to borrowing Amanda's pearl
handled clippers to avoid yet another
lecture on long nails from the sour
piano teacher.)
During high school, Amanda's father
remarried and the family converted to
Mormonism. Amanda moved to a tiny
town in rural Idaho with her family.
Our worlds became very different.
Amanda learned to farm and quilt and
cook. She raised little brothers and sis
ters. I read Anais Nin and Virginia
Woolf, wrote fiery words on the social
justice issue du jour and took myself too
seriously. After high school graduation,
Amanda stayed in Idaho for college; I
came to Stanford.
Amanda and Brigham got engaged a
month after she returned from an 18-
month mission. They'd known each
other about that long. Brigham has a
farm up the road from her father's
farm, she told me. I can't wait to start a
family, she giggled. How funny, her
mother said, that after graduating from
all that college, Amanda will end up a
farmwife, teaching piano lessons to the

neighbors' daughters.
The whole thing makes me sick.
Amanda — strong, smart, talented
Amanda — a farmwife at 23. Every fiber
of my feminist self says that she would
bring so much more to her marriage, to
her children and to herself if she had
some independence. If she'd worked, or
traveled, or lived in a home that wasn't
her father's or her husband's farm. If
she allowed herself some intellectual
challenge outside her family unit.
Amanda's decisions fight so much
that is important to me. Her choices
bewilder and horrify me: to get married
so young to someone she's known only a
short while, to give up any career ambi
tions or further education for house
wifery, to have children while she is
barely more than a child herself. I've
spent my whole life fighting these expec
tations — expectations that Amanda is
perpetuating and expectations she will
bequeath to her daughters.
But my visceral rantings betray my
weakness.
My feminism — the feminism I claim
— is about choices and freedom. It's
about the freedom to serve on the front
lines of battle and the freedom to raise a
child out of wedlock. It's about the free
dom to publish magazines and direct
films and head unions. And it's about

the freedom to have a husband and chil
dren and a farm at 23. The freedom to
lock a college diploma in a drawer and
never touch it again. The freedom to
make the choices Amanda is making
without my scorn and stigmatization.
My self-righteous attempts to cast
Amanda as a traitor to the cause make
me as narrow and dictatorial in my fem
inism as Jean-Jacques Rousseau or
Aristotle are in their misogyny. Today's
feminists speak of choice. It is easy to
respect the choices that advance the
cause of feminism. It is difficult, even
counterintuitive, to respect the choices
that don't. As hard as it is for me to
embrace my cousin's decision with the
same esteem I give to my friends in
medical school, she deserves no less. It
is her right as an autonomous individu
al, and her right as a woman. It is a
right I must protect.
Palatable ideas do not need protec
tion, only unpopular ones do.
This is the lesson I take to Idaho —
the home of neo-Nazis and Klansmen
and many, many Mormon marriages —
to witness Amanda's wedding, to test
my own feminist mettle.
