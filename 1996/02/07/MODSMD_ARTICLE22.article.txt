## Cowboys embody the evils of sports 
### 
A week and a half ago, I
nearly lost my faith. You
see, I'm one of those peo
ple who believes in a higher
power when it comes to sports. I
don't want to say there is a
sports god, but there is some
thing close. To me, there is a
reason why a guy misses a free
throw after the television
announcer proclaims: "Smith is
a perfect 11 -or-11 from the
line." You may call it coinci
dence, but I won't listen — I'm
the guy who wore the same
socks in even,' basketball game
my senior year of high school (I
washed them, though, 1
promise).

On Jan. 28, the higher
authority let me down big time.
If we lived in a perfect sports
world and the sports deity had
been paying attention, the Dal
las Cowboys would not have won
Super Bowl XXX.
This year's installment of
"America's Team" was the epit
ome of all sports evil and,
frankly, made me ill each time I
watched them. I am not being a
sore loser — I have no affiliation
with Pittsburgh and besides, my
team, the Niners, beat the hell
out of the Cowboys in Novem
ber. I simply believe the Cow
boys embody everything that is
wrong with sports today.
I have not always loathed the
Cowboys. 1 had the "Doomsday
Defense" poster in my room and
I actually used to like the 'Boys.
I harbor no ill feelings toward
the Cowboy fans of the late '70s
and '80s. However, I cannot
fathom how someone can root
for the classless organization
that now wears the Super Bowl
crown.
The reasons to hate the Cow
boys are too numerous to list, so
I am going to stick to the basics.
I could weed through the illegal
pick plays, the chop blocks and
the trash-talking. However, one
needs to look no further than
owner Jerry Jones to ascertain
the No. 1 reason why the Cow
boys have become the shameful
club that they are today.
Yes, Jones is a great business
man and a shrewd deal maker.
Yes, Jones has a football back
ground and millions of dollars.
Despite these qualifications,
Jones still has no business in
sports. From the moment he
arrived in Dallas, Jones acted
with a severe lack of decency,

rudely discarding Tom Landry,
perhaps the greatest Cowboy
legend of all.
Many gave Jones the benefit
of the doubt, saying it was time
for Landry to go and that Jones
had no choice in the matter. The
Landry firing, however, was not
an end to Jones' crassness.
Rather, it was a precursor to the
self-serving, egotistical ruthless
ness that Jones continues to dis
play now.
Jones, who, to his credit,
remains consistent over the
years, was exceptionally offen
sive this year. His handling of
Deion Sanders was deplorable.
Obviously, I am not criticizing
Jones for signing Deion, or
implying that Jones was plagued
by a Neon Deion fetish — any
fan would want Sanders on his
or her team. Jones made a criti
cal mistake, though. He sacri
ficed team harmony and interest
for what I believed to be as much
a business deal as a football
transaction. Cowboys fans may
be laughing now, but wait for
the next few seasons when free
agents start fleeing Dallas and
Jones is left with little or no
money under the salary cap to
re-solidify.
What makes the past two
Cowboy teams even more dis
reputable was the addition of ex-
Oklahoma head coach Barry
Switzer. Switzer, who led a
crime-plagued Oklahoma pro
gram to three national champi
onships, leapt at the chance to
work with Jones and the Cow
boys — my guess is because he
didn't have to pay the Dallas
players as much as he had paid
those at Oklahoma. In any
event, no duo since Lucy and
Desi have deserved each other
more Jones and Switzer do.
I know it seems I spend all of
my time rooting against Dallas,
and that's pretty much true.
But what must be realized is
that Jones serves as the finest
example of how a demagogical
owner can ruin a perfectly thriv
ing sports team. True, you could
also make an argument for Art
Modell, A 1 Davis or George
Steinbrenner, but Jones takes
the cake.
I chose the Cowboys as the
representatives of filth in sports
because they have been the most
successful swine over the past
five years. There are two ways
one can enjoy success in sports.
It can be done tastefully and
respectably. Or it can be done
with a haughty arrogance that
spurns thousands of fans.
Among the most successful
teams of my lifetime have been
the Los Angeles Lakers, the
Chicago Bulls, the San Francis
co 49ers, the Detroit Pistons,
the Edmonton Oilers, the


Todd
Bernstein
Toronto Blue Jays and the Dallas
Cowboys. All of these squads
have won at least two consecutive
championships in their respective
sports. Yet two stand out from
the others in regard to the man
ner in which they won.
If you guessed the Cowboys
and the Pistons, you're right.
They both won with little class
and zero humility.
So at this point I tip my cap to
the Cowboys for their accom

plishments on the field, for
there's no doubt they were a
superior team this year. But
watch out, Dallas — what goes
around comes around and your
time is almost up.
I haven't lost my faith yet.
No, I was saved last week by
Mike Montgomery and a scrappy,
yet classy, group of Cardinal hoop
sters that humbled Todd Boze
man and an obnoxious, cocky,
classless group of Cal Bears.
