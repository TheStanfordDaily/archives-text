Stanford! 7

The Stanford men's tennis team extended its
dual-meet winning streak to 32 yesterday after
noon with an easy 7-0 victory over San Jose State
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium. The outcome was
never in doubt, as a more talented Cardinal squad
simply outmuscled the Spartans.
"We are a better team than they are," said head
coach Dick Gould, "but we could have gotten care
less. Instead, the guys stepped it up and tended to
business."
According to Gould, a superior team will often
drop its level of play to that of its opponent.
"Today we really got the job done," he said. "We
did what we had to do and played well."
Sophomores Charles Hoeveler and Ross
Inouye, who ordinarily don't start for the Cardi
nal, earned import ant victories in the fifth and
sixth singles spots, respectively. Hoeveler won his
match in straight sets, 6-1, 6-3. Inouye only
dropped one game on the way to ousting his oppo
nent, 6-1, 6-0.
"It was great to see Charles and Ross step up
when they got the chance to play," Gould said
In the first singles position, senior captain Jeff
Salzenstein won easily, 6-3, 6-0. Salzenstein has
been steadily improving his game over the past few
weeks.
Freshman Ryan Wolters and sophomore Paul
Goldstein also breezed to straight-set victories at
the second and third singles positions. Wolters
upped his dual match record to 4-1 and improved
his overall record to 24-2 on the year. Goldstein,
meanwhile, improved his dual match mark to an
undefeated 5-0 while boosting his overall record to
14-1.
Rounding out the Stanford sweep, senior Ricky
Becker overcame a tight first set in order to win the
fourth singles match 7-6, 6-4. Becker is also unde
feated in dual match play with a record of 5-0.
