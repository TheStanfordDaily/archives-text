Opening the season against a national pow
erhouse isn't an ideal proposition for a pro
gram still trying to gain confidence, but such
was the predicament for the Stanford softball
team last weekend.
Sunday at UCLA's Easton Stadium, the
defending national champion Bruins gave the
Stanford women a reality check in their first
game of the season, handing the Cardinal 2-1
and 11-1 losses in an afternoon doubleheader.
In Sunday's first game, UCLA (4-0 overall,
2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) jumped out to an
early 2-0 lead and then held off the Cardinal
(0-2, 0-2) for the remainder of the game. Bruin
pitcher B'Ann Burns held Stanford to four
hits and one unearned run in seven innings of
work. The Cardinal scored its only run in the
fourth when shortstop Summer Lee reached
base on a UCLA throwing error, then scored
two outs later on a clutch single by freshman
Marcy Crouch.
Sunday's nightcap wasn't quite as close as
the opener. The Cardinal got on the board

first when it took advantage of two first
inning UCLA errors. Lee reached on an error
by Bruin first baseman Alleah Poulsont, then

advanced to third on a
throwing error following
freshman Michelle Schnei
der's single. Left fielder
Kelly Yablonski knocked in
the run with a single to
center.
Stanford's lead was short
lived, however, as the Bru
ins scored runs in the first
and second innings, then
exploded for six hits and

seven runs in the fourth. UCLA hurler Kaci
Clark went the distance, holding the Cardinal
to one unearned run before the game was
called in the fifth due to the conference's 10-
run rule.
Women's Golf: Caroline O'Conner has been
named interim head coach of the Stanford
women's golf team, announced Athletic Direc
tor Ted Leland in a press release last Thurs
day.

O'Conner, a golf instructor at the Academy
of Golf at the PGA National Resort and Spa in
Florida and a former Futures Tour golfing
professional, will take over coaching duties in
place of the hospitalized Tim Baldwin. Bald
win is recovering from stomach surgery he
underwent on Jan. 7 and a subsequent stroke
he suffered on Jan. 9.
Though Baldwin's condition continues to
improve, his estimated recovery time was
judged to be lengthy enough to warrant the
hiring of an interim coach.
"From one point of view, we're sad that
there is a need to hire an interim coach," said
Asst. Athletic Director Debbie Corum, "but
given the circumstances, we're very pleased to
be able to find such a quality person as Caro
line O'Conner on such short notice to run the
program in Tim's place."
Baldwin guided the Cardinal to a fourth
place finish at last year's NCAA champi
onships, duplicating the school's best finish
ever. This season, led by junior Ail-Americans
