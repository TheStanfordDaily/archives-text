# Men's golf takes second place at PING Arizona tournament
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Despite a long winter layoff and limited
practice time, the Stanford men's golf team
showed its rivals at the PING Arizona
Intercollegiate golf tournament this week
that the time away from the greens has
done no harm.
Stanford put forth a solid performance
Monday and Tuesday to finish second over
all at the Tuscon, Ariz., tournament. Host
Arizona took the title, notching a tourna
ment-low 280 team score on the final day to
outpace the field.
"It's a real nice way to open the winter
golf season," said head coach Wally Good
win. "I think it sends a clear message to our
competitors not to write us off too quickly. I
know my guys and, come April, they'll be
tough to beat."
Once again, sophomore All-American
Tiger Woods led the way for Stanford, post
ing a seven-under-par 206 to place second
behind white-hot Ted Purdy of Arizona.
Freshman Joel Kribel trailed by only three
strokes, finishing in a three-way tie for fifth
place. Senior captain Jerry Chang tied for
13th.
"The top three performed very nicely,"
Goodwin said. "Jerry continues to provide
great leadership for this squad."
A lack of consistent depth plagued the
Cardinal once again, with both the fourth
and fifth players struggling throughout the
tournament. At the four spot, however,
senior Darren Dragovich showed some
promise at the end, firing a final-round 74
to keep the team ahead of third-place Texas.
"Darren's play on the last day was defi
nitely one of the bright spots," Goodwin
said. "He really came through for us when

we needed it. It just goes to show that if our
depth holds up, we'll do okay."
A simple lack of preparation time may
have been one of the key problems for Stan
ford this weekend. While most teams have
been practicing throughout the winter hia
tus, heavy rains in the past few weeks have
kept the Cardinal from sharpening its skills.
"We've had very little time to work out
and the times that we have been on the
course, we've been playing in mud," Good
win said. "Given a little more practice, I feel
that we can address some of the more
urgent shortcomings of our game."
The 20th-ranked Cardinal find itself in
unfamiliar territory this season as far as
rankings are concerned. Stanford is cur
rently ranked outside of the top five for the
first time in over three years. Coming off a
second-place finish at the NCAA champi
onships last season, the team is struggling
to find the consistency that made it such a
force in past years. After posting several
strong finishes during the first half of the
season, Goodwin's squad has lapsed into
rough play in several tournaments.
The next few weeks will be the most
telling for the Cardinal, as the team heads
to Hawaii for the John F. Burns Invitation
al, Feb. 21-23, before facing an early test
against a very competitive field at the Golf
Digest Intercollegiate Tournament in
Woodlands, Texas, Mar. 8-10.
And as coach Goodwin will tell you, any
thing can happen over the next three
months. Pacific 10 Conference champi
onships don't begin until April 29 , with the
NCAA championships kicking off May 29 in
Chattanooga, Tenn.
"We've got a long way to go," Goodwin
said. "We are not overly confident, but I
don't think that people have seen enough of
