# Bill could do away with the traditional four-person COP
## Oram to propose single president 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
Council of Presidents member Jon
Oram has authored a hill which would
replace the customary four-person
COP with a single president for the first
time in 26 years.
Oram's bill, a draft of which was ob
tained by The Daily yesterday, comes in
response to increasing concerns about
the inefficiency and gridlock of having
four presidents run the student body.
If passed, the hill would change the
council's composition to one president
with decision-making authority and
three vice presidents with specific du
ties.
"There needs to be debate on this
issue given the structure of the COP,"
said Oram. "There needs to be hierar
chy and structure."
In Oram's draft, the president, as

"the chief representa
tive of the student
body," would oversee
and coordinate all oper
ations of the associa
tion. Currently, COP
members can designate
their own focuses.
The vice presidents
would consist of an exec
utive vice president who

would be responsible for all ASSU busi
ness projects, a vice president for exter
nal affairs who would represent the
ASSU outside the University, and a vice
president for academic affairs who
would oversee all academic matters, the
draft said.
Oram plans to introduce his bill for
discussion at Tuesday's senate meet
ing. After initial debate, the bill must be
discussed at a second meeting and re
ceive approval from two-thirds of the

senate. If approved, the proposal will be
put on this spring's election ballot,
where two-thirds of the student body
must support the measure for it to pass.
COP member Nicole Vazquez said
Oram's views should not be construed
as representative of the entire COP.
"I think the bill has some very posi
tive components, but this strict delega
tion of duties is not healthy," Vazquez
said. "The current system teaches you
skills and how to work in a team situa
tion."
Vazquez also voiced her concern that
a single president would create prob
lems. "I think that this president could
become just a figurehead and a sitting
duck, since they don't have any clearly
defined responsibilities."
()ther senators felt a single president
would help in representing the ASSU.

"Four people creates a lot
more confusion," said graduate
senator Sandeep Singhal, who
has also considered writing legis
lation to reinstate a one-presi
dent system. "It reduces the ef
fectiveness in working with the
administration. Ifyou have a sin
gle focus, you are better able to be
represented."

ASSU Bylaws do not specify
that the COP must be made up of
exactly four people, but that has
been the traditional composition
since 1969. Stanford's unusual
system of four presidents has
been long debated, most recently
in 1994 when then-Senate Chair
Greg Waldorf proposed a bill to
replace the COP with one presi
dent. The bill stalled during sen
ate deliberations.
Many administrators said they
feel the problems with the COP
must be clarified before a solu

tion can be proposed.
"I'm not sure there is a con
sensus of what the problems are,"
said Director of Student Activi
ties Nanci Howe. "We're just at a
beginning point here. There
needs to be more agreement and
consensus."
Dean of Students Marc Wais
said there are pros and cons to
Stanford's unique situation of
four presidents, as opposed to one
figure. "The ASSU has had a con
tinuum of success, but there's al
ways a need for improvement."
