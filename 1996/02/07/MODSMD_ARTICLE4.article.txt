## Transplant patient Jensen's condition upgraded from critical 
### Jason Lada 
Sandra Jensen, believed to be the first person with
Down syndrome to receive a heart-lung transplant,
was upgraded to fair condition on Monday after a
week in critical condition at the Stanford Medical
Center.
According to Medical Center spokeswoman Lau
rel Joyce, Jensen's vital signs are stable. Although
she is still breathing oxygen through a face mask,
Jensen no longer requires a ventilator to assist her
respiration, Joyce said.
The 35-year-old Sacramento resident underwent

the 4 1/2-hour operation two weeks ago, a few days
after finally being placed on the transplant waiting
list.
Both Stanford and UC-San Diego originally re
jected Jensen a year ago on claims that she might not
be able to mentally cope with the stress of possible
post-operative complications. They are the only two
hospitals in the state approved by Medicare to per
form heart-lung transplants.
Jensen sought the transplant because of a cardiol
ogist's warning that she had only two years to live.
Heart problems are often associ
ated with Down syndrome, which
is a genetic disorder caused by
excess genetic material on the
21st chromosome.

Even though 200 people
nationwide are awaiting heart
lung transplants, only 70 such
procedures are performed each
year. Because of the timely dis
covery of a donor with Jensen's
blood type and small organ size,
she was able to avoid the two-year
wait that most transplant
patients endure.
