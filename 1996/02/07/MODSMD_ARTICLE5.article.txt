Sophomore Cecily Bostock presents her project for Mechanical Engineering 101 outside Terman
Engineering Building yesterday. Based on the movie "Toy Story," the project required students to
help "Woody" (a dowel) rescue "Buzz" (an egg) from Sid's destruction table and transport them
across the pond to safety in Andy's toy box.
