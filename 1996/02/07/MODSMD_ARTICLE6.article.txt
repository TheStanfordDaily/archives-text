# No housing for sororities yet
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Although the possibility now exists for sororities
to be housed for the first time since 1944, it will not
occur until the beginning of the 1997-98 academic
year due to logistical concerns, said Director of Stu
dent Activities Nanci Howe.
In her State of Student Affairs address last Octo
ber, Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds announced her intention to assign a
task force to examine various aspects of Stanford's
Greek system, including the issue of sorority hous
ing.
But Edmonds — who has yet to name all of the
committee's members — will not make a final deci
sion on housing eligibility until she hears the task
force's recommendations, Howe said.
Even if Edmonds' task force offers formal sug
gestions this year, it will be too late for the Univer
sity to enact concrete changes for 1996-97, Howe
said.
"Any change that is made to the (University's
Greek housing) policy must be made in early fall in
order to be implemented the following year," Howe
said. "The current issue about sorority housing
must be addressed by the task force" before the ad
ministration can pursue any real changes.
Much of the delay is due primarily to bureau
cratic steps the University will need to take in order
to make sororities eligible for housing, she added.

"This is a major, University-wide policy," Howe
said. "We need to engage in major discussions about
how exactly Greek organizations fit into (Residen
tial Education)."

Edmonds said she has received
the names of eight interested stu
dents from the ASSU Senate Nomi
nations Commission, but that she
must still find additional faculty,
staff and alumni to participate in
the broad-based evaluation of
Greek life.
"I'd rather take longer and do it
right than do it quickly and poorly,"
Edmonds said. "We need to identify
what our weaknesses and strengths

are and then make our weaknesses our strengths."
Once the task force formulates a proposal for
changing the existing policy, Howe said Edmonds
must then consult Res Ed, the Office of Student Ac
tivities and other staff members about the sugges
tions.
After those discussions, Edmonds will then make
the final decision about whether or not to include
sororities in the "grandfather" clause that limits
housing eligibility to 12 fraternities. Only seven fra
ternities are currently housed.
The timetable for making policy changes which
influence Greek organizations, Howe added, is
