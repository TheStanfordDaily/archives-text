# No housing for sororities yet
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Although the possibility now exists for sororities
to be housed for the first time since 1944, it will not
occur until the beginning of the 1997-98 academic
year due to logistical concerns, said Director of Stu
dent Activities Nanci Howe.
In her State of Student Affairs address last Octo
ber, Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds announced her intention to assign a
task force to examine various aspects of Stanford's
Greek system, including the issue of sorority hous
ing.
But Edmonds — who has yet to name all of the
committee's members — will not make a final deci
sion on housing eligibility until she hears the task
force's recommendations, Howe said.
Even if Edmonds' task force offers formal sug
gestions this year, it will be too late for the Univer
sity to enact concrete changes for 1996-97, Howe
said.
"Any change that is made to the (University's
Greek housing) policy must be made in early fall in
order to be implemented the following year," Howe
said. "The current issue about sorority housing
must be addressed by the task force" before the ad
ministration can pursue any real changes.
Much of the delay is due primarily to bureau
cratic steps the University will need to take in order
to make sororities eligible for housing, she added.

"This is a major, University-wide policy," Howe
said. "We need to engage in major discussions about
how exactly Greek organizations fit into (Residen
tial Education)."

Edmonds said she has received
the names of eight interested stu
dents from the ASSU Senate Nomi
nations Commission, but that she
must still find additional faculty,
staff and alumni to participate in
the broad-based evaluation of
Greek life.
"I'd rather take longer and do it
right than do it quickly and poorly,"
Edmonds said. "We need to identify
what our weaknesses and strengths

are and then make our weaknesses our strengths."
Once the task force formulates a proposal for
changing the existing policy, Howe said Edmonds
must then consult Res Ed, the Office of Student Ac
tivities and other staff members about the sugges
tions.
After those discussions, Edmonds will then make
the final decision about whether or not to include
sororities in the "grandfather" clause that limits
housing eligibility to 12 fraternities. Only seven fra
ternities are currently housed.
The timetable for making policy changes which
influence Greek organizations, Howe added, is


Edmonds
highly dependent on Sorority
Rush, which takes place during
spring quarter.
Since sororities would be re
quired to inform prospective
members about the housing sta
tus of their organizations, any de
sired changes to the University's
Greek housing policy would have
to be presented early enough in
the year to give Edmonds a
chance to make her decision be
fore Rush.
Unhoused organizations also
need to rethink their governing
structures and communicate
with leaders of their national
chapters.
Of Stanford's 10 sororities,
only one, Kappa Kappa Gamma,

has submitted a formal housing
request. Delta Delta Delta is now
in the process of drafting its own
request, said sophomore Tri-Delt
Amanda Bardin, one of the eight
students on Edmonds' task force.
Members of both sororities said
that, despite the wait, they remain
both interested and committed to
pursuing housing in (he future.
Kappa President Katie Wells,
a senior, said, "It's basically up to
the sophomores. And since
they've said they're all for it and
think it would be really fun to live
together, [the upperclassmen)
are fully behind them."
Sophomore Kellv Rittenhouse,
also a Kappa, said, "It is absolute
ly ridiculous that fraternities
have housing and sororities
don't. ... I'm personally sur
prised that no gender-equity law
suit has come about."
Although not all sororities

want their own housing, many
women in the Greek community
agree that equality of housingop
portunity is an important ethical
issue, according to Intersorority
Council President Ajna Pisani.
"Many sororities are interest
ed in having housing offered, but
not necessarily I for I their sorori
ties," Pisani said.
Pisani also said another possi
bility is a "sorority lodge" where
all campus chapters would have
access to meeting and storage
space.
Acknowledging that several
women have met with him ex
pressing strong interest in soror
ity housing, Dean of Students
Marc Wais said, "We have a long
history to decipher. Clearly
(Stanford) is one of the few uni
versities in this country where
there are housed fraternities, but
not housed sororities."
