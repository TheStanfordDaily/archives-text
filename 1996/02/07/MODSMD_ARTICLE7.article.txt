### Jeanhee Hong 
Seven student groups will split
a total of $5,000 in grants from
the Student Organization Fund,
which supports groups engaged in
public and community services.
Haas Center directors an
nounced yesterday that the fund,
under the auspices of the
Provost's Office, will provide $785
to Project Asian Initiative for
Youth Minority Enrichment;
$363 to Barrio Assistance; and
$1,775 to the East Palo Alto Stan
ford Summer Academy.
In addition, Alternative Spring
Break will receive $862; Upward
Bound will get $475; Stanford-in-
Government will receive $140;
and Tet Ansamn — which pre

pares students for community
work in Haiti — will be $600 rich
er.
"What's most interesting is
that we've agreed to serve as re
sources for students who are in
volved in community service,"
said John Newsome, campus com
munity organizer at the Haas
Center for Public Service. "We're
partnering with student groups
and helping them assess commu
nity needs, contact appropriate
community leaders and conduct
program evaluations."
The funds, given every winter
and spring quarter for the past
several years, are awarded to stu
dent groups based on numerous
criteria: goals and objectives, ex
perience and stability, effective

planning and the community
needs met by the organization.
The money from the Provost's
Office is allocated by a selection
committee which changes every
quarter. Committee members
represent various sources on
campus that provide funds for
community service, including
the ASSU, the Office of Student
Affairs and various ethnic cen
ters.
"It's a good opportunity to
work with student organizations
and help them think through
their programs, not just disperse
funds," said Suzanne Abel-Vidor,
information officer at the Haas
Center. "We want to have an in
fluence on what they're doing in a
positive way."
Organization leaders were
pleased with the awards.
Brooks Allen, tutor coordina
tor for Upward Bound — an orga
nization that works with high
school students from low-income

backgrounds — said the money is
especially helpful because the
program is federally funded and
t here are restrict ions on how that
funding can be used.
"We're very appreciative of the
funds. It's a great opportunity,
because we have programs that
aren't necessarily included in fed
eral programs, and I the Student
Organization Fundi is campus
money, not federal money, Allen
said.
