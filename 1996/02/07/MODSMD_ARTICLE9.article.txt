Bookstore suffers thefts
In the past two weeks, Stanford Bookstore securi
ty officers apprehended three men in separate inci
dents, all of whom were later charged with felony
theft by the Stanford Police.
On Jan. 31, Bookstore loss prevention officers de
tained Michael Degusta, a former Stanford student
who now lives in Sunnyvale, after seeing him al
legedly steal a book he had hidden the previous day.
The previous night, Degusta was confronted by
Bookstore officials who saw him hide the book, but
since he had not broken the law, they released him,
said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer. Book
store security recognized him the next night and
followed him as he retrieved the hidden book,
which he placed in his backpack along with a pair of
scissors.
Stanford Police later arrested Degusta and
charged him with a felony count of burglary, estab
lishing an intent to steal from his actions of the pre
vious night, Niemeyer said.
Police set bail at $5,000, which was raised and paid
by a group of Degusta's friends living in Naranja.
Had Degusta come in and spontaneously taken
the book and scissors, he would have been charged
only with a misdemeanor, not a felony, Niemeyer
added.
On Jan. 27, a juvenile allegedly hid a magazine
under his jacket and attempted to leave the Book
store without paying for it.
Security officials placed the juvenile — whose

name was not released — under private arrest. How
ever, officers soon discovered that he had two stolen
checks in his possession which he claimed to have
found earlier that day, Niemeyer said.
Stanford Police charged the juvenile with petty
theft and possession of stolen property, a felony, and
released him.
The third recent felony at the Bookstore was al
legedly committed on Jan. '22 by student Jorge Chen,
who police said attempted to use an old receipt to re
turn stolen books for cash.
After sneaking textbooks into his bag, Chen at
tempted to return the stolen books at the customer
service counter, Niemeyer said. Bookstore security
officials apprehended Chen .after he pulled the fraud
ulent receipt out of his bag. Stanford Police charged
him with a felony and released him.
Thieves scale Hike Shop fences
Even high fences apparently could not keep de
termined thieves out of the Campus Bike Shop over
the weekend of Jan. 26-28.
Keith Moranz of the bike shop discovered the fol
lowing Monday that the thieves had taken shop
owned equipment, tools, parts and bikes.
Although Stanford Police were unable to corrobo
rate the incident with any eyewitness accounts,
Niemeyer said investigation determined that robbers
had entered the yard by climbing the fcnce surround
ing the shop. Police have no suspects in the case.
