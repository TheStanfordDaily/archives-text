What the Hell
Is a
Credit Union?
A credit union is a financial institution that is owned and operated by its
members. I sually, members ol a credit union share a common bond, such as
working for the same employer. The credit union prov ides a place where they
can save and borrow safely and conveniently.
Credit unions are not for profit; they exist only to serve their membership. As
a result, they are able to pay high div idends on savings and charge low interest
on loans. After operating expenses and reserve requirements are met, remaining
income is returned to member-owners as div idends.
The first credit union was established in Western Furope in 1849. Today, there
are over 13.500 in the Tinted States, including the Stanford Federal Credit
Union (SFCU), which was established in 1959 and now has over 30,000
members. If you'd like to find out more about us, call ( 11S) 725-1000.
