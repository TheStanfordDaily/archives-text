# In a trend, Biz School pool grows

Reflecting a national trend, the number of appli
cants for the Graduate School of Business duringits
first two admissions rounds increased by more than
10 percent from last year.
The school's admissions committee evaluated
1,458 applications in the first round — a 15 percent
increase over last year — and accepted a little more
than 10 percent of the pool. Applications for the
school's second round of admission, which are cur
rently being evaluated, are also up by approximate
ly 10 percent. A third round of applications will be
considered in the spring.
While the total number of applications will not be
tabulated until mid-March, the current trend indi
cates that Stanford's admit rate will likely fall below
last year's figure of 7.5 percent, which was the low
est rate in the country.
According to Marie Mookini, GSB director of ad
missions, other business schools have also seen
their application pools swell. "Most of the selective
business schools are up an equal percentage, if not
more," she said.
Like most business schools, Stanford employs
a "batched admissions" process, with three appli
cation deadlines. After each deadline, all of the
applications are read and decisions are sent out
in one mailing for that round. This is distin
guished from a rolling admissions process, used
locally at the School of Medicine, in which appli
cations are evaluated and responded to as thev
are received.
The class entering the GSB next fall will consist
of 360 students, most of whom will be accepted in
the first two rounds. "We tend to admit a greater
percentage in the early rounds," said Mookini. "We
are very up front about it."
The admissions committee is currently evaluat
ing second-round applications and will mail accep
tance letters on March 20. The final date to submit
applications for fall matriculation is March 13, and
accepted applicants will be notified after May 29.
Depending on accepted applicants' decisions to
attend the GSB, applicants on the waiting list may
be accepted through the summer.
In order to convince admitted students to attend
Stanford, current GSB students are hosting an
Admit Day this Sunday night and Monday. It will
feature an address by Mookini, a dinner with cur
rent students, various discussion groups addressing
facets of business school life and opportunities to at
tend classes and tour the campus.
"Wehavea lot of great people working for Admit
Day," said I lyun Shin, a second-year student at the
GSB and one of three Admit Day coordinators.
"We are confident that this will be a successful
event."
In past vears, the school has hosted only one
