## Jet plunges into Atlantic No survivors found from 189 passengers aboard plane 
### 
PUERTO PLATA, Dominican
Republic (AP) — A charter jetlin
er carrying German tourists
home from the Caribbean
crashed into shark-infested
waters off the Dominican Repub
lic. There were no signs yesterday
that any of the 189 people aboard
had survived.
Aircraft and boats searching
the Atlantic Ocean off the
Dominican Republic's north
coast spotted bodies, empty life
rafts and debris scattered over
two square miles. At least 79 bod
ies were recovered, but divers
were wary of entering the water.
There was no immediate infor
mation on the cause of the crash
late Tuesday, but the Boeing 757
was substituted at the last
minute. The plane took off in
light rain, then abruptly turned
around and appeared to head back
for land.
Dominican aviation officials
initially reported that the pilot did
not radio the control tower about
any problems. But Gen. Hector

Roman, the director of the coun
try's civil aviation agency, later
said the pilot had radioed that he
was returning to Puerto Plata.
The crew's last message, he
said, was "Stand by."
Roman's account was contra
dicted by an air traffic controller
on duty in the tower yesterday
afternoon and by Maj. Alan Arias
Batlle, a member of a committee
assigned by the country's Civil
Aeronautics Office to investigate
the crash.
"All the communication was
normal," Arias Batlle said. "In no
moment did they speak of an
emergency."
The plane, bound for Frank
furt and Berlin, was owned by a
Turkish company, Birgen Air,
and leased to a Dominican air
line, Alas de Transporte Interna
cional. The German government
said the 757 did not have permis
sion to land in Germany.
Airplanes, boats and heli
copters from Florida, the
Bahamas, the Dominican Repub

lie and Puerto Rico headed to the
crash site, 13 miles north of
Puerto Plata.
U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Lincoln
Benedict in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, said pilots had spotted
sharks in the area of the crash
site.
"The area is shark-infested,"
Benedict said. "It obviously
would hamper recovery of either
survivors or bodies from the
water."
Bodies were being taken to a
pier in Puerto Plata where a half
dozen ambulances and refrigerat
ed trucks awaited. A triage center
was set up in case any survivors
were found.
Four children had been aboard
the plane, and Polish radio
reported that two members of the
Polish parliament had been on
the passenger list.
Seas were relatively calm as the
search continued yesterday morn
ing off the coast of the Dominican
Republic, which shares the island
of Hispaniola with Haiti.
