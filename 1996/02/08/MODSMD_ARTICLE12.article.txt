Mass in a Nicaragua that is making peace with it self and with him,
appearing before 150,000 worshipers yesterday in what the presi
dent called "a blessing from God."

the pontiff hand-in-hand.

shout him down at a Mass until he repeatedly screamed "Silence!"
"This visit has developed in circumstance- very different from
those earlier," the Pope said during t ho Mass.
Chamorro, a devout Catholic, called hi visit a dream come true
and "a blessing from God."
