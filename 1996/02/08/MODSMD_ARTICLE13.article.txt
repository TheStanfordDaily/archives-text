DES MOINES, lowa (AP) — Texas Sen. Phil
Gramm's poor showing among Christian conser
vatives in Ixniisiana sent two rival presidential
campaigns scrambling yesterday to win over
like-minded lowa voters who will be pivotal in
next week's caucuses.
The push by commentator Pat Buchanan,
who beat Gramm in Louisiana, and Senate
Majority Ireader Bob Dole comes at an intriguing
campaign juncture.
Not. only is Gramm's survival in question, but

leading social conservative organizations are
taking aim at multimillionaire publisher Steve
Forbes, who runs second to Dole in lowa and is
head-to-head with him in New Hampshire.
With just four days to lowa's presidential cau
cuses, the Louisiana results served as a reminder
of the clout Christian conservatives have in GOP
affairs. In lowa, GOP officials believe Christian
conservatives will account for perhaps 40 per
cent of those who turn out for Monday's caucus
es.

Dole, Gramm, and Buchanan all have signifi
cant support among these voters, and long-shot
anti-abortion candidate Alan Keyes has a small
following.
After weeks of watching with more interest
than alarm, social conservative leaders are sud
denly hiking note of Forbes.
In the past week, the National Right to Life
Committee and longtime anti-abortion activist
Phyllis Schlafly have warned supporters that
Forbes does not share their views.
