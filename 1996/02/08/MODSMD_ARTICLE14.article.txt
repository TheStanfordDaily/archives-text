SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Baboon bone marrow
implanted ia an AIDS patient to boost his failing
immune system has apparently failed to work, doc
tors said yesterday.
But the AIDS patient, 38-year-old Jeff Getty, is
doing "surprisingly well," perhaps due to chemother
apy, said Dr. Steven Deeks, who performed the trans
plant at San Francisco General Hospital on Dec. 14.
Getty, a former University of California policy
analyst who turned into an AIDS activist when he
discovered he had the disease, said from his Oakland
home that he had always known the chances of suc
cess were not good.
"When I came into this, I rolled the dice," he said.
"I didn't even know if I was going to live through
thing. Now I'm looking forward to a long summer of
sailing."
Bone marrow produces the body's immune sys
tem, and the baboon cells were transplanted into
Getty because the animals do not become infected
with AIDS for reasons biologists still don't under
stand.
The treatment Getty received was designed by Dr.
Suzanne Ildstad at University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center.
