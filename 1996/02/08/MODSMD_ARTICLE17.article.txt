Edmonds cannot keep
procrastinating if she
wants policy changes

TOO OFTEN, IT seems Stan
ford's administration focuses
on alumni or the media when
determining its policies, rather than
soliciting the opinion of those most
affected — the students. In her
State of Student Affairs address last
October, Vice Provost and Dean of
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
emphasized the need for student
input in undergraduate decision
making, committing herself to cre
ating task forces to examine the
alcohol policy, the Greek system and
judicial affairs. Although endeavor
ing to look into these facets of
undergraduate life is commendable,
Edmonds' procrastination under
mines her good intentions.
According to Edmonds, the task
forces are "still in the progress
stage," even though it has been over
three months since she announced
the need to create them. She said it
is doubtful the task committees'
duties will be finished by the end of
this academic year.
The ASSU Nominations Com
mittee — despite its own internal
controversies surrounding nomina
tions — has provided Edmonds
with names of students willing to
represent undergraduates. But the
vice provost said she wants an even
broader representation of under
graduate opinion. To achieve this,
she plans to hold a "town meeting"
for all interested students and dis
tribute a questionnaire to all under
graduate residences.
These plans sound like good ways
to get broad feedback of student
opinion, and her desire to reach a
majority of the student body is
refreshing. With the names of possi
ble student committee representa
tives in hand, it seems that
Edmonds could, at the very least,
begin preliminary task force meet

ings between students and adminis
trators.
The biggest problem with
Edmonds' procrastination has to do
with pertinence. If the committees
cannot meet bv the end of this aca
demic year, then it is unlikely the
committee's duties — surveying the
student body, assembling the infor
mation and deciding on policies that
reflect the wants and needs of both
the students and administration —
will be finished by the end of the
next academic year. If this is the
case, many of the students ques
tioned — this year's juniors and
seniors — will not even be at Stan
ford to participate in the new deci
sions.
Edmonds needs to begin imple
menting the ideas outlined in her
State of Student Affairs address as
soon as possible. Even without task
forces ready immediately, she can
start to gather student opinion
regarding alcohol use and the Greek
system by talking informally to RAs
and fraternity and sorority presi
dents, and distributing question
naires.
With the recent dramatic
increase in honor code and funda
mental standard violations, it is
clear there is a pressing need for
judicial reform. University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper recently
announced his intention to convene
the Committee of 15 — the only
body authorized to make changes to
the University's judicial system —
in order to make the process less
bureaucratic.
Student concerns should be rep
resented in this process, and though
the Committee of 15 has student
representation, Edmonds' commit
tee would have a positive impact.
This is an issue in which Student
Affairs should be taking the lead,
rather than following, in order to
insure that student interests are
kept in mind.
Edmonds needs to focus on con
vening the task forces and it is
imperative she take the initiative,
Edmonds said she wants to "take
time to do it right." Doing it right
means taking less time.
