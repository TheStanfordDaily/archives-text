## John Hall Stanford should give if it expects to get 
### 
Time and time
again, President
Casper has
expressed confusion
over the fact that stu
dents love Stanford and
enjoy their time here,
yet don't participate in
alumni giving after
graduation. In fact, he

has expressed frustration that alumni
tend to "hold the University hostage"
over a single University policy they dis
agree with, even though as a whole they
enjoyed their undergraduate experience
and found it valuable. I'll offer a theory
to explain this quandary: Students are
seldom sought out to help the president
suggest solutions to big issues facing
Stanford as the nation's leading univer
sity.
As president, Casper has a lot of things
to worry about. Come tothink of it,
Provost Condoleezza Rice probably does
too. There's got to be a lot to worry you
when you're trying to manage a multi
billion dollar university for everyone's
benefit.
By the end of each week, the president
and provost have probably spent more
time worrying about what's good for
Stanford than themselves. So Stanford's
achievements and shortcomings probably
become the yardsticks for their personal
success or failure. By worrying about
Stanford, thev make Stanford theirs. And

there's nothing wrong with that. It's
what makes them responsible leaders.
In contrast, students and alumni don't
feel they own Stanford. They obviously
feel sufficiently detached from the Uni
versity as a whole to withhold contribu
tions for what appears to be very specific
and narrow-minded reasons. It seems
unlikely the place they sink so much time
into would mean so little.
Students aren't sufficiently involved
in the big decisions to feel they are
responsible for the University's success.
They've never had to understand the
myriad interests that vie for resources
and attention at the University. They've
never had to make a judgment call
according to "What's Best for Stanford."
They don't see things from the presi
dent's perspective.
How do they see things? As best they
can from their vantage point, which is
often that of a student organization that
feels its success is fundamental to Stan
ford's. This looks parochial and selfish to
folks trying to see the bigger picture.
But you can hardly blame student
activists for their attachment to their
groups' interests. That organization is
what they've been worrying about, where
they've devoted all their energy. They
make sure their organization makes a big
and bright contribution to Stanford life.
To them, that's being responsible mem
bers of the Stanford family.
However, student groups tend to fight

among themselves for a tiny amount of
resources that has nothing to do with the
University, instead of figuring out how
their interests meet with the Universi
ty's. In certain ways, this is beneficial. It
keeps the problems students deal with
small and manageable, so they can gain
experience with real-world issues before
graduation. And it doesn't cause the
headaches that go along with trying to
explain all the varied aspects of the Uni
versity and inviting them to provide an
informed student opinion.
But in the long-run, failing to actively
inform and include students in Stan
ford's bigger issues crushes any sense of
ownership they have for the University.
AH they will care about as alumni are the
little issues they learned to worry about
as students.
The responsibility to fix this problem
lies with all of us. Student leadership in
the ASSU and elsewhere has a responsi
bility to inform itself about what it can
achieve and what students really want.
The president and provost need to wel
come students as intelligent citizens and
seek out their suggestions for even the
most critical issues at Stanford. That act
of asking will do more than anything else
to broaden students' understanding of
what's really important to Stanford's
success.

John Hall is the ASSU Financial Man
ager and a counselor at the Bridge.
