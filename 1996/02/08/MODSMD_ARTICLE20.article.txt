Honor Code violators should be made public

STANFORD SHOULD MOVE
beyond issuing annual statistical
summaries of Honor Code and
Fundamental Standard violations by
routinely publishing the names of all
those found guilty of violating its rules
of campus conduct. Disclosure should
apply equally to students, faculty and
staff.
This is the best means of educating
the community about Stanford's stan
dards, maintaining the credibility of the
university's own disciplinary procedures,
and — most important — preserving the
good names of those who spend
$100,000 and four years to get a degree.
learning from mistakes is an impor
tant part of education — both for individ
uals and for the community. Several years
ago, when a law student repeatedly called
a publicly gay staff member "faggot," the
University went public. The resulting
flood of commentary educated thousands.
Had the homophobe's target been another
student, everything most likely would
have been decided behind closed doors.

Students, faculty and staff should be
warned in advance that upon a finding of
guilt, their names will become public,
along with a summary of the charges,
the investigation, the sanctions and any
response from those deemed guilty. In
this response, the guilty party may be
contrite, defiant, cite extenuating cir
cumstances, affirm their innocence or
remain silent.
Stanford followed this practice in
more than a dozen faculty disciplinary
cases in the 19605, '70s, and early '80s,
with salutary results. The institution,
and the individual involved, usually took
one hard shot in the headlines and then
moved on with their lives.
Then campus lawyers — and defense
attorneys — decided to say only that
professors had been "disciplined." That
left the grapevine free to strangle indi
vidual reputations in cases ranging from
plagiarism to sexual harassment. In sev
eral instances, those who filed charges
were never told the outcome. Statistical
briefs, secrecy and rumor do not work

well in an institution committed to the
open search for truth.
It is far better to be up front and pub
lic. Knowing that rule breakers will be
publicly identified provides an incentive
for students and others to learn more
about campus judicial systems. It may
even deter some misbehavior. In some
instances, publicity alone may suffice as
discipline.
In an increasing number of high pro
file alumni cases — mayoral, gubernato
rial and presidential aspirants, for exam
ple — there is a legitimate public inter
est in knowing whether or not an indi
vidual was guilty of academic miscon
duct. So long as in loco parentis and pri
vacy prevail, individual reputations will
remain at risk.
In the 1980s, more than 20 under
graduates were accused and over a dozen
found guilty of cheating in an introduc
tory psychology class. Since the universi
ty does not name those found guilty,
does not disclose the courses individuals
take and has dozens of cases of con-

firmed cheating every year, there simply
is no way ever to clear the innocent.
Students are not the only ones who
violate the academic code, of course.
Three of my family members have had
their academic work plagiarized by pro
fessors at Stanford, Yale and other uni
versities.
Academic institutions clearly have a
right to know whether prospective stu
dents, faculty or staff have ever been
found guilty of plagiarism or other aca
demic offenses, but they have no certifi
able way of finding out. Only recently
have physicians, lawyers, stockbrokers
and other professional groups begun to
recognize their own interest in having
those found guilty of malpractice named
publicly.
Until Stanford strips away its shroud
of secrecy, anonymous cheaters will con
tinue to cast a cloud over the reputations
of their colleagues and the University
itself.
