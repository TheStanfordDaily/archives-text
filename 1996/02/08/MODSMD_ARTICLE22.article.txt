# Josh Gohlke: Laughing leads to crying
## My weekend in hell with Seinfeld and Jesus 
### 
Hope is insidious, ignorant, persis
tent, ridiculous. And despite all
the weekends of the past month, I
allowed awful optimism to color my per
ception again, and approached the end of
last week with cheerful abandon and an
unawareness of the possibility that the
ultimate confirmation of my shitty atti
tude might be imminent.
• My options seemed, if not terrific, tol
erable, and if not manifold, twofold. I
could stay here at Stanford and repeat
my grueling but always enjoyable Friday
to-Sunday deviation-guilt cycle, or I could
go home to Los Angeles and pretend
something would be different there.
Let me repeat once more what I
thought were the existing geographical
choices: 1) Palo Alto and 2) Los Angeles.
I thought I had tentatively decided on the
latter, and was well on my way by Thurs
day afternoon. However, something in
hiy car called the "torque converter"
opted to effect a compromise in the form
of a third, unconsidered locale.
This third locale, at which my torque
converter — in what I've been assured

was, mechanically speaking, a very
uncommon turn of events — utterly
failed forcing me to remain 24 hours
longer than I expected, lies uncannily
close to the exact midpoint between the
Bay Area and Los Angeles.
Coalinga probably wouldn't mean
much to you. But you know that place off
1-5, when you lunge to roll up the win
dow, but you're never quick enough to
keep out the stench, and all you can see
outside are miles and miles of cows?
That's Coalinga. That's where I spent
half of my weekend.
The first thing I learned after my car
broke down was that the American Auto
mobile Association is merely a trans
portation service.
"I don't work on 'em," the fat guy with
a mustache told me. "I just tow 'em."
"Well, here's where I want you to tow
it," I said. "It's a town about 200 miles
south of here, and it's called Los Angeles."
He said instead he could take my car to
either a garage where they knew what
they were doing, but were probably
closed, or a gas station where they didn't

know what they were doing, but were
probably still open. I said, "Take me to
the one that's open."
It was closed.
There were two motels at the inter
change where I was stranded, but neither
would take a check. The only cash
machine was in Carl's Jr., I learned.
The "cash machine" didn't dispense
cash, though; it printed out a "cash
coupon" (maximum $40) which had to be
surrendered to the greasy little guy at the
register.
"A purchase is required," he told me.
"All right, I'll have a small fries."
I took my $39.04 and went to McDon
ald's just to spite him. Then I bought a
six-pack of Budweiser and checked into a
motel. I watched "Seinfeld." It was pretty
funny, if you like that kind of thing.
I called my most recent ex-girlfriend
from my motel room phone, because I
wanted to tell her that I was stuck in the
center of central California and that I
still hated her. She wasn't home.
The next morning, the man at the gas
station messed around for a couple of

hours before confessing, "Come on, I
don't know anything about cars!"
Meanwhile, a long-haired burn-out
stuck at the station wanted to talk, but
only about how the place smelled.
"So, where were you coming from?" I
ventured.
"Man, this place stinks like shit, huh?"
he replied.
"I'm going to L.A."
"Did you ever smell a place so fuckin'
bad?"
Finally, another fat guy with a mus
tache had to tow me to a Chevrolet dealer
in the actual town of Coalinga. I spent
the entire 13-mile ride trying to figure
out whether he was the same fat guy with
a mustache who had towed me to the gas
station.
A huge sign at the town limits reads,
"JESUS IS LORD OF COALINGA."
Looking at the place, I was forced to con
clude that Jesus is the worst goddamned
mayor ever.
The shifty service manager at the deal
ership told me that my car's "gizmo" was
broken, and it would take until the fol

lowing week to obtain the necessary
"stuff' to replace it.
While I was waiting for him to come to
that conclusion, I listened to my Disc
man. A song called "Two States" by Pave
ment came on. The song advocates divid
ing California into a northern and a
southern state. I imagined the whole plan
falling apart because neither side would
agree to take Coalinga.
The Coalinga library has two white
chairs, the outsides of which look like
halves of egg shells, very much like the
thing Mork used to sleep in. I fell asleep
in one of them for a couple hours.
Finally, on Friday evening, my altruist
tic high school girlfriend arrived to pick
me up and take me to Los Angeles. She
has never looked more beautiful.
My car is still in Coalinga, and I'm not
sure if I'll ever be able to retrieve it.
Maybe Jesus can use it to get the hell
out.
