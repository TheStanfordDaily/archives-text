## Class of '96 Football gains new weapons 
### Todd Bernstein Editorial staff 
Coming off one of its best seasons in recent
years, the Stanford football team added some new
faces to its steadily improving squad. Head coach
Tyrone Willingham announced yesterday the sign
ing of 20 recruits for the upcoming season.
rhe rec ruiting class, which Willingham charac
teristically refrained from lauding, consists of 18
high school student-athletes and two transfers.
The class is well-balanced, as the Cardinal recruit
ed 10 offensive and 10 defensive players.
"It's not in our nature to hype a recruiting
class," Willingham said. "We're very happy about
the group of young men we have coming to Stan
ford. Wo are very positive about the quality of the
class and we think it's just another stop towards
building our program."
While the split between offensive and defensive
players was even, the defensive recruits are gar
nering more publicity. The emphasis on the defen
sive class, which consists of five defensive linemen,
four linebackers and one defensive back, was no
accident.
I The class] is obviously dominated by defen
sive players, which was our focus heading into the
recruiting eason," Willingham said. "One of our
main goals was to improve our lot defensively. We
signed four linebackers and have more defensive
lineman to work with than in recent years."
Included in the stock of defensive linemen are
6-3, 235-pound, Riall Johnson; 6-5, 250-pound,
Sam Bonner; 6-5, 255-pound Dorean Kass; 6-5,
260-pound, Willie Howard and 6-3, 245-pound,
Jim Telesmanich. With the exception of Teles
manich, each earned Ail-American honors in high
school The talented group may be called on to pro
vide' immediate help on the Cardinal defensive
front, a sometimes problematic area in 1995.
On the offensive side of the line, Willingham
acted as N<ah, herding in position players two-by
two Stanford added two quarterbacks, two run
nin f back , two tight ends and two wide receivers
to their arsenal, as well as Blaine Maxfield, an
offensive lineman and Aaron Focht, who plays
both wide receiver and running back.
Those offensive players receiving high school
All-American honors include
tight end Steve Coughlin (who
was also named Super Prep
National Player of the Year),
quarterback Todd Husack and
Deßonnie Pitts, a wide-receiver
from Saginaw, Michigan.
Rather than basking in the
success of another recruiting
year, Willingham is already
focusing on the future — improv
ing on the Cardinal's 7-4-1 record
in 1995, a record good enough to
earn a berth in the St. Jude's Lib
erty Howl.
"Our job now is to develop
these students-athletes into qual
ity Pacific 10 Conference play
ers," Willingham said. "I'm excit
ed about this class and the poten
tial they bring to the Stanford
football program."
As usual, Stanford's recruiting
efforts swept the nation in search
of talent. Athletes from 12 states
will make their way to the Farm
next fall, including six from Cali
fornia, two each from Michigan,
Washington and Utah and one
each from Connecticut, Ohio,
Virginia, Georgia, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey and Texas.
