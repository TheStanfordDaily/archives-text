# Stanford sets its sights for the weekend
## Hot-shooting guard Dion Cross takes aim at the Trojans 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Taking a quick look around
campus, one can see many cher
ished objects of art. However, one
of these campus treasures was
missing earlier this year, causing
no end to the dismay of Cardinal
basketball fans.
No, the statue of Hank Luiset
ti had not been stolen from
Maples Pavilion. Senior sharp
shooter Dion Cross had lost his
trademark three-point shot and
the Cardinal (13-5 overall, 6-3 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) was
worrying about salvaging what
was supposed to be the greatest
season in school history.
But not to worry — the shot
has returned and will once again
be on display at Maples tonight at
7:30. The USC Trojans (11-10, 4-
5) are the guests of honor at the
Dion Cross Museum of Flight
please watch out for deadly pro
jectiles.
The Trojans are already in a
jettison state of mind, as USC
fired second-year coach Charlie
Parker yesterday because of a
lack of development on what Tro
jan officials called a "talented"
squad.
First-year assistant Henry
Bibby takes over for Parker on an
interim basis. Parker was famil
iar with that term last year when
he succeeded George Raveling
after Raveling retired prior to the
start of the season. The Trojans
were 7-21 last year and lost nine
of their last 14.
With USC's 84-80 victory over
Stanford four weeks ago sticking
in the Cardinal's collective craw,
revenge is on the minds of the
players, especially Cross. He
missed 12 of 16 shots against the
Trojans in one of Stanford's most
frustrating losses of the season.
A 45 percent three-point
shooter over his first three years
at Stanford, Cross struggled from

beyond the arc during the first 12
games as the Cardinal struggled
to find an identity. During that
stretch, Cross connected on only
38 percent of his field goals and
36 percent of his three-pointers.
A scary truth then presented
itself — when Cross is missing,
Stanford is hurting. An 8-4
record had the Cardinal worried
about the postseason, especially
with sophomore center Tim
Young out indefinitely with a
bulging disk in his back. The loss
to USC started a remolding of the
team that would not be complet
ed until after a loss to Washing
ton two weeks ago.
"In the early part of the sea
son, I was putting too much pres
sure on myself, this being my last
year," Cross said. "With Tim out,
we were all pressing harder. Win
ning eases all the tension. After
Washington, we all got together
and talked about it. We came
together and it shows on the
court."
As for his own shooting woes,
Cross knew that he just had to
work through the down time.
"It's a mental thing," he said.
"When a shooter is in a funk,
everybody tells you 'do this, do
that.' I just shoot — I don't think
about the release or the rotation.
That's what coach [Jeff] Jackson
said to me — 'Don't think, just
shoot it."'
Since the loss to USC, that's
exactly what he has done — 55
percent from the field and 47 per
cent from three-point land. The
confidence has returned, the
swagger running down the court
after a back-breaking three once
again haunts the hardwood at
Maples Pavilion. He has raised
his scoring average to 15.8, sec
ond on the team, and the Cardi
nal has worked itself back into
the polls at No. 25.
