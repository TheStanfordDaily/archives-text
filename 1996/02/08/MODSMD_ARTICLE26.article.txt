The sun finally shone on the
third-ranked Stanford women's
tennis team in its match against
Fresno State on Tuesday. The
1996 season had produced numer
ous rain delays, one cancellation,
and generally cold, windy match
es, but the weather finally man
aged to be as good as the unde
feated Cardinal squad, which ran
its dual-match record to 5-0.
The same, however, could not
b<> said for the Bulldogs, as the
Cardinal pulled off a clean sweep
of the opposition, taking all nine
matches without losing a set.
Stanford achieved the victory, the
squad's second-straight shutout,

with several key players out of the
line-up.
Academics, rather than injury,
was the reason for the changes.
Five Cardinal players are current
ly in Dallas, competing in the
Rolex Indoor championships and
had to miss some of Tuesday's
match in preparation for their
absence. The No. 2 and No. 5 sin
gles players, junior Katie
Schlukebir and sophomore Julie
Scott, respectively, were absent
from the singles competition,
while the No. 1 doubles pair of
Schlukebir and sophomore Ania
Bleszynski also missed the action.
Junior Emily Burt and senior
Wendy Sacks were added to the
singles competition at the No. 5
and No. 6 spots, while junior San
dra De Silva, senior Kim Shasby,
and senior Amy Chiminello moved
up into the No. 2-4 positions. In
doubles action, Sacks formed a
pair with sophomore Heidi Stalla
to fill the void left by Schlukebir
and Bleszynski. Sacks and Stalla

competed as the No. 3 team, with
the nationally-ranked team of
Scott and Shasby at the No. 1 spot,
and Chiminello and Burt at No. 2.
The most exciting match of
the day occurred at the No. 1 sin
gles position when Bleszynski and
Dora Djilianova battled for domi
nance. The first set was closely
contested, as the score went back
and forth until Bleszynski got an
important service break to allow
her to take the set, 6-4.
"I had never heard of her
before," Bleszynski said. "In the
first set, all the games were really
close."
Bleszynski finally got a feel for
the competition in game four of
the second set. She finished the
game with a powerful overhead to
even the set 2-2. From that point
on Bleszynski appeared to have
full control of the match, taking
points from Djilianova at will.
Bleszynski jumped out to a 5-2
lead in the set with dazzling shots
that Djilianova could only watch
bounce into the corners of the
court. Djilianova fought back,
winning the next two games, but
Bleszynski came back with a com
manding service game to win the
match, 6-4, 6-4.
"I felt pretty good," Bleszynski
said. "I didn't feel great because I
had some lapses. I got a little bit
more tentative fat the end of the
second set], and (Djilianova)
played well."
In other singles action, De
Silva took a straight set-victory,
6-0, 6-1, from Liz Marpuri, while
Shasby defeated Anne Castro, 6-
0, 6-2, and Chiminello cruised to
victory over Laura Townsend, 6-
1,6-1.
Reserves Burt and Sacks
proved that they could hold their
own against the competition.
Burt encountered Fresno State's
Terje Pallo and after a close 6-4
first set ran away with the match
in a 6-1 second set. Sacks also
earned a clean victory over Kan
dus Creighton, 6-3, 6-1.
Fresno State faired no better
in doubles competition. Scott and
Shasby earned a 8-1 victory over
Djilianova and Pallo while Burt
and Chiminello plowed over
Marpuri and Townsend by the
same score. Even the newly
paired doubles team of Sacks and
Stalla had no trouble with the
Bulldogs.
"We started out a little shaky,"
Stalla said. "We've never played
together in a match. They were
good but were more erratic."
