Sick of reading about the Cowboys in this
space? So am I. Of course, if my team was
winning it all, I'd probably tell you about it
every week, too.
Speaking of winning it all, notice the last time a
Stanford squad won an NCAA title, yours truly was
editing this sports section. I hope there's no con
nection, because Lou Campanelli has a better
chance of regaining his old job than do I.
At least my old job is in capable hands. But Cam
panelli's spot is occupicd by our good friend Todd
Bozeman. After watching Cal twice within the past
week, it's safe to say that an long as he's around the
Bears won't have to worry about keeping the last
weekends of March available.
Bozeman recruits talented players — maybe too
many of them. Players look over their shoulders
after they make mistakes because Bozeman yanks
in a hurry. While this comes in handy when Pren
tice McGruder is picking up one foul every 18 sec
onds, nobody wins championships without some
continuity. Playing defense helps too.
Some other things to ponder:
• Does George Raveling say "Pentice McGuder"?
• Best fan display in a while: The Maples crowd
jingling car keys in honor of Cal's Tremaine
Fowlkes at the charity stripe. With Fowlkes, foul
shots aren't the only thing that are free.
• Remember how this was a "year of change" for
Stanford women's basketball? Losing four key
members of the rotation and three coaches and
adding no recruits, the only change this year has

been that Stanford is running away with the Pacif
ic 10 Conference title instead of clinging to a slim
lead throughout February.

Amy Tucker, Marianne Stanley and the Cardi
nal are 16-2 overall, 9-0 in the Pac-10 and ranked
higher than they have been all season (fourth in
the AP, third in the coaches' poll). Meanwhile, the
three teams behind Stanford are bunched at 6-3
and play each other this weekend. Should Stanford
win through its next home game (Feb. 15 vs. No. 16
Oregon State), the Cardinal will have, for all
intents and purposes, wrapped up the Pac-10
crown with three weeks left to go.
Still, the last several games will remain impor
tant. If 17-1 last year wasn't good enough for a No.
1 seed, Stanford may actually have to win out to get
the top spot in the West. However, with a ton of
