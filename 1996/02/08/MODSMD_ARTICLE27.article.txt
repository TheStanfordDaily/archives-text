# The 						world according to Stoner

### 
Sick of reading about the Cowboys in this
space? So am I. Of course, if my team was
winning it all, I'd probably tell you about it
every week, too.
Speaking of winning it all, notice the last time a
Stanford squad won an NCAA title, yours truly was
editing this sports section. I hope there's no con
nection, because Lou Campanelli has a better
chance of regaining his old job than do I.
At least my old job is in capable hands. But Cam
panelli's spot is occupicd by our good friend Todd
Bozeman. After watching Cal twice within the past
week, it's safe to say that an long as he's around the
Bears won't have to worry about keeping the last
weekends of March available.
Bozeman recruits talented players — maybe too
many of them. Players look over their shoulders
after they make mistakes because Bozeman yanks
in a hurry. While this comes in handy when Pren
tice McGruder is picking up one foul every 18 sec
onds, nobody wins championships without some
continuity. Playing defense helps too.
Some other things to ponder:
• Does George Raveling say "Pentice McGuder"?
• Best fan display in a while: The Maples crowd
jingling car keys in honor of Cal's Tremaine
Fowlkes at the charity stripe. With Fowlkes, foul
shots aren't the only thing that are free.
• Remember how this was a "year of change" for
Stanford women's basketball? Losing four key
members of the rotation and three coaches and
adding no recruits, the only change this year has

been that Stanford is running away with the Pacif
ic 10 Conference title instead of clinging to a slim
lead throughout February.

Amy Tucker, Marianne Stanley and the Cardi
nal are 16-2 overall, 9-0 in the Pac-10 and ranked
higher than they have been all season (fourth in
the AP, third in the coaches' poll). Meanwhile, the
three teams behind Stanford are bunched at 6-3
and play each other this weekend. Should Stanford
win through its next home game (Feb. 15 vs. No. 16
Oregon State), the Cardinal will have, for all
intents and purposes, wrapped up the Pac-10
crown with three weeks left to go.
Still, the last several games will remain impor
tant. If 17-1 last year wasn't good enough for a No.
1 seed, Stanford may actually have to win out to get
the top spot in the West. However, with a ton of

upsets (both the top-25 and top
-10 teams in the women's polls
sport more losses than their coun
terparts in the men's polls) and
fewer "dominant" teams, Stan
ford may be in better position
than last year. Stay tuned.
• Former Heisman Trophy win
ners at USC are gaining a lot of
notoriety these days. Let's see,
Charlie Parker goes 7-21 overall
and 2-16 in the Pac-10 last year
and gets the interim removed
from his label. This year, the Tro
jans are 11-10 and 4-5 and he gets
the ax. Under Athletic Direc
tor running back Mike Garrett,
USC doesn't seem to be very good
at handling basketball coaches.
And, as you should know, I don't
mean just men's basketball
coaches.
What does it mean? Tonight at
Maples should be interesting.
Garrett must have landed nice

guy Paul Westphal to be back on a
bench next year. But why fire
Parker now at the midpoint ol
a moderately successful season?
Was Garrett scared the Trojans
would enjoy more success later
and that he wouldn't be able to
lire Parker later on? If so, that's a
strange reason to fire somebody
because you're afraid he'll be
too good but why not wait until
the end of the season?
The last time a Pac-10 coach
was fired in mid-season, Todd
Hozeman took Cal to the region
als. But that was different; Cal
had a ton of underachieving tal
ent (sound familiar?). Plus, no
clear successor was in the wings
(obviously) and Hozeman is still
around. Here, Westphal must be
the next coach or Garrett really
needs his head examined (unless
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the gu\
remember that rumor after
Raveling's accident?). Still, firing
Parker now, then replacing him
with interim coach Henry Bibby
and then firing Bibby when West
phal comes aboard with new

assistants seems, well, dumb. And
don't get me started about Cheryl
Miller. Now you see what Mari
anne Stanley was putting up with
in L.A.
• Basketball season mirrors
football season in the Pac-10.
Once again, from top to bottom
it's tough to find a more solid
group of teams. But if you check
out the top 15 in the polls, you
find no more than one team from
the conference (in men's hoops,
nobody). When tourney time rolls
around, this means fewer berths
for the Pac-10. I'd guess four
iipiece in the men's and women's
tourneys, and less-t.ban-satisfying
seeds for most involved.
The big drop-off between tin'
fourth and fifth teams is huge as
well — if you think the Washing
ton men will slip (as I do). Right
now, in the women's standings 6-
3 and 4-5 is the difference
between a three-way tie for sec
ond and a four-way tie for fifth.
With less-t.han-scintillating non
conference records or schedules, 1
doubt any of the 4-5 teams can

sneak in (Arizona has the best
shot) I just hope the 6-3 squads
don't crumble, since the SEC will
probably scarf seven of the at
large bids with its ranked teams
in the coaches' polls. Also, the
Pac-10 is one of just two leagues
with no tourney, and while that's
OK, it doesn't give bubble teams a
second chance.
• Don't look now, but Stanford
may end up with a sweep of the
Pac-10 Coach of the Year awards
for major sports. Half the season
remains, but if Bob Bender's
Husky men slip and Harold
lihodes's Washington State
women don't go crazy, the Cardi
nal's chances are pretty. Amy
J'ucker and Marianne Stanley
should be shoo-ins on the
women's side and Mike Mont
gomery would be the best bet if
Stanford can duplicate its first
half success.

It was Todd's first column, and
he hud to purge the evils of Vol
ume 208. But no more Cowboys —
or Bulls.
