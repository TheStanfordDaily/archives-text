# They know the way to San Jose
## Men's gymnastics takes on BYU, San Jose State 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
The Stanford men's gymnas
tics team (4-1-0), ranked eighth
nationally and fourth in the West,
will take on San Jose State and
BYU this weekend in San .Jose.
According to Stanford head
coach Sadao Hamada, the Spar
tan team is not of Stanford cal
iber. However, the tournament
will be a good chance for the Car
dinal to gauge its ability.
Stanford beat San Jose State
by a full 20 points three weeks ago
at the San Jose State Open, but
lost the match to California. The
battle against BYU, though, may
prove a bigger challenge. BYU is
ranked 15th nationally and fifth
in the West.
This tournament is only one of
the many along the way to the
NCAA championships. Hamada
stressed that outcomes were not
his focus at this point in the sea
son.
"My concern is not winning or
losing — it is improvement from
three weeks ago," he said. "Cer
tain guys have to improve certain
areas and I see them in practice,

hut seeing in practice and seeing
in competition are two different
things."
Hamada has his eye on the big
prize and the little wins and loss
es along the way are unimportant

My concern is not
winning or losing —
it is improvement.'

"as long as (he) pull(s) in three
veiy good scores to qualify for the
Western Kegionals and place in
the top three there."
Only the West's top six teams,
determined by the average of the
team's top three scores of the sea
son, will advance to the Western
Kegionals. The best three teams
at the regionals move on to the
NCAA tournament. Therefore,
this weekend's tournament is just
one in the improvement process.
The team already has three
solid gymnasts in sophomore Tim
Dalrymple, junior Keith Wiley
and junior Jamie Ellis. However,

the team needs one more gymnast
to come through and round out
the scoring, which is a combina
tion of the top four scores.
"Somebody else has to come up
and post that fourth big score,"
Hamada said. He added that the
performances of the other gym
nasts, such as junior lan
Bachrach, red-shirt freshman
Jeremy Herman, sophomore
Clarence Miao and senior Peter
Hegi, will be key.
Dalrymple is ranked third in
the NCAA and second in the
West. However, Dalrymple will
face the first-ranked gymnast in
the West, Darren Elg of BYU, this
weekend.
Wiley also has received recog
nition from the NCAA, ranking in
at 19th nationally and ninth in
the Western.
"There is no doubt we can beat
San Jose State, and I haven't
started to find out about BYU.,"
Hamada said. "If it was important
to beat them 1 would study more
about their team."
Currently, internal improve
ments are the top priority for this
team en route to a repeat as
NCAA champion.
