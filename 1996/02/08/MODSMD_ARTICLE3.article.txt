# Cheating data not worrisome
## No need to panic, Casper says

University administrators
downplayed the significance of a
report indicating that the number
of students violating the Honor
Code last year rose sharply from
1993-94.
University President Gerhard
Casper — who has recently been
vocal about his desire to reform
the judicial system — said yester
day that he believes the recent in
crease is unfortunate hut not epi
demic.
"I do not think that it is any
reason for alarm," Casper said.
"We will never have zero (viola
tions) because in any society there
will be people who will not play by
the rules, but I obviously hope
that the number will go down."
Tuesday's report from the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs detailed a
62 percent increase in the number
of reported I lonor Code violations
during the 1994-95 academic
year. The jump follows on the
heels of a 20 percent decrease in
reported violations between the
1992-93 and 1993-94 academic
years.
But Casper said his stated
commitment to reform the judi
cial system — one he has called
"overly bureaucratic" and "cum
bersome" — is not related to the
release of this week's report. "I
am concerned with the process,
not the small number of viola
tions," he said.

Currently, students who are
charged with violations of the
Honor Code or Fundamental
Standard have the option of de
ciding whether their cases are
heard strictly by an administrator
at the Dean of Students' office or
hy a council composed of four stu
dents and four faculty members.

Last year, how
ever, only one of
the 60 cases of al
leged miscon
duct was heard
by the council.
"My concerns
about the judi
cial system had
nothing to do
with the report,"
Casper said. "It

has nothing to do with deterrence
or anything like that."
A large percentage of students
who violated the code cheated in
one of the science disciplines.
"There's greater pressure than
ever for Stanford students to
excel," said Dean of Students
Marc Wais. "A lot of students who
want to get into the very best
graduate and professional schools
put pressure on themselves to do
exceedingly well."
In addition to the increased
pressure, Wais said many inter
national students are not aware
of what is considered inappropri
ate and accidentally violate the
Honor Code.
