# Cheating data not worrisome
## No need to panic, Casper says 
### Richard Engel Contributing writer 
University administrators
downplayed the significance of a
report indicating that the number
of students violating the Honor
Code last year rose sharply from
1993-94.
University President Gerhard
Casper — who has recently been
vocal about his desire to reform
the judicial system — said yester
day that he believes the recent in
crease is unfortunate hut not epi
demic.
"I do not think that it is any
reason for alarm," Casper said.
"We will never have zero (viola
tions) because in any society there
will be people who will not play by
the rules, but I obviously hope
that the number will go down."
Tuesday's report from the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs detailed a
62 percent increase in the number
of reported I lonor Code violations
during the 1994-95 academic
year. The jump follows on the
heels of a 20 percent decrease in
reported violations between the
1992-93 and 1993-94 academic
years.
But Casper said his stated
commitment to reform the judi
cial system — one he has called
"overly bureaucratic" and "cum
bersome" — is not related to the
release of this week's report. "I
am concerned with the process,
not the small number of viola
tions," he said.

Currently, students who are
charged with violations of the
Honor Code or Fundamental
Standard have the option of de
ciding whether their cases are
heard strictly by an administrator
at the Dean of Students' office or
hy a council composed of four stu
dents and four faculty members.

Last year, how
ever, only one of
the 60 cases of al
leged miscon
duct was heard
by the council.
"My concerns
about the judi
cial system had
nothing to do
with the report,"
Casper said. "It

has nothing to do with deterrence
or anything like that."
A large percentage of students
who violated the code cheated in
one of the science disciplines.
"There's greater pressure than
ever for Stanford students to
excel," said Dean of Students
Marc Wais. "A lot of students who
want to get into the very best
graduate and professional schools
put pressure on themselves to do
exceedingly well."
In addition to the increased
pressure, Wais said many inter
national students are not aware
of what is considered inappropri
ate and accidentally violate the
Honor Code.

"Some students, based on
their cultural backgrounds,
aren't aware of acts considered
inappropriate here in the
States," he said.
Eric Roberts, director of educa
tional affairs for the Computer
Science department — which had
nine reported violations, the most
of any department — said he was
surprised that the department did
not account for even more of the
violations.
"I would have expected more,"
he said, adding that at some col
leges, computer science students
account for over half of reported
cheating incidents. "In some ways
it's so easy to cheat," he said,
pointing out that many students
try to hide answers in secret files
on their computers.
"The answers are already
there," Roberts said. "It's very
tempting."
Sophomore Andrew Blachman,
a nominee toa University commit
tee poised to re-examine the re
view process for alleged Honor
Code and Fundamental Standard
offenders, said he wasn't surprised
by the increase.
"I think students put a lot of
pressure on themselves and will do
anything to do well," he said.
Blachman also wondered whether
some students might at times
overlook the rules with their
sights set on graduate school ad
missions.
'Almost every student I talk to
seems to be planning on going to
some kind of graduate school and I
think that it motivates them to
cheat," Blachman said.
