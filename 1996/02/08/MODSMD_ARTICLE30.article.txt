# Allen discusses race, career

### Dana Hangai Contributing writer 
In a discussion ranging from
one of the worst naval mutinies in
U.S. history to the civil rights bat
tles of today, author Robert L.
Allen spoke in a presentation at
Branner Hall last night.
Allen, author of "The Port
Chicago Mutiny" and co-editor of
"Brotherman," an anthology of
African-American literature,
stressed the importance of a
strong black community.
Criticizing the standard Amer
ican dream of success, Allen ques
tioned the benefits of affluent
African Americans leaving behind
the inner cities.
"It's a standard goal to 'get
out,' " Allen said. "When I was
young, the family next to me were
regular workers, but across the
street lived a doctor, and down the
block lived a professor. People
growing up today don't see role
models living around them."
Allen opened his speech dis-

cussing the significance of having
a mentor to guide young people
through life.
"Along the way in life," Allen
said, "we hope to find mentors
who will help us along the path.
Mentors play the role that help us
make the important decisions in
our life."
When Allen began attending
Booker T. Washington High
School in Atlanta, Ga,, he said he
often felt lost within the system.
"1 was basically a student who
was at risk of dropping outAllen
said. "I was part of a group who
would be defined today as nerds."
In his math class, Allen met the
teacher who would become his
first mentor. "Mr. Anderson, my
high school math teacher," Allen
said, "pulled the group of us to
gether into, of all things, a chess
club. We learned to play chess,
and 1 loved it
"Mr Anderson conveyed to us
that it was ( )K to be who you are,"
he said. "Later, some of us became
interested in ham radio. Negroes

and ham radio was something
that no one had heard of before."
It was through the assistance
of Anderson that Allen received a
scholarship to attend Morehouse
College as a math and physics
major, where he became involved
in the civil rights movements of
the 19605. Listening to the
speeches of Malcolm X "opened
my eyes to the social problems,"
Allen said. »«•
The assassination of Malcolm
X sent Allen into a long depres
sion, but he soon became involved
with a black newspaper, writing
stories about the burgeoning
black power movement. His inter
est in social sciences eventually
led him to the publication of his
first book, "Black Awakening," in
1969.
"The Port Chicago Mutiny,"
published 20 years later, exposed
a naval work stoppage that oc
curred during World War II after
an explosion at the port killed
more than 300 men. A sponta
neous strike bv underage black la

borers temporarily shut down the
U.S. naval base, located in the Bay
Area. Ultimately, the strike re
sulted in the conviction of 50 la
borers for mutiny.
"There was a great injustice by
the system," Allen said. "The sys
tem regarded them as dispens
able, refusing to even train them
in proper loading. If there was a
disaster and they were lost, so
what?"
