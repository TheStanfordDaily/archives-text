## Upscale grocer takes place of Saks 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
Shoppers who used to pur
chase designer clothes at Saks
Fifth Avenue in the Stanford
Shopping Center will soon find an
abundance of designer foodstuffs
there instead.
Coming this fall to take over
about one-third of the building
vacated by Saks last year is An
dronico's, an upscale food market
well-known to Berkeley resi
dents. The grocery will join al
ready-established food retailers
in the shopping center, including
the Oakville Grocery and the
Monterey Market, a produce spe
cialty store.
Saks left the shopping center
in January 1995. After Androni
co's moves in, the Stanford Man
agement Company will reported
ly still have 40,000 square feet of
space to fill. Additional tenants
should be chosen by the end of
this month, said Julie Pitt, Stan
ford's marketing director.
Bill Andronico, president of
the company, said he will have to
wait to see what is allowable by
the City of Palo Alto before estab
lishing definite hours, but added
that he would like to stay open
until 11 or 12 at night.
Because Andronico's has been
in Berkeley since 1929, when the
family-run business was founded,
Andronico said his stores are ac
customed to having "a lot of
heavy student-based business."
He said the company may look
into more private label items and
smaller sizes to accommodate
student shoppers. The store will
also be looking to expand into
health food and organic lines to
meet current demand.
In addition, "lunchtiine grab
and-go will be big there — no
question about that," Andronico
said.
When Andronico's opens late
next fall, it will make for "even
more of a food environment" at

the shopping center, Pitt said.
She noted that the store will be
able to serve a consumer base in
the Palo Alto area, particularly
among residents of the Sharon
Heights area, Stanford and down
town Palo Alto.
The style of Andronico's also
fits the shopping center's cus
tomer profile, according to Pitt.
Customers tend to be homeown
ers with a higher education and,
in general, have the money and
curiosity to spend on select edi
bles.
Pitt said having a full-scale
grocery store at Stanford should
not be seen as providing competi
tion for the shopping center's
other food stores.
"1 don't feel that that will be a
problem at all," she said, adding
that Andronico's would be more
likely to drain business from Palo
Alto's Whole Foods or Draeger's
in Menlo Park. "It creates new
business; it doesn't take away,"
Pitt said.
Andronico's, which has four
stores in Berkeley, one in San
Francisco, one opening in Los
Altos this month and another set
to open in San Anse'mo in March,
comes to Stanford at a potentially
profitable time. In contrast to the
nationwide trend of sluggish re
tail, the mall's retail sales were up
9 percent this December from last
year at the same time.
Pitt said she expects those in
the Stanford community with
limited resources — namely, stu
dents — will be ablfc to enjoy An
dronico's offerings. "In this day
and age, [all retailers] need to be
competitive," she said.
Graduate student Chad
Ilovey, a resident of Escondido
Village, gave a resounding "nope"
when asked if he would be likely
to shop at Andronico's.
" I don't drive a Mercedes and I
don't have a lot of money. I'm just
a poorgrad student," said Hovey,
who does his food shopping at
Safeway or Costco.
