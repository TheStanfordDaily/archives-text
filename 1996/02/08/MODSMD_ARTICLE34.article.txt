# 'Skyward in Triumph': The return of the Dynamic Dew-o

think the label 'punk rock' is kind ot silly. It
doesn't even apply to Rancid any more."
In April, godhead Silo will release their
new album, whose goofy Arthurian
title, "Skyward in Triumph," Dan can
hardly say without laughing. It's their
most accessible work to date, with rela
tively structured hard rock and, as Dan
points out, lots of songs having to do with
knights and battle. From the 15-minute
"Guardians of the Threshold" to the hi
larious Chili Peppers-ish title track, "Skv
ward" shows the band taking its trade
mark energy in new directions, balancing
its most brutal moments with others that
are almost catchy, even gentle. Here, bet
ter than ever, the group varies its attack
enough to keep its intensity interesting
for the full 36 minutes.
Still, godhead Silo's unique sound was in
full force from the start, to the point that
their 1994 debut full-length, "The Scientif
ic Supercake I..P.," included the scrib
bled message, "VVARNINC i! godheadSi- j
loand Kill Rock Stars are not responsible
for any damages (physical or mechani- j
cal) caused by this recording."
The warning was funny but legiti- I
mate: Aside from the usual worry of •
blown speakers, the group was unsure j
about the possible physical effects of the i
music on listeners. "There's a song on |
our 'Scientific Supercake' record where }
the frequencies are really, really, really i
low," 1 )an says, referring to the last track, |
"Battle of the Planets." "And when we
were mixing that song we all felt very j
nauseous. So that's why we put the I
warning on the record, because if we feel 112
nauseous from this, then someone else l
might get really sick."
Surprisingly, that incident marks the {
only time godhead Silo's noise has been i
troublesome for 1 )an,as his "magic ears" }
somehow "shut themselves off" when }
he plays. After shows, he says his ears !
very rarely start ringing, and he doesn't |
even wear earplugs — though he ac- j
knowledges that that might be the wise j
thing to do.
"I tried it before and could not han
dle it at all," he says. "Kverything sound
ed gross If I can't hear Mike very '
well, I seem to lose a lot of energy for the i
show. Things aren't as fun, and then it
seems like work. I really hate it that way." 1
A godhead Silo tour definitely is a lot ,
of work, though, from the hauling of I
equipment to the nightly outpouring of
sound and energy. Mike and Dan put j
everything they have into every song i
they play, which is why few godhead Silo j
shows last longer than 30 minutes.
"Usually, we put so much effort into i
the show that at about that time, that's j
when we feel like we have to stop, be
cause we're just exhausted," he says. "If i
we were to play longer, like if we were re- .
quired to play an hour-long set, then |
I

we'd just be pacing ourselves, and that
wouldn't be fun."
Another thing that has traditionally
made godhead Silo tours difficult has been
physical illness; Dan seems to get the flu
every time he hits the road, and Mike's luck
has been even worse.
"It used to be that on every tour, Mike
would get like the weird disease type
thing," I )an says. "One tour he got this hor
rible, horrible ear infection. It was really
disgusting. And then the next tour, he had
this horrible eye infection and his eye was
sealed shut. There was another time he had
to wear a brace on his wrist. And he gets
skin rashes too."
F.ven so, Dan assures us, "We put every
thing into it every time, regardless ot our
physical condition."
Perhapsa key to godhead Silo's high-en
ergy performance style — and per
haps also to their persistent and mysterious

sicknesses — is their downright impressive
caffeine intake. I asked Dan about reports
I'd heard that he drinks eight cans of
Mountain Dew a day.
"I kind of cut down on Mountain Dew
a little hit around the house," he answers
proudly. "Just because I've been making so
much coffee. But I'll drink about five cans
of Mountain Dew a day, and then like six
cups of coffee.
"It's a midwest thing," he adds,
thinking back his childhood days in
North Dakota. "People down there real
ly like that Mountain Dew/Mello Yello
taste. When I was a little kid, Mello Yello
was OK because it was on sale all the
time. Like, where a can of Mountain
Dew would be 45 cents, Mello Yello
would be on sale for a quarter. So I'd buy
it, and I loved it.
"But fuck it now," he concludes. "It's too
juicy."

The last time godhead Silo played in San
Francisco, they tore into their set with
all the attitude and aggression that most
modern-day punkers talk about but never
muster, with front man Mike grinding his
knuckles into his bass and drummer Dan
just hitting the crap out of his over-sized
kit. The disorienting rush of sound roared
from the giant amp set-up, filling the Fill
more with a super-bottom heavy punk
racket that left traces of Mike's vocals just
barely detectable beneath the layers of
sheer volume and energy.
If that weren't enough, after the first
song, Mike looked over to the sound guy
disapprovingly and said, "Turn the vocals
way down."
«lA# e hate it when we can hear the
WW vocals," 1 )an says freely. "For me,
1 feel funny, and 1 think Mike is kind ot em
barrassed by it .... We've always liked
them really buried in the mix."
If you look, the vocals are there, but the
godhead Silo approach is purely sonic, and
in that respect they're unbeatable The pair
make more noise and more interesting
noise than would seem possible tor a two
piece, their imposing ruckus all the more
breathtaking with the total absence ot six
string guitar. I he guys in godhead Silo are
frequently asked why they don't have a gui
tar player, but their performances clearly
drive home the point that they really just
don't need one.
"I feel like the only thing that's missing
is guitar solos," I 'an says."And I've never
considered guitar solos to be very impor
tant.
"When we first started the band back in
Fargo, N. 1)., we had a guitar player, and he
kind of quit / got kicked out the night we
had a show," he explains. "Anyway, he had
skipped practice so many times, Mike and
I were kind of used to just playing the songs
by ourselves. So we decided to play the
show without him. From there on, we tried
to get another guitar player, but nothing
worked out. So we kept on practicing and
kept on writing new songs, and after a
while, we just said, 'Fuck it, this is fine.' "
With a wealth of effects boxes and
super-sized speakers, the sound of Mike's
bass is as dynamic as th.it of any guitar,
leading each song with a heavily distorted
rumble, adding an uneasy edge to a musi
cal style that's all too often reduced to a for
mula. F.ven with a history alongside promi
nent punk groups like Unwound and biki
ni Kill on the kill Rock Stars record label,
Dan is reluctant to identify godhead Silo's
music as punk.
"We haven't classified ourselves as a
punk band for a long time," he says."I sup
pose we are, you know, according to the de
finition, but I don't know, it's kind of silly
to me to think that way. We still have like
punk rock ethics and all that, but I just
