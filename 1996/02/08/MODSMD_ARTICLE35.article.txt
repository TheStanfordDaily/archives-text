# James Foley:

Though the weather is mild and sunny
outside, inside San Francisco's Prescott Hotel
lies turmoil and congestion, a gift from L.A.
regretfully accepted by James Foley, the direc
tor of the recently released "Two Bits" and the
critically-acclaimed "Glengarry Glen Ross."
The first thing I notice about Foley is how
he is a conduit tor energy, barely restrained by
normal standards. Though hindered by a
cold, he is by no means down for the count. In
fact, he seems to be catching his second wind,
gaining momentum between sneezing or
blowing his nose. His matter-of fact-manner
is oozes with honesty, passion, a twist of re
flective hindsight and wisdom that suits this
renegade director.
Unbridled by the conventions of the Hol
lywood industry, Foley is on the outskirts of a
subculture obsessed with commercial suc
cess. He will not become another casualty ot
the Hollywood machine that has devoured
lesser talents. In the cannibalistic world that
film inhabits, Foley has not emerged without
scars. More importantly, however, his films
remain intact with integrity and vision.
"1 will not let anybody touch a frame of my
movie," Foley says. Ironically, he hates shoot
ing movies, but knows that it is the only way
to get to the editing, where he creates the final
product.
Thin, bearded, wearing a US(' Film School
sweatshirt and sniffling, Foley definitely
doesn't fit the high flash Hollywood profile.
"It's very stressful, very difficult," he says of
directing. "It's a radical change in lifestyle and
not a normal way to live. How much pleasure
can you get from people staring at you all the
time?" Foley is glad he's not an actor.
Only once has Hollywood touched Foley
— the Madonna flop, "Who's That Girl?".
Foley, fresh out of film school, found it hard
to resist the offer made by a major studio like

Warner Brothers coupled with Madonna's
celebrity.
"Up until six months after Glengarry came
out, I couldn't be asked about it without
pain," he says. Fortunately, bis work has since
escalated in both content and quality.
"Two Bits" and "(Jlcngarry (ilen Ross": Two
sides of the same coin
There are worlds of difference between
"(Uengarry Glen Ross" and "Two Bits" — so
much so that it's hard to believe the same di
rector did both projects. His stamp is there,
however. His world of men is filled with an
emotional honesty that is often lacking in
today's blockbuster male-bonding extrava
ganzas.
"( ilengai rv C ilen Ross" is the faithful adap
tation of the David Mamet play that dives into
the relationship between the men running a
con game scamming poor schmucks yearning
for real estate deals. Fhe gritty and grueling
world of sales and commissions is punctuated
by the father-son nature of Jack Leminon and
Al Pacino's relationship. Pacino comes back
in "Two Bits" as a grandfather who spends the
last day of his life in his favorite chair in the
backyard of his daughter's house, doling out
advice and a shameful secret to his grandson.
Hie film is a romantic excursion into a pe
riod of time marked by hopelessness and in
stability. Foley is able to find the beauty and
stability of family in such a desperate situa
tion. Their self-sufficient world protects Gen
naro, the grandson, from the outside world,
and the day with his grandfather, spent trying
to earn two bits to see the newest cinema in
town, is a day filled with a lifetime's worth of
value.
"From the kid's point of view, the world is
an exciting and beautiful place. The Depres
sion is not muddying up his world. Ife is able
to get past it," Foley says.
The connections between his films, appar
ent to the journalists involved in this inter

view, seems to elude Foley.
"People looking at films are looking at it
from the outside," he says. "There is an as
sumption I know what that is. 1 can't possibly
do that, pull myself back."
He did say that his films are "emotionally
very consistent, with that Madonna mistake
the lone exception.
Striking Back al Hollywood
1 lis wry sense of humor shines when talk
ing about the ebb of his career. "At (Hose
Range and "After Dark, My Sweet" were
given some critical feedback, but nothing else
came his way.
"1 was the great white hope," Foley says.
"When every year [you're used to) going lor
ward, the first time in life that it doesn't go
forward, it goes in reverse, it's very devastat
ing."
Foley continues, "My darkest moment
came when I was offered a mini series," and

with disgust he said,
| "My agent suggested
I do it. I said, 'Fuck
you, that's who you
think I am?' "
At that point his
indomitable drive
kicked in and pulled
him out of a sinking
situation. He is the
type to go down fight
ing rather than let
Hollywood and its
mongrels take him
down the path of
mediocrity.
"It's a contact
sport and you know
[ how to punch when
you have to," Foley
says. He's a man
who's had to trade
blows within the in
dustry and with crit
ics, although not late
ly.
Principled perse
verance is an asset for
i the grueling life of a
k director and Foley is
" no exception. Foley
is adamant in his re
nunciation of the

trappings of commercialism.
"The way I've always worked (means] I've
never made a big success commercially," Foley
says. This doesn't seem to he a problem for
him. both Fenny Marshall and Ron Howard
were considering directing "Two Bits" but he
felt they turned it down because it doesn't
have the potential to be a I lollywood success.
" There's an expectation to maintain suc
cess. Once it enters the decision making
process, it's corrupt, Foley says, "look what
happens when directors make a huge success
creativity takes a dive.
"Spielberg could do anything he wanted
to, and what's he doing?" Foley pauses and al
most spits out, "Jurassic Park 2!"
"Suddenly the clouds moved and the moun
tains were there and I could climb it"
Fndearingly human, honest and forth
right, Foley is a living reminder ol the power
of the individual over the Hollywood film
making formula. He defies the industry's
usual expectations of commercial success. He
doesn't mince words and has no qualms
about telling it like it is. He is a talker, even
when he is sick.
He cannot be called a sellout when he does
the type of films 1 lollywood turns its back on.
That doesn't matter to him. In fact, it seems to
attract projects to him even more. He has the
tenacity of an underdog and assumes a role as
a champion of the independent film maker.
As Foley puts it, his "enthusiasm has risen
in opposite proportion to the glamour of
Hollywood."
He's set to direct "The Chamber," John Gr
isham's latest novel-turned-film. "I'm in a
bizarre situation, directing this against all the
odds of Hollywood stuff." He says that coup
has earned him the respect of the Hollywood
community. He's also working on "Fear",
which is set for an April release.
Foley comes through as a man with a com
mitment to his own personal vision that goes
into every film he directs. There is a spark
within him that seems to defy any natural ail
ments that may be obstacles along the way, like
a flu that may make him look like hell, but to
which he responds to with the blessings of
heaven. He is a man driven with determina
tion and ambition to do films that few others
would do, damn what Hollywood pundits
have to say.
