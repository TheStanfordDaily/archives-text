## A 						web walker's wanderlist 
### Josh Walker 
I do not believe in
the World Wide
Web.
Not that I don't
believe in it — I
have to. From mag
azine cover stories
to URI.s on bill
boards and movie
posters to even my

4,000-year-old great-grandmother making
me explain to her what "that whole thing
with the computers nowadays" is, we're (if
you will — or won't — excuse the pun) all
tangled up in the World Wide Web.
Hut I'm not willing to buy into it all.
There's something too sacred to me about ac
tual, physical things — say people, for exam
ple. Having real larynx-flexing verbal vocal
izations be replaced by hypertext Java jabber
just don't set right. I'm too much ofa skeptic.
And then came yesterday. A pal of mine
asked me to teach him about the Web. What
the heck. So we squatted in front ofa Mac
and became mesmerized by the candy-col
ored, albeit slightly fuzzy, graphic-intensive,
enhanced-for-Netscape images. We laughed,
we cried, blah, blah, blah.. .Then — smack!
— I realized what was happening.
I was a part of it all. I was not just watch
ing the traffic, I was driving in it (I had to get
one reference to the "information superhigh
way" in here). I was becoming one of them.
And now I am struggling with this new
self— Me, Webhead; Me, Netiy.cn; Me, In
fodork-I)ot-Com.
I low did I get this way? What got me here?

These demons are reaJ. And in order to ef
fectively cast them out into the nearest
swineherd/frat party, I wish to present the
bookmarked bandwidths whereat I blissfully
browse, The Web Sites That Made Me Care:
Discovery Channel On-line:
My favorite site of the past few weeks has been
Discovery Channel On-line (http://www.discov
ery.com) — as if I don't get enough of it during
the 800 hours a week I watch it while at home.
This Web site is divided among weekdays, with
each day having a special topic — technology,
history, nature, etc. There arc a couple of differ
ent articles per day, all with photos, film clips,
sounds, related Web site links and references.
Also, all of the past stories are archived and easi
ly accessible. 1 recently read about pirates and
leeches and the circus and zydeco and the AIT
and...
Realist Wonder Society:
The Web is becoming increasingly more
commercial, more slick. Not that it's a bad
thing all the time — believe me, many Web
pages need some help. But the companies
and the advertisements and the gimmicks are
on their way to getting out of hand. That why
1 like the Realist Wonder Society homepage
(http://rrtiet.com/~tuikamura).
A collection of fairy tales and children's
stories, including originals and illustrations,
the Realist Wonder Society is escapist and
therapeutic. Sure, it's a little — er, quite a bit
cheesy, but it's genuine and, dare I say,
cute. There are stories, journal entries, poet
ry, classic fables and warm fiuzzies up the
wazoo. There's even a nifty bit that compares
the real fairy tales to their Disney counter

parts. It's a welcome change.
Emigre Home:
Fonts are cool and Emigre, Inc. is a graphics
company that specializes in fonts. In fact, some
of the hestest fonts are done by Emigre Their
work is on display at places like the SFMOMA
and our very own Green Library as part of the
exhibit on innovative printmaking. Emigre
Home (http://www.value.net/~emigrc) pro
vides an on-line catalog of all their font designs
(full font "families" are available for viewing)
with many in-depth essays by the artists. Emi
gre Magazine information (Emigre's award
winning design publication), Emigre Music
(their record label and multimedia produc
tions) and other goodies are available to look at
and, well, buy.
Center for the Easily Amused:
So much of the Web is made up of sites full
of lists of other people's sites. These links (or
linx or lynx or link/ or whatever else the kids
are calling 'em) can actually be a pain in the
tuchus, especially if traffic is high and things
are slow-going. Perhaps the best collection of
links that I've come across, and one well
worth putting up with, is the Center for the
Easily Amused, or C'E'A (http://www2.is
lundtict.com/~cwulkcr). This site is stuffed
full of wacky links, all categorized ("Sites
That Do Stuff," "Short Attention Span,"
"Random Silliness," etc.) for your pleasure.
From chewing gum collections to feet cams
to sea monkeys, the C'E'A is a place I am
constantly wandering back to. 'Cuz I'm easi
ly amused.
Ronald Reagan Home Page:
No joking — there really is a Ronald Rea

gan Home Page (http://www.erirtet.com/
bkottman/reagan.html). It took me a second
to figure out if they were serious. They are.
At this truly compelling site (in an ethno
graphic kind of way) we can find out all of the
wonderful things "the greatest president of
this century" has done, compare him to other
presidents, read excerpts of his finest speech
es, download photos, learn about his policies
and hear actual sound bites. Yippee! There is
even a gift shop section, and, though it isn't
finished being built, they do have a pretty im
pressive array of bronze and marble Ronald
Reagan busts. I swear to God. Busts. And
starting at only $20!
This month's page sponsor is the
Alzheimer's Association and though
Alzheimer's isn't really funny, this page is.
1 lappy Birthday, Ron.
