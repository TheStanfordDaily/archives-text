# Exposed Film:
## Stanford documentaries at Cinequest 
### Athima Chansanchai 
Something this side of Sundance has hit
San lose, the site of theCinequest Film Festival
which ran from February i-7. The fourth an
nual occasion was marked by 1 lollywood style
hoopla that turned downtown San lose into a
potpourri of film buffs and professionals.
Included in this year's selections were
short films from current and former students
in the Communication Department's Docu
mentary Film & Video Program . Documen
taries have never seemed more fresh, real and
original. In many ways, they are more com
pelling than their fictional counterparts.
Mark Becker, Ftang Inyang and Kim
Roberts are currently in the second year of
their master's program. They submitted their
1995 spring quarter projects to the festival
where their shorts ran as part of the Local
Shorts Series Saturday morning. Pam Wal
ton's "Family Values" screened Sunday morn
ing. She was a former student, now promot
ing this film and giving back to Stanford as a
visiting lecturer in video production.
I see you, do you see me?
Mark Becker's "A Stranger Fixation" cuts
to the heart of documentary filmmaking —
voyeurism and curiosity.
"The strangeness of documentary film
making is interacting with people that you
don't know,"he said. According to Becker,
the genesis of the project was the idea that
"everyday you spend a good amount of time
with people you know nothing about."
Becker, 26, chose San Francisco as his lo
cation because "it's more of an issue in an
urban environment." The scenes, which took
place on trains, in a diner, at a photo shop
and in a Laundromat, were all specifically
chosen as emblematic of public space.
Each scene is marked by the intrusion of
mechanical coldness that accompanies the
indifference of the people in these spaces.
Becker said he didn't notice until later that
"all the sequences had machine things going
on."
"The woman in the Laundromat was able
to articulate something I couldn't as a narra
tor," Becker said, which is that "people need a
certain amount of public life, the need to be
amidst people."
An added bonus for Becker is that his film
has already been shown at the Boston Film
Festival in September, which gave his parents
a taste of what their son does best.
This is about ineesl. Did you hear me?
Ftang Inyang's "Sister Inside" is a story of
incest, done in such a way so it doesn't assault
the viewer. Rather, it makes us feel the effect
of such an assault through original poetry.
"Sexual violence and African-American
women have been silenced," Inyang said. This
film gives them a voice.
Replete with images of girls holding hands
and playing in a field, interviews with other

survivors and broken glass ("fragmented
pieces of myself I'm running around trying
to put into place," Inyang said), it is a power
fill piece that speaks ol healing and the
process of dealing with betrayal from a trust
ed source.
"It wasn't just my story," Inyang, 24, said.
"It includes the words of the other three
women, friends of a woman I did a film on in
the fall quarter. I felt very honored to be wel
come among them.''
The "little girls with no language of their

own" are a haunting legacy of the loss of in
nocence. They emerge as survivors who
struggle to reclaim what's been taken away.
Inyang cared most about the reactions
from the survivors. One of the women in the
film, the old poetess Akiba, told her she
thought the film was a healing process. In
yang seemed relieved.
"It was the feedback I needed," she said. "I
didn't feel confident until I got that feedback.
"It was a very cathartic experience, hard
to let go. It was one of the hardest things I had
to do."
Class is ou( in Palo Alio
Kim Roberts strikes close to home with
"Class Struggles in Palo Alto," a booster in
jection of politics and savvy observations.

Focusing solely upon Palo Alto is a more re
vealing and difficult piece than doing the ob
vious disparity between Palo Alto and Fast
Palo Alto.
Roberts takes an insider's perspective, be
ginning first with a tongue-in-cheek pan of
the Mediterranean villa atmosphere of Stan
ford. I lei soundman was able to capture the
words of tour guides as they showed off the
virtues of our university. Roberts proceeds to
take us on a tour of Palo Alto, going down

less men.
Roberts, 25, remembers looking for signs
of protest at Stanford. One day she thought
she found it when she encountered people
camping out in the cold. "It turned out to be
people getting tickets for the Viennese Ball,"
she recalls with amusement.
The details Roberts picks up are choice
bits of polished California political correct
ness, eating habits and elderly radical pro
testers. What was that last one? Yes, you may
have seen them before, the men and women
who protest every Tuesday on the corner of El
Camino Real and Embarcadero Road. They
have been doing this for 20 years and, judging
from their spirit and intellectual integrity,
they may continue to do so for 20 more.
For Roberts, documentary film "allows

you to delve into things that interest you in a
more eclectic sort of way. Vou release yourself
to try to understand it," Roberts said.
In a final moment of reflection she said,
"It's a celebration of what it means to be
human."
H's a Family Affair
Pam Walton, 51, made a life change ten
years ago, leaving her 20-year teaching career
to make documentaries. Her third film,
"family Values," is a painful look at the most
intimate strangers in lite: family. Incensed by
the Republican campaign in 1992 that pro
moted family values, Walton presented her
other family, her lesbian community, along
side an expose on her father, a prominent
right-wing leader. It became a three-year
project exploring the 15-year estrangement
between father and daughter.
The hardest part for her, she said, was
"learning to be a character in the film," a
process that took her deep within herself.
The lines between life and art became blurred
she saiil, making "everything an event to
film. It was hard to know when to end it."
Walton talked about being in this busi
ness. "What it comes down to is you and your
commitment to the work. No one's ever said
being an artist is easy. It takes a certain per
sonality to survive. You have to be willing to
take risks," Walton said to sum up the life of a
filmmaker.
"It really helps at my end to be committed
to a cause or idea," she added.
Walton, who was in the Documentary
Film & Video Program from 1985-1988, is
not without her practical side, however. She's
aware of the differences between her and the
other documentary film students.
"I have an impatient nature. I'm learning
patience but I'm ready," she said, smiling.
"Ready for some money!"
Walton hopes to get her film on national
television by this summer, just in time for the
election frenzy that will inevitably bash alter
native lifestyles in place of the illusion of all-
American fa mi I y va I ues.
Recognition
The taste of recognition was at hand and the
audience gave them the thumbs up. These stu
dents' documentaries stood out among the
other shorts screened to a packed house at
(Camera Three Theaters in downtown San lose.
Filmmaking is a strange business. It gets
even stranger when you do documentaries.
You get into people's lives, or deeper into
your own, and you stick a camera into it and
then show it to other people. It is journalism
with a sight all its own, a vision crafted and
carried out by the filmmaker.
The breadth of talent in the Documentary
Film & Video Program has already been
amply shown at the fall quarter's screening of
last year's diploma projects. This year's class
looks to set their own pace and style, but they
continue the legacy of quality filmmaking
their predecessors have set.
