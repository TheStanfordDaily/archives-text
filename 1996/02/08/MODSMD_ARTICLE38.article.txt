Ram's Head Original Winter One Aits
presents three plays, "Badenheim," "Only
Connect..." and "Kggs (or overeasy)" this
year, running at the Nitery until Sunday.
They are roughly hour-long plays written,
directed and acted by Stanford students.
Ram's Head, a student drama group, pro
duces the event, which opened Wednesday
night. "Badenheim", directed by Benjy la
cobson, features a German village in 1939.
"Only Connect...," directed by liana Werner,
tells the story of Sebastian's bouts with love,
cinema and reality. The last and longest play,
"Kggs," directed by Alison (iordon, stars Julie
Arnall as Rachel, a protes
sional who

must decide if she wants to have a child by a
boyfriend she doesn't love.
World War II
Jordan Cielber is Jewish. He adapted
"Badenheim" from a story by a Jewish author,
Aharon Applefeld. Benjy Jacobson, also Jew
ish, directs the play.
The story: Sanitation 1 )epartment officials
in 1939 cordon off the Jewish villagers in
Badenheim. The Jews fool themselves into
thinking that their separation is an honor
rather than a death knell. Here is where the
drama becomes complicated:
"I didn't ever play this as a Jewish play," Ja
cobson said. "I think it's very universal."
The writer Cielber, who appears in "Kggs,"
also spoke of universality: "1 kind of wish I
didn't make the people Jewish because people
might say, 'oh great, another holocaust play.
Both the director and writer insisted that
anybody can relate to the themes "Baden
heim" raises. Cielber mentioned student
complacency and the breakdown of former
Yugoslavia as examples. (During a run
through at the Nitery I couldn't help but
think that the Sanitation Department is a
loose metaphor for "ethnic cleansing. )
Jacobson made the parallel between suc
cessful, assimilated Jews in pre-war Germany
and successful, assimilated Jews in modern
day America. In either case the play has little
Yiddish, the term "Jew" is used as an empty
category rather than an ethnic identity and
the (ierman officials are never called Nazis.
"I did it to make people aware of what's
going on around them. To be conscious. To
not be afraid to act," Gelber said.
This is the most elaborate of the three

one-acts. I'here are two main
characters and nine
other villagers
and offi-

cials. There is a platform on the set, three dis
crete areas of set design: a pharmacy, bedroom
and cafe, and bursts of classical music.
As the lights begin to glow on stage you
can hear the crackle of an old record over the
Nitery sound-system. Two villagers, a lady
and her friend, stroll onto the set with ciga
rettes, wine and playful an
ticipation. They are eager

to discuss
Bad en he i m' s
approach ing
cultural festi
val. Slowly, as
the plavcontin
ues, the festival
falls apart.
Trudy, one of
the two main
characters, be
comes insane as
the Sanitation
Depart m en t
grows ever
more efficient.
I'he set de
sign is excellent.
Merging pools
of light high
light different
areas of the vil
lage. The old
world music, all
waltzes, is also
excellent. Jacob
son has done a
fine job with an
almost over
whelming chal
lenge: to bring his
play together, to
start the Winter
One Acts with a
roar and to acti
vate ,
rather than
d e press,
the audi
ence.

One actor, playing Dr. Schultz,
had to suddenly drop out because of illness.
Dan I'intauro, who recently acted in "La
Bete," has taken up the mantle. He's
only been with the play for a week.
Even though he yelled "line" to Jacob
son a few times during a Niterv tech
run-through, he acted well and blend
ed in with the cast.
Jacobson is confident that his play,
(complex as it is, will come together.
The different pieces of the one act —
cafe scenes, street conversations, a
screaming mad woman — seemed to
coalesce as the story progressed.
As soon as the production is over,
(ielber said he will be eager for feedback so he
can turn the one act into a full-length play.
The junior actor and writer is thinking of
producing it during his last year at Stanford.
The Disco Generation
Samuel Park, a sophomore, wrote "Only
Connect..." a week before the Ram's Head

submission deadline, but he said it has
emerged from an evolution of comedic
sketches. Director liana Wiener described the
play best: "It's a 70's love thing," she said,
loosely borrowing from Janet Jackson.
"Connect" is divided into seven scenes
and moves through them with the smooth

pace of a movie. In one scene,
two pools of light divide the stage with actors
in either space, like a French New Wave film.
There is a disco soundtrack, a little dancing
and excellent fantasy sequences that dissolve
in and out of reality. This is all to say that the
play is cinematic, which is appropriate be
cause the silver screen is central to "Only
Connect." (Even the title is informed by film,
it's from a line in "Howard's End.")
The comedy focuses on Sebastian, who
fantasizes about life as if it were a movie. He
dreams of love, kisses on rainy afternoons,
grand entrances and desperate romance. Irv
ing is much more simple: he wants sex. One
evening he picks up the starry-eyed Sebast
ian. From there on, the lead is star-struck and
Irving is prowling for more lovers.
When I talked to Weiner, she was con
cerned about Irving, played by freshman
Jared Kopf, who has never acted before. "I'm
worried, but if I work hard enough on it, I
think he can get it," she said.

The lead,
Geo r g e
Mitchell ("like
the Senator,"
she joked), is
more experi
enced. "He's a

strong actor," she said.
From what I saw at a run-through in the
dark lounge at Toyon Hall, she shouldn't
waste her time worrying about Irving. Kopfis
cute, masculine and seductive. He slips into
the role of Irving likea man dressing in some
one else's clothing: they may not be his, but
the look is convincing. Kopf acts like he en

joys
pick
ing up girls or boys with cheesy, effective
lines; like he has a complicated past of disap
pointments that drives him to stalk new
lovers. Out of the three characters — Sebast
ian, his friend Anna (played by the stunning
I lolly Crafts) and Irving — the latter has the
most depth and range.
Mitchell's acting was narrower but en
dearing. "Sebastian is romantic to a fault, but
you still love him. I le's your sappv friend that
you want to give a hug," Weiner said of the
lead role.
Anna summed it up when she said to her
best friend Sebastian: "You're pathetic. Cute,
but pathetic."
Crafts, as Anna, turned up the volume
half-way through the forty minute play with
exaggerated poses and fast dialogue. Unfor
tunately, the script didn't always keep up.
Some lines did more telling than showing. At
one point Anna said, "everybody has fears of

not having a relationship," instead of acting
out those insecurities.
Park was concerned that the actors
didn't get all of the jokes in the beginning.
Weiner wanted to be sure that Kopf figures
out Irving's relationship with Sebastian.
Understanding seemed to be the central
production theme of this comedy.
Park said emphatically of Weiner, "She
understood the whole concept ot the
story," emphasizing the word "concept"
like it was some elusive jewel he needed to
grasp with volume.
"Jared is very intellectual. I think he can
get itWeiner pronounced, allaying her
fears that the freshman won't be able to

pull through. Ultimately, this
is a light, fast-paced play
that is accessible to
everyone, even ho

mophobes.
On the produc
tion side, Weiner was
striving to perfect the
mechanics that go
into a play with
seven scene changes,
15 different songs
and 42 light cues.
With tech week half
way through, time
seemed to accelerate

— hut I didn't believe
her when she said she
was worried.
"It's a fun play," Weiner
added, waving her hands
dramatically in the air, "the
characters don't take themselv
too seriously." Nor should she.

Last Call-Fertile in 1996
Rachel is frustrated. Yes,
.she has a wonderful, humorous best

friend named Leo, the second ga
man of the night. Yes, her boyfriend Je
remy is romantic (he gives her roses)
She even has a continuous fantasy se
quence with her future child, affection

ately dubbed "Egg," after the one ovum left
in her ovaries. This is the problem: Rachel,
played skillfully by Julie Arnall, must decide
whether or not to have a child because of a
meltdown in her reproductive system. For
the duration of "Eggs," directed by Alison
Gordon, the 31-year-old New Yorker at
Goldman & Sachs is forced to make choices
under the gun of time.
The difficulties of Rachel's post-feminist
success strikes close to the hearts of upwardly
mobile elites, namely, students at Stanford
University. Rachel has to decide in two weeks
what most women have a good thirty years to
mull over: whether or not to have children
and whether or not this will ruin her career.
But don't be fooled into remorse. This is
play is pure comedy, deftly written by
Michael Green, a fifth-year Human Biology
and Religious Studies double major. He is a
Jewish New Yorker and so is his humor: I
laughed at the same jokes throughout the
four different rehearsals I attended. I admit
loudly that I am also a Jew from New York ex
traction, but the jokes are universal and the
Yiddish is sparse.
1 met Michael in a worn-out room in the
drama department after a Sunday afternoon
rehearsal. He seemed pleased with the play
and his relationship with the director:
"Ali is excellent. We have a good rapport

going." Alter an infinitesimal amount ot
prodding he quickly said about the role of the
writer: "It's excruciating. It's terrible." Ol all
the writers 1 talked to none were as wedded to
their piece as (ireen was to "Eggs."
"You're attached to something. You hand
it over to someone else and you hope it goes
well." 1 le is confident of Gordon but wary of
changes to his play, which is successful but
runs long. It clocked in at an hour and eigh
teen minutes in an early run-through.
"Badenheim" and "Only Connect" are both
roughly forty minutes, juist enough time to
hold the audiences' attention and create dra
matic movement.
"It's really hard for the writer to distance
himself and let the director interpret the play
their way," Alison Gordon said in a separate
interview, but, she continued, "I think the
overall relationship is good."
"I haven't allowed him to come to re
hearsals until we were well on track," she
added. She needed to arrive at her own inter
pretation of the text just as Benjy Jacobson
and liana Weiner had to for their one acts.
Finding a balance between what a writer cre
ated and a director interpreted hasn't been an
easy process for Green and Gordon, but this
isn't what the audience is going to see.
Julie Arnall (the lead) and Victor Wishna
(a supporting actor) stood in a drama de
partment room on a carpet that was clearly a
left-over from the early '70s, when taupe and
pea green were "in" colors. They spoke as if I
wasn't there. As they entranced each other
the young woman at Stanford became a dis
traught New Yorker, and the straight under
grad turned into a gay father of two.
"One day, I want to have kids!" Rachel an
nounced to Leo.
"So?"
"Not today!"
There's a humor to her misery that made me

sympathize with her
character. Later, she
seduces I x*o, a kosher,
gay lew who has
given up on religion
(life is mysterious),
into dreaming about
pepperoni pizza and
other delicacies.
"Bacon isn't just a
food," she said to
him, dwelling on
each word like a I -
900-HOT-SEX op
erator, "it's an expe
rience." Leo sighed
in pleasure, never
having tasted pork.
Leo, who might eye
a cantor but never a
Rabbi, is played bril
liantly by Wishna.
The entire cast of five
is strong and confi
dent: no one actor
overshadows the
other, although Ar
nall clearly has the
dominant role. She
plays it convincingly.
The direction is
tight, well focused
and full of move
ment in an otherwise
static set. The jokes
are constant, hysteri
cally funny and ac

cented by directorial
touches that blossom from the script (follow
the M&M's, toy animals and cuddly baguette).
If the world is a stage,
are doctors the tech crew?
Fvery director I talked to sounded confi
dent about their production. The writers
have long given up their scripts to the inter
pretation of the directors. Now the directors
must work like crazy before the actors take
over. Technical polish remains the last chal
lenge for lacobson, Weiner and Gordon. All
three plays have music, dramatic lighting
sometimes with gels, set props and heavy
sofas, desks and beds.
After each play there is a ten-minute inter
mission for the "runners," stage hands, to dis -
mantle and construct each set. Some pieces of
furniture and some lights will remain the
same, but each play is very different in tone
and location. There is a chronological order
to the night: the thirties give way to the sev
enties and then to the nineties.
For all this there are scores of people who
are rarely known to the audience: the entire
technical crew and the producer, Carrie Cas
selman. But they are all too familiar with the
three directors whose roles end as the house
lights fade.

Rachels jaw falls open. I ler physi
cian stands over her, front loading
M&M's into his mouth. She begins
to laugh but he hasn't made any jokes. The
young New Yorker can t believe that the doc

ovaries, and two weeks to fertilize it.
Sebastian is younger, desperate, queer and
angelic. I lis fairy godmother, a sexy woman
with a crewot pretty hoys, presents each mate
to Sebastian. The first has brick-like biceps,
the others are either sensitive poets, fans of
"The Sound of Musk or butch sadists. I his

illusion of a lover.
Trudy is suk like Germany, like the lews,
like the long horror show of World War 11.

Ram's Head Original Winter One Aits
presents three plays, "Badenheim," "Only
Connect..." and "Kggs (or overeasy)" this
year, running at the Nitery until Sunday.
They are roughly hour-long plays written,
directed and acted by Stanford students.
Ram's Head, a student drama group, pro
duces the event, which opened Wednesday
night. "Badenheim", directed by Benjy la
cobson, features a German village in 1939.
"Only Connect...," directed by liana Werner,
tells the story of Sebastian's bouts with love,
cinema and reality. The last and longest play,
"Kggs," directed by Alison (iordon, stars Julie
Arnall as Rachel, a protes
sional who

must decide if she wants to have a child by a
boyfriend she doesn't love.
World War II
Jordan Cielber is Jewish. He adapted
"Badenheim" from a story by a Jewish author,
Aharon Applefeld. Benjy Jacobson, also Jew
ish, directs the play.
The story: Sanitation 1 )epartment officials
in 1939 cordon off the Jewish villagers in
Badenheim. The Jews fool themselves into
thinking that their separation is an honor
rather than a death knell. Here is where the
drama becomes complicated:
"I didn't ever play this as a Jewish play," Ja
cobson said. "I think it's very universal."
The writer Cielber, who appears in "Kggs,"
also spoke of universality: "1 kind of wish I
didn't make the people Jewish because people
might say, 'oh great, another holocaust play.
Both the director and writer insisted that
anybody can relate to the themes "Baden
heim" raises. Cielber mentioned student
complacency and the breakdown of former
Yugoslavia as examples. (During a run
through at the Nitery I couldn't help but
think that the Sanitation Department is a
loose metaphor for "ethnic cleansing. )
Jacobson made the parallel between suc
cessful, assimilated Jews in pre-war Germany
and successful, assimilated Jews in modern
day America. In either case the play has little
Yiddish, the term "Jew" is used as an empty
category rather than an ethnic identity and
the (ierman officials are never called Nazis.
"I did it to make people aware of what's
going on around them. To be conscious. To
not be afraid to act," Gelber said.
This is the most elaborate of the three

one-acts. I'here are two main
characters and nine
other villagers
and offi-

cials. There is a platform on the set, three dis
crete areas of set design: a pharmacy, bedroom
and cafe, and bursts of classical music.
As the lights begin to glow on stage you
can hear the crackle of an old record over the
Nitery sound-system. Two villagers, a lady
and her friend, stroll onto the set with ciga
rettes, wine and playful an
ticipation. They are eager

to discuss
Bad en he i m' s
approach ing
cultural festi
val. Slowly, as
the plavcontin
ues, the festival
falls apart.
Trudy, one of
the two main
characters, be
comes insane as
the Sanitation
Depart m en t
grows ever
more efficient.
I'he set de
sign is excellent.
Merging pools
of light high
light different
areas of the vil
lage. The old
world music, all
waltzes, is also
excellent. Jacob
son has done a
fine job with an
almost over
whelming chal
lenge: to bring his
play together, to
start the Winter
One Acts with a
roar and to acti
vate ,
rather than
d e press,
the audi
ence.

One actor, playing Dr. Schultz,
had to suddenly drop out because of illness.
Dan I'intauro, who recently acted in "La
Bete," has taken up the mantle. He's
only been with the play for a week.
Even though he yelled "line" to Jacob
son a few times during a Niterv tech
run-through, he acted well and blend
ed in with the cast.
Jacobson is confident that his play,
(complex as it is, will come together.
The different pieces of the one act —
cafe scenes, street conversations, a
screaming mad woman — seemed to
coalesce as the story progressed.
As soon as the production is over,
(ielber said he will be eager for feedback so he
can turn the one act into a full-length play.
The junior actor and writer is thinking of
producing it during his last year at Stanford.
The Disco Generation
Samuel Park, a sophomore, wrote "Only
Connect..." a week before the Ram's Head

submission deadline, but he said it has
emerged from an evolution of comedic
sketches. Director liana Wiener described the
play best: "It's a 70's love thing," she said,
loosely borrowing from Janet Jackson.
"Connect" is divided into seven scenes
and moves through them with the smooth

pace of a movie. In one scene,
two pools of light divide the stage with actors
in either space, like a French New Wave film.
There is a disco soundtrack, a little dancing
and excellent fantasy sequences that dissolve
in and out of reality. This is all to say that the
play is cinematic, which is appropriate be
cause the silver screen is central to "Only
Connect." (Even the title is informed by film,
it's from a line in "Howard's End.")
The comedy focuses on Sebastian, who
fantasizes about life as if it were a movie. He
dreams of love, kisses on rainy afternoons,
grand entrances and desperate romance. Irv
ing is much more simple: he wants sex. One
evening he picks up the starry-eyed Sebast
ian. From there on, the lead is star-struck and
Irving is prowling for more lovers.
When I talked to Weiner, she was con
cerned about Irving, played by freshman
Jared Kopf, who has never acted before. "I'm
worried, but if I work hard enough on it, I
think he can get it," she said.

The lead,
Geo r g e
Mitchell ("like
the Senator,"
she joked), is
more experi
enced. "He's a

strong actor," she said.
From what I saw at a run-through in the
dark lounge at Toyon Hall, she shouldn't
waste her time worrying about Irving. Kopfis
cute, masculine and seductive. He slips into
the role of Irving likea man dressing in some
one else's clothing: they may not be his, but
the look is convincing. Kopf acts like he en

joys
pick
ing up girls or boys with cheesy, effective
lines; like he has a complicated past of disap
pointments that drives him to stalk new
lovers. Out of the three characters — Sebast
ian, his friend Anna (played by the stunning
I lolly Crafts) and Irving — the latter has the
most depth and range.
Mitchell's acting was narrower but en
dearing. "Sebastian is romantic to a fault, but
you still love him. I le's your sappv friend that
you want to give a hug," Weiner said of the
lead role.
Anna summed it up when she said to her
best friend Sebastian: "You're pathetic. Cute,
but pathetic."
Crafts, as Anna, turned up the volume
half-way through the forty minute play with
exaggerated poses and fast dialogue. Unfor
tunately, the script didn't always keep up.
Some lines did more telling than showing. At
one point Anna said, "everybody has fears of

not having a relationship," instead of acting
out those insecurities.
Park was concerned that the actors
didn't get all of the jokes in the beginning.
Weiner wanted to be sure that Kopf figures
out Irving's relationship with Sebastian.
Understanding seemed to be the central
production theme of this comedy.
Park said emphatically of Weiner, "She
understood the whole concept ot the
story," emphasizing the word "concept"
like it was some elusive jewel he needed to
grasp with volume.
"Jared is very intellectual. I think he can
get itWeiner pronounced, allaying her
fears that the freshman won't be able to

pull through. Ultimately, this
is a light, fast-paced play
that is accessible to
everyone, even ho

mophobes.
On the produc
tion side, Weiner was
striving to perfect the
mechanics that go
into a play with
seven scene changes,
15 different songs
and 42 light cues.
With tech week half
way through, time
seemed to accelerate

— hut I didn't believe
her when she said she
was worried.
"It's a fun play," Weiner
added, waving her hands
dramatically in the air, "the
characters don't take themselv
too seriously." Nor should she.

Last Call-Fertile in 1996
Rachel is frustrated. Yes,
.she has a wonderful, humorous best

friend named Leo, the second ga
man of the night. Yes, her boyfriend Je
remy is romantic (he gives her roses)
She even has a continuous fantasy se
quence with her future child, affection

ately dubbed "Egg," after the one ovum left
in her ovaries. This is the problem: Rachel,
played skillfully by Julie Arnall, must decide
whether or not to have a child because of a
meltdown in her reproductive system. For
the duration of "Eggs," directed by Alison
Gordon, the 31-year-old New Yorker at
Goldman & Sachs is forced to make choices
under the gun of time.
The difficulties of Rachel's post-feminist
success strikes close to the hearts of upwardly
mobile elites, namely, students at Stanford
University. Rachel has to decide in two weeks
what most women have a good thirty years to
mull over: whether or not to have children
and whether or not this will ruin her career.
But don't be fooled into remorse. This is
play is pure comedy, deftly written by
Michael Green, a fifth-year Human Biology
and Religious Studies double major. He is a
Jewish New Yorker and so is his humor: I
laughed at the same jokes throughout the
four different rehearsals I attended. I admit
loudly that I am also a Jew from New York ex
traction, but the jokes are universal and the
Yiddish is sparse.
1 met Michael in a worn-out room in the
drama department after a Sunday afternoon
rehearsal. He seemed pleased with the play
and his relationship with the director:
"Ali is excellent. We have a good rapport

going." Alter an infinitesimal amount ot
prodding he quickly said about the role of the
writer: "It's excruciating. It's terrible." Ol all
the writers 1 talked to none were as wedded to
their piece as (ireen was to "Eggs."
"You're attached to something. You hand
it over to someone else and you hope it goes
well." 1 le is confident of Gordon but wary of
changes to his play, which is successful but
runs long. It clocked in at an hour and eigh
teen minutes in an early run-through.
"Badenheim" and "Only Connect" are both
roughly forty minutes, juist enough time to
hold the audiences' attention and create dra
matic movement.
"It's really hard for the writer to distance
himself and let the director interpret the play
their way," Alison Gordon said in a separate
interview, but, she continued, "I think the
overall relationship is good."
"I haven't allowed him to come to re
hearsals until we were well on track," she
added. She needed to arrive at her own inter
pretation of the text just as Benjy Jacobson
and liana Weiner had to for their one acts.
Finding a balance between what a writer cre
ated and a director interpreted hasn't been an
easy process for Green and Gordon, but this
isn't what the audience is going to see.
Julie Arnall (the lead) and Victor Wishna
(a supporting actor) stood in a drama de
partment room on a carpet that was clearly a
left-over from the early '70s, when taupe and
pea green were "in" colors. They spoke as if I
wasn't there. As they entranced each other
the young woman at Stanford became a dis
traught New Yorker, and the straight under
grad turned into a gay father of two.
"One day, I want to have kids!" Rachel an
nounced to Leo.
"So?"
"Not today!"
There's a humor to her misery that made me

sympathize with her
character. Later, she
seduces I x*o, a kosher,
gay lew who has
given up on religion
(life is mysterious),
into dreaming about
pepperoni pizza and
other delicacies.
"Bacon isn't just a
food," she said to
him, dwelling on
each word like a I -
900-HOT-SEX op
erator, "it's an expe
rience." Leo sighed
in pleasure, never
having tasted pork.
Leo, who might eye
a cantor but never a
Rabbi, is played bril
liantly by Wishna.
The entire cast of five
is strong and confi
dent: no one actor
overshadows the
other, although Ar
nall clearly has the
dominant role. She
plays it convincingly.
The direction is
tight, well focused
and full of move
ment in an otherwise
static set. The jokes
are constant, hysteri
cally funny and ac

cented by directorial
touches that blossom from the script (follow
the M&M's, toy animals and cuddly baguette).
If the world is a stage,
are doctors the tech crew?
Fvery director I talked to sounded confi
dent about their production. The writers
have long given up their scripts to the inter
pretation of the directors. Now the directors
must work like crazy before the actors take
over. Technical polish remains the last chal
lenge for lacobson, Weiner and Gordon. All
three plays have music, dramatic lighting
sometimes with gels, set props and heavy
sofas, desks and beds.
After each play there is a ten-minute inter
mission for the "runners," stage hands, to dis -
mantle and construct each set. Some pieces of
furniture and some lights will remain the
same, but each play is very different in tone
and location. There is a chronological order
to the night: the thirties give way to the sev
enties and then to the nineties.
For all this there are scores of people who
are rarely known to the audience: the entire
technical crew and the producer, Carrie Cas
selman. But they are all too familiar with the
three directors whose roles end as the house
lights fade.

Ram's Head Original Winter One Aits
presents three plays, "Badenheim," "Only
Connect..." and "Kggs (or overeasy)" this
year, running at the Nitery until Sunday.
They are roughly hour-long plays written,
directed and acted by Stanford students.
Ram's Head, a student drama group, pro
duces the event, which opened Wednesday
night. "Badenheim", directed by Benjy la
cobson, features a German village in 1939.
"Only Connect...," directed by liana Werner,
tells the story of Sebastian's bouts with love,
cinema and reality. The last and longest play,
"Kggs," directed by Alison (iordon, stars Julie
Arnall as Rachel, a protes
sional who

must decide if she wants to have a child by a
boyfriend she doesn't love.
World War II
Jordan Cielber is Jewish. He adapted
"Badenheim" from a story by a Jewish author,
Aharon Applefeld. Benjy Jacobson, also Jew
ish, directs the play.
The story: Sanitation 1 )epartment officials
in 1939 cordon off the Jewish villagers in
Badenheim. The Jews fool themselves into
thinking that their separation is an honor
rather than a death knell. Here is where the
drama becomes complicated:
"I didn't ever play this as a Jewish play," Ja
cobson said. "I think it's very universal."
The writer Cielber, who appears in "Kggs,"
also spoke of universality: "1 kind of wish I
didn't make the people Jewish because people
might say, 'oh great, another holocaust play.
Both the director and writer insisted that
anybody can relate to the themes "Baden
heim" raises. Cielber mentioned student
complacency and the breakdown of former
Yugoslavia as examples. (During a run
through at the Nitery I couldn't help but
think that the Sanitation Department is a
loose metaphor for "ethnic cleansing. )
Jacobson made the parallel between suc
cessful, assimilated Jews in pre-war Germany
and successful, assimilated Jews in modern
day America. In either case the play has little
Yiddish, the term "Jew" is used as an empty
category rather than an ethnic identity and
the (ierman officials are never called Nazis.
"I did it to make people aware of what's
going on around them. To be conscious. To
not be afraid to act," Gelber said.
This is the most elaborate of the three

one-acts. I'here are two main
characters and nine
other villagers
and offi-

cials. There is a platform on the set, three dis
crete areas of set design: a pharmacy, bedroom
and cafe, and bursts of classical music.
As the lights begin to glow on stage you
can hear the crackle of an old record over the
Nitery sound-system. Two villagers, a lady
and her friend, stroll onto the set with ciga
rettes, wine and playful an
ticipation. They are eager

to discuss
Bad en he i m' s
approach ing
cultural festi
val. Slowly, as
the plavcontin
ues, the festival
falls apart.
Trudy, one of
the two main
characters, be
comes insane as
the Sanitation
Depart m en t
grows ever
more efficient.
I'he set de
sign is excellent.
Merging pools
of light high
light different
areas of the vil
lage. The old
world music, all
waltzes, is also
excellent. Jacob
son has done a
fine job with an
almost over
whelming chal
lenge: to bring his
play together, to
start the Winter
One Acts with a
roar and to acti
vate ,
rather than
d e press,
the audi
ence.

One actor, playing Dr. Schultz,
had to suddenly drop out because of illness.
Dan I'intauro, who recently acted in "La
Bete," has taken up the mantle. He's
only been with the play for a week.
Even though he yelled "line" to Jacob
son a few times during a Niterv tech
run-through, he acted well and blend
ed in with the cast.
Jacobson is confident that his play,
(complex as it is, will come together.
The different pieces of the one act —
cafe scenes, street conversations, a
screaming mad woman — seemed to
coalesce as the story progressed.
As soon as the production is over,
(ielber said he will be eager for feedback so he
can turn the one act into a full-length play.
The junior actor and writer is thinking of
producing it during his last year at Stanford.
The Disco Generation
Samuel Park, a sophomore, wrote "Only
Connect..." a week before the Ram's Head

submission deadline, but he said it has
emerged from an evolution of comedic
sketches. Director liana Wiener described the
play best: "It's a 70's love thing," she said,
loosely borrowing from Janet Jackson.
"Connect" is divided into seven scenes
and moves through them with the smooth

pace of a movie. In one scene,
two pools of light divide the stage with actors
in either space, like a French New Wave film.
There is a disco soundtrack, a little dancing
and excellent fantasy sequences that dissolve
in and out of reality. This is all to say that the
play is cinematic, which is appropriate be
cause the silver screen is central to "Only
Connect." (Even the title is informed by film,
it's from a line in "Howard's End.")
The comedy focuses on Sebastian, who
fantasizes about life as if it were a movie. He
dreams of love, kisses on rainy afternoons,
grand entrances and desperate romance. Irv
ing is much more simple: he wants sex. One
evening he picks up the starry-eyed Sebast
ian. From there on, the lead is star-struck and
Irving is prowling for more lovers.
When I talked to Weiner, she was con
cerned about Irving, played by freshman
Jared Kopf, who has never acted before. "I'm
worried, but if I work hard enough on it, I
think he can get it," she said.

The lead,
Geo r g e
Mitchell ("like
the Senator,"
she joked), is
more experi
enced. "He's a

strong actor," she said.
From what I saw at a run-through in the
dark lounge at Toyon Hall, she shouldn't
waste her time worrying about Irving. Kopfis
cute, masculine and seductive. He slips into
the role of Irving likea man dressing in some
one else's clothing: they may not be his, but
the look is convincing. Kopf acts like he en

joys
pick
ing up girls or boys with cheesy, effective
lines; like he has a complicated past of disap
pointments that drives him to stalk new
lovers. Out of the three characters — Sebast
ian, his friend Anna (played by the stunning
I lolly Crafts) and Irving — the latter has the
most depth and range.
Mitchell's acting was narrower but en
dearing. "Sebastian is romantic to a fault, but
you still love him. I le's your sappv friend that
you want to give a hug," Weiner said of the
lead role.
Anna summed it up when she said to her
best friend Sebastian: "You're pathetic. Cute,
but pathetic."
Crafts, as Anna, turned up the volume
half-way through the forty minute play with
exaggerated poses and fast dialogue. Unfor
tunately, the script didn't always keep up.
Some lines did more telling than showing. At
one point Anna said, "everybody has fears of

not having a relationship," instead of acting
out those insecurities.
Park was concerned that the actors
didn't get all of the jokes in the beginning.
Weiner wanted to be sure that Kopf figures
out Irving's relationship with Sebastian.
Understanding seemed to be the central
production theme of this comedy.
Park said emphatically of Weiner, "She
understood the whole concept ot the
story," emphasizing the word "concept"
like it was some elusive jewel he needed to
grasp with volume.
"Jared is very intellectual. I think he can
get itWeiner pronounced, allaying her
fears that the freshman won't be able to

pull through. Ultimately, this
is a light, fast-paced play
that is accessible to
everyone, even ho

mophobes.
On the produc
tion side, Weiner was
striving to perfect the
mechanics that go
into a play with
seven scene changes,
15 different songs
and 42 light cues.
With tech week half
way through, time
seemed to accelerate

— hut I didn't believe
her when she said she
was worried.
"It's a fun play," Weiner
added, waving her hands
dramatically in the air, "the
characters don't take themselv
too seriously." Nor should she.

Last Call-Fertile in 1996
Rachel is frustrated. Yes,
.she has a wonderful, humorous best

friend named Leo, the second ga
man of the night. Yes, her boyfriend Je
remy is romantic (he gives her roses)
She even has a continuous fantasy se
quence with her future child, affection

ately dubbed "Egg," after the one ovum left
in her ovaries. This is the problem: Rachel,
played skillfully by Julie Arnall, must decide
whether or not to have a child because of a
meltdown in her reproductive system. For
the duration of "Eggs," directed by Alison
Gordon, the 31-year-old New Yorker at
Goldman & Sachs is forced to make choices
under the gun of time.
The difficulties of Rachel's post-feminist
success strikes close to the hearts of upwardly
mobile elites, namely, students at Stanford
University. Rachel has to decide in two weeks
what most women have a good thirty years to
mull over: whether or not to have children
and whether or not this will ruin her career.
But don't be fooled into remorse. This is
play is pure comedy, deftly written by
Michael Green, a fifth-year Human Biology
and Religious Studies double major. He is a
Jewish New Yorker and so is his humor: I
laughed at the same jokes throughout the
four different rehearsals I attended. I admit
loudly that I am also a Jew from New York ex
traction, but the jokes are universal and the
Yiddish is sparse.
1 met Michael in a worn-out room in the
drama department after a Sunday afternoon
rehearsal. He seemed pleased with the play
and his relationship with the director:
"Ali is excellent. We have a good rapport

going." Alter an infinitesimal amount ot
prodding he quickly said about the role of the
writer: "It's excruciating. It's terrible." Ol all
the writers 1 talked to none were as wedded to
their piece as (ireen was to "Eggs."
"You're attached to something. You hand
it over to someone else and you hope it goes
well." 1 le is confident of Gordon but wary of
changes to his play, which is successful but
runs long. It clocked in at an hour and eigh
teen minutes in an early run-through.
"Badenheim" and "Only Connect" are both
roughly forty minutes, juist enough time to
hold the audiences' attention and create dra
matic movement.
"It's really hard for the writer to distance
himself and let the director interpret the play
their way," Alison Gordon said in a separate
interview, but, she continued, "I think the
overall relationship is good."
"I haven't allowed him to come to re
hearsals until we were well on track," she
added. She needed to arrive at her own inter
pretation of the text just as Benjy Jacobson
and liana Weiner had to for their one acts.
Finding a balance between what a writer cre
ated and a director interpreted hasn't been an
easy process for Green and Gordon, but this
isn't what the audience is going to see.
Julie Arnall (the lead) and Victor Wishna
(a supporting actor) stood in a drama de
partment room on a carpet that was clearly a
left-over from the early '70s, when taupe and
pea green were "in" colors. They spoke as if I
wasn't there. As they entranced each other
the young woman at Stanford became a dis
traught New Yorker, and the straight under
grad turned into a gay father of two.
"One day, I want to have kids!" Rachel an
nounced to Leo.
"So?"
"Not today!"
There's a humor to her misery that made me

sympathize with her
character. Later, she
seduces I x*o, a kosher,
gay lew who has
given up on religion
(life is mysterious),
into dreaming about
pepperoni pizza and
other delicacies.
"Bacon isn't just a
food," she said to
him, dwelling on
each word like a I -
900-HOT-SEX op
erator, "it's an expe
rience." Leo sighed
in pleasure, never
having tasted pork.
Leo, who might eye
a cantor but never a
Rabbi, is played bril
liantly by Wishna.
The entire cast of five
is strong and confi
dent: no one actor
overshadows the
other, although Ar
nall clearly has the
dominant role. She
plays it convincingly.
The direction is
tight, well focused
and full of move
ment in an otherwise
static set. The jokes
are constant, hysteri
cally funny and ac

cented by directorial
touches that blossom from the script (follow
the M&M's, toy animals and cuddly baguette).
If the world is a stage,
are doctors the tech crew?
Fvery director I talked to sounded confi
dent about their production. The writers
have long given up their scripts to the inter
pretation of the directors. Now the directors
must work like crazy before the actors take
over. Technical polish remains the last chal
lenge for lacobson, Weiner and Gordon. All
three plays have music, dramatic lighting
sometimes with gels, set props and heavy
sofas, desks and beds.
After each play there is a ten-minute inter
mission for the "runners," stage hands, to dis -
mantle and construct each set. Some pieces of
furniture and some lights will remain the
same, but each play is very different in tone
and location. There is a chronological order
to the night: the thirties give way to the sev
enties and then to the nineties.
For all this there are scores of people who
are rarely known to the audience: the entire
technical crew and the producer, Carrie Cas
selman. But they are all too familiar with the
three directors whose roles end as the house
lights fade.
