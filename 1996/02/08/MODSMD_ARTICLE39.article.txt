## POSSUM DIXON Star Maps 
### 
One minute they're serene and mellow.
I he next, they're pure rock and pep. The
freshest thing about Possum Dixon is that
they sure as hell don't bore you.
In their newest CD, "Star Maps," they
show exactly why they're at the top of the I .A.
alternative scene and rapidly spreading in
popularity. With catchy guitar work (espe
cially in"In I Icr I)isco "and "Radio(Comets")
and profound lyrics, the quartet of Rob
Xabrecky, Robert O'Sullivan, Celso Chavez
and Rich Trend knows how to entertain.
1 Hiring the first couple of tracks, the band
is reminiscent of the Violent lemmes, but
quicker and with a harder edge. Lead vocalist
Xabrecky's voice is soothing, yet resolute as
he sings about twisted relationships and psy
cliotic reality in the alluring City of Angels.
The Ivric s are deeply thought out and smart
ly written, lor example, in "General l.lec
iric. Zabreckv and O'Sullivan, write that
"the world doesn't know me by name, but
onl\ knows me bv number'' when referring
to their day jobs. Meanwhile in the back
ground, a strange, hypnotic tune from the
kiss strums on and on like a heartbeat.
I be last few tracks are more ballad-like
with softer tunes and poignant lyrics that
conjure up the dark, melancholy rhythms of
the Doors. "Personals" exemplifies this
the pain, love and frustration of a relation
ship are expressed with suppressed emotion
and desperation.
Apart from all of this, the band also
demonstrates great guitar work. 1 ach track
has its own distinctive sound that can make
you feel like dancing and singing along, or
moping and crying about an ex love.
You might also be wondering about the
name Possum Dixon. Is it a tribute to some
childhood pet who later became road kill? Or
perhaps its a deliberate juxtaposition of a
furry marsupial with the misspelling of a
honest, dead president? Actually, guitarist

Celso Chavez thought up the name when he
saw the profile of James "Possum" Dixon on
an episode of America's Most Wanted.
Despite the fact that Possum Dixon is
named after a murder suspect, the band pro
duces gritty rock, hard-hitting lyrics and
catchy sounds. These guys are definitely
worth the money, so check them out. In a
word: they're hot!
