cent of the money they pay to the ASSI
each quarter, an increase of nearly 5 per
cent from fall quarter. The ASSU fees art
distributed to campus student groups ap
proved by students in general election. 6
each spring. In past years, refund rates
have climbed as high as 36 percent.
Students am choose to refund part or

all of their special-fee dues, which are in
cluded in the University tuition bill each
quarter.

dent was assessed a $28.88 fee for winter

$22.89.
ASSU Fee Refund Coordinator
Stephanie Li said the increase is natural
as the year progresses. More students
know about the process, so the numbers
naturally increase, she explained. Re
fund requests from fall quarter also
carry through t he entire year, she added.
"There always will bean increase," Li

said. "Perhaps more people know about
it now. . . . It's something that is recog
nized more later in the year."
The increase from fall quarter reflects
a 6 percent increase in graduate student
requests and a 4 percent increase in un
dergraduate student requests. Overall,
2,271 graduate students, or 30.41 per
cent of the population, and 717 under
graduates, or 10.9 percent of the popula
tion, asked for refunds.
MEChA, the Chicano / Latino stu
dent group, was most-refunded, with
students asking to return nearly 21 per
cent of the group's special fees. Other
highly refunded groups included the

Black Student Union, Stanford-in-Gov
ernment, the Stanford American Indian
Organization and the Stanford Chapar
ral.
ASSU Legal Counseling once again
proved to be a popular service: Only
11.25 percent of its special fee was re
funded this quarter.
Part of the general increase may also
be due to changes in the refund process
which allowed students to request a re
fund on the World Wide Web.
"The World Wide Web page is more
accessible," Li said. "I just nope that peo
ple take advantage of the World Wide
Web."
