## Auscultate 
### 
Mainstream, top 40 snobs who decry the
similarity of so-called "alternative rock"
seem to be gaining ground. Only the truly
discerning listener of modern rock radio
could distinguish between myriad, imitative
altema-rockers. An example: l or Squirrels
become the Toadies become Sponge without
cracking a mold. Guitars churn, a hyperac
tive chorus spins off the top, and three min
utes later, pop goes the buzz.
I he first single from the Swedish trio Salt
has been swirling around radio play-lists for
.i month or so now, and you may have heard
it. "bluster" delivers serviceable, listenable
pop-rock. It draws t humpy bass into a chorus
of breezy, contained chaos. I ven the lyrics,
"I'd really like to know some of you / I 'd real
ly like to know where you're heading," sung
with .in invigorating harmony, appeal to
those acquainted with casual bouts of unre
quited longing. But the formula is nothing
new, patented long ago by the breeders, PJ
I larvey and the like.
Salt's debut album, "Auscultate seems si
multaneously aware and ignorant of this ten
dency towards imitation. The thirteen tracks
all battle overtly pop instincts with angular,
ferocious arrangements. What Salt don't
seem to understand, however, is that by sub
verting melody and catchiness, they buy a
one-way ticket to the generic alt-rock
cesspool. "Obsession," "Witty," and "So I
Ached" blend into one unrelenting ugly
mess. Salt don't risk enough to abandon pop

and they're not inventive enough to rock this
hard.
"Honour Me," "Flutter" and "Sense" work
better, mostly because the edges have
blurred. You've heard this brand of friendlier
rock before; it's astringent and compelling at
once. It helps that songwriter Nina Ranisby
hits on the right anguished sentiments such
as "I won't leave until you're close / You won't
leave until I say so," from "Honour Me."
"Auscultate" is not a bad listen. The ap
pealing tracks make up for the turgid ones,
but the real problem is that by not offering
anything new, by not bucking the increasing
ly mimetic trend of alt-rock, Salt may have
released an album you're already tired of.
