# THE 						PASTELS
## "Mobile Safari" 
### 
Droning his loopy, rambling vocals with
just a smidgen of a nasally accent, Pastels'
leader / guitarist Stephen Pastel sounds like a
Scotch version of Calvin Johnson, under
ground hero / K Records honcho / ex-of
Beat Happening / current Halo Bender. Pas
tel's voice careens and meanders, taking a
lazy stroll that lags just behind the pretty,
mid-tempo guitar-pop.
On "Mobile Safari," the Pastels' 1995 LP
which was released Stateside recently, the
revered veteran trio and their Glaswegian
posse of contributors create simple, unaffect
ed rock without becoming boring or formu
laic — kinda in the same way Beat Happen
ing did. The leadoff track "Exploration
Team" shimmies the album to a start, appro
priately laid-back and ponderous for sweet
sentiments, like "Everyone should have a
friend / To lead and to follow / To open up to

/ And to lose control." Rollicking tunes
"Flightpaths to Each Other" and "Strategic
Gear" pick up the momentum, both striking
a nice balance between the pleasant riffs and
Pastel's charmingly awkward delivery.
If anything, it's when the slack vox comes
together with a slack tempo, like on "Base
ment Scam," that the mix sounds off-kilter.
"Exotic Arcade" crosses its wires, too, as if the
singing and the wandering instrumental
arrangement both try to follow a lead that
isn't there.
While Pastel gets tripped up a bit in his
own specialty, drummer Katrina Mitchell
and bassist Aggi give "Mobile Safari" a lift
when they take turns with the wobbly lead
vocals. Like Pastel, each sings at their own
pace, endearing as they lose ground from the
first hook and stagger to the finish. Out of
tune and behind the times, Mitchell hits the

Classic

Yanni

most wistful notes on "Mandarin," an intro
spective memory of a far-off friend. As Aggi
mumbles her incomprehensible lyrics to the
raging intro of the sparkling "Yoga," every
thing comes up rosy because the pieces don't
quite tit right.
