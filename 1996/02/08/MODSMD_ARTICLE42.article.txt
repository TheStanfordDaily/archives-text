## AZTEC CAMERA Frestonia 
### 
Contemporary British pop bands seem to
have built their recent success (at least in
Britain) on some interesting sources. The
most common comparison is between these
groups and the Beatles, but this view is far
from the truth.
In reality, bands such as Blur and Oasis
have far too weak of a basis in rock-and-roll
to claim any true heritage from the Beatles.
What is interpreted as influence is, more
often than not, simply borrowed riffs and
copied hooks.
Instead, what seems to have laid the
strongest foundations for these bands are the
post-new wave British pop bands of the '80s,
such as Aztec Camera. Indeed, one would
have a difficult time believing that this band's
first album came out in 1983 when new-wave
was near its peak.
What this movement emphasized was a
lighter, friendly folk-rock, which was heavy
on witty lyricism and light on musical inno
vation. Aztec Camera's new album, "Fresto
nia," further strengthens this link between
the '80s and '90s.
Sounding remarkably similar to current
British pop music, such as Blur's newest,
" The Great Escape," "Frestonia" reveals that
either Roddy Frame, Aztec Camera's
singer / songwriter, has learned much from
the newest bands or that the new bands have
changed Frame's original formula very little.
Someone is copying someone
Regardless of its similarities to other
music of the present, "Frestonia" does have

some significant moments. Rainy Season,
the opening track, is remarkably strong.
Starting with a sparse Asian melody, the song
fluidly moves from a seamless ballad into a
cathartic rocker, succeeding brilliantly.
Another track, "Phenomenal World," also
delivers a solid impact. In a traditional three
chord song, Frame delivers his message con
vincingly, never detracting from the song's
natural swing.
Unfortunately for Aztec Camera, the
album's music is so monotonous that those
two tracks are the only ones which stand out.
(That they chose to include basically the
same track twice certainly doesn't help.)
All the songs are pleasant pop, but that is
all. They hopelessly blend together .is Frame
using the same formula (strumming guitar,
steady drums) over and over again.
Not a single misplaced note exists on the
album, which is perhaps the problem. With
out a few risks, music becomes stagnant and
uninteresting, which is what Aztec (Camera is
quickly becoming.
