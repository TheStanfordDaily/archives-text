If you don't know what to expect from The
Psyclone Rangers' third album, "The Devil
May Care," the opening drum heat immedi
ately brings the following phrase to mind:
simple, yet mature. Simple in the sense that
their music is not extremely complicated,
and mature in the sense that the band has
definitely established themselves apart from
the hundreds ofalternative / punk bands that
never make it out of the garage.
As the album progresses, the depth of their
music is revealed. Most of the songs definite
ly have a blues-rock influence and they seem
to successfully mix that with what one might
describe as the mellow-punk culture.
The songs center around the vocals of
Jonathan Valania. On "Tilt-A-Whirl," when
Scot Dantzer, P.R. Behler and Jamie Knerr
add background vocals during the chorus,
the vocal talent of the entire group comes
through loud and clear.
The catchiest and most upbeat song on the
album is "Ain't Coin' Down." The driving
drum beat and melodic chorus carry this
song from its start to its quick finish (it's only
two minutes long). By the time you reach the
bluesy guitar solo, you will definitely be
standing therewith your foot tapping and the
chorus floating through your head.
Most of the songs on the album arc not as
upbeat. On "I'm Straight," the band takes the
tempo way down and experiments with the
tremolo sound reminiscent of early slow-surf
rock. This song is a prime of example of now
The Psyclone Rangers take a simple song idea
but apply their mature abilities to leave the
listener in awe, feeling like he or she just left a
bizarre "Twin Peaks' episode.
While the band successfully takes risks and
creates classic, audience-pleasing songs, the
album leaves the listener wanting something
more. The beginning few tracks keep the lis
tener's attention, but as the album progresses
into experimental tracks, it forgets to pull the
listener back into that foot-tapping mood.
