# COMET GAIN
## Casino Classics 
### 
Comet Cain arc an English quintet who
not only let their influences shine through in
their sound, but literally wear their influences
on their sleeve. On the album cover, the band
members pose with a few of their favorite
records and, inside the (ID booklet, each band
member lists his or her favorite bands, books,
movies and miscellany. This produces an inter
esting sample of what appears to be the cool
canon for trendy English youth today: bands
ranging from Sonic Youth and the Beastie Boys
to the Pastels and Oasis, and books such as
"The Bell Jar" and "A Taste of Honey."
Comet Cain's sound clearly contains pieces
of other bands. Roughly half of the songs on
"Casino Classics" are bouncy-hammond
organ flavored, girl-sung numbers, a sound
reminiscent of the band's Oxford compatriots
1 leavenly as well as songs by '60s singers Sandie
Shaw and Petula Clark.
On the other half of the album (guitarist
I )avid C christian s songs), the influence of label
mates/ precursors Huggy Bear is obvious. In
deed, Comet Cain are a product of the noise
scene led by 1 luggy Bear in early '90s England.
On this album, however, the band manages to
the render the rough edges of Muggy Bear's
punk sound less abrasive; the songs are a bit
more melodic and a great ileal less angry.
Comet (iain are also a reflection of the Eng
lish mod resurgence of the past few years (in
the liner notes, they list "racing jackets" and
"tops with stripes" among their favorite
things). While they cite current mod superstars
Blur as one of their favorite bands, (hornet C iain
differ from them in one crucial way: "Casino
("lassies" contains none of the postmodern
irony which drenches Blur's music. ("halk it up
either to the punk influence or to youth, but
(kimet C iain are earnest and guileless, tree from
thcaffectednessof such worldly British media
darlings.
Above all Comet Cain presents itself as a
bunch of kids having fun making music and
fine music at that. As they say in their liner
notes, "Low budget doesn't have to mean low
quality." And if this album is any indication of
that contention, they are right.
