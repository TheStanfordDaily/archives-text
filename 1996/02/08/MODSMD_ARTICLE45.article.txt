## French Twist 
### 
"French Twist," hilled as
the film that "shocked
even the French," tries to

live up to its name. The foreign flick careens
through the life of a gigolo-esque hushand
with no discernible refractory period, his
gorgeous wife with .1 penchant lor wearing
aprons (and nothing else) and a heavy-set
lesbian whodrivesa pastel van complete with
a Hindu love goddess spray painted on the
door.
Unfortunately, director losiane Balasko
relies heavily on the would-be sensationalis
tic plot to engage audience interest. But the

thin gimmicks will prove disappointing to a
'90s audience weaned on Madonna's coned
breasts and Boy George's mascara'd good
looks. Been there (yawn). Seen that.
The love triangle — minus the lesbian
looks like something out of a Betty Crocker
relationship handbook. Fori stays home with
the kids and is upset that her husband doesn't
spend enough time at home. She is seduced
by Marie )o (our featured lesbian) who gives
her the attention she isn't receiving from her
husband.
Faurente, whose previously mentioned
refractory period allows him affairs on the
order of three a day, is enraged when he finds

out his wife is cheating on him. The familiar
male hypocrisy and housewife frustration
comes across like a Peg Bundy soliloquy.
Yet the movie is saved from total failure by
the energy of its actors and its character devel
opment. The combined efforts of Victoria Abril
(l.ori), Alain Chabat (Laurente) and Josiane
Balasko (who plays the part of Marie Jo better
than she directs) add lustre to the tired plot.
Laurente finds he loves his wife, l.ori as
serts her presence in the relationship and
Marie Jo helps them all to learn the necessity
of forgiveness.
One unfortunate omission in the movie is
the role of the children. Laurente and Lori's

two children play in the background while
their nuclear family is repeatedly disrupted.
Hither the children should not have been in
the movie at all or the children's reaction to
their parents' infidelities should have been
discussed — another instance in which Bal
asko neglects real impact for sensationalism.
"French Twist" may be shocking to the
Knglish (with the exception of Hugh — but
that's taken for Granted), but this is definite
ly not its American appeal. The film s virtue
is not its ability to shock with alternative sex
uality but its characters' willingness to learn
about acceptance in love.
