# Angels & Insects
## 
### 
Although "Angels & In
sects" is set in Victorian
Fngland, you won't find

very much of" the literary airs and gentle ro
mance that have made the recent adapta
tions ol lane Austen novels so popular. Sure,
these characters speak in lofty British a*,
cents and the women wear corsets. There's
even some highbrow talk about Charles
|)arwin. But these Victorians are hardly re
pressed, especially when it comes to sex.
This film is more like the illegitimate off
spring of .1 period piece.
William Adamson (played with exasperat
ing evenness hv Mark Rylance) is a naturalist
recently returned to Kngland from the Ama
zon. I le goes to work for the patriarch of the
wealthy Alabaster family and promptly falls
in love with his benefactor s eldest daughter.
I ugenia Alabaster (I'atsy Kensit) sounds just
like her name : a golden, ethereal combina
tion of the most peerless genes in the county.
She gives off pheromones by simply lowering
her eyelashes, lb his surprise, William wins
the hand of his beloved, and soon he and 1 u
genia are churning out perfect, blond Al
abaster babies.
At this point, you half expect the couple
to live happily ever after. But, as always,
there are interfering relatives. There's F.uge
nu's crude brother, 1 dgar, who's particular
ly keen on keeping the family gene pool
clean of riffraff. There's also Matty Cromp
ton (an excellent Kristin Scott Thomas), a
poor relation who's kept on as a governess.
If I ugenia is the social butterfly of the fami
ly, Matty is its moth. In contrast to the fair
Alabaster women in their bright gowns,
Matty looks like she's just stepped out of
Jane Campion's "The Piano." Dark and un
attractive, she's as much an outsider to the

family as William is. But when Matty and
William bond over the discovery of an ant
colony, you know that these two bug-enthu
siasts are made for each other.
This is the kind of film in which the visu
als arc everything, and filmmakers Phillip
and Belinda 1 laas go crazy with the analogy
between the Victorian household and the
insect world. The women sport antennae

like hairdos and wear dresses patterned after
butterfly wings (Eugenia makes a stunning
fashion statement with her black-and-yel
low striped bumblebee number). Lady Al
abaster, the Queen Bee of the household,
lounges about looking like a fat white grub.
And you know that once someone starts ex
amining the Alabaster family's past through
a magnifying glass, some particularly nasty

bugs are going to be found chewing away at
the woodwork.
Based on a novella by A.S. Hyatt, "Angels &
Insects" is a fascinating cross between a Goth
ic melodrama and an entomological farce. II
it had a moral, it would be this: beware of the
Victorian angel.. .particularly when she's got
braids that look like insect feelers.
