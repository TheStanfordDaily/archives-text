# The
						Juror
## 
### 
Someone wasted a po
tentially terrific psycho
logical thriller when they

made this Hick. "The Juror" disappoints its
audience with a dark and dull delivery and,
just as if you were viewing the title character's
artwork (sculptures in boxes that you "see"
hy touching), you can feel the presence of a
good movie hut you can never actually sec it.
The shaky and grainy black-and-white
footage of a murder serves as the opening
scene of this movie ((lan we say "The 112 ugi
tive"?). Next, we get a scene from the trial of
Louis Buffano, your typical Mafia crime boss
from New York City accused of giving the or
ders for the murder. While the jury is being
selected for the trial, the weakest plot point of

"The Juror" is exposed: there is absolutely no
good reason for Demi Moore's character,
Annie Laird, to agree to jury duty when she is
a single, working mother and the judge is
more than willing to let her go.
At any rate, Annie Laird's stupidity gets her
into trouble. The Mafia sets its hopes on her for
a favorable verdict and Alec Baldwin's bad-guy
working-with-the-mob character sets to work,
putting her under complete surveillance and
posing as an art buyer to gain her trust. 1 lowev
er, after only five minutes of trust-building, he
reveals himself to Annie as the psycho-killer
and possibly the controlling force of the Mafia
family, a mysterious figure known only as The
Teacher. The film's mildly complicated plot in
volves a couple of intelligent twists and turns,
probably due to the fact that this movie was

based on the best-selling (and coherent) book
of the same name by George Dawes C ireen.
Alec Baldwin fans, you may not want to
read this paragraph. He sucks. The only thing
about his formulaic lonely psycho character
that is convincing and appropriate is his
creepy, gravelly voice. But Baldwin's voice is
naturally like that. Other than talking natu
rally, ho just purses his lips in an effort to look
like a determined sociopath.
Demi Moore, on the other hand, has a few
believably intense scenes of fear and hate, in
cluding the one exciting moment when she is
trapped by The Teacher who is driving per
ilously on a curvy mountain road. The rest of
the time, she is her usual cry-baby self who
lets the tears stream down her face for no ap
parent reason.

Nondescript music accompanies the per
petually dark and rainy settings. You might
think that the exotic setting change to
Guatemala (don't ask) might brighten things
up a hit hut it is always cloudy there. The film
crew must have had very bad luck with the
weather when they were filming this.
After the trial you cannot wait for the
movie to end, but wait! There's another 45
minutes! When the ending finally arrives, the
presumed terror in"The Juror" turns into
unintentional comedy. During the final
scene, people in the audience laughed at Un
predictable outcome, not really caring one
way or the other about what happens to the
bad guy — because the pathetic Baldwin
doesn't really give you much to hate.
