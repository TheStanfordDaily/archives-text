## Nobody loves Me 
### 
"I am strong. I am smart
I love and am loved."
Fanny 1 ink repeats to her

self this phrase each night, in the hope that
she will someday believe it.
From German director Doris Dorre
("Men") comes "Nobody Loves Me," an off
tilt black comedy about the hopelessly Hail
ing love life of a German airport frisker. Ap
proaching that daunting age of thirty years,
Fanny (Maria Schrader) has been single for
an unbearable four years. She has even
turned to a Conscious Dying class — in
which the members put plastic bags over
their heads, talk of suicide and even build
coffins, with the matter-of-fact preaching of
their mentor in the background — to help
her deal with her malaise.
One day, however, she meets a mysterious
psychic and everything in her life changes.
Orfeo (Pierre Sanoussi-Bliss), a gay black
palm reader, informs her— for 230 marks —
that the last love of her life is coming soon.
Then along comes Lothar Sticker, the new
building manager that fits Orfeo's descrip
tion of Fanny's lover. Crashing her car into
his, she begins a relationship that is ultimate

ly doomed.
She comes on too strong. 1 le betrays her to
seduce a string of cliched blond bimbos.
Upon finding l othar with her best and only
friend Charlotte, Fanny sinks into a deep de
pression.
Her friendship with Orfeo, however, be
gins to bloom. As they spend more and more
time together, they each find the closest thing
to a soul mate they have ever had. Fventually,
Orfeo falls ill and — telling her the story of
his mystical, cosmic origin — Fanny prepares
for his death. Fmerging from the experience
a different woman, Fanny finally gives up her
blind search for love.
The film starts strongly and the comic nu
ances of Fannys character — hanging from a
tree, sleeping with a raggedy doll, "eating
nothing with eyes" — are brought to life by
the quirky performance of Maria Schrader.
Dorre cleverly weaves together the scenes in
which Fanny's myriad high-rise neighbors
appear, each slightly out-of-touch but
nonetheless real. Better still are the tender
scenes in the latter part of the film showing
the unlikely kinship between Orfeo and
Fanny. In the film's most moving moment,
Fanny arrives home on her thirtieth birthday
distraught, only to find an awaiting Orfeo,

painted with birth
day cake in hand,
leading her in a
cathartic dance to
Kdith Piafs "Non,
Je Ne Regrette
Rien."
However, "No
body Loves Me"
moves much too
slowly to keep the
audience's atten
tion. The sugar
coated ending, sup
posedly the fruits of
a long process
within Fanny,
seems to come out
of nowhere and has
that tacked-on feel
ing of anincongru
ent finale. Addi
tionally, the con
tinued use of the

"half-full, half-empty" cliche is irritating and
the cinematography is not impressive.
Although worth seeing for Dorre's con
scious parallel between an isolated Fanny fi
nally opening up to the rest of the world and

Germany's similar transformation, the film
suffers from a dragged-out plot and weak
ending. "Nobody l.oves Me" is not the film it
could have been.
