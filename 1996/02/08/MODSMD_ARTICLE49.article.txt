Granted, I know
ingly chose to re
view a movie about

13 sweaty teenage boys running around a
boat with their shirts off. but there were
other potential strengths in "White Squall"
its strong story; its gripping young cast of
up-and-coming actors and its accomplished
director Ridley Scott ("Blade Runner,"
Thelma and Louise"). Nevertheless, thead
venture-at-sea "White Squall" disappoints
by staying in the shallow end, avoiding more
ambitious development.
The story is a tragedy, involving a freak ac
cident which strikes the group of Ocean
Academy students sailing home from a year of
work and study under the supervision of their
tough-as-nails captain, Christopher Sheldon
i Jeff Bridges). In the aftermath of the ordeal,
"Skipper" is accused of negligence leading to
the loss of lives; the remaining crew faces loy
alties torn between their blame-seeking par
L'ntsand the man who taught them the motto,
'Where we go one, we go all."
At least that's what the movie's publicity
department thinks the film is about. 1 lowev
„t, in order to set the scene for this turn of
.■vents, most of the movie chronicles the
months of maturing and male bonding the

hoys undergo aboard the "Albatross," reduc
ing "White Squall" to another inspiring
teacher movie. Scott leaves only a few min
utes at the end of the two hours to confront
the accident and the consequences which

could have made the movie unique.
The emotional impact of the film lies in
the development of the boys' personalities
and friendships, not in the long, brutal scene
depicting the ship's demise, and certainly not

in the sappy conclusion, which approaches a
carbon copy of the final scene of "Dead Poets
Society" (think "Oh Captain, my Captain").
The young cast features many faces famil
iar to any seasoned reader of Sassy, including
Scott Wolf ("Party of live"), Balthazar Getty
("Lord of the Flies") and David Lascher
("Blossom"), but the most memorable role
was played by relative unknown Ryan
Phillippe as a sensitive cherub forced to face
his fears by the unsympathetic Skipper.
Bridges himself displays little range .is the
boys' substitute father figure, appearing
most often in dark sunglasses and a stoic lace,
with the only evidence of emotion being a
sudden clenching of his jaw muscles.
"White Squall'' wants to offer a story of
boys learning the power and strength ol
community, breaking away from their up
tight 1950s parents to become men and
demonstrating their new maturity by their
action in time of crisis. But without sufficient
justification, the conclusion seems abrupt
and unrealistic. It's probably not a good sign
when an entire theater bursts into laughter at
the dramatic climax of the film.
