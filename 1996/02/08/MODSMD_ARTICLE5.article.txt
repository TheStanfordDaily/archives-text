# New technology gives you just the fax (in 3-D)

Thanks to a breakthrough discovery at
Stanford's Computer Graphics Laboratory,
the ability to fax your mom a three-dimen
sional replica of your latest artistic master
piece may be just around the corner.
A research team headed by Computer Sci
ence and Electrical Engineering Prof. Marc
Levoy has developed the technology to create
highly accurate three-dimensional computer
models of real-world objects, which am then
be electronically sent to manufacturers.
Once scanned and sent, identical copies of
the original object can be made.
The revolutionary technique was tested

two weeks ago, when Levoy's group scanned
in a small statuette of a "happy Buddha,"
sent the computer model to 3-D Systems in
Valencia, Calif, and received an identical
version of the statuette a few days later.
The idea of using computer graphics to
create real-life replicas is not new. But the
techniques used in this development are
faster and more accurate, researchers say. It
represents a solution to the "central problem
in the computer vision field for 20 years,"
Levoy said.
The actual scanning process involves set
ting the model on a rotating platform and
using a red laser light scanner and
camera to create the computerized
image.
"The scanner emits a plane of
laser light and 'paints' a line onto
the model," said Brian Curless, a
doctoral student working on the
project. A camera then observes
the profile of this stripe and uses
the data to create a "mesh" de
scribing the surface.

'The scanner emits
a plane of laser
light and paints' a
line onto the
model.'

After about 58 scans, re
searchers used the data for the
Buddha to create a highly detailed
computer model consisting of
about 800,000 polygons.
Earlier, lengthier processes
would have required a person to
manually touch individual points
on the object with a probe, said doc
toral student Brian Freyburger,
also a team member. In contrast,
the new method takes only a few

hours.
Someday, if the computer mod
eling technology can be combined
with the ability to instantaneously
create a tangible object, one might
be able to fax identical versions of
real-life objects back and forth.
"It's a very cool concept," Frey
burger said.
The idea of "faxing" an actual
object might seem like science fic
tion, but there are countless appli
cations that can be used with these
developments as they presently
stand. Companies like Industrial
Light and Magic — which creates
special effects — have a need for
computerized versions of real-life
objects and are interested in Stan
ford's technology.
In addition, Levoy described
how archaeologists can use the
technique to sain rare artifacts
and "send models all over the
world." Companies such as Ford
can use computer models to simpli
fy the complicated process of de
signing cylinder heads, he added.
The group is still working on
improving its scanning procedure,
with researchers looking into the
"next best view problem" — inac
curacies caused when the laser
can't reach portions of the object.
The team also hopes to com
pletely automate the scanning
process.
As for scanning other objects,
Freyburger asserted, "(Curless) is
always on the lookout for things to
scan. . . . We're really willing to try
anything."

For its "fax" trip to Southern California, the "happy Buddha" statue shown at the far left became the 3-D
computer model in the center. That electronic model was used as a model for the plastic replica on the
