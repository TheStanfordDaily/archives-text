# New technology gives you just the fax (in 3-D)

Thanks to a breakthrough discovery at
Stanford's Computer Graphics Laboratory,
the ability to fax your mom a three-dimen
sional replica of your latest artistic master
piece may be just around the corner.
A research team headed by Computer Sci
ence and Electrical Engineering Prof. Marc
Levoy has developed the technology to create
highly accurate three-dimensional computer
models of real-world objects, which am then
be electronically sent to manufacturers.
Once scanned and sent, identical copies of
the original object can be made.
The revolutionary technique was tested

two weeks ago, when Levoy's group scanned
in a small statuette of a "happy Buddha,"
sent the computer model to 3-D Systems in
Valencia, Calif, and received an identical
version of the statuette a few days later.
The idea of using computer graphics to
create real-life replicas is not new. But the
techniques used in this development are
faster and more accurate, researchers say. It
represents a solution to the "central problem
in the computer vision field for 20 years,"
Levoy said.
The actual scanning process involves set
ting the model on a rotating platform and
