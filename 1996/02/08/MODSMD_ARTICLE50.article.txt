"Angela," opening this Friday in San I ran
cisco and Berkeley, is an intense exploration
of the spiritual quest that sustains us and t ho
sometimes tragic detour at the end ot such a
journey.
Written and directed by Rebecca Miller,
daughter of acclaimed playwright Arthur
Miller, "Angela" focuses on the lives of the
hauntingly beautiful and visionary 10-year
old title character (as portrayed by the preco
cious Ruth Rhyne) and her 6-year-old sister
1 Hie (Charlotte Blythe). The children ot an
u 11 p red ic table, m a nic -dep ressi ve mot h e r a n d

a well-meaning yet absent father, Angela and
Hllie seek retreat from their familial instabil
ity by way of inner purification. It is through
Angela's spiritual journey that the audience
witnesses the clash between her reality and
her fatal imagination.
Winner of both the Filmmaker's Trophy
and also Best Cinematography for a Dramat
ic Feature at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival,
the film's unpolished footage evokes a sense
of nostalgia for youth's simplicity. The scenes
seem quite untouched — as in one instance
where the microphone is visible at the top ot
the frame while the girls wander through
town. The hazy quality of the film reminds
one of movies from the early seventies, an era
when most Generation X-ers were children

ourselves.
The contrast between Angela's reality and
her destructive imagination is evident as she
interacts with the characters who cross her
path. When Angela encounters a child mo
lester, she believes him to be her angelic guide
to heaven. (The ease with which he seduces
her is disturbing.) Although this moment
haunts the viewer, Angela fails to notice the
shadow of doom hanging over her fate.
As with any tragic character, we feel An
gela is inevitably destined to perish before
her time. I )riven by a deadly imagination and
insatiable spiritual quest, "Angela" leads the
audience to a powerful conclusion that leaves
no viewer emotionally unscathed.
