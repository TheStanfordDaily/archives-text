## Kristie Lü Stout Attack of the museumrats 
### 
The museum is oft considered the sanc
tified repository of objets d'art, a secular
cathedral where the Rembrandt is meticu
lously conserved and its luscious skins-of
oil properly observed. The museum is oft
considered the custodian of aesthetic rari
ties that exist only to stimulate thought,
even thoughts that threaten the very con
ventions that society holds bear—
Whatevah. I liken it to a shopping mall.
Whether your highbrow sensibilities like
it or not, the museum ain't the marbled n'
columned purveyor of zee beaux arts. It
ain't the stockpile of apolitical aesthetics in
a free society. It ain't the Stonehenge for the
believers of "art for art's sake." The modern
museum is a bona-fide-100%-Ripley's-be
lieve-it-or-not-cross-my-heart-and-hope-
to dial-1-800-COLLECT Mass Entertain
ment Machine®.
Granted, the flaming ochre ceramic tiles
of the Orange Julius counter hide in shame
when compared to the tastefully bleached
pinewood table at the museum lobby

espresso bar. Granted, Radio Shack is a far
cry from the commemorative Robert Map
plethorpe exhibition room. But the roots
of museum culture dwell intimately with
its hick cousin from the other side o' the
tracks, the neighborhood Mall of America.
Like mallrats ever affixed to their food
court hot-dog-on-a-stick, museumrats are
leeches to their culture zone. Museumrats
pack the opening of the SFMOMA and
cram their bodies inside the De Young for
just one whiff of that Impressionist oil (and
a chance to walk home with a commemora
tive poster to prove: "Hey. / was there. I've
seen the real thing, bay-bceec.").
Guided by the autocratic voice of the
Walkman guided tour, admittees of the Le
gion of I lonor in San Francisco shuffle for
ward from art stand to art stand, browsing
through the wares of multiple generations
of artisans:
"Behold! It's Rodin's "The Kiss..." I
must get my grubby consumerite hands on
a pewter replica for the bookshelf in my of

fice!"
"Oh. My. God. It's a Matisse. I mustbuy
the postcard."
"[Mary Mother of Dios! It's the bronze
head of' Victor Hugo!' 1 must, I must, I
must obtain this bust!!!"
At the Louvre, museumrats fight the
crowds to slither towards The Da Vinci®,
desperate to get just one iota of a shred of a
scintilla of a ghost of a particle of highbrow
cultchah:
"Aha! I've seen It! I'm more cultured
than Yoplait!"
Museumrats flock to their curated
palaces in search of highbrow distraction
to relieve themselves of their banal every
day affairs. Like the escapist fashion bou
tiques that pimple the Mall of America, the
museum provides the same showcase of
hallucinatory identities.
Whereas the mallrat hunts for the Mer
chant Ivory Heathcliff-sipping-Earl Gray
aesthetic at Laura Ashley, the museumrat
pacifies his/her anglophilia with a Turner

or Constable landscape. Whereas the mall
rat salivates upon eyeing a taffeta floor
length sequined gown at Jessica McClin
tock, the museumrat lurks in the rococo
room — relishing the sumptuous gowns of
the portrait sitters, chubby cherubs and
powdered men in heels. While Chagall en
thusiasts line up to coo at his blithe pas
toral paintings, Esprit groupies lunge for
that bumpkin girl sun dress basking in the
window display.
For non-conformist museumrats, a trip
to ogle Monet's hyper-familiar water lilies
is the Gap of museum hopping.
But 1 shan't merely reduce the museum
to a strip mall. The museum ain't only the
estranged twin of the Great Mall, it's the
Great Physical Challenge. It's the Dante
esque fifth canto that coerces the exhibit
weary and drastically-imbalanced to stum
ble into the museum cafd and begrudging
ly purchase that $5.45 foccacia crumpet.
Enjoy the crumpet.
And museum-hop 'till you drop.
