## Immunology center stresses need for cooperation 
### Adam Kemezis Contributing writer 
Reflecting the School of Medicine's new
priority toward interdisciplinary research, a
newly-created center hopes to facilitate in
terdepartmental cooperation and provide
incentives for faculty researching immunol
ogy.
The ('enter for Clinical Immunology at
Stanford is an interdisciplinary program in
volving 75 faculty members from 13 depart
ments, ranging from surgery to microbiolo
gy. The faculty includes both research and
clinical physicians and focuses on the treat
ment of diseases of the immune system, in

cluding multiple sclerosis, insulin-deficient
diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.
Bringing together doctors from different
departments and work settings, a so-called
"Bench-to-Bedside Initiative," was one of
the top priorities identified by Medical
School Dean Eugene Bauer in bis recent
State of the School address.
The idea is to move to "a center-based
and program-based medical school rather
than a departmental one," said Molecular
Pharmacology Prof. Helen Blau, co-chair of
the Gene Therapy Task Force, who is in
volved with new initiative.
Although the center had an
official fund-raising opening last
June, Medicine Prof. C. Garri
son Fathman, the director of the
center, said that work actually
began after a faculty retreat last
November when interdepart
mental efforts were identified as
a major priority.
Fathman said current work
on immune system diseases is
done by different departments,
in spite of the fact that insulin
deficient diabetes, for example,
is more similar in important
ways to other immune system
disorders than to other forms of

diabetes.
The center, Fathman said, is
receiving considerable govern
ment support for its research
through the National Institutes
of Health, as well as its own
fund-raising efforts.
He also said the center looks
forward to moving eventually
into a new building — which has
not yet been designed — devoted
to what he called "translational
medicine."
Aside from research, Fath
man said the center hopes to en
gage in educational work, in
cluding seminars to bring to
gether doctors from different
fields and classes for medical
students which teach interdisci
plinary methods of research.
A working eroun from the

Medical School recently recom
mended that steps be taken to
provide students and faculty at
all levels with incentives to en
gage in interdisciplinary work.
The Medical School has not
always made interdepartmental
cooperation a priority, Fathman
said. He explained that the Med
ical School has developed with
departments becoming "dis
tinct, vertically integrated
units."
"Lines of communication are
well-established within depart
ments, hut not between depart
ments," Fathman said.
He also said the school's ad
ministration had not been recep
tive to his program until recent
changes in leadership. Such pro
grams all the more necessary.

Fathman continued, because the
ability to bring the laboratory
breakthroughs directly into pa
tient. care would provide "the
differentiation which would set
apart a university hospital."
Current promotion practices
discourage interdi sciplinary
work because the main factor in
decisions is usually independent
research, and scientists are
therefore hesitant to share cred
it, according to Medicine Prof.
Karl Blume.
Blume suggested that promo
t ion and funding processes bo re
designed to reward interdiscipli
nary work, particularly among
students and junior faculty.
"The more junior people you
bring in there, the more likely
il's going to occur," Blume said.
