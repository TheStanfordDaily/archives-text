## Immunology center stresses need for cooperation 
### Adam Kemezis Contributing writer 
Reflecting the School of Medicine's new
priority toward interdisciplinary research, a
newly-created center hopes to facilitate in
terdepartmental cooperation and provide
incentives for faculty researching immunol
ogy.
The ('enter for Clinical Immunology at
Stanford is an interdisciplinary program in
volving 75 faculty members from 13 depart
ments, ranging from surgery to microbiolo
gy. The faculty includes both research and
clinical physicians and focuses on the treat
ment of diseases of the immune system, in

cluding multiple sclerosis, insulin-deficient
diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.
Bringing together doctors from different
departments and work settings, a so-called
"Bench-to-Bedside Initiative," was one of
the top priorities identified by Medical
School Dean Eugene Bauer in bis recent
State of the School address.
The idea is to move to "a center-based
and program-based medical school rather
than a departmental one," said Molecular
Pharmacology Prof. Helen Blau, co-chair of
the Gene Therapy Task Force, who is in
volved with new initiative.
