# Dance that's strictly ballroom

"All right, class! Face the
music!"
For a woman who barely
reaches 5 feet, Robin Rebello
has surprising vocal power.
Immediately, 40 couples snap
to attention, their eyes on the
small stereo at the back of the
pym.
"Beginning formation for
the Viennese waltz, right turn.
Men, look towards the brick
wall. Women, arch your
backs." Rebello clicks on the
music, then grabs a partner to
demonstrate.
Soon the room is full of
swirling couples. Some drift
effortlessly in their black
Capezio dance shoes, their
posture erect. Others trip halt
ingly along, necks craned to
avoid hitting their neighbors.
One or two couples go hurtling
into the wall. But despite vary
ing skill levels, they're all in
this together. They're all
members of the Stanford Ball
room Dance Club.
Ballroom is big at Stanford.
This year's Ballroom Dance
Club president, Eric Swanson,
estimates club membership at
about 150. "In the last couple
of years the club has really ex
panded," said Swanson, a
graduate student in econom

ics.
When the club was founded
in 1987, it was a humble outfit.
A small band of graduate stu
dents met Rebello through
community-wide dances and
asked her to help them start a
club of their own. Rebello
agreed to teach a workshop in
April of that year. Soon after
wards, she was regularly
teaching ballroom classes.
"I enjoy teaching Stanford
people, because they're fun
and they learn very quickly,"
said Rebello. "I show a step
once and they'll get it. They're
young and exuberant and a
good match for my energy."
Early members practiced in
the Old Union clubhouse,
which at that point had a hard
wood floor. When the floor was
carpeted, the club moved to its
current home, Roble Gym,
which was better equipped to
handle the club's growing
numbers.
Now, every Sunday after
noon, Roble is packed with stu
dents in Rebello's beginning,
intermediate and advanced
classes. Club members also at
tend Friday night dances in
Palo Alto and Saturday after
noon technique classes. For
those who can't get enough, the
Stanford Department of Athlet
ics offers social dance classes
