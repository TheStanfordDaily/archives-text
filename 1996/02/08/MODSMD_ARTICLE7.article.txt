# Dance that's strictly ballroom

"All right, class! Face the
music!"
For a woman who barely
reaches 5 feet, Robin Rebello
has surprising vocal power.
Immediately, 40 couples snap
to attention, their eyes on the
small stereo at the back of the
pym.
"Beginning formation for
the Viennese waltz, right turn.
Men, look towards the brick
wall. Women, arch your
backs." Rebello clicks on the
music, then grabs a partner to
demonstrate.
Soon the room is full of
swirling couples. Some drift
effortlessly in their black
Capezio dance shoes, their
posture erect. Others trip halt
ingly along, necks craned to
avoid hitting their neighbors.
One or two couples go hurtling
into the wall. But despite vary
ing skill levels, they're all in
this together. They're all
members of the Stanford Ball
room Dance Club.
Ballroom is big at Stanford.
This year's Ballroom Dance
Club president, Eric Swanson,
estimates club membership at
about 150. "In the last couple
of years the club has really ex
panded," said Swanson, a
graduate student in econom

ics.
When the club was founded
in 1987, it was a humble outfit.
A small band of graduate stu
dents met Rebello through
community-wide dances and
asked her to help them start a
club of their own. Rebello
agreed to teach a workshop in
April of that year. Soon after
wards, she was regularly
teaching ballroom classes.
"I enjoy teaching Stanford
people, because they're fun
and they learn very quickly,"
said Rebello. "I show a step
once and they'll get it. They're
young and exuberant and a
good match for my energy."
Early members practiced in
the Old Union clubhouse,
which at that point had a hard
wood floor. When the floor was
carpeted, the club moved to its
current home, Roble Gym,
which was better equipped to
handle the club's growing
numbers.
Now, every Sunday after
noon, Roble is packed with stu
dents in Rebello's beginning,
intermediate and advanced
classes. Club members also at
tend Friday night dances in
Palo Alto and Saturday after
noon technique classes. For
those who can't get enough, the
Stanford Department of Athlet
ics offers social dance classes

and t he Vintage Dance Ensemble.
The explosive growth of ball
room at Stanford is reflected at
many other colleges and universi
ties. A search of the World Wide
Web reveals no less than 75 home
pages for collegiate ballroom
dance clubs. Harvard and Cornell
have clubs; so do University of
Saskatchewan and University of
Tokyo. MIT has the granddaddy
oft hem all: a 25-vear-old club fea
turing a separate, 20-member
professional competition ensem
ble.
Swanson and others agree that
ballroom's rise in popularity
among twentysomethings can bo
attributed to many causes. Popu
lar films have helped: The genera
tion weaned on "Footloose" has
graduated to "Swing Kids'' and
the fiery paso doble scene in
"Strictly Ballroom." The struc
ture (if ballroom dancing is also
appealing. Who wouldn't yearn
for the tnambo after years of the

inosh pit?
"Interest in ballroom dancing
is cyclical," said kebello. "When 1
was young, there were lots of kids
into ballroom dancing, but then it
got to be so that young people
wouldn't be caught dead doing
that old fuddy-duddy stuff."
I'hird-year medical student
Gary I'laner family followed
such a cycle.
"Almost all of my grandpar
ents danced when they wore my
age," said I'laner "My parents
didn't dance, and now I do I think
t here - a real resurgence going on,
because I see people of all ages
dancing."
Most Stanford students, how
ever, are attracted to ballroom
dancing's social possibilities as
much as to t lie dancing itself.
"This is a very social event at a
time when many people may be
working by themselves in front of
a terminal somewhere," wrote
John Beale in an e-mail message
sent from his particular terminal.
Beale, a graduate student in ap
plied physics and t he club's former
president, believes dance is a good
respite from work as well as a way

to meet new people.
The promise of social activity it
the reason most students gave 112 or
participating in Stanford's ball
room club. And, although none of
them admitted it, the club also
gives students a chance to look
sharp at Stanford's annual Vien
nese Ball.
Some students, however, arc
looking far beyond the ball, and
even far beyond Stanford. They
sec the club as a step up into the
world of competitive ballroom
dancing.
Almost every year, some club
members join either amateur or
professional ballroom dance com
pel it ions. The Bay Area is particu
larly ripe with such activity. Each
year, I'('-Berkeley hosts the Bay
Area University Open. San Fran
cisco State and San Jose State reg
ularly host competit ions.
The cost of competitions, how
ever, can be steep.
Start with the shoes. It'ss6sto
$120 for a pair of dancing shoes.
And those are American shoes.
The better shoes, imported shoes,
are 50 percent to 60 percent more.
Professional lessons cost be

tween $35 and $90 an hour. Add
to that compact discs of ball
room music, which are twice as
expensive as regular compact
discs because they have to be im
ported.
Finally, the crown jewel of all
ballroom compel it ion: the clothes.
Ballroom clot hes, famous for their
frills and 112 rou-frou, have prices as
extravagant as their hand-beaded
bodices.
The women's international
stvle ball gown runs about $3,000.
For the men, tails cost between
$1,000 and $1,500. One top-of
the-line suit, made in Japan, is
$2,500.
In part because of cost consid
erations and in part because of the
time that competitions require,
most current Stanford club mem
bers prefer social dancing to com
pel itive danc ing.
"1 still don't know if I'll ever use
this outside of Stanford," said
Swanson.
Swanson and others simply
dance for the joy of dancing,
pleased to discover that their
grandparents may have been on
to something after all.

The promise of social activity it
the reason most students gave 112 or
participating in Stanford's ball
room club. And, although none of
them admitted it, the club also
gives students a chance to look
sharp at Stanford's annual Vien
nese Ball.
Some students, however, arc
looking far beyond the ball, and
even far beyond Stanford. They
sec the club as a step up into the
world of competitive ballroom
dancing.
Almost every year, some club
members join either amateur or
professional ballroom dance com
pel it ions. The Bay Area is particu
larly ripe with such activity. Each
year, I'('-Berkeley hosts the Bay
Area University Open. San Fran
cisco State and San Jose State reg
ularly host competit ions.
The cost of competitions, how
ever, can be steep.
Start with the shoes. It'ss6sto
$120 for a pair of dancing shoes.
And those are American shoes.
The better shoes, imported shoes,
are 50 percent to 60 percent more.
Professional lessons cost be

tween $35 and $90 an hour. Add
to that compact discs of ball
room music, which are twice as
expensive as regular compact
discs because they have to be im
ported.
Finally, the crown jewel of all
ballroom compel it ion: the clothes.
Ballroom clot hes, famous for their
frills and 112 rou-frou, have prices as
extravagant as their hand-beaded
bodices.
The women's international
stvle ball gown runs about $3,000.
For the men, tails cost between
$1,000 and $1,500. One top-of
the-line suit, made in Japan, is
$2,500.
In part because of cost consid
erations and in part because of the
time that competitions require,
most current Stanford club mem
bers prefer social dancing to com
pel itive danc ing.
"1 still don't know if I'll ever use
this outside of Stanford," said
Swanson.

"All right, class! Face the
music!"
For a woman who barely
reaches 5 feet, Robin Rebello
has surprising vocal power.
Immediately, 40 couples snap
to attention, their eyes on the
small stereo at the back of the
pym.
"Beginning formation for
the Viennese waltz, right turn.
Men, look towards the brick
wall. Women, arch your
backs." Rebello clicks on the
music, then grabs a partner to
demonstrate.
Soon the room is full of
swirling couples. Some drift
effortlessly in their black
Capezio dance shoes, their
posture erect. Others trip halt
ingly along, necks craned to
avoid hitting their neighbors.
One or two couples go hurtling
into the wall. But despite vary
ing skill levels, they're all in
this together. They're all
members of the Stanford Ball
room Dance Club.
Ballroom is big at Stanford.
This year's Ballroom Dance
Club president, Eric Swanson,
estimates club membership at
about 150. "In the last couple
of years the club has really ex
panded," said Swanson, a
graduate student in econom

ics.
When the club was founded
in 1987, it was a humble outfit.
A small band of graduate stu
dents met Rebello through
community-wide dances and
asked her to help them start a
club of their own. Rebello
agreed to teach a workshop in
April of that year. Soon after
wards, she was regularly
teaching ballroom classes.
"I enjoy teaching Stanford
people, because they're fun
and they learn very quickly,"
said Rebello. "I show a step
once and they'll get it. They're
young and exuberant and a
good match for my energy."
Early members practiced in
the Old Union clubhouse,
which at that point had a hard
wood floor. When the floor was
carpeted, the club moved to its
current home, Roble Gym,
which was better equipped to
handle the club's growing
numbers.
Now, every Sunday after
noon, Roble is packed with stu
dents in Rebello's beginning,
intermediate and advanced
classes. Club members also at
tend Friday night dances in
Palo Alto and Saturday after
noon technique classes. For
those who can't get enough, the

ics offers social dance classes

The explosive growth of ball
room at Stanford is reflected at
many other colleges and universi
ties. A search of the World Wide
Web reveals no less than 75 home
pages for collegiate ballroom
dance clubs. Harvard and Cornell
have clubs; so do University of
Saskatchewan and University of
Tokyo. MIT has the granddaddy
oft hem all: a 25-vear-old club fea
turing a separate, 20-member
professional competition ensem
ble.
Swanson and others agree that
ballroom's rise in popularity
among twentysomethings can bo
attributed to many causes. Popu
lar films have helped: The genera
tion weaned on "Footloose" has
graduated to "Swing Kids'' and
the fiery paso doble scene in
"Strictly Ballroom." The struc
ture (if ballroom dancing is also
appealing. Who wouldn't yearn
for the tnambo after years of the

inosh pit?
"Interest in ballroom dancing
is cyclical," said kebello. "When 1
was young, there were lots of kids
into ballroom dancing, but then it
got to be so that young people
wouldn't be caught dead doing
that old fuddy-duddy stuff."
I'hird-year medical student
Gary I'laner family followed
such a cycle.
"Almost all of my grandpar
ents danced when they wore my
age," said I'laner "My parents
didn't dance, and now I do I think
t here - a real resurgence going on,
because I see people of all ages
dancing."
Most Stanford students, how
ever, are attracted to ballroom
dancing's social possibilities as
much as to t lie dancing itself.
"This is a very social event at a
time when many people may be
working by themselves in front of
a terminal somewhere," wrote
John Beale in an e-mail message
sent from his particular terminal.
