# Finding real-life rhythm

note: This is
the fourth
installment
of an occa-

sional series. It is the true story of
seven freshmen picked to live in
an all-frosh dorm, Junipero, and
have their lives challenged. Find
out what happens when the small
talk ends and people start getting
real. The Real World, Stanford.
The transitional roller coaster
ride of fall quarter is finally over.
The Real World freshmen have
adjusted to the ups and downs of
life on the Farm. They've ac
quired new insights toward their
academic and social endeavors
that will carry them through an
other quarter.
"This quarter has been much
more sedate," George Holbert
commented, referring to his
dorm. "People have gotten past
the initial 'Let's get drunk!'
phase."
Now that the first-quarter
thrill of independence and free
dom has toned down a notch, the
Real World members view life in

a more relaxed sett ing.
"We have a different perspec
tive on a lot of things now,"
Grant Brown said. "When we
first got here we stressed a lot
more about getting reading done
and things like that. But now we
know we can get by without
doing most of it."
For most of the crew, the per
tinent lessons learned during fall

quarter lie within the academic
arena. Those tedious time man
agement seminars from the past
are now coming in handy.
"I know now that I have to do
things before they're due,"
George said. "I was a last-minute
paper writer and squandered my
time a lot. I ended up dropping
two classes last quarter. For CS
106X I even got one of those 'W

things."
In addition to his goal of be
coming more efficient, George
claimed that his new motto is
"Mr. Responsible Man." Finding
a balanced course load, along
with the infamous CIV and writ
ing requirements, is not an easy
task the first time around.

Even as he adjusts to his second quarter on the Farm, freshman Kevin Chen is having new and sur
prising experiences — like learning to paint nude models.
"One lesson I learned last quar
ter was not to take a class P / NC
until I know how I'm doing," Jean
De La Torre said. "I ended up
doing really well on a midterm and
a paper that I thought I had
bombed."
On the opposite end of the spec
trum, Chandra Christenson real
ized the importance of a challeng
ing curriculum.
"They told me to place myself
conservatively, so I took Math 41
which was very repetitive of my
high school calculus," Chandra
said. "I don't like the math pro
gram here because the tests have
nothing to do with the problems
we do in class."
Fortunately, the lessons
learned have not gone by without
notice. Winter quarter has provid
ed a fresh start for everyone. The
members of the Real World have
opened themselves to new gate
ways of learning.
"I walked into my painting
class the other night and there
was this old man sporting a white

robe," Kevin Chen said. "I
thought he was in the wrong class
at first. But then I found out that
we have nude models every Tues
day night. It was really hard to
concentrate. I tried to forget about
what I was painting."
New experiences coincide with
setting new goals for the quarter.
Most of these goals focus on more
personal matters.
"I've resolved to clean my
room," Joe Freund said, after
commenting on the odd sub
stances growing on his walls. "But
whether or not I carry through
with it is another matter."
Particular members of the
gang expressed vague sentiments
toward goals involving potential
relationships. George, who has
been interested in a dormmate
since fall quarter, explained his
current dilemma in the romance
department.
"I'm still in the idolatry stage
where I feel awkward around
her," George admitted. "We're not
as good of friends as I'd like to be,
but that's my fault. My goal is just
to get to know her better, I guess."
Some of these relationship ven
tures even include involvement in
others' affairs.

"I don't consider myself a
matchmaker, but there's a poten
tial couple in the dorm that I'd like
to get together," Kevin said smug
ly, unwilling to reveal any names.
"They're like a match made in
heaven. I can see them holding
hands in the woods and making
wishes on stars. My goal is to get
them together soon."
Most importantly, the crew has
found acceptance and friendship
within the community.
"When I was home, I found my
self competing with my friends to
see who had the most exciting sto
ries about their schools," Jean
said. "I really missed the vibrant
community of Stanford. I just
wanted to come back."
The students said they wanted
to come back to their "home away
from home."
"When I say 'home' I have to
stop and remind myself that I'm
referring to the dorm," Tasha
Dwamena said. "I realized it
when I went home for break. I
felt like a guest in my own
house. Even though I still have
good friends at home, my friends
here are the ones who under
stand what's going on in my life
now."
