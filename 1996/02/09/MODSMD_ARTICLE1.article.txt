# Finding real-life rhythm

note: This is
the fourth
installment
of an occa-

sional series. It is the true story of
seven freshmen picked to live in
an all-frosh dorm, Junipero, and
have their lives challenged. Find
out what happens when the small
talk ends and people start getting
real. The Real World, Stanford.
The transitional roller coaster
ride of fall quarter is finally over.
The Real World freshmen have
adjusted to the ups and downs of
life on the Farm. They've ac
quired new insights toward their
academic and social endeavors
that will carry them through an
other quarter.
"This quarter has been much
more sedate," George Holbert
commented, referring to his
dorm. "People have gotten past
the initial 'Let's get drunk!'
phase."
Now that the first-quarter
thrill of independence and free
dom has toned down a notch, the
Real World members view life in

a more relaxed sett ing.
"We have a different perspec
tive on a lot of things now,"
Grant Brown said. "When we
first got here we stressed a lot
more about getting reading done
and things like that. But now we
know we can get by without
doing most of it."
For most of the crew, the per
tinent lessons learned during fall

quarter lie within the academic
arena. Those tedious time man
agement seminars from the past
are now coming in handy.
"I know now that I have to do
things before they're due,"
George said. "I was a last-minute
paper writer and squandered my
time a lot. I ended up dropping
two classes last quarter. For CS
106X I even got one of those 'W

things."
In addition to his goal of be
coming more efficient, George
claimed that his new motto is
"Mr. Responsible Man." Finding
a balanced course load, along
with the infamous CIV and writ
ing requirements, is not an easy
task the first time around.

Even as he adjusts to his second quarter on the Farm, freshman Kevin Chen is having new and sur
prising experiences — like learning to paint nude models.
