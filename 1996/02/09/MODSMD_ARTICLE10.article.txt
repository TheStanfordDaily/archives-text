# Vehicle burglaries rising
## Police bolster efforts to control parking lot crime 
### Scott Van Winkle Editorial staff 
Responding to a rising number
of reported burglaries at campus
parking lots, Stanford Police have
stepped up surveillance and made
two sets of arrests in the last two
days.
Yesterday afternoon, Lt. Nick
Brunot and Detective Tom
Schreiner observed a man appar
ently breaking into a Volkswagen
parked near the Medical Center
along Quarry Road. They took him
into custody after a brief struggle.
The man, 26-year-old Jeffrey
Durgin of East Palo Alto, allegedly
used a screwdriver to pry open the
lock of the vehicle, according to

Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
On Wednesday, a group of five
people were apprehended for the
possession of hundreds of dollars of
stereo equipment. The group may
be connected to a rash of burglaries
in recent weeks, Niemeyer said.
The onslaught of burglary re
ports has been "relentless," he said.
Over the weekend, four or five inci
dents in which car windows were
smashed or stereos removed were
reported in a single day.
Niemeyer said Community Ser
vice Officer Rick Stone deserved
special credit for Wednesday's ar
rest, since he spotted one member
of the group in a parking lot near
Campus Drive on Stockfarm Lane.
After Stone reported seeing a

suspicious character, three adults
and two juveniles, all from Gilroy,
were taken into custody near the
golf course.
Later Wednesday, 30-year-old
Jesus Dominguez, 22-year-old Ju
ventino Algeria, and 20-year-old
Oscar Vargas were charged with
burglary and possession of stolen
property. The names of the other
two suspects could not be released
because they are under 18. The ju
veniles were taken to the San Jose
Juvenile Detention Center.
The fact that both incidents oc
curred during the day is typical of
many campus burglaries, Niemey
er said. A total of 24 daytime vehi
cle break-ins have been reported
so far this year, he said.
