# It's tea time: Campus eatery reopens
## 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
11 ungry students now have another late-night din
ing option in the form of a revived Stanford tradition:
the Teahouse, which opened its doors for the first
time this school year on Jan. 19.
The non-profit restaurant, located between Okada
House and the east dining commons at Wilbur Hall,
serves mostly Asian food catered from local restau
rants. Items generally cost less than $1.
The Teahouse has no paid employees, and it is run
by approximately 10 unpaid managers, said manager
Grace Wang. Four or five people from various Stan
ford groups operate the restaurant every night along
with a manager, receiving a cut of the night's profits
for their organizations.
"It's a lot of fun" for the group, said Wang. "They
know a lot of the people that come in here."
Groups and organizations working at the Tea
house this year include the Stanford University
Nikkei, Sanskriti, the Asian-American literary jour
nal "Reflections" and the Thai Student Association,
Wang said. Teahouse managers give preference to
Asian-American groups, but some nights are open for

other interested organizations, Wang said.
"I think it is a good opportunity for groups on cam
pus to earn some money," she said. "For students, it
is a good place to hang out."
General manager Mimi Wu said the groups earn
an average of $100 per night of work.
"It's not bad for two hours of work," she said, not
ing that the size of each group's nightly profit share
depends on how often members work.
The Teahouse, which has been open "off and on
for at least 10 years," Wang said, is also planning to
sponsor a number of special events this year, includ
ing movie nights and a Chinese New Year's party on
Feb. 19.
Business has been good so far, Wang said, men
tioning that the Teahouse presently fills between 80
and 100 orders a night. The Teahouse is presently
open Monday through Thursday from 10:30 p.m. to
12:30 a.m., but may expand its hours if there is
enough of a demand, she said.
The Teahouse did not open until this quarter due
to a number of organizational problems, Wang said.
However, she said they hope to open on time for fall
quarter next year.
"We're trying to be more organized," she said.
