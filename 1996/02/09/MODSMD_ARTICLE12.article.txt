## Flood swamps Portland, Ore. Residents struggle with area's worst flood in three decades 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A moun
tainside moaned, then gave way in a rush
of mud. Highways vanished beneath
stinking, caramel-colored floodwaters
swirling with uprooted trees and raw
sewage. One girl was dead, a woman was
missing, and thousands of Oregonians
were driven from their homes.
And the rain kept falling. As the state's
worst flooding in more than three decades
threatened to swamp downtown Portland,
sandbags and concrete highway dividers
formed a thin defense yesterday against
the wide Willamette River.
"Water's going everywhere," said
Trase Myers, as he and others hurried to
stack 40-pound sandbags against a build
ing downtown. "I can't believe the
destruction the water has caused."
In the nation's latest extreme weather
in a winter of extremes, hundreds of roads
— including both of Oregon's cross-state

freeways, Interstates 5 and 84 — were
closed by high water or mudslides. Amtrak
trains were halted. Gov. John Kitzhaber
declared 14 counties disaster areas.
Amid the deluge, there were water
shortages. Muddy floodwaters contami
nated drinking-water supplies throughout
the valley. Portland and Salem officials
urged people to conserve water. Smaller
towns shut down their water plants com
pletely mid told residents to buy bottled
water.
The flooding Ls the result of a series of
storms that marched in from the Pacific
beginning two weeks ago. The first were
cold, piling up snow in t he mountains that
form a scenic backdrop to Portland — the
Cascades to the east, the rolling Coast
Range to the west.
On Monday, a warmer storm stalled
over the state, and the snow started melt
ing, adding to the record rains — more

than 5 inches a day in some areas.
Sparkling mountain streams, narrow
enough to jump across two weeks ago,
turned monstrous, tearing through the
forest, ripping small bridges apart.
As the swollen streams converged in
the Willamette River valley, evergreen
trees were ripped out by their roots, bob
bing and lunging downstream like huge
battering rams.
An estimated 1,500 people were forced
from their homes in Eugene, and 12,000
in the Salem area, where a parade of U-
Hauls, horse trailers and pickup trucks
streamed through the rain.
Bill and Connie Mellin grabbed a few
valuables from their home in Keizer, near
Salem, and headed for higher ground.
"We've stacked our furniture up on
books t hat we don't like," Bill Mellin said.
"We're going to grab some photos, kids'
toys and clothes and get out of here."
