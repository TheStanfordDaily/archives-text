# Forbes ponders Social Security plan

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Steve
Forbes wants to push quickly to priva
tize the giant Social Security fund for
younger people, going far beyond more
modest overhauls discussed by his
rivals for the Republican presidential
nomination and Democrats.
Forbes doesn't discuss the plan in
his multitude of TV ads, and he is just
beginning to raise the politically volatile
issue on the campaign trail. But aides
say reworking the old-age pension sys
tem woidd be a high priority should
Forbes be elected president.
His plan would put part of young
people's Social Security payroll deduc
tions into private savings instead of a
government trust fund, and that has
some senior citizen groups worried.
"To privatize the system changes its
whole nature," said Dan Schulder of
the National Council of Senior Citizens.
Nonet heless, the idea has caught the
eye of those who believe they could do a
better job than the government of
investing their money for old age.

This week, the issue surfaced on the
campaign trail in lowa. Senate Majority
Leader Boh Dole began airing a televi
sion ad warning: "Steve Forbes plans to
end Social Security as we know it."
Dole ran the ad in response to a
Forbes' spot accusing the Kansas senator
of failing to protect Social Security. Dole
has a long record of working to keep the
system solvent through limited changes
such as scaling back cost of living adjust
ments and taxing certain benefits.
Other OOP candidates have mostly
steered clear of Social Security this
year, unless pressed.
"They'll throw out some possibilities,
but they don't want to get caught in any
specifics," said Boh Hannon of the Con
cord Coalition, a private group that
advocates scaling back Social Security
benefits for high-income Americans.
Forbes argues that a sweeping over
haul is needed because Social Security
faces insolvency in the year 2030.
He would maintain the current sys
tem for Americans now drawing Social

Security benefits, plus those retiring in
the next decade or so. "Real-life deci
sions have been made based on those
promises," he says.
But Forbes would phase in private
savings for Americans who are around
age 50 and younger.
"We all know . . . that the current
system will be broke or bleeding by the
time these younger people retire,"
Forbes told the American Association of
Retired Persons.
Forbes has yet to flesh out details of
his plan, beyond saying a portion of
payroll taxes, the amount yet to be
determined, would go directly into pri
vate savings or investment accounts
along the lines of an individual retire
ment account or 101 (k) plan through
work.
When Forbes was campaigning last
week in Manchester, N.H., libertarian
Daryl Johnson thanked him for looking
out for her 2-year-old's future and try
ing to "reconcile two generations with
two different needs."
