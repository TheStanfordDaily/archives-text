Bosnian Serbs sever contacts
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — In the strongest
blow yet to the peace process, the Bosnian Serh army severed
contacts with the NATO-led force yesterday and blocked civil
ians from moving freely to show its fury over the arrest of two
senior officers on suspicion of war crimes.
Gen. Djordje Djukic and Col. Aleksa Krsmanovic were
arrested Jan. 30 when they made a wrong turn around
Sarajevo and entered government-controlled territory. Fur
ther angering the Serbs, the arrests were endorsed by the
international war crimes court, which asked that the two
men be held until it decided whether they should be indict
ed.
Serb commander Gen. Ratko Mladic, who has been
indicted for war crimes, yesterday banned civilians in Serb
territory from crossing into other parts of Bosnia. The
Serbs already had suspended all contact with the Muslim
led government to protest the arrests.
Calls to increase
NEW YORK (AP) — Getting through dinner without a
call from a phone or cable company that wants your busi
ness could get tougher now that the telecommunications
overhaul is law.
There are plenty more calls ahead, along with mail offers
and broadcast and print ads, as local phone, long-distance
and cable companies — freed of all sorts of regulatory barri
ers — try to muscle into one another's business.
Even though you won't be able to take phone calls on

your TV set for years, the advertising blitz has begun.
"It is a nuisance at times," said David Rua, an insurance
agent in Pittsburg, Kan., who gets calls from long-distance
companies who want his business. "But that's free Ameri
can enterprise. If you try to cut that down, that's saying
they can't compete."
Troubled waters?
WASHINGTON (AP) — White House aides dealing with
Whitewater were speculating. Did they dare approach a
state bank regulator to "make sure her story is OK"? It was
touchy business, one said — if it's mishandled "we're done."
Yesterday, two years later, the discussion came out at a
Senate Whitewater Committee hearing.
Months after the committee had asked for them, the
White House turned over handwritten jottings taken by
Mark Gearan, who was President Clinton's communica
tions director at the time the meeting was held, on Jan. 7,
1994. A month earlier, a Justice Department prosecutor
had been appointed to take over the criminal investigation
of Whitewater.
White House lawyer Jane Sherburne told the committee
yesterday that the notes had been hard to locate because
Gearan inadvertently took them with him when he leR the
White House to run the Peace Corps last September.
One area under discussion in the meeting of presidential
aides: First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's contact with
Arkansas securities commissioner Beverly Bassett Schaffer
about whether the savings and loan at the center of White
water could issue stock.
