Single president a good
idea, but proposed plan
doesn't change enough

Recently, the assu has
been abuzz with talk of
reform. While most of the
recent debate has concerned cam
paign finance reform, a more signif
icant change looms on the horizon.
This week, Council of Presidents
member Jon Oram released a pro
posal which would vest presidential
power not in the current council but
instead in a single president and
three vice presidents. Oram is to be
congratulated for bringing this
issue to the forefront — it is cer
tainly time to re-examine the effec
tiveness of the COP structure.
However, while the bill — which
has not been officially submitted to
the senate — does a good job of get
ting the ball rolling, it fails to make
all the changes necessary to realize
the benefits of a single president.
The four representatives in
Oram's plan would still be called a
"Council of Presidents" and would
still function in essentially the same
way that the current COP does.
Under the proposed "restructur
ing," the president could decide to
grant the vice presidents equal deci
sion-making authority, essentially
reviving the old-style COP
Proponents of the plan could
argue that although four represen
tatives would still be elected to the
council, their roles under the new
plan would be different because
there will be a recognized leader and
separate responsibilities for each
vice president. But this is already
the case. According to the ASSU
Bylaws, the COP is required to
name a "chair" and all four mem
bers do in fact have explicit duties.
Unfortunately, the current struc
ture isn't working. A true solution
requires more than just the seman
tic change of renaming positions.
A new svstem should be created

consisting of a president and a sin
gle vice-president. The most sub
stantial benefit of such a system
would be increased accountability.
Both students and administrators
would be able to hold a single officer
accountable for the political actions
of the ASSU. Furthermore, a single
voice would carry more weight and
demonstrate more coherent behav
ior in dealing with the senate and
with students and administrators.
Re-creating a "council"and spread
ing out responsibilities will do little
to achieve this goal.
It might seem that one president
could not handle the workload; thus
four positions are needed. However,
the duties Oram would assign to the
three vice presidents consist pri
marily of "overseeing" various
ASSU responsibilities and opera
tions; most of the "doing" is done by
others. There is no reason why the
president / vice-president pair
would be unable to handle the task
of supervising the others working
for the ASSU.
Should the senate pass Oram's
proposed bill, the measure — as an
amendment to the ASSU Constitu
tion — would then be placed on the
spring ballot for student approval.
On that same ballot the student
body would elect a COP slate which,
according to Oram's plan, would be
require to promptly reorganize
itself should the amendment be rat
ified. Thus, the students will not
know the role slate members will be
assuming until after their votes
have been cast.
This ambiguity places the voters
at a disadvantage — knowing who
will be the real "president" could
influence their votes. Rather than
rush into reform, the ASSU should
not make a new plan effective until
the spring 1997 voting, allowing stu
dents to know exactly what kind of
presidential arrangement they are
voting for in the upcoming election.
Nevertheless, the senate and COP
should use this restructuring oppor
tunity to take a fundamental look at
the current delineation of presiden
tial duties — be they assigned to a
single person or a council of four.
