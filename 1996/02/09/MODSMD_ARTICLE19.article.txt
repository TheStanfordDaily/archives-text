## Marc Wais Reflections from the dean of students 
### 
This week i close
out my 20th week
as Stanford's dean
of students. At times I
feel as though I'm a
frosh, trying to get to
know people on campus
and to become familiar
with my surroundings as
fast as possible. When

The Daily asked me to write an op-ed
piece, I wasn't entirely sure what I was
going to write about. However, it seems to
me that this is a good time to reflect on my
first 20 weeks on the Farm.
Like many frosh, coming to Stanford
was a major decision in my life. I moved to
Stanford from Baltimore during the week
of New Student Orientation and got swept
away with all the hoopla and activities
associated with a new school year. Now
that the dust has settled somewhat, here's
a new dean's initial impressions of Stan
ford:
1. As dean of students, I have the privi
lege of working closely with students on a
day-to-day basis. This is easily the best
part of my job. Stanford students are
extremely bright, creative, talented, artic
ulate, energetic, civic-minded and socially
conscious. These student traits are easy to
identify and document — just look at test
scores, attend a performing arts presenta
tion or check out Haas Center activities.
2. While listening to students describ
ing their overall Stanford experience, I am

always impressed by how happy students
appear to be with their decision to attend
Stanford, knowing many of them had the
opportunity to attend Harvard, Yale,
Princeton and the like. Students consis
tently rave about the quality of the facul
ty, fellow students, facilities and Stan
ford's overall resources. By no means do I
mean to suggest that Stanford students
believe that everything about Stanford is
perfect. In fact, I often get to hear about
the things students feel are far from per
fect, many of which are described here in
The Daily. However, the overwhelming
majority of students believe that they are
receiving a world-class education in a chal
lenging, nurturing and supportive envi
ronment.
3. Students take seriously their respon
sibility to advocate for change. Most of
these efforts are organized, well-inten
tioned and demand much time, effort and
dedication on the part of student partici
pants. Although students at times may
express frustration that their voices are
not being heard or are somewhat dis
counted, I can assure you — on the basis
of conversations with other administra
tors and staff — that the voice of the stu
dent is heard and is respected. Sometimes
students expect instant results when the
academy often demands a time-consuming
process of deliberation and consultation.
This process often evolves into a dialogue;
1 believe that, as administrators, our
words to students in this dialogue must

possess credibility, sincerity and sensitivi
ty. Moreover, we must ensure that we
back our words up with action, knowing
that students will rightly hold us account
able for what we say and do.
4. I have been struck by how many stu
dents perceive their relationship with
administrators as a struggle of "us vs.
them." I find this perception hard to
understand and accept. In every conversa
tion I have had with administrators, I
have been impressed with the concern and
passion they express for students and the
University. It is clear to me that we must
do a better job of conveying and demon
strating this commitment and sensitivity
towards students. We realize that without
students there is no Stanford.
5. There never seems to be enough time
to take advantage of all Stanford has to
offer.
6. Every work assignment I am
engaged in seems to be marked "urgent"
and can always be described as complex.
Nothing is ever simple at Stanford.
All in all, as for many frosh, my first 20
weeks have been filled with fun, excite
ment, accomplishments and challenges —
all of which keep me feeling young, ener
gized and hopeful.

Marc Wais is the dean of students. He
would like to inform his readers that he
was forced to write this piece on short
notice and would have, if the time was
available, refined it further.
