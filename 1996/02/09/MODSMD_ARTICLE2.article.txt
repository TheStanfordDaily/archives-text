# CSRE worries students
## BSU leaders say they're being left out of dialogue 
### Amy Slucter Staff writer 
As Stanford's new ethnic studies pro
gram comes closer to reality, members of
the Black Student Union are worried they
are being left out of important dialogue on
the issue.
At a meeting earlier this week, students
discussed their concerns about the Com
parative Studies in Race and Ethnicity
program and how it relates to the existing
program in African and Afro-American
Studies.
"I think one of our main concerns is that
black students aren't aware of what is going
on," said sophomore Marcus Howard. "We
need to know how this will affect the exist
ing program and any future programs."
The interdisciplinary program, proposed
last February by Dean of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven, will offer major and
minor concentrations in Chicano, Asian-
American and African and Afro-American
Studies or a cross-cultural theme.
In his proposal Shoven praised the
African and Afro-American Studies pro
gram for its distinguished 25-year history
and reaffirmed the University's commit
ment to improve the program by hiring fac
ulty whose interests will support such

scholarship.
Students in the Black Student Union,
however, doubt that the interdisciplinary
program will be able to achieve those goals.
According to Courtney Myers, the
union's co-chair, the CSRE program would
devalue the importance of African and Afro-
American Studies as an individual disci
pline by throwing it under one umbrella of
ethnic studies.
In a written statement, Myers made it
clear the Black Student Union would like to
see separate and autonomous departments
for each ethnic community.
Howard said the interdisciplinary pro
gram would increase discrimination.
"It is hard enough for me to prove myself
as a black person," Howard said. "When you
put ethnic studies under a collective um
brella you categorize people even more ef
fectively as the 'minorities.' "
At the meeting, students discussed
whether Stanford is making a political
statement by placing ethnic studies under a
common umbrella.
"It is a political statement similar to that
made by the UC Regents when they took
away affirmative action," sophomore
Jacqueline Statum said. "It is like saying
