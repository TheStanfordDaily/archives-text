AASA leader supports CSAAS actions on CSRE

THE DAILY'S EDITORIAL on
Wednesday criticizing the Con
cerned Students for Asian Amer
ican Studies' failure to go through
proper channels is unfounded and
ignores all of CSAAS's relentless work
the past three years toward developing
a strong ethnic studies program at
Stanford. Even more misguided and
distasteful is The Daily's belief that
student protests and actions are impul
sive and illogical.
CSAAS continues the long struggle
for an Asian-American Studies pro
gram. While The Daily's editorial only
remembers actions like the MEChA
hunger strike and the recent demands
for more student and faculty represen
tation towards the faculty hiring for
CSRE, CSAAS has followed accepted
channels. Members of CSAAS served

on the two committees organized by
Dean of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven to investigate ethnic studies.
The first committee, which began its
work in spring 1994, studied the imple
mentation of Asian-American Studies
at Stanford and included recommenda
tions for the structure of the CSRE
itself. The second committee, convened
in spring 1995, developed the Asian-
American Studies curriculum. Con
trary to the claims of The Daily, a
member of CSAAS did apply for the
CSRE advisory committee through the
Nominations Commission. The Nomi
nations Commission's initial appoint
ments overlooked CSAAS, even though
CSAAS had been a part of the develop
ment of CSRE and Asian-American
Studies through committees.
A little research on the part of The

Daily would have showed that the
recent demands were developed
through a long-standing concern for
the hiring of Asian-American faculty.
In meetings with Shoven and Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
Ramon Saldivar, students expressed
their concern that the voices of stu
dents and Asian-American Studies fac
ulty were not considered in the hiring
of faculty for CSRE.
The Daily believes that "it is not
appropriate for any group of students
to have veto power over the choice of
faculty." But CSAAS has never men
tioned or requested veto power over the
choice of faculty. More accurately,
CSAAS and AASA believe that Asian-
American studies faculty should not be
hired without the support of faculty
and students involved with Asian-

American Studies. CSAAS's demand
for written clarification of the proce
dure sought to ensure procedural mea
sures to back up Shoven's assurances
to CSAAS and AASA that, "We won't
hire anyone that students and faculty
don't want."
The outrage of both faculty and stu
dents over the Grace Kao offer espe
cially frustrated us, as we had
expressed our concern for the hiring
process in numerous memos and meet
ings with Shoven. Discussions with fac
ulty concerning the future hiring of
Asian-American Studies faculty often
ended with the words: "It ultimately
depends upon students for change."
