# Daily editorial on ASSU Senate was factually inaccurate
## 
### 
Due to the presence of factual errors
in The Daily's Tuesday editorial, we feel
compelled to clarify our involvement
with the Election Bylaw reform bill con
sidered by the Senate last week.
Upon assuming office, we were faced
with a distinct conflict between prac
ticed election procedure and Bylaw lan
guage. Because there was a definite
need to reconcile the two, we obtained a
draft version of Election Bylaw revi
sions presented to the Senate last year
by former Senate Chair Nawwar Kas-

rawi. We then proceeded, with the help
of Kasrawi and Senate Chair Alane
Murdock, to revise the bill and prepare
it for consideration by this year's Sen
ate.
Contrary to insinuations in The
Daily's editorial, we were aware that the
revamped bill to which we attached our
names did include the original draft's
campaign expense limit adjustments.
While preparing the final version of our
bill, we failed to consider the institu
tional implications presented by the
inclusion of an expense limit section in
Elections Commission legislation.
We later resolved that the campaign
expense provision should not and could
not remain a portion of our procedural
reform bill and, therefore, struck the
politically substantive section during

the bill's introduction at the Senate
meeting. As an apolitical, non-partisan
entity, the Elections Commission is
charged with organizing and regulating
student elections in a fair and impartial
manner. This is achieved by adhering to
the procedures and interpreting the
policies enumerated in the ASSU's gov
erning documents. Although we believe
it entirely appropriate to advocate pro
cedural modifications, amendments to
the policies that we interpret must
remain solely within the purview of the
elected, policy-making bodies of the
ASSU.
Additionally, The Daily's editorial
explicitly states that Murdock refused
to recognize our right, as authors, to
introduce the bill in the form we
desired. This is patently untrue.

Although she later argued in favor of re
inserting the passage we struck, Mur
dock did not use parliamentary means
to keep the campaign expense provision
in the bill.
Once again, we both knew that the
campaign expense limit section was in
the bill we presented, we struck the sec
tion solely for the preservation of the
Elections Commission's distinct role in
the ASSU and Murdock did not inter
fere with our efforts to have the section
stricken. Any assertions contrary to
these three facts, including those pre
sented in The Daily's editorial, cannot
be justified.
