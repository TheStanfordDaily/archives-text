# Allison Amend: The better part of valor
## A 						downhill battle against Stanford's red tape 
### 
WELL, HERE I am in my new
digs. I feel as though I should
stretch my arms out as wid»* as
possible, feel the inky black borders of the
roof and the floor, plant my feet firmly in
the corners, claim this space as mine, if
only for Fridays, and gaze down at what
I've written from my inch-square picture.
But I can't. Something's bothering
me, and that something is bureaucracy.
You thought Russia under the Commu
nists was bad, you thought lines were
long in Spain, well you ain't seen noth
ing until you butt up against this Uni
versity.
They weave a tangled web of decep
tion, these bureaucrats who seem to have
nothing better to do than to make poor
over-involved little students scramble
around like so many bees in a hive for
that elusive honey.
Just for kicks, I looked up "bureaucra
cy" in the Oxford English Dictionary. It's
from the French "bureaucratie" (mais,
oui!) and one of its first uses is from John
Stuart Mill in 1837: "That vast net-work
of administrative tyranny . . . that sys

tem of bureaucracy, which leaves no free
agent in all France, except the man at
Paris who pulls the wires." All the
world's a stage, and we are but puppets
on it.
Let me give you an example, paint a
picture of me for you, on a journey to get
credit for a course, which was entered
correctly into Axess by me, my depart
ment administrator and my adviser, yet I
somehow managed not to receive credit
for it. Since I am the overachiever we all
know me to be, I need these four units to
graduate this quarter with the whopping
unit total of 181 — count 'em 181 — for
my undergraduate career. We start our
tale at the Registrar's window; the char
acters are me (Allison) and nameless low
level bureaucrat.
Allison: Hi. (1 explain my problem).
Bureaucrat: Well, you need to see
[insert random androgynous name, e.g.
Chris, Pat or Jo here] but she's only in on
Tuesdays when Mars and Venus are con
verging or on Saturdays in July.
So I go to see (random androgynous
name] after carefully consulting my

handy pocket astrological guide and wait
ing the appropriate three weeks for the
Convergence.
Allison: Hi. (I explain my problem).
Bureaucrat: Well, that sounds like a
problem with launch, not design. You
need to see [insert different random
androgynous name here]. But he's only
here when gray sky causes bear to fly in
straight circle.
At this point, the random bureaucrat
winks at me knowingly, as if I'm supposed
to understand this cryptic discourse.
Just for the record, the higher up on
the bureaucratic ladder I seem to climb in
my quest for the elusive four units
(which I need to graduate in March, did I
mention that?), the lower down (on the
physical level that is) the offices are. Hav
ing consulted my secret decoder ring (it's
a good thing I carry around a behemoth
backpack), I figure out that my next clue
leads me to the lower levels of the base
ment. Now I am taking the elevator to
floors that don't even light up when I
press the button.
At this point, I run into a friend,

trapped also in this bureaucratic bad
dream. Is he on the same trip I am? A dia
logue ensues: the plot thickens.
My Friend: Well, I'm trying to get paid for
this class I'm TA-ing, but first I had to prove
I spoke English. [Author's note: he's lived in
the U.S. for 18 years]. Then the Woman-
Who-Disburses-Checks is not in today; she's
sick with brain atrophy or something, but I
can see my check on her ilesk.
Allison: I wish you luck on your quest, my
friend, but I must be detained no longer.
So at least I'm not the only one. After a
series of events too long to relate here, I
come to a turning point in my quest. Will
my hubris become my fatal flaw? Will I ever
find my four units and save the princess?
What is the solution??? Is there one?
Greek Chorus: PETITION!!!
Ah, but of course, why didn't I think of
that? Please, random bureaucrat, give me
forms, give me petitions or give me death!
Let me fill out my name in triplicate, let
me explain, in writing, why I need those
four units to graduate (did I tell you about
this?), why I need to graduate, why I'm at
this university, the reason for my exis

tence, man's place in our planet's food
chain.. . . There is only one problem: sig
natures. After getting my thesis advisor,
my departmental advisor, my RF (no
small task in a Row house), the depart
ment administrator, my department's
director of undergraduate studies, a lock
of my deceased grandfather's hair, the
golden fleece, the Holy Grail and a large
stuffed-crust pizza, I need my freshman
roommate's current boyfriend's dog's for
mer owner's barber's signature. A snag:
my freshman roommate dates women.
So it's back to the drawing board.
Let's see, I can petition to add a course
now, or petition to be exempt from the
180 unit minimum. Petition to take
courses next quarter at a reduced rate.
Or maybe I can just petition to eliminate
bureaucracy.
Can anybody lend me four units to
graduate?

Allison Amend's column will appear here
on Fridays.

leads me to the lower levels of the base
ment. Now I am taking the elevator to
floors that don't even light up when I
press the button.
At this point, I run into a friend,

trapped also in this bureaucratic bad
dream. Is he on the same trip I am? A dia
logue ensues: the plot thickens.
My Friend: Well, I'm trying to get paid for
this class I'm TA-ing, but first I had to prove
I spoke English. [Author's note: he's lived in
the U.S. for 18 years]. Then the Woman-
Who-Disburses-Checks is not in today; she's
sick with brain atrophy or something, but I
can see my check on her ilesk.
Allison: I wish you luck on your quest, my
friend, but I must be detained no longer.
So at least I'm not the only one. After a
series of events too long to relate here, I
come to a turning point in my quest. Will
my hubris become my fatal flaw? Will I ever
find my four units and save the princess?
What is the solution??? Is there one?
Greek Chorus: PETITION!!!
Ah, but of course, why didn't I think of
that? Please, random bureaucrat, give me
forms, give me petitions or give me death!
Let me fill out my name in triplicate, let
me explain, in writing, why I need those
four units to graduate (did I tell you about
this?), why I need to graduate, why I'm at
this university, the reason for my exis

tence, man's place in our planet's food
chain.. . . There is only one problem: sig
natures. After getting my thesis advisor,
my departmental advisor, my RF (no
small task in a Row house), the depart
ment administrator, my department's
director of undergraduate studies, a lock
of my deceased grandfather's hair, the
golden fleece, the Holy Grail and a large
stuffed-crust pizza, I need my freshman
roommate's current boyfriend's dog's for
mer owner's barber's signature. A snag:
my freshman roommate dates women.
So it's back to the drawing board.
Let's see, I can petition to add a course
now, or petition to be exempt from the
180 unit minimum. Petition to take
courses next quarter at a reduced rate.
Or maybe I can just petition to eliminate
bureaucracy.
Can anybody lend me four units to
graduate?
