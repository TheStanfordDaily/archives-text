# Group plans voter registration drive

### LaNitra Walker 
A group of Chicano / Latino students at the
Law School is planning a drive in local commu
nities to register voters for the upcoming pres
idential elections.
The Stanford Latino Law Students Associa
tion (SALSA) will work with several other
groups on and off campus in order to reach out
to Redwood City, East Palo Alto and other
nearby cities.
SALSA Chair Michael Hestrin, a second
year law student, said he believes it is impor
tant to make people in these areas more active
citizens. Voter turnout among Chicano / Lati
nos is below average, especially in East Palo
Alto and Redwood City, he said.
Last year, Latinos for Better Government

— an off-campus, non-profit organization
working with SALSA — registered more than
18,000 Chicano / Latinos. Hestrin said the or
ganization hopes to double that number this
year, aided by the SALSA effort.
SALSA members haven't "worked out all
the details yet," said Law Prof. Miguel Mendez,
but they plan to register voters by going out
into the community as well as recruiting over
the telephone.
Mendez said the project "is a wonderful
thing for Stanford students to do — to go out
into the community."
Other groups that plan to contribute to the
voter registration effort include the under
graduate Chicano / Latino pre-law society
Derechos, El Centro Chicano and a Southwest
voter registration group.

The voter registration is SALSA's annual
project. Each year, the group designs one large
project that, Mendez said, helps students "par
ticipate in the Latino community." Last year,
law students tutored at Franklin Middle School.
SALSA works year round with Latino law
school students, first-year students in particu
lar, to get them involved in the law community
as soon as possible.
The organization is designed to help law stu
dents network with graduates and lawyers in
the area. It offers a variety of social events and
guest speakers, as well as helping students
study and prepare for exams.
"The transition to law school is sometimes
hard," Hestrin explained. SALSA is place
where students "come together to meet other
students," he said.
