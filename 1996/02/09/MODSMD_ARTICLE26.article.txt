# For the record

### 
A caption on page two of yester
day's Daily incorrectly identified
two images of a Buddha sculpture.
The middle image was a scan of
the original sculpture while the
image on the right was a prelimi
nary 3-D reconstruction. Addi
tional images can be found on the
World Wide Web at http://www
graphics.stanford.edu/projects/fa
xing/happy.
A caption on the front page of
yesterday's Daily incorrectly
identified the dancer on the left.
The dancer should have been
identified as Bruce Romney, a
doctoral student in electrical en
gineering.
A story on page two of yester
day's Daily incorrectly quoted An
drew Blachman. The person who
should have been quoted was An
drew Blackburn, a sophomore.
