## No. 25 Cardinal avenges loss, dunks Trojans 99-69 Seaton, Poppink hold their own against depleted USC frontcourt 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Entering last night's contest
against the 25th-ranked Stanford
men's basketball team, the USC
frontline was reeling from the
loss of starting center Avondre
Jones. Jones, a problem player in
the past, had decided not to fly up
with the team on Wednesday.
Even as recently as yesterday, the
6-foot-ll junior averaging 10.7
points and 6 rebounds per game
refused the opportunity to head
north to join his teammates. For
the USC frontline, it was all
downhill from there.
In the Cardinal's 99-69 pound
ing of the Trojans last night in
Maples Pavilion, Stanford guard
Dion Cross' 19 points riddled the
USC defense with holes, but it was
the Cardinal frontline that blew
the Trojans to kingdom come.
That scenario was somewhat
unlikely entering yesterday's
game. The Trojans' 84-80 victory
earlier this season against Stan
ford was due in large part to the
inside play of USC backup center
David Crouse, who scored 15
points and grabbed seven
rebounds in the Jan. 14 contest.
To make things worse, 6-foot-8
Cardinal freshman Peter Sauer
missed last night's game because
of the flu, and Stanford's main
inside man, senior forward Dar
ren Allaway, was whistled for
three quick fouls with 14:15 still
left to play in the first half.
"We had some concerns going
in," said Cardinal head coach Mike
Montgomery. "No. 1 was our big
people. They hurt us at the post
last time with Crouse, so we were
concerned at the post. And with

Sauer having the (lu and not being
available to us, we really only had
three big guys. The last thing we
really needed was for anybody to
get into fold trouble. And then All
away gets three in the first half
fairly quickly. It was a concern."
Enter 6-foot-9 Cardinal fresh
man Mark Seaton, who played the
best game of his short-but-excit
ing collegiate career. With Stan
ford clinging to a 24-20 lead with
8:23 to go in the first half, Seaton,
amidst a sea of Trojan defenders,
flushed the ball through the hoop
and drew the foul. Minutes later,
Seaton had two more buckets off
lay-ups, establishing the Cardi
nal's presence inside. Then with
just over three minutes left in the
opening half, the Stanford for
ward — wide open under the bas
ket after finding the soft spot in
the Trojan's ineffective press -
caught a length-of-the-court pass
for a thunderous jam.
It wasn't all just fun anil dunks
for Seaton, however. Besides his
10 first-half points, he also pulled
down three rebounds and played
tight defense, drawing a charge
from Crouse and allowing the
USC post tandem of ('rouse and
Maurice Strong a total of just four
points off a combined one-for
seven shooting from the floor.
"I just always have to be
ready," Seaton said. "When Dar
ren got his third, I knew that I
was going to go in. I just went in
there and tried to do my best.
They were playing a freshman,
Maurice Strong. Hi* wasn't very
good offensively. He didn't take
many shots. 1 just tried to my
best, run the floor and do the
things I'm supposed to do."

Freshman Mark Seaton brings down the house with a thunderous dunk.
Rim-rattling jams are becoming something of a Seaton trademark.
It only got better in the second
half. With Stanford already com
fortably ahead 62-44 and just over
13 minutes left to play, Seaton
spelled Allaway, who had picked
up his fourth foul minutes earlier.
Having already jumped and
dunked the home crowd into a
frenzy, Seaton decide to do a little
passing, dishing a couple of spec
tacular sleight-of-hand assists to
teammate Andy Poppink under
the basket for easy lay-ins. But
Seaton and his legs still got a
healthy workout in the second
half with two rim-rattling slams.
He finished with 18 points on the
game, connecting for seven-of
nine from the floor and racking
up seven rebounds, two blocks
and two assists.
"Fortunately, Mark Seaton did
a good job," Montgomery said.
"He's really gotten better. He had
a tough time down at USC. He
basically physically got over
whelmed.
"He really does have good legs.
USC really does commit to the
ball. They jump on the ball. We
got to throw the ball behind [the
Trojan defensej a lot, and Mark
obviously can dunk. He does get
above people and can shot block.
He has improved. He's getting
better and rebounds the ball pret
ty well. He's getting smarter on
defense. I'm real pleased with his
progress."
Seaton didn't have to do all the
work inside, although he probably
could have. Poppink finished with
a game-high 20 points and nine
rebounds. To say the Cardinal
dominated the inside would be an
understatement. Stanford called
the paint home and pitched its
tents down low all night. The Car
dinal shot 60.7 percent from the
field, primarily because lay-ups
and dunks are high-percentage
shots. Stanford also took control
of the glass, outrebounding the

Trojans 46-32.
All in all, Montgomery's con
cerns for his frontcourt proved
unfounded, but new Trojan inter
im head coach Henry Bibby cer
tainly had some concerns after
the game.
"We were definitely in a cor

ner," Bibby said. "We had only
three big guys. David Crouse has
been a backup player. Maurice
Strong is a freshman. Those two
guys were in there playing against
some very, very good, talented
players tonight, and we got out
played in there."

game. The Trojans' 84-80 victory
earlier this season against Stan
ford was due in large part to the
inside play of USC backup center
David Crouse, who scored 15
points and grabbed seven
rebounds in the Jan. 14 contest.
To make things worse, 6-foot-8
Cardinal freshman Peter Sauer
missed last night's game because
of the flu, and Stanford's main
inside man, senior forward Dar
ren Allaway, was whistled for
three quick fouls with 14:15 still
left to play in the first half.
"We had some concerns going
in," said Cardinal head coach Mike
Montgomery. "No. 1 was our big
people. They hurt us at the post
last time with Crouse, so we were
concerned at the post. And with

Sauer having the (lu and not being
available to us, we really only had
three big guys. The last thing we
really needed was for anybody to
get into fold trouble. And then All
away gets three in the first half
fairly quickly. It was a concern."
Enter 6-foot-9 Cardinal fresh
man Mark Seaton, who played the
best game of his short-but-excit
ing collegiate career. With Stan
ford clinging to a 24-20 lead with
8:23 to go in the first half, Seaton,
amidst a sea of Trojan defenders,
flushed the ball through the hoop
and drew the foul. Minutes later,
Seaton had two more buckets off
lay-ups, establishing the Cardi
nal's presence inside. Then with
just over three minutes left in the
opening half, the Stanford for
ward — wide open under the bas
ket after finding the soft spot in
the Trojan's ineffective press -
caught a length-of-the-court pass
for a thunderous jam.
It wasn't all just fun anil dunks
for Seaton, however. Besides his
10 first-half points, he also pulled
down three rebounds and played
tight defense, drawing a charge
from Crouse and allowing the
USC post tandem of ('rouse and
Maurice Strong a total of just four
points off a combined one-for
seven shooting from the floor.
"I just always have to be
ready," Seaton said. "When Dar
ren got his third, I knew that I
was going to go in. I just went in
there and tried to do my best.
They were playing a freshman,
Maurice Strong. Hi* wasn't very
good offensively. He didn't take
many shots. 1 just tried to my
best, run the floor and do the
things I'm supposed to do."

Freshman Mark Seaton brings down the house with a thunderous dunk.
Rim-rattling jams are becoming something of a Seaton trademark.
It only got better in the second
half. With Stanford already com
fortably ahead 62-44 and just over
13 minutes left to play, Seaton
spelled Allaway, who had picked
up his fourth foul minutes earlier.
Having already jumped and
dunked the home crowd into a
frenzy, Seaton decide to do a little
passing, dishing a couple of spec
tacular sleight-of-hand assists to
teammate Andy Poppink under
the basket for easy lay-ins. But
Seaton and his legs still got a
healthy workout in the second
half with two rim-rattling slams.
He finished with 18 points on the
game, connecting for seven-of
nine from the floor and racking
up seven rebounds, two blocks
and two assists.
"Fortunately, Mark Seaton did
a good job," Montgomery said.
"He's really gotten better. He had
a tough time down at USC. He
basically physically got over
whelmed.
"He really does have good legs.
USC really does commit to the
ball. They jump on the ball. We
got to throw the ball behind [the
Trojan defensej a lot, and Mark
obviously can dunk. He does get
above people and can shot block.
He has improved. He's getting
better and rebounds the ball pret
ty well. He's getting smarter on
defense. I'm real pleased with his
progress."
Seaton didn't have to do all the
work inside, although he probably
could have. Poppink finished with
a game-high 20 points and nine
rebounds. To say the Cardinal
dominated the inside would be an
understatement. Stanford called
the paint home and pitched its
tents down low all night. The Car
dinal shot 60.7 percent from the
field, primarily because lay-ups
and dunks are high-percentage
shots. Stanford also took control
of the glass, outrebounding the

Trojans 46-32.
All in all, Montgomery's con
cerns for his frontcourt proved
unfounded, but new Trojan inter
im head coach Henry Bibby cer
tainly had some concerns after
the game.
"We were definitely in a cor

ner," Bibby said. "We had only
three big guys. David Crouse has
been a backup player. Maurice
Strong is a freshman. Those two
guys were in there playing against
some very, very good, talented
players tonight, and we got out
played in there."
