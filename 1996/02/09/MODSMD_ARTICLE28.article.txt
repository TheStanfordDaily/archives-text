# Stanford shoots 61 percent from the field, clears bench in 30-point laugher

USC interim head coach Henry
Bibby may have wished he
received a pink slip along with
former head coach Charlie Parker
after the 99-69 demolishing Stan
ford laid on Bibby's Trojans
before 5,982 last night at Maples
Pavilion.
Bibby, who took over for Park
er on Wednesday, had no answers
for the 25th-ranked Cardinal's
dominating win. It was the
largest margin of victory ever in
the 79-year series.
"There aren't too many com
ments I can make," Bibby said.
"I'm glad it's over."
With his team wracked with
foul trouble and missing center
Avondre Jones (he missed the
plane), Bibby and his players
stood around and watched as
Stanford shot 61 percent from the
field.
Senior Andy Poppink led all
scorers with 20 points on 8-for-14
shooting. Freshman Mark Seaton
threw down a career-high 18, con
necting seven of nine times from
the field.
"Ball movement was a big part
of that," Poppink said, who also
grabbed nine rebounds. "A lot of
our 37 makes were lay-ins. Every
body was moving the ball well."
With the Trojans (11-11 over
all, 4-6 Pacific 10 Conference)
committing early on defense, the

Cardinal (14-5, 7-3) continually
found open men under the bas
ket. The 28 assists marked a sea
son-high for Stanford, with every
player except one tallying at least
one dish. Junior Brevin Knight
recorded 10 in only 25 minutes of
play.
"You don't always shoot the
ball as well as we did tonight, but
if you pass, you will," head coach
Mike Montgomery said.
After jumping ahead 11-2
behind two three-pointers by
Dion Cross and one by Knight,
Stanford saw the Trojans fight
back to tie the game at 20 with 10
minutes to play on a Tyson
Reuter three-pointer.
The physical play inside, which
put senior Darren Allaway on the
bench with three early fouls, got
under the collar of Montgomery,
who drew a rare technical foul.
The game settled down after that,
as Stanford's precision passing
cut apart a porous Trojan
defense.
The Cardinal finished off the
first half with a 25-13 run. Sever
al Trojan big men got into foul
trouble early in the second half,
handcuffing any hope for a mira
cle comeback. Back-up center
David Crouse, forced into a start
ing role because of Jones'
absence, and freshman Maurice
Strong couldn't keep their hands
to themselves, and both found
themselves on the bench for good
with 9:19 to play and Stanford
leading 74-47.
"We were definitely backed into
a corner," Bibby said. "Crouse is a
backup and Strong only plays
seven or eight minutes a game. We
got outplayed in there."
The only bad note to come out
of last night's win was a missed
free throw by Cross, which
snapped his streak of 27 consecu
tive makes. Cross finished with 19
points and continued to showcase
the return of his outside shot, hit
ting four of six from long range.
With the outcome of the game
decided early in the second half,
the Maples faithful got a chance to
see all of Stanford's bench get into
the game. Every player who suited
up scored at least two points (fresh

man Peter Sauer was out with the
flu) and the bench racked up 38
points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists.
The rout was punctuated by a
three-pointer by sophomore Mark
Thompson and an alley-oop dunk
from freshman Karl Wente to
freshman Kris Weems, who caught
the ball low and powered it home
with a two-handed tomahawk.
Riding a wave of momentum
created by four straight wins,
Stanford gets another shot at
league-leading UCLA tomorrow
at 2 p.m. in Maples. The No. 17
Bruins (16-5, 9-1) held Cal score
less over the last 3:49 of their
game last night to win 73-65.
Earlier this season, UCLA

defeated Stanford 64-56 by hold
ing the Cardinal to 34.4 percent
shooting. The Bruins also outre
bounded Stanford 51-30.
Over the last four games, the
Cardinal is shooting 56 percent
from the field and 51 percent from
beyond the three-point line. The
Bruins lead the nation in shooting
percentage at 53.1 percent.
The hot shooting and four
game winning streak may have
the Cardinal ready to face the
defending national champions,
but Montgomery isn't so sure.
"Is there one?" he said,
answering whether this is a good
time to play the Bruins. "It's the
next game and it's at our place."
