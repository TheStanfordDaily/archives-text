USC interim head coach Henry
Bibby may have wished he
received a pink slip along with
former head coach Charlie Parker
after the 99-69 demolishing Stan
ford laid on Bibby's Trojans
before 5,982 last night at Maples
Pavilion.
Bibby, who took over for Park
er on Wednesday, had no answers
for the 25th-ranked Cardinal's
dominating win. It was the
largest margin of victory ever in
the 79-year series.
"There aren't too many com
ments I can make," Bibby said.
"I'm glad it's over."
With his team wracked with
foul trouble and missing center
Avondre Jones (he missed the
plane), Bibby and his players
stood around and watched as
Stanford shot 61 percent from the
field.
Senior Andy Poppink led all
scorers with 20 points on 8-for-14
shooting. Freshman Mark Seaton
threw down a career-high 18, con
necting seven of nine times from
the field.
"Ball movement was a big part
of that," Poppink said, who also
grabbed nine rebounds. "A lot of
our 37 makes were lay-ins. Every
body was moving the ball well."
With the Trojans (11-11 over
all, 4-6 Pacific 10 Conference)
committing early on defense, the

Cardinal (14-5, 7-3) continually
found open men under the bas
ket. The 28 assists marked a sea
son-high for Stanford, with every
player except one tallying at least
one dish. Junior Brevin Knight
recorded 10 in only 25 minutes of
play.
"You don't always shoot the
ball as well as we did tonight, but
if you pass, you will," head coach
Mike Montgomery said.
After jumping ahead 11-2
behind two three-pointers by
Dion Cross and one by Knight,
Stanford saw the Trojans fight
back to tie the game at 20 with 10
minutes to play on a Tyson
Reuter three-pointer.
The physical play inside, which
put senior Darren Allaway on the
bench with three early fouls, got
under the collar of Montgomery,
who drew a rare technical foul.
The game settled down after that,
as Stanford's precision passing
cut apart a porous Trojan
defense.
The Cardinal finished off the
first half with a 25-13 run. Sever
al Trojan big men got into foul
trouble early in the second half,
handcuffing any hope for a mira
cle comeback. Back-up center
David Crouse, forced into a start
ing role because of Jones'
absence, and freshman Maurice
Strong couldn't keep their hands
to themselves, and both found
themselves on the bench for good
with 9:19 to play and Stanford
leading 74-47.
"We were definitely backed into
a corner," Bibby said. "Crouse is a
backup and Strong only plays
seven or eight minutes a game. We
got outplayed in there."
