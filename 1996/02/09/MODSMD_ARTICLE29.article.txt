## Cardinal will play three vs. Santa Clara this weekend 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
After traveling to Sacramento to meet the Cal State-
Sacramento Hornets in a midweek contest two days ago,
the No. 2-ranked Stanford baseball team will take on area
rival Santa Clara in a three-game series this weekend.
Wednesday at Sacramento State, the Cardinal (5-2)
pulled out a 5-3 victory over the Hornets, thanks to a
two-out, two-run double in the top of the ninth by first
baseman Troy Kent. The loss left Sacramento State
winless on the year in five outings.
Stanford coach Mark Marquess got another good out
ing from his pitching staff els all four Cardinal hurlers
proved effective on the mound. Freshman right-hander
Chad Hutchinson tossed five innings in his first collegiate
start, allowing two runs on five hits while striking out five
and walking two. Senior Mario Iglesias followed Hutchin
son, providing two innings of relief. Junior Brendan Sul
livan then worked two-thirds of an inning before handing
the ball to Tom Reimers (2-0), who finished the contest
and earned his second win of the season in relief.
