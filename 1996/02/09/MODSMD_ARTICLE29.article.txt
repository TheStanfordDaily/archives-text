# Baseball steals win from Sac State
## Cardinal will play three vs. Santa Clara this weekend 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
After traveling to Sacramento to meet the Cal State-
Sacramento Hornets in a midweek contest two days ago,
the No. 2-ranked Stanford baseball team will take on area
rival Santa Clara in a three-game series this weekend.
Wednesday at Sacramento State, the Cardinal (5-2)
pulled out a 5-3 victory over the Hornets, thanks to a
two-out, two-run double in the top of the ninth by first
baseman Troy Kent. The loss left Sacramento State
winless on the year in five outings.
Stanford coach Mark Marquess got another good out
ing from his pitching staff els all four Cardinal hurlers
proved effective on the mound. Freshman right-hander
Chad Hutchinson tossed five innings in his first collegiate
start, allowing two runs on five hits while striking out five
and walking two. Senior Mario Iglesias followed Hutchin
son, providing two innings of relief. Junior Brendan Sul
livan then worked two-thirds of an inning before handing
the ball to Tom Reimers (2-0), who finished the contest
and earned his second win of the season in relief.

Reimers has yet to allow a
run in 91/3 innings of work this
year, giving up just four hits
while striking out 14 and walk
ing only two. The six-foot-two
right-hander pitched six
innings of scoreless relief to
earn a win in the Cardinal's 5-3
victory in Hawaii two weekends
ago.
Stanford also had success at
the plate on Wednesday, accu
mulating 11 hits. Designated
hitter Jon Schaeffer spearhead
ed the Cardinal attack, going 3-
for-4 with a double and an RBI.
Schaeffer leads the Cardinal in
hitting with a .423 average on
the season.
"Jon is swinging the bat fairly
well," Marquess said. "He's not
totally happy with it — he thinks
he can do better — but he's
doing a really good job. It is

important for him to do well,
hitting behind A.J. [Hinch].
When he is hitting well, A.J. sees
more good pitching. Pitchers
can't walk A.J. to get to Jon."
Indeed, Uinch, who hit .366
last year as a junior, has bene
fited from the presence ofScha
effer behind him in the lineup.
The senior catcher is hitting
.385 and leads the team in mul
tiple-hit games with four.
But the big hit of the day
against Sac State was delivered
by Kent, whose game-winning
RBIs were his first of the sea
son. The Hornets held leads of
2-1 after three innings and 3-2
after seven before the Cardinal
tied the game on right fielder
Joe Kilburg's two-out RBI sin
gle in the eighth, setting the
stage for Kent's heroics.
"That was a big two-out dou
ble," Marquess said of the
game-winning hit. "It gave us
that two-run cushion. [Wednes
day's game) was a good win for
us, because we haven't gotten

the big hit with men on base
this year. We haven't scored a
lot of runs even though we've
had a lot of hits and a lot of men
on base."
The Cardinal will make the
short trip to Santa Clara's Buck
Shaw Stadium this afternoon
for a 2 p.m. matchup with the
Broncos. The teams face off at
Sunken Diamond at 4:30 p.m.
Saturday, then finish the series
at Santa Clara on Sunday in a 1
p.m. start. The two squads will
meet once more this year, May 7
at Stanford. Probable starters
for the Cardinal are Kyle Peter
son today, Jason Middlebrook
or Igl esias on Saturday and
Iglesias or freshman Jeff Austin
Sunday.
"This is a very good rivalry,"
said Marquess, whose team split
four games with the Broncos in
1995. "It's always tough, it's
always a good series. They are
usually a good, solid team and
we don't expect anything differ
ent this weekend."
