# Feminists consider role of affirmative action policies
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Two of the country's most prominent femi
nist critics of contemporary culture and the
media spoke last night, urging audience mem
bers to rethink the relationship between
women and affirmative action.
Susan Faludi and Dr. Julianne Malveaux —
one a renowned journalist and author and the
other a popular radio talk show host — told an
overflowing crowd at Cubberley Auditorium
to be wary of a "media that misinforms" and
opponents who accuse affirmative action of
promoting reverse discrimination.
The two women were invited by the Presi
dent's Committee on Culture and Cultures as
part of the "E Pluribus Unum? American Na
tional Identity / Identities" conference this
weekend.
Contest ing the notion that affirmative ac
tion is based on discrimination, both speakers
stressed that the policy should be considered
as a method of outreach, recruiting and ex
panding the pool of applicants.
Both speakers encouraged the audience to

organize a political efTort to block the Califor
nia Civil Rights Initiative, a bill that aims to
eliminate affirmative action from admissions,
hiring and contracting procedures.
Much of their discussion focused on the fail
ure of affirmative action opponents to place
growing fears ofjob insecurity in the context of
the current economic trends toward downsiz
ing.
"The bottom line is job uncertainty," said
Malveaux, who received a doctorate in eco
nomics from MIT. "In an economic climate in
which unemployment and temporary posi
tions are on the rise," fears are widespread, she
said.
Faludi — who has been both a Knight Fel
low at Stanford and a scholar at Stanford's In
stitute for Research on Women and Gender —
cited statistics that reveal large gaps in wage
levels between male and female workers.
Malveaux added that most of the economic
activity making millionaires of stock brokers
and investment bankers is not doing much to
improve lives of America's poor and middle
classes.
"There is tremendous excite
ment on Wall Street and tremen
dous pain on Main Street," she said,
sparking a round of supportive
shouts and applause.
Both she and Faludi cited sta
tistics from the Equal Employ
ment Commission which say that
only 3 percent of the employment
discrimination cases filed last
year were complaints from men.
This proves, they said, that the
claim that men suffer from un

just job discrimination more so
than women and minorities is
false.
It is not affirmative action, the
speakers argued, but rather the
sour "post-industrial" national
economy, the growing trend to
ward downsizing and "interna
tionalization" that are responsible
for the rise in unemployment and
heightened fears of losing jobs.
Referring to the long history of
good-old-boy networking through
which she claims many of the coun
try's privileged men have ascended
corporate ladders, Faludi asked the
audience, "Why aren't we asking
questions about 'affirmative nepo
tism?' "
