# Volleyball geared up for big weekend
## Stanford will face No. 2 Long Beach, eighth-ranked USC 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
The fourth-ranked Stanford men's volleyball team
returns to action this weekend at Burnham Pavilion
with matches tonight against No. 2 Long Beach State
and tomorrow against eighth-ranked USC. With a 3-0
record in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play, the
Cardinal looks to make an early season statement
against these two formidable league rivals.
"We've seen both teams before, but we haven't seen
them at full strength," said Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves. "We'll try to prepare well and give [the team]
enough information. There will be little room for error
with opponents of this quality."
The Cardinal crossed paths with these two teams
three weeks ago at the UC-Santa Barbara collegiate
tournament. In shortened two-out-of-three matches,
Stanford beat the Trojans 15-3, 15-13, then dispatched
the 49ers 15-4, 15-10 in the tournament's fifth-place
match. USC eventually placed ninth in the competition.
Long Beach State enters tonight's match boasting an
unblemished 4-0 record, including a 2-0 mark in MPSF
play. The 49ers mix talent with an extremely deep
bench — eight players have started for the team at
some point. Long Beach also executes extremely effec
tively on offense, as evidenced by their top-ranked .403
hitting percentage.
This year's 49er squad is led by Player of the Year
candidate Tom Hoff, a senior opposite hitter. Hoff cur
rently ranks fourth nationally in hitting percentage at
494 while averaging nearly six kills per match. Senior
middle blocker Neil Mendel adds a strong presence up
front with his six-foot-seven frame. Mendel not only
rank second in the nation in hitting percentage (.528),
but also averages two blocks per game.
"The bad news is they have three or four other guys
that can really hurt us," Nieves said.
Senior setter Steve Walker averages nearly 17 assists
per match while junior outside hitter Geoffrey Cryst
finished second on the team in kills last .season with
341.

The Trojans visit Stanford with a
3-2 overall record and 2-1 mark in
league play. Their lone league defeat
came last Tuesday night at the
hands of Long Beach. In a thrilling
match, the Trojans jumped out to a
two-game lead before the 49ers
stormed back to take the final three,
including an exciting 15-13 decision
in the decisive fifth frame.
"What gets [the Trojansl into
trouble is that they can't go
beyond their first six players,"
Nieves said. "They don't have the
flexibility that Long Beach or
Stanford has."
Despite the shortcomings on
its bench, however, USC boasts a
formidable starting lineup.
Junior swing hitter Chris
Guigliano leads the team with
106 kills. Senior swing hitter Rus
sell Brock is comintr off a season

in which he finished with 385
kills. And while the Trojans did
lose three-time All-American
Jason Mulholland to graduation,
freshman opposite hitter Gabe
Gardner of San Clemente High
School has stepped right into his
place. Gardner, considered by
many to be the nation's top
recruit last season, has registered
85 kills thus far this season.
Stanford will be at relatively
full strength when it takes to the
hardwood this weekend. Sopho
more outside hitter Jeff Bender
has not been cleared to play due
to a back injury he suffered last
week. Junior middle blocker
Brian Moore also has some aches
and pains, most notably a sore
finger that was dislocated last
weekend against San Diego State.
Unlike Bender, however, Moore,
second on the team with 47 kills,
will probably see action tonight.
In the meantime, junior oppo
site hitter Matt Fuerbringer con
tinues to make progress with his

healing shoulder, posting some of
his best numbers of the season
last weekend against the SDSU.
"That was a definite continuation
of his return to 100 percent,"
Nieves said.
Fuerbringer currently ranks
12th in the nation in kills per
game with a 4.82 average and has
a .409 hitting percentage. Junior
setter Stewart Chong, who is
averaging 16 assists per match
this season, has run an effective
offense that is third nationally
with a .376 hitting percentage.
Nieves is confident his team
can establish itself as a force atop
the Pacific Division.
"I feel we need to get off to a
good start in every game. Both of
these opponents are teams that
can make you pay and hold us
more accountable for our mis
takes," Nieves said. "We're not
going to catch (Long Beach or
USCJ by surprise. We all see them
as big early season matches. But I
think we can beat these guys."
