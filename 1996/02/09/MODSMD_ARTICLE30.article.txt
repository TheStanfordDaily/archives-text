# Volleyball geared up for big weekend
## Stanford will face No. 2 Long Beach, eighth-ranked USC 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
The fourth-ranked Stanford men's volleyball team
returns to action this weekend at Burnham Pavilion
with matches tonight against No. 2 Long Beach State
and tomorrow against eighth-ranked USC. With a 3-0
record in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play, the
Cardinal looks to make an early season statement
against these two formidable league rivals.
"We've seen both teams before, but we haven't seen
them at full strength," said Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves. "We'll try to prepare well and give [the team]
enough information. There will be little room for error
with opponents of this quality."
The Cardinal crossed paths with these two teams
three weeks ago at the UC-Santa Barbara collegiate
tournament. In shortened two-out-of-three matches,
Stanford beat the Trojans 15-3, 15-13, then dispatched
the 49ers 15-4, 15-10 in the tournament's fifth-place
match. USC eventually placed ninth in the competition.
Long Beach State enters tonight's match boasting an
unblemished 4-0 record, including a 2-0 mark in MPSF
play. The 49ers mix talent with an extremely deep
bench — eight players have started for the team at
some point. Long Beach also executes extremely effec
tively on offense, as evidenced by their top-ranked .403
hitting percentage.
This year's 49er squad is led by Player of the Year
candidate Tom Hoff, a senior opposite hitter. Hoff cur
rently ranks fourth nationally in hitting percentage at
494 while averaging nearly six kills per match. Senior
middle blocker Neil Mendel adds a strong presence up
front with his six-foot-seven frame. Mendel not only
rank second in the nation in hitting percentage (.528),
but also averages two blocks per game.
"The bad news is they have three or four other guys
that can really hurt us," Nieves said.
Senior setter Steve Walker averages nearly 17 assists
per match while junior outside hitter Geoffrey Cryst
finished second on the team in kills last .season with
341.
