Forgive the Stanford women's bas
ketball team if it thinks it's seeing dou
ble in Los Angeles this weekend.
Tonight at 7:30 p.m., the fourth
ranked Stanford women (16-2, 9-0
Pacific 10 Conference) will take the
floor at USC's Lyon Center to face the
Trojans in a game which marks Cardi
nal co-head coach Marianne Stanley's
return to the school she coached from
1989-93. The finale of the trip comes
Sunday afternoon at 4 p.m. at Pauley
Pavilion against the Bruins.
In USC and UCI.A, the City of Angels
boasts two teams that could hardly be
more .similar. After much pre-season
hype, both teams sport identical 9-9
records and 4-5 marks in the Pacific-10
Conference, where they share fifth place
along with Oregon and Arizona. An All-
Pac-10 post player highlights each squad;
USC boasts junior phenom Tina Thomp
son while UCLA has Kisa Hughes.
With 40 career double-doubles and a
second-place ranking in the Pac-10 in
both scoring (23.3 points per game) and

rebounding (9.6), Thompson continues
her push for All-America honors. How
ever, she has struggled in the recent
past against the Cardinal, mustering
just a 5-for-19 shooting performance in
Stanford's 88-67 victory at Maples
Pavilion on Jan. 13. Freshman Adrain
Williams and Michelle Campbell help to
provide punch for the Trojans.
Hughes' numbers have slipped a bit
from last year to 12.8 points and 7.4
rebounds. That may be due in part to the
solid play of six-foot-five senior Zrinka
Kristich, who has provided an offensive
boost for the Bruins in recent games.
Still, the Bruins, one of the best rebound
ing teams in the Pac-10 last year, figure
last in the conference in rebounding mar
gin this season. They also remain the
worst free-throw shooting team in the
conference by an unhealthy margin.
While the Women of Troy shoot their
free throws adequately, they have been
plagued by shooting woes from the
perimeter. With senior point guard
Audrey Gomez sidelined for the year
with a knee injury, freshman Erica
