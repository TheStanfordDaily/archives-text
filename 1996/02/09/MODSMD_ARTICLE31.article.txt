# Women's hoops headed for Southern California

Forgive the Stanford women's bas
ketball team if it thinks it's seeing dou
ble in Los Angeles this weekend.
Tonight at 7:30 p.m., the fourth
ranked Stanford women (16-2, 9-0
Pacific 10 Conference) will take the
floor at USC's Lyon Center to face the
Trojans in a game which marks Cardi
nal co-head coach Marianne Stanley's
return to the school she coached from
1989-93. The finale of the trip comes
Sunday afternoon at 4 p.m. at Pauley
Pavilion against the Bruins.
In USC and UCI.A, the City of Angels
boasts two teams that could hardly be
more .similar. After much pre-season
hype, both teams sport identical 9-9
records and 4-5 marks in the Pacific-10
Conference, where they share fifth place
along with Oregon and Arizona. An All-
Pac-10 post player highlights each squad;
USC boasts junior phenom Tina Thomp
son while UCLA has Kisa Hughes.
With 40 career double-doubles and a
second-place ranking in the Pac-10 in
both scoring (23.3 points per game) and

rebounding (9.6), Thompson continues
her push for All-America honors. How
ever, she has struggled in the recent
past against the Cardinal, mustering
just a 5-for-19 shooting performance in
Stanford's 88-67 victory at Maples
Pavilion on Jan. 13. Freshman Adrain
Williams and Michelle Campbell help to
provide punch for the Trojans.
Hughes' numbers have slipped a bit
from last year to 12.8 points and 7.4
rebounds. That may be due in part to the
solid play of six-foot-five senior Zrinka
Kristich, who has provided an offensive
boost for the Bruins in recent games.
Still, the Bruins, one of the best rebound
ing teams in the Pac-10 last year, figure
last in the conference in rebounding mar
gin this season. They also remain the
worst free-throw shooting team in the
conference by an unhealthy margin.
While the Women of Troy shoot their
free throws adequately, they have been
plagued by shooting woes from the
perimeter. With senior point guard
Audrey Gomez sidelined for the year
with a knee injury, freshman Erica
Mashia has come on to lead the
conference in free-throw percent
age.
Like USC, the Bruins sport
one of the top recruiting classes
in the nation. Top freshman
Takiyah Jackson is redshirting
due to a knee injury, but Erica
Gomez has stepped into the point
guard slot and moved last year's
starter, Ricarda Kuypers, to the
bench. Leading scorer Nickey
Hilbert (17.8 ppg) has emerged
as a potential superstar this sea
son, scoring a then-career-high
29 against the Cardinal on Jan.
11.
But Hilbert's January perfor
mance paled in comparison to
Stanford junior Kate Starbird's.
The Cardinal's leading scorer
posted career highs in consecutive
games against the Southern Cali
fornia squads last month, with 33
in the UCLA contest and a school
record 44 against USC. UCLA's
defensive counterpart, Tawana
Grimes, stands just 5-9 to Star
bird's 6-2, while USC's Jody
Anton is too slow and Erica Jack
son too short (5-8).
With sophomore forward
Vanessa Nygaard averaging just a
shade under 10 rebounds per
game in the Pac-10, sophomore
post player Naomi Mulitauaopele
pouring in 13 points per confer
ence contest and sophomore for
ward Heather Owen returning to
health, it's no mystery why the
Cardinal has enjoyed such recent
success in the Pac-10.
Indeed, Stanford remains in
the midst of its best five-game
defensive stretch in 20 years. In
the last five contests, no Stanford
opponent has scored 55 points or
shot better than 34 percent.
Never has the Cardinal extended
such a streak to six games. Junior
point guard Jamila Wideman, in
addition to her better than two
to-one assist-to-turnover ratio,
has rem stored almost three steals

per game.
Consequently, while the Los
Angeles teams struggle, the Car
dinal rides a 10-game win streak
and sits on a lofty perch in (he
Pac-10 standings. Oregon State
and the Washington schools
remain three games behind Stan
ford and play each other this
weekend, giving the Cardinal an
opportunity to further distance

itself from the pack.
Stanford lost its longest home
court winning streak in the
nation to Alcorn State two nights
ago, but major crowds on the
road should not deter the Cardi
nal this weekend. The Lyon Cen
ter holds just 1,200 and seldom
sells out, and the Bruins draw
just under 600 a game to Pauley
Pavilion.
