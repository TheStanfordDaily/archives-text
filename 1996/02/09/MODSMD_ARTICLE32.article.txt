The Stanford wrestling team is back
on track, just in time for what may be its
biggest dual meet of the season. After
suffering through several injury-ridden
weeks that saw key team leaders side
lined, the entire starting lineup is healthy
once again and primed to take down a
struggling Pacific team (0-5) and a pow
erful Oregon (5-3-1) squad this Sunday in
Eugene, Ore.
The Cardinal has earned two straight
victories at the expense of UC-Davis and
Cal State-Fullerton and now boasts a
dual-meet record of 4-4 for the 95-96 sea
son. Senior team captain Tod Surmon
(150 pounds), ranked fifth nationally in
his weight class, is excited about the Car
dinal's two-meet win streak.
"It's good that we have gotten just
about everyone back in the line up," Sur
mon said. "We're now the team that was
talked about at the beginning of the sea
son."
In Pacific, Stanford does not face a
particularly strong team. The Tigers
have suffered through a disappointing
season without a single victory to speak
of, and the Cardinal is hoping for a sound
victory.
Oregon is an entirely different story.
With five victories, one tie and only three
losses, the Ducks offer a stiff challenge
for Stanford. Oregon has enjoyed a long
string of victories against the Cardinal,
including last year's '21-15 win, one of the

most exciting dual meets of the season.
"I am really looking forward to the
Oregon dual," said assistant coach Jay
Jackson, who will fill in for 17-year head
coach Chris Horpel this weekend. (Hor
pel is in Newtown Square, Penn. at the
request of the family of slain world-class
wrestler Dave Schultz, who was a close
friend of Horpel and an assistant coach
for the Cardinal.) "Tod [Surmon], Jimmy
[Aguirre] and Matt [Cano] are each
wrestling outstanding opponents. These
matches will be a prelude to the Pacific

10 Conference championships and the
NCAA's. They are all in for a battle."
Surmon will take an undefeated
record (15-0) into his match with Scott
Norton (25-1) in the 150-pound weight
class. Norton is currently ranked fourth
in the NCAA while Surmon ranks fifth.
This pairing will create a rematch of last
year's Pac-10 finals, which Norton won.
Surmon will drop down to 142 pounds by
season's end for the Pac-10 and NCAA
tournaments, but he wanted a chance at
redemption against Norton.
Senior team leader Jimmy Aguirre will
