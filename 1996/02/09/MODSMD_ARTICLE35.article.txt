# True love what?
## 
### 
My drawmate is feeling oppressed today.
He came into my room early this
morning, snuggled up against me and
started crying. 1 am a very heavy sleeper.
Groggy, I thought it was my girlfriend and put
my hand on his thigh. She hasn't shaved, I
thought.
I tried the other thigh. He punched me in
the face.
My pleasant dreams truncated, 1 asked my
drawmate what he was doing in my bed and
what he had done with my girlfriend. He
hadn't seen her, he whimpered. Then he blew
his nose on my sheets.
"What's wrong?" 1 asked.
Between sobs he told me, "Valentine's
Day." The guy had a case: Contrary to the
Dominant White Male Heterosexual Social
Paradigm, he wasn't in love and it was already
February. Sure my drawmate is a white male
heterosexual, but come Valentine's Day,
that's not good enough. "I've got to be happy."
he wailed.
The previous day he had seen the Rinc-a-
Delt kids selling roses in White Plaza, but he
had nobody to give one to.
"Give one to my girlfriend," 1 told him. (He
already owed me three bucks anyway.)
He hlcw his nose on my sheets again.
And that's when I realized that even
though my love life resembles the cover of a
Harlequin Romance, I shouldn't mention that
to anyone especially this time of year. I'd
alienate a lot of people. I don't want to rub
salt in your wounds, it's bad enough that for
the next two weeks you'll be eating those
heart-shaped pieces of chalk that say, "I Love
You."
"I hate myself!" my drawmate cried out,
gasping for breath. He had been crying for a
long time and was making that Lamaze
wheezing sound, the impending holiday too

much to bear.
1 gave him tht* spiel about how Valentine's
Day is overrated anyway and I gave him a
Kleenex. He refused to listen.
"Easy for you to say," he lashed back. "You
have a girlfriend. And she's not a lesbian this
time, either." Hi' had a point. For the first
time in my life, I am looking forward to shar
ing Valentine's Day with someone.
Hut 1 didn't want to offend the poor kid
likewise, I 'd hate to estrange my more hitter,
celibate readers with something mushy -so 1
told him all the had things about Valentine's
Day: "Remember the St. Valentines Da\ mas
sacre?"
"The Valentines Day Massacre is going to
be when I'm 35 and still a virgin and I go to
the Hallmark Store with an AK-47. You aren't
helping."
He was right, I wasn't helping.
I decided to help him: "Let's go."
True Love Waits
Meeting Tonight
followed by
Immaculate Reception
I had never been to Terman Engineering
Building before. My friend and I made out
wav through the zigzag hallways to the "True
Love Waits" meeting. We entered a dimly lit,
smoke-filled room in which three dozen people
I had never seen before were discussing t heir
sex lives (or lack thereof). As we entered, the
leader of the organization, who we will call
"Mr. Racquetball," called the meeting to
order. My drawmate and 1 joined all the
undergraduates, on one side of the room,
across from the graduate students and Hoover
fellows. Mr. Racquetball recited a short trea
tise on ;ihst inciicc that would have made the

Pope proud. After his speech (which con
demned premarital sex and, in its place, rec
ommended watching videos and microwaving
popcorn), he opened the floor for discussion. I
raised my hand.
"Does this mean no heavy petting?
The meeting came to a grinding halt. (I
thought 1 had asked a legitimate question,
after all, the "sex act" is frequently open to
interpretation.) "Do you mock us? the man
at the podium asked. I withdrew into a corner.
My drawmate, however, was captivated by the
speaker up until the very end. Suddenly, it
dawned on my friend that everyone in the
room had made a conscious decison to remain
in their celibate states.
"You mean, you guys have girlfriends but
you don't want to have sex? Are you people
sane?" My drawmate was perplexed because
he hasn't been on a date since . . . (Now think
back, dear reader. Think back to your first
kiss. Remember that magical moment, so long
ago? When did it happen?) He hasn't been on
a date since before that.
My drawmate collapsed on the ground,
grief stricken, weary with a new burden, the
burden of knowledge, the awareness of that
paradoxical weight that accompanies any
epiphany about people who don't get out and
don't want to: Valentine's Day is discrimina
tory.

Jason Wish now regrets that this is the only
column he can never show his parents (for two
reasons: 1. He's talking about sex and 2. He's
talking about celibacy — subjects he'd rather
not discuss with them).
