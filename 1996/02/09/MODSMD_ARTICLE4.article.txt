# Finance reform draws criticism
## Senators question feasibility of limits 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
Continuing
debate over a
controversial bill
introduced at
the last ASSU
Senate meeting
has raised ques
tions of whether
campaign fi
nance reform for
the ASSU elec
tions is feasible.

The bill calls for lowering lim
its for independent candidates
campaigning to be senators from
$120 to $60. Political parties can
spend no more than $100 cam
paigning for the party, while spe
cial-fee groups are limited to a
$500 budget. The senate will dis
cuss the legislation at Tuesday's
meeting.
Independent undergraduate
senator Howard Loo is concerned
that the limits would hurt those
senators who are not affiliated
with a party. "Lowering the
amount that individual candi
dates can spend would hamper
the ability of candidates like my
self to challenge parties," he said.
Also at issue are vague defini
tions of political parties.
"It's not clear what a party is
defined as," said graduate senator
Doug Natelson, who is also con

cerned about whether the limits
can be realistically enforced. "We
have no concrete definition of
what a political party is. We need
a rule which is self-consistent and
which has no loopholes."
The accounting procedures for
campaign spending are equally
vague, senators said.
"What is going to constitute
campaigning?," asked graduate
student Neil Crellin, a former
deputy senate chair. "There are a
million ways to creatively account
for finances, which are complete
ly uncountable."
Because of this ambiguity, Loo
said, "these rules only hurt people
who follow the rules."
Still, some senators feel candi
dates will accurately account for
finances.
"These spending limits can be
effective and should be enforced,"
said undergraduate senator Kim
berly Bayer. "For most people, it's
not that big of an issue that they
would challenge the limits."
Furthermore, said undergrad
uate senator Angela Parker, "lim
its are necessary. They aid stu
dents who aren't wealthy. They
are a symbolic thing. The number
[of the limit] is arbitrary."
The campaign spending re
form controversy appears to be
far from over, and senators are

concerned that the issues are
being pushed aside while techni
calities form the focus of the de
bate
"This bill has received more de
bate and attention than anything
we've done all year," said under
graduate senator Steve Russell, a
member of the Students' Alliance.
Some senators felt that the na

ture of the discussion was hurting
the ASSU's credibility.
"This type of brouhaha tends to
make the administration look
down on us," said Natelson. "It
would be nice to move on and talk
about getting things done."
According to Crellin, the debate
has highlighted senators' con
cerns about getting reelected.
"Some senators can't manage to
do anything more worthwhile
than bicker about getting a new
generation of themselves elected,"
he said.
