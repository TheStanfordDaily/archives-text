### David Stein Contributing writer 
Opening a three-day conference on
American national identity, Pulitzer
Prize winner and famed historian
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. condemned
"multicultural militants" for disuniting
the country in a keynote address yester
day at Kresge Auditorium.
Evoking the words of Mahatma
Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., in
his speech — titled "The Multicultural
Debate: Where Are We Now?"
Schlesinger reminded the crowd of
about 300 that the struggle for national

unity still lies ahead.
"We must remember we are one peo
ple, Americans first, woven into a single
garment of destiny. There is still the un
ending fight to make this American vi
sion an American reality," Schlesinger
said.
In Schlesinger's view, this "American
vision" of one people united by a com
mon civic responsibility is hampered by
multicultural ideologues who threaten
the concepts of free speech and expres
sion. These "militants" have harmfully
shifted society's concern away from the
individual to separate racial, religious
and gender groups, Schlesinger said.

"The politics of identity, carried too
far, lead to fragmentation and Balka
nization," warned Schlesinger, former
special assistant to {'resident Kennedy
and currently a professor of history at
Harvard University.
While noting that "we have miles to
go without sleep" before achieving racial
justice, Schlesinger did stress that sepa
ratist groups who "glorify their own past
distract from the learning and teaching
of American history."
This history, founded on democracy
and liberty, is threatened by the multi-
culturalists' attack on the First
Amendment, Schlesinger said. He
pointed to Stanford's now-defunct
speech code as an example of the
"assault on the Bill of Rights"
which limits talk not deemed po
litically correct.
"Intellectual freedom ... is
freedom for the thought we hate,"
Schlesinger said.
In a question session after the

speech, Schlesinger told a con
tentious crowd what the equality
multiculturalists hope to achieve
through education would be better
achieved through a "provision of
jobs." He said university classes
designed to study only racial and
religious differences are "foolish
courses."
Schlesinger was asked to be a
keynote speaker because he is a
"man of great eminence," History
Prof. George Fredrickson said ear
lier yesterday.
"I would consider Schlesinger
one of the two most distinguished

living historians in the United
States," Fredrickson said.
Schlesinger's speech is part of
the Stanford-sponsored confer
ence, titled "E Pluribus
Unum? American National
Identity / Identities," which in
cludes talks and informal panels
on issues of diversity and educa
tion.
The purpose of the conference
is to celebrate the faculty's com
mitment to multiculturalism and
to "focus the pedagogical issue" on
diversity, said Asst. Dean of Hu
manities Ellen Woods.
