MORGAN STANLEY
PUBLIC FINANCE ANALYST PROGRAM
Morgan Stanley's Public Finance Department invites Stanford college seniors to consider
two-year job opportunities in its Public Finance Analyst Program.
An Analyst in Public Finance will be involved with serving the varied financial needs of
public sector entities. During the two year program, a Public Finance Analyst will have the
opportunity to become familiar with a range of public sector entities such as state and local
governments, electric and water utilities, non-profit hospitals, and mass transportation
authorities, to name a few. Analyst responsibilities include defining and generating
quantitative analyses, assisting the drafting of business development presentations,
providing execution support for financing transactions and coordinating the work of the
financing team.
Each Analyst will work two consecutive years in Public Finance as a member of the West
Coast coverage group. To integrate incoming Analysts into the industry, Morgan Stanley
provides a formal three-week training program covering essential information about the
Firm, municipal finance, accounting and computer software for quantitative analysis. While
there is no prerequisite major or job experience, Morgan Stanley is seeking candidates who
exhibit the following qualities:
• Outstanding academic record (again, no requisite major, but must be adept with
numbers and mathematical concepts)
• Demonstrated leadership and teamwork capability
• Strong written and oral communication skills
• Ability to work under pressure and set priorities
• Willingness to work long hours, as necessary
• An interest in public policy and finance
Please submit resume and cover letter by February 22,1996 to:
