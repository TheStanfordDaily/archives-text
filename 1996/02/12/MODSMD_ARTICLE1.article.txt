# Trustees to discuss tuition hikes, FRI
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
As the University Board of
Trustees meets today and tomor
row, it will discuss next year's tu
ition — a figure that has been in
creasing at a rate 2 percent to 3 per
cent higher than inflation over the
last few years.
Trustees will also discuss the
possible closure of the Food Re
search Institute.
"I understand that the issue of
the rate of tuition increase has an
enormous effect on students and
their parents," said trustee Isaac
Stein. "We need to do everything
we can to minimize the increase."
Mike Choo, a student member
of the Board of Trustees, also said
that "both students and parents
have been feeling the crunch— it
can be seen in the number of loans
that go out."
"Students have been expressing
their concerns, and the Provost
and the trustees and will take the
concerns into consideration when
they look at tuition on Tuesday,"
said Choo.
Trustee Ruth Halperin said
that because tuition pays for only
half of the full cost of a Stanford
education, "alumni have an obliga
tion to pay it back.
"Sure, tuition is terribly high,
but nevertheless it doesn't really
nav for vour education," she said.

Choo said trustees would care
fully examine the issues involved
at the meeting.
"We need to look at if our rate of
tuition has been higher or lower
than other universities, how the
increases affected our competitive
ness, and what impact it has on
students," said Choo.
The costs involved in running
the University could also play a
major role in the board's decision
whether or not to close the Food
Research Institute. Stein said the
closure of the institute "is definite
ly a topic for discussion."
The trustees were unable to
comment further on the institute
or its future before their meeting.
The board's agenda will become
public only after the meeting.
Both University President Ger
hard Casper and the Academic
Council have recommended that
the institute be closed down.
The board will also hear a report
on the creation of a new network
ing information system based on
Oracle software which will help re
structure the financial areas of
academic departments, Stein said.
"There has been veiy active ad
ministrative restructuring over
the past year," Stein said. "We
have a limited amount of money,
and we have to use it effectively. A
big expense is administrative ex
pense — changes in administrative
structure make it more effective."
