## GOP hopefuls woo voters 
### 
SIOUX CITY, lowa (AP) - On
the eve of the lowa caucuses, GOP
candidates hopscotched the state
yesterday, courting the one-out
of-five Republicans that polls sug
gest are undecided.
With Bob Dole's lead appearing
to stabilize, the real battle formed
around who would be second.
As the rivals moved from town
meetings and rallies to TV talk
shows, publishing heir Steve
Forbes emerged as everyone else's
favorite target.
"Forbes is falling, despite his
massive amount of negative ads,"
asserted former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander, who hoped to
benefit from any Forbes decline.
Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, trail
ing in the single digits but insist
ing he not be counted out,
ridiculed Forbes for complaining
about anonymous phone calls
against him: "He can dish it out
but he can't take it."
Dole tried to take the high
road, declining to criticize Forbes
directly. But his campaign contin
ued to air ads yesterday calling the
publisher "untested . . . and more
liberal than you think."
The Senate maioritv leader

said he was content with polls
showing him with a lead in the
high 20s, far behind the 37 per
cent he finished with in 1988
when there were more candidates
in the race.
"I want to finish first. We hope
it's a strong first," he said during
a visit to a Des Moines diner.
"And somebody else will finish
second and then we'll go on to
New Hampshire where somebody
will finish second," Dole said
Despite personal appearances,
the pre-caucus day was mostly
fought over the airwaves — boih
on live television interview shows
and with a blizzard of radio and
TV advertising.
Forbes, who has spent about $4
million in lowa, even bought 30-
minute spots which were running
on TV stations yesterday around
the state. The "infomercial," called
"Steve Forbes: A True Vision and
an Honest Voice," included testi
monials from prominent Ameri
cans, clips of him as a child and a
toped three-year-old tribute from
former President Reagan.
lowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a
Dole supporter, predicted "a huge
turnout" at today's nrecinct cau

cuses — predicting up to 150,000
voters, up from 110,000 in 1988.
Good weather was forecast across
the state.
Forbes told a luncheon in sub
urban Des Moines he was under
"vigorous, vicious" attacks from
his rivals as aides worked to play
down expectations for his show
ing.
Asked what would be an accept
able finish, campaign manager Bill
Dal Col said: "Anywhere in the top
four." Forbes himself said, "All I
want is a credible showing."
A new poll by the Des Moines
Sunday Register showed that 46
percent of likely GOP caucus
goers now view Forbes in general
ly unfavorable terms — an
increase in 20 points since the
question was first asked in a poll
published Dec. 3.
A day earlier, the paper pub
lished a poll showing Dole with a
28 percent lead, with Forbes sec
ond at 16 percent, conservative
commentator Pat Buchanan with
11 percent, Alexander at 10 per
cent and Gramm at 8 percent.
That same poll showed 19 per
cent of likely GOP caucus goers
were undecided.
