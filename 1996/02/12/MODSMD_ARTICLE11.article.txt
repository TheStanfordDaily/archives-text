Speaking terms again?
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)
The top U.S. negotiator on Bosnia
won support yesterday from the
region's key power broker in getting
Bosnian Serb leaders back on speak
ing terms with NATO — and getting
the peace process back on track.
Richard Holbrooke, an assistant
secretary of state, emerged optimistic
from talks with Serbian President Slo

bodan Milosevic.
"It was a very good meeting," Hol
brooke said.
He said Milosevic, who was instru
mental in getting the Bosnian Serb
leaders to agree to a peace plan
reached in Dayton, Ohio, had assured
him that "the Dayton process must
continue — it must not slow down."
The two discussed how to get the
Bosnian Serb military to resume high
level contacts with the NATO-led

force to implement the peace in
Bosnia, which includes 20,000 U.S.
troops.
Engineer was suspended
NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The engi
neer of the train that ran a stop sig
nal before a fatal commuter crash
had been suspended repeatedly for
failing to stop and even derailing a
train, investigators said yesterday.

John DeCurtis, who was one of
three people killed in Friday's crash,
was suspended a total of 105 days
since 1983 for the infractions, said
Jim Hall, chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Hoard.
DeCurtis derailed once, ran stop
signals twice and missed a station
once. He was last suspended for run
ning a stop signal in December 1989.
He had not been involved in any pre
vious crashes.
