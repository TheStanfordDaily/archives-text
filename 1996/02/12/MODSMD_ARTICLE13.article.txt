FURUBIRA, Japan (AP) -
Rescuers today planted explosives
for a second attempt at blasting
loose a gigantic boulder that
crushed a highway tunnel and
trapped 20 people inside.
Two freezing days and nights
after the tunnel was demolished,
hopes for finding anyone alive
were all but dashed as well. Rela
tives kept an anguished vigil at
the scene, the base of a rugged
seaside mountain in northern
Japan.
The second blasting effort,
originally set for midday today,
was delayed until later in the day
as engineers worked to supervise
the placement of the explosives.
An attempt to dislodge the boul
der with dynamite yesterday ear
lier barely budged it.
Part of the wreckage of the bus
— carrying 19 people, including
teenagers on their way to nearby
Sapporo for an annual snow festi
val — was visible, but there was
no sign of life. Searchers found the
driver's cap and gloves, but did not
hear any voices or see any other
indications anyone was alive.
Officials believe a car carrying
one person also was trapped in
the collapse.

The boulder is about 70
yards tall and 40 yards wide,
and officials believe it weighs
about 50,000 tons. The rock
appeared to be directly on top of
the bus.
Today, as workers prepared for
the second blast, snow swirled
about the tunnel's mouth and sol
diers and searchers huddled in
emergency vehicles for warmth.
The prime minister's office
offered condolences to the fami
lies, some of whom were angry
that the rescue was taking so
long.
More than half of those aboard
the bus were from this village
about 550 miles north of Tokyo
on the northern island of Hokkai
do. With a population of less than
5,000, most residents here know
one another.
Takako Watanabe's lifelong
friend, Nobuko Hattori, was on
the bus accompanying her grand
mot her to (he next town for a visit
to the doctor. She said she had
gradually lost hope her friend had
survived.
"The past few days I've cried
and cried while watching this
unfold, until I just don't have any
more tears," Watanabe said.
