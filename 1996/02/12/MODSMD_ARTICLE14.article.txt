# NW flooding tests citizens

BIRKENFELD, Ore. (AP) — Stranded for days by
bloated rivers and washed-out roads, rural Northwest
erners are finding their self-reliance tested by the
region's worst flooding in decades.
As rivers receded ever so slowly yesterday, brigades of
emergency workers fanned out to assist flood victims in
cities and suburbs. But in the Northwest's backwoods
corners, neighbor had to rely on neighbor.
Jeff and Tami Bellingham were driven from their
farmhouse last Wednesday by the flooding Nehalem
River in northwestern Oregon. They saw no rescue offi
cials until yesterday.
Left on their own, they built a hay-bale levee around
their house, rescued neighbors in a rowboat, saved 26
horses and cleared a debris-blocked highway — only to
watch fire destroy tlteir home early yesterday.
By yesterday afternoon, there were no tears.
"We passed that point a long time ago," Tami Beiiing
ham, 38, said wearily. Neither could say what might have
started the fire.
So it went throughout rural Oregon, Washington,
Idaho and Montana. The same raging waters that poured
through homes also chewed up roads and downed utility
lines, cutting off thousands of residents from the outside
world.
In the evergreen thumb of the Cascade Range that
pokes ink) Oregon's northwestern corner, winding two
lane roads often hug the banks of mountain creeks and
rivers.
Highway 202, which passes the Bellinghams' place,
crosses and recrosses the Nehalem River. Usually a
sparkling, boulder-dotted stream, it's now an ugly brown
band ripping through canyons.
Up to 200 homes along the river were destroyed or
badly damaged, one official estimated.
"It's a lot worse thiui we ever imagined," said lion
Youngbergof the St. Helens Rural Fire Department.
Near the river's mouth on the Oregon coast, Tillam
ook County dairy farmer Steve Neahring lost at least 100
of his 175 Holstein and Jersey milkers. Some drowned;
some had to be shot after getting chilled to the bone or
breaking their legs in panicky struggles in flooded barns.
As Neahring maneuvered a front-end loader to stack
muddy carcasses through the weekend, more than 20
friends and neighbors pitched in. A deli near the beach in
Manzanita donated lunches; farm wives supplied food
and thermoses of coffee.
"It's everybody helping everybody," said Laßayne
Woodward, who lives on the dairy farm across the river
from Neahring's spread. "This is when you find out what
good neighbors you have."
