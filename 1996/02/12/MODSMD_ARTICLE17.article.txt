## Note from the editor No more Daily fee 
### 
THE STANFORD DAILY has
elected not to seek an ASSU
special fee for the 1996-97
academic year.
The Daily is an independent
newspaper and independence
means the freedom to publish
without worrying about financial
backlash. The Daily is relatively
unique among college newspapers,
few of which enjoy their own inde
pendence. VVe do not have a faculty
adviser appointed by the Universi
ty nor do we have any editorial
appointments approved through
the student government as was
the case before The Daily became
independent more than 20 years
ago.
Prior to The Daily's indepen
dence, we received funding from
the ASSU Publications Board.
When we first became indepen
dent, The Daily was unable to
operate without the ASSU's finan
cial support. In fact, the special-fee
system was originally created in
part because of The Daily — as a
way to give groups the chance to
request money from students for
activities which benefited the
entire student population.
But a newspaper is unlike most
other student groups or business
es. Although we make a concerted
effort to keep editorial content and
business relationships separate,
we must be careful to avoid any
conflict of interest — real or
apparent — that might compro
mise our objectivity.
The special fee was viewed as a
temporary measure for The Daily.
In a note written to then-Universi
ty President Richard Lyman in
April 1972, then-Editor in Chief
Frank Miller wrote, "It is our ulti
mate intention that The Stanford
Daily should become financially
independent of Stanford Universi
ty, the ASSU and all other organi
zations."
As The Daily moved further
from the time when it was under
University control, it became
increasingly apparent that the spe
cial fee was an obstacle to complete
independence because it embroiled
The Dailv in the annual election

process and could have prevented
us from being impartial observers.
Each year during ASSU elec
tions, The Daily editorial board
issues recommendations on various
other student groups. Until the
mid-1980s, The Daily endorsed its
own special fee, encouraging stu
dents to vote for its approval. How
ever, boards started to realize the
problems involved with making
other endorsements while at the
same time having a vested interest
in the election's outcome.
For a while, "Neutral" was
printed next to the endorsement
for The Daily, with a statement
that any andorsement could obvi
ously not be totally objective.
Eventually, the editorial board
simply printed "No Recommenda
tion" next to the dollar amount of
the fee request, with no additional
description.
Some editors questioned the
true independence of The Daily
when it was involved in the special
fee process, but it was argued that
Stanford students were receiving
good value for their money — for
only about three cents a day, stu
dents had a newspaper delivered to
their residences with campus
news, sports, opinions and the
crossword puzzle.
We have now come to a new
crossroads. The Daily has gained
in financial strength and is able to
move forward on the promise
made when it first became inde
pendent.
Because The Daily will no
longer be involved in the special
fee process, our readers — yon —
will know that at election time
that we are not attempting to engi
neer endorsements for our own
favor. When covering the ASSU,
we will not withhold information
because it will benefit or hurt
funding from our student govern
ment.
The Daily is firmly committed
to being a source of objective and
unbiased news for the entire Stan
ford community. That we will not
request a special fee is a demon
stration of that commitment.
