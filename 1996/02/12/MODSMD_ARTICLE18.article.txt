Muslim group upset by cartoon printed by The Daily

ON BEHALF OF the Muslim com
munity at Stanford, we would
like to call to The Daily's atten
tion the cartoon that was negligently
pasted to Wednesday's opinions page.
While we do not suspect that the inten
tion behind the publication of such a
simple-minded caricature was a mali
cious one, we are dismayed by the
absence of mind displayed in deciding to
debase an entire faith based upon the
limited actions of three quite unscrupu
lous characters.
Sani Abacha, Moammar Khadafi and
Louis Farrakhan do share, regrettably,
we might add, a common thread: They
claim to be Muslims. More regrettably,

in publishing the visual masterpiece of
Mr. Benson (the cartoonist), The Daily
has made the bold decision to depict a
faith that is founded on honesty, humili
ty and respect for others with these
three scoundrels. It is therefore with
deep regret that we are writing this let
ter as our heretofore unbending faith in
The Daily's evenhandedness and objec
tivity has been . . . well, bent.
If The Daily decides to publish some
thing like this hilarious cartoon in the
future, which it is, of course, free to do,
we ask that it at least take a moment to
think about the possibility of publishing
an equivalent Christian Madman March
with Nicolae Ceausescu, Radovan

Karadzic and Vladimir Zhirinovsky at
the helm, each holding a copy of "St.
Patrick's IRA Urban Terrorism Hand
book," or perhaps a Jewish Madman
March with Yigal Amir, Baruch Gold
stein and Meir Kahane blazing ahead, a
copy of "Yahweh's How to Build a Better
Bagel Bomb" tucked neatly up their
shirt sleeves. (Funny, isn't it?) We kind
ly ask that The Daily not ever publish
any of these.
Rather, if The Daily wants to be
funny, how about a picture of Jacques
Cousteau, Hakeem Olajuwon and Cat
Stevens (all Muslims) walking arm-in
arm? Wouldn't it be a riot to see
Cousteau salvaging a 400-year-old ship

wreck from the ocean floor, Hakeem
dunking over Shaq or Stevens lecturing
a group of Oxford women about the
mass rape and genocide of Muslims in
the Balkans? This is funny stuff. The
next time The Daily decides to slam a
faith for the very limited actions of an
unrepresentative minority, it should
think about how hilarious it would be
for the Muslims in Bosnia to see their
faith so fairly represented by that trio of
hoodlums.
