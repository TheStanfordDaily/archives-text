# Cartoon perpetuates stereotypical images
## 
### 
I was deeply offended by the political
cartoon, "Muslim Madman March"
which The Daily printed Wednesday.
Not only does it perpetuate false stereo
types about Islam and Muslims, it also
reveals the media's ignorance of and
prejudice against Islam, especially
because it was printed during the Mus
lim holy month of Ramadan, as well as
Black History Month.
The most striking misrepresentation
of the cartoon is that it portrays Islam
as a religion of terrorism, when in reali
ty, Islam is a religion of peace. In the
cartoon, Khadafi is portrayed holding a
book entitled "Allah's Almanac of Ter
ror Tidbits," implying that terrorism
stems directly from a belief in Allah's
message. In truth, Allah (which is sim
ply the Arabic word for God) sent the
Koran to mankind to provide guidance,
and in it, He reminds people never to bt
the aggressors and to always be just.
Indeed, Muslims always greet each
other with "Assalaamu 'Alaikum"
which means "May peace be unto you,"

and the Koran teaches that "Whenever
[your enemies] lean towards peace, then
you should also, and place your trust in
Allah."
Unfortunately, many political charac
ters who claim to be Muslim commit
terrorist acts and human rights viola
tions. However, these people are not
representative of Islam, and should not
be portrayed as such. For example,
would David Koresh ever be portrayed
as a representative of all of Christiani
ty? I feel no loyalty toward the particu
lar characters portrayed in the cartoon,
and have no problem with a cartoon
that mocks their actions; what offends
me is that these figures were depicted as
representatives of the religion as a
whole.
It is unfortunate that The Daily chose
this particular cartoon to depict Islam. It
is sad that in an environment that pro
motes tolerance, such a bigoted cartoon
gets published. Indeed, it is ironic that
Farrakhan holds a book entitled "Bigots
Book of Racial Rhymes;" the cartoon is a
representation of the same bigotry that
it purports to condemn. Had it been any
other religion or ethnic group that was
being slandered; the cartoon would have
immediately been cast aside as racist.

yet because Muslims are routinely vili
fied by the media, such a cartoon can get
published.
I am extremely disappointed in The
Daily's decision to print this cartoon. As
the most widely read newspaper at one
of the nation's top universities, it has a
responsibility to its readership to dispel
misinformation rather than to perpetu
ate it. In publishing the cartoon, The
Daily failed miserably in this responsibil
ity.
