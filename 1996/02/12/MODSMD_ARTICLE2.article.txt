# Cardinal upsets No. 17 UCLA, 67-66
## Miracle at Maples Stanford holds on in final minutes 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Usually, Brevin Knight is
known for his ability to make bas
kets. On Saturday afternoon,
however, it was a missed shot by
the junior point guard that turned
out to be the most important play
of the game.
Taking a quick three-pointer
with the shot clock running down
and the game clock under 15 sec
onds, Knight's shot was short but
bounced long off the iron, allow
ing him to chase it down in the
corner.
After calling a time-out to get
out of trouble, Knight dribbled
out the final 12 seconds as the No.
25 Cardinal snapped a 10-game
losing streak to No. 17 UCLA with
a 67-66 win at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford (15-5 overall, 8-3 Pa
cific 10 Conference) watched the
Bruins Cl 6-6, 9-2) cut a seven
poinf «t » ;;it to one over the final
on< minute, 54 seconds but held

on thanks to Knight's heads-up
play.
"I knew it was short," Knight
said of his errant shot. "Some
times the ball bounces your way. I
thought [J.R.] Henderson was
going to get it, but it went over
him.
"They left me open for
jumpers," he said. "Our coaches
just told me, 'If you are open,
shoot it.' They were going behind
the screens, so that shot is wide
open every time."
Knight led Stanford with 19
points and nine assists, hitting six
of 11 shots in the second half.
Down 53-44 with 13:09 left in
the second half, UCLA did what
has probably kept head coach
Mike Montgomery awake at night
over the past year — they
switched into their stifling 2-3
zone defense. Visions of last year's
second-half collapse against the
Bruins loomed like the ghost that
has seemed to plague Stanford-
UCLA games over the past three
years.
However, unlike last year,
when the Cardinal scored only 11
points in the final 7:20, Stanford
kept its poise on Saturday despite
missing 10 of 11 shots in an eight
minute stretch. The Bruins cut
the Cardinal's lead from nine to
one before Knight took over.
Hitting a wide-open 19-footer
and another jump shot before the
zone had a chance to set itself,
Knight attacked the UCLA
defense rather than staying pas
sive. A transition bucket by Andy
Poppink pushed the lead back to
seven at 64-57 with 3:33 to play
and the Bruins went back to man
to-man.
"The big difference was that
we were able to get one or two
spurts," Poppink said. "Last year
we weren't able to get consecutive
baskets."
For the first seven minutes of
the game, it looked as if the Car
dinal had spent all of its offensive
energy in its 99-69 win over USC
Thursday night. The Bruins
roared out to a 15-2 lead thanks
to six consecutive baskets.
But Stanford fought back into
the game, outscoring 29-17
the rest of the first half and enter
ing the locker room down only 32-
31 at halftime. Two three-pointers
by freshman Kris Weems and
three dunks by freshman Mark
Seaton filled the offensive void as
Poppink and Dion Cross combined
for only two first-half points.
The second half opened with
both teams scorching the nets.
UCLA made five straight baskets,
but the Cardinal stayed close by
converting second-chance points.
Amazingly, Stanford outrebound
ed the Bruins 32-30, 14-7 on the
offensive glass.

With the score tied at 42-42
four minutes into the second half,
the first of two momentum-shift
ing calls by the officials came
after a scramble for a loose ball.
Knight thought he had a steal but
in the jumble of elbows and knees
in front of the scorer's table, the
ball was forced out of bounds —
possession UCLA.
As it was the first deadball
after the 16-minute mark, the
scorer signaled for a television
time-out. Stanford reacted by
clustering around halfcourt, wait
ing for the referee's acknowledg
ment, but instead the official
handed the ball to UCLA, which
inbounded and scored easily.
After much deliberation
between the three officials, refer
ee Bob Garibaldi then waved off
the basket, much to Mont
gomery's pleasure.
"I thought that the bull-roping
prior to that should have been
called," he said, referring to the
collision between Knight and
Toby Bailey fighting for the loose
ball. "But they took the basket
away, and it was the right call."
Instead of the easy hoop, the
Bruins ended up turning the ball
over on a three-second violation.
A free throw by Poppink then
gave Stanford the lead for good.
The second game-changing call
came two minutes later with the
Cardinal ahead 49-44. Darren All
away fouled Henderson down low
before the shot, but Henderson put
it up anyway, making an off-bal
ance hook shot which the officials
then waved off. Harrick protested
the call and drew a technical foul.
So, instead of the Bruins
potentially cutting it to three on a
converted foul shot, Cross sank
the two technical free throws and
Knight hit a 19-footer as Stanford
gained possession after the tech
nical, pushing the Cardinal lead
to nine.

At the outset of Saturday
afternoon's Pacific 10 Conference
showdown between the 25th
ranked Stanford men's basketball
team and No. 17 UCLA, it
appeared as if it would be the
same old story: The scrappy Pac
-10 upstart Cardinal, playing good
basketball and seemingly ready
for the perennial powerhouse
Bruins, would come out fiat, fight
an uphill battle, come close, then
fall apart.
Such was the case last season
and in Stanford's earlier loss this
year to the defending national
champions. No member of this
year's Cardinal squad had beaten
UCLA. That changed in Satur
day's 67-66 Stanford victory. This
time, it was different.
"The kids really wanted it,"
said Cardinal head coach Mike
Montgomery. "Our seniors had
never beaten them, and I think
it's tremendous for them to get
this win against UCLA."
Montgomery's seniors couldn't
agree more. "It feels great [to
win]," said Stanford senior for
ward Andy Poppink. "It really
does. We've been close a couple
times, but to finally get one is
great. That's something to hold
on to."
Things didn't appear that way
at first, however, as the Bruins
bolted out to an early 15-2 lead,
with the Cardinal as cold from
the field as UCIiA was hot. Even
when the Cardinal climbed to
within one point by the half,
down 32-31, there was that sink
ing feeling that Stanford was
destined to be a hardwood Sisy
phus, always pushing that rock
closer and closer to the top but
ultimately, always having the

weight come crashing down upon
it.
The Cardinal led by as many as
10 midway through the second
half, only to have that margin cut
to one with just over five minutes
left to play. Even after Stanford
boosted the lead to 66-59 with less
than two minutes to play, UCLA
came storming back, shearing the
lead to one with 46 ticks on the
clock. It was in those last few
minutes and seconds that the
Cardinal proved its character in
defeating the Bruins. There
would be no falling apart this
time.
With 1:54 left in the game and
Stanford up 64-59, Cardinal
junior point guard Brevin Knight
came off a screen and knocked
down an 18-foot jump shot that
seemingly iced the game. Even
when UCLA sophomore Toby
Bailey made two free throws to
cut the lead to five, senior for
ward Andy Poppink responded by
converting one of two free throws,
making it at least a two-posses
sion game. The Cardinal seniors
would finally win their first game
against UCLA — or would they?
After Poppink's free throws,
the Bruins worked the ball down
court in a hurry. Bailey dished the
ball to freshman center Jelani
McCoy for an easy dunk in just 12
seconds. Of course, Stanford still
held a 67-63 lead with 1:23 to go.
If the Cardinal could just protect
the ball, find a good shot and run
down the clock, things would be
fine. But that's a big "if," espe
cially against the tenacious, ath
letic UCLA defense.
On Stanford's next possession,
Knight ran down the shot clock
perfectly, but with the seconds
winding down, he lost the ball to


Matt Garlinghouso — Daily
Forward David Harbour muscles his way to the hoop through
UCLA's Toby Bailey.
Bruin junior forward Charles
O'Bannon, who relayed it down
court to sophomore forward J.R.
Henderson for the easy lay-up. To
make matters worse for Stanford,
forward David Harbour was whis
tled for a foul while hustling down
court and trying to snare the ball
out of Henderson's hands. Hender
son canned the free throw, and
what once was a sure thing no
longer was.
"At the end of the game, we
didn't manage things quite as well
as we would have liked," Mont
gomery said. "We got up seven, but
the key turnover was the turnover
to the three-point play which was
the one thing that we could not
afTord to have happen. Even if you
turn it over and don't give up the
bucket at the other end or [force
them to take time off the clock! —
but the worst thing that could pos
sibly happen did."
With 46 seconds left to play and

Stanford leading 67-66, there was
no doubt that this game was going
to be a nail-biter. Once again Knight
worked the shot clock down, but
with time running out, he was
forced to take a less-than-ideal base
line jumper that came up short.

'Our seniors had
never beaten them.
I think it's tremen
dous for them to get
this win over UCLA
— Mike Montgomery

Fortunately for the Cardinal, the
carom came right back to Knight in
the corner. With nowhere to go, the
junior superguard, who finished
with 19 points and nine assists, was
forced to call a time-out.
But there was still a game to
played. With 12 seconds left and
Stanford holding on for dear life,
UCLA still had a chance. The
inbounds pass went to Stanford

senior guard Dion Cross, who threw
it to Knight under pressure. Hen
derson came at Knight hard, slap
ping the ball — along with Knight's
arm — away.
"I don't think [Henderson] could
have slapped me any harder for it to
be a foul," Knight said. "I guess it
was a little bit too loud [in the
stands] for the people on the court
to hear. But sometimes that hap
pens. You can't worry about the
foul, and you have to continue to
play."
With the loose ball on the floor,
the Bruins, instead of picking it up,
all raced downcourt, apparently
hoping to receive a downcourt pass.
Amidst the chaos, confusion and
players running helter skelter,
Knight retrieved the errant ball and
tossed it cross-court to senior for
ward Darren Allaway to run down
the clock, securing the Cardinal's
first triumph over its downstate
rivals in eleven games.
"For some reason, the ball was
out there, but everyone was run
ning away from it," Knight said. "I
just stuck with it, passed it to [All
away], And that was it."
