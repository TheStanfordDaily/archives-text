# Headlines overplayed honor code violations
## 
### 
Two days in a row, reasonable Daily
reporting has been marred by tabloid
Daily headline writing.
On Wednesday, the lead headline
gasped "Honor Code violations jump:
Stanford sees 62 percent increase from
last academic year." Well, yes, an
increase from 26 to 43 is a rather large
percentage (actually, 65 percent) but the

base is so small as to deprive it of much
statistical significance. The Daily's read
ers might have been better informed by
a headline of "Honor Code violations
rise by 17" â€” less sensational but more
precise.
Thursday, the headline writers fol
lowed with "Cheating data not worri
some: No need to panic, Casper says." I
am hardly as cavalier about Honor Code
violations as that would suggest. As I
told the reporter, I obviously would like
the number to be lower; still 43 is not an
epidemic (it equals three-tenths of 1 per
cent of students). And, as stated above,
the percentage increase should not be
overplayed because of the very small
number.
For the record, allow me to add one
thing to the reporter's accurate state
ment that my call for reform of the judi
cial system was not related to the statis
tics. I failed to mention to him that
there could not have been a connection
between the two because I issued my call
for reform well before I knew the statis
tics. I first saw the figures when all The
Daily's readers did, in the Wednesday
morning papers.
