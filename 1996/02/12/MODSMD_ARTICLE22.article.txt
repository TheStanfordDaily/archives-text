## Car 54, where are you?

AN ARTICLE IN The Daily a few
weeks ago caught my attention.
Actually, the absurdity of the
article caught my attention. It was lit
tle more than a very contrived attempt
to answer a question many of us have
posed at least once: What the hell do
Stanford cops legitimately do?
I've wondered this so many times,
and have heard the same issue brought
forth by others so often, that Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer at some point must
surely have gotten wind of this discon
tent. Friends from other schools who
have visited Stanford have been amazed
at the presence our police force has on
campus. One who arrived just after the
art museum break-in last year was
shockod at the way the perpetrators
were treated like hard-core criminals.
"It was a prank," he screamed. Yet, all
were initially charged with burglary.
Until a judge saw the case and sided
with my friend.
With this in mind, I skeptically read
the article in the Jan. 30 paper. I pic
tured Niemeyer awake in bed one
night, scheming ways to repair his
force's tarnished image, finally decid
ing that a Daily article would do the
trick.
The headline read "Stanford Police
help other police departments." Cer
tainly not as bad-ass as Niemeyer had
hoped, but still subtly effective. In the
article he was quoted as saying in his
best NYPI) Blue lingo, "If something

heavy is going down, we help out." (I
copy this directly.) The piece then high
lighted three recent instances in which
our cops gave "assistance" to other
local forces. In two of the cases, Stan
ford officers were used to "establish a
perimeter" around escaping criminals.
Of course, lest you think too much of
Niemeyer's troops, the captain himself
was forced to concede that in both cases
the felons escaped.
("Uh . . . Yeah, Stanford. Thanks for
your help.")
Niemeyer did his best to liven up the
third incident as well. "Shortly after
midnight at The Edge, a humongous
gang fight was going on. We were basi
cally sent in as field support."
Humongous, eh? So, you guys went
in and kicked some ass? The Edge,
that's a rough part of town. Riot gear?
"We did not make any arrests," he
began to admit, until he apparently
realized he was hurting his cause, and
thus added almost apologetically,
"although several arrests were made by
Palo Alto police."
Well, thank God, somebody did
something. As I see it, we went 0 for 3.
The Stanford Police must have
duties essential to our daily lives — and
I thank them heartily for their work —
but as students, we usually see those
actions which aren't so essential. In
fact, more often than not, they are
downright laughable. How many times
have you watched a biker run a stop

sign only to be nabbed by an officer hid
ing in the bushes 20 yards down the
road? (A hint: Keep riding; what can
the officer do?) How many times have
you received a parking ticket at 2 a.m.?
How many times have you been hassled
coming home from a party?
A lawyer in San Jose told me last
year that a huge percentage of charges
filed by the Stanford Police are immedi
ately thrown out of the courts. She
explained that many of the complaints
are so petty that convictions would be
impossible and that our police force is
viewed by her colleagues as essentially
having way too much time on its hands.
No shock there. Normally, the Stan
ford Police are little more than a source
of humor, posturing with their guns
and radios, pretending to do something
of significance. It seems harmless, real
ly — except when you become the object
of their little game. I spent over more
than $1,000 in lawyer's fees, protecting
myself from charges that were immedi
ately thrown out by a judge. He
laughed, but I still had to write the
check. Next time, I'm sending Capt.
Niemeyer the bill.
