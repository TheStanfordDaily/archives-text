## She started at Stanford: a sibling's sexcapades 
### 
MENARCHE I COULD handle. It
was a welcome end to her 13-year
bout of PMS and, besides, it's to be
expected in a younger sister. It's a natural
occurrence, a rite of passage, an eewy sign
that she is coming of age.
But random scams I was never pre
pared for. And who'd have thunk it'd be
my fault?
Here's what happened:
The fam was here over the weekend.
The tribe of five — two parents (still mar
ried), the older brother (employed) and
the younger sister (six months shy of her
learner's permit) — convened in Palo
Alto for the annual Let's make Mi key
miserable visit to Stanford. Sculpture
garden, Monterey, II Fornio, Tresidder
LaIR .. . we've done the drill before.
Only this time there was a new variable
in the equation. My little sister — the fam
ily's baby who within the last 10 months
of her adolescence has manifested a manic
craze for the male sex — had an agenda.
Only I didn't know this.
Now, no one with a working pair of
eyes could fail to appreciate the care
puberty had taken to turn her child's
chassis into that of a short, busty little
cartoon vixen's — scarcely five feet and
already crackin' a C cup, my dispropor
tioned baby sister has the gawky guy pop
ulation of her high school sprinting to the

bathroom stalls every time she jogs by.
But I never thought to think that she
was so aware of the transformation.
So when the little couch potato asked
me if she could tag along and hang with
my friends on a Saturday night at Stan
ford I had no reason to think she wanted
to do anything but sample the wonders of
winter quarter college life.
So when I brought her along to a small
party full of friends, I didn't think she'd
be anything more than a giggly showpiece
with a retainer, great hair and a capacity
to converse about current 90210 plotlines
with anyone who happens to still bother
with the show.
So when she told me during Sunday
brunch about how she'd hooked up with
a goateed Cowell Cluster buddy of mine
during the half-hour I couldn't account
for her whereabouts that night, well . . .
let's just say Denny's dear Ova got her
sleeves rather messy from plucking my
eyes out of the pancake batter — them
being shot out of my head and all.
Yup. That's right. Our darling
princess got what she wanted. Went in
with a mission and came out with her
stripes. Passed her 15-year-old-with
good-skin self off as a freshman at Bran
deis and took the uninformed fool for a
kid-sized ride. Targeted the cutest one
who hadn't heard how old she was(n't)

and enjoyed her first statutory scam.
Yup. The flirting I thought pointless
got her goodies grabbed.
Needless to say, I flipped.
After all, what business does my little
sister have having a libido? And even if
she does, what business does the little
Cabbage-Patch have exploring it?
With one of my friends, no less.
When I asked her, "What the hell were
you thinking?" she was surprisingly calm
about it.
"I decided about two months ago that
it was time for me to hook up for the first
time already."
"But here?"
"What, I'm supposed to let some high
school freshman spend 20 minutes trying
to unhook my front-snap and fondle me
all wet and sloppy?"
"What, am I supposed to let some
sophomoric psych major do the same?"
"But think of the stories I've got now.
How cool am I gonna be back in school? I
hooked up with a college guy! I'm like
Kelly in the last high school season. And
besides, he was cute."
So I'm sitting there, twitching, trying
to undo what'd happened by arguing.
"Why did you leave the party?"
"I didn't think you'd want to watch. If
you want I could call him, maybe he's
free for an afternoon showing."

"Don't be bitchy."
"Why not, I'm old enough to menstru
ate."
"But why all of a sudden do you have
to hook up?"
"Mikey, please, I'm 15 and I've got
boobs bigger than your cranium — why
shouldn't I?"
I couldn't believe what I was hearing.
My baby sister. Where does she get off
using logic? And since when is pragma
tism so readily available to the high
schooler with proto-lascivious designs?
Granted I was being a touch unfair
and irrational (and let's not forget hypo
critical — my brother and I have shared
our mackscapades since the night he
gagged on his first french kiss), but this
was difficult to deal with. And there's
very little formal guidance to be found on
the matter. Freud spent all that time on
the mother-son relationship — if only I'd
walked in on my parents.
But this is about my little sister. Seven
years behind but always the baby. My
lone connection to the Spielbergian child
world of innocence and naivete. And no
matter how far I strayed from that realm
I could look at her childish mien and I
could say, "Look, this is my sister — of
course I'm still young."
My sister: She was the barometer of
my own youth . . . then she grew breasts.

And now she's using 'em.
Beguiling my friends into triumphant
trists; hoodwinking them into illegal
interactions (somewhere in ZAP, a guy in
a goatee — one of some 50 — who only
this morning boasted to his roommate
about how he'd hooked up this weekend
is now scouring the campus for a com
fortable place to hide from the police).
So now I wonder: What am I supposed
to do? What attitude to adopt? Should I
simply accept that the littlest Green will
some day be among the "knowing"? Or
can 1 hold fast to her innocence because I
have so scant a connection to my own?
What's the pro-social, pony-tailed
male response here? Am I supposed to
cheer her on? High-five and buy her a
Heineken? Tell her maybe she should
consider exploring bisexuality next? Or
maybe two guys? Buy her a tube 'o lube
and a bottle of ginseng?
The truth is I don't know just yet. All
this blossoming stuff is going to take
some gett ing used to.
But at least for now my baby sister
remains a neophyte in nook. And we can
expect she'll remain that way for sometime.
Her intention, she tells me, is to go slow.
That is, unless I invite her to another
party.

to hook up?"
"Mikey, please, I'm 15 and I've got
boobs bigger than your cranium — why
shouldn't I?"
I couldn't believe what I was hearing.
My baby sister. Where does she get off
using logic? And since when is pragma
tism so readily available to the high
schooler with proto-lascivious designs?
Granted I was being a touch unfair
and irrational (and let's not forget hypo
critical — my brother and I have shared
our mackscapades since the night he
gagged on his first french kiss), but this
was difficult to deal with. And there's
very little formal guidance to be found on
the matter. Freud spent all that time on
the mother-son relationship — if only I'd
walked in on my parents.
But this is about my little sister. Seven
years behind but always the baby. My
lone connection to the Spielbergian child
world of innocence and naivete. And no
matter how far I strayed from that realm
I could look at her childish mien and I
could say, "Look, this is my sister — of
course I'm still young."
My sister: She was the barometer of
my own youth . . . then she grew breasts.

And now she's using 'em.
Beguiling my friends into triumphant
trists; hoodwinking them into illegal
interactions (somewhere in ZAP, a guy in
a goatee — one of some 50 — who only
this morning boasted to his roommate
about how he'd hooked up this weekend
is now scouring the campus for a com
fortable place to hide from the police).
So now I wonder: What am I supposed
to do? What attitude to adopt? Should I
simply accept that the littlest Green will
some day be among the "knowing"? Or
can 1 hold fast to her innocence because I
have so scant a connection to my own?
What's the pro-social, pony-tailed
male response here? Am I supposed to
cheer her on? High-five and buy her a
Heineken? Tell her maybe she should
consider exploring bisexuality next? Or
maybe two guys? Buy her a tube 'o lube
and a bottle of ginseng?
The truth is I don't know just yet. All
this blossoming stuff is going to take
some gett ing used to.
But at least for now my baby sister
remains a neophyte in nook. And we can
expect she'll remain that way for sometime.
Her intention, she tells me, is to go slow.
That is, unless I invite her to another
party.

MENARCHE I COULD handle. It
was a welcome end to her 13-year
bout of PMS and, besides, it's to be
expected in a younger sister. It's a natural
occurrence, a rite of passage, an eewy sign
that she is coming of age.
But random scams I was never pre
pared for. And who'd have thunk it'd be
my fault?
Here's what happened:
The fam was here over the weekend.
The tribe of five — two parents (still mar
ried), the older brother (employed) and
the younger sister (six months shy of her
learner's permit) — convened in Palo
Alto for the annual Let's make Mi key
miserable visit to Stanford. Sculpture
garden, Monterey, II Fornio, Tresidder
LaIR .. . we've done the drill before.
Only this time there was a new variable
in the equation. My little sister — the fam
ily's baby who within the last 10 months
of her adolescence has manifested a manic
craze for the male sex — had an agenda.
Only I didn't know this.
Now, no one with a working pair of
eyes could fail to appreciate the care
puberty had taken to turn her child's
chassis into that of a short, busty little
cartoon vixen's — scarcely five feet and
already crackin' a C cup, my dispropor
tioned baby sister has the gawky guy pop
ulation of her high school sprinting to the

bathroom stalls every time she jogs by.
But I never thought to think that she
was so aware of the transformation.
So when the little couch potato asked
me if she could tag along and hang with
my friends on a Saturday night at Stan
ford I had no reason to think she wanted
to do anything but sample the wonders of
winter quarter college life.
So when I brought her along to a small
party full of friends, I didn't think she'd
be anything more than a giggly showpiece
with a retainer, great hair and a capacity
to converse about current 90210 plotlines
with anyone who happens to still bother
with the show.
So when she told me during Sunday
brunch about how she'd hooked up with
a goateed Cowell Cluster buddy of mine
during the half-hour I couldn't account
for her whereabouts that night, well . . .
let's just say Denny's dear Ova got her
sleeves rather messy from plucking my
eyes out of the pancake batter — them
being shot out of my head and all.
Yup. That's right. Our darling
princess got what she wanted. Went in
with a mission and came out with her
stripes. Passed her 15-year-old-with
good-skin self off as a freshman at Bran
deis and took the uninformed fool for a
kid-sized ride. Targeted the cutest one
who hadn't heard how old she was(n't)

and enjoyed her first statutory scam.
Yup. The flirting I thought pointless
got her goodies grabbed.
Needless to say, I flipped.
After all, what business does my little
sister have having a libido? And even if
she does, what business does the little
Cabbage-Patch have exploring it?
With one of my friends, no less.
When I asked her, "What the hell were
you thinking?" she was surprisingly calm
about it.
"I decided about two months ago that
it was time for me to hook up for the first
time already."
"But here?"
"What, I'm supposed to let some high
school freshman spend 20 minutes trying
to unhook my front-snap and fondle me
all wet and sloppy?"
"What, am I supposed to let some
sophomoric psych major do the same?"
"But think of the stories I've got now.
How cool am I gonna be back in school? I
hooked up with a college guy! I'm like
Kelly in the last high school season. And
besides, he was cute."
So I'm sitting there, twitching, trying
to undo what'd happened by arguing.
"Why did you leave the party?"
"I didn't think you'd want to watch. If
you want I could call him, maybe he's
free for an afternoon showing."

"Don't be bitchy."
"Why not, I'm old enough to menstru
ate."
"But why all of a sudden do you have
to hook up?"
"Mikey, please, I'm 15 and I've got
boobs bigger than your cranium — why
shouldn't I?"
I couldn't believe what I was hearing.
