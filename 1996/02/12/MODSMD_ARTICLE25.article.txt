What appeared to be develop
ing into a disastrous weekend
turned into an awesome display
of intense and exciting volleyball
for the No. 5 Stanford men's vol
leyball team Saturday night.
After being swept by third
ranked Long Beach State 15-5,
15-11,17-15 on Friday, the Cardi
nal bounced back on Saturday to
knock off No. 8 USC in five games
and salvage a weekend split. Tak
ing a cue from the Miracle at
Maples earlier in the day, Stan
ford rallied from a two-game
deficit to win the final three

frames 15-4, 15-13, 15-10. The
weekend split puts Stanford (5-1
overall, 4-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) one-half game
behind 3-0 Long Beach (6-0 over
all) in the Pacific Division of the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion.
"It would have been depress
ing to have been swept here this
weekend," said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves. "I really
liked our fighting spirit and uni
fied team effort."
