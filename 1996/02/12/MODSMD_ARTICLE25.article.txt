What appeared to be develop
ing into a disastrous weekend
turned into an awesome display
of intense and exciting volleyball
for the No. 5 Stanford men's vol
leyball team Saturday night.
After being swept by third
ranked Long Beach State 15-5,
15-11,17-15 on Friday, the Cardi
nal bounced back on Saturday to
knock off No. 8 USC in five games
and salvage a weekend split. Tak
ing a cue from the Miracle at
Maples earlier in the day, Stan
ford rallied from a two-game
deficit to win the final three

frames 15-4, 15-13, 15-10. The
weekend split puts Stanford (5-1
overall, 4-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) one-half game
behind 3-0 Long Beach (6-0 over
all) in the Pacific Division of the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion.
"It would have been depress
ing to have been swept here this
weekend," said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves. "I really
liked our fighting spirit and uni
fied team effort."

blockers.
Jans start to wither under the con
stant onslaught of the Cardinal
spikers. With no relief in sight
from their bench, many of the USC
players played the entire game.
When Garcia and Whitehurst
teamed up on a block for an 8-4
lead, it looked like another run
away. Blocks by Moore and Fuer
bringer and a kill by sophomore
swing hitter Devin Poolman
stretched the lead to 13-8. But the
Trojans rallied, closing to within a
point before Moore and Fuer
bringer doused any notions of a
win with a rousing block that
brought the crowd to its feet.
The quick-rally fifth game
brought the match its most intense
action, with Garcia going on the
floor for one of his 18 digs, Pool
man providing clutch play, and
Whitehurst stuffing yet another
futile Trojan attempt while Chong
and Moore worked the set-and-kill
routine to perfection. Not to be
outdone, USC tied the game up five
times. However, this being their
third five-game match in a week,
the physical burden was telling.
"They were pretty much a six
player team and that probably
worked against them," Nieves said.
With the Cardinal one point
away from victory at 14-10, Fuer
bringer did the honors with a pow
erful kill that deflected off of a USC
blocker and out of bounds. The
whole team embraced on the court,
displaying the unified team effort
Nieves alluded to.
"As the match went on, their
jump serves didn't have as much
steam," he said. "We also had a lot
of clutch performances. Devin was
clutch in game five. Garcia toughed
it out pretty well and Mike Hoefer
bounced back nicely. Brian Moore
had another really strong match."
Friday night, the setting at
Burnham Pavilion was perfect for
the team's league home opener, as
a large, rambunctious crowd came
out to see the battle of top-five
unbeatens. But like most hyped
events, there was an obvious let
down. Unfortunately, it was the
Cardinal spikers who suffered it.
Long Beach opposite hitter Tom
Hoflf got his team going early with
a couple of stuffs to give the 49ers a
4-1 lead. The Player of the Year
candidate continued to give Stan
ford's middle blockers fits with his
blocks as the Cardinal fell behind
9-3. A kill by Matt Fuerbringer
brought the score to 9-5, but that
was the end of the Stanford scor
ing. Long Beach setter Steve Walk
er put an exclamation point on the

game with a kill of his own to give
the 49ers a one-game lead.
"It was a really poor start,"
Nieves said. "But we found a way
to get ourselves going."
Poor passing set the tone at the
start of game two as Stanford fell
behind 5-2. The Cardinal rallied
back, but with the score deadlocked
at 11, Long Beach senior middle
blocker Neil Mendel put the 49ers
ahead for good. Stanford ended the
game on a bizarre note, hitting the
antenna on the side of the net, giv
ing Long Beach match point.
With some of the spectators
fleeing for the exits, Stanford could
have easily packed it in."I like the
way we competed and battled [in
the third gamel," Nieves said. "We
had a chance to give up and we
didn't."
Riding on their middle blocker
stuffs, the Cardinal spikers got out
to a quick 9-5 lead in the third
game. Long Beach continued to
chip away at the deficit. Two
straight Stanford passes sailed out
of bounds and Long Beach sudden
ly led 12-11. Moments later, Stan
ford's Moore found net on an
attempted kill, putting Long Beach
one point away from the clean
sweep.
Stanford freshman swing hitter
Josh Palacios then registered a kill
and two straight Long Beach plays
went out of bounds, pitting the two
teams in a 14-14 deadlock. After
another ball went out on the 49ers,
Stanford suddenly found itself a
point away from the win.
Unfortunately, Ixmg Beach had
o'her ideas. After Mendel came up
with a monster block to forge a IS
IS tie, Moore forced a kill out of
bounds, giving the 49ers a 16-15
advantage. On the ensuing match
point, Palacios came up to meet the
ball squarely, only to have it take a
bad bounce and go behind him, giv
ing Beach the 17-15 win.
"There were definitely some
things to be pleased about," Nieves
said. "The play of Brian Moore (24
kills) kept us in the match. I liked
the way Matt Fuerbringer bounced
back (22 kills). His hitting got bet
ter and his passing got better as the
match went along."
For the weekend, Moore aver
aged 24 kills on 82 total attempts
while Fuerbringer racked up 43
kills. Chong came through on his
serving, committing only five ser
vice errors all weekend while aver
aging seven digs per match. Garcia
not only had 18 digs against the
Trojans, he also accumulated 15
kills in 2(5 attempts.

couldn't possibly strike three
times. On Tuesday, they blew a
two-game lead to Long Beach and
lost in five. On Friday night, they
held a two games-to-one lead over
Pacific, only to see that slip away as
well. With Stanford still smarting
from Friday night's defeat, this
seemed a perfect ch.mce for USC to
exorcise some demons.
For almost two games, the two
squads played their roles perfectly.
USC rim off to a 10-3 lead in game
one and cruised to a 15-5 victory.
In game two, twin towers Brian
Moore and Matt Fuerbringer pro
vided an early spark for Stanford
with three consecutive stuffs that
gave the Cardinal a 3-1 advantage.
An errant pass by USC stretched
the lead to 4-1, but just when
things started to look good for
Stanford, the Trojans ran off a
string of points that put them up 6-
4. That's when Nieves decided he
had seen enough and called his
team to the bench in a pivotal
moment of the match.
"I told them, 'you guys either
have to get mentally tough and
handle their jump serve, or we're
going to be out of here real fast,"'
said Nieves.
Up to that point, USC had
jump-served Nieves' team like
crazy, racking up six service aces,
five by swing hitter Russell Brock
alone. After the timeout, however,
Stanford quickly rallied behind the
hustling play of junior swing hitter
Aaron Garcia, pulling to within 13-
12 on an ace by junior setter Stew
art Chong. But that was as close as
they would get, as a Szilard Kovacs
block gave USC the game and a
comfortable two games-to-none
lead
Moore opened up serving for the
Cardinal in game three. Like Chi
nese water torture, his serving
gave the Trojans fits as they slowly
fell further and further behind. By
the time sophomore Keenan
Whitehurst struck down a kill, the
scoreboard read 7-0 in favor of the
Cardinal. After three points by
USC momentarily made it a game,
Garcia and Fuerbringer put on a
clinic in kills and aces, with one of
them playing a hand in each of the
next seven points. Moore did the
rest, putting down a thunderous
kill that iced the game and put
Stanford right back in the match.

was the end of the Stanford scor
ing. Long Beach setter Steve Walk
er put an exclamation point on the

game with a kill of his own to give
the 49ers a one-game lead.
"It was a really poor start,"
Nieves said. "But we found a way
to get ourselves going."
Poor passing set the tone at the
start of game two as Stanford fell
behind 5-2. The Cardinal rallied
back, but with the score deadlocked
at 11, Long Beach senior middle
blocker Neil Mendel put the 49ers
ahead for good. Stanford ended the
game on a bizarre note, hitting the
antenna on the side of the net, giv
ing Long Beach match point.
With some of the spectators
fleeing for the exits, Stanford could
have easily packed it in."I like the
way we competed and battled [in
the third gamel," Nieves said. "We
had a chance to give up and we
didn't."
Riding on their middle blocker
stuffs, the Cardinal spikers got out
to a quick 9-5 lead in the third
game. Long Beach continued to
chip away at the deficit. Two
straight Stanford passes sailed out
of bounds and Long Beach sudden
ly led 12-11. Moments later, Stan
ford's Moore found net on an
attempted kill, putting Long Beach
one point away from the clean
sweep.
Stanford freshman swing hitter
Josh Palacios then registered a kill
and two straight Long Beach plays
went out of bounds, pitting the two
teams in a 14-14 deadlock. After
another ball went out on the 49ers,
Stanford suddenly found itself a
point away from the win.
Unfortunately, Ixmg Beach had
o'her ideas. After Mendel came up
with a monster block to forge a IS
IS tie, Moore forced a kill out of
bounds, giving the 49ers a 16-15
advantage. On the ensuing match
point, Palacios came up to meet the
ball squarely, only to have it take a
bad bounce and go behind him, giv
ing Beach the 17-15 win.
"There were definitely some
things to be pleased about," Nieves
said. "The play of Brian Moore (24
kills) kept us in the match. I liked
the way Matt Fuerbringer bounced
back (22 kills). His hitting got bet
ter and his passing got better as the
match went along."
For the weekend, Moore aver
aged 24 kills on 82 total attempts
while Fuerbringer racked up 43
kills. Chong came through on his
serving, committing only five ser
vice errors all weekend while aver
aging seven digs per match. Garcia
not only had 18 digs against the
Trojans, he also accumulated 15
kills in 2(5 attempts.

couldn't possibly strike three
times. On Tuesday, they blew a
two-game lead to Long Beach and
lost in five. On Friday night, they
held a two games-to-one lead over
Pacific, only to see that slip away as
well. With Stanford still smarting
from Friday night's defeat, this
seemed a perfect ch.mce for USC to
exorcise some demons.
For almost two games, the two
squads played their roles perfectly.
USC rim off to a 10-3 lead in game
one and cruised to a 15-5 victory.
In game two, twin towers Brian
Moore and Matt Fuerbringer pro
vided an early spark for Stanford
with three consecutive stuffs that
gave the Cardinal a 3-1 advantage.
An errant pass by USC stretched
the lead to 4-1, but just when
things started to look good for
Stanford, the Trojans ran off a
string of points that put them up 6-
4. That's when Nieves decided he
had seen enough and called his
team to the bench in a pivotal
moment of the match.
"I told them, 'you guys either
have to get mentally tough and
handle their jump serve, or we're
going to be out of here real fast,"'
said Nieves.
Up to that point, USC had
jump-served Nieves' team like
crazy, racking up six service aces,
five by swing hitter Russell Brock
alone. After the timeout, however,
Stanford quickly rallied behind the
hustling play of junior swing hitter
Aaron Garcia, pulling to within 13-
12 on an ace by junior setter Stew
art Chong. But that was as close as
they would get, as a Szilard Kovacs
block gave USC the game and a
comfortable two games-to-none
lead
Moore opened up serving for the
Cardinal in game three. Like Chi
nese water torture, his serving
gave the Trojans fits as they slowly
fell further and further behind. By
the time sophomore Keenan
Whitehurst struck down a kill, the
scoreboard read 7-0 in favor of the
Cardinal. After three points by
USC momentarily made it a game,
Garcia and Fuerbringer put on a
clinic in kills and aces, with one of
them playing a hand in each of the
next seven points. Moore did the
rest, putting down a thunderous
kill that iced the game and put
Stanford right back in the match.

What appeared to be develop
ing into a disastrous weekend
turned into an awesome display
of intense and exciting volleyball
for the No. 5 Stanford men's vol
leyball team Saturday night.
After being swept by third
ranked Long Beach State 15-5,
15-11,17-15 on Friday, the Cardi
nal bounced back on Saturday to
knock off No. 8 USC in five games
and salvage a weekend split. Tak
ing a cue from the Miracle at
Maples earlier in the day, Stan
ford rallied from a two-game
deficit to win the final three

frames 15-4, 15-13, 15-10. The
weekend split puts Stanford (5-1
overall, 4-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) one-half game
behind 3-0 Long Beach (6-0 over
all) in the Pacific Division of the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion.
"It would have been depress
ing to have been swept here this
weekend," said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves. "I really
liked our fighting spirit and uni
fied team effort."

Jans start to wither under the con

spikers. With no relief in sight
from their bench, many of the USC
players played the entire game.
When Garcia and Whitehurst
teamed up on a block for an 8-4
lead, it looked like another run
away. Blocks by Moore and Fuer
bringer and a kill by sophomore
swing hitter Devin Poolman
stretched the lead to 13-8. But the
Trojans rallied, closing to within a
point before Moore and Fuer

win with a rousing block that
brought the crowd to its feet.
The quick-rally fifth game
brought the match its most intense
action, with Garcia going on the
floor for one of his 18 digs, Pool
man providing clutch play, and
Whitehurst stuffing yet another
futile Trojan attempt while Chong
and Moore worked the set-and-kill
routine to perfection. Not to be
outdone, USC tied the game up five
times. However, this being their
third five-game match in a week,
the physical burden was telling.
"They were pretty much a six
player team and that probably
worked against them," Nieves said.
With the Cardinal one point
away from victory at 14-10, Fuer
bringer did the honors with a pow
erful kill that deflected off of a USC
blocker and out of bounds. The
whole team embraced on the court,
displaying the unified team effort
Nieves alluded to.
"As the match went on, their
jump serves didn't have as much
steam," he said. "We also had a lot
of clutch performances. Devin was
clutch in game five. Garcia toughed
it out pretty well and Mike Hoefer
bounced back nicely. Brian Moore
had another really strong match."
Friday night, the setting at
Burnham Pavilion was perfect for
the team's league home opener, as
a large, rambunctious crowd came
out to see the battle of top-five
unbeatens. But like most hyped
events, there was an obvious let
down. Unfortunately, it was the
Cardinal spikers who suffered it.
Long Beach opposite hitter Tom
Hoflf got his team going early with
a couple of stuffs to give the 49ers a
4-1 lead. The Player of the Year
candidate continued to give Stan

blocks as the Cardinal fell behind
9-3. A kill by Matt Fuerbringer
