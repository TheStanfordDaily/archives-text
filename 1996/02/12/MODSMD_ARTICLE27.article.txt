Those little Bruins sure can
be pesky.
Yesterday afternoon at
Pauley Pavilion, UCLA gave the
fourth-ranked Stanford women
their closest call of the Pacific
10 Conference season in a 61-59
Cardinal victory. The win, cou
pled with Friday's 77-54 rout of
USC, gave Stanford a clean sea
son sweep of the Southern Cali
fornia schools and boosted the
the women's conference record

to a spotless 11-0.
But it sure wasn't easy. The
Bruins (10-10 overall, 5-6 Pac
-10), who led Stanford (18-2
overall) well into the second half
in their first meeting of the sea
son last month at Maples Pavil
ion, gave the Cardinal all it
could handle yesterday. Down
60-52 with just under four min
utes remaining in the second
half, UCLA scored six straight
points to pull within two, then
nearly pulled off a miraculous
last-second comeback.
It all started with two min
utes, nine seconds left in regula
tion and the Cardinal ahead 60-
52. It appeared as though Stan
ford was finally beginning to
pull away in the final minutes,
but junior guard Nickey Hilbert
and her Bruin teammates had
other ideas.
After UCLA cut the deficit to
seven on a free throw, the Bru
ins regained possession and
Hilbert buried a three-pointer
from the right baseline to cut it to
60-56. When Stanford failed to
score on its next trip downcourt,
Hilbert once again took matters
into her own hands, driving in for
a layup that made it 60-58 with
just 30 seconds to play.
On the ensuing inbounds play,
Stanford called timeout after
being trapped by UCLA defenders.
On the second try, sophomore for
ward Vanessa Nygaard couldn't
even get the ball in and was forced
to burn another timeout. Finally,
on the third take, Nygaard tried to

loft a pass to sophomore Naomi
Mulitauaopele, but the ball was
underthrown and six-foot-five
Bruin center Zrinka Kristich
intercepted. Kristich then called
for time with 22 seconds to play,
giving the Bruins the ball with a
chance to tie or take the lead on
the game's final possession.
UCLA's golden opportunity
was laid to waste, however, as
Stanford's Kate Starbird stole an
errant pass in the backcourt and
passed it off to Jamila Wideman,
who was promptly fouled. Wide
man sank her first foul shot but
missed the second, giving the
Bruins one last-gasp chance.
Kristich promptly hauled in the
rebound and — with no timeouts
remaining — relayed it to point
guard Erica Gomez, who brought

it downcourt with under 10 sec
onds to go.
Gomez launched a three-point
er from the left wing that missed,
but a late whistle with just one
second remaining indicated that
Gomez had been fouled. The offi
cials ruled that the foul occurred
after the shot, however, and sent
Gomez to the line for a one-and
one. Instead of three free throws
and a chance to tie the game,
Gomez would have to make her
first shot, then purposely miss
the second and hope for a miracle.
It was not meant to be, howev
er, as Gomez — after making the
first shot — missed the rim com
pletely on her second free throw.
Stanford was awarded possession
and ran out the remaining time
on the clock to salvage the win.
Nygaard and Starbird finished
with 19 points apiece to pace the
Cardinal offense.
Friday night's game didn't pro
vide nearly the same level of
excitement as Sunday's contest.
Led by Starbird's 29 points, the
Cardinal jumped out early against
the Trojans (9-10, 4-6) and led by
as many 25 en route to the 77-54
victory at USC's Lyon Center.
Starbird took control of the
game, scoring the first nine points
of the game as Stanford took a 9-
3 lead. The junior forward tallied
17 in the first half.
"The ball seemed to fall into
my hands in the first few minutes
and I was able to take advantage,"
Starbird said.
Starbird, who scored a school
record 44 points in the win over
USC on Jan. 13, already had 25
points with 13:15 remaining in
the second half — right on pace
for another record-setting perfor
mance. But Starbird went score
less for the next four-and-a-half
minutes and sat out the game's
final five minutes.
"If you look at the stats, this
could have been a close game in
many ways," said USC head
coach Fred Williams. "We had a
lot of opportunities, but I keep
coming back to the rebounding
factor."
That factor was a 35-26 edge in
Stanford's favor, including a 20-9
margin in the first half. The Car
dinal also played well defensively,
holding USC star forward Tina
Thompson to 20 points.
Stanford has now won 12
games in a row and 20 straight in
the Pac-10. The Cardinal returns
to action Thursday night at home
against Oregon State.

It was not meant to be, howev
er, as Gomez — after making the
first shot — missed the rim com
pletely on her second free throw.
Stanford was awarded possession
and ran out the remaining time
on the clock to salvage the win.
Nygaard and Starbird finished
with 19 points apiece to pace the
Cardinal offense.
Friday night's game didn't pro
vide nearly the same level of
excitement as Sunday's contest.
Led by Starbird's 29 points, the
Cardinal jumped out early against
the Trojans (9-10, 4-6) and led by
as many 25 en route to the 77-54
victory at USC's Lyon Center.
Starbird took control of the
game, scoring the first nine points
of the game as Stanford took a 9-
3 lead. The junior forward tallied
17 in the first half.
"The ball seemed to fall into
my hands in the first few minutes
and I was able to take advantage,"
Starbird said.
Starbird, who scored a school
record 44 points in the win over
USC on Jan. 13, already had 25
points with 13:15 remaining in
the second half — right on pace
for another record-setting perfor
mance. But Starbird went score
less for the next four-and-a-half
minutes and sat out the game's
final five minutes.
"If you look at the stats, this
could have been a close game in
many ways," said USC head
coach Fred Williams. "We had a
lot of opportunities, but I keep
coming back to the rebounding
factor."
That factor was a 35-26 edge in
Stanford's favor, including a 20-9
margin in the first half. The Car
dinal also played well defensively,
holding USC star forward Tina
Thompson to 20 points.
Stanford has now won 12
games in a row and 20 straight in
the Pac-10. The Cardinal returns
to action Thursday night at home
against Oregon State.
