# Baseball takes two from Broncos
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team
started its three-game weekend
series against Santa Clara with
bats booming, taking the first two
decisions before the offense was
quieted yesterday in a 2-1 loss to
the Broncos at Buck Shaw Stadi
um.
The Cardinal (7-3) opened the
series on the road Friday after
noon and claimed a 10-4 win

behind a solid performance by
sophomore Kyle Peterson. Peter
son (2-1) went seven innings,
allowing six hits and four runs
while striking out seven.
"I think he pitched a pretty
good game," said Cardinal skip
per Mark Marquess. "It was not
one of his better ones, but it was
a very solid game. He knows how
to pitch and he did a really good
job."
Stanford's 14-hit attack was
led by seniors Brian Dallimore
and A.J. Hinch. Dallimore went
3-for-5 with two runs scored
while Hinch was 3-for-6 with 3
RBIs, including a two-run home
run in the seventh inning.
The Cardinal also ran wild on
the basepaths, as Stanford run
ners were successful on all of
their 10 stolen base attempts.
Hinch, the team leader in stolen
bases, swiped four bags in the
game. Santa Clara was also hurt
by five errors in the field.
Saturday, the two teams met
at Stanford's Sunken Diamond in

an evening game that the Cardi
nal won by a count of 11-1. Stan
ford jumped on Bronco starter
Jeff Perry in the third inning, as
Hinch, shortstop Eric Sees and
sophomore designated hitter Jon
Schaeffer all sent balls over the
left-field fence for home runs.
Sees led off the inning with his
second shot of the season. After a
Jay Pecci single, a sacrifice by Joe
Kilburg and a walk to Jody
Gerut, Hinch connected on his
second long ball of the weekend.
Schaeffer then followed Hinch
with his first roundtripper of the
1996 campaign. Schaeffer fin
ished the game 3-for-5 with a run
scored and four RBIs.
"I'm still trying to work out
some kinks in my swing, but it's
really early in the season," Scha
effer said. "I'm hitting the ball
hard, but it's hits that count. I
think things are coming along
well."
According to Schaeffer, the
high run totals put on the board
by Cardinal batters Friday and
Saturday gave confidence to the
entire team.
"We're just trying hard to
score runs," he said. "We have a
great pitching staff and if we can

start scoring some runs we'll take
some pressure off of them. I
think it's starting to come togeth
er, but we still have a lot of work
to do."
Saturday, the beneficiary of
the offensive explosion was
senior Mario Iglesias (1-0). The
right-hander threw six innings,
giving up four hits and one run.
"Mario did a good job for us
last night," Marquess said. "He
really battled well. He wasn't as
strong because he hadn't had as
much rest after pitching a couple
of innings on Wednesday, but I
was very pleased with his effort."
Iglesias gave way to John
David Brammer, who worked two
innings, striking out three.
Freshman southpaw Tony Cogan
retired the Broncos in the ninth
to seal the Cardinal's fourth con
secutive victory.
The Stanford squad and the
entire Sunken Diamond crowd
had a nervous moment in the bot
tom of the fifth when Hinch —
after diving back to first on a
pick-off attempt — lay on the
ground, attended to by the team
trainer. The Ail-American catch
er bruised his right shoulder and,
although he stayed in to run the

bases, was removed at the end of
the inning. Hinch sat out the
final game of the series and his
status is day-to-day.
Yesterday, the Stanford pitch
ing staff put together another
solid combined effort, as three
Cardinal hurlers allowed two
runs on five hits. The run sup
port was not there, however, as
Stanford managed just one run in
the sixth.
Although freshman starter
Jeff Austin (1-1) took the loss,
the right-hander was again
impressive, throwing 5-2/3 solid
innings. Reliever Tom Reimers
enjoyed continued success in his
2-1/3 shutout innings. Reimers
has yet to allow a run through 11-
2/3 innings in 1996.
"Tommy is pitching excel
lent," said Schaeffer, Sunday's
catcher. "He's really worked hard
and he's been dominant in this
early portion of the season. He's
a tough guy to hit when he's
throwing all four of his pitches
for strikes."
Stanford (ravels to San Fran
cisco for a Tuesday matchup with
the Dons before visiting Fresno
State next weekend for a three
game series.
