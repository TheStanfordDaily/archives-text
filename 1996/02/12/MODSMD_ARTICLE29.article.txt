The eighth-ranked Stanford
men's gymnastics squad over
came the unexpected loss of one
of its top gymnasts this weekend
to beat San Jose State and BYU at
a meet at San Jose.
Sophomore Tim Dalrymple,
the team's top all-arounder, fell

Wiley, a junior, placed first in
the all-around competition with a

combined score of 57.35, beating
BYU's Darren Elg by a full point.

56.05.

lowered. I just wanted to hit my
routines and try to relax."
Junior lan Bachrach, on the
other hand, exceeded his own
expectations by hitting his high
