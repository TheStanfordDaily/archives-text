# Gymnasts top BYU, San Jose State
## 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
The eighth-ranked Stanford
men's gymnastics squad over
came the unexpected loss of one
of its top gymnasts this weekend
to beat San Jose State and BYU at
a meet at San Jose.
Sophomore Tim Dalrymple,
the team's top all-arounder, fell
off the high bars during warm
ups and injured his back.
Nonetheless, Dalrymple still com
peted on the pommel horse, scor
ing one of the team's top four
scores with a 9.2.
The final scores were Stanford
at 224.1, Brigham Young at 221.3

and San Jose at 211.1.
The loss of Dalrymple left
holes in the lineup — only four
Stanford gymnasts competed in
the vault, even though six were
allowed to compete.
Nonetheless, head coach Sadao
Hamada was pleased with the
team's improvement from its last
competition, also at San Jose
State.
"We scored a 224.2, four points
better than three weeks ago. I'm
very happy with the progress," he
said. "Both all-arounders, Keith
Wiley and Jamie Ellis, did a very
good job."
Wiley, a junior, placed first in
the all-around competition with a

combined score of 57.35, beating
BYU's Darren Elg by a full point.
Ellis came in third overall with a
56.05.
Wiley was quick to downplay
his performance.
"Coming off Winter Nationals,
I watered down some events," he
said. "Sadao wanted us to post
some big scores, but after Tim
dropped out, I think his expecta
tions as well as those of the team
lowered. I just wanted to hit my
routines and try to relax."
Junior lan Bachrach, on the
other hand, exceeded his own
expectations by hitting his high
bar routine with a score of 9.8,
the highest score in that event
and in any single event in the
whole tournament.
"It's my all-time high at Stan
ford since I've been here," he said.
"We did predictions for ourselves
last week and I predicted a 9.7 by
NCAAs, and I've met that."
Hamada made a point of high
lighting some of the strong indi
vidual scores for the meet —
sophomore Clarence Miao's score
of 9.5 for the floor exercise and

9.55 on the pommel horse;
Bachrach's 9.8 on the high bar
and 9.55 on the vault; and senior
Peter Hegi's 9.6 on the high bar.
It is these gymnasts, the
younger ones, that Hamada is
depending on to come through
and get stronger as the season
progresses.
"The top guys — I can count
on them for consistency, high
scores, performance and leader
ship," he said, "but in the
younger guys, there is more of a
lack of ability and on the mental
side, they tend to get a little bit
nervous. Right now, I have to
make the younger guys improve a
little bit more."
