# Night in the life of a SURE escort
## 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Editorial staff 
The advantages of being a SURE escort are that
you get to meet people, you get to whiz around cam
pus in a golf cart and you know you're providing a
service for the community.
The disadvantages are that some of the people
you're providing the service for are rude or drunk,
you have to be out in crummy weather and you're
constantly tormented by bollards — those waist
high wood or cement poles which block cars from
driving onto the main part of campus.
Established in 1976 with a focus on safety
rather than merely on convenience, SURE is an
acronym for Stanford United for Rape Elimina
tion. The guiding belief of the organization, accord
ing to its handbook, is that "no member of our com
munity should feel hesitant about traveling around
our campus at night for fear of his or her safety."
Starting every night at sundown and continuing
until 2 a.m., the service offers free rides to anyone
who asks, to and from any destination on campus.
Previously funded by an ASSU special fee, the ser
vice now is supported by the University.
"People don't have a real understanding of the
purpose of the service," said junior Jamie Waters,
who is in his second year as an escort. "But at the

tions on his SURE vehicle.
same time the service is still neces
sary. At worst, it's a worthwhile ser
vice for people who don't know it. At
best, they do know it's worthy."
Waters is one of four students
who gives up his Saturday night
each week to provide this service. In
total, SURE employs 43 students —
32 men and 11 women. The other
escorts who work the Saturday shift
say there are a variety of incentives,
ranging from the serious to the
ridiculous, to work for SURE.
"Several of my friends have been
raped at other universities," said
John Surdyk, a senior. "That pro
vided a lot of the impetus to start
working for SURE. The University
of Wisconsin at Madison doesn't
provide [an escort] service, only call
boxes placed sporadically. It's prob
ably just as dangerous to walk
across campus as to stay with a per
son you don't know that well."
Matt Cavicke, a junior, men
tioned a somewhat less noble reason
to work for SURE. "The golf carts
looked pretty fun to drive," he said.
During the first shift of a Satur
day night in early February, Wa
ters, Surdyk, Cavicke and fresh
man Andres Romero alternately
went out in the carts to answer
calls. In between their dashes
across campus, they sat at the
SURE headquarters outside the
Tresidder Union Recreation Cen
ter, recounting the trials and tribu
lations of their lives as escorts.
6:20 p.m. There have been only
two calls since SURE opened.
Romero is sharing a story about
some of his more memorable pas
sengers. "I had to pick up a girl at
the Mausoleum dance lon Hal
loween]. She was dressed as a clown,
and she was vomiting while I just sat
in the cart waiting. I had to wait
while her friends helped her vomit."
Another time, said Romero, "I
picked up five guys who were com
pletely inebriated. They were
yelling and screaming and blowing
the SURE whistles. They wanted to
pay me, so they handed me ciga
rettes."
6:54 p.m. A ride has been or
dered from the Psychology Depart
ment in Jordan Hall to Escondido
Village. Surdyk takes the assign
ment. When he arrives, the caller is
not there, so Surdyk uses a walkie

talkie to contact the dispatcher back
in Tresidder.
"We share a radio band with the
police department and Housing and
Facilities," Surdyk explained. "We
keep conversation to a minimum be
cause we're monitored constantly
and other people use it for emergen
cies."
The shared radio band does have
its perks, according to Surdyk. "You
get all the latest news — power out
ages in Stern or something."
7:05 p.m. Surdyk has safely de
livered the passenger, a graduate
student in psychology, to Escondido
Village. Like more than 90 percent
of SURE's passengers, this one was
female.
Surdyk is reflecting on the lack of
amenities in the carts. "One thing
that would be nice would be a radio.
Occasionally, I'm lucky enough to
get a member of an a cappella group,
and that makes the ride so much
better."
Without either a radio or a pro
fessional singer, Surdyk said, he
provides the music himself. He says
his singing elicits a variety of re
sponses. "People say, 'Oh, please
stop,' or 'Do you have a radio?' or
'Do you sing?' and the answer to all
three, of course, is 'No.'"
7:15 p.m. Back at Tresidder, a
student approaches the SURE desk
and offers the escorts Gummi
Bears. The student is Rhonda
Moore, a sixth-year graduate stu
dent in anthropology. She is coming
from the Coffee House and needs a
ride to Escondido Village. She and
Walters head outside to a golf cart.
Moore, who now lives off cam
pus, said when she lived on campus,
"I used to use SURE Escort every
night. I used to know everyone. Peo
ple were really great. I don't know if
it's utilized, but it's worth the
money.
"When you're a woman walking
alone on campus, it's not the most
well-lit place. Even if I don't use the
service, it's nice to see people
whizzingby and knowing they care."
For the rest of the ride, Moore
and Walters discuss the Marines,
German desserts and whether the
Economics Department suffers
from fin emphasis on graduate stu
dents rather than undergraduates.
Returning to Tresidder, Walters
rates Moore as "definitely above av
erage in friendliness."
7:55 p.m. Erica Liang, a fresh
man, is getting a ride from Toyon to
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Her driver

is Surdyk.
Liang said she has a bicycle but
uses SURE for several reasons. "I'm
either too lazy or use it rather than
just going by myself. At night, it gets
kind of cold."
7:58 p.m. Surdyk mentions that
the father of one of the other escorts
is a race car driver.
8:40 p.m. A man with dread
locks and a Grateful Dead shirt ap
proaches the SURE desk and asks
for a dime. No one can provide one.
Because of SURE's central loca
tion, the escorts say they receive
many requests that have nothing to
do with their actual service. "We get
asked where the bathroom is, where
the pool tables went and how to use
the (videocassette rental) ma
chines," said Walters.
8:55 p.m. The escorts ponder
the lack of calls. Last Saturday, they
had a total of 130. Tonight, more
than two hours into their first shift,
they have had nine. Are people not
goingout because of midterms, they
wonder. Are there dorm ski trips
this weekend? Are students prepar
ing for job interviews?
No one has heard of any big par
ties occurring tonight, which might
be a good thing. "At parties, you say,
'Did anyone order a SURE Escort?'
and all these people say, 'Yeah, I or
dered an escort,'" said Cavicke.
Parties are also a nuisance, the
escorts explain, because often the
caller has no phone number for the
escorts to use in case there is diffi
culty locating the caller. Sometimes
people call from parties for an escort
and then leave with a group of
friends. On other occasions, people
heading to parties try to persuade
the escorts to come in and socialize.
9:05 p.m. One of the carts is
milking strange sputtering noises.
Waters decides it needs gas and
heads to the Beacon station at the
intersection of Serra Street and
Campus Drive East, but the tank is
almost full. The cart is moving sus
piciously fast.
9:40 p.m. In Tresidder, the es
corts talk about how awkward it is
when you're yawning in class and
you make eye contact with the pro
fessor.
10:10 p.m. A flood of calls come
in. Heavily perfumed females need
rides to birthday parties in Kimball
Hall and Lambda Nu. The combina
tion of the late hour and a light rain
fall means the escorts will suddenly
be much busier. The second shift
has just started. The night is young.
