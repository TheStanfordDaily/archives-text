# LGBCC receives $2,500 from BCSC
## Grant attempts to strengthen ties between communities 
### Eric Kwiatkowski 
The Black Community Service Center
awarded a $2,500 grant to the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center last week to fund
educational programs.
The grant is the latest effort to strengthen
ties between the BCSC and the LGBCC.
"The more important motivation behind the
grant was the BCSC's commitment to form
community ties with the LGBCC," said Sara
Sperling, graduate intern at the LGBCC.
Promoting inter-community dialogue be
tween the BCSC and LGBCC, the grant will be
used to fund educational programs aimed at
eliminating homophobia and increasing aware
ness of lesbian, gay and bisexual issues, as well
as to bring speakers and workshops to campus.
The funds will also support events during Bi
sexual, Gay and Lesbian Awareness Days
(BGIiAD), which will run April 29 through May
3.
"I see the BCSC as spearheading a response
to the criticism of the ethnic centers as not being
active about incorporating 'queer' members of
the respective communities into ethnic cen-

ters," said Sophie Whyte, diversity program co
ordinator of the BCSC.
"Both organizations are genuinely commit
ted to making transitions into another commu
nity easier and more manageable for any stu
dent or faculty member," said Sherri Taylor,
leader of the LBGCC Speaker's Bureau. She
also emphasized the importance of strengthen
ing relationships between the BCSC and
LGBCC.
"The grant shows an incredible willingness
of the BCSC to have a serious dialogue, and
we're excited about the possibilities," said
David Barba, co-coordinator of the LGBCC.
The relationship between the LGBCC and
BCSC was strengthened this fall when BCSC
Director and Asst. Dean of Students Morris
Graves hired Whyte as diversity program coor
dinator.
Whyte has organized three educational
workshops with the LGBCC, facilitated by
Asst. English Prof. Sharon Holland, adminis
trator for the Martin Luther King Papers Pro
ject Karl Knapper, and members of the
LGBCC.
Graves noted that all of these events under-

lie a sincere effort to build a sense of commu
nity at Stanford so that people know each
other as human beings and end harmful
stereotypes.
"We have a responsibility to treat everybody
who walks through our doors of the BCSC as
equals and also those who receive our program
ming," said Graves.
The programs are mandatory for BCSC
staff.
The first program was a question-and-an
swer session in which people became more
aware about issues in the lesbian, gay and bi
sexual community.
In the second program, open conversations
occurred in which people explored stereotypes
and animosities arising from lesbian, gay and
bisexual issues.
A third program is scheduled later this year
at Ujamaa House; the subject is bridging the
gap between black lesbians, bisexuals and gays,
and the black community.
Graves said he hopes to hire representatives
from the LGBCC next year as staff at the BCSC,
especially since nine members of his student
staff are graduating in June.
