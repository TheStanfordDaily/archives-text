### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
Two men were shot inside Tresidder Union Satur
day night, causing police and University officials to
abruptly end a sorority fund-raiser. Police were able to
disperse the crowd of 450 with limited fighting.
The two 19-year-old victims, whose names were
not released, were treated for minor injuries and re
leased early yesterday morning from Stanford Hospi
tal, said Clinical Nursing Supervisor Judy Heinlein.
Neither victim attended Stanford, said Stanford Po

lice Chief Marvin Herrington.
The Delta Sigma Theta sorority, a chiefly African-
American public service group, threw a party to raise
money for college scholarships Saturday, attracting
students and youths from Humboldt to San Jose.
Before 11 p.m., witnesses said, a man pulled out a
gun intending to impress other party-goers. The gun
fired once, hitting one man in the hand and another in
the leg, said Herrington.
"We don't know why or what the shooting was
