# Men shot at Tresidder
## Sorority fund-raiser disrupted Saturday night 
### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
Two men were shot inside Tresidder Union Satur
day night, causing police and University officials to
abruptly end a sorority fund-raiser. Police were able to
disperse the crowd of 450 with limited fighting.
The two 19-year-old victims, whose names were
not released, were treated for minor injuries and re
leased early yesterday morning from Stanford Hospi
tal, said Clinical Nursing Supervisor Judy Heinlein.
Neither victim attended Stanford, said Stanford Po

lice Chief Marvin Herrington.
The Delta Sigma Theta sorority, a chiefly African-
American public service group, threw a party to raise
money for college scholarships Saturday, attracting
students and youths from Humboldt to San Jose.
Before 11 p.m., witnesses said, a man pulled out a
gun intending to impress other party-goers. The gun
fired once, hitting one man in the hand and another in
the leg, said Herrington.
"We don't know why or what the shooting was

about," Herrington said. "We just
have to piece this together from the
statements."
Few people saw the shooting, but
rumors quickly spread from Tresid
der to neighboring fraternity parties.
"He took out his gun, playing with
it," said Lisa Mahmand, a Humboldt
State student who attended the
party. "He shot himself in the hand."
But police could not confirm that
the suspect shot himself or how the
shooting happened. Police made no
arrests and had no leads in the case,
Herrington said Sunday morning.
Security at the party was mini
mal, with two private security
guards ensuring only that party
goers had paid the $4 admission fee.
Following the shooting, members
of the sorority stopped the party and
ordered everyone to be searched be
fore starting the music again, wit
nesses said. It is unknown whether
the sorority immediately called po
lice, Herrington said.
Sorority members could not be
reached for comment yesterday.
After arriving on the scene

around 11:15 p.m., police sealed off
the Tresidder parking lot but were
reluctant to stop the party.
"We wanted to get enough offi
cers around," Herrington said. "If
there were problems outside we
wanted to respond to them."
After additional units from the
Palo Alto Police Department ar
rived, police met with Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais and sorority leaders
behind Storey House and decided to
end the party.
Eight Palo Alto officers with riot
helmets were stationed in the park
ing lot to discourage unrest.
Wais, Herrington and party orga
nizers entered Oak Lounge at 1 a.m.
and asked the 350 or so remaining
people to leave. The disc jockey asked
people with information to come for
ward.
"We're just trying to get state
ments and find out as much as we
can from those who were here," Her
rington said after the party.
As party-goers slowly filtered
down the stairs in front of Tresidder
Express, two males werejumped and
beaten with chairs in the courtyard.
Because of the sheer size of the
crowd — about 15 to 20 people were
involved in the melee — the two
Stanford policemen monitoring the

area opted to let the fights continue
until they ended or reinforcements
arrived.
The fighting quickly ended as the
assailants ran off toward Lomita
Drive and friends and policemen
congregated around the victims, one
of whom was unconscious.
Ignoring advice from Herrington
that the victims should remain on
the ground, friends of the victims
helped them up and left the scene be
fore paramedics arrived.
A San Jose man was also treated
by paramedics after the fighting sub
sided and released at the scene.
Police yesterday morning were
still searching for leads in the case
and had made no arrests. "It's going
to take the weekend to sort out what
we got," Herrington said early yes
terday. "We don't know what exactly
happened."
Police declined further comment
last night. .
Portions of Tresidder were closed
yesterday morning following the inci
dent so police could search for evi
dence of the fighting. All that remained
after the area was cleared was a blood
stained carpet in Oak Lounge and a
pool of blood with a Latex glove outside
Tresidder where piiramedics treated
one of the shooting victims.
