# Student groups find good partner in Fund
## 
### Kerry Rodgers 
Overcoming a University-imposed ban on
student-run organizations soliciting alumni
donations, the Stanford Fund's Student Group
Partnership is proving a viable alternative to
raise needed money for campus groups, admin
istrators of the fund said.
This month marks the one-year anniversary
of the agreement that launched the partner
ship, which allows student groups to raise
money by working for the Stanford Fund. The
arrangement came after the University ex
pressed concern that uncoordinated solicita
tions might disturb alumni.

Students working with the
partnership spend time writ
ing personal thank-you notes
to alumni who have con
tributed to the fund, which
raised more than $3 million
last year.
The student partnership,
which began operating this
fall, had a slow start. Many of
the shifts available for stu-

dents to work — which last 2-1/2 hours — re
mained empty.
This quarter, however, all shifts are filled
and administrators are considering adding

more shifts. For each group member working,
the organization is paid $20 per hour and an
additional $ 10 per person if they complete their
contract in full, according to Brian Perronne,
director of student development.
The fund has allotted $150,000 for the part
nership for the year, said Perrone. So far, the
fund has paid out about $40,000, he said. How
ever, many student groups have yet to com
plete their contracts, he added.
Student groups must have a proposal to use
the money for a "legitimate part of student
life," said Perronne, adding that a beer-drink-

People is using the money it earns
to help finance a new album, cost
ing $12,000 to $15,000 to produce.
For their last album, they had to
take out loans which took years to
pay off, according to sophomore
Amie Rooney, business manager
for the singing group. Thanks to
the partnership they will have fin

ished paying for their new album
by June, she said.
Although the "feedback has
been very positive" from both stu
dents and alumni, Perronne said,
the program is still very new and
administrators are still "fine-tun
ing."
This quarter the partnership
has expanded by adding a new
shift to accommodate more stu
dent workers, and future plans in
clude having students work at
such special events as Parents'
Weekend.
Another point on the agenda is
developing "a more efficient way

of communicating with students,"
Perronne said. Currently, one per
son has the overwhelming task of
scheduling and updating all 37
student groups involved. One pos
sibility is to develop a World Wide
Web site, said Perronne.
Moreover, Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe said she
hopes in the future to have a way
to pre-schedule groups so they
could reserve space based on the
time of year they need funds.
Howe's office recently put to
gether a fund-raising guide to help
student groups raise money more
successfully. The guide outlines

such options as ASSU funding,
local donations, individual fund
raisers, alumni solicitations and
the Stanford Fund partnership.
Nancy Wells, director of the
Stanford Fund, who was key in
the formation of the partnership,
finished her last day of work on
Friday. She has accepted a top
fund-raising position at Duke
University. She will be replaced by
alumnus Chris Ponce, Class of
'79. He has been the assistant
dean for development at the
School for Humanities and Sci
ences since 1993 and will assume
his new position on March 18.
