# Guinier urges collaboration
## Penn prof. encourages discussion to resolve differences 
### Jessica Lehman 
In a speech Friday night in Kresge Audi
torium, University of Pennsylvania Law
Prof. Lani Guinier used a scene from the re
cent film "Apollo 13," in which a team of sci
entists fits a square peg into a round hole, to
illustrate that people can achieve almost
anything in a "collaborative setting."
She urged the audience to "challenge our
conventional assumptions" and work to
gether with people of different perspectives
to move forward as a complete society.
In a speech titled, "Why We Need a Na
tional Conversation On Race," Guinier em
phasized that "we all win something" when
citizens collaborate in such situations as
community meetings and legal negotia
tions. She proposed moving from a "winner
takes-all" approach toward a more coopera
tive effort, in which citizens "talk to resolve,
not just to win."
Guinier's speech focused on the differ
ence between "sameness" and "fairness,"
and on what it means to be qualified for ajob
or for admission into schools. In addition,
she spoke on the significance of discussing
the issue of race at a national level in order
to decide "where we as a society want to go."
From the very beginning, she warned, "I
don't have the answers. I am trying to get us
to ask different questions, to convince you,
to prompt you, to inspire you, to motivate
you to participate in the conversation."

Guinier attacked the American premise
of "one-size-fits-all uniform treatment."
She cited a study of Pennsylvania law stu
dents as an illustration that treating people
in the same way does not always mean treat
ing them fairly.
The study shows that although women
and men enter law school with virtually
identical credentials, by the end of the first
year men are three times as likely as women
to be in the top 10 percent of the class and 1-
1/2 times as likely to be in the top half.
Guinier explained this discrepancy by
pointing out that even if men and women
are treated in the same way, women seem to
wait for "friendliness cues" from professors
before going to speak to them and raise their
hands in class only after they have clearly
formed their thoughts.
The study also showed that LSAT scores
do not correspond correctly to first-year law
school performance in more than 75 percent
of all cases.
The problem, according to Guinier, was
not that the entry-level credentials over
predicted for women, but that "they didn't
predict for anybody."
In deciding who is qualified for law school
or any position, affirmative action can be
used as a platform upon which people can
look at all factors and "think about merit,
excellence, and competence in conjunction
with the job," Guinier said. She said when
lawyers meet together and negoti
ate — rather than argue in a
courtroom — all parties end up
happier.
She proposed that we "use the
perspective and experience of those

who have been lefl out to rethink
what it means to do a good job." She
pointed out that when women were
introduced into the New York City
Police Department, the women
who took part in housing projects
treated the youth with respect and
received in return far more than
their male counterparts.
Attended by more than 250
people, the speech was part of a

three-day conference called "E
Pluribus Unum: American Na
tional Identity / Identities."
Cuinier, a graduate of Radcliffe
College and Yale Law School, has
served as assistant counsel for the
NAACP and assistant to the attor
ney general. She has written vari
ous articles on democracy and in
1994 published a book titled,
"Tyranny of the Majority: Funda

mental Fairness in Representa
tive Democracy."
Guinier attracted media atten
tion in 1993 when President Clin
ton nominated her for attorney
general and then withdrew the
nomination in response to political
pressure. Much of the controversy
centered around her broad critique
of accepted voting procedures and
traditional democratic institutions.
