## Studies to analyze link between emotional state, cancer Therapy helping to fight cancer 
### Alison Davis Contributing writer 
Medical research continually evaluates the effec
tiveness of new drugs to thwart life-threatening ill
nesses like cancer, but what about the effects of non
pharmacologic approaches, such as participation in
support groups?
Psychiatry Prof. David Spiegel is currently inves
tigating the importance of emotional and mental
health for patients with breast cancer.
Spiegel is leading several ongoing studies which
examine the physical and psychological effects of at
tending support groups.
A few years ago, Spiegel published the results of a
controversial study which suggested that patients
with metastatic breast cancer — cancer spread
throughout the body — fared significantly better
after receiving group therapy.
One aim of encouraging people to attend support
groups was to help them adjust to life-threatening
diseases. "It turned out that [support groups] were
more helpful than we expected," said Spiegel.
Spiegel's study affirms the opinions of existing
support group organizations. "We absolutely believe
in the efficacy of support groups in terms of long-term
survival," said Margaret Coyne Gutierrez, acting
director of the Community Breast Health Project.
However, the medical community is more skepti

cal, primarily due to methodology used in the earlier
study. "It's likely that therapy improves patients'
quality of life, but perhaps not quantity of life," said
Bob Carlson, associate professor of oncology.
Richard Shapiro, an oncology fellow at Stanford,
agreed. "It's obvious that therapy is very helpful, but
the likelihood that it will impact overall survival is
very small." Both agree that attending support
groups can be very useful in helping patients under
stand and cope with their disease.
To help clarify these issues, Spiegel is conducting
several randomized studies, all of which will more
closely analyze potential relationships between the
patient's emotional state and disease progression.
A few different trials are currently underway for
women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. One
study addresses the effects of anti-depressant med
ications on patient survival. Another study involves
women who don't have breast cancer but are consid
ered at a high risk for developing the disease due to
their genotype. Recent studies suggest that women
with certain genotypes are more likely to develop a
familial form of breast cancer.
The global effectiveness of psychosocial interven
tion on diseases like cancer awaits the results of care
fully controlled clinical trials like these, said Carlson,
but the nature of these trials is such that it will be
years before we know how much therapy affects sur
vival rates in patients with serious diseases.
