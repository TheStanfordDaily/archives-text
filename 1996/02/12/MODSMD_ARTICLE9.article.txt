Tree chases alleged KA thieves
After hearing a noise while visiting a friend
early Friday morning, sophomore Chris Bon
zon — otherwise known as the Tree — helped
Stanford Police follow the trail of some stolen
food.
Junior Rose Colborn, kitchen manager at
the former Kappa Alpha house, said she and
Bonzon saw a truck full of food pull away from
her residence at about 4:30 a.m.
Bonzon then dashed out the window, chas
ing the truck from the house near Lake Lagu
nita to the corner of Campus Drive and May
field Avenue, where he was able to discern the
truck's license plate number. Stanford Police
later found the truck loaded with about $100
worth of potatoes, onions, pasta, retried
beans, milk, hot chocolate, soft drinks and
beer.
Two Stanford students, seniors Rylan Gre
gory Peery and Erik Thomas Ulvestad, were
taken to Santa Clara County Main Jail in. San

Jose for the alleged theft, said Sgt. David Lee.
"As the Tree, it's my duty to be an upstand
ing citizen," Bonzon said, adding that "Spi
derman has been my hero for my whole life."
EV apartment ransacked
Four residents of Escondido Village were
robbed Jan. 26, according to Stanford Police re
ports.
The apartment shared by the students was
stripped of most valuables — including four
laptop computers, two stereos, compact disc
players and telephones. The burglars reported
ly entered through an unlocked sliding glass
window.
According to Niemeyer, solicitors were seen
in the area about the same time as the burglary.
However, police have no suspects at this time,
and Niemeyer urged people to report all suspi
cious behavior and prowlers in the area.
