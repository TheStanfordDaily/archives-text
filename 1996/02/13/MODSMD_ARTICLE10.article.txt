Two Serbs go to court
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — The
Bosnian government whisked two Serb officers
out of jail yesterday and onto a plane bound for a
U.N. war crimes court. Under U.S. pressure to
defuse a crisis with angry Serbs, the Bosnians
agreed not to arrest more suspects without the
court's go-ahead.
Dressed in heavy flak jackets and helmets,
Gen. Djordje Djukic and Col. Aleksa Krsmanovic
were taken by the NATO-led peace-enforcement
mission from a central Sarajevo jail.
In a convoy bristling with guns, the two were
transported to a stadium on the north side of
Sarajevo, where a U.S. Blackhawk helicopter met
them. The helicopter flew them to Sarajevo's air
port, where they boarded a military C-130 Her
cules transport bound for The Hague, Nether
lands, seat of the U.N. war crimes tribunal.

The two Serb officers arrived at the Schevenin
gen detention complex late yesterday, according
to a tribunal source who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The tribunal has its own 24-cell hold
ing block, which up until now has been inhabited
only by one man, Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic.
FDA approves baldness drug
WASHINGTON (AP) — Balding Americans
will be able to buy the hair-growth drug Rogaine
by spring without stopping to see a doctor first.
The Food and Drug Administration decided
yesterday that Rogaine can be sold in drugstores
alongside the shampoos and hair colorings, mak
ing it the only medically proven drug to fight bald
ness available without a prescription.
But while the move means people can buy a lit
tle hope against hair loss for about $30 a month,
the FDA warned that not everybody should.
