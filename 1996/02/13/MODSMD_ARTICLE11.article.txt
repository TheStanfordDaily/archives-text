# Dole wins Iowa caucuses
## Buchanan finishes second, followed by Alexander 
### 
DES MOINES, lowa (AP) -
Sen. Bob Dole scored a shaky vic
tory in lowa's Republican presi
dential caucuses last night as Pat
Buchanan emerged from the
GOP field to ready a conservative
challenge in next week's pivotal
New Hampshire primary.
Former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander ran a solid
third and hoped that would be
enough to give his cash-poor cam
paign a fresh start for the five
week blitz of primaries likely to
settle the nomination fight.
All the candidates vowed to
press on, but lowa's results were
sobering to publishing heir Steve
Forbes, who was a distant fourth,
and may have dealt a fatal blow to

Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, who ran
fifth.
President Clinton was unop
posed in the state's Democratic
caucuses, and the bruising
nature of the Republican race
was a vivid reminder of Clinton's
luxury.
Rivals rushed to assert that
Dole's win was hardly convinc
ing, noting that he ran 10 points
behind his 1988 showing here.
But Dole said his was hardly a
weak showing, telling a victory
rally, "We withstood a barrage of
millions and millions and mil
lions of dollars of negative adver
tising and came out on top."
With 97 percent of the vote
counted, Dole had 26 percent, to

23 percent for Buchanan. Alexan
der had 18 percent, Forbes 10
percent and Gramm 9 percent.
Buchanan closed the lowa
campaign imploring supporter,
of anti-abortion longshot Alan
Keyes to rally to his side and will
head to New Hampshire wishing
he had been more successful:
Keyes got 7 percent, a remark
able showing given his shoestring
budget. Indiana Sen. Dick Lugar
had 4 percent and plain-spoken
businessman Morry Taylor 1 per
cent.
News organizations projected
Dole's victory as the caucuses
began, based on surveys of partic
ipants as they arrived at their
precincts.
