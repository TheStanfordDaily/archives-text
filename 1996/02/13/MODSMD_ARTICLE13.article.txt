ASSU must look
beyond itself when
reforming policies

CAMPAIGN FINANCE reform
is an issue generally tackled
on a national level out of
concerns with nebulous dealings
between candidates and political
action committees. Apparently,
the ASSU is not immune to these
controversies — it seems that
spending reform has been occupy
ing far too much of the ASSU's
time in the past few weeks.
Recently introduced, the cam
paign finance reform measure —
which would reduce spending lim
its on groups and individuals seek
ing special fees and elected posi
tions — has sparked much pas
sionate debate. It's nice to see the
senate talking about issues it
thinks will have a major impact on
student life. Unfortunately, this is
the wrong issue.
Modifying finance rules not
only will fail but also will have lit
tle impact on student life. It's not
surprising that campaign finance
rules are only of great interest to
those seeking office and to self
described ASSU watchdogs. How
ever, the rules currently in exis
tence are unenforceable. Reform is
needed, but not in the way the sen
ate proposes.
Proponents argue that reducing
campaign spending limits for sen
ate candidates — from $120 to $60
— will level the playing field for all
candidates and reduce the number
of fliers on campus during elec
tions. However, even $60 can buy
thousands of fliers and produce
substantial litter. Also, there are
many ways for candidates to cam
paign without spending any
money, though under current
rules the costs of all materials
used will be deducted from their
allowed spending limit.
The rules can onlv be enforced

when candidates make obvious
large transgressions — such as
throwing a campus-wide party or
hiring a sky-writer. It is simply not
possible to have some kind of cam
paign police who would patrol the
campus to count fliers or stickers.
The decrease to $60 will have
absolutely no impact on campaign
spending because of the sheer triv
iality of the difference.
Currently, a large part of sena
torial discussion has also centered
on finding loopholes around the
campaign finance rules — it is not
difficult to come up with dozens of
practices which fall into a legal
"gray zone" — as well as question
ing how such rules will be enforced
in an unbiased manner.
The debate has also focused on
limiting the spending of political
parties — yet any registered stu
dent organization can qualify as a
party, meaning that myriad groups
could give money to candidates.
If the senate must act on this
issue, it should try to create a code
of conduct — one reached by con
sensus and supported both by cur
rent members and potential candi
dates — rather than adopt more
unenforceable rules.
The senate is spending its
energies contemplating reforms
which will not function and will
not significantly affect the stu
dent body. In a perfect world, it
could focus on this and other
issues. Unfortunately, the ASSU
is not perfect — the senate has
yet to demonstrate the ability to
coordinate effectively on more
than one issue simultaneously.
Furthermore, even if it could
agree on this issue, the new rules
wouldn't mean much more than
the old ones. It should jettison its
efforts on this issue and move on,
turning its focus to issues which
impact those outside its own
membership.
Hopefully, the ASSU will
remain as committed and expend
as much energy in trying to make
real change for students as they
have in trying to police future can
didates.
