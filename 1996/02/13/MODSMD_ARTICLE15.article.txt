## After the curtain falls 
### 
Michael pressed on ahead of
us on the crosswalk. "He's in his
element now," one of my friends
joked. Michael stopped and waited for us
on the corner of Castro, the street that
cuts through the gay quarter of San Fran
cisco. He was annoyed at the presumption
that his homosexuality caused him to
blend in here, implying he did not belong
elsewhere. I understood. After all, my gay
friends in high school had introduced me
to the lively bars and cafes and Castro
long before Michael had ever been there.
But take me to Chinatown, and I would
soon get lost in the narrow streets. In fact,
we had just eaten dinner there, in a greasy
restaurant that catered to tourists. Now
we were looking for a place in the city
open in the wee hours.
My friends and I had driven down
Market Street, past the ritzy shopping
center and the rock clubs until we
reached the upscale Safeway, marking
the start of Castro. Most of the group
expected the unusual or the wild. We
strolled through the streets, went to a
bookstore and peeked into a few bars, but
the most exciting place we visited was the
obscene postcards shop.
Then we walked past a group of
leather-clad guys. They noticed our gen
der-balanced group and assumed the
worst. "Breeders," they called after us
gleefully. I threw my arm around Michael
and shot back, "No, I'm straight, he's

gay. We just can't get any." Though
everyone laughed, I could tell some of my
friends were puzzled that gaydar had
failed to detect Michael. I understood
their assumption that Castro was a place
of gay solidarity — for what that was
what they saw.
Here, men walking hand in hand don't
get a second glance. Rainbow flags dangle
from window-sills and pink triangles
emblazon bumper stickers. Here, they
have the authority of naming outsiders,
of choosing who does not belong. Within
that grid of hilly streets, gays seem to
have a greater freedom and opportunity,
just as other minorities do in enclaves
scattered throughout San Francisco.
Sometimes I wonder if such communi
ties get caught up in seeing what others
are not, how others don't fit. Some argue
until the dominant mainstream accepts
them, minorities must create a space for
themselves. These areas also serve as
place for people with shared interests and
culture — Castro is a great place to hang
out. But I also see the dangers of self-per
petuated division.
Two years ago, I went to the massive
Halloween street party in the Castro.
Beautiful drag queens danced alongside
giant genitals. A camera-toting subur
banite leaned over and told me, "It's the
greatest show on earth." Welcome to the
circus, with the community as the freak
show. Admittedly, on special occasions,

many gays and lesbians revel in their
freedom. An awesome, in-your-face-cele
bration.
I worry that some may think sensation
al events define the entire homosexual
experience. They won't know what hap
pens the day after the party. People won't
see them in loving, caring relationships.
They won't realize that gays and lesbians
live in places besides San Francisco, that
the community itself can't be dismissed as
a trendy ghetto. I wonder how people will
understand, when they only have the
desire or opportunity to see the exotic.
Michael's explanation of those differences
would have gone unheard at a noisy dis
play.
Later that night, we drove to the top of
Twin Peaks, the highest place in the city.
Fog usually clouded the view. Tonight,
the city opened before us, warm golden
lights on a cold night. You could see how
small San Francisco actually was. North
Beach, J-town, Chinatown, Castro,
Union Square — all blurred into a flick
ering glow.
The glare of the sun would fall over
the city in a few hours.
