# The
						media should not have access to Honor Code cases

I am again dismayed by the senti
ments expressed by Bob Beyers, former
director of the Stanford News Service, in
his letter printed in The Daily on Feb.B.
He is of the opinion that the names of
students found guilty of misconduct
should be made public, ostensibly to pre
vent a "shadow" from falling on stu
dents not involved in the misconduct,
but otherwise associated with the class
or group affected.
I fear this is the typical line of reason
ing employed by the press as they
attempt to interpose themselves into
every nook and cranny of our private
lives. There are some affairs which do
not benefit from press scrutiny. There is
no necessity for the public to be involved
in such events â€” there is no "clear and
present danger" and the public does not
benefit from the knowledge. It is merely
titillating and sells newspapers.
Does Mr. Beyers sincerely believe that

a Stanford graduate will be denied career
advancement because he was a member
of a class in which someone is thought to
have cheated on an exam? Rather, Bey
ers may be interested in publicly embar
rassing students who exhibit poor judg
ment because it makes a good newspaper
story. The University is correct to deal
with these matters privately where
appropriate steps can be taken deliber
ately and without sensationalism.
The press, including The Daily, is
quick to print stories which excite the
base instincts. However, they are loathe
to print follow-ups when the stories
prove to be groundless. Even when the
charges are proven to be false, a person's
name is damaged by zealous reporting of
the charges and the tiny follow-up
months later when innocence is estab
lished. This is why I resist the urge to
publicize every alleged transgression,
and even proven ones which are of limit
ed significance. Privacy is threatened by
the relentless onslaught of cameras and
microphones. We had better decide now
where we want the line to be drawn, or
it will be drawn for us.
