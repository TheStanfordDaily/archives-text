# Residences should charge same rent
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees will approve the
1996-97 charges for room, board and
tuition today. Before that happens, I want
to point out an inconsistency in the sched
ule of student room rates. For at least
three years, students living in self-operat
ed houses and many theme houses have
been charged over $600 per year more
than residents of undergraduate dorms.
Assuming nothing is done, that figure will
likely reach $700 in the coming year.
Why is every person living on the row
(excepting those in Columbae and Sigma
Chi) and in EAST House and Alpha
Sigma being asked to pay so much more
than their friends in similar rooms in
dorms across campus â€” more, in fact,
than for students in any other student
housing, including the Suites, Mirrielees
and Rains? The jump in rent from the
dorms to the 16 affected houses is exact
ly 20 percent each year, which seems
artificial. Could this be a mistake? If it is
not, then I wish to lodge a grievance
against it.

I have heard it suggested that higher
room rates are a method of making up
for the lower board costs in houses that
do not utilize University Dining Ser
vices. Is this so? Are students in some
houses being charged more for rent sim
ply because their meal plans tend to cost
less? If there are actual costs associated
with not using University Dining Ser
vices, they should be separate from the
room charge.
Students should not be penalized for
living in one of these houses, whether by
choice or assignment. The rooms are no
different; the University cleaning service
is no different. But the price is higher. I
hope it will be looked into and corrected.
