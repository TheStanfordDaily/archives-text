# Marguerite: How's our driving?
## Transportation Programs will seek input on free shuttle service 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Officials from the University s
transportation department plan to so
licit input from the community on how
best to improve the Marguerite, Stan
ford's free campus shuttle bus service.
Last year, the University Subcom
mittee on Transportation System?
helped to formulate plans for expand
ing the schedule of Marguerite servicc
on weekdays from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. The
new schedule, with buses running

every 15 minutes, began last quarter.
In the past month, the subcommit
tee — composed of faculty, staff and
students appointed by the ASSU — has
met again with a group from the Office
of Transportation Programs to lay the
foundation for expanding Marguerite
service to include weekends and special
events such as sports matches.
"It is our long-term goal to make it
unnecessary for anyone to own a car on
this campus," said Julia Fremon, man
ager of Transportation Programs. "We
are in the process of forming focus

groups to advise our department on
how to proceed."
Fremon said she hopes Marguerite
will be part of the solution to accessibil
ity and parking at Stanford, where get
ting to the other side of campus at night
or traveling from distant points like the
Medical Center often means using a
car.
"We have hired outside consultants'
to coordinate efforts between the focus
groups and the working group and sub
committee," said Fremon.
One focus group consisting of
resident students has already
met. The other group, composed
of researchers who work late
hours, is currently being pieced
together.
Fremon said one of her main
concerns is the safety and trans
portation needs of Stanford staff,
researchers and students who
have to work late and live far
away from their residence.
"We are in consultation with
many groups on campus, includ
ing SURE Escort, on how to pro
vide safe rides on campus," she
said.

Diego Terneus, operations
manager for Transportation Pro
grams, said the new expansion is
not a rival of SURE Escort. The
escort service uses golf carts to
give rides to students during the
late hours of the night on cam
pus.
"Our planned service is not
meant to compete with the SURE
Escort," said Terneus. "It would
be like comparing apples and or
anges."
Terneus said SURE is limited
in its scope by the types of vehi
cles it uses to transport people.
While golf carts might be good for
getting people from point A to
point B on campus, they become
impractical once off-campus des
tinations are considered.
"There are places a golf cart

can go and a bus can't, and vice
versa," said Fremon.
In addition to late-night trav
el, Fremon said she would also
like to see how Marguerite could
be used to improve accessibility
for students who live or need to
shop off-campus.
"One of our goals is ... to ac
commodate those students whose
schedules do not match that of
the regular operating schedule of
the Marguerite as it operates
now," said Terneus.
Terneus said any expansion to
Marguerite's service and sched
ule would be funded by parking
permit fees and should not place
additional burden on the Univer
sity's budget. Currently the per
mit fees entirely fund the shuttle
service.
