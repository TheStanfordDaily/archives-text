# Marguerite: How's our driving?
## Transportation Programs will seek input on free shuttle service 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Officials from the University s
transportation department plan to so
licit input from the community on how
best to improve the Marguerite, Stan
ford's free campus shuttle bus service.
Last year, the University Subcom
mittee on Transportation System?
helped to formulate plans for expand
ing the schedule of Marguerite servicc
on weekdays from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. The
new schedule, with buses running

every 15 minutes, began last quarter.
In the past month, the subcommit
tee — composed of faculty, staff and
students appointed by the ASSU — has
met again with a group from the Office
of Transportation Programs to lay the
foundation for expanding Marguerite
service to include weekends and special
events such as sports matches.
"It is our long-term goal to make it
unnecessary for anyone to own a car on
this campus," said Julia Fremon, man
ager of Transportation Programs. "We
are in the process of forming focus

groups to advise our department on
how to proceed."
Fremon said she hopes Marguerite
will be part of the solution to accessibil
ity and parking at Stanford, where get
ting to the other side of campus at night
or traveling from distant points like the
Medical Center often means using a
car.
"We have hired outside consultants'
to coordinate efforts between the focus
groups and the working group and sub
committee," said Fremon.
