## Number elitism — Why p and e are so darn special 
### 
Q What's so special about the
numbers p and e?
A Each number is special in its
• own unique way. It's just e and
• p are more special than others.
Call it number elitism, if you want, but
there's no changing the elevated status e
and p have in mathematics.
You'd think that p, being a Greek let
ter, would have been first used in math
back in ancient Greece. The geometry
most people know today is called
Euclidean geometry, named after and
invented by one of those now-dead Greek
mathematicians. It would seem logical
that the Greeks would have been the first
to use p to represent the ratio of a circle's

circumference to its diameter.
The thing is, though, that the Greeks
had a very hard time dealing with irra
tional numbers. An irrational number is
a number which cannot be represented as
a whole number divided by another
whole number. The Greeks, wanting the
universe to be "beautiful," didn't like the
fact that there were numbers of this sort.
And they didn't like that p was one of
these numbers. So they skirted the issue
by using fractional approximations. So,
the next time you are 8.5.-ing your way
through a math exam, explain to your
professor that it's a mathematical tradi
tion.
It was a very long time before people
started using p to represent the exact
value of this ratio. In 1706, a very

unknown mathematician by the name of
William Jones first came up with the
notation, supposedly as an abbreviation
of the word "periphery." Of course, since
he was relatively unknown, no one really
cared or noticed. It wasn't until Leon
hard Euler, a much cooler math guy,
used it in 1737, that p gained popular
acceptance.
In fact, Euler was so cool, he was also
the guy who named e.
To many people, e seems like a pretty
random number. It looks like it's just
another number mathematicians invent
ed so that they could memorize the first
30 digits and impress people at cocktail
parties.
Part of the reason e isn't as popular as
p is because it is more difficult to under

stand what is so special about it. Every
one learns what p is in elementary school,
but e remains dark and mysterious to
many people. Not until you really get to
know e, through calculus, does it become
apparent how friendly e really is.
If you don't know or remember too
much of calculus, then it's really hard to
explain why e is so important. The gener
al gist, though, is that e makes math so
simple. The derivative of ex is ex. The inte
gral of 1/x is In x, where In x is the loga
rithm of x, using e as the base. The sum
mation 1 + xx 2/2! +x2/2! + x3/3! + ... is equal
to ex. Anyway, when you do enough calcu
lus, you start to see that e pops up every
where, even when you least expect it.
The greatest thing, though, is that eip
+ 1 = 0. This equation puts together the

five most important numbers in mathe
matics into one handy equation. There
are no other numbers to get in the way,
just e, p, i, 1 and 0. It's not surprising
that this very cool equation is called
Euler's formula.
So the deal is, e and p are so special
because they are everywhere in math.
You just can't do any substantial math
without running into them all the time.
It's like trying to write without capital
letters, unless you're e.e. cummings.
