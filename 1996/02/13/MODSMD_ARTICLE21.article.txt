The main lights were shut off,
and only a spotlight illuminated
Stanford freshman Ryan Wolters
as he walked onto the court at
San Jose Arena last night to play
in his first professional tourna
ment, the Sybase Open. The
crowd went wild for Wolters, a
native of San Jose, and the cur
rent No. 1-ranked collegiate ten
nis player.
As if the pressure of participat
ing in his first pro event wasn't
enough, Wolters also was slotted
to play the No. 3 player in the
world, Andre Agassi.
The excitement and anxiety of
playing Agassi did affect Wolters
early in the match. Wolters, who
lost the match 6-2, 6-2, won only
two points in the first three
games, and was broken twice. But
he battled back to force two
deuces in the fourth game, and
won when Agassi hit a ground
stroke long on break point.
Wolters carried the momen
tum from that break into the fifth
game. He gained the lead at 40-
30, but Agassi forced the game
into deuce with a drop-shot win
ner. Wolters won the next point,
and then hit a blazing backhand
down the line on game point,
bringing him to within 3-2.
"After the first few frames, I

was just trying to figure out what
to do," Wolters said. "It took me a
couple games to settle down and
start hitting with him."
Agassi won the next two games
easily, losing only two points, but
had some difficulty putting the
set away. Up 5-2, Agassi was serv
ing for the first set, but Wolters
jumped out to an early love-30
lead. Agassi battled back to force
a deuce and then won the set on
the next two points.
Agassi again jumped out to an
early lead in the second set, this
time at 4-0. During that stretch,
he broke Wolters' serve twice.
Agassi began hitting the ball
noticeably harder at the begin
ning of the second set, apparently
trying to bring the match to an
end as soon as possible.
"The pace of his groundstrokes
were the toughest to deal with,"
Wolters said. "Watching on televi
sion, you don't even begin to real
ize how hard he hits it. It is a
whole different level."
While the first three games of
the set did go quickly, the fourth
game was the longest, and the
most exciting, of the match.
Wolters, though he did eventually
lose the game, forced Agassi to
play through five deuces and one
break point.
During that fourth game,
Agassi's frustration was made
obvious to the crowd. He began
hitting balls well after the point
was over and cursed on numerous
occasions after losing a point.
"I wasn't quite as consistent as
I wanted to be," Agassi said. "You

come out against a guy you should
beat and you try to play your best
game. It can be a little frustrating
when you don't do that."
In the fifth game, Wolters took
advantage of Agassi's lack of com
posure, and held serve to make
the score 4-1. After dropping the
first two points of that game, he
picked up his performance to win
the next four.
Agassi easily held serve in the

following game to bring the score
to 5-1, and it was Wolters' turn to
serve. Agassi received a break
point, and match point, at 40-30,
but Wolters successfully fended it
off to force a deuce.
At that point, Wolters served up
his only ace of the match to earn
the advantage. Agassi retaliated
with a huge return winner on the
next point, forcing a second deuce,
but Wolters was able to win the
next two points and take the game.
That was all Agassi would let
him win, as the No. 3 player in
the world finished off the match
holdintr serve at love.
