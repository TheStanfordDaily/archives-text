Andre Agassi soundly defeated
Stanford freshman Ryan Wolters
6-2, 6-2, in the first round of the
Sybase Open last night, but there
was a considerable amount of ten
sion on the court.
Agassi approached the chair
umpire midway through the first
set to request that Wolters not
take so much time between
points. "When you run a guy
around from corner to corner,
and he takes that extra time on
his serve, it can make a big differ
ence," Agassi said.
Later in that first set, and
throughout the second, Agassi
repeatedly cursed under his
breath whenever he was dis
pleased with his shots. He also
exhibited his frustration by angri
ly hitting balls well after a point
had been decided. In one such
instance, he hit a wild backhand
into the stands.
The tension reached its climax
in the fourth game of the second
set. Agassi, apparently angry at
the ball boys for not retrieving
balls properly, began rolling balls
around the court, causing the ball
boys to chase them. Wolters
approached the chair umpire and
suggested that this service delay
was longer than any he had taken,
and asked that Agassi not take so
much time between points.
Agassi was outraged that the
Stanford freshman would criti
cize his on-court conduct. He
quick-served Wolters later in the
game (served before Wolters was
ready), and sarcastically asked

him, "Was that too quick for
you?" Wolters calmly responded
with a simple "yes."
In the following game, leading
4-0, Agassi was frustrated with
his play and, looking in the direc
tion of coach Brad Gilbert,
uttered: "I should bagel his ass.
The little fucker." Unfortunately
for the No. 3 player in the world,
he lost that game, and the chance
to bagel Wolters.

'Maybe they do that
kind of bitching here
at Stanford.'
— Andre Agassi

After the match, Agassi
expressed openly his objection to
Wolters' approaching the umpire.
"Maybe they do that kind of
bitching here at Stanford," he
stated at the press conference.
Wolters said that he only men
tioned the delay because he had
been forced to hurry his game. "It
was nothing against Andre," he
said.
Wolters said he understood
why Agassi might have become so
frustrated. "He's a great competi
tor, and he always strives for per
fection," he said. "I guess he
didn't feel he was playing his best
tennis."
The crowd didn't seem to pos
sess the same level of understand
ing. With each incident of poor
sportsmanship by Agassi, more
and more cheers for Wolters could
be heard. The freshman left the
court to a huere ovation.
