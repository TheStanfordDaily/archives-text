Thoughts for a Tuesday . .
. Too bad the Stanford
men's basketball team
can't play its NCAA tourna
ment games at Maples Pavil
ion. The Cardinal hasn't lost
on its home floor this season.

• Stanford is ranked No. 20 in
both the Associated Press and
the USA Today / CNN coaches'
poll this week. Funny, a lot of
people wrote off Mike Mont
gomery's team after an ugly
loss at Washington on Jan. 25.
What a difference two week

ends can make.
If the Cardinal can maintain
the solid, team-oriented style
of play it exhibited in its last
four victories, Stanford could
earn a piece of the Pacific 10
Conference pie for the first
time in 33 years.
• The biggest remaining obsta
cles are a March 3 game at Cal
and a weekend road trip to the
Arizona schools, March 7 and 9.
• Brevin Knight gets my vote
for Pac-10 Player of the Year.
• Is it me, or does the Cardi
nal's loss at USC on Jan. 14 get
more and more bewildering
every week?
• The fourth-ranked Stanford
women have now won 12 games
in a row and could very well go
undefeated in the Pac-10 for the
first time since the 1988-89 sea
son. The scary thing is, the Car
dinal isn't yet playing anywhere
