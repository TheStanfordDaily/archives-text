# Firetruck-red uniforms and other deep thoughts

### 
Thoughts for a Tuesday . .
. Too bad the Stanford
men's basketball team
can't play its NCAA tourna
ment games at Maples Pavil
ion. The Cardinal hasn't lost
on its home floor this season.

• Stanford is ranked No. 20 in
both the Associated Press and
the USA Today / CNN coaches'
poll this week. Funny, a lot of
people wrote off Mike Mont
gomery's team after an ugly
loss at Washington on Jan. 25.
What a difference two week

ends can make.
If the Cardinal can maintain
the solid, team-oriented style
of play it exhibited in its last
four victories, Stanford could
earn a piece of the Pacific 10
Conference pie for the first
time in 33 years.
• The biggest remaining obsta
cles are a March 3 game at Cal
and a weekend road trip to the
Arizona schools, March 7 and 9.
• Brevin Knight gets my vote
for Pac-10 Player of the Year.
• Is it me, or does the Cardi
nal's loss at USC on Jan. 14 get
more and more bewildering
every week?
• The fourth-ranked Stanford
women have now won 12 games
in a row and could very well go
undefeated in the Pac-10 for the
first time since the 1988-89 sea
son. The scary thing is, the Car
dinal isn't yet playing anywhere


Bobby
Cuza
near its best basketball.
• The scarier thing Ls that the Stan
ford women will lose no starters to
graduation this season.
• Brent Barry, NBA Slam-Dunk
Contest Champion. 'Nuffsaid.
• The San Francisco 49ers have
announced they will be switching
the color of their home uniforms
next season, from fire-truck red to
burgundy. Guess that's why they

played so badly in their divisional
playoff loss to the Packers — those
damn fire-truck red jerseys.
• Indianapolis Colts head coach Ted
Marchibroda announced Saturday
that he will not be returning next
season. Apparently, Colts manage
ment withdrew its contract offer
afler Marchibroda turned down a
one-year extension. Must've been
the team's underachieving play.
• The San Jose Mercury News
reported yesterday that boxer
Tommy Morrison (of Rocky V
fame) has tested positive for the

HIV virus. The Merc also made
careful note of the fact that Morri
son is a "profuse bleeder." So much
for journalistic integrity.
• Brent Barry, NBA Slam-Dunk
Contest Champion.
• Two-sport star and prized recruit
Kerri Walsh of Archbishop Mitty
High could make an immediate
impact next year for the Stanford
women's volleyball team.
• Remember when Santa Clara was
being billed as a national contender
after early-season victories over
UCLA and Georgia Tech? Last time

I checked, the Broncos were cling
ing to a half-game lead over Gonza
ga in the West Coast Conference.
• From the Sports Commercialism
file: Sports Illustrated reported in
last week's issue that the Chicago
White Sox have sold advertising
rights to the foul poles at Comiskey
Park.
• Look for Oscar De La Hoya to stop
Julio Cesar Chavez in two rounds
when the two fighters go head-to
head on June 7.
• Did I mention Brent Barry won
the NBA Slam-Dunk Contest?
