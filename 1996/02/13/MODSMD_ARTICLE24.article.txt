# Walsh heads to the Farm

### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team signed three players to letters
of-intent last Thursday, including
the nation's most highly-sought
recruit, USA Today High School
Player of the Year Kerri Walsh.
Joining Walsh in the Cardinal's
freshman class of '96-'97 are Sarah
Clark, a 6-foot outside hitter from
Kamuela, Hawaii, and Jaimi Grego
ry, a 5-foot-8 outside hitter from
Westminster, Calif.
"When I think of the Class of
2000,1 think of three things," said
Stanford head coach Don Shaw.
"First and foremost, these three
are outstanding people with great
team attitudes. Secondly, they are

all very good ath
letes. And third,
they are all very
accomplished
technically, all
very skilled play
ers. Our staff
will not have to
teach them how
to play the game
of volleyball."

Walsh, a 6-foot-2 outside hitter
from Archbishop Mitty High School
in nearby Saratoga, Calif., chose
Stanford over UCLA, UC-Santa
Barbara and Pacific. She is a con
sensus first team Ail-American and
was the MVP of the Junior Olympic
Team that traveled to Slovakia last
summer.
"Stanford is the total package,"
Walsh said when asked what made
her choose the Cardinal. "Plus it's
not far from home. It is one of the
best universities in the world. Aca

demically, you can't beat it. You
could say that Stanford has always
been one of my goals."
The Cardinal is ecstatic to have
her.
"Kerri was the best player out
there," Shaw said. "She's at a level
all her own. Overall, I consider this
to be a strong class nationwide, but
there is little doubt that she is the
best player available in the high
school ranks this year. Much like
Kristin Folkl was as a freshman,
Kerri will be an impact player right
away."
Synchronized Swimming: After
arriving in Seattle last Friday to
find itself flooded out of its hotel,
the Stanford synchro team came
back Saturday to register a clean
sweep of Washington in a Pacific 10
Conference matchup. Led by senior
All-American Bridget Finn, the Car
dinal women outscored the Huskies
108 to 45, taking every event in the
dual meet.
Finn took first place in the solo,
trio, team and senior figures, while
all four of the squad's freshmen
(Vanessa Shaw, Lesley Riddervold,
Catherine Chen and Rachel Wong)
scored points in the competition.
Stanford will compete again this
Saturday, when they travel to
Berkeley for a 1 p.m. match.
Horse Polo: The second-ranked
Stanford men's horse polo team
defeated No. 3 USC last week by a
score of 6-4. The top-ranked Stan
ford women, meanwhile, fell to the
No. 4-ranked Trojans 11-4 in a
match at Petaluma, Calif. Alexa
Christy (3 goals) and Jason Knight
(4 goais) paced the Cardinal in their
respective games.
