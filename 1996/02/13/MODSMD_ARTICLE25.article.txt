Glancing at the Stanford
wrestling team's record this
weekend, it would seem that the
Cardinal had a pretty dull week
end. Wrestling two meets in one
day, the team went 1-1, garnering
a victory against Pacific and los
ing to Oregon. But if one looked
closer, one would see that the
wrestling team had a great week
end, one which makes the
wrestlers look forward to the
Pacific 10 Conference and NCAA
championship tournaments.
The thorough beating of Pacif
ic came first. Stanford took five of
nine matches; three by pin, one
by injury default, and one by

match termination. Senior Matt
Cano pinned Matt Kopetski in the
126-pound weight class. In the
150-pound bracket senior Tod
Surmon pinned Pacific's Herb
Johns. In the 134-pound class,
senior Jimmy Aguirre took care of
Ponciano Raguindin also with a
pin. Senior Sahlan Martin, at 158
pounds, beat Chris Perk by injury
default, and junior Bryan Vaniman
(190 pounds) won by match termi
nation over Christian Ervin.
The final team count of 28-23
nudged Stanford's record over the
.500 mark to 5-4. Pacific's record,
on the other hand dipped to 0-7.
"I was very pleased with the
Pacific dual meet," said assistant
head coach Jay Jackson. "Our big
guns came on strong, pinning three
guys. This dual was won by senior
leadership with our four seniors
scoring 24 of our 28 points."
In the Oregon dual, Stanford
lost by a final margin of 26-12.
However, to say that the Cardinal
scored some major victories en
route to its loss would be an

understatement. Jackson, filling
in for 17-year head coach Chris
Horpel, had said previous to the
dual meet that there would be
three huge matches — Stanford
claimed victory in two of those
three matches, while falling just
short of victory in the third.
Cano (126 pounds) beat Ore
gon's John Taylor, to whom he
had suffered a defeat earlier this
season, by an impressive 8-3
score. Surmon (150 pounds)
jumped up to the 150-pound
weight class and defeated Scott
Norton to avenge last year's loss
in the Pac-10 finals. Norton is
ranked third in the nation in his
weight class. Surmon pulled off
the nail-biting victory with 39
seconds left in overtime.
"Once again, Tod proved that he
is one of the best wrestlers in the
NCAA in his weight class," Jackson
said. "He is an outstanding
wrestler who is having a tremen
dous season. Me wrestled a very
smart match against Norton."
The victory pushed Oregon's
record to a strong 6-4-1, and put
Stanford's record at an even 5-5.
The team's immediate future
looks bright as it sets out to take
down Oregon State next weekend.
