# Cardinal sluggers win San Jose Tournament
## 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The Stanford softball team
bounced back from its season
opening losses to defending
national champion UCLA with big
wins in the San Jose State Tour
nament last weekend and against
UC-Davis last Wednesday.
The San Jose State Tourna
ment was a two-day event pitting
area schools against each other.
Stanford, San Jose State, St.
Mary's and Santa Clara took part
in the weekend action. The Cardi
nal played each team twice,
emerging with four wins in six
games to bring their season
record to 6-4.
The leading sluggers for Stan
ford in the tournament were
junior Amanda Renteria and
freshman Michelle Schneider.
The duo combined for a .500 bat
ting average, six RBIs and eight
runs in the Cardinal's four wins.
Schneider and Renteria also have
the top two batting averages for
the season at .483 and .333,
respectively.
Stanford and the Spartans
clashed in the tourney final. Fresh
man Becky Blevins (3-1) took the
mound for Stanford and worked
five innings, giving up just two hits
and one run. The game was called
at the conclusion of the fifth inning
due to the 1-1/2 hour time limit
placed on each game during the

tournament. The Cardinal led 4-1
at this point.
"I think we're coming together
as a team," said sophomore pitchcr
Jessica Schulman. "We have a lot to
improve on because we're a young
team, but winning the tournament
is a step in the right direction."
The win clinched the tourna
ment for the Cardinal and avenged
an earlier loss to the Spartans on
Saturday. In that game, the Stan
ford attack was held to just two
runs and three hits by San Jose
State's Corina Lilly.
The Cardinal's only other loss
was to Saint Mary's in the second
of three games Stanford played
on Sunday. The Cardinal fought
back from a 4-1 deficit in the last
inning, but came up one run short
for a 4-3 final. Saint Mary's vindi
cated its 5-0 Saturday loss to
Stanford, a game in which Schul
man and junior Angela Webb
combined for seven shutout
innings. Freshman Kelly Yablon
ski was 2-for-3 with three RBIs
for the Cardinal.
Freshman phenom Marcy
Crouch pitched Sunday's first
game for Stanford against Santa
Clara, striking out three and giv
ing up only six hits in a 7-4 victo
ry. At the plate, the Cardinal
went 9-for-20. Renteria led the
way with a 2-for-3 performance,
including one run and one RBI.
