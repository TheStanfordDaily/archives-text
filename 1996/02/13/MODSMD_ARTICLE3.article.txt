# Shooting raises new campus safety issues

In the wake of a weekend shooting at
Tresidder Union that injured two people,
University administrators yesterday admit

In addition to investigating exactly how
the shooting occurred, administrators said
they will look into ways to prevent similar in

by t he number of officers within reasonable
distance of the event.

colleague to "Let them fight."

County Sheriff s Office shortly after the inci
dent was reported, Herrington said, but no
units from that office responded until after

the crowd began to disperse.
Because sherifTs offices
are scattered across the few
unincorporated areas near
campus — some are in the
southern part of the county,
which stretches as far as
Gilroy — response time can
be quite long, he said. Police
first heard of the shooting
at 11:04 p.m.
But crowd control was
not necessarily the main

priority of Stanford Police, Herrington said.
"We wanted to make sure there were
enough officers outside ... so we could get
any statements" that witnesses might have,
he said.
Herrington added that a total of 14 police
