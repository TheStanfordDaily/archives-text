# Shooting raises new campus safety issues
## Officials rethinking handling of large parties 
### Scott Van Winkle Editorial staff 
In the wake of a weekend shooting at
Tresidder Union that injured two people,
University administrators yesterday admit
ted a need to reevaluate their ability to han
dle large on-campus parties.
In addition to investigating exactly how
the shooting occurred, administrators said
they will look into ways to prevent similar in
cidents.
At issue is not only the shooting, which oc
curred during a sorority party, but also sev
eral fights that occurred as police attempted
to control the crowd after the event.
Though he admitted that controlling the
crowd could have called for a larger police
presence, Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
ri ngton said the police response was limited
by t he number of officers within reasonable
distance of the event.
When the fighting originally broke out, a
Stanford police officer in the area ordered his
colleague to "Let them fight."

A call for help went out to the Santa Clara
County Sheriff s Office shortly after the inci
dent was reported, Herrington said, but no
units from that office responded until after

the crowd began to disperse.
Because sherifTs offices
are scattered across the few
unincorporated areas near
campus — some are in the
southern part of the county,
which stretches as far as
Gilroy — response time can
be quite long, he said. Police
first heard of the shooting
at 11:04 p.m.
But crowd control was
not necessarily the main

priority of Stanford Police, Herrington said.
"We wanted to make sure there were
enough officers outside ... so we could get
any statements" that witnesses might have,
he said.
Herrington added that a total of 14 police


Wais
officers, eight from the Palo Alto
Police Department, were on the
scene Saturday.
The shooting took place Satur
day night at a fund-raiser for the
Delta Sigma Theta sorority. Two
19-year-old men, whose names
were not released, were admitted to
Stanford Hospital with gunshot
wounds, while a few others were in

jured in separate incidents that
evening.
At least two fights broke out as
police tried to break up the party
around 1 a.m. Sunday. With more
than 300 people walking out onto
Tresidder's second-story balcony,
the danger of injury was high, Her
rington said.
At the scene on Saturday, Her
rington said he could not recall a
campus disturbance of this magni
tude since the massive student
protests of the 19705.
University administrators said

they were also searching for an
swers, attempting to piece together
exactly what happened Saturday.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
said the University's investigation
of the incident likely would not lay
blame on students but reevaluate
the policy that currently allows off
campus advertising of student-run
events.
Wais called the party a "well-in
tentioned activity" that raised
funds for a good cause.
But Wais would not rule out the
possibility that Delta Sigma Theta,

the sorority that organized the
party, could face sanctions related
to the incident.
Delta Sigma Theta Vice Presi
dent Shanta Henderson said her
group would issue a written state
ment today and that it was seeking
legal advice.
Two guards provided by a private
service apparently formed the secu
rity force for the party, despite Uni
versity guidelines that call for one
security guard for every 50 guests.
Security can be either designated
students or uniformed officers. Po

lice said witnesses estimated more
than 400 guests at the party.
According to Director of Stu
dent Activities Nanci Howe, the
party was one of the larger events
held on campus, attracting stu
dents from throughout the Bay
Area.
All student groups planning to
host a large party are required to
attend a planning workshop, Howe
said. Those sessions, held at least
once per quarter, detail the Univer
sity's policy and guidelines for
hosting parties.

It is unclear whether Delta
Sigma Theta representatives at
tended any of those meetings, Fra
ternal Affairs Adviser Heather
Dunn said. Party guidelines make
it clear that the University will not
take legal responsibility for plan
ning parties, she said.
Sorority members were also not
asked to specify what kind of secu
rity measures they planned when
they applied to rent Tresidder's
Oak Lounge, according to Meeting
Services Manager Jeanette Smith-
Laws.
