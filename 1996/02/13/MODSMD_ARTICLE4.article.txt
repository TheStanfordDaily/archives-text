# Student proposes new constitution for ASSU
## 
### Timothy Kiefer 
A new constitution to be unveiled at
tonight's ASSU Senate meeting is the sec
ond measure in as many weeks attempting
to create a hierarchy in the ASSU's execu
tive branch.
But "Constitution '96," written by senior
Michael Slemmer and sponsored by under
graduate senator Andre Vanier, goes much
further.
It would replace the four-member Coun
cil of Presidents with a president and a vice
president, shrink the senate's size by 25 per
cent and create a judicial branch to handle
alleged constitutional violations.
"Power has been fragmented among four
relatively ineffectual co-presidents," Slem
mer said. "The ASSU needs a single leader."

Under the current system, the ASSU ex
ecutive branch is composed of four co-presi
dents elected together as a slate. Under
"Constitution '96," a president and a vice
president would be elected as a slate.
"If the system works for nearly every de
mocratic nation on earth, for every state in
the United States, it will work for the
ASSU," Slemmer said.
Slemmer is a political outsider of sorts, as
he holds no ASSU office. However, Slemmer
covered the ASSU for a year as a reporter for
The Daily and later served as The Daily's
news editor.Jbit} is no longer employed by
The Daily.
"This is the first time in my memory that
a student, a non-ASSU senator, has pro
posed a change to the constitution," Slem-
mer said.
Some members of the current
ASSU government expressed
misgivings about Slemmer's pro
posal for a smaller executive
branch.
COP member Nicole Vazquez
said a four-person structure pro
vides more opportunity for a di
versity of viewpoints.
"With four you get a wider
pool," Vazquez said. "I think four
is a good balance."
Slemmer's is the third voice in
recent weeks to call for a structur
al change of the ASSU executive
branch. In a guest column which
ran in The Daily last week, ASSU
senator Bill Shen called for a one
president system.

COP member Jon Oram has in
troduced a constitutional amend
ment to provide for one president
and three vice presidents, fie said
Slemmer's proposed system
would overwhelm the president
and vice president.
"The job is too big for two peo
ple to do alone," Oram said.
Although change in the execu
tive structure has been the main
focus of recent debate, Slemmer's
constitution also makes changes
to the ASSU Senate and creates an
ASSU judicial branch.
The current ASSU government
has a 40-member senate, divided
evenly between undergraduates
and graduate students. Half of the
senators vote.
Slemmer's constitution re
duces the senate to 30 members
being split evenly between un
dergraduates and graduate stu
dents. All members would have

full voting privileges.
To become law, constitutional
changes must first be approved by
two thirds of senators, then by two
thirds of students in the general
election. If the senate rejects the
proposal, it can still be placed on
the April ballot if 5 percent of stu
dents sign petitions.
"Constitution '96" creates a
council to ensure that the ASSU's
actions are in accordance with the
ASSU Constitution. The council
would be comprised of five stu
dents appointed by the president.
Under the current system, the
senate interprets the constitu
tion.
Concerns over the senate's lack
of a judiciary body were raised pre
viously over alleged arbitrary en
forcement of the senate's uniform
policy and over a bill encouraging
students to vote against California
Proposition 187.
