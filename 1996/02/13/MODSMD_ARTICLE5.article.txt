# All right now: It's time for dollie tryouts
## 
### Kelly E. Young 
When dollie hopefuls gathered
together for their first meeting
last week, they probably were not
envisioningdancingatGraceland
to the Stanford Band's rendition
of "Hound Dog."
Nor could they have imagined
performing in places as diverse as
bars, roadside Interstate 80,
swimming pools and Harvard
Yard.
However, such unusual expe
riences are just a few of the sur
prises encountered by this year's
dollies, the five-person dance
team that performs with the
Band.
Although the current dollies'
reign doesn't officially end until
the first week in May, tryouts are
currently being held for the 1996-
97 dollies. More than 35 interest
ed dancers showed up at the first
workshop last Monday.
Most women auditioning were
either dancers or cheerleaders
before attending Stanford. "A
couple girls have been dancing
since they were three or four,"
said freshman Ali Peace, a dollie
hopeful.
However, some women have a
more non-traditional dance back
ground.
Sophomore Tomoeh Muraka
mi, who has been figure skating
for 15 years, is trying to take ad
vantage of her experiences. Dollie
dancing is "not very similar to
what I used to do," Murakami
said. "I think I'm going to incor
porate more dance moves into my
original dance."
At the first cut on Thursday,
the prospective dollies will dance
in pairs to two dances choreo
graphed by this year's dollies and

then go solo on a self-choreo
graphed dance to "Living in the
USA." Following these perfor
mances, the dollie pool will drop
to about 13 or 14.
These women will audition
again Saturday morning, per
forming solo. The pool will be ta
pered down to nine hopefuls, who
will attend a party Saturday
night for interviews with the
Band.
The Band narrows the selec
tion to the final five plus one al
ternate.
"This is to make sure they can
tret alone with the Band and with

each other," said Scott McKissen,
dollie assistant manager.
Over the next two months,
the new dollies will learn tradi
tional dollie dances like "Love
Shack" and choreograph now
ones.
The new dollies will also re
turn to Stanford six weeks before
the start of fall quarter to prepare
for football season.
With the help of the dollie ad
viser, Felicia Khoja — a former
dollie herself — the women will
learri the ins and outs of dol
liedom.
"The bulk of the work comes

before the season starts because
the new dollies don't really know
what to expect or what they're
getting into as far as time com
mitment," said Khoja.
This year's dollies are sopho
mores Shaine Muller, Stephanie
Pieczenik, Jo Chien, Julie Cuevas
and junior Erin Cavalli.
They spend about 30 hours
per week attending games, rallies
and practices during football sea
son and 20 hours per week during
the off-season. They learn some
28 different dances in all.
