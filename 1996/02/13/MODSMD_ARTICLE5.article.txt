# All right now: It's time for dollie tryouts
## 
### Kelly E. Young 
When dollie hopefuls gathered
together for their first meeting
last week, they probably were not
envisioningdancingatGraceland
to the Stanford Band's rendition
of "Hound Dog."
Nor could they have imagined
performing in places as diverse as
bars, roadside Interstate 80,
swimming pools and Harvard
Yard.
However, such unusual expe
riences are just a few of the sur
prises encountered by this year's
dollies, the five-person dance
team that performs with the
Band.
Although the current dollies'
reign doesn't officially end until
the first week in May, tryouts are
currently being held for the 1996-
97 dollies. More than 35 interest
ed dancers showed up at the first
workshop last Monday.
Most women auditioning were
either dancers or cheerleaders
before attending Stanford. "A
couple girls have been dancing
since they were three or four,"
said freshman Ali Peace, a dollie
hopeful.
However, some women have a
more non-traditional dance back
ground.
Sophomore Tomoeh Muraka
mi, who has been figure skating
for 15 years, is trying to take ad
vantage of her experiences. Dollie
dancing is "not very similar to
what I used to do," Murakami
said. "I think I'm going to incor
porate more dance moves into my
original dance."
At the first cut on Thursday,
the prospective dollies will dance
in pairs to two dances choreo
graphed by this year's dollies and

then go solo on a self-choreo
graphed dance to "Living in the
USA." Following these perfor
mances, the dollie pool will drop
to about 13 or 14.
These women will audition
again Saturday morning, per
forming solo. The pool will be ta
pered down to nine hopefuls, who
will attend a party Saturday
night for interviews with the
Band.
The Band narrows the selec
tion to the final five plus one al
ternate.
"This is to make sure they can
tret alone with the Band and with

each other," said Scott McKissen,
dollie assistant manager.
Over the next two months,
the new dollies will learn tradi
tional dollie dances like "Love
Shack" and choreograph now
ones.
The new dollies will also re
turn to Stanford six weeks before
the start of fall quarter to prepare
for football season.
With the help of the dollie ad
viser, Felicia Khoja — a former
dollie herself — the women will
learri the ins and outs of dol
liedom.
"The bulk of the work comes

before the season starts because
the new dollies don't really know
what to expect or what they're
getting into as far as time com
mitment," said Khoja.
This year's dollies are sopho
mores Shaine Muller, Stephanie
Pieczenik, Jo Chien, Julie Cuevas
and junior Erin Cavalli.
They spend about 30 hours
per week attending games, rallies
and practices during football sea
son and 20 hours per week during
the off-season. They learn some
28 different dances in all.

Making selections for next year's team, sophomore dollies Stephanie Pieczenik, Jo Chien and Julie
Cuevas watch as prospective dollies practice their routines.
The current dollies said they
found that professors generally
don't make exceptions for them.
Like some athletes, the dancers
had to take their autumil finals on
the road and fax them back to
their professors.
Despite such inconveniences,
this year's dollies have enjoyed
many benefits during their
tenure, they said. They per
formed in San Francisco, San
Jose, Salt Lake City, Boston and
Washington D.C.
"Being a dollie is one of the
most amazing experiences you

can have at Stanford," said
Muller. "Last quarter was the
best three months of my life."
Occasionally, their flashy red
uniforms were recognized beyond
Stanford's pool of students, facul
ty and alumni.
"You have little kids running
up to you asking, 'Can 1 have your
autograph?' Why would you want
my autograph?" laughed Cuevas.
The dollies were initially ner
vous that their lives would be dic
tated by the whims of the Band,
they said.
"A lot | of the dollie experience)
has to do with the culture of the
Band," said Pieczenik.
"We can't be dollies without
the Band or the Tree," added
Cuevas.

The dollies said sometimes
they must contend with precon
ceived ideas about what it means
to be a dollie.
"Sometimes, we're viewed as
[less] intelligent than the rest of
campus," said Pieczenik, who
plans to double major in political
science and history.
These stereotypes even filter
into the new dollie pool. "Half of
my friends are so disappointed in
me," Peace said. "The other half
are like, 'Yeah, it's cool.' It's a
mixed reaction."
The dollies would rather com
pare themselves to athletes than
cheerleaders. "In the way some
people play basketball or volley
ball, this [dancing] is our sport,"
said Cuevas.
