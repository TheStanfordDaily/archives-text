### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
To increase student awareness
about the intricacies of financial
aid, the ASSU and several other
campus offices are hosting a week
long series of workshops and dis
cussions on making the most of the
scholarships, loans, grants and fel
lowships that the University of
fers.
In addition to Financial Aid
Awareness Week's informational
events, the ASSU is creating an Of
fice of Financial Aid Awareness,
which will provide concrete advice
to students with questions about fi
nancial aid.

"The ASSU believes that it's im
portant to take a stance to ensure
that education remains as accessi
ble as possible," said Council of
Presidents member Rich Stolz.
COP member Nicole Vazquez
added, "Financial aid is one of the
basic institutions we want to main
tain. We thought an office dedicat
ed to making information more ac
cessible to students would be a
great service."
Stolz and Vazquez said they and
other members of the ASSU intend
to make Financial Aid Awareness
Week an annual event.
The ASSU's newly created Of-
fice of Financial Aid Awareness
will serve three main functions: ad
vice, awareness and advocacy.
The office in Tresidder Union
will be staffed by COP interns, sen
ate associates and a volunteer from
the Financial Aid Office and will be
open three hours each week. Al
though the staff positions will be
unpaid this year, Vazquez said she
and her fellow COP members will
propose funding and salaries in up
coming ASSU budget discussions.
The ASSU operated an Office of
Financial Aid Advocacy until three
years ago, when students voted not
to have a COP.
In response to threatened cuts in
federal funding for student loans

and grants, a talk on "How Policy-
Making Affects You: Financial Aid
at the State and Federal Levels" will
be given by the Office of Govern
ment and Community Relations
tonight at 7 p.m. in Castano House.
"It is always very important for
students to stay informed," said
Lariy Horton, director of govern
ment and community relations.
"Many policy makers in Washing
ton are extremely interested in
hearing student opinions. Students
owe it to themselves to voice those
opinions."
Other planned events include
how-to seminars on such issues as
the basics of financial aid and how
to effectively locate and utilize Uni
versity resources. The week also in
cludes shared discussions of per
sonal financial experiences and a
talk titled, "Making Ends Meet: A
Stanford Budget Survival Guide."
