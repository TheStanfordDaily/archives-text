## Speakers discuss raising awareness of Islam 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Islamic activists Hakim
Archuletta and Anas Coburn
kicked off a meeting last night with
short talks on the image of Islam,
leading into intense discussion
about misconceptions of the Islam
ic community.
About 30 people attended the
meeting. Much of the discussion
centered on a cartoon in Wednes
day's Daily which many Muslim
students found offensive.
The cartoon by syndicated car
toonist Steve Benson showed cari
catures of Libyan leader Moam
mar Khadafi, Nation of Islam
leader Louis Farrakhan and
Nigerian military leader Sani
Abacha above the caption, "Mus

lim Madman March."
"I am not surprised by the car
toon," said Archuletta. "People
with intelligence need to find out
what Islam really is."
Archuletta explained that de
spite current attempts for political
correctness, "Islam has gotten left
out of diversity."
In the discussion after the talks,
members of the Islamic communi
ty expressed their anger over the
nature of the cartoon's attack.
Though they said poking fun at po
litical figures is to he expected, the
cartoon attacked the Muslim com
munity and religion as well as the
individuals.
"You can't expect other than
that from the media â€” you have to
sell papers, you have to get a rise out
of people," said Coburn.
Dean of the University Chapel
Robert Gregg said the cartoon was
symbolic of the "abysmal ignorance
about the role of religion."
"People who are religious at
Stanford are only able to say things
in reaction to slight and slander,"
Gregg said. "W T e need to find a bet
ter way to show religious life as part
of our identity."
"It is important not to beat peo
ple over the head with the Koran,"
Coburn said. "The best way to
change an image is to get to know
people in the media, to talk to them
and show them you are a real per
son."
