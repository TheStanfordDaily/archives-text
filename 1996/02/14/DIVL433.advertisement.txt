The Stanford Directory is Stanford's official phone book and resource guide - you'll

ated by the Associated Students of Stanford University. The project's primary goal is to pro
duce a publication that maintains a high level of accuracy, organization and design. Expenses
are to be met through advertising sales and an annual contribution from the University. Surplus
revenues are used to benefit other student publications and activities.
As Stanford's most widely used resource guide (circulation 32,(XX)), the Stanford
Directory contains over K6O pages of campus information, maps, listings, advertising and
coupons. In addition, our fledgling web site, the Stanford Virtual Directory, provides online
information resources and has already been featured as 'hot picks' by Netscape, Yahoo & the
San Jose Mercury Center.
The Stanford Directory offers students excellent opportunities to gain valuable man
agerial, organizational, design and business skills and to gain "real world" experience in pub
lishing, marketing and information technologies.
JOB DESCRIPTIONS:
The PROJECT DIRECTOR (salary range: $12.(HX) - $14,(XX) + bonuses) heads the
Directory's fifteen-person staff and is ultimately responsible for the project's success. He or she

The BUSINESS MANAGER (salary range $9,(XX) - $12,(XX) + bonuses) oversees all

outstanding communication and interpersonal skills; the ability to resolve conflicts and crises
quickly; an enthusiastic, friendly personality; and the ability to work well under stress. Extensive
knowledge of Macintosh computer environments and Internet technologies is an added plus.
Both the Project Director and the Business Manager must be a Stanford undergraduate
during the 1995-96 school year; thus graduating seniors are eligible (and encouraged) to apply.
This is your opportunity to leave your mark at Stanford: a copy of your Directory could be tound
