# Trustees approve 4 percent tuition rise, FRI closure
## Food Research decision marks end of the road 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
Hammering in the final nail, the Board of Trustees
yesterday approved a recommendation from University
President Gerhard Casper to shut down the Food Re
search Institute.
At the same time, it authorized merging the Opera
tions Research and Engineering-Economic Systems De
partments.
"There was a full discussion," said Board Chair John
Freidenrich after the meeting, referring to the decision
to close the institute. But in the end, "there was no dis
agreement with the recommendation from the adminis
tration," he said.
"It's always difficult to close something," Freiden
rich added. The last University departmental closure oc
curred in 1985, when the Occupational and Physical
Therapy Department at the School of Medicine was
eliminated.
"I don't think it portends a trend of [future] closures
at all," Freidenrich said.
"We clearly are responding to the need to concentrate
our efforts more," Casper said in an interview, adding


Sothy Chhe — Daily
that "we hojx? to put in [the insti
tute's] place a center for develop
ment economics — to do something
new and different that, on the
whole, may lead to innovation.
"From that point of view, (the
closure] may be a gain rather than a
loss," Casper said.
Food Research Prof. Scott Pear
son, director of the institute, said, "I
still remain convinced that it's en
tirely the wrong decision.... The
University will grow to regret what
it's done."
Dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences John Shoven sent
a letter to the institute in November
announcing his recommendation
for closure, based on the findings of
a review committee that investigat
ed the institute last academic year.
The plan was subsequently ap
proved by the Advisory Board of the
Academic Council, Provost Con
doleezza Rice and Casper, who
brought it to the trustees Monday.
"We've had lots of communica
tion with the provost, and the plan Ls
to have the institute remain open
for two years after the current
year," Pearson said.
About 15 students will remain to
finish their doctorates after this
year, in accordance with a promise
made by the University, Pearson
said. The other doctoral candidates
have already transferred to differ
ent departments in the University
or to UC-Berkeley, while the major
ity ' 112 the 40 master's students will
graduate this spring.
The institute's 13 faculty mem
bers are currently negotiating their
status with Law Prof. Robert Weis
ln'tv vice nrovost for faculty re

cruitment and development.
"Nobody's very surprised," said
Eddy Niesten, a second-year food
research doctoral student. The
board's decision "is just a rubber
stamp of what Casper decided. We
already processed the shock a long
time ago."
According to Reneth Mano, a
fiflh-year doctoral student, finish
ing the work for his degree will be
more difficult now that the institute
is officially to close.
"It's definitely going to be more
rushed," Mano said. "There will be
less resources available for me. I'll
just try to work as fast as possible."
Both students said the biggest
obstacle to completing their degrees
will be losing the guidance of the in
stitute's faculty, who «ire spending
much of their time now searching
for new positions.
The trustees also passed a rec
ommendation to combine the Oper
ations Research and Engineering-
Economic Systems Departments,
something faculty within both pro
grams laud as beneficial.
"This is of course very good
news. We've been working for two
years to move us forward to have a
merger that goes beyond simply a
combination of the capabilities of
the two departments," said EES
Prof. James Sweeney, who chairs
the department.
He added that "students will
have enhanced access to the faculty
members now."
Among other things, the newly
created department will vote on a
new name, work to create master's
programs that integrate material
from both departments mul decide
on course offerings for next year.
I n addition, Dean of the School of
Engineering James Gibbons will
choose a new department chair.
"The direction has been clear for

quite some time," said Operations
Research Prof. Dick Cottle, chair of
the department, who saw the bene
fits of the merger as being the cre
ation of a larger, more stable depart
ment from two smaller ones and the
opportunity to bring in new faculty.
Also presented to the board was
part of a plan to upgrade the Uni
versity's automated information
systems using Oracle software.
Systems including the general
ledger, accounting, budgeting and
inventory will have their first over
haul in more than 15 years, Vice
Provost for Institutional Planning
Geoffrey Cox said.
"Many of our systems were writ
ten by Stanford people originally, so
there is no commercial software for
an upgrade," Cox added.
He said the University is shifting
gradually from large-scale main
frame computers to smaller client
servers, which spread out the pro
gramming onto localized machines.
The information systems re
structuring is part of a three-year
budget cut the University has been
making.
"Every manager knows they
need to reduce costs," Cox said.
"Deans especi.'illy are working hard
to do this."
The board's decisions this week
could signal the beginning of a cost
cutting trend to narrow depart
ments, Cox said.
"Both the president and the
provost believe that whatever Stan
ford does, it should do well," he said.
"We are making departments bet
ter. There needs to be a real focus on
improving quality — and it may ex
tend to other academic programs
other than the Food Research Insti
tute."
