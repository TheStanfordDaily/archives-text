## Israeli expert discusses Rabin assassination 
### Amy Slucter Staff writer 
Ehud Sprinzak now knows he should have
heeded the warning while there still was time.
Two months before Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated at a peace
rally in Tel Aviv, he received a call from a stu
dent warning him that the radical right was
planning to assassinate the prime minister,
Sprinzak told a crowd of 50 in a noontime ad
dress at the Hoover Institution.
Sprinzak, a political science professor at
Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said he was
wrong not to react more decisively to this call.

Rabin's assassination, he said, was both pre
dictable and preventable.
"When I went to the peace rally I could not
believe that a Jew would kill another Jew. I
think this is also what happened to the Israeli
security forces," Sprinzak said. "We could not
believe that assassination was a concrete pos
sibility. This was the blunder that led to the as
sassination. It was predictable, it was pre
ventable, but it wasn't prevented. I think I will
stop here," he said.
The speech, titled, "The Inside Story of
Yitzhak Rabin's Assassination," was co-spon
sored by the Hoover Institution, the History
Department and the American Friends of He

brew University.
Sprinzak's speech, delivered to an older
crowd, was one in a series of lunchtime presen
tations.
Larry Diamond, a senior research fellow at
Hoover, said Sprinzak was invited to speak be
cause he is one of the most respected political
scientists in Israel. According to Diamond,
Sprinzak has been a major contributor to the
movement to reform Israeli politics.
"He is the leading expert in Israel on the re
lationship between religion, politics and vio
lence," Diamond said, motioning to Sprinzak.
"He says this is because he is the only expert in
Israel on the relationship between religion,
politics and violence."
Sprinzak said he has long sensed that Israel
would have to make its way down a bumpy
road. In order to address the rising stress in Is
rael, published a 1993 report called, "The Pos
sibility of Civil War in Israel."
In the report he identified three different
paths that Israel could take for the future: civil
war, pact between the government and the op
position or a middle ground where some vio
lence continued without escalating into civil
war. Political assassination was not an option
he considered, Sprinzak said.
"I felt that the government and the opposi
tion should agree to rules of engagement to re
duce the tensions," Sprinzak said.
This sort of agreement, however, was not
reached. Instead, Sprinzak said, tensions
began to rise in response to Arab terrorism.
"What turned the settler communities into
bitter and angry people was Arab terrorism,"
Sprinzak said. "It was the impact of seeing peo
ple killed and losing faith in the power of the
government and the military to protect them."
According to Sprinzak, the countdown to
the assassination began in the summer of 1994
in response to this terrorism. At this point, he
said, the hostility of the extreme right began to
focus on the personalities involved. Rabin was
particularly vulnerable.
However, Sprinzak said most people did not
want to see the "Hero of 1967," as Rabin is
sometimes called, dead. The horror of this
event, according to Sprinzak, has changed the
tone of political discourse in Israel.
"The language is not the same language
anymore," Sprinzak said. He pointed out
that as a political scientist he is in the prac
tice of predicting the past but that he believes
that the probability of more extremism is un
likely.
