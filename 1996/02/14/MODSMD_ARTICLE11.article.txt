# A 						capella accolades: Groups sweep contest
## 
### Bobby Chen Staff writer 
The University's renowned a cappella
groups demonstrated Saturday the same
dominance over its rival across the Bay that
the football team did in Big Game.
In the West Coast regional competition of
the first annual National Championship of
College A Cappella, Stanford's Fleet Street
Singers, Talisman and Harmonics managed
to sweep all three of the award categories that
were presented.
Fleet Street won best overall group perfor
mance, earning a trip to New York to compete
in the national finals, sponsored by the Con
temporary A Cappella Society of America and
hosted by the Yale Whiffenpoofs, the oldest —
and, many believe, the best — collegiate a cap
pella group.
Fleet Street will sing with four other re
gional champions on April 14 at Avery Fisher
Hall in Lincoln Center.
"We went to a party afterwards, and
Berkeley was very bitter," said Fleet Street
member Rob Morris, a senior majoring in
computer science.
Krystal Evans and Natausha Wilson of
Talisman captured first place in the best
soloist category for "Back to Life," with the
runner-up award going to Zareen Poonen of
the Harmonics for "Change in My Life."
Fleet Street was also awarded best
arrangement for "Duran Duran," while Tal
isman came in second for their rendition of
"Homeless." Talisman was also the runner
up for best overall group performance.
"It was a really great show, and the audi
ence was amazing," Morris said. "Everyone

felt that they did well."
The regional competition was held Satur
day in Wheeler Hall on the UC-Berkeley cam
pus. Stanford's a cappella groups competed
with Berkeley's Men's Octet, Golden Over
tones and Artists in Resonance.

cappella competitions on
the collegiate level, since
we usually don't get too
much interaction between
groups.'

Each group was given 15 minutes to give
its best performance, and a panel of three
judges from professional a cappella groups
evaluated them on four criteria: musicality,
presentation, originality and solos.
Fleet Street business manager Mark
Dixon, a junior in industrial engineering, said
the main reward for the group was realizing
the sense of teamwork and cooperation that
had gone into their performance.
"We worked hard to polish our set and to
make sure we had the energy that we want
ed," he said. "After we finished our set, we all
realized that everyone came through for each

other. It was the highlight of our evening."
"We were very happy coming off the
stage," Morris added. "Even if we hadn't won
the award, we had crushed the limits on what
we were capable of and what we could do as a
group."
Both Morris and Dixon agreed that the
sense of competition motivated the a cappella
groups to do well rather than just trying to
beat the other groups.
"Not many felt it was a competition but an
incentive to do the best we could and to strive
for some new stuff," Morris said. "It was real
ly awesome, and the audience loved it."
"It's good to have some a cappella competi
tions on the collegiate level, since we usually
don't get too much interaction between
groups," he added.
Dixon said Fleet Street will use its upcom
ing Feb. 21 performance in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium to prepare for the national competi
tion.
"We have more time to sing when we per
form in New York," he said, "so it will give us
a chance to try out our extended set of songs
in front of a large audience."
Dixon added that he is happy to see the
amount of progress that Stanford a cappella
groups are making in terms of teamwork and
quality of performance.
"It's nice to see Stanford a cappella pro
gressing as it is," he said. "Many other
schools have a cappella groups that have
been around twice as long as our groups,
but they don't have the same drive that we
do.
"The a cappella community is beginning to
establish itself, and this is one more step on
the wav," he added.
