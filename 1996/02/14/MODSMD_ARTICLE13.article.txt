## Dole hits New Hampshire Weak win in Iowa makes it do or die time 
### 
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - lowa
sent Bob Dole to New Hampshire
as a teetering front-runner in a
dramatically refigured Republi
can presidential race. With Pat
Buchanan and Lamar Alexander
the new threats to topple him,
Dole sought refuge in New Hamp
shire's version of the ideological
center.
The stakes in the week to come
couldn't be higher for Dole.
After a weak win in lowa,
where he was heavily favored,
most Republicans not involved in
the race said Dole still was best
positioned to win the nomination.
But many were hedging their bets.
To those holding this view,
Buchanan is too flawed, and con
troversial, a candidate to win the
nomination. And despite a boost
from his third-place lowa show
ing, Alexander is short of money
and has little organization beyond
New Hampshire, meaning he
probably gets one shot at Dole.
"My feeling has been that
these moves on Dole have been
too little, too late," said GOP poll
ster Ed Goeas, who is neutral in
the presidential race. "That still

may be the case, but lowa opened
the door a little bit."
Hoping to slam it shut, Dole
arrived in New Hampshire mak
ing the case he was the candidate
of "tested values" and as such the
GOP's best hope in November.
"Whoever wins next Tuesday in
New Hampshire will probably be
the Republican nominee to run
against President Clinton," Dole
said.
That line will come back to
haunt the Senate majority leader
if he loses here, but Dole would be
hard-pressed to survive a New
Hampshire defeat anyway.
So he had barely arrived in
New Hampshire from lowa when
he labeled Alexander a liberal,
hardly a kind word in Republican
primaries. The Dole camp was
reviewing an ad script that criti
cized tax increases during Alexan
der's tenure as Tennessee gover
nor and said his record on crime
was open to criticism, too.
And with Buchanan viewed as
a serious threat to win here next
Tuesday, Dole prepared a new ad
calling Buchanan an extremist, a
tag that Democrats generally

apply to the former White House
hand and TV commentator.
"The microscope goes on
Buchanan now," said New Hamp
shire Republican Rep. Bill Zeliff,
Dole's New Hampshire chairman.
As Dole and his top challengers
reworked their strategies, they
had to take into account the depar
ture of one candidate — Texas
Sen. Phil Gramm — and the
uncertainty surrounding another
— publishing heir Steve Forbes.
Gramm pulled the plug on his
New Hampshire campaign day
and headed back to Washington,
and by nightfall had decided to
quit the race, according to Repub
lican sources.
For months, Dole viewed
Gramm as his biggest threat.
Now, ironically, Dole could suf
fer from a Gramm departure. The
Texas senator is struggling in
New Hampshire but what little
support he has is concentrated
among gun enthusiasts — votes
likely to go Buchanan's way if
Gramm exits.
Forbes canceled his New
Hampshire stop yesterday, too,
but was due back todav.
