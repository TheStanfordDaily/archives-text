# Alexander, Buchanan need money
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Lamar
Alexander worked the telephones yester
day for more donations — a stark
reminder that his strong showing in
lowa, like Pat Buchanan's, will be short
lived without an infusion of cold, hard
cash.
The surprising 2-3 finish of Buchanan
and Alexander in lowa's caucuses Mon
day night was the product of months of
inexpensive, door-to-door campaigning.
But that luxury quickly disappears in the
flurry of primaries that follow.
Reaching voters after next week's New
Hampshire primary will take lots of
money — something Buchanan and
Alexander had little enough of even
before lowa.

Alexander, who ended 1995 with
$600,000 to spend, told 250 supporters in
a telephone conference yesterday he needs
each of them to raise $5,000 by Friday.
"In the past, you could capitalize on a
good (Iowa) showing by spending a few
weeks raising money," said Steve
Salinore, a Rutgers University professor
who studies the impact of money on poli
tics. "They can't do that now. The prob
lem is that we're moving from the retail
states of lowa and New Hampshire into
the wholesale states of Florida and Cali
fornia."
To make matters worse, two of their
rivals have plenty of money to spend —
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole finished
1995 with $4.3 million in the bank, and

multimillionaire publisher Steve Forbes
is determined to forge on with his relent
less advertising campaign despite a
fourth-place finish in lowa.
None of this is lost on Mel Sembler, a
Tampa shopping center developer who is
raising money for Alexander.
"If you're not going to send me a check
for $5,000, I can't stay on the phone
long," Sembler said yesterday. "But mark
my words — we're going to put $2.6 mil
lion in the bank next week, take a breath,
and do it all over again."
For Buchanan, money is harder to
come by. His overall total for 1995 was
just $6.7 million — or less than half of the
$16 million Texas Sen. Phil Gramm
raised last year.
