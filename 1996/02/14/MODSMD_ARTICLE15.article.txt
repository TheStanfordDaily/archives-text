# Sending two Bosnian Serbs to war crimes court was risky, Serb leader says
## Bosnian peace in jeopardy once again 
### 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — A Serb leader warned yesterday
that NATO and the Bosnian govern
ment risked a dangerous backlash by
sending two Bosnian Serbs off to a war
crimes court. A worried NATO shut its
liaison office in the Bosnian Serb
stronghold of Pale.
Peace efforts stumbled further yes
terday as German diplomats failed to
resolve sharp Muslim-Croat differences
over the divided city of Mostar.
The two Serb officers, Gen. Djordje
Djukic and Col. Aleksa Krsmanovic,
were taken from a Sarajevo jail Monday
and down in an American NATO plane
to the Netherlands for further investiga
tion into war crimes charges first raised
by the Bosnian government.

Zorari Lilic, president of Serb-led
Yugoslavia, denounced the extradition
yesterday, saying it would make Bosnian
Serbs distrust both the war crimes tri
bunal in The Hague and the NATO-led
troops trying to enforce peace in Bosnia.
Other Bosnian Serb leaders called the
transfer illegal.
"We are only one step from some
more dangerous reaction or incident,"
Lilic was quoted as saying by
Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agen
cy.
Fearing possible retaliation, the
NATO-led force shut down its liaison
office in Pale. "We are taking no
chances, just precautions," said
spokesman Lt. Col. Charles-Henri de
Noirmont, who would not say how many

troops were involved.
It was all part of the worsening ties
between NATO troops and the Serbs,
who broke off relations after govern
ment police arrested the two Serb offi
cers Jan. 30.
NATO spokesman Col. John Kirk
wood could not name a single instance
yesterday of recent contact between
senior Serb authorities and NATO offi
cials. Bosnian Serbs were also absent
from a Vienna meeting mediated on
reducing arms of the former warring fac
tions.
The two Serb officers have not been
indicted. Tribunal spokesman Christian
Chartier said yesterday a decision on
whether or not to charge them with war
crimes will be made "within weeks."
