Wages barely rise
WASHINGTON (AP) - The wages
and benefits paid American workers rose
just 2.9 percent last year, the smallest
increase on record and fresh fuel for the
unhappiness of a middle class convinced
it is falling behind.
The biggest factor was restraint in
health care and other benefits, though they
were rising more quickly as the year ended.
The Labor Department said yesterday
the increase in its Employment Cost
Index was down from 3 percent in 1994
and the smallest since the government
began recording annual changes in 1982.
The gain barely kept worker compen
sation ahead of inflation. The Consumer
Price Index rose 2.5 percent last year.
Businesses concerned about maintain
ing profits are keeping employee costs
under close control and "basically labor is
not in a position to argue," said Robert G.
Dederick, economic consultant for the
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
Overall job growth has been slow, and
many companies have been downsizing,
giving workers little leverage to seek
increased wages and benefits.
"This tells the American worker that
he's not sharing in the nation's produc
tivity growth," said John Zalusky, an
economist with the AFL-CIO. "He's bare

ly keeping up with cost of living."
Hanks denied third chance
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) - Tom
Hanks' spaceship made it back safely to
Earth. His Oscar chances perished on re
entry.
The "Apollo 13" star failed in his bid
for a record-setting third consecutive lead
acting Oscar. Hanks' omission made
some sense — the "Forrest Gump" star
said himself that his part in the ensemble
wasn't Oscar-worthy — but other over
sights yesterday were more puzzling.
While the makers of "Braveheart" and
"The Postman" celebrated their Oscar
nomination haul, several other filmmak
ers wondered how 5,043 Academy mem
bers voted the way they did.
Aside from "Apollo 13," international
themes and movies dominated, and four
of the five best-picture nominees
appeared during the summer or earlier.
Also, only five of the '20 acting nominees
had received Academy recognition before.
Mel Gibson learned of his Oscar nomina
tion for directing "Braveheart" while acting
on the set of "Hansom," where he was being
directed by none other than Ron Howard.
"He didn't (get nominated) which sur
prised me because everything else did,"
Gibson said.
