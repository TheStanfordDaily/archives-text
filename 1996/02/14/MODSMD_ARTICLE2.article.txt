# Concern for Stanford's affordability leads to smallest increase in decades
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Approving its lowest tuition increase in
decades, the Board of Trustees announced a
4 percent rise in both tuition and room and
board yesterday.
However, while the tuition rise is lower
than previous years, the increase in room and
board fees is .2 percent greater than last
year's 3.8 percent increase.
The increases, passed at the trustees'
quarterly meeting, makes tuition $20,490 —
topping $20,000 for the first time. With room
and board, the total bill for undergraduates
will be $27,827.
"This is the lowest increase as long as I can
remember, only 1 percent over the cost of in
flation," said John Freidenrich, the board's
chair.
Vice Provost for Institutional Planning
Geoffrey Cox said several factors influenced
the size of the increase.
"First, tuition is driven by inflation — we
always have to look at how much costs are ris

ing because everything is subject to infla
tion," said Cox.
Tuition increases have always stayed
above a 3 percent inflation rate but have
dropped over the past four years. Tuition
rose 9.5 percent in 1992, 7.5 percent in 1993
and 5 percent in 1994. The board increased
tuition last year by 5.5 percent.
Higher education has been facing a tighter
fiscal environment in the past few years —
part of the reason tuition has risen so much
recently. It covers slightly more than half of
Stanford's unrestricted revenue, about 60
percent of the University's discretionary
funds.
Even under these circumstances, Cox said
the trustees felt a smaller increase was possi
ble, based on the University's efforts to con
tain its growth. In recent years, Stanford has
instituted new budget systems and searched
for more efficient ways of doing business.
"Our tuition decrease obviously reflects
our very serious concern about tuition in-
crease," said University President
Gerhard Casper. "(Increases at)
Stanford have, in relation to its
peers, actually been rather moder
ate. It is not at the top by any
means when it comes to tuition in
creases."
Sharp jumps in tuition al col
leges and universities across the
country have led to worries that
higher education will soon be unaf
fordohle for most families.

hveryone shares concerns
about keeping Stanford afford
able," said Cox. "There are re
straints, and we don't want to sac
rifice the financial health of the
University, but the trustees are
supportive -- no one wants Stan
ford to be unaffordable."
Council of Presidents member
Mike Choo, a student representa
tive to the board, said he was
pleased with the small increase.
"After several years of increases
that were 2 to 3 percent above in
flation, we finally have an increase
t hat takes into account the needs of
families," ('boo said.

Another concern is that, as tu
ition rises, the demand for financial
aid necessarily rises as well.
"Stanford needs to constantly
review its commitment to parents
and students to need-blind admis
sions," Choo said.
The University takes the in
creased need for financial aid as a
given, Cox said.
"Because tuition goes into unre
stricted revenue, we have to care
fully determine where our money
will go," he said. "We'll spend less
on something like salaries and
more on financial aid — which is
our highest priority."
