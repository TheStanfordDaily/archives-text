Approving its lowest tuition increase in
decades, the Board of Trustees announced a
4 percent rise in both tuition and room and
board yesterday.
However, while the tuition rise is lower
than previous years, the increase in room and
board fees is .2 percent greater than last
year's 3.8 percent increase.
The increases, passed at the trustees'
quarterly meeting, makes tuition $20,490 —
topping $20,000 for the first time. With room
and board, the total bill for undergraduates
will be $27,827.
"This is the lowest increase as long as I can

Geoffrey Cox said several factors influenced
the size of the increase.
"First, tuition is driven by inflation — we
always have to look at how much costs are ris

Tuition increases have always stayed
above a 3 percent inflation rate but have
dropped over the past four years. Tuition
rose 9.5 percent in 1992, 7.5 percent in 1993
and 5 percent in 1994. The board increased
tuition last year by 5.5 percent.
Higher education has been facing a tighter
fiscal environment in the past few years —
part of the reason tuition has risen so much
recently. It covers slightly more than half of
Stanford's unrestricted revenue, about 60
percent of the University's discretionary
funds.
Even under these circumstances, Cox said
the trustees felt a smaller increase was possi
ble, based on the University's efforts to con
tain its growth. In recent years, Stanford has
instituted new budget systems and searched
for more efficient ways of doing business.
"Our tuition decrease obviously reflects
our very serious concern about tuition in-
