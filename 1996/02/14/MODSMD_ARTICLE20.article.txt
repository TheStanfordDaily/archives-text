## Editorial Expanding escorts

The University should
consider offering rides
later into the morning

ON STANFORD'S VAST
campus, dotted with numer
ous dark streets and paths,
students — especially female stu
dents — have a justified fear of
walking home alone at night.
SURE, the student-run escort ser
vice, ensures that these students do
not have to walk home alone.
Improvements in SURE occurred
this year. The University took over
responsibility for the program —
previously funded by ASSU special
fees — and allocated it $50,000. In
addition, SURE extended its hours;
the escort service now closes at 2
a.m. instead of at 1 a.m.
These improvements are steps in
the right direction, but unfortu
nately, they are not enough to
ensure the safety of students facing
lonesome walks across the campus
after 2 a.m. SURE Escort should
address the needs of these students
and experiment with providing
escorts until sunrise.
By establishing the SURE pro
gram, the University community
has determined that an escort
service on campus is needed dur
ing the night. There is no reason
why such a service should arbi
trarily close at 2 a.m. On a cam
pus with over 14,000 students,
some are,bound not to be at their
respective homes by 2 a.m. Dur
ing the weekdays, undergradu
ates find themselves studying
into the wee hours at the homes
of friends or in the 24-hour study
rooms, and many graduate stu
dents find themselves working
past 2 a.m. in a physics or engi
neering lab. On weekends, many
public and private parties last
until past 2 a.m.
Many students working or
socializing past 2 a.m. depend
upon friends to walk or drive them

home, but friends are not always
available because they are sleep
ing, studying or working. In addi
tion, unplanned circumstances
sometimes arise — especially on
weekends or at parties — and stu
dents need a safe, reliable way to
get home, even after 2 a.m.
Although the Stanford campus
can be considered a relatively safe
area, and somewhat isolated from
the real world, it is not without its
dangers. The campus is located
near some of the highest crime
areas in the country. The various
reports made to the Stanford Police
of men stalking or following women
prove that Stanford is not immune
from late-night safety concerns. In
addition, the crimes of the Peninsu
la serial rapist demonstrate the
need for all-night rape prevention
services.
SURE Escort should therefore
experiment with extending its
hours until sunrise for a temporary
period of time. The service will then
be able to determine the demand
for an escort service after 2 a.m. on
particular days of the week and at
different times during the quarter.
If SURE discovers that many stu
dents need an escort service until
sunrise on weekends, SURE should
extend its hours until sunrise on
weekends. Likewise, if SURE
determines that the service is not in
demand past 4 a.m. on weekdays, it
should only extend its hours until 4
a.m.
Because SURE Escort is a stu
dent-run service, finding escorts to
work for the early-morning hours
may be difficult. The University
should increase funding for the
escort service to pay students who
work late into the night higher
salaries or to hire full-time employ
ees to work until sunrise.
Once the University community
has determined that an escort ser
vice is necessary, it is both arbitrary
and unreasonable for that service
to end at 2 a.m. Service should be
continued if there is, in fact, a
demand for it. Whatever dangers
lurk prior to 2 a.m. continue to lurk
afterwards.
