Housing and dining director says costs have been cut

THE DAILY'S Jan. 31 editorial
titled "The Time Has Come" call
ing on the provost to conduct a
promised assessment of Housing and
Dining Services was full of inferences
and inaccuracy. I find it disturbing that
The Daily preferred to rely on assump
tions instead of facts that could have
been gathered if someone had taken the
time to ask me or anyone else on my staff
any questions related to these issues.
Housing and Dining Services was
described as a revenue-generating orga
nization within the University. What
was not explained is what exactly that
means. Housing and Dining Services is
one of several auxiliary operations at
Stanford. In that capacity, we (and the
other auxiliaries) generate revenues only
to meet our expenses. The main sources
of our revenue are room rents, board
charges and conference revenues. H&DS
receives no funding from the Universi
ty's general funds. Also, H&DS is not a
"profit center" for the University. Its
revenues are necessary to meet its own
expenses in support of housing and din
ing programs for Stanford students in
both the short- and long-range.
The editorial also questioned what
efforts H&DS has made as part of the
University's overall effort to reduce costs.
While budget cuts in auxiliaries do not
directly help the University meet its gen
eral funds-based financial problems,

H&DS has not been exempted from bud
get cuts. Quite the contrary; since 1990
the combined base operating budgets of
H&DS (including Residential Education)
were cut $5.2 million in two budget
reduction processes. These savings result
ed in lower room and board rates and
increases in H&DS reserves to help
finance the long-term financial require
ments of the Capital Improvement Plan,
which is now in its fourth successful year.
Parts of H&DS reduced their operat
ing budgets by as much as 38 percent as
a result of budget cutting. Additionally,
staff efficiency and productivity
increased through changes in organiza
tional structures in every unit of the
department. Some examples: Regular
evening and weekend maintenance ser
vice was established to reduce the high
cost of after hours call-backs. Dining ser
vice unit staffs reduced costs and created
efficiencies by consolidating service on
weekends and at other low-participation
serving times. Middle management posi
tions were eliminated. Facilities staffs
were not increased as they normally
would have been even though two new
residences (with 400 beds) were added to
the student housing system. Processes
were streamlined and systems automat
ed wherever possible to reduce costs.
Efficiencies in utility and energy use
were realized. Outside vendor contracts
were renegotiated to increase savings.

Staff throughout the entire department
have assumed greater work loads to hold
costs down.
Additionally, and as a direct result of
the budget reduction plan, H&DS rev
enue growth was slowed by holding
increases in room and board below infla
tion in the two years following these
budget reductions. Since then, the goal
for the combined rate of growth in room
and board has been to hold increases to
1 percent above inflation. In 1993-94
and 1995-96, H&DS rate increases were
actually below that level. These changes
have impacted our service delivery in
exactly the same way budget cuts impact
general funded budgets: Goods and ser
vices continue to cost more but revenues
remain relatively constant. Thus, since
these changes were implemented H&DS
managers and staff have been forced (as
have other parts of the University) to
find ways to work smarter, more effi
ciently, and with greater productivity.
Will room and board rates continue to
increase? They most likely will. The man
agers and staff throughout H&DS con
tinue to work hard to provide the quality
of service necessary to support students
as they pursue their academic careers.
Simply maintaining programs and ser
vices at current levels will cost more
because of inflation and pressures from
the marketplace in which we operate. We
will continue to seek ways to reduce

operating expenses where possible.
Improvements in our facilities, sup
port services and dining program beyond
the status quo will mean costs higher
than inflation. The CIP has detailed a
12-year program of renovations and new
construction which relies on healthy sys
tem reserve balances and increases in
the combined room and board rate of 1
percent above inflation over the period.
These improvements, which are long
overdue and badly needed, are only
affordable through our ability to pay the
cost of borrowing the funds to do the
work.
A review of the H&DS operation and
its financial structure, as suggested in
The Daily's editorial, would nonetheless
be useful in helping us continue to
improve the provision of ongoing ser
vices and new initiatives which are part
of both our long-range strategic and cap
ital plans. We welcome the organization
al improvement opportunities which
might result from such a review.
Let me finally say that the nearly 300
staff members who are part of H&DS
work very hard to provide services for
Stanford students. We continue to seek
and make improvements in quality, ser
vice and productivity both in the way we
provide daily service and in our long
range CIP.
