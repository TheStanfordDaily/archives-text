# Stolen-food headline misleading, KA says
## 
### 
Reading Monday's Daily I was shocked
to see the headline "Tree Chases Alleged
KA Thieves." I was alarmed that one of
my brothers had been involved in a crime,
but I quickly realized that the article had
nothing to do with us whatsoever. No one
involved is in any way related to our order,
although the incident did occur at 664

Lomita, the former KA house. Returning
to 664 is an important short-term goal of
our chapter, but the University has yet to
inform us that our house is once again
ours. If The Daily knows otherwise, please
let us know; our rent is probably overdue
and we'd hate to start on the wrong foot.
Lastly, I would note that we are over
joyed with our current cuisine and have
no plans to steal food while Jack in the
Box remains open 24 hours.
