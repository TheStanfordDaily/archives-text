## An affirmative-action baby 
### 
I'M A WHITE male from suburbia and I
am a beneficiary of Stanford's most
potent affirmative-action program. My
father attended Stanford and, as a
birthright, my chances of admission to this
prestigious institution were doubled. If
your parents weren't lucky enough to go
here (and maybe they didn't even have a
snowflake's chance in hell of going here
because of their skin color or income level)
you had a 19 percent chance of being
allowed through Stanford's hallowed gates.
I had a 40 percent chance.
Not surprisingly, I'm not alone. There
are heaps of underqualified, unprepared
legacies wandering around this bucolic
campus. According to our admissions office,
14 percent of your classmates are legacies
and at least three-quarters of them are
white. Run these numbers through a trusty
calculator and you'll find that approximate
ly 6 percent of each freshman class consists
of white students who would not have got
ten in here if it weren't for their birth-right.
That's nearly as large as Stan ford's entire
African-American population.
Why does Stanford, along with all its
peers, have this program? The traditional
argument is that it increases alumni
donations. Taking this policy one step fur
ther, we should simply mail out diplomas
to these underqualified children of afflu
ent alums. Stanford would gain because it
would not have its U.S. News and World
Report ranking subverted by paltry SAT

scores; we legacies would gain because we
wouldn't have to serve four years as
inmates in a university beyond our wits.
Stanford could even add incentives to
juice the alumni some more: Give a music
building and your child receives a diplo
ma-by-mail with honors; give a shiny new
football helmet and they can be Phi Beta
Kappa.
The more important question, however,
is why people all over the country are harp
ing about ending racial affirmative action
while ignoring my dubious legacy privilege.
The answer, necessarily simplified, is that
there is a difference between a valid argu
ment and an honest argument. A valid
argument is any argument that is plausible
and possibly defensible; an honest argu
ment stems from one's true motivation.
For example, the first time I ever called
a girl, I asked her for our history home
work. It was plausible that that was what I
really wanted. However, my honest motiva
tion was that I wanted to ask her on a date.
Likewise, when conservative politicians like
Phil Gramm or Pete Wilson argue for the
end of affirmative action (because it leads to
more racial divisions, stigmatizes people of
color, etc.) they are making valid argu
ments, but probably not honest ones.
In 1964, these conservative forces
argued against the Civil Rights Act on the
grounds that it might lead to racial back
lash â€” or a "police state" as Barry Gold
water said. In 1965, they argued against

the Voting Rights Act on the grounds of
federalism. In 1968, they validly argued
against the Open Housing Act. In 1980,
the Reagan administration argued, in the
Bob Jones case, in favor of tax-exempt sta
tus for discriminatory schools on the
grounds (later ridiculed by the Supreme
Court) that the IRS was usurping its
power by meddling too much in private
affairs. Powerful conservatives argued
validly against a Martin Luther King Day
and gave reasonable economic arguments
in favor of Proposition 187. This list could
go on, but I'll spare you. The basic point is
this: Never did anyone, besides perhaps
David Duke, base their argument on the
grounds that people of color were gaining
too much power; however, every time a bill
came up that would increase the power of
people of color, the same people opposed it
on other grounds.
There are reasonable arguments in
favor of ending affirmative action and some
people are making them with a genuine
desire to improve social welfare. However,
the logic behind eliminating race-based
preference and keeping alumni preferences
is too thin to be accepted as honest.
