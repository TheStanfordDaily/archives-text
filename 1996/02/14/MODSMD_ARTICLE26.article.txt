# Romesh Ratnesar: Bread and circus
## A
						new convert's thoughts on the liberal identity crisis 
### 
WIIEN I HAVE been asked the
question, on standardized-test
applications or in casual Coffee
House conversation, "With what group do
you most closely identify?" I normally
select the "other (specify)" option, and
feel a little hollow — mainly because I can
never quite duplicate the simple beauty of
the answer my sister Meera gave to the
same query when she was eight years old.
"You are such a pretty girl," a well-mean
ing woman told her at a properly Anglo-
Saxon holiday party. "What are you? I
mean, what is your nationality?" My sis
ter looked at the stranger. "I'm Ameri
can," she shrugged, and I'm sure no other
response even occurred to her.
I was reminded of that story, well
recounted in family lore, as I listened to
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. speak last week at
Kresge Auditorium. Schlesinger, a
diminutive and aging white man, decried
the pitfalls of academic pluralism, but his
larger point was in essence the same one
my sister made, more parsimoniously,
nearly a decade ago. "We are one people,"
Schlesinger said, "Americans first, woven
into a sinele garment of destinv." Mavbe

Meera can help Schlesinger on his next
book.
The visit of the eminent and septuage
narian Schlesinger, perhaps the most dis
tinguished American historian alive
today, kicked off a superb weekend forum
on "American National Identity / Identi
ties" and his comments inspired many
Stanford liberals, I think, to do a little
soul-searching. Schlesinger's most recent
book is "The Disuniting of America" a
trenchant attack on "militant multicul
turalists" who paddle pluralism past the
worthy goals of intellectual inclusion and
into the treacherous waters of self-sepa
ration and censorship.
To be sure, the specter of yet another
aged, white man condemning aspects of
multiculturalism prompted murmurs of
discontent in the audience, and I noticed a
good deal of folks leave once the question
and-answer period began. But judging
from the rather genteel and approving
discussion of Schlesinger's remarks for
the rest of the conference — which other
wise enthusiastically endorsed multicul
turalism — he struck a chord, if not a raw
nerve. It's one thing to hear conservative

demagogues decry political correctness in
the service of an even more insidious form
of hysterical intolerance. But when the
critic has sound liberal credentials and
asserts in the same breath that "racism is
the great failure of the American experi
ment" and advocates another New (not
Newt) Deal for the country's truly disad
vantaged, the most bleeding heart should
slow a bit, because he may just be right.
To be sure, multiculturalists, militant
or otherwise, aren't trampling over uni
versity campuses any more than black
helicopters are circling Montana dropping
functionaries of the Trilateral Commis
sion into ranchers' backyards. That's my
modest conclusion after four years at
Stanford. I'm not too ashamed to admit
that I was a conservative in high school,
and after digesting Dinesh D'Souza
before my freshman fall, I girded myself
for battle on the right side of the culture
war. Soon after arriving here, I discovered
that there were a lot of people more blood
thirsty than I was, and before long I
found myself enjoying Congolese litera
ture in (TV and standing up as a lonely
defender of hate-speech regulat ion during

one classroom discussion.
In short, the notion that some radical
orthodoxy exists at Stanford, subverting
standards and tearing down tradition, is
the true diversity myth. But I'm less sure
that simply staying the multicultural
course is still the best path for liberals,
even relatively recent converts like me.
While liberals justifiably bemoaned the
parochiality of the canon in the '80s and
'90s, conservatives quietly tightened the
screws of their political and social domi
nance, pushing acceptable public discus
sion in the country so inextricably to the
right that we find today a Democratic
president with re-election in mind talking
about the virtues of balanced budgets and
V-chips and crackdowns on illegal immi
gration. The campus "consensus" that
broadened Stanford's curriculum is fray
ing, too: Students are less concerned,
polls tell us, with community service and
the Comparative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity program than they are with paying
rising bills and avoiding a W on their tran
scripts.
So perhaps it's time for we liberals to
move, as more than a few authors have

suggested, beyond multiculturalism. The
gains in the academic battle against Dead
White Male Studies have been many —
but they have also distracted a good por
tion of the left's considerable resources
from the more immediate and widespread
threats to our schools and our jobs and
our ability to elect leaders who don't have
million-dollar inheritances to burn. It
requires giving devils far worse than
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. their due. It
requires a willingness to set aside the
interests of our various group identities,
at least for another day, and to rediscover
common dreams.
My sister turned 16 in September. It's
a testament to the success of multicultur
alism that she can now respond quite col
orfully to the question posed to her that
Christmas many years ago. I wonder,
though, if she would change her first
answer. I still think it's the right one.
