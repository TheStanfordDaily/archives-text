## Cardinal offense nowhere to be found in 6-3 loss to Dons 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Stanford 3

The sun was shining brightly yesterday
afternoon at San Francisco's Benedetti
Diamond, but not on the second-ranked
Cardinal. Stanford (7-4) lost its second
consecutive non-conference game, falling
to the Dons, 6-3. San Francisco improved
to 7-0, the best start in its history.
Stanford jumped out to a 3-0 lead after
posting three runs in its half of the second
inning. Those were the last highlights for
the Cardinal offense. Stanford managed
only five hits, one of which was for extra
bases.
Senior first baseman Troy Kent drove
in the first run for Stanford, plating
sophomore catcher Jon Schaeffer who had
led off the inning with a double. Junior
Luke Quaccia crossed the plate for the
Cardinal's second run on a fielder's choice
by junior shortstop Eric Sees. Sophomore
right fielder Joe Kilburg capped off the
scoring for the Cardinal, driving in Sees
for Stanford's final run.
Notably absent from the Cardinal line
up once again was senior catcher A.J.
Hinch, who missed yesterday's contest
with a shoulder injury. The Cardinal not
only missed Hinch for his explosive bat,
but also for the effect he has on the oppos

ing team's pitchers.
"It makes a big difference not having
[Hinch] in the lineup," Schaeffer said. "He
is missed not just for his hitting ability,
but for his presence in the lineup — mak
ing pitchers pitch around him."
"We need him back in the lineup,"
Schaeffer added. "He adds so much spark
to the team. He has got so much experi
ence and is a real catalyst on the field."

ite definitely a tough loss
for us. It was over second
loss in a row — we're just
not putting up any runs.'
— Jon Schaeffer

Stanford's starting pitcher, freshman
Chad Hutchinson, tossed four scoreless
innings before being touched up for four
runs in the fifth. A two-run home run off
the bat of first baseman Matt Purkiss was
the big hit of the inning, putting San Fran
cisco in the lead for good.
In his second start of the year, Hutchin
son (0-1) gave up five hits and four runs,
walked two and struck out seven in 5-2/3
innings of work. The freshman was
relieved by junior righty Tom Reimers,
who had been perfect in 1996 before San
Francisco's Brad Marshall slugged a solo
home run to lead off the eighth.

ter field, took the mound in
relief of Dons starter Raymond
Rivera. Marshall and fellow
reliever Joe Nelson held the
Cardinal bats silent from the
third inning through the eighth,
retiring 19 consecutive Stanford
batters.
The Cardinal staged a threat
in the top of the ninth inning,
loading the bases with two outs.
Nelson nailed down the victory,
though, by striking out Sees to
end the game. Nelson struck out
seven in four innings to pick up
his fourth save in four opportu
nities.
Yesterday's loss and lack of
offensive punch came on the
heels of Sunday's 2-1 defeat at

the hands of Santa Clara at
Buck Shaw Stadium. In that
game, the Cardinal put men on
base, but could not get a clutch
hit in tough situations.
"It's definitely a tough loss
for us," Schaeffer said. "It was
our second loss in a row — we're
just not putting up any runs.
We're down, but it's still early in
the season and we will continue
to work hard."
Head coach Mark Marquess
and his squad will take to the
road again this weekend, head
ing to Fresno State for a three
game series with the Bulldogs.
Although the Cardinal has been
on the road often this season,
after February the team will
play 24 of its final 38 games in
the friendly atmosphere of
Sunken Diamond, where the
Cardinal is 3-1 thus far.
