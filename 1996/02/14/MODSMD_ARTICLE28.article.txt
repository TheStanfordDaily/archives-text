# Track and field team looks to build in 1996

### Sam Wang 
With a strong core of returning
veterans and a talented group of
youngsters, head coach Vin
Lananna looks to lead the Stan
ford men's and women's track
and field teams to success this
season.
Emphasizing a team-oriented
philosophy, Lananna will turn to
a variety of athletes for results.
However, the mainstay of both
teams will once again be the
throwers and the middle-distance
runners.
On the women's side, senior
Ail-American Dena Dey, junior
Tyra Holt, redshirt sophomore
Monal Chokshi and freshman
Mary Cobb lead the Stanford
attack with a solid distance med
ley squad. The team has qualified
for the NCAA Indoor Champi
onships, held March 8 and 9, on
the virtues of its performance
during the indoor season.
'All four of them have looked
great for both individual events
and for the relay," said Lananna,
who describes the entire middle
distance corps as "superb."
Dey, voted co-captain of this
year's team, will be looked upon
to provide both leadership and
performance on the track. She
finished second in the 1500
meters at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships last year

and will strive to top off her colle
giate career with similar success.
Another leader of the team will
be junior co-captain Tyra Holt.
This versatile and talented ath
lete will be seen competing in the
long jumps, sprints, the 400-
meter run and the pole vault.
The entire throwing corps
returns this year with senior Sue
Demars and sophomore Sami Jo
Small leading the charge.
Demars, a NCAA qualifier last
year, hopes to score big points for
the Cardinal with her discus toss
es while the javelin-throwing
Small seeks to improve her third
place finish in the Pac-lOs after
only one year of college competi
tion.
The men's team suffered sig
nificant losses with the gradua
tion of NCAA qualifying hammer
throwers David Popejoy and Toby
Norwood and Pac-10 champion
decathlete Travis Clark.
Despite the loss of these three
leaders, Lananna has a pack of
talented and hungry youngsters
who are ready to step into the
limelight. Leading the pack will
be a pair of hammer throwers in
sophomore Adam Connolly and
junior Justin Strand, both of
whom have scored points in Pac
-10 Championships.
