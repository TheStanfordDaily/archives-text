# Track and field team looks to build in 1996
## 
### Sam Wang 
With a strong core of returning
veterans and a talented group of
youngsters, head coach Vin
Lananna looks to lead the Stan
ford men's and women's track
and field teams to success this
season.
Emphasizing a team-oriented
philosophy, Lananna will turn to
a variety of athletes for results.
However, the mainstay of both
teams will once again be the
throwers and the middle-distance
runners.
On the women's side, senior
Ail-American Dena Dey, junior
Tyra Holt, redshirt sophomore
Monal Chokshi and freshman
Mary Cobb lead the Stanford
attack with a solid distance med
ley squad. The team has qualified
for the NCAA Indoor Champi
onships, held March 8 and 9, on
the virtues of its performance
during the indoor season.
'All four of them have looked
great for both individual events
and for the relay," said Lananna,
who describes the entire middle
distance corps as "superb."
Dey, voted co-captain of this
year's team, will be looked upon
to provide both leadership and
performance on the track. She
finished second in the 1500
meters at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships last year

and will strive to top off her colle
giate career with similar success.
Another leader of the team will
be junior co-captain Tyra Holt.
This versatile and talented ath
lete will be seen competing in the
long jumps, sprints, the 400-
meter run and the pole vault.
The entire throwing corps
returns this year with senior Sue
Demars and sophomore Sami Jo
Small leading the charge.
Demars, a NCAA qualifier last
year, hopes to score big points for
the Cardinal with her discus toss
es while the javelin-throwing
Small seeks to improve her third
place finish in the Pac-lOs after
only one year of college competi
tion.
The men's team suffered sig
nificant losses with the gradua
tion of NCAA qualifying hammer
throwers David Popejoy and Toby
Norwood and Pac-10 champion
decathlete Travis Clark.
Despite the loss of these three
leaders, Lananna has a pack of
talented and hungry youngsters
who are ready to step into the
limelight. Leading the pack will
be a pair of hammer throwers in
sophomore Adam Connolly and
junior Justin Strand, both of
whom have scored points in Pac
-10 Championships.

The 1996 track and field team will have to fill the
shoes of the departed Toby Norwood.
son, who moonlights as the start
ing defensive tackle on the foot
ball team, will also contribute
with his shot-putting ability.
Swanson is still recovering from a
broken foot suffered during last
year's outdoor season, but he
should be ready soon.
Even though all signs point to
another strong year in the
throws, Lananna cautioned
against raising expectations too
high, too soon.
"It's very difficult in those
events to come in right away,"
Lananna said. "We have some
very good young athletes, but it's
tough to step right in."

'We have the ability
to make our pres
ence known more
with depth than in
up-front performance.'

One athlete who will have to
shoulder high expectations is 400-
meter runner Rene Rodriguez.
Molding the school record in the
400 meters with a time of 45.85,
the All-American Rodriguez
returns for his third season after
redshirting the 1995 season with
a hamstring injury. He has been
held out for all of the indoor sea
son in anticipation of the out
doors and according to Lananna,
Rodriguez "should be a big impact
guy."
Also hoping to make a strong
impact for the men's team are the
middle distance runners. The dis
tance medley team of senior co
captain Mark Fadil, junior Jimmie
Johnson, freshman Jake Maas
and sophomore-transfer Jason
Lunn has looked impressive dur
ing the indoor season and will be
counted upon to score points.
Both the men's and women's

teams will be facing tough compe
tition in the Pac-10 outdoor sea
son, with perennial powers UCIjV
and Oregon remaining at the
head of the class. But Lananna is
hopeful of his squad's chances
this year because of the team's
abundance of talent.

"We have the ability to make
our presence known more with
depth than in up-front perfor
mances," he said. "Perhaps you
won't see us with a lot of firsts,
but you'll see us with a lot of
thirds, fourths and fifths, and that
will be the key to our success."

Senior Jackie Bridgeman will look to improve on last year's perfor
mances in the long jump and heptathlon.
