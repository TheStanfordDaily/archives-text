Kate Starbird
Kate Starbird led the Stanford women's hoops team to
two victories over the weekend. On Friday, Starbird
poured in 29 points in pacing the Cardinal to a 77-54
rout of USC. On Sunday, Starbird added 19 points in a
nail-biting victory against UCLA 61-59. It was Starbird's
defense that made the difference, though, as she forced a
steal to ice the win over the Bruins.

Ryan Wolters
It is not often that an athlete gets featured for losing
his or her game the previous week. Ryan Wolters deserves
recognition, however, for the manner in which he handled
his 6-2, 6-2 loss to Andre Agassi on Monday night at the
Sybase Open. In the face of an arrogant and rude Agassi,
Wolters handled his first match in a professional tourna
ment with grace, humility, and a sense of humor.
