At a groundbreaking ceremony for the new
Schwab Residential Center yesterday, Univer
sity leaders emphasized the "interaction" the
facility will provide for graduate students.
The noontime affair was attended by about
100 people, including alumnus Charles
Schwab and his wife, Helen, who provided the
lead gift for the $28.3 million center which will
house both graduate students and participants
in the Graduate School of Business' executive
education programs.
Schwab obtained both his bachelor's and
MBA degrees from Stanford in 1959 and

1961, respectively. The founder of Charles
Schwab, Inc., a brokerage firm based in San
Francisco, he is also a member of the Board of
Trustees.
Speaking at the ceremony, University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper said, "This is a very
great occasion." He stressed the role of the cen
ter in facilitating informal interactions among
students.
The project will be completed in late spring
or early summer 1997, said Cathy Castillo, the
Business School's director of news and publi
cations. The center will be located at the corner
of Campus Drive East and Serra Street, replac
ing the last of the Manzanita Park trailers.
A. Michael Spence, dean of the Business

School, similarly emphasized the total educa
tional experience the residence will provide,
calling it a "living and learning center."
The 158,000-square-foot complex will in
clude 280 one-bedroom suites, each with a pri
vate bath. Every two rooms will share a kitch
enette. The center will feature many indoor
and outdoor lounge areas to improve interac
tion among residents and to house education
al and social programs. Facilities will include
small rooms for group study and meetings,
computer clusters, dining areas and a library.
The complex will be fully networked on Stan
ford's ethernet system.
The center will house partici
pants in the executive education
programs, during which business
professionals come to Stanford in
the summer to learn new manage
ment strategies. In past years,
many participants expressed dis
pleasure at being housed in under
graduate dormitories during their
stays. The complex will also pro
vide more flexibility for executive
education programs held during
the school year.
The new residence will help re
lieve the shortage of graduate stu
dent housing on campus. Business
school students will have first pri
ority over other graduate stu
dents, said Castillo.
In praising the center, Spence
lauded the architect, Ricardo
Legorreta of Mexico City, for the
"application of his extraordinary
genius." Legorreta has designed
hotels, museums and conference
centers, receiving in 1992 the Na
tional Award of Fine Arts in Mexi
co and the Architect of the Ameri
cas Prize.
The building will be designed in
the image of the California mis
sions constructed in the 18th and
19th centuries, Casper said.
For his part, Schwab stressed
the " responsibility that we all have
to share with an institution that
means so much to us."
Roth Casper and Spence took
the chance to thank the other
donors as well.
"The school and University are
enormously grateful to you," said
Spence, adding that the new cen
ter will further the goal of making
the Business School the best
school of management in the
world.
