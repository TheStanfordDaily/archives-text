At a groundbreaking ceremony for the new
Schwab Residential Center yesterday, Univer
sity leaders emphasized the "interaction" the
facility will provide for graduate students.
The noontime affair was attended by about
100 people, including alumnus Charles
Schwab and his wife, Helen, who provided the
lead gift for the $28.3 million center which will
house both graduate students and participants
in the Graduate School of Business' executive
education programs.
Schwab obtained both his bachelor's and
MBA degrees from Stanford in 1959 and

1961, respectively. The founder of Charles
Schwab, Inc., a brokerage firm based in San
Francisco, he is also a member of the Board of
Trustees.
Speaking at the ceremony, University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper said, "This is a very
great occasion." He stressed the role of the cen
ter in facilitating informal interactions among
students.
The project will be completed in late spring
or early summer 1997, said Cathy Castillo, the
Business School's director of news and publi
cations. The center will be located at the corner
of Campus Drive East and Serra Street, replac
ing the last of the Manzanita Park trailers.
A. Michael Spence, dean of the Business

School, similarly emphasized the total educa
tional experience the residence will provide,
calling it a "living and learning center."
The 158,000-square-foot complex will in
clude 280 one-bedroom suites, each with a pri
vate bath. Every two rooms will share a kitch
enette. The center will feature many indoor
and outdoor lounge areas to improve interac
tion among residents and to house education
al and social programs. Facilities will include
small rooms for group study and meetings,
computer clusters, dining areas and a library.
The complex will be fully networked on Stan
ford's ethernet system.
