# Hail to the Cardinal!
## Stanford outclasses UCLA in win 
### 
After reflecting yesterday on the
huge weekend of Pac-10 hoops at
Maples Pavilion, I decided, at first,
to write about the atrocity that is Pac-10
officiating.
Fueled by the Thursday night game
against USC, in which the referees man
aged to single-handedly get USC back
into the game, I was all set to rip apart the
likes of Andy Rios, Billy Gianquinto and
Tim Gabutero, the brain-trust that
slapped a technical foul on Mike Mont
gomery for apparently breathing too
heavily. Geez, for a few minutes on
Thursday, I thought I was watching an
IM hoops game.
Anyway, after pondering the topic for
an hour or so, I decided that Pac-10 offi
cials are not going to get any better, and
that if I really wanted to, I could start a
weekly segment entitled: "This Week in
Shameful Sports Officiating." I can hear
the sponsors calling already.
That's not what I am going to write
about though.
I feel it is my job, whether you like it or
not, to bring some insight into the world
of sports— and, let's face it, if Todd Boze
man can figure out that the refs are bad,
I'm not bringing anything new to the
table.
Instead, I am going to focus on the
most important Cardinal basketball victo
ry since I arrived here three years ago.
Unless you've been under a rock or in the
LaIR for the past four days, you know I
am talking about the 67-66 win over
UCLA on Saturday.
While most people either ranted and
raved at Maples Pavilion, or cheered
Stanford on while watching the game on
TV, there are probably a few slants on the
game that fall into the"I bet ya didn't
know" category, and I was privy to them.

I had the honor of working for ABC on
Saturday — basically running for the pro
ducer and director. Okay, I was a gopher.
But I did get to sit in what was probably
the most interesting seat in the house.

For those of you who missed me, I was
the guy in the gray shirt, sitting a foot
behind UCLA head coach Jim Harrick.
That's right — the guy biting his nails
throughout the second half, throwing an
empty Pepsi can out every twenty min
utes, and every once and a while remind
ing Harrick that he was acting like a big
baby. No wonder the internet address for
the UCLA Bruin Basketball Home Page is
bhrn@pacifier.com.
I'm not kidding, either. Check it out if
you don't believe me.
After watching, and overhearing, the
UCLA bench for the entire game, I
became baffled by the fact that UCLA
won the national championship last year.
Anybody who tells you that it had to do
with Harrick's coaching ability is a fool —
the very talented Bruins won last year in
spite of him.
I have never seen a more unorganized
sideline huddle since my IM football team
let me play quarterback on one play last
year. Harrick has no sense of control, his
