# Hail to the Cardinal!
## Stanford outclasses UCLA in win 
### 
After reflecting yesterday on the
huge weekend of Pac-10 hoops at
Maples Pavilion, I decided, at first,
to write about the atrocity that is Pac-10
officiating.
Fueled by the Thursday night game
against USC, in which the referees man
aged to single-handedly get USC back
into the game, I was all set to rip apart the
likes of Andy Rios, Billy Gianquinto and
Tim Gabutero, the brain-trust that
slapped a technical foul on Mike Mont
gomery for apparently breathing too
heavily. Geez, for a few minutes on
Thursday, I thought I was watching an
IM hoops game.
Anyway, after pondering the topic for
an hour or so, I decided that Pac-10 offi
cials are not going to get any better, and
that if I really wanted to, I could start a
weekly segment entitled: "This Week in
Shameful Sports Officiating." I can hear
the sponsors calling already.
That's not what I am going to write
about though.
I feel it is my job, whether you like it or
not, to bring some insight into the world
of sports— and, let's face it, if Todd Boze
man can figure out that the refs are bad,
I'm not bringing anything new to the
table.
Instead, I am going to focus on the
most important Cardinal basketball victo
ry since I arrived here three years ago.
Unless you've been under a rock or in the
LaIR for the past four days, you know I
am talking about the 67-66 win over
UCLA on Saturday.
While most people either ranted and
raved at Maples Pavilion, or cheered
Stanford on while watching the game on
TV, there are probably a few slants on the
game that fall into the"I bet ya didn't
know" category, and I was privy to them.

I had the honor of working for ABC on
Saturday — basically running for the pro
ducer and director. Okay, I was a gopher.
But I did get to sit in what was probably
the most interesting seat in the house.

For those of you who missed me, I was
the guy in the gray shirt, sitting a foot
behind UCLA head coach Jim Harrick.
That's right — the guy biting his nails
throughout the second half, throwing an
empty Pepsi can out every twenty min
utes, and every once and a while remind
ing Harrick that he was acting like a big
baby. No wonder the internet address for
the UCLA Bruin Basketball Home Page is
bhrn@pacifier.com.
I'm not kidding, either. Check it out if
you don't believe me.
After watching, and overhearing, the
UCLA bench for the entire game, I
became baffled by the fact that UCLA
won the national championship last year.
Anybody who tells you that it had to do
with Harrick's coaching ability is a fool —
the very talented Bruins won last year in
spite of him.
I have never seen a more unorganized
sideline huddle since my IM football team
let me play quarterback on one play last
year. Harrick has no sense of control, his


Todd
Bernstein
players don't seem to respect him,
and above all, he seems to lack a
brain at times. It is unfathomable
how this man has a .753 winning
percentage.
Harrick is merely the Charlie
McCarthy doll for the assistant
coaches, most notably Lorenzo
Romar, who seemed to be in
touch with the players and tended
to have little difficulty with such
jargon as "it's a moving pick, ref,"
or "I think that guy walked, ref."
Harrick, when able to string
together a thought deeper than
"Hey!," only managed to scream
the same thing (that J.R. Hender
son was getting fouled) so many
times that referee Daniel Chris
man had to say: "Coach, you've
said that already. We caught it
the first few times."

Add in the fact that Harrick
took a technical foul at the most
crucial part of the game, arid that
he benched Kris Johnson for the
last three minuses of the game
because of an argument the two
had during a time-out, and it
becomes a mystery how UCLA has
only lost two games in Pac-10 play.
Conversely, I want to salute
Mike Montgomery and the Cardi
nal hoopsters. I have probably
given the impression that UCLA
lost because they beat themselves
on Saturday, and that is not true.
Stanford kept its composure at
key moments in the game and
beat the Bruins.
It wasn't a fluke, either.
Though I sometimes disagree
with the choices Montgomery
makes in games, it is hard to
argue with his team philosophy
that has earned his squad a 15-5
record this season.
The Cardinal play as a team,
not as a collection of individuals.

They communicate well on the
floor and play unselfishly. They
seem to win as a team and lose as
a team.
Against UCLA, after a horren
dous start to the game, the Cardi
nal settled down, got back into
the game by halftime, and let
Brevin Knight take over in the
second half. The team did not fall
apart after falling behind 15-2 —
a feat I attribute to Montgomery,
his coaching staff, and Knight,
who as a point guard serves as the
extension of the coach on the
floor.
Sitting behind the UCLA
bench was a unique opportunity
and quite a learning experience.
Calling Harrick a baby was
cathartic and the realization of a
long-awaited dream.
But nothing was sweeter than
glancing up at the scoreboard on
Saturday and seeing STANFORD
67, UCIA 66, and realizing that
justice had been served.

officiating.
Fueled by the Thursday night game
against USC, in which the referees man
aged to single-handedly get USC back
into the game, I was all set to rip apart the
likes of Andy Rios, Billy Gianquinto and
Tim Gabutero, the brain-trust that
slapped a technical foul on Mike Mont
gomery for apparently breathing too
heavily. Geez, for a few minutes on
Thursday, I thought I was watching an
IM hoops game.
Anyway, after pondering the topic for
an hour or so, I decided that Pac-10 offi
cials are not going to get any better, and
that if I really wanted to, I could start a
weekly segment entitled: "This Week in
Shameful Sports Officiating." I can hear
the sponsors calling already.
That's not what I am going to write
about though.
I feel it is my job, whether you like it or
not, to bring some insight into the world
of sports— and, let's face it, if Todd Boze
man can figure out that the refs are bad,
I'm not bringing anything new to the
table.
Instead, I am going to focus on the
most important Cardinal basketball victo
ry since I arrived here three years ago.
Unless you've been under a rock or in the
LaIR for the past four days, you know I
am talking about the 67-66 win over
UCLA on Saturday.
While most people either ranted and
raved at Maples Pavilion, or cheered
Stanford on while watching the game on
TV, there are probably a few slants on the
game that fall into the"I bet ya didn't
know" category, and I was privy to them.

I had the honor of working for ABC on
Saturday — basically running for the pro
ducer and director. Okay, I was a gopher.
But I did get to sit in what was probably
the most interesting seat in the house.

For those of you who missed me, I was
the guy in the gray shirt, sitting a foot
behind UCLA head coach Jim Harrick.
That's right — the guy biting his nails
throughout the second half, throwing an
empty Pepsi can out every twenty min
utes, and every once and a while remind
ing Harrick that he was acting like a big
baby. No wonder the internet address for
the UCLA Bruin Basketball Home Page is
bhrn@pacifier.com.
I'm not kidding, either. Check it out if
you don't believe me.
After watching, and overhearing, the
UCLA bench for the entire game, I
became baffled by the fact that UCLA
won the national championship last year.
Anybody who tells you that it had to do
with Harrick's coaching ability is a fool —
the very talented Bruins won last year in
spite of him.
I have never seen a more unorganized
sideline huddle since my IM football team
let me play quarterback on one play last
year. Harrick has no sense of control, his


Todd
Bernstein
players don't seem to respect him,
and above all, he seems to lack a
brain at times. It is unfathomable
how this man has a .753 winning
percentage.
Harrick is merely the Charlie
McCarthy doll for the assistant
coaches, most notably Lorenzo
Romar, who seemed to be in
touch with the players and tended
to have little difficulty with such
jargon as "it's a moving pick, ref,"
or "I think that guy walked, ref."
Harrick, when able to string
together a thought deeper than
"Hey!," only managed to scream
the same thing (that J.R. Hender
son was getting fouled) so many
times that referee Daniel Chris
man had to say: "Coach, you've
said that already. We caught it
the first few times."

Add in the fact that Harrick
took a technical foul at the most
crucial part of the game, arid that
he benched Kris Johnson for the
last three minuses of the game
because of an argument the two
had during a time-out, and it
becomes a mystery how UCLA has
only lost two games in Pac-10 play.
Conversely, I want to salute
Mike Montgomery and the Cardi
nal hoopsters. I have probably
given the impression that UCLA
lost because they beat themselves
on Saturday, and that is not true.
Stanford kept its composure at
key moments in the game and
beat the Bruins.
It wasn't a fluke, either.
Though I sometimes disagree
with the choices Montgomery
makes in games, it is hard to
argue with his team philosophy
that has earned his squad a 15-5
record this season.
The Cardinal play as a team,
not as a collection of individuals.

They communicate well on the
floor and play unselfishly. They
seem to win as a team and lose as
a team.
Against UCLA, after a horren
dous start to the game, the Cardi
nal settled down, got back into
the game by halftime, and let
Brevin Knight take over in the
second half. The team did not fall
apart after falling behind 15-2 —
a feat I attribute to Montgomery,
his coaching staff, and Knight,
who as a point guard serves as the
extension of the coach on the
floor.
Sitting behind the UCLA
bench was a unique opportunity
and quite a learning experience.
Calling Harrick a baby was
cathartic and the realization of a
long-awaited dream.
But nothing was sweeter than
glancing up at the scoreboard on
Saturday and seeing STANFORD
67, UCIA 66, and realizing that
justice had been served.
