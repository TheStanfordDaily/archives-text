a bone in his neck this
past weekend in compe
tition against BYU and
San Jose State in San

urday, was unaware of

the seriousness of the injury at first,
believing he had pulled a muscle in his
neck, according to a team source. Tests,
however, showed yesterday that Dalrym
ple fractured his C-4 vertebrae. He will
most likely will undergo surgery and miss
the rest of the season. Doctors expect a
full recovery for the gymnast.

he's not available," Montgomery said.
