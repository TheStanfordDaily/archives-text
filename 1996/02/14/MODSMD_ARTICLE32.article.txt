## Rising water use could threaten human life 
### Libusha Kelly Editorial staff 
Unless current practices change, people
will use nearly 100 percent of the earth's
renewable water resources by the year
2025, according to a new study in the Biol
ogy Department.
The study, headed by research assistant
Gretchen Daily, initially intended to find
out how much water was channeled into
human activities compared to the total
available supply.
"Water is absolutely essential to human
life. We can't go a day without water,"
Daily said. "What we wanted to figure out
is, are we on a sustainable course?"
Their results suggest that humans are
not.
"We discovered that we're coming up
against limits," Daily said.
According to Daily, between 1930 and
1996, total global water use has tripled. In
dividual water use has also increased by 50
percent since 1960.
However, individuals are not the largest
wasters of water; industry uses huge
amounts of fresh water to dilute pollution.
Forcing industry to cut back on pollution is

one way to free up water, Daily said.
As of now, humans use about 70 percent
of the available fresh water. If current
trends of increasing use continue, Daily ex
pects that figure will jump to nearly 100
percent within 30 years.
"People have this picture of the earth as
a huge blue sphere with all these puffy
white clouds and wonder how it's possible
that we could face a shortage," she said.
However, according to Daily, out of all
the water on the planet, only 2.5 percent is
fresh water suitable for human life and
agriculture. Of this fresh water, two
thirds is tied up in glaciers and ice caps.
This leaves less than 1 percent of water for
human use. Of course, even this water is
often not readily available, especially for
agriculture, because it is in areas too re
mote to build irrigation canals and other
transport systems.
As an example, Daily cited the Amazon
River, which produces 15 percent of global
runoff. However, the population around
the river which makes use of this fresh
water is tiny, and the rest of the world can
not easily access this water.
In many cases the distribution of water
does not correspond to the population dis

tribution, Daily said.
There are two ways in which water is
stored for human use. The first source is
rain, which is captured in what Daily calls
"human-dominated systems" such as
farms and grazing lands. Humans current
ly use 26 percent of this water in agricul
ture. However, it's unlikely that this type
of water use can be increased.
"Croplands are decreasing in area be
cause cities were founded where the land
was most productive, and as they expand,
the land becomes so badly degraded that it
is abandoned," Daily said.
Rosamund Naylor, a fellow at the Insti
tute for International Studies at Stanford,
agreed that the trend toward urbanization
will bring a crisis, since there are already
water shortages in areas such as Asia and
Africa. "As the water shortage gets worse,
there will be increasing competition (for
fresh water) between industry and agricul
ture."
The second source of water is dams and
runoffs from rivers, streams and lakes.
Humans currently use 54 percent of these
resources.
But although the outlook seems bleak,
there are ways to at least slow down water

usage and lessen the demand so it matches
the supply.
"We must become more efficient with
irrigation and be more careful where we
grow what types of crops," Daily said. She
gave the example of cotton and rice crops,
which consume water heavily. These crops
are being grown in California when they
could be more efficiently grown in an envi
ronment where more rainwater is avail
able, Daily said.
"We need a revamping of policies and
farm management practices to increase
how efficiently water is used," Naylor said.
"With current practices it is going to be im
possible to keep agriculture going."
Water shortages are not simply detri
mental to agriculture; Daily said there is
an "intimate connection" between water
availability and disease. Lack of water can
promote conditions that lead to the spread
of epidemic diseases. Malnutrition is al
ready rampant in many countries, and as
water supplies decrease, Daily expects that
there will be an increase in international
conflict as countries compete for available
water.
"These are not problems that we can
seal ourselves off from," Daily said.
