# SLAC experiences minor fire

### Adam Kemezis Contributing writer 
A weekend fire has left the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center facing weeks of closure and officials
trying to work out what went wrong.
P.A. Moore, SLAC's public affairs director, said
the minor electrical fire, which occured at SLAC Sat
urday morning, was extinguished relatively easily by
the sprinkler systems and caused no injury.
The fire was confined to a 5-square-foot area with
in a "damping ring," a structure which is used to
align subatomic particles before they are accelerated,
Moore said. The damping ring "has a lot of electrici
ty, a lot of magnets and a lot of wires," she added.
Investigators think one of those wires short-cir
cuited, causing the fire. "Whether it was old or
whether it was defective, we don't know," Moore
said. She added that an investigation is still under
way "to see what lessons can be learned."

Although the fire was small, repairs will cause a
long delay because of the nature of the work, she said.
There are approximately 1,000 wires that will have to
be replaced and tested, one at a time.
The damaged area is also a constricted, under
ground space, meaning only a few people at a time can
get to it.
Moore said the damage would take between two
and three weeks to repair, and repairs will then take
a week to test. Most of SLAC will be closed during
that time.
How much repairs will cost, Moore said, remains
unknown because most of the expense is involved in
overtime pay for repair workers who will have to
work double shifts.
Such fires are not dangerous because they occur in
small, shielded areas away from flammable materi
als, Moore said, adding that electrical fires and fires
in general are rare at facilities such as SLAC and are
not considered a normal operating hazard.
