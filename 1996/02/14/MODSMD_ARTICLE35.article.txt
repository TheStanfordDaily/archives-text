# VSO decision, banking rules prompt Daily to decline fee
## 
### Joe El Rady Contributing writer 
The Stanford Daily announced this week that it
would stop accepting a special fee from the ASSU, cit
ing both ethical and financial reasons for its decision.
Daily Editor in Chief Burt Herman explained the
decision in an editorial published Monday, noting the
need for objectivity as a major consideration. Because
The Daily prints endorsements of special-fee requests
before the ASSU elections every April, its own place
on the ballot has repeatedly caused controversy.
Ethical considerations have surfaced among Daily
staff members in past years, but the discovery of two
portions of the ASSU Bylaws — one detailing which
groups are eligible for a special fee and the other de
lineating certain banking requirements — also
brought the issue to the fore. Under the new ruling,
The Daily could only be placed on the ballot with
ASSU Senate approval, highlighting concerns that
the paper would have had to tailor its editorial con
tent in order to win favor with senators.
The Daily has accepted a special fee since it de
clared its independence from the University in
1973.
The Daily's budget has grown in recent years, and
the organization is now able to sustain itself finan
cially, said Daily Business Manager Sarah Nixon.
Added Council of Presidents member Nicole
Vazquez, "The Daily is not one of the organizations
that needs the special fee to cover their expenses, to
stay alive. The Daily performs a wonderful service,
but they have other sources of income.
"It has its own resources, its own board (of direc
tors) — it functions in a different way," she said.
The make-up of The Daily's board of directors —
which consists of four professionals and five students
— played its own role in the controversy.
Only student organizations whose ultimate con
trol lies with students can request special fees from
the ASSU as a voluntary student organization (VSO),
according to bylaws passed several years ago but
overlooked by the ASSU until thisyear. Hearings Of
ficer Solomon Lefier ruled that the makeup of The
Daily's board prevents it from having VSO classifica
tion for the elections.
Instead, Lefier informed The Daily that he consid
ered it a "chartered organization," a student group in
which "ultimate constitutional, budgetary and poli
cy-making authority are vested in .. . any hody other
than its student membership," according to the by
laws.
The bylaws state that chartered organizations can
only be placed on the ballot with consent of the senate
and, if rejected, are ineligible to petition students, as

VSOs can.
In addition, ASSU Financial Manager John Hall
informed The Daily — which, unlike most student
groups, does not bank with the ASSU — that it would
have to get a banking exemption from the senate.
A letter to The Daily's board signed by many of its
editors said one of the main considerations for aban
doning the policy was"the hurdles that certain ASSU
leaders are attempting to place in the way of The
Daily receiving a special fee."
But Hall said, "I think that the constitution was
not enforced for reasons of convenience. It doesn't
take too much time or effort to enforce the ASSU
Constitution, and I am in favor of enforcement."
Although Nixon said The Daily sends a fully dis
closed financial statement to the financial manager
every year, 11 all said he was concerned that there was
no oversight of Daily special-fee money if the paper
conducted its own banking. "I am entrusted with the
responsibility of distributing the money which stu
dents vote for according to their original intent," he
said.
Vazquez said the timing is apropos. "I feel that
The Daily would have faced political opposition in the
senate by people who would feel that The Daily has
paid attention to and accentuated the negative as
pects of what students, especially in the ASSU, have
done, while ignoring the positive work."
Though Nixon repeatedly stated that the decision
was based on ethical considerations, she conceded
that pressure from the ASSU played a role.
"Every year, the ASSU political and business side
choose an issue to attack head on, every year they
choose their battles; this year it was The Daily," she
said.
"The senate is imploding this year, they don't have
a lot of unity. This was an issue they could all sup
port," she added.
Senate Deputy Chair Bill Shen also cited proce
dural reasons and oversights for the new interest in
The Daily's business affairs, but admitted to ASSU
shortcomings on the issue.
"Maybe the ASSU has neglected its duties in the
past," he said. "But The Daily is the most powerful
source of information on campus, they have a mo
nopoly on information here, and some senators
might have been concerned about this."
Other ASSU senate members seem concerned
about The Daily's coverage. "In Herman's editorial,
he mentioned that The Daily, now completely inde
pendent of the ASSU, will be even more . . . objec
tive," said undergraduate senator Armen Panossian.
"Personally, I think The Daily has already made it a
priority to sensationalize 'scandal' in the ASSU and
University at laree."
