The debate over re
structuring the ASSU will
continue as two controver
sial bills were tabled until
Feb. 27 at last night's
ASSU Senate meeting.
The first bill, "Consti
tution '9G: A New Consti
tution for the ASSU,"
would replace the four-

person Council of Presidents with a president
and a vice president, reduce the size of the sen
ate by 25 percent, give all senators voting priv
ileges and create a judicial branch of the
ASSU.
The bill, authored by senior Mike Slemmer
and sponsored by undergraduate senator
Andre Vanier, was put to an intense question
and answer period during which senators dis
cussed the merits and drawbacks of shrinking
the senate.
"I think this bill will make the senate very
active since each senator will have the right to
vote," said Slemmer. "By decreasing the size of

the body, we will make a senator's election
mean a little more."
Other legislators questioned whether giving
each senator voting power would encourage
participation.
"As it is now, some of the more active sena
tors are not the voting ones," said undergradu
ate senator Christy Ramon. "It seems that
each senator takes on a project or initiative re
gardless of their voting status."
While proponents of the one-president sys
tem lauded its efficiency and accountability,

others countered that the struc
ture could give one person exces
sive power.
"One president has the poten
tial to be more powerful, but they
also have the ability to abuse
power," said COP member Mike
Choo.
Slemmer said a single president
would create less confusion and
improve efficiency: "Look at (Uni
versity President) Gerhard
(Casper). What if there were four
Gerhards?"
Another proposed reform
maintains the COP but grants ex
ecutive authority to one of the
COP members. This bill, written
by current COP member Jon
Oram, was also tabled until the
next meeting.
Questions centered on the
value of further defining leader
ship roles.
"It's difficult in a four-person
council to have leadership," Oram
said. "We've got to align roles and
responsibility so we have diversity
and experience in specific areas."
Continuing the debate on cam
paign finance reform, the senate
decided to postpone voting on a bill
that would reduce the current
spending limit for independent
and party candidates for the sen
ate from $120 to $60. The discus
sion will continue at the Feb. 27
meeting.
"The reason people are in favor
of this bill is that there is a gross
amount of spending that goes into
campaigning on campus," said
Oram, who also authored this bill.
"Fjvery year, there are hundreds of
thousands of fliers, a lot of unnec
essary spending and not enough
traditional campaigning, like

going door-to-door."
In other ASSU news, the senate
passed two bills that will allow two
chartered organizations — KZSU
and the Stanford Concert Net
work — to apply for special fees.
Under the ASSU Bylaws, campus
organizations must demonstrate a
certain degree of student involve
ment to be eligible make special
fee requests.
Under the new bills, KZSU and
the Concert Network will be re
quired to give priority to students
who are interested in becoming in
volved with the organizations.
In addition, the senate passed a
bill that will establish a Freshman
Class Council to increase involve
ment of first-year students in the
ASSU. The council, which will
consist of one elected representa
tive from each freshman dorm,
will meet regularly to plan fresh
men activities which promote
class spirit.
All class members will be eligi
ble to vote for representatives to
the Freshman Council during fall
quarter's dorm government elec
tions. An administrative cabinet
chosen from the council will han
dle most of the organizing and
communicating with the ASSU.
The senate also passed a bill to
promote better preparation for its
meetings. Bernard Gilroy, a grad
uate senator who sponsored the
bill, said, "This is for all the
crotchety grad students like me
who think it's useful to hash
things out before we get here."
In accordance with the bill,
items to be discussed by the senate
must be distributed either via e
mail or the World Wide Web no
later than 24 hours before ASSU
meetings. Gilroy and other sena
tors said they hope that learning
and debating about issues before
meetings will make discussions
more efficient.
