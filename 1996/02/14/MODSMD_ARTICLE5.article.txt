# Looking for love (at all the right wel sites)

### Curtis Sittenfeld Editorial staff 
If you still don't have a date for tonight,
don't despair.
Thanks to a new on-line dating service, you
can now not only scrounge up a valentine re
ally quickly, but you can ensure that your
valentine is of the same Stanford caliber that
you are.
Cupid in this case is Evan Torrie, a doctor
al candidate in computer science. Torrie said
he created the Stanford-only service, which
debuted on the World Wide Web Monday
night, to address "the legendary stories about
the paucity of dating at Stanford" as well as to
provide "intellectual stimulation" for himself.
The paucity of dating, according to Torrie,
is as pronounced among graduate students as

it is reputed to be among undergraduates.
"Grad students are so repressed, and
there's not an opportunity to meet people,"
Torrie said. "We're not living in dorms and
having close interactions. You tend to go home
to apartments in Escondido Village and never
meet anyone else. We never have time to go to
bars or things like that."
As Torrie has arranged the service now,
anyone with a leland e-mail account can post
300 to 400 word ads specifying their gender,
the gender of the person they would like to
meet and what sort of social interaction they
are looking for.
The web site currently offers several op

tions for interacting: "Looking for a friend?"
"Need a date next Saturday?" "Tired of trying
to meet somebody special?" and "Just want to
cut straight to the chase (nudge, nudge, wink,
wink)?"
Anonymity will be provided by the estab
lishment of individual accounts within the
web site, Torrie said. Students must establish
an account if they wish to view any ads, but
they need not post their own ads.
With the recent passage of the Communi
cations Indecency Act, which prohibits "inde
cent material," Torrie said he is concerned


Nancy K. Tsai — Daily
about the possibility of students
including obscenities in their ads.
"I can be prosecuted for run
ning a site with offensive lan
guage," said Torrie. "I may have
to run a filter which finds the
seven dirty words and replaces
them with asterisks. I hope people
won't use offensive language. I
hope Stanford students are above
that."
Torrie said he has experiment
ed with other on-line dating ser
vices but has found them unsatis
fying. "The problem with most of
them is that they're so geographi
cally dispersed. An East Coast per
son has no relevance to the West
Coast, if you actually want to
meet."
Torrie said the idea for a
Stanford-only dating service oc
curred to him after returning to
campus in January. "I didn't
have anything to do at the mo
ment. I thought, 'What would be
a nice way to occupy my time?' "

Torrie said.
The service is a hobby rather
than a business venture, he said.
"I'm not sure who it will be used by
or whether it will be used at all. It's
an experiment. I haven't thought
seriously about [financial issues],
partly because it's developed on
University equipment."
So far, only a handful of people
know about Torrie's creation.
However, those who do know
about it find it amusing. "I
thought it was a novel application
of new technology," said Steve
Woo, Torrie's officemate and a
doctoral student in electrical engi
neering.
As for whether Torrie hopes to
reap any personal benefits from
the service, he admits that initially
he did but that within the last two
weeks, "I actually found someone
I'm probably going to be seriously
going out with, so [the service] is
no use to me."
Torrie found his new love inter
est on-line, he said, and she lives in
Berkeley, so they have met in per
son. So far, their romance looks
promising. "She's going to be my
valentine," Torrie said.
