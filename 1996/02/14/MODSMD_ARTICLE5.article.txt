If you still don't have a date for tonight,
don't despair.
Thanks to a new on-line dating service, you
can now not only scrounge up a valentine re
ally quickly, but you can ensure that your
valentine is of the same Stanford caliber that
you are.
Cupid in this case is Evan Torrie, a doctor
al candidate in computer science. Torrie said
he created the Stanford-only service, which
debuted on the World Wide Web Monday
night, to address "the legendary stories about
the paucity of dating at Stanford" as well as to
provide "intellectual stimulation" for himself.
The paucity of dating, according to Torrie,
is as pronounced among graduate students as

it is reputed to be among undergraduates.
"Grad students are so repressed, and
there's not an opportunity to meet people,"
Torrie said. "We're not living in dorms and
having close interactions. You tend to go home
to apartments in Escondido Village and never
meet anyone else. We never have time to go to
bars or things like that."
As Torrie has arranged the service now,
anyone with a leland e-mail account can post
300 to 400 word ads specifying their gender,
the gender of the person they would like to
meet and what sort of social interaction they
are looking for.
The web site currently offers several op

tions for interacting: "Looking for a friend?"
"Need a date next Saturday?" "Tired of trying
to meet somebody special?" and "Just want to
cut straight to the chase (nudge, nudge, wink,
wink)?"
Anonymity will be provided by the estab
lishment of individual accounts within the
web site, Torrie said. Students must establish
an account if they wish to view any ads, but
they need not post their own ads.
With the recent passage of the Communi
cations Indecency Act, which prohibits "inde
cent material," Torrie said he is concerned
