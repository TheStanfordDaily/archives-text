The accused murderers of Stan

ed not guilty at an arraignment yes
terday at San Jose Superior Court.
Eddy Pereles and Larry "Moon"
Paul are charged with first-degree
murder with special circumstances,
robbery and conspiracy to commit
robbery in connection with the No
vember 1994 killing of Liu, a gradu
ate student in product design.
At the hearing before Superior
Court Judge Jack Komar, Paul and
Pereles quickly entered their pleas
as part of a group of about 60 people
facing arraignment. Their trial was
set for April 1.
The suspects were charged with
the crimes in January 1995 and
have been in police custody for the
past year. Previous arraignments

were repeatedly postponed until
yesterday's hearing.
Liu was shot in the back of the
head on Nov. 13,1994, in what was
allegedly an attempted robbery, as
he got out of his car to visit friends
in an East Palo Alto apartment
complex. The 23-year old died at
Stanford Hospital 30 minutes after
the shooting.
Police suspect Liu's death was
no more than the unfortunate out
come of the robbery attempt. Al
though he had a black belt in tae
kwon do, Liu could not fend off the
attackers.
Pereles and Paul were also al
legedly involved with a series of
other robberies, which turned the
police investigation toward the two
men, both in their 20s and from
East Palo Alto.
If found guilty, Pereles and Paul
could receive the death penalty.
