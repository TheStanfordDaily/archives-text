## GOP rivals attack Buchanan 
### 
MILFORD, N.H. (AP) - Pat
Buchanan's "America first" trade and
foreign policy views came under
pointed criticism from three Republi
can presidential rivals yesterday,
attacks the commentator took as
proof he was the man to beat in New
Hampshire's pivotal primary.
Responding with confident defi
ance, Buchanan paid a Valentine's
Day visit to a rose grower and said the
business was being overwhelmed by
foreign competition because of trade
deals that please Wall Street but pun
ish American workers.
Buchanan also was labeled "too
extreme" in a new television ad aired
by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole's
campaign. "He can't beat Bill Clin
ton," says the ad.
Buchanan attributed the Dole
attack ad to "a campaign in despera
tion." Firing a salvo of his own,
Buchanan called Dole a "big tax man

who hasn't balanced a budget in his
last 25 years in Congress."
That Buchanan was at the center
of the day's give-and-take was testa
ment to his rising influence on the
Republican race after strong show
ings in early battles in Louisiana and
lowa. Rival camps suggested
Buchanan's positions would be a
major focus in a televised candidates
debate tonight.
"I have won the battle of Mr. Con
servative in the Republican Party,"
Buchanan said on the very day Texas
Sen. Phil Gramm withdrew from the
race.
Gramm's withdrawal set off a
scramble for his support. Most of the
senators backing Gramm were likely
to go Dole's way, though none did
immediately. "I think Senator Dole
probably has the best shot of defeat
ing President Clinton," said Arizona
Sen. John McCain, who was Gramm's

national campaign chairman.
Ignoring the politicians, Buchanan
and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander made direct appeals to
Gramm voters.
In parting, Gramm said he wasn't
ready to endorse a candidate. But he
also wasn't ready to stop criticizing
Buchanan and trade views that
Gramm labeled protectionist and
anathema to the free-trading Republi
can Party.
"When the voters speak, I listen,"
Gramm said in bowing out after back
to-back losses.
Another candidate said he, too, was
listening, but hardly ready to call it
quits. On his first visit to New Hamp
shire after placing a distant fourth in
lowa, publishing heir Steve Forbes
said he would stop attacking his oppo
nents in television ads and return to a
positive message anchored on his plan
for a flat tax.
