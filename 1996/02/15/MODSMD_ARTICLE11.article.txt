YEKATERINBURG, Russia (AP)
President Boris Yeltsin came home yes
terday to announce his political plans in
a frigid, industrial city that says it
knows him well — but believes he has
lost touch with its troubles.
"He did a very good job here, and his
wife used to stand right next to us in
line for shoes," says Zoya Kartashova, a
tiny pensioner in fur boots and a thin
purple jacket who was walking home on
a crisp cold day.
"Now I actually feel sorry for him.
He's alone there and doesn't know how
life really is for people. ... I voted for
him last time, but that's it."
Yeltsin, 65, is expected to announce
today that he will seek a second presi
dential term. He trails in nationwide
opinion polls and appears to fare only
slightly better in his own backyard.
"It's a difficult decision," Yeltsin told
reporters at Yekaterinburg's airport,
referring to the decision whether (o run
in the June l(i election.

"It would not mean that I will neces
sarily be elected," he said. "But we must
continue with reforms. We don't have
any other choice. There is no road back,
and we must finish what we have skirt
ed."
Russia's provinces have been the last
to feel benefits from market reforms,
and voters there flocked to the Commu
nists and other opposition parties in
December parliamentary elections.
Yeltsin's t rip to Yekaterinburg, a city
of 2 million people, is the first of what
his office says will be many visits to
Russia's regions.
The Ural Mountains city, formerly
known as Sverdlovsk, was at the heart
of the Soviet Union's military-industri
al complex. It is ailing now as Russian
industry declines and the military
shrinks.
The city, home to the giant Ural
mash machine-building plant, also is
known for violent feuds between orga
nized crime gangs. Its workers face con

stant delays in their paychecks in addi
tion to production declines and environ
mental and health problems.
Yeltsin last visited Yekaterinburg in
June 1992, when his mother was ill. He
had been the region's Communist Party
boss before moving to Moscow in 1985.
I Hiring his current trip, he is sticking
to a fairly conventional schedule, visit
ing a factory, a subway station, a war
memorial and a cemetery, among other
stops.
At Sreduralstroi, a huge construc
tion company that Yeltsin ran before
going into politics, the past seven years
have been rough. The number of pro
jects is down by a third, said deputy
director Konstantin Yeliseyev.
Yeliseyev, who worked with Yeltsin,
said he sympathizes with the job the
president faces "rebuilding an entire
economy for 150 million people."
"But it could have been done more
gently," he said. "Boris Nikolayevieh's
character is very tough."
