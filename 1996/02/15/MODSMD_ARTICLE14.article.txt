## Stronger security 
### 
University needs
better regulations
for certain parties

LAST WEEKEND'S shooting
at Tresidder Union was unfor
tunate and could not have
been predicted. But if the University
had appropriate guidelines for hav
ing this type of event — or had the
sorority hosting the party been
required to follow existing guidelines
— two men might not have been
shot.
Both the "Student Organization
Handbook," put out by the ASSU
and the Office of Student Activities,
and an OSA booklet titled "Party
Planning" set forth guidelines for
campus parties. While most regula
tions deal with issues like advertising
and alcohol, some deal specifically
with security.
When event planners advertise
off campus or expect to draw more
than 200 guests — both were the
case for Saturday's party — they are
required to notify police more than
24 hours ahead of time. It is sug
gested the party-givers hire one
security officer for each 50 guests at
the organization's expense. Also, it
is recommended that the Fire Mar
shal be consulted prior to large par
ties.
According to OSA's materials, the
occupancy limit for Oak Lounge is
200. Police estimated there were
more than 400 people attending the
party. Ignoring probable fire code
violations, overcrowding Tresidder
was problematic because it created
an environment in which fights
erupted as police broke the party up.
Only two guards were on duty at the
event.
Obviously, existing University
regulations governing such parties
were not appropriately followed.
However, only some of the blame
should rest with Delta Sigma Theta
sorority, which threw the party as a
fund-raiser. The OSA must also take

some blame for lax enforcement.
That office should take some respon
sibility to ensure groups follow
appropriate procedures.
The number of parties at Stanford
on any given weekend makes it
impossible for OSA's staff of three to
determine whether all meet appro
priate guidelines. However, most
parties are intended only for the
Stanford community. It is becoming
increasingly apparent that more
supervision is needed at parties
designed to attract people from off
campus.
Saturday's party was specifically
intended for people throughout the
Bay Area, and two men were shot.
Earlier this year, at Sanskriti's
Bhangra party — which draws its
attendees from throughout the area
— a car was overturned. At last
year's Bhangra party, a student was
attacked by off-campus partygoers
attempting to enter the function.
Police were ultimately called to con
trol the crowd.
It may sound elitist, but it seems
there is a greater tendency for things
to go awry at parties involving people
from outside Stanford.
The OSA should recognize this
problem and respond with appropri
ate guidelines. The suggestions in
their handbooks deal adequately
with keeping non-Stanford students
out of Stanford-only parties but
there is not enough detail on proce
dures dealing with off-campus
guests.
With a party that has off-campus
attendees in mind, the OSA should
take an active role in ensuring secu
rity measures are enforced, especial
ly requiring one security guard for
every 50 attendees.
The party continued for two
hours on Saturday before police were
able to organize themselves and shut
it down. Event planners must con
tact police prior to the event so offi
cers can be prepared if they are called
upon to disperse the party.
The University cannot guarantee
unfortunate incidents like the shoot
ing will not occur at campus events.
But they can — and should — do
more to help prevent them.
