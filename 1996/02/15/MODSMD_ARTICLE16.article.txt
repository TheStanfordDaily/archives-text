## Who lives in God's house 
### 
THE STANFORD REVIEW has a
long history of attacking lesbian, gay
and bisexual students. As a gay stu
dent, I have grown accustomed (and usual
ly indifferent) to these attacks. Whether it
was David Sacks using the image of a shat
tered pink triangle to mock the gay libera
tion movement, or Alec Rawls defending
anti-gay violence as the result of "biological
mechanisms" that "are trying to stamp
out" those with "their wires crossed," I
usually just let it slide. However, a recent
article eschewed the bald hatred of Sacks
and the paranoia of Rawls for a more trou
bling polemic; petty, apathetic intolerance
disguised as religious concern.
The article, written by Steve Hallaway,
attempts to incite controversy over a same
sex commitment ceremony held in Memo
rial Church. The writer quotes several per
sons from campus Christian organizations
who disapproved of the ceremony. The
criticism is brought to a shrill and person
al level by the unnamed chair of a Chris
tian organization who declares, in dis
cussing Mem Chu's policy, "I think it's a
travesty. I ain't fathom why they could
allow such a thing in Cod's house. .. . I just
wish that this type of thing didn't have to
go on in the building that has Protestant
and Catholic services every Sunday." Her
eagerness to judge who belongs in the
church is truly frightening.
I am about to graduate and leave Stan
ford. This is the latest in a history of

painful leavings. I left the Presbyterian
church at 16 when they ignored the rec
ommendations of their own commission
on human sexuality and "officially
declared" their disapproval of homosexu
ality. Then, I left my congregation when
our youth leader chimed in, "Good! That
ought to keep the faggots out of our
church!" I left a friendship with my pas
tor, perhaps the finest person I knew at
that age, when he reacted to that com
ment with silence. I left my home in Col
orado as the state voted that I should have
no legal protection from discrimination.
And now I leave Stanford.
I came here hoping to learn, play, be
young with my peers. I figured that the
narrow-mindedness of a small town had
deprived me of that experience in high
school. Stanford, I thought, would be dif
ferent. Unfortunately, for all of its ambi
tion, Stanford largely fails to transcend the
ordinary bigotry of American society. That
The Stanford Ileview has contributed to
this disappointment is no surprise; that
Christians have Ls much more so. To cower
from one's potential for compassion, to
choose to be small, is a more profound fail
ure when one has the benefit of religious
vision.
I am no longer a Christian, but I have
chosen to study religion here at Stanford
and in the future. It is from this perspec
tive that I would like to offer an observa
tion to those quoted in The Review. My

study of Christian history has consistently
yielded one truth: Gay people have always
been there. They have been martyrs and
saints, mystics and lay believers. What has
fluctuated has been the ability of their
communities to recognize, tolerate and
support them. We currently seem to be
witnessing a decline of such ability, but
whether the current abuse of gay citizens
is challenged or perpetuated, we will be as
much a part of the Christian future as we
have been of the Christian past.
My personal experience of religion has
yielded one further observation: It is a fun
damental purpose of humans to learn to
love. The ability is not our birthright, but
is attained only through tireless cultiva
tion. We must be aggressive or we are apa
thetic, we must be aware or we are blind,
and we must be vigilant or we fail together.
I have always felt that I, and people like
myself, play an equal part in this struggle
to love. When I am feeling unwelcome, I
return to a simple truth: AH love is good;
mine is no exception. I share it with you
here to let those of you who have tried to
demoralize or exclude me know that it will
not happen.
