Hoover Institution research misleading and incorrect

I JUST WANTED to know why Stan
ford would allow a research center at
the University to function when the
research center, namely the Hoover
Institution, falsifies and misquotes sci
entific information in an attempt to
show how global warming will benefit
mankind.
The Hoover Institution has built up a
paper in an attempt to show how global
climate warming will benefit humanity.
The author, Thomas Gale Moore, has
basically taken old or irrelevant infor
mation to depict this. In addition, John
McCarthy of the Computer Science
Department, has a web page on the
Internet, through University resources,

which references this paper and follows
with odd postures such as that there are
no population problems, and he hedges
bets by saying if global warming turns
out to hurt mankind we can cut down
all the trees and replant with fast-grow
ing ones.
I realize that freedom of speech is
something no sane university would
want to officially trounce in an academic
environment. However, when a universi
ty-sponsored research center and other
university resources are used to contra
dict and dismantle science with propa
ganda and misinformation, we have gone
well beyond freedom of speech. This
work of the Hoover Institution seems to

go against the grain of everything the
University is built and run for.
I would suggest starting with
McCarthy's web page and follow some of
the thought processes there, keeping in
mind that this is placed on a university
resource. Then look at the sections on
global warming. Moore's paper and
their "solutions" should not turn out to
be as rosy as they sounded. Moore's
paper is well-written, but a cursory
review shows a great deal of falsified
and misleading information. I can pro
vide concise, peer-reviewed scientific ref
erences that outline how Moore and the
Hoover Institute are misinforming
Congress and anybody else who wishes

to listen to them.
I am, of course, very curious and I
thought the University paper was a
good place to start. Please let me know
what the University's position is, who is
supposed to be in charge of this mess, if
McCarthy is associated with the Hoover
Institution and anything else associated.
For reference, I am an air quality
chemist and environment consultant
working for private industry and gov
ernment research, not an extremist. I
take great exception to Stanford sup
porting this degree and type of misinfor
mation in science.
