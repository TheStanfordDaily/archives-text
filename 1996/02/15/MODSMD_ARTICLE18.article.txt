# Shooting investigators should take care not to discard information
## 
### 
According to'the article about the
Tresidder shooting that appeared in
Monday's Daily, Dean of Students Marc
Wais said that the investigation into the
shooting will likely not lay blame on stu
dents but evaluate current University
policy. Sounds like the cart is before the
horse: I had thought the purpose of an
investigation is to determine inter alia
where blame lies.
From the tone of Dean Wais' reported
comments, it appears that he is bending
over backward not to offend anyone
affiliated with the organization of the
party. That the party was ostensibly
"well-intentioned" is entirely irrelevant
to where the blame for the shooting inci
dent lies. A credible investigation
requires an open mind and the consider
ation of all possibilities. By soothing the
party's organizers before an investiga
tion has taken place and suggesting that
the blame does not lie with students,

Dean Wais is doing a disservice to the
credibility of the eventual University
report regarding the incident.
