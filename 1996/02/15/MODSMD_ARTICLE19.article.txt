# True love waits for sex until marriage
## 
### 
As the self-identified "Mr. Racquetball"
of Friday's Diversions column, I would
like to wait for true love before having
sex. This crazy idea occurred to me my
freshman year in college, when I found
myself warning my sister — who is four
years younger — about some of my
friends from my high school football team.
I gave her my freshman year college
football picture (I played center and
guard, was 6-foot-1 and weighed 250
pounds). One of her serious dates was well
known for trying to get laid quickly, but
after seeing my picture apparently decided
not to try any moves on my sister.
"Maybe I should treat my girlfriends
the way I would like Margaret's boyfriends
to treat her?" This disturbing thought
resounded in my head, and I shared it with

some friends. "Oh, ignore it; the double
standard is here to stay, and besides —
you want to have FUN, don't you?"
Another friend said, "Yeah, I really
think that saving sex for marriage is the
way to go." "What about petting?" I
asked. "Well," he said, "it typically
arouses you sexually, so if you are trying
to wait, it is not the wisest thing to do."
Ahhh, that word — wise. Wisdom.
Virtue. Philosophy. The Pope. The Koran.
Joseph Smith. What do all of these mean?
They are labels, used to intimidate.
They are ideas, important to discuss.
Where are we going anyway? Where
do we want to go? Is sex a statement of
unconditional love?
I think it is. Our True Love Waits group
thinks it is, most of whom do not particu
larly follow or care to follow the Pope. Yes,
I do believe in struggling for virtue — hon
esty, sincerity, temperance, chastity — sav
ing sex for marriage and dedicating oneself
to one person within marriage. Thus crazy
decision was made as a freshman at Yale.
And I have stuck with it ever since. Nuts?
Maybe, but I don't regret it.
