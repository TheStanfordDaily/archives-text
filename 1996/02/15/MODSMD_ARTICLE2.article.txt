The Board of Trustees appointed
Stanford alumnus William Halter as its
newest member at its quarterly meeting
earlier this week.
I lalter, 35, earned a bachelor's degree
in economics and political science in
1983. He currently works in Washing
ton, D.C., as the senior adviser at the Of
fice of Management and Budget and was
an instructor with the Stanford in Wash
ington program from 1988 to 1991.
"This is really a tremendous honor
and an extremely wonderful opportunity
to work with talented people," Halter

said. "I couldn't be more thrilled."
John Freidenrich, the board's chair,
said he was glad to have Halter us a new
trustee. "He will be a great addition,"
Freidenrich said. "Everyone is very
pleased."
Halter fills the unexpired term of
Asst. U.S. Attorney Michael Perez, who
vacated his position because of time con
straints.
Halter will begin his term on March 1
and will finish in late February 1998. He
is one of eight trustees on the 30-mem
ber board who are nominated by alumni.
All eight serve five-year terms. An alum
ni standing committee meets whenever
a vacancy on the board arises to choose a

new board member, according to Bill
Stone, president of the Alumni Associa
tion.
While at Stanford, Halter coordinat
ed the academic advising program for
new undergraduates and was a resident
assistant in Roble Hall.
Monday evening, when the trustees
dined in Stanford residences, Halter vis
ited with students in Branner Hall,
where he had been an advising associate.
"Really, it hasn't changed much," he
said.
After graduating from Stanford, Hal
ter attended Oxford University on a
Rhodes Scholarship, earning a
master's degreee in philosophy
and economics in 1986. He also
won a Marshall Scholarship, but
turned it down to accept the

Rhodes.
"William was one of the finest
students I ever taught â€” he stood
at the very top," said David Danel
ski, former director of Stanford in
Washington. "When Stanford in
Washington was created ... he
was instrumental in encouraging
other Rhodes Scholars to teach in
the program."
