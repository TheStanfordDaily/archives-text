# Josh Golhke: Laughter leads to crying
## Peppermint schnapps with some guy named Tony 
### 
I REALIZE THAT, in recounting my
weekend adventures, for the third
consecutive time I risk accusations
that I'm belaboring the campus with my
personal life. But, in preemptive
response, I urge you to recognize that the
incredible people and events who sur
round me are, as always, the true focus.
Perhaps it is my knowledge that good
stories come from bad times that forces
me continually to seek out just such
times, rejecting journalistically uninter
esting comfort and contentment. In this
case, the impulse came in the form of get
ting on a bus with two people whom I like
and two hundred whom I don't to join in
the San Francisco "Senior Pub Crawl,"
or, as one participant called it,"The
biggest senior party of the year!"
All quotes are real.
"The Senior Pub Crawl was fun,
except for the Stanford people — and the
seniors," one Stanford senior said.
It started to get difficult immediately.
My two companions and I boarded one of
the charter buses and found ourselves
immediately overwhelmed by a rising

swell of low-quality conversation.
"More like the Senior HurlathonV one
student proclaimed enthusiastically.
We glanced about warily and reminded
each other, "Look, we just have to get
there."
Some time ago, my younger brother
was upset about something, and I said to
my mother: "Tell him it gets much
worse." This rule rarely fails, and the
occasion at hand was no rarity in that
sense. For the entire bus ride, 60 minutes
between Tresidder Union and Union
Street, our captive ears and minds were
dominated by the young man sitting
behind us, whose name I am not quite
heartless enough to divulge. Let's call
him "Hank."
During Hank's running monologue,
punctuated only sporadically by the hap
less senior seated next to him, my friends
and I learned more about our four years
at Stanford than we had learned during
the actual four years.
The apparently "crazy" third-floor
guys at Branner back in 1992-1993 were
one important topic: "They were always

breaking things. Stuff was always broken
up there."
Apparently, although Hank lived in a
less glamorous four-class dorm, he hung
out with the guys "for some of the year.
Actually, for a while I was hanging out
with them a lot. ... All the time."
Another important highlight of our
Stanford career, according to Hank, was
a party at 808 house our sophomore
year, which he classified as "clearly the
best non-fraternity row-house party of
that quarter." I checked the files and
what I found seemed to substantiate the
claim; the Xanadu party two weeks later
was said to have "pretty much sucked."
Finally, Hank included a handy sort of
travelogue of the co-ops at Stanford, about
which he seemed to be quite knowledge
able, from.the "out there" Columbae to
the "more normal" EBF. Of Alpha Sig, he
only said ominously: "There are a lot of
botanists there, ifyou know what I mean."
One girl was so into the biggest senior
party of the year that she started puking
in the gutter right when we got to the City.
My friends and I walked past her and

headed for the first bar. But right when
we got inside, we noticed a problem: It
was full of Stanford seniors.
Also: The beers were $4 each.
Eight dollars later, we were outside
and not planning to go back in. Just one
bar wasn't much of a crawl, but the
liquor store down the street was where
things were really happening.
First, we met the guy who was having
a one-man party: one cigar, one pack, of
cigarettes and one bottle of wine. He told
us he was going "the limo," by which he
probably meant his one-room apartment.
We started off Senior Wino Night on the
bench across the street, with a bottle of pep
permint schnapps in a brown paper bag. We
chased it with regular flavor Gatorade.
"This is fun," we said.
After a second bottle, the only person
in the city cooler than us was Tony, a
panhandler across the street. One of my
friends hung out with him for the major
ity of the evening.
Compared to the 200 seniors, this guy
had so much style it was crazy. They've
had four years of class, but Tony's had it

his whole life.
We gave Tony some vital information
to help him ask passing students for
change. He addressed some of the whitest
guys in the world, "Hey, black guy.''
Then he told them, "Stanford is my No.l
favorite university." Most of them still
didn't give him any change.
On the ride back home, my two friends
squeezed into the tiny, airplane-style
restroom at the back of the bus, simulta
neously, just for the hell of it. They came
back and said, "Gohlke, we just went in
the bathroom together. You've got to do
it with us." I was busy getting sick on
myself, but no one saw, so I was still cool.
Tony told us the two corners where he
could be found, and said we should come
back and check him out again some time.
We probably will, but this time without
all the seniors.

favorite university.
