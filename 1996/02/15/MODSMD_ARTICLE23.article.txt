## Next stop: Oregon State No. 20 Cardinal faces Beavers tonight in Corvallis 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
One day you can be sitting on
the top of the world. The next,
Corvallis.
The No. 20 Stanford men's
basketball team suffers that
shock this week, fresh off last Sat
urday's 67-66 win over UCLA
that pulled it within one game of
the Pacific 10 Conference lead.
But you can only put off travel
ing to Oregon State for so long, and
Stanford's number has come up —
the Cardinal takes on the Beavers
at 7 p.m. tonight at Gill Coliseum.
Oregon State (3-17 overall, 1-
10 Pac-10) is coming off one of the
most inept weekends in recent
conference history. Mustering
only 42 points in a 19-point loss to
Washington State last Thursday,
the Beavers couldn't even reach
that offensive level against Wash
ington on Saturday, losing 50-40
and extending their losing streak
to nine games.
The offensive lows have not
occurred solely because Oregon
State is undermanned. Because
the Beavers lack the size and tal
ent of other Pac-10 teams, head
coach Eddie Payne's offensive phi
losophy is to let the other team
touch the ball as little as possible.
By eating up the clock on every
possession, the Beavers have limit
ed opponents to 68.3 points per
game, third-best in the conference.
Stanford (15-5, 8-3) sits on the
opposite end of the offensive spec
trum. The Cardinal has averaged
83.4 points during its current
five-game winning streak, with
much of the offensive boost com
ing from the bench. Led by fresh
man Mark Seaton, the Cardinal
reserves are averaging 20.4 points
per game over that span.
Seaton has seen more minutes
because fellow freshman Peter
Sauer has been limited by an
injured left hand and the flu. The
6-foot-10 forward / center has

responded to the increased play
ing time by dunking his way to a
9.6 scoring average over the past
five games.
"The freshmen have really
made progress," said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "The one
thing you can't change is the
physical aspect I mean, Mark
Seaton isn't any stronger (than at
the beginning of the year]. Out of
all of them, I think Kris Weems

has progressed the most."
At the beginning of the season,
Weems couldn't break into the
rotation because senior David
Harbour filled in at shooting
guard off the bench. When Har
bour moved into the starting line
up after Tim Young went down,
Weems suddenly became an
important offensive weapon.

Johnson tries to contain.
Over the past eight games, he
has averaged 10 minutes per
game and shot 50 percent from
behind the three-point line.
When senior Dion Cross was
struggling during the first half
on Saturday, Weems stepped in
and nailed two key threes to
help propel the Stanford come
back.
In an effort to avoid confu
sion for the younger players,
Montgomery has set forth dis
tinct roles for each reserve.
Each player knows where he fits
into the system, according to
Darren Allaway.
"Anyone here can play well,"
he said. "Everybody on the
bench wants to play and con
tribute, and everybody knows
their roles — nobody has to go
out and score 30. Everybody
here knows that if they don't
perform, their time is in jeop
ardy, but there's no overarching
pressure that you have to score
or have to rebound."

Last year's perfor
mance at Oregon
State is definitely a
motivating factor.'
— Darren Allaway

Sauer, who is practicing
again after sitting out the last
two games, said it's comfortable
knowing what each bench player
needs to do when he comes into
t he game.
"It's easy to prepare for a
game when you know you'll get
a chance to play," he said.
"There's one guy at each posi
tion coming in off the bench, so
it's easy for us to come in and
fill that role. You don't have to
do a lot of thinking, you just
come out and play."
Last month against Oregon
State, the Cardinal pressured
from the opening tip, taking
away the Beavers' stall tactics
by jumping out to an 18-2 lead.
Stanford won going away, 84-
51, as no starter played more
than 27 minutes.
That performance was a bit of
redemption for the Cardinal,
which lost to Oregon State last

year at Gill Coliseum, 90-71
The Beavers were then led b\
current NBA Slam Dunk cham
pion Brent Barry, who scored 33
points.
"It's a matter of our attitude
when we come out," Allawa_\
said. "We're constantly trying to
find something to motivate us
each game and last year's per
formance at Oregon State is def

initely a motivating factor."
Stanford shouldn't have to
worry as much about the
Beavers reaching up to bite
somebody this year — Oregon
State currently ranks last in the
Pac-10 in seven of the 12 major
team statistical categories and
no one on the team averages
more than 10.3 points per
game.

game and shot 50 percent from
behind the three-point line.
When senior Dion Cross was
struggling during the first half
on Saturday, Weems stepped in
and nailed two key threes to
help propel the Stanford come
back.
In an effort to avoid confu
sion for the younger players,
Montgomery has set forth dis
tinct roles for each reserve.
Each player knows where he fits
into the system, according to
Darren Allaway.
"Anyone here can play well,"
he said. "Everybody on the
bench wants to play and con
tribute, and everybody knows
their roles — nobody has to go
out and score 30. Everybody
here knows that if they don't
perform, their time is in jeop
ardy, but there's no overarching
pressure that you have to score
or have to rebound."

Last year's perfor
mance at Oregon
State is definitely a
motivating factor.'

Sauer, who is practicing
again after sitting out the last
two games, said it's comfortable
knowing what each bench player
needs to do when he comes into
t he game.
"It's easy to prepare for a
game when you know you'll get
a chance to play," he said.
"There's one guy at each posi
tion coming in off the bench, so
it's easy for us to come in and
fill that role. You don't have to
do a lot of thinking, you just
come out and play."
Last month against Oregon
State, the Cardinal pressured
from the opening tip, taking
away the Beavers' stall tactics
by jumping out to an 18-2 lead.
Stanford won going away, 84-
51, as no starter played more
than 27 minutes.
That performance was a bit of
redemption for the Cardinal,
which lost to Oregon State last

year at Gill Coliseum, 90-71
The Beavers were then led b\
current NBA Slam Dunk cham
pion Brent Barry, who scored 33
points.
"It's a matter of our attitude
when we come out," Allawa_\
said. "We're constantly trying to
find something to motivate us
each game and last year's per
formance at Oregon State is def

initely a motivating factor."
Stanford shouldn't have to
worry as much about the
Beavers reaching up to bite
somebody this year — Oregon
State currently ranks last in the
Pac-10 in seven of the 12 major
team statistical categories and
no one on the team averages
more than 10.3 points per
game.
