## Next stop: Oregon State No. 20 Cardinal faces Beavers tonight in Corvallis 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
One day you can be sitting on
the top of the world. The next,
Corvallis.
The No. 20 Stanford men's
basketball team suffers that
shock this week, fresh off last Sat
urday's 67-66 win over UCLA
that pulled it within one game of
the Pacific 10 Conference lead.
But you can only put off travel
ing to Oregon State for so long, and
Stanford's number has come up —
the Cardinal takes on the Beavers
at 7 p.m. tonight at Gill Coliseum.
Oregon State (3-17 overall, 1-
10 Pac-10) is coming off one of the
most inept weekends in recent
conference history. Mustering
only 42 points in a 19-point loss to
Washington State last Thursday,
the Beavers couldn't even reach
that offensive level against Wash
ington on Saturday, losing 50-40
and extending their losing streak
to nine games.
The offensive lows have not
occurred solely because Oregon
State is undermanned. Because
the Beavers lack the size and tal
ent of other Pac-10 teams, head
coach Eddie Payne's offensive phi
losophy is to let the other team
touch the ball as little as possible.
By eating up the clock on every
possession, the Beavers have limit
ed opponents to 68.3 points per
game, third-best in the conference.
Stanford (15-5, 8-3) sits on the
opposite end of the offensive spec
trum. The Cardinal has averaged
83.4 points during its current
five-game winning streak, with
much of the offensive boost com
ing from the bench. Led by fresh
man Mark Seaton, the Cardinal
reserves are averaging 20.4 points
per game over that span.
Seaton has seen more minutes
because fellow freshman Peter
Sauer has been limited by an
injured left hand and the flu. The
6-foot-10 forward / center has

responded to the increased play
ing time by dunking his way to a
9.6 scoring average over the past
five games.
"The freshmen have really
made progress," said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "The one
thing you can't change is the
physical aspect I mean, Mark
Seaton isn't any stronger (than at
the beginning of the year]. Out of
all of them, I think Kris Weems

has progressed the most."
At the beginning of the season,
Weems couldn't break into the
rotation because senior David
Harbour filled in at shooting
guard off the bench. When Har
bour moved into the starting line
up after Tim Young went down,
Weems suddenly became an
important offensive weapon.
