## Big weekend for swimmers 
### Ratha Harntha Staff writer 
The Stanford women's swim
ming team will have just one
thing on its mind when the Pacif
ic 10 Conference Championships
begin today in Long Beach, Calif.

— revenge.
"We are going to be foaming at
the mouth to win the conference
championship," said senior co
captain Jane Skillman.
USC snapped the Cardinal's
streak of 55 consecutive dual
meet victories on Jan. 27 with a

153-147 victory. It was the first
loss in head coach Richard
Quick's tenure at Stanford.
But USC didn't end all of Stan
ford's streaks. The Cardinal will be
looking to win its lOth-straight con
ference title when it takes to the
waters at the Ixmg Beach Aquatic
('enter this weekend. Last year,
Stanford destroyed the field at Pac
10's, winning 10 of the 18 competi
tions and beating its closest com
petitor, UCLA, by over 400 points.
The Cardinal also boasts the
most returning individual cham
pions of all the teams competing
this weekend. Stanford will have
three 1995 Pac-10 champions
defending their individual tit les.
Junior Claudia Franco won the
50-meter freestyle last year and
finished second in the 200-meter
free to Arizona's Ashley Tappin.

on in the 50- and 200-meter free,

Meanwhile, senior Jessica Tong

Stanford is one of two teams
that return more than one champi
on from hist year. The other squad,
Arizona State, has one swimmer
— Chris Jeffrey — who won two
titles hist year, the 500-meter free
and 400 individual medley.
To add to the team's experi
ence, the Cardinal also has at least
two swimmers back from each of
its four victorious relay teams of
last year. The entire 200-meter
free relay team (Tong, Franco and
sophomores Becky Bicknell and
Lindsay Gassner) will compete this
weekend, as well as three of the
four members from last season's
400- and 800-meter relay teams.
