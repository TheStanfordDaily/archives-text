# 15th-ranked Beavers next test for Stanford women
## 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
For the Stanford women's basketball team, the
best thing about Oregon State is that it isn't
UCLA.
After a second-consecutive nail-biter over the
mediocre Bruins (10-10, 5-6 Pacific 10 Confer
ence), the No. 4 Cardinal (18-2, 11-0) will greet
the only other team with even a remote shot at
the league crown tonight at 7 p.m. No. 15 Ore
gon State (16-4, 8-3) comes to Maples Pavilion
after pulling away from the Washington schools
last weekend to grab a firm grip on second place.
"Oregon State is always tough, and they're still
hanging in the Pac-10 race," said junior forward
Kate Starbird. "I think they're about the only
other team in there right now. It'll be fun and it
will also help to prepare us for the tournament
playing those strong teams right now."
The Beavers, the only Pac-10 team to knock off
Stanford in its last 40 conference games, are still
smarting from the 69-54 drubbing the Cardinal
handed them before a league-record 9,418 in Cor

vallis. In that contest, the Cardinal's suffocating
defense combined with lousy shooting from Ore
gon State as the Beavers managed only a 27.3 field
goal percentage.
OSU will need better than a batting average to
stop the Cardinal's 42-game Pac-10 winning streak
tonight. Senior Tanja Kostic, who is on a pace to
surpass former USC star Lisa Leslie's career Pac
-10 scoring record if Oregon State advances to the
NCAA regional semifinals, still leads the confer
ence in scoring and rebounding and stands at
eighth and 14th in the nation, respectively. She
scored 20 against the Cardinal in January, 13 more
than any of her teammates.
Under first-year head coach Judy Spoelstra,
the Beavers have shown flashes of brilliance,
but have slipped too often into inexplicable
funks, including a 19-point halftime deficit at
Arizona. The Beavers' weak bench has cost
them, and the shocking demise of center Tina
Lelas has left the senior-laden squad vulnera
ble.
