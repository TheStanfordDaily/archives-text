# 15th-ranked Beavers next test for Stanford women
## 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
For the Stanford women's basketball team, the
best thing about Oregon State is that it isn't
UCLA.
After a second-consecutive nail-biter over the
mediocre Bruins (10-10, 5-6 Pacific 10 Confer
ence), the No. 4 Cardinal (18-2, 11-0) will greet
the only other team with even a remote shot at
the league crown tonight at 7 p.m. No. 15 Ore
gon State (16-4, 8-3) comes to Maples Pavilion
after pulling away from the Washington schools
last weekend to grab a firm grip on second place.
"Oregon State is always tough, and they're still
hanging in the Pac-10 race," said junior forward
Kate Starbird. "I think they're about the only
other team in there right now. It'll be fun and it
will also help to prepare us for the tournament
playing those strong teams right now."
The Beavers, the only Pac-10 team to knock off
Stanford in its last 40 conference games, are still
smarting from the 69-54 drubbing the Cardinal
handed them before a league-record 9,418 in Cor

vallis. In that contest, the Cardinal's suffocating
defense combined with lousy shooting from Ore
gon State as the Beavers managed only a 27.3 field
goal percentage.
OSU will need better than a batting average to
stop the Cardinal's 42-game Pac-10 winning streak
tonight. Senior Tanja Kostic, who is on a pace to
surpass former USC star Lisa Leslie's career Pac
-10 scoring record if Oregon State advances to the
NCAA regional semifinals, still leads the confer
ence in scoring and rebounding and stands at
eighth and 14th in the nation, respectively. She
scored 20 against the Cardinal in January, 13 more
than any of her teammates.
Under first-year head coach Judy Spoelstra,
the Beavers have shown flashes of brilliance,
but have slipped too often into inexplicable
funks, including a 19-point halftime deficit at
Arizona. The Beavers' weak bench has cost
them, and the shocking demise of center Tina
Lelas has left the senior-laden squad vulnera
ble.
Heading into the season, Lelas
stood among the Pac-10's all-time
leaders in field goal percentage.
The 6-foot-5 junior terrorized
Stanford in last year's game at
Gill Coliseum, pouring in a
career-high 25. But she found
herself on the bench for most of
this year's contest with a shooting
percentage mired in the thirties.
Without Lelas, Kim McGrew and
Dawn Lewis, two centers with
limited offensive capabilities,
have filled in.
Senior point guard Boky
Vidic's numbers are also down
from last year, as is senior for
ward Anette Mollerstrom's field
goal percentage, but both remain
among the Pac-10's better players
at their positions. Shooting guard
A.J. Dionne fires threes better
than anybody on the Beavers, but
perimeter shooting remains the
Beavers' most glaring weakness.
The Cardinal appears to have
no such thing, especially at home.
With the Pac-10 home-court win
ning streak now over a half
decade old, Stanford continues to
win in nonconference games at
Maples at well. Two wins this
weekend would push Stanford
back ahead of Alcorn State for the
nation's longest overall home win
streak with 28, as the (wo squads
continue to jostle for the top spot.
Rebounding may be Stanford's
primary concern of the moment,
a.s board totals from the past four
games have steadily plummeted
from 53 against Washington
State to 29 against UCLA. The
Bruins, last in the conference in
rebounding margin, posted the
largest triumph in that category
of a Cardinal opponent this year,
with 10 more boards than Stan
ford.
Sophomore forward Naomi
Mulitauaopele must rebound
from her worst performance since
early December (four points, five
rebounds) and sophomore for
ward Heather Owen, who was
benched in the second half on
Sunday, must contribute off the
already-lean Cardinal bench. Star
bird, fifth in the Pac-10 in scoring
at 20.6 points per game, is on pace
to become the second player in
Stanford history to average 20 a
contest for a season. She has led
the way in points nine of the last
11 times for Stanford.

Fortunately for Stanford, no
quick guard like UCLA's Nickey
Hilbert will take over the game
for Oregon State. But Kostic and
Mollerstrom remain among the
deadliest one-two duos in the
Pac-10, and with only five sel
dom-used players returning next
year, tonight figures to be Ore
gon State's best chance to
dethrone the Cardinal for quite
some time.
With a win, Stanford will lead

the Pac-10 by four games with six
to go. For all intents and purpos
es, the Cardinal will have
wrapped up the crown, allowing
the team to focus on honing its
game for the NCAA tournament
and trying to earn a top seed in
the process. The close brush with
death at while not what
the Cardinal had in mind, still
provided the Cardinal with a vic
tory and some much-needed expe
rience in crunch situations.
