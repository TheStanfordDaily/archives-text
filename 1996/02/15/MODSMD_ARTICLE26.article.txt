It has now been 33 straight
matches without a loss for the
Stanford men's tennis team — a
streak that dates back to Novem
ber 25, 1994. The Cardinal
improved its record to a perfect 6-
0 yesterday afternoon with a
steady 6-1 victory over Pacific 10
Conference rival Washington.
With senior captain Jeff
Salzenstein unable to play due to
illness, the Cardinal was forced to
alter its lineup against the 40th
ranked Huskies. Sophomore Paul
Goldstein took over at the No. 1
singles spot, where he faced
Ornello Arlati, an Italian player
with a particularly powerful
serve. Goldstein was hindered by
a slight groin pull, and he strug
gled in the match, losing 6-3, 6-4.
"The guy I Arlati] played very
well. He didn't, miss many shots,"
Goldstein said. "I rushed things a
little today."
Head coach Dick Gould added,
"Arlati played the best match he's
ever played against us. Paul
played pretty well."
In the second singles match,
freshman Ryan Wolters easily
defeated junior Nick Williams, 6-
1, 6-3. Wolters, who lost to Andre
Agassi in the first, round of the
Sybase Open on Monday, said
that it was nice to be back in con
trol of a match.
"All those balls seemed like
they were going in slow motion
compared to Agassi," he said. "I
think that is why I played so well
in the first set today. It was like
there was nothing I could do
wrong." Indeed, Wolters broke

Williams on all but one of the
Husky's serving games.
Senior Jim Thomas said he felt
great about his play, too. Thomas,
who had a rare opportunity to
play on one of the three main
courts, blew Husky freshman
Eric Drew off the court in the
third singles match to raise his
dual-match record to an unblem
ished 5-0. Thomas repeatedly
nailed passing shots and serves on
the way to an easy 6-1, 6-1 win.
"It was a special day today,"
Thomas said. "I never get off the
court first."
Senior Grant Elliott had little
difficulty in the No. 4 singles slot
for the Cardinal.
"I felt very confident out there
today," he said. "I had a lot of fun

on the court. I was playing
aggressive and I just steamrolled
towards the end."
Elliott beat another Italian,
Stefano Rampazzo, 6-3, 6-1 to
improve his dual-match record to
an undefeated 5-0.
Cardinal senior Ricky Becker
narrowly defeated Washington's
Scott Moore, 6-1, 4-6, 7-5, in the
No. 5 singles position. The "Doc
tor," as Becker is called during
play, took longer than he would
have liked during his on-court
surgery yesterday.
"My intensity dropped off. It's
a tennis weakness of mine, no dif
ferent than a forehand or a back
hand," Becker said.

Sophomore Paul Goldstein filled the number one spot for the Cardi
nal yesterday in place of senior Jeff Salzenstein.
In spite of the struggle, Becker
preserved his perfect dual-match
record, winning his sixth
straight.

straight sets, 7-6, 6-4.
"I was a little nervous in the
first set, but I grew more confi
dent in the second. I started com
ing up to the net more," Palecek
said.
While the success of the sin
gles was certainly a good sign for
Stanford, Gould was even more
pleased with the doubles' perfor
mances. The Cardinal swept all

three doubles matches.
"Paul [Goldstein) and Jim
[Thomas] played big-time dou
bles out there," said Gould of his
first doubles team, which won 8-
3. "I can't say enough about Jim,
both in the singles and the dou
bles."
In the second doubles match,
Elliott and Wolters teamed up to
win 8-4. Elliott served back-to
back aces in the first game to kick
things off. Not to be outdone by
his partner, Wolters served up
three aces of his own in his first
service game.
Sophomore Charles Hoeveler
and Becker paired up in the third
doubles position. They had some
difficulty against a scrappy
Husky team, but were able to put
the match away in the end, 8-6.
Up next for the Cardinal are
the SMU Mustangs. That match
will take place at 1:30 this after
noon. Suffering from some minor
pulls and strains, Stanford is just
looking to get through the week
without any serious injuries.
"Tomorrow's match should be
a lot like today's," said Gould.
If all goes well for the Cardi
nal, the result will be a lot like
today's, too.
