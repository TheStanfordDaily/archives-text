# Women's water polo will kick off inaugural season
## No. 5 Cardinal begins first year as varsity sport 
### Erin Bryla 
The women's water polo team has more
to celebrate this weekend then merely
President's Day. After more than five
months of preseason work, it will finally
get to play a game.
But this isn't just any game. This is one
for the record books, for 1996 is the inau
gural season of women's water polo and
this weekend marks the program's first
game as a varsity sport. The fifth-ranked
Cardinal will open its season this Friday
against none other than fourth-ranked Cal
ifornia in a tournament at San Diego State.
"We're really excited about finally get
ting to play other teams and getting to see
all the hard work pay off," said freshman
hole-set Lindsay Tam.
The Stanford women are coming off a
21-10 record and a fifth-place finish in the
Western Division in 1995. But that was
last year, and with the addition of nine
freshmen to a strong group of returnees,
the Stanford women have even higher
hopes for 1996. Key players like junior
team captain Alice Cathcart and junior
Olivia White will be joined by prize
recruits Tam and Lindsay Welch. Also
expected to provide a major impact is

freshman goalie Heather Crary.
"She is the best young goalie out of
high school and a great athlete," said head
coach Ben Quittner.
Now it's just a matter of seeing what
this Cardinal squad so brimming with tal
ent will be able to do.
"I think we're going to surprise a lot of
people," Quittner said. "This is really a
hard-working team."
This dedication to hard work and a big
recruiting class will come in handy for a
team that expects to play more than fifty
games this season, including a showdown
with top-ranked UCLA.
In addition to Cal, the Cardinal will
also face No. 2 San Diego State and UC-
Santa Barbara when the women travel to
San Diego this weekend. Their results
against those three opponents will deter
mine whether or not they continue on
through the tournament. The team's
home opener takes place on March 8 as
part of the Stanford Tournament, which
runs through March 10.
"The girls work hard not only for
themselves, but [alsol because they want
to represent Stanford as well as all the
other Stanford aquatics sports do," Quit
tner said.
