# Men's rugby heads into the home stretch
## Cardinal looking forward to March 2 grudge match vs. Cal 
### Neal Sweeney 
Though not always mentioned in the same
breath with other dominant programs like swim
ming, tennis and volleyball, the Stanford men's
rugby team has quietly established itself as a
perennial powerhouse in recent years, attaining a
final national ranking as high as No. 2.
This year, following two tough tests over the
next seven days against a pair of strong Canadian
teams, the rugby team must focus on a March 2
showdown with California if it hopes to achieve its
ultimate goal — the elusive national title.
Last year, the Cardinal finished second in the
Pacific Coast Rugby Union, losing to Cal in the con
ference championship game in a battle of the nation's
top two teams. The Golden Bears, winners of the
eight consecutive national championships and eleven
of the last twelve, defeated Stanford in heartbreaking
fashion by a mere three points, denying the Cardinal
a chance to move on to the national semifinals.
The bitter taste of that loss makes this season's
game that much more important.
"Most of our guys are returning from last year
and we remember that game well," said senior
Chris Grasso. "We've been shooting for Cal for
four years and this is our last chance."
In addition to the revenge factor, this year's
rugby version of Big Game holds added signifi
cance because of Stanford's unexpected 13-5 loss
to UC-Davis on January 27. The upset loss served
as a wake-up call to the team and put the Cardinal
in a must-win situation for each of its remaining
league games.

Canadian opponents in the week to come.
"All our emphasis is being put

captain Bobby Blunt.

In terms of competition, Stan
ford will face its most serious
tests of the season in its next two
games. The Cardinal faces the
University of British Columbia
Sunday at 1 p.m. and the Univer
sity of Victoria on Wednesday at 4
p.m., with both games being
played at Maloney Field. Despite
playing the underdog to two of
the top teams in North America,
Stanford traditionally plays these

Canadian teams tough, losing to
Victoria by just 13 points last
year.
Because of the disparity in the
level of competition among col
lege rugby teams, Stanford has
not been challenged in most of its
games to date, with its six wins
coming by a combined score of
298-29. British Columbia and
Victoria should provide a chal
lenge and help the team get ready
for Cal.
"These should be exciting
games," Blunt said. "To play at
their level, we'll have to play a
cohesive game. This should be a
big test and should show us where
we are in our progress through
the season."
Even though eight of Stan
ford's players were recognized
last year as All-Pacific Coast
selections, the team feels its suc
cess is due to teamwork and blue
collar play rather than the efforts
of a few exceptional players.
"Our passing and support
game and our style of play makes
everyone better," Blunt said.
Rugby also means much more
than a sport to many players.
"In past years we were a young
team, |so we've) been playing

together for a few years now,"
Grasso said. "If you ask some of
the guys, a lot of their best friends
are guys on the team. We have a
good working relationship and
push each other to make each

'We're really a
tight, cohesive team.'

other better."
Added senior Shervin
Malekzadeh: "We're really a
tight, cohesive team, with no
egos. This is probably because of
the nature of the game and the
group of guys we have."
As they enter their most cru
cial stretch of the season, the
Stanford men must rely on their
blue-collar, relentless style of
play if they hope to show that
they belong at the same level as
British Columbia and Victoria.
More importantly, however, the
Cardinal will seek to dispel old
demons by finally beating Cal. If
it can rise to the challenge, men's
rugby very well might be Stan
ford's first national champion of
1996.
