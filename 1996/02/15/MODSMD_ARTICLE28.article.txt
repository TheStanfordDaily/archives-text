# Men's rugby heads into the home stretch
## Cardinal looking forward to March 2 grudge match vs. Cal 
### Neal Sweeney 
Though not always mentioned in the same
breath with other dominant programs like swim
ming, tennis and volleyball, the Stanford men's
rugby team has quietly established itself as a
perennial powerhouse in recent years, attaining a
final national ranking as high as No. 2.
This year, following two tough tests over the
next seven days against a pair of strong Canadian
teams, the rugby team must focus on a March 2
showdown with California if it hopes to achieve its
ultimate goal — the elusive national title.
Last year, the Cardinal finished second in the
Pacific Coast Rugby Union, losing to Cal in the con
ference championship game in a battle of the nation's
top two teams. The Golden Bears, winners of the
eight consecutive national championships and eleven
of the last twelve, defeated Stanford in heartbreaking
fashion by a mere three points, denying the Cardinal
a chance to move on to the national semifinals.
The bitter taste of that loss makes this season's
game that much more important.
"Most of our guys are returning from last year
and we remember that game well," said senior
Chris Grasso. "We've been shooting for Cal for
four years and this is our last chance."
In addition to the revenge factor, this year's
rugby version of Big Game holds added signifi
cance because of Stanford's unexpected 13-5 loss
to UC-Davis on January 27. The upset loss served
as a wake-up call to the team and put the Cardinal
in a must-win situation for each of its remaining
league games.
