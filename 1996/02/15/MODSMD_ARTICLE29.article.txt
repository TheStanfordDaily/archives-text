# For the record

### 
Daily stories have incorrectly
stated that a proposed ASSU bill
would reduce the current cam
paign spending limit for senate
candidates from $120 to $60. The
current limit is $90, not $120.
Also, an article in yesterday's
Daily incorrectly stated that most
of the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center will be closed as the re
sult of a minor fire. Only the ac
celerator will be closed, not the en
tire center.
