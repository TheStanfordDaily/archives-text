# Chang to join hunt for new CSRE profs
## Shoven accedes to student demands 
### Marni Leff Contributing writer 
Ten days after the deadline passed for a
threatened boycott of the University's new
ethnic studies program, both sides involved
in the controversy seem to be making con
cessions in order to move forward in develop
ing the curriculum.
Responding to student and faculty con
cerns about the Asian-American Studies
component of the Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity program, the Political
Science Department has added History Prof.
Gordon Chang to its search committee for a
faculty member to teach in the new program.
However, the department denied re
quests by the CSRE committee and the stu
dent group Concerned Students for Asian
American Studies to add students to the
search panel as well.
Chang, who teaches courses in Asian-
American history, is one of the professors

CSAAS has called on Dean of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven to include in the
hiring process for CSRE.
Controversy over the CSRE program and
specifically how to hire professors for it has
been mounting since last month. CSAAS
members claimed they were not sufficiently
consulted in the decision early in the quarter
to hire a sociologist who would also teach in
the Asian-American Studies component of
CSRE.
Late last month, CSAAS sent a memo to
Shoven demanding a larger role in the search
process for CSRE candidates as well as the
appointment of a senior Asian-American
Studies professor by the end of the next
school year.
After meeting with CSAAS members last
week, History Prof. A 1 Camarillo, chairman
of the committee charged with creating the
CSRE program, sent a list of suggested
courses of action to Shoven. The
suggestions dealt mainly with the
search process for hiring CSRE fac
ulty members, but dropped the
original student calls for hiring a
senior Asian-American Studies
professor.
Although both the faculty com
mittee and CSAAS pushed for stu
dent involvement in selecting fac
ulty for the program, members of
the student group said they are
pleased with Chang's appoint
ment.
"The big thing for CSAAS was
getting someone on the committee
who would represent the interests
of the Asian-American Studies
discipline," said Jane Kim, CSAAS
representative. "So we're really
pleased with that.
"Obviously, it would have been
nice for a student to be on the com
mittee," she added, concluding,
"We weren't saying that all our de
mands had to be met right away.
We just wanted [Shoven] to re
spond satisfactorily. It's more im
portant to focus on the people get
ting hired right now."
CSAAS' original memo to
Shoven, dated Jan. 29, threatened
a public boycott and a national
campaign against the program if
Shoven did not commit to the de
mands in writing by Feb. 2.
Shoven met with CSRE com
mittee members Tuesday to dis
cuss Camarillo's memo. He met
with CSAAS members yesterday,
going over much of the same infor
mation. "We made a lot of con
structive progress," Shoven said.

Shoven said he explained to
CSRE committee members that
he believes in conducting searches
through departments before look
ing at interdisciplinary appoint
ments.
"We understand that Dean
Shoven has a preference for de
partmental searches," Camarillo
said. "We wanted him to acknowl
edge the possibility of an interdis
ciplinary search and consider it as
an alternative plan if the depart
ment searches fail to find candi
dates. He was not in favor of it but
did not rule it out either."
Cenerally pleased with the out
come of Tuesday's discussion with
Shoven, CSRE committee mem
bers said they felt the meeting had
a "cooperative" attitude.
"Dean Shoven clearly looked at
the suggestions seriously and gave
us good feedback," said Compara
tive Literature Prof. David
Palumbo-Liu. "I think the meet
ing clarified things and gave all
parties a chance to make their con
cerns known to each other."
Though CSAAS members feel
that Shoven responded adequate
ly to their concerns, they urged
the dean to put his response in
writing.
"It would be a benefit both for
CSAAS and Shoven if the agree
ment were to go into writing,"
Kim said. "Obviously, it could be
changed, but having some kind of
a process for hiring professors for
CSRE could really prevent future
conflicts."
Shoven said he has urged the
political science search commit
tee to reach a decision on a new
appointment soon, as the season
for hiring is already nearing its
close.
