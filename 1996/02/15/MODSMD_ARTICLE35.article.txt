## mingling with Adam Sandler 
### Malcolm Maclachlan 
In "Happy Gilmore," Adam Sandler
plays a pro golfer whose moment of
truth comes when he gets his ass kicked
by Bob Barker.
In the film, Happy is a wanna-be pro hock
ey player with a killer slapshot and no skating
ability. By a lucky coincidence, he discovers
years of hockey have given him the ability to
whack a golf ball 400 yards. To save his grand
mother's house from foreclosure, he takes to
the pro golf tour. He brings a hockey player's
working class style — and tendency to throw
punches at the drop of a hat — to the snobbish
world of the PGA .
Just as Happy sticks out on the golf course,
Sandler looks out of place in San Francisco's
swanky Kit/ Carlton hotel, where he has come
to meet the Bav Area college press. The 29-

year-old comic wears a Yankee cap
and a washed-out orange Nike t
shirt (even the janitors here are (
dressed more formally). He

comes around the table and
personally greets each re
porter before the interview

— and personally says good-bye after
wards. This seems appropriate for a guy
who keeps his fame in perspective; he

ven admits that he still gets mistaken for
Beastie Boy every now and then.

"And it's a different one each
time," he says.

Sandler has made a career
out of playing normal guys with
a comic twist. Happy is some

tine who a lot of people can
identify with, he says.

"He's a sweet guy. He loves his grandmoth
er. It automatically makes you feel good to see
a guy like that."
Or it makes some people feel good. Sandler
has gained a reputation for offending people
with filthy language and sometimes tasteless
humor. While he says "Happy Gilmore" has a
"warmer feel" than most of the work he has
done, Sandler knows it's not going to win over
people who didn't like him in the first place.
He says pleasing his 18- to 32-year-old core au
dience is all he needs.
"When a 50-year-old lady goes to see my
movie, 1 know she won't like it,"he says."I
don't really read the critics. They're pretty
harsh on me. When I write, I'm thinking 'Col
lege guys are going to like this.'"

Sandler is also releasing his second comedy
album, "What the Hell Happened to Me?" It is
a chaotic, irreverent collection of skits popu
lated by farting hypnotists, horny cult mem
bers and a talking goat. The highlight of the
album is the now-classic "Chanukah Song"
from Saturday Night Live, which received fre
quent radio play over the holidays. The song
lists famous Jewish entertainers with lines
such as "Paul Newman's half-Jewish / Goldie
Hawn's half too / Put them together / What a
fine looking Jew!" and "O.J. Simpson / Not a
Jew!"
"Growing up in New Hampshire, there
weren't that many other lews around. I re
member seeing Paul Newman on TV. My
mom told me he was half-Jewish. That made
me very proud."
Sandler says he did not always know he
wanted to be an entertainer.
"I wasn't a show off or a bie ham. I was al

ways a little nervous to make a big spectacle of
myself. But then 1 would eo ahead and do it

nyway.
This reluctance was reflected in a

stand-up career that he admits was a lit
tle slow to get going. Many of his early
shows, done mostly in Greenwich Vil

lage while he was attending NYU,
went badly. Still, he eventually started
touring and then signed with Satur
day Night Live, working as a writer
for two years before he ever appeared
in a skit.
As they say, the rest is history. San
dler, who quickly became one of the
most popular performers on the
show, says SNI. is the best training a
comic can have.

"Saturday Night I.ive is the hardest show to
do, because it's live," he says. "You work hard all
week to get everything right because you don't
want to look like an idiot on national TV."
Though he left SNI. after last season, he says
there is nothing wrong with the show.
"The media decides to come in and say
something's wrong," he says. "When I was on
SNL, there was a time we were crazy hot. We
were on the cover of TV Guide all the time.
They take turns on you."
He also says the show gave him valuable ex
perience working with different writers. San
dler says working with writers he doesn't know
well can be problem.
"When you've got that polite shit going on,
you'll put something in because you want to

know how to say it sucks. I get most of my ma
terial goofing off in the car with my friends.
That's the beauty of working with my friends.
We're brutal."
Sandler has made two movies that lam
poon upper-class snobbery, including last
year's "Billy Madison," in which he played a
rich boy who had to repeat every grade. In
"Happy Ciilmore," his character gains a cult
following with his expletive-laden antics.
Some of the funniest scenes show 1 lappv's fans
— a collection of hippies, bikers, metalheads
and other misfits — overrunning exclusive
golf courses. 1 feeven hires a disheveled home
less man as his caddie.
However, when he is asked if the film is an
attempt to address economic frustration in an
age of corporate downsizing and runaway ex
ecutive salaries, Sandler just shakes his head
and laughs.

"I just thought it
would be funny to
make a movie about a
hockey player who
went on the golf tour
but was oblivious to
the etiquette. I'm not
trying to make fun of
golf."
Oddly enough,
Sandler never played
hockey while growing
up in New York and
New Hampshire. In
stead he played golf
"about once a year."
He still occasionally
golfs with friends and
can shoot in the 90s.
The inspiration for the
film came from a
friend who now plays
hockey in Norway:
"My dad and I took
him to the driving
range once. The guy
had never played golf
before, but he could
drive a golf ball like
450 yards. All these
people were jealous of
him."
Hut the question on
everyone's mind is:
What's it like to get
beat up by Bob Bark
er?
"We just wrote him
into script. We sent it
to him and we were
actually kind of sur
prised when he said
yes.
"And yes, we ad
libbed the bitch part,"
Sandler says, referring
to the end of the fight
scene where Barker
kicks him in the face

and says,"I think you've had enough, hitch."
"He's stronger than you would think," San
dler says. "He's taller than me, and I think he's
in better shape than me. I didn't take my shirt
off in front of him. And he can fight. He's stud
ied with Chuck Norris."
The meeting has blossomed into an oft
screen friendship between the two perform
ers. Barker, Sandler and Alan Covert (San
tiler's NYU buddy, whom he cast as Otto the
caddie because "I wanted to hang out with
him for a little while") recently went out to
dinner.
"Bob's still a huge star," Sandler says. "No
one in the restaurant was even looking at me.
Sandler has also made an appearance on
"The Price is Right."
"I got to pose by the car when Bob said V\
new corvette!' It was cool."

mother's house from foreclosure, he takes to
the pro golf tour. He brings a hockey player's
working class style — and tendency to throw
punches at the drop of a hat — to the snobbish
world of the PGA .
Just as Happy sticks out on the golf course,
Sandler looks out of place in San Francisco's
swanky Kit/ Carlton hotel, where he has come
to meet the Bav Area college press. The 29-

year-old comic wears a Yankee cap
and a washed-out orange Nike t
shirt (even the janitors here are (
dressed more formally). He

comes around the table and
personally greets each re
porter before the interview

— and personally says good-bye after
wards. This seems appropriate for a guy
who keeps his fame in perspective; he

ven admits that he still gets mistaken for
Beastie Boy every now and then.

"And it's a different one each
time," he says.

Sandler has made a career
out of playing normal guys with
a comic twist. Happy is some

tine who a lot of people can
identify with, he says.

"He's a sweet guy. He loves his grandmoth
er. It automatically makes you feel good to see
a guy like that."
Or it makes some people feel good. Sandler
has gained a reputation for offending people
with filthy language and sometimes tasteless
humor. While he says "Happy Gilmore" has a
"warmer feel" than most of the work he has
done, Sandler knows it's not going to win over
people who didn't like him in the first place.
He says pleasing his 18- to 32-year-old core au
dience is all he needs.
"When a 50-year-old lady goes to see my
movie, 1 know she won't like it,"he says."I
don't really read the critics. They're pretty
harsh on me. When I write, I'm thinking 'Col
lege guys are going to like this.'"

Sandler is also releasing his second comedy
album, "What the Hell Happened to Me?" It is
a chaotic, irreverent collection of skits popu
lated by farting hypnotists, horny cult mem
bers and a talking goat. The highlight of the
album is the now-classic "Chanukah Song"
from Saturday Night Live, which received fre
quent radio play over the holidays. The song
lists famous Jewish entertainers with lines
such as "Paul Newman's half-Jewish / Goldie
Hawn's half too / Put them together / What a
fine looking Jew!" and "O.J. Simpson / Not a
Jew!"
"Growing up in New Hampshire, there
weren't that many other lews around. I re
member seeing Paul Newman on TV. My
mom told me he was half-Jewish. That made
me very proud."
Sandler says he did not always know he
wanted to be an entertainer.
"I wasn't a show off or a bie ham. I was al

ways a little nervous to make a big spectacle of
myself. But then 1 would eo ahead and do it

nyway.
This reluctance was reflected in a

stand-up career that he admits was a lit
tle slow to get going. Many of his early
shows, done mostly in Greenwich Vil

lage while he was attending NYU,
went badly. Still, he eventually started
touring and then signed with Satur
day Night Live, working as a writer
for two years before he ever appeared
in a skit.
As they say, the rest is history. San
dler, who quickly became one of the
most popular performers on the
show, says SNI. is the best training a
comic can have.

"Saturday Night I.ive is the hardest show to
do, because it's live," he says. "You work hard all
week to get everything right because you don't
want to look like an idiot on national TV."
Though he left SNI. after last season, he says
there is nothing wrong with the show.
"The media decides to come in and say
something's wrong," he says. "When I was on
SNL, there was a time we were crazy hot. We
were on the cover of TV Guide all the time.
They take turns on you."
He also says the show gave him valuable ex
perience working with different writers. San
dler says working with writers he doesn't know
well can be problem.
"When you've got that polite shit going on,
you'll put something in because you want to

know how to say it sucks. I get most of my ma
terial goofing off in the car with my friends.
That's the beauty of working with my friends.
We're brutal."
Sandler has made two movies that lam
poon upper-class snobbery, including last
year's "Billy Madison," in which he played a
rich boy who had to repeat every grade. In
"Happy Ciilmore," his character gains a cult
following with his expletive-laden antics.
Some of the funniest scenes show 1 lappv's fans
— a collection of hippies, bikers, metalheads
and other misfits — overrunning exclusive
golf courses. 1 feeven hires a disheveled home
less man as his caddie.
However, when he is asked if the film is an
attempt to address economic frustration in an
age of corporate downsizing and runaway ex
ecutive salaries, Sandler just shakes his head
and laughs.

"I just thought it
would be funny to
make a movie about a
hockey player who
went on the golf tour
but was oblivious to
the etiquette. I'm not
trying to make fun of
golf."
Oddly enough,
Sandler never played
hockey while growing
up in New York and
New Hampshire. In
stead he played golf
"about once a year."
He still occasionally
golfs with friends and
can shoot in the 90s.
The inspiration for the
film came from a
friend who now plays
hockey in Norway:
"My dad and I took
him to the driving
range once. The guy
had never played golf
before, but he could
drive a golf ball like
450 yards. All these
people were jealous of
him."
Hut the question on
everyone's mind is:
What's it like to get

"We just wrote him

to him and we were

yes.
"And yes, we ad

Sandler says, referring
to the end of the fight
scene where Barker
kicks him in the face

and says,"I think you've had enough, hitch."
"He's stronger than you would think," San
dler says. "He's taller than me, and I think he's
in better shape than me. I didn't take my shirt
off in front of him. And he can fight. He's stud
ied with Chuck Norris."
The meeting has blossomed into an oft
screen friendship between the two perform
ers. Barker, Sandler and Alan Covert (San
tiler's NYU buddy, whom he cast as Otto the
caddie because "I wanted to hang out with
him for a little while") recently went out to
dinner.
"Bob's still a huge star," Sandler says. "No
one in the restaurant was even looking at me.
Sandler has also made an appearance on
"The Price is Right."
"I got to pose by the car when Bob said V\
new corvette!' It was cool."

In "Happy Gilmore," Adam Sandler

ey player with a killer slapshot and no skating
ability. By a lucky coincidence, he discovers
years of hockey have given him the ability to
whack a golf ball 400 yards. To save his grand
mother's house from foreclosure, he takes to
