# Crisis at The lop The Warner controversy
## 
### Story by Paul Resnikoff Graphic by Mike Noren 
As the dust settles over a harrowing 199S
for the entertain men t conglomerate Time
Warner, one can only hope for a kinder,
gentler '96. In an unprecedented conver
gence of special interests and public accusa
tions, Time Warner became the center of a
public relations nightmare that ended with
multiple firings and break-ups.
Sparked bv public outrage over the lyri
cal content of gangsta rap releases by Snoop
Doggy Dogg, Dr. Pre and Tupac Shakur, the
maelstrom centered around the Compton,
Calif, rap label Death Row Records and its
immediate owner, Interscope Records —
home to similarly controversial Nine Inch
Nails. But the biggest heat traveled straight
to the top, creating a pressure cooker at
Time Warner (which partially owns Inter
scope) that ultimately revolutionized the
entertainment industry.
The Kaid from Cdpitol Hill
In a ruthless headhunt piloted by Rep. C.
Delores Tucker (D - Georgia), Capitol Hill
began a merciless charge on the Warner
giant by eroding the conglomerate's reputa
tion in the press. Tucker, an impassioned
liberal with a history of black and women's
rights fights, agreed to trailblaze the moral
pass of rap opposition with career arch
conservative William Bennett.
But the real spotlight belonged to Senate

Majority Leader Bob Dole, the heavy
weight Republican presidential

hopeful who carved his
initials into the
issue

with his famous "Hollywood Speech."
From the heights of the Capitol, Dole
scolded Time Warner for its blatant greedi
ness: "And I would ask the executives of
Time Warner a question: Is this what you
intend to do with your careers? Must you
debase our nation and threaten our chil
dren for the sake of corporate profits?" This
question sent more than a shiver through
Time Warner's backbone.
Warner a shaky empire
Despite Warner's intimidating presence
in the music industry, its fragile internal re
lationships have made it an unwieldy
Roman Empire, suffering from power
struggles at all levels. Recent attacks on
Death Row, Interscope, and Warner com
plicated the fragile ownership arrangement
and threw the royal entertainment family
into near dysfunction.
At die top levels, where usurpations and

neck-slashing have almost
becomc part of the execu
tive job description, the re
cent tirade against Time
Warner only served as a
catalyst for internal strug
gle. In the latest round of
head-rolling, former
Chairman and CHO of
Warner Music Group
Michael ]. Fuchs curtly dis
missed longtime executive
and gangsta rap defender
Doug Morris. Several days

later, l uchs kept the heat
on by dismissing Danny Goldberg, perhaps
the most vocal gangsta rap defender of them

all.
Gerald Levin, once the brash Chairman
and "King" of the Time Warner royal fami
ly, remained unusually quiet through the
recent volleys with Congress. For Levin, as

suming a God-fatherly calm may have
been a tactic to let the situation simmer

down and possibly avert a dreaded
divorce between Warner and the

lucrative Death Row.
Despite crippling turmoil
at the top levels, there is no
mistake in executive's minds
L ii . .. .. r- »ii

that new financial bottom
lines must dictate corpo
rate attention to long

term reputation con
siderations. The recent
merger with led Turn
er's cable network, fi
nalised by all parties
involved, is still sub

ject to review by the
Federal Communica
tions Commission

as well as the Fed
eral Trade Com
mission.

The re
sult is that, in
the short run,

corporate inter
ests required that
First Amendment

defenders like Mor
ris and Goldberg be

sacrificed. With them
gone, Time Warner has
swept out a tradition of
standing behind contro

verbal and explicit acts and
quickly ushered in a cautious cul
ture of "no comment."

The First Amendment
becomes secondary

in the recent Death Row scandal, the
First Amendment's staunches! defenders
have been sent packing. Goldberg, the most
vocal of the ousted squad, is champion of
"Moral Majority," a consortium of industry
zealots determined to stand their ground on
Constitutional freedom of

speech and expression is
sues.
With a long history of
defending gangsta rap,
Goldberg also heads the
California chapter of the
American Civil Liberties
Union, a collection of con
stitutional freedom fight
ers aptly suited to Gold
berg's crusade. Although
his passionate defenses of
all things controversial
were once considered

heroic in Warner offices, his
latest round of liberal-style fist-thumping
has created more waves than Time Warner

can afford to float on.
Often considered a member of the
"Doug Morris Camp," Goldberg was part of
a slew of die-hard executives determined
not to bow to pressure from Congress,
shareholders or the public. However, three
years after thelce-T conflict, "King W'arner"
has twice the debt and three times the stake
in coming out of this controversy un
scathed. Its new chief rival, the fresh merger
of Disney and Capital Cities / ABC, has yet
to be stymied by such a public relations pit
fall. For Warner, a bad public image is far
from advantageous.
Silence from the While 1 louse
Although the crusadingC. Delores Tuck
er crossed traditional boundaries to em
brace the ideologies of conservatives Dole
and Bennett, she was not joined by Presi
dent Clinton. The President, a recipient of
major funds from many in Hollywood and
the record industry, has had very few words
to say on the rap lyrics controversy.
In last year's State of the Union Address,
he asked Hollywood "to assess the impact of
its work and to understand the damage that
comes from the incessant, repetitive, mind
less violence and irresponsible conduct that
permeates our media all the time."
Yet Clinton has not singled out any one

pur
veyor of
such irrespon

sibilities and has
hesitated to step
up the rhetoric.

Warner Music Group
executives — including Danny Gold

berg — contributed large amounts to Gin
ton's campaign, suggesting that Time Warn
er superiors may have dismissed Goldberg
in an act of Republican appeasement. Trick
ier for the Time Warner firing squad, how
ever, was the case of Ted Field, controller of
Interscope, which owns the Death Row cash
crop, not to mention other lucrative acts
such as Nine Inch Nails and Primus.
Worth an estimated $700 million, Field
is the fifth largest contributor to the Demo
crat ic Party and a staunch defender of
gangsta rap: "You can tell the people who
want to stop us from releasing controversial
rap music one thing: kiss my ass, 1 * he taunts.
Warner, only a partial owner of the Inter
scope entity, regarded Field's controversial
PR approach as problematic. But Field, not
ame rnbe ro 112 the Warner executive brass and
immune from traditional pink slips, could
only be eliminated if Warner divorced itself
from the Interscope empire. In the end, that
is exactly what Warner did.
lile dffer the head-rolling
Meanwhile, executive life goes on at
Time Warner. Taking Goldbergs place at
the executive roundtable is a man of ad
mirable tenure, Russ Thyret, a twenty-six
year Warner Music Group veteran. In what
Fuchs has heralded "a new era of stability
and growth," Thyret is expected to be the
living opposite of Goldberg.
In the face of overwhelming dilemma,
Levin couldn't hope for a calmer and less
controversial executive. In the words of
Howie Klein, president of the Reprise
record label, "If ever there was one person
I've met who should be President of the
United States, tor the good of the country,
it's Russ Thyret.''
Such statesmanship is quite foreign to
Warner — and the industry too. It is only
with this vanguard, Warner might hope,
that attacks from Washington can be mini
mized. Controversy, according to Time
Warner, starts at the top.

As the dust settles over a harrowing 199S
for the entertain men t conglomerate Time
Warner, one can only hope for a kinder,
gentler '96. In an unprecedented conver
gence of special interests and public accusa
tions, Time Warner became the center of a
public relations nightmare that ended with
multiple firings and break-ups.
Sparked bv public outrage over the lyri
cal content of gangsta rap releases by Snoop
Doggy Dogg, Dr. Pre and Tupac Shakur, the
maelstrom centered around the Compton,
Calif, rap label Death Row Records and its
immediate owner, Interscope Records —
home to similarly controversial Nine Inch
Nails. But the biggest heat traveled straight
to the top, creating a pressure cooker at
Time Warner (which partially owns Inter
scope) that ultimately revolutionized the
entertainment industry.
The Kaid from Cdpitol Hill
In a ruthless headhunt piloted by Rep. C.
Delores Tucker (D - Georgia), Capitol Hill
began a merciless charge on the Warner
giant by eroding the conglomerate's reputa

liberal with a history of black and women's
rights fights, agreed to trailblaze the moral
pass of rap opposition with career arch
conservative William Bennett.

initials into the
issue

with his famous "Hollywood Speech."
From the heights of the Capitol, Dole
scolded Time Warner for its blatant greedi
ness: "And I would ask the executives of
Time Warner a question: Is this what you
intend to do with your careers? Must you
debase our nation and threaten our chil
dren for the sake of corporate profits?" This
question sent more than a shiver through
Time Warner's backbone.
Warner a shaky empire
Despite Warner's intimidating presence
in the music industry, its fragile internal re
lationships have made it an unwieldy
Roman Empire, suffering from power
struggles at all levels. Recent attacks on
Death Row, Interscope, and Warner com
plicated the fragile ownership arrangement
and threw the royal entertainment family
into near dysfunction.
At die top levels, where usurpations and

neck-slashing have almost
becomc part of the execu
tive job description, the re
cent tirade against Time
Warner only served as a
catalyst for internal strug
gle. In the latest round of
head-rolling, former
Chairman and CHO of
Warner Music Group
Michael ]. Fuchs curtly dis
missed longtime executive
and gangsta rap defender
Doug Morris. Several days

later, l uchs kept the heat
on by dismissing Danny Goldberg, perhaps
the most vocal gangsta rap defender of them

all.
Gerald Levin, once the brash Chairman
and "King" of the Time Warner royal fami
ly, remained unusually quiet through the
recent volleys with Congress. For Levin, as

suming a God-fatherly calm may have
been a tactic to let the situation simmer

down and possibly avert a dreaded
divorce between Warner and the

lucrative Death Row.
Despite crippling turmoil
at the top levels, there is no
mistake in executive's minds
L ii . .. .. r- »ii

that new financial bottom
lines must dictate corpo
rate attention to long

term reputation con
siderations. The recent
merger with led Turn
er's cable network, fi
nalised by all parties
involved, is still sub

ject to review by the
Federal Communica
tions Commission

as well as the Fed
eral Trade Com
mission.

The re
sult is that, in
the short run,

corporate inter
ests required that
First Amendment

defenders like Mor
ris and Goldberg be

sacrificed. With them
gone, Time Warner has
swept out a tradition of
standing behind contro

verbal and explicit acts and
quickly ushered in a cautious cul
ture of "no comment."

The First Amendment
becomes secondary

in the recent Death Row scandal, the
First Amendment's staunches! defenders
have been sent packing. Goldberg, the most
vocal of the ousted squad, is champion of
"Moral Majority," a consortium of industry
zealots determined to stand their ground on
Constitutional freedom of

speech and expression is
sues.
With a long history of
defending gangsta rap,
Goldberg also heads the
California chapter of the
American Civil Liberties
Union, a collection of con
stitutional freedom fight
ers aptly suited to Gold
berg's crusade. Although
his passionate defenses of
all things controversial
were once considered

heroic in Warner offices, his
latest round of liberal-style fist-thumping
has created more waves than Time Warner

can afford to float on.
Often considered a member of the
"Doug Morris Camp," Goldberg was part of
a slew of die-hard executives determined
not to bow to pressure from Congress,
shareholders or the public. However, three
years after thelce-T conflict, "King W'arner"
has twice the debt and three times the stake
in coming out of this controversy un
scathed. Its new chief rival, the fresh merger
of Disney and Capital Cities / ABC, has yet
to be stymied by such a public relations pit
fall. For Warner, a bad public image is far
from advantageous.
Silence from the While 1 louse
Although the crusadingC. Delores Tuck
er crossed traditional boundaries to em
brace the ideologies of conservatives Dole
and Bennett, she was not joined by Presi
dent Clinton. The President, a recipient of
major funds from many in Hollywood and
the record industry, has had very few words
to say on the rap lyrics controversy.
In last year's State of the Union Address,
he asked Hollywood "to assess the impact of
its work and to understand the damage that
comes from the incessant, repetitive, mind
less violence and irresponsible conduct that
permeates our media all the time."
Yet Clinton has not singled out any one

pur
veyor of
such irrespon

sibilities and has
hesitated to step
up the rhetoric.

Warner Music Group
executives — including Danny Gold

berg — contributed large amounts to Gin
ton's campaign, suggesting that Time Warn
er superiors may have dismissed Goldberg
in an act of Republican appeasement. Trick
ier for the Time Warner firing squad, how
ever, was the case of Ted Field, controller of
Interscope, which owns the Death Row cash
crop, not to mention other lucrative acts
such as Nine Inch Nails and Primus.
Worth an estimated $700 million, Field
is the fifth largest contributor to the Demo
crat ic Party and a staunch defender of
gangsta rap: "You can tell the people who
want to stop us from releasing controversial
rap music one thing: kiss my ass, 1 * he taunts.
Warner, only a partial owner of the Inter
scope entity, regarded Field's controversial
PR approach as problematic. But Field, not
ame rnbe ro 112 the Warner executive brass and
immune from traditional pink slips, could
only be eliminated if Warner divorced itself
from the Interscope empire. In the end, that
is exactly what Warner did.
lile dffer the head-rolling
Meanwhile, executive life goes on at
Time Warner. Taking Goldbergs place at
the executive roundtable is a man of ad
mirable tenure, Russ Thyret, a twenty-six
year Warner Music Group veteran. In what
Fuchs has heralded "a new era of stability
and growth," Thyret is expected to be the
living opposite of Goldberg.
In the face of overwhelming dilemma,
Levin couldn't hope for a calmer and less
controversial executive. In the words of
Howie Klein, president of the Reprise
record label, "If ever there was one person
I've met who should be President of the
United States, tor the good of the country,
it's Russ Thyret.''
Such statesmanship is quite foreign to
Warner — and the industry too. It is only
with this vanguard, Warner might hope,
that attacks from Washington can be mini
mized. Controversy, according to Time
Warner, starts at the top.
