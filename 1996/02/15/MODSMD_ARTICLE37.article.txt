## MTV's Unplugged Loses its Luster 
### Taylor Antrim 
A whiff of unheed
ed paradox sur
rounds the MTV
Unplugged CD
ROM like gone
over perfume.
MTV seems bliss
fully unaware of its
own anachronistic
and uncomfortable
scent â€” the unlike-

ly mingling of
trendy, techno-fad and stripped-down,
acoustic aesthetic. But then MTV's wildly suc
cessful series of TV-concerts has always been a
little strange; overwhelming sets and back
drops run up against superstars reclaiming
their minimalist roots.
MTV likes to say the show recaptures such

fugitive qualities as talent and intimacy. I say
its about overcompensation, about atmos
phere and aura filling out anorexic arrange
ments. Blood-red velvet drapes, twisted can
delabra and bevies of dried flora go where she
strings and bongo drums can't. The fact that it
tends to work fairly well just proves that pack
aging has always been the music channels
strong suit.
And so I had extra-high expectations for
the CD-ROM. MTV, of all people, could pull
this paradox off, could whip the roots-ridden
medium of acoustic music into interactive,
cyber-hysteria. After all, the computer medi
um gives in easily to agrarian backgrounds,
rustic fonts, down-home icons and so on.
Computers must not necessarily bring us into
the 21st century; they can also harken back to
moments of acoustic innocence.
If it were purely up to MTV, we might have
something here. Milky, jumbled backgrounds

of sound-boards, guitars and your favorite
rockers circumscribe cannily enmeshed icons.
The thing looks pretty good. Twirl a combina
tion lock to scroll to a particular artist in"The
Vault," click on "All Access" dog-tags to get
"Backstage," and sweep your arrow across a
fuzzy television screen to see a snapshot from
the promised "Unreleased" footage. Harlequin
picture frames emerge from the jumble to en
close a video clip. Outdated '60s TV-sets hum
into life, broadcasting an interview blurb.
Recording and video equipment swirl under
an electric blue haze. The combination of Z-
Gallerie decadence, mod-Americana and
techno gloss makes for an invigorating mix.
It becomes rapidly apparent, however, that
the hyperactive form masks the barest of con
tents. While "The Vault" boasts pages for
every Unplugged to date, you're lucky if you
get more than a set list, a seamlessly looping
chorus and a band biography. Every page fea-

tures some incredibly banal words from pro
ducer Alex Colleti. This guy is the real star of
the show, with his face or voice popping up at
nearly every click to relate some pointless tid
bit about his stressful job or his joyous rapport
with a particular artist An example: "Hanging
out with Courtney Love was so great."
Highlights include the footage of Melissa
Etheridge, REM, Sheryl Crow and Bruce
Springsteen. The Nirvana clip, a piece of
"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?" produces
chills, and an acoustic "Zombie" by the Cran
berries comes across nicely.
Last thought despite some pleasant strurn
my moments, despite flashy artifice, despite
whatever pleasure a stroll through MTV self
promotion could produce, I just can't imagine
who would actually buy this thing. But I guess
that's not the point It's the marriage of skewed
minds, a paradox made good, a successfully or
chestrated Unplugged short circuit, MTV-style.
