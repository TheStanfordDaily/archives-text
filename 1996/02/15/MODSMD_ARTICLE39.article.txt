# MIX-IT-UP
## A 						PROFILE ON BRENDA WONG AOKI 
### ATHIMA CHANSANCHAI 
On the weekdays, I'm a model minority. But
on the weekends, I'm a West Side Warrior. —
Brenda Wong Aoki, "The Queen's Garden"
Mixing it up is what Brenda Wong Aoki is
all about. Her life is her art, her politics arc
somewhere in between and it all comes out in
a one-woman extravaganza of dance, theater
and occasional doo-wop singing. She turns
talking to yourself into a multidisciplinary
art form.
I first got to know her after she wowed an
Asian-American Studies class taught by Gor
don Chang on Jan. 31. Dressed in a smart
black suit, Aoki, who looks much younger
than her 42 years of age, went through an en
capsulated version of her topsy-turvy life in
less than 50 minutes.
Born in Salt Lake City, Aoki was raised
first on a naval base in L.A. and then on the
tougher turf of the West Side. We got to know
this neighborhood through her performance
piece, "The Queen's Garden," which played at
I >inkelspiel Auditorium on Feb. 3. It was part
of her Stanford Artist-in-Residence schedule,
which ran Jan. 28 to Feb. 12.
This play took us through a significant
segment of Aoki's life as a youth of mixed an
cestry: Japanese, Chinese, Mexican and Scot
tish. Her friends were Chicano and Polyne
sian, and her classmates ranged from heirs of
the white patriarchy to Black Panthers. She
was deep in the subculture of Southern Cali
fornia Asian-Pacific street gangs.
Before she reached back into her Ameri
can experiences for inspiration, she told tra
ditional Japanese ghost stories. Then she
started telling stories rooted in this world, as
bad and as good as they could get. Finding a
safe space where there was none before is at
the heart of her story.
Her Nissei father and her second-genera
tion Chinese mother raised four other
daughters and one son. The neutral parties
between opposing cultures, Aoki and her sib
lings (as well as others of mixed back
grounds) are the synthesis of what she calls
"New People."
Aoki said one of the "most powerful things
that has come out of my time here at Stanford
is just how very, very emotional it is for so
many people who are of mixed ancestry."
She added that at "Every single one of my
lectures there's been someone who's almost
been in tears to say 'It's so hard being the only
one.'
"There's something about those of us who
are mixed, because we are what America is
becoming and it's so new. I think it's very
much at the pulse of what makes America."
Aoki thinks this is the reason that " Fhe
Queen's Garden" keeps getting booked, even
after being out for over three years.
"It's getting more and more relevant," she
said, "because more people are mixed, more
people are finding themselves in communities
that were fine but the infrastructure's disinte
grating and it's pitting brother against brother
and the American Dream is not panning out."

STORYTELLER AND TEACHER
The blast of Joe Lopez's saxophone and
Mark Izu's jazz bass started the showoffin an
appropriately dramatic fashion. T he stage
was bare except for them and a small table.
Aoki came onto the stage in combat boots,
black pants, suspenders and a blue tank-top.
For the next two hours, playing about 20 dif
ferent characters at a dizzying and physically
demanding pace, Aoki blended substance
and style in an in-your-face fashion inter
spersed with vulnerability and candidness.
She gave credit to Jael Weisman, the direc
tor.
"He'll say, 'Who's talking?' and I'll say,
'I'm talking' but he'll say, 'Yeah, but which

one of you?'
At this, Aoki broke out into laughter, an
infectious character trait that showed in the
lines around her eyes.
It was unsettling to find her real voice
amongst all the other voices she brought to
the stage. Her voice was surprisingly gentle
and soothing. It was a voice charged with
feeling and intonations of sadness mixed
with adolescent joy.
Her black hair swung back and forth as
she strutted around the stage, its own char
acter amidst the rest. At times it was still like
a little girl's, at other times hair-sprayed
into another dimension, defying gravity
and whipping around with vehemence and
defiance.

" The Queen's (larden," her fifth production,
was one story she chose to tell out of many.
"Art exists, in and of itself," Aoki said.
"The artist's job is to uncover it. So I think
I 'The Queen's Garden' always existed out
there. My job was to get rid of the stories that
weren't part of Queen's Garden."
So much of what Aoki performs is direct
ly tied to her experiences growing up that it's
hard to tell when the art ends and life begins
and vice-versa.
Over 20 years ago, Aoki was told she was
"too short, stocky and ethnic-looking to go
on stage" by a professor at UC-Santa Cruz.
Now, she teaches bi-weekly for nine weeks at
that same school.
Aoki found humor in the irony.
"I tell you that was such a trip, especially to
be in theater arts. For one thing it felt like a
'Nahnanna-nahnna!' "
As a teacher, Aoki emphasized the impor
tance of bringing personal experience into
performances and required her class to see
her show at Stanford.
"I feel like I can only teach them so much.
They have to see it. It's like baking a cake. I
can give you the ingredients, but unless you
really see the finished product and eat it, it
doesn't really make any sense."
~EVERyTHIN6'I A-OK WITH AOKI"
Aoki, who spent several years among a
thriving political and artistic scene at Second
Avenue in San Francisco, talked about the
current situation of Asian Americans.
"We as a people have been trained not to
rock the boat — the nail that sticks up gets
hammered down. The cultural baggage
makes it hard to say 'back off,'" she said.
Fear, Aoki said, has become a factor Asian
Americans cannot ignore. The proliferation of
anti-Asian American violence, from the brutal
beating death of Vincent Chin in the 1980s to
the more recent violence Aoki herself has en
countered (she has been pelted by beer bottles
during performances), made her say to the
Asian-American Studies class, "If you stand
up for yourself, you stand up for all of us."
Still, even though others may label her as
I an Asian-American artist, she prefers not to
I be considered as such.
"1 know this may be controversial, but
personally I don't want to be recognized as an
'Asian-American' artist. I want to be known
as Brenda Wong Aoki, artist."
She's wary of references to her material as
political agenda.
"I used to be much more political, 1
think, but then 1 was much more didactic
and less mature," she said. "I think now 1 try
to think of myself as a free thinker and 1 just
want to say things as honestly as I can from
my point of view because I feel I'm in a po
sition to speak for other people like myself
who might not ever be in a position to have
a voice."
The individual in her rebels against the
cultural icon label that has been slapped onto
her identity by outsiders. The artist in her
takes hold of her past, embraces it and brings
it to life in front of our eyes.

cestry: Japanese, Chinese, Mexican and Scot
tish. Her friends were Chicano and Polyne
sian, and her classmates ranged from heirs of
the white patriarchy to Black Panthers. She
was deep in the subculture of Southern Cali
fornia Asian-Pacific street gangs.
Before she reached back into her Ameri
can experiences for inspiration, she told tra
ditional Japanese ghost stories. Then she
started telling stories rooted in this world, as
bad and as good as they could get. Finding a
safe space where there was none before is at
the heart of her story.
Her Nissei father and her second-genera
tion Chinese mother raised four other
daughters and one son. The neutral parties
between opposing cultures, Aoki and her sib
lings (as well as others of mixed back
grounds) are the synthesis of what she calls
"New People."
Aoki said one of the "most powerful things
that has come out of my time here at Stanford
is just how very, very emotional it is for so
many people who are of mixed ancestry."
She added that at "Every single one of my
lectures there's been someone who's almost
been in tears to say 'It's so hard being the only
one.'
"There's something about those of us who
are mixed, because we are what America is
becoming and it's so new. I think it's very
much at the pulse of what makes America."
Aoki thinks this is the reason that " Fhe
Queen's Garden" keeps getting booked, even
after being out for over three years.
"It's getting more and more relevant," she
said, "because more people are mixed, more
people are finding themselves in communities
that were fine but the infrastructure's disinte
grating and it's pitting brother against brother
and the American Dream is not panning out."

STORYTELLER AND TEACHER
The blast of Joe Lopez's saxophone and
Mark Izu's jazz bass started the showoffin an
appropriately dramatic fashion. T he stage
was bare except for them and a small table.
Aoki came onto the stage in combat boots,
black pants, suspenders and a blue tank-top.
For the next two hours, playing about 20 dif
ferent characters at a dizzying and physically
demanding pace, Aoki blended substance
and style in an in-your-face fashion inter
spersed with vulnerability and candidness.
She gave credit to Jael Weisman, the direc
tor.
"He'll say, 'Who's talking?' and I'll say,
'I'm talking' but he'll say, 'Yeah, but which

one of you?'
At this, Aoki broke out into laughter, an
infectious character trait that showed in the
lines around her eyes.
It was unsettling to find her real voice
amongst all the other voices she brought to
the stage. Her voice was surprisingly gentle
and soothing. It was a voice charged with
feeling and intonations of sadness mixed
with adolescent joy.
Her black hair swung back and forth as
she strutted around the stage, its own char
acter amidst the rest. At times it was still like
a little girl's, at other times hair-sprayed
into another dimension, defying gravity
and whipping around with vehemence and
defiance.

" The Queen's (larden," her fifth production,
was one story she chose to tell out of many.
"Art exists, in and of itself," Aoki said.
"The artist's job is to uncover it. So I think
I 'The Queen's Garden' always existed out
there. My job was to get rid of the stories that
weren't part of Queen's Garden."
So much of what Aoki performs is direct
ly tied to her experiences growing up that it's
hard to tell when the art ends and life begins
and vice-versa.
Over 20 years ago, Aoki was told she was
"too short, stocky and ethnic-looking to go
on stage" by a professor at UC-Santa Cruz.
Now, she teaches bi-weekly for nine weeks at
that same school.
Aoki found humor in the irony.
"I tell you that was such a trip, especially to
be in theater arts. For one thing it felt like a
'Nahnanna-nahnna!' "
As a teacher, Aoki emphasized the impor
tance of bringing personal experience into
performances and required her class to see
her show at Stanford.
"I feel like I can only teach them so much.
They have to see it. It's like baking a cake. I
can give you the ingredients, but unless you
really see the finished product and eat it, it
doesn't really make any sense."
~EVERyTHIN6'I A-OK WITH AOKI"
Aoki, who spent several years among a
thriving political and artistic scene at Second
Avenue in San Francisco, talked about the
current situation of Asian Americans.
"We as a people have been trained not to
rock the boat — the nail that sticks up gets
hammered down. The cultural baggage
makes it hard to say 'back off,'" she said.
Fear, Aoki said, has become a factor Asian
Americans cannot ignore. The proliferation of
anti-Asian American violence, from the brutal
beating death of Vincent Chin in the 1980s to
the more recent violence Aoki herself has en
countered (she has been pelted by beer bottles
during performances), made her say to the
Asian-American Studies class, "If you stand
up for yourself, you stand up for all of us."
Still, even though others may label her as
I an Asian-American artist, she prefers not to
I be considered as such.
"1 know this may be controversial, but
personally I don't want to be recognized as an
'Asian-American' artist. I want to be known
as Brenda Wong Aoki, artist."
She's wary of references to her material as
political agenda.
"I used to be much more political, 1
think, but then 1 was much more didactic
and less mature," she said. "I think now 1 try
to think of myself as a free thinker and 1 just
want to say things as honestly as I can from
my point of view because I feel I'm in a po
sition to speak for other people like myself
who might not ever be in a position to have
a voice."
The individual in her rebels against the
cultural icon label that has been slapped onto
her identity by outsiders. The artist in her
takes hold of her past, embraces it and brings
it to life in front of our eyes.

On the weekdays, I'm a model minority. But
on the weekends, I'm a West Side Warrior. —
Brenda Wong Aoki, "The Queen's Garden"
Mixing it up is what Brenda Wong Aoki is
all about. Her life is her art, her politics arc
somewhere in between and it all comes out in
a one-woman extravaganza of dance, theater
and occasional doo-wop singing. She turns
talking to yourself into a multidisciplinary
art form.
I first got to know her after she wowed an
Asian-American Studies class taught by Gor
don Chang on Jan. 31. Dressed in a smart
black suit, Aoki, who looks much younger
than her 42 years of age, went through an en
capsulated version of her topsy-turvy life in
less than 50 minutes.
Born in Salt Lake City, Aoki was raised
first on a naval base in L.A. and then on the
tougher turf of the West Side. We got to know
this neighborhood through her performance
piece, "The Queen's Garden," which played at
I >inkelspiel Auditorium on Feb. 3. It was part
of her Stanford Artist-in-Residence schedule,
which ran Jan. 28 to Feb. 12.
This play took us through a significant
segment of Aoki's life as a youth of mixed an
cestry: Japanese, Chinese, Mexican and Scot
tish. Her friends were Chicano and Polyne
sian, and her classmates ranged from heirs of
