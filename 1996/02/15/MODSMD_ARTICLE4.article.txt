# Shooting suspect, also a victim, faces arrest
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Stanford Police will likely arrest a suspect
today in the Saturday shooting of two men at
Tresidder Union. The alleged gunman was
one of the victims.
"We are satisfied that we have the individ
ual," Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herring
ton said yesterday, adding that police have re
covered the gun used in the shooting.
Herrington said police believe that "as the
man was taking the gun out of his pocket, he
shot himself in his opposite hand, and the bul
let exited his btxly and entered another man's
le g"
"We had this guy as a victim, but then ze
roed in on him as tbe shooter â€” it is difficult
when you have a case like this involved," Her
ri ngton said. "We don't usually arrest on the
spot."
Police would not release the name of the
suspect.
Police said they believe the man shot him
self and another individual at a sorority fund
raiser attended by about 450 people Saturday
night. Both the victim and the alleged gun
man were treated for minor injuries at Stan
ford Hospital. Neither man attends Stanford.

He said that although the charges are still
under review by the Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney's Office, they will probably in
clude possession of a firearm on campus, neg
ligent discharge of a firearm, carrying a con
cealed weapon and filing a false police report.
"The DA has to decide on the charges,"
Herrington said. "You can make an arrest on
probable cause, but you need to determine
that you have enough evidence."
Herrington said the suspect "gave us thus
whole description, saying he was shot by
someone else. We don't really like that."
Although they have enough independent
evidence to arrest the man, Herrington said po
lice are still trying to locate witnesses. One wit
ness who identified herself as Lisa Mahmand
told The Daily the night of the shooting that
she saw a man take the gun out of his pocket,
handle it and then shoot himself in the hand.
"We have been chasing her, but are unable
to contact her," Herrington said.
Though Mahmand said she was a student
at Humboldt State University, officials at the
school said they have no record that she is reg
istered there.
Herrington said the next step after an ar
rest is a bail hearing, which usually happens
the day of the arrest or the day afterward.
