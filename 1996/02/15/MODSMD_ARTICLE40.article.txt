# RUMBLE IN THE WEST:
## JACKIE CHAN HITS AMERICA 
### Story by Malcolm Maclachlan Graphic by Melissa Hung 
Jackie Chan could kick your ass. But even if
you deserved it, he probably wouldn't. He's a
sweetheart.
In his latest film, "Rumble in the Bronx," Asia's
most famous movie star demonstrates his prowess
in fights involving pool tables, shopping carts, car
sunroofs, pinbalJ machines and a hovercraft. He
takes out four guys with a ski and, in the same
scene, throws an attacker into a refrigerator and,
while fighting other opponents, punches the an
tagonist every time he tries to get out. But unlike
just about every American action star since, well,
MacCiyver, he doesn't kill anyone.
( hail, the unrivaled king of Hong Kong's prolif
ic film industry, thrives on a unique combination
of kung fu and comedy. His moves resemble less
the brutality of Steven Segal than the breathtaking
athleticism of Barishnikov, or even the physical
comedy of C ,'harlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. His
characters have less in common with the blood
thirst of lean-Claude Van Damme than with the
everyman desperation Jimmy Stewart and Carv
Grant brought to Hitchcock or of Harrison Ford's
recent films.
Chan is one of those rare action stars who ap- '
pears bigger in real life than in his films. He is by no

means a giant; at 5-foot-9, his own Bay Area press
agent towers over him. At one point in the inter
view he complains that his 158 pounds is more
than he likes to carry around — the problem is his
broken ankle suffered during a stunt has kept him
from jogging for several months.
Yet in "Rumble in the Bronx," there is no effort
to make Chan look bigger than life. He is repeated
ly referred to as a "little guy." He is often filmed
from high angles, making him look shorter than he
is. I hey even cast two of the major female charac
ters with actresses who are nearly as tall as him, in
cluding fellow Hong Kong superstar Anita Mui.
Chans "little guy" faces overwhelming odds and
spends much of the film trying to run away from
confrontation.
Chan seems a reluctant hero whose world is
crashing in all around him. He doesn't inspire fear
in anyone — until he starts moving. When Chan
starts moving, its as if the rewind and slow-mo fea
tures on VCRs were invented for this one man.
JBt ta morning publicity session at San I rancis
jEmcos planet Hollywood, Chan looks like he
has come straight out of the early '80s. He
has a feathered mop haircut tinted slightly red. 1 ie
wears a pink corduroy suit and a white shirt with a
fancy collar.
Chan is soft-spoken, self-deprecating and, it
seems, effortlessly compelling. While meeting the
press, Chan grows more and more animated, fi
nally getting to his feet and pantomiming moves
as he fields questions in five different languages.
He rarely stops smiling and commands atten
tion without demanding it. It is an impressive ef
fect in a situation where everyone else seems to be
trying so hard. 1 was one ofthe first reporters in the
press room before the event and immediately got
chatted up by one of the newest actors on "Melrose
Place. I suppose it was because he thought 1 might
be important to his career, and as it turned out, 1
gave him the pen needed to give his phone num
ber to a member of (khan's entourage.
The PR manager for Planet Hollywood intro
duces Chan as the most famous person in the
world." She could be right. Chan has the biggest
audience of any film star in the world — and that's
not even counting much of his distribution in
mainland China, where his films are frequently pi
rated and wildly popular.
Until recently, Chan was confined to cult status
in America. He appeared in"The Cannonball
Run —as a Japanese character — and starred in
two ill-conceived American bombs back in the
early 1980s.
Over half of the nearly 200 people who show up
for C han's Planet Hollywood appearance are
Asian. Yet many of Chan's most intense fans seem

to be people like Brian, a 27-year-old white 41
from the Bay Area. Brian says he has been a ('L
fanatic since he started studying martial arts ai at.
11. He can rattle off a comprehensive list oft. nan
best films and most impressive stunts. As a tin
measure of the global reach of Chan's lame, bria
was able to order the English-dubbed laser disc c
"Rumble in the Bronx" on the Internet Iron
Switzerland before the film was even available to
press screenings in this country.
Chan seems blissfully unaware of the carniva
atmosphere that follows him. It is Planet llollv
wood that seeks to borrow his prestige; their staf
scrambles to place Planet Hollywood hats unl t
shirts in view every time someone turns a TV cam
era on him. Under a hail of camera flashes, ( hat

cast from the ankle he broke while making Rum
ble in the Bronx."
" I his is my last cast," he says, putting enough
irony into his accented English to make it ck
even he doesn't believe it.
He's handling it all rather well for an actor who
is so popular in Asia he s never had to do a puWu
ty tour.
Later that night, Chan sits in the balcony.it i
rocco, a posh restaurant on the edge ol San
Francisco's Japantown. The lights are low ih
clientele elegant. The set-up is intimate; four
porters and Chan are seated at a small table laid ou;
with carefully arranged plates of caliman an
shrimp. He is wearing the same pink suit and, at •
all these hours, he's still smiling, even as he d-.
scribes a childhood that many of his American fan
might think unbearable.
Chan was born in Hong Kong in 1954. His par
ents were extremely poor and, when he was still a
child, moved to Australia to work. Chan was left t<
study at Hong Kong's Chinese Opera Research
Academy. Ihe school is famous tor its rigorous
training in Beijing Opera — a similar school is the
setting for much of "Farewell My Concubine.' a
film which contains scenes of brutal beatings ot
students. Instruction lasted from half-past five in
the morning until midnight, almost every da\ Tu
ition was free, although any wages students made
performing were garnished by their masters. Stu
dents signed binding contracts at the beginning of
their instruction, a process Chan was forced to go
through alone.
I hey ask. 'How many years do you want to
stay?',' he says."I was six years old. I didn't know
what a year was. I said 'How many days is a year?
I hey said 'You can sign up for three years, five
years, seven years or 10 years.'
I he first few days I could do everything I want

ed. I could run and play and do acrobatics all
day. So I signed up for 10 years. The next day,
the teacher beats me up. 1 le kicks me when I 'm
on the floor.
"Everybody's parents would come to see
them except mine. I would just go to bed and
cry. 1 cried because I have no place to go. I had
no home to run away to. My parents were too
far awav. It was verv tough growing up by mv
self."
Over the next 10 years, Chan studied
singing, dancing, acrobatics and martial arts.
Formal schooling amounted to no more than
an hour a day.
He ended up specializing in martial arts al
most by accident. At first, he was one of the best
singers.
"Altera few years, my voiced changed. 1 hen
they don't know where to put me."
His introduction to serious martial arts
training was also harsh.
"The teacher tells me to jump up on a table.
The table is this high" — he indicates the
restaurant table in from of him, nearly three
feet high — "and I'm only this high" — he
raises his hand to indicate himself as an ado
lescent, five-feet tall or less. "Then they put
sandbags on my feet. 1 can't jump high
enough. I hit my legs on the table. It hurts. As
soon as the master comes at me with a stick, I
jump over two tables."
The dropout rate was high. Chan says many
students would never return from visits to par
ents. When his own parents came to visit him
after his second year, he asked them if he could
leave. His father told him he must honor his
promise, even though he had made it when he
was only six years old.
Chan says he is close to his parents, now 80
and 81 years old. He calls them every Sunday,
no matter where he is in the world. He also says
lie's glad he went to the school because the
skills and toughness he learned in the Academy
are what enabled him to become a star. Yet
Chan, the father of a 12-year-old son by a Tai
wanese actress, hastens to add, "I won't let my
child go to this kind of school."
Chan left the school at age 17, only to dis
cover that he had been training to enter a dying
field. To support himself, he signed on as a
stuntman in Hong Kong's film industry, which
was blossoming with the emergence of Bruce
Lee.
Chan appeared in several low-budget kung
fu films and was groomed as the next big star
after Lee's death. The problem was he was not
Lee; Lee, trained in the competitive and violent
world of professional martial arts, had a lar
more brutal style.
"When 1 was young, I had no choice," he
says."The director told me everything to do.
They would say 'See Bruce Lee. Learn.' People
wanted me to do everything the same. It
doesn't work. I decided 1 can do everything dif
ferent."
This difference involved going back to his
roots as an entertainer. He brought more com
edy into his films and took out much of the vi

olence — a transition that soon made him a su
perstar. He came up with what he calls the
"Jackie Chan formula: Lots of comedy, little vi
olence, no sex, no fake love scenes." This
change has become even more pronounced in
his recent films.
"In Asia, 'Jurassic Park' is the number one
movie of all time," he says."The rest of the list
is Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, num
ber two to number seven. Everywhere you go in
Asia, children on the corner do Jackie Chan.
Everyone learn from me, even the dialogue. I
realize I affect the children. I change to no more
violence. My character try not to fight. I put
more education in my movies. In "Drunken
Master I," its get drunk, fight, get drunk, tight.
In "1 )runken Master II," I say that's wrong.
"Now in Hong Kong, the government puts
Jackie Chan on the first page of schoolbooks.
Jackie Chan say 'Don't go to jail.' lackie Chan
say 'Stay away from drugs.' "
This aversion to graphic violence — and vi
olent heroes — is part of the reason ("han ap
proaches the American film community so
cautiously. He claims admiration for Quentin
Tarantino — an enthusiastic Jackie Chan fan
himself—yet later admits that he found "Pulp
Fiction" shocking. He acknowledges Taranti
no's many homages to I long Kong movies, yet
also acknowledges that it is the extreme vio
lence of Hong Kong movies that he spent so
long trying to escape. I le says he has been sent
many American scripts, but they are "all
wrong" and "full of guns."
Furthermore, his film-making style does
not mesh well with American studios, which
thrive on strict budgets and schedules, ('han
often acts as his own director and, like many
Hong Kong filmmakers, sometimes shoots
without a complete script, improvising come
dy and fight scenes as he goes. Unlike most
Hong Kong directors, however, he also takes
his time. One fight scene in "Rumble in the
Bronx" took 20 days to shoot.
Rather than try to lit into an American sys
tem, he plans to keep making movies for Gold
en Harvest, the Hong Kong studio he works
with, and then find companies like New Line
to distribute in the United States. For this to
succeed, he says, he must depend on a younger
audience looking for a new kind of action
hero.
"1 meet my American fans and I say'why do
they accept me now?'," he says."I tried this 15
years ago and it didn't work. And they tell me
'I was five years old then.'"
"Everybody is talking now, but I'm still not
that confident. The problem is how to get peo
ple into the theater. In Asia, I don't do inter
views. People just go to the movie. Here, New
Line had to spend so much money for promo
tion. If it's not a success [and ] they lose money,
they won't do the next one."
His advantage lies in the fact that he offers
something no other action hero does — reali
ty. He shoots his stunts from multiple angles
and shows them in continuous shots, just to
show he didn't fake them. This is his trade

mark, something he often refers to as "physical
special effects." lust to clear up any doubt, dur
ing the credits of each film he includes the
stunt outtakes, including the excruciating se
quence where he breaks his ankle in "Rumble
in the Bronx."
"Even coming to Hollywood I do it my own
way," he says. "They use a computer. I don't
know how to type. I feel more successful. I
never cheat the audience. They go to see me,
not the double. In "Goldeneye," from the first
shot it's a double. That's easy. Why not let the
stuntman be the actor?
"I won't let myselfbe lazy. The first time the
stuntman do it, you'll want to let him do it next
time."
The I long Kong film industry is very small,
with a core group of 20 or 30 stars who may
appear in a dozen of more pictures a year.
Chan's crew is even more exclusive — most
stunt men refuse to work with him, and in the
past bitter rivalries erupted among the few
who would. He now has a core group he keeps
together from film to film. He even brings
them on publicity tours; Ken Lo, who Chan
fans know as the villain from "Drunken Mas
ter II," is accompanying Chan around Ameri
ca as his bodyguard.
Chan's stunt philosophy is to "take care of
everybody except myself." Injuries are com
mon during filming, but the worst ones always
seem to happen to Chan himself. He has com
piled an Evel Knievel-like list of mishaps in
cluding three broken noses, more than a dozen
broken bones and a near electrocution which
burned all the skin off his hands. He almost
died in 1986 while doing a routine stunt for
"Armor of God," a film for which he had al
ready successfully jumped off a cliff onto the
top of a hot air balloon. While doing a jump in
a tree, he turned to make sure the camera got a
good shot of his face — and ended up falling
40 feet onto rocks. 1 le still has a tiny hole in his
skull from the experience.
"I see all the stuntmen and I wonder why
they are crying," he says. "Then 1 know I am
going to die. Now I'm not afraid to die any
more. Now I concentrate everything on the
stunt."
I)espite all his injuries, Chan sees it as his job
to entertain audiences with increasingly out
landish and difficult stunts. In "Rumble in the
Bronx," he jumps off an eight-story parking
garage, 26 feet across a street and lands on a
three-foot wide balcony 40 feet below —some-
thing he did in a single try.
At the age of 41, Chan realizes the accidents
have taken their toll and he can't continue to do
the same spectacular stunts forever. He says he

will consider doing
some dramatic and
non-action roles in
the future. How
ever, when he can -
no longer do it
himself, he will seek
new talent to carry
on the Jackie Chan
tradition. This, he
hopes, will expand
the international
scope of his star
dom.
"Everyone
knows the Hong
Kong film industry

is going to die soon, he says, referring to the
scheduled 1997 takeover of Hong Kong by
(Ihina. "Already some people are going to Aus
tralia, Canada, America. 1 have no idea what's
going to happen to everyone. I just know what
I'm doing.
"When you see my movies, there is no poli
tics. Always happy go lucky. I hate politics. I'm
staying in Hong Kong."
Indeed, for one of the biggest films of the
biggest star in one of the world's most intense
political hot spots, "Rumble in the Bronx" dis
plays on odd sort of naivete. It takes place in a
world outside of politics and outside of time.
In the first half of the film, Chan's character is
threatened by a multi-racial motorcycle gang
whose style is an implausible combination of
'70s disco and '90s industrial. After he defeats
them — without seriously injuring anyone —
he wins them over with a peacemaking speech
which lampoons his imperfect English.
"You can spend the rest of your life beating
and robbing people. Why lower yourself?
Don't you know you are the scum of the earth?"
Director Stanley Tong admits that the por
trayal of the gang is not entirely realistic. "We
didn't want to make all the bad guys be black
or all white or all Chinese. We didn't want to
say one kind of person is bad and one kind of
person is good. We decided to make it like a
fairy tale."
The interview ends and Chan descends
the curving staircase into Orrocco's dining
room. Suddenly women in evening gowns
and men in Italian suits jump up from their
meals and start snapping pictures. Chan
stops and motions his director, his manager,
his bodyguard and friends to come pose with
him. He smiles so broadly the camera flashes
reflect off his big white teeth. For this poor
boy from Hong Kong, a fairy tale seems only
appropriate.

shot it's a double. That's easy. Why not let the
stuntman be the actor?
"I won't let myselfbe lazy. The first time the
stuntman do it, you'll want to let him do it next
time."
The I long Kong film industry is very small,
with a core group of 20 or 30 stars who may
appear in a dozen of more pictures a year.
Chan's crew is even more exclusive — most
stunt men refuse to work with him, and in the
past bitter rivalries erupted among the few
who would. He now has a core group he keeps
together from film to film. He even brings
them on publicity tours; Ken Lo, who Chan
fans know as the villain from "Drunken Mas
ter II," is accompanying Chan around Ameri
ca as his bodyguard.
Chan's stunt philosophy is to "take care of
everybody except myself." Injuries are com
mon during filming, but the worst ones always
seem to happen to Chan himself. He has com
piled an Evel Knievel-like list of mishaps in
cluding three broken noses, more than a dozen
broken bones and a near electrocution which
burned all the skin off his hands. He almost
died in 1986 while doing a routine stunt for
"Armor of God," a film for which he had al
ready successfully jumped off a cliff onto the
top of a hot air balloon. While doing a jump in
a tree, he turned to make sure the camera got a
good shot of his face — and ended up falling
40 feet onto rocks. 1 le still has a tiny hole in his
skull from the experience.
"I see all the stuntmen and I wonder why
they are crying," he says. "Then 1 know I am
going to die. Now I'm not afraid to die any
more. Now I concentrate everything on the
stunt."
I)espite all his injuries, Chan sees it as his job
to entertain audiences with increasingly out
landish and difficult stunts. In "Rumble in the
Bronx," he jumps off an eight-story parking
garage, 26 feet across a street and lands on a
three-foot wide balcony 40 feet below —some-
thing he did in a single try.
At the age of 41, Chan realizes the accidents
have taken their toll and he can't continue to do
the same spectacular stunts forever. He says he

will consider doing
some dramatic and
non-action roles in
the future. How
ever, when he can -
no longer do it
himself, he will seek
new talent to carry
on the Jackie Chan
tradition. This, he
hopes, will expand
the international
scope of his star
dom.
"Everyone
knows the Hong
Kong film industry

is going to die soon, he says, referring to the
scheduled 1997 takeover of Hong Kong by
(Ihina. "Already some people are going to Aus
tralia, Canada, America. 1 have no idea what's
going to happen to everyone. I just know what
I'm doing.
"When you see my movies, there is no poli
tics. Always happy go lucky. I hate politics. I'm
staying in Hong Kong."
Indeed, for one of the biggest films of the
biggest star in one of the world's most intense
political hot spots, "Rumble in the Bronx" dis
plays on odd sort of naivete. It takes place in a
world outside of politics and outside of time.
In the first half of the film, Chan's character is
threatened by a multi-racial motorcycle gang
whose style is an implausible combination of
'70s disco and '90s industrial. After he defeats
them — without seriously injuring anyone —
he wins them over with a peacemaking speech
which lampoons his imperfect English.
"You can spend the rest of your life beating
and robbing people. Why lower yourself?
Don't you know you are the scum of the earth?"
Director Stanley Tong admits that the por
trayal of the gang is not entirely realistic. "We
didn't want to make all the bad guys be black
or all white or all Chinese. We didn't want to
say one kind of person is bad and one kind of
person is good. We decided to make it like a
fairy tale."
The interview ends and Chan descends
the curving staircase into Orrocco's dining
room. Suddenly women in evening gowns
and men in Italian suits jump up from their
meals and start snapping pictures. Chan
stops and motions his director, his manager,
his bodyguard and friends to come pose with
him. He smiles so broadly the camera flashes
reflect off his big white teeth. For this poor
boy from Hong Kong, a fairy tale seems only
appropriate.


Jackie Chan could kick your ass. But even if
you deserved it, he probably wouldn't. He's a
sweetheart.
In his latest film, "Rumble in the Bronx," Asia's
most famous movie star demonstrates his prowess
in fights involving pool tables, shopping carts, car
sunroofs, pinbalJ machines and a hovercraft. He
takes out four guys with a ski and, in the same
scene, throws an attacker into a refrigerator and,
while fighting other opponents, punches the an
tagonist every time he tries to get out. But unlike
just about every American action star since, well,
MacCiyver, he doesn't kill anyone.
( hail, the unrivaled king of Hong Kong's prolif
ic film industry, thrives on a unique combination
of kung fu and comedy. His moves resemble less
the brutality of Steven Segal than the breathtaking
athleticism of Barishnikov, or even the physical
comedy of C ,'harlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. His
characters have less in common with the blood
thirst of lean-Claude Van Damme than with the
everyman desperation Jimmy Stewart and Carv
Grant brought to Hitchcock or of Harrison Ford's
recent films.
Chan is one of those rare action stars who ap- '
pears bigger in real life than in his films. He is by no

means a giant; at 5-foot-9, his own Bay Area press
agent towers over him. At one point in the inter
view he complains that his 158 pounds is more
than he likes to carry around — the problem is his
broken ankle suffered during a stunt has kept him
from jogging for several months.
Yet in "Rumble in the Bronx," there is no effort
to make Chan look bigger than life. He is repeated
ly referred to as a "little guy." He is often filmed
from high angles, making him look shorter than he
is. I hey even cast two of the major female charac
ters with actresses who are nearly as tall as him, in
cluding fellow Hong Kong superstar Anita Mui.
Chans "little guy" faces overwhelming odds and
spends much of the film trying to run away from
confrontation.
Chan seems a reluctant hero whose world is
crashing in all around him. He doesn't inspire fear
in anyone — until he starts moving. When Chan
starts moving, its as if the rewind and slow-mo fea
tures on VCRs were invented for this one man.
JBt ta morning publicity session at San I rancis
jEmcos planet Hollywood, Chan looks like he
has come straight out of the early '80s. He
has a feathered mop haircut tinted slightly red. 1 ie
wears a pink corduroy suit and a white shirt with a
fancy collar.
Chan is soft-spoken, self-deprecating and, it
seems, effortlessly compelling. While meeting the
press, Chan grows more and more animated, fi
nally getting to his feet and pantomiming moves
as he fields questions in five different languages.
He rarely stops smiling and commands atten
tion without demanding it. It is an impressive ef
fect in a situation where everyone else seems to be
trying so hard. 1 was one ofthe first reporters in the
press room before the event and immediately got
chatted up by one of the newest actors on "Melrose
Place. I suppose it was because he thought 1 might
be important to his career, and as it turned out, 1
gave him the pen needed to give his phone num
ber to a member of (khan's entourage.
The PR manager for Planet Hollywood intro
duces Chan as the most famous person in the
world." She could be right. Chan has the biggest
audience of any film star in the world — and that's
not even counting much of his distribution in
mainland China, where his films are frequently pi
rated and wildly popular.
Until recently, Chan was confined to cult status
in America. He appeared in"The Cannonball
Run —as a Japanese character — and starred in
two ill-conceived American bombs back in the
early 1980s.
Over half of the nearly 200 people who show up
for C han's Planet Hollywood appearance are
Asian. Yet many of Chan's most intense fans seem

to be people like Brian, a 27-year-old white 41
from the Bay Area. Brian says he has been a ('L
fanatic since he started studying martial arts ai at.
11. He can rattle off a comprehensive list oft. nan
best films and most impressive stunts. As a tin
measure of the global reach of Chan's lame, bria
was able to order the English-dubbed laser disc c
"Rumble in the Bronx" on the Internet Iron
Switzerland before the film was even available to
press screenings in this country.
Chan seems blissfully unaware of the carniva
atmosphere that follows him. It is Planet llollv
wood that seeks to borrow his prestige; their staf
scrambles to place Planet Hollywood hats unl t
shirts in view every time someone turns a TV cam
era on him. Under a hail of camera flashes, ( hat

cast from the ankle he broke while making Rum
ble in the Bronx."
" I his is my last cast," he says, putting enough
irony into his accented English to make it ck
even he doesn't believe it.
He's handling it all rather well for an actor who
is so popular in Asia he s never had to do a puWu
ty tour.
Later that night, Chan sits in the balcony.it i
rocco, a posh restaurant on the edge ol San
Francisco's Japantown. The lights are low ih
clientele elegant. The set-up is intimate; four
porters and Chan are seated at a small table laid ou;
with carefully arranged plates of caliman an
shrimp. He is wearing the same pink suit and, at •
all these hours, he's still smiling, even as he d-.
scribes a childhood that many of his American fan
might think unbearable.
Chan was born in Hong Kong in 1954. His par
ents were extremely poor and, when he was still a
child, moved to Australia to work. Chan was left t<
study at Hong Kong's Chinese Opera Research
Academy. Ihe school is famous tor its rigorous
training in Beijing Opera — a similar school is the
setting for much of "Farewell My Concubine.' a
film which contains scenes of brutal beatings ot
students. Instruction lasted from half-past five in
the morning until midnight, almost every da\ Tu
ition was free, although any wages students made
performing were garnished by their masters. Stu
dents signed binding contracts at the beginning of
their instruction, a process Chan was forced to go
through alone.
I hey ask. 'How many years do you want to
stay?',' he says."I was six years old. I didn't know
what a year was. I said 'How many days is a year?
I hey said 'You can sign up for three years, five
years, seven years or 10 years.'
I he first few days I could do everything I want

ed. I could run and play and do acrobatics all
day. So I signed up for 10 years. The next day,
the teacher beats me up. 1 le kicks me when I 'm
on the floor.
"Everybody's parents would come to see
them except mine. I would just go to bed and
cry. 1 cried because I have no place to go. I had
no home to run away to. My parents were too
far awav. It was verv tough growing up by mv
self."
Over the next 10 years, Chan studied
singing, dancing, acrobatics and martial arts.
Formal schooling amounted to no more than
an hour a day.
He ended up specializing in martial arts al
most by accident. At first, he was one of the best
singers.
"Altera few years, my voiced changed. 1 hen
they don't know where to put me."
His introduction to serious martial arts
training was also harsh.
"The teacher tells me to jump up on a table.
The table is this high" — he indicates the
restaurant table in from of him, nearly three
feet high — "and I'm only this high" — he
raises his hand to indicate himself as an ado
lescent, five-feet tall or less. "Then they put
sandbags on my feet. 1 can't jump high
enough. I hit my legs on the table. It hurts. As
soon as the master comes at me with a stick, I
jump over two tables."
The dropout rate was high. Chan says many
students would never return from visits to par
ents. When his own parents came to visit him
after his second year, he asked them if he could
leave. His father told him he must honor his
promise, even though he had made it when he
was only six years old.
Chan says he is close to his parents, now 80
and 81 years old. He calls them every Sunday,
no matter where he is in the world. He also says
lie's glad he went to the school because the
skills and toughness he learned in the Academy
are what enabled him to become a star. Yet
Chan, the father of a 12-year-old son by a Tai
wanese actress, hastens to add, "I won't let my
child go to this kind of school."
Chan left the school at age 17, only to dis
cover that he had been training to enter a dying
field. To support himself, he signed on as a
stuntman in Hong Kong's film industry, which
was blossoming with the emergence of Bruce
Lee.
Chan appeared in several low-budget kung
fu films and was groomed as the next big star
after Lee's death. The problem was he was not
Lee; Lee, trained in the competitive and violent
world of professional martial arts, had a lar
more brutal style.
"When 1 was young, I had no choice," he
says."The director told me everything to do.
They would say 'See Bruce Lee. Learn.' People
wanted me to do everything the same. It
doesn't work. I decided 1 can do everything dif
ferent."
This difference involved going back to his
roots as an entertainer. He brought more com
edy into his films and took out much of the vi

olence — a transition that soon made him a su
perstar. He came up with what he calls the
"Jackie Chan formula: Lots of comedy, little vi
olence, no sex, no fake love scenes." This
change has become even more pronounced in
his recent films.
"In Asia, 'Jurassic Park' is the number one
movie of all time," he says."The rest of the list
is Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, num
ber two to number seven. Everywhere you go in
Asia, children on the corner do Jackie Chan.
Everyone learn from me, even the dialogue. I
realize I affect the children. I change to no more
violence. My character try not to fight. I put
more education in my movies. In "Drunken
Master I," its get drunk, fight, get drunk, tight.
In "1 )runken Master II," I say that's wrong.
"Now in Hong Kong, the government puts
Jackie Chan on the first page of schoolbooks.
Jackie Chan say 'Don't go to jail.' lackie Chan
say 'Stay away from drugs.' "
This aversion to graphic violence — and vi
olent heroes — is part of the reason ("han ap
proaches the American film community so
cautiously. He claims admiration for Quentin
Tarantino — an enthusiastic Jackie Chan fan
himself—yet later admits that he found "Pulp
Fiction" shocking. He acknowledges Taranti
no's many homages to I long Kong movies, yet
also acknowledges that it is the extreme vio
lence of Hong Kong movies that he spent so
long trying to escape. I le says he has been sent
many American scripts, but they are "all
wrong" and "full of guns."
Furthermore, his film-making style does
not mesh well with American studios, which
thrive on strict budgets and schedules, ('han
often acts as his own director and, like many
Hong Kong filmmakers, sometimes shoots
without a complete script, improvising come
dy and fight scenes as he goes. Unlike most
Hong Kong directors, however, he also takes
his time. One fight scene in "Rumble in the
Bronx" took 20 days to shoot.
Rather than try to lit into an American sys
tem, he plans to keep making movies for Gold
en Harvest, the Hong Kong studio he works
with, and then find companies like New Line
to distribute in the United States. For this to
succeed, he says, he must depend on a younger
audience looking for a new kind of action
hero.
"1 meet my American fans and I say'why do
they accept me now?'," he says."I tried this 15
years ago and it didn't work. And they tell me
'I was five years old then.'"
"Everybody is talking now, but I'm still not
that confident. The problem is how to get peo
ple into the theater. In Asia, I don't do inter
views. People just go to the movie. Here, New
Line had to spend so much money for promo
tion. If it's not a success [and ] they lose money,
they won't do the next one."
His advantage lies in the fact that he offers
something no other action hero does — reali
ty. He shoots his stunts from multiple angles
and shows them in continuous shots, just to
show he didn't fake them. This is his trade

mark, something he often refers to as "physical
special effects." lust to clear up any doubt, dur
ing the credits of each film he includes the
stunt outtakes, including the excruciating se
quence where he breaks his ankle in "Rumble
in the Bronx."
"Even coming to Hollywood I do it my own
way," he says. "They use a computer. I don't
know how to type. I feel more successful. I
never cheat the audience. They go to see me,
not the double. In "Goldeneye," from the first
shot it's a double. That's easy. Why not let the
stuntman be the actor?
"I won't let myselfbe lazy. The first time the
stuntman do it, you'll want to let him do it next
time."
The I long Kong film industry is very small,
with a core group of 20 or 30 stars who may
appear in a dozen of more pictures a year.
Chan's crew is even more exclusive — most
stunt men refuse to work with him, and in the

Chan left the school at age 17, only to dis
cover that he had been training to enter a dying
field. To support himself, he signed on as a
stuntman in Hong Kong's film industry, which
was blossoming with the emergence of Bruce
Lee.
Chan appeared in several low-budget kung
fu films and was groomed as the next big star
after Lee's death. The problem was he was not
Lee; Lee, trained in the competitive and violent
world of professional martial arts, had a lar
more brutal style.
"When 1 was young, I had no choice," he
says."The director told me everything to do.
They would say 'See Bruce Lee. Learn.' People
wanted me to do everything the same. It
doesn't work. I decided 1 can do everything dif
ferent."
This difference involved going back to his
roots as an entertainer. He brought more com
edy into his films and took out much of the vi

olence — a transition that soon made him a su
perstar. He came up with what he calls the
"Jackie Chan formula: Lots of comedy, little vi
olence, no sex, no fake love scenes." This
change has become even more pronounced in
his recent films.
"In Asia, 'Jurassic Park' is the number one
movie of all time," he says."The rest of the list
is Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, num
ber two to number seven. Everywhere you go in
Asia, children on the corner do Jackie Chan.
Everyone learn from me, even the dialogue. I
realize I affect the children. I change to no more
violence. My character try not to fight. I put
more education in my movies. In "Drunken
Master I," its get drunk, fight, get drunk, tight.
In "1 )runken Master II," I say that's wrong.
"Now in Hong Kong, the government puts
Jackie Chan on the first page of schoolbooks.
Jackie Chan say 'Don't go to jail.' lackie Chan
say 'Stay away from drugs.' "
This aversion to graphic violence — and vi
olent heroes — is part of the reason ("han ap
proaches the American film community so
cautiously. He claims admiration for Quentin
Tarantino — an enthusiastic Jackie Chan fan
himself—yet later admits that he found "Pulp
Fiction" shocking. He acknowledges Taranti
no's many homages to I long Kong movies, yet
also acknowledges that it is the extreme vio
lence of Hong Kong movies that he spent so
long trying to escape. I le says he has been sent
many American scripts, but they are "all
wrong" and "full of guns."
Furthermore, his film-making style does
not mesh well with American studios, which
thrive on strict budgets and schedules, ('han
often acts as his own director and, like many
Hong Kong filmmakers, sometimes shoots
without a complete script, improvising come
dy and fight scenes as he goes. Unlike most
Hong Kong directors, however, he also takes
his time. One fight scene in "Rumble in the
Bronx" took 20 days to shoot.
Rather than try to lit into an American sys
tem, he plans to keep making movies for Gold
en Harvest, the Hong Kong studio he works
with, and then find companies like New Line
to distribute in the United States. For this to
succeed, he says, he must depend on a younger
audience looking for a new kind of action
hero.
"1 meet my American fans and I say'why do
they accept me now?'," he says."I tried this 15
years ago and it didn't work. And they tell me
'I was five years old then.'"
"Everybody is talking now, but I'm still not
that confident. The problem is how to get peo
ple into the theater. In Asia, I don't do inter
views. People just go to the movie. Here, New
Line had to spend so much money for promo
tion. If it's not a success [and ] they lose money,
they won't do the next one."
His advantage lies in the fact that he offers
something no other action hero does — reali
ty. He shoots his stunts from multiple angles
and shows them in continuous shots, just to
show he didn't fake them. This is his trade

mark, something he often refers to as "physical
special effects." lust to clear up any doubt, dur
ing the credits of each film he includes the
stunt outtakes, including the excruciating se
quence where he breaks his ankle in "Rumble
in the Bronx."
"Even coming to Hollywood I do it my own
way," he says. "They use a computer. I don't
know how to type. I feel more successful. I
never cheat the audience. They go to see me,
not the double. In "Goldeneye," from the first
shot it's a double. That's easy. Why not let the
stuntman be the actor?
"I won't let myselfbe lazy. The first time the
stuntman do it, you'll want to let him do it next
time."
The I long Kong film industry is very small,
with a core group of 20 or 30 stars who may
appear in a dozen of more pictures a year.
Chan's crew is even more exclusive — most
stunt men refuse to work with him, and in the
past bitter rivalries erupted among the few
who would. He now has a core group he keeps
together from film to film. He even brings
them on publicity tours; Ken Lo, who Chan
fans know as the villain from "Drunken Mas
ter II," is accompanying Chan around Ameri
ca as his bodyguard.
Chan's stunt philosophy is to "take care of
everybody except myself." Injuries are com
mon during filming, but the worst ones always
seem to happen to Chan himself. He has com
piled an Evel Knievel-like list of mishaps in
cluding three broken noses, more than a dozen
broken bones and a near electrocution which
burned all the skin off his hands. He almost
died in 1986 while doing a routine stunt for
"Armor of God," a film for which he had al
ready successfully jumped off a cliff onto the
top of a hot air balloon. While doing a jump in
a tree, he turned to make sure the camera got a
good shot of his face — and ended up falling
40 feet onto rocks. 1 le still has a tiny hole in his
skull from the experience.
"I see all the stuntmen and I wonder why
they are crying," he says. "Then 1 know I am
going to die. Now I'm not afraid to die any
more. Now I concentrate everything on the
stunt."
I)espite all his injuries, Chan sees it as his job
to entertain audiences with increasingly out
landish and difficult stunts. In "Rumble in the
Bronx," he jumps off an eight-story parking
garage, 26 feet across a street and lands on a
three-foot wide balcony 40 feet below —some-
thing he did in a single try.
At the age of 41, Chan realizes the accidents
have taken their toll and he can't continue to do
the same spectacular stunts forever. He says he

will consider doing
some dramatic and
non-action roles in
the future. How
ever, when he can -
no longer do it
himself, he will seek
new talent to carry
on the Jackie Chan
tradition. This, he
hopes, will expand
the international
scope of his star
dom.
"Everyone
knows the Hong
Kong film industry

is going to die soon, he says, referring to the
scheduled 1997 takeover of Hong Kong by
(Ihina. "Already some people are going to Aus
tralia, Canada, America. 1 have no idea what's
going to happen to everyone. I just know what
I'm doing.
"When you see my movies, there is no poli
tics. Always happy go lucky. I hate politics. I'm
staying in Hong Kong."
Indeed, for one of the biggest films of the
biggest star in one of the world's most intense
political hot spots, "Rumble in the Bronx" dis
plays on odd sort of naivete. It takes place in a
world outside of politics and outside of time.
In the first half of the film, Chan's character is
threatened by a multi-racial motorcycle gang
whose style is an implausible combination of
'70s disco and '90s industrial. After he defeats
them — without seriously injuring anyone —
he wins them over with a peacemaking speech
which lampoons his imperfect English.
"You can spend the rest of your life beating
and robbing people. Why lower yourself?
Don't you know you are the scum of the earth?"
Director Stanley Tong admits that the por
trayal of the gang is not entirely realistic. "We
didn't want to make all the bad guys be black
or all white or all Chinese. We didn't want to
say one kind of person is bad and one kind of
person is good. We decided to make it like a
fairy tale."
The interview ends and Chan descends
the curving staircase into Orrocco's dining
room. Suddenly women in evening gowns
and men in Italian suits jump up from their
meals and start snapping pictures. Chan
stops and motions his director, his manager,
his bodyguard and friends to come pose with
him. He smiles so broadly the camera flashes
reflect off his big white teeth. For this poor
boy from Hong Kong, a fairy tale seems only
appropriate.


Jackie Chan could kick your ass. But even if
you deserved it, he probably wouldn't. He's a
sweetheart.
In his latest film, "Rumble in the Bronx," Asia's
most famous movie star demonstrates his prowess
in fights involving pool tables, shopping carts, car
sunroofs, pinbalJ machines and a hovercraft. He
takes out four guys with a ski and, in the same
scene, throws an attacker into a refrigerator and,
while fighting other opponents, punches the an
tagonist every time he tries to get out. But unlike
just about every American action star since, well,
MacCiyver, he doesn't kill anyone.
( hail, the unrivaled king of Hong Kong's prolif
ic film industry, thrives on a unique combination
of kung fu and comedy. His moves resemble less
the brutality of Steven Segal than the breathtaking
athleticism of Barishnikov, or even the physical
comedy of C ,'harlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. His
characters have less in common with the blood
thirst of lean-Claude Van Damme than with the
everyman desperation Jimmy Stewart and Carv
Grant brought to Hitchcock or of Harrison Ford's
recent films.
Chan is one of those rare action stars who ap- '
pears bigger in real life than in his films. He is by no

means a giant; at 5-foot-9, his own Bay Area press
agent towers over him. At one point in the inter
view he complains that his 158 pounds is more
than he likes to carry around — the problem is his
broken ankle suffered during a stunt has kept him
from jogging for several months.
Yet in "Rumble in the Bronx," there is no effort
to make Chan look bigger than life. He is repeated
ly referred to as a "little guy." He is often filmed
from high angles, making him look shorter than he
is. I hey even cast two of the major female charac
ters with actresses who are nearly as tall as him, in
cluding fellow Hong Kong superstar Anita Mui.
Chans "little guy" faces overwhelming odds and
spends much of the film trying to run away from
confrontation.
Chan seems a reluctant hero whose world is
crashing in all around him. He doesn't inspire fear
in anyone — until he starts moving. When Chan
starts moving, its as if the rewind and slow-mo fea
tures on VCRs were invented for this one man.
JBt ta morning publicity session at San I rancis
jEmcos planet Hollywood, Chan looks like he
has come straight out of the early '80s. He
has a feathered mop haircut tinted slightly red. 1 ie
wears a pink corduroy suit and a white shirt with a
fancy collar.
Chan is soft-spoken, self-deprecating and, it
seems, effortlessly compelling. While meeting the
press, Chan grows more and more animated, fi
nally getting to his feet and pantomiming moves
as he fields questions in five different languages.
He rarely stops smiling and commands atten
tion without demanding it. It is an impressive ef
fect in a situation where everyone else seems to be
trying so hard. 1 was one ofthe first reporters in the
press room before the event and immediately got
chatted up by one of the newest actors on "Melrose
Place. I suppose it was because he thought 1 might
be important to his career, and as it turned out, 1
gave him the pen needed to give his phone num
ber to a member of (khan's entourage.
The PR manager for Planet Hollywood intro
duces Chan as the most famous person in the
world." She could be right. Chan has the biggest
audience of any film star in the world — and that's
not even counting much of his distribution in
mainland China, where his films are frequently pi
rated and wildly popular.
Until recently, Chan was confined to cult status
in America. He appeared in"The Cannonball
Run —as a Japanese character — and starred in
two ill-conceived American bombs back in the
early 1980s.
Over half of the nearly 200 people who show up
for C han's Planet Hollywood appearance are
Asian. Yet many of Chan's most intense fans seem

to be people like Brian, a 27-year-old white 41
from the Bay Area. Brian says he has been a ('L
fanatic since he started studying martial arts ai at.
11. He can rattle off a comprehensive list oft. nan
best films and most impressive stunts. As a tin
measure of the global reach of Chan's lame, bria
was able to order the English-dubbed laser disc c
"Rumble in the Bronx" on the Internet Iron
Switzerland before the film was even available to
press screenings in this country.
Chan seems blissfully unaware of the carniva
atmosphere that follows him. It is Planet llollv
wood that seeks to borrow his prestige; their staf
scrambles to place Planet Hollywood hats unl t
shirts in view every time someone turns a TV cam
era on him. Under a hail of camera flashes, ( hat

posters and presents Planet Hollywood with tlx.
cast from the ankle he broke while making Rum
ble in the Bronx."
" I his is my last cast," he says, putting enough
irony into his accented English to make it ck
even he doesn't believe it.
He's handling it all rather well for an actor who
is so popular in Asia he s never had to do a puWu
ty tour.
Later that night, Chan sits in the balcony.it i
rocco, a posh restaurant on the edge ol San
Francisco's Japantown. The lights are low ih
clientele elegant. The set-up is intimate; four
porters and Chan are seated at a small table laid ou;
with carefully arranged plates of caliman an
shrimp. He is wearing the same pink suit and, at •
all these hours, he's still smiling, even as he d-.
scribes a childhood that many of his American fan
might think unbearable.
Chan was born in Hong Kong in 1954. His par
ents were extremely poor and, when he was still a
child, moved to Australia to work. Chan was left t<
study at Hong Kong's Chinese Opera Research
Academy. Ihe school is famous tor its rigorous
training in Beijing Opera — a similar school is the
setting for much of "Farewell My Concubine.' a
film which contains scenes of brutal beatings ot
students. Instruction lasted from half-past five in
the morning until midnight, almost every da\ Tu
ition was free, although any wages students made
performing were garnished by their masters. Stu
dents signed binding contracts at the beginning of
their instruction, a process Chan was forced to go
through alone.
I hey ask. 'How many years do you want to
stay?',' he says."I was six years old. I didn't know
what a year was. I said 'How many days is a year?
I hey said 'You can sign up for three years, five
years, seven years or 10 years.'
I he first few days I could do everything I want

ed. I could run and play and do acrobatics all
day. So I signed up for 10 years. The next day,
the teacher beats me up. 1 le kicks me when I 'm
on the floor.
"Everybody's parents would come to see
them except mine. I would just go to bed and
cry. 1 cried because I have no place to go. I had
no home to run away to. My parents were too
far awav. It was verv tough growing up by mv
self."
Over the next 10 years, Chan studied
singing, dancing, acrobatics and martial arts.
Formal schooling amounted to no more than
an hour a day.
He ended up specializing in martial arts al
most by accident. At first, he was one of the best
singers.
"Altera few years, my voiced changed. 1 hen
they don't know where to put me."
His introduction to serious martial arts
training was also harsh.
"The teacher tells me to jump up on a table.
The table is this high" — he indicates the
restaurant table in from of him, nearly three
feet high — "and I'm only this high" — he
raises his hand to indicate himself as an ado
lescent, five-feet tall or less. "Then they put
sandbags on my feet. 1 can't jump high
enough. I hit my legs on the table. It hurts. As
soon as the master comes at me with a stick, I
jump over two tables."
The dropout rate was high. Chan says many
students would never return from visits to par
ents. When his own parents came to visit him
after his second year, he asked them if he could
leave. His father told him he must honor his
promise, even though he had made it when he
was only six years old.
Chan says he is close to his parents, now 80
and 81 years old. He calls them every Sunday,
no matter where he is in the world. He also says
lie's glad he went to the school because the
skills and toughness he learned in the Academy
are what enabled him to become a star. Yet
Chan, the father of a 12-year-old son by a Tai
wanese actress, hastens to add, "I won't let my
child go to this kind of school."
Chan left the school at age 17, only to dis
cover that he had been training to enter a dying
field. To support himself, he signed on as a
stuntman in Hong Kong's film industry, which
was blossoming with the emergence of Bruce
Lee.

This difference involved going back to his

cast from the ankle he broke while making Rum

" I his is my last cast," he says, putting enough
irony into his accented English to make it ck
even he doesn't believe it.
He's handling it all rather well for an actor who
is so popular in Asia he s never had to do a puWu
ty tour.
Later that night, Chan sits in the balcony.it i
rocco, a posh restaurant on the edge ol San
Francisco's Japantown. The lights are low ih
clientele elegant. The set-up is intimate; four
porters and Chan are seated at a small table laid ou;
with carefully arranged plates of caliman an
shrimp. He is wearing the same pink suit and, at •
all these hours, he's still smiling, even as he d-.
scribes a childhood that many of his American fan
might think unbearable.
Chan was born in Hong Kong in 1954. His par
ents were extremely poor and, when he was still a
child, moved to Australia to work. Chan was left t<
study at Hong Kong's Chinese Opera Research
Academy. Ihe school is famous tor its rigorous
training in Beijing Opera — a similar school is the
setting for much of "Farewell My Concubine.' a
film which contains scenes of brutal beatings ot
students. Instruction lasted from half-past five in
the morning until midnight, almost every da\ Tu
ition was free, although any wages students made
performing were garnished by their masters. Stu
dents signed binding contracts at the beginning of
their instruction, a process Chan was forced to go
through alone.
I hey ask. 'How many years do you want to
stay?',' he says."I was six years old. I didn't know
what a year was. I said 'How many days is a year?
I hey said 'You can sign up for three years, five
years, seven years or 10 years.'
I he first few days I could do everything I want

ed. I could run and play and do acrobatics all
day. So I signed up for 10 years. The next day,
the teacher beats me up. 1 le kicks me when I 'm
on the floor.
"Everybody's parents would come to see
them except mine. I would just go to bed and
cry. 1 cried because I have no place to go. I had
no home to run away to. My parents were too
far awav. It was verv tough growing up by mv
self."
Over the next 10 years, Chan studied
singing, dancing, acrobatics and martial arts.
Formal schooling amounted to no more than
an hour a day.
He ended up specializing in martial arts al
most by accident. At first, he was one of the best
singers.
"Altera few years, my voiced changed. 1 hen
they don't know where to put me."
His introduction to serious martial arts
training was also harsh.
"The teacher tells me to jump up on a table.
The table is this high" — he indicates the
restaurant table in from of him, nearly three
feet high — "and I'm only this high" — he
raises his hand to indicate himself as an ado
lescent, five-feet tall or less. "Then they put
sandbags on my feet. 1 can't jump high
enough. I hit my legs on the table. It hurts. As
soon as the master comes at me with a stick, I
jump over two tables."
The dropout rate was high. Chan says many
students would never return from visits to par
ents. When his own parents came to visit him
after his second year, he asked them if he could
leave. His father told him he must honor his
promise, even though he had made it when he
was only six years old.
Chan says he is close to his parents, now 80
and 81 years old. He calls them every Sunday,
no matter where he is in the world. He also says
lie's glad he went to the school because the
skills and toughness he learned in the Academy
are what enabled him to become a star. Yet
Chan, the father of a 12-year-old son by a Tai
wanese actress, hastens to add, "I won't let my
child go to this kind of school."
Chan left the school at age 17, only to dis
cover that he had been training to enter a dying
field. To support himself, he signed on as a
stuntman in Hong Kong's film industry, which
was blossoming with the emergence of Bruce
Lee.
Chan appeared in several low-budget kung
fu films and was groomed as the next big star
after Lee's death. The problem was he was not
Lee; Lee, trained in the competitive and violent
world of professional martial arts, had a lar
more brutal style.
"When 1 was young, I had no choice," he
says."The director told me everything to do.
They would say 'See Bruce Lee. Learn.' People
wanted me to do everything the same. It
doesn't work. I decided 1 can do everything dif
ferent."
This difference involved going back to his
roots as an entertainer. He brought more com
edy into his films and took out much of the vi

olence — a transition that soon made him a su
perstar. He came up with what he calls the
"Jackie Chan formula: Lots of comedy, little vi
olence, no sex, no fake love scenes." This
change has become even more pronounced in
his recent films.
"In Asia, 'Jurassic Park' is the number one
movie of all time," he says."The rest of the list
is Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, num
ber two to number seven. Everywhere you go in
Asia, children on the corner do Jackie Chan.
Everyone learn from me, even the dialogue. I
realize I affect the children. I change to no more
violence. My character try not to fight. I put
more education in my movies. In "Drunken
Master I," its get drunk, fight, get drunk, tight.
In "1 )runken Master II," I say that's wrong.
"Now in Hong Kong, the government puts
Jackie Chan on the first page of schoolbooks.
Jackie Chan say 'Don't go to jail.' lackie Chan
say 'Stay away from drugs.' "
This aversion to graphic violence — and vi
olent heroes — is part of the reason ("han ap
proaches the American film community so
cautiously. He claims admiration for Quentin
Tarantino — an enthusiastic Jackie Chan fan
himself—yet later admits that he found "Pulp
Fiction" shocking. He acknowledges Taranti
no's many homages to I long Kong movies, yet
also acknowledges that it is the extreme vio
lence of Hong Kong movies that he spent so
long trying to escape. I le says he has been sent
many American scripts, but they are "all
wrong" and "full of guns."
Furthermore, his film-making style does
not mesh well with American studios, which
thrive on strict budgets and schedules, ('han
often acts as his own director and, like many
Hong Kong filmmakers, sometimes shoots
without a complete script, improvising come
dy and fight scenes as he goes. Unlike most
Hong Kong directors, however, he also takes
his time. One fight scene in "Rumble in the
Bronx" took 20 days to shoot.
Rather than try to lit into an American sys
tem, he plans to keep making movies for Gold
en Harvest, the Hong Kong studio he works
with, and then find companies like New Line
to distribute in the United States. For this to
succeed, he says, he must depend on a younger
audience looking for a new kind of action
hero.
"1 meet my American fans and I say'why do
they accept me now?'," he says."I tried this 15
years ago and it didn't work. And they tell me
'I was five years old then.'"
"Everybody is talking now, but I'm still not
that confident. The problem is how to get peo
ple into the theater. In Asia, I don't do inter
views. People just go to the movie. Here, New
Line had to spend so much money for promo
tion. If it's not a success [and ] they lose money,
they won't do the next one."
His advantage lies in the fact that he offers
something no other action hero does — reali
ty. He shoots his stunts from multiple angles
and shows them in continuous shots, just to
show he didn't fake them. This is his trade

mark, something he often refers to as "physical
special effects." lust to clear up any doubt, dur
ing the credits of each film he includes the
stunt outtakes, including the excruciating se
quence where he breaks his ankle in "Rumble
in the Bronx."
"Even coming to Hollywood I do it my own
way," he says. "They use a computer. I don't
know how to type. I feel more successful. I
never cheat the audience. They go to see me,
not the double. In "Goldeneye," from the first
shot it's a double. That's easy. Why not let the
stuntman be the actor?
"I won't let myselfbe lazy. The first time the
stuntman do it, you'll want to let him do it next
time."
The I long Kong film industry is very small,
with a core group of 20 or 30 stars who may
appear in a dozen of more pictures a year.
Chan's crew is even more exclusive — most
stunt men refuse to work with him, and in the
past bitter rivalries erupted among the few
who would. He now has a core group he keeps
together from film to film. He even brings
them on publicity tours; Ken Lo, who Chan
fans know as the villain from "Drunken Mas
ter II," is accompanying Chan around Ameri
ca as his bodyguard.
Chan's stunt philosophy is to "take care of
everybody except myself." Injuries are com
mon during filming, but the worst ones always
seem to happen to Chan himself. He has com
piled an Evel Knievel-like list of mishaps in
cluding three broken noses, more than a dozen
broken bones and a near electrocution which
burned all the skin off his hands. He almost
died in 1986 while doing a routine stunt for
"Armor of God," a film for which he had al
ready successfully jumped off a cliff onto the
top of a hot air balloon. While doing a jump in
a tree, he turned to make sure the camera got a
good shot of his face — and ended up falling
40 feet onto rocks. 1 le still has a tiny hole in his
skull from the experience.
"I see all the stuntmen and I wonder why
they are crying," he says. "Then 1 know I am
going to die. Now I'm not afraid to die any
more. Now I concentrate everything on the
stunt."
I)espite all his injuries, Chan sees it as his job
to entertain audiences with increasingly out
landish and difficult stunts. In "Rumble in the
Bronx," he jumps off an eight-story parking
garage, 26 feet across a street and lands on a
three-foot wide balcony 40 feet below —some-
thing he did in a single try.
At the age of 41, Chan realizes the accidents
have taken their toll and he can't continue to do
the same spectacular stunts forever. He says he

will consider doing
some dramatic and
non-action roles in
the future. How
ever, when he can -
no longer do it
himself, he will seek
new talent to carry
on the Jackie Chan
tradition. This, he
hopes, will expand
the international
scope of his star
dom.
"Everyone
knows the Hong
Kong film industry

is going to die soon, he says, referring to the
scheduled 1997 takeover of Hong Kong by
(Ihina. "Already some people are going to Aus
tralia, Canada, America. 1 have no idea what's
going to happen to everyone. I just know what
I'm doing.
"When you see my movies, there is no poli
tics. Always happy go lucky. I hate politics. I'm
staying in Hong Kong."
Indeed, for one of the biggest films of the
biggest star in one of the world's most intense
political hot spots, "Rumble in the Bronx" dis
plays on odd sort of naivete. It takes place in a
world outside of politics and outside of time.
In the first half of the film, Chan's character is
threatened by a multi-racial motorcycle gang
whose style is an implausible combination of
'70s disco and '90s industrial. After he defeats
them — without seriously injuring anyone —
he wins them over with a peacemaking speech
which lampoons his imperfect English.
"You can spend the rest of your life beating
and robbing people. Why lower yourself?
Don't you know you are the scum of the earth?"
Director Stanley Tong admits that the por
trayal of the gang is not entirely realistic. "We
didn't want to make all the bad guys be black
or all white or all Chinese. We didn't want to
say one kind of person is bad and one kind of
person is good. We decided to make it like a
fairy tale."
The interview ends and Chan descends
the curving staircase into Orrocco's dining
room. Suddenly women in evening gowns
and men in Italian suits jump up from their
meals and start snapping pictures. Chan
stops and motions his director, his manager,
his bodyguard and friends to come pose with
him. He smiles so broadly the camera flashes
reflect off his big white teeth. For this poor
boy from Hong Kong, a fairy tale seems only
appropriate.
