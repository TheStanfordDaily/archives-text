## THE 						GRIFTERS Ain't My Lookout 
### 
Following a few releases convinced me
that the Grifters were one of the greatest
bands in the world, their merely good fifth
album comes as a fairly huge disappoint
ment. "Ain't My Lookout" — their first
album since switching from little Memphis
indie Shangri-La to big Seattle indie Sub Pop
— is their poppiest and cleanest work to
date, yet also their least interesting.
The problem here isn't that the group
"sold out" or anything like that; these songs
are still too weird to ever get much radio play.
The problem is that, for the first time in their
career, the Grifters are making songs that
don't sound natural.
Over the last few years, the Grifters have
deconstructed traditional musical styles like
blues and rockabilly, thrown in some noise
and experimentation, written consistently
smart and imaginative songs and generally
put out some of the most gripping music of
the '90s.
Now, too many of these songs seem like
beefed-up caricatures of their past work
decent, but a bit stale. Tracks like
"Boho/Alt" and "Parting Shot" start with
off-key singing and a slow, willful sloppiness
before exploding into almost Flaming Lips
like guitar blasts — for the first time ever, a
Grifters formula.
But while "Ain't My Lookout" is far from a
breakthrough, it survives as a pretty solid way
to tread water. Fven the worst songs are de
cent, and some songs are great. "Last Man
Alive" is an upbeat Pavement-y pop song and
possibly the catchiest thing the band has
done, while "Day Shift," "Mysterious
Friends" and "Return to Cinder" reliably de
liver the group's smart, lazy charm.
Altogether, "Ain't My Lookout" is no
match for past classics like "One Sock Miss
ing," "Crappin' You Negative" or "The Eure
ka E.P." But even in a creative rut (by their
standards at least), the Grifters just don't
seem capable of making a bad album.
