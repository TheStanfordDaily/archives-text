## I'm With Stupid 
### 
Aimee Mann's second solo album, "I'm
with Stupid," is a strong blend of brilliant in
strumentalsand (lowing, profound lyrics. It's
no wonder that the British music magazine
Mojo chose Mann — previously of' Til l ues
day — as having one of 1995's 25 best al
bums.
The English have definitely caught on to
Mann's beautiful melodies. Her music is a
cross between Sheryl Crow's intricate,
acoustic guitar work and Tori Amos' emo
tion-affecting words and messages.
Mann does an excellent job of examining
relationships in this album. Though she does
write about neurotic male-female interac
tions, Mann also expresses her feelings about
professional relationships. In "It's Not Safe,"
she sings about professional involvements
who don't understand or care about her
work. Mann warns: "Be ready to be ridiculed,
and misunderstood / 'Cause don't you know
that you're a fiickin' freak in this world?"
Mann conveys her deep understanding of
human nature's dark character when she
writes about shrewd manipulation in the
melancholy "Par For The Course" and the
resolute "Long Shot," where Mann's determi
nation to not be drawn into a bad scene is
deeply felt. But she reveals her conflicting
tendencies when she desperately implores,
"please love inc."
The guitar and drum work is also very
catchy. Mann's songs are like one of those
tunes you find yourself humming randomly
in the middle of the day. Such songs are espe
cially rare these days since it seems that one
alternative / pop band is the same as any
other. But Mann clearly distinguishes herself
with clever vocal and instrumental work that
is refreshing in its uniqueness.
Some may know Mann's work from "Mel
rose Place — The Music," where the song
" That's lust What You Are" spent six weeks in
early 1995 on Billboard's Hot 100 Singles
chart. Good news: this song is also on "I'm
With Stupid."

The bottom line is that Mann makes good
music. One thing is for sure: Aimee Mann
won't bore you with trite tunes and repetitive
lyrics.
