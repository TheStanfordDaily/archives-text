# MINISTRY
## Filth Pig 
### 
When I was 15, Ministry was the hardest
damn band in the universe. My younger
brother was entering his "troubled adoles
cent" phase, and Ministry classics like "The
Land of Rape and Honey" or "A Mind is a
Terrible Thing to Taste" provided the sound
track to his teenage rebellion. In addition to
scaring the hell out of my parents, Ministry's
machine-gun drum-machine riffs and
speed-metal guitar bursts were setting a new
standard for "industrial" music, paving the
way for later bands like Nine Inch Nails. As
far as I was concerned, Ministry was the best
that industrial had to offer, far outpacing
Trent Reznor's sissy complaint-rock.
Well, now it's 19%, Trent Reznor is an al
ternative superstar and except for a slot on
the 1993 Lollapalooza tour, an arrest for
heroin possession and an aborted country
music side project, Ministry frontman Al
Jourgensen has been out of the public eye

since 1992's "Psalm 69." After so long of a
wait, maybe my expectations for a new Min
istry album were too high, but "Filth Fig"
doesn't seem to quite live up to the high stan
dards set by its predecessors.
The four years since "Psalm" seem to have
mellowed Jourgensen somewhat: "Filth Pig"
is for the most part much slower than earlier
Ministry releases, and the pounding drum

Classic
Excellent
Almost, but...
