## MEL-LOW It's A B.G. Thang (Life Of A Youngster) 
### 
If you're planning on cruising El Camino
this weekend, you might want to stop and
pick up this album before you go. Mel-low's
mainstream debut is the kind of thing that
you'll want to blast in your car, with one hand
on the wheel and your head bobbing up and
down to the thumping bass.
Coming from South Central Los Angeles,
Mel-low focuses on the typical topics of
gangsta rap: violence, drugs and girls. His
smooth voice is at times reminiscent of Too
Short or Warren G, and the sound is fairly
typical of the gangsta rap scene. The backing
music is slow with a throbbing bass, and as
his name might hint, the songs are very mel
low.
The first track "B.C. Thang" quickly intro
duces us to Mel-low's style; his rhymes flow
smoothly over a pulsing bass in the back
ground. Doing what a good first track should
do, this song hooks you into listening to the

resi of the CD.
"Blaze It Up" proves that Mel-low can take
things to a different level. It is slightly funkier
than most of the other songs. Helping him to
"roll it up, blaze it up and pass it around" on
this song is Redman. Other guest appear
ances on the album include L.V. and Frode'je.
Mel-low's songs focus on "the elements of
gangsta lite, the kind ol knowledge you got to
acquire growing up in the CPT [Compton
area]." Over a disco-like bass-line, "My City"
gives us a glance at the rough life he has lead:
"Let me tell about this little city I'm
from / It's called Compton / Where every
body's packing a gun."
The Day I Die," Mel-low's personal fa
vorite on the album, brings forth the philoso
phy of a young person growing up in the inner
city: "Fuck the world is the attitude 1
took / Now I'm hooked on the life of a crook."
But while these songs may have serious un
dertones, that doesn't get in the way of enjoy
ing the funky bass and the quick rhymes.
If you're looking to increase your selection
of cruising music, then Mel-low is a wise
choice. It is similar to many of the other
gangsta rap albums currently available, so it
most likely will never stand out as a classic.
But, it's definitely an album that will make
you wish that you had hydraulics installed in
your car.
