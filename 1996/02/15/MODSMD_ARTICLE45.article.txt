# RUBY
## Salt peter 
### 
If Nine Inch Nails infused industrial pop
with personality, Scottish-born sound-alike
ruby seems determined to strip the genre of
its heart. Her debut album "Salt peter" is a
cold, cold listen. If Reznor's "Closer" com
bined synth-loop and carnal craving, ruby's
corresponding track, "Swallow Baby" is all
repetitive blips and blasts. A line like "the
more you suck, the more I have to swallow,
baby," cries out for irony, for the kind of self-

conscious dramat
ics Reznor is so
good at. Instead,
ruby swallows the
sentiment, becom
ing for a moment a
l'l Harvey afraid of
her own venom.
A similar
reluctance runs
throughout the
album, ruby con
verts the stinging
line from "Hoops,"
"You know I hate it
when you cry/It
makes me want to
burn your eyes
with a poker," into
a deflated symp
tom of someone's
unfortunate mal
adjustment. When
she whispers
"Leech in ma belly,
suck on me,
daddy-oh," there's
no empathy, no
rage-induced fel
low feeling. You

just wonder what her childhood was like.
The music helps somewhat. Co-writer
Mark Walk's production savvy has poured a
depthless melange of sounds on top of barely
discernible melodies. "Salt peter" is as tex
tured an album as any I've heard. "Flippin'
Tha Bird" pulls loops from every instrument
imaginable. It's a glorious clash of genres:
classical, house, industrial, and pop. "Salt
Water Fish" is likewise overwhelming. These
are well-crafted songs, broad, diverse, intri
cate, but overall antiseptic. They don't induce
any feeling; they're bitterness behind glass,
sugar-coated pills gone saccharine.
"Tiny Meat" rises above the mess with a
hyperactive, dance-driven beat. And "Paraf
fin" is the exception to the rule. The re
strained, brooding arrangement and haunt
ing lyrics — "Old man got me in the eye
again, stuck his bony finger in / Turned me
around and did it all again" — work. It fea
tures a commodity sorely missed on the rest
of the album: the satisfying combination of
virtuosity and authentic feeling.
