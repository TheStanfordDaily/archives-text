# THE 						WEDDING
## PRESENT Mini-Plus 
### 
"Mini-Plus" is the latest from Leeds-based
hand The Wedding Present, and it consists of
a six-song HP ("Mini") and three other songs
originally released on seven-inch singles. In
keeping with the cover art — close-up shots
of a Rolls Royce Silver Shadow and an Austin
Mini — the first six song titles share an auto
motive focus ("Go, Man, Go," "Drive,"
"Sports Car"). Lyrically, however, they all

stick to the tried-and-true Wedding Present
themes of romance and heartbreak.
On "Convertible," for instance, lead singer
David Gedge sings not about cars but about
conventional pop-song love (with an obliga
tory tinge of unhealthiness): "I guess I'm al
ways convertible / Just hit the switch and I'm
yours." The final three songs fit in well with
the "Mini" songs, and they include a cover
version of Butterglory's "Waiting on the
Guns." The Wedding Present always manage
to choose covers that fit seamlessly with their
own sound (which says a lot both for their
keen ear and for the versatility of their
music), taking songs from such unexpected
and disparate sources as Elton John, Pave
ment and The Monkees.
While "Mini-Plus" is a satisfying listen for
Wedding Present fans, it does not break any
new musical ground. The band has been
heading in a poppier direction ever since
"Hit Parade," and "Mini-Plus" sounds a lot
like their last album, the near-bubble gum
"Watusi," minus the influence of producer
Steve Fisk. This pop sound is an interesting
evolution from the earlier frenetic guitar
and-staccato, melody-free "singing" on
older albums like "Bizarro." (Back then who
would have ever expected to hear David
Gedge crooning, for goodness sake?) The
new sound has its merits for sure, with de
velopments like female backing vocals
(courtesy of Jane Lockcy) and some beauti
ful slower songs.
For anyone unacquainted with The Wed
ding Present, however, their earlier albums
should take listening precedence. "Mini-
Plus" is by no means a bad album, but under
stand that after hearing a masterpiece like
"Seamonsters" it is hard not to be a little dis
appointed with anything new, no matter how
good it sounds.
