## A 						Midwinter's Tale 
### 
"Hamlet is me," proclaims a chisel-fea
tured, aspiring actor in the beginning of "A
Midwinter's Tale." "Hamlet is Bosnia. Hamlet
is the desk. Hamlet is the air. Hamlet is my
grandmother." What better than to make a
comedy out of Shakespeare's greatest tragedy?
And who better to make it than Kenneth
Branagh — although he's probably better
known lor his straight versions of Shakespeare
than his spoofs.
The originality of this play-within-a-film
comes more from budget constraints than in
spiration: the production is held in an old
church, the special effects are provided by a mal
functioning smoke machine and six actors play
24 parts, which results in one actor playing both
Rosencrantz and (iuildenstern. The director
and Danish prince himself is an angst-ridden
actor named Joe Harper (Michael Maloney)
who's trying to redeem himself by staging
"Hamlet" in the bleakest month of the year.
He's also enlisted an insufferably politically
correct Laertes, a severely myopic (Ophelia (Julia
Sawalha) and a campy drag queen who "brings
[his] own tits" as (iertrude. but these eccentric
thespians, for all their flaws, are still sane. At the
other end of the spectrum is Joe's set designer,
I'adge, who resembles an extraterrestrial and
sees "Hamlet" as being about "people in
space." The only stable character in the film is
Joe's agent, played by loan Collins, representing
1 iollywood big-business.
Shot in luminous black-and-white, there's
an old-fashioned sentimentality to this pic
ture, especially when the actors inevitably

bond. What started as Joe's personal campaign
becomes a kind of three-week self-help pro
gram for the entire cast. He also gets the
chance to encourage the cultural identity of
his symbolically-named hometown, Hope.
Appropriately, the villain of this piece is Holly
wood, which comes knocking at Joe's door on
opening night with the offer of a fat contract if
he leaves his production. Further complicat

ing matters is Joe's attraction for his ditzy
Ophelia; she refuses to have anything to do
with him if the show won't go on.
Branagh doesn't entirely overcome the
slings and arrows of excessive pathos. There
are several overwrought scenes of emotional
catharsis — as there were in his 1992 ensemble
offering, "Peter's Friends" (actually, consider
ing the number of actors in this film who were

Branagh's RADA classmates, you could call
this "Kenneth's Friends") The strongest ele
ment of this lightweight comedy is simply its
affectionate tribute to the neuroses of actors.
You're better off considering "A Midwinter's
Tale" as a dress rehearsal for Branagh's serious
film version of' Hamlet" due to come out later
this year.
