Travolta is back. Again.
Call it a mini-comeback. After a forgettable
performance in the forgettable "White Man's
Burden" that slightly marred his return to su
perstardom, John Travolta has notched an
other brilliant turn as Vic Deakins, a Stealth
bomber pilot who smiles, shoots and sins his

way to stealing two nuclear missiles.
"Broken Arrow," from 1 long Kong action di
rector John Woo ("The Killer"), marks the first
time Travolta plays a truly villainous character.
Opposite him is Christian Slater, who plays the
younger Riley Hale, his co-pilot who is always a
step behind him. On a classified mission testing
the radioactive emissions of two nuclear war
heads, Deakins turns 011 his buddy and steals the
weapons — "broken arrows," military parlance
for lost nuclear weapons — by ejecting them

into the Utah desert where they will
be recovered hy his henchmen. A
cat-and-mouse chase follows, with
the nuclear weapons changing
hands more than once. The film cli
maxes atop a moving train, with a
major American city—not lo men
tion a $20 wager between Deakins
and Hale — at stake.
The movie's star is clearly the
action. The sequence with the B-3
— created hy the filmmakers as an
imagined upgrade on the current
B-2 stealth bomber — rekindles
childhood fantasies of flying mili
tary jets and makes the F-14 of "Top
Gun" fame look like Lego planes.
The explosion of one of the nuclear
missiles — "Hot damn, what a
rush!" Deakins exclaims — is also
one of the highlights, rendering the
earth to a water-like consistency,
rumbling about wreaking havoc.
Not to be overlooked, of course, are
the trademark Woo gunfights and
hand-to-hand combat, although he
loads it on a little thick with the in-

dulgcnt helicopter scenes.
Travolta is deliciously one-dimensional in
his first action film. His mastery of the little
nuances of the character — his walk, his
quirky drag of a cigarette — coupled with the
twang of 1 )uane Eddy's baritone guitar and an
abundance of tongue-in-cheek wit make
Deakins one of the great, slightly insane action
villains of recent memory (putting both of
Dennis Hopper's overplayed performances in
"Speed" and "Waterworld" to shame).

Slater is adequate, though one sometimes
forgets he is even there. Weaker still is the char
acter of Terry Carmichael, a park ranger —
though the script is to blame much more than
is actress Samantha Mathis — as useless and
illogical as Sandra Bullock's spunky bus driver
in "Speed" (also written by Graham Yost). A
stronger element, however, is the competitive
tension between Deakins and Hale — at
times, the matter seems less the end of the
world than who will get the final laugh, anoth
er John Woo staple.
As an action film, there's not much out
there better than "Broken Arrow." John Woo
fans, indulge.
