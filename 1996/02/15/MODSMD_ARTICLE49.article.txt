## Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead 
### 
Yes, "Things to do in Denver When You're
Dead" seems to have a lot going for it. It's got
a hip wordy title (£ la "The Englishman Who
Went Up a Hill blah blah blah," "Don't lie a
Menace to South Central blah blah blah," etc.);
an ample suave-factor (Andy — swoon —
Garcia); cutesy nicknames (Critical Bill, Fran
chise, Mr. Shhh); and comic bookie gang
sterisms ("give it a name," "doin' an action").
Sounds like a movie tailor-made for Our Gen
eration.
And that's just the problem.
It seems as if Gary Felder (in his feature di
rectorial debut) and writer Scott ("Beautiful
Girls") Rosenburg wanted to expound upon
the cooler-than-cool botched-crime thriller
by adding some humanity. What we get in
stead is one darned confused film.
Is it Action? Is it Drama? Is it genre film?
Are we supposed to take any of it seriously?
Jimmy the Saint (Garcia) is an ex-gangster

who's gone legit running Afterlife Advice En
terprises, a video tape service for dying people
(see: "My Life" with Michael Keaton). His
business is flailing so he reluctantly slips into
the old ways by accepting a bid from his bad
ass quadriplegic former boss, The Man With
The Plan (Christopher Walken).
Jimmy wanders around the seedy gangland
capital of, uh, Denver, gathering his old bud
dies for the "action" — the clownishly-chris
tened Franchise (William Forsythe), Easy
Wind (Bill Nunn), Critical Bill (Treat
Williams) and Pieces (Christopher Lloyd) —
all of whom are trying to stay straight. Of
course the whole shebang goes awry and The
Man gets pissed and orders hits on all of'em
except Jimmy, who gets 48 hours (an extra
long, movie-time 48 hours) to leave the city.
'ITie rest of the movie is spent with Jimmy
getting his pals out of town so they aren't
"buckwheat" — killed in the most painful
manner (i.e., a bullet up the tuchus) — and
trying to get all mushy with Dagney (Gabrielle
Anwar), the ski instructor babe that we are
made to try and believe he falls in love with.
Things start to go really sour when the com
rades (who we feel deeply for, of course) each

get nabbed by Steve ("Reservoir Dogs") Busce
mi, as the bug-eyed assassin Mr. Shhh, and
Jimmy gets booted around by The Man's meat
head lunkies. Jimmy, realizing it's all over, tries
to make things right with Dagney, exacts his
revenge on The Man, impregnates a teenie
bopper hooker, video tapes himself (didn't see
that coming, did ya?) and then, well, gets shot
by some hit men from Albuquerque.
The whole story is loosely held together by
cxcerpts from Jimmy's dying customers and
narration by Joe Heff (Jack Warden), a saga
cious milkshake-sipping crony who explains
things from a seat in the local malt shop hang
out.
Okay, okay, there arc a few bright spots in
this film. Christopher Lloyd isn't bad as Pieces,
the porno-house film projectionist who's the
senior member of Jimmy's chums, and Treat
Williams does a nifty job playing Critical Bill,
a militia-esque psycho who screws up the "ac
tion" in the first place. Wc arc introduced to
Bill as he's punching a body in the funeral
home where he works and there's a funny bit
with corpse disposal. Walkcn, though overly
typecast these days, still does the bit well, and
Josh Charles (Knox Overstreet in "Dead Poets

Society") is good as a smart-mouthed murder
victim.
But even these tidbits are overwhelmed by
much schlock Anwar is cute (in a statutory
kind of way) as long as she doesn't open her
mouth, and though there are a few fun eu
phemisms for anal sex and a couple other clever
quips ("mammy rammer" is my favorite) that
usually come out forced and intrusive. And all
that pressing together of palms...
Many times it feels like no one really knew
where scenes were supposed to go. When
Jimmy's getting kicked around at the feet of
The Man, the brutal moment is turned comi
cal by everyone yelling "Beg! Beg!" and
Jimmy's genuine good-heartcdness is shat
tered by his pick-up lines and pre-mcditated
murder. Mr. Shhh is unconvincing as an ex
pert killer hidden in an Arvid Ingid-looking
body and the cheesy video tape-as-narrative
device just flops. Any deep meaningfulness
gets swallowed by that (tired) snazzy '90s noir,
and the snazzy '90s noir, um, gags.
At best "Things to Do in Denver When
You're Dead" is a transition film, a first movie.
More likely though, it's just a mouthful.
