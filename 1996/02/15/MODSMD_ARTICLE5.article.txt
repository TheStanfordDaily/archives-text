# Greek task force receives charge
## 'Just about all aspects' of life to be examined, Edmonds says 
### Scott Van Winkle Editorial staff 
Following up on a decision announced last fall,
Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds said yesterday that a task force examining all
aspects of Greek life on campus will conduct a com
prehensive review of the status and future of frater
nities and sororities at Stanford.
The goals of the task force, listed in a document
prepared by Edmonds' office last week, are to exam
ine the role that fraternities and sororities play in ed
ucational and social efforts, as well as the criteria
that determine whether a fraternity may remain in
on-campus housing and the Greek community's sys
tem of judicial review.
Edmonds said the task force, whose members
have not yet been named, would look at "just about
all aspects of Greek life," attempting to precisely

identify the organizations' "relevance to today."
The relationship between administrators and
Greek organizations has been strained recently over
the issue of housing. The Delta Tau Delta fraternity
was evicted from its house on 353 Campus Dr. at the
end of fall quarter. Last year, two other fraternities
— Kappa Alpha and Beta Theta Pi — lost their hous
es because they had too few pledges.
Several sororities have also long sought to reverse
their current unhoused status, but earlier this
month, Director of Student Activities Nanci Howe
said they would not be able to move in until at least
the 1997-98 school year for logistical reasons.
Edmonds said that despite the somewhat uncer
tain climate, members of the Greek community
ought not to view the task force as another attempt
to discipline Greek organizations for perceived irre-
sponsibility. "My intention is to
make them stronger," she said.
Greek organizations currently
have a peer review process that

handles any behavioral problems
within a fraternity or sorority.
The task force — which will
complete its recommendations by
the end of fall quarter next year —
will be composed of non-Greek
and Greek students. Faculty and
staff will also be included, she
said.
