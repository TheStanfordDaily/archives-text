## Kristie Lü Stout Rebels without applause: Tom Jones & polyester 
### 
"One man's cheese is another's fromage."
— Tom Jones
Tom Jones — crooner, chest-hair horti
culturist and imaginary playmate to
more than 4 million menopausal
women — is the spoiling Kraft Single of pop
music: Congealing. Unpalatable. Even get
ting a tinge of azure-green fuzzies on those
Bart Simpson yellow corners.
But, to my grandma, he's the Roquefort of
Rock.
Tom Jones, the over-the-hill pile of flesh
encased in tight black leather ... Tom Jones,
the geriatric has-been who has the stage li
bido of al7 year-old Chippendale ... Tom
Jones, the cosmetically-enhanced incarnate
of Michael Bolton over 60, ain't just the pa
thetic Kraft Single left to rot alone in the bow
els ofthecelebrity frigidairc. I le's the Buddha
of Bop to grandmothers worldwide, his idol
atry so passionate it would make even gor
gonzola spoil with envy.
Although the old crooner may attract only
ridicule and rotten tomatoes from the post-

Atari set, he's a winner with the golden girls.
And how so? Why? HELLO?!? Are we missing
something here?!? Are our grandmothers ac
tually right when they instruct us: "Honey
honey-honey, SPE 60 still can't block the can
cer, eat your lentils and Tom Jones is a better
singer than that L,enny Kravitz young man,
whether you like it or not."
Perhaps the wisdom of their cumulative
days of consciousness has given grandmoth
ers the vision to embrace the marginal, often
ridiculed and under-appreciated. Perhaps
that's why my grandma not only jitterbugs to
Tom Jones, but wears a fuchsia muumuu,
adores Jerry Lewis and lives in Fort Laud
erdale.
Accepting the conventionally uncool
and being sympathetic to those rebels with
out applause (i.e. Tom Jones), my grand
mother is the Mother Theresa of popular
culture. She pardoned leopard spot prints
before it left the confines of total bad-taste
status. She gave Charo the courtesy laugh.
She was the advocate and defender of bell
bottoms during the height of pegged pants.

She was even the only member of the John
Travolta fan club before the pulp friction
rubbed everyone into pro-Travolta mania.
My grandmother, bless her heart, has been
consistently loyal to products and personal
ities that have ebbed in and out of fashion:
Charo, Travolta, polyester, Velcro, Juan Es
quivel, Tony Bennett and Allanis ("She was
a perfectly splendid pop star in the '80s,
simply adorable on that PBS show!") Mor
riset.
Rather than falling into the rut of easy
snobbery, she does the watusi on the wild
side and flirts with freakish fads. Instead of
investing her attention to the static and safe
pleasures of tea, chamber music and Mer
chant Ivory films, my grandmother watch
es "Dark Shadows" reruns, sips mint juleps
with purple paper parasols and muses over
the forgotten celebs of lore who have been
discarded as the stinking cheddar of
celebrity:
"Heavens to betsy that David Leisure fel
low was a riot! 'Mr. Joe Isuzu' — whatevah
happened to that talented young man?"

My grandmother's touching appreciation
for the talents of the discarded has single
handedly brought back not only Travolta, but
Jennifer Beales and Suzanne Sommers
(though, she admits, resurrecting Adam Ant
has been a toughie). She's looking forward to
other challenges, other rotting Kraft Singles
of pop culture who need a bit of her affection
to afford a decent comeback including
"Dance Fever," Lou Ferigno, Samantha Fox,
Emmanuel Lewis, Eric Estrada, "In Search
Of," Phyllis Diller, roller derby, Skip from
"Real People," shag rugs, Carol Channing,
Donna Summer, Hulk Hogan, Trans Ams
and Rip Taylor.
My grandmother's faith in vacant '80s
pop, hackneyed slapstick humor and embar
rassing '70s decadence has saved pop trash
such as Travolta and Sommers from the cog
nitive garbage disposal of the collective
memory. It has also provided the hope for
Estrada ct al. that they too can. leave the cur
rent status they share with rancid aerosol
cheese and once again become the fromagc of
celebrity.
