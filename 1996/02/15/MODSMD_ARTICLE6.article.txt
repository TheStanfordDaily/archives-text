# Caffeine lovers can get their daily java and a newspaper too
## New coffee kiosk set for Green 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
Students who complain that
their day at the library is typically
dry, dark and sleep-inducing may
soon find a cure for all these con
ditions located just outside.
Plans to erect a coffee kiosk be
tween Green Library and Meyer
Library are proceeding smoothly,
University officials said yester
day, and students may soon be
able to freshen their spirits with a
quick jaunt outside for a caffeine

rich dose of the black stuff.
Pending 112 nal approval, the cof
fee bar may be up and running
within a few months, said Jefrey
Pudewell, a library administrator
who is in charge of the project.
The new kiosk will include an out
door seating area and provide na
tional and international newspa
pers that people can read while
drinking coffee, Pudewell said.
Stanford is negotiating with
Peet's Coffee on possible lease and
operation of the stand, according
to Pudewell.

The fixed structure would be
located in front of Green Library
in the area that is currently allot
ted for bike parking. The parking
racks will be relocated now there.
The new beverage stand is de
scribed as a "small little service
structure fixed with utility con
nections" by Cathy Blake, a plan
ner and architect at the Planning
Office.
When the kiosk will be built de
pends on the contracts and the
bids for construction, Pudewell
said. Drawings for the kiosk have
yet to be completed.
"This will make the library spot
a destination spot," Pudewell said.
He added that the coffee bar will
stick to serving coffee and other
beverages.
Student response to the news
varied. "It would be awesome to
have a place to stop and get some
coffee on t he way to class and when
you are studying," said sophomore
Aron Weisner. In contrast, ju
nior Henry Tien said, "Although
creating a coffee stand would be

much appreciated by students, es
pecially those who frequent the li
braries, I think that creating a
commercial establishment in such
a highly trafficked area would de
tract from the academic atmos
phere of the University."
The idea for a coffee kiosk was
suggested this summer by library
administration and went before a
committee of the Hoard of
Trustees. Since then, library offi
cials have been working on the
project with the Planning Office,
which has offered guidelines
about operations, architecture
and technical matters.
Additionally, the Planning Of
fice has worked to ensure that "it
fits well with the overall concept of
the University," Blake said.
