## O robot, wherefore art thou, robot? Robotic Romeo and Juliet aid people in everyday tasks 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
There's more to Stanford's robotics laboratories
than just dancing robots.
The William Gates Computer Science Building
now houses the Computer Science Department's
port ion of the robotics program, which is regarded as
one of the best in the world.
Thanks to programs such Stanford's, robots are
moving beyond simple manufacturing tasks into

less-structured areas such as service, health care and
construction, said Assoc. Computer Science Prof.
Oussama Khatib.
"The development of robots for unstructured en
vironments is much more challenging because these
robots cannot simply be pre-programmed," Khatib
said.
Currently, Stanford is developing semi-au
tonomous "robotic assistants" that can aid people in

many of their everyday tasks.
"We want to bring to the human
a machine that is very flexible, that
could relieve him from difficult
tasks, such as supporting heavy
loads," Khatib said.
Khatib said robots are being de
veloped that can react and work in a
number of different, unstructured
environments.
"We are developing capabilities
so that in real time, (the robots] can
react with the environment," Khat
ib said.
Two robots developed in a Stan
ford robotics laboratory, named
Romeo and Juliet, exhibit many of
the sensor-based reactionary capa
bilities first developed at the Uni
versity.

A person can "dance" with
Romeo or Juliet by pushing or
pulling on the robot's arm, Khatib
said. The robot reacts to the move
ment by straightening its arm, thus
"dancing" with the person.
Romeo and Juliet can also per
form a variety of other tasks, in
cluding erasing a chalkboard, clean
ing off a table and even working to
gether to carry large objects.
Current robotics research and
development in the Computer Sci
ence Department is divided into
four areas: motion planning, vision
and perception, manipulation mid
robotic learning.
Stanford currently uses a bot
tom-up approach in robotics devel
opment, according to Khatib. De
velopment starts with the robot,
with various capabilities being
gradually developed for the robot.
"We are trying to move toward
intelligent (robot) behavior by mov

ing step by step," Khatib said.
Because of the number of disci
plines used in robotics, the students
working in the field come from the
Departments of Computer Science,
Electrical Engineering, Mechanical
Engineering, and Aeronautics and
Astronautics, Khatib said.
In addition to the research done
in the computer science laboratory,
robotics research is also done at the
Aerospace Robotics Laboratory and
the Center for Design Research.
Eight graduate students cur
rently work in the robotics pro
gram, hoping to broaden the scope
of current robotics applications.
"We're hoping to open up new
fields in robotics to employ our
selves," said Oliver Brock, a gradu
ate student in computer science.
The students and professors say
they are excited about their new
home in the Gates Building. Before
the January opening of the build

ing, the computer science robotics
program was split between four dif
ferent buildings.
"It was hard to interact with peo
ple, because they were all going to
their offices in different places,"
Khatib said
Now, the laboratory and offices
are under one roof.
"The most amazing thing is see
ing more people from computer sci
ence in our lab," Khatib said. "That
would not happen before. By bring
ing people together, we have richer
interaction."
Khatib noted such interaction is
especially important because of the
number of computer science areas
used in robotics, such as artificial
intelligence and graphics.
"We get to see our advisers
everyday now," said Robert Holm
berg, a graduate student in me
chanical engineering. "That didn't
happen before."
