There's more to Stanford's robotics laboratories

Thanks to programs such Stanford's, robots are
moving beyond simple manufacturing tasks into

less-structured areas such as service, health care and
construction, said Assoc. Computer Science Prof.
Oussama Khatib.

vironments is much more challenging because these
robots cannot simply be pre-programmed," Khatib
said.
Currently, Stanford is developing semi-au
tonomous "robotic assistants" that can aid people in
