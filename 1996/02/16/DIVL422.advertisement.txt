That's right, kids -- we've blasted into Cyberspace! We're caught in
the Net. Snared in the World Wide Web. There'll be no more queuing
up to get online! Luft die Infobahn weht!
When it was
just a game
Mikey Rinaggio had all the cool toys.
His house wasn't as big as some of
the other kids' houses, and sure he
had a really obnoxious older sister who
screamed a lot, but he lived exactly nine
houses down from me and he had all the cool
toys.
And he had the Atari.
Now. we're not talkin' one of those Atari
brand souped up Vic-20-like, pre-Apple II
computers with the green displays and car
tridge drive that they had in the AV-room at
school. We're talkin' about the real stuff here.
State-of-'fhc aif graphics: Hard-core gaming
action. That raw pixel-power, joystick-and
padddlc, bug-out-your-eyes-and-leave-'em
tliere-for-days video experience that was the
Atari 26<X) Home Video Game System.
That, my friend, was the Next Generation.
I'd slaughter Mikey in Joust, flying my
prehistoric beast with manic accuracy, crush
ing his puny winged buzzard with a click of
the joystick button. I'd watch him get
"splooched" in Frogger by that third row of
cars that always seemed to move faster than
the first two rows, and then I'd hop. skip and
ribbit my way through the perils like the nim
ble swamp creature that I was.
And then there was the Intergalactic Tno
(Space Invaders, Asteroids and Missile Com
mand). Mikey was no match for my blister
ing. trigger speed, always knowing the pre
cise moment to pull back on the joystick
launching the Cosmic Space Patrol into
hypers pace avoiding that last piece of shrap
nel left by the vaporized asteroid. Mikey was
space sludge beside my command of the
ABM's (anti-ballistic missiles) of Zardon and
my laser cannon control in warding off the
marauding aliens.
Come to think of it, Mikey Rinaggio
wasn't very gtxxl at Atari.
Matt Nudelman had Intcllivision (with
that special disc that "moves objects on the
screen in 16 different directions with life-like
precision"), which wasn't nearly as cool as
the Atari 2600, but he lived across the street
from the Rinaggios and he had a really awe
some basement. It was carpeted in one part
where the TV and Intellivision were and had
a cement floor in the other part so that we
could play hockey and Crossbows and Cata
pults. He also had more Legos than God.
Pat Hubert had Colecovision. but Coleco
vision sucked. No one talked to him. Then
again, he ate paste and smelled.
The years slowly passed and the Atari
2600 was replaced by the mother of all moth
erboards: the Nintendo. Gotta love them
Japanese. Wlien Nintendo hit the market, 1
was sure that I had died and gone to eight-bit
heaven. The Nintendo Entertainment System
— this wasn't just a video game system, this
was entertainment. The NES. 1 mean it even
had cool initials. No more joysticks, the Nin
tendo Entertainment System boasted the
improved, ergonomically-designed, rectan
gular NES controller with, count-'em, two
buttons. And it came with the coolest game
where this Italian plumber-guy punched
bricks and jumped on turtles and mushroom
heads and climbed magic vines and shot
Jeremy
Desmon
bouncing fireballs (even under water!) in his
journey to knock a deadly bouncing dragon
into red boiling lava and rescue the lovely and
charming Mushroom Princess-in-distress
from certain death.
Beats the hell out of a jumping frog that
gets "splooched," don't it?
For months. 1 saved up my allowance and
finally bought myself the NES at Kay-Bee
Toys one December. I think I locked myself
in my room for three days straight when I
finally got that puppy home. I borrowed Leg
end of Zelda from Mike Kotas and left my
room only for pee breaks and dinner. Then
there was Ice Hockey and Tennis and Super
Tecmo Bowl — all classics. Eight bits of pure
pleasure. That's one whole byte of arcade
action.
Then something happened. I don't
know exactly what it was, but overnight
things started growing. Like fungus on
shower shoes, the youth of America were
infested by the all-exciting "16-bit" revolu
tion: Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo.
Sega certainly got me through some of
those rough times freshman year, but this
new found complexity in video games
changed the whole home arcade landscape.
Games began to remember stuff about you.
keeping tally of your wins and losses, and
none of that "top ten high scorer" crap,
we're talkin' demographics. "JCD. White
male, 5'9", Public Policy major with
sweaty hands. . ." Mario is no longer a
mere plumber — he's Big Brother.
Now they've got Sony Playstation and
Sega Saturn and that 3DO thing, and the
games are on compact discs now. The guys
you shoot actually bleed. They have whirling,
twirling instant replay. This time it's 32 bits.
That's more than aH my lingers and toes and
your lingers and toe put together. Who needs
that many bits? And now my friend tells me
that Nintendo is coming out with Ultra 64 or
something in less than a year for about $S(X).
For that much cash, it better do my laundry
and cook one hell of a souffle.
And then, of course, there is Marathon
and Doom and those other super computer
games. Not only do you have to study and
prepare to play these games in the first place,
but once you learn how, the objective is to
shoot your friends. And then, after awhile,
you have no friends left. Certainly a far cry
from the good-natured bleeps and blips of the
Atari 2600.
Frankly. I miss Frogger. I was surfing the
Information Superhighway the other day and
I tracked down a picture of the old Frogger
screen. It was nostalgia. It was memory. It
was, we 11... it looked like crap. But then 1
started to think back to my childhood and
Mikey Rinaggio nine houses down on Shad
owwood Drive, where the 2600 awaited.
Sweet thoughts of that froggy little guy skip
ping his way lo the last free lily pad skittered
through my mind, and I imagined the cars
zooming faster and faster as I racked up
points to the maximum allowable 9999, all
while Mikey watched, in amazement, waiting
for me to get "splooched" so I'd go home and
he could finally play his Atari again.
