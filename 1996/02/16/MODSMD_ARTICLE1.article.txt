# 28 at SLAC receive layoff notices
## Federal budget cuts to accelerator center force reduction in staff 
### Adam Kemezis Contributing Writer 
Officials at Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center announced yesterday that 28 workers
will be laid off as a result of government budget
cuts to the center.
SLAC announced last November that the
center's work force would be cut from 1,350
people to 1,280. In addition to the 28 involun
tary layoffs announced yesterday, 42 employ
ees had already chosen to take voluntary lay
offs in January.
SLAC Public Affairs Director P.A. Moore
said that SLAC's operating budget, which is
provided by the Department of Energy, was re
duced by about $7 million from a level of $123
million in fiscal 1995, about a 5 percent cut.

bhe added that this reflected an overall cut in
how much Congress appropriates for the DOE.
The involuntary layoffs will take effect
March 15, with the voluntary layoffs taking ef
fect at individually-decided times between now
and September.
SI.AC Director Burton Richter said yester
day that "Scientifically, [SLAC has] a strong
and bright future, but it will have to be a small
er center."
Richter stressed that the basic functions of
SLAC would be impaired as little as possible.
"We've squeezed low-priority programs and
not touched high-priority ones," he added.
In spite of the need to establish priorities,
Personnel Director Lee Lyon said "therearen't
any overall scientific programs being eliminat
ed" and that cuts were not concentrated in any

one area.
Both voluntarily and invol
untarily laid-off workers will
be released on the same terms.
These include severance pay

determined by length of service, continued
health benefits for three months and free par
ticipation for one year in a career counseling
program. SLAC will also put the resumes of
former workers in a "resume book" which will
be sent to local employers.
Lyon added that SLAC followed standard
University policy in determining whom to lay
off, which is based on which functions are most
necessary and efficiently done. According to
the policy, when two positions are comparably


Richter
necessary and efficient, the deci
sion is based on seniority alone for
workers wit h union contracts and
seniority and "affirmative action
concerns" for others, Lyon said.

Moore noted that prospects are
better for ex-SLAC employees
than laid-off workers in some
other sectors because they have
skills that are extremely valuable
in the expanding technology in
dustry.
"Silicon Valley is hiring,"
Moore added.
