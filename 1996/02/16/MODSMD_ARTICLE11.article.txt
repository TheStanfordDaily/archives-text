# Country wary of science, Teller says
## 
### Sara Southern Staff writer 
Renowned physicist Edward
Teller, senior research fellow at
Hoover Institution and inventor of
the hydrogen bomb, addressed a
crowd of about 70 last night in a
speech concerning science and pol
itics, warning that his opinions in
the area "aren't the usual general
opinion."
According to Teller, the way sci
ence and technology are viewed in
the United States has shifted dra
matically since the beginning of the
century.
"When I arrived in this country,
science was on a pedestal — what
was new was good," said Teller.
"Now what is new is suspicious. It
will either hurt the environment
or it is dangerous to humanity.
People think we're going too fast.
This is clearly not my opinion, but
unfortunately is that of the major
ity."
Teller attributed such reserva
tion on the part of Americans to the
fact that since the early part of this
century, science has developed
from something simplistic and de
termined, to something that is
probabilistic and "mysterious."
"In 1900, the world could be un
derstood as a machine," said
Teller. "Since then relativity and
quantum physics have produced
something entirely unheard of —
we cannot predict the future, only
the probability of the future, and
even those probabilities are built
around indefinite combinations."
Teller elaborated, remarking
that whether speaking of light or
human beings, science is engaged
in making "connections."
"Do electrons and light behave
like waves or particles?" Teller
asked the audience. "They behave

like both," he answered forcefully,
"and to neglect either is wrong."
Teller remarked that this "mys
terious science" has produced
amazing advances such as nuclear
energy but at the same time given
rise to resentment.
"People say we've made these
horrible things like atomic bombs
and suggest maybe we 'stop think
ing so much,' "he added. "I believe,
and this is my religion, that every
knowledge is good and that the
world in which we live is danger
ous. The greatest danger of all,
however, does not lie in knowledge
but in the lack of knowledge."
Teller addressed some issues of
policy, asserting that the United
States must continue research in
the area of nuclear energy both for
defense purposes and for coopera
tion among nations.
"I don't know why people are so
af:raid of science and using what we
have found in science for the pur
pose of bringing about cooperation
between nations," he said, stress
ing that this is a universal stance of
both Democrats and Republicans.
Teller offered an answer to the
pervasive suspiciousness Ameri
cans foster for science. He empha
sized the need not only for progress
but for a greater "openness" in sci
ence.
"We need to explain what is
being done in science to the public
at large for a common understand
ing," Teller said. He added that
such an understanding is vital if
the fears of the uninformed public
are to be quelled. He asserted that
these fears, and the "resulting con
flict between science and politics"
will otherwise be very dangerous.
The event was the fourth in a
public policy speaker series spon
sored by the Stanford College Re
publicans.
