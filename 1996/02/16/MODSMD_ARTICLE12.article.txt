The curtain rises and the lights fade up. A
woman looks into the crowd, and says, "Eisen
hower was in the White House talking about
prosperity. Annette Funicello had a perky face
we admired and boobs we envied. Our Buick
Super got 5 miles to the gallon and could com
fortably seat eight. But the girls I knew only had
sweet suburban dreams."
This introduction sets the scene for "Danger!
Woman on Board!!!" — a new play which spans
four decades and recalls the upsajid downs of re
lationships and maturity in two women's lives.
The play will be performed today and tomorrow
at 8:30 p.m. in Memorial Hall.
The author and actor of this one-woman show
is Janis Wick, an administrator at the School of
Medicine. Wick started writing 10 years ago and
has published several short stories. She decided
to combine writing with performance after
studying improvisational theater.
Wick said she derives her inspiration from a
desire to portray the experiences of the men and
women of the baby boom generation. "I was in
terested in using humor and pathos in lookingat

how that period influenced our lives as adults,
both men and women," Wick said.
The play is constructed of monologues and
scenes relating vignettes in the lives of two
friends, Mary and Emily, Wick said. The show
examines their development into mature
women — beingraised during the sexual repres
sion of the '50s, being immersed in the activism
and sexual revolution of the '60s, becoming
strong feminists in the '70s and becoming moth
ers thereafter.
"It was hard for women of our generation be
cause we went through so many changes with
out any role models," Wick said. "What women
take for granted today, women in the '60s could
not take for granted. Modern women are uncon
sciously reaping the benefits."
According to Wick, the show is a quirky, idio
syncratic, feminist play focusing on the humor
ous way men and women are different, and how
this leads to trouble. "The characters have high
expectations for blissful relationships with men
that are highly unrealistic," Wick said.
Wick stressed that although the show focus
es on the lives of people of the baby boom gener
ation, it also has a message for a younger audi

ence. The play is meant to be feminist without
being didactic.
"The message is simply that women can do
whatever they want. They can break the bound
aries," Wick said.
However, while modern women do enjoy
many liberties, Wick feels there are still impor
tant issues to contend with, especially economi
cally. "We need to focus on adequate child care,
women with children who are living in poverty,
and poor women who are not getting adequate
health aire. These are things we need to work on
and learn about," Wick said.
All the profits of the show will benefit the
Stanford Women's Center Collective, an um
brella organization for all the women's groups
on campus. "I wanted the play to benefit an or
ganization on the Stanford campus, since I have
worked here so long," Wick said. "The Women's
Center seemed a logical choice, since my play
deals with women's issues."
"It's incredible that there is someone so ded
icated to the community," Marya Howell,
Women's Center coordinator, said about Wick.
"It speaks of [Wick's] dedication to women on
campus and to women's issues."
