## GOP hopefuls debate issues 
### 
MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) - Bob Dole and
Pat Buchanan clashed repeatedly over taxes,
trade and tactics yesterday night as eight Repub
lican presidential hopefuls offered competing con
servative agendas in a crackling debate five days
before New Hampshire's pivotal primary.
Looking to revive his troubled campaign, pub
lisher Steve Forbes said he had made a mistake
airing negative ads. Yet in the next breath he
labeled Dole a tax raiser and raised ethical ques
tions about the financial dealings of former Ten
nessee Gov. Lamar Alexander.
Firing back, Alexander said his personal deal
ings were detailed in tax returns he has released
to the public. "Steve, why don't you disclose your
taxes?" Alexander said. Forbes has refused to do
so, and after the debate, Forbes suggested Alexan
der change his campaign theme song to 'Alexan
der's Ragtime Scam."
The urgent tone reflected the volatility of the
New Hampshire race — and the entire GOP pres
idential campaign — heading into the final week
end before Tuesday's vote.
Most of the shots were directed at Dole,
Buchanan and Alexander — the top three finish
ers in Monday's lowa caucuses. No knockout
blows were landed, but the pointed salvos sug
gested a tumultuous weekend ahead. "I've been
shot at a lot tonight but I've been in combat
before," Dole joked, nervously.
Several long shots complained about that,
warning that biggest winner of the bitter primary
battle might be the incumbent Democrat. "We
have to stop tearing at one another," said Califor
nia Rep. Robert Dornan.
