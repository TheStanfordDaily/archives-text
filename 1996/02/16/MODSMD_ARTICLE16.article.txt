# Judge bans new law

PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Yes
terday, a federal judge banned the
government from enforcing a new
law forbidding the transmission
of "indecent" material to minors
over computer networks.
U.S. District Judge Ronald L.
Buckwalter said his temporary
restraining order would remain in
effect at least until he hears argu
ments on a lawsuit the American
Civil Liberties Union and 19
other groups filed on Feb. 8 â€” the
same day President Clinton
signed the Communications

Decency Act into law.
At the time, the Justice
Department said it would wait at
least a week before prosecuting
any violators, but didn't rule out
gathering evidence in the mean
time.
The ACLU argued the law
would violate privacy rights and
strangle free speech by authoriz
ing the government to prosecute
people even for the private mes
sages they send about AIDS,
abortion, politics and science
any subject involving sex.
