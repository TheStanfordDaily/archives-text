# Yeltsin to run in June
## Hopes to become a compromise candidate 
### 
YEKATERINBURG, Russia (AP) - He
was hoarse. He rambled, at times seeming
incoherent. His audience was unenthused.
It was an inauspicious start to Boris
Yeltsin's quest for a second term as he
made his grand announcement yesterday
that he would run in the June 16 presiden
tial election.
Defiant and defensive in his hour-long
speech, Yeltsin insisted only he could guar
antee democracy and stability in Russia.
Although Yeltsin has largely lost the
support of the reformist forces that were
his core constituency five years ago, he
hopes to become a compromise candidate
rallying them and moderates against Com
munists and ultranationalists. But some
observers believe his popularity is too low
and that he will split the reformist vote.
"I must bring to a successful finish the
work I gave myself completely to," the
weary-looking president told supporters in
his hometown of Yekaterinburg. "I am con
vinced that I can lead this country across
the troubles, anxiety and uncertainty."
In contrast, the resurgent Communist
Party held a near-euphoric convention yes
terday in Moscow to unanimously nomi
nate its leader, Gennady Zyuganov, to run
against Yeltsin. Zyuganov is the front-run
ner in early polls.
Wading into crowds before his re-elec
tion speech, the 65-year-old Yeltsin showed
(lashes of the energy and populist touch
that five years ago made him Russia's first

democratically elected president. He asked
people about their problems and got a few
hugs.
As in 1991, Yeltsin is campaigning
against the Communists, reminding his
audience of the long lines and shortages of
Soviet days, and the stifling of free speech.
But Russians are less receptive to that
message now, worried more about the post-
Soviet hardships of lost savings, unpaid
wages, the huge gap between rich and poor,
and the costly war in Chechnya.
Still, Yeltsin has made a career of politi
cal comebacks and opponents said yester
day that they could not count him out.
Yeltsin has been distancing himself
from his more unpopular reforms and
promising many hard-hit sectors that he
will pay state debts in full, at once.
Although economists say that could break
the budget, Yeltsin promised more such
spending yesterday: to hospitals, subway
systems and others who complain of short
funding.
"I am for reforms, but not at any price,"
he said.
Acknowledging mistakes, he warned
supporters that abandoning market
reforms and democracy would be worse —
and could lead to dictatorship or even civil
war.
"We cannot afford to repeat the tragic
mistake of 1917 and once again allow this
country to split into the whites and the
reds," he said.
