Buchanan's campaign co-chair resigns
WASHINGTON (AP) — Pat Buchanan's campaign co-chairman,
Larry Pratt, stepped aside yesterday after reports linked him to
white supremacists and right-wing militia leaders, but Buchanan
said he was certain the charges, which Pratt denied, are untrue.
Critics immediately used Buchanan's close ties to Pratt, director
of Gun Owners of America, to revive questions about the candidate's
own views on race and equality.
"If there's a group promoting white supremacy in America, my
country, I don't want anything to do with this," Buchanan said,
campaigning in New Hampshire where he already faces ads aired by
Kansas Sen. Bob Dole that call his views extreme.

Industry working on standards
NEW YORK (AP) — Pressured by the new "v-chip" law, the
titans of the television industry are close to agreeing on their own
standards for rating sex, violence and obscenity on TV, industry
sources said yesterday.
"We have decided to implement an MPAA-like ratings system for
the television programs on Fox," said News Corp. Chairman Rupert
Murdoch. "We are prepared to act unilaterally if necessary."
The discussions, by conference call and meetings in New York and
Los Angeles, involve Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Asso
ciation of America, which provides the familiar NC-17, R, PG and G
movie ratings.
