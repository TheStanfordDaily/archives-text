Quest >ns surrounding Asian-
Amcrican Studies and affirmative
action dominated a panel discus
sion last night in Tresidder
Union.
Several students and admin
istrators active with multicul
tural issues at Stanfoid sat on
the panel, sponsored by the
Asian American Students Asso
ciation.
Multicultural Educator
Tommy Woon emphasized the im
portance of Asian-American stud
ies in helping him understand his
relationship with his family and
society.
"I can't imagine a life without
Asian-American studies," he said.
"I was fortunate enough to go to a
school [UC-Davis] where there
was Asian-American studies and
students were writing the pro
gram that year.
"What the administration and
faculty need to understand,"
Woon said, "is that Asian-Ameri
can studies is not just a fad of the
moment but part of a continu
um."
Senior Kr s I layashi, a member
of Concerned Students for Asian
American Studies, also criticized
the lack of a strong ethnic pro
gram at Stanford.
"To put it bluntly," Hayashi
said, "I think Stanford and insti
11 lions like Stanford produce a lot
of the people who go on to screw
up the world. By bringing in
Asian-American Studies and
Chicano Studies, we hope to
change this situation."
Stressing the similarities of
their causes, some members of
the Chicano community in
attendance offered their support
to CSAAS' fight.
"We're all pretty much in the
same plight, just at different
levels," sophomore Cindy
Urquidez said. "For me person
ally, I think that the communi
ties need to work together
because the administration is
doing the same thing to both
groups."
Stanford's proposed program
in Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity — which would
allow students to concentrate in
Asian-American Studies, Chi

cano Studies, African and Afro-
American studies or a cross-cul
tural theme — has recently
come under fire because of ques
tions about its hiring policy.
One faculty member in both
Chicano and Asian-American
Studies will be hired as part of
the program.
History Prof. Gordon Chang,
who this week joined the CSRE
program's search for the new
faculty members, offered hope
that the hiring situation would
soon be solved. Currently, he
said, there are 35 applicants for
the teaching position in both
Asian-American and Chicano
Studies at Stanford.
Hayashi said an Asian-Ameri
can Studies class may be offered
next quarter to introduce stu
dents to the new major.
Although details are still
sketchy, she said that providing
such a class would help ensure
that students would maintain
interest in learning Asian-

American history.
Sophomore Bill Shen, deputy
chair of the ASSU Senate,
brought up the problem of affir
mative action's relationship
with the Asian-American com
munity. He decried the repre
sentation of Asians as a model
minority group as a double
edged sword.
"The same people who are
applauding us now," Shen said,
"are the same people who, back
in the '80s when we began flood
ing into the Harvards, Yales and
others, are the ones who
changed the standards from
grades and SAT scores to well
roundedness."
Freshman Jane Kim also
complained about combining all
Asian Americans into a single
group. "I think the Asian-Amer
ican label has been contrived,"
she said. "Unfortunately, the
larger community sees us as one
large group, and skin color has a
lot to do with it."
