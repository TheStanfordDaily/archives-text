## An honorable code 
### 
The University must be
more forthcoming with
details about violations

Before ever setting
foot on the Farm, students
are subject to the Honor Code
and Fundamental Standard. As part
of their application materials,
they've signed an agreement to
adhere to Stanford's academic and
conduct guidelines. When students
finally arrive, the University con
stantly reminds them of this con
tract, making them sign countless
blue books to prove their honesty.
Although there are some Honor
Code violations each year — and this
year the numbers increased — most
students take their responsibility
seriously. The University, however,
undermines student faith in the
Honor Code system.
Eveiy year, Stanford's Office of
Judicial Affairs releases statistics
outlining the number of Honor Code
and Fundamental Standard viola
tions. This data gives specific num
bers and the departments where vio
lations occurred — but only vague
descriptions of what each violation
was and its corresponding punish
ment. It is commendable that the
University allows these numbers to
be examined publicly, but the infor
mation given needs to go beyond
mere numbers.
This secretive attitude diminish
es faith in the system. The Honor
Code depends on student participa
tion — failure to report cases of
cheating is itself a violation of the
code. But if students report alleged
infractions and do not see the
results of their efforts — in the form
of detailed annual reports — their
sense of responsibility to point out
fellow students' violations decreas
es. No one is quite sure how effective
the system is or what is or is not
being covered up by the University.
Furthermore, when the viola
tions committed and their corre

sponding punishments are not
announced to the University com
munity, the Judicial Affairs Office
creates a climate in which students
cannot be sure that there is no
favoritism involved in the process.
When students are unaware of the
sentences imposed, some may won
der how punishments received by
student-athletes, for example, com
pared to those received by "regular"
students.
Stanford's reason for not releas
ing specifics — including the name
of the alleged offender and details
regarding the violation and its sub
sequent punishment — has to do
with privacy. Even the mere accusa
tion of an Honor Code violation can
mark a student in a negative way,
marring his or her academic reputa
tion for the duration of his or her
career at Stanford and for any aca
demic pursuits he or she might have
beyond the University. It is possible,
however, to maintain privacy while
having a more open policy.
The University should, in their
annual reports, list specific viola
tions and their corresponding pun
ishments in as much detail as possi
ble. In doing this, the administra
tion would not only promote a sense
of honesty in dealing with Honor
Code cases, but would set a concrete
precedent describing how specific
violations are dealt with.
Keeping the names of the guilty
and the accused confidential would
allow the University to protect the
reputations of its students, and
would not undermine the academic
reputation of those students. The
point is not to scrutinize each partic
ular student, but each particular
case.
Court cases are public informa
tion — anyone can research the
names of those accused, their arrest
history, the crimes of which they are
accused and the circumstances sur
rounding the charge. While Stan
ford needs to take care to treat cases
as violations of contract with the
University, not as crimes against
society, it should alter its policy to
mimic more closely a court treat
ment of charges.
