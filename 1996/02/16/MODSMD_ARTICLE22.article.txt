## Discussing discussing race 
### 
CORNEL WEST CAME to campus
in February and charged us all
with engaging in a dialogue on
race. In the series of talks on affirmative
action and race, many other speakers
have also encouraged people to discuss
and understand our differences and simi
larities.
But no one gave a concrete program
for how this discourse might be initiated.
Do I walk up to the first person I see and
ask "So what do you think about race
relations?" How does one start to talk
about such a touchy subject with people
who are relative strangers? Oftentimes it
is difficult talking about sensitive issues
to people close to us; discussion about as
sensitive a subject as race with people of
unknown character and temperament
seems impossible.
In many forums, the discussion about
affirmative action and race relations
focuses on black and white. As that is the
type of discussion with which I am per
sonally familiar, I shall also focus on that.
There are experiences which are unique
to the black-white exchange. Many inter
actions between blacks and whites are
characterized by the fragile uneasiness of
an unstable truce. Common to relation
ships between people of all kinds, there
are various levels of interaction: complete
ignorance of one's existence (in spite of
the fact that you have lived next to the
person for three months or been in all of

their classes for three years), nodding
acknowledgment upon passing each
other on campus or in the dorm; a quick
hello (occasionally even adding an appel
lation); the "Hi, how are you, how are
classes, how is the quarter going, how
was your break" level; the "let's play a
sport / see a movie / have a meal together
level;" and then there are potentially lev
els above those.
In the levels described above, there are
usually several factors at work, most of
them basic human coping mechanisms
for dealing with other humans, complete
ly unconnected to race issues; however,
black-white relations can often be charac
terized by a sense of discomfort (on both
sides, though the discomfort is probably
higher for whites — after all, most black
people have dealt with white people
before) and an unspoken understanding
— "I won't mention anything sensitive if
you won't."
What these last two translate to in this
environment is the superficial cordiality
of polite society. The relationships are
scripted — a platitude is uttered, an
appropriate response is given. In our
polite society, things go unsaid, an effort
is made to keep things as civil as possible.
Uncomfortable subjects are avoided,
uneasiness is unexpressed. West pointed
to this pushing away of discomforting
thoughts and feelings as a characteristic
of our "hotel society." To me there is

something about it that shows we (Amer
icans) lack maturity as a culture.
Now, lest I give you the wrong impres
sion, I am a practicing member of the hotel
society West mentioned. There are few
people with whom I have been able to have
a discussion about race. This is good and
bad. I do not feel that my existence should
be defined solely by my race. I do feel a cer
tain responsibility to discuss the issues,
but that could be the topic of an entire col
umn by itself. However, I don't want to shy
away from the responsibility or the oppor
tunities to have these discussions. I have
had two memorable ones since arriving
here — one with a group of friends, mostly
black, and another with a Jewish guy in my
dorm whom I did not know very well.
Both of these conversations were
enlightening and liberating. I think that
we all came to a better understanding of
the problems, internal and external, that
confront us in dealing with this issue. Did
it change the world? No. Did it change a
few minds? Probably not; the people
involved were not racists. Did it inform a
few people so that hopefully they can go
on and inform more people? I hope so.
