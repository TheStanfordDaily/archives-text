Maples' Sixth Man section should be for students only

THIS PAST WEEKEND, hundreds
of Stanford students had an excel
lent time watching the Cardinal
beat the defending national champion
UCLA Bruins. But there were also a few
Stanford students who did not have a
good time at the game (and I'm not talk
ing about the traitors who found them
selves cheering for UCLA). These stu
dents, like so many others in the past,
had to deal with an intrusive person
known all-too-afiectionately as the
"Superfan." He is a red-shirt-wearing
male adult who feels he has the right to
barge into the student section reserved
for members of the Sixth Man Club. Indi
vidual spots are not reserved in this sec
tion, yet for some odd reason, he claims
the mid-court, first-row spot as his own.
So what's the problem? So what if a

guy is trying to recapture his youth, sit
ting in on the student section and having
a good time? There are many problems.
First of all, this man feels that because
he has gone to so many Stanford events,
he has the right to stand wherever he
wants — obviously, in one of the best
spots in the house. This is ridiculous.
Going by this logic, Aunt Gertrude and
Uncle Milton, class of '45, should be able
to stand wherever they want because
they've gone to just about every Stanford
sporting event since graduation. This
makes absolutely no sense — the fact
that this guy has been to a lot of Stan
ford basketball games is meaningless.
Yet he, and all of the "security
guards" who govern the Sixth Man sec
tion, tend to think otherwise. They allow
him to stand wherever he wants, while

they constantly remind students to
stand back and clear the aisle. They
allow him to sit in the Sixth Man sec
tion, even though he does not wear the
required shirt. Other Stanford students
are not given this treatment. If any of
them want to be in the Sixth Man sec
tion, they have to either wait until just
before game time to take the unclaimed
spots or wear a Sixth Man shirt.
I overheard him saying that he has
season tickets to a lot of Stanford sport
ing events, and that he occasionally
helps out the "security guards." Does
that mean the men and women who
clean the stadium should be allowed to
stand wherever they want at the expense
of Stanford students? This is another
problem I have with this man: He seems
to feel that it is his right to stand there,

and that he has some sort of authority
over other fans. He was frequently
ordering people to back up (due to the
newly enforced line that Sixth Man
members are not supposed to cross). He
even questioned why the ABC camera
man was standing in front of him.
If this man were not so annoying, with
all of his know-it-all comments and mis
taken sense of authority, I would not
have a problem with him. Yet he really
does ruin the game for the students who
want to have the best seats in the student
section, and, as a result, are forced to
stand by him. I'm sure his enthusiasm for
Stanford sports is appreciated by some,
however, he could just as well display that
enthusiasm on the other side of the court.
