# Intolerant Christians misrepresent religion
## 
### 
As a former dorm mate of Drew Rapp
and a recently converted Christian, I
find it my responsibility to respond to
yesterday's column. I admit that I can
not empathize with his mistreatment
from certain members of the Christian
community. However, I am troubled
that God has been held responsible for
the narrow-minded and un-Christ-like
conduct of some people who call them
selves followers of Jesus.
I agree with Drew wholeheartedly
that "the fundamental purpose of
humans (is) to learn to love." The behav
ior displayed by his youth leader and
pastor were not examples of love. It was
judgment and pride. It was them assum
ing that they were morally "above" gay
and lesbian individuals. I wonder if they
have ever stolen, or lied, or envied. If so,
they have indeed broken several of the
Ten Commandments given to them by

their God, and therefore have no right to
judge whether or not someone who is
gay has a "right" to be in their church.
Whether or not homosexuality is wrong
is not the issue. Rather, we should real
ize that we all have fallen short of God's
perfect moral standard, and that not one
of us deserves to "live in God's house,"
whether gay, straight, black, white,
atheistic or religious. It is only because
of God's mercy, which is needed by and
extended to all, that we can enter "his
house."
I find it extremely unfortunate that
representatives of my faith at Stanford,
as well as the larger society, have singled
out the gay community as an object of
contempt. Jesus did not come bearing a
message of hatred but rather one of love
and forgiveness. In fact, the only people
he rebuked were those who claimed to
follow God and yet did not abide by his
law of love. Perhaps if the Christians at
Stanford realized their own moral fail
ures, and did more loving and less con
demning, we could all begin to see thf
fruit of Jesus' original, uncorrupted

message of love and peace
