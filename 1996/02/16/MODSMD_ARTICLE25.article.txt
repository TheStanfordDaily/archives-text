# Legacy students are qualified, Montoya says
## 
### 
Nick Thompson's Wednesday column,
"An affirmative action baby," concludes
that the sons and daughters of Stanford
graduates enrolled at the University
would not have "gotten in here if it
weren't for their birthright."
Many of our most promising appli
cants and many of our most accom
plished Stanford students (including
Nick, a finalist for the Truman scholar
ship) are "legacies." Any "underquali
fied, unprepared legacies wandering
around this bucolic campus" are enrolled
elsewhere.
Every admitted applicant to the Uni
versity has earned her or his place,
including legacies.

Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
