# Allison Amend: The better part of valor
## Modern telecommunications à la Marcel Marceau 
### 
E-MAIL IS GOING to put Hallmark
out of business. When I care
enough to send the very best, I
simply log on and let my fingers do the
walking to get in touch. Hey, it even
works to Europe.
So, I've been getting these e-mail mes
sages from the cousin of a friend of a
friend of mine in Spain. I can just picture
them, crowded around the lone computer
in their little town in Cataluha, staring at
it as if at the television for the first time.
"And how do the keys know to put the
letters on the screen .. . ?"
This would be great, cross-cultural
sharing and all that, but for the fact it's
garbled. I mean, it's never that simple.
The first message transmitted in char
acter. Not Ghinese character, not Hebrew
or Hieroglyphics. Just weird symbols
that not even my secret decoder ring
could de-encrypt. "ZvRVFZBCiIS4 MR

hxYzMXRsO4T2UUJrFQ," it said.
And then I got that little message from
the guy that lives in the computer (distant
cousin to the guy that lives in the refrig
erator and turns off the light when you
close the door and brother of the guy who

appreciates the noise when a tree falls in
the forest and no one else is around). You
know him, the one who sends you 400
lines to tell you that you mistyped
"jesseo@leland" as "jesseo@lelcnd."
You'd think he'd be a bit more under
standing by now. I mean, if they're going
to hire this guy to do the sorting —
instead of just using a machine — a little
compassion now and again is the least you
should expect.
Anyway, he wrote me a love note to
the tune of "This message is sent in
MIME which this program cannot read."
OK. Let's examine this closer. I know
that Spain is fairly inefficient and behind
the times, but really, mime means without
words, so why in the world would you call
a word-processing program MIME unless
you wanted to seriously jinx yourself? And
don't tell me that they didn't know what it
means in Spain. They could have called me
to ask; my number's listed and I would
have been happy to explain it to them.
So of course I can't read it, it's in
MIME.
Message two is a bit more successful.
But someone needs to tell Luis — in
whose house I lived for three months and
to whom I spoke, in Spanish, daily — that
I read Spanish just as well in virtual real
ity as in real life. He doesn't need to write

me in English just because he's writing to
America.
"Well Allison, from Europe very
regards, from me Gosme, Guillem, Elisen
da and in special from Maria. Also we
desire the best wishes to Helen and fami
ly.* 8-) V I have no idea who Helen is. I
can only assume that she's another Amer
ican, and since we're both American, we
probably know each other. Also let us
examine those bizarre symbols at the end
of the message like the spittle of a partic
ularly aggressive speaker. Is this another
word "MIMEd" beyond recognition?
Later: "Ah, I remember now a letter
that Joana send you from his Universite,
and we wainting a respost if you did
received a letter from Universite, because
Joana want posted you from his school. If
you want, you can posted me a large let
ter in English and I respost you." And,
yes, these quotes are real.
Something is not getting through
here.
Messages No. 3 through No. 7: The pat
tern of talking about the weather is get
ting old, especially since the climate there
is strikingly similar to that of our own
Northern Galifornia abode. "So how's the
weather? It's cloudy and about 50 here."
"Weather's good. It's overcast, about 55,
lower up on that hill. How about you?"

"Weather's OK. It rained yesterday."
It's as if we don't trust the computer, and
must be forced to treat it like Audrey Hep
burn's visits to the jailed mobster in "Break
fast at Tiffany's." Shhh, snow in New
Orleans.... Ah, I know what that means.
So I break the pattern. I write a long
expose, revealing the intimate details of
my life. After that first line, I make some
more up. This is scandalous, this is rivet
ing, this is better than a harlequin
romance in a hot bubble-bath, this is —
— being read by a lot of people. It
turns out my nice pastoral image of
everyone crowding the computer was a
little provincial on my part. Apparently,
I've been sending mail to the communal
box on the IBM network. Yes, now every
high-level Spanish executive knows who I
brought home last weekend, and just how
big . . . never mind.
So I'll just write letters from now on.
After all, discretion is the better part of
valor. I'll address them carefully, try to
remember to mail them within a year after
I've written them. Never mind the fact
that I have illegible handwriting. Never
mind the fact it takes the Spanish mail
system 4 to 5 weeks to sort the mail,
assuming it gets there at all, since I've
been told four times that the boat carrying
my packages sunk in the Pacific, which is

suspect, since I thought air-mail meant it
would travel by air and the Atlantic is the
ocean between America and Europe.
Never mind the fact that it costs me 60
cents to send a letter and it costs them a
full dollar to reply. I just can't trust tech
nology for communication.
Which brings me to my larger point
(you knew it was coming, didn't ya?): that
of cross-cultural communication.
As the world gets smaller and smaller,
the distances between places made minute
by the information highway, language
assumes an even larger importance.
It becomes increasingly necessary,
therefore, to examine and identify the
issues behind language, and how language
functions (or breaks down) in a multicul
tural / multinational environment.
Let's borrow from literary theory
Roland Barthes' notion of the "word
leading the idea." A good concept, since, if
we can't understand the words, how in
hell are we supposed to understand the
larger picture. Our plaintive "why can't
we all just get along?" becomes a "why
can't we all just understand each other?"
Or maybe we should just forget words
altogether. Then we could all use MIME.

you want, you can posted me a large let

yes, these quotes are real.

here.
Messages No. 3 through No. 7: The pat
tern of talking about the weather is get
ting old, especially since the climate there
is strikingly similar to that of our own
Northern Galifornia abode. "So how's the
weather? It's cloudy and about 50 here."
"Weather's good. It's overcast, about 55,
lower up on that hill. How about you?"

"Weather's OK. It rained yesterday."
It's as if we don't trust the computer, and
must be forced to treat it like Audrey Hep
burn's visits to the jailed mobster in "Break
fast at Tiffany's." Shhh, snow in New
Orleans.... Ah, I know what that means.
So I break the pattern. I write a long
expose, revealing the intimate details of
my life. After that first line, I make some
more up. This is scandalous, this is rivet
ing, this is better than a harlequin
romance in a hot bubble-bath, this is —
— being read by a lot of people. It
turns out my nice pastoral image of
everyone crowding the computer was a
little provincial on my part. Apparently,
I've been sending mail to the communal
box on the IBM network. Yes, now every
high-level Spanish executive knows who I
brought home last weekend, and just how
big . . . never mind.
So I'll just write letters from now on.
After all, discretion is the better part of
valor. I'll address them carefully, try to
remember to mail them within a year after
I've written them. Never mind the fact
that I have illegible handwriting. Never
mind the fact it takes the Spanish mail
system 4 to 5 weeks to sort the mail,
assuming it gets there at all, since I've
been told four times that the boat carrying
my packages sunk in the Pacific, which is

suspect, since I thought air-mail meant it
would travel by air and the Atlantic is the
ocean between America and Europe.
Never mind the fact that it costs me 60
cents to send a letter and it costs them a
full dollar to reply. I just can't trust tech
nology for communication.
Which brings me to my larger point
(you knew it was coming, didn't ya?): that
of cross-cultural communication.
As the world gets smaller and smaller,
the distances between places made minute
by the information highway, language
assumes an even larger importance.
It becomes increasingly necessary,
therefore, to examine and identify the
issues behind language, and how language
functions (or breaks down) in a multicul
tural / multinational environment.
Let's borrow from literary theory
Roland Barthes' notion of the "word
leading the idea." A good concept, since, if
we can't understand the words, how in
hell are we supposed to understand the
larger picture. Our plaintive "why can't
we all just get along?" becomes a "why
can't we all just understand each other?"
Or maybe we should just forget words
altogether. Then we could all use MIME.

E-MAIL IS GOING to put Hallmark
out of business. When I care
enough to send the very best, I
simply log on and let my fingers do the
walking to get in touch. Hey, it even
works to Europe.
So, I've been getting these e-mail mes
sages from the cousin of a friend of a
friend of mine in Spain. I can just picture
them, crowded around the lone computer
in their little town in Cataluha, staring at
it as if at the television for the first time.
"And how do the keys know to put the
letters on the screen .. . ?"
This would be great, cross-cultural
sharing and all that, but for the fact it's
garbled. I mean, it's never that simple.
The first message transmitted in char
acter. Not Ghinese character, not Hebrew
or Hieroglyphics. Just weird symbols
that not even my secret decoder ring
could de-encrypt. "ZvRVFZBCiIS4 MR

maSHGbFXcPBMHcUi4OgCSNJkn9OJs
hxYzMXRsO4T2UUJrFQ," it said.
And then I got that little message from
the guy that lives in the computer (distant
cousin to the guy that lives in the refrig
erator and turns off the light when you
close the door and brother of the guy who

appreciates the noise when a tree falls in
the forest and no one else is around). You
know him, the one who sends you 400
lines to tell you that you mistyped
"jesseo@leland" as "jesseo@lelcnd."
You'd think he'd be a bit more under
standing by now. I mean, if they're going
to hire this guy to do the sorting —
instead of just using a machine — a little
compassion now and again is the least you
should expect.
Anyway, he wrote me a love note to
the tune of "This message is sent in
MIME which this program cannot read."
OK. Let's examine this closer. I know
that Spain is fairly inefficient and behind
the times, but really, mime means without
words, so why in the world would you call
a word-processing program MIME unless
you wanted to seriously jinx yourself? And
don't tell me that they didn't know what it
means in Spain. They could have called me
to ask; my number's listed and I would
have been happy to explain it to them.
So of course I can't read it, it's in
MIME.
Message two is a bit more successful.
But someone needs to tell Luis — in
whose house I lived for three months and
to whom I spoke, in Spanish, daily — that
I read Spanish just as well in virtual real
ity as in real life. He doesn't need to write

me in English just because he's writing to
America.
"Well Allison, from Europe very
regards, from me Gosme, Guillem, Elisen
da and in special from Maria. Also we
desire the best wishes to Helen and fami
ly.* 8-) V I have no idea who Helen is. I
can only assume that she's another Amer
ican, and since we're both American, we
probably know each other. Also let us
examine those bizarre symbols at the end
of the message like the spittle of a partic
ularly aggressive speaker. Is this another
word "MIMEd" beyond recognition?
Later: "Ah, I remember now a letter
that Joana send you from his Universite,
and we wainting a respost if you did
received a letter from Universite, because
Joana want posted you from his school. If
you want, you can posted me a large let
ter in English and I respost you." And,
yes, these quotes are real.
