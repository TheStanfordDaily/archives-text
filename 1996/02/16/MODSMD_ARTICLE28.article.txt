## Women roll in second half Cardinal thumps No. 15 OSU by 24 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
Stanford 86
Oregon State 62

When 5-foot-10 junior guard
Charmin Smith gets 11
rebounds, chances are the Stan
ford women's basketball squad
has chalked up another win.
Smith's career high, combined
with five Stanford players in dou
ble-figure scoring, helped give
No. 4 Stanford (19-2, 12-0 Pacific
10 Conference) a convincing 86-
62 victory over No. 15 Oregon
State (16-5, 8-4). After a first-half
struggle and a three-point lead at
intermission, sophomore center
Olympia Scott scored the first
nine points after the break to
send Stanford on its way to its
13th consecutive victory and 21st
straight conference win.
"I just think they were sur
prised we came out as strong as
we did," Scott said. "We put the
hammer down in the first five
minutes of the second half."
The 20-2 run to start the half
stretched the lead to an insur
mountable margin, although
Oregon State used a 14-2 spurt to
cut Stanford's biggest lead in half
to 70-58. But Stanford sank eight

Sophomore forward Vanessa Nygaard can't stretch quite far enough
to steal this rebound from Oregon State's Anjanette Dionne.
