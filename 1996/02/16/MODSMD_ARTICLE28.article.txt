## Women roll in second half Cardinal thumps No. 15 OSU by 24 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
Stanford 86
Oregon State 62

When 5-foot-10 junior guard
Charmin Smith gets 11
rebounds, chances are the Stan
ford women's basketball squad
has chalked up another win.
Smith's career high, combined
with five Stanford players in dou
ble-figure scoring, helped give
No. 4 Stanford (19-2, 12-0 Pacific
10 Conference) a convincing 86-
62 victory over No. 15 Oregon
State (16-5, 8-4). After a first-half
struggle and a three-point lead at
intermission, sophomore center
Olympia Scott scored the first
nine points after the break to
send Stanford on its way to its
13th consecutive victory and 21st
straight conference win.
"I just think they were sur
prised we came out as strong as
we did," Scott said. "We put the
hammer down in the first five
minutes of the second half."
The 20-2 run to start the half
stretched the lead to an insur
mountable margin, although
Oregon State used a 14-2 spurt to
cut Stanford's biggest lead in half
to 70-58. But Stanford sank eight

of its final nine free throws to
extend the final advantage back
to 24, its biggest win over the
Beavers in four years.
For the eighth time in 11 games,
junior forwjird Kate Starbird paced
the Cardinal with 20 points. After a
struggle in last Sunday's game at
UCLA, sophomore Naomi Muli
tauaopele contributed 13 points on
9-of-ll foul shooting off the bench
and sophomore forward Vanessa
Nygaard sank three from outside
en route to 17.
"I think we had great balance
tonight," said Cardinal head
coach Amy Tucker. "Kate had a
very good second half, and Naomi
played well in the first half and
got us going. Vanessa was very
consistent. We don't just count on
Kate and Vanessa to score."
On the other hand, the
Beavers continued to feed their
defending Pac-10 Player of the
Year Tanja Kostic. The Swedish
senior forward posted team highs
of 20 points and seven rebounds
but shot under 40 percent thanks
to aggressive post defense.
Nygaard never left Kostic to
help others, and the Cardinal
double-teamed with both small
forwards and centers. Most of

Stanford's season-high six swats
came at Kostic's expense, includ
ing a stufT by Smith in the early
stages. Despite the usual double
and triple-teaming, Kostic contin
ued her assault on the Pac-10
record books, climbing into fifth
place all-time in rebounding.
But Kostic couldn't control the
board battle alone. As in the Jan
uary matchup between the teams,
the Cardinal dominated the glass
with a 49-31 edge. After last Sun
day's disappointing 39-29 loss in
the rebounding column to UCLA,
Stanford made a concerted effort
to crash the boards and the
Beavers failed to box out Cardinal
players, especially guards.
"They probably talked a lot
about rebounding at halftime,
because they came out and just
rebounded the heck out of the
ball," said OSU first-year head
coach Judy Spoelstra.
The Cardinal will try for its
44th consecutive Pac-10 home
win tomorrow night at 7 p.m.
against streaking Oregon. The
Ducks (15-7, 7-5) have won seven
of eight to move into third place
in the Pac-10 after last night's 73-
54 triumph over last-place Cali
fornia (5-16, 1-11).
Although last night was the
first time in eight games a Cardi
nal opponent has managed 60
points against Stanford, Jody
Runge's squad, not Stanford,

still lends the conference in scor
ing defense. The Ducks hold
opponents to about 58 points per
game to place among the nation
al leaders. However, their
offense has struggled to score
much more than that, and Ore
gon managed just 42 points in a
19-point loss to Stanford in
Eugene on Jan. 18.
Senior center Renae Fegent,
the conference's most recent play
er of the week, leads the league in
blocked shots. Junior forward
Arianne Boyer is back in con
tention for All-Pac-10 honors
after a suspension early in the
conference season. Oregon's
backcourt remains the Ducks' pri
mary question mark.
The Ducks could greatly
enhance their chances to earn a
third-straight NCAA tournament
bid with a win. While the Cardinal
has almost certainly clinched the
Pac-10 crown, Stanford's final six
regular-season games also hold
tourney significance.
"Typically the West Coast gets
a little bit slighted in the polls,"
Tucker said. "Come seeding time,
you have to make a statement in
your conference play. We don't
have a tournament. If we would
lose a game in our conference,
we'd really get slammed in the
polls.
"They're really consumed with
being undefeated [in the Pac-10 ]."

gon managed just 42 points in a
19-point loss to Stanford in
Eugene on Jan. 18.
Senior center Renae Fegent,
the conference's most recent play
er of the week, leads the league in
blocked shots. Junior forward
Arianne Boyer is back in con
tention for All-Pac-10 honors
after a suspension early in the
conference season. Oregon's
backcourt remains the Ducks' pri
mary question mark.
The Ducks could greatly
enhance their chances to earn a
third-straight NCAA tournament
bid with a win. While the Cardinal
has almost certainly clinched the
Pac-10 crown, Stanford's final six
regular-season games also hold
tourney significance.
"Typically the West Coast gets
a little bit slighted in the polls,"
Tucker said. "Come seeding time,
you have to make a statement in
your conference play. We don't
have a tournament. If we would
lose a game in our conference,
we'd really get slammed in the
polls.
"They're really consumed with
being undefeated [in the Pac-10 ]."
