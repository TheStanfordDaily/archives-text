# With Hinch questionable, Cardinal must find other ways to score
## No. 2 baseball heads to Fresno 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
This weekend's three-game series with Fres
no State and a Monday night game against
Washington State will serve as a final tune-up
for the second-ranked Stanford baseball team
before it sinks its teeth into a challenging Pacif
ic 10 Southern Division schedule next Friday.
Stanford (7-4) will spend the weekend in
Fresno, facing off against the Bulldogs (4-6) at
Beiden Field. Fresno State is the defending
Western Athletic Conference West Division
champion after posting a 41-22 overall record
last season, 20-10 in league play. Last year, the
Bulldogs took two of three from Stanford at
Sunken Diamond, including a 6-0 blanking in
game two.
Cardinal sophomore Kyle Peterson (2-1) will
take the mound tonight in hopes of helping
Stanford avenge last year's losses. The team
will also look to bounce back from two frustrat
ing defeats at the hands of Santa Clara and San
Francisco on Sunday and Tuesday, respectively.
Peterson, who had a rough outing in the season
opener at Hawaii, has been superb his last two
times out. The right hander has a 4.12 earned
run average in 19-2/3 innings pitched.
"I think we are in good shape," Peterson
said. "We had a couple of tough losses — we

and Washington State over the long weekend.
thought we could have won that
game on Tuesday fa 6-3 loss at
San Francisco]. But we had a
good practice yesterday and we're
ready to go."
Peterson stressed the signifi
cance of this series in Fresno as
preparation for the Pac-10 South
ern Division — better known as
the Six-Pac — season.
"This series is very important
for us," Peterson said. "We'd like
to go in and take at least two of
three ... a sweep would be great.
We open the Six-Pac down at
UCLA next weekend and they've
been playing really well."
Peterson leads a Cardinal
pitching staff which has been out
standing thus far in 1996, holding

opponents to a collective batting
average of .218 (75-for-344).
"We're excited with how things
have gone so far, but we know we
can do better," Peterson said.
"It's still early in the year and
everyone has things they can
improve on."
The Stanford lineup would
like to improve on its offensive
output in the last two games.
Against Santa Clara, the Cardi
nal produced just one run on six
hits in a 2-1 defeat. Facing the
Dons on Tuesday, Stanford
managed just three runs on five
hits and was retired in order
from the third through the
eighth innings.
The Cardinal may have to snap
out of its hitting woes without
one of its senior leaders, however,
as catcher A.J. Hinch is not listed
in the probable starting lineup for
tonight's contest. Hinch has been

sidelined since sustaining a shoul
der injury in Saturday's 11-1 vic
tory over the Broncos. Hinch
leads the team in five offensive
categories — batting average
(.412), runs (12), home runs (3),
RBIs (9) and stolen bases (9).
Sophomore Jon Schaeffer,
Hinch's replacement behind the
plate, has provided his own offen
sive punch for the Cardinal, hit
ting .381 with one home run and
six doubles. Schaeffer is tied with
Hinch with nine RBI and is bat
ting .412 with runners in scoring
position.
Monday night, Stanford will
host defending Pac-10 Northern
Division champion Washington
State in a rare 5 p.m. start at
Sunken Diamond. The Cougars
currently possess a 5-5 record
heading into a weekend set at
Pacific. The two teams did not
face each other in 1995.
