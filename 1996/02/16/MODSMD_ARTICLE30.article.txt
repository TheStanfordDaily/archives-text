# Swimmers' last tuneup
## Men will face Cal in regular-season finale 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
After more than four months
of competition, the regular sea
son will come to a close tomor
row afternoon for the Stanford
men's swimming team when it
meets California in a dual meet
at deGuerre Pool.
The Bears, who had lofty
ambitions at the beginning of
the year — when they were
ranked above USC — have not
succeeded in living up to expec
tations this season. The excite
ment tomorrow, however, will
come not from the competition,

but more so from the emotion
surrounding the seniors' last
home dual meet.
"It's very emotional," said
senior Scott Gagner. "It's a last
hurrah in deGuerre Pool. For a
lot of us, it's been a long, won
derful four years. We've had a
lot of great memories and big
victories."
The main focus for the Stan
ford swimmers this weekend
will be to complete the fine-tun
ing needed for the upcoming
championship meets in March.
While some of the swimmers
will travel to the Olympic Trials
in Indianapolis on March 6-12,
the rest of the team will compete
in the Pacific 10 Conference Invi
tational on March 3-5. The Cardi
nal swimmers expect to finish the
weekend with all of their tech
nique down, prepared to focus on
nothing but racing.
"We're just looking for a com
plete race plan," said junior Kevin
Radvany. "The times don't have
to be there, but the technique has
to be down."
With only the early March
championship meets and the
NCAA championships March 28-
31 remaining on the schedule, the
swimmers will use Saturday's
meet as the last step to perfection.
"It's a last-chance rehearsal to
work out race strategies and fine
tune race work," Gagner said.
"It's a chance to make sure you
know how you want to set your
self up for the championship

meets."
Added junior Scott Jones: "You
don't want to go into a champi
onship meet and have to worry
about the little things. You want
to be able to just go in and think
about racing fast."
The emotion of the last meet
often provides a boost for the
seniors to come up big. This year,
senior Ray Carey, who has been
putting up some incredible times
in the 200 butterfly, will face the
Bears' Ugur Tanner, a two-time
NCAA champion. With the com
petition, the atmosphere and his
success so far this year, all factors
point to an exceptional perfor
mance by Carey.
"There will be an introduction
ceremony for the seniors," Jones
said. "A bunch of parents are
coming out this weekend. It's
been a tradition to have some
great swims out of the seniors in
their last meet."
One element that usually
comes into play in the final meets
of the season — the point when
the freshmen stop being fresh
men — is moot this vear, as the

younger swimmers began this
Olympic year with the Pac-10
Championships. They have
already shown that they're ready
for the big time.
"They've come into their own
already," Gagner said. "They're
fully integrated into the team.
For the most part we don't con
sider them freshmen."
Added Jones: "When we had
Pac-lOs early we already put them
into a hard place. They've already
proven themselves in our minds."
The last meet of the year also
serves a psychological purpose,
providing a mental boost for the
swimmers as they slowly gain
confidence for the champi
onships.
"It's really a confidence boost
er to have a great swim unshaved
going into the big meets," Jones
said. "We've got to approach this
meet thinking about what's
ahead."
"It's a springboard into the
championship season," Gagner
said. "It's a means of getting your
excitement ready for the month
to come."
