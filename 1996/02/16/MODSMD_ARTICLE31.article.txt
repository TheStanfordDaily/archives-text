# Gymnasts at No. 2 Georgia

After a three-week hiatus, the
13th-ranked Stanford women's
gymnastics team returns to
action this weekend when the
Cardinal travels to Athens, Ga.
for a non-conference matchup
with second-ranked Georgia.
The Cardinal (1-2 overall)
hopes to bounce back from two
close losses to Pacific 10 Confer
ence rivals UCLA and Arizona in
a Jan. 27 meet. That contest came
down to the very last event, with
Arizona's Wildcats edging out
both the Bruins and Stanford.
Tomorrow in Georgia, Stan
ford will rely on its strong spirit
and a rigorous three-week train

ing program in its attempt to
upend the perennial powerhouse
Bulldogs.
"This is our first-ever competi
tion against Georgia and we are
going in planning to be success
ful," said co-captain Ariel Pas
sanisi.
Head coach Lisa Izzi has been
riding her team hard over the
past couple of weeks, helping the
women to develop new routines in
hopes of improving on their last
two performances.
"Izzi has had us working on
new skills in our routines to
increase the overall difficulty of
our performances," Passanisi
said.
