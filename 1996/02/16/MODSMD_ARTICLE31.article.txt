# Gymnasts at No. 2 Georgia
## 
### Keith Rabkin Contributing writer 
After a three-week hiatus, the
13th-ranked Stanford women's
gymnastics team returns to
action this weekend when the
Cardinal travels to Athens, Ga.
for a non-conference matchup
with second-ranked Georgia.
The Cardinal (1-2 overall)
hopes to bounce back from two
close losses to Pacific 10 Confer
ence rivals UCLA and Arizona in
a Jan. 27 meet. That contest came
down to the very last event, with
Arizona's Wildcats edging out
both the Bruins and Stanford.
Tomorrow in Georgia, Stan
ford will rely on its strong spirit
and a rigorous three-week train

ing program in its attempt to
upend the perennial powerhouse
Bulldogs.
"This is our first-ever competi
tion against Georgia and we are
going in planning to be success
ful," said co-captain Ariel Pas
sanisi.
Head coach Lisa Izzi has been
riding her team hard over the
past couple of weeks, helping the
women to develop new routines in
hopes of improving on their last
two performances.
"Izzi has had us working on
new skills in our routines to
increase the overall difficulty of
our performances," Passanisi
said.
In the meantime, Georgia
head coach Suzanne Yoculan will
have her squad charged up for
tomorrow's meet. After finishing
first in the Southeastern Confer
ence and fifth in the nation last
year, Yoculan is counting on an
even higher finish from her team
in 1996.
The Bulldogs are 8-0 thus far

and are determined not to let
Stanford ruin their perfect
record.
Before Georgia can chalk up
another win, however, it will
have to deal with Stanford fresh
man Amy Murakami.
Murakami has performed
spectacularly this season, win
ning the bars at the Arizona
meet with a score of 9.850 and
taking the vault against UC-
Davis with a 9.775. Against
Georgia, Murakami will try out
new routines on the beam and

floor exercises as she competes in
the all-around for the first time.
Stanford's sophomores must
step up their performances as
well if they hope to defeat the
Bulldogs.
Keri Monahan, the Cardinal's
top scorer this season, will try to
repeat her individual wins on the
beam and vault at the Tuscon
meet. Monahan finished third in
the all-around against the Wild
cats and Bruins.
The team also expects sopho
more Misty Moore to help in the
floor exercise after placing third
in the event at Arizona. Moore's
consistent performance has
placed her among Stanford's top

three performers this season.
Sophomores Christie Jones and
Amy Neil, meanwhile, will con
tribute on the vault.
Tracey Kohl, another fresh
man, has been Stanford's sec
ond-best all-around performer
this season.
Her strong performances in
all events have made her an inte
gral part of the team.
The team will count on Kohl
to help capture the floor and
uneven bars, while fellow fresh
man Katie Fitzpatrick will help
the Cardinal on the beam.
Finally, senior co-captain
Linda Chun will be expected to
provide leadership for this young
team against a difficult oppo
nent.
"We have a good balance,"
Passanisi said. "Our freshmen
are powerful performers and
enthusiastic, while our upper
classmen have experience and
skill."
For the Cardinal to win the
meet, it will have to place first in
some events which it failed to
win in Arizona.
If Stanford can capture two
events and remain competitive in
the other two, it just may be able
to upset Yoculan and her Bull
dogs.
