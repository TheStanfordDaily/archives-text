# OSU's slow-down tactics can't stop Cardinal men

Stanford 65

Gill Coliseum was truly a
house of pain last night as No.
20 Stanford put the clamps on
an already anemic Oregon
State offense to defeat the
Beavers 65-50 in front of an
announced crowd of 4,485.
The pain continued after
the game as the Cardinal
coaches and players watched
Arizona miss two free throws
and a lay-up in the final sec
onds, allowing UCLA to
remain one game ahead of
Stanford in the Pacific 10 Con
ference race.
"We accomplished what we
came here for — we got the
win," head coach Mike Mont

gomery said. "We didn't play
great, but we did defend and
we kept them from scoring."
After trading baskets to
open the second half, the Car
dinal (16-5 overall, 9-3 Pac-10)
kept the Beavers (3-18, 1-11)
scoreless over an eight-minute,
53-second stretch. Stanford
scored 15 during the Beaver
drought, pushing the score to
44-21 and ending any thoughts
of an Oregon State upset.
During that stretch, the
Beavers missed nine straight
shots and committed six
turnovers. Two wide-open
three-pointers by senior David
Harbour helped Stanford put
the game out of reach.
To the Beavers' credit, they
worked their slow-down sys
tem well enough to hold Stan
ford to only 27 first-half
points. However, that system
also limited Oregon State on
offense as they shot only 34.6
percent for the game.
"I thought we kept our com

posure pretty well," Mont
gomery said. "Their aggres
siveness to the ball caused us
some problems."
The Cardinal had an
uncharacteristic 11 first-half
turnovers but took care of the
ball in the second half, ending
the game with 16 miscues.
"If this was earlier in the
season, it would have been
tough for us, but now we know
how to win," said junior Brevin
Knight.
Oregon State turned the ball
over 20 times but Stanford was
unable to capitalize in transi
tion, netting only six points off
Beaver mistakes.
Knight led Stanford with 15
points. Senior Andy Poppink
scored 13 points and grabbed
nine rebounds. No player on
Stanford played more than
Poppink's 31 minutes as the
bench chipped in 17 points.
Oregon State's Sonnv Ben
jamin scored 15 and walk-on Jeff
Riggs scored 14, all in the second
half with the game already decided.
Stanford thought the win might
move them into a first-place tie
with UCLA. Arizona led UCIA for
the first 38 minutes of the game
but the Bruins surged back to win
76-75.
Wildcat Miles Simon missed two
free throws after a technical foul
called against the Bruins for hav
ing six players on the court. Ari
zona then missed the shot on the
subsequent possession. Kris John
son sunk one of two free throws
with one second left after a phan
tom over-the-back foul against Ari
zona's Joe McLean.
"It doesn't make a difference if
we're in first place tomorrow,"
head coach Mike Montgomery said
before the Bruin-Wildcat game
ended. "It makes a difference if we
are in first place at the end of the
season."
The Cardinal gets a change of
pace as it ventures to Mac Arthur
Court for a 4 p.m. tip-off against
Oregon (12-11, 5-7) Saturday.
Unlike Oregon State's slow-down
tactics, the Ducks like to push the
tempo with their motion offense
and Mac Court is always a tough
place to play for Stanford.
"Oregon'll be ready and their
fans'll be ready," Knight said. The
Ducks defeated California at home
last night, 60-58.
No team in the Pac-10 has made
or attempted more three-pointers
than the Ducks, hitting at a 36 per
cent clip. Junior Jamal Lawrence
and freshman Terik Brown lead
the long-range quack attack, as
each has taken more than 140
three-point shots.
After making the tournament
last year for the first time since
1961, the Ducks have fallen back
into the middle of the Pac-10 race.
Ranked between fourth and eighth
in all 12 statistical categories, Ore
gon hopes the Mac Court advan
tage will make up for losing eight
seniors from last year's 19-9 squad.
Last month, Stanford topped
the Ducks 94-74 behind 30 points
from Knight.
