# OSU's slow-down tactics can't stop Cardinal men

Stanford 65

Gill Coliseum was truly a
house of pain last night as No.
20 Stanford put the clamps on
an already anemic Oregon
State offense to defeat the
Beavers 65-50 in front of an
announced crowd of 4,485.
The pain continued after
the game as the Cardinal
coaches and players watched
Arizona miss two free throws
and a lay-up in the final sec
onds, allowing UCLA to
remain one game ahead of
Stanford in the Pacific 10 Con
ference race.
"We accomplished what we
came here for â€” we got the
win," head coach Mike Mont

gomery said. "We didn't play
great, but we did defend and
we kept them from scoring."
After trading baskets to
open the second half, the Car
dinal (16-5 overall, 9-3 Pac-10)
kept the Beavers (3-18, 1-11)
scoreless over an eight-minute,
53-second stretch. Stanford
scored 15 during the Beaver
drought, pushing the score to
44-21 and ending any thoughts
of an Oregon State upset.
During that stretch, the
Beavers missed nine straight
shots and committed six
turnovers. Two wide-open
three-pointers by senior David
Harbour helped Stanford put
the game out of reach.
To the Beavers' credit, they
worked their slow-down sys
tem well enough to hold Stan
ford to only 27 first-half
points. However, that system
also limited Oregon State on
offense as they shot only 34.6
percent for the game.
"I thought we kept our com

posure pretty well," Mont
gomery said. "Their aggres
siveness to the ball caused us
some problems."
The Cardinal had an
uncharacteristic 11 first-half
turnovers but took care of the
ball in the second half, ending
the game with 16 miscues.
"If this was earlier in the
season, it would have been
tough for us, but now we know
how to win," said junior Brevin
Knight.
Oregon State turned the ball
over 20 times but Stanford was
unable to capitalize in transi
tion, netting only six points off
Beaver mistakes.
Knight led Stanford with 15
points. Senior Andy Poppink
scored 13 points and grabbed
nine rebounds. No player on
Stanford played more than
Poppink's 31 minutes as the
bench chipped in 17 points.
