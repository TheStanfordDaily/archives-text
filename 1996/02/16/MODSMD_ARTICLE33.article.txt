# Netters to duel with 'Zonas
## Third-ranked women's tennis will clash with Wildcats, ASU 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The third-ranked Stanford women's tennis team
returns to Pacific 10 Conference action this weekend
with dual meets against Arizona and Arizona State.
The Cardinal (6-0 overall, 1-0 Pac-10) faces the Ari
zona Wildcats today at 1:30 p.m., then returns to the
Varsity Tennis Courts tomorrow at noon for a meet
ing with the Sun Devils.
The lOth-ranked Wildcats (6-0, 2-0) have played
well all season, defeating both No. 11 USC and No. 7
UCLA, and should prove to be Stanford's toughest
competition of the season thus far. Leading the way
for Arizona is the talented Vicky Maes. Maes ranks
sixth in the nation and has already compiled a 26-5
singles record on the year.
In the Wildcat's match against UCLA earlier this
season, Maes defeated third-ranked Keri Phebus 6-
7, 7-5, 6-1. Today, Maes will be matched up against
Stanford junior Ania Bleszynski. The two have not
faced each other this year, but Stanford and Arizona
both got the chance to see players from the opposing
squad at the Pac-10 Indoor Championships in Jan
uary, where both Bleszynski and Maes lost to Phe
bus (Bleszynski 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 in the semifinals, Maes
6-3, 7-5 in the final).
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan, who consid
ers Arizona one of the top two teams in the Pac-10
and possibly one of the top five in the nation, is a lit
tle anxious about today's match.
"I'm real nervous," Brennan said. "Arizona is
really good. It'll be our first big test — we're going to
have a war."
Once the war with the Wildcats is over, the Cardinal
must gear up for the Sun Devils. ASU sports an unde
feated non-conference record of 3-0, but the women
have not faired as well in the Pac-10, losing matches to
both USC and UCIiA to post an overall record of 3-2.

Arizona State is currently ranked 14th in the
nation and boasts the 33rd best player in the coun
try in Reka Cseresnyes. Cseresnyes is 10-3 on the
season with a 1-1 Pac-10 record. At the Pac-10
Indoors she faced Stanford junior Katie Schlukebir
in the quarterfinals and won a grueling three-set
match 5-7, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (3) before falling to Maes 6-3,
6-2 in the semifinals. However, a rematch is not in
the works, as Cseresnyes is slated to face Bleszynski
rather than Schlukebir in tomorrow's match.
Brennan hopes that a successful performance by
his team today will carry over into tomorrow's com
petition. He expects a tougher time from Arizona
and will concentrate on that match first.
"We have to focus on this match," Brennan said.
"Arizona State will be the weaker of the two. We'll
try to get it going on Friday and see what happens."
