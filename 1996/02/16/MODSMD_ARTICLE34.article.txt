# Volleyball home for the weekend again
## No. 5 Cardinal will square off against 10th-ranked BYU, No. 13 UC-Irvine 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
After an exhilarating win last
Saturday night over USC, the
fifth-ranked Stanford men's vol
leyball team returns to Burnham
Pavilion this weekend with two
key matches against ranked
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion rivals. Tonight at 7 p.m., the
Cardinal squares off against
tenth-ranked Brigham Young,
followed by a 5 p.m. showdown
tomorrow versus No. 13 UC-
Irvine.
The Cardinal spikers, 4-1 in
MPSF play, will be looking to
maintain their second-place
standing in the Pacific Division.
Stanford would also like to
avenge three defeats at the
hands of BYU in 1995, including
a five-game heartbreaker at
Burnham last spring that
knocked Stanford out of the
MPSF tournament.
"They don't forget very easi
ly," said Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves. "It's not revenge,
but we want to win. Last year is
over and done. We have control
of how this match affects our
season."
BYU has gotten off to a 4-2
start in league play this year
despite the loss of eight players
to graduation or Mormon mis
sion. The Cougars have been able
to reload with the help of two
hot-shot freshmen.
"Just because they lost eight

players doesn't mean they're not
good," Nieves said. "We would be
mistaken to put much emphasis
on the fact that they have new
players."
One of the newcomers is
Oswald Antonetti, a freshman
from San Juan, Puerto Rico who
leads the Cougar attack with 111
kills in 25 games, good for a .272
hitting percentage. Freshman
middle blocker Ryan Millar has
also played an important role,
racking up 91 kills thus far this
season.
"[Millar! is going to be a very,
very good collegiate player," said
Nieves, who coached Millar on
the Junior National team.
The Anteaters of UC-Irvine
sport a 6-5 overall record, but
only a 2-5 mark in league play.
"That points out how highly
regarded our league is," said
Nieves of the fact that Irvine is
still ranked No. 13.
Irvine may not have the most
sterling record, but the
Anteaters' hitting attack has
been anything but sub-par this
season. Sophomore middle block
er Chris Harger leads the team in
kills with 165 while hitting at a
.378 clip. Junior transfer John
Habben and freshman Mike
Rupp carry the rest of the hitting
load with 137 and 111 kills,
respectively. The offense is run
by freshman setter Cory Hinkle
from Los Gatos, Calif.

Sophomore Devin Poolman hits against USC last Saturday. The
Cardinal overcame a two-game deficit to beat the Trojans.
Stanford enters this week
end's play with a 5-1 overall
record, with the Cardinal's
impressive lineup continuing to
put up strong numbers. Junior
opposite hitter Matt Fuerbringer
and senior middle blocker Brian
Moore lead the offensive attack
with 96 and 95 kills respectively.
Sophomore middle blocker
Keenan Whitehurst leads the
team in hitting percentage with a
.354 clip. Whitehurst is also aver
aging nearly two blocks per game,
good for fifth in the nation.
There is some bad news for
the Cardinal, however: junior
swing hitter Aaron Garcia, who
had a remarkable game against
the USC Trojans, registering 15
kills and 18 digs, will be unavail
able due to a groin injury.
Sophomore opposite Jeff Ben
der on the other band, will be
reads 10 play tomorrow after
misainj several matches with a
bad back.
"I think we're better than
these teams and we could go 2-
0," Nievcs said. "But we have to
nrove it. on t,he courf "
