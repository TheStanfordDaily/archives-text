# Wrestlers face Oregon State
## Cardinal will battle Beavers in last dual meet of the season 
### Karim Fahkry Contributing writer 
Coming off a solid weekend
highlighted by two major indi
vidual victories, the Stanford
wrestlers are set to go after Ore
gon State tomorrow night in
their last dual meet of the season
before the all-important Pacific
10 Conference Championships
on March 2 and 3. The Cardinal
faces off against the Beavers,
2nd-place finishers at last year's
NCAA championships, at 7 p.m.
in Burnham Pavilion.
Stanford (5-5) heads into this
weekend's dual meet with
abounding confidence, thanks to
last weekend's thorough 28-23
defeat of Pacific (0-7).
Just as impressive was the
Cardinal's strong performance
at Oregon (6-4-1). Senior cap
tain Tod Surmon jumped up to
the 150-pound weight class to
avenge last year's loss to Ore
gon's Scott Norton in the Pac-10
finals. Norton is ranked third in
the nation in his weight class,
making Surmon's victory all the
more significant.
Senior Matt Cano (126
pounds) pulled off an equally
impressive victory on Sunday
afternoon, defeating Oregon's
John Taylor by a final count of

8-3. Cano had lost at the hands
of Taylor earlier in the season.
Despite these two brilliant per
formances, however, the final
team score read 26-12 in favor of
Oregon, adding another tally to
Stanford's loss column. Satur
day's meet will determine
whether or not the team finish
es above .500. On the bright
side, the Cardinal's dual-meet
record means virtually nothing
with respect to the Pac-10 and
NCAA championships.
Surmon, like the rest of his
teammates, looks on the perfor
mance at Oregon in a positive
light. He believes that the team
is reaching its peak just in time
for the big tournaments at sea
son's end, having previously
noted that the Cardinal is now
the team "that was talked about
at the beginning of the season."
The Cardinal will be rejoined
by 17-year head coach Chris
Horpel. Horpel has been away
from the team for the past two
weeks spending time with the
family of slain Olympic wrestler
Dave Schultz, a former Stanford
assistant and a close friend of
Horpel. In his absence, assistant
coach Jay Jackson — a Stanford
wrestling star who graduated
last year — has taken over the
reins. Horpel, trying to make

sure everything is in order, was
unavailable for comment.
The starting lineup this
weekend will most likely be the
same one Stanford fielded at
Oregon. The Cardinal, as it has
done much of the season, will
forfeit the match in the 110-
pound weight bracket. Cano will
be slated to start in the 126-
pound position, and senior co
captain Jimmy Aguirre will go
at 134 pounds. Surmon will take
on Oregon State's 142-pound
wrestler, sophomore Doug Bard
sley will look to register a victo
ry in the 150-pound weight
class, and senior team leader
Sahlan Martin will try to pin his
158-pound Oregon State oppo
nent as he did Oregon's Lee
Brockett.
In the meantime, Cardinal
sophomore Jeff Grant will try to
make up for last weekend's loss
when he takes on the Beavers'
167-pounder. Junior Matt Von
Der Ahe will wrestle in the 177-
pound position for his team
against defending NCAA cham
pion Les Gutches (one of the top
wrestlers in the United States),
junior Bryan Vaniman will fill
the 190-pound slot, and heavy
weight junior Mark Neglay will
see what Oregon State has to
offer in his weight class.
