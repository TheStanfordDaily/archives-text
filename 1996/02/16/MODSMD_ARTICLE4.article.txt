# Students recall Americorps experiences
## 
### Mary Megan Peer 
For Lisa Dawe, Americorps began
with a bang. Actually, it was more of a
crash.
As the Stanford senior stood on the
White House lawn the day before the
opening ceremonies for the program in

fall 1994, a plane crashed into the presi
dent's home. Immediately, FBI agents
swarmed the back lawn and the re
hearsal was canceled.
Luckily, the plane crash was only a
minor setback in the short life of this
community-focused project.
And Dawe has been a part of the pro

ject since the beginning. As one of 10
campus representatives for Americorps
in the nation, she is bringing the concept
and challenge of Americorps to Stan
ford.
Dawe said that for her, Americorps is
the answer to a question posed by Eng
lish Prof. Ramon Saldivar in lecture one
day. "What are you ng people doing today
on a mass level in national service?"
Saldivar asked.
Often considered the domestic Peace
Corps, Americorps is a private / public
partnership which involves more than
20,000 young Americans in intensive pe
riods of service to the community. For
one year of full-time service, partici
pants receive a $4,725 grant to pay for
further education or to pay back college
loans. They also receive a stipend for liv
ing expenses.
"The 20,000 Americorps members
working on community problems paral
lel the Civil Rights movement in many
ways," said Dawe, who is coterming in
sociology.
According to Dawe, Americorps fo
cuses on serving four problem areas in
the United States: public safety, unmet
human needs, education and environ
ment. Americorps members can be in
volved with anything from crime pre
vention to restoring urban environ
ments, from elderly health issues to
school success among junior high stu
dents, said Dawe.
Dawe first became involved in the pro-

gram in the fall of 1994 when she
was at the Stanford in Washington
program. She interned at the Cor
poration for National Service
where, she said, "Americorps really
came alive to me, even through the
administration. People at the cor
poration had total faith I could do
whatever I set my mind to, which is
the general spirit of Americorps
throughout the nation."
Dawe said many people have
heard of Americorps only as one
of the programs that is being cut
by Congress. In truth, Dawe said,
Americorps has experienced
strong bi-partisan support and is
the product of more than one
party's administration. Dawe
said she does not believe the pro
gram will be cut any time soon.
Dawe's enthusiasm for Ameri
corps was echoed two weeks ago
by a panel of program partici
pants, three of whom were recent
Stanford graduates. The gradu
ates spoke about the differences
they were making in Bay Area
communities as members of dif
ferent components of Americorps.
Stewart Richardson, Class of
*95, has been working since Sep
tember as a member of City Year
San Jose. He spends four days a
week as a teacher's aid in a third
and fourth-grade classroom,
helping beginning readers, run
ning the homework club and just
being a friend.
His days begin at 8 a.m. when
he is required to participate in
calisthenics in a public park.
"You overcome inhibitions of
wearing a uniform and doing
jumping jacks in the middle of the
city real fast," Richardson said.
Jessica Morse, Class of '95, is a
VISTA volunteer who works in
conjunction with the Sacramento

Employment & Training Agency
on an infant immunization pro
ject for young children. Unlike
City Year, VISTA is a very indi
vidual-based program, said
Morse. Participants work on
building infrastructures in low
income communities.
Morse is working to increase
the number of infants who have
received the necessary immuniza
tions in an area with very low sta
tistics for infant immunizations.
She is one of 40 VISTA members
in California working on similar
projects in different areas. She
has a coordinator whom she can
ask for help, but in many ways she
is on her own, she said.
"I'm the only one working on
it, covering the whole county. I
have complete freedom, within
reasonable boundaries, to do this
project however I want, because
without me it won't happen,"
Morse said.
Josh Golumb, who also gradu
ated last June, also talked about
his Americorps experience.
Golumb works in the Partners in
School Education program in the
San Mateo-Foster City School
District.
Golumb said the project oper
ates at schools in low-income and
ethnic minority areas which have
a clear goal of where they want to
be in three to five years. The vol
unteers help the administration
to reach these goals, working on
everything from one-on-one tu
toring to building a new ideology
within the school.
Though all of these volunteers
stayed in the Stanford area,
Americorps is a nationwide pro
gram, according to Dawe, and vol
unteers can choose to be placed
almost anywhere. Part of the
strength of the program is its di
versity in location, in programs
and in participants, about half of
whom come from lower-income
families.
