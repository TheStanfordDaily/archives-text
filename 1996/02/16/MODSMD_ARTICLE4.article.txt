# Students recall Americorps experiences

For Lisa Dawe, Americorps began
with a bang. Actually, it was more of a
crash.
As the Stanford senior stood on the
White House lawn the day before the
opening ceremonies for the program in

fall 1994, a plane crashed into the presi
dent's home. Immediately, FBI agents
swarmed the back lawn and the re
hearsal was canceled.
Luckily, the plane crash was only a
minor setback in the short life of this
community-focused project.
And Dawe has been a part of the pro

campus representatives for Americorps
in the nation, she is bringing the concept

Dawe said that for her, Americorps is
the answer to a question posed by Eng

day. "What are you ng people doing today

Saldivar asked.
Often considered the domestic Peace
Corps, Americorps is a private / public
partnership which involves more than
20,000 young Americans in intensive pe
riods of service to the community. For
one year of full-time service, partici
pants receive a $4,725 grant to pay for
further education or to pay back college
loans. They also receive a stipend for liv
ing expenses.
"The 20,000 Americorps members
working on community problems paral
lel the Civil Rights movement in many
ways," said Dawe, who is coterming in
sociology.
According to Dawe, Americorps fo
cuses on serving four problem areas in
the United States: public safety, unmet
human needs, education and environ
ment. Americorps members can be in
volved with anything from crime pre
vention to restoring urban environ
ments, from elderly health issues to
school success among junior high stu
dents, said Dawe.
Dawe first became involved in the pro-
