### Prithika Balakrishnan Contributing writer 
Stanford Police filed charges
yesterday against Concepcion
Scott, the 19-year-old man who al
legedly injured himself and anoth
er man during a weekend sorority
fund-raiser.
Scott is charged with two
felony counts — possession of
firearms on a university campus
and possession of stolen property
— in connection with the firing of
a gun at a Delta Sigma Theta
sorority event in Tresidder Union
Saturday night.
According to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington, a war
rant should he issued today, to be
served by Stanford Police as soon
as Scott has undergone surgery.
Scott is awaiting surgery this
weekend for hand injuries sus
tained during the shooting; on
Monday, he will likely be placed
under arrest, Herrington said.
"The case will go forward from
there," said Herrington, indicat
ing that the police saw no impedi
ments to an arraignment.
Scott, a De Anza College stu

dent from San Jose, admitted to
the shooting at the event during
questioning earlier this week, said
Herrington. Scott told the police
the bullet discharged accidentally

just after 11 p.m.
Saturday, injur
ing Scott in the
hand and another
19-year-old man
in the leg.
Both were
treated for in
juries at Stanford
Hospital and re
leased early Sun
day morning.

Stanford investigators found the
weapon allegedly used by Scott
during a search of his residence.
It is a violation of Stanford pol
icy and California law to carry
firearms on campus without writ
ten permission from the Depart
ment of Public Safety.
A University investigation of
the incident is under way and
may possibly result in changes to
University policy concerning
events sponsored by student or
