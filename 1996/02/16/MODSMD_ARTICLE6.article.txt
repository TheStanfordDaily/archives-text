# Changes focus on day-to-day business
## University to trim administrative fat 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
As part of a continuing effort to
trim expenses, the University is
seeking to streamline the way it
does business on a day-to-day
basis.
Through a series of projects
that aim to restructure adminis
trative processes throughout the
University, administrators hope to
cut costs, improve service and con
struct "a more stable platform
from which to do business,"
Change Support Team Director
Curt McGee said.
The Change Support Team was
formed to coordinate projects
under the guidance of the Restruc
turing Administrative Systems
Oversight Group, a committee ap
proved two years ago by the Board
of Trustees.
Twenty-two projects have been
proposed to the group since the

streamlining began, 10 of which
are now underway, McGee said.
The largest of these is the Core Fi
nancials Program, a multi-tiered
project that includes looking at
purchasing and accounts payable,
the budget, general ledger replace
ment, capital assets management
and project accounting.
"This has to ultimately benefit
students and faculty," McGee said.
He cited as examples of increased
efficiency a faster turnaround time
in obtaining a parking permit or a
reimbursement.
Geoffrey Cox, vice provost for
institutional planning and over
sight group member, described the
process as simplifying already ex
isting systems.
"Are there ways to have a
process where individuals don't
have to go through so many lay
ers? Who has the authority to do
what? We are exploring new infor
mation systems. It's one of the
long-term strategies we see to try
to contain our administrative
costs," Cox said.
Currently, 14.2 percent of the
University's expenditures are for
"institutional support."
"I don't know what the num
bers are that were projected for
each of the projects" in terms of
hoped-for savings, McGee said, but
he indicated that they could be
quite large.
The Change Support Team
looks for "change initiatives that
would yield the biggest benefit to
the University's administration,"
according to McGee.
Once the oversight group ap
proves a project, the Change Sup
port Team evaluates its purpose

and makes sure it doesn't conflict
with any other ongoing projects.
The projects, which deal with
administrative processes such as
accounting, purchasing and the
budget, aim to increase overall
efficiency. Each project has a six
to eight-person team, overseen
by a sponsor. Half of this team
deals with business issues; the
other half provides technical ex
pertise.
Part of the plan to increase effi
ciency incorporates new Oracle
software that is being designed "to
provide automation to support
these reworked processes," M<kjee
said.
The software, which will be cus
tomized for Stanford, will have one
user interface and will "provide an
integrated solution to handle each
one of these projects," McGee
added.
The new software should be im
plemented within the next 18
months.
