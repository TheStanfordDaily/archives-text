# COP member cites lack of support for legislation
## Oram calls off reform bill 
### Alex Scherbakovsky Contributing writer 
Citing lack of strong support, Council of
Presidents member Jon Oram yesterday
withdrew a bill that proposed a change in
the structure of the ASSU executive branch.
Oram's bill called for one student body
president and three vice presidents, rather
than the current four presidents. This
change, he said in his bill, could win more re
spect from the University administration
and would more clearly define the individ
ual roles of the leaders.
Oram said he still considers his proposal
constructive reform, but he decided to drop
the bill because, with other COP restructur
ing bills on the table, "it's just not worth it
to be attacked on all sides."
Oram's proposal came in the midst of
heated debate in the ASSU about the role of
the COP.
Senior Michael Slemmer proposed a new
constitution for the ASSU earlier this week,
saying "the current ASSU Constitution, au
thored in 1969, no longer accurately repre
sents the will of the students of Stanford
University." Slemmer's proposal calls for
an executive structure with only one presi
dent and one vice president.
"ISlemmer's] Constitution proposal got
support from people who I thought would be
supporting my bill," said Oram. When
asked his views on Slemmer's bill, Oram
replied that he has "yet to read it."
Graduate senators Doug Natelson and

Sandeep Singhal are also working on a pos
sible third answer to the question of how the
COP should be set up.
Oram's proposal has also been ques
tioned by fellow COP member Nicole
Vazquez.
In an e-mail message written Wednesday
and obtained by The Daily, Oram said he
disagreed with Vazquez's view that his pro
posal would hurt the ethnic communities by
denying them representation.
"Those of you who know me, recognize
my commitment to the ethnic groups as well
as to all student groups on this campus,"
Oram said in the e-mail.
Vazquez's argument, which found sup
port among some People's Platform sena
tors, maintains that Oram's system would
lead to a series of white male presidents over
the next few years, according to Oram.
COP member Rich Stolz pointed out that
the senate has three more weeks before it
needs to make a decision on the matter, and
that further discussion will be helpful. "We
are planning on holding town meetings to
discuss Slemmer's proposal and other COP
related bills," said Stolz.
Stolz's call for more discussion was
echoed by Deputy Senate Chair Bill Shen.
Pointing out that all three bills call for a sin
gle president, Shen said, "the authors [of
the three bills] are not far from agreement.
They need to come together and work out
one coherent package that both parties [the
People's Platform and the Students' Al
liance] can agree on."
