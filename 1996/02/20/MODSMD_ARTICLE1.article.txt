# Fungus prevention
## Molecular study receives funding 
### Michelle Kuo 
SmithKline Beecham Pharma
ceuticals has awarded three
$150,000, two-year research grants
to Stanford Medical School faculty
members in the Program in Molecu
lar and Genetic Medicine.
"The grants are wonderful; this
type of funding permits us to initiate
studies we might not otherwise have
begun because they are still in the
preliminary stages," grant recipient
Stanley Falkow said.
Falkow, a professor of microbiol
ogy and immunology, was joined by
Assoc. Biochemistry Prof. Douglas
Brutlag and David Kingsley, an as
sistant professor of developmental
biology, in receiving the grants.
Falkow is using a genetic ap
proach to identify the virulence of
two mutant Candida species, be
lieved responsible for an increasing
number of hospital-acquired fungal
infections.
"The grant allows us to do pilot
studies which lead to other kinds of

breakthroughs," Falkow said of his
research, titled "A Novel Approach
for the Identification of Virulence
Determinants in Candida."
"The Candida pathogen ... is
such a problem, especially in hospi
tal situations, because it is innately
resistant to the current most widely
used antifungal agent," said Bren
dan Cormack, a postdoctoral stu
dent directing Falkow's research.
"Very little is understood about
this very complex and virulent or
ganism," Cormack said. "The grant
comes at a very good time because all
the preliminary work is done; over
the next two years we will be screen
ing generated mutants of the yeast
in order to develop novel antifun
gals.
"We feel very lucky that ours was
selected from a strong field of pro
jects; our grant reflects SmithK
line's interest in a generally per
ceived threat of antifungal
pathogens," he said.
Brutlag's research is titled "Sys
tematic Construction of a Protein
Motif Database." With the assis
tance of postdoctoral student
Thomas Wu, the professor is work
ing with protein sequencing infor
mation in order to find potentially
similar structures of amino acids in
different organisms. Genetic disor
ders may be combated with pharma
ceutical agents derived from the re
search.
Kingsley is working to investi

gate the genetics of bone growthâ€”
in particular, excessive bone forma
tion and premature osteoarthritis
in humans. Bone morphogenetic
proteins, signaling molecules in
bone formation, are the basis of his
study.
The awards are the second por
tion of a $2.5 million grant, extended
over five years, from SmithKline
Beecham to Stanford.
The company finalized this re
search funding agreement in No
vember 1994, when it was an
nounced by Biochemistry Prof. Paul
Berg.
The grants range from $90,000 to
$150,000 for two years and are open

to all members of the molecular and
genetic medicine program. Thirty
two applications were submitted this
year.
Final evaluations are left up to
SmithKline Beecham, which bases
decisions on interest and credibility.
The program has been affiliated
with the company since it was found
ed in 1988.
"The decision is always quite
close and it's hard for evaluators to
come down to just three recipients,"
program administrator Christina
Doe ring said.
This year's grant recipients will
receive funding from March 1 until
Jan. 31,1998.
