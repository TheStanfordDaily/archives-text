# Fungus prevention
## Molecular study receives funding 
### Michelle Kuo 
SmithKline Beecham Pharma
ceuticals has awarded three
$150,000, two-year research grants
to Stanford Medical School faculty
members in the Program in Molecu
lar and Genetic Medicine.
"The grants are wonderful; this
type of funding permits us to initiate
studies we might not otherwise have
begun because they are still in the
preliminary stages," grant recipient
Stanley Falkow said.
Falkow, a professor of microbiol
ogy and immunology, was joined by
Assoc. Biochemistry Prof. Douglas
Brutlag and David Kingsley, an as
sistant professor of developmental
biology, in receiving the grants.
Falkow is using a genetic ap
proach to identify the virulence of
two mutant Candida species, be
lieved responsible for an increasing
number of hospital-acquired fungal
infections.
"The grant allows us to do pilot
studies which lead to other kinds of

breakthroughs," Falkow said of his
research, titled "A Novel Approach
for the Identification of Virulence
Determinants in Candida."
"The Candida pathogen ... is
such a problem, especially in hospi
tal situations, because it is innately
resistant to the current most widely
used antifungal agent," said Bren
dan Cormack, a postdoctoral stu
dent directing Falkow's research.
"Very little is understood about
this very complex and virulent or
ganism," Cormack said. "The grant
comes at a very good time because all
the preliminary work is done; over
the next two years we will be screen
ing generated mutants of the yeast
in order to develop novel antifun
gals.
"We feel very lucky that ours was
selected from a strong field of pro
jects; our grant reflects SmithK
line's interest in a generally per
ceived threat of antifungal
pathogens," he said.
