Spend more on Everglades
EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK, Fla.
(AP) — The Clinton administration wants to
double spending to restore the Everglades to
about $1.5 billion, funded in part by cutting
subsidies to Florida sugar farmers, Vice Pres
ident A 1 Gore said yesterday.
Part of the money would be used to buy
126,000 acres of land for an attempt to
restore some of the Everglades degraded by
decades of draining, farming, pollution and
development.
Gore spoke alongside a small lagoon at the
Royal Palm Visitor's Center in Everglades
National Park. Two alligators floated nearby.
"We are dealing with an extremely fragile
system that is on the verge of collapse," Gore
said of the Everglades, a vast sheet of water
known as the River of Grass that stretches
about 50 to 75 miles wide across southern
Florida. The water goes on to nourish Florida
Bay.
E.T. can phone home in Rachel
RACHEL, Nev. (AP) — If E.T. is ever look
ing for a place to phone home, or searching for
a route back to his extraterrestrial kin, this
blip of a town may be just the ticket.
Long a mecca for people who believe we are
not alone, Rachel is now the anchor for Neva
da's newest tourist attraction — the Extrater
restrial Highway. It's even going to get offi
cial state highway signs.
Folks here are convinced there are alien
visitors just over the mountains to the south,
at a top-secret government base known as
Area 51 or Groom Lake.
"I think there are people and machines
from other planets over there," Pat Travis
said as she scrubbed breakfast dishes at the
Little A'Le'lnn — think "alien" — the focal
point of this hamlet of 100 people. "I think
our government is working in conjunction
with them."
