# IRA admits to London explosion

### 
LONDON (AP) - The IRA claimed
responsibility yesterday for a blast
that ripped through a double-decker
bus in central London, killing one per
son and injuring nine. Police said they
believed the bomb was detonated acci
dentally and the carrier may have
been among the victims.
Two people were arrested yesterday
under anti-terrorism laws, Scotland
Yard said. But it refused to say
whether they were connected to the
Sunday night explosion.
Despite some Protestant political
leaders' demands that the government
lock up all suspected IRA leaders,
British and Irish leaders continued
trying to salvage the battered peace
process in Northern Ireland.
The Irish Republican Army had
already killed two people in London
since calling off its 17-month cease
fire Feb. 9.
Scotland Yard said there was no
warning before the 10:38 p.m. explo
sion at the edge of the theater district,
near Covent Garden's popular restau
rants and bars.
Commander John Grieve, head of
Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist unit,

said the bus "was not the intended
target," although he couldn't say what
was.
The IRA, in a statement telephoned
to the British Broadcasting Corp. in
Belfast, Northern Ireland, claimed
responsibility.
"We can say at this stage we regret
the loss of life and injuries which
occurred," the caller said.
The mangled and burned wreckage
continued to block traffic yesterday
while police technicians probed for
clues. Buses carry video cameras, but
it wasn't known if they survived the
blast.
Four victims of the blast remained
hospitalized yesterday.
Dr. David Williams, director of
Accidents and Emergencies at St.
Thomas' Hospital, where the victims
were treated, confirmed yesterday
that armed guards were on duty in the
hospital. Scotland Yard refused to
comment on the reason for the extra
security.
Williams said one injured man, 38-
year-old Ralf Mobart of Torquay in
southwestern England, suffered
severe injuries on the right side of his

face and was in critical condition. His
girlfriend, Denise Hall, 30, also was
injured.
Londoners, meanwhile, settled into
the familiar routine of bomb alerts,
train cancellations and immobilized
traffic.
"You have always got it in the back
of your mind that you could be in the
same street next time," said John
Langton, who was delivering meat
yesterday near the scene of the bomb
ing.
"I am just carrying on as normal.
There is nothing you can do â€” except
hope the bombs don't come to you."
Peter Robinson, deputy leader of
the Democratic Unionist Party, the
third-largest and exclusively Protes
tant party in Northern Ireland, urged
the government to simply lock up sus
pected IRA leaders.
However, Sir Patrick Mayhew,
Britain's minister responsible for gov
erning Northern Ireland, said the
search for a peaceful settlement would
continue despite the bombing. He
rejected Protestant calls for the gov
ernment to end all contacts with the
IRA's allies in the Sinn Fein party.
