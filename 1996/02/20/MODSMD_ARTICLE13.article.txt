### 
CADIZ, Philippines (AP) — Bodies
floated to the shore and the city's
biggest funeral home ran out of coffins
yesterday after an overloaded ferry
sank in stormy waters, killing 54 peo
ple. Twelve others were missing.
The Sunday night disaster was the
latest in a string of tragedies involving
ferries used to link the Philippines'
7,000 islands.
The ML Gretchen I, carrying more
than 200 people — twice its legal

capacity — was just a few hundred
yards from shore when it began rock
ing in strong winds and capsized when
panicked passengers rushed to one
side, coast guard officials said.
The dead included at least 31 chil
dren. Many of them were hit in the
water by debris flying from the ship as
it broke up under crashing waves.
The Beniabon Funeral Home in
Cadiz ran out of coffins after the
remains of 48 people were brought

there. The bodies were placed side by
side on the ground as workers rushed
to build plywood coffins.
Helen Escarlan, the wife of a fisher
man, survived with her husband and
8-year-old son, but lost her 2-year-old
daughter.
"I put my little girl inside my dress
and we clung to a passing rescue boat.
But a big wave tossed us in the air, and
as we slammed into the water I lost the
girl and she drowned," she said.

The dilapidated ferry had been
ordered out of service last week by the
Maritime Industry Authority for being
unseaworthy, coast guard official
Edmund Tan said. It was not clear
whether the vessel, purchased second
hand from China 10 years ago, had
received permission to resume opera
tions.
Charges for overloading were being
prepared against the boat captain,
Norberto Nepange, and its owner.
