Martin Gutierrez Sandoval, a 70-year-old former factory worker, displays a 1968
Volkswagen Beetle he built out of 2,740 reject record player parts yesterday in
Mexico City. His car, which runs smoothly, has made it into next year's edition of
the Guinness Book of Records in the "Feats of Man" category.
