# Ebola hits Africa again
## 13 already dead, 7 more infected 
### 
GENEVA (AP) - In a small
African village gripped by the dead
ly Ebola virus, a team of interna
tional medical experts is involved
in a grim game of wait and see.
Thirteen people have died from
the disease in Gabon, a country of
1.2 million on the west coast of
Africa, the World Health Organiza
tion confirmed yesterday. Seven
more are infected. Only time will
tell how many more the disease
will hit, WHO said.
The most recent death was the
6-month-old child of a man who
became infected after skinning and
eating a chimpanzee found dead in
the forest. Another child from the
same family has been hospitalized
with fever.
So far, all the victims are from
Mayibout, a remote northern vil
lage of 150 inhabitants on the Ivin
do River, 200 miles east of the cap
ital, Libreville. In two neighboring
villages, seven more people with
fevers arc suspected Ebola cases.
"For the time being it is very
uncertain how the epidemic is

going to go," said WHO spokesman
Valeiy Abramov.
There are already concerns the
disease may have spread to Makok
ou, capital of Ogooue-Ivindo
province, about 100 miles away,
where the sick were hospitalized,
he said.
One of the deadliest viruses
known to man, Ebola causes inter
nal and external bleeding. It is
spread through bodily fluids and
kills up to 80 percent of those
infected. There is no treatment
and no cure.
The outbreak in Gabon is the
third time the disease has struck
the African continent in a year. In
Zaire last spring, it infected 316
people and killed 245. A single case
of Ebola was confirmed in the
Ivory Coast in December.
Nineteen Mayibout men are
thought to have been initially
infected after skinning and eating
a chimpanzee found dead in the
forest. Chimpanzees are known to
have previously contracted the dis
ease.
