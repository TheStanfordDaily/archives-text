Stanford needs to become
more vocal about political
issues to protect interests

Recently, Congress passed —
and President Clinton signed
into law — a comprehensive
telecommunications bill aimed at,
among other things, fostering com
petition in phone and cable service.
However, a relatively small portion
of the legislation raises some con
cerns to which Stanford should pay
close attention.
As most regular users of the
Internet likely know, the Communi
cations Indecency Act prohibits any
thing "obscene, lewd, lascivious,
filthy or indecent with intent to
annoy, abuse, threaten or harass
another person" on a network acces
sible to minors. One possible conse
quence of this law, which was spon
sored by Democratic Sen. James
Exon of Nebraska, is that Stanford
could be held responsible for any
thing placed on the University net
work considered "obscene, lewd, las
civious, filthy or indecent" — terms
subject to wide interpretation.
First, it is clear this law violates
personal freedom as well as common
sense. After all, who has the author
ity to judge what is "indecent" and
what is not? Furthermore, the
design of the Internet is inherently
decentralized — any attempt to reg
ulate its content is doomed to fail
because it is impossible to control a
network with so many disjointed
pieces. Because of these issues, the
bill is illogical.
Now that the bill has been signed
into law, however, the University
must pay close attention to its
enforcement. According to Universi
ty officials, Stanford is on the ball.
General Counsel Michael Roster
said "a lot of people" are looking at
the consequences of the bill, which,
he said, "definitely raises a lot of
issues."
Although Stanford is examining

its legal responsibilities, the bill rais
es a broader question of whether the
University could — and should — be
more active in the public debate pre
ceding legal changes that could sig
nificantly impact the way Stanford
operates. Stanford was certainly
vocal during the debate over indirect
costs — once that was over, the Uni
versity faced millions of dollars in
lost revenue because the indirect
cost rate was reduced.
The debate over regulating the
Internet simmered for a long time
before the Communications Inde
cency Act became law, hut Stanford
never entered the fray, even though
its impact on the University's opera
tions could be significant. A variety
of other organizations and compa
nies, however, did voice opposition.
Some started a campaign on the
World Wide Web, encouraging sites
to exhibit blue ribbons or turn their
pages black in protest.
Fortunately, the new regulations
have been stalled, at least for a little
while. Thanks to widespread
protests and a lawsuit filed by the
American Civil Liberties Union on
the same day President Clinton
signed the bill into law, a federal
judge placed a temporary restrain
ing order on Thursday keeping the
government from enforcing the law.
While outraged individuals and
groups demonstrated against a gov
ernment-controlled Internet, Stan
ford's administration remained
quiet. University President Gerhard
Casper cannot publicly endorse or
oppose all political issues, as he must
not allow the University's indepen
dent academic viewpoint to be com
promised. However, Stanford also
cannot count on others to keep its
interests in mind. Restriction of
material on the Internet runs
counter to the academic freedom ,
and could close off a valuable learn
ing resource for students.
President Casper should take
high-profile stands on issues like
this. The power of the Stanford
name is one that should not be
abused, but the University should
able to use it to protect its inter
ests.
