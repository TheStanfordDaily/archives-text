Pointing out the logical fallacy of affirmative action

NOW THAT Nick Thompson, in
his Feb. 14 column, has assuaged
his "white guilt" by acknowledg
ing his membership in the "underquali
fled, unprepared" legacy pool of Stanford
students, we must point out the logical
fallacy of his argument. At the risk of
bursting the bubble of importance that
apparently clouds your judgment,
Thompson, the "more important ques
tion, however, is [NOT] why people all
over the country are harping about end
ing racial affirmative action while ignor
ing may dubious legacy privilege."
While it is an interesting defense of
racial quotas to suggest an analogy to
alumni preferences, the comparison is
not useful. First, Thompson has done
nothing to provide any rational justifica
tion for racial quotas, but has only
attempted to divert attention from the

valid arguments in favor of ending such
that we already know — alumni prefer
ences are unfair and skew the admis
sions process — and nothing about the
lack of wisdom of racial quotas. Impor
tant policy decisions should stand or fall
on the merits of the decisions them
selves, not on the faults of other inde
pendent programs.
More importantly, Thompson fails to
understand a crucial distinction between
the admissions policies of Stanford and
the lack of wisdom of affirmative action,
as voiced by his most derided caricatures
of Governor Wilson and Senator Gramm
— Stanford is a private institution,
whereas affirmative action reform, the
California Civil Rights Initiative in par
ticular, would end affirmative action in
public state of federal affairs. What is
good for Stanford may not be good for

our government, whose ultimate con
stituency is its citizens, not Thompson's
father and other potential alumni
donors. The government should not be in
the business of discriminating against or
in favor of individuals on the basis of the
color of their skin; the 1964 Civil Rights
Act recognized as much. Dressing up dis
crimination by changing the labels to
"affirmative action" or "benign discrimi
nation" does nothing to dispel the very
fact that the government is judging your
worth by the color of your skin. Whether
Stanford chooses to do so may be repre
hensible, but it does not carry the impri
matur of the government, nor the coer
cive power to enforce its decisions against
the general public.
Why should we care if the govern
ment discriminates in favor of racial
minorities? For the very reason that the

architects of the 1964 Civil Rights Act
noted and that Thompson notes in his
spirited attack on alumni preferences —
"if it weren't their birth right" the pref
erences would not attach. Mr. Thompson
rightly ridicules the logic of doling out
benefits on the basis of birth-right
because there is none. Does it become
more logical when the government does
so? How about if the government meted
out criminal punishment or social secu
rity benefits or tax audits or restricted
abortion access on the basis of birth
right? Preferences of this sort would be
entirely indefensible; the government
should be in the business of enforcing
equal opportunity, not of undermining
it.
