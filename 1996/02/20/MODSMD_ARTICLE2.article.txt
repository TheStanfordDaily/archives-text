# Law Journal asks students about sex
## 36 percent had unsafe sex, survey says 
### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
Love is still alive at the Law
School, but not all of its vital signs
show it to be in peak condition.
A recent survey by the Stanford
Law Journal polled the school's stu
dents about their personal and sex
ual relationships and yielded a
number of interesting figures.
For instance, 3G percent of law
students reported having engaged
in unprotected sex. The survey did
not specify whether unprotected
sex within a long-term, monoga
mous relationship had been exclud
ed. The rate for single students was
31 percent.
"I thought that people who were
more educated would know better,"

said Jeehye Park, the journal's lead
researcher for the survey.
Nearly two-thirds of the law stu
dents are in a long-term relation
ship, but nearly half of" those have
been longdistanceduringsome part
of law school. The long distance
does not, however, seem to have a
strong correlation with break-ups:
Of those who reported a dissolution
of a long-term relationship, half
were long distance, and the other
half were jiot.
Fourteen percent of law stu
dents are married and 49 percent
are in long-term relationships.
Forty-one percent of married stu
dents and 55 percent of those in re
lationships reported that their rela
tionships have been long distance
for at least part of law school.
The high proportion of students
in long-term relationships makes
the pool of unattached individuals
small, researchers said. "This ex
plains why the single students are
always complaining," said Park.
One-third of single law students
reported dating less than once a
year, one-third between one to 10
times per year, and another third at
least once per month.
Of those who dated during law
school, 46 percent did so with an
other law student. There is, howev
er, definitely a desire and interest to
meet people outside of the law
school and Stanford, said Ron Sil
verton, a second-year J.D. / MBA
student.
As for sexual activity, the distri

bution follows a bell curve: 10 per
cent are virgins and 11 percent re
port having sex every day, with the
rest falling in between.
If frequency is any indication,
then married students are the most
sexually satisfied, with 71 percent
having sex at least once a week vs.
21 percent for singles. "The media
portrays the contrary image," said
Park.
The poll was conducted partly in
response to dissatisfaction among
students, pollsters said. "People
complain a lot that there's no social
life here," said Marc Bennett, editor
in chief of the Law Journal.
"There's a lot of sexual frustra
tion at the law school," said Silver
ton. "The survey puts some causali
ty behind some of the conditions."
Despite the survey's ostensibly
good intentions, "some people had a
violent reaction" to it, feeling that
such matters were too personal an
issue for a survey, said Park. A total
of 570 surveys were distributed,

and 118 were returned.
The biggest concern was that
people would not take it seriously,
but they did, Bennett said.
"[The survey] was interesting.
Obviously sex is a topic that's inter
ested anyone over 12," said Silver
ton.
In comparing the Law School
population to other graduate stu
dents, Bennett said, "Law students
are probably a little bit more extro
verted" since the legal profession
typically demands good social
skills.
Park added that the social life is
possibly less active in other areas of
the University where the male-fe
male ratio is more unbalanced.
Nevertheless, the staff of the
monthly newspaper is working on
improving the social life at the Law
School. It is planning a "love con
nection type of thing to match two
students up" and also may publish a
primer on how to ask people out,
Bennett said.
