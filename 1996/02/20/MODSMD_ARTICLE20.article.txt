# Rawls defends article regarding his stance about homosexuality
## 
### 
In his column on Thursday, Drew
Rapp asserted that an article of mine
in The Stanford Review defended vio
lence against gays. His reasoning? I
had noted that natural selection will
favor biological mechanisms that keep
homosexuality from occurring. Let me
break that down for Rapp: I was talk
ing about natural selection trying to
stamp out homosexuality — not people
trying to stamp out homosexuality —
and my comments contained no nor
mative element. I did not say natural
selection is good or bad, I just said it

is. As for my own views, they are in
the same paragraph Rapp quoted from
The Review:
"The fact is, Ihomosexualsl have got
their wires crossed, and there is noth
ing to be gained by despising them for
it, only much to lose. Homosexuals are
still human beings, whose lives are
valuable for the same reasons that
other people's lives are valuable:
because they have the same open
ended moral intelligence that others
have, capable of discovering what
there is to value in the world and pur
suing it."
Unfortunately, Rapp does not seem
interested in pursuing anything but
his own pain and victim status. (Drop
ping friends because they did not
speak out against insensitive remarks,
without knowing what their private
thoughts were?) I though he was a
homosexual, not a masochist.
