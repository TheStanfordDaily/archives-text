## Tales of a Payless junkie 
### 
Like wise sages from a Kung Fu
movie, my parents always told me
"let the pain pass." Colds,
headaches and cuts all went under the
tender care of Mother Nature. The only
medicine in the house was a foul-tasting
loquat cough syrup, cure of the ancients.
I never had the chance to challenge the
child-proof cap. Instead, I took deep
breaths and suffered patiently.
I was ripe for the shadowy, under
ground world of over-the-counter drugs.
Over winter break, I received a sample
of NyQuil in the mail. The first one is
always free. I tossed it aside. Just say no.
Then the flu plunged me into the depths
of despair. Suddenly, drinking orange
juice and inhaling shower steam seemed
so provincial. I remembered the NyQuil.
All the cool kids are doing it. I popped the
sea-green gelcap and waited.
Admittedly, I'm a lightweight. One
beer will put me in red-faced good spirits.
Two drinks, and I'm fluent in French and
Chinese, doing cartwheels to prove my
stability. But no pint of Keystone Light
could ever have prepared me for the hal
lucinations to come. Sure, I could breathe
lying down. Hut I was convinced if I fell
asleep, I'd never wake up. Darkness
descended. I dreamt I was mudwrestling
my worst nemesis. On stage at a beauty
pageant.
My nightmare ended a day and night
later when I woke up screaming.

I began looking for more drugs avail
able without ID. I prowled the dark alley
ways of Payless and Thrifty. Up on the
highest shelf, out of the reach of minors,
I discovered the counterpart to NyQuil.
The yin to the yang. DayQuil. Cold
medicine inherently makes you drowsy,
right? Do not operate heavy machinery or
those cars at Malibu Grand Prix. Yet
Vicks touts DayQuil as the "stuffy head,
congested chest, sore throat, coughing,
fever so you can face your day medicine."
Theoretically, with a shot of DayQuil,
you're ready to ride through White Plaza
at noon. It makes you feel invincible. On
top of the world. I held the bottle of
orange goo in my hand. The warning
"may cause excitability in children"
intrigued me. The safety SquEASE cap
made trying a hit so convenient.
Only the intervention of a caring
friend and recovering DayQuil addict
stopped my descent. He explained Vicks
simply adds a stimulant to its traditional
sleep-inducing formula. What results is
like pressing the brake and accelerator at
the same time — grinding gears and lots
of smoke. I nodded, finding the prospect
strangely attractive. Then he told me one
of the side effects not listed on the box —
jellied urine. A failed Smuckers flavor?
"No," he said. "You think you're done,
but then you have to squeeze the rest out.
Otherwise it leaks into your boxers fif
teen minutes later." DayQuil also made

him feel jittery and persecuted (I realized
later he always feels that way). But I was
warned.
Memories of childhood illnesses began
to take on a rosy, feverish glow. Back
then, I always went to school sick,
spreading germs and good will. My mar
tyrdom brought me acclaim. I won the
perfect attendance award in eighth grade.
Only once more was I tempted. This
quarter, a drift of papers blew in, all due
the next day. I was desperate. My friend
offered me his NoDoz. He swore by those
tiny white pills after previous experiments
with Ritalin and X. "I've been awake for a
week. It's great," he said. Much more pow
erful than Pixie stix, I knew. I tentatively
reached for the box. Then his eye started
twitching. I backed slowly away from him.
Despite my resolve to explore legal highs, I
decided to sip my decaf mocha, which kept
me wired all night.
The first step is to admit I have a prob
lem. My name's Vanessa, and I get high
on life. Oh, the shame, the stigma of drug
virginity! But maybe the toughest part is
admitting to myself my parents were
right.
You, I learned it from you.

Vanessa prefers grape to cherry-flavorec
gelcaps.
