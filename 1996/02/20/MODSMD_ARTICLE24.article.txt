## Weird science: The truth about the Nobel Prize and snot 
### Jessen Yu 
QWhy isn't there a Nobel Prize for
• mathematics?
A The Nobel Prizes were created
• according to the will of Alfred
• Nobel, the famous Swedish
chemist who invented dynamite. Many
people believe that while he was writing
his will, Nobel decided against including
a prize for mathematics because his wife
had cheated on him with a famous math
ematician of the time, supposedly Gosta
Mittag-Leffler.
There are a few problems with this
explanation, the chief one being that
Alfred Nobel was never married.
Before he became rich and famous,
Alfred Nobel produced nitroglycerin in a
factory in Sweden. Soon after the factory
exploded, Nobel made the discovery that

nitroglycerin could be absorbed into a
packing material called kieselguhr, which
made it much safer to handle. Thus
Nobel invented dynamite, starting him
down the road to inventing many other
types of "safer" explosives and detonat
ing devices.
Strangely enough, Nobel was essen
tially a humanitarian, hoping, perhaps
misguidedly, that his explosive invention
would help to end wars for good. With
this in mind, he established the Nobel
Foundation in his will, to reward "those
who, during the preceding year, shall
have conferred the greatest benefit on
mankind."
Nobel didn't really consider mathe
matics a practical science which would
benefit humanity and therefore did not
create a prize for mathematics.
In any case, Alfred Nobel was not
motivated by revenge when he decided
not to create a Nobel Prize for mathe

matics. It's just that a story about fight
ing over a woman is so much more inter
esting.
But not as interesting as the next
question.
QWhy do we have so much snot?
A You might think that this is one
• of those questions that I made up
• just to get a cheap laugh, but it's
snot.
Seriously, the snot, or mucus, in your
nasal passages serves some pretty useful
purposes. But first, let's see where it all
comes from.
The paranasal air sinuses are big holes
in the bones around your nose, connected
to your nasal cavity by little drainage
openings. Each of these sinuses constant
ly produces mucus which is moved into

your nasal cavity by tiny hair-like things
called cilia. Your nasal cavity is also cov
ered with mucus-secreting glands, which
also produce mucus 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.
When you think about it, your nasal
cavity and its associated sinuses are a lot
like the 7-11 of the mucus world. That
probably explains why people don't think
about it much.
So, where does all of this mucus go?
Well, there really are only two places it
can go. You can either blow it out your
nose, or swallow it. Most people won't
admit to it, but a lot of the mucus you
produce is swallowed. The mucus that
does stay in the nose helps to trap dust,
bacteria and other small things floating
around in the air that you shouldn't be
sucking down into your lungs.
The problem is that after the mucus
collects enough of these particles, it hard
ens into tiny globs. Then, you have some

thing totally different, something we like
to call a booger. Most people get rid of
them by blowing them out their noses.
Other people don't.
When you're sick, there's even more
yucky stuff inside of you that your body is
trying to get rid of, so you go into over
drive producing mucus. It's sort of like
having two 7-1 l's in your nose, but not
really.
Anyway, the major purpose of the
mucus in your nose is to trap and get rid
of disgusting things. And since there are
so many disgusting things around, we
need a lot of snot.
How ironic.
