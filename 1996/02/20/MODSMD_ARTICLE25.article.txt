## Stanford women top Oregon No. 4 Cardinal uses 17-2 second-half run to pull away 
### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
Stanford 74
Oregon 65

The Oregon women's basketball team stayed com
petitive for about 20 minutes Saturday night at
Maples Pavilion, but like most visitors to the Cardi
nal's home floor, the Ducks couldn't stand up to Stan
ford's talent and depth for a full 40 minutes. Down
just 34-29 at the break, Oregon crumpled at the start
of the second half, and when it was all said and done,
Stanford had run away with a 74-65 win.
Olympia Scott provided the spark for the fourth
ranked Cardinal, as the sophomore center scored the
first 12 points after halftime to key a 17-2 run that
crippled any Oregon hopes of an upset. Stanford
would lead by as many as 21 in the second half before
turning to its reserves.
Saturday's convincing win — coming on the heels
of an 86-62 victory over then-No. 15 Oregon State on
Thursday — all but clinched the Pacific 10 Confer
ence title for the Cardinal with five games remaining.
Stanford (20-2 overall, 13-0 Pac-10), trying to go un
defeated in conference play for the first time since the
1988-89 season, leads the second-place Beavers by
four games. Oregon, winner of seven of its last eight
games before Saturday, remains in third place with a
7-6 mark in conference play (15-8 overall).
"Obviously the key for us was our second half and
Olympia getting after it defensively," said Stanford
head coach Amy Tucker. "I'm not sure if it was any
thing I said at halftime — I really don't think it was."
Oregon stayed close in the first half by holding the
Cardinal to 37.1 percent shooting from the field. The
Ducks didn't shoot much better at 37.5, but Oregon
matched the Cardinal almost basket-for-basket, lead
ing by as many as four before Stanford put together a
9-2 run just before the half to surge ahead by five.
Things didn't stay close for long, however, as Stan
ford came out at the start of the second half and
promptly put the game out of reach. Scott did the
honors almost single-handedly, rattling off 12 points
in the first three minutes, 28 seconds of the half, in
cluding two breakaway lay-ups off steals.
"That really changed the complexion of the game,"
Tucker said.
Scott, who also scored the first nine points of the
second half in the Oregon State game, finished with a
team-high 17 points on 7-of-14 shooting.
"I just think in the first half of both games, I had
shots that I should've made," Scott said, "so I got on
myself about it. I picked it up in the second half — I
knew that I had to make those shots. I just wanted to

pick it up defensively, put the
hammer down in the first live
minutes."
Stanford put the hammer down
by scoring 17 of the first 19 points
in the second half to take a 51-31
lead with 13:53 remaining. Ore
gon was never able to get back in it
after that.
"That's been something Stan
ford's done really well, is to come
out in the second half and make a
big run," said Oregon head coach
Jody Runge. "We talked about
that at halftime — getting them

under control — and we just
weren't able to accomplish that.
With the exception of that 17-2
run I thought we played a pretty
good basketball game, | but 1 we
kind of got in a hole there and
couldn't get back out of it."
Oregon came into the game
leading the Pac-10 in scoring de
fense, allowingjust 58.2 points per
game. But that didn't do much
good against a Stanford team that
averages 77.2
"They were a good defensive
team," said sophomore forward
Vanessa Nygaard, who finished
with 16 points while burying three
of six three-pointers. "But I think
a lot of the times when we didn't
score it was because we weren't

running our offense — we were
taking a bad shot. They did all
right, [but] it wasn't like Kate
IStarbird] couldn't drive or I
didn't have three-pointers or
Olympia couldn't post up."
Saturday's win was Stanford's
14th straight and extended the
women's home-court win streak
to 28. The Cardinal has now won
44 consecutive Pac-10 games at
Maples Pavilion.
"I think their kids love to play
here," Rungesaid. "It's a great en
vironment for basketball and they
always play very enthusiastically
here. I think it's important for
them to feel like they're playing
well right now going into tourna
ment time."
