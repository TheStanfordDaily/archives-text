# Conference champions — again
## Women's swimming takes Pac-10 title 
### Ratha Harntha Staff writer 
The Stanford women's swimming
team has returned to where it belongs
— on top.
After losing its first dual meet in
eight years to USC two weeks ago, the
Cardinal rebounded to capture its 10th

consecutive Pacific 10 Conference title
last weekend in Long Beach, Calif.
Stanford's final point total of 1583 was
600 points better than that of its closest
competitor, USC.
"It was awesome," senior co-captain
Jane Skillman said of her fourth Fac-10
championship. "Everyone has some
thing to hang their hats on. Losing I to

USC] is the best thing that could have
happened to us."
That loss jump-started the Cardinal
early at the conference championships
as it took a lead it would never relin
quish. In the meet's third event, the
200-yard individual medley, the team
for the three-day event. Stanford
had the top three finishers and
four of the top five in the event,
which freshman Chantal Rawn
won with a time of 2:00.82.
As the first day of competition
wore on, the Cardinal continued
to increase its lead. Of the day's
six events, the team had four
first-place, two second-place and
two third-place finishers. Rawn
and senior Jessica Tong (50-yard
freestyle) joined the 200-yard
freestyle and 400-yard medley
relay teams as event winners.
The 400-yard medley team of
Tong, freshman Elin Austevoll,
freshman Suzanne Toledo and ju
nior Claudia Franco crushed the
field by more than four seconds.
By day's end, the Cardinal had
a commanding 467-311 lead over
USC. UCLA was a distant third
with 207 points.
In the two days that followed,
Stanford never even gave the com
petition a chance to close the gap.
"We wiped away any chance
USC had to catch up to us in the

prelims," Skillman said. "In
every race, half of the swimmers
in the finals were from Stanford."
At the end of the second day,
Stanford had increased its lead to
almost 400 points. The team won
six of the eight events as well as
placing second or third in four of
the day's races. Freshman Kari
Edwards took the 400-yard indi
vidual medley in 4:16.02 and se
nior co-captain Lisa Jacob
squeaked past USC freshman
Lindsey Benko by .05 seconds for
the 200-yard freestyle title.
Tong added to her total of con
ference titles, notching a victory
in the 100-yard backstroke and
teaming with Austevoll, fresh
man Jodi Jackson and Franco to
win the 200-yard medley relay.
"Jessica Tong was incredible,"
Skillman said. "If there was an
award [given to the swimmer who
earns the most points during the
meet], Jessica would have won it."
Austevoll also won two more
races on the second day. In the
100-yard breaststroke, the
freshman passed UCLA's Lind
say Etter in the final lap to take
the title. In the day's last event,
she joined sophomore Amy 01-
berhelman, junior Sarah Ander

son and Edwards in the Cardi
nal's 800-yard freestyle relay
victory.
Tong and Austevoll led the way
on the final day of competition.
Tong edged Franco by .04 seconds
for first and freshman Emily
Smith placed third to complete the
Stanford sweep in the 100-yard
freestyle. Then Tong and Franco
teamed up with Jacob and sopho
more Lindsay Gassner to win the
400-yard freestyle relay. By the
end of the weekend, Tong had six
Pac-10 titles under her belt.
Austevoll again passed
UCLA's Etter in the final lap in
the 200-yard breaststroke for her
fifth conference victory. Ander
son then scored the fourth Stan
ford victory of the day, placing
first in the 1650-yard freestyle.
When the final results were in,
the Cardinal had 14 titles in 21
events as well as six second-place
and seven third-place finishes to
go along with 1583 total points.
USC came in second with 984
points, UCLA third (840.5) and
Cal fourth (750.5).
"If we can do what we did at
Pac-10's, [if we] show the same
kind of competitiveness," Skill
man said, "we can win NCAAs."
