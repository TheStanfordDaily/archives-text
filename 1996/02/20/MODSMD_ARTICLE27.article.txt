The fifth-ranked Stanford men's volleyball
team shed its Cardiac Cardinal label this weekend
and rewarded its fans with two solid victories at
Burn ham Pavilion. After a nail-biting five-game

affair against USC on Feb. 10, the Stanford spik
ers rolled over BYU on Friday nightlO-15,15-11,
15-6,15-8, then swept UC-Irvlne out the door on
Saturday 15-12,15-5,15-10.
This weekend not only saw the Cardinal im
prove to 6-1 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion play, but also marked the emergence of sopho
more swing hitter Devin Poolman and freshman
swing hitter Joshua Palacios as significant con
tributors.
"This was a real breakthrough for Poolman and
Josh," said Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves.
"We were able to find two more players who can
play significant roles in big matches.'"
There was also more strong play from junior
middle blocker Brian Moore, who finished with 38
kills on the weekend. Junior opposite Matt Fuer-

bringer and sophomore Keenan
Whitehurst also played key roles in
vanquishing the Cougars on Friday
with their outstanding play.
But there was more than just

strong play to fuel the Cardinal on
Friday, as the men were looking to
snap a three-match losing streak
against BYU. Unfortunately, as has
been the pattern, Stanford got off
slowly in game one. After a block by
junior setter Stewart Chong and
Moore gave the Cardinal a 1-0 lead,
BYU ran ofT five straight points.
Riding the strength of the freshman
Oswald Antonetti's jump-serving,
the Cougars surged ahead 13-4 on
back-to-back service aces by An
tonetti and sophomore outside hit
ter Steve Hinds.
"[Theyl really got us in trouble
with their jump serves," Nieves
said. "It took a while to adjust."
At this juncture, Poolman came
in and provided a strong boost to
Stanford's sagging spirits. His
serves forced BYU into erratic pass
ing that allowed the Cardinal to
storm within 14-10. That was as
close as they got, however, as Stan
ford forced one out of bounds on
game point.
The Cardinal continued its mo
mentum by bursting out to a 6-1
lead in the second game. The
Cougars rallied to tie matters up at
6-6, but Stanford kept its compo
sure. The men stayed even until
Chong smashed an ace down the
right sideline to put them up for
good, 10-9. Poolman's kill and Fuer
bringer's block knotted the teams
up at one game apiece.
Games three and four turned t he
match into a runaway as Stanford
put on a clinic on how to demoralize
your opponent. Stanford got out to
leads of 5-0, 10-3 and 14-4 before
Moore put the stamp on the third
game with a thunderous block.
"He was awfully good tonight at
tacking the ball," Nieves said.
With the Cougars reeling, game
four displayed more brilliant play by
the Cardinal spikers. A ki 11 by White
hurst staked them to an 8-2 lead lx>-
fore BYU made one last, futile run.
They were able to get within 13-8 on
a kill by freshman middle blocker
Ryan Millar. However, their eight
errors in game four were too much to
overcome as Antonetti forced one
out of bounds on match point.
Whitehurst finished with 20 kills
and no errors in 26 attempts for a
blistering .769 hitting percentage.
"When you have that many at
tempts without an error, you are
very valuable to your team," Nieves
said. "It's making the opponents
earn their points."
Fuerbringer, displaying less and
less trouble with his previously-in
jured shoulder, ended up with 31
kills in 52 attempts.

"He really hit the ball better than
in any other previous week," Nieves
said. "But I think we'll start saying
that more and more as his shoulder
improves."
Irvine provided more game-one
blues for the Cardinal on Saturday.
The Anteaters raced out to a 4-1
lead, and to make matters worse,
Whitehurst was sidelined from the
match by a sprained ankle. The
Stanford reserves came to the res
cue once again as junior middle
blocker Mike Hoefer filled in ad
mirably, contributing nine kills in
the match. This change allowed
Stanford to take charge and surge
ahead 8-5.
Irvine rallied quickly to get with
in one point at 12-11, but a kill by
Moore and a block by Chong got
them within a tally of winning the
game. When Irvine's sophomore
middle blocker Chris Harger fanned
on a kill attempt, Stanford clinched
its fourth straight game.
With the pleasant sensation of
actually having a one-game lead, the
Stanford spikers took this momen
tum and rode it full throttle in the
second game. Poolman's aces mixed
in with kills by Fuerbringer, Pala
cios and Chong gave Stanford an
amazing 10-2 lead. Palacios and
Poolman teamed on a couple of
blocks to stretch the lead to 14-2.
Irvine briefly countered with two
kills by Harger, who would end up
wit h 13, but the rest of his team was
not helping. The Anteaters could
only muster a .161 hitting percent
age as Stanford polished them off
for a two-game lead.
Irvine showed some life in game
three, jumping out to a three-point
lead and tying the Cardinal at sever
al junctures. Up 8-7, however, the
Anteaters committed two crucial
mistakes to give Stanford a 9-8 edge.
A kill by Fuerbringer and Pool
man's block opened up the lead to
11-8. Irvine countered with an ace
by junior opposite John Habben and
a kill by Harger to close the gap
again, but that was as close it got.
Errors by Irvine and two critical
kills by Poolman and Hoefer com
pleted the sweep of the match and
the weekend.
Even though Stanford swept the
two schools, winning its last six
games, Nieves still thinks it hasn't
played its best match.
"We're improving," Nieves said.
"1 don't want to say we've jelled yet
because we've got a ways to go."
Stanford returns to Burnham
next Friday night with a match
against the fourth-ranked UCIA
Bruins.

match by a sprained ankle. The
Stanford reserves came to the res
cue once again as junior middle
blocker Mike Hoefer filled in ad
mirably, contributing nine kills in
the match. This change allowed
Stanford to take charge and surge
ahead 8-5.
Irvine rallied quickly to get with
in one point at 12-11, but a kill by
Moore and a block by Chong got
them within a tally of winning the
game. When Irvine's sophomore
middle blocker Chris Harger fanned
on a kill attempt, Stanford clinched
its fourth straight game.
With the pleasant sensation of
actually having a one-game lead, the
Stanford spikers took this momen
tum and rode it full throttle in the
second game. Poolman's aces mixed
in with kills by Fuerbringer, Pala
cios and Chong gave Stanford an
amazing 10-2 lead. Palacios and
Poolman teamed on a couple of
blocks to stretch the lead to 14-2.
Irvine briefly countered with two
kills by Harger, who would end up
wit h 13, but the rest of his team was
not helping. The Anteaters could
only muster a .161 hitting percent
age as Stanford polished them off
for a two-game lead.
Irvine showed some life in game
three, jumping out to a three-point
lead and tying the Cardinal at sever
al junctures. Up 8-7, however, the
Anteaters committed two crucial
mistakes to give Stanford a 9-8 edge.
A kill by Fuerbringer and Pool
man's block opened up the lead to
11-8. Irvine countered with an ace
by junior opposite John Habben and
a kill by Harger to close the gap
again, but that was as close it got.
Errors by Irvine and two critical
kills by Poolman and Hoefer com
pleted the sweep of the match and
the weekend.
Even though Stanford swept the
two schools, winning its last six
games, Nieves still thinks it hasn't
played its best match.
"We're improving," Nieves said.
"1 don't want to say we've jelled yet
because we've got a ways to go."
Stanford returns to Burnham
next Friday night with a match
against the fourth-ranked UCIA
Bruins.

The fifth-ranked Stanford men's volleyball
team shed its Cardiac Cardinal label this weekend
and rewarded its fans with two solid victories at
Burn ham Pavilion. After a nail-biting five-game

affair against USC on Feb. 10, the Stanford spik
ers rolled over BYU on Friday nightlO-15,15-11,
15-6,15-8, then swept UC-Irvlne out the door on
Saturday 15-12,15-5,15-10.
This weekend not only saw the Cardinal im
prove to 6-1 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion play, but also marked the emergence of sopho
more swing hitter Devin Poolman and freshman
swing hitter Joshua Palacios as significant con
tributors.
"This was a real breakthrough for Poolman and
Josh," said Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves.
"We were able to find two more players who can
play significant roles in big matches.'"
There was also more strong play from junior
middle blocker Brian Moore, who finished with 38
kills on the weekend. Junior opposite Matt Fuer-

bringer and sophomore Keenan
Whitehurst also played key roles in
vanquishing the Cougars on Friday
with their outstanding play.
But there was more than just

strong play to fuel the Cardinal on
Friday, as the men were looking to
snap a three-match losing streak
against BYU. Unfortunately, as has
been the pattern, Stanford got off
slowly in game one. After a block by
junior setter Stewart Chong and
Moore gave the Cardinal a 1-0 lead,
BYU ran ofT five straight points.
Riding the strength of the freshman
Oswald Antonetti's jump-serving,
the Cougars surged ahead 13-4 on
back-to-back service aces by An
tonetti and sophomore outside hit
ter Steve Hinds.
"[Theyl really got us in trouble
with their jump serves," Nieves
said. "It took a while to adjust."
At this juncture, Poolman came
in and provided a strong boost to
Stanford's sagging spirits. His
serves forced BYU into erratic pass
ing that allowed the Cardinal to
storm within 14-10. That was as
close as they got, however, as Stan
ford forced one out of bounds on
game point.
The Cardinal continued its mo
mentum by bursting out to a 6-1
lead in the second game. The
Cougars rallied to tie matters up at
6-6, but Stanford kept its compo
sure. The men stayed even until
Chong smashed an ace down the
right sideline to put them up for
good, 10-9. Poolman's kill and Fuer
bringer's block knotted the teams
up at one game apiece.
Games three and four turned t he
match into a runaway as Stanford
put on a clinic on how to demoralize
your opponent. Stanford got out to
leads of 5-0, 10-3 and 14-4 before
Moore put the stamp on the third
game with a thunderous block.
"He was awfully good tonight at
tacking the ball," Nieves said.
With the Cougars reeling, game
four displayed more brilliant play by
the Cardinal spikers. A ki 11 by White
hurst staked them to an 8-2 lead lx>-
fore BYU made one last, futile run.
They were able to get within 13-8 on
a kill by freshman middle blocker
Ryan Millar. However, their eight
errors in game four were too much to
overcome as Antonetti forced one
out of bounds on match point.
Whitehurst finished with 20 kills
and no errors in 26 attempts for a
blistering .769 hitting percentage.
"When you have that many at
tempts without an error, you are
very valuable to your team," Nieves
said. "It's making the opponents
earn their points."
Fuerbringer, displaying less and
less trouble with his previously-in
jured shoulder, ended up with 31
kills in 52 attempts.

"He really hit the ball better than
in any other previous week," Nieves
said. "But I think we'll start saying
that more and more as his shoulder
improves."
Irvine provided more game-one
blues for the Cardinal on Saturday.
The Anteaters raced out to a 4-1
lead, and to make matters worse,
Whitehurst was sidelined from the
match by a sprained ankle. The
Stanford reserves came to the res
cue once again as junior middle
blocker Mike Hoefer filled in ad
mirably, contributing nine kills in
the match. This change allowed
Stanford to take charge and surge
ahead 8-5.
