One nice thing about sports is
that no matter how badly you lose
one day, the score still begins at 0-

0 the next.
After suffering its worst defeat
of the season in the form of a 16-1
drubbing at the hands of Fresno
State on Friday night, the No. 2
Stanford baseball team rebounded
to win the weekend series two
games to one.
After two frustrating losses last
week, Stanford (9-5) entered Fres
no (5-8) looking to turn things
around. Unfortunately, the team
would endure one more frustrat
ing night before getting back in
the win column.
"Everything came apart," said
senior left fielder Cale Carter of
the loss. "We didn't hit, pitch or
play defense well. It was a culmi
nation of things, going from bad to
worse. It was a bad game, but it
gave us a kick in the pants and we

came out fighting the next two
days."
According to relief pitcher
Brendan Sullivan, not much need
ed to be said after Friday night's
embarrassment.
"We tried not to panic — we lost
two disappointing games last
week, and we felt like we had
talked too much about them," Sul
livan said. "After Friday, we let it
go unsaid. We had tried to overan
alyze things, but we needed to just
take care of business. We needed
somebody to pick us up, and sever
al people did on Saturday and Sun
day."
On Sunday, the Cardinal de
feated the Bulldogs by a score of 9-
5 in the rubber match of the series.

Freshman Chad Hutchinson
started the game for Stanford, giv
ing up three runs in four innings
of work. Sullivan (1-0) picked up
the win in relief, going three in
nings, surrendering one run and
five hits while striking out one.
"I felt really good," Sullivan
said. "That was my longest outing
of the season — it's been a while
since I've thrown that much. It
was a bit sloppier than I would
have liked. I allowed too many
baserunners. But I'm happy with
the job I did. We're there to set up
Tommy [Reimers], give him the
ball and let him nail it down."
Offensively, the Cardinal was
led by Carter, who collected three
hits and two RBIs on the day.
Brian Dallimore, Jon Schaeffer,
Jody Gerut and Josh Hochgesang
each had two of Stanford's 13 hits.
Dallimore also added two RBIs.
Carter said a more relaxed ap
proach at the plate was the key to
his offensive success this week
end.
"I finally felt comfortable up
there," said Carter, a first-team
All-Pacific 10 Conference selec
tion last year. "I haven't produced
nearly as much as I'd like to this
vear. I hadn't been able to find a

comfort zone where I could just
relax and see the ball. [This week
end! I had better focus and con
centration on hitting the ball
hard. I think I'd been trying to do
too much."
Sunday's victory came one day
after freshman right-hander Jeff
Austin (2-1) baffled the Bulldog's
bats in a 6-0 Stanford victory.
Austin tossed 7 1/3 scoreless in
nings, striking out seven in the
process. Junior Tom Reimers con
tinued to pitch well, keeping Fres
no State off the scoreboard in the
final 12/3 innings of the game. The
shutout was the third for the Car
dinal pitching staff this season.
Stanford pounded out 14 hits in
Saturday's affair, led by three
apiece from Joe Kilburg, Troy
Kent and Eric Sees. Kent connect
ed on his first home run of the
year, a solo shot. Carter also had a
solid day at the plate, going 2-for-5
with a run scored and two RBIs.
Saturday's success was much
needed after the debacle wit
nessed by coach Mark Marquess
on Friday. In the series opener,
things went the Bulldogs' way all
night, as they touched up Cardinal
starter Kyle Peterson (2-2) for
three runs in the third inning and
one in the fourth before chasing
him in the fifth. Peterson, who
was solid in his two previous out
ings, gave up seven runs (five
earned) in 4 1/3 innings.

Peterson's pitching line was
one of Stanford's cleanest when
all was said and done.
Relievers Tony Cogan, Adam
Harris and Brent Hoard gave up
nine runs in a combined three in
nings of work before Sullivan
stopped the bleeding, recording
the final two outs of the game.
Opposing starter JefT Weaver
had little difficulty on the mound
against the Cardinal bats, throw
ing a complete-game four-hitter.
Weaver walked two and struck out
six Stanford hitters. An unearned
run scored by Luke Quaccia in the
seventh kept Weaver from notch
ing a shutout.
The victories Saturday and
Sunday will help the team's confi
dence heading into conference
play this week, as both the pitch
ing and the offense enjoyed suc
cess.
"After Friday, we were able to
put a couple of good games togeth
er," Sullivan said. "We'd like to
get a good streak going."
The Cardinal was denied a
chance to keep that streak rolling
when yesterday's scheduled con
test with Washington State at
Sunken Diamond was rained out.
It was the second cancellation due
to weather conditions this season.
Stanford will head south this
weekend to play a three-game set
against UCLA in the Six-Pac
opener.
