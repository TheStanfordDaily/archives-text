One nice thing about sports is
that no matter how badly you lose
one day, the score still begins at 0-

0 the next.
After suffering its worst defeat
of the season in the form of a 16-1
drubbing at the hands of Fresno
State on Friday night, the No. 2
Stanford baseball team rebounded
to win the weekend series two
games to one.
After two frustrating losses last
week, Stanford (9-5) entered Fres
no (5-8) looking to turn things
around. Unfortunately, the team
would endure one more frustrat
ing night before getting back in
the win column.
"Everything came apart," said
senior left fielder Cale Carter of
the loss. "We didn't hit, pitch or
play defense well. It was a culmi
nation of things, going from bad to
worse. It was a bad game, but it
gave us a kick in the pants and we

came out fighting the next two
days."
According to relief pitcher
Brendan Sullivan, not much need
ed to be said after Friday night's
embarrassment.
"We tried not to panic â€” we lost
two disappointing games last
week, and we felt like we had
talked too much about them," Sul
livan said. "After Friday, we let it
go unsaid. We had tried to overan
alyze things, but we needed to just
take care of business. We needed
somebody to pick us up, and sever
al people did on Saturday and Sun
day."
On Sunday, the Cardinal de
feated the Bulldogs by a score of 9-
5 in the rubber match of the series.
