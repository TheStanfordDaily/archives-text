Stanford 62
Oregon 64

Round one may have gone to Brevin
Knight a month ago, but Oregon's
Kenya Wilkins came back with a knock
out punch of his own Saturday after
noon when he hit a last-second shot to
give the Ducks a 64-62 win over the
20th-ranked Cardinal.
After Dion Cross' two free throws tied
the game at 62 with seven seconds left,
Wilkins made a double-clutch, leaning
19-footer at the buzzer with Knight in
his face. The shot gave Wilkins 30 points
for the game, tying a career-high and
matching the total Knight scored on him
a month ago.
"I really thought it was short, be
cause I had to hold back," Wilkins said.

"I had to wait for him to get past me. I
saw him lay a little off me and I let it fly."
Wilkins said he had difficulty seeing
the shot clock as he began dribbling
down the middle of the court for the final
shot. When he veered left, he saw he had
misjudged the clock and quickly got the
shot off.
"I got him to change it — he double
clutched," Knight said. "I knew he was
going to pull up at some point, I wanted
to keep him to the left to give me a better
chance at changing the shot. He did
everything I wanted him to do except the
final result."
The loss snapped Stanford's six-game
winning streak and once again proved
that Oregon's McArthur Court is the
toughest place in the conference to play.
Stanford dropped to 16-6 overall, 9-4 in
the Pacific 10 Conference, falling two
games behind UCLA in the title race.
Oregon moved to 13-11, 6-7.
The 5-foot-10 Wilkins had his way
against the Cardinal all afternoon, hit-

ting 13 of 19 shots and two of
three three-pointers. Since Stan
ford's 94-74 win over Oregon Jan.
18, Wilkins had been shooting 26
percent from the field, averaging
only nine points over that eight
game stretch. He had also made
just 2 of 18 three-pointers.
"I came into this game think
ing 85 percent defense — I was
not thinking offense," Wilkins
said. "I was thinking I'd take four
or five shots, but then I got into a
groove."
Knight, who said he looks for
ward to playing Wilkins because
of their similar size and style, had
trouble finding his shot against
the strong Duck defense. Knight
was held to seven points on 2-of
-10 shooting and had five
turnovers to Wilkins' one.
"We had a hard time getting
clean looks," head coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We didn't get
any great individual perfor
mances and they had Wilkins —
that's what it took in this game."
With the Cardinal struggling
to hit open shots, Stanford turned
to a fifth-year senior and a fresh
man to carry the offensive bur
den. Andy Poppink was a work
horse on the low blocks while Kris

Weems did his best Dion Cross
imitation by hitting four of five
from the three-point line. Both
ended the game with 16 points,
and Poppink led all rebounders
with 11.
Oregon held Stanford to 36.5
percent shooting from the field,
the Cardinal's worst shooting
game since a 34.4 percent perfor
mance in a 64-56 loss to UCLA 12
games ago. Cross was harassed
into 3-of-13 shooting (l-for-5
from three-point range).
"They denied me the ball all
the time," Cross said. "Kris
Weems stepped up. Without him,
we probably wouldn't have been
close to tying it."
Entering the game with 8 min
utes, 46 seconds left in the first
half with the Cardinal down 17-
16, Weems scored nine points in a
2:26 span, part of a 10-2 Stanford
run. The 26-19 Cardinal lead did
not last, however, and Stanford
went into halftime with a slim 32-
31 advantage.
"We just couldn't get away
from them," Poppink said. "We
were still in it playing our ass off
until the final buzzer."
Montgomery was disappointed
with Stanford's overall defensive
effort, noting how inattention to
the ball allowed Oregon to score
on several back-cuts and offensive
tip-ins.

The second half was a see-saw
affair, with neither team leading
by more than four at any one
point. After Stanford took a
three-point lead on a breakaway
dunk by Cross, Oregon answered
with back-to-back buckets, but
the Cardinal clawed back to tie
with Cross's clutch free throws.
At that point, all eyes focused on
Wilkins.
"He played his heart out,"
Knight said. "Today he showed
how good a point guard he is."
Despite the rough outing,
Knight did manage to set the
school all-time steals record,
breaking Keith Ramee's 10-year
old record of 199. Knight has 201
steals in less than three years of
play.
As for the disappointing loss,
Stanford players had different
takes on how the setback would
affect them. While Weems said he
thought the game would have
helped the team maintain mo
mentum until the NCAA Tourna
ment, the more experienced Cross
had a more reserved outlook.
"It's a road loss, it's not like
losing at home," he said. "I think
that this loss might not hurt us as
much as we probably think it's
going to hurt, as long as we get
those two at home [Washington
State and Washington this week
end] and beat the Arizonas."

ford's 94-74 win over Oregon Jan.
18, Wilkins had been shooting 26
percent from the field, averaging
only nine points over that eight
game stretch. He had also made
just 2 of 18 three-pointers.
"I came into this game think
ing 85 percent defense — I was
not thinking offense," Wilkins
said. "I was thinking I'd take four
or five shots, but then I got into a
groove."
Knight, who said he looks for
ward to playing Wilkins because
of their similar size and style, had
trouble finding his shot against
the strong Duck defense. Knight
was held to seven points on 2-of
-10 shooting and had five
turnovers to Wilkins' one.
"We had a hard time getting
clean looks," head coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We didn't get
any great individual perfor
mances and they had Wilkins —
that's what it took in this game."
With the Cardinal struggling
to hit open shots, Stanford turned
to a fifth-year senior and a fresh
man to carry the offensive bur
den. Andy Poppink was a work
horse on the low blocks while Kris

Weems did his best Dion Cross
imitation by hitting four of five
from the three-point line. Both
ended the game with 16 points,
and Poppink led all rebounders
with 11.
Oregon held Stanford to 36.5
percent shooting from the field,
the Cardinal's worst shooting
game since a 34.4 percent perfor
mance in a 64-56 loss to UCLA 12
games ago. Cross was harassed
into 3-of-13 shooting (l-for-5
from three-point range).
"They denied me the ball all
the time," Cross said. "Kris
Weems stepped up. Without him,
we probably wouldn't have been
close to tying it."
Entering the game with 8 min
utes, 46 seconds left in the first
half with the Cardinal down 17-
16, Weems scored nine points in a
2:26 span, part of a 10-2 Stanford
run. The 26-19 Cardinal lead did
not last, however, and Stanford
went into halftime with a slim 32-
31 advantage.
"We just couldn't get away
from them," Poppink said. "We
were still in it playing our ass off
until the final buzzer."
Montgomery was disappointed
with Stanford's overall defensive
effort, noting how inattention to
the ball allowed Oregon to score
on several back-cuts and offensive
tip-ins.

The second half was a see-saw
affair, with neither team leading
by more than four at any one
point. After Stanford took a
three-point lead on a breakaway
dunk by Cross, Oregon answered
with back-to-back buckets, but
the Cardinal clawed back to tie
with Cross's clutch free throws.
At that point, all eyes focused on
Wilkins.
"He played his heart out,"
Knight said. "Today he showed
how good a point guard he is."
Despite the rough outing,
Knight did manage to set the
school all-time steals record,
breaking Keith Ramee's 10-year
old record of 199. Knight has 201
steals in less than three years of
play.
As for the disappointing loss,
Stanford players had different
takes on how the setback would
affect them. While Weems said he
thought the game would have
helped the team maintain mo
mentum until the NCAA Tourna
ment, the more experienced Cross
had a more reserved outlook.
"It's a road loss, it's not like
losing at home," he said. "I think
that this loss might not hurt us as
much as we probably think it's
going to hurt, as long as we get
those two at home [Washington
State and Washington this week
end] and beat the Arizonas."
