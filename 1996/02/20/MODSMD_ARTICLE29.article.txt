Stanford 62
Oregon 64

Round one may have gone to Brevin
Knight a month ago, but Oregon's
Kenya Wilkins came back with a knock
out punch of his own Saturday after
noon when he hit a last-second shot to
give the Ducks a 64-62 win over the
20th-ranked Cardinal.
After Dion Cross' two free throws tied
the game at 62 with seven seconds left,
Wilkins made a double-clutch, leaning
19-footer at the buzzer with Knight in
his face. The shot gave Wilkins 30 points
for the game, tying a career-high and
matching the total Knight scored on him
a month ago.
"I really thought it was short, be
cause I had to hold back," Wilkins said.

"I had to wait for him to get past me. I
saw him lay a little off me and I let it fly."
Wilkins said he had difficulty seeing
the shot clock as he began dribbling
down the middle of the court for the final
shot. When he veered left, he saw he had
misjudged the clock and quickly got the
shot off.
"I got him to change it â€” he double
clutched," Knight said. "I knew he was
going to pull up at some point, I wanted
to keep him to the left to give me a better
chance at changing the shot. He did
everything I wanted him to do except the
final result."
The loss snapped Stanford's six-game
winning streak and once again proved
that Oregon's McArthur Court is the
toughest place in the conference to play.
Stanford dropped to 16-6 overall, 9-4 in
the Pacific 10 Conference, falling two
games behind UCLA in the title race.
Oregon moved to 13-11, 6-7.

against the Cardinal all afternoon, hit-
