# Casper, ASSU can't relate
## Student leaders question whether new bills can remedy communication gap between ASSU and admimistration 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
Two new bills to reform the ASSU's govern
ing structure have raised questions about how
best to patch up a communication gap between
ASSU leaders and University President Gerhard
Casper.
"I would say [the relationship] is a one-way di
alogue of us trying to talk," said Council of Pres
idents member Jon Oram. "It is a symbol of how
we are treated that we are not recognized as le
gitimate."

Oram cited an offhand comment that Casper
made at a recent ASSU Senate meeting — to the
effect that the ASSU lacked a real mandate to
represent students — as one reason to think that
the president does not take the ASSU seriously.
"Our relationship with Casper is not a close
working relationship," said COP member Rich
Stolz. "Our goals don't often coincide."
Casper, in response to such criticism, assert
ed his desire to work with the ASSU.
"I feel we have gradually established a solid,
working relationship," Casper said in an inter
view. "I think it is incredibly important for us to
have a forum of that kind."

At issue are two bills proposed in the last two
weeks to replace the current four-member COP
with various versions of a single presidency.
While some senators say the reform is necessary
to achieve better communication with the ad
ministration, Assistant to the President Jean
Fetter said the constant change is itself an ob
stacle to dialogue.
"The ASSU itself is struggling with its own
internal reforms. There is an identity crisis going
on in the ASSU," Fetter said.
Oram said the changes proposed by there-
