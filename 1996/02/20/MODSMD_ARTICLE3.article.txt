# Casper, ASSU can't relate
## Student leaders question whether new bills can remedy communication gap between ASSU and admimistration 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
Two new bills to reform the ASSU's govern
ing structure have raised questions about how
best to patch up a communication gap between
ASSU leaders and University President Gerhard
Casper.
"I would say [the relationship] is a one-way di
alogue of us trying to talk," said Council of Pres
idents member Jon Oram. "It is a symbol of how
we are treated that we are not recognized as le
gitimate."

Oram cited an offhand comment that Casper
made at a recent ASSU Senate meeting — to the
effect that the ASSU lacked a real mandate to
represent students — as one reason to think that
the president does not take the ASSU seriously.
"Our relationship with Casper is not a close
working relationship," said COP member Rich
Stolz. "Our goals don't often coincide."
Casper, in response to such criticism, assert
ed his desire to work with the ASSU.
"I feel we have gradually established a solid,
working relationship," Casper said in an inter
view. "I think it is incredibly important for us to
have a forum of that kind."

At issue are two bills proposed in the last two
weeks to replace the current four-member COP
with various versions of a single presidency.
While some senators say the reform is necessary
to achieve better communication with the ad
ministration, Assistant to the President Jean
Fetter said the constant change is itself an ob
stacle to dialogue.
"The ASSU itself is struggling with its own
internal reforms. There is an identity crisis going
on in the ASSU," Fetter said.
Oram said the changes proposed by there-


Casper
form bills could help achieve better
communication with Casper.
"It is hard to deal with a council,"
said Oram, the author of a bill, now
withdrawn, which would have
changed the structure of the COP to
one president and three vice presi
dents. "Sometimes people show up.
Sometimes they don't. There's no
congruity."
The current COP is divided
amongst itself as to whether a one
president system would solve com
munication problems.
Stolz and COP member Nicole
Vazquez have both spoken out
against switching to a single presi
dent, saying they favor the current
system.
Though Casper has said the
ASSU is not necessarily representa
tive of student views, he also said its
existence is necessary to officially
represent the student body and
took no decisive stand on the issue
of ASSU reform.
Another potential example of
poor communication came when
Casper proposed reform to the Uni

versity's judicial charter, which cov
ers the University's policy for viola
tions of the Honor Code or the Fun
damental Standard, at a recent sen
ate meeting.
At the meeting, a number of is
sues were raised by senators who
questioned Casper on the need for
reform.
"The process as it is now is bur
densome," said Oram, "but I don't
know if there is evidence for chang
ing it fundamentally. We are missing
a preponderance of evidence which
the ASSU Senate has to have."
Casper said at the meeting that
he will form the Committee of 15, a
body independent of the ASSU
which is constitutionally responsi
ble for any review of the Universi
ty's judicial charter, to enact the re
form.
"I hope the ASSU will make a
major contribution to the process of
judicial reform," he said.
Some administrators and stu
dents say the charges directed at
Casper are indicative of larger com
munication problems with the Uni
versity administration as a whole.
"I think it is an unreasonable ex
pectation that the president is the
only one who can work with stu
dents," said Fetter. "We need a lot

of interaction through different av
enues."
But one senator complained that
those other avenues have simply
been shut.
"Our relationship with the ad
ministration has deteriorated to a
point where everything that hap
pens has been pinpointed to
Casper," said undergraduate sena
tor Angela Parker. "I think it is im
portant to remember that he is just
a symbol and that we need to repair
the relationship."
Casper said his relationship with
the ASSU has evolved over the
years, from his first year as presi
dent when there was no COP.
"The ASSU has always been de
pendent upon student interest at
any given time," he said. "It is not
always representative of the stu
dent body."
He emphasized the problems of
attempting to make contact with all
aspects of the University.
"I cannot personally interact
with 14,000 students," hesaid. "I'm
looking to the ASSU to aggregate
student views and establish clear
priorities."
Casper attends one senate meet
ing every quarter and has met with
the COP once this year.
