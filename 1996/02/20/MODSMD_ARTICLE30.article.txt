# Men's tennis drops Cal
## Win streak at 34 after 4-2 victory over Bears 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
Stanford 4

The Stanford men's tennis team ex
tended its nation's-best win streak to 34
matches on Sunday afternoon with a 4-2
victory over California at the Varsity Ten
nis Courts. The Cardinal, 7-0 on the year
(1-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference), has not
dropped a match since the finals of the
1994 NCAA championships, a 4-3 loss to
use.
Currently No.l in the collegiate rank
ings, Stanford is showing every intention
of repeating as national champs. Despite
facing some very stiff competition already
this year — most notably No. 13 Fresno
State and No. 14 Cal — the men have
cruised to a 7-0 start without losing more
than two points in any of their matches.
Senior captain Jeff Salzenstein has
been instrumental in the Cardinal's suc
cess. Conspicuously absent from the
team's Valentine's day match against
Washington due to illness, "Salzy" was
back in full force against Cal. He trounced
Cal's top player, Michael Hill, 6-1, 6-2, in
the first singles match.
"Obviously the match went the way I
wanted it to go," Salzenstein said. "I had
lost two straight matches to Hill, so I felt I

I had something to prove. I tried
to stay focused and did a good job
of that."
Head coach Dick Gould also
noted his top player's focus, par
ticularly his serve and service re
turn. "Jeff is playing with a lot of
confidence," Gould said. "He's
using his serve very well, and
that starts off half the points in a
match. He's also returning very
well. If you don't hit a good serve,
he'll really punish you for it. And
returning starts off the other
half of the points. He's dictating
a lot of points out there."
Since he was upset by Min
nesota's Lars Hjarrand on Feb.
3, Salzenstein has won seven
straight matches against top
notch competition without drop
ping a single set.

'I've been improving
and playing well. I
feel I can beat just
about anyone in
college right now.'
— Jeff Salzenstein

That stretch includes a tour
nament title at the Rolex Indoor
Championships held last week in
Dallas. The Rolex Tournament is
oneof three grand slam events on
the collegiate circuit and features
32 of the country's top players.
Salzenstein never lost more
than six games in any one of his
matches on the way to the title.
In the final, he soundly knocked
off USC's Cecil Mamitt, current
ly the No. 10 collegiate player in
the nation, 6-2, 6-4. ESPN will
air a highlight show from the
tournament — which also fea
tured sophomore Paul Goldstein,
freshman Ryan YVolters and se
nior Jim Thomas — at 11 a.m.
this Friday.
"I have a lot of confidence in
my game right now," Salzenstein
said. "During the last month of
practice and the past few match
es, I've been improving and play
ing well. I feel I can beat just
about anyone in college right
now."
Sophomore Paul Goldstein

stepped in at the second singles
position against Cal, where he
faced a very feisty Casey Louie.
Goldstein was aggressive early,
jumping out to a 6-2 victory in
the first set and then taking a 5-2
lead in the second. During that
second set, Goldstein had a num
ber of match points, but Louie
defended each of them and won
the set in a tie-breaker, 7-6. Dis
appointed in himself for allowing
the second set to slip away, Gold
stein dropped the third set 6-3,
giving Louie a hard-earned victo
ry-
It was the third consecutive
loss for Goldstein, but Gould in
sists that his 16th-ranked star
sophomore is playing good ten
nis. "He's playing well, and he's
playing the way I want him to
play," Gould said. "Unfortunate
ly, he just hasn't come up with
the results."
In the third singles match,
freshman Ryan Wolters recov
ered from a poor first set to de
feat Bobby Mahal, 5-7, 6-2, 6-1.
"Ryan got better as the match
wore on. It was good to see him
raise his level of play after that
first set," Gould said.
Senior Jim Thomas continued
his excellent play in the fourth
singles position, winning easily
6-2, 6-1. The victory preserved
Thomas' perfect record in dual
match competition at 6-0.
Junior Grant Elliott lost his
first dual match of the year in the
fifth singles slot. After losing the
first set, he battled back to win
the second, but ended up losing
in three, 6-3, 1-6, 6-4. The loss
was surprising only because El
liott has played so well in the
fifth spot this year.
"Grant's not going to lose
many matches," Gould said.
"He's tough as nails."
Senior Ricky Becker once
again needed three sets to knock
off his opponent, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3. "It
was nice to see Ricky stay in his
match and come away with a
win," Gould said. Becker is unde
feated in dual match play with a
7-0 mark.
Rain forced the cancellation of
the doubles matches with the
Cardinal leading 4-2.
The men will travel to the Na
tional Team Indoor Champi
onships in Louisville, Ky., later
this week. Stanford's perfor
mance in Louisville should set
the tone for the rest of the year
and for the NCAA champi

Chris Maliwat — Daily
Senior Ricky Becker serves one up during
his 4-6,6-1,6-3 win over Cal's David Sutton.
I had something to prove. I tried
to stay focused and did a good job
of that."
Head coach Dick Gould also
noted his top player's focus, par
ticularly his serve and service re
turn. "Jeff is playing with a lot of
confidence," Gould said. "He's
using his serve very well, and
that starts off half the points in a
match. He's also returning very
well. If you don't hit a good serve,
he'll really punish you for it. And
returning starts off the other
half of the points. He's dictating
a lot of points out there."
Since he was upset by Min
nesota's Lars Hjarrand on Feb.
3, Salzenstein has won seven
straight matches against top
notch competition without drop
ping a single set.

'I've been improving
and playing well. I
feel I can beat just
about anyone in
college right now.'
— Jeff Salzenstein

That stretch includes a tour
nament title at the Rolex Indoor
Championships held last week in
Dallas. The Rolex Tournament is
oneof three grand slam events on
the collegiate circuit and features
32 of the country's top players.
Salzenstein never lost more
than six games in any one of his
matches on the way to the title.
In the final, he soundly knocked
off USC's Cecil Mamitt, current
ly the No. 10 collegiate player in
the nation, 6-2, 6-4. ESPN will
air a highlight show from the
tournament — which also fea
tured sophomore Paul Goldstein,
freshman Ryan YVolters and se
nior Jim Thomas — at 11 a.m.
this Friday.
"I have a lot of confidence in
my game right now," Salzenstein
said. "During the last month of
practice and the past few match
es, I've been improving and play
ing well. I feel I can beat just
about anyone in college right
now."
Sophomore Paul Goldstein

stepped in at the second singles
position against Cal, where he
faced a very feisty Casey Louie.
Goldstein was aggressive early,
jumping out to a 6-2 victory in
the first set and then taking a 5-2
lead in the second. During that
second set, Goldstein had a num
ber of match points, but Louie
defended each of them and won
the set in a tie-breaker, 7-6. Dis
appointed in himself for allowing
the second set to slip away, Gold
stein dropped the third set 6-3,
giving Louie a hard-earned victo
ry-
It was the third consecutive
loss for Goldstein, but Gould in
sists that his 16th-ranked star
sophomore is playing good ten
nis. "He's playing well, and he's
playing the way I want him to
play," Gould said. "Unfortunate
ly, he just hasn't come up with
the results."
In the third singles match,
freshman Ryan Wolters recov
ered from a poor first set to de
feat Bobby Mahal, 5-7, 6-2, 6-1.
"Ryan got better as the match
wore on. It was good to see him
raise his level of play after that
first set," Gould said.
Senior Jim Thomas continued
his excellent play in the fourth
singles position, winning easily
6-2, 6-1. The victory preserved
Thomas' perfect record in dual
match competition at 6-0.
Junior Grant Elliott lost his
first dual match of the year in the
fifth singles slot. After losing the
first set, he battled back to win
the second, but ended up losing
in three, 6-3, 1-6, 6-4. The loss
was surprising only because El
liott has played so well in the
fifth spot this year.
"Grant's not going to lose
many matches," Gould said.
"He's tough as nails."
Senior Ricky Becker once
again needed three sets to knock
off his opponent, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3. "It
was nice to see Ricky stay in his
match and come away with a
win," Gould said. Becker is unde
feated in dual match play with a
7-0 mark.
Rain forced the cancellation of
the doubles matches with the
Cardinal leading 4-2.
The men will travel to the Na
tional Team Indoor Champi
onships in Louisville, Ky., later
this week. Stanford's perfor
mance in Louisville should set
the tone for the rest of the year
and for the NCAA champi
onships in May.
