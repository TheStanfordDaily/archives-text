The Stanford women's tennis team survived its
first real challenge of the 1996 season this Presi
dent's Day weekend to extend its unblemished dual
match record to 8-0. After defeating Arizona in its
closest match of the season on Friday, the Cardinal
returned to the Varsity Tennis Courts Saturday af
ternoon to dispose of the Arizona State Sun Devils.
Sophomore Ania Bleszynski, who was knocked out
in the early rounds of the Rolex Indoor Champi
onships last week in Dallas, reestablished her domi
nance at the No. 1 spot with a convincing win over
ASU's Reka Cseresnyes 6-3, 6-1. Bleszynski took one
service break in the first set and two in the second
and was unbeatable on her own serve to put the
match out of reach. The match was especially impor
tant to Bleszynski coming off a loss to Arizona's
Vicky Maes (6-2,6-3) in Friday's match.
"I was more focused and ready to play [against
Cseresnyes]," Bleszynski said. "She didn't play as
well as she can, but I was happy with the way I
played."
Junior Sandra De Silva made quick work of ASU's
Katy Propstra, winning the match 6-0, 6-2 in just
under an hour of play. De Silva was perfect through
the first 10 games, taking an early lead 6-0,4-0. In the
following game, Propstra managed to hold serve to
bring the score to 4-1. She also held serve at 5-1, but
De Silva closed out the match on her own serve to
take the victory 6-0, 6-2.
De Silva's straight-set victory was so short that,
on the adjacent court, junior Katie Schlukebir had
not yet finished the first set of her match against
Stephanie Lansdorp by the conclusion of De Silva's.
Schlukebir fought tooth and nail through a nerve
racking three-set match before succumbing to Lans
dorp 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-2.
