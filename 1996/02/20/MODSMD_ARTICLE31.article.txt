## 8-0 Cardinal squeaks by Arizona, clobbers Arizona State Stanford 6 Arizona 3

Stanford 7
Arizona State 1

The Stanford women's tennis team survived its
first real challenge of the 1996 season this Presi
dent's Day weekend to extend its unblemished dual
match record to 8-0. After defeating Arizona in its
closest match of the season on Friday, the Cardinal
returned to the Varsity Tennis Courts Saturday af
ternoon to dispose of the Arizona State Sun Devils.
Sophomore Ania Bleszynski, who was knocked out
in the early rounds of the Rolex Indoor Champi
onships last week in Dallas, reestablished her domi
nance at the No. 1 spot with a convincing win over
ASU's Reka Cseresnyes 6-3, 6-1. Bleszynski took one
service break in the first set and two in the second
and was unbeatable on her own serve to put the
match out of reach. The match was especially impor
tant to Bleszynski coming off a loss to Arizona's
Vicky Maes (6-2,6-3) in Friday's match.
"I was more focused and ready to play [against
Cseresnyes]," Bleszynski said. "She didn't play as
well as she can, but I was happy with the way I
played."
Junior Sandra De Silva made quick work of ASU's
Katy Propstra, winning the match 6-0, 6-2 in just
under an hour of play. De Silva was perfect through
the first 10 games, taking an early lead 6-0,4-0. In the
following game, Propstra managed to hold serve to
bring the score to 4-1. She also held serve at 5-1, but
De Silva closed out the match on her own serve to
take the victory 6-0, 6-2.
De Silva's straight-set victory was so short that,
on the adjacent court, junior Katie Schlukebir had
not yet finished the first set of her match against
Stephanie Lansdorp by the conclusion of De Silva's.
Schlukebir fought tooth and nail through a nerve
racking three-set match before succumbing to Lans
dorp 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-2.

during her win over ASU's Reka Cseresnyes.

Schlukebir's match lasted ap
proximately 2 1/2 hours, causing
the No. 1 doubles match between
Schlukebir and Bleszynski and
Propstra and Lansdorp to be can
celed. The No. 2 and No. 3 doubles
matches ended at the same time as
the Schlukebir-Lansdorp singles
match, and with the Cardinal
leading 7-1, both teams decided to
forgo the match.
"Katie and Ania played well
yesterday," head coach Frank
Brennan said. "So it relieved the
urgency of needing to play a match
today."
As for the Cardinal's other dou
bles teams, sophomore Julie Scott
and senior Kim Shasby defeated
the Sun Devils' No. 2 team of
Cseresnyes and Anna Moll. Scott
and Shasby were down early 2-4 in

that match, but won four straight
games to go up 6-4. Once in the
driver's seat, Scott and Shasby
held on for a 8-5 win.
Shasby also faced Moll in sin
gles at the No. 4 position, but Moll
proved to be no match for the se
nior as Shasby cruised to a 6-1, 6-3
victory. Shasby's partner fared
just as well against ASU's Torey
Pratt, as Scott won easily, 6-1,6-0.
Senior Amy Chiminello and ju
nior Emily Burt rounded out the
competition for the Cardinal. The
two teamed up at the No. 3 dou
bles spot and gave up just two
games to Pratt and Julie Cop
pinger in an 8-2 rout. Chiminello
also defeated Coppinger at the No.
6 singles position 6-4, 6-1.
The competition was a little
tougher in Friday's match against
the Wildcats. For the first time in
the 1996 season, the Cardinal did
not enter the doubles competition
with the match sewn up. Stanford
took four of the six singles match

es, meaning that Arizona could
sweep the doubles competition to
win the match. Unfortunately for
the Wildcats, they only managed
one win. Karen Goldstein and
Stephanie Sammaritano pulled off
a victorv over Scott and Shasby 8-
4.
In the other doubles matches,
Bleszynski and Schlukebir defeat
ed Maes and Kristen Pietrucha 8-
4, while Burt and Chiminello won
big over Betsy Miringoff and
Monique Allegre 8-4 to give the
Cardinal a 6-3 victory.
Brennan was pleased with the
performance of the team and
noted that the tougher competi
tion was good preparation for the
National Team Indoor Champi
onships in Madison, Wis. this
week.
"This was a good weekend,"
Brennan said. "The girls respond
ed very well. I feel much better
about going to Madison with good,
solid competition [behind us]."
