## Stanford scores a big win in regular-season finale 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
The Stanford men's swimming
team wrapped up the Pacific 10
Conference dual meet season Sat
urday afternoon with a resound
ing win over California, as the
Cardinal won 14 of 16 events and
took the top three spots in four.
With several individuals and
groups of swimmers turning in
impressive performances, the
meet provided a surge of confi
dence for the swimmers' mental
preparation for the championship
meets in March.

"We went above and beyond
our expectations," said senior
Scott Gagner. "We usually sort of
wish that everyone will swim well
at this meet, but many times peo
ple are in a point in their taper
that doesn't allow them to swim
fast. That didn't seem to be the
case Saturday. We had fast times
all across the board."
Most of the Cardinal swim
mers saw this final meet as an op
portunity to complete the fine
tuning they will need to be ready
for March.
"We call it being task-orient
ed," said senior co-captain Ray

Carey. "Everyone had tasks they
wanted to do to fine-tune and
those things were done. Our
strength in the past has been an
emphasis on technique and it will
be this year, too. Everyone's
ready to have the best meets of
their life."
The swimmers spent the week
before the match going over strat
egy and technique with one of
their assistant coaches and it
showed on Saturday.
"There was a lot of good race
strategy work and technique
work that was perfected," Gagner
said. "That's a victory in itself
over the times."
Perhaps the most impressive
aspect of the Cardinal's perfor
mance was the maturation of the
freshman class. Some seniors
praised the freshmen last week by
saying that they did not consider
them freshmen anymore, and on
Saturday the young swimmers
proved that they were up to the
task. Led by Tate Blahnik, who
had victories in both the 100- and
200-yard backstroke, four fresh
men had individual victories, and
another was a big part of Stan
ford's victory in the 400 free
relay.
"It was a pinnacle in what has
been an upward jump in perfor
mance for all of them," Gagner
said. "It's been wonderful to see
