# Men's swimming' mauls Cal
## Stanford scores a big win in regular-season finale 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
The Stanford men's swimming
team wrapped up the Pacific 10
Conference dual meet season Sat
urday afternoon with a resound
ing win over California, as the
Cardinal won 14 of 16 events and
took the top three spots in four.
With several individuals and
groups of swimmers turning in
impressive performances, the
meet provided a surge of confi
dence for the swimmers' mental
preparation for the championship
meets in March.

"We went above and beyond
our expectations," said senior
Scott Gagner. "We usually sort of
wish that everyone will swim well
at this meet, but many times peo
ple are in a point in their taper
that doesn't allow them to swim
fast. That didn't seem to be the
case Saturday. We had fast times
all across the board."
Most of the Cardinal swim
mers saw this final meet as an op
portunity to complete the fine
tuning they will need to be ready
for March.
"We call it being task-orient
ed," said senior co-captain Ray

Carey. "Everyone had tasks they
wanted to do to fine-tune and
those things were done. Our
strength in the past has been an
emphasis on technique and it will
be this year, too. Everyone's
ready to have the best meets of
their life."
The swimmers spent the week
before the match going over strat
egy and technique with one of
their assistant coaches and it
showed on Saturday.
"There was a lot of good race
strategy work and technique
work that was perfected," Gagner
said. "That's a victory in itself
over the times."
Perhaps the most impressive
aspect of the Cardinal's perfor
mance was the maturation of the
freshman class. Some seniors
praised the freshmen last week by
saying that they did not consider
them freshmen anymore, and on
Saturday the young swimmers
proved that they were up to the
task. Led by Tate Blahnik, who
had victories in both the 100- and
200-yard backstroke, four fresh
men had individual victories, and
another was a big part of Stan
ford's victory in the 400 free
relay.
"It was a pinnacle in what has
been an upward jump in perfor
mance for all of them," Gagner
said. "It's been wonderful to see

them building and building and
building and getting better and
better and better. But the best is
yet to come. They are going to
have a lot of confidence going into
the Pac-10 Invitational [March 1-
3). Blake [HoldenJ and Justin
[Ewers] still have to qualify for
NCAAs, and now they have the
confidence that they can and will
be part of the NCAA team."
Holden continued his strong
showings in the breaststroke with
a victory in the 200. Freshman
Matt O'Mara, who has fought ju
nior Kevin Radvany in the mile all
year, won the 500 free. O'Mara,
whose best event was probably
the mile, has adjusted to find an
event that he can score points in
at the dual meets, winning the
400 against USC and the 500 on
Saturday. Dod Wales, the final
freshman individual winner, tied
sophomore Chris Olson for first in
the 100 free. Another freshman,
Justin Ewers, who has been im
proving considerably over the last

month, swam a strong leg in the
400 free relay.
"It's encouraging to see them
swim so well," Carey said. "They
just figured out the last things
they needed to do to race well."
Several of the older swimmers
also turned in impressive perfor
mances. Sophomore Chris Olson
made an adjustment after swim
ming the 100 free and turned in
an incredible 44.0 split in the 400
relay.
"It was amazing to see [Olson]
make such a good adjustment in
just twenty minutes from one
race to the next," Carey said.
Sophomore Sabir Muhammad
had a strong meet with victories
in the 100 fly and the 50 free. Se
nior David Johns also had anoth
er impressive meet with a double
victory in the one-meter and
three-meter diving competition.
Perhaps the biggest showdown
of the meet was between Cal's
Ugur Taner, who has won the 200
fly at NCAAs the last two years,
and Carey, who was redshirted
with an injury last season. This
time, Carey, who has been swim
ming incredibly in the 200 fly over
the last month, emerged with a

victory over Taner by three hun
dredths of a second.
Other Stanford winners in
cluded sophomore Tom Wilkens
in the 400 individual medley, Rad
vany in the 1650 free, and junior
Matt Thomson in the 200 individ
ual medley.
After Saturday's performance
the Cardinal heads into March
with a renewed confidence.
"People don't usually think that
we would be in the position of the
underdog," Carey said. "It's hard to
picture Stanford in that situation,
but now we have the drive and the
force to prove that not only are we
not the underdogs, but we can win."
With the Cardinal's impressive
performances and the results that
are coming in from around coun
try from other teams, the Stan
ford swimmers have risen from a
team with an outside shot at the
NCAA championships to a team
that really believes it's a serious
contender.
"This is a team that before was
saying, 'Michigan looks pretty
good, but we think we can win,"'
Gagner said. "Now we're saying,
'It's our meet. We can win it if we
want it.'"

them building and building and
building and getting better and
better and better. But the best is
yet to come. They are going to
have a lot of confidence going into
the Pac-10 Invitational [March 1-
3). Blake [HoldenJ and Justin
[Ewers] still have to qualify for
NCAAs, and now they have the
confidence that they can and will
be part of the NCAA team."
Holden continued his strong
showings in the breaststroke with
a victory in the 200. Freshman
Matt O'Mara, who has fought ju
nior Kevin Radvany in the mile all
year, won the 500 free. O'Mara,
whose best event was probably
the mile, has adjusted to find an
event that he can score points in
at the dual meets, winning the
400 against USC and the 500 on
Saturday. Dod Wales, the final
freshman individual winner, tied
sophomore Chris Olson for first in
the 100 free. Another freshman,
Justin Ewers, who has been im
proving considerably over the last

month, swam a strong leg in the
400 free relay.
"It's encouraging to see them
swim so well," Carey said. "They
just figured out the last things
they needed to do to race well."
Several of the older swimmers
also turned in impressive perfor
mances. Sophomore Chris Olson
made an adjustment after swim
ming the 100 free and turned in
an incredible 44.0 split in the 400
relay.
"It was amazing to see [Olson]
make such a good adjustment in
just twenty minutes from one
race to the next," Carey said.
Sophomore Sabir Muhammad
had a strong meet with victories
in the 100 fly and the 50 free. Se
nior David Johns also had anoth
er impressive meet with a double
victory in the one-meter and
three-meter diving competition.
Perhaps the biggest showdown
of the meet was between Cal's
Ugur Taner, who has won the 200
fly at NCAAs the last two years,
and Carey, who was redshirted
with an injury last season. This
time, Carey, who has been swim
ming incredibly in the 200 fly over
the last month, emerged with a

victory over Taner by three hun
dredths of a second.
Other Stanford winners in
cluded sophomore Tom Wilkens
in the 400 individual medley, Rad
vany in the 1650 free, and junior
Matt Thomson in the 200 individ
ual medley.
After Saturday's performance
the Cardinal heads into March
with a renewed confidence.
"People don't usually think that
we would be in the position of the
underdog," Carey said. "It's hard to
picture Stanford in that situation,
but now we have the drive and the
force to prove that not only are we
not the underdogs, but we can win."
With the Cardinal's impressive
performances and the results that
are coming in from around coun
try from other teams, the Stan
ford swimmers have risen from a
team with an outside shot at the
NCAA championships to a team
that really believes it's a serious
contender.
"This is a team that before was
saying, 'Michigan looks pretty
good, but we think we can win,"'
Gagner said. "Now we're saying,
'It's our meet. We can win it if we
want it.'"
