## Women go 2-2 in season-opening tournament 
### Erin Bryla 
If the benefit of experience
could be measured in cash, the
women's water polo team would be
a very rich group of women after
its season-opening tournament in
San Diego this past weekend.
"We gained experience and im
proved with every game," said
head coach Ben Quittner.
The women won two of their
four games in the tournament,
which ran from Friday through
Sunday at UC-San Diego. The Car
dinal began the tournament by
falling to fourth-ranked California,
a game in which Stanford started
four freshmen. The team's inexpe
rience was apparent, as the Cardi
nal came out overexcited and some
what unfocused in the 7-5 loss.
After the Cal loss, the women
bounced back to take two of their
next three contests, showing
marked improvement in the
process. They began by defeating
UC-Santa Barbara, a game which
the Cardinal dominated, allowing

the Gauchos only four goals. Most
of the women got a piece of the net
as Stanford racked up seven goals.
The Cardinal maintained their
composure in the next game
against a much more physical
squad, second-ranked San Diego
State. Composure wasn't enough,
however, as the Cardinal suc
cumbed 6-3 in a game that was
much closer than the score might
indicate.
Stanford returned to its win
ning ways in a match versus host
UC-San Diego. This was the most
impressive win of the weekend, as
the Cardinal defeated the third
ranked Toreros 7-3. Here, the
young Cardinal .showed a glimpse
of what there is to look forward to
later in the season.
Despite winning two of four,
the women did not advance to the
semifinals of the tournament. In
stead, the team finished the week
end by playing an exhibition game
against a local club team, the Sun
set Juniors. They handily defeated
the Juniors 7-4, with freshman

sensation Lindsay Welshour rack
ing up four out of the team's seven
goals.
The weekend was also high
lighted by strong defensive play,
led by freshman goalkeeper
Heather Crary.
"Heather Crary was absolutely
outstanding. She was one of the
best goalkeepers in the tourna
ment, if not the best goalkeeper
there," Quittner said.
Olivia White, Lindsay Welsh,
and Lindsay Tarn paced the Cardi
nal offensively.
"So far we are really excited
about the rest of the season," said
junior captain Alice Cathcart. "We
have real potential to do well."
The weekend in San Diego also
showed the Cardinal exactly what
they need to work on in order to be
competitive with national power
houses like Cal and UCLA.
"The entire mentality of the
team has now changed. We now
know what to expect. We can han
dlejust about any team," Quittner
said.
