# Wrestlers stumble vs. OSU

### Karim Fahkry Contributing writer 
The Stanford wrestlers turned in a dismal per
formance against a stellar Oregon State team Sat
urday at Burnham Pavilion in their final dual
meet of the season. Squaring off against last year's
second-place NCAA finisher, the Cardinal
couldn't get things together and fell by a margin of
34-8.
"Oregon State is a tough team," said Stanford
head coach Chris Horpel, back from a two-week
hiatus during which he comforted the family of
slain Olympic champion and ex-Cardinal coach
Dave Schultz. "Unfortunately, they whipped us
pretty good."
Winning just two of ten matches, the starting
lineup was flat for the most part. Senior team
leader Tod Surmon captured his 18th straight vic
tory of the season, maintaining his perfect record
while taking care of his 142-pound opponent, Art
Peterson. Freshman Doug Bardsley also looked
strong in defeating Jim Kutz in the 150-pound
weight class.
Other than these two points of light, however,
the Cardinal's performance was gloomy. Seniors
Matt Cano (126 pounds), Jimmy Aguirre (134
pounds) and Saillan Martin (158 pounds) all had a
good shot at victory in Horpel's estimation, but
failed to make good.

"Cano got behind early and kept making mis
takes as he tried to catch up," Horpel said.
"Aguirre got caught in a tough front headlock and
hurt his neck — he was winning at the time and
ended up not being able to finish. Martin was
wrestling well most of his match, but [he] just
didn't get any of the close calls and got a little too
tired at the end."
Cano lost to Jake Whisenhunt; Aguirre lost by
injury default to Oscar Wood; and Martin fell to
Jason Gutches.
In other matches, sophomore Jeff Grant fell to
Chad Renner in the 167-pound weight class,
sophomore Matt Von der Abe succumbed to 177-
pound Sanders Freed, and junior Bryan Vaniman
(190-pound class) fell to OSU's Les Gutches, tout
ed as perhaps the top college wrestler in the na
tion. In the heavyweight division, sophomore
Mark Neglay lost to his Beaver counterpart, Mat
Orndorff.
Horpel insists he's not anxious despite the fact
that the all-important Pacific 10 Conference
Championships are only 11 days away.
"All these [problems] can be fixed by the time
we go to Pac-10's," he said. "We are on the home
stretch and we are going to sprint hard to the fin
ish line."
Horpel estimates that the team will qualify be
tween three and six wrestlers from the Pac- 10's for
the NCAA tournament, which runs March 21-23.
