# Reporter glad to be back on Stanford beat

He covered the Clarence
Thomas/Anita Hill hearings, wrote
about hot topics like Whitewater
and the health care proposals, and
traveled around the world with the
Clinton administration. But now
Bob Cohn's back where he started,
working on what seems to be his fa
vorite beat: Stanford.
A Daily staffer from September
of his freshman year to his gradua
tion in 1985, Cohn returned to
campus in December as editor of
the new Stanford magazine.
The independent alumni mag
azine of the same name recently
merged with the University's
alumni publication, the Stanford
Observer. The first issue of the
combined venture is due to be re
leased March 1.
From his balcony outside his
large, airy corner office in the Bow
man Alumni House, Cohn can see
the place where his journalism ca
reer began: the Daily office. After
serving as opinions editor and
managing editor early on in his
time at Stanford, Cohn decided to
dedicate his senior year to what he
had missed — writing.
"Most of my Stanford memories
are of working late nights at Stan
ford, going out at 3 a.m. to get
breakfast at Denny's and still try
ing to get to my nine o'clock class.
It was worth it, though," he said.
"I enjoyed The Daily. I really
learned a lot. It's amazing how
much student journalists can
teach each other," he said.
Cohn also gained experience

during his college years working as
a stringer for the Los Angeles
Times and the San Francisco Ex
aminer — the latter gave him one
of his first political assignments,
covering the 1984 Democratic
Convention.
Graduating a quarter early with
a double major in Communication
and American Studies, Cohn did
not get his anticipated few months
of rest and relaxation. Instead, he
received a six-month internship
that May, working at Newsweek.
He never did take that vacation he
was looking for, as he spent the
next 10 years working at the maga
zine.
For two years during his time at
Newsweek, Cohn went back to
school, attending the Kennedy
School of Government and the
Yale Law School program for jour
nalists. There, he took first-year
law classes and was granted a mas
ter's degree in law.
"I learned a lot about law so I
could come back and write about
legal affairs," Cohn said.
He did just that, returning to
Newsweek to cover the legal beat,
including the Justice Department,
the Supreme Court and the FBI.
"The most exciting story I cov
ered was the Clarence Thomas
nomination to the Supreme
Court," Cohn said, explaining that
he found Thomas particularly in
teresting because of his rise from
poverty.
"Then Anita Hill came out and
there was a whole new round. It
was a fascinating Columbus Day

provocative and sophisticated.
weekend of '91. That was a tremen
dously interesting story because it
had ail the dimensions of legal poli
tics and personalities and a racy un
dertone," he said.
In 1993, Cohn was promoted to
covering the Clinton administration
for Newsweek, during which time
he was "living and breathing the
White House for three years."
He traveled with Clinton both do
mestically and abroad, including
Russia, the Middle East, and the D-
Day sights in England and France for
the recent World War II celebrations.
From covering health care is
sues, Whitewater, and questions
about Clinton's style, character and
foreign policy, Cohn gained his own
insights and opinions about the

president and his administration.
"I think they are well-inten
tioned, and there are a lot of smart
people there, including President
Clinton," he said. He added, though,
that the administration has shown
itself at times to be inefficient and
undisciplined, which has hindered
its effectiveness.
Cohn heard about the position of
editor of Stanford magazine last
summer and decided to apply for
both personal and professional rea
sons. I lis wife had a baby in Septem
ber, and Cohn did not want to spend
too much time away from home,
which would be required if he stayed
at Newsweek and covered the cur
rent presidential campaign.
Cohn also said he was ready for
something new professionally.
"I didn't think the next five years
would be as exciting as the previous
five years because I'd already
learned so much," he said.

"What really clinched it was at
Newsweek, was that I was just doing
reporting and writing. It was a nar
row slice of journalism. Out here,
I'm in charge of the whole maga
zine. It's a much bigger sense of re
sponsibility."
Already familiar with Stanford
magazine because he has written
free-lance stories for it, Cohn said he
aims to "keep up the high quality of
it and usher the magazine through
the changes [with the merger] in the
smoothest possible way." Maintain
ing the magazine's independence
from the University is another top
priority for Cohn.
"The key concern I had about the
magazine was that the Alumni As
sociation magazine would maintain
its independence. I wouldn't have
taken my family and moved 3,000
miles if I wasn't convinced we'd re
tain the independence."
Cohn said he is not exactly sure

how this independence will be
reached. "It's problematic because
it's never been done before. We're
charting new territory."
University President Gerhard
Casper has expressed dissatisfaction
with past issues of the magazine,
which is one reason for the merger.
He formally complained about a
cover story in June 1993 which dis
cussed gays at Stanford. That year
— Casper's first year in office — he
extended benefits to gay and lesbian
domestic partners, and he felt the ar
ticle misrepresented his priorities.
In light of these past conflicts be
tween the University and the maga
zine and the subsequent merger,
Cohnsaid, "I'm late to this whole de
bate, I understand Casper's position
and I also understand the maga
zine's position.
"I'm really confident that we're
not going to have too many experi
ences that would make them or us

uncomfortable. No one's asking us
not to do certain stories. Building 10
will know what stories we're plan
ning. I don't feel any need to hide
that from them."
One thing is certain, though. The
magazine will still be written for the
alumni and not for the University,
Cohn said. "The goal is to put out
the best possible magazine. Our au
dience is the Stanford alumni. We
need to be provocative and sophisti
cated," he said.
Some small changes have been
made in the magazine. The Farm
Report — the University's news —
no longer exists, since the Universi
ty's news will now come in a subsec
tion of the magazine called Stanford
Today. Leland's Journal, another
new section which will appear at the
front of the magazine, will include a
series of shorter, lighter stories.
The first edition's cover story is
actually a series of three stories

about the philosophical and political
turmoil in Congress. "It is the colli
sion of ideologies and politics in Con
gress through the eyes of Stanford
alumni who are working on the
Hill," Cohn said.
One story will juxtapose Xavier
Bacerra, a liberal Latino Democrat
from Southern California with Jen
nifer Dunn, a conservative Republi
can from Washington state. Both
congressional leaders are Stanford
alumni and will be used "as a prism
to look at issues in Congress today,"
Cohn said.
Being a Stanford alumnus him
self will be an asset to his new role,
he said.
"It's a benefit for the editor to
have ties to the University. That
makes my job a lot easier because it
makes the orientation process a lot
shorter. It creates an affinity for
Stanford that the editor should
have," he said.
He covered the Clarence

about hot topics like Whitewater

One story will juxtapose Xavier
Bacerra, a liberal Latino Democrat
from Southern California with Jen

can from Washington state. Both
congressional leaders are Stanford
alumni and will be used "as a prism
to look at issues in Congress today,"
Cohn said.
Being a Stanford alumnus him
self will be an asset to his new role,
he said.
"It's a benefit for the editor to
have ties to the University. That
makes my job a lot easier because it
makes the orientation process a lot
shorter. It creates an affinity for
Stanford that the editor should
have," he said.
He covered the Clarence
Thomas/Anita Hill hearings, wrote
about hot topics like Whitewater
and the health care proposals, and
traveled around the world with the
Clinton administration. But now
Bob Cohn's back where he started,
working on what seems to be his fa
vorite beat: Stanford.
A Daily staffer from September
of his freshman year to his gradua
tion in 1985, Cohn returned to
campus in December as editor of
the new Stanford magazine.
The independent alumni mag
azine of the same name recently
merged with the University's
alumni publication, the Stanford
Observer. The first issue of the
combined venture is due to be re
leased March 1.
From his balcony outside his
large, airy corner office in the Bow
man Alumni House, Cohn can see
the place where his journalism ca
reer began: the Daily office. After
serving as opinions editor and
managing editor early on in his
time at Stanford, Cohn decided to
dedicate his senior year to what he
had missed — writing.
"Most of my Stanford memories
are of working late nights at Stan
ford, going out at 3 a.m. to get
breakfast at Denny's and still try
ing to get to my nine o'clock class.
It was worth it, though," he said.
"I enjoyed The Daily. I really
learned a lot. It's amazing how
much student journalists can
teach each other," he said.
Cohn also gained experience

during his college years working as
a stringer for the Los Angeles
Times and the San Francisco Ex
aminer — the latter gave him one
of his first political assignments,
covering the 1984 Democratic
Convention.
Graduating a quarter early with
a double major in Communication
and American Studies, Cohn did
not get his anticipated few months
of rest and relaxation. Instead, he
received a six-month internship
that May, working at Newsweek.
He never did take that vacation he
was looking for, as he spent the
next 10 years working at the maga
zine.
For two years during his time at
Newsweek, Cohn went back to
school, attending the Kennedy
School of Government and the
Yale Law School program for jour
nalists. There, he took first-year
law classes and was granted a mas
ter's degree in law.
"I learned a lot about law so I
could come back and write about
legal affairs," Cohn said.
He did just that, returning to
Newsweek to cover the legal beat,
including the Justice Department,
the Supreme Court and the FBI.
"The most exciting story I cov
ered was the Clarence Thomas
nomination to the Supreme
Court," Cohn said, explaining that
he found Thomas particularly in
teresting because of his rise from
poverty.
"Then Anita Hill came out and
there was a whole new round. It
was a fascinating Columbus Day

weekend of '91. That was a tremen
dously interesting story because it
had ail the dimensions of legal poli
tics and personalities and a racy un
dertone," he said.
In 1993, Cohn was promoted to
covering the Clinton administration
for Newsweek, during which time
he was "living and breathing the
White House for three years."
He traveled with Clinton both do
mestically and abroad, including
Russia, the Middle East, and the D-
Day sights in England and France for
the recent World War II celebrations.
From covering health care is
sues, Whitewater, and questions
about Clinton's style, character and
foreign policy, Cohn gained his own
insights and opinions about the

president and his administration.
"I think they are well-inten
tioned, and there are a lot of smart
people there, including President
Clinton," he said. He added, though,
that the administration has shown
itself at times to be inefficient and
undisciplined, which has hindered
its effectiveness.
Cohn heard about the position of
editor of Stanford magazine last
summer and decided to apply for
both personal and professional rea
sons. I lis wife had a baby in Septem
ber, and Cohn did not want to spend
too much time away from home,
which would be required if he stayed
at Newsweek and covered the cur
rent presidential campaign.
Cohn also said he was ready for
something new professionally.
"I didn't think the next five years
would be as exciting as the previous
five years because I'd already
learned so much," he said.

"What really clinched it was at
Newsweek, was that I was just doing
reporting and writing. It was a nar
row slice of journalism. Out here,
I'm in charge of the whole maga
zine. It's a much bigger sense of re
sponsibility."
Already familiar with Stanford
magazine because he has written
free-lance stories for it, Cohn said he
aims to "keep up the high quality of
it and usher the magazine through
the changes [with the merger] in the
smoothest possible way." Maintain
ing the magazine's independence
from the University is another top
priority for Cohn.
"The key concern I had about the
magazine was that the Alumni As
sociation magazine would maintain
its independence. I wouldn't have
taken my family and moved 3,000
miles if I wasn't convinced we'd re
tain the independence."
Cohn said he is not exactly sure

how this independence will be
reached. "It's problematic because
it's never been done before. We're
charting new territory."
University President Gerhard
Casper has expressed dissatisfaction
with past issues of the magazine,
which is one reason for the merger.
He formally complained about a
cover story in June 1993 which dis
cussed gays at Stanford. That year
— Casper's first year in office — he
extended benefits to gay and lesbian
domestic partners, and he felt the ar
ticle misrepresented his priorities.
In light of these past conflicts be
tween the University and the maga
zine and the subsequent merger,
Cohnsaid, "I'm late to this whole de
bate, I understand Casper's position
and I also understand the maga
zine's position.
"I'm really confident that we're
not going to have too many experi
ences that would make them or us

uncomfortable. No one's asking us
not to do certain stories. Building 10
will know what stories we're plan
ning. I don't feel any need to hide
that from them."
One thing is certain, though. The
magazine will still be written for the
alumni and not for the University,
Cohn said. "The goal is to put out
the best possible magazine. Our au
dience is the Stanford alumni. We
need to be provocative and sophisti
cated," he said.
Some small changes have been
made in the magazine. The Farm
Report — the University's news —
no longer exists, since the Universi
ty's news will now come in a subsec
tion of the magazine called Stanford
Today. Leland's Journal, another
new section which will appear at the
front of the magazine, will include a
series of shorter, lighter stories.
The first edition's cover story is
actually a series of three stories

about the philosophical and political
turmoil in Congress. "It is the colli
sion of ideologies and politics in Con
gress through the eyes of Stanford
alumni who are working on the
Hill," Cohn said.
One story will juxtapose Xavier
Bacerra, a liberal Latino Democrat
from Southern California with Jen
nifer Dunn, a conservative Republi
can from Washington state. Both
