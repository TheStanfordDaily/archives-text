# Reporter glad to be back on Stanford beat

### Heather Knight Staff writer 
He covered the Clarence
Thomas/Anita Hill hearings, wrote
about hot topics like Whitewater
and the health care proposals, and
traveled around the world with the
Clinton administration. But now
Bob Cohn's back where he started,
working on what seems to be his fa
vorite beat: Stanford.
A Daily staffer from September
of his freshman year to his gradua
tion in 1985, Cohn returned to
campus in December as editor of
the new Stanford magazine.
The independent alumni mag
azine of the same name recently
merged with the University's
alumni publication, the Stanford
Observer. The first issue of the
combined venture is due to be re
leased March 1.
From his balcony outside his
large, airy corner office in the Bow
man Alumni House, Cohn can see
the place where his journalism ca
reer began: the Daily office. After
serving as opinions editor and
managing editor early on in his
time at Stanford, Cohn decided to
dedicate his senior year to what he
had missed — writing.
"Most of my Stanford memories
are of working late nights at Stan
ford, going out at 3 a.m. to get
breakfast at Denny's and still try
ing to get to my nine o'clock class.
It was worth it, though," he said.
"I enjoyed The Daily. I really
learned a lot. It's amazing how
much student journalists can
teach each other," he said.
Cohn also gained experience

during his college years working as
a stringer for the Los Angeles
Times and the San Francisco Ex
aminer — the latter gave him one
of his first political assignments,
covering the 1984 Democratic
Convention.
Graduating a quarter early with
a double major in Communication
and American Studies, Cohn did
not get his anticipated few months
of rest and relaxation. Instead, he
received a six-month internship
that May, working at Newsweek.
He never did take that vacation he
was looking for, as he spent the
next 10 years working at the maga
zine.
For two years during his time at
Newsweek, Cohn went back to
school, attending the Kennedy
School of Government and the
Yale Law School program for jour
nalists. There, he took first-year
law classes and was granted a mas
ter's degree in law.
"I learned a lot about law so I
could come back and write about
legal affairs," Cohn said.
He did just that, returning to
Newsweek to cover the legal beat,
including the Justice Department,
the Supreme Court and the FBI.
"The most exciting story I cov
ered was the Clarence Thomas
nomination to the Supreme
Court," Cohn said, explaining that
he found Thomas particularly in
teresting because of his rise from
poverty.
"Then Anita Hill came out and
there was a whole new round. It
was a fascinating Columbus Day

Utilizing his experiences as a former Daily editor and Newsweek
reporter, Bob Cohn hopes to produce a magazine that will be both
provocative and sophisticated.
