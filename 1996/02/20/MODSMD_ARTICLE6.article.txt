# EAST Fest to explore Asian counterculture
## 
### Perry Chen 
The Stanford community will
have the chance to explore East
Asian culture and counterculture
with the kickoff of EAST Fest 1996
today.
Created and organized by EAST
House, EAST Fest is a two-week
celebration and sampling of East
Asian culture through a series of
speakers and live performances.
Ellen Neskar, EAST House's
resident fellow, said this year's
theme, "Culture and Countercul
ture in Asia," is intended to be "an
exploration of what dominant cul
ture is in East Asia and the way in
dividuals express it through emerg
ing countercultures."
Elisa Ong, a theme associate at
EAST House, said EAST Fest's

speaker series provides "something
you can't get in a classroom," name
ly the interactive blending of cul
ture and academics through "first
hand accounts of current East
Asian issues."
EAST House has scheduled nine
speeches over the next two weeks,
which will feature professors and
experts from both Stanford and
other universities.
The lectures will be conducted
weeknights at 7 p.m. in the EAST
House dining room and will include
topics such as "Culture and Tech
nology in India" and "U.S. Bases in
Asia."
Travis Conley, a theme associate
at EAST House, said many of the
lectures have an "apocalyptic twist
to them" due to EAST Fest's coun
terculture theme.
Neskar pointed out that this
year's celebration is devoted to deal
ing with relatively new aspects of
Asian culture, such as Japanese an
imation and contemporary reli
gious crises in Japan. Speeches and
discussions on subjects like these,
she said, will help to explain "how
subcultures grow up within estab
lished traditions."
EAST Fest 1996 will culminate
March 2 with Performance Night in
Cubberley Auditorium, featuring
samples of East Asian foods and live
performances of acrobatics and tra

ditional Japanese theater.
Ong said the free performances
usually draw a large crowd because
of the quality of the elaborate per
formances and different cuisines.
"Performance Night is a foot
stompin,' knee-slappin,' all 'round
hee haw good time," said Conley.
This year marks the 13th annu
al EAST Fest celebration. Ong said
the celebration originally began as a
dinner in EAST House between the
residents and faculty who discussed
East Asian issues.
Gradually, the program grew
into a two-week long series of dis
cussions and came to include live
performances. Each year, the resi
dents and staff of EAST House em
phasized a different theme for
EAST Fest, such as last year's focus
on Asian identities. Attendance be

came so large that two years ago
Performance Night had to be
moved from EAST House to Cub
berley Auditorium.
In addition to the work of EAST
House's residents and staff, the
contributions of other dormitories
toward the festivities help make
EAST Fest possible. Between 10
and 15 dorms have donated funds
for this year's EAST Fest, with the
average amount contributed run
ning at $30 per dorm, Conley said.
Preparation for this year's
EAST Fest began in the fall, even
before EAST House's residents ar
rived on campus, said Neskar. The
staff brainstormed ideas and then
used that as a rough outline which
the residents then filled out to cre
ate the schedule for EAST Fest
1996.
