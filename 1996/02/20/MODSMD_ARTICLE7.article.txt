# Planners trying to raise awareness about Quad
## 
### Jennifer Wang 
As the reconstruction of the
Quad continues, its managers are
making new efforts to increase
public awareness about the pro
ject.
Although construction in the
Quad was more extensive after the
Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989,
the renovations have been ongoing
since the 19705. Current plans
provide for completion by the year
2000.
Occupants will be temporarily

housed elsewhere, and a large ef
fort is underway to review class
schedules and avoid concentrating
projects in high-traffic areas.
"Our goal is to choreograph the
various projects into an overall
project rather than considering
them as individual projects," said
Greg Gill, a Facilities manager.
The Quad, which is old enough
to be designated as historic in the
Santa Clara County Heritage Re
source Inventory, must be
strengthened to meet strict seis
mic safety codes.
John Ciccarelli, bicycle pro
gram coordinator for Transporta
tion Programs, said "there is not a
whole lot we can do" about the in
convenience the construction
causes. However, he emphasized
the meticulous care being taken to
minimize negative effects.
A committee composed of repre

sentatives from the Planning Of
fice, Transportation Programs,
the Registrar's Office and the dis
abled community was recently es
tablished to consider ways to com
municate information about pro
ject details and potential negative
effects to the general public.
"We have worked very hard and
diligently to lesson the impact on
the community," said committee
member Paul Cohen, Facilities en
gineer.
Sound walls have been erected
to help control noise, and occu
pants of buildings surrounding the

construction sites are sent weekly
e-mail messages reporting project
ed noise and dust levels.
Another proposal is the instal
lation of a dozen 4-square-foot
"Quad Seismic Construction Up
date" signs to be placed on fencing
and other strategic locations.
One suggestion still being con
sidered is the distribution of fliers
or brochures detailing the con
struction development.
Construction in the Geology
Corner, in Buildings 30, 90, 100,
110 and 540 and the Language
Corner is projected to be complete

by August 1996.
Building 10, which houses the
Offices of the President and the
Provost, will be one of the next
sites to undergo renovation. Also
planned for the near future are
Buildings 40, 50 and 240. Con
struction on Buildings 160, 250
and 360 should begin further down
the line.
The construction is mainly
debt-funded through loans,
though the Federal Emergency
Management Agency has allocated
resources for earthquake repair.
Money will also come from Univer

sity and gift funds.
In addition to the numbered
buildings, work is continually
being done on the freestanding ar
cades to improve their earthquake
resistance.
Ciccarelli advised pedestrians
to walk on these arcades for safety
reasons and has advised cyclists to
proceed slowly when passing
through any construction area.
Although he is not aware of any
increase in bike accidents or com
plaints regarding construction, Ci
ccarelli does feel there are poten
tial dangers.

Specifically, the stone gate on
the east side of the Quad has been
narrowed down, and lines of sight
are cut off. Ciccarelli said that even
without the construction fence ob
stacle, many accidents occurred at
that spot in the past, which is all
the more reason for students and
faculty to be prudent.
As to the progress of the project
so far, Cohen said, "In the course
of renovation, there is always some
amount of unexpected or con
cealed conditions."
But he said that "nothing too
unique" has caused problems.
