## GOP rivals prepare for primary Dole leading in polls, followed by Buchanan and Alexander 
### 
MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -
Republican presidential combatants
argued taxes, trade and negative ads yes
terday in a final burst of contentious
campaigning before New Hampshire's
leadoff primary. A weakened Bob Dole
was the principal target.
On the eve of the voting, polls showed
Dole, the Senate majority leader, fight
ing commentator Pat Buchanan for
first, with former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander in close pursuit.
"The election in November is about
the future, the primary tomorrow is
about who can beat Bill Clinton,"
Alexander asserted, suggesting Dole was
not that man.
Buchanan was bidding to stay atop a
wave of support from social conserva
tives and blue-collar Republicans that he
rode to victory in Louisiana and a sur
prising second-place finish in lowa.
He predicted a strong New Hamp
shire finish "because we've got a mes
sage."
Still haunted by his crucial loss here
in 1988 to George Bush, Dole stopped
short of predicting a decisive victory. But
he said he expected "a very friendly ver
dict."
The Kansas senator picked up the
endorsement of a third GOP presidential
dropout, Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen
Specter. "If you take the totality of his
positions, I think he has the best pro
gram for America," Specter said in a
telephone interview with The Associated
Press.
Dole earlier won the backing of for
mer California Gov. Pete Wilson and
Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, both onetime
rivals for the GOP nomination.
In the final full day of campaigning,
the candidates darted back and forth
across the state and dominated the air
waves with live interviews and campaign

commercials.
All the major contenders but Dole
made the rounds of morning talk shows,
leading Alexander to accuse the Kansan
of "ducking interviews."
"There have been more sightings of
Elvis in New Hampshire than there have
been of Senator Dole," Alexander said at
Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter.
"'We've been out here every day,"
Dole responded. "I don't know what his
problem is. I hope he gets over it."
Dole traveled the state by bus, offer
ing himself as the "clear choice" for
Republicans.
At a high-tech computer company in
Rochester, he attacked Buchanan for
protectionist trade proposals he said
would put the export-reliant plant "out
of business."
Buchanan, for his part, opened the
day with a pep rally for workers at his
Manchester campaign headquarters and
professed himself "a little nervous."
When another supporter predicted a
big Buchanan victory, the candidate
said, "If we can get something like that
here, we will go all the way. They will not
stop us."
In a TV interview, Buchanan faced
more questions about his views on social
issues such as homosexuality.
He said he wouldn't allow openly gay
people to work in his administration if
elected. "I don't think their lifestyle
should . . . discredit the administration,"
Buchanan told CNN.
Publisher Steve Forbes joined throe
lesser-known GOP candidates — Cali
fornia Rep. Bob Dornan, Illinois manu
facturer Morry Taylor and conservative
talk show host Alan Keyes — at a pan
cake flipping contest and breakfast in
Manchester.
Forbes' pancake broke up in the air
and fell to the ground. "I'm not used to

doing it,"he explained.
The heir to the Forbes publishing for
tune had a more positive prediction for
his self-financed campaign, saying he
was ready to press on beyond New
Hampshire regardless of the vote.
"We're in for the duration," he said,
and predicted "a surprise" today.
At a campaign stop in Manchester,
Forbes also tossed out the names of two
well-known conservatives he'd consider
as potential running mates on a Forbes
ticket — former Education Secretary
Bill Bennett and former housing secre
tary Jack Kemp. Bennett is an Alexan
der supporter; Kemp has remained neu
tral.
A poll by the University of New
Hampshire Survey Center for the
Boston Herald and WCVB-TV, released
yesterday, showed Dole at 22 percent,
Buchanan at 19 percent, Alexander at 18
percent — a statistical tie within the
poll's 5 percentage point margin of error.
Forbes was at 10 percent.
"The most striking finding is the
underlying volatility which still charac
terizes the race," said pollster Kelly
Myers. "Even among 'most likely' vot
ers, 13 percent remain undecided."
Alexander, finishing his walk across
New Hampshire with a 1.5-mile stretch
from Portsmouth to an oceanside mall,
invited supporters to put on red and
black plaicl shirts — his trademark -
and join him.
Meanwhile, Sen. Dick Lugar of Indi
ana called the race "a demolition derby"
for all its negative charges and counter
chargers, and held out little prospect for
finishing in the top tier.
About all he would predict was, "I'm
going to do better in New Hampshire
than I did in lowa," where he finished
seventh out of nine in last week's GOP
caucuses.
