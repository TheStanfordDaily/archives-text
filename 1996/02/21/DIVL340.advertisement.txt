An Investment You
Can Feel Good About
ave the whales, No Nukes, and recycling
are all terrific causes, really. But how
about a little help for the dying humans?
If you strive to invest your money with a social
conscience, talk to us. For as little as $2,000 or
more you can make the most socially responsi
ble investment ever. It's called a VIATICAL
SETTLEMENT, and it offers all of the best
qualities you'd look for in a good investment:
safety, high yield, short maturity, and no fees
or commissions. Oh, one other
thing... You'll be helping a person
with a terminal illness live out their
remaining days free of financial
stress. It's truly an investment you
can feel good about making!
