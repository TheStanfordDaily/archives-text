## Making hospital stays a little kinder Packard Children's Hospital introduces Patient Relations Ambassadors 
### Adam Kemezis Contributing writer 
When parents bring a sick child to the
hospital, the distress they feel is often
made worse by the disorientation of being
in a strange place. They often need some
one to answer the simplest questions:
Where is the cafeteria? Is there anywhere
to sleep?
At Stanford's Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital, there are now people whose job it
is to answer these questions.
These volunteers are called Patient Re
lations Ambassadors. They are not trained
as physicians, nurses or counselors; they
are trained to make people feel at ease dur
ing their stay at the Children's Hospital.
When the Children's Hospital was
opened in 1991, it was designed to be as un
intimidating as possible. However, accord
ing to ambassador Sally Robinson, families
are still "overwhelmed" by the experience,
and they often feel uncomfortable asking
doctors and nurses questions.
To ease these feelings of discomfort, the
hospital began the ambassador program
this fall. The first training course for am
bassado.s was given in October, said Nan
nette McAllister, patient relations coordi
nator at the hospital.
The ambassador program is unique be
cause it marks the first time that hospital
volunteers receive extensive training to
deal with the variety of problems that
emerge, McAllister said.
Angela Lewis, the hospital's media coor

dinator, noted that a pediatric hospital
"has to treat the whole family."
For ambassadors, who are easily recog
nized by the teal vests they wear, this can
mean many things.
An ambassador begins the day by look
ing at a list of all the patients in the hospi
tal and visiting the families of children who
have been admitted that day.
Often, Robinson said, parents at this
stage are extremely disoriented and may
simply need to know things like where they
can have a meal or a shower. The ambas
sador also provides them with information
about motels and restaurants in the area.
Ambassadors are also on call all day,
wearing beepers which patients can call
from phones in their rooms. Another option
is the HUGS line; parents and children can
dial 8-HUGS from their phone if they just
feel like talking or have a simple question.
This is an important way to reassure
parents that help is available anytime, am
bassador Jolana Leinson said. "It's not al
ways an emergency, if they want a pizza or
dered to their room, we can arrange it for
them," Leinson said.
Ambassadors visit families again on
their third day in the hospital. By then,
Robinson said, questions are less basic:
parents often ask questions about their
child's condition and the treatment the
child is receiving.
Robinson said ambassadors are not
trained to answer these sometimes very dif
ficult and sensitive questions, so they have
doctors and nurses provide this informa

tion.
Ambassadors make themselves available
to all of the patients and families in the hos
pital. This often goes beyond dispensing in
formation. Robinson said many of the fam
ilies of children with cancer are just as fa
miliar with the hospital as she is, but still
have problems that can be helped by sup
portive listeners.
Because it is new, McAllister said the
program is constantly changing and ex
panding to meet the needs of families. "We
are going to start an exercise program as a
stress reducer for parents," she said. "It
was an idea suggested by a parent, and we
were lucky enough to have a volunteer who
was also an aerobics instructor."
McAllister said the ambassadors have
been "very welcome and useful" to patients
and have also helped doctors and nurses by
letting them focus on their jobs.
No experience is necessary to be an am
bassador, but there are many desired qual
ities. McAllister named being "a good lis
tener" and "non-judgmental." Also very
welcome are people with language skills,
since a substantial number of patients
speak Spanish or Asian languages.
"Really, a sense of humor and creativity
are the biggest requirements for the job,"
McAllister said, echoing the ambassadors'
sentiments.
A new training course for ambassadors
is scheduled for March 6 to 9, McAllister
added, and will hopefully net 15 to 20 new
ambassadors. Currently, there are about a
dozen ambassadors.
