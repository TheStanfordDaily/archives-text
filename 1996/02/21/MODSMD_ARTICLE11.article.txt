Fed to cut interest rates
WASHINGTON (AP) — While predict
ing the economy's sluggishness is only
temporary, Alan Greenspan indicated yes
terday that the Federal Reserve stood
ready to cut interest rates as an insurance
policy against recession.
The remarks by the Fed chairman
failed to cheer a grumpy W;ill Street. The
Dow Jones industrial average fell 44.79 to
close at 5,458.53, unsettled by a continued
plunge in the bond market. Demand for
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell,
pushing the yield up to 6.39 percent.
Delivering the Fed's twice-a-year status
report to Congress, Greenspan said central
bank policy-makers believe the overall
economy will grow at a moderate 2 percent
to 2.25 percent this year with inflation
remaining well-contained at around 2.75
percent to 3 percent. Both forecasts were
close to the administration's outlook.
Train speed restricted
WASHINGTON (AP) - Four days
after a fiery crash outside Washington
that killed 11 people, the government
issued emergency rules yesterday
requiring passenger trains to restrict
their speed after leaving stations.
Passenger trains must limit speed to
30 miles per hour leaving stations, engi
neers will have to call out red or vellow

signals to another crew member and
railroads must ensure emergency exits
are clearly marked and working.
"While the National Transportation
Safety Board has not reached a final con
clusion, enough questions have been
answered to take actions now," Trans
portation Secretary Federico Pena said
at a White House briefing.
Bombing trial moved
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - A federal
judge moved the Oklahoma City bomb
ing case to Denver yesterday, saying the
need to protect the defendants from a
vengeful public outweighs the desire of
the victims' families to attend the trial.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols
"have been demonized" in the news
media, U.S. District Judge Richard
Matsch wrote. "There is so great a prej
udice against these two defendants in
the state of Oklahoma that they cannot
obtain a fair and impartial trial at any
place fixed by law for holding court in
that state."
He did not set a trial date.
Prosecutors had urged Matsch to
move the trial to Tulsa, about 90 miles
from the bomb site, so that victims' fam
ilies could easily attend. But Matsch,
chief federal judge in Denver, sided with
the defense, which wanted the trial held
in Denver.
