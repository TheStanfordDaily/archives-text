# Buchanan wins GOP primary
## Commentator narrowly defeats Dole; Alexander finishes a close third 
### 
MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) - Con
servative rebel Pat Buchanan won a nar
row victory yesterday in New Hamp
shire's leadoff presidential primary,
nudging Bob Dole from his perch as
Republican front-runner and throwing
the GOP race into three-way turmoil.
Late-charging Lamar Alexander, the
former Tennessee governor, ran a close
third and suggested that proved him a
stronger mainstream alternative to
Buchanan than "a weakened Senator
Dole."
The candidates launch immediately
into a five-week, 30-state burst of prima
ry contests.
Dole was headed today to the Dako
tas; Alexander looked South, to Georgia
and South Carolina, hoping his Ten
nessee roots would translate into region
al strength.
For Buchanan, the commentator
turned-candidate, it was another dra
matic New Hampshire night. Four years
ago, he scored 37 percent against an
incumbent GOP president here, assert
ing himself — and his often unorthodox
views — in national Republican politics.
With 91 percent of precincts counted,
Buchanan had 51,469 votes, or 27 per
cent, to 49,648 or 26 percent for Dole.
Alexander had 43,600, 23 percent. Pub
lishing heir Steve Forbes was a distant
fourth at 12 percent, and said by associ

ates to be reassessing his campaign but
certain to press on for another week
because of his strength in Arizona and
Delaware.
In exit polls, voters cited pocketbook
issues — jobs, taxes and budget deficits
— as they judged the eight-man Repub
lican field.
Asked which issue mattered most in
deciding how they voted, one in four cited
the economy and jobs and one in five cited
taxes. Roughly 15 percent said the feder
al budget deficit. In clear reflection of the
race's volatility, 60 percent said they set
tled on their choice in the final week.
President Clinton swept to over
whelming victory in the Democratic pri
mary, logging more than 90 percent of
the vote against token opposition. The
fractures in the Republican field gave
Clinton and his party even more to cele
brate. "The answer is not to divide the
American people," Clinton said in a vic
tory statement that offered his view of
the Republican race.
New Hampshire's results were likely
to winnow the GOP field, though none of
the struggling candidates would immedi
ately admit as much. Forbes, particular
ly, had to be disappointed. He had been
tied for the New Hampshire lead a
month ago but his effort to promote a
flat income tax wilted as moderate voters
chose between Dole and Alexander.

Indiana Sen. Dick Lugar was fifth at 5
percent, Alan Keyes had 3 percent. Illi
nois businessmen Morry Taylor and Cal
ifornia Rep. Robert Dornan had even less
to show for their New Hampshire efforts.
"We have made history again
tonight," Buchanan said in celebration.
Buchanan delivered a scathing populist
critique of the GOP establishment and
big corporations and cast his showing as
"a victory for the good men and women
of Middle America."
Perhaps the biggest difference
between Buchanan and his two rivals is
trade policy. They supported the
NAFTA and GATT free-trade agree
ments as critical to boosting American
exports in a global economy; Buchanan
blames the deals for sending American
manufacturing jobs overseas, and stag
nating wages at home. Buchanan is also
far more outspoken than either Dole or
Alexander on social issues. He pledges to
be the "most pro-life president in histo
ry" and vows there will be no jobs for
avowed homosexuals in a Buchanan
administration.
Clinging to hopes for a late-night
comeback, Dole did not concede. But he
appeared resigned to placing second in
New Hampshire, again. "Now I know
why they call this the Granite State,"
said Dole. "Because it's so hard to
crack."
