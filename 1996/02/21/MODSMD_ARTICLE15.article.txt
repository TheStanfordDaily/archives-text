Trustees keep increases
low, but must give more
facts to prove argument

LAST WEEK, THE Universi
ty's Board of Trustees voted
to raise tuition to $20,940
for the 1996-1997 academic year
— an increase of 4 percent from
this year. Keeping a promise made
after the hefty tuition increases of
the early 19905, the board kept
the rise to less than 2 percent
above inflation.
A bit of praise is in order for
this move — the board could have
easily raised tuition as much as 5
percent and still kept its promise.
While any increase is unpleasant,
students could not have com
plained any more than the usual
grumbling.
Each year board members
remind students that tuition
doesn't cover the entire cost of a
Stanford education — in fact,
they say, it only covers about half
— but they do not provide any
kind of information to support
this claim. One of the many bene
fits of a Stanford education is
learning the ability to think criti
cally. Students have been taught
not to accept assertions of the
type handed down by the board
every year.
The increase for next year is
smaller than in previous years
due to administrative belt-tight
ening and efficiency improve
ments. But it is worth asking
whether the tuition increase
might have been held to less than
4 percent. Many colleges around
the country are actually reducing
their tuition — can Stanford's
economic strength support a
move of this kind?
The budget plan is available for
those who are interested in seeing
it. However, there is no real
breakdown of where tuition
money goes in the University.

Looking at the budget, it is appar
ent that tuition does make up
about half of total revenues. How
ever, students should be informed
as to how much of their tuition is
being put into academic salaries,
staff salaries, financial aid and
other assorted expenditures.
In the last six years, tuition has
gone up more than $6,000. Mean
while, the number of applications
to Stanford has soared and the
recently-created early admission
program has been a huge success
— testaments to the fact that peo
ple still value a Stanford educa
tion, no matter how fast the price
rises.
However, it is clear that these
cost increases must be controlled
in order to keep a Stanford educa
tion within reach. This is most
critical for middle-class families,
many of whom are unable to qual
ify for federally subsidized need
based financial aid but do not have
adequate resources to cover the
rising cost of a Stanford education.
The commitment to need-blind
admissions on the part of the Uni
versity is also admirable. While
many other prestigious institu
tions have abandoned this pur
suit, administrators have rein
forced their belief in admitting
the most-qualified applicants first
and determining where financial
need lies later on. However, rising
tuition may be a factor nonethe
less, as individuals may not apply
simply because they doubt the
University will be able to provide
the financial assistance necessary
to meet the high costs.
Students cannot be privy to all
of the inner workings of the Uni
versity's finances. However, they
do deserve to know exactly what
the costs of their education are,
and how their tuition money fac
tors into this cost. The board is to
be congratulated for the less
than-usual tuition increase; how
ever, this smaller increase should
not be viewed as a final destina
tion, but only as a stop-over point
on the journey towards a more
affordable Stanford education.
