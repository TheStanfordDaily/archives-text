## More to life than the ASSU 
### 
TWO WEEKENDS AGO, 10 Stanford
activists careened down to the Sono
ran desert to protest the construction
of the Columbus Telescope on top of Mount
Graham, an 11,000-foot mountain held
sacred by the San Carlos Apache and home
to multiple unique species. The students
had a confrontation with Congressman —
and Stanford alumnus — Jim Kolbe; one
student was deported by the police.
At the same time, other students were
organizing in East Palo Alto against the
owners of Romic, a hazardous waste facili
ty, who were following the all-too-familiar
pattern of opening a toxic plant in a com
munity of color, poisoning the hell out of it
and paying no penalties.
While both these stories are fascinat
ing and intricate; you have
learned a lick about them in last week's
Daily. You could, however, have learned
about a coffee kiosk between Meyer and
Green, a proposal to solicit input for the
Marguerite shuttle, the stale inner-work
ings of the ASSU Senate and scores of
articles about Stanford's unbeatable —
thus boring — tennis team.
In my mind, there are two ways to run
The Daily. The first is to examine Stanford
as a closed system and an end in itself. With
this approach, the matters of consequence
are internal: the student constitution,
admissions policies, dollies and ad-hoc com
mittees. The second is to look at Stanford as
a living entity of brilliant human beings con

nected through the University and interact
ing with their external surroundings. Here,
the matters of consequence are the strug
gles of individuals within the University
with the outside world.
Sadly, The Daily has tended much too
far toward the first route. To use a bla
tant example, there are three or four
pages of sports concentrating on exploits
against other universities. A Stanford
team won — smile. A Stanford team lost
— frown. It's a closed system of positives
and negatives. It doesn't matter if the
athletes — as one of Stanford's most lion
ized stars did — smashed a bench against
the Gay Liberation statue two years ago
and, in that instant, caused more real psy
chic pain than could be compensated with
a dozen Hose Bowl wins.
To be fair, The Daily is a symptom as
well as a cause. The Daily must please
some readers who desire only to look at
easily digestible headlines, stories and pic
tures. However, I refuse to believe that
more people want to read about coffee
kiosks than Mount Graham. Secondly, to
be fair to the current editors, this volume
has, so far, been the best in my two and a
half years on campus. However, no matter
how hard they work, there is an internal
inertia that will subvert all present gains
in the long run without a minor revolution
consisting of staff reorganization and pub
lic priority changes.
So what would my ideal Daily look like?

First of all, I'd continue and expand the
provocative "Tuesday Thoughts" of last
spring. I'd cut the total of athletic stories
regarding victories and losses down to half
a page. Features on athletes or teams that
get beyond the Bull Durham-like platitudes
of the current sports page could be longer.
I'd run multiple features a day on stu
dents, student groups, faculty members,
staff or facilities workers leading inter
esting lives and working toward impor
tant ends. I'd analyze local politics (how
many of you know about the March state
Senate elections and referendums?) and
state politics before they reach the crisis
point (like proposition 187 last year and
CCRI next year). I'd eliminate hackneyed
ASSU stories. I'd make OATQ larger and
on page one. I'd put all event advertise
ments on page two. I'd publish student
short stories and poetry.
The Daily isn't boring because it's bent
on being boring. Contrary to some popular
belief, it's not boring because Stanford is
boring. It is boring because that's all it
knows how to be and that's the only way we
know how to treat it. However, if I didn't
think there was hope, I wouldn't write this.
Let's see what we can change.
