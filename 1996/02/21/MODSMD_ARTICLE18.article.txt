Superfan should be welcome in Sixth Man section

TO MY FELLOW Stanford student
with the disparaging comments
about Superfan: waaaah!
It troubles me greatly to see such a
cynical and elitist attitude in a fan untest
ed by the lean years of Stanford basket
ball. In my time at Stanford, Superfan has
been the one thing you could count on at
men's basketball games. The team has
won, the team has lost, but Superfan has
been there. Even in less spectacular sea
sons, when students stayed away, Super
fan has been there stomping and cheering
for the Cardinal. It is not "meaningless"
that "this guy has been to a lot of Stan
ford games." His presence has made more
of an impact on Stanford basketball than
any one student I know of, the Tree and
the individual yell leaders included.

If the team is winning, he cheers. If the
team is behind, he is the first one to fire
up the crowd for a little home-court
momentum-builder. Yes, he is loud. Yes,
he is obnoxious. But that's why we call
him Superfan. Basketball is not tennis.
When you go to a tennis match, you're
supposed to sit politely in your seat and
enjoy the game. An occasional "ooh" or
"aah" from the crowd permeates the
muted atmosphere of a tennis lawn.
College hoops, on the other hand, is a
place to get rowdy and get loud. The pur
pose of the crowd — and especially of the
Sixth Man Club — is to use everything in
our arsenal short of napalm to get the
other team's mind out of the game. When
you have a weapon as powerful as Super
fan, would you want to dilute it by putting

it over in the sleepy sections of Maples? Of
course not, you'd want him right in the
middle of the student section where his
presence can make the biggest difference.
Well before the Sixth Man Club came
into existence, Superfan would camp out
hours before the games just so he could
get the best seat in the house. Since the
inception of the Sixth Man Club, Superfan
has been hounded by the Athletics
Department to leave the student section.
He has been told by Stanford administra
tors that they do not want him in the stu
dent section. Under this direction, Super
fan has sat over with Aunt Gertrude and
Uncle Milton, class of '45, and his boom
ing voice did little to crack the hearing
aids or hearts of the alum section.
The "know-it-all comments," while

sometimes crude and out of place, are the
qualities that make Superfan so endear
ing. He is brash, he is outspoken and he
will say exactly what most of the fans
want to say, even if we're too timid to say
it ourselves.
That is why we have repeatedly invited
Superfan to join us in the student section.
Given the rules of the Sixth Man Club,
which are themselves circumspect, Super
fan is our honored guest and, if it takes
that, he can have my shirt anytime he
wants it.
If you really want to enjoy the best
seats in the house, go sit next to Aunt
Gertrude and Uncle Milton; I'm sure
they'd love to have your company.
