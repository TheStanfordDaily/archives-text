# Attack on Hoover fellow was 'uninformed'
## 
### 
The shrill and uninformed attack on
Hoover Senior Fellow Thomas Moore in
Thursday's Daily would not merit a reply
but for these considerations:
Thomas Moore is a highly respected
economist and statistician who has exam
ined the historical record carefully and
made an important contribution to a sub
ject which is highly controversial subject,
as is evident from "1995 the Warmest
Year? Yes and No" (Science, Jan. 12). Sig
nificant studies are appearing, such as the
new book edited by David E. Cooper and
Joy A. Palmer, "Just Environments". I fol
low the argument dispassionately. The ad
hominem attack on Thomas Moore is sim
ply irritating, not enlightening.
I disagree with Hoover fellows on many
subjects, but the Hoover Institution is
viewed as the leading think tank of its kind
in the world. The fellows never engage in
mud-slinging, which befouls the intellectu
al atmosphere. I am politically indepen
dent, and I have spent more than 50 years

trying to promote rational debate on con
troversial subjects between Hoover and the
Quad. Mudslinging sets back this cause,
especially when it takes the form of demon
strations outside Hoover and at Glen
Campbell's home. Engage in enlightened
debate, not in yahoo behavior.
