# Fac Sen board may get students
## Planning and Policy Board membership awaits committee approval 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
In response to a student request, a Fac
ulty Senate committee has proposed
adding two student representatives to the
senate's Planning and Policy Board.
The board, which last month released a
document entitled "Planning in an Era of
Change," has met for more than three
years to gather recommendations for how
the University should adjust to tighter
budgets.
A charge for the board's second incvir
nation is expected to be presented at the
March 7 senate meeting.

One undergraduate and one graduate
student will be added to the board's cur
rent membership if the recommendation
from the senate's Committee on Commit
tees is approved by both the Steering Com
mittee and the senate.
Council of Presidents member Rich
Stolz — who, along with members of the
ASSU's Committee on Academics, Re
search and Evaluations and Executive
Committee, wrote a letter requesting the
change — said he is pleased that the Com
mittee on Committees recognized the im
portance of student representation.
"It demonstrates that the faculty is
committed to having students involved in

long-term policy issues that affect stu
dents," he said. "It's important in all rases
that students have a say in those policies."
The student representatives will bene
fit from the educational experience of
being part of the committee, as well as "im
prove the quality of life for other stu
dents," Stolz said.
Several issues the board covered in its
recent report had little to do with stu
dents directly, said committee member
Charlotte Jacobs, senior associate dean
for education and student affairs at the
School of Medicine. But almost everv-
thing will affect students some
how, she said, so representation is
worthwhile.
"Anything that's going to shape
our University in the future does
need the input of those people who
are directly affected," Jacobs said.
"In a sense, one could say that
everything we deal with affects at
least some of the student body."

The board's former chairman,
Materials Science and Applied
Physics Prof. Arthur Bienenstock,
who after the report was released
announced he would not continue
as chairman, said he didn't feel the
board was the proper place for stu
dent representation.
"I think that the Planning and Pol
icy Board deals with broad matters
that usually go beyond the experience
of students," Bienenstock said.
He emphasized that he was
speaking as a faculty member who
has been chair of many committees,

both with and without student
members.
"On some of those, students
have played crucial roles," Bienen
stock said. "On this particular one,
I don't see the benefit."
Students may be excluded from
the board's discussion on issues
that do not normally concern them,
Stolz added.
"We were willing to be sensitive
to faculty concerns in more sensi
tive areas that faculty traditionally
keep to themselves, such as tenure
and faculty recruitment," he said.
