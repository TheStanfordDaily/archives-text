# Authoritarian regime won't allow debate, professor emeritus says
## 
### 
In a fanatically authoritarian regime
such as the French Jacobin one, when rev
olutionary ideology conflicts with humble
facts of human nature, the obsessive ideas
aren't revised; rather "errant" individuals
and classes are scapegoated and heads roll.
The situation is somewhat different on
a modern campus like Stanford. The ideol
ogy is comparably obsessive, but, when
refractory reality arises, only talking heads
are lopped ofT. The administration abso-

lutely has to seize control of expression;
otherwise discord mounts and the shaky
program begins to fall apart. This always
happens eventually, but one can under
stand the impulse to stave it off.
Thus speech codes arise and access to
faculty papers and magazines is restricted
to "politically correct" attitudes. At Stan
ford, say, if you want to publish a review of
"The Diversity Myth" — a review by a
Stanford professor on a book about Stan
ford by two Stanford grads — you're told,
as I was, that "this kind of review is not
acceptable," with no further explanations
or encouragement to rewrite it in a more
"acceptable" fashion.
This sort of thing caused Bob Beyers,
news service director under Don Kennedy,
to resign in protest, though he personally
leaned to liberal views. A dozen eminent
professors I have contacted here have
expressed similar displeasure, sometimes
using the word "totalitarian." Arthur
Schlesinger Jr., in his recent lecture,
denounced this general development and
also told me after his talk that the situation
in the humanities has become "tragic."
Schlesinger, in his masterly speech, held
up the central American cultural tradition

of freedom and inclusiveness as a "sacred"
ideal and deplored the fragmentation or
"disuniting" of the country through multi
cultural Balkanization. As he agreed in
conversation, the "tragedy" on campuses is
analogous. The whole notion of an authen
tic university is rooted in common ground,
and since the very aim of higher learning in
truth and the free discussion which alone
can lead toward it, when discussion is
silenced in the name of consensus based on
a rigid theory of social engineering, what
right do we have to be called a university?
If the ideas of the "correct" turn out to
be dreadfully wrong, as has happened
often, how wall we know? Only through a
painfully dragged-out failure parallel to the
seventy-year nightmare of the Soviet
Union? Meanwhile, the intellectual pollu
tion and institutionalized mendacity thrive.
University President Gerhard Casper and
Provost Condoleezza Rice, writing in The
Wall Street Journal, made out that the
study of language and literature here is
flourishing. Ask anyone in the field of
French or German, our classic foreign liter
atures. They have practically collapsed!
