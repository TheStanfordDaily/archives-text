## Race, fairness and Thursday night television 
### 
THE ONLY IMAGE I can associate
with my first few weeks in the Stan
ford in Washington house is being
trapped on MTV's "The Real World," with
a cast of 25 instead of eight.
Triple the characters, triple the inter
personal conflicts, triple the fallout. You
get the idea.
But of all the troublesome issues (and
there were issues) which arose in trying to
piece together some workable community
from a group that was simultaneously too
large and too small to fit together natural
ly, television viewing rights emerged early
as by far the most contentious and the
ugliest. Having only one television in the
house pitted roommate against room
mate, baseball fan against soap watcher,
Jay Leno against David Letter man.
These struggles, however, paled in
comparison to Thursday night. Thursday
night was . .. difficult. Thursday night
was unsolvable. For, in the bold but
unnecessarily obvious words of one of four
black students there, Thursday night was
racial.
The rest of the week was taken up hy
shows chosen by non-black students, she
said, ticking them off easily: "You all"
watch "Melrose Place" on Monday night,

"you" watch "Beverly Hills 90210" and
"Party of Five" on Wednesday night, she
said. "You" watch "Friends," uncontest
ed, at 8 p.m. on Thursdays. (A viewing
schedule which, no doubt, mirrors most
Stanford dorm televisions.) But "we"
want Thursdays at 9 p.m., she said firmly.
For "New York Undercover." Not for
"Seinfeld."
Enter bickering. Lots of it, pitting
maybe three of the four black students
against at least 10 or 15 "Seinfeld"
watchers and lasting most of the night.
We never formally took a vote; there was
no point. It would have come out four or
five to one in favor of "Seinfeld," there
was no question. It would hardly have
been a close election. Years of indoctrina
tion in the democratic tradition — from
dorm government to Poli Sci 10 — dictat
ed majority rule. "Seinfeld" was nothing
less than the will of the people.
Nonetheless, I spent the quarter watch
ing Jerry and Elaine and The Soup Nazi
and Mr. Peterman on videotape. Calling
my mother in Seattle desperately at mid
night our time, many weeks, when I real
ized the house's video machine had failed.
Waiting 5 to 7 days for the tape to arrive,
all the while dodging co-workers and fel

low Metro riders eager to unravel the intri
cacies of last week's plot before my very eyes.
My friends and co-workers who didn't
live in the house — and, in fairness, a few
residents — dismissed the whole thing as
either extreme cowardice or "white guilt."
How else can you explain our decision to
let the preferences of 3 or 4 trump those of
10 or 15 others? The people had spoken,
and the people had .said "Seinfeld." It's
only fair.
The democratic process is — for many
of us raised in the United States — some
thing of a religion. Votes are sacred. They
replace schoolyard brawls as a far more
civilized solution to conflict; the bully gets
a vote, yes, but so does everyone else. We
vote for "Most Spirited Camper" at the
end of the summer and for class speaker at
the end of high school. We vote to decide
when the alternate final should be given in
classes and whether dorm funds will be
spent on alcohol. We are upset when our
side loses, but we respect the decision and
submit to the will of the majority. Votes
are fair, and fair is fair.
But, on that Thursday night in Wash
ington, "fair" didn't seem fair. Not entire
ly. The African-American woman in our
midst who was fighting so hard for one

block of coveted television airtime — how
ever trivial it may have been — was talk
ing about fair, too, and she had a point.
She wasn't disputing the numbers; she
was appealing to reason, and tapping into
a sense of justice that defied the ultimate
authority of the democratic vote. We could
have voted for the rest of the quarter, and
the distinct interests of black students at
Stanford in Washington would never have
constituted a majority; is that fair? Our
system is built on the premise that every
citizen has an equal vote and an equal
voice. But what is fair when an equal vote
does not, and can never mean an equal
voice, because the speakers are simply out
numbered?
On some level, our struggle over Thurs
day night television control uncovered
what James Madison called the"the great
desideratum of republican wisdom" — to
fight against the tyranny of the majority
while at the same time preserving the spir
it of popular government. It troubled him
that, "according to Republican Theory,
right and power being both vested in the
majority are held to be synonymous."
Madison worried that popular democracy
left open a door for the majority of citizen
voters to consistently sacrifice the inter

ests of a invariably outvoted minority; he
hypothesized that any such majority could
be as despotic as the most heartless
monarch. "It is ... to be dreaded that the
few will be unnecessarily sacrificed to the
many," he said.
Our situation in Washington threw a
wrench in the often undisputed link
between American democracy and abso
lute fairness. Some would gnash their
teeth at the miscarriage of justice that
took place every Thursday night at 9 p.m.,
when "white guilt" clouded all good rea
son and subverted the American way,
when the majority submitted to the will of
the minority.
But others, myself among them, find
something hopeful in our resolution —
made in the shadow of Washington's mon
ument and under Lincoln's gaze, not far
from Madison's Virginia home. Not a deci
sion to give up on democracy, but a deter
mination to challenge the parts that don't
work, that haven't been working on many
levels for many years in one very small
way. And to recognize that "fair" isn't
always fair.

against at least 10 or 15 "Seinfeld"
watchers and lasting most of the night.
We never formally took a vote; there was
no point. It would have come out four or
five to one in favor of "Seinfeld," there
was no question. It would hardly have
been a close election. Years of indoctrina
tion in the democratic tradition — from
dorm government to Poli Sci 10 — dictat
ed majority rule. "Seinfeld" was nothing
less than the will of the people.
Nonetheless, I spent the quarter watch
ing Jerry and Elaine and The Soup Nazi
and Mr. Peterman on videotape. Calling
my mother in Seattle desperately at mid
night our time, many weeks, when I real
ized the house's video machine had failed.
Waiting 5 to 7 days for the tape to arrive,
all the while dodging co-workers and fel

low Metro riders eager to unravel the intri
cacies of last week's plot before my very eyes.
My friends and co-workers who didn't
live in the house — and, in fairness, a few
residents — dismissed the whole thing as
either extreme cowardice or "white guilt."
How else can you explain our decision to
let the preferences of 3 or 4 trump those of
10 or 15 others? The people had spoken,
and the people had .said "Seinfeld." It's
only fair.
The democratic process is — for many
of us raised in the United States — some
thing of a religion. Votes are sacred. They
replace schoolyard brawls as a far more
civilized solution to conflict; the bully gets
a vote, yes, but so does everyone else. We
vote for "Most Spirited Camper" at the
end of the summer and for class speaker at
the end of high school. We vote to decide
when the alternate final should be given in
classes and whether dorm funds will be
spent on alcohol. We are upset when our
side loses, but we respect the decision and
submit to the will of the majority. Votes
are fair, and fair is fair.
But, on that Thursday night in Wash
ington, "fair" didn't seem fair. Not entire
ly. The African-American woman in our
midst who was fighting so hard for one

block of coveted television airtime — how
ever trivial it may have been — was talk
ing about fair, too, and she had a point.
She wasn't disputing the numbers; she
was appealing to reason, and tapping into
a sense of justice that defied the ultimate
authority of the democratic vote. We could
have voted for the rest of the quarter, and
the distinct interests of black students at
Stanford in Washington would never have
constituted a majority; is that fair? Our
system is built on the premise that every
citizen has an equal vote and an equal
voice. But what is fair when an equal vote
does not, and can never mean an equal
voice, because the speakers are simply out
numbered?
On some level, our struggle over Thurs
day night television control uncovered
what James Madison called the"the great
desideratum of republican wisdom" — to
fight against the tyranny of the majority
while at the same time preserving the spir
it of popular government. It troubled him
that, "according to Republican Theory,
right and power being both vested in the
majority are held to be synonymous."
Madison worried that popular democracy
left open a door for the majority of citizen
voters to consistently sacrifice the inter

ests of a invariably outvoted minority; he
hypothesized that any such majority could
be as despotic as the most heartless
monarch. "It is ... to be dreaded that the
few will be unnecessarily sacrificed to the
many," he said.
Our situation in Washington threw a
wrench in the often undisputed link
between American democracy and abso
lute fairness. Some would gnash their
teeth at the miscarriage of justice that
took place every Thursday night at 9 p.m.,
when "white guilt" clouded all good rea
son and subverted the American way,
when the majority submitted to the will of
the minority.
But others, myself among them, find
something hopeful in our resolution —
made in the shadow of Washington's mon
ument and under Lincoln's gaze, not far
from Madison's Virginia home. Not a deci
sion to give up on democracy, but a deter
mination to challenge the parts that don't
work, that haven't been working on many
levels for many years in one very small
way. And to recognize that "fair" isn't
always fair.
