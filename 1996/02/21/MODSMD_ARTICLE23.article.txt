## The 						road less traveled Folkl leaves Farm to train with Olympians 
### Jenn Huie Contributing writer 
The road of life is full of unexpected left
turns. Two-sport star Kristin Folkl could
have taken the straight path and remained
in her secure Farm life, where she is a leader
on the Cardinal's Pacific 10 Conference
champion volleyball and basketball teams.
Or she could have taken a left turn and fol
lowed her dream to the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta.
Folkl, a 6-foot-2 Ail-American in volley
ball and a Pacific-10 Conference All-Fresh
men team member in basketball last season,
decided last month to take the unmarked
path. Currently training in San Diego, the
20-year-old Folkl is the only collegian among
15 women competing for 12 spots on the
Olympic team.
"No one is officially signed on until June,
but 10 spots are pretty much filled," Folkl said.
"I truthfully don't know what my chances are
right now. But I feel really good about my ef
fort and I'm learning from the team. That's all
I'm concerned with at this point."
Last summer, Folkl played with the U.S.
National Team, a tour which culminated in
the victorious Grand Prix tournament in
Beijing, China. Instead of continuing with
the team through the fall, Folkl temporari
ly declined her invitation and returned to
Stanford. According to U.S. volleyball coach
Terry Liskevych, Folkl's absence may have
reduced her chances of making the team
from 75 to 50 percent.
"I know that breaking away for three
months hurt my chances of making the
team, but I didn't feel mentally prepared
then," Folkl said. "I needed a break to sepa
rate my summer experience from what I'm
focusingon now. I feel much more confident
in my ability."
A powerful outside hitter from St. Louis,
Folkl led her high school teams to eight
state tournaments in volleyball and basket
ball. That winning streak continued into
her Stanford career as she led the Cardinal
to three NCAA Final Fours — two in volley
ball and one in basketball. At the conclusion
of the 1994 volleyball season, she earned the
well-deserved title of "National Freshman
of the Year."

Two-sport star Kristin Foikl is currently in San Diego
vying for a spot on the U.S. Olympic volleyball team.
Those who have seen Folkl in
action can understand the inten
sity of her game. Her strong and
consistent performance mani
fests her unyielding determina
tion to be the best. However, she
remains oblivious to the many ad
mirers and fans who have labeled
her the "Future of National Vol
leyball."
"[Folkl] has been a talented
star all her life, yet she seems un
aware of her admirers," said Car
dinal teammate Lisa Sharpley.
Folkl casually dismisses any
compliments with modest laugh
ter. She is not concerned with oth
ers' opinions. It is her own assess
ment about her ability that guides

her in decisions to "do what's
right."
"[Folkl| is a perfectionist who
always wants things done right,"
Sharpley said. "She's very de
manding of herself on the court,
but she doesn't let her mistakes
bring her down. She's also fun to
play with, which is really impor
tant."
Leaving behind her Cardinal
teammates added to Folkl's ardu
ous two-way decision, and she is
thankful for their support. Folkl
retains two years of NCAA volley
ball eligibility and three years of
basketball eligibility upon her re
turn next fall.
Folkl now shares an apartment
with two of her National squad
teammates, including 1991 Stan
ford alumnus Kristen Klein. USA
Volleyball provides a monthly
stipend to cover living costs, but

she is otherwise financially inde
pendent. Her amateur status pro
hibits her from earning additional
income.
Living on her own has given
Folkl new perspective on life.
"I know that school knowledge

'It's an incredible feel
ing of pride to wear USA
on your back and rep
resent your country.'
— Kristin Folkl

is important, but right now I'm
learning about real life — savings
accounts, money markets and
even retirement plans," she said.
"I fully intend to get my degree,

but I've realized that the most im
portant thing to get out of school is
learning how to learn."
Though Folkl has adjusted well
to her new lifestyle, she struggles
as she attempts to put in words the
meaning of training with the
Olympic team. She admits that she
has not yet grasped the full capaci
ty of representing her country.
"It's an incredible feeling of
pride to wear USA on your back
and represent your country,"
Folkl said. "When I see those
proud Olympic sponsor commer
cials, like the one for McDonalds, I
think, 'Wow! I have the chance to
do something great.' It's empow
ering to think that I may help our
team win a gold medal for the
country."
Folkl looks forward with hope
ful eyes towards the promising
road ahead.
