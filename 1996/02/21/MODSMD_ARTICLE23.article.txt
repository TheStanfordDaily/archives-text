## The
						road less traveled Folkl leaves Farm to train with Olympians 
### Jenn Huie Contributing writer 
The road of life is full of unexpected left
turns. Two-sport star Kristin Folkl could
have taken the straight path and remained
in her secure Farm life, where she is a leader
on the Cardinal's Pacific 10 Conference
champion volleyball and basketball teams.
Or she could have taken a left turn and fol
lowed her dream to the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta.
Folkl, a 6-foot-2 Ail-American in volley
ball and a Pacific-10 Conference All-Fresh
men team member in basketball last season,
decided last month to take the unmarked
path. Currently training in San Diego, the
20-year-old Folkl is the only collegian among
15 women competing for 12 spots on the
Olympic team.
"No one is officially signed on until June,
but 10 spots are pretty much filled," Folkl said.
"I truthfully don't know what my chances are
right now. But I feel really good about my ef
fort and I'm learning from the team. That's all
I'm concerned with at this point."
Last summer, Folkl played with the U.S.
National Team, a tour which culminated in
the victorious Grand Prix tournament in
Beijing, China. Instead of continuing with
the team through the fall, Folkl temporari
ly declined her invitation and returned to
Stanford. According to U.S. volleyball coach
Terry Liskevych, Folkl's absence may have
reduced her chances of making the team
from 75 to 50 percent.
"I know that breaking away for three
months hurt my chances of making the
team, but I didn't feel mentally prepared
then," Folkl said. "I needed a break to sepa
rate my summer experience from what I'm
focusingon now. I feel much more confident
in my ability."
A powerful outside hitter from St. Louis,
Folkl led her high school teams to eight
state tournaments in volleyball and basket
ball. That winning streak continued into
her Stanford career as she led the Cardinal
to three NCAA Final Fours — two in volley
ball and one in basketball. At the conclusion
of the 1994 volleyball season, she earned the
well-deserved title of "National Freshman
of the Year."
