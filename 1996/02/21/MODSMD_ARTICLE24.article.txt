# Men's golf heads to Hawaii
## Cardinal looks to earn respect at Invite 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
On the brink of the most crucial
stretch of its season, the Stanford
men's golf team travels to Oahu this
week to compete in the John F.
Burns Invitational.
Out of its accustomed top-five
spot with a little over two months
left in the regular season, the 20th
ranked Cardinal suddenly finds it
self staring at a very uphill struggle
to match the high expectations that
have become an inherent part of the
powerhouse program.
"I think we've definitely been
written off bv other programs," said

head coach Wally Goodwin. "Look
at our ranking. Clearly, people have
a diminished opinion of us."
The team will have ample oppor
tunity to silence such critics over the
next month. While the most diffi
cult test will come in early March,
when the team travels to Houston
for the Golf Digest Collegiate, this
week's event will serve as a key indi
cator of Stanford's potential.
Among the highly-competitive
field assembled in Hawaii are tal
ented squads from Arizona, Fresno
State, UNLV, and Houston. Adding
to the fun on an already challenging
6,739 yard, par-72 monster will be
the factor of gale-force winds, reach

ingup to 40 miles per hour.
"The weather's great as far as
precipitation goes," said a course of
ficial at the Kanehoe Klipper Golf
Course. "There's no rain and the
sun is out. It's just that the players
are having difficulty standing up
straight."
While the wind will be burden
some for the entire field, the Cardi
nal has had an especially difficult
time dealing with it in the past. Poor
play towards the end of last season
was caused largely by the team's in
ability to deal with windy weather.
"It's just not a facet of the game
we are able to simulate here," Good
win said. "We just usually don't
have a chance to play in those types
of conditions."
Everything aside, however, the
Cardinal's success will almost cer
tainly be determined by the play at
the No. 4 and 5 spots on the team.
Sophomore All-American Tiger
Woods, freshman Joel Kribel, and
senior team captain Jerry Chang
have performed admirably all sea
son as perhaps the most potent top
three of any team in the nation.
Such consistency however, is con
trasted by disappointing play at the
remaining two spots, where the
marked inconsistency has resulted
in a dizzying game of musical
chairs.
"We really need someone to step
up in the final two slots," Goodwin
said. "The guys have shown a lot of
talent and potential, but no one has
really taken charge.
"I really can't stress enough how
important this particular facet of
the team game really is. We can be
really tough come fNCAA) tourna
ment time, but we'll only go as far as
the No. 4 and 5 guys take us."
