# Call off the Dawgs!
## Women gymnasts fall to Georgia 
### Keith Rabkin Contributing writer 
Despite turning in one of its best
performances of the year, the
women's gymnastics team suffered
its second straight loss in Athens,
Ga., this past weekend. After losing
to Arizona and UCLA three weeks
ago, 13th-ranked Stanford fell to
second- ranked Georgia, bringing its
record to 1-3-0.
The Cardinal did show improve
ment, setting team highs in all
events and the all-around competi
tion. Additionally, each Cardinal
gymnast that competed in the un
even bars set her personal season
high in that event. But their spectac
ular performance wasn't enough to
even capture one event from Geor
gia.
The Bulldogs dominated the
meet, easily capturing all four events
and the top three places in the all
around. The Dawgs put up incredi
ble numbers, with a 49.525 on the
vault and a 49.725 on the bars. Their
unbeatable team score of 297.800
pleased Bulldog head coach,
Suzanne Yoculan, who saw her team
remain perfect for the season.
