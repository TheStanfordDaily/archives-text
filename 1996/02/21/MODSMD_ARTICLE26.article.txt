# Call off the Dawgs!
## Women gymnasts fall to Georgia 
### Keith Rabkin Contributing writer 
Despite turning in one of its best
performances of the year, the
women's gymnastics team suffered
its second straight loss in Athens,
Ga., this past weekend. After losing
to Arizona and UCLA three weeks
ago, 13th-ranked Stanford fell to
second- ranked Georgia, bringing its
record to 1-3-0.
The Cardinal did show improve
ment, setting team highs in all
events and the all-around competi
tion. Additionally, each Cardinal
gymnast that competed in the un
even bars set her personal season
high in that event. But their spectac
ular performance wasn't enough to
even capture one event from Geor
gia.
The Bulldogs dominated the
meet, easily capturing all four events
and the top three places in the all
around. The Dawgs put up incredi
ble numbers, with a 49.525 on the
vault and a 49.725 on the bars. Their
unbeatable team score of 297.800
pleased Bulldog head coach,
Suzanne Yoculan, who saw her team
remain perfect for the season.

The women's gymnastics team suffered a tough loss this past week
end, despite one of its best performances of the season.
Despite the loss, Stanford put up
its best numbers this season with a
192.900 team score and a 49.100 on
the uneven bars. The score on the
uneven bars was good enough to set
a new Stanford record, passing the
score 0f48.475 set in 1984.
In addition to the overall team
performance, the Cardinal gym
nasts excelled individually as well.
Freshman Amy Murakami, compet
ing in the all-around for the first
time, set a team-high in the all
around with a 38.850. Her outstand
ing performance continued when
she tied Hillary Anderson's and Jene
Elzie's team record on the bars with
a 9.9. She also scored 9.825 on the
balance beam.

Sophomore Misty Moore also
came close to breaking an estab
lished record, with her score of 9.85
on the floor exercise. That was good
enough to tie for second in the Stan
ford record books. Sophomore Keri
Monahan broke her own Stanford
record for the vault when she scored
a 9.925, and tied Murakami and the
school record with a 9.9 on the un
even bars. Monahan finished second
all-around on the Cardinal with a
38.125. Freshman Tracey Kohl also
contributed, finishing third on Stan
ford with a 38.025.
The Cardinal will keep its strong
performance in mind when they
meet in Seattle next week to compete
against Pacific-10 Conference rival
University of Washington. They will
have to be at their best since two
days later they fly home to battle
UC-Santa Barbara in Burnham
Pavilion.
