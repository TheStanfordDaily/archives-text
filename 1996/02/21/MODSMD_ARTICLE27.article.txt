# Men's hoops needs to toughen up; Immature Agassi needs to grow up
## 
### 
Crunch Time: The Associated Press was kind to
drop the 24th-ranked Cardinal just four spots this
week after its disappointing loss at Oregon on Satur
day. Stanford, which dropped three slots to No. 23 in
the CNN / USA Today poll, needs to start performing
away from home or it could be in for an early exit from
the NCAA Tournament this year. Of course, the Car
dinal must win at least three of its remaining five
games if it hopes to earn an at-large invitation to the
NCAA's in the first place.
Tough Stretch: Arizona is ranked 13th and
UCLA 16th by AP. The Cardinal will travel to Tuscon
to face the Wildcats on March 7.
Bears Fading: Cal, possibly one of the two most
talented teams in the conference, didn't receive a sin
gle vote in this week's AP poll and might not even
make it to the tournament.
Women Rolling: Like candy from a "baby, the
fourth-ranked Stanford women took two more games
from their undermanned Pac-10 opponents this
weekend and appear poised for a strong run at the
NCAA championship. The women clinched a ninth
consecutive 20-win season with their 74-65 win over
Oregon on Saturday at Maples.
Sophomore Slump?: Sophomore ace Kyle Peter
son has already lost twice as many games this season
(2) as he did all of last year. Nonetheless, Peterson and
his Cardinal teammates have played solid baseball in
getting off to a 9-5 start heading into conference play
this weekend.
Untied: The NCAA football rules committee's de
cision to institute a tie-breaker next season will take a
lot of late-game decision-making away from college
coaches. Nonetheless, the tie-breaker is probably a
good idea, and the procedure — giving each team a
chance to score from the 25-yard line — is more excit
ing than the NFL's standard sudden death overtime.
Collision Course: Michigan basketball coach
Steve Fisher has expressed concern that Saturday's
auto accident involving five Wolverines and star re
cruit Mateen Cleaves — on their way home to Ann
Arbor from a party in Detroit — might involve NCAA
violations. How did I just know that was coming?

Andre the Giant Baby: Andre Agassi's total lack
of maturity was painfully obvious at last week's
Sybase Open in San Jose. In his straight-set win over
Stanford's Ryan Wolters last Monday, Agassi com
plained to the chair umpire that Wolters was stalling
and later quick-served the freshman. When Wolters
made the same complaint after Agassi began playing
games with the ballboys by rolling balls across the
court, Agassi only got more peeved. Agassi also swore
loudly throughout his loss to Pete Sampras in Sun
day's final and repeatedly harassed lineswoman
Marie Smith after she expressed concern with his lan
guage.

No More Moonlighting: Deion Sanders' deci
sion to stick with football next season isn't a bad idea
considering the way Sanders hit the ball last season
for the San Francisco Giants. Of course, the Giants
made the decision a lot easier for Sanders when they
released him.
Big Bucks for Brown: Free agent cornerback
Larry Brown signed yesterday with the Oakland
Raiders. For those of you who don't remember,
Brown earned Super Bowl MVP honors as the recipi
ent of two gift-wrapped Neil O'Donnell passes.
A Game of Inches: Major League Baseball is
planning to drop the strike zone from above the
kneecap to below it in an attempt to speed up games
next season. If you ask me, they should have consid
ered raising it. The top of the zone is supposed to be
the spot between a batter's waist and his armpit, but
pitches above the waist are rarely called for strikes.
