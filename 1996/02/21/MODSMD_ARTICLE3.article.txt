# University to focus more on work, family balance
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Hoping to help University employees bal
ance their work and home lives, Stanford's
Child and Family Services program is reor
ganizing, exploring such changes as on-site
child care and increased employee training.
The program, which will be named the
Work Family Center, will shift to focus more
on four areas: families and child care, care for
the elderly, personal services and flexible work
options.
Vice President for Faculty and Staff Ser
vices Barbara Butterfield said the new center
will help clarify benefit options for employees.
"People's work and personal life are not
separable," Butterfield said. "We are tiying to
recognize what happens when employees have
problems with life events and to see what flex

ibility we can provide."
Kathleen Sullivan, director of the new cen
ter, said the transition is outlined in a new
brochure, "Balancing Work and Personal
Life."
"With the changes and downsizing that
have come to the University, the reason for re
designing is the need to reassure employees
and students that the University is still a good
place to study and work," said Sullivan. "That
is a definite priority."
In the '90s, center administrators have
found they face new concerns and challenges.
"We are no longer a support system for only
employees with children," Sullivan said. "We
are realizing that even a person who lives alone
is a family and is part of a community.
"What we have foimd is that we have had a
greater demand for resources and re
ferrals; that is creating a greater
work demand," Sullivan said. "The
University has provided a lot of sup
port — we can really feel its commit
ment."
In looking at the first area, family
and child care, the new center will ex
amine on-site child care, family home
aire, counseling and information on
parenting and prenatal care classes.
Sullivan said that to help the
process, the center has joined a new
group allied the College mid Univer
sity Work Family Association. The
center is able to work closely with
other universities to "understand
trends and unique work and family
issues," she said.
Second, the center is expanding
in the area of "healthy aging"
helping people care for elderly rela
tives and for themselvesas they age.

Sullivan said she is working with a
coordinating council to help stu
dents and employees who have the
responsibility to care for an aging
parent or relative.
"We are giving people informa
tion, giving them community re
sources, letting them know what
they are eligible for," said Sullivan.
In the third area, personal ser
vices, the center will provide a notary
public, a large lending library, mater
ial to renew passports by mail, and
voter registration, said Lisa Young, a
resource specialist in the center.
The fourth area of expansion,
flexible work options for employees,
will develop areas of training for em
ployees and help employees look at
their choices for balancing work and
family.
"For example," Sullivan said,
"there may be someone who would
like to move to temporary pail-time
while their child is young. We might
work out a job share option, or one
that would give them some time to
work from home."
