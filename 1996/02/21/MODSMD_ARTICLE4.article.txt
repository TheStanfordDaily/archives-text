# Student beaten after party
## Police arrest four San Jose State Sigma Chis 
### Prithika Balakrishnan Contributing writer 
Stanford Police arrested four San Jose
State University students early Saturday
morning for allegedly beating a Stanford
undergraduate following a fraternity
party. The alleged assault was the second
incident in as many weeks to involve a
crime committed by non-Stanford individ
uals who attended campus parties.
The four suspects were booked into
Santa Clara County Jail on charges of
felony assault.
The victim of the assault, whose name
was not released, was walking home after
a Sigma Chi party around 1:30 a.m. when
he encountered Justin Kinser, Jason Hag
berg, Kristopher Carley and Christopher
Steeb, Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said in a statement. The four
men, ranging in ages from 19 to 24, identi
fied themselves as members of the Sigma
Chi chapter at San Jose State.

"Three brothers behaved in a manner
that grossly misrepresented the charac
teristics of Sigma Chi," leaders of the San
Jose chapter wrote in a letter to the Stan
ford chapter, admitting that San Jose
members had crashed the party.
The Stanford student allegedly made
derogatory comments about the fraterni
ty, at which point the four suspects began
attacking him in the Tresidder Union
parking lot, said Niemeyer. The men al
legedly punched the victim in the head,
neck and shoulders before knocking him
to the ground and kicking him repeatedly.
When a Stanford Police officer in the
area stopped the assault, the suspects fled
in a car. The officer reported the vehicle
description and license plate to Stanford
Police, and the suspects were apprehend
ed a short time later.
The paramedics treated the victim on
the scene, but he refused further assis
tance.
Stanford Police Officer Harris
Kuhn came to the Stanford
SigmaChi house at 3 a.m. looking
for additional information con
cerning the incident, according to
Christian Nicks, Stanford's
Sigma Chi president. It was only
then that members of the house
were told of the incident, accord
ing to Nicks.
"The incident concerns Stan
ford Sigma Chi in the most mini
malist sense," said Nicks. "The
[alleged assault] was not on our
property, occurred after the party

closed, and the fraternity was un
aware of the incident until hours
after it occurred." The party
ended before 1:30 a.m., at which
point the disc jockey had stopped
the music and the house was rela
tively empty.
Nicks emphasized that there
had been no problems during the
party on Friday, and that he had
not noticed "any belligerent or
excessively intoxicated behav
ior." Additionally, the large num
ber of San Jose Sigma Chis at the
party were not formally invited to
the event.
The issue of outsiders attend
ing student functions is currently
under review by Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary

Edmonds, who today will likely re
lease an interim policy on student
sponsored events. The review was
prompted by a Feb. 10 shooting at
Tresidder during a sorority fund
raiser attended by hundreds of
non-Stanford students.
Nicks notified the president
and vice-president of the San
Jose Sigma Chis later Saturday,
at which point they were still un
aware of the incident, he said.
According to Nicks, the Office
of Student Activities told Sigma
Chi members upon notification of
the incident that it will not hold
the Stanford chapter accountable
for the incident, and the chapter
is not a candidate for disciplinary
action.
