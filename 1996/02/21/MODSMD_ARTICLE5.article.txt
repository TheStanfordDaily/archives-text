# Endowment returns climb by 12 percent
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Due to recent growth in its investments,
the University's endowment returns soared
List year, increasing in overall value from
$2.75 million to $3.08 million.
The upswing is consistent with university
endowments nationwide, according to an an
nual survey conducted by the National Asso
ciation of College and University Business
Officers and published in the Chronicle of
I ligher Education last week. The survey says
college endowments increased on average
15.5 percent in 1995.
Stanford's return — income generated by
the fund through dividends plus or minus
any gains or losses in University finances —
has grown by 12 percent.
Stanford had the fifth highest growth
value in the country, behind Harvard Uni
versity, the University of Texas system, Yale
University and Princeton University, re
spectively. This marked the second year that

Stanford ranked fifth.
The current market value of the total en
dowed equity of Stanford is $3.4 billion.
Laurance Hoagland, chief executive offi
cer of Stanford Management Company, said
most institutional investors maintain an ac
tive position in stocks to generate a high level
of investment funding, rather than leaving
money in cash investments. Recent growth
in the stock market has benefited the Uni
versity's position.
"The most important thing is that uni
versities have had the wind at their backs,"
Hoagland said. "There were largely positive
investments last year."
Like most universities, Stanford's endow
ment lies mostly in domestic and foreign
stocks, real estate and a few alternative in
vestments.
"We have invested heavily in the ven
ture-capital area," Hoagland said. "Silicon
Valley is on a roll, and there have been a lot
of IPOs — initial public offerings
— and the returns have been ex
ceptional."
The report showed that institu
tions which used to fear market
fluctuations are investing more
oflen in domestic stocks.
Stanford has a target range for
the amount of money that should
be placed in each of these areas, said
Hoagland.
"Thirty percent goes to U.S.

stocks, 23 percent in international
stocks, 17 percent in venture-capi
talist investments and the rest in
real estate," Hoagland said.
Stanford's endowment in
creases through gifts and higher
returns to investments. Hoagland
said Stanford has not made any
major changes to its policy on how
to invest endowment money.
"We have had a policy of being
fairly diverse in our endowment in
vestments," said Hoagland. "That
has been our general thrust for a
while — other than that though,
Stanford has made no significant
changes."
