# Calls home cost less dough
## Calling rates decrease 
### Adam Kemezis Contributing writer 
Hold the phone: Students will see a 17
percent reduction in the rates they pay for
long-distance calls in their next bills, Com
munication Services administrators said
yesterday.
The charge for each call made in the
most recent billing period, Jan. 20 to yester
day, will be reduced as a result of increased
revenues for Communication Services, said
Maureen Trimm, the department's assis
tant director.
A flier will be sent out with student bills,
explaining the reduction.
The average student makes about $36
worth of billable calls a month, so the re
duction will amount to $6 on average,
Trimm said. The $11 service charge that
students pay to cover service and campus

and local calls will be unaffected.
"We are looking forward to a similar rate
adjustment for the rest of the spring,"
Trimm said.
Rates are going down because the vol
ume of calls has been unexpectedly high,
meaning more revenue for Communication
Services, she said. Since Communication
Services is a University department, all of
which cannot make a profit, it has to pass on
the surplus to its users.
For each of the past three years, Trimm
said, the volume of student calls has been
greater than expected, resulting in a rate
cut each spring.
"People are just making more calls," said
Trimm, adding that no one is sure why.
She said Communication Services is try
ing to find some way to anticipate increases
in volume so that reductions can
be spread over the whole year in
stead of just the second half. But
the department always estimates
"conservatively" to avoid having
to increase rates due to an unex
pectedly low amount of calls, she
added.
"I think it's great that for once
the University is giving back to the
students," said Franie Estrada,
resident assistant in Otero.

Since it started in 1990, Com
munication Services has been able
to offer students discounted rates
for long-distance calls — mainly
because the department buys long
distance time from several compa
nies and is able to use the lowest
rates at a given time to a given
place regardless of the phone com
pany, Trimm said.
Stanford is able to switch be
tween companies because of the
extremely large amount of phone
traffic it generates. Trimm said the
University — including the Med
ical Center— accounts for 25 mil
lion minutes of domestic long-dis

tance calls and 3 million minutes of
international calls a year.
Current conditions are also
leading to "rate instability that is
driving down prices," she added.
In addition, Trimm noted that
long-distance companies are in
creasingly charging flat rates for
domestic out-of-state calls.
Communication Services is also
considering moving to a unified
day rate and a unified night rate
for all calls in the United States
outside of California. Trimm said
having such a rate would make it
easier to adjust for continued in
creases in volume.
