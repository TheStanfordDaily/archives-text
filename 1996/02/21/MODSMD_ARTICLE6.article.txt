# Calls home cost less dough
## Calling rates decrease

Hold the phone: Students will see a 17
percent reduction in the rates they pay for
long-distance calls in their next bills, Com
munication Services administrators said
yesterday.
The charge for each call made in the
most recent billing period, Jan. 20 to yester
day, will be reduced as a result of increased
revenues for Communication Services, said
Maureen Trimm, the department's assis
tant director.
A flier will be sent out with student bills,
explaining the reduction.
The average student makes about $36
worth of billable calls a month, so the re
duction will amount to $6 on average,
Trimm said. The $11 service charge that
students pay to cover service and campus

and local calls will be unaffected.
"We are looking forward to a similar rate
adjustment for the rest of the spring,"
Trimm said.
Rates are going down because the vol
ume of calls has been unexpectedly high,
meaning more revenue for Communication
Services, she said. Since Communication
Services is a University department, all of
which cannot make a profit, it has to pass on
the surplus to its users.
For each of the past three years, Trimm
said, the volume of student calls has been
greater than expected, resulting in a rate
cut each spring.
"People are just making more calls," said
Trimm, adding that no one is sure why.
She said Communication Services is try
ing to find some way to anticipate increases
