# Poet turned professor
## Ireland shapes Boland's work 
### Dee-Ann Durbin Contributing Writer 
According to Stanford's newest poet-in-residence
Eavan Boland, "A poet is who you are, it isn't what you
do."
Boland, who has been widely published in both the
United States and her native Ireland and who has re
ceived many prizes, arrived at Stanford in January.
Born in Dublin in 1944 and educated at Trinity College,
Boland has lived in Dublin all her life and said she con
siders Ireland to be connected to nearly everything she
writes.
She is the latest in a distinguished line of poets to be
come the English Department's poet-in-residence.
Poets chosen for the position are awarded a full profes
sorship and teach for one quarter each year. Boland suc
ceeds Denise Ix'vertov and Adrienne Rich, both poets
she greatly admires.
"I was really honored to come," said Boland. "Stan
ford has a fine tradition of poetry and of teaching poet
ry."
Currently, Boland is teaching two classes, one for un
dergraduates and one for Stegner Fellows, young poets
who are supported for two years by the University while
they attend classes and develop their craft.
"That's the incredible romance of this job," Boland
said. "It's touching how many people want to be Stegn
er Fellows, how many young writers are out there."
Boland has also been pleased to find budding poets
among her undergraduates. So far, her students are
sh;iring her enthusiasm.
"Her class is fantastic," said Katy Gordon, a 1995
Stanford graduate who is taking "The Voice in Contem
porary Poetry" with Boland. "As a working poet, she
combines her knowledge and expertise of the craft with
the approach of a critic."
While poetry is rarely emphasized in the American
system of education, Ireland's system makes the study
of poetry compulsory, said Boland. According to Boland,
both systems have their drawbacks. While American
students are underexposed to poetry, Irish students re
ject poetry because they associate it with exams.
"I just wish poetry writing was encouraged on both
sides of the Atlantic," Boland said. "Poetry is about the
creative present, and young people have to have a hand
in milking that present."
The hardest thing for most young poets to learn, said

Stanford's new poet-in-residence, Eavan Boland, aims to make
the study of poetry a memorable experience for students.
Boland, is to liave confidence in their
own experiences. Although she has
been writing poetry since her child
hood, Boland was in her 20s before
she could fully accept her own experi
ences as legitimate material for poet
ry-
Now, Boland regularly writes
about her experiences, especially
about her family. She is married
and has two daughters, ages 20 and
17. In one of her poems that she
likes best, "The Pomegranate," she
combines the Persephone myth
with images of one of her daughters,
surrounded by teen magazines and
a Coca Cola can.

Though her daughters will re
main in Ireland during her tenure at
Stanford, Boland said they frequent
ly ask if their mother is working near
a Banana Republic.
Beyond her family, the subject
Boland speaks of with the most affec
tion is Ireland.
"Stanford allows me to talk about
poetry and think about poetry," she
said. "But I am all the time in Ire
land."
Boland said her writing has been
strongly affected by the Irish vio
lence that has occurred during her
lifetime.
"This has been a very tragic gen
eration for Ireland," Boland said.
"When people are trying to make
sense of such abstract horrors, you
begin to see the limits of words to de
scribe violence. In that society, you

need poems to be as refreshing and
accurate as possible."
Boland is also a strong advocate of
experimenting with technology as a
means of advancing poetry.
"My students e-mail me their
poems, and I love it," she said. "We're
even discussing how to put the Steg
ner Fellowship on a Web site."
Bo Land insists that the old arts
must not be at odds with new tech
nology, especially as the numbers of
those reading and writing poetry de
clines.
"We're facing a historic challenge
with poetry," she said. "I'm a great
lover of technology, and I feel that po
etry has nothing to lose from
change."

Doland will read from her poetry
tonight ai 7p.m. in the Bookstore.
