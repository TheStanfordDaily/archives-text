# Poet turned professor
## Ireland shapes Boland's work

According to Stanford's newest poet-in-residence
Eavan Boland, "A poet is who you are, it isn't what you
do."
Boland, who has been widely published in both the
United States and her native Ireland and who has re
ceived many prizes, arrived at Stanford in January.
Born in Dublin in 1944 and educated at Trinity College,
Boland has lived in Dublin all her life and said she con
siders Ireland to be connected to nearly everything she
writes.
She is the latest in a distinguished line of poets to be
come the English Department's poet-in-residence.
Poets chosen for the position are awarded a full profes
sorship and teach for one quarter each year. Boland suc
ceeds Denise Ix'vertov and Adrienne Rich, both poets
she greatly admires.
"I was really honored to come," said Boland. "Stan
ford has a fine tradition of poetry and of teaching poet
ry."
Currently, Boland is teaching two classes, one for un
dergraduates and one for Stegner Fellows, young poets
who are supported for two years by the University while
they attend classes and develop their craft.
"That's the incredible romance of this job," Boland
said. "It's touching how many people want to be Stegn
er Fellows, how many young writers are out there."
Boland has also been pleased to find budding poets
among her undergraduates. So far, her students are
sh;iring her enthusiasm.
"Her class is fantastic," said Katy Gordon, a 1995
Stanford graduate who is taking "The Voice in Contem
porary Poetry" with Boland. "As a working poet, she
combines her knowledge and expertise of the craft with
the approach of a critic."
While poetry is rarely emphasized in the American
system of education, Ireland's system makes the study
of poetry compulsory, said Boland. According to Boland,
both systems have their drawbacks. While American
students are underexposed to poetry, Irish students re
ject poetry because they associate it with exams.
"I just wish poetry writing was encouraged on both
sides of the Atlantic," Boland said. "Poetry is about the
creative present, and young people have to have a hand
in milking that present."
The hardest thing for most young poets to learn, said
