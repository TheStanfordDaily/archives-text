Why the Hell
Should IJoin
a Credit Union?
As hank mergers continue to create large, faceless financial institutions, it's
becoming increasingly difficult for people to find hanks that can provide them
with the personal service and full range of products they need. That trend,
coming on the heels of the S&L crisis of the 1980s, has contributed to the
increasing popularity of credit unions.
Unlike a bank or savings and loan, a credit union is run by the people who
use its serv ices every day. At a credit union, membership is ownership. Customers
are not viewed as account numbers or transactions, but as member-owners
with voices to be heard. Members have direct involvement in credit union
operations, serving on the Board of Directors, establishing and reviewing
policies, and providing input on new services and products. They also receive
dividends.
At the Stanford Federal Credit Union, because our mission is to serve members,
rather than to generate corporate profits, we can pay high interest on savings
and charge low interest on loans and credit cards. Unlike other local banks,
we won't nickel and dime you with charges for phone calls, teller visits and
ATM use. If you'd like to find out more about us, phone (415) 725-1000.
