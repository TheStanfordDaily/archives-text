# Probe of tech deal launched
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The federal government is in
vestigating a technology transfer
to China that involves two Stan
ford professors, including De-

fense Secretary
William Perry.
In response to
allegations made
in the Far East
ern Economic
Review in Janu
ary, Pentagon
officials said
they are examin
ing the transfer
of telecommuni-

cations technology to a Chinese
company run by a former commu
nications director for the Chinese
military.
The 1993 deal involved two
American companies, Brooks
Telecommunications Internation
al Inc. and SCM which was at the
time run by Stanford Political Sci
ence Prof. John Lewis.


Lewis
The Review charged that Lewis
used changes in the government's
approval process for certain tech
nology deals as well as his friend
ship with Perry to slip the transfer
past government regulators.
The Pentagon has now request
ed an assessment of whether the
technology transfer could make a
significant difference in the Chi
nese People's Liberation Army's
attempts to modernize, spokesman
Brian Whitman said yesterday.
"We were asked to look at export
licenses," Whitman said. He said
such licenses are examined in re
sponse to requests by either the
Commerce Department or the
State Department, although he de
clined to comment on the specific
case.
SCM and Brooks entered into a
joint venture with Galaxy New
Technology — run by a member of
the People's Liberation Army — in
1993 to form Guangzhou Hua Mei
Communications Company, ac
cording to the Jim. 11 issue of the
Review.
"An American-backed joint ven
ture founded by a close friend and
official adviser to Defense Secre
tary William Perry has transferred
sensitive communications technol

ogy to Galaxy," the article charged.
"To do so, the company circum
vented roadblocks thrown up by
Pentagon and National Security
Agency officials."
Lewis was out of town and un
available for comment on the issue.
In letters to the editor of the maga
zine, however, he claimed the arti
cle by Bruce Gilley was "riddled
with factual errors."
"Neither I nor any entity with
which I was associated in 1993 or
1994 did anything improper with
respect to the Hua Mei project," a
letter printed Jan. 25 said.
Although Gilley noted in his ar
ticle that "There is no evidence
that Perry or his friend, John
Lewis.. . violated any law," he still
accused the two of improprieties
concerning the project.
The broad-band integrated ser
vices digital network and high
speed or asynchronous transfer
mode switches employed by Hua
Mei as it builds an advanced
telecommunications network on
Guangzhou, in southern China,
had not been "available to China
previously," the article said.
Because of Hua Mei's alleged
connections with the Chinese mili
tary and the advanced nature of the
technology, the article charged, the
technology transfer would not nor
mally have been approved by the
federal government.
Over the past few years, respon

sibility for screening deals passed
from a Defense Department com-;
mittee to the Commerce Depart
ment. Despite the change, howev-!
er, the article said, a deal that could
aid the Chinese military would nor
mally be passed on to the Pentagon,
for a consultation.
How unique the technology is —
and how easily China could have
found it elsewhere — is a matter of:
contention. "What you call 'sensi
tive communications technology' is
widely available.. . and is being in
stalled in major cities throughout
Asia and around the world, includ
ing Moscow," Department of De
fense spokesman Kenneth Bacon
said in a letter printed Feb. 1.
Lewis may also face an investi
gation from the University admin
istration.
Because he has used University
stationery for his outside business,
he may have violated Stanford's
Faculty Policy on Conflict of Com
mitment and Interest.
In investigating, "we'll follow
what is a normal process under
these circumstances," Provost
Condoleezza Rice said. Vice
Provost and Dean of Research
Charles Kruger will "explore the
situation" with Lewis, she said.
Similar issues arise quite fre
quently, Rice added. "It's not all
that unusual that issues arise con
cerning conflict of interest," she
said.
