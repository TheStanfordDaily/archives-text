# Ombudsperson's job expands
##

The University plans to expand the ombudsper
son's duties, making the position full-time rather
t;han half-time beginning next year.
• The office's personnel will change along with the
position's requirements, as current Ombudsperson
Leah Kaplan steps down.
■ The ombudsperson's task is to help students, fac
ulty and staff resolve problems that arise from their
dealings with the University.
Jean Fetter, assistant to University President
Gerhard Casper, said the position is being made full
time because of added responsibilities, including reg
ularly scheduled time at the Stanford Linear Acceler
ator Center and work as coordinator of mediation ef
forts.
Kaplan has held the position of ombudsperson for
more than 11 years and said she declined to continue
on a full-time basis because of her age and health.
Ombudspersons were originally intended to serve
only one- or two-year terms, she said.

Kaplan's replacement should be chosen soon as
the result of a search limited to current University
staff members, Fetter said. "President Casper is in
the process of appointing a search committee that
will consist of two faculty members, two staff
members and two students and will nominate Ka
plan's successor by the end of spring quarter," Fet
ter said.
This year, the Ombudsperson's Office saw 291
people and conducted 134 phone consultations. All
services the office provides are confidential.
"Some students come in when they encounter
residential problems or would like to contest their
grades," said Kaplan. Kaplan added that some of
the other issues the office deals with include di
recting the efforts of faculty who try to resolve
tenure and salary issues, as well as anyone who en
counters discrimination and sexual harassment.
Although most universities now have a similar
position, Stanford was one of the first to establish an
ombudsperson's office, Kaplan said. When the office
opened in 1974, Stanford was "way ahead of other
universities," she said.
