### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
A San Jose woman was ar
rested yesterday for allegedly
stealing thousands of dollars
from an elderly Stanford cou
ple by adding digits to her pay
checks, police said, adding that
the incident may not be isolat
ed.
Stanford Police arrested
Susan Bangoy, 45, after the cou
ple's son, a Stanford researcher,
discovered a tax discrepancy
while preparing the couple's tax
forms. The son then located the
original checks and subsequent
ly discovered the alleged
forgery, said Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.

"If the victim wrote down 40
she would add a 1 and make it
140," Niemeyer said. "They'd
write a check for 40 or 50 bucks
and Susan would alter the
check."
Bangoy was booked at the
Elmwood Women's Correction
al Facility in Milpitas and re
leased on her own recognizance.
She was charged with single
counts of forgery, and
grand theft, Niemeyer said.
Bangoy admitted to the forg
eries, "but [the confession]
wasn't 100 percent forthcom
ing," he said.
For six months this year,
Bangoy spent two or three days
a week doing chores and driving
for the couple, an emeritus pro-

fessor and his wife, said
Niemeyer.
By the time the alleged forgeiy
was discovered between $5,000
and $7,000 had been stolen, he
said.
"The numbers weren't
adding up so [the son] looked at
some statements and checks
from the bank and was able to
ascertain what happened,"
Niemeyer added.
Bangoy may have forged ad
ditional documents from un
knowing victims throughout
the Peninsula area, he said.
Anyone with more information
or anyone who has formerly em
ployed Bangoy is asked to con
tact Detective Mark Swineford
at 723-9633.
