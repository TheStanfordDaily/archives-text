# GOP rivals continue campaign
## Five states scheduled to hold primaries in next 10 days 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fresh from
the tumult of New Hampshire, the GOP
presidential race yesterday entered a 10-
day stretch in which voters in five states
will test Pat Buchanan's momentum and
Bob Dole's ability to rebound.
For former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander, who placed a solid third in New
Hampshire, this next phase of the cam
paign could prove frustrating. He is not
well organized in any of the next five states
to vote, and some Republicans wondered if
he could raise sorely needed funds.
As the campaigns made quick tactical
adjustments, Buchanan's victory sent
shivers through a GOP establishment that
views him as a threat not only to retaking
the White House but to maintaining
Republican congressional majorities.
The consensus view in Washington and
among most Republican elected officials
remained that Buchanan would not — and
some argued fiercely could not — capture
the GOP nomination and that either Dole
would recover or Alexander would emerge
as the nominee.

"In a fragmented field, 25 or 26 percent
of the vote appears to be a victory," said
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who is neu
tral in the presidential race. "But pretty
soon, when it gets down to maybe two can
didates, 26 percent of the vote doesn't do
very well."
But these establishment voices were
chastised by others in the party who said
the time for underestimating Buchanan
was over.
"Yes he can be the nominee," said
Christian Coalition executive director
Ralph Reed. "He has put together a string
of impressive victories and shown himself
to be a viable candidate."
Gcv. Fife Symington of Arizona said
Buchanan could "absolutely" win his
state's primary next Tuesday and capture
the 39 delegates at stake.
"His support is very broad and he may
very well be the nominee of our party,"
Symington said. "Anarchy is the best term
to describe what is going in on the politics
of this country today. There is a very fun
damental anti-Washington ferment across

the land and Pat Buchanan is tapping into
it." Arizona polling shows the race wide
open.
Looking at the next five contests, GOP
observers said it was critical for Dole to
win North and South Dakota next Tues
day. These states have only 18 delegates
each, but Kansan Dole carried them in his
1988 campaign and has a farm-state affin
ity.
Delaware, which votes Saturday, is a
wild card. Publishing heir Steve Forbes is
the only active candidate who has cam
paigned there and was scheduled there
today and tomorrow. After his fourth
place showings in lowa and New Hamp
shire, however, his standing has plummet
ed everywhere.
Delaware GOP Sen. William Roth
endorsed Dole yesterday, and the Dole
campaign rushed a poll into the field to
determine whether it should air TV ads
there. But senior campaign aides said it
was likely Dole would not make a major
effort there. Neither will Buchanan or
Alexander.
