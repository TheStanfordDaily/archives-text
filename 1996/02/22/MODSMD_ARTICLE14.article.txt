# Train derails in Colorado, two dead

RED CLIFF, Colo. (AP) — A freijht train derailed near a
snowy pass high in the Rockies yesterday, killing two crew
members and spilling thousands of gallons of sulfuric acid
down a mountainside and across a highway.
Rescuers trudged through waist-deep snow to reach the
wreckage of the Southern Pacific Railroad train near 10,400-
foot Tennessee Pass, south of this village and 10 miles north
of the historic mining town of Leadville.
"At this time we do not know what caused the derailment,"
said sheriffs spokeswoman Kim Andre, "but we are surmis
ing snow may have played a major part in it."
Nearly 2 1/2 feet of snow had fallen Tuesday night and
more snow fell yesterday, Andre said.
The National Weather Service said several avalanches were
reported in the area. But sheriffs spokesman Jeff Beavers
said there was no obvious sign of an avalanche near the
tracks.
It was the fifth major train accident in the United States
this month. Authorities have found no common link.
The 82-car train was bound from East St. Louis, 111., to
Roseville, Calif., when it jumped the tracks before dawn. Both
engines and 25 freight cars derailed, said Mike Furtney, a
Southern Pacific Railroad spokesman.
The engineer and a student engineer were killed. Their

names were not immediately released.
Authorities were notified after the conductor, Steven Hud
son, walked out to the road shortly before 6 a.m. Hudson, 45,
of Pueblo, was hospitalized in fair condition with a broken col
larbone. Twenty others who were not on the train but affect
ed by the fumes were treated at a hospital and released.
Two of six tank cars containing sulfuric acid broke open,
spilling some of the 27,000 gallons they contained, Furtney
said.
It wasn't immediately known how much acid had spilled
over U.S. Highway 24, a main route between Leadville and
Vail. Authorities at first feared the acid would flow into the
Eagle River and its tributaries but discovered the liquid had
pooled in low spots and was contained.
The acid is highly corrosive if it comes in contact with the
skin or clothing, and its fumes can be harmful to breathe.
Hazardous-materials teams were sent to dump an alkaline
material to neutralize the acid.
About 40 cars drove through the acid before the highway
was closed, Eagle County administrator Jack Ingstad said.
Car owners were warned that the acid could cause dangerous
fumes in a closed garage and could corrode brakes.
A ski area two miles from the spill also was closed as a pre
caution.
