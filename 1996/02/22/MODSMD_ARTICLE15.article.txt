Tanker spews oil
ST. ANN'S HEAD, Wales (AP) - A
dozen straining tugs pulled a tanker off a
cluster of rocks yesterday after it spewed an
estimated 19 million gallons of oil, far
exceeding the Exxon Valdez's spillage in
1989.
British conservationists said they feared
it may be too late to avert an environmen
tal catastrophe in the Milford Haven estu
ary, near one of Britain's most important
wildlife conservation areas.
"We have moved from a very serious
incident to very close to disaster. We believe
the management of the whole process
appears to have been inadequate," said
Tony Prater, deputy officer in Wales for the
Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
Salvage workers were attempting to dis
perse a 12-mile-long oil slick, as well as
smaller slicks and other oil patches along a

25-mile to 30-mile front off Milford Haven
and eastward across Carmarthen Bay in
southwestern Wales.
Mistrial for rapper
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Jurors who
acquitted rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg and
his former bodyguard of murder dead
locked yesterday on a lesser charge of
voluntary manslaughter.
The jurors said they deadlocked 9-3 in
favor of acquittal in the shooting death
of a gang member.
"It now appears to the court that the
jury is hopelessly deadlocked and I have
declared a mistrial," said Superior Court
Judge Paul G. Flynn.
The jurors also acquitted the rapper of
a separate charge of accessory after the
fact in the Aug. 25, 1993, killing death of
20-year-old Philip Woldemariam.
