The ASSU Senate should
ensure 'Constitution '96'
is considered by students

THE ASSU NEEDS to be
fixed. Whatever the cause of
its problems, it is now gen
erally acknowledged that Stan
ford's student government merits
little respect from either the stu
dents — its constituents — or the
administration.
Change is certainly needed. But
it is difficult to determine what
change will be most helpful. In
recent weeks, however, valid sug
gestions have been made. Jon
Oram's bill — now withdrawn —
to restructure the COP was an
idea worthy of discussion. A bill to
replace the COP with a single
president and no vice presidents,
authored by a group of graduate
senators, also merits debate. But it
seems these piecemeal approaches
to repairing the ASSU amount to
nothing more than a Band-Aid on
a gaping wound.
The most radical — and proba
bly most viable — proposal for an
ASSU overhaul comes in the form
of a new constitution, authored by
senior Mike Slemmer.
Slemmer's "Constitution '96"
— like the other recent proposals
for reform — calls for an executive
system with one president. How
ever, unlike the others, it calls for
only one vice president — a plan
which has been endorsed by this
page. The other major changes
contained in his proposal also
seem to be significant, positive
steps toward creating a more effec
tive and respected ASSU: the cre
ation of a "Constitutional Coun
cil," a Supreme Court-like body
with the power to declare senate
acts unconstitutional; a decrease
in the senate's size and the elimi
nation of non-voting senators; and
strict freedom-of-information reg
ulations.

Regardless, however, of the
merits of the individual changes
contained in Slemmer's constitu
tion, together they form a cohesive
and comprehensive whole and a
valid suggestion for ASSU reform.
It is a proposal worthy of debate
and deliberation — not just by the
senate, but by the student body as
a whole.
But there are potential procedu
ral potholes in the way. Slemmer
has proposed his new constitution
as an amendment to the existing
constitution. In other words,
should his ballot measure pass, the
existing constitution would be
amended so as to replace it in its
entirety. Thus, the guidelines gov
erning how "Constitution '96" will
pass through the policy-making
machinery are those used when
new amendments are proposed.
According to the amendment
procedures, a proposal — which
must ultimately be approved by
two-thirds of student voters and
accepted by the University admin
istration — must first be placed on
the ballot by either a two-thirds
vote of the senate or by a petition
containing the signatures of 5 per
cent of the student body.
Furthermore, because the con
stitution was initially proposed at
last week's senate meeting, the
regulations stipulate that the sen
ate must place the measure on the
ballot by the end of Tuesday's
meeting — otherwise its support
ers must begin collecting signa
tures.
While it is highly likely this con
stitution could muster the roughly
700 signatures necessary for place
ment on the ballot, senate
approval is unquestionably a more
efficient and expedient route.
Accordingly, it is incumbent
upon the senate to act responsibly
Tuesday night and pass "Constitu
tion '96" along to the students —
as a unified whole and not, as has
been suggested, in separate pieces.
The student body — those who
form the ASSU's constituency —
must be permitted to vote on this
new plan.
