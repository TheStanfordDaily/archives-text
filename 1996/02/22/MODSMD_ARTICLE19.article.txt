## Finding fraternity in a frat 
### 
I LIVED IN a fraternity house my
sophomore year. It was not a good
choice, but it was the choice I made and
I stuck with it.
During that year I saw a lot of "male
bonding:" road trips and beer guzzling,
Sunday mornings spent piecing together
the house and the stories from the night
before, football games and wrestling on the
floor, barbecues and bar nights, initiation
and rush, pledges and paddles. All the
things, civil and otherwise, that go into cre
ating "fraternity."
I also went to a semi-formal. Prior to
this event I hadn't thought much of the
house's antics. When I rushed in the spring
I looked forward to most of it, as a pledge in
the fall I loathed the "pledge education
activities" and when I de-pledged in the
winter I was just glad to be done with it all
(though I retained my front-row seat as a
boarder in the house). But along the path
from eagerness to annoyance, then dread
to indifference, it was the semi-formal I
remember.
Our house was not exactly filled with
lady killers, so the semi-formal was highly
anticipated. The unattached guys began
getting squirrely weeks in advance. Like a
middle school dance, lewd and immature
conversation filled the air. Who was taking
who? Had anyone asked that frosh with
the big tits? Did she have a friend with big
tits?
As on many occasions, I tried to keep a

low profile, ignore the growing fervor, play
aloof. Of course, I could only plant my head
in the sand for so long. As the dance crept
up my anxiety became more insistent,
more pointed. Would I show up? Who
would I bring? And the real issue: what
would I bring?
The guys in the house never sensed my
stewing. They ignored all the warning
signs. My questions, conspicuously gender
neutral, went unheeded: "So, when should
I bring my date to the semi-formal?"
"Eight." "How should my date dress for
the semi-formal?" "Semi-formal. Duh."
"Well, should I buy a boutonniere?" "No,
that's your date's job." Clueless, absolutely
clueless. Sigh.
Two days before the dance I gathered
my nerve and decided to take the plunge. I
chose a date, and it was a he. On humblest
knee, I asked Michael, an old flame, to
share my ordeal. "Please," I begged, "come
to the coliseum. The Romans have asked so
nicely." He was initially reluctant, but
finally benevolent, and two days later we
found ourselves climbing the stairs to my
house, ties on squarely, matching bouton
nieres. Inside, unsuspecting guys and gals
danced, unaware of the homosexual men
ace lurking just beyond the threshold.
Well, the homosexual menace made a
fabulous entrance. If only the music had
screeched to a halt, it would have been per
fect. As it was, frat guys stared, sorority
girls gawked — all the cliches of a good

John Hughes movie. My date was a smash
ing success — unflappable, socially grace
ful, and, at 6-foot-l, 190 pounds, bigger
than nearly all my fraternity brothers.
I don't remember much of what fol
lowed. I vaguely recall a surreal panoply of
introductions and handshakes, from the
ridiculously courteous to the extremely
casual, but each was consistently self-con
scious. And I remember stares — not hos
tile, but stunned, like those of a deer
trapped in the headlights of an oncoming
car. They stared at us, we stared at them,
they stared back.
In all fairness, I can't say we didn't
enjoy ourselves. It was fun, but education
al too. I watched 36 men who had devoted
themselves to "fraternity" — forming
bonds of familiarity and trust between
men — completely wither. All their
nal skills were superfluous and useless
with us, men already remarkably adept at
this very skill.
When I dropped Michael off on his
doorstep, he smiled, thanked me and
kissed me goodnight, gently and kindly.
And he didn't even go through rush or
pledge or anything. He just closed his eyes
and went with it.
