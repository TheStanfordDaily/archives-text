Grad student urges University to examine maintenance

lAM HAPPY that Stanford University
is installing better sprinkler controls
and other water system upgrades in
Escondido Village. However, I have some
serious concerns about the manner in
which the work is being done.
A couple weeks into the winter term,
the residents of my courtyard received
notices that the water supply to our
homes would be turned off for a few
hours while the work was completed. We
were warned to expect some murky
water, and to run our taps for a while to
flush the system. A man even came
knocking on doors the afternoon of the
water shutdown to remind us about the
project. When the water was turned back
on, I did my duty and turned on our taps
to flush the system.
Thirty minutes later the taps were
still spewing filthy water the color of bad
coffee with milk. The hot water remained
dirty much longer than the cold water.
After nearly an hour of flushing, when
the water finally ran clean, the bottom of
our bathtub was covered in gritty sand
and thick sticky clay. I scrubbed our

kitchen and bathroom fixtures and hoped
that was the end of our troubles.
Unfortunately, our troubles were just
beginning. A few days later people start
ed getting sick in our courtyard. Not
with the usual pattern of a few cases to
start with and then gradually spreading
around. There were lots of sick people all
at once. I estimate that about one-third
of the residents suffered vomiting, diar
rhea and fever while another third had
cold-like symptoms.
I don't have either the time or the
research funding to perform an epidemi
ological study to prove that the sickness
resulted from contamination of the
water distribution system during the
maintenance work. However, the cir
cumstances are worrisome. Vomiting
and diarrhea are classical symptoms of
many waterborne pathogens. The spatial
extent of the sicknesses coincides uncan
nily well with the water pipe layout of
my courtyard as shown in the site plan
maps of Escondido Village. The low-rise
apartments are heated with recirculating
hot water. This type of system has been

shown to provide a fertile breeding
ground for bacteria if the system is con
taminated, especially if there is suffi
cient organic material introduced.
(Stephen Blatt et al, 1993, The American
Journal of Medicine 95:16-22. Co. Ford
ham von Reyn et al, 1994, The Lancet
343:1137-1141.)
The hot water system took much longer
to flush. However, this might be explained
merely by the extra volume of the hot
water heater. The boiler room blueprints
of the original construction I obtained
from Maps and Records do not make it
clear how the potable hot water system is
connected to the recirculating hot water
heating system. If they are connected, it is
very likely that the heating pipes are serv
ing as a reservoir of infectious agents.
As the maintenance work progresses
around the village, it will be interesting
to see if there are similar outbreaks of
disease in the areas affected by the shut
downs. I believe one section of the village
had a water shutdown last Friday. If the
system was contaminated, people should
be getting sick about now.

Even if there is no relationship between
the murky water and the sickness, I still
don't like the way the flushing was done.
For this volume of contamination, the best
i thing to do is to immediately flush the
main supply lines. Flushing through all
the little faucets in our homes isn't just
unappealing and inefficient. It isn't good
for the equipment and it poses a much
greater risk to our health.
I call upon Facilities Management to
put our minds at ease by explaining their
water system flushing techniques, the
connections between the heating system
and the hot tap water and the degree of
compliance with guidelines and regula
tions such as those set forth by the
American Water Works Association.
There is a lovely statue in front of your
office with an inscription urging you to
use science and reason to guard the pub
lic's health. Both as part of that public
and as an engineer training to join your
; profession, I ask you to heed the inscrip
tion and investigate this situation.
