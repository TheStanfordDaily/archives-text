# Josh Golhke: Laughing leads to crying
## A 						survival guide for the literature and fine arts DR 
### 
Another winter has come -
the winter of 1996. For many of my
enemies and friends, that means is
it's almost over â€” more specifically, for the
fully automated science majors among
them, it means they have to clench their
teeth, ball up their fists and take an English
class to fulfill a distribution requirement.
Ah, the hapless budding engineers sit
ting tight-lipped in corners of discussion sec
tions, intimidated to the point of speechless
ness at the thought of saying something
intelligent about, God forbid, T.S. Eliot. Is
this the way the world ends for you? With
not even so much as a whimper?
Providing answers to these questions
and others is my job, and nothing delights
me more than the prospect of granting the
gift of relevance to the people who for four
years have considered my field and me irrel
evant. The answer you lack: Unlike in the
sciences, where intelligence consists of
mind-numbing memorization of facts and
formulae, in the humanities it is purely a
matter of attitude. I think I'm smart, there
fore I am.
Like all great philosophies, this attitude

consists of a series of catch phrases and buz
zwords. Memorize them.
Problematic
The English major's own "abracadabra,"
this word is truly magical. It allows one to
comment on any facet of a text without the
annoying hassle of saying anything mean
ingful: "I can only say I found James' use of
the first person narrator problematic."
Very Aware
This phrase is used to describe the condi
tion of an author's contemporary readers.
Authors' audiences are never anything
other than "veiy aware," usually of histori
cal facts that mean nothing to us now.
"Hamlet is obviously commenting on the
displacement of the yeoman farmer by the
encroaching sheep-herders, and I think
Shakespeare's audience would have been
very aware of this."
The Vernacular
In the medieval period and early Renais
sance, "vernacular" means any language
other than Latin or Greek. All you're saying
is that the guy wrote in fucking Italian, but
it will sound brilliant. "The vernacular"
should aLso always be characterized as "sub

versive" or "revolutionary."
I don't know if anyone here has ever
read...
This phrase, if it precedes a sufficiently
obscure or difficult text, will rocket you into
pretentious authority, leaving your class
mates in the intellectual dust. It will also
allow you to make entirely tangential com
ments when you haven't done the assigned
reading. "I don't know if anyone here has
ever read Djuna Barnes' Nightwood, but
Ishmael reminds me very much of the
schizophrenic lesbian protagonist in that
novel."
"God"
References to "God" in humanities class
es should always be accompanied by quote
gestures with one's fingers, because, come
on, you don't really believe that crap, do
you?
Free Indirect Discourse
Every English major is familiar with this
phrase, yet no one knows exactly what it
means. Insert it in any otherwise low-quali
ty comment, and no one will be able to chal
lenge you: "I found Woolfs liberal use of
free iiidirect discourse quite problematic."

Since women are better than men...
Diane Middlebrook classes only: Begin
eveiy comment or question with this clause.
"Since women are better than men, how
much of our grade does the midterm count
for?"
I think we're overlooking the fact that
[insert author] was a white man
This statement is usually true, but be
sure to check before using it. Mistakes can
be disastrous: "I think we're overlooking
the fact that Toni Morrison was a white
man."
Hilarious
Used to describe texts that are supposed
ly satirical or clever, even though they do
not so much as provoke a smirk in the mod
ern reader. "If Sir Toby makes another
hilarious double entendre like 'Hold thy
peace,' which could also be taken for the
phallic 'Hold thy piece,' I think I'm going to
bust a gut."
Finally, be sure to avoid the following
common errors.
References to movies
Bringing up television shows or movies
in class discussions will immediately make

you an idiot in the eyes of any English
mqjor. "I'm no expert on Jonathan Swift,
but is anyone else getting a 'Spaceballs' vibe
here?"
Colloquialisms
Stanford people become so used to their
annoying lingo they forget how stupid it
makes them sound. But words like "ran
dom" and "sweet" ruin any attempt at liter
ary criticism: "I thought the implication of
incest was kind of a sketchy move by Poe."
Gangsta I tap
Although an important cultural phe
nomenon in the late 20th century, gangsta
rap still has no place in the analysis of liter
ature: "In this poem, John Donne appears
to be saying, 'Bitches ain't shit but ho's and
tricks.'"
Remember, in the humanities, it's not
what you know, it's what other people think
you know. Now go do some outside reading.

Josh Gohlke has never gotten a Bin an
English class.
