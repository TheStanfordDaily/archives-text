## Cardinal hoopsters to battle Washington State Men looking to regroup after Oregon loss 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Second place in the conference
with five games to go. A half-game
lead over third-place Arizona. The
February Fervor before March
Madness. In other words, the worst
time for the rug to be pulled out
from head coach Mike Mont
gomery's rock-solid rotation.
But that's exactly what hap
pened to No. 24 Stanford. Junior
Rich Jackson, whose contributions
aren't reflected in the box score
every game, tore his anterior cruci
ate ligament in his left knee Tues
day, ending his season.
That left the Cardinal (16-6
overall, 9-4 Pacific 10 Conference)
scrambling for a new substitution
pattern, and Montgomery staring
at a bench primarily made up of
freshmen and a 7-foot tall question
mark in the potential return of
sophomore center Tim Young.
"The kids feel really bad for
Rich," Montgomery said. "He's
such a good guy and he's worked so
hard to get in position to con
tribute. He gives you 100 percent of
what he's got, and everyone appre
ciates that."
As for the return of Young,
Montgomery said the decision to
play or redshirt was still in Young's
hands. He has been practicing this
week but not with the starters, and
Montgomery noted that Young
does not yet have the timing needed
to return.
"Really, Tim was not real good
until [Tuesday]," Montgomery
said. He also noted how the loss of
Jackson, a small forward, cannot be
immediately offset by the addition
of a center. By putting Young back
into the lineup, Stanford would
have to shift several players away
from positions they've spent the
last three months learning.
