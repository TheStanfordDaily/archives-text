## Cardinal hoopsters to battle Washington State Men looking to regroup after Oregon loss 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Second place in the conference
with five games to go. A half-game
lead over third-place Arizona. The
February Fervor before March
Madness. In other words, the worst
time for the rug to be pulled out
from head coach Mike Mont
gomery's rock-solid rotation.
But that's exactly what hap
pened to No. 24 Stanford. Junior
Rich Jackson, whose contributions
aren't reflected in the box score
every game, tore his anterior cruci
ate ligament in his left knee Tues
day, ending his season.
That left the Cardinal (16-6
overall, 9-4 Pacific 10 Conference)
scrambling for a new substitution
pattern, and Montgomery staring
at a bench primarily made up of
freshmen and a 7-foot tall question
mark in the potential return of
sophomore center Tim Young.
"The kids feel really bad for
Rich," Montgomery said. "He's
such a good guy and he's worked so
hard to get in position to con
tribute. He gives you 100 percent of
what he's got, and everyone appre
ciates that."
As for the return of Young,
Montgomery said the decision to
play or redshirt was still in Young's
hands. He has been practicing this
week but not with the starters, and
Montgomery noted that Young
does not yet have the timing needed
to return.
"Really, Tim was not real good
until [Tuesday]," Montgomery
said. He also noted how the loss of
Jackson, a small forward, cannot be
immediately offset by the addition
of a center. By putting Young back
into the lineup, Stanford would
have to shift several players away
from positions they've spent the
last three months learning.

Senior Darren Allaway looks for an open teammate against UCLA two
weeks ago. Stanford takes on WSU tonight at Maples Pavilion.
"Do you take a kid's year away to
squeeze out one or two more wins?"
Montgomery wondered. "Our ulti
mate objective is to be as fair to the
kids as you possibly can and not tot
put anybody in jeopardy."
With a red-hot Washington
State (13-8, 5-7) coming to Maples
Pavilion tonight at 7:30 p.m. with
revenge on its mind, Montgomery
has little time to assemble a new ro
tation.
Before Jackson's injury, Mont
gomery had a clear reserve at each
position. By defining the roles his
reserves needed to play, Mont
gomery said he could cut down on
confusion among the freshmen.
"Now we've got to start moving
people around more," Montgomeiy
said. "[Andy] Poppink will move out
to the three some, or Peter Sauer, if
we want to go big. We could also
move [Kris] Weems over to three."
While Weems is coming off a ca
reer-high 16 points against Oregon
last Saturday, Sauer has been ham
pered with an injured left hand and
the flu. After seeing double-figure

minutes in 11 of his first 16 games,
he has played more than eight min
utes only once in four contests since
returning to the lineup Jan. 31
against Cal.
"The last time against Washing
ton State our freshman post players
saved our bacon," Montgomery
said. "But Sauer's been out, and he
really needs to get cooking again."
Stanford defeated the Cougars
78-67 on Jan. 27 behind 12 points
from freshman Mark Seaton and
eight from Sauer. Both played more
minutes than senior frontcourt
starters Poppink and Darren Ail
away.
But the Washington State team
Stanford faces tonight has one key
ingredient — a healthy Mark Hen
drickson. The 6-foot-9, 240-pound
senior had just come back from a
broken shooting hand the first time
these teams played and still man
aged 16 points and 10 rebounds.
Now, he's back in playing form, av
eraging 15.9 points and 9.7 re
bounds per game.
"[Hendrickson] requires help
[defensively]," Allaway said. "He
didn't play really well against us,
but now I hear he's playing really
well, finishing plays. [DonminicJ
Ellison, [Isaac] Fontaine and Hen

drickson are very dangerous."
Over the Cougars' current four
game winning streak, the back
court of Ellison, Fontaine and Sha
mon Antrum have combined to hit
29 of 53 three-pointers, a net
scorching 54 percent clip. Fontaine
leads the Pac-10 at 50 percent from
behind the three-point line.
Montgomery will face a dilemma
defensively over whom to put on
Hendrickson and Fontaine. Ail
away will probably get the nod to
guard Hendrickson to keep Poppink
out of foul trouble. However, if Pop
pink slides out to small forward and
matches up against the quicker
Fontaine, he is once again checking
a player outside his normal position.
