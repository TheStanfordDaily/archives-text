						long road back for Tim Young

It wasn't enough to be back practicing with the team.
The 8-foot fade-away jumper in scrimmage wasn't sat
isfying either. After three hours of practice in his second
day back from injury, sophomore Tim Young headed
straight to the stationary bike for more training.
A herniated disk in Young's back forced him out of
the Stanford men's basketball lineup after the fifth
game of the season. But the 7-foot-l center avoided
surgery and its subsequent six-month rehabilitation pe
riod, and he is back running the floor with the Cardinal
squad.
Despite his return to practice, it is doubtful that
Young will see action this season.
"I feel really good," Young said. "[My back is] a little
sore, but other than that it's not bad. But I'm nowhere
near game shape. I don't really know [when I will be]
and, to be honest, I'm not really thinking about it that
way because I am going to redshirt."
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery attested to
the fact that Young would not see the floor until next
year despite the fact that he could get his timing and
conditioning back soon.
"I think he has reassigned himself and I think he's
changed his goals to get himself ready and get back in
shape," Montgomery said. "Tim probably looks at it as
an opportunity now to be better down the road and start

fresh again next year."
Yet with the Pacific 10 Conference race and NCAA
tournament bids and seedings at stake, Montgomery
could not help but imagine having his 7-footer back in
uniform.
"It would certainly help," Montgomery said.
"There's no way you wouldn't want to bring him back.
We've got a pretty good little chemistry going with the
lineup that we're playing and now you would be bring
ing a big physical guy in. There have been circumstances
where having a nice big target would help and you could
use him that way. But I'm not sure that's what Tim has
in mind."
Young, like Montgomery, knows he could help out,
but the prospect of playing a limited role is not very at
tractive to him.
"I think if I came back, I'd be able to contribute, but
not the way I want to," Young said. "There's only four
games left, so from my point of view, it would be better
for me to take the fifth year."
Regardless, having Young back in practice will be
beneficial, both for him and for the team. The team can
use Young to get used to playing against a 7-foot center,
and the practice will be extremely important for the
sophomore.
"Getting him back in practice now will really
help him because it's valuable to get him back on
