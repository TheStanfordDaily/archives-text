# A 						long road back for Tim Young
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
It wasn't enough to be back practicing with the team.
The 8-foot fade-away jumper in scrimmage wasn't sat
isfying either. After three hours of practice in his second
day back from injury, sophomore Tim Young headed
straight to the stationary bike for more training.
A herniated disk in Young's back forced him out of
the Stanford men's basketball lineup after the fifth
game of the season. But the 7-foot-l center avoided
surgery and its subsequent six-month rehabilitation pe
riod, and he is back running the floor with the Cardinal
squad.
Despite his return to practice, it is doubtful that
Young will see action this season.
"I feel really good," Young said. "[My back is] a little
sore, but other than that it's not bad. But I'm nowhere
near game shape. I don't really know [when I will be]
and, to be honest, I'm not really thinking about it that
way because I am going to redshirt."
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery attested to
the fact that Young would not see the floor until next
year despite the fact that he could get his timing and
conditioning back soon.
"I think he has reassigned himself and I think he's
changed his goals to get himself ready and get back in
shape," Montgomery said. "Tim probably looks at it as
an opportunity now to be better down the road and start

fresh again next year."
Yet with the Pacific 10 Conference race and NCAA
tournament bids and seedings at stake, Montgomery
could not help but imagine having his 7-footer back in
uniform.
"It would certainly help," Montgomery said.
"There's no way you wouldn't want to bring him back.
We've got a pretty good little chemistry going with the
lineup that we're playing and now you would be bring
ing a big physical guy in. There have been circumstances
where having a nice big target would help and you could
use him that way. But I'm not sure that's what Tim has
in mind."
Young, like Montgomery, knows he could help out,
but the prospect of playing a limited role is not very at
tractive to him.
"I think if I came back, I'd be able to contribute, but
not the way I want to," Young said. "There's only four
games left, so from my point of view, it would be better
for me to take the fifth year."
Regardless, having Young back in practice will be
beneficial, both for him and for the team. The team can
use Young to get used to playing against a 7-foot center,
and the practice will be extremely important for the
sophomore.

sits two games behind the Bruins
in the race for the Pac-10 crown
after a heartbreaking loss to Ore
gon last weekend.
With Young's scoring, re
bounding and size missing, the
Cardinal needed something else
to fill the void in order to compete
in the conference. That some
thing has been the Stanford
bench, making up for Young's 10
points and nine rebounds per
game by adding nearly 20 points
and 11 boards per outing.
"I really think our freshmen
have [stepped up in Tim's ab
sence]," Montgomery said. "If our
freshmen had not done as well as
they have, we would be very vul
nerable to any one person not
having a good performance."
The bench's success was ap
parent in the first half of the Car
dinal's recent upset against
UCLA. With starting center Dar
ren Allaway on the bench in foul
trouble, freshman Mark Seaton
sparked the team and the crowd
with three dunks. A tight Bruin
defense shadowed senior starting
guard Dion Cross all half, but
freshman Kris Weems substitut
ed for Cross and converted two
crucial three-pointers.
"I think when Tim went out, it
made everyone move up a spot,"
said junior reserve Rich Jackson,
who is also out for the season with
a knee injury. "So our rotation on
the bench got to be really solid. We
each had clearly defined roles, and
it helps so much to get consistent
minutes off the bench."
When Young went out, howev
er, it was not the Pac-10 title or
the NCAA tournament that
Young was initially worried
about.
"I thought I wouldn't be able to
walk again," he said. "My leg, the
nerve was pinched. I couldn't
walk too well. Thoughts like that
always cross my mind.
"It's been one of the hardest
things in my life to do. For the
first few weeks, it was so hard to
accept actually having the injury.
It took a long time to realize that I
do have this problem and I just
have to deal with it. It was hard."
Young's love for the game also
made the injury difficult to swal

low.
"I think it was [hard for him]
because basketball is such a big
part of his life," Jackson said.
"He's one of those basketball
junkiss. He loves basketball. He
would go out to the court in the
back of our dorm and shoot occa
sionally. I think it was hard for
him to know what to do."
However, Young is now look
ing at the injury as a positive. He
has been able to appreciate Stan

ford socially and academically in
his absence from the court, and he
has gained additional perspective
on basketball.
"I think early in the season I
was just thinking too much and
not really appreciating the game,"
he said. "Now that I haven't had it
for a while, I'm just happy to be
playing and it's just more fun.
"I think looking back on this
injury, it's probably been a really
good thing."

"I think he has reassigned himself and I think he's
changed his goals to get himself ready and get back in
shape," Montgomery said. "Tim probably looks at it as
an opportunity now to be better down the road and start

fresh again next year."
Yet with the Pacific 10 Conference race and NCAA
tournament bids and seedings at stake, Montgomery
could not help but imagine having his 7-footer back in
uniform.
"It would certainly help," Montgomery said.
"There's no way you wouldn't want to bring him back.
We've got a pretty good little chemistry going with the
lineup that we're playing and now you would be bring
ing a big physical guy in. There have been circumstances
where having a nice big target would help and you could
use him that way. But I'm not sure that's what Tim has
in mind."
Young, like Montgomery, knows he could help out,
but the prospect of playing a limited role is not very at
tractive to him.
"I think if I came back, I'd be able to contribute, but
not the way I want to," Young said. "There's only four
games left, so from my point of view, it would be better
for me to take the fifth year."
Regardless, having Young back in practice will be
beneficial, both for him and for the team. The team can
use Young to get used to playing against a 7-foot center,
and the practice will be extremely important for the
sophomore.

With Young's scoring, re

Cardinal needed something else
to fill the void in order to compete
in the conference. That some
thing has been the Stanford
bench, making up for Young's 10
points and nine rebounds per
game by adding nearly 20 points
and 11 boards per outing.

said junior reserve Rich Jackson,

a knee injury. "So our rotation on
the bench got to be really solid. We

it helps so much to get consistent
minutes off the bench."
When Young went out, howev
er, it was not the Pac-10 title or
the NCAA tournament that
Young was initially worried
about.
"I thought I wouldn't be able to
walk again," he said. "My leg, the
nerve was pinched. I couldn't
walk too well. Thoughts like that
always cross my mind.
"It's been one of the hardest
things in my life to do. For the
first few weeks, it was so hard to
accept actually having the injury.
It took a long time to realize that I
do have this problem and I just
have to deal with it. It was hard."
Young's love for the game also
made the injury difficult to swal

low.
"I think it was [hard for him]
because basketball is such a big
part of his life," Jackson said.
"He's one of those basketball
junkiss. He loves basketball. He
would go out to the court in the
back of our dorm and shoot occa
sionally. I think it was hard for
him to know what to do."
However, Young is now look
ing at the injury as a positive. He
has been able to appreciate Stan

ford socially and academically in
his absence from the court, and he
has gained additional perspective
on basketball.
"I think early in the season I
was just thinking too much and
not really appreciating the game,"
he said. "Now that I haven't had it
for a while, I'm just happy to be
playing and it's just more fun.
"I think looking back on this
injury, it's probably been a really
good thing."

Tim Young, who herniated a disk in his back earlier thisyear, will take
a medical redshirtfor the season.
It wasn't enough to be back practicing with the team.
The 8-foot fade-away jumper in scrimmage wasn't sat
isfying either. After three hours of practice in his second
day back from injury, sophomore Tim Young headed
straight to the stationary bike for more training.
A herniated disk in Young's back forced him out of
the Stanford men's basketball lineup after the fifth
game of the season. But the 7-foot-l center avoided
surgery and its subsequent six-month rehabilitation pe
riod, and he is back running the floor with the Cardinal
squad.
Despite his return to practice, it is doubtful that
Young will see action this season.
"I feel really good," Young said. "[My back is] a little
sore, but other than that it's not bad. But I'm nowhere
near game shape. I don't really know [when I will be]
and, to be honest, I'm not really thinking about it that
way because I am going to redshirt."
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery attested to
the fact that Young would not see the floor until next
year despite the fact that he could get his timing and
conditioning back soon.
"I think he has reassigned himself and I think he's
changed his goals to get himself ready and get back in
shape," Montgomery said. "Tim probably looks at it as
an opportunity now to be better down the road and start

fresh again next year."
