# Cardinal to take on best in country

### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
It's not May just yet, but the third-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team is heading out of town for a team
championship, the University of Wisconsin's National
Indoor Collegiate Team Tennis Championship.
The Cardinal (7-0, 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division), coming off of two big conference victories
over No. 10 Arizona and No. 14 Arizona State, collides
with No. 16 Vanderbilt (5-1) in the first round early this
morning.
Despite the tournament's early position in the tennis
season, the field features four of the top five teams in the
nation and a number of representatives from the elite
tennis conferences.
"The Indoor Team Championship is something we al
ways look forward to," head coach Frank Brennan said.
"It's a real test because it's all interregional play. You
don't usually get a chance to have a lot of interregional
play. So if you take a loss to Vanderbilt, it's going to be on
your soul forever because you're not going to play them
again next week.
"In addition you get to play maybe a Duke or a Florida
or a Georgia, who you don't normally play. It will defi
nitely be our one and only opportunity to play those
teams and that will affect the seedings."
With the opening of the Six Pac schedule last weekend
and the tournament this weekend, the Cardinal's season
is quietly heating up.
"I think it started with the Arizonas," Brennan said.
"That was good. They were a really good test. They al
ways are, but they were a particularly a good test this
year, especially Arizona."
The Cardinal grabbed their first conference victory of
the season last Friday with a 6-3 win over the Wildcats
and extended their conference dominance against the
