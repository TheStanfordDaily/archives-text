# Cardinal to take on best in country
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
It's not May just yet, but the third-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team is heading out of town for a team
championship, the University of Wisconsin's National
Indoor Collegiate Team Tennis Championship.
The Cardinal (7-0, 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division), coming off of two big conference victories
over No. 10 Arizona and No. 14 Arizona State, collides
with No. 16 Vanderbilt (5-1) in the first round early this
morning.
Despite the tournament's early position in the tennis
season, the field features four of the top five teams in the
nation and a number of representatives from the elite
tennis conferences.
"The Indoor Team Championship is something we al
ways look forward to," head coach Frank Brennan said.
"It's a real test because it's all interregional play. You
don't usually get a chance to have a lot of interregional
play. So if you take a loss to Vanderbilt, it's going to be on
your soul forever because you're not going to play them
again next week.
"In addition you get to play maybe a Duke or a Florida
or a Georgia, who you don't normally play. It will defi
nitely be our one and only opportunity to play those
teams and that will affect the seedings."
With the opening of the Six Pac schedule last weekend
and the tournament this weekend, the Cardinal's season
is quietly heating up.
"I think it started with the Arizonas," Brennan said.
"That was good. They were a really good test. They al
ways are, but they were a particularly a good test this
year, especially Arizona."
The Cardinal grabbed their first conference victory of
the season last Friday with a 6-3 win over the Wildcats
and extended their conference dominance against the

Sun Devils on Saturday. Stanford's
7-1 triumph represented its 16th
consecutive Six-Pac win, dating
back to the 1994 season.
As for the 16-team tournament,
the Cardinal received the second
seed, behind only No. 1 Florida The
third and fourth seeds Eire Duke and
Brigham Young, respectively. No
tably absent from the field is No. 2
Texas. The defending champion
Longhorns will not compete in this
year's tournament.
Stanford's first round opponent,
Vanderbilt, finished last season
with a 15-8 record and have begun
this year with wins over Minnesota,
Florida State and Kentucky. Their
sole loss of the season came at the
hands of No. 16 Notre Dame, 5-4.
The Commodores are led by
Meredith Chiles, a senior transfer
from UCLA. Chiles is the 62nd
ranked singles player in the coun
try. She will meet Cardinal All-
American junior Ania Bleszynski in
the first round. Bleszynski current
ly ranks No. 5 in the country in sin
gles and boasts a 6-1 dual-match

record this season.
Stanford may find itself staring
at a familiar face in the second
round. If the Cardinal takes care of
business and Arizona defeats No. 9
Tennessee, the teams will clash for
the second time in one week.
"I can't believe we may play
them in the second round," Bren
nan said. "They have got to be the
third or fourth best team in the
tournament."
With a 6-3 win fresh in their
minds, the Cardinal, if necessary,
should be primed and ready to take
down the Wildcats.
"I think [the win] should work in
our favor," Brennan said. "We
should be confident. I think they
should think 'Stanford's pretty
good; they just beat us.'
"Now, of course, the twist is
we're going indoors. I think our
girls probably play a little better in
doors than their girls do."
The rest of the Cardinal's brack
et includes No. 6 California, No. 8
Wake Forest and a Pepperdine
squad which Stanford defeated
soundly in the first round of last
season's NCAA Tournament.
The other half of the bracket is
highlighted by Florida, Duke, Geor
gia and No. 7 UCLA.
