# Women try to stay perfect in conference
## 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's basketball squad has as
sembled more than a handful of impressive streaks
through the years. Washington State will try to end
a couple of those tonight at 7 p.m., as the Cougars
(15-8, 6-6 Pacific 10 Conference) seek their first
ever victory over the No. 4 Cardinal (20-2,13-0).
With a 21-0 record against head coach Harold
Rhodes' team, Stanford has mastered the Cougars
like no other squad has done to a conference oppo
nent. This year's WSU team, trying to win an
NCAA tournament game for the first time, has fall
en on difficult times after a promising 6-3 start in
the conference. Led by Pac-10 Player of the Year
candidate Jenni Ruff, who averages over 22 points
per game to place in the nation's top 20, the
Cougars have enjoyed success at home in Friel
Court, despite weak attendance.

swing player Julie Wight, freshman point guard
Jade Hyett and even senior center Kristin Erickson
all fire often from three-point range. Erickson has
been the team's most pleasant surprise, blossoming
in a starting role for the graduated Kireen Ellis and
the injured Amy Saneholtz. She places second on
the team in scoring.
Hyett has stepped in to the starting point guard
role for the graduated Susie Jarosch and has dished
the ball well despite a rash of turnovers. Sopho
more center Yvonne Kunze, although one of the
slowest players in the conference, has shown signs
of brilliance and signs of mediocrity in the post.
After just missing out on the tournament last
year, the Cougars need to finish strong to sneak in
with an at-large bid. With only two teams (Stanford
and Oregon State) assured of berths, the Washing-

ton schools, Oregon and Arizona
are battling to join the fray.
"I think it's going to be a tough
call for more than three teams to get
a nod, but we'll have to see," said
Cardinal head coach Amy Tucker.
While the Cougars are trying to
break a three-game losing skid, the
Cardinal is attempting to secure its
15th consecutive win, which would
match last season's longest streak,
the third-longest in Stanford histo
ry. With 22 consecutive Pac-10 vic
tories dating back to last year,
Stanford is six shy of its own record
established in 1990-91.
In last week's homestand
against the Oregon schools, Stan
ford suffered through mediocre
first halves before sophomore for
ward Olympia Scott scored the first
several buckets of the second half.
"We want to win the conference,
which, barring a total collapse,
should happen. We want to be a No.
1 seed in the West [Regional], and
we need to make a strong state
ment in our conference to do that,"
Tucker said.
