# Did somebody say three-peat?
## Stanford heads to ITA Indoors 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
This week, the top-ranked
Stanford men's tennis team will
attempt to three-peat as the ITA
National Indoor champions. The
Cardinal, currently riding a na
tion's-best 34-match win streak,
go in as the No. 1 seed in the tour
ney, which will take place Thurs
day through Sunday. But it will
not be easy for them to defend the
title. Each of the top nine teams in
the country will be competing, in
cluding UCLA, Georgia and Mis
sissippi, the No. 2, 3 and 4 seeds
respectively.
Senior captain Jeff Salzenstein
said he is not concerned about
being the two-time defending
champion or worried about the
winning streak. "Obviously, this is
a new year and we have a new
team. Right now, we're just con
cerned with playing Kentucky
[Stanford's first round oppo
nent]."
Stanford will switch their line
up slightly from their last match.
Salzenstein, freshman Ryan
Wolters, sophomore Paul Gold
stein, senior Jim Thomas, junior
Grant Elliott and senior Ricky
Becker will play in the one
through six positions, respective

In the doubles, Stanford will

team Salzenstein and Wolters to
gether as its first team. That duo
looked very promising in jumping
out to a 5-0 lead over California last
Sunday before rain prevented the

match from being completed. At
second and third doubles will be the
teams of Thomas and Goldstein,

and Becker and Elliott.
The Cardinal will be a heavy fa
vorite in its first-round match
against the 21st-ranked Wildcats.
Should they, as expected, advance
to the quarterfinals with a win
over Kentucky, they will probably
face the fifth-ranked Texas Chris
tian Horned Frogs.
TCU boasts the top two doubles
teams in the country, and the No.
2-ranked player in senior Paul
Robinson. "TCU is extremely
strong," said head coach Dick
Gould. "They have a couple great

doubles teams and two or three of
the top singles players. They'll be
tough."
The most prominent threat to a
Cardinal three-peat, however, is
the second-ranked UCLA squad.
"UCLA looks very good so far,"
Salzenstein said. "They've just
been killing everyone." Should the
tournament go according to form,
Stanford would meet the Bruins
in the finals on Sunday afternoon.
"It's usually a good tourna
ment for us," Gould said. "We're
the defending champs and we're
looking forward to it."
How Stanford performs this
week could be indicative of how
they will fare in the NCAA cham
pionships held in late May.
