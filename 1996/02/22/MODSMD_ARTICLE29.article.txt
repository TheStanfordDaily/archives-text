# The 						meaning of sports — a different perspective
## 
### 
It used to be "step it up." Before that, it
was "we just have to play 'em one day
at a time."
Now it's "perspective."
Every once and a while a harmless
cliche enters the sports arena, usually
making it easier to criticize sports writers
and commentators, and to chuckle at
sports fans in general.
Perspective, the newest installment of
the over-used sports cliche, is not so in
nocuous. In fact, the word sends shivers
up my spine right about now.
For those of you who haven't the foggi
est clue what I am talking about, perspec
tive is what dawns on a player, a coach or
a team when something (generally a
tragedy) makes sports seem trivial. One
recent example occurred in the NFC
championship game, when two players
ran into Gil Haskell, the Packers' wide re
ceivers coach. Haskell was knocked un
conscious for five minutes, and was later
diagnosed with a fractured skull.
During, following, and even still a
month after the game, every announcer,
writer and fan could be heard at some
point uttering the words: "Wow,
Haskell's injury sure puts things in per
spective."
Other "eye-openers" include the
spinal cord injury of Detroit Lions line
man Mike Utley, the near-fatal car acci

dent of Sacramento Kings point guard
Bobby Hurley, and even more tragic, the
deaths of Loyola Marymount's Hank
Gathers, Boston Celtic Reggie Lewis and
most recently, Dayton Flyer center Chris

Daniels, who died last week of unknown
causes.
Yes, it is true that these tragedies
make sports seem insignificant, and
should provide perspective for anyone,
not just those involved in sports. The
problem is that I don't think any of this
perspective stuff is sinking in.
When Hank Gathers collapsed, I cried.
It was one of the most horrifying things I
had ever seen in the sports world. The day
following Gathers' death, I read story
after story in various newspapers and
watched segment after segment on televi-

sion. Half of the pieces focused on
Gathers' life, his career and the im
pact he had on the lives of his
friends and family. The other half,
however, focused on the effect his
death would have on the LMU team
he left behind. Whether or not they
would be able to make it far in the
tournament was of primary impor
tance to many. I cringed at those ar
ticles, and admired how the LMU
players dedicated their season to
Hank, and played through the ad
versity in his honor.
Sports Illustrated offered the
most recent abuse of perspective in
last week's Inside College Basket
ball section. SI devoted a column to
the memory of Daniels, Dayton's
senior standout. I applaud the mag
azine for this effort, but was ap
palled at the slant the article pro
vided.
Daniels was lauded as the ideal
student-athlete, which judging by
the comments made on the Dayton
Flyer Basketball Home Page, was
an accurate portrayal. The SI col
umn begins: "The death of any
young athlete is a tragedy, but the
sudden passing of Dayton center
Chris Daniels is particularly sober
ing." Naturally, my curiosity
piqued as to why Daniels' death was
more sobering than Gathers',
Lewis', or even Len Bias'.
I was shocked when the next
paragraph listed Daniels' stats for
the season, commented on his vast
improvement, and implied that this
was the center's best season ever. It
was not until I was inundated with

Daniels' accomplishments on the
court, that I was able to read about
his academic achievements, his
friends and family and what type of
person he really was.
Maybe it was just a bad editing
job. But an even scarier possibility is
that someone at SI actually believes
that Daniels' death is more tragic
because he was having the best sea
son of his career. If that's the case,
SI should be ashamed of itself.
The dreaded disease of perspec
tive, or lack thereof, has hit the
Farm as well. When sophomore
Tim Young herniated a disk in his
back earlier this year, he had fears
of not being able to walk properly
again. His concerns were not about
points-per-game, tournaments, or
conference titles — he was con
cerned about life.
Yet no one followed his example.
The comments I heard were:
"There goes the season," or "I
guess UCLA just wrapped up an
other Pac-10 title." No expressions
of concern for Young's health or
well-being, just "so much for the
tournament."
Fortunately, Young's injury was
not as serious as once thought and
the 7-footer is practicing with the
team again. I'm sure that pleases
every Stanford hoops fan, because
after all, it's a happy ending.
Not all stories end happily,
though.
We must respect the tragedies
that we encounter, deal with the in
juries that never heal, and cope
with the emotional scars that never
go away. And, above all, we must
learn and understand "perspec
tive," so we do not become the un
feeling, often hypocritical, sports
world that we seem to be.
