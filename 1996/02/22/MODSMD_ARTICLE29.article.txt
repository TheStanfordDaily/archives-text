# The
						meaning of sports â€” a different perspective
## 
### 
It used to be "step it up." Before that, it
was "we just have to play 'em one day
at a time."
Now it's "perspective."
Every once and a while a harmless
cliche enters the sports arena, usually
making it easier to criticize sports writers
and commentators, and to chuckle at
sports fans in general.
Perspective, the newest installment of
the over-used sports cliche, is not so in
nocuous. In fact, the word sends shivers
up my spine right about now.
For those of you who haven't the foggi
est clue what I am talking about, perspec
tive is what dawns on a player, a coach or
a team when something (generally a
tragedy) makes sports seem trivial. One
recent example occurred in the NFC
championship game, when two players
ran into Gil Haskell, the Packers' wide re
ceivers coach. Haskell was knocked un
conscious for five minutes, and was later
diagnosed with a fractured skull.
During, following, and even still a
month after the game, every announcer,
writer and fan could be heard at some
point uttering the words: "Wow,
Haskell's injury sure puts things in per
spective."
Other "eye-openers" include the
spinal cord injury of Detroit Lions line
man Mike Utley, the near-fatal car acci

dent of Sacramento Kings point guard
Bobby Hurley, and even more tragic, the
deaths of Loyola Marymount's Hank
Gathers, Boston Celtic Reggie Lewis and
most recently, Dayton Flyer center Chris

Daniels, who died last week of unknown
causes.
Yes, it is true that these tragedies
make sports seem insignificant, and
should provide perspective for anyone,
not just those involved in sports. The
problem is that I don't think any of this
perspective stuff is sinking in.
When Hank Gathers collapsed, I cried.
It was one of the most horrifying things I
had ever seen in the sports world. The day
following Gathers' death, I read story
after story in various newspapers and
watched segment after segment on televi-
