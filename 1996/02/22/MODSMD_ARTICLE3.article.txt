# Faculty Senate to consider 'time clock' cap
## Proposal would require faculty members to obtain tenure in 10 years 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
The Faculty Sen
ate today will vote on
a proposal that would
put a 10-year cap on
the tenure "time
clock" — the time by
which faculty mem
bers must either be
granted tenure or va
cate their positions.

The report by the Ad Hoc Committee
on the Professoriate also recommends
creating a new promotional track for re
search professors which would allow
such faculty to remain at the University
after their initial appointment expires.
Another proposal by the committee
would expand the criteria for qualifica
tion to be a principal investigator at the

University — someone who directs a re
search project — to include members of
the Medical Center line faculty. Such in
dividuals are physicians hired by the
Medical Center to provide patient care,
but are not granted full faculty benefits.
According to Director of the Institute
for International Studies Walter Falcon,
chair of the ad hoc committee, the "most
important" work the committee did — a
review of the polity for granting tenure
in the School of Medicine — will not be
presented at today's meeting.
The committee's suggestions for revi
sions of the tenure policy "hadn't been
adequately discussed throughout the
Medical School" to warrant presenta
tion, Falcon said.
If the senate approves the commit
tee's recommendations, all tenure-track
appointments made after Aug. 31 will be
subject to the 10-year time limit, regard

less of unpaid or maternity leaves or pe
riods spent in an administrative ap
pointment. The policy will retain a
seven-year "probation" period along
with the 10-year cap, under which
tenure consideration may occur after
seven complete years of service.
In addition, the committee will rec
ommend doing away with existing poli
cies thnt specify a two-child limit on the
number of tenure-clock extensions a
new mother can take. Typically, a facul
ty member is entitled to a one-year ex
tension of her tenure clock afler giving
birth. Now, the extension will be grant
ed even if the mother chooses to take less
than one year of leave.
The recommendations seek to revise
tenure policies to make them both time
ly and considerate of special circum
stances, Falcon said.
The committee will recommend a

promotion track in the research profes
soriate much like the line in the non-re
search professoriate: promotions from
assistant professor to associate and full
professor, respectively.
In addition, appointments of assis
tant professors for research will he re
newable for up to six years, and associate
research professorships will be renew
able indefinitely. ,
The problem with the existing struc
ture, snid Molecular Pharmacology
Prof, and committee member Phyllis
Gardner, is that there is no promotion
track, making it "hard on people's lives."
Finally, the committee proposes that
Medical Center line faculty be permitted
to be principal investigators, as long as
their research is "predominantly clinical
in nature and having to do with patient
