						RECIPE FOR FINESSE: the Empire Brass Quintet
## 
### ELIZABETH MURTAUGH 
Music is most memorable when it
doesn't sound like itself. Bizarre,
.but true. Occasionally when sound
transcends its tones, ears can be tricked into
mistaking one instrument for another.
Close your eyes at an Empire Brass con
cert, and the interplay of instruments will
start to sound like a choral ensemble. The
trumpet becomes a seamless soprano, the
French horn a sweetly somber alto, the trom
bone an open-throated baritone and the tuba
a thick, bottomless tenor.
Rolf Smedvig, the founder of and lead
trumpet for the world-famous quintet
says,"the really captivating thing about brass
is that the sound is so similar to a human
voice. Brass instruments have an amazingly
diverse and fluid range ofsound qualities that
lets their music sing with a certain virtuosity
that is simply breathtaking."
The finest
Widely hailed as the best brass ensemble in
the world, the Empire Brass Quintet has daz
zled audiences everywhere from Rome to
Tokyo and most places between. This Satur
day, they're doing the Stanford community
the honor of playing at Dinkelspiel Auditori
um.
Among their long list of claims to fame is
their repertoire's stylistic and historical diver
sity, which is expansive enough to satisfy any
musical sensibility imaginable. Name the
style, pick the period, and both are sure to be
somewhere on their concert line-up.
This Saturday's program is just as diverse
as their reputation, featuring selections of
Scarlatti, Mozart, Greig, Debussy, Prokofiev,
as well as a few hymns and spiritual dances
composed before the Christian era.
To the average college student, baroque
and classical music — the music most young
people call "old" — can sound antique, per
haps antiquated. The thought of listening to
Bach or Beethoven might seem like an intel
lectual workout not worth the waste of men
tal energy that could be saved by sticking to
no-brainer Live 105 grunge.
Think again.
The music of Empire Brass is as accessible
as any kind around, and better than most.
They do the two thing that make fan clubs of
audiences, and do them brilliantly. They
choose an impressive range of fantastic music
for their programs and play it even more fan
tastically.
Their concerts are as captivating for neo
phytes to the classical scene as they are for the
die-hard cult following that flocks to their
shows wherever they're playing.
Newcomers who hear their crystalline
sonority for the first time learn that there is a
lot more to brass music than marching band
melodies and military-style fanfare. Old
timers — well acquainted with the feeling of
leaving one of their concerts speechless and
mesmerized — refresh their memories of the
ensemble's splendid lyricism and immaculate
mastery of style and technique.
"Audiences are growing, for brass in gener
al, but also for our group," Smedvig says. "1
think they're surprised at what brass can do.
Certain people come to our concerts all the

time. You could call them fans, I guess."
A modest way of putting it.
Passage
Inside the jacket of one of the quintet's lat
est CDs — "Passage," which consists of music
from 138 B.C. to 1611 A.I). — Smedvig
writes, "Music is timeless. The old becomes
new, the new old. Melodies never end, they
only lead to the next passage."
The tribalesque rhythms of percussionist
Kurt Wortman (the drummer in Bruce
Springsteen's "Philadelphia" who is a guest
player on the CD and will be at this Saturday's
concert as well) adds to the intricately woven
fabric of the brass lines and gives the sound
an urgent and decisive feel of momentum.
Beneath the long, lyrical arches of melody
and harmony, the tympanic pulse chases the
music of these Gregorian chants and spiritu
al dances to surprising emotional heights.
Smedvig, who studied numerous scrolls of
these ancient musicians for years before ar
ranging the collection, thinks of it as "explor
ing a crystallization of human feeling, study
ing the spiritual things your mind is capable
of producing.
"It doesn't matter how fast or slow the
music is, it's always got a pulse," Smedvig says.
"As human beings, we basically live to a heart
heat. The heartbeat is something we really
don't get in touch with all that often. Musi
cians can harness the energy and the feelingof
a racing pulse. That's what we do when we
play: try to make listeners feel that pulse."
When they find the pulse and send it from
their instruments to ears in the audience, it
sounds like an invitation to join the rhythm.
Smedvig thinks of history itself as a pulse

that drives the way musicians have composed
and played over centuries.
"I'm fascinated with history," he says.
"History has taught us that we repeat our
selves over and over. We haven't changed a
whole lot in our basic nature, our basic char
acter, and music throughout the ages reflects
that."
Whatever they play, whether it's a suite
from Henry Purcell's "The Fairy Queen" or
Duke Ellington's "Jungle Nights in Harlem,"
their sound resonates with a regal hut very
human touch of nobility. It makes an audito
rium seat feel like a throne.
Talent and toil
"I like the way Baryshnikov put it," Smed
vigsays with a preparatory chuckle. "If I miss
one day, 1 know it. If I miss two days everyone
knows it."
That's humble and clever of him to say, but
the truth is that they simply never miss a note,
or if they do, they find better ones to play. Per
fection is not their aim. It's their standard.
They bring out nothing less than the best in
their instruments.
Their music melds with such gorgeous
precision that the group itself sounds like an
instrument. It's easy to get lost in the unit)- of
their sounds and forget that there are indeed
five individuals up on stage, and not one elab
orate instrument.
But like any instrument, the group is a
"coming together of parts" whose virtues
form the outstanding whole. Empire Brass is
a rare fusion of the best players each instru
ment has to offer. Smedvig has been making
solo appearances with major symphonies
since he was 13. When he was 19, he became

the youngest member of the Boston Sym
phony, and later received a Grammy norm
nation for a CD of virtuoso trumpet concer
ti he produced with the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra.
Mark Inouye, a trumpeter who plays jaz/
and classical music with equal brilliance,
graduated from Juilliard Music School (wide
ly considered the best music school in the
country), has played with the Israel and New
York Philharmonic Orchestras. Also, he has
appeared as a soloist with Wynton Marsalis
and on National Public Radio.
Luiz Garcia, a Brazilian French hornist,
has toured and recorded with South Ameri
ca's most prestigious brass ensemble
("Metal Brasil"), appears regularly with the
Boston Pops Orchestra and the Boston Phil
harmonic.
Darren Acosta, a trombonist who grew up
immersed in New Orleans' vibrant Dixieland
jazz scene, studied under Fllis Marsalis aiul
like the rest of his buddies, has performed
with many of the country's major orchestras.
Finally, Kenneth Amis, who plays the tuba
with enough graceful Finesse to deflate all the
unfortunate oom-pah myths that tarnish the
tuba's image, has been arranging music for
Empire Brass even longer than he's been a
playing member.
Bringing out the best
One of the selections the ensemble will
play this Saturday is the fourth movement of
a brass quintet Amis composed when he was
a sophomore in college.
When asked which numbers on the pro
gram he thought the audience would like
most, he says with a charming combination of
pride and modesty, "I'd like to think mine's
going to be a hit." Then he laughs, and says in
a more serious tone, "It's neo-romantic, pretty
conservative, as one might expect of a young
composer. It shares a lot of the same lyricism of
the music of the late- 19th century.
"Just as in Romantic music of that era, its
a piece of extremes, which is something brass
instruments can do really well. They can por
tray anger and sorrow and happiness to an ex
tent that the novice music listener can under
stand and appreciate.... What I try to do as a
composer, is to bring out the stronger quali
ties inherent in the instruments."
The Rondo, as he describes it, is a dynamic
exchange of questions and answers between
the radiant trumpets and the more mysteri
ous darkness of the lower brass. Between the
two, the versatile French horn swings in and
out of edgy anger and muted serenity.
The piece sounds like everything Empire
Brass is all about: bringing out the Finest qual
ities of each instrument and musician to as
semble the parts into a magnificent musical
whole.
