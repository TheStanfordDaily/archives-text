# decisive moments at the Gallery
## 
### Wendy See Angie Mei 
n a world of disposable
cameras and Kodak mo
ments, Stanford Art
Gallery's latest exhibit
serves as a sharp re
minder of an often over
looked artistry.
"The Enduring Il-

lusion" displays 1 00 works by famous photog
raphers and lesser-known artists. Selected
from the still-defunct Art Museum, these pic
tures offer a glimpse into Stanford's total col
lection of 3,000 photographs.
Inundated by TV and movies, the modern

eye has adapted to see the world as a perpetual
sequence of activities. Within the pristine
white walls of the Gallery, the eye is freed from
the technicolor attacks of today's multimedia.
A photo exhibit is a veritable health spa for the
eye — a chance to soak in a still-moment, to
ease up, to stop.

Many early photographs appear static —
straight shots of landscapes and personal por
traits. Yet, as the resolution becomes finer and
the pictures more complex, the subjects seem
to regain the life that they once had.
One aspect of this new "life" in the picture is
the ability to arrest the moment while encap
sulating its dynamism. Several of the pho
tographs reveal an interesting irony — the abil
ity to freeze time yet convey movement simul
taneously. In Edward Curtis' photograph of
three tribesmen walking in sync, there is a pal
pable momentum to their steps. In "Hawksbill
Creek Swimming Hole," a steam engine pass
ing over a creek filled with water-playing chil
dren also frames this notion of movement cap
tured, yet not stopped. The perfectly-captured
dainty grin and playful glare of one child seem
to continue the presence of that moment.
In addition to physical energy, several pho
tographs emit a similarly strong sense of emo
tional vigor. In one such example, the 4 feet of
empty floor space separating an old aristocrat
ic couple in their anniversary picture is paral
leled by an emotional distance between the
craggy husband and his resigned wife.
Mwn.il lit,.) Hwul'.l.)
"The camera never lies" is an oft-repeated
phrase in photography that sets up an in-

evitable paradox. While a photographers vi
sion is in some way determined by the sheer
technicalities of producing the image, there is
always room for creativity. One featured ex
ample of a visual illusion in the exhibit is A. J.
Russell's famous 1869 "Hanging Rock," in
which manipulation of space causes a huge
rock to loom directly above a man's head.
The ability of the camera to distance and
bring subjects closer to us provides a different

perspective of our universe. The gleaming skin
of an apple, for example, can become the ce
lestial night sky, as in Paul Caponigro's "Apple,
New York City." Alfred Steiglit/'s "A Dirigible"
takes on the appearance of a UFO when pass
ing over a cloud bank and Imogene Cunning
ham's close-up on the pollen-laden center of a
white flower becomes a "Tower of Jewels."
These objects become surreal when they're
positioned in a way that transcends the limits
of the natural eye, but not the mind.
Ordinary objects can defy- identification al
together when placed in conjunction with
one another. Others you'd rather not identify:

Joel-Peter Witkin's "Poet: From a Collection
of Relics and Ornaments" is a grisly amalgam
of ossified and decaying body parts. Modern
photography also plays upon the idea of
everyday objects infused with new meaning,
using digitized images and combining tech
niques to create photograms that resemble
abstract art.
Simplicity can still make the most powerful
impression, though; "Windowsill Daydream"
by Minor White, with its interplay of light and
symbolic imagery of the open window, turns
prose into vivid poetry.
If the camera does lie, it is up to your mind
to make fact out of fiction.
The exhibit moves from carefully com
posed portraits by Julia Margaret Cameron
and Nadar to naturalistic scenes of people
caught in what Henri Cartier-Bresson called
"the decisive moment." These frozen mo
ments in time often bring out the humor of
everyday existence — like a one-legged man
on a bicycle in "Coney Island" by Danuta Otfi
nowski.
Several photos also give us fascinating vari
ations on the human condition. Diane Arbus'
"Tattooed Man" confronts us with a stoic ex
pression that belies his freakish appearance.
The personal details of Berenice Abbott's pho
tograph of Eugene Atget — his humped pos
ture and time-worn facial expression — offers
a pathos-laden portrait of the aged. Ironically,
"Young Millworker" presents a small boy;
however, this Dickensian picture of under
nourished youth evokes a sympathy similar to
that of Berenice Abbott's photo.

"The Enduring Illusion" cites an origin of
photography as stemming (no pun intended)
from the simple "photogenic drawing" of a
leaf by William Talbot, done over 150 years
ago. More like an inverted brush painting than
one of the first forms of photography, one
could easily mistake this pioneering feat for a
simple brown watercolor.
The exhibit is also a tribute to the artistic

mediums that came before and after the ad
vent of photography. Brassai's portrait of Ma
tisse sketching a nude model is made singular
by the fact that your eye is drawn first to the
model, not to the famous, Freudian-looking
artist beside her. There are also examples of
Fadweard Muybridge's famous stop-photo ac
tion sequences commissioned by Leland Stan
ford back in 1872, which aided the develop
ment of the motion picture. In addition to a
haunting moonlit landscape by Ansel Adams,
there is the wry memorial "Ansel's Ghost
Flaunts Photographers ofYosemite."
History is also conveyed in another sense.

The first photographs of far-away places like
Greece and Italy resemble those out of a guide
hook. Two images dating from the mid 19th
century, a Mormon family and a Lapp family
complete with reindeer, look out at us from
sepia-toned houses. Later, there are illustrations
from Walker Evans' images of the Depression,
and Robert Frank's slices of 1950s Americana.
As the exhibit approaches the latter half of
our century, several photos assume a political
bent recognizable to all. A photo of four Khmer
Rouge soldiers poised around their artillery
canon. A Czech father and his three daughters
entranced by the perfection of a starlet on TV.
A simple scene of a curb-seated man sipping a.s
another gazes on distantly in Cart ier-Bresson's
"The Last Days of the Kuomintang, Peking." A
Russian tax collector approaching a small ped
dler on the streets in the midst of heavy snow.
In these politically-laden images, photography
transcends the mere capturing of existence and
imparts to the ob-

server all the politi
cal complexities in
volved with the sub
jects themselves.
This is among one
of the most power
ful abilities of pho
tography — to not
only visually record
political history but
translate its every
day reality to the
rest of the world.
"The inherent
paradox of the pho
tographic image,"
writes curator Joel

Leivick, "will con
tinue to inspire the
creation of images
that help us give
form to the chaos
and complexity of
our lives." If you
take a cross-section
of the Stanford Art
Gallery, you would

find below it Stanford's photo lab, where stu
dents in the claustrophobic, chemical-reeking
dark room endeavor to make the perfect print.
A word of inspiration to them and to anyone
else seeking a distant perfection. That a cap
tured moment continues as long as you per
petuate the illusion.

n a world of disposable
cameras and Kodak mo
ments, Stanford Art
Gallery's latest exhibit
serves as a sharp re
minder of an often over
looked artistry.
"The Enduring Il-

lusion" displays 1 00 works by famous photog
raphers and lesser-known artists. Selected
from the still-defunct Art Museum, these pic
tures offer a glimpse into Stanford's total col
lection of 3,000 photographs.
Inundated by TV and movies, the modern

eye has adapted to see the world as a perpetual
sequence of activities. Within the pristine
white walls of the Gallery, the eye is freed from
the technicolor attacks of today's multimedia.
A photo exhibit is a veritable health spa for the
eye — a chance to soak in a still-moment, to
ease up, to stop.

Many early photographs appear static —
straight shots of landscapes and personal por
traits. Yet, as the resolution becomes finer and
the pictures more complex, the subjects seem
to regain the life that they once had.
One aspect of this new "life" in the picture is
the ability to arrest the moment while encap
sulating its dynamism. Several of the pho
tographs reveal an interesting irony — the abil
ity to freeze time yet convey movement simul
taneously. In Edward Curtis' photograph of
three tribesmen walking in sync, there is a pal
pable momentum to their steps. In "Hawksbill
Creek Swimming Hole," a steam engine pass
ing over a creek filled with water-playing chil
dren also frames this notion of movement cap
tured, yet not stopped. The perfectly-captured
dainty grin and playful glare of one child seem
to continue the presence of that moment.
In addition to physical energy, several pho
tographs emit a similarly strong sense of emo
tional vigor. In one such example, the 4 feet of
empty floor space separating an old aristocrat
ic couple in their anniversary picture is paral
leled by an emotional distance between the
craggy husband and his resigned wife.

"The camera never lies" is an oft-repeated
phrase in photography that sets up an in-

evitable paradox. While a photographers vi
sion is in some way determined by the sheer
technicalities of producing the image, there is
always room for creativity. One featured ex
ample of a visual illusion in the exhibit is A. J.
Russell's famous 1869 "Hanging Rock," in
which manipulation of space causes a huge
rock to loom directly above a man's head.
The ability of the camera to distance and
bring subjects closer to us provides a different

perspective of our universe. The gleaming skin
of an apple, for example, can become the ce
lestial night sky, as in Paul Caponigro's "Apple,
New York City." Alfred Steiglit/'s "A Dirigible"
takes on the appearance of a UFO when pass
ing over a cloud bank and Imogene Cunning
ham's close-up on the pollen-laden center of a
white flower becomes a "Tower of Jewels."
These objects become surreal when they're
positioned in a way that transcends the limits
of the natural eye, but not the mind.
Ordinary objects can defy- identification al
together when placed in conjunction with
one another. Others you'd rather not identify:

Joel-Peter Witkin's "Poet: From a Collection
of Relics and Ornaments" is a grisly amalgam
of ossified and decaying body parts. Modern
photography also plays upon the idea of
everyday objects infused with new meaning,
using digitized images and combining tech
niques to create photograms that resemble
abstract art.
Simplicity can still make the most powerful
impression, though; "Windowsill Daydream"
by Minor White, with its interplay of light and
symbolic imagery of the open window, turns
prose into vivid poetry.
If the camera does lie, it is up to your mind
to make fact out of fiction.
The exhibit moves from carefully com
posed portraits by Julia Margaret Cameron
and Nadar to naturalistic scenes of people
caught in what Henri Cartier-Bresson called
"the decisive moment." These frozen mo
ments in time often bring out the humor of
everyday existence — like a one-legged man
on a bicycle in "Coney Island" by Danuta Otfi
nowski.
Several photos also give us fascinating vari
ations on the human condition. Diane Arbus'
"Tattooed Man" confronts us with a stoic ex
pression that belies his freakish appearance.
The personal details of Berenice Abbott's pho
tograph of Eugene Atget — his humped pos
ture and time-worn facial expression — offers
a pathos-laden portrait of the aged. Ironically,
"Young Millworker" presents a small boy;
however, this Dickensian picture of under
nourished youth evokes a sympathy similar to
that of Berenice Abbott's photo.

"The Enduring Illusion" cites an origin of
photography as stemming (no pun intended)
from the simple "photogenic drawing" of a
leaf by William Talbot, done over 150 years
ago. More like an inverted brush painting than
one of the first forms of photography, one
could easily mistake this pioneering feat for a
simple brown watercolor.
The exhibit is also a tribute to the artistic

mediums that came before and after the ad
vent of photography. Brassai's portrait of Ma
tisse sketching a nude model is made singular
by the fact that your eye is drawn first to the
model, not to the famous, Freudian-looking
artist beside her. There are also examples of
Fadweard Muybridge's famous stop-photo ac
tion sequences commissioned by Leland Stan
ford back in 1872, which aided the develop
ment of the motion picture. In addition to a
haunting moonlit landscape by Ansel Adams,
there is the wry memorial "Ansel's Ghost
Flaunts Photographers ofYosemite."
History is also conveyed in another sense.

The first photographs of far-away places like
Greece and Italy resemble those out of a guide
hook. Two images dating from the mid 19th
century, a Mormon family and a Lapp family
complete with reindeer, look out at us from
sepia-toned houses. Later, there are illustrations
from Walker Evans' images of the Depression,
and Robert Frank's slices of 1950s Americana.
As the exhibit approaches the latter half of
our century, several photos assume a political
bent recognizable to all. A photo of four Khmer
Rouge soldiers poised around their artillery
canon. A Czech father and his three daughters
entranced by the perfection of a starlet on TV.
A simple scene of a curb-seated man sipping a.s
another gazes on distantly in Cart ier-Bresson's
"The Last Days of the Kuomintang, Peking." A
Russian tax collector approaching a small ped
dler on the streets in the midst of heavy snow.
In these politically-laden images, photography
transcends the mere capturing of existence and
imparts to the ob-

server all the politi
cal complexities in
volved with the sub
jects themselves.
This is among one
of the most power
ful abilities of pho
tography — to not
only visually record
political history but
translate its every
day reality to the
rest of the world.
