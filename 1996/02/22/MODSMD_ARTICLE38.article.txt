## Renaissance Fare at John Bentley's 
### Brady Mickelsen 
Tucked away in
the quaint little vil
lage of Woodside
— home of rock
stars, drug dealers
and actual hitching
posts — is John
Bentley's Restau
rant, whose unas
suming name, in
conjunction with
the humble trap
pings of the estab-

lishment, belies the sophistication of both
the clientele and quality of the fare offered by
Chef John. Only a few months old, John
Bentley's is fast building a reputation among
the locals as a wonderfully creative, yet appe
tizing (and trust me, the two are not always
the same), addition to the Peninsula. Though
a bit out of the way for most Stanford stu
dents, this is a magnificent, though pricey,
place for the folks to take you to dinner when
they are in town (book now for graduation
dinners!!!), for other celebratory occasions
or when you simply want to blow some cash
on really good food!
The menu at J.B.'s varies constantly —
while the most popular dishes are held over

from week to week, they are joined by new
creations and seasonal specials. Unlike most
"innovative cuisine," John Bentley's offers
unique foods that are as palatable as they are
novel. Too frequently, I have bought into the
"Well, that sounds interesting..ploy, only
to end up wishing that I had spent my $20 on
a pastrami sandwich (and your choice of
condiments) at the Oasis. Well-informed
servers are extremely helpful in recommend
ing old favorites and identifying new treats,
while protecting one from over-experiment
ing, so don't be afraid of ordering what you
thought was going to be fish and ending up
with a plateful of haggis.
Our meal at Bentley's exemplifies both the
creativity and quality of the menu. We began
with the sun-dried tomato soup ($3.50),
though we were nervous that we were order
ing something that would resemble the wa
tery red stuff your mother made you eat with
grilled-cheese sandwiches. Such reservations
were completely in vain: the creamy soup was
divine in both taste and texture. After one
bite, my companion refused to share this am
brosia, leaving me to munch on the compli
mentary bread and eggplant/garlic paste
(funky, but surprisingly good). We followed
the soup with two appetizers: Gorgonzola-
Pinenut Wontons in a smoked tomato sauce
($6.95) and Garlic Custard with shiitake
mushrooms in a port wine sauce ($8.95). The

wontons were an easy choice — some power
ful gorgonzola: perfect if you are fond of blue
cheese or Roquefort — but we had to be con
vinced by our waitress that we should try the
counter-intuitive garlic custard. The won
tons were good, but the custard was magnif
icent and is a must. Looking exactly like the
desert, the garlic custard was essentially a
spread for the accompanying bits of toasted
bread. Applied generously with the mush
rooms and sauce, the appetizer was a perfect
microcosm of what makes John Bentley's
such a fabulous restaurant — creativity with
great taste and satisfactory portions.
Although entries at fine restaurants are
usually 90% presentation and 10% French
pronunciation — big plate, little tiny piece
of fish right in the middle, some weird name
— and have little taste, John Bentley's was
again a pleasant surprise. I ordered one of
the specials of the day: Curry-crusted
Swordfish on Black Bean and Corn Salad
with fresh fruit salsa ($18.00). Not a huge
fish fan, the swordfish was incredibly tasty
and the fresh fruit salsa was very unique:
cantaloupe, honey-dew and cilantro. The
entree was hearty, though not heavy, and the
combination of curry and fruit gave a re
freshing twist to an otherwise plain dish. My
companion ordered the Penne Pasta with
Sea Scallops in a tomato basil sauce ($14.50).
Scallops, to me, are nothing more than na

ture's version of the super bouncy balls you
get out of little machines near the exits at
Safeway, but she said that they were very
good. The pasta and basil sauce was very
good: neither too subtle or too aggressive.
Dessert was the only disappointing fea
ture of John Bentley's. We shared the Milk
Chocolate Cremc Brulee ($5.95) and con
cluded that, while it was good, it was not as
relatively spectacular as the appetizers or
entries. We would have preferred to have
given our meals time to settle while we
drove to Palo Alto or Menlo Park and got ice
cream.
Categorically, however, John Bentley's is a
place you cannot miss if you enjoy the in
trigue of new dishes. It has magnificent vari
ety and superb quality — definitely try the
soup and Garlic Custard. Be prepared to
spend some cash—but unlike so many other
restaurants, the food is definitely worth the
price, in both quantity and taste.
