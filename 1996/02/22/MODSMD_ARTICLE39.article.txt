# Molto "Rigoletto"
## 
### Jew Graves 
he orchestra begins
quietly, with the
anxiety of pending
tragedy against a back
drop of creamy Italian
columns. l ight falls in a
an almost-red tinge.

Men and women move on stage stealthily, like
quick cats, and pose. Dressed in the regalia of
the Renaissance court, they don satin, velvet
and sequins in black, red and gold: colors of
power and lust. Something is in the air, and it
is ... opera.
Playing through Feb. 25, the decadence of
Verdi's "Rigoletto" is here in Palo Alto at the
Lucie Stern Community Theatre. Aside from
the tact that I give it a great review, perhaps a
more qualified recommendation comes from
another, Verdi himself, who hailed "Rigolet
to" as his favorite work. He wrote "Rigoletto"
in 1851 at 37 years of age, and it marked a
change from the earlier heroism of his patri
otic music. When Verdi wrote this opera, he
said he was interested in giving his music
"character," a famous example of which is in
the last act, when each of four voices singing
together embodies a different feeling.
Without revealing too much, "Rigoletto" is
a story of murder, deception and passion. The
famous "La Donna e mobile" is sung by the
corrupt Duke who proves, in fact, to be the
one left standing at the end. Rigoletto is the
deformed court jester whose daughter falls in
love with the wrong man, namely the Duke,
and the story unravels from there.
The presentation of the opera as well as the
story itself have something for everyone, from
veteran opera-goers to opera virgins. Found
ed by Henry and Maria Holt when they ar
rived in Palo Alto from Vienna in 1955, the
West Bay Opera Company has been offering
audiences quality opera for over 40 years. As

the General Director, Maria Holt says, "We're
not Germany, so wo don't have hundreds and
hundreds of opera companies. At first, we
were 100 percent rejected. But the opera has
really grown in this country. There are 16 to
20opera companies between here and Sacra
mento, and the community has grown into
one of integrity."
Marcella Fasso, a doctoral student in im
munology at Stanford, says,"In Switzerland,
where I am from, it is difficult to find a non
professional company that has such quali
ty. . .West Bay Opera's productions are up to
very high standards, even from a professional
point of view."
Fasso is one of four Stanford affiliates in
"Rigoletto," and she sings the part of the Page,
one of the few female roles in an opera that
only has a male chorus. She has studied music
since she was a child and says opera here is the
counterpart to her studies: "... it is so differ
ent from work in the lab. The audiences seem
to be so old, and I wish more young people
would go! If you look at the story of'Rigolet
to,' it is not so different from popular films. It
is very young! I only wish the people in my lab
and people my age would go to see it." Fasso's
twin sister is, in fact, studying to be a profes
sional opera singer in Switzerland.
Also singing in "Rigoletto" is Francois
Doremieux, who doesn't hesitate to mention
the way his name spells the first three notes in
the musical scale — Do, Re, Mi. He is in the
MBA program at Stanford, which, he says,
"doesn't keep us as busy as everyone says!" A
member of the chorus and a native of France,
he respects Verdi's intent in creating charac
terizations in the music: "The chorus is really
a character, doing things in the plot that are
very specific — sometimes they are nasty,
sometimes sad."
The 12-person chorus also includes Rick
Bogart, a research scientist in solar physics at
Stanford. Bogart is part of a team that just

launched a solar space probe in November
and is eagerly anticipating the development of
pictures of the sun. This is his l()th show with
the West Bay Opera company. He says the
production "is one of the most beautiful op
eras and one of the nicest looking produc
tions that I've been in. We have an extraordi
narily good costume and set designer."
Richard W. Battle is the costume designer
for the lush clothing of this show. "This is a
time when people were very loose in their liv
ing," he says."The set is muted, and we had to
give it a splash of color. There is a lot of sculpt
ing with the light, and the idea is for seeing
through things ... everything is sheer with
gold."
A professor in the department of drama at
Mills College, he specializes in costumes and
makeup. All the costumes for "Rigoletto"
were made at Mills College in his classes. Bat
tle is the winner of numerous Bay Area Critics
Awards for shows done with the Lamp
lighters. He was nominated for Emmys in
makeup design for various San Francisco bal
lets. However, he says, he has adored the opera
since he was a child, when his mother made
him and his brother listen to the opera every
Saturday: "After a while you forget some
things, but forme, the music of the opera is al
ways there."
The music of this opera is exceptionally ex
ecuted in this performance. The cast is dou
ble, which requires double the time, as stage
director I.in White points out. The major
roles of Rigoletto, the Duke and Gilda are
played respectively by William Berges I
Michael Rogers, Richard Nichol / Frederick
Winthrop and Wendy Loder / Dvora Djo
raev. All of them sing professionally with
opera companies from the San Francisco
Opera company to those in Italy, Germany
and Vienna.
Aside from these roles, however, the vol
ume of the chorus is beautiful and intense.
They create an immense sound that sends
chills down the spine. "It's a volunteer chorus!
They've really done wonderfully," says White.
Jutta Mohr, who has been with West Bay

Opera for 1 0 years, is now the Chorus Manag
er. Before assuming this position, she sang in
the chorus. "Rigoletto" is one of the first op
eras she ever heard as an adolescent and she
calls it "one of the best productions that West
Bay has done." At Stanford, Mohr is the Pro
gram Administrator for the Center for Latin
American Studies. While she spends her life
combining her work with her passion for
opera, she comments, "Opera is so offset from
reality that when you begin to look closer, you
come up with interesting interpretations."
Something which distinguishes West Bay
Opera from other companies is the lack of
supertitles. So while there are words on
screens to both sides of the stage, they serve
not as a script, but as a basic summary of the
action. This tactic frees the viewer from the
visual distraction of reading groups of words
while trying to watch the opera. Matthew
Gilmartin writes, . . the company has de
veloped a unique solution to foreign lan
guage productions: the use of projected text.
Similar to text in silent films, projected text
offers judiciously selected synopses and
translations of key dialogue which arc less
intrusive for their occasional occurrence and
brevity."
While the weekend of a Stanford student
probably doesn't involve plans to go to the
opera, I highly recommend this production.
A glittering festival of high tragedy, the opera
is a different art form than what we are used
to, a completely unique experience. It is a syn
thesis of music, stage and acting; a dramatic
tour de force. The musical Italian language
melts away the barrier of its foreignness, al
lowing the opera to sing without words.
