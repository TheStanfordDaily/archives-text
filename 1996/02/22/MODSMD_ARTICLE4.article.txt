# Peace Corps hits 35 and returns to roots
## Director Hogan says integration is key 
### Amy Slucter Staff writer 
Having officially reached mid
dle age, the Peace Corps is not suf
fering a mid-life crisis but is con
tinuing to grow and adapt, said
the Corps Assoc. Director John
Hogan in an afternoon speech yes
terday at Bechtel International
Center.
In a speech sponsored by the
Center for African Studies titled
"Changing Roles for Changing
Times," Hogan addressed the new
approach that the Peace Corps —
which celebrates its 35th birthday
March 1 — has taken toward com
munity development throughout
the world.
"The Peace Corps is a remark
able organization," Hogan said.
"But it is remarkable in a modest
way. The Peace Corps is remark
able in its simplicity."
According to Hogan, the Peace
Corps has developed its positive
reputation because it is committed
to understanding the needs of the
people it serves. While many devel
opment organizations are criti
cized for being unable to work ef
fectively with the people they set
out to help, Hogan said the Peace
Corps sees development in a differ
ent light.
"Development is the process by
which people create options for
themselves to better their own
lives," Hogan said. "The Peace

Corps does not bring development.
The Peace Corps only contributes
to development."

does not bring devel
opment. The Peace
Corps only con

ment.'

The contribution of the Corps,
said Hogan, has been changing
over time. When it was created by
the Kennedy administration in the
19605, the Peace Corps focused on
education, and specifically on
teaching English. In the 1970s the
Corps became more interested in
technological developments such
as irrigation systems and nutrition
programs, and in the 1980s the
Corps adopted a new approach to
service that emphasized the role of
group volunteer units.
According to Hogan, the 1990s
have seen the Corps come full cir
cle. But while the Peace Corps has
again put an emphasis on educa
tion, Hogan said volunteers are
not working in place of local teach-
ers but in addition to local teach
ers, as teacher aides or teacher
trainers.
This change is a part of a larger
trend that has seen the Peace
Corps become less involved with
government organizations and
more involved with non-govern
mental organizations and with the
local community, Hogan said.
"Local participation is the
key," Hogan emphasized. "We
aren't coming in to tell people
what to do but to get inside a com
munity."
The integration of volunteers
into local communities has trans
formed many returned Peace
Corps members into what Hogan
calls "citizens of the world."
"When volunteers return from
Asia, they are contemplating their
navels," Hogan said. "When they
return from Latin America, they
are revolutionaries. And when
they return from Africa, they are
laughing."
The need for active involvement
is particularly important in a
world that Hogan believes is torn
between globalization and frag
mentation. According to Hogan, it
is the responsibility of individuals
to get involved with service
throughout the world.
Such intense local involvement,
said Hogan, is what has been re

sponsible for the Peace Corps' con
tinued success. In celebration of
the Corps' anniversary, events in
the Bay Area throughout the year
will center on the need to "recom
mit to service" through Habitat for
Humanity projects and work with
local homeless organizations.

Hogan joked that in Washington
festivities will include red, white
and blue ice cream.
He also mentioned plans to de
velop a Crisis Corps made up of
former Peace Corps members who
could be contacted to volunteer in
emergency situations.
