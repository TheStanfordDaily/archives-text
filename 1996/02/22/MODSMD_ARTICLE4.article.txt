Having officially reached mid
dle age, the Peace Corps is not suf
fering a mid-life crisis but is con
tinuing to grow and adapt, said
the Corps Assoc. Director John
Hogan in an afternoon speech yes
terday at Bechtel International
Center.
In a speech sponsored by the
Center for African Studies titled
"Changing Roles for Changing
Times," Hogan addressed the new
approach that the Peace Corps —
which celebrates its 35th birthday
March 1 — has taken toward com
munity development throughout
the world.
"The Peace Corps is a remark
able organization," Hogan said.
"But it is remarkable in a modest
way. The Peace Corps is remark
able in its simplicity."
According to Hogan, the Peace
Corps has developed its positive
reputation because it is committed
to understanding the needs of the
people it serves. While many devel
opment organizations are criti
cized for being unable to work ef
fectively with the people they set
out to help, Hogan said the Peace
Corps sees development in a differ
ent light.
"Development is the process by
which people create options for
themselves to better their own
lives," Hogan said. "The Peace

Corps does not bring development.
The Peace Corps only contributes
to development."

'The Peace Corps
does not bring devel
opment. The Peace
Corps only con
tributes to develop
ment.'
— John Hogan

The contribution of the Corps,
said Hogan, has been changing
over time. When it was created by
the Kennedy administration in the
19605, the Peace Corps focused on
education, and specifically on
teaching English. In the 1970s the
Corps became more interested in
technological developments such
as irrigation systems and nutrition
programs, and in the 1980s the
Corps adopted a new approach to
service that emphasized the role of
group volunteer units.
According to Hogan, the 1990s
have seen the Corps come full cir
cle. But while the Peace Corps has
again put an emphasis on educa
tion, Hogan said volunteers are
not working in place of local teach-
