# Get thee gone: A looer's quarrel with the Geraldine Fibbers
## 
### 
y wr t the end of "Lilyhelle," the rousing
J ll opener on the Geraldine Fibbers'
x ML first album, "Lost Somewhere Be
tween the Earth and My Home," lead singer
Carla Bozulich's voice drops into a mournful
sigh.
She sings: "There are song birds and sweet
things where angels bare wings and bask in
the afterglow of good deeds done by tender
souls, but I, in my wretched state, fat from
years of sucking hate, can never scrape
the dirt off, can never shake the other JR
side. It hides in holes behind my eyes." • '£

Strings slide around in the back
ground, deteriorating into a sugary
flourish at the end. Bozulich sings the
last lines as if unaware of their ugly con
notations. She sounds exhausted, a little
defeated as the strings, melancholy and
whimsical at once, overpower her voice.
It is a moment of clashing ideas, a
creepy combination of bitter disillu
sionment and melodramatic mockery.
"I thrive on a conflict," Bozulich says
of this effect which recurs throughout
her music. "Or on contrary elements
knocking up against each other. That's
just my style."
It is a tribute to her, and to the band
as a whole, that they can justify so much
disharmony. By combining elements of
country, folk and indie-rock, their
album boasts more than one of these
unlikely triumphs, moments that,
against all odds, make your skin crawl,
that send a flush to the top of your head.
The Cieraldine Fibbers conceive impos
sible combinations of sound and senti
ment and pull them off fluently. With a
sense of conflict borrowed from both
highbrow aesthetic quarrels and low
minded barroom brawls, they manage
to single-handedly revitalize discord, to
make dissension attractive. 1 guarantee
you've never heard anything like it, and

when it comes to alternative, that's the high
est possible compliment.
Pour friends — Bozulich, guitarist
Daniel Keenan, drummer Kevin
Fitzgerald and bassist William Tut
ton — acquainted from restaurant jobs and
stints in local bands, got together in 1993 to

play country covers. Bozulich wanted a spe
cific sound and explains the adjustments
they went through to move away from rock
and roll: "I really wanted an upright bass
player, and so we convinced Bill to play one.
He normally plays regular old rock bass.
Then, we were desperate for a violin player,
and so we called a bluegrass club in town and
they recommended Jessy." Jessy Greene came
aboard that year, adding the crucial string-

whine, the rootsy contribution that makes
the Fibbers sound so strange and wonderful.
"It was just a side project for fun,"
Bozulich explains. "That was the whole mo
tivation for forming the band — have some
tun and play some country music."
Their repertoire consisted mostly of cov
ers of hokey country songs — Tammy

Wynette, old Willie Nelson, the Carter Fami
ly and so on. Even then, though, the band
had unconventional instincts. "1 think we all
like unusual music," Bozulich says."In the
country genre, we weren't attracted to any
thing that wasn't at least a little bit off. For in
stance George Jones is one of my idols. His
stuff is straight-forward, but it's so heart
breaking that to me it's almost deviant. It's so
heart-wrenching, it's almost corny, and it is

corny, but it's just so strong it doesn't matter.
I love that."
She's already put her finger on one of her
band's most startling qualities. The Geral
dine Fibbers would sound pat and mawkish
it they weren't so deranged. They flirt with
maudlin sentiment only to fling it savagely
back.

That stirring, violent quality appeared in
the music almost immediately. "1 had about
three or four originals that I had been work
ing on prior to forming the band," says
Bozulich. " 'Marmalade,' 'Get Thee Gone,'
'Outside of Town' and a country song called
'They Suck.' " They were all edgier than the
country covers. 'Get Thee Gone' especially
with its huge dissonant section."
Bozulich, however, is reluctant to admit

that the resulting mix was idiosyncrat
ic. She hems and haws about what
seems to an outside listener a striking
inventiveness: "I don't like to do any
thing that doesn't come from a gen
uine place of inspiration so 1 kind of
would expect nothing less than origi
nality." She pauses, as if momentarily
regretful that her tone has communi
cated more pride than humility. But
she accepts it, becoming uncompro
mising, even in her apology: "I know
that sounds really pretentious, but I
can't help it. I can't retract it."
~"W] ive, Bozulich carols and
/shrieks into her microphone
.II with equal measures of delica
cy and abandon. She is all energy,
tightly wound, a captivating spectacle.
The band demurely retreats around
her, still producing the cacophonous
din, tuneful and hostile, which gives li
cense to Bozulich's performance. 1
went to my first Geraldine Fibbers
show cautioned by a review which
likened them, in part, to Guns l N
Roses. 1 never understood the connec
tion, the Fibbers are much too com
plex to invite the comparison, and so I
wondered what Bozulich had to say
about it.
I was surprised by her angry reac
tion. "I've talked about this a couple of
times," she says."The thine is, I really

respect that writer, otherwise I'd feel free to
bitch, but I hate Guns 'N Roses. I've always
hated them. 1 can't stand that guy's voice. I
hate their music. I'm offended by their whole
aesthetic. For me, it's the last thing I relate to
or would want to be compared to."

Their music invites ineloquence; that's the
problem. Any reviewer out to hit on an apt
comparison gets stymied by their capricious
tendency towards acid rock and hoe-down.
Unfortunately, this originality also scares
radio and MTV away. Despite a major label
endorsement, the Fibbers have had little
widespread recognition.
"Our record isn't selling a whole hell of a
lot," says Bozulich. "The way things were
looking for us when we signed our deal, we
had so much attention and such a big buzz
that 1 think people expected us to do very
well, at least sort of Elastica-size or some
thing. We haven't been able to make any
real impression on radio, and if you

don't have radio, MTV isn't inter
ested. So it's kind of a fish eat-

ing its tail." She doesn't
sound regretful, though,

and she quickly explains
her relief at the lack of

recognition. "I'm kind
of glad that it's gone

this way because I just
feel like the founda
tion is solid, and it's
based on real people
discovering the music
rather than hearing
one song on the radio,

which they haven't, or
seeing a video on MTV,

which they haven't. We're
just going to keep doing

what we do. We have enough
money to pay our rent, so we're

just going to keep touring. Play
ing live is what gets people interest
ed and to give a shit."

They've started working on new songs
and anticipate recording a new album in the
fall. Bozulich is, on the whole, upbeat. "1 like
everything. I love recording. I love writing. I
love touring. The live shows are a huge re
lease."

—wr s captivating as the Geraldine Fib-
J hers may be musically, it is
2. .ML Bozulich's lyrics which deliver the
most striking creative impact. The 12 tracks

on "Lost Somewhere Between the Earth and
My Home" are all well-crafted narratives.
They avoid the dark, confessional tone made
glibly superficial by modern rock radio, opt
ing instead for a burlesque folk-tale aesthet
ic.
"Dragon Lady," as unconventional a love
song as any you'll hear, ends on a particular
ly voluptuous note: "We'll take hostages,
make demands, set fire to all
our best laid —

: plans

We'll

assemble

volatile explosive devices

sell them for exorbitant prices. Purchase an
aircraft, learn to fly, run out of gas while we're
in the sky. Automatic pilot and x-ray spex,
we're kissing in the cockpit when the airplane
wrecked."
And from "House is Falling," a more lan
guid, torpid sentiment: "We lay around in the
smoky haze, drinking mint juleps and honey

glaze. You comb my hair into a French
chignon, cigarettes overflowing in the ash
tray, my love."
Bozulich has always been a storyteller,
writing since she was "about five." "I proba
bly intend to do it until the moment I die,"
she says."I have to; I'm compelled to write."
The whimsical, inventive tone to her lyrics
offsets a propensity for dark subjects. Several
of her songs seem to be about drug

addiction; "A Song

About

Walls,"

in par
ticular con
„ _i ... u „

cerns a girl who

"loved her junkie boyfriend,

tried to help his heart mend, asshole with an
appetite." Bozulich maintains that the songs
cannot be tied down to so specific a theme as
drugs. "They're just meant to be about that
feeling of wanting to check out," she says,
"which people do in so many different ways.
I for one do not use drugs to check out."
Bozulich seems unhappy with confession;

she wants her songs to be stories so they can
act as transport and exorcism at once. In her
words: "I just love the whole fairy-tale as
pect. I kind of consider myself like an Edgar
Allen Poe-meets-Dr. Seuss kind of person.
Using that genre interspersed with potent
subject matter lightens it and makes it more
the way I try to live life. Because life is hard
and it's fucked up if you sit there and dwell
on the seriousness of it instead of finding
humor or a lighter side. It's just about not
taking life so seriously that you get in the tub
and slash vour wrists." Bozulich, even in her

speech has an instinct towards tempering
one extreme with another: severity with

tongue-in-cheek humor, bitterness with

enthusiasm

The lazy bass in "Get
Thee Gone," the superb
closing track on the
Fibbers' record, ambles under

an ascending blaze of violin
and guitar. Bozulich's voice
is appropriately twangy,
both heartbroken and em
phatic. The song is about
lovers unable to part and is
at once maudlin and un
compromising, a hysterical
chant of remorse. The music,

in its uneasy combination of
elements, slide guitar meets

dissonant feedback, mirrors the
gist of the lyrics.

Bozulich sings, "I run like
blood through open doors, 1 go

where hope bends me. You're in my
guts, but evermore our hearts will not

agree. Go away my precious doll, get thee
gone from here. When I close my eyes to
sleep, please do not appear."
There's a touch of hopelessness to her

voice. She seems aware that difference is as
necessary as it is painful. The legacies of
Willie Nelson and Sonic Youth should never
have met, but having done so, they can per
haps never part. In the Geraldine Fibbers
opposites not only attract, they root, un
budging, in each other. The effect is sub
lime; to listen is to witness trench warfare,
the clash of antagonists, a glorious night of
sparks.
