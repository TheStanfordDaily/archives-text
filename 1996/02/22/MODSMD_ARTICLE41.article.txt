## TORI AMOS Boys for Pele 
### 
Part of the reason I like Tori Amos is sim
ilar to the reason I like the Dallas Cowboys —
both are hated by a lot of people. One writer
called her "Boring Amos;" another said of
the numerous Tori websites (361 and count
ing), "It's amazing how many people think
Tori Amos is actually worth talking about."
Amos is that person who makes the em
barrassing personal comment when the
room goes silent, the neurotic but oddly
charming girlfriend you can never quite ex
plain to your friends. She is too honest. In her
music, she missteps often, and many people
seem to love that about her.
She burst upon the mainstream alterna
tive scene with 1991's double-platinum "l it
tie Harthquakes,"an album that was shocking
in its intelligence and incisiveness in an age
where it is no longer shocking for women to
talk about sex. Yet in her work ever since
there has been a sense of unfulfilled promise
— she was already as big a star as she would
ever be — something interesting to slip in the
years between Sinead O'Connor and Alanis
Morissette.
This album has been touted as something
special because it is her first without produc
er (and ex-boyfriend) Kric Rosse. The irony
is that her obvious talent seems to benefit
from production. The beauty in her music
comes from the subtly interwoven melodies,
from poetry hidden in throw-away lines. In
this marathon of IS songs, these things are
too far between.
There are still points of brilliance.
"Caught A Lite Sneeze" is everything her
music should be. It combines incongruous
clanging percussion with a finely textured
melody — and also has a video which may
have some of the most compelling computer
animation ever seen on MTV. "Blood Roses"
utilizes an interesting harpsichord sound and
some intensely weird lyrics ("The chickens
get a taste of your meat, boy"). "Beauty
Queen / Horses" puts pretty hooks in the
quiet, piano-song genre. Some unexpectedly

funky blues-piano provides a needed change
of pace on "In the Springtime of His
Voodoo."
Yet the music still falls sometimes into un
necessary histrionics or sinks into formless
ness. This is still good music to play while
writing letters or having sex. It is just sad that
she could have given us more by giving us just
a little less.
