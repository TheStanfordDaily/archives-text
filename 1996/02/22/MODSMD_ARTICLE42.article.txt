# 1000 MONA LISAS
## New Disease 
### 
The thought of hearing another punk
rock group playing on mainstream radio
might make you puke. You probably think
that you've heard enough of that genre to last
you a lifetime.
If you're thinking that way, then 1000
Mona Lisas will be a pleasant surprise. The
Los Angeles-based trio isn't just a clone of all
the other groups out there, and their first full
length album, "New Disease," is not a bad
debut effort.
You might have heard 1000 Mona Lisas on
the radio with their cover of Alanis Moris
sette's "You Oughta Know." That song — the
hidden track on their five-song EP entitled
"The EP" — gives some insight into the
band's sound. But don't worry, the band isn't
just a group of Alanis Morissette wanna-bes.
With a sound similar to the Foo Fighters,
1000 Mona Lisas fit well into today's main
stream. However, the band lacks that sellout
sound that is frowned upon. The songs come
through with a very honest feeling, and you
get the impression that the band didn't write
these songs to join the bandwagon, but they
wrote them because they enjoyed it.
The highlight and first single off the
album is "How Would You Know." The cho
rus — "A perfect day for a funeral /It charms
me like the hole inside your head / You must
be happy but then / How would you know"
— is the catchiest part of the album, and after
hearing this song just once, you'll probably
be singing it all day long.
The first song, "Dog," has a riff which

sounds like a de
rivative of the
Beastie Boys'
"Sabotage." But
whether or not it
was done inten
tionally, it fits
well into the song
and is a good in
troduction to the
rest of the CD. It
has that upbeat
feeling that makes
you want to
dance around
and enjoy your
self.
The album is a
good departure
from most of the
formula-based
songs that are so
prevalent today.
But at the same
time, the music
isn't exactly
ground-break-

Tori Amos is dirty.
ing. At any rate, it's something that is easily
enjoyable.
Most likely you'll find their songs pretty
catchy, the kind of thing that might make a
great live show, and certainly makes a decent
first album.
