# TUPAC SHAKUR
## All Eyez on Me 
### 
Awash in gold chains and expensive
women, Tupac (2Pac) Shakur has never felt
so at home in the spotlight — controversial
as it is. With kingly authority, the young rap
star has released "All Eyez on Me," a double-
CD album that has confidently silenced the
critics.
With over two hours of music, "All Eye/,
on Me" is a first of its kind — both in length
and conviction. Flanked by an entourage of
celebrated hip-hop superstars, 2Pac has

Snoop Doggy Dogg.

diplomatic entente between West and East
Coast elements, Shakur welcomes New York
rhymers Method Man and Redman, creating
an explosive combination that delivers with
beautiful lyrical charisma. 2Pac proclaims,
"My lyrics motivate the planet / Similar to
Rhythm Nation, but thugged out, forgive me
Janet." Continuing the rap attack is the
smoky-speaker Method Man, "Johnny Blaze
out to get loot like Johnny Cash / Play a game
of Russian Roulette and have a blast".
In a rebuttal to other's commentaries on
his lifestyle, Tupac Shakur teams up with the
Bay Area favorite Rappin' 4-Tay to deliver
"Only God Can Judge Me," a track of mes-
