## HIT ME Greatest Hits Vol. 17 
### 
As far as obscure groups from indepen
dent labels go, this is about as good as it gets.
Continuing in the trend of one-person
"groups" started by Nine Inch Nails' Trent
Reznor, Hit Me is basically Derek Sivers of
New York, who performs everything but the
drums and female vocals.
Further, virtually the entire album was
produced, engineered, mixed and performed
in Sivers' bedroom. Apparently, punk's do-it
yourself aesthetic has spread to pop music,
which is essentially what 1 lit Me makes.
This fact, of course, raises the question of
whether something has to be popular to be
pop music. Hit Me isn't even available in
stores, only through their own number, 1-
800-HIT-ME-69.
As for the album itself, "Greatest I fits Vol.
17" is solid pop if nothing else. The music is
constructed around the vocals .is Sivers
works to manufacture some memorable lyri
cal and melodic hooks. Succeeding as often as
he fails, Sivers has created a true mix of crafty

songs and painful blunders.
On the weaker side, "Perfect Place To
Hide" and "Try It Try It" are burdened by an
noying choruses. By mixing various phone
messages together, "Answering Machine"
provides an interesting concept, which un
fortunately seems more bizarre than
provocative.
"Kiss Me Here" attempts to be sensual but
comes across, depending on the listener's
sensibilities, as either campy or simply stu
pid.
Another number, "Karaoke Promises,"
appears promising enough until one realizes
that Sivers stole the vocal melody note for
note from "Walking In Your Footsteps" by
The Police.
However, Sivers has also produced a num
ber of tracks which should earn him some se
rious attention from major labels. "Can't
Sing You This Song" and "Must love You By
Now" deftly avoid the cliches of most popu
lar love songs and pack some memorable
hooks.
"Tell Me Something New" adds some funk
to the prevalent pop tone of the album, mak
ing it a stand-out track if only for its instru
mental success.
Thus, Hit Me has made a stab at signifi
cance. It's a long shot, but one never knows.
Pop culture is a strange beast, and Hit Me's
new album shows some real promise.
