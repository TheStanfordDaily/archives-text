# THE

## The
						Philosopher Kings 
### 
The first thing you hear is the saxophone
droning a sad solo, and the first thing that
pops into your head is jazz.

But the Philoso
pher Kings, in
their self-titled
debut album, ex
hibit more than
traditional jaz/
music characteris
tics. Their music is
a blend of jazz,
hip-hop, rock and
soul. This is origi
nal and nice ...
until the next track
sounds almost ex
actly the same as
the one before it.
Already a hit in
their native Cana
da, the Philoso
pher Kings are
growing in popu
larity in the U.S.
and Europe. Peo
ple are catching on
to their unique
study of musical
combinations: a
mix of Seal and
Simply Red with a
little Tricky and
Massive Attack
thrown in for vari
ety. In case you're
curious, the
Philosopher Kings

are Gerald Eaton (lead vocals), lames McCol
lum (guitar), Brian West (guitar), Jon Levine
(piano and keyboards), Jason Levine (bass)
and Craig Hunter (drums, cymbals).
Though most of the album is excellent,
there were times when I couldn't tell one
track from the other. However, 1 must admit
that the music is very relaxing. In any case,
the lyrics are meaningful and the instrumen
tal blend is original. The first track "Turn My
Head Around," sets the mood for the rest of
the album with its heavy jazz influences. A
slight change in musical style from jazz to
lounge music comes in "Lay My Body
Down," with a special performance by virtu
oso jazz trumpeter Terence Blanchard. But
then again, lounge music is a direct deriva
tion from jazz; so oops, there is actually no
real change is musical form.
What saves the Philosopher Kings is that
their substantial lyrics paint poignant tales of
love and life that are expressed with Gerald
baton's beautiful, lulling voice. It is rare that
the words of an album become more signifi
cant than the music itself, but with the
Philosopher Kings, this is case. So, if any
thing, buy the album to read the booklet of
song lyrics. Otherwise, just wait for the tunes
to come on your favorite jazz station.
