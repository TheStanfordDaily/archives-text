# THE
						HALO BENDERS
## Don't Tell Me Now 
### 
The K Records catalog includes this de
scription of the 112 Jalo Benders: "There is Boise
and there is Olympia and there is what hap
pens when worlds collide." Most likely this
sentence will only mean something to you if
you are familiar with Calvin Johnson (of Beat
Happening) and Doug Martsch (of Built to
Spill), the two main figures in the Halo Ben
ders. If the description doesn't make sense to
you, I'm not sure I want to be held responsi
ble for any reaction you might have to this
album.
Lead singer Calvin Johnson is an enigma
that could only have emerged from the
Olympia, Wash., music scene. Beyond his
former band, the primitive-pop Beat Hap
pening, and his current ensemble, the base
ment-funk Dub Narcotic, Johnson has influ
enced countless other bands. Like Andy
Warhol, Johnson has been a unique person
ality standing as a locus for a community of
artists, many of whom come to record at
Johnson's Dub Narcotic studios (bands in
cluding Beck, the Softies and Pansy Divi
sion).
Johnson leaves an indelible mark on the
Halo Benders' sound with his deeper-than
is-healthy voice (his voice is not low like
Barry White's voice, it's more like the croak
you get when you wake up in the early morn
ing to answer the telephone). Paired with his
stream-of-consciousness lyrics ("Booster
shot / Bunny slope / Rumble strip / Slow
poke"), this voice makes Johnson's singing,
well, unique. It's not for everyone, for sure,
but it grows on you.
In contrast, Doug Martsch sings with an
almost angelic timbre that is the perfect
counterpoint to Johnson's voice. Martsch
brings with him a touch of the personal
music he makes with Built to Spill, and the
lines he sings add poignancy that tempers the
more trying elements of Johnson's singing.

The songs where he and Johnson both sing
(different lyrics at the same time!) are some
of the album's brightest moments (as on the
exquisite "Mercury Poisoning").
With Steve Fisk on electric organ, Ralph
Youtz on drums and Wayne Flower on bass,
Martsch and Johnson make some grooving,
strange pop music on "Don't Tell Me Now."
Highlights include "Bombshelter Pt. 1," in
which Johnson makes fun of Cold War para
noia to a tune which defies you to try and sit
still: "You'd rather live in a hole in the ground
/ Than pull your mind out of one right now."
Without a doubt, this album is essential
listening for the indie-pop underground.
