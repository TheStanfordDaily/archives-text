## Heavenly Voices III 
### 
The female voice is a truly beautiful cre
ation.
In an operatic setting, female voices can
scale almost unbelievable heights and grace
fully carry almost every emotion imaginable.
In the jazz world, female vocalists combine
wit and charm with technical prowess to win
over our hearts and minds. I or soul music,
the female voice rivals the power and beauty
of a hurricane, as exhilarating as it is fright
ening.
At their greatest, female vocalists combine
grace and power into a virtually irresistible
synthesis.
"Heavenly Voices III," a new compilation
of tracks focusing on the female voice, has
much grace but little power.
The musical accompaniment varies great
ly, ranging from medieval-flavored chants to
industrial synth-pop to simple acoustic gui
tars.
All tracks, however, share one similar
quality; the female vocals aim to create a pas
sive, ethereal beauty. The harmonies are
tightly woven together as the various singers
float the vocals along.
Unfortunately, the results, while exquis
itely beautiful, have the consistency of tissue
paper. The album is like a seventy-minute
lullaby.
furthermore, the album seems to take it
self very seriously. The tracks range across a
wide variety of cultures and languages, and
the names of the groups involved, such as
"The Third and the Mortal" and "Merlons of
Nehemiah," are the very height of preten
tiousness.
Still, a number of tracks are quite success
ful taken individually, l.ove Spiral Down
wards' "Write in Water" and Faith and Pis
ease's "A melius Unhappy" are both beautiful
ly written and sung. Bel Cantos "Dewy
Fields" has a surprisingly strong musical pro
gression for a track which is intended to
showcase the female voice.
Indeed, what really holds this album back
is its unwillingness to take risks, 100 often, it
relies 011 the natural beauty of the female
voice instead of pushing it to challenging
heights where the greatest music is made.
Thus, while "Heavenly Voices III" certain
ly has some beautiful moments, the album
lacks the power and ambition of the greatest
female vocalists. Save your money and buy
some Aretha Franklin, Millie Holiday or Bar
bara Hendricks.
