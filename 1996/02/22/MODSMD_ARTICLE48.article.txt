## City Hall 
### 
Al Pacino has been getting no breaks.
In a time when his performances are
ridiculed rather than lauded — though
"Scent of a Woman" earned him an Oscar,
critics harped on his over-the-top portrayal
of Colonel Frank Slade, and in "Heat,"
Robert De Niro stole the critic's applause
while Pacino was written off as tired and ex
aggerated — there is a tendency to do the
same with "City I lall."
Don't make that mistake.
Aside from one misguided scene in which
Pacino, arms flailing and eyeballs bulging,
leads a black church in a rousing fight to regain
the city, the veteran actor's performance as
New York (City Mayor John Pappas is one of his

most satisfying and tender in recent memory.
Armed with a tight script, Pacino — all wan
dering eyes and sing-song tone — brings an
edge to Pappas as only he can. In a line deliv
ered when Pappas is trying to cut a deal with a
Brooklyn ( City (Councilman, Pacino exudes the
essence of not only the character of Pappas, but
New York City as well — he responds to a ques
tion with "because I'm the fucking mayor."
"(City I lall'' is a story of corruption and be
hind-closed doors deal-making that have
enveloped municipal politics since ancient
times. Deputy Mayor Kevin (Calhoun (John
Cusack) plays a Louisiana outsider who
throws curveballs as well as the next person,
but who, in his dealings, has a moral line that
he often toes hut never crosses. The film be
gins with a shoot-out between a drug dealer
and a cop in which a six-year-old boy is
gunned down in the crossfire. Calhoun, in

vestigating vvliy the convicted drug dealer
was out on probation, unfolds an ugly but all
too common political favor that traces its
roots to a City Councilman (Danny Aiello), a
Mafia boss (John Franciosa), a judge (Martin
l andau) and other higher-ups in the New
York City government.
Penned by Ken Upper, a former New York
City deputy mayor, Paul Schrader, Nicholas
Pileggi and bo Goldman, "City Hall" is a
tightly scripted film that offers an insider's
view of the log-rolling, back-scratching and
whispers that underlie New York City poli
tics. Cusack is convincing as an idealistic pro
tege eager to transform his awe of the great
Pappas into a sojourn at the White House —
though his Southern drawl is a tad forced, he
overcomes it with his inept Yiddish and
swaggering mannerisms to paint a perfect
picture of a country hick finding his home in

the political swamp that is City Hall. Danny
Aiello — jovial, down-home, but crooked
just the same — turns in what should be an
Oscar-nominated portrayal of Brooklynite
Frank Anselmo. Bridget Fonda as attorney
Mary Beth Cogan, however, is a puzzling bit
of casting that ultimately has no use in the
story's outcome or development.
Powerful scenes dominate "City Hall."
From mafia boss Zapati's (Franciosa) veiled
but very real threat to Aiello's Anselmo to the
tender closing scene between Pacino and Cu
sack — mentor and protege realizing the fal
lacies and idealism in each other — director
Harold Becker ("Sea of Love") weaves togeth
er the complex plot with a subtle if some
times incoherent hand. It is this subtlety —
along with Al Pacino — that makes "City
Hall" worth watching.
