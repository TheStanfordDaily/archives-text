# Antonia's Line
## 
### 
Few films capture the essence of woman
hood and the extraordinary spiritual bond
between mothers and daughters as complete
ly as "Antonia's Line," a Dutch import and
winner of Best Picture at the 1995 Toronto

Film Festival.
When we first encounter Antonia (Willeke
van Ammelrooy), the 88-year-old Dutch ma
triarch rises from her bed to begin the last day
oilier life. The omniscient narrator informs us
that Antonia will soon beckon her artistic
daughter, Danielle (Els Dottermans), to her
deathbed. The daughter will in turn throw her
mother's grief onto a canvas. Antonia will then

summon her granddaugh
ter, Therese, who Antonia
knows won't resist calcu
lating the exact volume of
her last breath. Finally, An
tonia will call for her great
granddaughter Sarah, who
will someday express An
tonia's story on paper.
These are the women of
"Antonia's Line."
On the surface
"Antonia's Line" is the
story of Antonia's lineage.
Yet at the core, director
Marleen Gorris delivers a
glimpse of the power of
women who no longer de
fine themselves in terms
of men.
With each genera
tion of this Dutch matri
archy, the strength, intelli
gence and independence
of women are spotlight
ed. The women are not
limited in their roles as

wife, mother or daughter. "Antonia's Line"
portrays men as contributors to love, friend
ship and parenthood, yet secondary to the in
dependent lives of each woman.
The women are never portrayed as lacking
character; they search for that which makes
them complete as individuals. For Antonia it
is economic security and the ability to assist
those who, like herself, are outcasts of a rigid

society. For Danielle, completeness rests in
the ability to have a child without the con
straints of marriage and the devotion of her
lover. Although Therese, Antonia's grand
daughter, is married, her loving marriage
never overshadows her search for meaning
through scholarship. Since Sarah is merely a
child at the time of Antonia's death we survey
only a portion of her life, yet are led to believe
her destiny lies in the art of prose.
The film uses the seasons as a metaphor to
illustrate the cyclic motion of life. As winter
gives rise to spring, we see each woman give
birth and pass on the gifts of life to her child.
The timing of the seasons seems to echo the
course of Antonia's life. The swift passing of
the seasons towards the end of the film mirror
the rapid degeneration of Antonia's health
(Willeke van Ammelrooy's inspirational por
trayal of Antonia as the aging matriarch en
hances the beautifully written screenplay).
In the end, the film travels full circle back
to the day of Antonia's death. The omniscient
narrator reminds us of those who will gather
at her bedside, yet by now, they are no longer
unfamiliar characters. We know what lies in
the hearts of their being. We know what im
pact they have had upon Antonia's life. As we
watch Antonia's descendants at her
deathbed, the narration changes to first per
son. The true translator of Antonia's history,
her great-granddaughter Sarah, is revealed.
At this moment, we feel a part of Antonia in
Sarah and we realize that "Antonia's Line" has
only just begun.
