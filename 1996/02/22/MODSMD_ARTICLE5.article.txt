# Re-keyed Row
## Res Comp loses master key; $100K to replace all locks 
### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
Due to a misplaced master key, Housing and
Dining Services officials yesterday changed access
locks for 28 Row houses, and plans are underway
to re-key locks for student rooms.
The total bill for the Row re-keying project will
likely cost more than $100,000, said Rodger Whit
ney, associate director of student housing. Re-key
ing for individual student rooms can cost up to
$75.
"When you re-key that number of Row houses
it'B a substantial charge," Whitney said.
A recent Stanford graduate working at Residen
tial Computing checked out a master key to assist
an internal audit two weeks ago, said Director of
Residential Computing Jeff Merriman, and since
then the key not been found. The master keys are
not normally distributed, but the key was checked
out to assist Arthur Andersen and Co. representa
tives in a property assessment, he said.
After Merriman informed Housing and Dining
officials last week of the disappearance, Whitney
said he decided everything had to be re-keyed.
"In many cases the keys will
turn up," Whitney said. "But be
cause of security and safety rea
sons, we are re-keying all the res
idences."
Residential Computing, de
spite a shrinking budget, will
likely cover the entire cost of the
project, Whitney said. However,
it is unclear which portion of
Residential Computing's budget
will be cut.
"If Residential Computing
were to bear the entire cost,
we're not quite clear where we
could do that," Merriman said.
"We have reserves set aside for

purchase of equipment. We
would try to find one-time
money, budget savings, maybe
not do something this year we
were planning to do. We certain
ly wouldn't transfer the costs to
students."
Whitney said he will hold fur
ther meetings with Residential
Computing to discuss repercus
sions of the re-keying on its bud
get.
"There's no money in any
body's budget,"he said. "We
have to all sit down and talk
about the best ways to cover this
through existing resources."
Six locksmiths were busy
early yesterday, re-keying door
locks throughout the Row. In ad
dition, letters were delivered to
all Row residences explaining the

changes. Whitney said the
process for replacing keys for the
1,000 or so residents on the Row
should begin soon.
"You do what you have to do to
get the job done," said Chip
Knott, a University locksmith
who has been working 17-hour
days for the last week to oversee
the re-keying. "Our responsibili
ty is to the students. It builds
character."
Whitney said massive re-key
ing projects are not uncommon,
although the circumstances of
this incident are unique.
"It's one of those unfortunate
things we regret," Whitney said.
"There's no question that it
I should | be re-keyed even though
history has told us in many times
it will turn up."
