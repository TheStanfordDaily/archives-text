# Re-keyed Row
## Res Comp loses master key; $100K to replace all locks 
### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
Due to a misplaced master key, Housing and
Dining Services officials yesterday changed access
locks for 28 Row houses, and plans are underway
to re-key locks for student rooms.
The total bill for the Row re-keying project will
likely cost more than $100,000, said Rodger Whit
ney, associate director of student housing. Re-key
ing for individual student rooms can cost up to
$75.
"When you re-key that number of Row houses
it'B a substantial charge," Whitney said.
A recent Stanford graduate working at Residen
tial Computing checked out a master key to assist
an internal audit two weeks ago, said Director of
Residential Computing Jeff Merriman, and since
then the key not been found. The master keys are
not normally distributed, but the key was checked
out to assist Arthur Andersen and Co. representa
tives in a property assessment, he said.
After Merriman informed Housing and Dining
officials last week of the disappearance, Whitney
said he decided everything had to be re-keyed.
