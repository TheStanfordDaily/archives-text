# Up Close and Personal
## 
### 
Michelle Pfeiffer has a habit of doing films
with piss-poor titles (Dangerous Minds,
Wolf, Love Field) and piss-poor storylines
(guess). "Up Close and Personal" is a laugh
ably obvious and desperately romantic love
story.
Pfeiffer plays smalltown-girl-gone-big
time-journalist Tally Atwater. I ler older and
wiser dinosaur mentor, Robert Redford,
teaches her the ropes. He also teaches her
what love is! The film's motto is "every mo
ment we have together is more than we de
serve." This is how audiences will feel about
their relationship to the film.
Pfeiffer is a good actress who never gets
pushed far enough. Her performance in this

film is good. But she has the capacity to be
doing damn good work. Since it is blindingly
obvious that her work is mediocre, its easy to
get bored — and I'm someone who thinks
Pfeiffer is a stud. 1 put her — due to her ca
pacity — on the mantle piece with Emma
Thompson and Angela Bassett. But she keeps
leaping off. Pfieffer is starting to become a
blonde Demi Moore.
Don't expect Robert Red ford to make the
film interesting. He's still relying on that "I'm
a handsome man" quality to act for him, but
he's not a handsome man anymore. However
handsome he is, he certainly feels too old to
be having all these pathetic and overdone
love scenes with Pfeiffer.
In one love scene, Redford rams Pfeiffer,
gasping and heaving, up against a wall. But it
looks like he's having a cardiac arrest and
falling on her. Then in another scene he tries

to hold her on his shoulders but drops her in
the ocean. Fortunately we are saved from a
good view of his aged bare chest by Pfeiffer's
falling, screaming body.
The first half of this two-hour trek is palat
able because it is all up to Pfeiffer to experi
ence Tally's rise to success. Somehow, this al
legedly true story of Tally Atwater's career be
comes the tale of how a wise older man can
snatch himself a young sex kitten. Pfeiffer is
almost 40, but the film draws her as Redford's
new pretty young thing from the very mo
ment they meet.
Everything is simplified to such a degree
that it insults the audience's attention. There
is not one moment, line of dialogue or
Robert Redford pose that we all haven't seen
before.
Just don't go. Please.
