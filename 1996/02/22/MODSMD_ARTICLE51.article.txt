## Muppet Treasure Island 
### 
A parade of weird parrot-lobsters, vaca
tioning rats and Barry Manilow-esque musi
cal numbers kick off the new Muppet movie,
"Muppet Treasure Island." Based loosely on
Robert Stevenson's classic novel, the film is a
high-seas adventure — Muppet style.
Jim Hawkins (played by Kevin Bishop,
whose mid-pubertal good looks will soon
have pre-teens swooning) sets out with a
treasure map and his faithful companions,
Riz/o and Gonzo. They procure the good
ship "Hispaniola" to find the treasure, but
the crew has other ideas...
What follows is a ludicrous and high-en
ergy tale of adventure, intrigue and warthogs
«is Jim learns the value of true friendship and
the audience learns that old Muppets can
learn new tricks.
For the first time, all our favorite charac
ters are "in character." Fozzie is present as
Squire Trelawney, the rich half-wit squire
who finances the expedition with the help of

"Mr. Binky," the guy who lives in his finger.
Kermit the Frog plays a dashing Captain
Smollet. While Miss Piggy (clad in a stunning
leopard skin print dress and feather arm
bands) portrays a sultry Benjamina Smith (A
personal highlight is when Kermieand Piggy
sing an ironically touching duet while dan
gling off a cliff — which, as the leopard-print
goes up, shows Miss Piggy's chunky legs off to
a sizable advantage).
We don't even mind the human actors.
Tim Curry plays the part of one-legged pirate
l ong John Silver brilliantly, though you'll be
stumped as to how the special effect guys
pulled it off, (the leg that is). Bishop may
shriek castrato in his musical numbers, but
he plays the part of the confused adolescent
ready for adventure convincingly.
Brian Henson, Jim's son, also creates a
boat-load of new villains: Old Harry, Really
Old Harry and Dead Harry, to name a few.
The free reign on designing new Muppets
has entertaining results (no bones about it
skeletal Dead Harry is a funny addition to
the cast). However, some of the new cre
ations make the humor a little deadpan.
Long lohn Silver's lobster-parrot is more
strange than clever. And the three main

Muppet villains are ofgrungy, unidentifiable
make.
Despite new elements, the movie retains
classic Muppet features. Self-aware humor,

song and dance numbers and an appeal for
audiences of all ages combine under the di
rection of Henson for a great film.
