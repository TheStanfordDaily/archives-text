## Travis Vigil Reed vs. Chopin: feeling the music 
### 
Despite all the computations / You could just go
out and dance to the rock and roll station / And
it was all right.
— Lou Reed, "Rock and Roll"
True Music ... must repeat the thoughts and
inspirations of the people and the time. My peo
ple are Americans. My time is today.
— George Gershwin
Inside my backpack I have two CDs: "The
Best of Chopin" and"The Best of the Vel
vet Underground." Both consist of a little
more than one hour's worth of music and I
like both very much.
Lou Reed and Frederick Chopin: I should
be struck down by a lightning bolt to even
mention the likes of a Lou Reed in the same
breath as such a great composer as Chopin. 1
should be hit by a bus full of classical musi

cians. I should get a tuning fork embedded in
my skull.
My problem is that I don't see the differ
ence. Call me a heathen. Call mc defiant. I just
can't see it.
I mean, I've intently listened many times as
the complexity and elegance of classical music
have been touted while the slip-shod, base na
ture of rock and roll has been exposed. I have
seen the scorn that some of the Musicians in
Braun hold for the "musicians" who perform
the "bastard son of the blues." The contention
is that classical music and popular music, or
"serious" music and popular music, are
worlds apart. One not even worth mention
ing in an anthology on Western music and the
other having the anthology devoted to it.
I guess I can see their point. I really do. The
intricacy of a lot of classical music, and that of
Chopin in particular, is amazing. His

melodies and harmonies melt into each other
gracefully and beautifully. Sometimes it is
enough to make you cry or scream. Some
times it makes you smile. It is always enough
to make you feel. Chopin dedicated his life to
the study and production of beautiful music.
It is timeless. It is powerful. For this he should
be respected.
But to my untrained ears, I can see the
merits of the Velvet Underground too. Lou
Reed took the grime of the city, the clatter of
subways and the rumble of traffic and turned
it into music. He found hope — in the form of
rock and roll — amidst the clutter and absur
dity of urban New York. The city wasn't beau
tiful and neither was his music, but at least the
music made everything "all right."
Lou Reed has dedicated his life to making
rock and roll. Rudimentary and basic, fallible
and sloppy: that's rock and roll. Pertinent to

our time, pertinent to our world: that's the
Velvet Underground. It is timely. It is power
ful. For this he should be respected.
It is impossible for me to distinguish be
tween feelings elicited from "Sweet Jane" and
those from a Chopin "Nocturne." As sophis
ticated as human beings become, we are still
instinctual creatures. The difference between
our heartbeat and our songs, between our
grunts and our poetry may not be so dis
parate. One needs to acknowledge the neces
sity of the other to exist.
Lou Reed is no Chopin, this is for sure. But
at the same time Chopin is no Lou Reed. It is
impossible to teach someone to compose like
Chopin. Also, it is impossible to teach some
one to write the perfect pop song as Reed has.
Both men found the music in their souls.
Both men have shared it with the world. For
me, there is no difference.

out and dance to the rock and roll station / And
it was all right.
