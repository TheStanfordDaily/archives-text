## Former Berkeley aide Broque picked to head Irvine project 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
Eric Broque, a former assistant vice chancellor for
budget and administration at UC-Berkeley, has been
hired as the project director for the Irvine Academic
Planning Project, a comprehensive examination of
Stanford and its future.
Broque, who will serve a term of two years start
ing Monday, was chosen from a nationwide pool of
applicants, said Vice Provost for Institutional Plan
ning Geoffrey Cox.
"Broque has got a lot of relevant experience," Cox
said. "He comes from a university similar to Stan
ford in its complexity and its quality. I thought that
was important. He came with excellent references
and he had me convinced that he would do a good
job."
When contacted yesterday, Broque declined to
comment on his appointment.
The creation of the project was announced last
month. It is the product of an $800,000 grant to the
University by the James Irvine Foundation. The
grant will be administered over the next two years.
Focusing on academic planning and restructur-
ing, the project will attempt to an
swer how Stanford can maintain
and strengthen its programs with
fewer resources.
The study will also look at how
the University can become less de
pendent on increases in tuition
and how to better foster diversity
in the curriculum and among fac
ulty and students.

In order to answer these ques
tions, the University will under
take eight research projects.
These projects include evaluating
programs, examining Stanford's
use of technology, analyzing the
cost of the academic enterprise,
undertaking infrastructure plan
ning, examining the system of fac
ulty rewards and incentives, and
developing new models for admin
istrative services.
The project will be headed by an
advisory board chaired by Provost
Condoleezza Rice and consist of

about a dozen experts from both
inside and outside Stanford. Cox
will supervise the program.
As project director, Broque's
duties will include "coordinating
data collection and analysis and
preparing reports and position pa
pers," Cox said. "He will be both
actively engaged in work and man
aging work of others who are par
ticipating in the project."
At UC-Berkeley, Broque was in
volved in budget and management
work. Prior to that, he worked at
University of Vermont, Cox said.
