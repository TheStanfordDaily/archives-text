# What floats their boat Concrete canoe gets the drift

When Mark Shieh tells people that he is
part of a group of students designing, build
ing and racing a canoe made out of concrete,
he is often met with a puzzled look. "Every
body's first reaction is 'Huh? Does it
float?' "said Shieh, a senior majoring in civil
engineering.
Last year, Shieh and the 20 other mem
bers of the Concrete Canoe Project floated
their canoe of concrete to a fourth place fin
ish in the regionals of the American Society
of Civil Engineers Concrete Canoe Competi
tion. This April, Stanford will host the re
gional race of the ninth annual national
competition.
"We came on the scene, and Stanford
hadn't been on the scene for a while, so
[other schools said 1 'It's your turn to host it,' "
said Shieh. The competition will take place
at nearby Shoreline Park.
Stanford's return to competition last year
was sparked by a chance encounter involving
Shieh, an engineering professor and an air
plane.
"I was on a plane coming back to Stan
ford, and sitting next to me was an engineer
ing professor from Santa Clara. We got to
talking, and he asked me if Stanford was
going to have a boat in the competition," said
Shieh. "I didn't know anything about it, and
he laughed, because he knew about Stan
ford's wavering involvement in the past."
For Shieh, that meeting served as the im
petus for the organization of the Concrete
Canoe Project. The students involved break
into three teams, which focus on design, con
crete mix and management.
Competition scores are based on two main

factors: an academic presentation, including
a paper, oral explanation and display, worth
60 percent of the final tally; and the actual
canoe race, worth 40 percent.
"Last year, we were working on high en
ergy because no one really had experience,"
Shieh said. But with a year of competition

under their belts, project members have be
come more focused, according to Shieh.
"We're quite excited by the technologies
we're using this year," said Shieh. "Our boat
was actually designed on the computer,

using Max Surf, which is the same
software yacht builders use."
Senior Jack Lin, this year's
project manager, described the
design process as a balance of give
and take, "There are two trade
offs that we're working around —
one with the design of the canoe
itself and one with the concrete."
Lin said the concrete mix is af
fected by what type of aggregates
are chosen for the mix. Light ag
gregates make lighter cement,
and vice versa.
"The lighter [the canoe] is, the
faster it's going to be," said Lin.
"But if you sacrifice too much
strength, it's going to break."
One of the more important
rules of the competition states
that "the canoe must float when
filled with water and be certified
as such before entering the
race." Sometimes what looks
good on paper doesn't hold up
when put to the test, said senior
Ghyung Min Chon, a second
year member of the Concrete
Canoe Project.
"There are some teams that do
really well on the academic part,
and then when they get to the

dunk test their boats just sink,"
explained Chon.
Another large factor in the
races is presentation. Teams tend
to be lavish in presenting their ca
noes, Baid Lin.
"Our theme this year is 'Tiger
Salamander,' " said Lin. "We're
going to paint the canoe as the

body of a salamander, and attach
a head to it and a tail and four
legs."
"Since salamanders are scared
of fire, we're going to show up in
firemen's uniforms and maybe
start a small bonfire in front of
the boat and play '2001' music,"
said Shieh.
With all the time and elaborate
planning spent on the canoe, what
happens to it after the race is fin
ished?
According to Shieh, "Last year,
some people wanted to keep it as a
practice boat. But in the end we
threw a party and had a demoli

tion. Some people kept memen
tos, and we have a symbolic piece
in our lab right now."
Members of the Concrete
Canoe Project say they get a lot in
return for all their efforts, includ
ing a unit of class credit and a
sense of camaraderie.
"The group has definitely

bonded," said Shieh. "We have a
good chemistry. If you come to
our meetings we're laughing a lot,
joking."
"You have to do a lot of reading
and problem sets," said Shieh.
"But you really don't mind spend
ing a lot of time. You go in and you
work on this thing, and three, five
hours later you can see the fruits
of your labor."
Lin agreed, "It's a lot of work,
but at the end of the competition
last year I walked away with this
incredible sense of satisfaction
that's just unmatched by any
thing else."
