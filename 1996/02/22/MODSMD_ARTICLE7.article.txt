# What floats their boat Concrete canoe gets the drift

When Mark Shieh tells people that he is
part of a group of students designing, build
ing and racing a canoe made out of concrete,
he is often met with a puzzled look. "Every
body's first reaction is 'Huh? Does it
float?' "said Shieh, a senior majoring in civil
engineering.
Last year, Shieh and the 20 other mem
bers of the Concrete Canoe Project floated
their canoe of concrete to a fourth place fin
ish in the regionals of the American Society
of Civil Engineers Concrete Canoe Competi
tion. This April, Stanford will host the re
gional race of the ninth annual national
competition.
"We came on the scene, and Stanford
hadn't been on the scene for a while, so
[other schools said 1 'It's your turn to host it,' "
said Shieh. The competition will take place
at nearby Shoreline Park.
Stanford's return to competition last year
was sparked by a chance encounter involving
Shieh, an engineering professor and an air
plane.
"I was on a plane coming back to Stan
ford, and sitting next to me was an engineer
ing professor from Santa Clara. We got to
talking, and he asked me if Stanford was
going to have a boat in the competition," said
Shieh. "I didn't know anything about it, and
he laughed, because he knew about Stan
ford's wavering involvement in the past."
For Shieh, that meeting served as the im
petus for the organization of the Concrete
Canoe Project. The students involved break
into three teams, which focus on design, con
crete mix and management.
Competition scores are based on two main

factors: an academic presentation, including
a paper, oral explanation and display, worth
60 percent of the final tally; and the actual
canoe race, worth 40 percent.
"Last year, we were working on high en
ergy because no one really had experience,"
Shieh said. But with a year of competition

under their belts, project members have be
come more focused, according to Shieh.
"We're quite excited by the technologies
we're using this year," said Shieh. "Our boat
was actually designed on the computer,

go this year.
