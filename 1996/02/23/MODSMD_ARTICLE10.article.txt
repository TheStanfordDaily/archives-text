# New program aims to create activists
##

A group that began as a spark in the mind of
Bay Area student leaders in the late 1980s has
finally come to fruition.
About 15 Stanford students met with lead
ers of Justice Matters — which aims to create
a multi-racial social justice movement in
Northern California — in an informational
meeting earlier this week. The meeting ad
dressed students' specific concerns on multi
racial unity and social justice and ways in
which they might become involved in effecting
social change.
Steve Phillips, who graduated from Stan
ford in 1990, is a founding member of the
group and a member of the board of directors.
Phillips said this organization is different
from many other similar programs in that it
recognizes racial and cultural differences.
"There's actually very little out there that
takes the kind of approach we do to building
multi-racial unity," said Phillips, who is cur
rently president of the San Francisco Unified
School District Board of Education. "We do

not subscribe to the 'color-blind' notion. We
feel the best way to build unity between races
is to develop understanding and respect for
one another's cultures."
The group's first project will be the Com
munity Fellows Project, and hopes to provide
a multi-racial cross-section of college student
leaders with the skills for organizing social
change.
The Community Fellows Project will begin
this June with a selection of 10 students from
Stanford, San Francisco State and San Jose
State Universities.
"The ideal is that students go through this
program and become more effective leaders on
their campuses and in their communities,"
said Josette Cordova, executive director of the
program. "We want to give people breadth of
experience in the summer session — being in
volved in an issue-based campaign, advocacy
and policy work and grass-roots organizing."
Fellows will be asked to choose a focus from
five key areas: educational reform, youth ad
vocacy, workers' rights, affirmative action and
immigrants' rights.
After the summer session the project will

begin recruiting students for the school-year
session, which will last approximately 15
weeks. Phillips hopes the Community Fellows
Project will eventually become a statewide
program.
Junior Derek Yarbrough, who attended the
informational meeting, said he was interested
in Justice Matters because it is not race-spe
cific.
"I think a lot of times at Stanford, when
students are into politics and issues, it's very
focused on race," Yarbrough said. "Racial
communities at Stanford will work together,
but it's almost divisive. Justice Matters is fo
cusing on issues but doing it across racial
lines, so it's not just a Latino or a black issue."
Phillips said the organization hopes to cre
ate a newsletter, a World Wide Web page and
ultimately a magazine to promote the cultural
and intellectual works of people who may not
have a forum for their ideas.
"As people think about how to build a
multi-racial society, we want to impact that
discussion, so it's not just the Pete Wilsons
and the Hoover Institutions that do that," he
said.
