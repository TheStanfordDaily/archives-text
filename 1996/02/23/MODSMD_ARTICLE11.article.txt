## Dole sets strategy Candidate casts Buchanan as 'extreme' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - II was
two days before the New Hamp
shire primary and Pat Buchanan
was pacing his hotel room, shaking
his head in bewilderment at a Bob
Dole television ad labeling
Buchanan "too extreme" to be
president.
"Why is my old friend doing this
to me?" Buchanan asked a visitor.
"Go back over this entire cam
paign. I have never said anything
harsh about Bob Dole. But he left
me no choice."
The wisdom of the decision to
cast Buchanan as an extremist is
being hotly debated within the
Dole campaign and in broader
GOP circles, where many believe
that it is Dole who went to
extremes with his criticism.
Since Dole launched his ad,
Buchanan has dropped any reluc
tance to attack the Kansas sena
tor, even though he has told close
associates he still believes Dole is
most likely to emerge as the
Republican nominee.
In the final days of the New
Hampshire campaign, Buchanan
launched ads criticizing Dole for
supporting billions in tax increases
and said the Senate majority lead
er had sided with big banks and
corporations on trade and foreign
aid deals that Buchanan says cost
American jobs.
And as Buchanan campaigned
yesterday in Arizona, he suggested
Dole and others who say
Buchanan risks dividing the party
ought to look in the mirror.
"I've always supported the
Republican nominee," he said.
"But I tell you, the name calling is

making it very difficult for my peo
ple and my movement to support
someone who's called me a lot of
names."
Publicly, Dole aides defended
the strategy. "None whatsoever,"
Dole campaign manager Scott
Reed said when asked if he had any
doubts about the anti-Buchanan
ad and subsequent attacks.
Dole has stuck to the script,
framing the race as " between
mainstream conservatism and
extremism." A radio version of the
New Hampshire ad is being aired
in South Carolina.
Several top Dole advisers have
opposed the strategy from the out
set. Some believe the ad cost Dole a
victory in New Hampshire, by
motivating Buchanan voters and
feeding into his rivals' complaints
that a desperate Dole was going
negative.
Some outside strategists warn
that in labeling Buchanan
extreme, Dole is casting aspersions
on Buchanan voters, a constituen
cy that will be critical to whoever
carries the GOP banner against
President Clinton in the fall.
Ralph Reed, executive director
of the Christian Coalition, com
pared the attacks on Buchanan to
those leveled at religious broad
caster Pat Robertson when he
sought the 1988 GOP nomination.
"I do not think it is wise to
attack what is a fourth to a third of
the Republican primary electorate
as ipso facto extremist and intoler
ant," Reed said in an interview.
"Democrats have tried that line for
years and Christian conservatives
not only reject it, but resent it."
