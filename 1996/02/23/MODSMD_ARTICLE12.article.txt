SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Former Secretary
of State George Shultz, who helped establish
one of the nation's first affirmative action pro
grams, came out yesterday in favor of a Califor
nia initiative to end such efforts.
Shultz, a Stanford professor and a distin
guished fellow at the Hoover Institution,
deemed present affirmative action programs
"counterproductive."
"The scene has changed so much" since he
helped develop the "Philadelphia Plan" as labor
secretary in the Nixon administration, he said.
Shultz went on to serve 6 1/2 years as secretary
of state in the Reagan cabinet.
In a telephone interview, Shultz said he
"fully supports" the initiative, dubbed the Cali
fornia Civil Rights Initiative by its proponents.
Present affirmative action programs have
taken on a "bureaucratic life of their own" and
foster racial tensions, he said.
The regulations aggravate racial divisions and
appear to "have been written by Buchanan him
self," Shultz said, referring to Republican presi
dential contender Pat Buchanan, who, among
other things, has said he would make English
the official language of the United States and
build a fence along parts of the Mexican border.
Shultz was instrumental in forming the
"Philadelphia Plan" that was signed into law by
his assistant, Arthur Fletcher, in 1969.
"The idea was to get blacks into skilled con
struction jobs," Shultz said.
For the first time, the government set specif
ic targets on minority hiring in order for con
tractors to be eligible for federal contracts.
Started in Philadelphia, the idea eventually
spread.
"People today don't have a point of reference
about how things were then," he said.
Shultz recalled his days as a professor at the
University of Chicago's graduate school of busi
ness in the early 1960s when an effort was made
to recruit blacks.
"We had to go out and find them," he said.
