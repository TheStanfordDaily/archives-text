# Texas fires devastating to residents

### 
POOLVILLE, Texas (AP) — Linda
Dixon stood ankle-deep in the ashes look
ing for bits and pieces of her life. She
wasn't having much luck.
"There's nothing left. Nothing," she
said, her face ruddy and covered with
soot from digging in 90-degree heat.
Dixon's small wood-frame ranch
house was one of 65 homes destroyed by
raging grass fires that continued to
spread yesterday in Parker and Wise
counties in north Texas, fueled by gusty
winds and grass so dry from drought that
it crackled beneath one's feet.
In all, some 23,000 acres had burned
yesterday afternoon, down from earlier
estimates, by the time firefighters had
about 70 percent of the flames contained
in the two counties.
The grass fire near Poolville, 35 miles
northwest of Fort Worth, also injured at
least 49 people. Another 90 buildings and
an equal number of vehicles were also
destroyed or damaged, said Joe Clement,
a spokesman for the Texas Department

of Safety.
Unseasonably hot, windy and tinder
dry weather has been feeding fires across
Texas. Gov. George W. Bush asked for a
federal disaster declaration for the entire
state.
Officials instituted a ban on outdoor
burning across about a fourth of the
state. They also warned of automobiles
sparking dry grass, motorists tossing
cigarettes or matches, and arson.
As of yesterday, almost 3,000 sepa
rate fires had consumed more than
79,000 statewide acres in the first seven
weeks of 1996, and for every fire report
ed, eight more were unreported and
dealt with locally, said Jo Schwiekhard
Moss, a state Emergency Management
spokeswoman.
By comparison, 1,500 fires charred
18,000 acres in all of 1995.
Other than the clothes on her back,
Dixon had managed to salvage 20-some
pieces of broken dishes and one spoon,
which she piled in what used to be the

corner of her kitchen.
Dixon, who ranches on a small spread
with her husband and 3-year-old son,
said they lost their home in a matter of
minutes yesterday.
"I had the hose going," she said, wip
ing the sweat from her face with her
blackened work glovos. "We thought we
were OK, but the wind shifted, stopped
and changed direction on us. It was here
just like that."
The family turned its livestock, cattle
and hogs loose to fend for themselves.
"It's about all you can do," she said.
"The flames were just everywhere. The
heat was just so intense. The flames were
jumping."
All that remained of the barn was the
corrugated tin roof, which lay over a
smoking heap of ashes.
"My husband managed to drive the
tractor down into the field and saved it,"
she said. "The clothes on my back are all
that I have. But it's just things — we'll be
all right."
