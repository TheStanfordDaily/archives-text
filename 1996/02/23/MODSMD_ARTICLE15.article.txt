# US announces settlement of Iran's claims
## $131.8 million deal will include compensation for '88 shooting down of Iranian airliner 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
United States and Iran
announced a $131.8 million set
tlement yesterday of Iranian
claims against the United States,
including compensation for the
1988 shooting down of an Iranian
airliner that killed 290 people.
The State Department said no
U.S. money would go to the Irani
an government. Family members
of Iranians killed when the U.S.
Navy cruiser Vincennes shot an
Iran Air A-300 Airbus out of the
aii' over the Persian Gulf on July
3, 1988, will share $61.8 million,
the department said.
It said the other $70 million in
the package will go into bank
accounts used to pay off private
U.S. claims against Iran and
Iran's expenses for the Iran-U.S.

Claims Tribunal, which is han
dling the claims. That portion was
in settlement of Iranian claims
involving banking matters, not
the airliner, U.S. officials said.
Contradicting the U.S. state
ment that the Iranian govern
ment was receiving none of the
money, Tehran announced the
settlement as merely a payment
to Iran. In addition, the govern
ment news agency IRNA reported
that $30 million was to compen
sate for the lost airliner, but U.S.
officials denied that.
In light of the agreement, cases
covered by the settlement that
were pending before the bilateral
claims tribunal or the Interna
tional Court of Justice were dis
missed, officials said.
State Department spokesman

Nicholas Burns said the airliner
settlement "does not signal any
change in our relations with
Iran."
Settlement of the bank claims
portion of the package also has
"no political significance,"
Burns said, noting that other
claims have been settled periodi
cally over the years. Many of
those arose when then-President
Carter froze Iranian assets in
the United States in response to
the taking of American hostages
at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
in 1979.
"There is no change to our
opposition to objectionable Irani
an policies such as support for
terrorism and pursuit of weapons
of mass destruction," he said.
Iran had filed a claim before

the World Court in The Hague
about what the United States
says was the accidental shooting
down of the airliner, although
then-President Reagan immedi
ately offered to pay families of all
victims.
The suit, U.S. officials said,
made it impossible to pay Iranian
victims. Now that can be done.
Survivors of Italians, former
Yugoslavs and other nationalities
aboard the plane already have
been paid, Burns said.
The settlement would provide
$300,000 for wage-earning vic
tims and $150,000 for non-wage
earners. To make the payments,
$61.8 million will be deposited in
a bank in Zurich, Switzerland, in
an account jointly held by Iran
and the United States.
