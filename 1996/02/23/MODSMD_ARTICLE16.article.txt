Clinton nominates chair
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Clin
ton assembled a Federal Reserve package
deal he hopes will keep the economy growing
smoothly through the election year, nomi
nating Republican Alan Greenspan for a
third term as chairman and White House
budget director Alice Rivlin for the No. 2
spot.
Making the announcements yesterday in
an Oval Office ceremony, Clinton said he
also was nominating St. Louis economist
Laurence H. Meyer to fill a third Fed seat.
He acknowledged he was forced to do some
arm twisting to put the team together.
Earlier this month, Rivlin bluntly
expressed her lack of interest in a Fed posi
tion, saying she preferred to remain head of
the Office of Management and Budget to see
the marathon budget negotiations to a con
clusion.
But Clinton joked, "I haven't lost all my

powers of persuasion. Battered and bloodied
as I may be, I can still, once in a while, make
a good argument."
Clinton, trying to fill three of the seven
seats on the Fed board of governors in an
election year with the Senate in Republican
hands, hopes that by combining Greenspan,
a conservative Republican, with two
Democrats, he can win approval as a package
deal.

Thief' and the "Wizard of Oz" all made the
cut. But not "Casablanca" or any film star

movies of all time.

movies — from Charlie Chaplin's "Modern
Times" to Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh
Seal" — that represent the best film has to
offer from the church's perspective.
