## Stopping instability 
### 
The ASSU Senate must
make real decisions on
special fee requests

THE ASSU special-fee fund
ing system has never been
noted for its stability.
Nonetheless, as a major source of
funds for community-enriching
student groups ranging from the
Black Student Union to Club
Sports, the special fee system
needs to remain strong.
With the spring election cycle
starting up, the ASSU needs to
ensure that the system doesn't
return to the instability that has
plagued it in recent years. As the
senate's Appropriations Com
mittee begins to interview spe
cial-fee groups this weekend, its
members should take care to
carefully evaluate each group's
budget — and they should be
willing to trim or even to reject
groups whose budgets do not ful
fill the ASSU's criteria.
Why should the committee be
more careful? Some recent history
is telling. Until two years ago, the
special-fee charge that appears on
students' quarterly bills had been
rising to alarming levels.
The forces driving this trend —
students' guaranteed right to
refund fees of groups they did not
want to support combined with
guidelines that allowed groups to
inflate their budgets in anticipa
tion of these refunds — led to a
vicious cycle: groups increasde
their special-fee requests, which
encouraged more students to take
refunds, which encourages
groups to raise their fee requests
even more.
By the 1993-1994 school year,
special fees charged to students
totaled $120; in that year's elec
tions, partly because of the high
fees, students rejected a large
number of special-fee requests.
Since then, fees have been more

reasonable (this year they total
just under $100) and the system
has stabilized. However, the Com
mon Sense Fee Reform Amend
ment passed last spring threatens
to disrupt this, even though stabi
lizing the system was the main
point of the amendment.
The amendment allows special
fee groups to ask for funding from
only undergraduate students,
from only graduate students or
from both groups. Since most
groups that ask for special fees
tend to be oriented towards under
graduates, it's possible that under
graduate special fees could sky
rocket next year, perhaps to as
high as $150 depending on the
outcome of the spring election.
With fees that high, we could be
returning to the instability of just
a few years ago: Students will have
more incentive to refund because
of the expense, which could lead
groups to inflate their budgets fur
ther. And so on.
That's why it is important for
the Appropriations Committee,
which is charged with evaluating
special-fee group budgets, to be
willing to trim groups' budgets if
they aren't consistent with the
delineated criteria.
For the record, these criteria —
which are listed in the by-laws of
the ASSU — ask how reasonable is
the detailed budget, how reason
able is the total fee request,
whether sources of income outside
the special fee should be consid
ered, whether the service provided
by the group is of value to the stu
dent body and whether the special
fee is appropriate to pay for this
service.
In the past, the Appropriations
Committee has failed to closely
scrutinize groups budgets, and
there have been some obvious
oversights. These oversights are a
symptom of a larger problem —
the ASSU doesn't think its role is
to evaluate and change special-fee
group budgets. If it wants to avoid
the special-fee instability seen in
recent years, the ASSU needs to
change its mind about this role.
