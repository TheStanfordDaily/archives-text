Hoover fellow employed faulty environmental arguments

I came up with a question while read
ing Thomas G. Moore's letter in
Tuesday's Daily: Is he kidding me?
I agree with the author that academic
freedom and free speech are essential at
a university. Whoopee! Likewise, we are
likely to encounter little but "Yeas" and
"Hear, hears" from the peanut gallei-y in
response to his assertion that "a major
role of universities is to foster research
that challenges prevailing dogma." But
the seeming innocence of this comment
betrays the foulness that begets it.
In writing (or defending) "Global
Warming: A Boon to Humans and Other
Animals," Moore and his farrago of
accomplices at the Hoover Institution
aren't just challenging the prevailing
dogma. Rather, they already subscribe to
a dogma (free-market, unfettered-capi
talist, trickle-down, dig-it-up, cut-it
down, caveat emptoratin', deregulating
corporate-subsidatin' economics), and
they happily forge new territory in
crackpot science in an effort to prove
their points. Can we expect good impar

tial research on the climate from a group
of people who want the research to sug
gest that interfering with the free mar
ket only begets sub-optimal situations?
That's like Du Pont saying that, lo and
behold, CFCs are good for the ozone
after all! Economists are allowed to talk
about things other than money, but
when they have economic conclusions
before they run any experiments, the sci
entific method is shamed.
Is it just or good fortune that the free
market discourages greenhouse gas
emissions abatement, which luckily gives
the planet more warming potential, and
a warming planet happens to be a "boon
to humans and other animals?" I suspect
foul play.
Moore glosses over facts in the latter
half of his letter. As he is a senior fellow,
I would imagine that he is aware of
those facts but chose not to include
them. I guess that's how senior fellows
become senior fellows at the Hoover
Institution.
Yes, the climate has fluctuated over

the last 100,000 years, and before that,
too. In the period between roughly
140,000 and 131,000 years ago (the peri
od of most rapid change on record), the
Earth warmed up about 10 degrees Cel
sius — a rate of a little more than 1 C
per 100 years. The combination of
anthropogenic methane, chlorofluorocar
bons, and carbon dioxide that will accu
mulate in the next 50 years will cause an
amount of warming approximately equal
to a doubling of atmospheric carbon
dioxide concentrations. According to an
international, representative panel of
scientists (the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Control), this doubling would
increase the Earth's mean temperature
between 1.5 C and 4.5 C. Factoring in
the delay caused by thermal inertia of
the oceans, we might expect this warm
ing to happen in the subsequent 50
years, i.e., by 2100. Checking my trusty
calculator I see that those numbers
describe a warming trend of 15 C to 40 C
per thousand years, decidedly faster
than any warming in our planet's histo

ry (as far as we know).
Would this warming cause flora and
fauna to flourish, as Moore suggests?
Most likely not. Such a warming could
cause climate ranges and habitats to
shift 500 to 1,000 kilometers toward the
poles, and it's unlikely many species
could travel that quickly, especially
when presented with freeways and cities
to cross.
Would this warming cause mankind
to flourish? This is the part that made
me ask if Moore was kidding. We have
fuzzy jackets and central heating, we live
in controlled environments and for most
of the world's business, heat isn't the
limiting nutrient. (Again, I'm making
this up, but it seems to make sense.) Are
people in the tropics better off than peo
ple at the mid-latitudes?
Seriously, though, I doubt that Moore
is crazy — just too intent on making
sure he's challenging prevailing dogma.
Then again, maybe he is crazy.
