# Limits to tenure extension revised by Faculty Senate
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
The Faculty Sen
ate voted yesterday
to remove the "two
child limit" on the
number of tenure
extensions a female
professor can take.
Although the
senate quickly ap
proved a recom-

mendation by the Ad Hoc Committee
on the Professoriate to remove the
limit, a related recommendation that
would have capped the total tenure pro
bation time at 10years was withdrawn.
Faculty members must work for the
University for at least seven years,
serving a "probationary" period, before
they can acquire tenure.
Currently, female professors who
are on tenure track are granted a one

year extension per pregnancy, but only
two are allowed over the probation pe
riod, which lasts a minimum of seven
years.
In October 1994, Provost Con
doleezza Rice asked the Steering Com
mittee of the Academic Council to re
view certain faculty policy issues, and
the ad hoc committee was formed a few
months later.
Walter Falcon, ad hoc committee
chair, said the committee felt the limit
to two extensions due to maternity was
an intrusive policy.
The recommendation for the 10-
vear cap was eventually withdrawn
after senate members expressed con
cern over special circumstances that
might further lengthen the probation
period.
English Prof. John Bender raised
the issue of how tenure extensions

would be handled in case of extreme
disabilities.
Senior Assoc. Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences John Etchemendy
argued another problem with the
recommendation is that it would be
somewhat superfluous.
"You don't see too many un
needed tenure extensions," he said.
"Not very many people are 14, even
20 years past their Ph.D. and sud
denly popping up for tenure."
Rice said the two recommenda
tions are linked, but not closely.
The senate accepted her suggestion
to withdraw the recommendation
and add an escape clause which
would provide for exceptions.
In other business, the senate
voted to change the structure of the
research professoriate.
The senate approved the com
mittee's recommendation to form a

new line for research faculty to fol
low. Assistant research professors
can now be promoted to the posi
tion of associate research professor
and can then be promoted to full re
search professor.
During debate, Philosophy Prof.
Michael Bratman raised the issue
of the need for a wider search for
faculty to fill positions in this new
line. "This will be a new line," said
Bratman. "The search must be a
full one."
Rice explained that under the
previous policy, it was difficult to
hire the best recruits because they
would be forced to leave after six
years, regardless of performance.
Current policy prohibits the promo
tion of research faculty.
"In the earlier process, we had a
number of inside candidates," said
Rice. "We did not do a wide-open
search."
Now that promotion is open to
research professors, senators said,
they hope retention will be higher,
and it will be easier to bring quali

fled faculty to the University.
The last committee recommen
dation the senate approved broad
ens the range of University faculty
eligible to be principal investigators
for research.
Principal investigators — cur
rently defined as members of the
Academic Council who direct grant
research — do not include Medical
Center line faculty. The senate
voted to have the dean of the Med
ical School review the policy.
University President Gerhard
Casper questioned the necessity of
only allowing members of the Acad
emic Council to serve as principal
investigators.
"It is a restrictive rule," Casper
said. "If there are other people who
are qualified to lead, who are we to
say they can't?"
"The University does research
in relation to teaching and publica
tions," Bender agreed. "We are un
like a research institute — the line
we must maintain is between uni
versity and research institution."
