# Official clarifies facts on endowment returns
## 
### 
We at Stanford Management Company
are pleased by The Daily's interest in the
recent returns on the University's endow
ment as evidenced by Wednesday's article.
Since your staff writer and I had time for
only a brief conversation, I thought I might
provide a few clarifications.
Stanford's investment return for the
year ending June 30 (which conforms to
the fiscal year reported on by other univer
sities) was 16.2 percent, comparing favor
ably with the 15.5 percent average reported
for 394 institutions by The Chronicle of
Higher Education. Stanford's ten-year
compound annual return of 13.5 percent
also outpaced the 11.6 percent average
return of other universities and colleges.
Using a broader definition of endow-

ment than The Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion's, Stanford's endowment figures for
the fiscal year ending last August grew
from $3,035 billion to $3,403 billion, an
increase of 12.1 percent. Accounting for the
net increase of $368 million were the pay
out of $155 million to support University
teaching and research, an inflow of $97
million from gifts and other additions, and
a total investment return of $426 million.
Quite a good year for Stanford.
For those interested in a more detailed
explanation of endowment activity, the
recently published Stanford Annual Finan
cial Report is an excellent source. Any read
