# Historian Schlesinger displeased with headline
## 
### 
The Feb. 9 Daily headline "Schlesinger
decries multiculturalism" would have been
more accurate if it had read "Schlesinger
decries militant multiculturalism."
As I tried to make clear in my remarks,
I am all for multiculturalism when it
means the recognition of the roles, view
points, achievements and tragedies of
minorities. The multicultural challenge
has greatly enriched American history. I
do, however, decry militant ideological
multiculturalism that goes in for "feel
good" history in the hope of helping
minority self-esteem and that seeks to pro
mote and perpetuate separate ethnic and
racial communities.
