## Equality with separation ? 
### 
IS AMERICA MOVING toward equal
but separate? Some might argue
about progress toward equality, but
separation seems to be becoming more of
a reality as well.
Last week, there was a discussion on the
radio about issues facing the community
and the topic turned to race. There were
panelists from different parts of the com
munity represented, including someone
from a professional football team. This per
son said that while all of the players got
along and were able to work well together
on the field, off the field there was very lit
tle interracial socializing. He went on to say
that a request for people to voluntarily
room with someone of a different race was
not enthusiastically embraced. There was a
real sense that integration, in that context,
could only go so far.
Students in the Business School have
expressed concern over and are looking
for remedies to the tendency for groups
to separate into American and foreign
students as well as along racial lines. It
seems that if we ever get to equality, we
may still be separate.
This was undoubtedly not what the
architects of integration had in mind. My
dictionary lists as the third definition of
integration as "to remove the legal and
social barriers imposing segregation upon
racial groups so as to permit free and equal
association." And that process is and needs
to be ongoing. However, the first definition

of integrate is "to make whole or complete
by adding or bringing together parts; to
unify," and it appears that progress in that
area may be stalled.
There is a reason that this separation
takes place: It is easier. It is easier to inter
act with people who are similar to our
selves. There is less to explain, less to learn,
fewer uncomfortable moments, less uncer
tainty. Explaining may mean evaluating
oneself, evaluating may mean discovering
that there are other ways of doing and
being. In a society where everything is right
or wrong, the discovery of something differ
ent which is not wrong means that the orig
inal is wrong by default.
A man called into the radio program and
explained that blacks and whites socialize
separately because blacks were tired of
going to white America. He said that blacks
have participated in the mainstream party
and would now like to party on our own
terms. I believe that there is often a level of
relaxation that minorities of all types can
only achieve in the comfort of our own com
pany, that is not possible in mixed gather
ings, particularly when the mix is uneven,
as is often the case.
Think about a time when you have been
in the minority at a gathering. Depending
upon the others at the gathering, and I'm
referring more to personalities — social
skills than race, though race can be a factor
— it could have been a pretty uncomfort
able experience. And most minorities have

to deal with this all of the time, at one level
or another, and make an effort to fit in. So
the facility of being around people with
whom one does not have to make that
effort is a welcome relief.
While I like to think that the separation
isn't inevitable, my personal experience has
confirmed what I've been hearing. When I
had gatherings that were mixed evenly, the
races tended to separate. When I had gath
erings that were skewed, in any direction,
there was more interaction. So, can we
move forward as a whole while remaining
separate?
I believe it will not be possible to get to
the "equal" part while maintaining the
"separate" part. I socialize with people
(time permitting) because they make me
laugh and think, and I (hopefully) have the
same effect on them. I relish the opportuni
ty to learn of other customs and cultures
and to share with others aspects of my own.
By interacting with people different from
myself, I can better appreciate facets of
myself and my culture that I might not oth
erwise examine without the juxtaposition
of something different. These interactions,
in addition to being entertaining, provide
me with food for thought and growth.
