# Allison Amend: The better part of valor
## Seeking the ideal professor: What shall ye find? 
### 
SO WHAT DO your professors look
like? And I don't mean to ask you if
they're dreamy or scruggly, well
dressed or looking like Superman after a
quick phone booth change back into
Clark. Nor do I want to know the color of
their hair or their height and weight.
I want to know what they look like.
My professors look like me, which
means they are Caucasian, Jewish (some)
and come from upper-middle-class mid
western homes.
Which is great.
Which means they cancel class for such
national holidays as Yom Kippur and real
ly great episodes of "Upstairs Down
stairs." They have a working knowledge
of wines (both Californian and French)
and posters on their office walls celebrat
ing conferences they've attended in
Salzburg or Brussels.
Which is fine.
But maybe my professors don't look
like you. Maybe you're one of the 44 per
cent of students at this university who
isn't Caucasian.
Granted, this university (perhaps more
than some) is making concessions and

overtures to hire minority faculty. But
are looks enough?
So maybe they should hire faculty who
teach issues minority students are inter
ested in. Does the University then need to
tailor its hiring to individual factions and
groups of students? Just because I want a
class on Samuel Beckett's "Language of
Exile" (which just, hap
pens to be my thesis topic) doesn't mean
that the class would have a wide appeal;
nor should the University cater to my spe
cialized interests. A good professor should
be able to teach a wide variety of students.
So maybe they should hire faculty who
teach classes about minority issues,
which seems to be the solution most
humanities departments on campus have
chosen. These "new hires" have become
the most popular professors, if their
crowded office hours, full advising slates
and appointments to committees function
as proof.
I sense a rift in some departments,
between the new (young) cultural studies
professors and the "old school" unwilling
or unsuccessfully attempting to alter
their syllabi to be more like "those ethnic

studies classes." The attitude seems to be,
"We've hired those minority appoint
ments, now let's get back to business."
Not that I can't see their side. Like it or
not, these venerated books and authors
that are part of the "canon" (is this a four
letter word now?) have shaped and there
fore form an integral part of our society;
an understanding of and exposure to
them is necessary to be a participating
member of the world. Not to mention the
fact that they are good books.
And part of it is fear. If you revise stan
dards for judging works to include "non
traditional" novels and narratives, you
run the same risk as punching a hole in
Hoover Dam: once the flood gates are
open, all of Las Vegas, with its Lights and
whistles and bells, is in danger.
There may be solutions, but it seems
necessary to invoke those old adages: no
solution is perfect; you can't please all of
the people all of the time; dissension is the
better part of valor. I can't speak for other
departments on campus, but from this
Comparative Literature major / Chicken
Little's point of view, the sky is falling.
We're left with the phenomenological

theory of faculty appointments. That is,
there is the professor who is the mean of
both students and the university's expec
tations. And then there is the "meta-pro
fessor" or the "ideal professor" who is the
marriage of student expectations (i.e.
young, doesn't speak in postmodern jar
gon, attends faculty dinners in dorms and
possibly Res Ed residence based events,
teaches books we want to read, etc.) and
faculty standards (publishes books, gives
talks regularly using that same postmod
ern jargon, speaks equally as intelligently
about Chaucer and Terry McMillan,
knows J. Hillis Miller and Judith Butler).
It sounds like a musical: searching
high and low for that perfect someone.
Which reminds me of one of my first
professors at Stanford, whom I saw in
the beginning of my freshman year at
Rosh Hashanah services. Office hours
were interesting; we played Jewish
Geography â€” "Do you know the Lips
chitzes in Lake Forest?" and she seemed
thrilled with my proposed research topic:
an in-depth report on Richard Rogers (of
Rogers and Hammerstein fame). While
only slightly less titillating than my

Asian-American peer's paper on why
Robert Mapplethorpe's photography is
art and why, legally, the NEA must
therefore donate funds to him, sure
enough, I received an A. Maybe I got
graded on class participation.
So what'll we do? Too bad we don't
have the resources to adopt Joseph
Heller's "Catch-22" catch-phrase, "Buy
high, sell low and make it up on volume."
Or hire one of those kids (once they've
gone to graduate school, of course) from
that new sci-fi show "Generation X"
whose arms can stretch wide enough to
embrace everyone on campus and whose
extraordinary mental faculties include
the power to empathize with everyone,
students and faculty included?
Until then, I'll invoke Rogers' col
league Ira Gershwin, though I'm pretty
sure he wasn't talking about minority fac
ulty appointments, exactly. . . Still
we're often told, 'seek and ye shall find'.
So I'm looking for that certain lad |lass 1 I
have in mind."
