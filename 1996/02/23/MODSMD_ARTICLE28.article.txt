Stanford 87

PULLMAN, Wash. - After
shooting l-of-18 from three-point
range the first time Washington
State and the Cardinal met, the
Stanford women's basketball team
expected to improve. But nobody
was counting on a Pacific 10 Con
ference record 14 threes, as No. 4
Stanford (21-2, 14-0 Pac-10) rolled
over the slumping Cougars (15-9,
6-7) before 1,005 at Friel Court.
"Our half court execution was
maybe our best of the season," said
Stanford head coach Amy Tucker.
"It seemed like everyone was mak
ing the extra pass."
The Cardinal's 15th-consecu
tive victory matched last year's
longest streak and the third-best
run in school history and clinched a
tie for the Cardinal's seventh Pac
-10 title. Runner-up Oregon State
(18-5, 10-4) has lost twice to Stan
ford this year, but Washington
State has done so every year — 22
straight times.
Stanford wasted little time ex
ploiting the Cougars' 2-3 zone.
After three two-pointers to start
the game, the Cardinal's next five
baskets came outside the arc from
the hands of either junior forward
Kate Starbird or sophomore for
ward Vanessa Nygaard. Still, the

Kate Starbird and her Cardinal teammates demolished Washington
State last night 87-63.
63-28 as Washington State commit
ted turnover after turnover.
Stanford tied a school record for
threes in a half with eight before the
break, including a career-high
tying two from junior guard
Charmin Smith, who entered the
game firing threes at an 18.5 per
cent clip.
Washington State enjoyed a 15-2
run midway through the second
half, but after two free throws from
sophomore forward Naomi Muli
tauaopele, Nygaard calmly swished
her sixth three to tie the Stanford
single-game team standard of 12.
Most of the threes came from the
same spots on the left and right
wings against coach Harold
Rhodes' 2-3 zone.
"Tonight we saw how good Stan
ford can be," said Rhodes, who has
endured more conference losses
than any other coach. "In our
matchup zone it seemed they al

ways found the open player. We
thought we could get them if they
shot a poor percentage."
With the contest well in hand,
sophomore guard Regan Freuen
from nearby Spokane pleased the
home contingent. The seldom-used
Freuen demonstrated her increased
quickness by driving the left base
line for a three-point play and hit
ting two free throws. Still, the Car
dinal needed another three to tie
California's record of 13, set last
Dec. 1 versus. Long Beach State.
Never shy about shooting, se
nior Amy Wustefeld entered the
game and missed her first chance
but not her second, as her second
three of the year tied the standard
with 2:30 remaining. After Wuste
feld hit a driving pull-up from
straight-away to tie her career
high, Freuen matched hers and
eclipsed the Pac-10 mark with an
open three from the right wing,
Stanford's final points.
Nygaard and Starbird shared
high-scoring honors with 20, and
while Nygaard was held to a season
low two rebounds, her six threes

gave her 60 on the season, just 14
shy of 1993 graduate Molly Good
enbour's single-campaign record of
74, established in her senior year.
Starbird enjoyed a stellar all
around contest with a team-high
seven assists, four rebounds and
two steals. Scott and Mulitauaopele
added double-figure scoring totals
with 10 apiece.
Washington State suffered
through 27 turnovers and 37.3 per
cent shooting from the floor. Senior
All-Pac-10 certainty Jenni Ruff led
the way with 19 points and seven
rebounds, both below her season
average. She and the Cougars were
helped by a barrage of free throws
after the game was decided, but the
Cardinal missed a season-low two
free throws in 19 attempts.
While Stanford has never lost to
the Cougars, Seattle has not been so
kind. The always-tough Huskies
(14-10,8-5), easy winners last night
against last-place California (5-18,
1-13), have taken two of the last
three from the Cardinal in Hec Ed
mundson Pavilion, where they have
won well over 80 percent of the time.

PULLMAN, Wash. - After
shooting l-of-18 from three-point
range the first time Washington
State and the Cardinal met, the
Stanford women's basketball team
expected to improve. But nobody
was counting on a Pacific 10 Con
ference record 14 threes, as No. 4
Stanford (21-2, 14-0 Pac-10) rolled
over the slumping Cougars (15-9,
6-7) before 1,005 at Friel Court.
"Our half court execution was
maybe our best of the season," said
Stanford head coach Amy Tucker.
"It seemed like everyone was mak
ing the extra pass."
The Cardinal's 15th-consecu
tive victory matched last year's
longest streak and the third-best
run in school history and clinched a
tie for the Cardinal's seventh Pac
-10 title. Runner-up Oregon State
(18-5, 10-4) has lost twice to Stan
ford this year, but Washington
State has done so every year — 22
straight times.
Stanford wasted little time ex
ploiting the Cougars' 2-3 zone.
After three two-pointers to start
the game, the Cardinal's next five
baskets came outside the arc from
the hands of either junior forward
Kate Starbird or sophomore for
ward Vanessa Nygaard. Still, the
Cardinal led just 24-22 with seven
minutes to play in the first half.

Kate Starbird and her Cardinal teammates demolished Washington
State last night 87-63.
63-28 as Washington State commit
ted turnover after turnover.
Stanford tied a school record for
threes in a half with eight before the
break, including a career-high
tying two from junior guard
Charmin Smith, who entered the
game firing threes at an 18.5 per
cent clip.
Washington State enjoyed a 15-2
run midway through the second
half, but after two free throws from
sophomore forward Naomi Muli
tauaopele, Nygaard calmly swished
her sixth three to tie the Stanford
single-game team standard of 12.
Most of the threes came from the
same spots on the left and right
wings against coach Harold
Rhodes' 2-3 zone.
"Tonight we saw how good Stan
ford can be," said Rhodes, who has
endured more conference losses
than any other coach. "In our
matchup zone it seemed they al

ways found the open player. We
thought we could get them if they
shot a poor percentage."
With the contest well in hand,
sophomore guard Regan Freuen
from nearby Spokane pleased the
home contingent. The seldom-used
Freuen demonstrated her increased
quickness by driving the left base
line for a three-point play and hit
ting two free throws. Still, the Car
dinal needed another three to tie
California's record of 13, set last
Dec. 1 versus. Long Beach State.
Never shy about shooting, se
nior Amy Wustefeld entered the
game and missed her first chance
but not her second, as her second
three of the year tied the standard
with 2:30 remaining. After Wuste
feld hit a driving pull-up from
straight-away to tie her career
high, Freuen matched hers and
eclipsed the Pac-10 mark with an
open three from the right wing,
Stanford's final points.
Nygaard and Starbird shared
high-scoring honors with 20, and
while Nygaard was held to a season
low two rebounds, her six threes

gave her 60 on the season, just 14
shy of 1993 graduate Molly Good
enbour's single-campaign record of
74, established in her senior year.
Starbird enjoyed a stellar all
around contest with a team-high
seven assists, four rebounds and
two steals. Scott and Mulitauaopele
added double-figure scoring totals
with 10 apiece.
Washington State suffered
through 27 turnovers and 37.3 per
cent shooting from the floor. Senior
All-Pac-10 certainty Jenni Ruff led
the way with 19 points and seven
rebounds, both below her season
average. She and the Cougars were
helped by a barrage of free throws
after the game was decided, but the
Cardinal missed a season-low two
free throws in 19 attempts.
While Stanford has never lost to
the Cougars, Seattle has not been so
kind. The always-tough Huskies
(14-10,8-5), easy winners last night
against last-place California (5-18,
1-13), have taken two of the last
three from the Cardinal in Hec Ed
mundson Pavilion, where they have
won well over 80 percent of the time.
