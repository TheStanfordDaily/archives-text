## Cardinal tons the Cougars

Stanford 87
Washington St. 63

PULLMAN, Wash. - After
shooting l-of-18 from three-point
range the first time Washington
State and the Cardinal met, the
Stanford women's basketball team
expected to improve. But nobody
was counting on a Pacific 10 Con
ference record 14 threes, as No. 4
Stanford (21-2, 14-0 Pac-10) rolled
over the slumping Cougars (15-9,
6-7) before 1,005 at Friel Court.
"Our half court execution was
maybe our best of the season," said
Stanford head coach Amy Tucker.
"It seemed like everyone was mak
ing the extra pass."
The Cardinal's 15th-consecu
tive victory matched last year's
longest streak and the third-best
run in school history and clinched a
tie for the Cardinal's seventh Pac
-10 title. Runner-up Oregon State
(18-5, 10-4) has lost twice to Stan
ford this year, but Washington
State has done so every year — 22
straight times.
Stanford wasted little time ex
ploiting the Cougars' 2-3 zone.
After three two-pointers to start
the game, the Cardinal's next five
baskets came outside the arc from
the hands of either junior forward
Kate Starbird or sophomore for
ward Vanessa Nygaard. Still, the
Cardinal led just 24-22 with seven
minutes to play in the first half.
But a 39-6 run over the next 13
minutes pushed the advantage to
