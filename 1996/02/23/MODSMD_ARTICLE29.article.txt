# Baseball enters Six-Pac play
## No. 5 Stanford to battle sixth-ranked Bruins 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
After finishing its preseason,
non-conference schedule with a 9-
5 record, the Stanford baseball
team begins play in the rough Pa
cific 10 Southern Division this
weekend, with a three-game se
ries at UCLA.
The Cardinal started the sea
son ranked No. 2 in both major
polls, but have since fallen to No.
5 in Baseball America and No. 11
in Collegiate Baseball. The Bru
ins (9-4) are currently ranked No.
6 by Baseball America and No. 13
by Collegiate Baseball.
The strength of the Six-Pac is
reflected in the current sets of na
tional rankings — five of the six
teams are in the top 12 of the
Baseball America poll and the top
17 of the Collegiate Baseball rat
ings. Cardinal coach Mark Mar
quess does not expect such lofty
positions for all six teams once
