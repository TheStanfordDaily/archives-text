# Baseball enters Six-Pac play
## No. 5 Stanford to battle sixth-ranked Bruins 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
After finishing its preseason,
non-conference schedule with a 9-
5 record, the Stanford baseball
team begins play in the rough Pa
cific 10 Southern Division this
weekend, with a three-game se
ries at UCLA.
The Cardinal started the sea
son ranked No. 2 in both major
polls, but have since fallen to No.
5 in Baseball America and No. 11
in Collegiate Baseball. The Bru
ins (9-4) are currently ranked No.
6 by Baseball America and No. 13
by Collegiate Baseball.
The strength of the Six-Pac is
reflected in the current sets of na
tional rankings — five of the six
teams are in the top 12 of the
Baseball America poll and the top
17 of the Collegiate Baseball rat
ings. Cardinal coach Mark Mar
quess does not expect such lofty
positions for all six teams once

league play starts.
"In a month, you'll see one team
there [in the top 101," said Mar
quess, who picked UCLA to win
the Six-Pac crown. "There is no
question this league is as strong as
it has ever been in my 20 years
here. I'd be surprised if one team
runs away with the league title."
In non-conference play this
season, the Cardinal faced only
one team, No. 1 Cal State-Fuller
ton, that can compare to the type
of competition Stanford will face
every weekend in the Six-Pac. The
Cardinal split two games with the
Titans and, overall, pleased Mar
quess with its early season perfor
mance.
"In evaluating the season so
far, in hindsight, we had a pretty
good preseason," Marquess said.
"In four weekend series, we won
three on the road and split with
Fullerton at home. We did a good
job, especially because in two of

those series we lost the first game
and were able to come back to take
the next two."
Sophomore Jon SchaefTer, who
started the season as the designat
ed hitter before recently taking
over the catching duties, pointed to
the resiliency of the Cardinal squad
as a strength up to this point.
"To win all of our series is im
portant for us," Schaeffer said.
"Going into league play, that helps
as far as our confidence level."
Another team strength which
should allow Schaeffer and the
rest of his teammates to remain
confident has been the consisten
cy of the pitching staff. Stanford is
holding its opponents to a .234
batting average and has recorded
115 strikeouts in 122 innings.
Freshman Jeff Austin (2-1),
who was named Pac-10 Pitcher of
the Week last week, leads the staff
with an earned run average of 0.78
in 23 innings pitched. Austin's 34
strikeouts lead the conference.
While Marquess expressed sat
isfaction with the pitching, he ad
mitted that the consistency of the
offense needs to be improved.

"The pitching has given us a
chance to win games," Marquess
said. "If there is one disappoint
ment, it is the offense. We haven't
been consistent — some games we
hit well, others not at all."
The Cardinal lineup should get
a boost this weekend with the re
turn of Ail-American A.J. Hinch.
Hinch has missed five games with
a bruised right shoulder, injured
Feb. 10 against Santa Clara. At
the time, the catcher was leading
Stanford with a .412 average and
three home runs. Marquess called
Hinch's status day-to-day, but ex
pects him to fill the DH spot if he is
able to compete.
Marquess will send sophomore
Kyle Peterson (2-2) to the mound
tonight, Austin on Saturday, and
freshman Chad Hutchinson (0-1)
on Sunday.
"It is important to start off well
in the league," said Schaeffer,
whose 12 RBIs lead the Cardinal.
"Obviously, we want to win all
three games — we want to com
pete as well as we can. The league
is so tough, it's important to get
victories on the road."
