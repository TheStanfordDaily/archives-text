# Senate OK's review of TA status and training
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
After almost nine years without an ex
amination, Stanford's teaching assistant
program will undergo a thorough review
beginning this spring.
At its meeting yesterday, the Faculty
Senate approved a request from the ASSU
to evaluate TA "status and training." The
last review of TAs occurred in the 1987-88
academic year.
ASSU graduate senator Doug Natelson
introduced the request.
"In the intervening time, the financial
situation of graduate students has
come into jeopardy," said Natelson.
"More professors will be relying on
TAs for support, and training will
have to be examined."
Compensation and training for
TAs are among the areas that may
be examined.
Natelson said TA policy has
changed despite the kick of an eval

uation of the program. TAs in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
have also come under more pres
sure recently, as section sizes were
increased by 10 percent this year.
Natelson said it is time for the
senate to look at what has worked
and what has actually been imple
mented since the 1987 review.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven said he support
ed the bill. "I definitely approve of
this charge," said Shoven. "It is
time for us to look at TA status and
effectiveness."

University President Gerhard
Casper also said he supported the
request. "In 1991, we didn't have
the time or the resources to do a
conclusive review," Casper said. "I
urge you to take this seriously."
The request passed unanimous
ly-
Council of Presidents member
Rich Stolz said he was pleased that
the senate approved the request to
coordinate a review effort.
"It's a small step," Stolz said.
"But it's no small accomplish
ment."
