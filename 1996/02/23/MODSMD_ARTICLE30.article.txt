# Home cooking for gymnasts
## Men compete in first home meet of season 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
This Saturday, the Stanford men's
gymnastics team (6-1-0) will compete
against San Jose State for the third time
this season, but with the added competi
tion of Santa Barbara thrown in. The
meet begins at 7 p.m. in Burnham Pavil
ion
Stanford has soundly defeated San
Jose each time they have met, trouncing
the Spartans by 19 points during their
first meet and by 23 points the second
time around. Additionally, Stanford also
faced the Gauchos in its first competition
at San Jose State. Stanford scored a total
of 220.45 points to Santa Barbara's
203.05.
The Cardinal squad, however, will be a

different team for the remainder of the
season because of the absence of sopho
more all-arounder Tim Dalrymple. Two
weeks ago, Dalrymple fractured two ver
tebrae in a fall off of the high bar during
warm-ups before the team's last competi
tion at San Jose. He underwent surgeiy
last week and will redshirt this season.
The injury effectively strips the team of
one of its top all-arounders and put Dal
rymple's Olympic hopes off until the year
2000.
"If anything, this weekend will be an
other test of how we are mentally —
everyone wants to do well," said junior
lan Bachrach. "We're working on team
unity. We're all trying to pull for each
other now. It's more of a team effort
rather than the individual."
The team must now struggle to
fill the hole that Dairymple's ab
sence will cause. Six competitors

from each team are allowed in each
event, the top four scores are tallied
for the total team score.
The team now has only two solid
all-arounders in juniors Jamie Ellis
and Keith Wiley. Previously, head
coach Sadao Hamada had com
mented on the team's need for one
of the other gymnasts to come up

and post the fourth big score. Now
the team will need two gymnasts to
take their performances up a notch.
"Before, we had four guys in
each category and one or two back
ups as a safety net. Those two guys
now have to step up — we don't
have that safety net," said sopho
more Jeremy Herman.

At San Jose State two weeks ago,
the team competed in five events
without Dalrymple. Only four
Stanford gymnasts competed in the
vault.
This is the team's first home
competition of the year, thus it is
important for the team to post a big
score.
