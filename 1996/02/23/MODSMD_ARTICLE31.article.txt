# Women to take on unranked Gauchos
## 
### Keith Rabkin Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's gymnastics
team is ready to rebound from its devas
tating loss to Georgia when it takes on
Washington and UC-Santa Barbara this
weekend.
The 13th-ranked Cardinal (1-3 overall,
0-2 Pacific 10 Conference) will challenge
the Huskies on Friday in Seattle. The
15th-ranked Huskies are 8-3 this season
after losing to Pac-10 rival UCLA last
weekend.
After doing battle with its Pac-10 rival,
the Cardinal will fly home to face the un
ranked Gauchos in Burnham Pavilion on

Sunday. The Gauchos are 3-5 this season
and are recuperating from losses to both
Washington and UCLA.
Although the Washington gymnasts
boast an outstanding record, they will
have to throw everything they have
against the Cardinal. Stanford has been
performing well of late, having set a num
ber of school records at the Georgia meet.
This Pac-10 clash could make or break the
Cardinal's season, a victory against the
Huskies could vault Stanford into con
tention for the conference title.
Washington head coach Bob Levesque
will be relying heavily on the perfor-
mances of Klara Kudilkova and
Tiffany Simpson in Friday's meet.
Kudilkova and Simpson are the
Huskies' top performers this sea
son, tied with an all-around score of
39.325. The duo was outstanding
against UCI.A and promises to chal

lenge the Cardinal this weekend.
While no Cardinal can boast an
all-around score as high as
Kudilkova's or Simpson's, the
squad does have depth. Coming off
a strong performance in Georgia,
Stanford will try to break the team
records it set last weekend. Head
coach Lisa Izzi will be relying on
top performers Amy Murakami,
Keri Monahan, Tracey Kohl and
Misty Moore.

Murakami put up Stanford's
best numbers last meet with an all
around score of 38.85. Monahan
has consistently been one of Stan
ford's top three all-around per
formers this season and set a team
record last weekend with a 9.925 on
the vault. Kohl will also add some
vigor to the team as she improves
the team's bar, vault and floor per
formances. Moore will provide the
strength for the floor exercise.

Randy Lane's Gauchos will have
some trouble matchingup against a
ranked opponent like Stanford.
Holding on to fourth place in the
Big West Conference, UCSB has
not beaten a team with t he strength
and depth of the Cardinal. Howev
er, team leader Margie Hoessler will
try to lead the Gauchos to victory.
After losing last weekend to both
the Bruins and the Huskies, the
Gauchos will be anxious for a win.
