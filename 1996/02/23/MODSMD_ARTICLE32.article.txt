# Men in late-season slump

The Washington State team
expected to challenge for the con
ference title showed up last night
at Maples Pavilion. Too bad the
No. 24 Stanford team failed to do
the same.
Despite the Cardinal's lacklus
ter effort, Stanford was still in a
position to win the game in the
end. Tied at 56 with 2 minutes, 38
seconds to play, a three-point shot
by Isaac Fontaine with just six
seconds left on the 35-second
clock gave Washington State the
lead for good. Converting foul
shots and tip-ins, the Cougars
pushed the score out to a less-re
spectable 68-59 final.
The loss snapped Stanford's
14-game home winning streak
and dropped the Cardinal into a
tie for third in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. Stanford (16-7 overall, 9-
5 Pac-10) has now lost two games
in a row and is faced with the chal
lange of avoiding a late-season col
lapse similar to the one that al
most kept it from the NCAA tour
nament last year.
Washington State (14-8, 6-7)
won its fifth game in a row.
"We didn't come out ready to
play," said senior David Harbour.
"We felt like we were at home and
we were invincible."
Mark Hendrickson seemed to
have no lingering problems with
his injured hand as he led all scor
ers with 22 points. His 9-for-12
shooting, mostly on dunks and
lay-ins, was indicative of the
Cougars' inside dominance.
Washington State shot 60 percent
for the game, the highest total the
Cardinal had given up all year.
Stanford managed only 33 per
cent from the field.

"A team shoots 60s and we
shoot 30s and we're just not going
to win," Harbour said, who led
Stanford with 18 points.
Harbour was the only consis
tent offensive threat for the Car
dinal all night, making seven of 12

shots. Dion Cross and Brevin
Knight combined to shoot 7-for
-26 and had 10 turnovers.
But despite the hideous shoot
ing numbers, Stanford was still in

it down the stretch. Fontaine's
three-pointer was all the more frus
trating because Stanford knew ex
actly where he was going but could
do little to stop him
"Hendrickson set the best
screens all night," Harbour said.
"He just got me and I couldn't get
off him and they got the shot off. I
knew exactly where he was going."
"We got beat and we deserved to
get beat," head coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "They screened us all
over the place, beat us on the boards
and we shot poorly."

A held ball with 55 seconds gave
the ball back to Stanford down GI
ST, but Cross threw the ball away
on the inbounds pass. A tip-in by
Hendrickson after Fontaine missed
the front end of a one-and-one with
49 seconds left in the game symbol
ized Stanford's difficulties.
"They got the big baskets when
they needed big baskets, and we
didn't make them," Montgomery
said. "We knew this was going to be
a tough one. They were very physi
cal and we couldn't answer the
bell."
Stanford once again started
sluggishly, watching the Cougars
build as large as a nine-point first
half lead. An open-court steal and
lay-in by Brevin Knight knotted the
score at 28 with 1:35 to play, but
Washington State went into half
time with a 30-28 lead.
"We have to have what we call
big reasons to play or we come out
flat," Cougar head coach Kevin
Eastman said. "Our reason was to
beat a top-25 team."
Speaking of reasons, Stanford
has plenty to pick from but failed to
show any desire to put away Wash
ington State after losing to Oregon
last Sunday.
Now, the Cardinal has four
games sitting between it and a post
season berth. With three of those on
the road, tomorrow's game against
Washington (14-8, 7-6) becomes as
big as any game this year.
"The writing is on the wall,"
Harbour said. "We have to win at
least two of these four games. I
thought we all knew we had to win
these two [home] games — that's
what blows me away."
Montgomery bristled a bit at
questions about any potential
slump into which the team might
slip.
"Wouldn't be a very good time
for that, would it?" he said. Last
year, Stanford lost both games on
the Oregon road trip before coming
home to win its final two games to
secure the tournament berth.
The Huskies bring in a bit of a
slumping team as well, dropping
four of their last five. Washington is
probably one of the last teams
Montgomery wants to face with his
team shooting poorly, as the
Huskies' defense limits its oppo
nents to 43 percent shooting and 66
points per game.
Tomorrow's game marks the
final home contest for seniors Har
bour, Cross, Andy Poppink and
Darren Allaway. Tip-off is sched
uled for 5:00 p.m.
