The Washington State team
expected to challenge for the con
ference title showed up last night
at Maples Pavilion. Too bad the
No. 24 Stanford team failed to do
the same.
Despite the Cardinal's lacklus
ter effort, Stanford was still in a
position to win the game in the
end. Tied at 56 with 2 minutes, 38
seconds to play, a three-point shot
by Isaac Fontaine with just six
seconds left on the 35-second
clock gave Washington State the
lead for good. Converting foul
shots and tip-ins, the Cougars
pushed the score out to a less-re
spectable 68-59 final.
The loss snapped Stanford's
14-game home winning streak
and dropped the Cardinal into a
tie for third in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. Stanford (16-7 overall, 9-
5 Pac-10) has now lost two games
in a row and is faced with the chal
lange of avoiding a late-season col
lapse similar to the one that al
most kept it from the NCAA tour
nament last year.
Washington State (14-8, 6-7)
won its fifth game in a row.
"We didn't come out ready to
play," said senior David Harbour.
"We felt like we were at home and
we were invincible."
Mark Hendrickson seemed to
have no lingering problems with
his injured hand as he led all scor
ers with 22 points. His 9-for-12
shooting, mostly on dunks and
lay-ins, was indicative of the
Cougars' inside dominance.
Washington State shot 60 percent
for the game, the highest total the
Cardinal had given up all year.
Stanford managed only 33 per
cent from the field.

"A team shoots 60s and we
shoot 30s and we're just not going
to win," Harbour said, who led
Stanford with 18 points.
Harbour was the only consis
tent offensive threat for the Car
dinal all night, making seven of 12

shots. Dion Cross and Brevin
Knight combined to shoot 7-for
-26 and had 10 turnovers.
But despite the hideous shoot
ing numbers, Stanford was still in
