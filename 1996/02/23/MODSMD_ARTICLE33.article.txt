# Numbers don't lie as Stanford shoots 33% from field
## 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Numbers rarely lie, and in last
night's 68-59 loss to Washington
State, 33 and 60 tell the whole
story. The ice-cold Cardinal of
fense converted just one-third of
their field goals while the red-hot
Cougars burned down Maples
Pavilion, shooting 60 percent from
the floor to snap Stanford's 14-
game home winning streak dating
back to last season. Add to those
set of figures the 11 more re
bounds Washington State racked
up— 37 to the Cardinal's 26
boards — and the true math
comes down to how Stanford was
even able to stay so close.
"They beat us on the boards,
and we shoot poorly," said Cardi
nal head coach Mike Montgomery.
"Statistically, if you look at it,

you're trying to figure out how
you 're tied with two minutes to go.
We got outrebounded by 11. We
shoot [33 percent] to their 60.
Those are tough figures."
The Cougar effort was fueled
by forward Mark Hendrickson,
who simply came to play. The 6-
foot-9 senior who missed six
games with a broken hand has re
turned with a vengeance averag
ing 15.9 points and 9.7 rebounds
per game this season. Hendrick
son started the game off with a
bang, driving baseline for the slam
dunk over Cardinal Andy Poppink
to score the game's first points. He
didn't cool off after that either, hit
ting 9-of-12 on the night.
Five of Hendrickson's field
goals were lay-ups. Three were
dunks. He also led Washington
State's charge on the glass with 12
boards and held his counterpart

Poppink to two-of-nine shooting
from the floor. The explosive for
ward's inside domination helped
fuel the Cougars physical play
throughout the game. Hendrick
son's impact was reflected in the
waning moments of the game
when with Washington State up
by four with 51 seconds remain
ing, he muscled in for the put-back
of teammate Isaac Fontaine's
missed free throw.
"With Hendrickson playing
with that kind of force, it's a tough
deal," Montgomery said. "We
physically couldn't handle them."
When Hendrickson wasn't
slamming in points, pulling down
rebounds or putting back misses,
he was setting some massive
screens for his fellow Cougars.
And perhaps no screen was more
massive than the one he set for
Fontaine with two minutes left in
the game and the score tied. Com
ing out of a time out with six sec
onds left on the shot clock, Hen
drickson's screen on guard David
Harbour freed Fontaine, who en
tered the contest hitting 50 percent
of his three-point attempts, for a
game-breaking three-point shot.
"Basically, Hendrickson stepped
out and just set huge screens on me
all night," said Harbour, who drew

the task of sticking to Fontaine. "I
knew exactly where he was going.
Coach diagrammed the play during
the time out. I was on top of him,
but I got beat. I don't know what he
does. He gets me, and I can't get off
him. Next thing I knew, Fontaine
was open for three, and he knocked
it down. Give Ilendrickson credit.
He set a great screen."
With Ilendrickson dominating
the frontcourt, Stanford guards
Brevin Knight and Dion Cross had
to pick up the slack for the Cardinal
to have a chance. That didn't hap
pen.
Billed in the preseason as possi
bly the nation's best backcourt, the

Washington State guard triumver
ate of Shamon Antrum, Donminic
Ellison and Fontaine proved that
three was better than two. Al
though Harbour did lead Stanford
with 18 points, hitting 7-of-12 from
the floor, Cross hit just 2-of-lO for
eight points along with six
turnovers and Knight, despite 14
points, made a dismal 5-of-16 shots.
Cross also had six turnovers to two
assists, and Knight had four give
aways to five dishes.
Meanwhile, the trifecta of
Antrum, Ellison and Fontaine com
bined to shoot 12-of-26, led by
Fontaine's 18 points, to go along
with 13 assists. While Fontaine's 18

points speaks of his play, Antrum
and Ellison's impact was chiefly on
the defensive end against the explo
sive duo of Cross and Knight.
"Isaac and Mark, to the general
public, were the keys to the game,
but they paled in our eyes compared
to Donminic Ellison and Shamon
Antrum because Donminic and
Shamon were the ones who kept on
switching up on David Harbour,
Brevin Knight and Dion Cross,"
said Washington State head coach
Kevin Eastman. "And I thought the
game was won on the defensive side
of the ball for us."
Sixty percent from the field of
fensively doesn't hurt either.
