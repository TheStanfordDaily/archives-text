# No. 4 Cardinal to tangle with No. 3 UCLA
## 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
Two weeks ago, the Stanford men's
basketball team brought you the Mir
acle at Maples against defending na
tional champion UCLA. Could the
fourth-ranked Stanford men's volley
ball team knock ofT the third-ranked
Bruins to produce the Barn Burner at
Burnham tonight?
The Cardinal returns to action
with a pivotal match against Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation rival
and defending national champion
UCLA to start a critical three-match
stretch in its schedule. The 7:00 p.m.
match at Burnham Pavilion will be
followed by road matches at fifth
ranked UC-Santa Barbara on Sunday
afternoon and at sixth-ranked Cal
State-Northridge on Monday night.
"These three individual matches
are no more important than one an
other," said Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves. "However, because it's
three matches in four days, they be
come a real critical series of matches
for us."
Stanford has maintained a "busi
ness as usual" attitude during practice
this week. "The focus has been on im
proving as a team," Nieves said of his
7-1 squad. "We talked about staying
on course and not getting distracted by
a particular upcoming match."
Unfortunately, the team has also
been riddled with a few injuries.
Sophomore opposite Jeff Bender rein
jurcd his back prior to the BYU match
and will sit out. Junior swing hitter
Aaron Garcia is questionable with a
groin injury, while sophomore setter
Tyler Neal is still hobbled by knee
problems. Sophomore middle blocker


Sasha Mitelman â€” Daily file
Freshman Josh Palacios bumps a ball against BYU last weekend. Stanford takes on
UCLA tonight.
Keenan Whitehurst, who sprained
his ankle in last week's win over UC-
Irvine, is probable. Meanwhile, se
nior Brian Moore, who is second on
the team in kills with 121, will play in
spite of a sore foot.
However, other key players are
ready to contribute for the Cardinal,
includingjunior opposite Matt Fuer
bringer and junior setter Stewart
Chong. Fuerbringer has a team
high 139 kills while Chong is third in
the nation in assists, averaging

17.46 a game.
"Fuerbringer [who is recovering
from a shoulder injury] is still on
course," Nievessaid. "Having three
matches in four days will be a step up
in intensity for him."
The third-ranked Bruins come in
for their only regular season match
against the Cardinal with a 5-1
league record and a four-match win
ning streak over Stanford. They also
bring a long-standing tradition of
powerhouse volleyball. Head coach
A 1 Scates, in his 34th season, has
seen his team win 15 national titles
in the last 26 seasons. "We have a
long ways to go before we match
ftheir tradition]," Nieves said. "But

none of that matters tomorrow. I'd
be more worried if we played their
tradition."
Leadingthe way for UCLA are se
nior swing hitter Brian Wells and ju
nior quick hitter Paul Nihipali.
Wells has registered 137 kills in 37
games for a .312 hitting percentage.
Nihipali, a second team All-Ameri
can last season, has put up 128 kills
in 27 games thus far, good for a .323
hitting percentage. Spearheading
the defense for UCLA is sophomore
quick hitter Tom Stillwell. Stillwell
is presently third in the country in
blocks, averaging 1.92 per game.
Redshirt freshman quick hitter
James Turner also is a key contribu

tor, racking up 19 kills in the Bruins'
last match against Loyola Mary
mount.
"The team can go into this match
two ways," said Nieves. "They can
either play [UCLA] for what they're
worth, which is the right way to ap
proach it, or they can play their tra
dition and the 15 teams that won na
tional titles, which is the wrong way
to go at it."
UC-Santa Barbara will provide
another formidable challenge for the
Cardinal spikers on Sunday after
noon. Currently holding a record of
6-2, the Gauchos are early favorites
to return to the Final Four for the
first time since 1988.
