Two weeks ago, the Stanford men's
basketball team brought you the Mir
acle at Maples against defending na
tional champion UCLA. Could the
fourth-ranked Stanford men's volley
ball team knock ofT the third-ranked
Bruins to produce the Barn Burner at
Burnham tonight?
The Cardinal returns to action
with a pivotal match against Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation rival
and defending national champion
UCLA to start a critical three-match
stretch in its schedule. The 7:00 p.m.
match at Burnham Pavilion will be
followed by road matches at fifth
ranked UC-Santa Barbara on Sunday
afternoon and at sixth-ranked Cal
State-Northridge on Monday night.
"These three individual matches
are no more important than one an
other," said Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves. "However, because it's
three matches in four days, they be
come a real critical series of matches
for us."
Stanford has maintained a "busi
ness as usual" attitude during practice
this week. "The focus has been on im
proving as a team," Nieves said of his
7-1 squad. "We talked about staying
on course and not getting distracted by
a particular upcoming match."
Unfortunately, the team has also
been riddled with a few injuries.
Sophomore opposite Jeff Bender rein
jurcd his back prior to the BYU match
and will sit out. Junior swing hitter
Aaron Garcia is questionable with a
groin injury, while sophomore setter
Tyler Neal is still hobbled by knee
problems. Sophomore middle blocker
