### Ratha Harntha Staff writer 
The Stanford women's swim
ming team will try to add two
more athletes to its NCAA team
this weekend at the Stanford In
vitational at deGuerre Pool. The
Cardinal swimmers will also have
the opportunity to qualify for the
U.S. Olympic Trials.
"This is the last chance to
qualify for the NCAAs and the
Olympic Trials," head coach
Richard Quick said. "Five ath
letes will be competing for two
spots [on the NCAA team]."
The Cardinal can take up to 18
athletes — 17 swimmers and one
diver — to the NCAA champi
onships on March 21-23. The
team currently has 15 swimmers
who have qualified. Any swimmer
that makes the qualifying time
will go to the Olympic Trials.
Sophomore Evi-Lynn Byer will
try to qualify in the 200-meter
backstroke for both the Olympic
Trials and the NCAA champi
onships. Sophomores Becky Bick
nell and Michelle Collins are look
ing to lower their times in the 50-
meter freestyle and the 200-meter
breaststroke, respectively. Collins
did not compete at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships last
weekend because of an injury.
According to Quick, junior
Michelle Jesperson may swim
this weekend. Jesperson, a seven
time All-American, has an in

jured shoulder and has not com
peted in the last three weeks. Her
goal this weekend is to qualify for
the Olympic Trials and then
make the NCAA qualifying time
at the trials, Quick added.
There will also be a group of
Cardinal swimmers just seeking
to improve their times. Freshmen
Corie Calfee, Tara Hopwood, Jodi
Jackson, Caroline Palmer and

Chantal Rawn all look to bettor
their times this weekend.
Juniors Jane Kelsey and Kerry
O'Hanlon, and sophomore
Kristin Nyweide will also com
pete this weekend. Kelsey will
race in the 100- and 200-meter
freestyle, O'Hanlon in the 100-
meter backstroke and Nyweide in
the 100- and 200-meter breast
stroke.

Freshman Elin Austevoll, the
Pac-10 champion in the 100- and
200-yard breaststroke, will try to
make the Norwegian Olympic
team.
"[The Stanford Invitational) is
a laid-back deal," senior co-cap
tain Jane Skillman said. "It's for
people who still need to qualify
for the NCAAs. Hopefully, we'll
have some good swims."
