# Synchro squad to host top-ranked Buckeyes

### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
Stanford's synchronized
swimming team is often over
shadowed by the Farm's na
tional-powerhouse women's
swimming and diving squad,
and this weekend is no excep
tion. While the four-time de
fending national champion
swimmers host the 1996 Stan
ford Invitational this weekend,
the synchro team will quietly
take to the water at deGuerre
Pool Saturday afternoon at 1
p.m. in its only home meet of
the season.
What most people don't real
ize, though, is that Saturday's
meet — also dubbed the Stan
ford Invitational — is the single
most important meet of the
year. It features defending na
tional champion Ohio State,
ranked No. 1 in the country,
and the second-ranked Cardi
nal.
"As the defending national
champion, Ohio State has to be
considered the favorite," said
Stanford head coach Vickey
Weir, "but this meet could go
either way. Our team has an in
credible amount of heart, and
in a subjectively-judged sport
like synchro, that could make
all the difference."
If the Cardinal wants to
upset the defending national
champs, it will have to do so
without four members of last
year's runner-up squad. By
comparison, the Buckeyes re
turn their top nine swimmers
from 1995, including five cur
rent or former members of the
U.S. National Team.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal
has hardly lost a step this sea
son after gaining two former
National Team members in
freshman Vanessa Shaw and
junior Lesley Riddervold, a
transfer. The synchro team has
also benefited from the arrival
of freshman Catherine Chen, a
National Age Group champion.
But while the newcomers
bring youth and talent to the

squad, the Cardinal looks to se
nior Ail-American and team co
captain Bridget Finn for lead
ership and experience. Tomor
row, Finn will face her biggest
challenge of the season when
she goes head to head with
Ohio State Ail-American Becky
Jasontek in the solo competi
tion.
In the duet, Chen will team
with senior All-American Julie
Davies — the team's other co-

captain — against the Buck
eyes' Jasontek and National
Team member Emily Marsh.
At last year's national champi
onships, Jasontek and Marsh
eked out a victory over Davies
and departed teammate Jen
Graves.
Stanford enters tomorrow's
meet 2-0 on the season, after
recording a 108-45 victory over
Washington and a 100-42 win
over California. Ohio State is
also 2-0, with dual-meet victo
ries over Michigan and Rich
mond.
"Ohio State should be fa
vored, but the meet is probably
too close to call," said Stanford
assistant coach Andy Maisel.
"If one team gets momentum
going, it could make a huge dif
ference. Our team has a chem
istry that you can't engineer,
but you hope to have. Hopeful
ly it will all come together this
weekend."
Tomorrow's meet will also
feature Pacific 10 Conference
rivals Washington and Cal as
well as St. Mary's College.
Compulsory figures will take
place in the morning, followed
by trio, duet, solo and team rou
tines beginning at 1 p.m.
