# Another Cliffhanger

### 
So I walked into the Bookstore the other day.
True story. I walked into the Bookstore,
and I haven't even gotten past the display
of Howard Stern's new hook when someone
grabs my arm tightly and won't let go. It's a
friend. 1 ler face is red. I ler body is trembling and
her breathing is troubling.
"What's wrong?" 1 asked, taking her hand in
mine and placing my other hand on her shoulder
for empathetic emphasis.
"I'm . . . had," she said. "Very very bad. Very."
"Now what could be sooo bad'.'" I soothed.
"Are you stealing pencils again? Books 9 Return
ing stolen books with an old receipt?"
"No, no, no." she answered. "Though I did
once peel a 'Used' sticker oil an old book and
'used' it to save 15 bucks on a new one."
"Well, that's no crime," I assured her. "If any
thing. those high prices they charge — that's the
crime!" 1 lifted my hand ceiling ward, index fin
ger extended to indicate indignation. "Just give
me the nod, and I 'm on the line with 'Fight Back!
(with David Horowitz). Don't let anybody rip
you off!" Scattered applause erupted from sec
tion 326.
"No. it's nothing like ... I just ... I need ...
I've gotta buy some ( I liffs Notes, okay?"
Silence.
"Oh," I said. "Well, that's not... I mean . .."
"I know! 1 was going to run over to Kepler's. 1
mean, my TA could see me or something!"
Right then as she rambled, 1 knew what she
was feeling. I knew her queasy uneasiness. I felt
her pain. ClifTs Notes were as much an unset
tling part of my past as they were a frightening
prospect of her present. Let's face it, we've all
been there. Cliffs Notes are classics not just
summaries of them.
Come on now, you remember how absolutely
hectic life was in high school. Every so often,

there cl come a time when there just wasn't time.
And Cliff would be waiting. Once or twice, there
were even late nights where I found myself wish
ing for Cliff's Notes to the Gift's Notes! I mean. 48
pages? You call that a sum maty'? Nada. my tosta
da — some of them suckers was l(xxxxmg\
In college now, too, sadly enough, you'll occa
sionally find old Clin', flagrantly feeding our wan
ton weaknesses. As early as fall quarter of fresh
man year, as I can remember. True story. A
friend of mine was heading off to his philosophy
CIV final when I noticed some of his books were
a distinctive school bus-yellow and black.
"Yeah, they said it was open note," he later
told me. "They never said whose notes! My
notes? Your notes? Gift's Notes? I mean, what's
a boy to think?"
Perhaps that case is a little extreme. But if
you think about it, we've all felt the urge to be
unfaithful now and then, even if it's just 'cause
we don't want to re-read something we read in
high school — though thanks to you-know-who
we may never have really "read" it in the first
place! Yes, indeed, it's a very vicious cycle that's
been set cycling by our friend Gift'.
And who the hell is Cliff anyway? I mean, who
is he really?
1 know who he was. He was that kid in the
front row of Miss Brockmeyer's language arts
class who always raised his hand first. He was
that kid who always did the reading. Yessir, from
the first grade on, I'll bet everybody wanted to
borrow Gift's notes. Well, well, well — hv the
time Cliff had his MBA. he was done letting peo
ple borrow his notes. They could buy 'em.
And who can blame him for selling? After all,
you've gotta give Cliff credit. When you've got
kids paying more for your rip-off than the real
thing, you know you've got the market cornered.-
But back to my friend in the Bookstore. Turns

out, her section was that very afternoon. And
what with her community work at the orphan
age and her volunteer fire fighting and all, she
just was not going to get the reading done!
I told her 1 was with her. I was there for her.
Together, we scurried to the racks. As she fran
tically flipped for the titles she needed. I covered
her back. With much bravado, I began telling her
very loudly — that she just wasn't going to
convince me that Shakespeare's comedies were
all that funny — and I didn't care how many
times she'd read them.
When she'd finished, we bolted for the check
out, thanking the Heavenly Parent for no line.
The nice cashier-lady threw us a wry smile upon
seeing our purchase, and reached beneath the
counter for a Special Plain Paper Bag. Like a
wino hiding her whiskey, my friend skimmed her
summaries home and out of sight, the super
bright safety yellow muted behind burlap brown.
And we were off.
"Keep that receipt for your rebate!" the nice
cashier-lady called out.
The doors swished open and we were free. I
ran with my friend as far as the steps, where she
hopped on her bike and was off into the sun. She
waved. 1 smiled.
Just last night, she called, happy and healthy.
Apparently, her section and her guilt are both
history. Yes, she's certainly gotten over Cliff. His
name didn't even come up. So in the end, every
thing turned out okay. Thanks for your concern.
And thanks for reading, too. Hope it wasn't
too long.
