# Students could be dining at Taco Bell by fall quarter
## New eatery planned on campus

The long-awaited addition of services
to Tresidder Union, possibly including
the ever-elusive Taco Bell, might occur as
early as next fall, according to Dean of
Students Marc Wais.
Wais said he and the Tresidder Memo
rial Union Advisory Board are "moving in
due haste" in their efforts to make sure
that "any new food vendor would be in
place by the time fall quarter begins."
Established two years ago by the Of
fice of Student Affairs, the board offers
the dean of students advice on how best to
improve Tresidder's services.
In a Wednesday meeting with Wais
and the board, the Stanford Management
Company — a private firm that handles
some of the University's financial en
deavors, including the Stanford Shop

ping Center — proposed plans to add a
restaurant, either Taco Bell or another
vendor, in a "future reconfiguration of
Tresidder," Wais said..
"We recognize that there is a strong
student desire for Taco Bell, which
means that it is clearly on the table,"
Wais added. "Whether it's Taco Bell or
any other vendor, there are two criteria
that will have to be met. First, the vendor
must provide a low-cost menu. And sec
ond, they must remain open late in the
evening to accommodate student needs
and lifestyles."
In order to make the necessary
changes to accommodate a new restau
rant, Wais said that "major infrastruc
ture work" will need to be done, although
he declined to specify details.
A Taco Bell was originally scheduled to
be constructed in January 1994 but has
been subject to numerous delays.

Several students on the board are well
acquainted with the two-year saga of de
lays to bring Taco Bell to Tresidder, said
board member Michael Meyer, a senior.
This time, however, he said, the group is
committed to bringing change to Tresid
der.
"Why should people believe that
promised changes to Tresidder will actu
ally occur this time? The reason is that we
have a new dean who has made it one of
his top priorities," Meyer said.
"I am very much committed to effect
ing tangible change," Wais said. "I want
those changes to make students, faculty
and staff happier and enhance the quali
ty of their lives."
The board is still in the process of final
izing the list of vendors to be considered
for the bidding process in which the busi-
