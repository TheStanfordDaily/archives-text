# Sluggers try to end four-game skid
## 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The Stanford so ft ball team looks
to open its home season and break a
four-game losing streak today
against Sacramento State. The Car
dinal (6-8 overall, 0-4 in Pac-10) en
ters today's game after disappoint
ing losses last week to California (6-
4 and 4-0) and the University of the
Pacific (3-2 and 2-1).

This is the first-ever matchup
between the two schools, and al
though Stanford has never seen the
Sacramento team, the players look
to today's game with a good idea of
what they are facing. Already this
season, Sacramento split games
with UC-Davis, San Jose State and
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo. Mean
while, the Cardinal took two games
from Davis, split with San Jose and
got rained out of its scheduled game

against Cal Poly. That said, today's
competition should be very close.
Head coach Sandy Pearce is ex
cited about facing another tough
opponent.
"They've split with every team
they've played" Pearce said.
"They're a solid team with good hit
ting, pitching and defense. They're
scoring a lot of runs, and they are
well coached."
The key for Stanford in today's
game will be defense. Both teams
boast excellent pitching staffs
which means the battle is likely to
be won in the field rather than at
the plate. The error-plagued Cardi
nal will need to toughen up defen
sively if they hope to win today's
games. So far this season, the Stan
ford gloves have faltered 19 times in
14 games, at times giving up costly
runs in easy out situations.
Pearce attributes the errors to
lack of experience in the field. "We
have so many new people," she said.
"We have a lot of freshmen and
[older players] in new positions."
The freshmen seem to have
made the adjustment fairly well so
far. The two leading pitchers for the
Cardinal are freshmen Marcy
Crouch and Becky Blevins, while at
the plate first baseman Michelle
Schneider leads all batters with a
.341 average. Crouch also makes
the list of top sluggers with a .289
average — good enough for third
highest on the team.
Stanford will need to take advan
tage of eveiy opportunity it receives
at the plate from Sacramento.
Among the pitching arsenal of the
Hornets are former Ail-American
Tammy Blunt and the currently
undefeated Susie Bugliarello. Both
are tough competitors and will be
looking to silence the Cardinal bats
in today's doubleheader.
At press time, Pearce was not
certain who would get the starting
bids for Stanford, but is very confi
dent in her injury-riddled pitching
staff. Crouch is suffering from pain
in her shoulder, and sophomore
Jessica Schulman is just returning
to top form after suffering a season
ending back injury last year.
"Our pitchers have been doing
well," Pearce said. "Jessica threw a
great game last week and is coming
back from the injury really well."
Pearce also noted that Crouch
and Blevins were likely to see playing
time and felt that the key for her en
tire team right now is improvement.
