# Track and field heads to Reno
## 
### Sam Wang 
As 600 athletes from 11
schools pack their bags and head
for the bright lights of Reno,
Nev., this weekend to compete
in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Championships,
Stanford track and field head
coach Vin Lananna will be look
ing to build on the Cardinal's
fourth-place finishes in last
year's competition.
Lananna is sending a deter
mined group of athletes to the
Biggest Little City in the World.
Expected to stand out fot the
men are milers Mark Fadil, J.J.
White and Jason Lunn along
with junior sprinter Jimmie
Johnson, sophomore thrower
Adam Connolly and pole-vaulter
Chris Buddin. Lananna will also
send a talented pair of jumpers
in the form of junior Brian Man
ning and senior Jami Webb.
On the women's side, Lanan
na once again will turn to the
strength of the team for points.
The standout Cardinal middle
distance contingent is headed by

senior Dena Dey in the mile and
8000 meters, redshirt sopho
more Monal Chokshi in the mile
and the distance medley, sopho
more Sarna Renfro in the 3000
and the 5000 and sophomore Ko
rtney Dunscombe in the 5000.
Also seeking to contribute to
the Cardinal point total are
sophomore thrower Sami Jo
Small and sprinters Heather
Miller and Monica Hoggatt.
"They are the keys, Lananna
said. "They are the ones we'll be
looking to get us the points."
This year's talented freshman
group will no doubt try to grab
the spotlight from their elders
this weekend as 13 members of
the class of 1999 will make up
one-quarter of the team.
Lananna will be depending
on diaper-dandy Mary Cobb to
come through in the mile and
the distance medley and fellow
freshman Tracye Lawyer to per
form double duty in the high
jump and the shot put. Twin
brothers Brent and Brad Hauser
are counted upon heavily to
score in the 5000 meters, as is

Jauron Pigg in the long jump.
When asked about how the
youngsters will stand up to the
pressure of their first champi
onship meet, coach Lananna
said simply, "I think they will do
very well." However, Lananna is
a little more conservative when
questioned about his expecta*
tions on his team's participation
in the MPSF's.
"We view it as a preparatory
for the outdoors. We are going
into this meet to use it as a yard
stick to check where we are in
the season," Lananna said.
"However, we do go into it seri*
ously and we do try to do well in
the meet."
Senior co-captain Hoggatt,
who will be competing in the 400
meters, shares in Lananna's
cautious assessment,
"Every meet is important,"
Hoggatt said. "In every meet
you want to do well, but you
don't want to put more pressure
on yourself because it is a cham
pionship meet. You would want
to run as well as you'd run at any
other meet."
