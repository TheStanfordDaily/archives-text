## Speaker outlines effects of U.S. communications power 
### Joe El Rady Contributing writer 
The changing face of communication has begun to
reshape modern trade and culture, the chairman of a
Canadian communications commission said yesterday.
In a speech in front of 25 people at the Institute for
International Studies, Canadian Radio, Television and
Telecommunication Commission Chairman Keith
Spicer warned against American efforts to override na
tional differences using new international media.
Spicer's chief concern with these changes centered
around the media's effect on nationalism.
"There are forces favoring the nation and national
ism [in Europe], but the forces of technology oppose
this," Spicer said. "The growing numher of channels of
communication favors globalization."
"Technology is the first force that has made people
look beyond the nation, because no single country can
fill in so much content, except for the United States," he
said.
Along with the force created by so many channels, a
competitive market also forces globalization, Spicer
added.
"Competition breaks down national barriers," Spicer
said. "For media companies to compete at home, they
now need to go abroad. This tears down borders, creates
international lobbies and tears down nationalist and
protectionist laws."
However, Spicer was quick to criticize the U.S. gov
ernment for taking too harsh a stance on what he called
"cultural exportation."
"In classical U.S. trade theory, there are goods and
services, but no culture," Spicer said. He explained that
with today's globally linked electronic media outlets,
culture flows much more quickly than goods.
Although countries welcome some American pro
gramming, Spicer maintained that national identity
still needs to be maintained in the media.
"Canada uses a cultural exception," Spicer said. This
means that Canadians try to maintain Canadian pro
gramming on their television, radio and cable outlets.
"This Canadian idea is spreading to Europe and this
worries the U.S. trade office," Spicer said. "Cultural ex
portation will become a more and more explosive issue
with the U.S. trade office."
Spicer recommended that the United States try to
ease tension with countries that tty
to keep their media from complete
Americanization. "People just want
to recognize themselves in their
own media," he said.

"The U.S. should lower its pos
ture, take it easy and not think
every cultural problem will trigger a
crisis," Spicer said. "This national
ist idea isn't sinister. In Denmark,
for example, all they want to do is
make sure that you see Scandina
vian television before you go on to
the American programming."
Spicer advocated a freer ex

change of culture through media, as
opposed to American cultural impe
rialism.
"The U.S. can invest in other na
tions' media. This would be benefi
cial for all parties. It would lower
anti-American sentiments while ac
tually raising the amount of Ameri
can cultural exports, which most na
tions really like and want," he said.
