A young girl in blue jeans and a pink
sweatshirt proudly pointed to her wa
tercolor painting featuring the trendy
pop singer, Brandy.
"Brandy's a really good singer," the
fourth grader told a school buddy who

was admiring her artwork.
More artwork decorated the walls.
Three men played their saxophones in
one painting. Choir singers belted out a
tune in another. Dancers bent over as
they performed a series of intricate
moves in a third piece.
These paintings were only a sam
pling of the diverse artwork on display

yesterday at Tresidder Union, as part
of the first-ever art exhibit hosted by
the Costano Partnership.
The Costano Partnership is a youth
education program affiliated with the
Haas Center for Public Service.
At a special reception yesterday, a
busload of students from Costano Ele-

Cassandra Hernandez and Irene Villalobos, both seventh graders at Costano Elementary School, show off their cre
ations yesterday at a Tresidder art exhibit organized by Stanford's Costano Partnership.
mentary School — Stanford's
partner in the Adopt-a-School pro
gram — filed into Tresidder to see
their paintings, watercolors and
hand-crafted masks, many of
which were related to a black her
itage theme.
Coterminal student Skip
Schwartz, Costano Partnership
program coordinator, said one of
the main purposes of the new ex
hibit is to bring the Stanford
campus together in support of
the partnership. Schwartz devel
oped the idea for an art show last
fall.
"I thought it would be an excit
ing way to emphasize the partner
ship as a two-way program,"
Schwartz said. "It also gives the
young students a chance to show
off their artistic talent by sharing
their work with Stanford."
At Costaho, students are en
couraged to express themselves

through art, a subject which is in
tegrated into the overall curricu
lum, said Fleta Brigsby, a third
grade teacher at the East Palo Alto
elementary school.
"The pictures show who the
students are and what they do in
everyday life," Brigsby said. "We
tell the students to draw what
they think is beautiful."
In a speech at the reception, Ty
rone Willingham, Stanford's head
football coach and the newest
member of the Haas Center Advi
sory Board, pointed out the diver
sity of the artwork. He empha
sized the broad spectrum of diver
sity in the community.
"We all have a unique talent be
cause we are different, just like no
two pictures on the wall are the
same," he said.
Willingham said he viewed the
artwork as the students' vision of
the future. He outlined four key
words to guide the students to suc
cess: respect, talent, hard work
and fun.
"Everyone should respect
themselves and others," he said.

"Hard work and self-confidence
will allow us to accomplish any
thing."
The artwork will also be on dis
play in Old Union, Arillaga Family
Sports Center, the Haas Center,
the Stanford Credit Union in
Tresidder and other administra
tive offices for three weeks.
Schwartz said he hopes the exhib
it will help the community gain a
better understanding of the part
nership.
"I hope that the art show will
give greater recognition to the
partnership," Schwartz said. "It's
important that people realize the
partnership is available."
The Costano Partnership, now
in its ninth year, aims to engage
the Stanford community with a
local school. The partnership pro
vides opportunities for Stanford
students to participate in one
time community service events.
"The partnership gives Stan
ford students the opportunity to
make a difference in one part of
East Palo Alto," said Schwartz.
"It's a meaningful way for us to

share our resources."
As a result of the school's eth
nic diversity, an important part
of the Costano program is spend
ing time understanding the stu
dents as a part of their unique
culture, Schwartz said. The part
nership is involved in several cul
tural activities put on by the
school, including the Cinco De
Mayo commemoration, an annual
Polynesian festival and black his
tory month.
"The partnership allows the stu
dents to expand their awareness of
communities outside of their own,"
said Anne Takamoto, Costano
school program coordinator.
The partnership is one of sever
al youth education programs that
take a cooperative role in the com
munity's effort to find solutions to
the challenges facing East Palo
Alto students.
"We have to find ways to reach
our young people and cultivate the
talents that they have," Willing
ham said. "They are the ones who
can make this world a better
place."
