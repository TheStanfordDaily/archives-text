# Workshop looks into DOD funds
## 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
Stanford faculty members gath
ered yesterday to discuss the ad
ministrative difficulties and general
outlook for funding of basic re
search by the Department of De
fense.
The conference was organized by
the Sponsored Projects Office in re
sponse to faculty requests for more
information on proposal develop
ment and funding for research.
Also discussed at the conference
was the Defense Department's re
search budget, proposal develop
ment and the types of projects that
the department is interested in
funding, said Bonnie Hale of the
Sponsored Projects Office. Faculty
members from other California uni
versities also attended the confer
ence.
Currently, Defense Department
funding comprises 15 percent of
the total research budget at Stan
ford, said Applied Physics Prof.
Robert Byer, chairman of the Uni
versity's Committee on Research.
The Defense Department in pre
vious years received approximately
$1.3 billion for basic research fund
ing; 60 percent of that, $720 million,
goes toward research at the univer
sity level.
But with pressure to downsize
at id the need to find money in the
federal budget to fund the Bosnian
military relief effort, the basic re
search budget has been cut by $20
million, Staff Specialist for Defense
and Engineering Research at the
Pentagon, Elisabeth Rodriguez-
Johnson, said at the workshop.
She estimated that the depart
ment's current total research bud
get — which includes basic research,
developmental research and ad
vanced technology research —
would move from $7.6 billion in
1995 down to $7.5 billion in 1996
and eventually back up to $8 billion
in the next few years.
Rodriguez-Johnson attributed
this cut to the amount of money that
basic research has "on the books"

due to a slow distribution process.
Universities will be asked to dis
burse the money faster in order to
avoid the appearance of surplus
money in the department's basic re
search budget.
Nonetheless, she assured the
conference members that "there is a
deep commitment to basic research
from the secretary of defense on
down to sustain the level of funding
at least through the year 2000."
Several Stanford faculty mem
bers expressed concern about the
plausibility of speeding up the dis
bursement process.
There are complaints of red tape

on both sides of the issue. Professors
complained that they have to per
form the work before the University
can bill for it and that the increment
payment process by the government
is extremely slow.
Deputy Director of the Office of
Naval Research Debra Hughes
said, "Everyone has to play the
game better or else we're going to
get penalized."
Hale said one message the gov
ernment representatives wanted to
send was that faculty members
should get to know the program di
rectors at the agencies to which they
are applying.
