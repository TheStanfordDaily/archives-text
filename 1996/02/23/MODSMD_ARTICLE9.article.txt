# The 						year of the rat looks to be good
## Asian community rings in new year 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Amid festive decorations and
plenty of Chinese cuisine, mem
bers of the Stanford Asian commu
nity celebrated the arrival of the
lunar new year yesterday after
noon.
"Gung she fat choy. Shin yen
quai lo," said senior Ray Wang. "It
means 'Happy new year. May it be
prosperous and filled with happi
ness.' " Wang and 50 other under
graduate and graduate students
came to Old Union Ballroom to
ring in the new year together.
Rick Yuen, director of the Asian
American Activities Center, said
the incoming year, the year of the
rat, was of particular significance.
" It's an important year as it sig
nals the beginning of a new 12-
year cycle," said Yuen.
According to Chinese folklore,
the rat was the first animal to win
a race that would designate the an
imals' order on the Zodiac. The
pig, which was the symbol of the
outgoing year, was the last one to
lumber past the finish line.
"So far, it seems we are off to a
good start," said Yuen. "The rains
are a good sign we will have a
bountiful harvest, which trans
lates into a prosperous new year."
Tradition and symbolism play a
major role in the new year celebra
tions, said Cindy Ng, assistant di
rector of the center. She said new
year banquets are prime examples.
"Everything must be served
whole. For example, a chicken
would be served with its head and
feet still attached at the new year
banquet," said Ng. "It's to ensure
continuity and completeness to
the new year."
While there was no whole chick
en served at the new year celebra
tion, Ng commented on the other
dishes laid out for guests, each one

symbolizing some aspect of good
fortune.
"Take the choui fun. It has long
noodles. If you eat it, you're sup
posed to have long life â€” or so the
superstition goes," said Ng. "Also,
there is nian gao, which is a
dessert that is traditionally served
as a new year treat."
The new year celebration was
also designed to bring greater
awareness of the Asian cultures
that celebrate the lunar new year.
Yuen said that although the cel
ebration was based on a lunar cal
endar that originated in China, the
Chinese, Koreans and Vietnamese
all celebrate the new year slightly
differently.
One such difference was shown
in the dances performed by sopho
more Mee Heh Kim and freshman
Amy Huang to celebrate the new
year.
The performances were tradi
tional dances designed to show the
differences among Asian cultures.
Each had a distinctive costume
and technique involved, which was
meant to convey some aspect of
the culture it originated in.
"For example, my costume
shows me with bound feet, an un
fortunate but common practice of
the time," said Huang. "My dance
was called the 'butterfly dance' be
cause women of privilege rarely
could go out except to the garden
to catch butterflies."
Kim's dance was usually per
formed in the royal Korean court
during the new year celebration.
She said her dance was, like many
other Korean dances, meant to in
terpret poetry.
"Usually, they would perform
in a group, as if acting out a play,"
said Kim.
Celebrations of the lunar new
year, which arrived Monday, are
scheduled to continue throughout
the week.
