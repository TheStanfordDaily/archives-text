last relief from the nagging ache ol taxes, we
recommend TIAA-CRKF SRAs. SRAs are tax
deferred annuities designed to help build additional
assets —money that can help make the difference
between living and living welt after your working
years are over.
Contributions to your SRAs are deducted from your
salary on a pretax basis. I hat lowers your current
taxable income, so you start saving on federal anil,
in most cases, state and local income taxes right aw.iv
What's more, any earnings on your SRAs are also
tax deferred until you receive them as income. That
can make a big difference in how painful your tax
bill is every year.
As the nation's largest retirement system, based
on assets under management, we offer a wide range
of allocation choices — from the lIA A Traditional
Annuity, which guarantees principal and interest
(backed by the company's claims-paying ability),
in TIAA-CRKFs diversified variable annuiu
accounts. And our expenses are very low,' which
means more ol your money goes toward improving
your future financial health.

vou ,i complete SRA information kit, plus a free
slide iah ulator ih.il shows sou how much SRAs
