# Haitian scholar discusses interpretations of history
## 
### Amy Slucter Staff writer 
Once upon a time scholars
believed history could be simpli
fied into a chronicle of events, a
simple narrative that pro
gressed without contest. Now,
however, the interpretation of
history is a product of present
ideas, values and assumptions,
a leading Haitian scholar said
Saturday.
In a speech at the Humanities
Center Annex, Michel-Rolph
Trouillot addressed the politics
of history and drew upon the
memory of slavery and the Holo
caust to demonstrate that histo
ry is difficult to define.
"There is no past indepen
dent from the present," Trouil
lot said. "The legacy of the past
is as much an invention of the
present as anything."
Trouillot's speech was the
keynote address of a two-day
graduate student conference
called "Past Abuses: Memory,
Nostalgia and Oblivion."
The debate about the nature
of the past, said Trouillot, usu
ally takes on two forms. One
form, which he chose to call pos
itivistic, asserts that a fact is a
fact. The second form, which he
called constructionalist, claims
that the past is constructed.
"Constructionalists believe
that history is not much differ
ent from fiction," Trouillot said.
"They believe that history is the
fiction favored by those who
won the last war."
Trouillot is currently a fellow
at Stanford's Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences. He is an anthropology
professor at Johns Hopkins
University, as well as director of
the Institute for Global Studies

in Culture, Power and History.
His latest book, "Silencing the
Past: Power and the Production
of History," relates to his belief
that history is not simply "fact"
or "fiction."
In his speech, titled, "Histori
cal Abuses: Slavery, the Holo
caust and the Power of Silence,"
Trouillot explained that how peo
ple remember history is influ
enced by their current situation.
To demonstrate his point he
gave the example of the island of
Martinique, which is about one
fourth the size of Long Island.
According to Trouillot, Mar
tinique imported more slaves
than the United States, but the
memory of slavery is much
stronger in the United States
than in Martinique. This can be

explained, he said, by the situa
tion of the descendants of slaves
in the United States.
"The importance of slavery
comes from the continual re
newal of American racism,"
Trouillot said, contending that
in this sense history was con
structed by the present. Howev
er, he pointed out that history is
not merely a fabrication.
"If fiction is enough, then
why bother with the French
Revolution and slavery when we
already have Red Riding
Hood?" Trouillot said.
Trouillot pointed out that the
boundary between fact and fic
tion affects the way in which civ
ilizations perceive society and
construct individual lives. The
issue, he said, is not the content
of historical knowledge but the
purpose of that knowledge.
"Once upon a time, the lead
ers of Nazi Germany planned
and supervised the murder of 6
million Jews," Trouillot said.
"Or did they?" he asked, ex
plaining the difference between
the positivistic and construc
tionalist interpretations.
According to Trouillot,
power is always a part of histo
ry. Power, he said, asserts its in
fluence not so much by what
history says but by what history
does not say.
"Most historical silences are
not the products of conspira
cies," Trouillot said. "They are
silences that appear natural. Si
lence is the greatest product of
power in historical narrative."
To break historical silences,
Trouillot suggested that society
must go beyond history books.
"Only in the present can we
be true or false to the past that
we still acknowledge," Trouillot
said.
