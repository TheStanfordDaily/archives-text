## Internet law goes to court 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Internet is
more like a newspaper than television — and
deserves the same First Amendment protection, a
coalition including Microsoft, the American
Library Association and the Society for Profes
sional Journalists plans to argue in a lawsuit
today.
The lawsuit seeks to overturn the Communica
tions Decency Act, which imposes a $250,000 fine
and up to six years in prison for transmitting
material considered indecent in such a way that it
may be accessed on the Internet by children.
Another lawsuit, filed Feb. 8 by a coalition led
by the American Civil Liberties Union, resulted in
the temporary blocking of the act. U.S. District
Judge Ronald Buckwaiter said the definition of
indecency in the act was so vague that people
wouldn't know they were breaking the law until
they were arrested.
The new lawsuit, to be filed in Philadelphia by
the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition,
goes beyond the ACLLJ's by attempting to redefine
the law which covers the Internet.
"The basic First Amendment framework for
the Internet is going to be set by this case," said
Daniel Weitzner of the Center for Democracy and
Technology in Washington D.C.
Messages left yesterday with the Justice
Department seeking comment on the lawsuit were
not immediately returned.
The lawsuit includes more than 50 pages of
explanation as to why the Internet is a new tech
nology deserving of new laws.
"A good chunk of the complaint is spent walk
ing the court through how the medium works,"
said Bill Burrington, general counsel for America
Online, the largest commercial Internet service in
the United States witJi more than 4 million mem
bers.
"By putting together this very broad coalition
we have the opportunity to bring this debate up to
a more rational and intelligent level, and to edu
cate the court about the technology. That educa
tion never happened in Congress because there
were never any hearings," he said.
Historically, broadcast has been the most
restricted kind of speech because the number of
channels is limited and listeners and viewers don't
have control over what they see.
"We're hoping to show that instead of being a
captive audience, Internet users have control of
what they see and what comes into their homes,"
Weitzner said.
Because of that, the lawsuit holds, the Internet
is more like a newspaper or a book than a televi
sion program — and Internet companies are more
like publishers than television stations.
