# 25 dead in Jerusalem
## Militant Palestinians responsible for bombs 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — In the deadliest
attack in Israel in two decades, militant
Palestinians avenged last month's assassi
nation of their chief bombmaker with two
suicide bombings yesterday that killed 25
people and imperiled the peace process.
The explosions blew apart a Jerusalem
bus and a soldiers' depot. Two Americans
were among the dead. At least 82 people
were wounded.
Now, just three months ahead of the May
29 elections, Israelis once again must
rethink their commitment to peace with the
Palestinians.
The U.S. embassy identified the dead
Americans as Mattityahu Eisenfeld, 25, of
West Hartford, Conn., who was studying at
a Jewish seminary in Jerusalem, and Sarah
Duker, 22, of Teaneck, N.J., who was study
ing at Hebrew University.
In May, Israelis will have to decide
whether to press on with Prime Minister
Shimon Peres' vision of peace despite mis
givings, or back a right-wing government
that would suspend or slow the peace pro
cess.
"Up to now, Peres has maintained a com
fortable lead over his challenger, opposition
leader Benjamin Netanyahu. But terror
attack • such as yesterday's bombings could
persu voters in the middle of Israel's
politic. lectrum that going ahead with
Peres , ~e agenda is too risky.
Ultra-Orthodox protesters vented
their anger at Peres yesterday when,
ringed by dozens of police, he visited the
site in Jerusalem. Dozens booed him,
chanting, "With blood and fire, we will

throw out Peres."
The prime minister said there was no
miracle cure for suicide attacks. "I know
deep in my heart that on the way to win
peace, we shall have to pay a heavy toll for
it,"he told a news conference.
The first blast went off at 6:48 a.m (11:48
p.m. Saturday EST) in downtown
Jerusalem, ripping through the crowded
No. 18 bus and hurling bodies into the air.
The explosives, TNT packed with nails and
ball bearings, killed 23 and wounded 49.
"The bus went up into the air," said Yigal
Kara, a witness. "I saw parts of bodies. A
head fell in front of us to the ground."
About 45 minutes later, in the coastal
town of Ashkelon, a suicide bomber report
edly disguised as an Israeli soldier blew him
self up at a hitchhiking stop for troops
returning to base after weekend leaves. Two
people were killed and 33 wounded.
The death toll included the two bombers,
police said.
Hamas said the bombings avenged their
chief bombmaker, Yehiya Ayyash, who was
killed in the Gaza Strip by a rigged cellular
phone in a Jan. 5 operation widely attribut
ed to Israel.
"The attacks wore a painful blow to those
who ordered the assassination of Yehiya
Ayyash," said a Hamas leaflet. The leaflet
also said Hamas would end the violence if
Israel stopped hunting down Hamas fugi
tives and released the group's detainees.
Yesterday also marked the second
anniversary of the Hebron mosque mas
sacre in which a Jewish settler shot dead 29
Muslim worshipers.
