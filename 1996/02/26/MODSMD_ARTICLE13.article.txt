# Low temperatures and rain forecasted; firefighters get much needed break
## Midwest grass fires finally extinguished 
### 
(AP) Most of the grass fires that scorched
thousands of acres in Texas, Oklahoma and
Kansas were out yesterday, allowing firefighters to
pack up their gear and take a much-needed break.
"Things are pretty quiet," said Capt. Steve Bur
dick of the Stillwater, Okla., Fire Department.
"Our crews came in about 7 this morning. And
they all went to bed."
For several days, grass, trees and shrubs, crack
ling dry from lack of moisture, have ignited and
blackened miles of grassland. The weather fore
cast looked promising yesterday, with a hint of
rain in the forecast throughout the region early
this week.

"We are getting some cooler temperatures,"
said meteorologist Jeff Raberding at Fort Worth,
Texas. "Our humidities are coming up, it's not
quite as dry. We do have a chance of rain,
although not that great, toward midweek."
A lot of rain will be needed to make a difference,
said Texas Department of Health spokesman
David Vaughan.
"We want to caution anybody against a false
sense of security if there's a little rain. In the past
after short rains, people have relaxed and barbe
cued outside or burned trash and didn't heed
whether a ban has been lifted," he said.
Some of the largest fires, which destroyed

30,000 acres at Fort Hood, Texas, were out yester
day. However, more than 300 soldiers and fire
fighters kept patrolling the area for hot spots,
Army base officials said.
Smoldering areas at the 304-square-mile base
were doused by helicopters hauling water buckets
up to 1,200 gallons.
Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison,
both li-Texas, toured damaged houses and hun
dreds of charred acres yesterday in Aubrey, about
35 miles north of Dallas.
"As far as we know, there are no large fires
burning that are not controlled," said Mark Stan
ford of the Texas Forest Service.
