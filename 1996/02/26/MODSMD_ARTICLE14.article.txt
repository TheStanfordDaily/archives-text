# Protesters decry downed aircraft
## 
### 
MIAMI (AP) — Enel Puentes and six
friends bobbed in the Straits of Florida
for three days in July 1994 on a tin-can
and inner-tube raft before they saw the
airplane that saved their lives.
The Brothers to the Rescue pilot cir
cled the Cuban refugees a few times
then dropped a package of flares and
food and a note that said the Coast
Guard was on its way.
Yesterday, Puentes and nearly 2,000
Cuban exiles gathered at the headquar
ters of the volunteer search and rescue
group to protest the downing of two air
craft Saturday by Cuban government
fighter planes.
"The feeling I felt that day — the
admiration, respect — it was the same
that made me come here today," said
Puentes, 29. "Only now there is sad
ness."
A similar protest in New York
attracted about 150 people and resulted
in 13 arrests when protesters refused to
move behind police barricades.
Minutes before he was arrested,
Jorge Acosda, 39, said he would rather
go to jail than "to allow Castro to dictate

to me from Havana where, when and
how I practice my freedom of speech. If
I move, I am letting Fidel dictate to me."
As the Coast Guard and Navy con
tinued to search international waters
off Havana for four people, some pas
sengers on a cruise ship in the area Sat
urday told how the Cuban MiGs shot
down the two single-engine planes in
the waters separating Cuba and Flori
da.
"The MiG just appeared from
nowhere and came and he sent the rock
et out, and (there was) smoke, flame all
over," Guven Yalcints of Knoxville,
Tenn., told Miami television station
WSVN.
John Ciurciu of Elmwood Park, N.J.,
another passenger on the Royal
Caribbean Cruise Line ship, added:
"Then I saw another white plane, like
trying to get away from something and
all of a sudden it shot it down. Another
plane came from a lower altitude and
just shot it away."
The ship's staff had thought that a
military exercise was being conducted in
the area, Royal Caribbean said in a news

release. Since no distress calls or advi
sories were received by the ship, the
M.S. Majesty of the Seas, it continued
its voyage to Miami where it arrived yes
terday.
Secretary of State Warren Christo
pher said yesterday the Clinton admin
istration was calling on the United
Nations to discuss punitive actions
against Cuba, though he didn't elabo
rate.
"The actions they took [Saturdayl
were not justified under any circum
stances," Christopher said at a White
House news conference.
Christopher said the United States
believes the planes were in internation
al air space when they were shot down.
But senior administration aides said at
least one of the three planes entered
Cuban air space at some point before
the shoot-down.
The Cuban Foreign Ministry said in
statement issued yesterday that said its
government planes shot down two
"pirate" planes that had violated its
airspace, coming within 5 to 8 miles
northwest of Havana.
