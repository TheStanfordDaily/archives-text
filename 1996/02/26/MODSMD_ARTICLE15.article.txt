Gas prices increase
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Motorists paid
an average 1 1/2 cents more for a gallon of
gasoline over the past two weeks as a rush on
the oil futures market drove up prices, an
analyst said yesterday.
The average pump price, including all
grades and taxes, was 119.13 cents Friday,
according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000
gas stations nationwide. That was up a
penny-and-a-half from the Feb. 9 survey.
Prices had been rising since November,
except for a small drop in late January and
early this month, said analyst Trilby Lund
berg.
Traders had been expecting the United
Nations to partially lift an embargo of Iraqi
oil, increasing supply.
"When the agreement wasn't reached,
there was a rush to buy crude oil in the
futures market before the prices rebounded
— which in itself created a jump in value,"
Lundberg said.
Other price factors, such as consumption,
remained steady, she said.
Drug seizures up
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Customs
Service, trying to blunt criticism it fails to
stop drugs from being shipped into the
United States in cargo trucks, announced
yesterday its drug seizures at the U.S.-Mex
ican border jumped 25 percent last year.
The report on the year-old Operation Hard

Line comes after widespread criticism of agen
cy Commissioner George Weise, and after sev
eral recent allegations of agency corruption.
Both the FBI and a federal grand jury are
looking into the charges that some Customs
inspectors allowed cocaine into the United
States from Mexico in exchange for money
from drug traffickers.
In addition, some former employees have
charged that a Customs program, called
"Line Release," that allows firms that pass a
background check to send cargo trucks
across the U.S. border with little or no
inspection has aided large-scale drug traf
ficking.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has been
among those concerned that Customs con
centrates too heavily on facilitating the
movement of cargo trucks, and not enough
on ensuring the trucks are searched for
drugs.
In the year before Operation Hard Line
was launched, Customs failed to make a sin
gle discovery of cocaine in trucks entering
the United States at three of the busiest
entry points along the Mexican border.
But in the year after the operation began,
total seizures of all types of drugs jumped 25
percent, according to the Customs statistics
released yesterday.
The amount of cocaine seized by Customs
agents along the entire border increased 19
percent over 1994, to a record 51,162
pounds. In addition, Customs seized 137
pounds of heroin along the entire border, an
increase of 108 percent.

Dole fires strategist, pollster
PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) — Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole has decided to replace his
top strategist and fire his lead pollster in an
effort to revive his struggling presidential
campaign, sources said yesterday. The
shakeup comes after back-to-back defeats
that have the once overwhelming GOP
front-runner battling for survival.
The moves follow weeks of often bitter tur
moil within the Dole campaign over strategy
and advertising. Dole made the personnel deci
sions late Saturday after being told he would
lose Delaware's presidential primary to Steve
Forbes — despite being assured earlier that he
was leading in the state and likely to win.
The dramatic internal campaign reorgani
zation is but one reflection of the urgent mood
within the Dole camp. After a razor-thin victo
ry in lowa, Dole has now run second in New
Hampshire and Delaware and is in a tight race
here in Arizona, where polls show a narrow
Dole lead but GOP activists give Pat Buchanan
solid odds of winning Tuesday's primary.
In the shakeup, pollster William Mcln
turff and his firm, Public Opinion Strate
gies, will no longer be given any Dole cam
paign business, according to campaign
sources who spoke to The Associated Press
on condition of anonymity.
And William Lacy, a longtime Dole advis
er, was told he was being removed as chief
