VOTING IS AN imperfect
form of political expression.
The simple act of pulling a
lever or marking a ballot in favor of
a candidate or proposition cannot
possibly do justice to our thoughts
and fears, our beliefs and dreams.
However, elections mark one of the
few times average citizens can par
ticipate directly in the political pro
cess — their collective voice can
remove an official from office or
pass a bill into law. The simple act is
an important one.
On March 26, California will
hold its primary election. In most
areas of the state, the ballot will
consist of two sections — a presi
dential preference poll and a group
of propositions. Some districts
(such as the 11th, in which Stan
ford falls) will add a third section, a
special election to fill state Assem
bly or state Senate seats recently
vacated. All three sections are
important.
Time is running out for citizens
not yet registered to vote in the
March 26 election. Today is the
final day in which to do so. Voter
registration forms are available at
post offices, fire stations, libraries
and city halls. More information
can be obtained from the California
Voter Registration Hotline (1-800-
345-8683) or from the Santa Clara
County Registrar of Voters (408-
298-7400).
Because the election falls in the
middle of spring break, many stu
dents may not be in the area to cast
their votes at the appropriate
polling sites. These students, as
well as any other citizens who will
be gone, should file absentee ballot
request forms by the March 19
deadline.
The presidential preference poll
— in which only registered party

members can participate — will
determine who California's dele
gates will support at each party's
nominating conventions. While
President Clinton is assured of the
Democratic nomination, the Repub
lican nomination is still up for
grabs. For the first time in decades,
California's winner-take-all prima
ry may decide who the presidential
candidate will be. Every California
Republican should be concerned
with the outcome.
Legislators and interest groups
often conspire to place propositions
on primary ballots. Because the
amount of attention paid to these
elections is much lower than to the
general elections in November, they
hope they can motivate a bill's
hard-core supporters and sneak the
bill by less-motivated citizens.
These propositions, however, do
have the potential to affect citizens'
lives in substantive ways. This
year's ballot includes proposals
regarding such issues as property
transfers between grandparents
and grandchildren, the addition of
drive-by shootings and murders
committed during carjackings to
the list of crimes punishable by the
death penalty and the establish
ment of a "no-fault" car insurance
system.
The state Senate and the state
Assembly are both closely divided
between Democrats and Republi
cans. As a result, any special elec
tions held on March 26 may affect
the balance of power in the state
legislature. The election should
hold significance for every citizen,
regardless of their party prefer
ence. In the 11th district, where
Stanford is located, Democrat
Byron Sher squares off against
Republican Patrick Shanahan for
the Senate seat vacated by Tom
Campbell when he won election to
Congress in December.
Voting may not be the ideal way
to express political opinions, but it
is the easiest and least time-con
suming. Don't throw away your
best chance to determine political
outcomes. Get registered and get to
the polls.
