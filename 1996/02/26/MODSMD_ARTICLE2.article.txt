# COP slate facing uncertain fate
## Platform potential candidate says ethnicity a factor in her withdrawal 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Although tonight is the People's Plat
form's endorsement deadline for next
year's Council of Presidents slate, slate or
ganizers are still scrambling to find two
more members.
A slate was close to being in fmal form
last week when one of the potential candi
dates, junior Lindy Eichenbaum, suddenly
withdrew her candidacy — a decision she
said arose partly out of suggestions that be
cause she is white, she would be under in
: utise, perhaps uncomfortable pressure
i rom the University's ethnic centers.
Eichenbaum said she was told by ASSU
senator Angela Parker — one of the orga
nizers of the COP slate — that some party
members might question how earnestly
she would bo able to represent the interests
of ethnic communities.
"Being on the COP would be a tough job
where you're questioned constantly about
how well you represent a wide diversity of
interests including those of the ethnic cen-

ters," Parker said. "I tried
to emphasize that she
would not be questioned
because she was white but
rather because she
doesn't have a history
with the People's Plat
form."
Eichenbaum said her
commitment to other or
ganizations was the main

impetus for her decision to withdraw from
the COP slate. Nevertheless, she said she is
concerned that too much emphasis is
placed on the ethnicity of student politi
cians.
"I don't feel like competence should be
judged by which community a student be
longs to," Eichenbaum said. "If the senti
ment is that students must belong to cer
tain ethnic communities in order to be ef
fective leaders, then the People's Platform
should wake up and become more inclusive.
I find that kind of attitude frightening at an
institution that is as intellectual and al
legedly open-minded as Stanford is sup

posed to be." She added that she feels no re
sentment toward Parker because of her
comments.
But Parker downplayed the role of race
in the conversation. "I honestly believe it's
not a racial issue but an interpersonal
issue," she said.
Parker explained that the party was
founded to represent the interests of the
ethnic centers and therefore it looks to its
candidates to support the interests of the
ethnic communities.
Although distressed by Eichenbaum's
withdrawal from the slate, Bill Shen, the
ASSU deputy senate chair who is organiz
ing the People's Platform slate with Park
er, said, "my commitment to run with
An gie stands."
Shen said the ethnicity of student politi
cians "is a tough question that comes up
every year. The purpose of having four peo
ple on the COP is to bring together a team
of students representing as broad a range of
interests and issues as possible."

"The ethnic centers play a vital
and visible role on campus, and it's
very important that they have a
voice in campus politics," Shen said.
"However, by no means does that
give [ethnic centers] a higher priori
ty or suggest they are more impor
tant that other campus organiza
tions," such as the Greek communi
ty, the Women's Center and the
Haas Center for Public Service.
Shen also said he will not form a
slate with students who are fixated
on serving "only this or that interest.
No one will be on my slate unless
they want to represent all 13,000 or
14,000 Stanford students."
Disappointed by Eichenbaum's
decision not to run, Shen said, "She
would have been an extremely quali
fied, committed and dynamic candi
date for the C0P.... She decided
not to run for the same reasons why
we wanted her: he - * dedication to
being a student leader."
Despite the uncertainty of which
two students will join Shen and
Parker on the slate, Shen said, "I'm
optimistic that we will have a slate

together by [tonight]."
If Shen and Parker do not find
the two additional slate members by
tonight, the People's Platform
might not grant them a party en
dorsement, which means they
would have to run on an indepen
dent slate.
"The COP is too important to be
dictated by a deadline," Shen said,
referring to the deadline the party
set for declaring slates.
While he hopes to meet tonight's
party deadline, Shen said that if the
slate does not come together, the
ASSU Elections Commission's
March 1 deadline might allow him
and Parker more time to come up
with the two remaining candidates,
but only if the party gives them an
extension.
"It Is never easy to get students to
dedicate themselves to such a time
consuming commitment," Shen
said. "The COP is probably the
biggest organizational commitment
one can make as a student at this
university.... If we don't have a
slate tomorrow night, we're not just
going to throw one together at ran
dom. [Parker and II remain commit
ted to finding students who will rep
resent the broadest range of inter-
