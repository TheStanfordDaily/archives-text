## A 						hush falls over the crowd

A LIFELONG SPORTS fan, I was
initially drawn to Stanford because
of its awesome combination of aca
demic and athletic excellence. In this
regard, I haven't been disappointed.
We've had the best athletic program in
the country each of the three years I've
been here, racking up countless team and
individual championships. If Stanford
had been a country in the 1992 Olympics,
we would've placed 13th in medal stand
ings.
What I didn't expect, however, was the
almost complete lack of atmosphere at our
sporting events. Football games are the
worst, where nary a cheer is heard for sev
eral quarters at a time. It's a difficult task
to recreate the frenzied passion of Ten
nessee or Washington — or even a good
Paly High game — when our stadium
seats 14 times the undergraduate popula
tion. As if conscious of this fact, the
Department of Athletics has placed the
student "section" closer to San Jose than
to the football field, thus filling at least a
dozen of the 50,000 seats on the fringe
which would otherwise be left empty.
This, of course, would be irrelevant if
alums came in droves, which obviously
they don't. Those who do — bless their
souls — spend more time sipping cham
pagne and comparing new BMWs than
they do actually inside the stadium gates.
When halftime comes, they saunter to
their seats, golf-clap approvingly, then

pass out for the duration of the third quar
ter. The fourth quarter clock reminds
them it's time to head for the parking lot,
so they can get back to their Portola Valley
homes before traffic gets heavy.
Who would've thought Stanford's aca
demic excellence could somehow impair
the school's athletic climate? I certainly
didn't. The Sixth Man Club, for all its con
troversy, has done wonders for basketball
games, though real atmosphere is still
hard to come by. Standing with the bunch,
it quickly becomes evident that many
members, especially now that the group
has expanded, have spent a little too much
time pounduig the books. Chants of "over
rr-rraated" spewed enthusiastically from
students during Thursday's game against
Washington State, and were immediately
followed by taunts of "CBA, CBA" — an
allusion to the Continental Basketball
Association, where players not good
enough to sign with the NBA often toil in
obscurity. The problem? This occurred
while we were down by 10 points in the
first quarter, and WSU's Mark Hendrick
son — the object of this ridicule — had
more dunks in the first five minutes than
we've had all year.
The attraction of athletics is a curious
one, entrenched as much in our egos as
anything else. When our team wins, we
feel good — not for the athletes, but for
ourselves. It's a vicarious pleasure,
though few of us will admit it. We are a

spoiled group at Stanford, surrounded by
individuals of incredible talent and intelli
gence. We are accustomed to being
stroked and petted, complimented for
everything and criticized for little. At
times, however, we are quick to take this
for granted.
After the basketball team's victory
over UCLA, hundreds of students
stormed the court in ecstasy, mugging for
TV cameras and slapping high-fives. The
nets were torn down as if we'd just won
the Final Four. It was one of the best
experiences I've had at Stanford; one of
the few times that I've truly been over
whelmed with school spirit. That's why
the reaction of the fans to the WSU loss
was such an eye-opener. Those of us who
had been so quick to revel in our team's
glory a week before did our best to slip
inconspicuously out of Maples before the
clock counted down the agonizing final
seconds.
Whatever the reason, Stanford sports
events tend to be a little dry. Let's close
the books and put down the wine glass for
a moment, sleep out for a game and appre
ciate the best athletic program in the
nation.

If we were just counting gold medals, we
would've been 10th.
