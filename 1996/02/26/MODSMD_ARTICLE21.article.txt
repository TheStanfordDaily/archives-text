Stanford must consider all issues with campus Taco Bell

IN FRIDAY'S ISSUE of The Daily,
Dean of Students Marc Wais com
mented, "I am very much commit
ted to effecting tangible change. I want
those changes to make students, faculty
and staff happier and enhance the qual
ity of their life." I will give Wais the
benefit of the doubt that he was not
referring to a new Taco Bell. Why?

Beyond the admittedly petty nutritional
qualm that a greasy burrito or taco
would "enhance the quality of life," the
addition of a Taco Bell would seriously
compromise the quality of life of many
people in Burma.
How, you ask? Taco Bell is a sub
sidiary of PepsiCo, who owns a bottling
plant in Burma. Any investment in com

panies that operate in Burma is an
implicit show of support for SLORC, the
military regime that controls Burma.
As SLORC is one of the most egre
gious human rights violators in the
world, it is almost laughable that Stan
ford would even conceive of directly
supporting a military junta that
thwarts democratic efforts by placing

opposition leaders under house arrest
(including the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize
winner, Aung San Suu Kyi), routinely
uses slave labor and is engaging in eth
nic genocide.
It is incumbent upon Marc Wais to
take a moral stance against Taco Bell.
