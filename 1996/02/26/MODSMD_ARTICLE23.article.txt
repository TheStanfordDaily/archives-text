## Stalked by Skippy: When the disgruntled dial Dad 
### 
I'M GONNA HAVE to hide now, because
of what I'm about to write. Because of
what I've already written.
I'm going to have to sleep in a different
room every night, constantly changing safe
houses, carrying a change of undies and a
toothbrush in the small pocket of my knap
sack.
You see, I'm being stalked. Followed,
bothered, hunted, watched over. By a
prank-caller with a letter-writing campaign
and a low threshold for Jews who write
about their sisters. And now I can no longer
feel safe at my own home, walking on the
street or peeing alone.
God, I wish I was making this up.
But the truth is that someone out there
took so much umbrage at a column I wrote
that she has taken it upon herself to violate
my boundaries several times a week. That
bit about my younger sister's exploding sex
uality and my own angst over it hit some
delicate nerve in this woman's psyche and a
small avalanche of privacy invasion ensued.
Thus an otherwise insignificant page
five piece began my tryst with Skippy. (I've
named this character "Skippy" after a bezit
ted 14-year-old boy who became so fixated
on my disinterested little sister that he
allied my father at work one day and asked
if it'd be okay if the two got married even
though they're still rather young and his job
prospects were poor. My father told him

he'd think about it.)
Skippy: An adult-sized My First Stalker.
I have to buy a bunny now just so when she
comes to my room to boil something she'll
leave my stereo alone.
Now, before I say anything else, I need to
point out that I'm fully aware what a bad
idea it is to be writing this. My residence
dean has already warned me that it's gener
ally considered unhelpful, if not bad form, to
agitate a stalker. The police said the same
thing.
But I find in myself a deep need to publi
cize this story anyway — even if it'll make
my single about as safe as Sarajevo for the
next few weeks. It's as if I need to fight back
against my nebulous, anonymous intruder
and this is my only way; as if I might recap
ture the upper hand by further risking my
safety and making Skippy's self-righteous
assaults as public as possible.
As if I think it'll make Skippy leave me
the hell alone.
So here goes:
It started with a letter. Labeled "To the
Parents of Michael Green," a clipped copy of
my "Sibling's sexcapades" column (Feb. 12)
was sent to my home in New York — no
return address.
At that point I admit I still thought it was
cool — a writer likes to know that his work
disturbs someone.
But then I considered what this message

meant. I got the feeling that sending the
copy was intended to punish me; as if to
inform my parents of what perversions
their son is up to; as if I didn't send three
copies of the same damn column home to
them myself.
Still, it was okay, it was just a letter.
But then things, as they tend to do in
those neat moments right before discomfort
becomes pain, got worse. The next day Skip
py called my parents.
"I want to discuss your son's article with
you," Skippy said. My father says it w.is
clearly a woman's voice.
She claimed she has children of her own
and, thus, found my article about adoles
cent exploration to be utterly offensive.
My father, using a brilliant "Well, you
know who I am, now why don't you tell
me who you are" technique tried to whee
dle Skippy into identifying herself. When
pressed for a phone number, she hung up.
Since that little call to my family, Skippy
and I have moved into a call-and-hang-up
routine that happens a few times a week,
often playing well past midnight. Once, I
picked up the phone to hear Skippy, in a fit
of adolescent creativity, playing the "I'll be
watching you" verse from The Police's
"Every Breath You Take."
Now remember: All this was over a col
umn about how I'm the one having trouble
dealing with my little sister's budded and

practiced sexuality. This, of course, is pre
suming that story I told was even true, pre
suming I even have a little sister, which a
responsible reader knows never to do.
Yet apparently the thought of the char
acter of Michael's little sister actually hav
ing genitalia is even more disconcerting to
Skippy than it is to me.
Which leaves me trying to understand
what kind of a person Skippy must be: Who
acts this way? Why? Does she really have
kids? Threatening me with early Sting lyrics
delineates more of an undergraduate mind
than a mature or parental (or rational) one.
Is Skippy really all one person, or am I
amalgamating separate events? If it is one
{x 4 rson, does she realize she's coming off as
"a stalker"?
Is she simply some hyper-conservative
with too much free time on her hands? Am
I safe from her? She did clip out my column
— I know she has a pair of scissors.
I mean, I've had people disagree with my
theories or find my ramblings offensive
before, and that was fine. An exchange of
ideas is a nifty thing in such a cerebral envi
ronment such as Stanford. Letters were
written, insults exchanged, fingers given.
But none of that was threatening. Or
anonymous. Just your average altercation
between two individuals with varying
thresholds for the taboo.
This, on the other hand, is a full blown

case of harassment.
And in the end, I suppose, Skippy's won.
She got what she wanted. My life has been
severely disrupted. And now, like an idiot,
I'm giving her even more of what they say
stalkers want, what they say encourages
them: attention.
Well, I hope she's happy now.
The feminine spirit which she believes
she defends has been fully avenged: I can't
live in my room; I've installed one of those
handy-dandy Caller ID boxes which I'll need
until I give in and have my number
changed; and, worst of all, my mom (and it's
all her fault for raising me to be so insensi
tive, right Skippy?) is seriously worried
about me and isn't sleeping.
I'm even spending afternoons in group
therapy with Madonna, Letterman and the
whole cast of "Cape Fear." Which isn't so
bad actuiilly — I was hoping to apply for
Letterman's writing staff anyway.
So there it is. Maybe things'll be better.
Maybe it'll only get worse. Maybe Skippy'll
call and say she's sorry and promise to stop
now.
And then maybe I can sleep in my room
again.

Congratulations, Raj. You 're a star.

often playing well past midnight. Once, I
picked up the phone to hear Skippy, in a fit
of adolescent creativity, playing the "I'll be
watching you" verse from The Police's
"Every Breath You Take."
Now remember: All this was over a col
umn about how I'm the one having trouble
dealing with my little sister's budded and

practiced sexuality. This, of course, is pre
suming that story I told was even true, pre
suming I even have a little sister, which a
responsible reader knows never to do.
Yet apparently the thought of the char
acter of Michael's little sister actually hav
ing genitalia is even more disconcerting to
Skippy than it is to me.
Which leaves me trying to understand
what kind of a person Skippy must be: Who
acts this way? Why? Does she really have
kids? Threatening me with early Sting lyrics
delineates more of an undergraduate mind
than a mature or parental (or rational) one.
Is Skippy really all one person, or am I
amalgamating separate events? If it is one
{x 4 rson, does she realize she's coming off as
"a stalker"?
Is she simply some hyper-conservative
with too much free time on her hands? Am
I safe from her? She did clip out my column
— I know she has a pair of scissors.
I mean, I've had people disagree with my
theories or find my ramblings offensive
before, and that was fine. An exchange of
ideas is a nifty thing in such a cerebral envi
ronment such as Stanford. Letters were
written, insults exchanged, fingers given.
But none of that was threatening. Or
anonymous. Just your average altercation
between two individuals with varying
thresholds for the taboo.
This, on the other hand, is a full blown

case of harassment.
And in the end, I suppose, Skippy's won.
She got what she wanted. My life has been
severely disrupted. And now, like an idiot,
I'm giving her even more of what they say
stalkers want, what they say encourages
them: attention.
Well, I hope she's happy now.
The feminine spirit which she believes
she defends has been fully avenged: I can't
live in my room; I've installed one of those
handy-dandy Caller ID boxes which I'll need
until I give in and have my number
changed; and, worst of all, my mom (and it's
all her fault for raising me to be so insensi
tive, right Skippy?) is seriously worried
about me and isn't sleeping.
I'm even spending afternoons in group
therapy with Madonna, Letterman and the
whole cast of "Cape Fear." Which isn't so
bad actuiilly — I was hoping to apply for
Letterman's writing staff anyway.
So there it is. Maybe things'll be better.
Maybe it'll only get worse. Maybe Skippy'll
call and say she's sorry and promise to stop
now.
And then maybe I can sleep in my room
again.

Congratulations, Raj. You 're a star.

I'M GONNA HAVE to hide now, because
of what I'm about to write. Because of
what I've already written.
I'm going to have to sleep in a different
room every night, constantly changing safe
houses, carrying a change of undies and a
toothbrush in the small pocket of my knap
sack.
You see, I'm being stalked. Followed,
bothered, hunted, watched over. By a
prank-caller with a letter-writing campaign
and a low threshold for Jews who write
about their sisters. And now I can no longer
feel safe at my own home, walking on the
street or peeing alone.
God, I wish I was making this up.
But the truth is that someone out there
took so much umbrage at a column I wrote
that she has taken it upon herself to violate
my boundaries several times a week. That
bit about my younger sister's exploding sex
uality and my own angst over it hit some
delicate nerve in this woman's psyche and a
small avalanche of privacy invasion ensued.
Thus an otherwise insignificant page
five piece began my tryst with Skippy. (I've
named this character "Skippy" after a bezit
ted 14-year-old boy who became so fixated
on my disinterested little sister that he
allied my father at work one day and asked
if it'd be okay if the two got married even
though they're still rather young and his job
prospects were poor. My father told him

he'd think about it.)
Skippy: An adult-sized My First Stalker.
I have to buy a bunny now just so when she
comes to my room to boil something she'll
leave my stereo alone.
Now, before I say anything else, I need to
point out that I'm fully aware what a bad
idea it is to be writing this. My residence
dean has already warned me that it's gener
ally considered unhelpful, if not bad form, to
agitate a stalker. The police said the same
thing.
But I find in myself a deep need to publi
cize this story anyway — even if it'll make
my single about as safe as Sarajevo for the
next few weeks. It's as if I need to fight back
against my nebulous, anonymous intruder
and this is my only way; as if I might recap
ture the upper hand by further risking my
safety and making Skippy's self-righteous
assaults as public as possible.
As if I think it'll make Skippy leave me
the hell alone.
So here goes:
It started with a letter. Labeled "To the
Parents of Michael Green," a clipped copy of
my "Sibling's sexcapades" column (Feb. 12)
was sent to my home in New York — no
return address.
At that point I admit I still thought it was
cool — a writer likes to know that his work
disturbs someone.
But then I considered what this message

meant. I got the feeling that sending the
copy was intended to punish me; as if to
inform my parents of what perversions
their son is up to; as if I didn't send three
copies of the same damn column home to
them myself.
Still, it was okay, it was just a letter.
But then things, as they tend to do in
those neat moments right before discomfort
becomes pain, got worse. The next day Skip
py called my parents.
"I want to discuss your son's article with
you," Skippy said. My father says it w.is
clearly a woman's voice.
She claimed she has children of her own
and, thus, found my article about adoles
cent exploration to be utterly offensive.
My father, using a brilliant "Well, you
know who I am, now why don't you tell
me who you are" technique tried to whee
dle Skippy into identifying herself. When
pressed for a phone number, she hung up.
Since that little call to my family, Skippy
and I have moved into a call-and-hang-up
routine that happens a few times a week,
often playing well past midnight. Once, I
picked up the phone to hear Skippy, in a fit
of adolescent creativity, playing the "I'll be
watching you" verse from The Police's
