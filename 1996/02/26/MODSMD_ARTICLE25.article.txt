## Cardinal takes it to Huskies, 71-56 Men cruise in final home game

Effort and heart are the
usual substitutes for cold
shooting. On Senior Night at
Maples Pavilion Saturday, no
one had a bigger heart than
Andy Poppink.
The senior from Tecumseh,
Mich., scored six points in a
game-turning 11-0 Stanford
run after the Huskies grabbed
their first and only lead of the
game at 38-37. The lead
change came on a four-point
play after an intentional foul
by Poppink, as Mark Sanford
made both free throws and
Jamie Booker converted a lay
in at the 14 minute, 16 second
mark.
But rather than let Wash
ington (14-9 overall, 7-7 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) stay in the
game, Stanford (17-1,10-5) ex
ploded over the next two min
utes by pushing the tempo and
getting Sanford and Husky
seven-footer Todd MacCulloch
to pick up their fourth fouls.

Washington head coach Bob
Bender was forced to sit his
two offensive threats for the
critical stretch of the game, as
Stanford pulled away for a 71-
56 win.
"At the start of the second
half, it took us losing the lead
to kick it up again," Poppink
said. "We battled, I guess is
what it came down to. We were
battling to get what we could."
Stanford shot under 40 per
cent for the third straight
game but held Washington to
43 percent, a marked differ
ence from the 60 percent
shooting it allowed Washing
ton State last Thursday.
Head coach Mike Mont
gomery said he was worried
the four-point play would bury
the Cardinal, but Stanford
showed a resiliency he hadn't
seen in the last two weeks. "I
think the emotional prepara
tion was obviously a little dif
ferent than the last couple of
games," he said.
Bender must have thought
his team had finally come out
of the funk that had plagued
the Huskies over their last six
games with the four-point
play. However, Washington
couldn't keep up the intensity
