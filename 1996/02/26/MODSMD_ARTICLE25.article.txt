## Cardinal takes it to Huskies, 71-56 Men cruise in final home game 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Stanford 71
Washington 56

Effort and heart are the
usual substitutes for cold
shooting. On Senior Night at
Maples Pavilion Saturday, no
one had a bigger heart than
Andy Poppink.
The senior from Tecumseh,
Mich., scored six points in a
game-turning 11-0 Stanford
run after the Huskies grabbed
their first and only lead of the
game at 38-37. The lead
change came on a four-point
play after an intentional foul
by Poppink, as Mark Sanford
made both free throws and
Jamie Booker converted a lay
in at the 14 minute, 16 second
mark.
But rather than let Wash
ington (14-9 overall, 7-7 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) stay in the
game, Stanford (17-1,10-5) ex
ploded over the next two min
utes by pushing the tempo and
getting Sanford and Husky
seven-footer Todd MacCulloch
to pick up their fourth fouls.

Washington head coach Bob
Bender was forced to sit his
two offensive threats for the
critical stretch of the game, as
Stanford pulled away for a 71-
56 win.
"At the start of the second
half, it took us losing the lead
to kick it up again," Poppink
said. "We battled, I guess is
what it came down to. We were
battling to get what we could."
Stanford shot under 40 per
cent for the third straight
game but held Washington to
43 percent, a marked differ
ence from the 60 percent
shooting it allowed Washing
ton State last Thursday.
Head coach Mike Mont
gomery said he was worried
the four-point play would bury
the Cardinal, but Stanford
showed a resiliency he hadn't
seen in the last two weeks. "I
think the emotional prepara
tion was obviously a little dif
ferent than the last couple of
games," he said.
Bender must have thought
his team had finally come out
of the funk that had plagued
the Huskies over their last six
games with the four-point
play. However, Washington
couldn't keep up the intensity

it used to erase a 31-23 halftime
deficit.
"They made the run that we
couldn't respond to and couldn't
recover from," Bender said. "We
had foul trouble from a few peo
ple throughout that time. Try
ing to stop their momentum was
tough without those guys on the
floor."
Washington was called for 27
personal fouls while Stanford
was whistled for only 13.
Poppink finished the game
with 21 points and a season-high
13 rebounds, eight offensive. He
led the Cardinal charge to the
free throw line, sinking 11 of 12.
For the game, Stanford scored
26 points from the line com
pared to Washington's seven.
"We were very aggressive at
point of attack and got to the
foul line as a result," Mont
gomery said.
With Brevin Knight's shoot
ing troubles continuing (2-for
-10 from the field), Montgomery
said he told his point guard to
focus instead on defense.
Knight responded by harass
ing Husky point guard Jason
Hamilton to an early seat on the
bench. Hamilton ended up play
ing only 18 minutes, scoring
three points and fouling out
with 5:32 left.
"It's a matter of what the
team needs on a given day,"
Knight said. "Tonight it was to
pressure their ball handlers and
get the ball to our guys."
Knight finished the game
with 10 points, seven rebounds
and five assists. He is four as
sists away from breaking the
school record for career assists,
currently held by Keith Ramee
at 513.
"We came out against Wash
ington State and weren't the ag
gressor," Knight said. "Tonight
we were [the aggressor] from
the tap, with Pop chasing it
down. We didn't make the shot,
but it showed we were ready to
play."
Seniors Poppink, Dion Cross,
David Harbour and Darren Ail
away played their final games in
Maples Pavilion Saturday, clos
ing out one of the longest chap
ters in Cardinal basketball his
tory. The four combined to play
431 games, starting 259.

Two surprise players were
suited up for the game in tribute
to the seniors. Junior Rich Jack
son, who tore his anterior cruci
ate ligament last week, sat on
the bench in warm-ups rather
than a shirt and tie while sopho
more Tim Young went through
warm-up drills for the first time
in 19 games.
"He wanted to do it for the se
niors, to feel more a part of the
team," Montgomery said. "It's
kind of lonely at the end of the
bench in the tie."
"I told Tim and I told Rich
that if I grabbed them to go in to
say no and not go in," Mont
gomery said. "Knowing Rich, he
probably would have gone in
even if his leg was it two parts."

Along with sending the se
niors off with a win, the victory
over Washington was vital to the
bigger NCAA tournament pic
ture. Stanford is currently tied
with Cal for third in the confer
ence, and it is questionable
whether three or four teams
from the Pac-10 will make it
into the NCAA Tournament.
Seedings for the tournament
will be announced Sunday,
March 10.
"It was a huge win for us,"
Montgomery said. "If we didn't
get this one it was going to be a
tough situation. I thought our
mental preparation was great."
Stanford plays Cal Sunday at
Harmon Gym and both teams
head to Arizona in two weeks.

to kick it up again," Poppink
said. "We battled, I guess is
what it came down to. We were
battling to get what we could."
Stanford shot under 40 per
cent for the third straight
game but held Washington to
43 percent, a marked differ
ence from the 60 percent
shooting it allowed Washing
ton State last Thursday.
Head coach Mike Mont
gomery said he was worried
the four-point play would bury
the Cardinal, but Stanford
showed a resiliency he hadn't
seen in the last two weeks. "I
think the emotional prepara
tion was obviously a little dif
ferent than the last couple of
games," he said.
Bender must have thought
his team had finally come out
of the funk that had plagued
the Huskies over their last six
games with the four-point
play. However, Washington
couldn't keep up the intensity

it used to erase a 31-23 halftime
deficit.
"They made the run that we
couldn't respond to and couldn't
recover from," Bender said. "We
had foul trouble from a few peo
ple throughout that time. Try
ing to stop their momentum was
tough without those guys on the
floor."
Washington was called for 27
personal fouls while Stanford
was whistled for only 13.
Poppink finished the game
with 21 points and a season-high
13 rebounds, eight offensive. He
led the Cardinal charge to the
free throw line, sinking 11 of 12.
For the game, Stanford scored
26 points from the line com
pared to Washington's seven.
"We were very aggressive at
point of attack and got to the
foul line as a result," Mont
gomery said.
With Brevin Knight's shoot
ing troubles continuing (2-for
-10 from the field), Montgomery
said he told his point guard to
focus instead on defense.
Knight responded by harass
ing Husky point guard Jason
Hamilton to an early seat on the
bench. Hamilton ended up play
ing only 18 minutes, scoring
three points and fouling out
with 5:32 left.
"It's a matter of what the
team needs on a given day,"
Knight said. "Tonight it was to
pressure their ball handlers and
get the ball to our guys."
Knight finished the game
with 10 points, seven rebounds
and five assists. He is four as
sists away from breaking the
school record for career assists,
currently held by Keith Ramee
at 513.
"We came out against Wash
ington State and weren't the ag
gressor," Knight said. "Tonight
we were [the aggressor] from
the tap, with Pop chasing it
down. We didn't make the shot,
but it showed we were ready to
play."
Seniors Poppink, Dion Cross,
David Harbour and Darren Ail
away played their final games in
Maples Pavilion Saturday, clos
ing out one of the longest chap
ters in Cardinal basketball his
tory. The four combined to play
431 games, starting 259.

Two surprise players were
suited up for the game in tribute
to the seniors. Junior Rich Jack
son, who tore his anterior cruci
ate ligament last week, sat on
the bench in warm-ups rather
than a shirt and tie while sopho
more Tim Young went through
warm-up drills for the first time
in 19 games.
"He wanted to do it for the se
niors, to feel more a part of the
team," Montgomery said. "It's
kind of lonely at the end of the
bench in the tie."
"I told Tim and I told Rich
that if I grabbed them to go in to
say no and not go in," Mont
gomery said. "Knowing Rich, he
probably would have gone in
even if his leg was it two parts."

Along with sending the se
niors off with a win, the victory
over Washington was vital to the
bigger NCAA tournament pic
ture. Stanford is currently tied
with Cal for third in the confer
ence, and it is questionable
whether three or four teams
from the Pac-10 will make it
into the NCAA Tournament.
Seedings for the tournament
will be announced Sunday,
March 10.
"It was a huge win for us,"
Montgomery said. "If we didn't
get this one it was going to be a
tough situation. I thought our
mental preparation was great."
Stanford plays Cal Sunday at
Harmon Gym and both teams
head to Arizona in two weeks.
