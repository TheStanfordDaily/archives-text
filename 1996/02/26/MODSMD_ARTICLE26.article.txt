# Fittingly, Poppink shines on Senior Night
## 
### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
Reeling in the midst of a two-game losing
streak with defeats to the likes of Oregon and
Washington State, the Stanford men's basket
ball team needed to step up in a big way in Sat
urday's Pacific 10 Conference matchup against
Washington, a team the Cardinal had lost to
earlier in the season. With its back against the
wall and a snarling Husky team in front of
them, Stanford came up big in disposing Wash
ington, 71-56.
On an emotional Senior Night — with four
Cardinal seniors playing their last game at
Maples Pavilion — who should rise to the top
but Stanford's elder statesman, forward Andy

Poppink.
"When you have a team like Stanford, you
know that the toughness and the leadership
that they have from their upperclassmen is
going to rise, and you hope it's not against you
on that day, and I think that's what you saw
today," said Washington head coach Bob Ben
der.
What the Cardinal faithful saw was Poppink
doing what he's done all season. Starting in his
80th game, Poppink put together an exception
al 21-point, 13-rebound performance to lead the
Stanford charge. More impressive was that
Poppink also drew the tough defensive assign
ment of guarding high-rising sophomore for
ward Mark San ford, who came in averaging
17.5 points and 6.4 rebounds a game for the

Huskies.
Coming off a subpar outing versus Washing
ton State and the Cougars' Mark Hendrickson,
Poppink had his work cut out for him against
Sanford, who lit up the Cardinal for 24 points in
their previous meeting on Jan. 25. But right
from the start, Poppink played with fire in his
belly, hustling down court in the game's open
ing seconds to battle for an errant tipped ball.
After that, the six-foot-seven forward mus
cled, battled and bruised his way to one of his
best performances ever. Poppink consistently
pounded the Washington interior, forcing San
ford to pick up his fourth foul with 14 minutes
still left in the game. Poppink also hit 5 of 13
shots from the field, mostly off mini
turnarounds in the lane and hard
fought lay-ins. But where Poppink
did the most damage offensively was
at the free throw line and on the
glass.
The senior leader converted on 11
of 12 attempts from the charity
stripe and collected eight offensive
rebounds. One of Stanford's most
consistent performers on the
boards, Poppink's 13 rebounds
against the Huskies puts him at
10th place on the Stanford career re
bounding list with 620 caroms.
The muscular Michigan native
also put in a workmanlike effort on
the defensive side of the ball, bump
ing and sticking to Sanford all night
long and allowing the Huskie for
ward just 14 points and four re
bounds.
"It was a key matchup with Andy
guarding Sanford," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery. "We
also felt that we had to exploit that
matchup as far as us trying to get the
ball to Andy a little bit — maybe
cause some problems foul-wise —
and we were able to do that.
"Poppink responded. He's a good
free-throw shooter. He took it up

strong inside and had some really
nice rebounds for us. We had to have
that. We simply had to have some
body step up and have a game. And
that's been consistent of when we've
won in the past, and consistent with
what we have to do in the future."
Poppink has been one of the Car
dinal's most consistent performers
all season. Entering the contest
against Washington averaging 14
points and 8 rebounds per game as
well as shooting 51.3 percent from
the floor, Stanford knew it could
count on Poppink for a solid perfor
mance. But what the Cardinal got on
a very special Senior's Night was an
extra-special performance from
Poppink.
"It was a little bit different than
just being our straight-up last game
because we still do have quite a bit of
basketball left to play and hopefully
more than the three games left on
our schedule," Poppink said. "Obvi
ously, it's a very special thing to all of
us seniors and for the rest of the
team because we've worked so hard.
This is a very special place to play.
We are proud of the fact that we have
played well at home and that we
have good crowd support, so it was a
special moment. But then again we
weren't completely overwhelmed
because there are still games to be
played."
And with those games, there will

come more special moments and
special performances.

Reeling in the midst of a two-game losing
streak with defeats to the likes of Oregon and
Washington State, the Stanford men's basket
ball team needed to step up in a big way in Sat
urday's Pacific 10 Conference matchup against
Washington, a team the Cardinal had lost to
earlier in the season. With its back against the
wall and a snarling Husky team in front of
them, Stanford came up big in disposing Wash
ington, 71-56.
On an emotional Senior Night — with four
Cardinal seniors playing their last game at
Maples Pavilion — who should rise to the top
but Stanford's elder statesman, forward Andy

Poppink.
"When you have a team like Stanford, you
know that the toughness and the leadership
that they have from their upperclassmen is
going to rise, and you hope it's not against you
on that day, and I think that's what you saw
today," said Washington head coach Bob Ben
der.
What the Cardinal faithful saw was Poppink
doing what he's done all season. Starting in his
80th game, Poppink put together an exception
al 21-point, 13-rebound performance to lead the
Stanford charge. More impressive was that
Poppink also drew the tough defensive assign
ment of guarding high-rising sophomore for
ward Mark San ford, who came in averaging
17.5 points and 6.4 rebounds a game for the

Huskies.
Coming off a subpar outing versus Washing
ton State and the Cougars' Mark Hendrickson,
Poppink had his work cut out for him against
Sanford, who lit up the Cardinal for 24 points in
their previous meeting on Jan. 25. But right
from the start, Poppink played with fire in his
belly, hustling down court in the game's open
ing seconds to battle for an errant tipped ball.
After that, the six-foot-seven forward mus
cled, battled and bruised his way to one of his
best performances ever. Poppink consistently
pounded the Washington interior, forcing San
ford to pick up his fourth foul with 14 minutes
still left in the game. Poppink also hit 5 of 13
shots from the field, mostly off mini
turnarounds in the lane and hard
fought lay-ins. But where Poppink
did the most damage offensively was
at the free throw line and on the
glass.
The senior leader converted on 11
of 12 attempts from the charity
stripe and collected eight offensive
rebounds. One of Stanford's most
consistent performers on the
boards, Poppink's 13 rebounds
against the Huskies puts him at
10th place on the Stanford career re
bounding list with 620 caroms.
The muscular Michigan native
also put in a workmanlike effort on
the defensive side of the ball, bump
ing and sticking to Sanford all night
long and allowing the Huskie for
ward just 14 points and four re
bounds.
"It was a key matchup with Andy
guarding Sanford," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery. "We
also felt that we had to exploit that
matchup as far as us trying to get the
ball to Andy a little bit — maybe
cause some problems foul-wise —
and we were able to do that.
"Poppink responded. He's a good
free-throw shooter. He took it up

strong inside and had some really
nice rebounds for us. We had to have
that. We simply had to have some
body step up and have a game. And
that's been consistent of when we've
won in the past, and consistent with
what we have to do in the future."
Poppink has been one of the Car
dinal's most consistent performers
all season. Entering the contest
against Washington averaging 14
points and 8 rebounds per game as
well as shooting 51.3 percent from
the floor, Stanford knew it could
count on Poppink for a solid perfor
mance. But what the Cardinal got on
a very special Senior's Night was an
extra-special performance from
Poppink.
"It was a little bit different than
just being our straight-up last game
because we still do have quite a bit of
basketball left to play and hopefully
more than the three games left on
our schedule," Poppink said. "Obvi
ously, it's a very special thing to all of
us seniors and for the rest of the
team because we've worked so hard.
This is a very special place to play.
We are proud of the fact that we have
played well at home and that we
have good crowd support, so it was a
special moment. But then again we
weren't completely overwhelmed
because there are still games to be
played."
And with those games, there will

come more special moments and
special performances.
