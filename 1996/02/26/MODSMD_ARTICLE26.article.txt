Reeling in the midst of a two-game losing
streak with defeats to the likes of Oregon and
Washington State, the Stanford men's basket
ball team needed to step up in a big way in Sat
urday's Pacific 10 Conference matchup against
Washington, a team the Cardinal had lost to
earlier in the season. With its back against the
wall and a snarling Husky team in front of
them, Stanford came up big in disposing Wash

17.5 points and 6.4 rebounds a game for the

Huskies.
Coming off a subpar outing versus Washing
ton State and the Cougars' Mark Hendrickson,
Poppink had his work cut out for him against
Sanford, who lit up the Cardinal for 24 points in
their previous meeting on Jan. 25. But right
from the start, Poppink played with fire in his
belly, hustling down court in the game's open
ing seconds to battle for an errant tipped ball.
After that, the six-foot-seven forward mus
cled, battled and bruised his way to one of his
best performances ever. Poppink consistently
pounded the Washington interior, forcing San
ford to pick up his fourth foul with 14 minutes
still left in the game. Poppink also hit 5 of 13
