### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
At 6-1, the fifth-ranked Stan
ford men's volleyball team ap
peared ready to make a statement
this weekend against Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation rivals
UCLA and UC-Santa Barbara.
Unfortunately, they made the
wrong statement.
In a surprisingly poor perfor
mance against UCLA, the Cardi
nal spikers were swept out of
Burnham on Friday night 15-9,
15-11, 15-5. To make matters
worse, they lost junior middle
blocker Brian Moore due to a foot
injury. He was sorely missed last
night as the Gauchos defeated the
Cardinal 15-12, 15-5, 15-12 at
Santa Barbara. The losses
dropped them to 6-3 in the Pacific
Division and seriously jeopardized
their chances of winning the divi
sion title.
"The difference was hitting the

bails out of bounds," said head
coach Ruben Nieves. "You can't
hit balls out of bounds and expect
to win. But it's too early to change
our goals [of winning our division].
We haven't seen a team yet that is
unbeatable."
The largest crowd of the season
streamed into Burnham on Friday
night to witness a hotly-contested
match between two league heavy
weights. Game one began quickly
enough, as Moore's blocks forged a
4-4 deadlock. But that was the
high point of the game, as hitting
errors began to take its toll. Eight
of the Cardinal's 13 game one er
rors led directly to Bruin points.
Fuerbringer tried to rally his team
back as his block and kill closed the
gap to 14-7. However, the Cardinal
forced one out of bounds on game
point to give UCLA a one-game
lead.
The second game provided
more hitting errors by the Cardi
nal as they spotted UCLA a three

point lead. Two straight blocks by
the Bruins' sophomore quick hit
ter Tom Still well put Stanford in a
5-0 hole. The Cardinal pulled with
in one at 5-4, but the Bruins
stretched their lead again and
Nieves decided to shake things up
by substituting in freshman swing
hitter Patrick Klein. He quickly
scored an ace to make it 8-5.
"I saw it as a great opportunity
to try to give the team a little
spark," Klein said.
Sure enough, a kill by Moore
and three by Fuerbringer knotted
matters up at nine. But errors did
the Cardinal in once again. Despite
the efforts of sophomore swing hit
ter Tad Hoffman — playing mid
dle blocker for the injured Moore
— and Fuerbringer, UCI.A took
the second game as two straight
Stanford errors closed the game
out.
The Bruins decided to put the
