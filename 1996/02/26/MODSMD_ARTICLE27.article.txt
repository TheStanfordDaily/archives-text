# Spikers get blanked twice Volleyball goes O-for-weekend
## 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
At 6-1, the fifth-ranked Stan
ford men's volleyball team ap
peared ready to make a statement
this weekend against Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation rivals
UCLA and UC-Santa Barbara.
Unfortunately, they made the
wrong statement.
In a surprisingly poor perfor
mance against UCLA, the Cardi
nal spikers were swept out of
Burnham on Friday night 15-9,
15-11, 15-5. To make matters
worse, they lost junior middle
blocker Brian Moore due to a foot
injury. He was sorely missed last
night as the Gauchos defeated the
Cardinal 15-12, 15-5, 15-12 at
Santa Barbara. The losses
dropped them to 6-3 in the Pacific
Division and seriously jeopardized
their chances of winning the divi
sion title.
"The difference was hitting the

bails out of bounds," said head
coach Ruben Nieves. "You can't
hit balls out of bounds and expect
to win. But it's too early to change
our goals [of winning our division].
We haven't seen a team yet that is
unbeatable."
The largest crowd of the season
streamed into Burnham on Friday
night to witness a hotly-contested
match between two league heavy
weights. Game one began quickly
enough, as Moore's blocks forged a
4-4 deadlock. But that was the
high point of the game, as hitting
errors began to take its toll. Eight
of the Cardinal's 13 game one er
rors led directly to Bruin points.
Fuerbringer tried to rally his team
back as his block and kill closed the
gap to 14-7. However, the Cardinal
forced one out of bounds on game
point to give UCLA a one-game
lead.
The second game provided
more hitting errors by the Cardi
nal as they spotted UCLA a three

point lead. Two straight blocks by
the Bruins' sophomore quick hit
ter Tom Still well put Stanford in a
5-0 hole. The Cardinal pulled with
in one at 5-4, but the Bruins
stretched their lead again and
Nieves decided to shake things up
by substituting in freshman swing
hitter Patrick Klein. He quickly
scored an ace to make it 8-5.
"I saw it as a great opportunity
to try to give the team a little
spark," Klein said.
Sure enough, a kill by Moore
and three by Fuerbringer knotted
matters up at nine. But errors did
the Cardinal in once again. Despite
the efforts of sophomore swing hit
ter Tad Hoffman — playing mid
dle blocker for the injured Moore
— and Fuerbringer, UCI.A took
the second game as two straight
Stanford errors closed the game
out.
The Bruins decided to put the
stunned crowd out of its misery
quickly as they raced out to a 9-0 lead
in game three. Klein responded with
an ace while junior middle blocker
Mike Hoefer and sophomore middle
blocker Keenan Whitehurst added
blocks. But it was too little, too late
as Fuerbringer ended the match by
forcing a kill attempt into the net for
Stanford's 37th, and final, hitting
error of the night.
"That was the worst we've played
all season," Nieves said. "I'm also
disappointed because UCLA didn't
play very well." Indeed, aside from
hitting percentage (only .168 for the
Cardinal), the Bruins were outdone
in every statistical category.
"It was really frustrating for the
guys because of the traditional rival
ry between Stanford and UCLA,"
Klein said. "We're all sort of ready to
move on and focus positively."
Without the services of Moore,
the Cardinal spikers traveled down
to Santa Barbara yesterday after
noon hoping to bounce back against
the fifth-ranked Gauchos. While
they were able to cut down on their
hitting errors, Santa Barbara was
more efficient in their overall hit
ting, leading to a three-game Gaucho
victory.
Riding the inspired performances
of junior setter Stewart Chong and
Fuerbringer, the Cardinal spikers
were able to stay close throughout
game one. However, Santa Barbara
sophomore outside hitters Jeremy
Darner and Bob Hefty put several
kills down to help the Gauchos hold
off Stanford 15-12.
The Gauchos played an efficient
game two to quickly put Stanford
away 15-5. Even though Stanford
registered 26 kills with only nine er
rors, the Gauchos were even better
with a blistering 28 kills on only
three errors. The Cardinal also had
trouble taking care of the ball, as the
team finished with 18 unblocked er
rors.
Game three produced another
close finish. But without the pres
ence of Moore in the middle, the
Gauchos' constant offensive barrage
could not be held back effectively, as
Santa Barbara recorded over a third
of its 76 kills in game three, with se
nior outside hitter Doug Hughes
leading the charge. Stanford was
only able to muster eight team
blocks on the night as Santa Barbara
completed the three-sweep over the
Cardinal spikers.
