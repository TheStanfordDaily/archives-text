# Byer, Olberhelman qualify for Trials
## 
### Ratha Harntha Staff writer 
With the regular season behind them
and only the championship meets in
March to look forward to, the women's
swimming team took to the waters at
the Stanford Invitational Time Trials
this weekend with just one objective in
mind â€” qualifying swimmers for the
U.S. Olympic Trials in Indianapolis next
month. Consider it another mission ac
complished for the Cardinal, as sopho
mores Evi-Lynn Byer and Amy Oberhel
man recorded times that earned them
spots in the 200-meter backstroke and
the 200-meter freestyle, respectively, at
the trials, which take place March 6-12.
"I'm really excited," said Byer, who
failed to qualify as a high school student
four years ago by .02 seconds. "I'm going
for experience. I'm going to have fun and
watch [some of her teammates] make
the Olympic team. I believe I can swim

fast at the Olympic Trials and maybe
sneak into the [NCAA Champi
onships]."
Along with qualifying two more
swimmers for Olympic Trials, the Cardi

nal also saw the return of junior
Michelle Jesperson, who dislocated her
shoulder three weeks ago. The injury
forced her to miss the Pacific 10 Cham
pionships on Feb. 15-17. Last Friday
was the first time that Jesperson had
competed in a race since sustaining her
injury.
"There's some pain, but I'm a lot
more confident," the junior said. "I still
had some aggravation but I'm ready to
push through it fat the trials]."
Despite the injury, Jesperson quali
fied for the 200-meter freestyle and
made the consideration time in the 100-
meter freestyle. She has yet to qualify
for the NCAA Championships in either
event but is confident that she will swim
fast enough to earn herself a spot.

event's consideration time must
wait for the results of other meets
around the country this past

weekend to find out if their times
are good enough to qualify. Ath
letes who are going to the
Olympic Trails will have one
more opportunity to make the
NCAA Championships if they
have not already done so.
The team now has two weeks

before the Olympic Trials and
will keep an emphasis on staying
rested, said sophomore Becky
Bisknell.
"I think everybody on the
Stanford team is ready to swim
fast [at the Olympic Trials]," Jes
