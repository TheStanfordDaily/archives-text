SEATTLE, Wash. - The last
time Stanford and Washington
met, Cardinal junior point guard
Jamila Wideman enjoyed a career
performance, with all 18 of her
points coming in the second half.
Yesterday, she matched that and
threw in nine more before the break
as No. 4 Stanford (22-2,15-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) clinched the Pac
-10 title outright with a 59-54 victo
ry over Washington (14-11,8-6).
Wideman almost single-handed
ly crippled the Huskies' tourna

merit hopes by scoring seven of
Stanford's nine second-half field
goals, including all four in the final
eight minutes. Her second-half
heroics offset a 41-30 Washington
rebounding edge and 24 more
Husky field goal attempts. Stanford
was held to a season-low 43 tries
from the field and Washington se
cured 19 offensive boards, the most
by a Stanford opponent this season.
"I think Stanford should thank
God for Jamila Wideman," said
Washington coach Chris Gobrecht.
"Without her they're not even in
this game. I thought we outplayed
them in every other aspect."
Wideman shattered her old ca
reer high of 19 points at a key junc
ture, driving by Husky counterpart
Laure Savasta for a lay-up and a
foul with four minutes, 52 seconds
remaining. The three-point play
ended a 6-1 Washington run that
had cut Stanford's advantage to 47-
45.
Savasta and Wideman dueled
throughout most of the second half,
clearly the go-to players for both
squads. Savasta finished with a
team-high 20 points, but struggled
at the end with clutch misses.
After Wideman sandwiched an
other driving lay-up between Wash
ington scores, Savasta drove by
Wideman after a vicious high
screen, and got the basket and a
foul from junior Kate Starbird. Her
free throw tied the contest at 52-52
with 1:54 to play.
Stanford called time out in the
backcourt, but the Huskies' stifling
defense kept the Cardinal from a
good shot. With the shot clock tick
ing away, Wideman dribbled well
behind the arc and fired a 24-footer
from straightaway just before the
buzzer. Her third three oftfete game

stunned the Hec Edmundson Pavil
ion crowd of 6,074 and gave Stan
ford the lead it would never relin
quish.
"That was a huge shot to make,"
Wideman said. "I was out of op
tions. Both Laure Savasta and
Shannon Kelly turned toward me
and rolled their eyes. They knew
that shot was a back-breaker."
The two squads spent much of
the game trying to break each
other's backs. No strangers to phys
ical play themselves, the Huskies
still believed Cardinal players were
too rough.
"They're the most physical team
I've ever seen," Gobrecht said.
"They basically just beat the crud
out of you."
By winning, Stanford earned its
fifth straight victory over the
Huskies — its longest streak ever
over Washington. Stanford's 16th
straight victory also moved the cur
rent win streak to third-best in
school history. The Cardinal ended
its road slate 11-2, with 14 consecu
tive conference road wins dating to
last season, one shy of the Pac-10
standard. jlJll
