SEATTLE, Wash. - The last
time Stanford and Washington
met, Cardinal junior point guard
Jamila Wideman enjoyed a career
performance, with all 18 of her
points coming in the second half.
Yesterday, she matched that and
threw in nine more before the break
as No. 4 Stanford (22-2,15-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) clinched the Pac
-10 title outright with a 59-54 victo
ry over Washington (14-11,8-6).
Wideman almost single-handed
ly crippled the Huskies' tourna

merit hopes by scoring seven of
Stanford's nine second-half field
goals, including all four in the final
eight minutes. Her second-half
heroics offset a 41-30 Washington
rebounding edge and 24 more
Husky field goal attempts. Stanford
was held to a season-low 43 tries
from the field and Washington se
cured 19 offensive boards, the most
by a Stanford opponent this season.
"I think Stanford should thank
God for Jamila Wideman," said
Washington coach Chris Gobrecht.
"Without her they're not even in
this game. I thought we outplayed
them in every other aspect."
Wideman shattered her old ca
reer high of 19 points at a key junc
ture, driving by Husky counterpart
Laure Savasta for a lay-up and a
foul with four minutes, 52 seconds
