# Probing criminal justice

### Jessica Lehman 
Judges, law professors and lawyers de
bated the jury system and the expansion of
federal criminal law PViday and Saturday
at the Federalist Society's 15th annual
student symposium.
Students, professors and attorneys from
Harvard and Yale Law Schools, as well as
from dozens of other schools, attended the
weekend symposium, entitled "Justice and
the Criminal Justice Process."
The symposium consisted of six panels
dealing with self-incrimination, race, evi
dentiary rules, juries, the adversarial sys
tem and the federalization of crimes.
Stanford Law Prof, and U.S. Rep.
Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., moderated a
panel on "Juries and the Criminal Justice
System: What Role?"
Stanford Law Prof. Barbara Babcock

opened the panel by voicing strong support
for the unanimous, 12-person jury system.
"The criminal jury, right or wrong, is
one of our most precious and characteristi
cally American institutions," Babcock said.
She called our current jury system "one of
the fundamental parts of liberty," in that
every juror counts equally, regardless of
race, class or gender.
The other panelists — Santa Clara Law
School Prof. Gerald Uelmen, who was on
O.J. Simpson's defense team, Prof. Richard
Willard of Georgetown University Law
Center and attorney Daniel Collins from
the U.S. Department of Justice — all
agreed with the idea of a jury system, de
spite increasing public dissatisfaction with
it, particularly in the wake of the Simpson
and Rodney King cases.
Willard, however, said some
changes might be necessary.
"Our jury system does not work
well in either criminal or civil
cases," he said.

If the price we have
to pay for being free
from street crimes is
that we are then sub
ject to deprivation of
liberty from law en
forcement officials,
then we haven't got
ten anywhere.'
— Nadine Strossen

He said he believes that the
current system excludes from
serving on juries those who are
well-educated and well-informed,
those who he calls the most quali
fied to be jurors.
Willard proposed abolishing
peremptory challenges which
allow lawyers to excuse jurors
without reason, eliminating alter
nate jurors, limiting the time a
case takes, paying jurors enough
to eliminate financial difficulty as
a reason not to serve, excusingju
rors who take part in jury nullifi

cation and replacing the require
ment of unanimity with a super
majority, meaning that agree
ment of most of the jurors would
be sufficient.
"It's not a perfect institution,
it's a human institution, one
that's subject to improvement,"
Babcock said.
Collins, however, urged the au
dience to remember that "we have
a jury because we think that hav
ing 12 average people, picked at
random... is a process that is bet
ter intended to secure accurate
fact-finding."
Nadine Strossen, president of
the American Civil Liberties
Union, appeared in the last panel
of the symposium with Willard. A
heated debate ensued about the
expansion of federal criminal law,
with increased federalization of
crimes leading to increased num
bers of federal police.
Strossen argued that the feder
alization of crimes results in more
abuses of our liberties by police,
such as increased no-knock entry,
entrapment and use of military
units because federal police offi
cials are not held nearly as ac
countable as local and state offi
cials.
"The exponential growth of
federal law enforcement has not
been accompanied by any serious
oversight," she said. "If the price
we have to pay for being free from
street crimes is that we are then
subject to deprivation of liberty
from law enforcement officials,
then we haven't gotten any
where."
Willard did not see the expan-

sion of federal law as a problem.
He spoke of the nation's high level
of crime.
"Crime is a national problem
and requires a national solution,"
Willard said. "It is a much greater
threat to America to be victimized
by crime than by law enforce
ment."
"What I'm in favor of is a na
tional strategy to deal with crime
that is directed at a federal level,"
Willard said, "a national strategy

to make the fight against crime
much more effective."
Strossen countered by saying
the national crime rate is actually
dropping. She declared that acts
of crime by police and law enforce
ment officials "have exactly the
same impact" as those committed
by common criminals. They both
instill fear, Strossen said,
whether it is fear of strangers or
of those meant to protect us.
