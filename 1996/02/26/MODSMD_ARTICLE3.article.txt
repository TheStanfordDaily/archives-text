Judges, law professors and lawyers de
bated the jury system and the expansion of
federal criminal law PViday and Saturday
at the Federalist Society's 15th annual
student symposium.
Students, professors and attorneys from
Harvard and Yale Law Schools, as well as
from dozens of other schools, attended the
weekend symposium, entitled "Justice and
the Criminal Justice Process."
The symposium consisted of six panels
dealing with self-incrimination, race, evi
dentiary rules, juries, the adversarial sys
tem and the federalization of crimes.
Stanford Law Prof, and U.S. Rep.
Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., moderated a
panel on "Juries and the Criminal Justice
System: What Role?"
Stanford Law Prof. Barbara Babcock

opened the panel by voicing strong support
for the unanimous, 12-person jury system.
"The criminal jury, right or wrong, is
one of our most precious and characteristi
cally American institutions," Babcock said.
She called our current jury system "one of
the fundamental parts of liberty," in that
every juror counts equally, regardless of
race, class or gender.
The other panelists — Santa Clara Law
School Prof. Gerald Uelmen, who was on
O.J. Simpson's defense team, Prof. Richard
Willard of Georgetown University Law
Center and attorney Daniel Collins from
the U.S. Department of Justice — all
agreed with the idea of a jury system, de
spite increasing public dissatisfaction with
it, particularly in the wake of the Simpson
and Rodney King cases.
