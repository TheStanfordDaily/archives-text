# Cardinal stumbles again
## Baseball drops two of three to Bruins 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Despite a seventh-inning rally
highlighted by back-to-back
home runs by senior Brian Dal
limore and sophomore Jon Scha
effer, the No. 5 Stanford baseball
team fell to No. 6 UCLA yester
day by a score of 7-5 at the Bru
ins' Jackie Robinson Stadium.
The Cardinal (10-7 overall, 1-
2 Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division) managed a victory
Saturday behind a masterful
pitching performance by fresh
man Jeff Austin, but lost the se
ries to the Bruins (11-5, 2-1) two
games to one. UCLA is the first
team to win a three-game series
from Stanford this season.
Yesterday, timely two-out hit
ting by the Bruins hurt the Car
dinal. In the first and third in
nings, UCLA scored runs after
two batters were retired by Stan
ford starter Mario Iglesias (1-1).
Two baserunning miscues might
also have cost the Cardinal a

chance to take the rubber game
of the series.
The first came early, when
Troy Kent was caught off second
base for the first out of the sec
ond inning. Stanford scored
three runs in the inning after
Kent was erased. The second
misfortune on the basepaths
came late in the contest, and may
have been more damaging to the
Cardinal hopes. Trailing 6-5 in
the seventh, Stanford put men
on first and third with one out. A
tricky move by Bruin pitcher
Kevin Sheredy, however, picked
freshman Jody Gerut off first
base, and the Cardinal failed to
score again.
Saturday, Austin (3-1, 0.84
earned run average) sailed
through a scenario which is be
coming a common occurrence for
the right-hander from King
wood, Texas. Austin notched the
first complete game of his young
collegiate career, giving up one
run while scattering six hits in a
9-1 Cardinal triumph. The fresh
man added 13 strikeouts to raise
his conference-best total to 47 in
only 32 innings.
"I approached this game the
way I approached the last one
too," said Austin, who tossed 7

1/3 shutout innings last week in
Fresno. "I want to give the team
the opportunity to win. I go out
every time with the mind-set
that I'm going to keep them
close."
Austin has had plenty of help
making the adjustment to the
college game, for which he said
he is grateful.
"I'm still learning from Kyle
Peterson, Mario (Iglesias), Bren
dan Sullivan and Tom Reimers

— how they approach the game,"
Austin said. "I can't afford to get
too confident, especially being a
freshman. They keep me in
line."
Second baseman Eric Sees led
the Stanford bats, driving in
four runs, while Schaeffer belted
out four hits on the afternoon.
Senior A.J. Hinch, who returned
to the lineup this weekend after
missing five games with a shoul
der injury, belted his team-lead

ing fourth home run of the sea
son and drove a double to the
fence.
Friday night, the Cardinal
dropped a heartbreaker to the
Bruins, 6-5. Stanford put up
four runs in the opening inning,
but UCLA took a 5-4 lead after
scoring four runs off Cardinal
starter Kyle Peterson (2-3) in
the fifth.
Stanford tied the contest at
five with a single tally in the
sixth, but the Bruins took the
lead for good with a run in the
bottom of the eighth. Kent (3-
for-4, RBI) and Dallimore (2-for
5, 2 RBIs) led the Cardinal offen
sively.
While Stanford has had Hinch
and pitcher Jason Middlebrook
out of the lineup in recent
games, the team looks to adjust
and simply to continue to hit and
pitch with consistency.
"I think we have to stick with
it no matter what, no matter
who is injured," Austin said.
"Any team we play will be up to
play Stanford whether we're
ranked No. 1 or No. 101. Wehave
to be up to play every game just
like they are going to be up to
play us."
Stanford will play its first
home game in over two weeks
when Nevada visits the Farm
Tuesday. The Wolfpack, ranked
No. 15 by Collegiate Baseball,
will meet the Cardinal at 2 p.m.
at Sunken Diamond.
