# Cardinal stumbles again
## Baseball drops two of three to Bruins 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Despite a seventh-inning rally
highlighted by back-to-back
home runs by senior Brian Dal
limore and sophomore Jon Scha
effer, the No. 5 Stanford baseball
team fell to No. 6 UCLA yester
day by a score of 7-5 at the Bru
ins' Jackie Robinson Stadium.
The Cardinal (10-7 overall, 1-
2 Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division) managed a victory
Saturday behind a masterful
pitching performance by fresh
man Jeff Austin, but lost the se

games to one. UCLA is the first

from Stanford this season.
Yesterday, timely two-out hit
ting by the Bruins hurt the Car

nings, UCLA scored runs after
two batters were retired by Stan
ford starter Mario Iglesias (1-1).
Two baserunning miscues might
also have cost the Cardinal a

chance to take the rubber game
of the series.
The first came early, when
Troy Kent was caught off second
base for the first out of the sec
ond inning. Stanford scored
three runs in the inning after
Kent was erased. The second
misfortune on the basepaths
came late in the contest, and may
have been more damaging to the
Cardinal hopes. Trailing 6-5 in
the seventh, Stanford put men
on first and third with one out. A
tricky move by Bruin pitcher
Kevin Sheredy, however, picked
freshman Jody Gerut off first
base, and the Cardinal failed to
score again.
Saturday, Austin (3-1, 0.84
earned run average) sailed
through a scenario which is be
coming a common occurrence for
the right-hander from King
wood, Texas. Austin notched the
first complete game of his young
collegiate career, giving up one
