finish in all six events and sweep
ing the all-around competition.
In the team's first meet without

fore the last meet at San Jose,
Stanford scored 222.75 points
overall, eclipsing Santa Barbara's
total of 208.3 and San Jose's 207.9
score.
"I was really happy with the en
ergy the team had yesterday," said
senior team captain Peter Hegi,
who won the high bar. "It was a lot
more than in the other two meets
we've had. After losing Tim two
weeks ago, we've re "My had to take
it to another level. 1 . iple are pick
ing up more skills and some people
are doing new events. It's not like a

negative — it's more of a rally cry.
"The younger guys had a lot
more fight; they tended to stay on
the equipment even when they
were on the verge of falling off," he
added.
While this weekend's score was
lower than the Cardinal's last

score 0f224.1 in a meet at San Jose
State two weeks ago, it was higher
than the team's first competition
score of 220.45, also at San Jose.
In addition to Hegi's victory,

took first on both the rings and
vault, junior Jamie Ellis earned a
victory on the parallel bars and
sophomore Jeremy Herman won
the pommel horse.
Hegi scored a 9.5 on the high
bar to take first, over teammate
Keith Wiley (9.35) and Santa Bar
bara's Reid Holbrook (9.3). "Per
sonally I was happy with my per
formance," he said. "I was very
comfortable with my events — it
felt just like practice. I think final

ly this year 1 have learned to com
pete."
The team showed improve
ment everywhere with each indi
vidual contributing to the team ef
fort. Freshman Scott Finklestein,
out previously with a wrist injury,
competed for the first time this
season.
"As a team in general, we're all
very proud of him. Although his
wrist is sore, he's been working re
ally hard," Bachrach said.
Bachrach scored a 9.65 on rings
and a 9.6 on vault to outpace the
competition. "I made vast im
provements on rings, also with
vault my score is getting progres

sively higher," he said. "It de
pends on the day. Hopefully, I will
be able pull it all together in the
end. It's nice to see how we can do
at home and without Tim. We're
definitely progressing in the right
direction."
The new focus of the team is
unity, and all members realize
their performances are important
as the Cardinal hopes to repeat as
national champion.
"The fact that now we have only
8 or 9 guys competing means that
everyone's score counts," Hegi
said. "To win the championship
this year it will have to be a total
team effort."
