# Women gymnasts call it a split
## Cardinal loses to Washington, tops Santa Barbara 
### Keith Rabkin Contributing writer 
The weekend brought mixed re
sults for the Stanford women's gym
nastics team, as the Cardinal dropped
a meet to Pacific 10 Conference rival
Washington but rebounded to crush
UC-Santa Barbara in a dual meet yes
terday at Burnham Pavilion.
The Huskies improved their over
all record to 9-3 on Friday when they
edged the Cardinal in Seattle by a
score of 193.025 to 192.95. The meet
was the closest of the season for the
Stanford women, but the Cardinal
couldn't get the few points it needed
to eke out a victory over the ninth
ranked Huskies. The Cardinal lost

three of the four events, capturing
only the uneven bars, which has been
its strength all season. Despite the
loss, the gymnasts managed to set a
season-high point total, breaking the
previous mark set last week against
Georgia.
Stanford's unusually high score on
Friday came from a strong team
showing rather than from any spec
tacular individual performances.
While all the gymnasts put up good
scores, none could beat the records
they had set the previous weekend at
Athens.
Washington's strong showing on
the vault ended Stanford's hopes for
victory as the Huskies captured
first, second and third place.
Sophomores Jamie Stauffer and
Klara Kudilkova were particu
larly outstanding, finishing first
and third respectively in the all
around. Kudilkova finished first
on the floor with a 9.85, first on
the beam with a 9.8 and won the
vault with a 9.9. Stauffer placed
second on the bars and third in
the floor.
Stanford's Amy Murakami
kept pace with these powerful
sophomores as the freshman tied
for first in the all-around and
captured the bars. While her per
formance was strong, however,
it could not make up the point
spread necessary for victory.
After this disheartening loss to
the Huskies, the Cardinal re

turned home to face the Gauchos
yesterday at home. This time the
Cardinal crushed the competition,
bringing its own record to 2-4.
UCSB scored a measly
189.375 points against the in
vigorated Cardinal gymnasts, as
the Gauchos fell to 3-6 on the
year. Santa Barbara was out of
its league against the Stanford
women, but it did manage to put
up some great individual efforts.
April Sargent was able to steal
the vault away from Stanford's
Keri Monahan with a score of
9.875. Allison Giorgetti was the
other strong performer for
UCSB, placing third on the
beam with a 9.7 and second
place in the all-around with a
38.475.
Nonetheless, Monahan had
quite a day, setting the all-time
team record with a 39.3 to beat
out Jene Elzie's top score. Mona
han also performed superbly in

the individual events, placing in
each. As a team, the Cardinal
was able to set an all-time record
on the vault with a 38.475. Mu
rakami was also strong with a
first place finish in bars and on
floor, while freshman Tracey
Kohl placed in the top three all
around for the second time this
season as she strengthened the
team's vault performance and
bar routine. Finally, Christie
Jones put up her best perfor
mance of the season by placing
third on the beam.
The Cardinal's victory yester
day was desperately needed, as it
marked the women's first win
since defeating UC-Davis more
than a month ago. The team
hopes to improve its 0-2 confer
ence record when it meets Ari
zona State next Friday. While
the team could break even more
school records, it wouldn't mind
claiming another win.
