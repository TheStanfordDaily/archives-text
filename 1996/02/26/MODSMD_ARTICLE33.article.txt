# Softball sweeps doubleheader
## 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The spark that's been lurking
about the dugout of the Stanford
softball team finally caught fire
in Friday's doubleheader against
15th-ranked Sacramento State.
In the team's home opener at
Twin Creeks in Sunnyvale, the
Cardinal took two straight victo
ries from the Hornets to even its
record at 8-8 on the season (0-4
Pacific 10 Conference).
Friday's opener proved to be
the defensive battle both teams

were expecting. Stanford fresh
man Becky Blevins and Sac State
senior and former Ail-American
Tami Blunt were near perfect
through eight innings, with nei
ther pitcher giving up a run. But
Hornet sophomore Dawn Kobata
helped Stanford break the stale
mate in the bottom of the eighth
when she mishandled a
grounder, allowing the deciding
run to score from third base.
The victory was key for Stan
ford, ending a four-game losing
streak and providing some
much-needed confidence for the

shaky Cardinal defense which
had given up 19 errors in 14
games going into Friday's
matchup. The Cardinal knew the
Hornets were an excellent defen
sive team with a good pitching
staff and felt it would have to
play a near-perfect game defen
sively in order to win.
"We haven't been focused on
every play [this season]," head
coach Sandy Pearce said. "I think
today was the first day we came
together as a team."
Stanford sophomore Jessica
Schulman pitched Friday's night
cap, in which the Cardinal scored
four runs in the fourth inning to
complete a shutout sweep of the
Hornets. Stanford's offensive
surge in the fourth was compli
mented by excellent play in the
field, as Schulman and her coun
terparts retired nine straight Hor
nets through the middle innings
of the game.
Sacramento threatened early
in the second inning, when Schul
man gave up a hard-hit single to
right field, followed by a throwing
error to second on a ground ball
between third and short. The
error, due partiy to new adjust
ments in the Cardinal lineup, did
not prove costly as freshman cen

ter fielder Shane Anderson fielded
the overthrown ball and fired it
home, where senior catcher Lynn
Anderson was waiting to apply the
tag.
Schulman gave up only one
other hit in the game. Hornet Lori
Mattson ripped a one-bouncer to
the fence in the third, but fresh
man left fielder Kelly Yablonski
fired the ball to second where
freshman Jennie Foyle caught
Mattson trying to stretch her hit
into a double.
Yablonski also provided a spark
for Stanford at the plate. With no
outs and the bases loaded in the
fourth, Yablonski scorched a
grounder through the infield. The
ball took a high bounce off the lip
of the grass, skipped over center
fielder Gina Givogri and rolled to
the fence. The bounce allowed
Yablonski to reach third and three
Cardinal players to score. Stan
ford's next batter, Lynn Ander

son, promptly stepped to the plate
and allowed Yablonski to score on
a deep sacrifice fly, putting the
game out of reach at 4-0.
Yablonski was pleased with her
hit, but admitted she was expected
to hit differently. "Sandy told me
to hit a long fly ball," Yablonski
said. "I wasn't nervous hut I knew
I was due for a big hit."
The production of runs in the
fourth was key for the Cardinal.
Stanford stranded 12 base run
ners in Friday's first game and 7
more in the nightcap, including
four in scoring position.
"Our hitting came through
[todayj," Pearce said. "They kept
working hard at every at bat."
Pearce said she credits her play
ers for the turnaround perfor
mance this weekend. "They really
wanted to beat this team," she said.
"They made a decision that they're
tired of losing, and they're just
going out on a limb and doing it."
