# Softball sweeps doubleheader
## 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The spark that's been lurking
about the dugout of the Stanford
softball team finally caught fire
in Friday's doubleheader against
15th-ranked Sacramento State.
In the team's home opener at
Twin Creeks in Sunnyvale, the
Cardinal took two straight victo
ries from the Hornets to even its
record at 8-8 on the season (0-4
Pacific 10 Conference).
Friday's opener proved to be
the defensive battle both teams

were expecting. Stanford fresh
man Becky Blevins and Sac State
senior and former Ail-American
Tami Blunt were near perfect
through eight innings, with nei
ther pitcher giving up a run. But
Hornet sophomore Dawn Kobata
helped Stanford break the stale
mate in the bottom of the eighth
when she mishandled a
grounder, allowing the deciding
run to score from third base.
The victory was key for Stan
ford, ending a four-game losing
streak and providing some
much-needed confidence for the

shaky Cardinal defense which
had given up 19 errors in 14
games going into Friday's
matchup. The Cardinal knew the
Hornets were an excellent defen
sive team with a good pitching
staff and felt it would have to
play a near-perfect game defen
sively in order to win.
"We haven't been focused on
every play [this season]," head
coach Sandy Pearce said. "I think
today was the first day we came
together as a team."
