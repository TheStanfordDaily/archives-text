# Track impresses at MPSFs
## Women take second, men finish fifth at indoor meet 
### Sam Wang 
There's plenty of credit to go around for the
Stanford women's track and field team, as it rolled
to an impressive second-place finish in last week
end's Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Indoor
Championships with a strong team effort.
Nothing epitomizes the team-oriented win more
than the finishes in the relay events. The Cardinal
women captured top-honors in the distance medley
with a University of Nevada Events Center track
record of 11:46.83 and a fourth-place finish in the
4x400 meter relay with a time of 3:49.43.
"I was real psyched. It was our best performance
ever in this meet," said head coach Vin Lananna.
"We heat a good deal of our Pacific 10 Conference
rivals. All our athletes, especially from 800 meters
and up, did a great job. It was just a great team per
formance on the women's side."
Important contributors in the individual events
included senior Dena Dey and sophomore Sarna
Renfro, as they picked up big points for the women
with a two-three finish in the mile with times of
4:57.15 and 4:57.42, respectively. Sophomore Ko
rtney Dunscombe ran an impressive 5000 by plac
ing fourth with a time of 17:42.1. Sophomore
sprinter Heather Miller also chipped in with her
performance in the 200-meter dash.
The freshmen also came up big. Mary Cobb
proved how right Lananna was last week when he
said his freshmen would do just fine by helping the
women's distance medley team blaze into the top
spot on Friday. Cobb didn't lose a thing overnight
as she came back on Saturday to win the 5000 me
ters, crossing the finish line at the 16:54.6 mark.

Junior Brian Manning and the men's track team
placed fifth at the MPSF Indoor Championships.
by leaping to third place in the
high jump, clearing the bar at five
feet, seven and three-quarter
inches.
"Tracye Lawyer in the high
jump was a big, big performance
for her as a freshman," Lananna
said.
The men's effort should not be
forgotten, either.
Jimmie Johnson stood out
above all others as he raced to a
first-place finish in the 400 me
ters, finishing with a season-best
time of 47.28. Redshirt junior
Robert Reeder and redshirt
freshman Nathan Nutter also
performed well for Stanford with
a three-four finish in the 5000,
running times of 15:01.39 and
15:03.99, respectively.
The men finished fifth overall
in the competition, with the Ari
zona Wildcats taking first in a re
peat of last year's championship
performance.
Despite the seemingly disap
pointing finish, however, Lanan
na is more than satisfied with the
men's results.
"We did not set up to put our
athletes to score points," he said.
"We put everybody where we felt
that they need to be in order to
help develop guys going into the
outdoor season. I think they did a

great job, but we've got to work
on increasing our intensity in
scoring points."
With the MPSF Champi
onships signaling the end of the
indoor competition, Stanford's
attention now turns to the out
door season.
According to Johnson, the
Cardinal men should roar back
during the outdoors as the fresh
men and the dual-sport football
players settle into their comfort
zones.
"I think we'll do a lot better in
the outdoor season," he said. "We
have a lot of freshmen who are
just coming in and they're learn
ing what college running is all
about and they'll start picking up
their game.
"Also, some of the guys are just
getting back from football and are
not ready to compete yet. But
they will be ready by the time the
big meets come around in the out
door season."
As for the women, Lananna is
just as excited about their
chances this outdoor season as
Johnson is about the men's.
"They really are poised to have
an outstanding outdoor season,"
he said. "We've got great momen
tum going into the outdoors."
The outdoor season starts next
week when Stanford runs against
Fresno State and Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo in a tri-meet at San
Luis Obispo.
