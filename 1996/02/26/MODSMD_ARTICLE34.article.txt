# Track impresses at MPSFs
## Women take second, men finish fifth at indoor meet 
### Sam Wang 
There's plenty of credit to go around for the
Stanford women's track and field team, as it rolled
to an impressive second-place finish in last week
end's Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Indoor
Championships with a strong team effort.
Nothing epitomizes the team-oriented win more
than the finishes in the relay events. The Cardinal
women captured top-honors in the distance medley
with a University of Nevada Events Center track
record of 11:46.83 and a fourth-place finish in the
4x400 meter relay with a time of 3:49.43.
"I was real psyched. It was our best performance
ever in this meet," said head coach Vin Lananna.
"We heat a good deal of our Pacific 10 Conference
rivals. All our athletes, especially from 800 meters
and up, did a great job. It was just a great team per
formance on the women's side."
Important contributors in the individual events
included senior Dena Dey and sophomore Sarna
Renfro, as they picked up big points for the women
with a two-three finish in the mile with times of
4:57.15 and 4:57.42, respectively. Sophomore Ko
rtney Dunscombe ran an impressive 5000 by plac
ing fourth with a time of 17:42.1. Sophomore
sprinter Heather Miller also chipped in with her
performance in the 200-meter dash.
The freshmen also came up big. Mary Cobb
proved how right Lananna was last week when he
said his freshmen would do just fine by helping the
women's distance medley team blaze into the top
spot on Friday. Cobb didn't lose a thing overnight
as she came back on Saturday to win the 5000 me
ters, crossing the finish line at the 16:54.6 mark.
