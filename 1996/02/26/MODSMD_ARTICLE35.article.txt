# Golf stumbles in Hawaii
## Men place seventh at John F. Burns Invitational 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Only two short weeks after a
solid second-place finish at the
Ping / Arizona Intercollegiate, the
Stanford men's golf team had its
newfound confidence severely
checked last week when it placed
seventh at the John F. Burns Clas
sic in Oahu, Hawaii.
Amid gale force winds of up to
35 miles per hour, the 24th
ranked Cardinal floundered, fin
ishing with a score of 906, 42
strokes over par and 18 behind
team champion Auburn.
"We were all pretty disappoint
ed," said freshman Joel Kribel.
"It's hard to come off of a tourna
ment where you play well and then
perform like we did last week."
The lone bright spot for the
squad was Ail-American Tiger
Woods, who continued his stellar
sophomore campaign by taking
the individual title. After a first
round score of 73 put him in a tie
for fifth place, Woods fired a 71 on
the second day to give him posses
sion of the lead, sealing the victqry
with a three-under-par 69 in the
third and final round to outpace
Oklahoma's Grant Masson by
four strokes.
"Tiger had a great tourna
ment," Kribel said, "but we just
didn't give him any support in our
team play.
"Anytime [your team hasl the
top individual, someone who
outscores everybody else in the
tournament by four strokes, it's
unacceptable to finish as low as we
did."
While Woods thrived, Kribel
and senior captain Jerry Chang
suffered rare lapses in their
games. Normally two of the most
consistent players on the team,
the pair struggled, finishing a
combined 24 strokes over par to
finish tied for 26th and tied for
34th, respectively.
"Evexything in my game was
off," Kribel said. "There wasn't
anything that I didn't have trou
ble with this week."
In what has become an all-too
familiar pattern, the fourth and
fifth spots on the team failed to
find a rhythm as well, with seniors
David Garcia and Darren

Dragovich both finishing out of
the top 80.
"It continues to be a weak area
for us," said head coach Wally
Goodwin. "We'll have to find some
consistency if we're going to be in
contention come tournament
time."
The only consistency the Cardi

nal could muster this time around
was in its mediocrity, sitting
steadily at seventh place through
all three rounds. However, incon
sistency was not the only thing
hounding Stanford. A good part of
the team's difficulties could be at-
