# Second Greek Week begins
## Fraternities, sororities unite for week of community service 
### Timothy Kiefer 
Starting with the Intersorority Council's
Women's Health Day today, Stanford's fra
ternities and sororities are kicking off Greek
Week, an event designed to unite campus
Greek organizations while serving the com
munity.
Women's Health Day, a two-hour event
which begins in White Plaza at 11 a.m., will
provide information on a variety of health is
sues, including self-defense, breast cancer,
nutrition and eye care.
"Women's health and well-being is an
issue that many of the chapters are involved
with through their philanthropy work," said

Beth Ann Jones, ISC vice president of cam
pus relations. "We wanted to bring those re
sources to the rest of campus."
Other events included in this year's
Greek Week are a faculty night, a Party for
Poverty requesting a donation of canned
goods for admission and a field day with chil
dren from the Redwood City Boys' and Girls'
Club.
This is the second year that campus fra
ternities and sororities are sponsoring Greek
Week. ISC President Ajna Pisani said she
hopes that the second Greek Week will be an
improvement over last year's effort.
"We tried Greek Week last year and it was
kind of a Hop," Pisani said. "We're
a little more organized this year."
This is also the second year that
the ISC has hosted Women's
Health Day. Organizers said they
hope to expand the event in coming
years.
"We are starting out small, but
in the future we hope to have more
campus and community organiza
tions involved in the day," said
Kappa Alpha Theta President
Catherine Adams-Simmons. "We
would like to see a blood drive, cho
lesterol testing and stress assess
ment become included events."
Greek Week is designed as a
prelude to Sorority Rush, which
will be held the second weekend of
spring quarter.
Pisani said Greek Week encour
ages cooperation among the soror

ities, which balances the competi
tion inherent in Rush. In addition,
she said Greek Week will send a
more accurate view of Greek orga
nizations.

On Feb. 10, two men at a soror
ity scholarship fund-raiser at
Tresidder were wounded in what
appears to have been an accidental
shooting. And on Feb. 17, four San
Jose State University students
were arrested on campus for al
legedly assaulting a Stanford stu
dent after a fraternity party.
"Hopefully Greek Week is send
ing a positive message," Pisani
said.
The recent incidents, both of
which involved non-Stanford stu
dents, should not be seen as prob
lems unique to the Greek system,
she said.
"I think it could have happened
at any party on campus," Pisani
said.
