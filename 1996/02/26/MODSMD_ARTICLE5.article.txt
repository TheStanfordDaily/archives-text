# Fee rules violated
## Senate illegally distributes $40K in funds 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
In violation of its own bylaws, the ASSU
Senate has misappropriated approximately
$40,000 in special- and general-fee funding
this year.
Twenty student groups either transfer
money to other student organizations, re
ceive money from both general and special
fees or get both annual and quarterly gener
al fees.
The senate is empowered to modify the
budgets of student groups in order to pre
vent such violations, but has not enforced
these bylaw provisions recently.
As a result, most of the student groups af
fected said they had no knowledge of the in
fractions.
"We were not aware that we were violat
ing the bylaws," said Real News editor
Johnathon Briggs. "We were just as clueless
as the next group that got money and did not
even know about these [provisions]."
Black Student Union treasurer Wendy
Fisher agreed, saying that because the
ASSU Appropriations Committee has ap

proved the BSU budget every year, no one
suspected any problems.
"Clearly the senate is responsible for au
thorizing funding," ASSU Financial Man
ager John Hall said. "The purpose of Appro
priations Committee and senate approval
.. . is to make sure requests comply with
funding guidelines.
"My job is not to authorize; my job is to
enforce what the senate and the students
authorize."
However, the transgressions are not en
tirely the fault of current Appropriations
Committee members, Hall said.
"This is a state of affairs that has evolved
over time," Hall said. "I personally doubt
that there were any malicious or sinister
motivations on behalf of the Appropriations
Committee or the senate."
Admitting that the committee was not
aware of the bylaw transgressions, deputy
senate chair and Appropriations Committee
member Bill Shen said, "Fortunately, now
we are aware of this and in the interests of
protecting student money, this practice will
not continue."
Shen said the senate will not
modify any general- and special
fee allocations which have already
been appropriated.
He added that the require
ments of the bylaws will be fol
lowed for spring quarter general
fee appropriations and for all of
next year's allocations.
One group has already taken
steps to comply with the bylaws.
Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford yesterday re
turned its 1995-96 Publications
Board allocation, said SEAS chair
Kelly Naylor. None of the funds
had yet been spent.
According to ASSU Bylaws, no
organization "receiving funds
from a general or special fee may
loan, grant or otherwise distribute
any of its restricted funds to an
other organization."
Four groups currently violate
this provision including BSU,
MEChA (a Chicano / Latino stu
dent group), the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization and the
Asian American Student Associa
tion.
BSU gives $1,000 to the Real
News, $1,300 to Black Liberation
Month and $900 to Black Family
Gathering each year.
MEChA appropriates $548.50
to the Stanford Literacy Improve
ment Project and $100 to Dere
chos, while SAIO gives $1,964 to
Alternative Spring Break each
year.
AASA will give about $1,500 to
the Undergraduate Chinese
American Association (UCAA).
Umbrella groups like MEChA
often fund a number of smaller or

ganizations and programs. As long
as these smaller groups do not re
ceive funding from either the Pro
gram, Community Service or Pub
lications Boards, they are exempt
from this bylaw provision.
Student organizations are also
prohibited from receiving "funds
from both a special fee and a gen
eral fee during the same fiscal
year," according to the bylaws.
Eight groups violate this re
quirement.
Alternative Spring Break re
ceives money from the SAIO spe
cial fee and annual funding from
the Community Service Board.
The Daily Planet gets funds
from the Publications Board and
from the SEAS special fee. Real
News obtains funding from the
BSU special fee and the Publica
tions Board.
Additionally, UCAA gets fund
ing from the AASA special fee and
winter quarter funding from the
Program Board.
Derechos gets funds from the
MEChA special fee and fall quar
ter funding from the Program
Board.
The Stanford Literacy Im
provement Project obtains money
from the MEChA special fee and
annual funding from the Commu
nity Service Board.
Also, Black Family Gathering
and Black Liberation Month re
ceive funds from the BSU special
fee and from the Annual Program
Board.
Another bylaw restriction pro
hibits groups from receiving both
annual and quarterly funding
from the Program Board, accord
ing to the bylaws.
Eight groups breach this re
quirement.
Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority re
ceives $5,010 in annual, fall-quar
ter and winter-quarter funding

from the Program and Communi
ty Service Boards.
Further, Alpha Phi Alpha fra
ternity gets $2,437 in annual and
winter-quarter funding from the
Program Board and the Commu
nity Service Board.
Amnesty International gets
$2,083 in annual and winter-quar
ter funding from the Program
Board.
Project DOSTI (an Indian com
munity service club) receives
$1,730 in annual, fall-quarter and
winter-quarter funding from the
Community Service Board and
fall-quarter and winter-quarter
funding from the Program Board.
Additionally, the Stanford Car
dinal Broadcast Network receives
$4,570 in annual, fall-quarter and
winter-quarter funding from the
Program Board.
The Society of Black Student
Engineers gets $1,413 in annual
and winter-quarter funding from
the Program and Community Ser
vice Boards.
Students Against Genocide
gets $4,063.98 in annual, winter
quarter and fall-quarter funding
from the Program and Communi
ty Services Boards.
Project AIYME (the Asian
American Initiative for Youth Mo
tivation and Empowerment, a
youth mentoring program) re
ceives $2,525 in annual and win
ter-quarter funding from the
Community Service Board.
Any group receiving more
than $4,200 in general-fee fund
ing each year must either apply
for a special fee or petition the
student body to continue receiv
ing a general fee, according to the
bylaws.
Due to the amount of money
they receive, Alpha Kappa Alpha
and SCBN are required to apply
for special fees for next year.
