# Fraternity could be in 353 Campus Dr. by 1997
## Zeta Psi may get house 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
After nine years without a house, Zeta
Psi fraternity has been promised the former
Delta Tau Delta house if they meet certain
University conditions.
However, rules which might be set by a
University task force on Greek affairs may
supersede the offer by Dean of Students
Marc Wais.
Last March, before the Delts lost their
house, Zeta Psi wrote a proposal to gain
housing at any Row house. By fall 1997,
Zeta Psi members hope to be living at the
former Delt house, which they raised
$120,000 to build in the early 19605.-
Wais said he has worked with the frater
nity to set conditions that would allow them
to regain housing.
"In terms of acting in good faith, if the
Zetes meet the conditions we've established,
then we have to find housing," Wais said.
There are nine requirements for Zeta Psi
to meet in order to obtain housing. These
requirements include adhering to princi
ples of collective responsibility and increas
ing membership to 54 — a number which
may prove difficult for a fraternity of 17,
nine of whom are seniors.
In addition, the fraternity must increase

its alumni contact by creating an alumni
housing board, write a mission statement,
follow chapter laws and stay out of debt.
"Meeting the 54-person membership is
definitely the biggest [challenge] for us,"
said junior Chris Fry, Zeta Psi president.
"That is what we are concentrating on."
"We are more active now than in the past
couple years," Fry added.
In the early 19605, when the University
purchased virtually all fraternity houses,
Zeta Psi moved into 353 Campus Dr. Be
cause of disciplinary problems, members
were kicked out of their house and off
campus in 1987. But with a new charter
begun in 1992, Zeta Psi hopes to establish
a positive relationship with the Universi
ty, Fry said.
' Wh«n a once-housed fraternity wants to
get back into the good graces of the Univer
sity, we want to encourage them," Wais said.
"The Zetes have claims to the 353 house —
they provided funding for it to be built."
Wais said that although he is working
with the fraternity to set conditions, frater
nities need to be aware that the Greek Af
fairs task force will be convening over the
next year.
"They could make a protocol or recom-
mendations on housing that
could supersede a past proposal,"
Wais said. "We have provided
these conditions for them to
meet, and when they have, we

consider them again."
Fry said being a housed frater
nity creates a feeling of communi
ty that is different from the one in
an unhoused fraternity.
"Anyone who has lived in a
freshman dorm knows that spe
cial sense of community," Fry
said. "Being together really facili
tates brotherhood."
