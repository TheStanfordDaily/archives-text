## National women's advocacy organization arrives on the Farm 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
Sophomore Dagmara Drabkin be
came involved with the new on-campus
chapter of the National Organization
for Women because of the subtle sex
ism she observed in her engineering
classes.
"When I came to deal with the pro
fessors and advisers in the engineering
department, I felt that I wasn't taken
seriously, and I was really surprised by
that," Drabkin said.
As a transfer student new to cam
pus, Drabkin sought a way to address
the treatment she was receiving, she
said. "I thought I NOW] was a way to
deal with sexism on a different scale.
Women get used to a subconscious
sense that men are dominant. This is a
good way for women to gain self-es
teem."
Responding to sexism in the class
room is just one of the aims of the new
chapter of NOW. According to junior
Courtney Clark, founder and president
of the chapter, NOW hopes to serve as
an umbrella group to consolidate all the
other women's groups into one coali
tion.
"We have a veiy diverse community
and a lot of different groups that each
have their own purpose and goal, but
this is a multi-issue group that deals
with anything pertinent to women,"
Clark said. Clark began organizing the
local chapter at Stanford last fall, and
the group began meeting regularly this

quarter.
Founded in 1966, NOW has numer
ous chapters in every state. California
is the most active state, with the largest
number oflocal chapters. Although the
organization is composed primarily of
women, men can join as well.
Brian Singerman, a freshman, said
he became involved with NOW because
of his interest in pro-choice issues.
"I think its strengths are that it def

initely gets male and female feminists
together to discuss issues and events,"
Singerman said. "Last I heard, NOW
wanted to concentrate on affirmative
action for women, and for people who
believe affirmative action for women is
a good thing, it's a good organization to
be in."
