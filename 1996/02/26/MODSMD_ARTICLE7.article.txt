# Here and NOW
## National women's advocacy organization arrives on the Farm 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
Sophomore Dagmara Drabkin be
came involved with the new on-campus
chapter of the National Organization
for Women because of the subtle sex
ism she observed in her engineering
classes.
"When I came to deal with the pro
fessors and advisers in the engineering
department, I felt that I wasn't taken
seriously, and I was really surprised by
that," Drabkin said.
As a transfer student new to cam
pus, Drabkin sought a way to address
the treatment she was receiving, she
said. "I thought I NOW] was a way to
deal with sexism on a different scale.
Women get used to a subconscious
sense that men are dominant. This is a
good way for women to gain self-es
teem."
Responding to sexism in the class
room is just one of the aims of the new
chapter of NOW. According to junior
Courtney Clark, founder and president
of the chapter, NOW hopes to serve as
an umbrella group to consolidate all the
other women's groups into one coali
tion.
"We have a veiy diverse community
and a lot of different groups that each
have their own purpose and goal, but
this is a multi-issue group that deals
with anything pertinent to women,"
Clark said. Clark began organizing the
local chapter at Stanford last fall, and
the group began meeting regularly this

quarter.
Founded in 1966, NOW has numer
ous chapters in every state. California
is the most active state, with the largest
number oflocal chapters. Although the
organization is composed primarily of
women, men can join as well.
Brian Singerman, a freshman, said
he became involved with NOW because
of his interest in pro-choice issues.
"I think its strengths are that it def

initely gets male and female feminists
together to discuss issues and events,"
Singerman said. "Last I heard, NOW
wanted to concentrate on affirmative
action for women, and for people who
believe affirmative action for women is
a good thing, it's a good organization to
be in."

gained official recognition from
the national and state organiza
tions, but the paperwork is being
processed and should be complet
ed around the end of the school
year, according to Clark. Once the
Stanford group gains official
recognition, it will be able to con
nect more with other chapters in
the Bay Area, she said.
However, the group will not
wait until the end of the year to
become politically active. "A lot of
the women's groups on campus
aren't politically motivated,
though they do try to raise con

sciousness," said Clark. "This
group is more concerned with po
litical action — marches, rallies,
writing to [politiciansl, trying to
change policy rather than just
raising awareness."
This April, NOW's national
convention will be held in San
Francisco, which marks the first
time it will occur on the West
Coast. The convention will dis
cuss policies for the organization
to pursue in the upcoming year
and will also evaluate the organi
zation's effectiveness in dealing
with issues from last year, said
Clark. There will be workshops
about various issues such as
building coalitions.
Clark said plans are underway
for a San Francisco rally called

"Fight the Right" to be held on
April 14, dealing with issues such
as affirmative action, reproduc
tive freedom, gay and lesbian
rights and domestic violence. She
hopes a large Stanford contingent
will attend the rally, thereby help
ing to make the Stanford chapter
more prominent.
Members of NOW said they are
optimistic about the future.
"I'm really excited because I
think this is a strong group of
women and men who aren't
afraid to take a stand," said senior
Liz Warren. "I think it's great
that Stanford students have this
opportunity to express them
selves, and know that their views
are supported socially and politi
cally."
