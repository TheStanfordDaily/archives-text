Peres vows reprisal
JERUSALEM (AP) — With Israelis'
nerves stretched tight following two suicide
bombings, Prime Minister Shimon Peres
promised yesterday that Israel would destroy
the militant Palestinian group Hamas,
which claimed responsibility for the attacks.
Despite his assurances, Israelis were
obviously jittery a day after the bombings
killed 27 people — the highest toll in a day
since 1978.
The charged atmosphere brought a new

casualty: An Arab-American was shot and
killed yesterday by Israeli civilians who
feared he was a terrorist when his rented car
crashed into a crowded Jerusalem bus stop.
Hundreds of police officers, convinced
they were facing a new terror attack,
rushed to the scene. But police later said
the driver, Ahmed Abdel Hamida of Cali
fornia, apparently lost control of the car.
An Israeli woman was killed in the crash
and 22 people were injured. It was not
known whether the bystanders who opened
fire faced criminal charges.
