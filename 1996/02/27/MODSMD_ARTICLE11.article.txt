# Clinton slaps sanctions on Cuba

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton slapped new sanctions on Fidel
Castro's "repressive, violent, scornful"
government yesterday for downing two
civilian U.S. airplanes. Republicans said
the punishment was too mild and
accused Clinton of "coddling Castro."
The president suspended charter
travel to Havana, demanded reparations
for the victims' families and gave quali
fied support for a Republican-backed bill
that would intensify the economic crack
down.
Under pressure to respond swiftly to
the attack against pilots of an anti-Cas

tro Cuban-American group, Clinton said
the incident "was a flagrant violation of
international law."
"It is wrong," he said, "and the Unit
ed States will not tolerate it."
Cuba said the shooting occurred over
its airspace, and that its pilots were pro
voked. "This is not something that
occurs out of the blue," said Ricardo
Alarcon, president of Cuba's parliament.
The broad economic, diplomatic
and political steps Clinton outlined
were intended to isolate Castro's gov
ernment further and inoculate Clin
ton against soft-on-Castro broadsides

from his Republican rivals.
But what he did was limited: He
needs approval from Congress or the
United Nations to implement some pro
posals, and the president did not fully
repeal a series of steps he took last year
to ease Cuban sanctions.
Senate Mtyority Leader Bob Dole said
Clinton "laid an egg."
"After months of moving the wrong
way — toward coddling Castro — the
president has yet to understand that the
only way to deal with Castro's tyranny is
with real firmness and pressure," Dole
said.
