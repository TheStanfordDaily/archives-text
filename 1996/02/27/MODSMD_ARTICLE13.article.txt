## Carding on campus 
### 
The Stanford Card Plan
should continue to expand
and include Dining Services

THE UNIVERSITY IS often
accused of being well behind
the pack in the realm of stu
dent services. That may at times be
the case, but it should nonetheless be
recognized when positive changes
are made.
One such example is the Stanford
Card Plan, the debit account feature
of the new ID cards. While students
have grumbled about some isolated
aspects of the program, they have
not recognized the consistent and
positive work done to implement and
now to expand the plan.
Bursar Jon Erickson and his staff
— under whose auspices the pro
gram falls — are to be commended
for their efforts to make this pro
gram as useful and efficient as possi
ble. Erickson seems legitimately
interested in assessing student needs
while expanding this program and
acting promptly to add new, needed
services to it. At the same time, how
ever, other University divisions
engaging in on-campus commerce
must make an effort to integrate
their operations into the Stanford
Card Plan fold.
When it was unveiled at the start
of fall quarter, the Stanford Card
Plan was useable at Bon Appetit's
Tresidder locations, at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, for Department
of Athletics tickets and for a la carte
items at University Dining Services.
Looking to expand the program
further, the University ordered
approximately 100 soda vending
machines with card readers; they
were installed two weeks ago.
Though the machines are not yet
connected to the University's com
puter network and thus do not yet
accept the Stanford Card (they do, of
course, still accept cash), their instal
lation is a positive development in
the effort to expand the Stanford

Card Plan.
Erickson has said that by the start
of next academic year — if not soon
er — Tresidder Express will join the
plan and some residences' laundry
machines will be wired to the sys
tem. He is also exploring installing
an ATM-like machine which would
allow students to check their bal
ances and add funds to their
accounts 24 hours a day.
With so many pluses, however,
there is bound to be a minus. In this
case it is not an uncommon one: Uni
versity Dining Services. Currently,
the vast majority of the money in the
Stanford Card Plan is spent at
Tresidder while, at the same time,
most students are locked into expen
sive meal plans. Students are thus
understandably loathe to put money
into the plan — to be spent at Tresid
der — when doing so implicitly
means skipping an already-paid-for
Dining Services meal.
It is widely acknowledged that
Dining Services could be less draco
nian in its meal-plan requirements.
Students living in dorms must buy a
minimum of 12 meals per week, and
then only if they agree to purchase a
certain number of "points" — quasi
dollars good only at Dining Services
locations. Without points, the small
est plan is for 14 meals. However, a
real concession can be made to the
interests of students — and the
future of the Stanford Card Plan —
if Dining Services abolishes its points
and uses only Stanford Card Plan
dollars in their place.
By allowing money to be placed in
a Stanford Card Plan account —
rather than locking it up as points —
Dining Services will permit students
more flexibility in choosing where to
eat. That will, to some degree, dam
age Dining Services' monopoly in on
campus food, but as a University
division — and a non-profit one — its
primary aim should be students'
needs, not market dominance.
With Erickson's continuing
efforts — and with some concessions
from Dining Services — the Stanford
Card Plan can fully serve the needs
of students and become the standard
for on-campus commerce.
