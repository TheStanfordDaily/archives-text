## Looking back to understand 
### 
MY MOTHER REFUSES to read
The Joy Luck Club. "That's not
real life," she says. "You just
want excitement."
I asked her to read the novel to find a
common place of understanding. The
Hollywood treatment of the movie proba
bly did nothing more to convince her to
read. I understand. Those events were
their history. My parents see nothing
special, nothing grand in life as usual.
When I was growing up, my parents
didn't tell me much about their own past,
about their journey from there to here.
Their lives seemed to exist in the present,
with daily concerns of job and family.
Besides, asking my parents about
their past was so difficult. What facts
they told me didn't quite seem real. Their
reality meshes with mine — I know them
as my parents. The young doctoral candi
dates, the bicycling college students, the
naughty tree-climbing kids I heard about
at reunions seemed like strangers.
When we were younger, my brother
and I made up stories about my father's
two years of mandatory military service.
We garbled the transmission and filtered
in the gaping trenches of World War II
and the space-age heroism of Buck
Rogers. My brother and I took turns tak
ing the enemy bullet, saving alternately
our uncle or our grandfather. Only later
did I learn my father's peacetime jaunt
was mostly spent teaching in the class

room. Back then, I'm not sure if the facts
would have mattered. We deliberately
created our own vision, rejecting the past.
Last summer, I visited the Royal Mar
itime Academy in Greenwich, England.
Sixty years ago, my grandfather had
rapelled off the walls there during mid
night training. He attended the military
school for three years.
I stood at the gate through which he
passed so many years ago. So many foot
prints stood between us. I imagined him
as he first stepped up to the school. He
would have seen the tall brick buildings,
so different from the low, compact homes
of Taiwan. He would spin around toward
the Thames and take in the city at a
glance.
Maybe my grandfather received as
much attention as the mummies in the
British museum. Maybe people stared in
curiosity at the newly arrived Oriental
import. Imagining those stares makes me
feel closer to him. In Europe, everyone
assumed I was a Japanese tourist. People
wanted to see, to touch the exoticness.
Konichiwa catcalls echoed behind my
friend and I as we walked through the
streets.
When I returned home from England,
I discovered my grandfather spoke
English. Oddly, this had not occurred to
me at all, even as I stood in his place at
the gates of the Academy. I should have
known. But my past impressions of Chi

nese as strange and unknown were too
powerful. I was unable to find the famil
iar in the obvious.
Knowing my grandfather and I
dreamed in a common language, I felt a
sudden loss, greater than when he died.
Maybe I could have spoken to him with a
clarity that is lacking when I stumble
through my faulty Mandarin. I wish I
could ask him about all my unresolved
mysteries.
I wonder where I came from as I con
template where I'm going. This much I
know: my parents sailed to Taiwan from
China as children, on a three-day boat
ride. World War II played out behind
them as they played in the meadows of
the northern basin. They landed in the
cornfields of the Midwest as young doc
toral candidates and harvested doctor
ates. My father courted his future bride
with root-beer floats. They began to raise
a family. Then the years start spinning
toward when my memory begins.
The irony is that my parents are in the
present, yet I search for the truth from a
source that will forever remain silent. I
realize the possibility of discovery still
remains. So much left to discover. I begin
to ask. I learn to listen.
