Water Department responds to grad student's concerns

THE STANFORD WATER
Department, within the Utilities
Division, would like to respond
to the letter, "Grad student urges Uni
versity to examine maintenance" in
last Thursday's Daily. As providers of
water to the University campus, we
know it is essential for our customers
to have confidence in their water sys
tem. We take Mr. Hansen's concerns
most seriously and wish to report to
the community with respect to them.
As part of an ongoing campus-wide
program, on Jan. 3, the Water Depart
ment enhanced and upgraded the part
of the water system that serves Mr.
Hansen's courtyard in Escondido Vil
lage. The work required a temporary
shutdown of the system — the only
shutdown that took place in Mr.
Hansen's Escondido Village courtyard
in January. In the past four years, the

Water Department has completed
approximately 200 similar shutdowns
and installations campus-wide. As
always, the work was done in accor
dance with requirements set by the Cal
ifornia Department of Health Services
(DHS) and followed American Water
Works Association (AWWA) standards
intended to protect public health.
Because excavation was necessary to
do the work, the Water Department fol
lowed the required procedures by flush
ing the main supply lines on comple
tion of the job until the water ran
clear. As is also standard practice for
this type of work, residents were
advised to run their faucets until the
water ran clear.
The Water Department received no
complaints about the work done in Jan
uary, nor any reports of sickness, until
receiving an electronic copy of the let

ter Mr. Hansen sent to The Daily on
Feb. 21. In addition, water samples col
lected at Escondido Village (and else
where on campus) before and since the
shutdown indicate that Stanford's
water quality meets or exceeds all state
and federal standards.
Mr. Hansen questioned if contami
nation and subsequent illness could be
caused by a connection between the
potable hot water system and the recir
culating hot water system that heats
the buildings. While the Water Depart
ment does not operate and maintain
these pipes and equipment, the Univer
sity office that does, Housing and Din
ing Services, stated that they have
inspected the mechanical backflow pre
vention device that separates the two
systems. Their inspection showed the
device to be in good working order, pre
venting the two systems from mixing.

Protecting public health is the top
priority of the Water Department. The
system is managed in accordance with
DHS regulations and requirements and
by strict guidelines established by the
AWWA. These are the same standards
required of all water companies
throughout California and are express
ly intended to protect public health at
all times. They include daily, weekly
and monthly testing by Stanford and
by outside laboratories.
We have contacted Mr. Hansen
directly to address the issues and ques
tions he raised. We encourage all of our
customers to contact us at 723-1300 or
725-3401 with any questions, concerns
or comments regarding Mr. Hansen's
concerns or water quality on campus in
general.
