## Why mood rings and lava lamps do groovy things 
### Jessen Yu Contributing writer 
Q 9 So how do those groovy mood
rings do that thing that they do?
A They just do, man, they just do.
• Despite what you've heard, the
• mood ring doesn't actually
respond to your karma. All it does is change
color depending on the temperature of your
skin. It's made out of the same stufT that is
on those stress test cards which are sup
posed to tell you if you're stressed or not.
The only difference is that back when mood
rings were "groovy," having moods was
cool. Today, being stressed out is cool.
Anyway, the color changing thing is a
liquid ..rystal, kind of similar to the liquid
crystal displays you see on digital watches
and microwaves.
The temperature sensitive crystals are
derived from cholesterol. On the molecular
level, the liquid crystals look rod-like and
are packed together in layers. Each layer
consists of lined-up rods, and successive

layers are rotated slightly with respect to
each other. The net effect is that the rods
spiral as you go through the layers.
When the liquid crystal is heated, the
layers rotate more with respect to each
other, changing the amount the rods spiral.
The amount the rods spiral is related to the
wavelength of light that is reflected by the
liquid crystal. At lower temperatures, there
is less spiraling so longer wavelengths of
light, like red light, are reflected. At higher
temperatures, there is more spiraling so
shorter wavelengths of light, like blue, are
reflected. The net effect is that the color
changes gradually from red to blue as the
temperature increases.
M 1 • S° how those groovy lava lamp
yy things do that thing that they do ?
A They just do, man, they just do.
• First off, it's not real lava. Real
• lava melts people, this lava can
barely melt butter.
The lava lamp is based on differing coef
ficients of thermal expansion. This means

that the two liquids inside of the lava lamp
respond differently to changes in tempera
ture. Almost everything expands when
heated, but not everything expands by the
same amount. The amount that a sub
stance expands when heated is its coeffi
cient of thermal expansion.
Inside the lava lamp, there are two liq
uids which don't mix. At room temperature
the lava part of the lamp is denser than the
other part, but has a greater coefficient of
thermal expansion.
So, when you heat the two liquids up,
the lava expands more than the non-lava
part. Since the same amount of lava is now
taking up more space, it becomes less
dense. The liquid around the lava also
becomes less dense, but not to as great an
extent as the lava.
Since the heated lava is less dense than
the surrounding liquid, it floats upward.
When the lava reaches the top, it cools
down and becomes denser and falls back
down to the bottom to start the cycle over
again.
So, suppose you wanted to make a lava
lamp. Before you begin, you must get into

the proper groove, man. First of all, you
need to find two liquids which satisfied the
properties I talked about above. To review,
the lava has to have a higher coefficient of
thermal expansion than the surrounding
liquid, the lava can't mix with the other liq
uid and the two liquids have to be about the
same density at room temperature. Also, it
would be nice if the liquids weren't poi
sonous and don't kill anyone on contact.
You'd also need a tall container to put
the two liquids in, preferably made out of
some transparent material. Also, you need
a heat and light source, like a 40-watt bulb.
Finally, you'd have to swear that if any
thing goes wrong you won't blame me.
Now that I am freed of all legal and
moral obligations, I guess I can suggest two
liquids that you can get to make your lamp.
For the lava, mineral oil is a pretty good
choice, and the other liquid should be a
mixture of 70 percent and 90 percent rub
bing alcohol. You can find the 70 percent
mixture at the drugstore. If you ask REAL
LY nicely, they'll order 90 percent for you.
If you want to color the liquids, you might
want to use a chopped-up felt-tip pen to

color the lava and food colors for the alco
hol.
Since the two liquids have to be about
the same density, you'll need to find the
perfect mixture of 70 percent and 90 per
cent rubbing alcohol.
If you were to make a lava lamp, which I
am in no way advocating, you would first
put the mineral oil and 90 percent rubbing
alcohol in your container, and then slowly
add 70 percent rubbing alcohol while gently
mixing, until the mineral oil looks like it's
about to float away. Also, to keep the lava
from breaking up too much, adding a little
bit of turpentine might help.
To finish everything up, you also need
that 40-watt light bulb at the bottom to
provide heat and light. Without the heat,
you have no lava. Without the light, you
have no lamp.
Without Sonny, you have no Cher.
