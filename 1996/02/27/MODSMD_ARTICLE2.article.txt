# $1M funds study on eating disorders
## 
### Timothy Kiefer Contributing Writer 
The McKnight Foundation of Minneapolis has awarded
Stanford researchers a $1 million grant to study risk factors
for the development of eating disorders.
The study will look at children in the fourth through
eighth grades to determine what factors are linked with the
development of eating disorders later in life.
The first phase of the study, which has already been com
pleted using an earlier grant, identified a variety of risk fac
tors including weight, social pressure, self confidence, and the
influence of the media and family members.
The second phase of the study, which will be financed with
the new grant, will follow a group of children over a period of
several years. This part of the study will attempt to show how
the children's attitudes develop over time.
The third phase of the study will be to develop and put into
effect an educational program designed to prevent eating dis
orders.
C. Bm r Taylor, professor of psychiatry at the School of
Medicine, t-uici the first phase of the study has already pro
duced insights on what causes eating disorders.
Taylor said social pressure to be thin was the most signifi
cant predictor of eating disorders. According to Taylor, social

pressure can mean both teasing overweight children as well as
praising thin people.
He said the researchers were surprised to find that fourth
and fifth graders already feared being labeled "fat."
"They are very preoccupied with body weight and fat," I)r.
Taylor said, calling the findings "amazing . . . shocking I
would have to say."
Taylor said these worries about weight are tied to the de
velopment of eating disorders later in life.
"Weight concerns are a powerful predictor of the onset of
eating disorders," he said.
Heavier children are also more likely to develop eating dis
orders later in life, Taylor said.
"Their weight itself is a risk factor," he said.
One surprise in the research thus far has been the rela
tively small influence of the media's glamorization of thin
ness.
"It's surprisingly not been as important as we thought it
would be," Taylor said. He added that much of the media's in
fluence might be indirect, with social pressure replicating val
ues learned through watching television or looking at maga
zines.
For example, a girl might see a Kate Moss advertisement
and then tell her friends how at
tractive she thinks Moss is, there
by combining social pressure to
be thin with media pressure.
University of Arizona re
searchers are also working on the
project, asking the same ques
tions to children in Arizona. Tay
lor said the dual studies will in
crease the diversity of the study
group and allow the researchers
to break down the results accord
ing to race or ethnicity.
Besides Taylor, other Stanford
researchers working on the pro
ject include Psychiatry Profs. Joel
Killen and Helena Kraemer, re
search assistants Tamara Altman
and Darby Cunning and psychia
try instructpr Susan Bryson.
