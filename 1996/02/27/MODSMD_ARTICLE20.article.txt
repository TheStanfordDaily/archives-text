## Deuces wild as tennis teams place second in tourneys Bruins down men in finals 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
The streak is over.
On Sunday afternoon, the
UCLA Bruins put an end to the
second-longest winning streak (37
matches) in Division I tennis his
tory since the present NCAA
championship format was intro
duced in 1977. The longest streak
is 40 matches, held by the Cardi
nal team of 1977-79.
The Cardinal met the Bruins in
the finals of the National Indoor
Championships at Kentucky, and
was beaten handily, 5-1. Head
coach Dick Gould said of his
team's first loss in over a year,
"They were a better team than we
were at the Indoors. We had a
chance to break the record [for
consecutive matches won]. It has
been one heck of a run."
Senior captain JefT Salzenstein
expressed similar sentiments. "It
wasn't a case of us beating our
selves. The better team won," he
said. "Streaks are meant to be bro
ken. We weren't trying to break
any records .. . but it would have
been nice. Last year was special,
and undefeated seasons don't hap
pen often."
UCLA, currently ranked sec
ond behind Stanford, won con
vincingly and established itself as
a prominent contender for the
NCAA crown in May.
The Cardinal is not overly
shaken by the loss, however. "I'm
very pleased with the way we re
acted to our first loss in two
years," Gould said. "We walked
out with no negative vibes and our
heads held high."
In fact, some players are sug
gesting that the loss may turn out
to be beneficial for the team.
Sophomore Paul Goldstein, who
experienced a team loss for the
first time in his collegiate career
on Sunday, said, "I thought it was
an encouraging week, overall. The
loss is going to be very good for us
— something we'll definitely be
able to learn from. This will in
spire us to work harder in practice.
We lost to a better team, and now
we know where we have to go."
Senior Ricky "the Doctor"
Becker, who lost his first dual
match of the season against
UCLA, admitted to having had
feelings of Cardinal invincibility.
"We had been taking winning
for granted in many ways," he
said. "Losing is kind of a weird
thing for me now. I had forgotten
what it was like. Losing makes
you appreciate winning more. If
anything, losing makes you hun
grier, and that will help u§ in
May."
Salzenstein said that he is
proud of the way the team per
formed during the grueling tour

nament, but that he is disappoint
ed with his 0-4 performance.
Salzy, who played No. 1 singles for
the Cardinal all week, was forced
to retire in the third set of the
team's opening-round match
against Kentucky after he col
lapsed due to severe cramping in
his legs.
Stanford's top player was hur
ried to the hospital where it was
discovered that his blood-sugar
level was less than half of what it
should have been. Apparently,
Salzenstein, who was recovering
from a touch of the flu, had not en
joyed a sufficient diet in the days
leading up to the tourney.
Salzy entered the tournament
playing at the top of his game, rid
ing a seven-match individual win
streak which included winning the
Rolex Indoor Championships in
Dallas.
"Up to the point where I was re
ally cramping, I think I was play
ing my best tennis," Salzenstein

said. "But I'm not going to make
any excuses. I was physically all
right for my last three matches,
and I lost. I just didn't feel as
sharp out there in the singles."
Of his best player's disappoint
ing performance, Gould said,
"You'll never see Jeff lose four in a
row. He just wasn't himself out
there. And that hurt us. To beat
the teams we beat without Jeff
was a big accomplishment."
The teams Gould is referring to
are Kentucky, TCU and Georgia,
Stanford's first, second and third
round opponents, respectively.
TCU is ranked fifth in the nation,
and Georgia is ranked third.
"We just came out and played
good tennis," Gould said. "The
guys are tough, gutsy
and they pulled out wins against a
couple of very good teams."
Gould was particularly pleased
with the team's doubles play.

Team captain Jeff Salzenstein wasn't his normal self this weekend
droppingfour matches.The Cardinal lost for the first time in 38 outings.
Stanford won the doubles point in
all of its matches except the finals.
The Cardinal recently juggled its
doubles lineup, and now teams up
Salzenstein and freshman Ryan
Wolters, Goldstein and senior Jim
Thomas, and Becker and junior
Grant Elliott at first, second and
third doubles, respectively.
"I now think we have some
great doubles combinations,"
Gould said. "Our No. 1 team
proved they could play with any
body, and our doubles all around
was really excellent. We came
very close to sweeping the dou
bles."
As far as other individual sin
gles performances go, freshman
Ryan Wolters was 2-2 at the sec
ond spot for the Cardinal and
Goldstein turned in a 2-2 record at
the third position. Thomas pre
served his undefeated dual-match
mark with a 3-0 run at the fourth
slot but had his match against
IjCLA suspended. At No. 5, Elliott

was 3-1 on the week and chalked
up the Cardinal's only point in the
finals. Becker was 2-1 playing in
the sixth spot for Stanford.
The end of the streak is certain
ly not something Stanford was
looking forward to, but Salzen
stein says the team is still pro
gressing. "We're trying to look at
the positives of losing which isn't
always easy to do," he said.
"You lose, you get beat. That's
going to happen," Gould said.
"This team has reacted to the loss
the way you would expect a cham
pionship team to react. I came out
of Kentucky feeling very, very
good. Not everyone played his best
tennis, but we are tough, and
we're gutsy. We are great competi
tors, and that is what makes for a
truly great team."
The Cardinal will get two
chances in the regular season to
avenge their loss to UCLA, and as
all indicators suggest, may get an
other in the NCAAs in May.
"We're not panicking," said
Salzenstein. "We're just going to
work hard, and you can be sure
we'll be ready for anybody in
May."
