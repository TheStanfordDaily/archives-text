# Women drop final match to Gators, 5-2
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Everything held true to form
last weekend at the Women's
Tennis National Indoor Team
Championships as the top-seeded
Florida Gators captured the in
door crown after defeating the
second-seeded Stanford Cardinal,
5-2.
The Cardinal (10-1, 2-0 Pacific
10 Conference Southern Divi
sion) breezed through their

bracket with only one relatively
difficult test, but met a tough
Florida squad (9-0) in the finals.
The Gators, like the Cardinal, re
turned every player from a team
that lost in the NCAA champi
onship match last season.
Florida, ranked No. 1 in the
country, clinched the title in dou
bles, as the No. 1 tandem of Dawn
Buth and Stephanie Nickitas
downed the Cardinal All-Ameri
can duo of junior Katie Schluke
bir and sophomore Ania Bleszyns

ki (3-3) by a score of 8-2. Buth and
Nickitas were undefeated in dou
bles in the Gators' four matches.
Florida took control of the dual
match in seizing four of the six
singles matches from the No. 3
Cardinal. Junior Sandra De Silva
(9-1) and sophomore Julie Scott
(9-0) posted Stanford's only victo
ries at No. 3 and No. 5 singles, re
spectively.
"They were a little too good for
us at this point," head coach
Frank Brennan said. "But I'm not
surprised. I kind of thought that
might happen, and frankly, it
would have been bad for us to
have beaten Florida.
"I think it would have hurt our
focus somehow. I mean they were
better than us, but if somehow we
got lucky, maybe an injury or
something happened, I think we
would have had a hard time the
rest of the year because we're re
ally not good enough yet."
De Silva's 3-6,6-0,6-2 win over
Divya Merchant gave the Cardi
nal their first point of the match,
and Stanford was able to extend
the match into doubles when
Scott pulled out a 6-4, 6-7, 7-5 tri
umph over Bonnie Bleeker.
The Gators were too powerful
up front for the Cardinal as both
Bleszynski (8-3) and Schlukebir
(8-2) dropped straight-set match
es at the No. 1 and No. 2 slots, re
spectively. Gator Jill Craybass,
the third-ranked singles player in
the nation, defeated Bleszynski,
6-1, 6-2, and Schlukebir fell to
Buth, 6-4, 6-3.
Florida's other points came at
No. 4 and No. 5 singles. Lisa
Pugliese downed Stanford red
shirt senior Kim Shasby (5-3) in
straight sets, 6-0,6-4. Senior Amy
Chiminello (10-1) split sets with


Red Byer — Daily file
Sophomore Ania Bleszynski and her teammates finished second at
the National Indoors this past weekend.
Nickitas at No. 6 singles, but lost
her first match of the season in
the third for a 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 defeat.
"We needed one more singles
match to get it 3-3," Brennan
said. "It would have been nice to
put a little pressure on them and
stall it out."
The Cardinal reached the title
match after bulldozing eighth
ranked Wake Forest in the semifi
nals, 5-1. Stanford was led by
strong performances in the top
three singles spots. Bleszynski
disposed of Terry Ann Zawacki,
ranked eleventh in collegiate ten
nis, 6-4, 6-4.
Schlukebir also took the No. 2
singles match in straight sets over
Cristina Caparis, 6-1, 6-3. De
Silva sent Demon Deacon Maggie
Harris off the court quickly with a
6-3, 6-0 triumph.
Scott outlasted Lule Aydin in a
first-set tiebreaker at No. 5 sin
gles and went on to take the sec
ond set 6-3 for the victory.
Chiminello won in straight sets
over Line Urling, 6-4, 6-0.
Wake Forest's only victory
came at No. 4 singles, as Nicola
Kaiwai earned a three-set win
over Shasby, 6-7, 7-5, 6-4. The
five singles victories made dou
bles play unnecessary.
The Cardinal advanced past
No. 10 Arizona in the second
round, 5-4, marking the second
time in less than a week in which
Stanford beat the Wildcats. The
Cardinal won four of the singles
matches to jump out early and
clinched the win with a 8-6 win at
the No. 3 doubles slot by
Chiminello and junior Emily Burt
(6-0). The two teams will meet for
a third time in Tucson for an April

Pac-10 showdown. The Cardinal
ran over No. 17 Vanderbilt in the
first round, 6-0.
"If somebody had given me the
draw two weeks ago and asked me
what would be success, I would
have said we should get to the fi
nals, we should work our way
through our half of the draw, we
should meet Florida in the finals,
and they're probably a little bet
ter than us right now," Brennan
said. "And that's exactly what
happened."
For the tournament, the Cardi

nal was led by Scott s undefeated
4-0 record at the No. 5 singles
spot. Schlukebir, De Silva and
Chiminello all went 3-1 for the
weekend. For Chiminello, the vic
tories moved her career record to
75-7, vaulting her into seventh
place for most dual-match victo
ries.
The Cardinal seemed to strug
gle in doubles play, winning only
one of its four matches. Bleszyns
ki and Schlukbir went 0-2 for the
tournament.
"Unfortunately, our singles

players cannot allow their singles
results to affect their doubles,"
Brennan said. "They have to re
group a little bit better and that
was one of our trademarks last
year.
"IBleszynski] and [Schlukebir]
lost to the best team in the coun
try, so that's not a team that I
think they should beat at this
point. But they lost to Arizona
and that was bad. They should
have been able to beat that Ari
zona team, and they didn't quite
get it together for that one."

over Shasby, 6-7, 7-5, 6-4. The
five singles victories made dou
bles play unnecessary.
The Cardinal advanced past
No. 10 Arizona in the second
round, 5-4, marking the second
time in less than a week in which
Stanford beat the Wildcats. The
Cardinal won four of the singles
matches to jump out early and
clinched the win with a 8-6 win at
the No. 3 doubles slot by
Chiminello and junior Emily Burt
(6-0). The two teams will meet for
a third time in Tucson for an April

Pac-10 showdown. The Cardinal
ran over No. 17 Vanderbilt in the
first round, 6-0.
"If somebody had given me the
draw two weeks ago and asked me
what would be success, I would
have said we should get to the fi
nals, we should work our way
through our half of the draw, we
should meet Florida in the finals,
and they're probably a little bet
ter than us right now," Brennan
said. "And that's exactly what
happened."
For the tournament, the Cardi

nal was led by Scott s undefeated
4-0 record at the No. 5 singles
spot. Schlukebir, De Silva and
Chiminello all went 3-1 for the
weekend. For Chiminello, the vic
tories moved her career record to
75-7, vaulting her into seventh
place for most dual-match victo
ries.
The Cardinal seemed to strug
gle in doubles play, winning only
one of its four matches. Bleszyns
ki and Schlukbir went 0-2 for the
tournament.
"Unfortunately, our singles

players cannot allow their singles
results to affect their doubles,"
Brennan said. "They have to re
group a little bit better and that
was one of our trademarks last
year.
"IBleszynski] and [Schlukebir]
lost to the best team in the coun
try, so that's not a team that I
think they should beat at this
point. But they lost to Arizona
and that was bad. They should
have been able to beat that Ari
zona team, and they didn't quite
get it together for that one."

Senior Amy Chiminello lost her first match of this season in the finals of the National Indoors this past
weekend in Madison, Wis.
Everything held true to form
last weekend at the Women's
Tennis National Indoor Team
Championships as the top-seeded
Florida Gators captured the in
door crown after defeating the
second-seeded Stanford Cardinal,
5-2.
The Cardinal (10-1, 2-0 Pacific
10 Conference Southern Divi
sion) breezed through their

bracket with only one relatively
difficult test, but met a tough
Florida squad (9-0) in the finals.
The Gators, like the Cardinal, re
turned every player from a team
that lost in the NCAA champi
onship match last season.
Florida, ranked No. 1 in the
country, clinched the title in dou
bles, as the No. 1 tandem of Dawn
Buth and Stephanie Nickitas
downed the Cardinal All-Ameri
can duo of junior Katie Schluke
bir and sophomore Ania Bleszyns

ki (3-3) by a score of 8-2. Buth and
Nickitas were undefeated in dou
bles in the Gators' four matches.
Florida took control of the dual
match in seizing four of the six
singles matches from the No. 3
Cardinal. Junior Sandra De Silva
(9-1) and sophomore Julie Scott
(9-0) posted Stanford's only victo
ries at No. 3 and No. 5 singles, re
spectively.
"They were a little too good for
us at this point," head coach
Frank Brennan said. "But I'm not
surprised. I kind of thought that
might happen, and frankly, it
would have been bad for us to
have beaten Florida.
"I think it would have hurt our
focus somehow. I mean they were
better than us, but if somehow we
got lucky, maybe an injury or
something happened, I think we
would have had a hard time the
rest of the year because we're re
ally not good enough yet."
De Silva's 3-6,6-0,6-2 win over
Divya Merchant gave the Cardi
nal their first point of the match,
and Stanford was able to extend
the match into doubles when
Scott pulled out a 6-4, 6-7, 7-5 tri
umph over Bonnie Bleeker.
The Gators were too powerful
up front for the Cardinal as both
Bleszynski (8-3) and Schlukebir
(8-2) dropped straight-set match
es at the No. 1 and No. 2 slots, re
spectively. Gator Jill Craybass,
the third-ranked singles player in
the nation, defeated Bleszynski,
6-1, 6-2, and Schlukebir fell to
Buth, 6-4, 6-3.
Florida's other points came at
No. 4 and No. 5 singles. Lisa
Pugliese downed Stanford red
shirt senior Kim Shasby (5-3) in
straight sets, 6-0,6-4. Senior Amy
Chiminello (10-1) split sets with

Sophomore Ania Bleszynski and her teammates finished second at
the National Indoors this past weekend.
Nickitas at No. 6 singles, but lost
her first match of the season in
the third for a 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 defeat.
"We needed one more singles
match to get it 3-3," Brennan
said. "It would have been nice to
put a little pressure on them and
stall it out."
The Cardinal reached the title
match after bulldozing eighth
ranked Wake Forest in the semifi
nals, 5-1. Stanford was led by
strong performances in the top
three singles spots. Bleszynski
disposed of Terry Ann Zawacki,
ranked eleventh in collegiate ten
nis, 6-4, 6-4.
Schlukebir also took the No. 2
singles match in straight sets over
Cristina Caparis, 6-1, 6-3. De
Silva sent Demon Deacon Maggie
Harris off the court quickly with a
6-3, 6-0 triumph.
Scott outlasted Lule Aydin in a
first-set tiebreaker at No. 5 sin
gles and went on to take the sec
ond set 6-3 for the victory.
Chiminello won in straight sets
over Line Urling, 6-4, 6-0.
Wake Forest's only victory
came at No. 4 singles, as Nicola
Kaiwai earned a three-set win
over Shasby, 6-7, 7-5, 6-4. The
five singles victories made dou
bles play unnecessary.
