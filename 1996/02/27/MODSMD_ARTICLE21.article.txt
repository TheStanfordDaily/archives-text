### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Everything held true to form
last weekend at the Women's
Tennis National Indoor Team
Championships as the top-seeded
Florida Gators captured the in
door crown after defeating the
second-seeded Stanford Cardinal,
5-2.
The Cardinal (10-1, 2-0 Pacific
10 Conference Southern Divi
sion) breezed through their

bracket with only one relatively
difficult test, but met a tough
Florida squad (9-0) in the finals.
The Gators, like the Cardinal, re
turned every player from a team
that lost in the NCAA champi
onship match last season.
Florida, ranked No. 1 in the
country, clinched the title in dou
bles, as the No. 1 tandem of Dawn
Buth and Stephanie Nickitas
downed the Cardinal All-Ameri
can duo of junior Katie Schluke
bir and sophomore Ania Bleszyns

ki (3-3) by a score of 8-2. Buth and
Nickitas were undefeated in dou
bles in the Gators' four matches.
Florida took control of the dual
match in seizing four of the six
singles matches from the No. 3
Cardinal. Junior Sandra De Silva
(9-1) and sophomore Julie Scott
(9-0) posted Stanford's only victo
ries at No. 3 and No. 5 singles, re
spectively.
"They were a little too good for
us at this point," head coach
Frank Brennan said. "But I'm not
surprised. I kind of thought that
might happen, and frankly, it
would have been bad for us to
have beaten Florida.
"I think it would have hurt our
focus somehow. I mean they were
better than us, but if somehow we
got lucky, maybe an injury or
something happened, I think we
would have had a hard time the
rest of the year because we're re
ally not good enough yet."
De Silva's 3-6,6-0,6-2 win over
Divya Merchant gave the Cardi
nal their first point of the match,
and Stanford was able to extend
the match into doubles when
Scott pulled out a 6-4, 6-7, 7-5 tri
umph over Bonnie Bleeker.
The Gators were too powerful
up front for the Cardinal as both
Bleszynski (8-3) and Schlukebir
(8-2) dropped straight-set match
es at the No. 1 and No. 2 slots, re
spectively. Gator Jill Craybass,
the third-ranked singles player in
the nation, defeated Bleszynski,
6-1, 6-2, and Schlukebir fell to
Buth, 6-4, 6-3.
Florida's other points came at
No. 4 and No. 5 singles. Lisa
Pugliese downed Stanford red
shirt senior Kim Shasby (5-3) in
straight sets, 6-0,6-4. Senior Amy
Chiminello (10-1) split sets with


Red Byer â€” Daily file
Sophomore Ania Bleszynski and her teammates finished second at
the National Indoors this past weekend.
