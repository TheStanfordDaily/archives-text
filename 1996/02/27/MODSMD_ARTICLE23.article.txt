# Volleyball team loses third-straight match
## 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
Stanford 1 set
Northridge 3 sets

The fifth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team completed
its mini two-game road trip by
dropping its third game in a row,
losing to sixth-ranked Cal State-
Northridge 15-8, 10-15, 15-4, 15-
11. Even though the Cardinal
spikers got an outstanding game
from junior opposite Matt Fuer
bringer, the absence of junior
middle blocker Brian Moore for a
second straight game was too
much to overcome as the Mata
dors exploited the middle by rack
ing up 100 kills and hitting for a
.403 hitting percentage.
"We just didn't make good
enough adjustments [on our
blocking schemes]," said Stan
ford head coach Ruben Nieves.
"We didn't have our best blocker
on the court and it showed."
Game one started out slowly
for Stanford. They had moved
Fuerbringer opposite junior set
ter Stewart Chong in order to give
him lots of quick sets throughout
the match. Unfortunately, Chong
was erratic with his sets and
Northridge was playing error
free ball. These factors added up
to a quick 10-4 deficit for the Car
dinal. Nieves quickly pulled
Chong out of the game and re
placed him with freshman setter
PK Diffenbaugh. He was able to
rally the team some, but it proved

to be too late, as the Matadors' 20
first-game kills allowed them to
pull away for the one-game lead.
Taking the momentum from
game one, Stanford got going
quickly in the second game and
never trailed. Diffenbaugh was
passing effectively and forcing
several side outs. "He did a nice
job of settling us down," said
Nieves. Stanford's defense also

forced Northridge into 12 errors
and held it to only a .255 hitting
percentage. Meanwhile, Fuer
bringer kept putting down the
kills despite having two blockers
ganging up on him. He finished
with 48 kills on 79 attempts, good
for a .456 hitting percentage. "It
was pretty much the Matt Fuer
bringer show," Nieves said.
"Northridge knew what we were
doing but he kept putt ing the ball
away."
With Stanford winning its first
game since Feb. 17, things ap
peared to be turning around.

However, the Matadors had other
ideas. Northridge's defense shack
led the Cardinal in game three,
holding the squad to only a .184
hitting percentage. Diffenbaugh
was not able to muster the offense
he had earlier and his team fell be
hind 8-1. Chong came back in to
Finish the match as Northridge
took a two-games-to-one lead.
Game four produced the best
volleyball of the evening, as the
two teams combined for 65 kills
and high hitting percentages.
Stanford led early on and was tied
at five. Northridge inched ahead,

but the Cardinal continued to bat
tle all the way down the stretch.
Unfortunately, Stanford's 13
fourth-game errors were the dif
ference as Northridge completed
the four-game victory.
With the Cardinal suddenly 6-4
in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation, the need to get Moore
back in the lineup becomes all the
more urgent. "Our primary focus
now is to make the league play
offs," Nieves said. "|As for
Moore,) he's doubtful for the
match. But we'll know more [on
the status of his foot! tomorrow."
