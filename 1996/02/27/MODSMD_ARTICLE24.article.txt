# Still ringless after all this time
## Stanford looking for first championship of year 
### 
Today is Tuesday, February 27. Ex
actly five months after the start of
fall quarter. Eight weeks deep into
winter quarter.
Have you noticed something missing
from this page?
If you're a sports fan, as am I, then by
now you've probably taken note of the
fact that there's been a conspicuous ab
sence in The Stanford Daily sports page
this year — news of a Stanford national
championship.
That's right, folks — the world
renowned, national-powerhouse, Sears
Trophy-hogging, we-have-the-best-team

Stanford Department of Athletics has yet
to produce a NCAA champion this year.
And with spring quarter just around the
corner, some folks around these parts are
starting to get a little bit anxious.
Stanford has captured at least one na
tional title every year for the past 16
years. The school's 62 NCAA team cham
pionships — including 45 since 1980 —
places it at third in the nation all-time.
Last year at this time, the Cardinal had
already brought home two rings, in
women's volleyball and men's water polo,
and was well on its way to NCAA champi
onships in women's swimming and div
ing, men's gymnastics and men's tennis.
So what exactly is going on? Could this
signal the start of a decline in the overall
quality of Stanford's athletic teams? Is
the rest of the country finally catching up
to the Cardinal? Or is it just a case of bad
luck?
Things looked promising enough at the
start of the year. Women's volleyball went
on a tear after suffering early-season loss
es to Texas and Texas Tech. Water polo

looked strong, women's soccer was in the
top 10, even cross country and women's
field hockey were making a splash. So
men's soccer wasn't quite living up to ex
pectations — maybe it was just having an
off-year.
But as winter came around and the end
of fall quarter approached, things started
falling apart. Men's water polo went into
a tailspin and made an early exit from the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
championships in Long Beach, failing to
qualify for the NCAA championships held
right here on the Farm. So much for that

home-pool advantage.
Next was women's soccer. Coach lan
Sawyers' team got a bum deal in the
NCAA tournament seedings, as the Car
dinal was not only denied a first-round
bye, but also forced to play a top-10 oppo
nent in Santa Clara. Traveling to the
Broncos' Buck Shaw Stadium, the Cardi
nal lost a heartbreaker in three overtimes
and came home empty-handed, unable to
advance past the first round of tourna
ment play.
Ah, but we could all count on women's
volleyball to restore pride and honor to
the Farm by bringing home a title. Led by
the play of Carey Wendell and Kristin
