# Still ringless after all this time
## Stanford looking for first championship of year 
### 
Today is Tuesday, February 27. Ex
actly five months after the start of
fall quarter. Eight weeks deep into
winter quarter.
Have you noticed something missing
from this page?
If you're a sports fan, as am I, then by
now you've probably taken note of the
fact that there's been a conspicuous ab
sence in The Stanford Daily sports page
this year — news of a Stanford national
championship.
That's right, folks — the world
renowned, national-powerhouse, Sears
Trophy-hogging, we-have-the-best-team
in-the-nation-in-every-sport-besidos-
football-and-basketball, if-we-were-a
country-we-would-win-the-Olympics
Stanford Department of Athletics has yet
to produce a NCAA champion this year.
And with spring quarter just around the
corner, some folks around these parts are
starting to get a little bit anxious.
Stanford has captured at least one na
tional title every year for the past 16
years. The school's 62 NCAA team cham
pionships — including 45 since 1980 —
places it at third in the nation all-time.
Last year at this time, the Cardinal had
already brought home two rings, in
women's volleyball and men's water polo,
and was well on its way to NCAA champi
onships in women's swimming and div
ing, men's gymnastics and men's tennis.
So what exactly is going on? Could this
signal the start of a decline in the overall
quality of Stanford's athletic teams? Is
the rest of the country finally catching up
to the Cardinal? Or is it just a case of bad
luck?
Things looked promising enough at the
start of the year. Women's volleyball went
on a tear after suffering early-season loss
es to Texas and Texas Tech. Water polo

looked strong, women's soccer was in the
top 10, even cross country and women's
field hockey were making a splash. So
men's soccer wasn't quite living up to ex
pectations — maybe it was just having an
off-year.
But as winter came around and the end
of fall quarter approached, things started
falling apart. Men's water polo went into
a tailspin and made an early exit from the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
championships in Long Beach, failing to
qualify for the NCAA championships held
right here on the Farm. So much for that

home-pool advantage.
Next was women's soccer. Coach lan
Sawyers' team got a bum deal in the
NCAA tournament seedings, as the Car
dinal was not only denied a first-round
bye, but also forced to play a top-10 oppo
nent in Santa Clara. Traveling to the
Broncos' Buck Shaw Stadium, the Cardi
nal lost a heartbreaker in three overtimes
and came home empty-handed, unable to
advance past the first round of tourna
ment play.
Ah, but we could all count on women's
volleyball to restore pride and honor to
the Farm by bringing home a title. Led by
the play of Carey Wendell and Kristin


Bobby
Cuza
Folkl, Stanford cruised through
Pac-10 play and breezed past the
field at NCAA regionals, advanc
ing to the Final Four in Massa
chusetts. But that's where the
party ended for the Cardinal, as
Texas put an end to the women's
national championship aspira
tions in the national semifinal.
Normally, there would be no
reason for panic. But suddenly,
even the winter and spring sports
are floundering. Baseball, ranked
second in the nation at the start of
the season, has dropped to 10-7
overall. The men's golf team has
dropped out of the top 20 after fin
ishing second in last year's NCAA
championships. The seemingly
invincible men's tennis team lost
for the first time in 38 tries Sun
day went it was pounded 5-1 by
third-ranked UCLA at the finals
of the National Team Indoor
Championships.
It gets worse. The fourth
ranked men's volleyball team got
blanked this weekend by UCI.A
and UC-Santa Barbara. Women's
swimming had its streak of 55 con
secutive dual-meet victories

snapped by USC a month ago.
Even gymnastics has been hurting,
especially in the wake of the loss of
Tim Dalrymple for the men's team.
Of course, none of this would
even be an issue at most schools.
But unlike most universities with
lofty academic goals, Stanford has
a tradition of excellence in athlet
ics, particularly in non-revenue
sports. Sports fans at Stanford
have been spoiied to the point
where we expect to have a nation
al championship contender to
cheer on in every sport. Anything
less than No. 1 has become unac
ceptable.
No. 1 hasn't been an achieve
ment Stanford's been able to
boast about this year. But
there's still 3 1/2 months left in
the school year. Women's bas
ketball is 15-0 in Pac-10 play and
poised for a run at the Final
Four; men's and women's swim
ming are still looking strong;
and baseball, volleyball, tennis
and gymnastics still have a lot of
road ahead.
So don't count the Cardinal
out just yet. It's been a slow
sports year up until now, but just
give 'em a little bit of time —
somebody, sometime, in some
sport is going to bring home an
NCAA title. You just wait.

championships. The seemingly
invincible men's tennis team lost
for the first time in 38 tries Sun
day went it was pounded 5-1 by
third-ranked UCLA at the finals
of the National Team Indoor
Championships.
It gets worse. The fourth
ranked men's volleyball team got
blanked this weekend by UCI.A
and UC-Santa Barbara. Women's
swimming had its streak of 55 con
secutive dual-meet victories

snapped by USC a month ago.
Even gymnastics has been hurting,
especially in the wake of the loss of
Tim Dalrymple for the men's team.
Of course, none of this would
even be an issue at most schools.
But unlike most universities with
lofty academic goals, Stanford has
a tradition of excellence in athlet
ics, particularly in non-revenue
sports. Sports fans at Stanford
have been spoiied to the point
where we expect to have a nation
al championship contender to
cheer on in every sport. Anything
less than No. 1 has become unac
ceptable.
No. 1 hasn't been an achieve
ment Stanford's been able to
boast about this year. But
there's still 3 1/2 months left in
the school year. Women's bas
ketball is 15-0 in Pac-10 play and
poised for a run at the Final
Four; men's and women's swim
ming are still looking strong;
and baseball, volleyball, tennis
and gymnastics still have a lot of
road ahead.
So don't count the Cardinal
out just yet. It's been a slow
sports year up until now, but just
give 'em a little bit of time —
somebody, sometime, in some
sport is going to bring home an
NCAA title. You just wait.
