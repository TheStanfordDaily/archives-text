# Students paying top dollar for meal plans
## Survey ranks Stanford among the costliest 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
Students at Stanford are paying one of the
highest prices for food service in the nation,
according to a Daily survey of 12 selected
schools.
Stanford currently charges $3,692 for a 19
meals-per-week board plan, the most of any of
the surveyed schools, while UC-Berkeley stu
dents pay $1,675 for 19 meals per week — 45
percent of what Stanford students pay.
Meal plan prices will be one of the things
discussed when Housing and Dining Ser
vices undergoes an internal review later this
year. The department was recently put
under the responsibility of University Bud
get Director Timothy Warner, who called for
the review.
"There hadn't been this kind of a review
done for a while, so I felt that it would be good
to do," Warner said, adding that students will
be involved in the review process.

Next year, Stanford's Food Service prices
will increase 3.1 percent to $3,806 for 19
meals per week.
"The department wants to be confident
that we're being as efficient as possible," Din
ing Services Operations Manager Craig
Mitchell said.
Mitchell said his office has called for an in
ternal review for "quite some time."
The schools surveyed by The Daily were
chosen to provide a mixture of regional and
local schools, state and private schools, and
religious and secular schools. The schools sur
veyed were Stanford, Harvard University,
Yale University, USC, University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, Santa Clara University,
San Jose State University, Pennsylvania
State University, UCLA, Brigham Young
University, Oklahoma State University and
UC-Berkeley.
The average price for 19 meals a week at
the 10 schools that have compara
ble plans is $2,532.
"We realize that we are at the
high end of the market," Mitchell
said. "The way [Dining Services] is
set up, it is considerably more ex
pensive, because of Residential Ed
ucation. We operate 10 different fa
cilities and 35 different dining
rooms, whereas other schools like
USC and UCLA have only a few
central dining commons for the en
tire campus.
"Because of the programmatic
nature of Residential Education, we
are required to have the various, lo
calized dining halls," Mitchell said.
Res Ed programs are intended to
"extend the classroom into the resi
dences," according to the Res Ed
mission statement.
Mitchell also attributed the high
cost to other factors.
"Our labor costs are higher than
most places," Mitchell said. "The
union contract sets the wages for
our regular work force, and the Uni
versity and the Office of Financial

Aid set the wages for students."
Mitchell pointed out that it is
hard to compare meal plans from
school to school.
"There are different setups and
different attributes to consider," he
said.
The lowest-priced school in the
survey was UC-Berkeley, which
charges only $1,675 for 19 meals
per week. UC-Berkeley's dining ser
vices are not subsidized by the state,
so they must support themselves,
said Nancy Jurich, the school's as
sistant director of dining services.
UC-Berkeley keeps its board
costs very low by running a highly
centralized meal service, more cen
tralized than Stanford's, she said.
"We only serve meals at six loca
tions, and all meals are not served in
each facility," Jurich said. She said
some facilities serve up to 1,500 stu
dents per meal.
Jurich also noted that UC-
Berkeley's labor costs are much
lower than Stanford's, as students
and full-time workers are paid less.
Some of the other surveyed
schools are changing from plans of
fering a fixed number of meals per
week to different types of plans.
Santa Clara University, only

miles from Stanford, changed to a
quarterly declining-balance plan
this year. Students can use their
plans, which cost between $750 and
$950 per quarter, at any of four dif
ferent venues, said Pat Wilkinson,
director of administrative services
at Santa Clara. These venues in
clude traditional dining commons,
fast-food areas and a restaurant
Wilkinson compared to Fresh
Choice.
"Students am eat at any of these
venues for market price using their
plans," Wilkinson said.
University of Wisconsin also re
cently switched to a similar type of
meal plan. There, students pay a
certain amount, and that amount is
put on a debit card. Students can
put any amount of money on their
cards with no minimum. The stu
dents then pay for items with their
cards at the dining venues, said Wis
consin Asst. Food Director Mar
garet Monahan.
"It was a real gamble, but one
that was real successful for us,"
Monahan said.
Stanford Dining Services has
also made several recent changes.
For example, they have moved to "a
la board" plans — offering the tra

ditional all-you-can eat meals in ad
dition to individual items — at more
dining areas, Mitchell said.
"We're evolving, too," he said.
Despite the high prices and re
cent changes at Stanford, student
satisfaction with Dining Services is
not high. In a survey of 216 stu
dents conducted last spring by The
Daily, students gave Dining Ser
vices about a C+ average. Of the

216 students surveyed, only 14 gave
Dining Services a grade of A, while
34 D's and 4 F's were given.
However, students may have to
accept the high prices and their cur
rent level of satisfaction.
"We have a lot of overhead
charges, being at a large, private
university," Mitchell said. "Dining
Services has to absorb a large
amount of costs because of that."

versity and the Office of Financial

Aid set the wages for students."
Mitchell pointed out that it is
hard to compare meal plans from
school to school.
"There are different setups and
different attributes to consider," he
said.
The lowest-priced school in the
survey was UC-Berkeley, which
charges only $1,675 for 19 meals
per week. UC-Berkeley's dining ser
vices are not subsidized by the state,
so they must support themselves,
said Nancy Jurich, the school's as
sistant director of dining services.
UC-Berkeley keeps its board
costs very low by running a highly
centralized meal service, more cen
tralized than Stanford's, she said.
"We only serve meals at six loca
tions, and all meals are not served in
each facility," Jurich said. She said
some facilities serve up to 1,500 stu
dents per meal.
Jurich also noted that UC-
Berkeley's labor costs are much
lower than Stanford's, as students
and full-time workers are paid less.
Some of the other surveyed
schools are changing from plans of
fering a fixed number of meals per
week to different types of plans.
Santa Clara University, only

miles from Stanford, changed to a
quarterly declining-balance plan
this year. Students can use their
plans, which cost between $750 and
$950 per quarter, at any of four dif
ferent venues, said Pat Wilkinson,
director of administrative services
at Santa Clara. These venues in
clude traditional dining commons,
fast-food areas and a restaurant
Wilkinson compared to Fresh
Choice.
"Students am eat at any of these
venues for market price using their
plans," Wilkinson said.
University of Wisconsin also re
cently switched to a similar type of
meal plan. There, students pay a
certain amount, and that amount is
put on a debit card. Students can
put any amount of money on their
cards with no minimum. The stu
dents then pay for items with their
cards at the dining venues, said Wis
consin Asst. Food Director Mar
garet Monahan.
"It was a real gamble, but one
that was real successful for us,"
Monahan said.
Stanford Dining Services has
also made several recent changes.
For example, they have moved to "a
la board" plans — offering the tra

ditional all-you-can eat meals in ad
dition to individual items — at more
dining areas, Mitchell said.
"We're evolving, too," he said.
Despite the high prices and re
cent changes at Stanford, student
satisfaction with Dining Services is
not high. In a survey of 216 stu
dents conducted last spring by The
Daily, students gave Dining Ser
vices about a C+ average. Of the

216 students surveyed, only 14 gave
Dining Services a grade of A, while
34 D's and 4 F's were given.
However, students may have to
accept the high prices and their cur
rent level of satisfaction.
"We have a lot of overhead
charges, being at a large, private
university," Mitchell said. "Dining
Services has to absorb a large
amount of costs because of that."
