# Students paying top dollar for meal plans
## Survey ranks Stanford among the costliest 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
Students at Stanford are paying one of the
highest prices for food service in the nation,
according to a Daily survey of 12 selected
schools.
Stanford currently charges $3,692 for a 19
meals-per-week board plan, the most of any of
the surveyed schools, while UC-Berkeley stu
dents pay $1,675 for 19 meals per week â€” 45
percent of what Stanford students pay.
Meal plan prices will be one of the things
discussed when Housing and Dining Ser
vices undergoes an internal review later this
year. The department was recently put
under the responsibility of University Bud
get Director Timothy Warner, who called for
the review.
"There hadn't been this kind of a review
done for a while, so I felt that it would be good
to do," Warner said, adding that students will
be involved in the review process.

Next year, Stanford's Food Service prices
will increase 3.1 percent to $3,806 for 19
meals per week.
"The department wants to be confident
that we're being as efficient as possible," Din
ing Services Operations Manager Craig
Mitchell said.
Mitchell said his office has called for an in
ternal review for "quite some time."
The schools surveyed by The Daily were
chosen to provide a mixture of regional and
local schools, state and private schools, and
religious and secular schools. The schools sur
veyed were Stanford, Harvard University,
Yale University, USC, University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, Santa Clara University,
San Jose State University, Pennsylvania
State University, UCLA, Brigham Young
University, Oklahoma State University and
UC-Berkeley.
