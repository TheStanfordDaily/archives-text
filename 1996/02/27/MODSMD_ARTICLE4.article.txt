# Elections loom for party
## People's Platform has yet to finalize COP slate 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
At a meeting last night the People's Plat
form did not name a Council of Presidents
slate for the upcoming spring election, as
had been expected. The party, however, did
vote to endorse 10 undergraduate candi
dates for ASSU Senate.
"After meeting this afternoon, we decid
ed that we were not ready to present an
agenda with a specific set of issues to the
Platform at [last night's] slating meeting,"
said ASSU deputy senate chair Bill Shen,
one of the organizers of the party's slate.
"Names and faces are great, but a team
needs a clear message, and we felt that we
weren't ready with those specifics yet."
Shen added that he is confident he and
his running mate Angela Parker, a junior
who is an ASSU senator, will have a slate
ready by tomorrow, when they will meet
with the ASSU Elections Commission to
declare their candidacy.
"We have a lot of really strong candi
dates who have expressed interest in com
mitting themselves next year. . . . We'll
know by [tomorrow] the status of our
slate," Shen said. "We need to have it to
gether by then or else we won't get the en
dorsement we're seeking."
Late last week, one of the potential COP

candidates, junior Lindy Eichenbaum, de
cided not to run, causing Shen and Parker
to extend their search for the two remain
ing running mates.
When asked if he would form an inde
pendent COP slate in the event that the
People's Platform does not offer his slate
an endorsement, Shen said, "I'm not ruling
anything out."
Although the COP is still an open-ended
question, 10 undergraduates received the
party's endorsement to run in spring gen
eral elections.
After 20 students presented themselves
to the party and fielded questions about
their viewpoints and political goals, party
members voted to endorse juniors Evonne
Greenidge and Gilbert Serrano; sopho
mores Thomas Leung and Lisa Rubin; and
freshmen Edelina Burciaga, Phillip Coop
er, Joe Freund, Celia Garcia, Sonia Gonza
lez and Laudan Nabizadeh. They encour
aged the remaining students to run as Peo
ple's Platform affiliates.
Affiliates will have the party's support
throughout the race, but the party's en
dorsement will not appear on the ballot,
Shen said.
Reminding the audience of approximate
ly 100 in Tresidder's Oak West Lounge of
the party's history, current COP
member M ike Choo said the party
should continue its tradition of
advocating student-group fund
ing and speaking for students and
organizations whose voices are
traditionally unheard.

The People's Platform was
formed in 1986 primarily in re
sponse to ethnic center budget
cuts, Choo said.
Several candidates stressed
the importance of bridging com
munication gaps and strengthen
ing relations between the various
ethnic communities.
In response, Shen said, "A
lot of people have focused on
ethnic centers in their speech

es. The underlying commit
ment to the ethnic communities
goes without saying. What the
ASSU really needs ip people
with ideas and plans, students
who will be dynamic and effec
tive leaders."
Candidates also voiced con
cerns about increasing the
ASSU's efficiency and the stu
dent body's understanding of
what the senate does.
