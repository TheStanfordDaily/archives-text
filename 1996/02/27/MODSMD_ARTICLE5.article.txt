The initial ef
fects of the Com
mon Sense Fee
Reform Amend
ment to the
ASSU Constitu
tion will be seen
in tonight's
ASSU Senate
meeting, as the

number of student groups that
opted to seek funding from under
graduates and from the general
student body is revealed.
The fee reform, passed last
spring as a way of more fairly dis
tributing the cost of special fees
among graduate and undergradu
ate students, is projected to in
crease the amount undergraduates
will pay while decreasing graduate
fees.
Specifically, the amendment al
lows student organizations to re
quest fees from one of three voting
populations â€” undergraduates,
graduates or the entire student
body. ASSU business and service
projects, such as Legal Counseling
or the Speaker's Bureau, are re
quired to request the fee from the
entire student population.
Only the population from which
the fee is requested can vote on the
measure and the fee allocation
needs majority approval, or 15 per
cent of the total eligible student
body.

According to Lamar Baker, co
chair of the senate Appropriations
Committee, about half of this
spring's special-fee requests will be
directed toward undergraduates
only.
Although the application dead
line passed last week, the special
fee requests will not be finalized
until tonight's senate meeting,
Baker said. The exact statistics on
which groups will target whom will
be more accurate at that time, he
said.
Gavin Funabiki, chair of the
Asian American Student Associa
tion, said his group decided to apply
for only undergraduate funding
primarily because of the lack of
graduate participation in the orga
nization.
"[AASA] is mainly undergradu
ate-focused," he said. In the past,
most students would approve a
group's fee without actually partic
ipating in it, but over the past few
years approval has shifted to actual
participation, he said.
Although, "when you're looking
at the numbers, our special fee has
won with graduate support," he
added.
Eric Saxon, co-editor of the
Chaparral, said his publication will
only seek undergraduate funding
this year as well. The Common
Sense amendment is a welcome
change for the Chaparral, he added.
