# Bookworms Welcome
## Bookstore hosts monthly Book Group meetings 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
When you're in a book group, good books
can be more than just good reads — they can
also be a source of intellectual stimulation and
camaraderie. And when you're a member of
the Stanford Bookstore Book Group, you get
the added bonus of a lesson in cultural diversi
ty.
Once a month, a group
of book-lovers gathers
in the con

ference room at the Bookstore to talk about
books. Although there are fewer than 10 regu
lar participants, they come from as far away as
Israel, France and Germany.
"Most of the people come from very differ
ent backgrounds, so it's very interesting to see
how they interpret a text from their different
points of view — it's very stimulating," said
Sarit Avati-Elata, who is from Israel.
The Book Group, which the Bookstore
began last March, meets every third Thursday

of the month at 7 p.m. to dis
cuss contemporary fic

tion. Tricia Ready,

event coordinator

for the Bookstore,
helps guide the

discussions.
Keady said stu
dents usually

don't come to
the discus
sions, probably
because of time
constraints.
Most partici
pants are wo men

in their late
20s who either
work on cam

pus or live in
the area.

Though

the group is small,

it offers members a

chance to share their reading.

"We're on a major university with a thriving
intellectual environment, and yet for people

who don't have the opportunity to be in touch
with literature and talk about their ideas — for
instance, people working long hours in labs or
on other parts of campus — I think the Book
Group offers a great opportunity," said Keady.
Every meeting starts with free coffee or a
soft drink from the Bookstore. Then the dis
cussion begins.
The group generally goes around the table
and discusses reasons why people liked or dis
liked the book. Then they turn toward more in
depth issues, such as themes, symbols and
characters.
Bettina Assmann, whose husband works at
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, is origi
nally from Germany but came here two years
ago from France. Assmann said the Book
Group is different from book groups she be
longed to while in France.
"Here, they are more enthusiastic," Ass
mann said. "I think it's nice because it makes
literature more vivid.
"Sometimes I didn't like a book very much,
but after I went to the discussion I liked it a lot.
It's also nice because there are many national
ities, and there are many points of view that
you hadn't noticed before," she said.
The group decides at the end of their dis
cussion on a book to read for the next month.
Some of the books the group has recently read
include Jane Austen's "Sense and Sensibility,"
Wallace Stegner's "Angle of Repose" and
Michael Ondaatje's "The English Patient."
"I really love the group I have," said Keady,
adding that anyone is welcome to join. "As far
as growing, I would love to add more groups
and different styles of what people want to
read."
