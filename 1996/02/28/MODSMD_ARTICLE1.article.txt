# Senate postpones structural reform
## 'Constitution '96' tabled until next meeting 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
Debate on
reforms of the
ASSU Senate
continued at
last night's
meeting as sev
eral bills to re
form the orga
nizat i on ' s
structure were

tabled until the next meeting.
Bills intended to split up
"Constitution '96: A New Consti
tution for the ASSU" produced
heated debate as some senators
argued that the bill should re
main intact.
The original bill — authored
by senior Mike Slemmer and
sponsored by undergraduate

senator Andre Vanier — would
replace the current four-person
Council of Presidents with a sin
gle president and vice president,
reduce the size of the senate by
25 percent, give all senators the
right to vote and form a judicial
branch of the ASSU.
Discussion centered on a
move to amend the bill so each
reform would be addressed sepa
rately.
"Different parts of this bill
have been proposed repeatedly,"
said graduate senator Donald
Aingworth. "Why should we
force students to take it togeth
er? We owe it to the students to
let them decide on the individual
aspects."
But other senators felt that

dividing the bill would trivialize it.
"Making this bill into eight or
nine sections is the silliest thing
that I've ever heard, " said gradu
ate senator Bernard Gilroy. "Doing
that creates a muted hybrid which
defeats the whole purpose of this
document. The bill won't pass if
it's schizophrenic."
Although the bill itself was
tabled until the next Tuesday's
meeting, the issue of ASSU reform
reappeared later in the evening,
through a series of bills introduced
by COP member Rich Stolz.
With a few minor changes,
Stolz's bills separated all aspects of
"Constitution '96" into distinct
measures.
However, while debating these
bills, an argument broke out be
tween Senate Chair Alane Mur
dock and undergraduate senator
Stephen Russell on the legality of a
move by Russell to adjourn the
meeting.
Murdock labeled Russell's con
tinued attempts to move to ad
journ the meeting as "dilatory," or
an attempt to disrupt the body of
the meeting.
Russell's movements to adjourn
were discarded, and Stolz's bills
were tabled until the next meeting.
Many senators expressed frus
tration that the focus of the discus
sion had been on the merits of
splitting up proposed changes to
the ASSU, instead of on the value
of the change itself.
"We have not spent five minutes
discussing the merits of this de
bate," said graduate senator Paul
Hudson.
In other discussion, senators
voted on a bill to amend election
bylaws regarding campaign spend
ing limits. The bill failed to pass by
a vote of 6-8-2.
The bill would have imposed
new limits on campaign spending,
reducing the current spending
limit for independent and party
candidates for the senate from $90
to $60. Special-fee groups would
have been kept to a $500 limit.
Independent candidates and
members of the Students' Alliance
expressed their concern at the pro
posed bill.
"I don't know anyone who likes
this change," Russell said. "What
is the impetus for this change?
These rules are not enforceable."
A bill to place special-fee re

quests on the ballot was passed, al
though the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau request for a special fee was
considered separately.
In the discussion of the Speakers
Bureau requests for fees, senators
noted the rising costs allocated to
hotels and meals for speakers.
"We'd like to hold the special
fees as close to last year as possi
ble," said deputy senate chair Bill
Shen. "The Speakers Bureau had a
10 percent increase between their
requests and what was given last
year."

'I really think that riot
enough research has
been done and not all
the bases have been
covered on this
issue.'
— Angela Parker

However, an amendment was
passed which gives the Speakers
Bureau all requested fees.
Some of the liveliest discussion
of the evening was produced by a
bill titled, "To Put Some Fun Back
in the Special Fee."
According to the bill, if students
give $1 of their special fee to the
lottery each quarter, one lucky stu
dent will win free tuition for the
quarter.
The feasibility and legality of
this system was questioned by
many senators.
Questions were raised about
how graduate students, who are
often funded by grants, and stu
dents on financial aid would be af
fected.
"1 really think that not enough
research has been done and not all
the bases have been covered on this
issue." said undergraduate senator
Angela Parker.
The whole direction of the dis
cussion bothered one senator. "I'm
embarrassed that this bill is getting
more attention than anything we
have discussed all year," said Hud
son. "This makes us look terrible."
The bill was tabled until next
week's meeting.
Additionally, the senate passed
a bill titled, "To Promote Better
Preparation for Senate Meetings."
This bill, slated to take effect for
next year's senate, will ensure that
all bills will be distributed electron
ically prior to each meeting.
