# PINs will be necessary for Folio log in
## 
### Eric Kwiatkowski 
Beginning March 31, members of
the Stanford community will need
their personal identification num
bers to log in to Folio, the Universi
ty's main information database.
"The PIN will help us make sure
that Folio is used only by the Stan
ford community," said Lynn
Mcßae, manager of SUNet.
Students will enter the same
PIN number they currently use for
Axess, the student academic infor
mation database. Faculty and staff
will use the PIN from Prism, which
contains computer applications for
administrative tasks such as hiring
and purchasing.
By keeping PINs the same, the
University can use the number as
an information identifier which is
associated with a particular individ

ual and protects privacy for systems
users, Mcßae said.
There are growing risks of Folio
being used by people outside the
Stanford community as the Inter
net becomes a more common
means of communication.
But Mcßae said use of Folio by
outside parties is not a large prob
lem at this time, although he could
not provide any specific numbers.
The main reason for the switch to
PINs, he said, is to limit the use of
this service to members of the Stan
ford community.
Folio is a computer database
that contains an on-line catalog
for Stanford University libraries,
student information and Univer
sity policies and procedures. It
also lists resources for various de
partments. The database is run on
the central mainframe located in

Forsythe Hall.
Along with Stanford library and
information services, some of the
subject-specific databases of Folio
intended exclusively for the Univer
sity community are ERIC (educa
tional), ABI Inform (business and
management), and Biosis (biologi
cal sciences).
"The license agreements that we
have with various commercial data
providers such as ERIC require
that we restrict use of these data
bases to the primary clientele of
Stanford: faculty, students and
staff," said Karen Nagy, deputy
university librarian.
Requiring a PIN is a change in
policy from the time when Folio was
open to the public. In the past, there
have been minor security violations
with Folio, such as when users have
provided their identification num

bers to other people for access to the
system folder, Mcßae said.
Students without PINs should
notify staff at the Registrar's Infor
mation window in the Old Union
lobby, while faculty and staff
should contact Information Tech
nology Systems and Services cus
tomer assistance at 5-8181.
SUNet has not yet developed a
program to provide members of the
Stanford community with PINs,
said Chris Lundin, ITSS director of
customer relations.
Computers in the libraries will
not require system users to use the
log-in procedure. At the entrance,
library staff will continue to check
for Stanford identification. Visitors
to Stanford libraries without iden
tification must complete a form ex
plaining the reason for their visit,
Natrv said.
