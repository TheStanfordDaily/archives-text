# Work progresses on Jasper Ridge trails

Stanford's Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve
— a site of important environmental research
better known by students as a destination for
science class field trips — is doing significant
trail work this spring.
The preserve is an accessible wilderness rich
with plants and animals. It is one of the best
preserved wildlands in the Bay Area and is the
site of university research, educational tours
and undergraduate and graduate level class lab
work, according to W.G. Ernst, professor of ge
ological and environmental sciences
"Jasper Ridge gives students a feeling for the
habitat and ecology of Northern California," he
said. Ernst frequently takes students in his
classes on a tour of the preserve so they can see
the interaction of the biota.
"Everybody gets a lot out of it," Ernst said.
Jasper Ridge is also an important part of
graduate research at the University. Studies in
biochemical recycling and carbon dioxide are
currently underway at the preserve. Graduate

students are trying to find out how levels of car
bon dioxide affect plants. This research could
be a breakthrough in carbon dioxide recycling
studies, Ernst said.
"It is very important to see how some plants
react with carbon dioxide," he said. "So far,
some plants have been able to retain moisture
better wit h high levels of carbon dioxide."
Because Jasper Ridge is the site of such valu
able research and educational tours, it is very
important to maintain all of its trails, said
Philippe Cohen, administrative director of
Jasper Ridge.
Last fall the Mapache trail, which is in the
wetlands of the preserve, became extremely
muddy. According to Cohen, "Mapache needed
to be rerouted and made more accessible."
Jasper Ridge signed a contract with the Trail
Center of Palo Alto to reroute the trail. Since
December, volunteers and crew members from
the Trail Center have been working on the Ma
pache trail and plan to finish by June.
According to Cindy Stead, coordinator of the
Trail Center, the center is a non-profit organi

zation that is dedicated to improving access to
the Bay Area's natural sites. This is the first
time the center has worked at Jasper Ridge, but
it has built trails all over Santa Clara, San
Mateo, Santa Cruz and San Francisco counties.
The Trail Center's programs include trail in
formation, trial building and restoration and
trail mapping, Stead said. Most of the work is
done by volunteers who respond to advertise
ments posted throughout the Bay Area. Many
Stanford students and groups have taken part
in Trail Center events.
The volunteers recently built three-fourths
of a mile of Mapache, and they will continue
next month. In addition to rerouting the trail,
volunteers intend to build wood-planking
crossways to make it easier for touring.
Rerouting is a difficult task because much of
the trail is filled with poison oak, rat nests and
gullies.
The crew is also building the trail so as to
avoid a swampy part of Mapache that has made
it difficult for researchers and hikers to reach a
bird-watching area.
