## Forbes captures Arizona Dole victorious in North and South Dakota primaries 
### 
(AP) — Flat-tax champion
Steve Forbes captured Arizona's
winner-take-all primary yester
day, shocking Pat Buchanan and
Bob Dole to seize an improbable
lead in the turbulent Republican
presidential race. Stung in the
night's showdown contest, Dole
took some solace in winning
North and South Dakota.
For Forbes, the dramatic Ari
zona win meant back-to-back vic
tory celebrations after disap
pointing fourth-place showings
in lowa and New Hampshire had
his candidacy in jeopardy.
The publishing heir won
Delaware's primary Saturday,
and used that boost — and anoth
er major personal investment in
TV ads — to surge past
Buchanan and Dole in the final
weekend of Arizona campaigning.
Forbes was ecstatic with his
victory. "We believe deeply that
America has the potential for the
greatest economic boom and spir
itual renewal in its history," he
told cheering supporters in
Phoenix.

"A week ago they wrote our
obituary," he said. "Now tonight
we can perhaps write the obitu
ary of conventional political pun
ditry in America."
Buchanan could only be disap
pointed. He drew enthusiastic
crowds throughout the final
weekend and asserted an Ari
zona win would make him the
clear front-runner. Instead, he
came away empty handed head
ing into Saturday's showdown in
South Carolina.
Dole flatly predicted a South
Carolina victory, and the contest
shapes up as his last best chance
to launch a turnaround. Forbes
trails way back in South Caroli
na, while Buchanan has been
inching up. Dole left no doubt he
considered the more conserva
tive Buchanan the bigger threat
in the South.
With one-third of Arizona's
vote tallied, Forbes was leading
with 36 percent. Buchanan and
Dole were battling for second;
exit polling suggested Buchanan
had the edge.

Lamar Alexander was a dim
afterthought on the first multi
state primary day of the muddled
GOP campaign and some leading
Dole supporters said it was time
for the former Tennessee gover
nor to get out of the way.
Yesterday's results put Forbes
well ahead in The Associated
Press delegate count, with 60 so
far. Buchanan had 37 and Dole
36, while Alexander had 10 dele
gates.
A candidate needs 996 dele
gates to win the Republican nom
ination and the success of the
anti-establishment candidates
sparked talk in Republican cir
cles yesterday of a contested con
vention.
The dramatic comeback gave
Forbes improbable momentum
in the nomination chase, with a
critical, crowded stretch of pri
maries just ahead. Party leaders
anxious to see Buchanan
blocked from the nomination
would surely turn quick atten
tion to the deep-pocketed
Forbes' candidacy.
