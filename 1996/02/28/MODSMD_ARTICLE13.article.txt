# U.S. ambassador releases tapes of the Cuban pilots' conversation

### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The
Cuban fighter pilots saw the small white
and blue Cessna they were tracking, and
their excitement was palpable.
"The target is in sight, the target is in
sight. It's a small aircraft," the MiG-29
pilot radioed back to his ground con
troller.
"The white and blue small aircraft. At
a low altitude, a small aircraft," a MiG
-23 pilot flying on his wing added. "Give
me instructions."
"Fire," was the ground controller's
answer. "Authorized to destroy."
Fifty-three seconds later came the
response from the MiG-29 pilot: "First
launch."
"We took out his balls," the MiG-29
pilot shouted as his missiles struck the
U.S.-owned Cessna.
"This one won't mess around any
more," the other pilot said.
Two-and-a-half minutes later, the
pilots sighted the second Cessna.
"You are authorized to destroy it,"
the ground controller said.
"The other is destroyed, the other is
destroyed," the MiG-29 pilot shouted
two minutes later. "Fatherland or death

. . . the other is down also."
These were some of the transcripts
U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright
released yesterday of conversations
between Cuban pilots and their control
tower last Saturday when two small
American-owned planes were shot down
north of Cuba.
Albright, who earlier in the day
orchestrated a Security Council state
ment that "strongly deplores" the
attack, said she was "struck by the joy of
these pilots in committing coldblooded
murder."
"Frankly, this is not 'cojones' (balls,
or testicles, in Spanish). This is cow
ardice," Albright said at a news confer
ence.
U.S. officials said the transcripts were
"authoritative" but would not give their
source.
The Cuban aircraft never warned the
Cessnas by dipping their wings or hail
ing them on the radio before shooting
them down, Albright said, adding the
Cessnas "posed no threat at all."
The planes belonged to Brothers to
the Rescue, a Miami-based group of
Cuban exiles. The four Cuban-Ameri

cans aboard the two planes are pre
sumed dead.
There was no indication in the tran
script that either Cuban pilot believed
the U.S.-owned Cessnas were armed.
Albright also released charts showing
that one Cessna was shot down 3 1/2
miles outside Cuban airspace and the
other was destroyed 18 miles north of
Cuban airspace as it was fleeing the area.
A third Cessna returned to Florida.
The release of the transcript came as
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto
Robaina arrived at the United Nations to
present his government's version of
events.
"We have been the ones who were
attacked. We have been the ones pro
voked," Robaina said. "Our sovereignty
is the one that has been violated."
Cuba has said the planes were shot
down over its territorial waters, which
the United States denies.
Albright, who is serving as president
of the Security Council, said she would
meet with Robaina if he asks. She also
said she would consult with other mem
bers of the council to see what actions
could be taken.
