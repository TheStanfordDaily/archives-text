CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
(AP) — The plot thickened yes
terday: NASA managed to com
municate with the escaped satel
lite-on-a-cord and discovered it
had a dead computer and an
empty gas tank.
"There has been an event on
the satellite that we do not
understand yet," Mission Con
trol told the astronauts aboard
space shuttle Columbia.
NASA officials said they were
uncertain whether the satellite
problems had anything to do
with Sunday night's break in the
12-mile cord. They also did not

know whether these problems
would have occurred if the satel
lite had remained attached to
Columbia.
All data indicated the satellite
was fine when it broke loose
from Columbia and for at least
30 minutes afterward. Stray
voltage or circuitry trouble may
have caused the satellite systems
to malfunction, NASA said.
"It's a very interesting puz
zle," said NASA's Anthony
Lavoie, chief engineer for the
satellite. "We don't have all the
answers right now."
Engineers at Johnson Space

Center in Houston sent radio
commands to the satellite as it
soared overhead, hoping to find
clues as to what caused the cop
per, nylon and Teflon cord to
snap without warning.
NASA was surprised to find
that one of the main computers
and a gyroscope were not work
ing and that valves on both
nitrogen-gas thrusters were
open. All 100 pounds of gas had
spewed out.
Controllers later managed to
turn on that gyroscope and
closed all thruster valves on the
wobbly craft, which was drag

ging 12.2 miles of cord. They
also activated all four science
instruments on the satellite to
monitor surrounding electrical
and magnetic fields as well as
the motion of the satellite and
the tether.
The fact that it's working at
all is "extraordinary despite all
that it's been through," said
astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman.
The half-ton satellite — the
heart of what was a $400 million
plus experiment to generate elec
tricity in orbit — has enough bat
tery power to allow communica
tion for another one or two days.
