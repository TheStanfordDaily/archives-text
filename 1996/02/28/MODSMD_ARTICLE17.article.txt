U S West buys cable company
NEW YORK (AP) - The regional phone
company U S West said yesterday its media
group has reached an agreement to buy the
nation's third-biggest cable television system
operator, Continental Cablevision, in a $10.8
billion deal.
The deal vastly increases U S West's clout in
the telecommunications field where phone and
cable companies are scrambling to become one
stop providers of phone service, TV program
ming and other services like home shopping.
It is the biggest deal since the Feb. 8 enact
ment of a law that gives local- and long-distance

telephone companies and cable system owners
greater authority to get into each other's busi
nesses.
U S West is already a major investor in the
cable systems controlled by Time Warner Inc.,
the nation's second-biggest cable system owner
with about 11.5 cable subscribers. The new deal
would give U S West direct ownership of sys
tems with about 4.7 million subscribers.
Single father wins bake-off
DALLAS (AP) — Kurt Wait's Macadamia
Fudge Torte was a rich confection indeed:
He won $1 million yesterday as the first man
ever to capture the grand prize at the Pills

bury Bake-Off.
The health-care sales analyst and self
taught cook mixed up devil's food cake mix,
canned sliced pears and nuts, with a butter
scotch-caramel-fudge topping. One serving a
whopping 460 calories, 140 of them from fat.
The 43-year-old single father from Redwood
City, Calif., also won a $10,000 kitchen
makeover after viewers of a network TV special
voted his recipe the most appealing.
Wait competed against dozens of other cooks
from around the country in the 37th Super
Bowl of baking. There have been 32 male win
ners in the past, but none had walked away
with the top award.
