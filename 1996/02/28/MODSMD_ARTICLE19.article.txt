Res Comp must examine
the loss of Row key and
issues of responsibility

IF A STUDENT loses a room
key, he or she must request a
new one and pay approxi
mately $70 to re-key the room —
a measure necessary to maintain
proper security. Last week, when
someone associated with Resi
dential Computing lost the grand
master key to all Row houses,
the situation appeared analo
gous, simply on a larger scale:
Whoever is responsible for losing
the key should pay the cost of re
keying each room on the Row, or
so it seemed.
Unfortunately, the case is not
that simple. Taking responsibility
for re-keying the Row is not as
easy as re-keying a single room.
Housing and Dining Services esti
mates that the total cost of the job
will be more than $100,000,
which seems to be too much for
one person to pay. In addition, the
details of the incident are still
rather murky. Residential Com
puting is not sure exactly who is
responsible for losing the master
key. The person they believe last
checked out the key claims to
have returned it.
Because of the high cost and
the lack of accountability, Resi
dential Computing is footing the
bill. Director Jeff Merriman said
that his organization does not
have the financial resources to
re-key each row house, but that
it "has to do it, because of securi
ty reasons." He added that Resi
dential Computing "is getting
this done and worrying about the
cost later."
Merriman has said that Resi
dential Computing will not trans
fer the cost to students. Instead of
raising bills, it will probably have
to forfeit some programs it has
planned or cut back on ones it has

already implemented. However,
by cutting its budget, the depart
ment transfers the re-keying cost
to students in a more damaging
way. Any student who uses any
aspect of the University's com
puter network will be held
responsible for the loss, albeit in
an indirect manner. Students will
pay for the re-keying not in dol
lars, but in computing resources.
The University should have
taken steps to prevent such a
large loss from occurring. The
only keys available to anyone
reqiring access to a computer
facilities room — which could
mean a computer cluster or an
individual SUNet-wired dorm
room — are either keys that can
open only individual rooms or
the grand master key, which
opens every room on the Row.
There is no intermediate-level
key designed to open only a cer
tain area — such as all computer
clusters.
The incident has forced Hous
ing and Dining to look into mak
ing such limited-access keys, thus
eliminating the need to use the
grand master key in these situa
tions and reducing the cost of pos
sible key losses.
Although this is a step in the
right direction, it does not solve
Residential Computing's current
problem. Merriman claims the
individual who last checked the
key out cannot be held responsi
ble because he claims to have
returned it. However, if the
department kept strict records of
checking out and returning keys
— signing them out and back in,
for example — the individual who
lost the key should not be able to
claim his innocence so easily.
Residential Computing should
launch a serious investigation
into incident to determine
responsibility. They owe this both
to themselves — because they are
taking the blame unnecessarily —
and to Stanford students, who
should not have to relinquish the
services they receive from Resi
dential Computing.
