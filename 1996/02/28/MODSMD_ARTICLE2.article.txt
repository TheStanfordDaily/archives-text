The spotlight of world oolitics
will fall on Stanford next month
when Fernando Henrique Car
doso, president of Brazil and es
teemed scholar, speaks about his
country's role in the international
community.
On March 11, Cardoso will de
liver a speech titlod "In Praise of
Politics" in Auditorium.

During the
speech, Cardoso
is expected to an
nounce a joint
venture between
Brazil and bian
ford's Center for
Latin American
Studies, said
Both Frankland,
the center's pub
lic program coor-

dinator. The center is co-sponsor
ing the speech with the Institute
for International Studies.
Frankland could not comment
at this time on the specifics of the
joint venture, saying it is best to
wait until the speech.
Cardoso, a former visiting schol
ar at Stanford in the 1980s, was a
co-collaborator with the center's

director, Terry Karl, and Political
Science Prof. Philippe Schmitter,
said Frankland. Cardoso's rela
tionship with the faculty probably
facilitated his decision to come to
the University, she added.
Food Research Prof. Walter Fal
con, director of the Institute for In
ternational Studies, praised Car
doso as a "distinguished" scholar of
politics and economics.
"We are anxious to have leading
political figures from all over the
world come speak at Stanford,"
Falcon said. "We haven't had a se
nior Latin American lecturer in
some time and the time was right
for him to come."
Cardoso - will visit the Bay Area
en route to his first state visit to
Japan.
After serving as Brazil's finance
minister and minister of external
affairs, Cardoso assumed the pres
idency in early 1995. He won 52
percent of the popular vote in the
1994 elections.
He holds a doctorate in social
sciences from the University of Sao
Paulo and was named a professor
of political sciences there in 1968.
He has taught at institutions in
cluding Stanford, UC-Berkeley,


Cardoso
Universite de Paris, Cambridge
University and the University of
Chile.
His speech is part of the Robert
Wesson Lecture Series in Interna

tional Relations Theory and Prac
tice, which was established in
1988 by the Institute for Interna
tional Studies. The series brings
prominent scholars in interna
tional relations to Stanford each
year.
"The purpose of the lectures is
to encourage students to study in
ternational relations in a theoreti

cal and analytic framework," said
Elizabeth Nichols, manager of
public affairs for the institute.
Past lecturers have included
Mikhail Gorbachev's chief adviser,
current Stanford Provost Con
doleezza Rice, and former special
assistant to President Kennedy,
McGeorge Bundy.
