## Just say no to Taco Bell 
### 
IN FRIDAY'S DAILY, Dean of Students
Marc Wais was quoted as saying any
eatery in Tresidder must meet two cri
teria: "[They] must provide a low-cost
menu. And second, they must remain open
late in the evening."
I suggest a third criteria: Whoever runs
the eatery must follow a corporate ethic
consistent with the goals of this University
and with the morals of the individuals who
make up our community. Taco Bell can eas
ily meet the first two criteria; it fails
abysmally on the third.
Taco Bell is owned and operated by Pep
siCo — a company with a human rights
record that makes Darth Vader look angel
ic and Ollie North seem affable. PepsiCo
runs a bottling plant in Burma and, in so
doing, helps to fund a military dictatorship
that gained power by shooting thousands of
non-violent student protesters in 1988,
imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung
San Suu Kyi for six years, uses slave labor,
refused to cede power to a democratically
elected government in 1990, recklessly logs
pristine forests and is partly responsible for
much of our imported heroin. This oppres
sive dictatorship receives nearly all its
financial support from the foreign invest
ment banned from Burma before 1988.
These undisputed facts should be
enough to deter anyone interested in
doing business in Burma. However, they
aren't strong enough to deter PepsiCo and
they aren't even strong enough for Pepsi-

Co to act in a forthright manner. PepsiCo
hasn't released information regarding
how much of its money goes into military
coffers. The company has refused to
answer questions regarding its possible
use of slave labor in counter-trade prac
tices. PepsiCo has even promoted the dic
tatorship at trade shows. The Burmese
military government prohibits anyone to
research the situation in Burma and Pep
siCo certainly refuses to help.
While it is somewhat possible to form a
cogent argument favoring PepsiCo's opera
tions in Burma, it is almost impossible to
argue that Stanford should ignore the situ
ation and blithely sponsor an eatery that
may be leading to the oppression of mil
lions. To do this is to spit in the face of con
servative Republican senators, 10 Nobel
Peace Prize winners, the Stanford Invest
ment Responsibility Committee and a giant
international investment movement work
ing for what Desmond Tutu has called
"The South Africa of the '905."
In Stanford's original charter, the Uni
versity claims to be founded to "promote
the public welfare by exercising an influ
ence on behalf of humanity and civilization,
teaching the blessings of liberty regulated
by law." With this charter, and with our
humanity, comes a burden to exercise
responsibility beyond the confines of our
serene campus. It brings with it a burden to
think about where our millions are going
and to avoid acting like leeches sucking up

all the cheapest late-night tacos we can find
if doing so funds forces diametrically
opposed to liberty.
I am afraid of two things. The first is
arriving next fall to find a Taco Bell
wormed into the center of campus. The
second is a divorce between Stanford and
Taco Bell for "undisclosed reasons" — per
haps because the administration fears the
daily pickets that have marked several
other campus Taco Bells.
Stanford must not side-step this critical
issue; rather, it must meet it head on.
Stanford must write an open letter to Pep
siCo explaining the situation in Burma
and why many at Stanford are concerned
with the idea of a campus Taco Bell. Then,
the burden of responsibility should shift to
PepsiCo to convince us that Aung San Suu
Kyi and the Burmese democratic forces
are wrong. If PepsiCo ignores our ques
tions or responds with bureaucratic jar
gon, as they have every other time they've
been asked, then another restaurant must
sate our late-night hunger.
Camus once wrote "I would like to be
able to love justice and love my country
too." We should be able to love justice and
love Stanford too.
