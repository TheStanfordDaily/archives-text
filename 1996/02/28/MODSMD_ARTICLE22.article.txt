Examination in order
for University's Greek
housing regulations
My letter is regarding an article in
Monday's Daily which stated that the
"Zeta Psi fraternity has been promised
the former Delta Tau Delta house if
they meet certain University condi
tions." I find it troublesome and dis
turbing that the University continues to

set aside special housing for fraternal
organizations.
Fraternities are not open social clubs
they have selective standards of admit
tance, based on nebulous requirements.
And they blatantly exclude at least 50
percent of the Stanford undergraduate
community — women.
Stanford University's housing policy
therefore discriminates against women
by setting aside prime living spaces for
the sole use of men. I ask the University
to consider by what merits fraternal
organizations have privileged access to

housing. I also suggest that the Univer
sity investigate the questionable legality
of their discriminatory housing policies.

Superfan should return
to Sixth Man section
The debate over whether or not
Superfan should sit in the student sec
tion was ended with the men's basket

ball team's loss to Washington State
Thursday night. With Superfan off on
the side with the band, the student
section — as well as the rest of Maples
— lay as dormant as a SLE dorm on
Friday night. The facts are clear:
Stanford is 11-0 this year with Super
fan at mid-court and 0-1 without him.
Bring back Superfan to his rightful
home.
