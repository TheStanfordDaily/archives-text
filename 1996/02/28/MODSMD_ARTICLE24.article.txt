## Approaching graduation: It ain't over 'til its over 
### 
I HAVE EVERY intention of graduat
ing this June. All the units will be fin
ished, all the books returned, all the
phone bills paid or at least conveniently
misplaced — everything is ready to go, and
I was too, until I forgot to sign up. Seniors
had until midnight Sunday to let the cal
ligraphist know that they intended to get
saucy and walk wackily this summer, but
by the time I logged in and figured out
whether birth date comes before Social
Security prefix in the PIN code Stanford
assigned me four years ago and which I
still haven't gotten around to changing,
that pesky SUL2 server closed its doors
for the night, leaving me staring at a Mac
intosh and wondering if this means I can
live in Rains next year.
The small nuisance of requesting a
diploma might have slipped my mind
because I think I glimpsed a snapshot of
graduation last Saturday in Maples
Pavilion, at the last home game this sea
son for the men's basketball team. It was
Senior Night, a rite repeated in virtually
every sport at America's finer colleges,
when players display their wares for the
last time on campus, receive flowers and

hug their adoring parents, and bid
farewell to classmates and teachers. For
seniors watching from the bleachers,
such ceremonies are, perhaps, a reminder
that the days draw short for us too. I defy
anyone given to the slightest sentiment
to resist the cool, bittersweet rush you
feel on your back when each departing
name is introduced.
To those who pick up a Daily daily, the
facts about this year's basketball team are
well-known. Early in the year, Stanford
lost one of its best players to injury, and
two weeks ago, its most assiduous. Despite
this adversity, a fair observer would con
cede that the Cardinal has fashioned a
solid season, and as of this week they are
rated the 25th-best team in the nation. It
came within one lackluster game of finish
ing the year unbeaten at home. In Jan
uary, the team proved that for at least one
day they were better than the defending
national champions.
I have never spoken to any of the four
seniors honored Saturday, but I suspect
that given time to reflect, they will all find
satisfaction in their progress as individu
als and as a unit since 1992-93, when

Stanford trotted out for 30 games and lost
23. Who knew then what would become of
them? Darren Allaway was promising, but
also gangly, raw and English; Dion Cross
streaky but frighteningly frail. David Har
bour adjusted to his newly reattached fin
ger and Andy Poppink observed the whole
season from the sideline.
Watching this unheralded group devel
op since then has been a minor revelation.
None are blessed with surpassing natural
skill. But when they are at the top of their
game, moving tirelessly through mazes of
giant men, methodically working toward
the open three-point shot or lay-up, these
players are an efficient marvel, a testa
ment to the hackneyed virtues of team
work and patience. •**
These four, as we acknowledged Sat
urday, have made good use of their time
at Stanford. The whole lot of us nearing
completion of our undergraduate years
have too — through growth in our
respective ecosystems, in our grappling
with once-strange people and how to live
with them. But few seniors are actually
thinking about that right now. Instead,
most of my friends are slogging through

the most anxious, uncertain time of their
lives. Pondering where we will be next
autumn and who we will be with drives a
good number of us to mid-lecture distrac
tion, and when we aren't losing sleep
about the future, we might wonder
whether taking more economics classes
during sophomore year would have
helped in last week's job interview.
We aren't alone, which provides even
less comfort. Patrick Buchanan has met
with sobering success this winter not
simply because he appeals to the darkest
and most ancient hatreds in the Ameri
can character but because he speaks to
anxieties new and peculiar to the republic
at the fin de siecle. Ours is a culture
ensconced in fear and loathing. Ameri
cans seem to arise in the morning already
occupied by some large premonition, that
their jobs will ultimately vanish to Singa
pore or cyberspace, that Medicare really
will wither on the vine, that ultraviolet
rays and second-hand smoke, if not the
World Bank and Microsoft, are leading
the species to extinction.
Of course, all this worry about the next
millennium or next week profits us little.

We might instead find antidotes in the
passing moment. Stanford seniors have
three months left at this red-tiled play
ground; enough time to begin a novel and
take up a foreign language, to seek out the
unfamiliar face or the forgotten one and
— pardon the pep-talky tone this piece has
assumed — leave Stanford a better place
than when we arrived. We can still van
quish the regrets about the paths we
didn't pursue and thank each other we
chose the ones we did.
The basketball team's four seniors cer
tainly didn't save their best home game
for last. They struggled for most of it, even
falling behind in the second half before
righting themselves and polishing off an
unspectacular win. To their credit, when
the game ended, they engaged in no woof
ing or net-cutting, instead waving politely
to the cheering crowd and jogging away
with dispatch and purpose. They recog
nized that a few games still remain in this,
their last season. The rest of us need ask
no less of ourselves.

cans seem to arise in the morning already
occupied by some large premonition, that
their jobs will ultimately vanish to Singa
pore or cyberspace, that Medicare really
will wither on the vine, that ultraviolet
rays and second-hand smoke, if not the
World Bank and Microsoft, are leading
the species to extinction.
Of course, all this worry about the next
millennium or next week profits us little.

We might instead find antidotes in the
passing moment. Stanford seniors have
three months left at this red-tiled play
ground; enough time to begin a novel and
take up a foreign language, to seek out the
unfamiliar face or the forgotten one and
— pardon the pep-talky tone this piece has
assumed — leave Stanford a better place
than when we arrived. We can still van
quish the regrets about the paths we
didn't pursue and thank each other we
chose the ones we did.
The basketball team's four seniors cer
tainly didn't save their best home game
for last. They struggled for most of it, even
falling behind in the second half before
righting themselves and polishing off an
unspectacular win. To their credit, when
the game ended, they engaged in no woof
ing or net-cutting, instead waving politely
to the cheering crowd and jogging away
with dispatch and purpose. They recog
nized that a few games still remain in this,
their last season. The rest of us need ask
no less of ourselves.
