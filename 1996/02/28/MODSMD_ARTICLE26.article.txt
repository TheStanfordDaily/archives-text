# College Bowl wins regionals
## Team loses only one game, advances to national competition 
### Allison Twist 
Although not accompanied by the fanfare expect
ed of most regional tournaments, another of Stan
ford's teams advanced to national competition last
weekend.
After winning its regional tournament on Satur
day, Stanford's College Bowl Club team advanced
to the College Bowl Incorporated national competi
tion to be held at Arizona State University April 26
to 28.
"Despite last year's losses due to graduation,
the team performed very well," said senior Matt
Kaufman. "We fulfilled all expectations we had."
The Cardinal dropped only one game throughout
the 11-team competition and won the best-of
three final against UC-Davis, 195-150 and 275-
135.
"We are going into nationals feeling really confi
dent," Lee Kenyon said. "I believe we are capable of
beating any team on any day .. . it's just a matter of
who's playing well."
The national competition will bring together the
winners of each of the 15 College Bowl Incorporated
designated regions. Because most college bowl com
petition is concentrated on the East Coast, it is diffi
cult for Cardinal team members to predict what the
level of competition will be.
The regional elimination of perennial powerhous
es Harvard and Brigham Young Universities adds
another element of uncertainty to the champi
onships.
"Things are left up in the air this year because

Harvard did not advance," Kenyon said. "I don't
think there's any one favorite now — anything can
happen."
College Bowl Incorporated competition utilizes
two seven-minute halves. Four people compose each
team. They are asked two types of questions — toss
ups and bonuses.
During a toss-up, worth 10 points, team members
are not allowed to discuss answers with one another.
If the team answers the question correctly, members
are given the chance to answer a bonus question
worth up to 30 points.
"The format is very speed-oriented," said fresh
man Brad Harris, third-ranked scorer in the tour
nament. "Questions come from a variety of sub
jects and do not need to be solely academic in na
ture."
Team captain Roger Lee, a graduate student who
was the tournament's top scorer, and sophomore
Rachel Kolman Marshak complete the team heading
to nationals.
In order to prepare for tournaments, the team
meets once a week for two hours to simulate a match.
Independently, team members scan publications
such as Newsweek, The New York Times and People
magazine in order to find solutions to the bowl's triv
ia-type questions.
"We are looking forward to nationals," Kenyon
said. "Although our team is not necessarily stronger
than it was last year, we are certainly more balanced.
Our performance at regionals bodes well for a bright
future, especially since we will not graduate anyone
this year."
