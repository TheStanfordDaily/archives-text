## Sorting out the NCAA tournament picture A 						sports writer looks ahead to March Madness 
### 
Trading the beat writer's micro
scope for the telescope of a colum
nist, I spy with my little eye the
NCAA tournament on the horizon. With
a separation between the haves and the
have-nots taking place during last week
end's action, four Pac-10 teams — UCLA,
Arizona, Stanford and Cal — find them
selves jockeying for berths in the field of
64.
With no nationally dominant team in
the Pac-10, less and less attention has
been drawn out west. With UCLA head
ing down the stretch last year as the No.
1 team, that gave every other Pac-10
team a little boost in the eyes of the selec
tion committee. Hence, a conference
record five teams got into the tourna
ment.

While UCLA has done its part to run
away from the rest of the conference (and
thus ensure an automatic berth), nation
ally the Bruins don't stack up like they
did last year. UCLA has hovered in the
mid-teens in the Associated Press top 25
all season and stumbled when the spot
light was brightest, dropping five non
conference games. While all five of those
teams will probably be in the NCAA tour
nament, it didn't help the Pac-10 shed its
image of a patsy conference.
Whatever damage the Bruins might
have done to the Pac-10's reputation,
Arizona has tried its hardest to change
these perceptions. Starting off the year
by winning the Preseason NIT rocketed
the Wildcats back into the rankings, and
now Arizona, ranked 11th, threatens to
crack the top ten by the end of the season.
Arizona's only non-conference loss

came against Syracuse, another tourna
ment lock. Only a slow start against Cal
and Stanford to start conference play has
kept the Wildcats from challenging
UCLA for the Pac-10 crown.
But, as Mike Montgomery likes to say,
"It's who you play and where and when
you play them." Washington is suffering
through that plague right now — a 6-3
first half of the conference season has
been followed up by a 1-4 showing the
second time around.
With the Arizona schools heading up
to the Evergreen State this weekend, that
trend should continue. As for Washing
ton State, they simply lost too much
ground during Mark Hendrickson's ab
sence. Unless the Cougars win their last
four (unlikely, as the Arizona weekend is
followed up by a trip to Los Angeles), it
looks like NIT for WSU.
(Side note: if you ever need to find your
way from Seattle to Pullman, follow
these directions — go east 'til you smell
it, then south 'til you step in it.)
Oregon's in the same position as the
two Washington schools but simply has
too many losses (12) to make the tourna
ment. But woe to the foe that comes to
Mac Court if the Ducks luck into hosting
an NIT game.
So that leaves Cal and Stanford, tied
for third at 10-5 in the Pac-10. Last year,
10 conference wins were good enough to
make the tournament. With the clear
break between third and fifth place (two
and-a-half games), it looks like both
teams probably will make it, marking the
first time both schools have been in the
tournament the same year.
But that makes it sound too easy. If
this season has done anything, it has
proven that Stanford and Cal can play
wildly erratic basketball from one game
to the next.
The showdown in Harmon Sunday will
give one team the upper hand heading
into the final weekend. In fact, should
Arizona drop one game in Washington
this weekend, the winner of the Cal-Stan
ford game will wake up next Monday
morning tied for second.

An even more interesting scenario
would have the Wildcats drop to third in
the conference (with a loss this weekend
and a loss to either Cal or Stanford) but
retain the highest national ranking in the
conference.
Right now, the upper hand has to go to
No. 25 Stanford. As long as the Cardinal
stays in the top 25, there's no way it
would be shut out of the field of 64. Cal,
on the other hand, received only enough
votes in the latest poll for a ranking of 45
— even winning two of its next three
might not be enough to crack the polls.
One problem both teams face is how
they stack up using the Rating Percent
age Index, or RPI. A statistical tool of the
NCAA that considers winning percentage
against Division I schools, schedule
strength and opponents' schedule
strength, the RPI is key to the selection
committee's determination of the 34 at
large bids.
While the actual RPI is not public, an
independent duplication using the same
criteria puts Stanford 36th and Cal 49th.
Not good numbers, but those should go
up because both teams face quality oppo
nents over the next two weeks (each
other and then Arizona). The Wildcats
come in at 11th on the RPI while the Bru
ins fit in at 15th.
Stanford also has wins over UCLA,
Arizona, Cal and South Carolina under
its belt while the Golden Bears can only
boast of wins over Arizona and Minneso
ta. But Todd Bozeman's team still gets
recognition from three years ago, when
they knocked off LSU and defending
champion Duke en route to a Sweet 16
berth.

So how come people don't remember
the next year, when the Golden Bears
pulled an "Arizona" by losing to Wiscon
sin-Green Bay in the first round? People
have the opposite reaction regarding the
Wildcats — first round failures fester but
Final Fours fade.
Returning to 1996, Stanford also has
maturity on its side (and I don't just
mean those guys sitting on the bench
wearing suits). A year ago, Cal's go-to
players, Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Ed
Gray, were playing in high school and ju
nior college, respectively, while Stan
ford's starters were finding out what it
takes to play in the NCAA tournament
with a win over UNC-Charlotte and a les
son at the hands of Marcus Camby and
Massachusetts. With a starting lineup of
four seniors and a junior, the Cardinal
gains the big edge.
(Speaking of the rewards of maturity,
if Andy Poppink doesn't make the All-
Pac-10 team, I'll eat my shoe. Or make
the voters eat theirs.)
UCLA and Arizona seem destined for
No. 3 seeds in regional action. Whoever
comes out on top of the Cal-Stanford
horse race will probably grab an eight
seed. That win, followed by a win over
Arizona, could push Cal or Stanford up to
a six-seed. The loser, unless it becomes so
despondent from that loss that it flushes
the Arizona trip down the toilet, will
probably sneak into the tournament
seeded anywhere from 10th to 12th (as
the last four seedings in each region tend
to go to smaller schools who earned auto
matic berths).
Don't look now, but March is only two
days away. Let the Madness begin.
