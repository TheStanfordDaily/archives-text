over Washington on Sunday
to help Stanford secure the
conference title outright.
Wideman hit 10 of 17 shots
from the floor and played all
40 minutes of the contest. The
5-foot-6 floor general also
buried three treys, including a
straight-away 24-foot prayer
just as the shot clock expired,
breaking a 52-52 deadlock and
taking the wind out of the
Husky sails. Wideman also
dished out five assists in the

Washington State last Thurs
day.
This marks the the first
time Wideman has captured
Player of the Week honors.
