# Place-kicker Abrams linked to alleged sexual misconduct
## Arrest may lead to charges for soliciting semi-nude photos of youths 
### Todd Bernstein, Brian Singer Carolyn Sleeth Staff writers 
Eric Abrams, Stanford foot
ball's all-time leading scorer, is
currently under investigation by
Santa Clara police for allegedly
harassing high school football
players by soliciting semi-nude
photographs from them, sources
said.
The Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney is considering filing
criminal charges, but is unsure if
they will be for sexual harassment
or phone harassment, Santa Clara
Police Sgt. Mark Kerby said. Re
gardless of any future criminal
proceedings, the juvenile victim
plans to file civil charges, his
lawyer told The Daily. Abrams
may also face federal charges for
engaging in sexual misconduct

through the mail, Kerby said.
Abrams, 22, was arrested Jan.
26 in a sting operation at the Stan
ford Post Office, according to U.S.
Postal Inspector Frank Ducar. In
vestigators from the Stanford and
Santa Clara police departments
assisted the two inspectors.
Abrams declined to return re
peated phone calls from The Daily
to his residences in Palo Alto and
San Diego or respond to visits to
his Palo Alto house. Abrams'
lawyers also declined to comment.
Charges have yet to be filed be
cause Santa Clara police detec
tives are conducting a search to
find other victims believed to be
on the East Coast, Kerby said.
"We don't like to file a case and
add things onto it," Kerby said,
adding that he expects charges to
be filed within two weeks.
Abrams, Stanford's All-Pac-10
place-kicker, allegedly solicited

Abrams allegedly substituted
other Stanford football players'
names for his own when request
ing materials through the mail,
sources said.
The victim who originally in
formed Santa Clara authorities of
the misconduct is a football player
at Wilcox High School in Santa
Clara, said Wilcox head football
coach Eric Volta.
In December, Volta received a
call from a man identifying him
self as a Stanford "graduate assis
tant" coach who asked the Wilcox
Athletic Department for the
phone number of the victim, Volta
said.
"The victim's family called
back and asked, 'Do colleges nor
mally ask for pictures of athletes
without shirts on to determine
muscle structure and so on?' "


Eric Abrams
semi-nude photographs from at
least two minors in different parts
of the country and asked that they
be delivered to him, sources said.
Volta said.
After Santa Clara authorities
were informed of the request, they
began tapping the victim's phone
line, said Patrick R. McMahon, a
San Jose lawyer representing the
victim and his family. The juvenile
received more than 20 phone calls
from the suspect, he said.
"(My client] is traumatized by
what happened," McMahon told
The Daily in an interview last
night. He said, however, that his
client would continue to play foot
tall.
Santa Clara police contacted
postal authorities and subse
quently asked the family to send a
package to Abrams' post office
box, sources said. The package
was allegedly addressed to a name
Abrams gave, claiming that he
would be out of town, the sources
said.
The name which McMahon
said was used belongb to another
member of Stanford's football
team.
Kerby said the contents of the
package related to the case, but
would not elaborate further.
Police and postal inspectors ar
rived at the post office the morn
ing of Jan. 26 and told Post Office
Station Manager Jim Ruiz that
they would be "in and around the
building," Ruiz said.
Abrams allegedly received a no
tice in his post office box to pick up
a piece of registered mail from the
window inside the post office,
sources said. A man entered the
office between 3:30 p.m. and 5
p.m. and signed for the package,
Ruiz said.

"Two or three of [the police of
ficers] came up behind him and
walked him outside," Ruiz said.
"We said, 'Whoa, they must have
got whoever they were looking
for.' "
The actual arrest, he said, oc
curred in a matter of seconds and
went unnoticed by some cus
tomers. Ruiz said he and two
postal workers at the counter wit-

nessed the arrest. Other postal
workers declined to comment.
After being led outside, the sus
pect was taken to the Santa Clara
police station and released, Kerby
said.
Although they already knew
their suspect, Kerby said police of
ficials verified his role in the mis
conduct with the sting operation.
"The individual had already
been identified," Kerby said. "The
act of picking up the mail served to
put a face with a name."
Since the package was sent,
however, the victim has been left
out of the loop, according to McMa
hon. Since the arrest, police in

formed the victim's father that the
suspect is "some type of athlete
who came from San Diego and a re
spectable family," McMahon said.
Abrams' father and mother,
who reside in San Diego, are a doc
tor and an attorney. They could
not be reached for comment over
the last several days. Abrams'
brother, Adam, who is a place
kicker at the University of South
ern California, was contacted in
Los Angeles last night, but refused
to comment.
McMahon, who has not been in
contact with Abrams' family or his
lawyers, said his client plans to
seek unspecified damages due to
"invasion of privacy."
"Obviously I think that the
(victim's) family strongly has a
right to know," McMahon said. "It
is my client whose privacy was in
vaded. It's hard to really under
stand why [the family has] been
kept in the dark. It really raises se
rious questions in my mind what's
going on."
McMahon added that the vic
tim's family would also consider
an out-of-court settlement in the
civil suit.
The University is currently
taking action pursuant to the
Fundamental Standard, which
governs student conduct at Stan
ford.
The Athletics Department is
waiting for the University's
processes to run their course be
fore taking further action. "We
are concerned about reports we
have heard regarding a student
athlete and have referred them to
the University's Judicial Affairs
Office," Athletic Director Ted Le
land said in a statement to The
Daily yesterday. Due to University
confidentiality rules, Leland said
he could not elaborate on the spe

cific case.
"We have always had a philoso
phy within Stanford Athletics that
we support the University's process
in stuff like this," Leland said in an
interview. "Unlike some other
schools whose athletics depart
ments try to run their own investi
gations, our tradition and feeling
here is that we ought to hand it over
to the University and that's what
we've done in this case."
Media relations officials at the
Athletics Department said they
expect head football coach Tyrone
Willingham to act quickly and
fairly on the issue.
"[Willingham's] style is to deal
with issues immediately as they
occur and to communicate what's
necessary and move on," said
Gary Migdol, senior media rela
tions director. "He has very strong
principles and high standards and
he would communicate them ac
cordingly."
Abrams, although enrolled this
quarter, has spent most of the
time since the arrest at his San
Diego home and at training work
outs for professional football
teams.
Abrams came to Stanford from
San Diego in 1992 as the top place
kicker in the nation. This year he
became Stanford's all-time lead
ing scorer with 289 points.
In high school, Abrams was in
volved with the Make-A-Wish
Foundation and received a Na
tional Award for Effort for his con
tributions. During his years at La
Jolla Country Day School, Abrams
collected donations for each of his
successful extra-point attempts —
raising more than $21,000 for the
charity.
A senior majoring in psycholo
gy, Abrams was named First-team
Academic All-Pac-10 in 1994.

"We have always had a philoso

we support the University's process
in stuff like this," Leland said in an
interview. "Unlike some other
schools whose athletics depart

here is that we ought to hand it over
to the University and that's what
we've done in this case."
Media relations officials at the
Athletics Department said they
expect head football coach Tyrone
Willingham to act quickly and
fairly on the issue.
"[Willingham's] style is to deal

Gary Migdol, senior media rela

principles and high standards and
he would communicate them ac
cordingly."
Abrams, although enrolled this
quarter, has spent most of the
time since the arrest at his San
Diego home and at training work
outs for professional football
teams.
Abrams came to Stanford from
San Diego in 1992 as the top place
kicker in the nation. This year he
became Stanford's all-time lead
ing scorer with 289 points.
In high school, Abrams was in
volved with the Make-A-Wish
Foundation and received a Na
tional Award for Effort for his con
tributions. During his years at La
Jolla Country Day School, Abrams
collected donations for each of his
successful extra-point attempts —
raising more than $21,000 for the
charity.
A senior majoring in psycholo
gy, Abrams was named First-team
Academic All-Pac-10 in 1994.
Eric Abrams, Stanford foot
ball's all-time leading scorer, is
currently under investigation by
Santa Clara police for allegedly
harassing high school football
players by soliciting semi-nude
photographs from them, sources
said.
The Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney is considering filing
criminal charges, but is unsure if
they will be for sexual harassment
or phone harassment, Santa Clara
Police Sgt. Mark Kerby said. Re
gardless of any future criminal
proceedings, the juvenile victim
plans to file civil charges, his
lawyer told The Daily. Abrams
may also face federal charges for
engaging in sexual misconduct

through the mail, Kerby said.
Abrams, 22, was arrested Jan.
26 in a sting operation at the Stan
ford Post Office, according to U.S.
Postal Inspector Frank Ducar. In
vestigators from the Stanford and
Santa Clara police departments
assisted the two inspectors.
Abrams declined to return re
peated phone calls from The Daily
to his residences in Palo Alto and
San Diego or respond to visits to
his Palo Alto house. Abrams'
lawyers also declined to comment.
Charges have yet to be filed be
cause Santa Clara police detec
tives are conducting a search to
find other victims believed to be
on the East Coast, Kerby said.
"We don't like to file a case and
add things onto it," Kerby said,
adding that he expects charges to
be filed within two weeks.
Abrams, Stanford's All-Pac-10
place-kicker, allegedly solicited

Abrams allegedly substituted
other Stanford football players'
names for his own when request
ing materials through the mail,
sources said.
The victim who originally in
formed Santa Clara authorities of
the misconduct is a football player
at Wilcox High School in Santa
Clara, said Wilcox head football
coach Eric Volta.
In December, Volta received a
call from a man identifying him
self as a Stanford "graduate assis
tant" coach who asked the Wilcox
Athletic Department for the
phone number of the victim, Volta
said.
"The victim's family called
back and asked, 'Do colleges nor
mally ask for pictures of athletes
without shirts on to determine
muscle structure and so on?' "


Eric Abrams
semi-nude photographs from at
least two minors in different parts
of the country and asked that they
be delivered to him, sources said.
Volta said.
After Santa Clara authorities
were informed of the request, they
began tapping the victim's phone
line, said Patrick R. McMahon, a
San Jose lawyer representing the
victim and his family. The juvenile
received more than 20 phone calls
from the suspect, he said.
"(My client] is traumatized by
what happened," McMahon told
The Daily in an interview last
night. He said, however, that his
client would continue to play foot
tall.
Santa Clara police contacted
postal authorities and subse
quently asked the family to send a
package to Abrams' post office
box, sources said. The package
was allegedly addressed to a name
Abrams gave, claiming that he
would be out of town, the sources
said.
The name which McMahon
said was used belongb to another
member of Stanford's football
team.
Kerby said the contents of the
package related to the case, but
would not elaborate further.
Police and postal inspectors ar
rived at the post office the morn
ing of Jan. 26 and told Post Office
Station Manager Jim Ruiz that
they would be "in and around the
building," Ruiz said.
Abrams allegedly received a no
tice in his post office box to pick up
a piece of registered mail from the
window inside the post office,
sources said. A man entered the
office between 3:30 p.m. and 5
p.m. and signed for the package,
Ruiz said.

"Two or three of [the police of
ficers] came up behind him and
walked him outside," Ruiz said.
"We said, 'Whoa, they must have
got whoever they were looking
for.' "
The actual arrest, he said, oc
curred in a matter of seconds and
went unnoticed by some cus
tomers. Ruiz said he and two
postal workers at the counter wit-

nessed the arrest. Other postal
workers declined to comment.
After being led outside, the sus
pect was taken to the Santa Clara
police station and released, Kerby
said.
Although they already knew
their suspect, Kerby said police of
ficials verified his role in the mis
conduct with the sting operation.
"The individual had already
been identified," Kerby said. "The
act of picking up the mail served to
put a face with a name."
Since the package was sent,
however, the victim has been left
out of the loop, according to McMa
hon. Since the arrest, police in

formed the victim's father that the
suspect is "some type of athlete
who came from San Diego and a re
spectable family," McMahon said.
Abrams' father and mother,
who reside in San Diego, are a doc
tor and an attorney. They could
not be reached for comment over
the last several days. Abrams'
brother, Adam, who is a place
kicker at the University of South
ern California, was contacted in
Los Angeles last night, but refused
to comment.
McMahon, who has not been in
contact with Abrams' family or his
lawyers, said his client plans to
seek unspecified damages due to
"invasion of privacy."
"Obviously I think that the
(victim's) family strongly has a
right to know," McMahon said. "It
is my client whose privacy was in
vaded. It's hard to really under
stand why [the family has] been
kept in the dark. It really raises se
rious questions in my mind what's
going on."
McMahon added that the vic
tim's family would also consider
an out-of-court settlement in the
civil suit.
The University is currently
taking action pursuant to the
Fundamental Standard, which
governs student conduct at Stan
ford.
The Athletics Department is

processes to run their course be

have heard regarding a student
athlete and have referred them to
the University's Judicial Affairs
