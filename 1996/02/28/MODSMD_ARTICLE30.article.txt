# Women's lacrosse drops opener to UC-Davis, 6-5
## Cardinal begins first season in NCAA Division I 
### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
Goodbye, Western Women's Lacrosse
League. Hello, NCAA Division I.
That's right, folks, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team is going big time
this year. In just its second year as a varsi
ty sport, the Cardinal, which opened regu
lar-season play on Saturday with a 6-5 loss
at the hands of UC-Davis, has moved up
the ranks into NCAA Division I in an at
tempt to help strengthen the program and
allow the team to compete with some of the
more established lacrosse programs on the
East Coast.
"It's amazing for this program," said se
nior team captain Peppie Stephenson.
"This year our competition is going to be
much more challenging than in the past."
In the past, Stanford competed with
other lacrosse teams from the west in the
Western Women's Lacrosse League. But in
a sport that is only now beginning to gain
recognition outside of the Northeast, the
competition wasn't always there.
This year, Stanford becomes the first
varsity Division I women's team on the
West Coast. And while that should allow
the women to gain some valuable experi
ence, dreams of an NCAA championship
are still a few years premature. Schools
must play at least 10 Division I opponents
in order to even be eligible for the NCAA
tournament, and this year Stanford faces
just eight Division I foes.
On Saturday the Cardinal had enough
trouble against upstate rival UC-Davis, the
same team it has faced in the champi

onship game of the Western Women's
Lacrosse League the past three years. Last
season Stanford topped the Aggies 8-6 to
win the title for the first time in three
years, but the Cardinal couldn't provide a
repeat performance in its home opener last
weekend at Maloney Field.
Up 5-1 with less than 15 minutes to play
in the contest, the Cardinal suddenly went
into a tailspin. After calling a timeout,
Davis rattled off four consecutive goals,
two on free position shots, to forge a 5-5 tie
at the end of regulation.
"We controlled the ball most of the
game," Stephenson said, "we just couldn't
convert. We had the ball for the majority of
the game and we only scored five goals."
The Aggies' momentum carried into
overtime, where Davis scored on yet anoth
er free position shot to take a 6-5 lead.
After that, all Davis had to do was maintain
control of the ball and it was over.
"They were more fired up than we
were," Stephenson said. "We weren't
working together as a team."
Stanford opened competition 1 1/2
weeks ago at the Santa Barbara Shootout,
where the Cardinal managed a fourth
place finish while competing against some
of top teams on the West Coast as well as
club teams.
"We were just trying to get the transi
tion down," said sophomore Dara Kaplan.
"As the weekend went on, we got better."
This coming Saturday, the women will
have their first opportunity to see how they
match up against an NCAA opponent when
they face Vermont in a 1 p.m. contest at
Maloney Field.
