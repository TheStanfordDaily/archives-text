## Trouble? Groups protest EPA waste plant 
### Joe Westersund Contributing writer 
Two campus groups have joined
several other environmental and
community organizations in op
posing the expansion of the Romic
Environmental Technologies Cor
poration, a controversial haz
ardous waste recycling plant in
East Palo Alto.
The student groups, Youth
United for Community Action
(YUCA) and Greencorps, object to
Romic's plans to increase its cur
rent 500,000-gallon capacity by 10
percent.
This expansion is part of a per
mit-renewal process that Romic is
currently undergoing with the Cal
ifornia Environmental Protection
Agency. The new permit, if grant
ed, would also allow Romic to ac
cept a wider array of chemicals.
Two recent incidents at Romic
have caused environmental groups
to question the corporation's safe
ty and environmental standards.
In February 1995, a Romic worker,
Rodrigo Cruz, suffered brain dam
age allegedly as a result of faulty
equipment, and last November
large amounts of ferrocyanides
found in East Palo Alto sewers
were traced back to Romic.
YUCA hopes to increase the in
volvement of youth in the cam
paign against Romic, said senior
Amisha Patel, a member of the
group. The group is especially tar
geting East Palo Alto youths.
Members recently took part in a
flier distribution campaign
throughout East Palo Alto. They
are also holding assemblies and
presentations at area high schools,
as well as recruiting for a March 9
workshop to train youths to be ef
fective activists in their communi
ties.
"The first thing is to stop the ex
pansion [of Romic] . .. but ulti
mately we would like to see it leave.
... In terms of worker safety and
community health, it'd be better if
Romic wasn't here," Patel said.
Patel stressed that students
need to be aware of the issues. "It's
crucial for Stanford students to get
informed, concerned and involved
because pollution and injustice
don't conform to city boundaries."
Activist groups are concerned
about worker safety at Romic, par
ticularly in light of the Cruz inci
dent. Cruz was cleaning hazardous
waste residue out of a railroad car
and apparently got too little air
flow through his respirator be
cause of a faulty hose fitting and an
air compressor that was set lower
than the required pressure, accord
ing to police reports.
Romic was cited with 13 viola
tions including improper respira
tor maintenance and improper air
pressure in Cruz's air supply.
Romic, however, claimed in a re
cent pamphlet that "the training,
equipment and response in this sit
uation were appropriate." The cor

poration appealed the citation and
also applied to have the fines from
the incident reduced.
In the November incident,
Romic discharged about 25 parts
per million (ppm) of ferrocyanide
into East Palo Alto sewers, accord
ing to the East Palo Alto Sanitary
District which discovered the ille
gal emission. Industries are nor
mally allowed 1 ppm total cyanide
discharge.
A study by the sanitary district
found that the incident didn't en
danger the sewage plant workers
or the nearby community because
the concentration of the ferro
cyanide was low and ferrocyanide is
less toxic than other cyanides.
Environmentalists also worry
that about 40 percent of the wastes
Romic processes are shipped to ce
ment kilns and used as alternative
fuel.
Greenpeace campaigner
Bradley Angel disagreed with
Romic's statement that this prac
tice is a better alternative to simply
burying the waste or incinerating it
elsewhere.
Burning the waste in kilns is
"bogus recycling" and is detrimen
tal to the environment, Angel said
at a recent press conference in East
Palo Alto.
Racial and economic injustice
also play a part in concerns about
the plant. Romic operates another
facility on an American Indian
reservation in Arizona and has
ties to a plant in a poor, predomi
nantly Hispanic part of East Los
Angeles.
"If these facilities are so safe,
why do we not find them in ...
communities where the heads of
Romic live?" Angel asked. Angel
charged the government with hav
ing "two standards of justice," one
for rich white communities and
one for poor, non-white ones.
Angel's claim may have some
truth to it. According to "Toxic
Waste and Race Revisited," a re
port authored by the Center for
Policy Alternatives, 53 out of 54
hazardous waste sites in California
are in minority communities.
A Romic newsletter answered
this charge by pointing out that the
East Palo Alto plant was built

when the town was predominantly
Caucasian and that the company's
Arizona site, contaminated before
Romic took it over, is now certified
clean.
Though many would rather not
have Romic in their backyard, the
company does benefit East Palo
Alto in several ways. Romic is the
largest company operating there,
with about 200 employees, and hir
ing preference is given to East Palo
Alto residents. Romic donated to
17 East Palo Alto non-profit
groups in the first half of 1996.
At this point, it's not clear ex
actly what the Romic plant's envi
ronmental impact on the area is.
Because California's 1970 Envi
ronmental Quality Act only re
quired assessment of the impact of
new projects and not previously ex
isting sites like Romic, no environ
mental impact report on the whole
operation has ever been done.
An impact report is now being
done at Romic's request and at the
company's expense, predicted to be
$200,000.
The debate over Romic has been
marred by misinformation from
both sides. A pamphlet put out by
the East Palo Alto's Ujima Securi
ty Council claims that Romic is on
the federal government's Super
fund National Priority list, which
is not true.
Another pamphlet compiled by
the Santa Clara Center for Occupa
tional Safety and Health claims
that Cruz's respirator was
"wrapped together with duct
tape." The respirator was not â€”
however, a fitting on the air hose
was wrapped with duct tape. A
Romic pamphlet claims this is
"consistent with manufacturer
recommendations" but leaves out
the fact that it voids government
approval for the use of the fitting.
Parties on both sides of the issue
recognize that someone needs to
take care of the hazardous waste
that modern society produces, but
how and where to take care of this
task is still under debate.
While Romic spokesperson
Rhonda Rigenhagen said, "We like
to think of ourselves as the good
guys," others see Romic more as a
problem in their community.
