## Former staff members discuss economic policy, leadership style 
### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
Three Reagan administration staff members pre
sented an insider's view of the eight-year presidency
in a panel discussion last night, covering topics rang
ing from Reagan's economic polity to his leadership
style.
The panel opened with comments from alumna
Denny Brisley, former assistant press secretary to
Reagan. Discussing her experiences in dealing with
the media, Brisley said, "It's not what they say about
you, but what they leave out. ... It gets a little ruth
less at times." But she added that the value of the
media far exceeds its drawbacks in a democracy.
Senior Hoover Institution Fellow John Cogan,
who was deputy director of the Office of Management
and Budget under Reagan, clarified the president's
economic policy. He said some labels attached to Rea
gan's policies such as "voodoo" were wrong.
According to Cogan, Reagan never believed that
an economy stimulated by tax cuts could generate
enough new revenues to make up for the cuts. Rea
gan also submitted many proposals to reduce entitle
ment spending, but Congress never passed them,
Cogan said.
Brisley said Republicans can also be blamed for
failing to pass the reductions. She added that spend
ing cuts were "preached back then," but only now is
Congress acting.
Discussing public perceptions about Reagan's
leadership, Cogan said, "He knew what he was
doing." The suggestions that others were actually
making the decisions in the White House "were sheer
fiction on the part of some Democrats," added Cogan.
