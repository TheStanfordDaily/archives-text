# Recalling Reagan
## Former staff members discuss economic policy, leadership style 
### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
Three Reagan administration staff members pre
sented an insider's view of the eight-year presidency
in a panel discussion last night, covering topics rang
ing from Reagan's economic polity to his leadership
style.
The panel opened with comments from alumna
Denny Brisley, former assistant press secretary to
Reagan. Discussing her experiences in dealing with
the media, Brisley said, "It's not what they say about
you, but what they leave out. ... It gets a little ruth
less at times." But she added that the value of the
media far exceeds its drawbacks in a democracy.
Senior Hoover Institution Fellow John Cogan,
who was deputy director of the Office of Management
and Budget under Reagan, clarified the president's
economic policy. He said some labels attached to Rea
gan's policies such as "voodoo" were wrong.
According to Cogan, Reagan never believed that
an economy stimulated by tax cuts could generate
enough new revenues to make up for the cuts. Rea
gan also submitted many proposals to reduce entitle
ment spending, but Congress never passed them,
Cogan said.
Brisley said Republicans can also be blamed for
failing to pass the reductions. She added that spend
ing cuts were "preached back then," but only now is
Congress acting.
Discussing public perceptions about Reagan's
leadership, Cogan said, "He knew what he was
doing." The suggestions that others were actually
making the decisions in the White House "were sheer
fiction on the part of some Democrats," added Cogan.
"His demeanor was one of his
greatest strengths. . . . He was
very good at [management style],"
said alumnus Charlie Schott, for
mer chief of staff for the Federal
Communications Commission
under Chairman Alfred Sikes.
Brisley also joked about Rea
gan's often youthful energy and
the trouble that the younger
staffers, including herself, some
times had keeping up with him.
In addition to discussing the
Reagan years, the panelists
shared their views about some

current political issues, including
term limits.
Cogan stressed the importance
of people spending time out of gov
ernment if they are to make policy.
"The length of time that a member
spends in Congress has not really
improved their performance," he
told the audience of 50.
Schott said he favored longer
term limits since the problems
"probably come with those who
have been there longer than 12
years."
Brisley added that with some
brains and luck, "you can get so
much accomplished in a short
amount of time."
The panel members also of
fered their own advice on ways for

students to get involved in poli
tics. Schott emphasized that since
it is an election year, there are
many opportunities for students
during the summer, including
working at conventions.
Although the "campaign route
is fascinating," Brisley also point
ed to internships in government,
media and non-profit policy-ori
ented organizations as ways to
gain experience.
The evening discussion was the
fifth in a public policy series spon
sored by the Stanford College Re
publicans. "It's good for people at
Stanford to get a fresh Republican
perspective," said ChungHymn
Lui, co-programming chair for the
organization.
