# Keeping on Track
## Coordinator Margaret Harris: a Cultured Idealist with Values 
### Kelly E. Young 
At one time Margaret Harris held your future in
her hands — your CIV future, that is.
As freshmen and transfer students are well
aware, Harris is the program coordinator for all
Cultures, Ideas and Values tracks. In addition to
placing students into different tracks, she is in
charge of CIV budgeting. She also prepares infor
mation for various publications like Approaching
Stanford and the Stanford Bulletin.
In addition, as the department administrator
for Great Works and Europe and the Americas,
Harris is in charge of office tasks such as ordering
desk copies, creating room schedules, paying bills
and photocopying.
Most students who encounter Harris early on
during their time at Stanford don't realize the ex
tent of her responsibilities; the students just want
to change CIV tracks. Many freshmen visit her dur
ing Orientation in an attempt to switch CIVs, usu
ally because of time conflicts.
Course change days at the beginning of fall
quarter tend to be long ones for Harris. Her very
first course change day five years ago was quite an
unpleasant experience, she said.
Her predecessor indicated that approximately
20 to 30 students would want to change CIV tracks.
Unbeknownst to Harris, the history track moved
its lecture from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., so 400 students

showed up at her door with sched
uling conflicts.
But not all days are as hectic as
her first ones here. "I really enjoy
course change days," said Harris.
Harris said she tries to explain
that it's not the end of the world if
students temporarily forego an
elective course in order to take
CFV.
"Students are desperate be
cause they feel they have to have
their four years planned out dur
ing Orientation," said Harris.
In spite of some of the conflicts,
Harris said she enjoys her work.
"I'm the only person on campus
that does this. I really like working
with the students. They're bright
and most of them are really, really
nice." She said she is amazed at
"the incredible focus that every
one seems to come in with."
Interacting with people has al
ways been an important part of
her life. When Harris was growing
up, she didn't envision being a
CIV coordinator. She wanted to
work in the television field. "And
before that it was a fairy
princess," she added with a smile.
In 1958, Harris graduated with
a bachelor's degree in communi
cation arts from Lindenwood, a
small women's college in Mis
souri. After graduation, she
worked in television and radio in
Missouri.
In the interim between Lin
denwood and Stanford, Harris
lived in Los Angeles and Illinois
and raised two boys.
She arrived at Stanford in
1979. "I came here and became a
Californian in seven-and-a-half
seconds," said Harris. At that
time, she was working at the
School of Medicine doing account
ing work.
CIV started in 1989, and Har
ris came aboard two years later in
1991. She said the positions of

CIV coordinator and department
administrator appealed to her in
part because of a class, called
"History of the World," which she
had taken her freshman year at
Lindenwood.
"I never particularly liked his
tory," she said, "but I loved this
window that opened through this
course into the rest of the world —
how all these things came to affect
me as a college freshman in Mis
souri."
Harris said she believes ClV's
goal is, similarly, to expose stu
dents to new ways of thinking. "It
allows light to be shed on reasons
we are what we are today," said
Harris. "There was a sense that
the old Western Culture program
was too Eurocentric."
When Harris isn't helping to
broaden students' horizons, she
can be found pursuing a variety of
her own hobbies. At her home in
Half Moon Bay, she is involved
with the local community theater.
She will be directing two one-act
plays this summer: "Perse
phone," which is based on the
Greek myth of Hades kidnapping
Persephone, and "Juvie," which
is a dark drama that unfolds one
night in a juvenile hall.
In addition to working with the
theater, Harris serves as a docent
at the Ario Nuevo Reserve, the
breeding ground for the northern
elephant seal. There, she serves as
a tour guide for the equal access
trail tour, a trail for people with
mobility problems. "I recommend
everyone go out and see this," she
said about the reserve.
Harris said these two commu
nity activities complement her ca
reer.
"Both of those volunteer expe
riences give me a really good back
ground for dealing with the stu
dent body. From a docent's point
of view, there is an element of
teaching and relaying informa
tion, and certainly the theater
company gives me an ability to re
ally interact with all different
kinds of people," said Harris.
