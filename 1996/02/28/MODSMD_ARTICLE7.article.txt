# Keeping on Track
## Coordinator Margaret Harris: a Cultured Idealist with Values 
### Kelly E. Young 
At one time Margaret Harris held your future in
her hands — your CIV future, that is.
As freshmen and transfer students are well
aware, Harris is the program coordinator for all
Cultures, Ideas and Values tracks. In addition to
placing students into different tracks, she is in
charge of CIV budgeting. She also prepares infor
mation for various publications like Approaching
Stanford and the Stanford Bulletin.
In addition, as the department administrator
for Great Works and Europe and the Americas,
Harris is in charge of office tasks such as ordering
desk copies, creating room schedules, paying bills
and photocopying.
Most students who encounter Harris early on
during their time at Stanford don't realize the ex
tent of her responsibilities; the students just want
to change CIV tracks. Many freshmen visit her dur
ing Orientation in an attempt to switch CIVs, usu
ally because of time conflicts.
Course change days at the beginning of fall
quarter tend to be long ones for Harris. Her very
first course change day five years ago was quite an
unpleasant experience, she said.
Her predecessor indicated that approximately
20 to 30 students would want to change CIV tracks.
Unbeknownst to Harris, the history track moved
its lecture from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., so 400 students
