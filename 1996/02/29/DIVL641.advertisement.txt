JP\c\ure this - flip on your laptop, zap your fax, or check out the hottest CD-ROM titles on your
multimedia center, and you're putting Micro Linear to work! From computers and advanced net
working, to televisions, stereo equipment, measuring equipment and telecom technology, virtually
all electronic media depends on analog devices for A/D conversion. And Micro Linear people are
The Artisans of Analog, creating a distinct niche in this generation's most exciting technology.
Jls a newly hired grad, you will experience a compelling, rewarding challenge from the start.
Guided by our dynamic mentoring program, you will be designing right away. Not a bad begin
ning for an emerging artist. The leading OEMs in the world depend on Micro Linear and our far
reaching family of analog devices for truly inspired solutions. Pursue your craft at Micro Linear.
And make an impact the world will notice!
J>ignal ©esign Engineers
Design positions will provide you with the opportunity to learn advanced analog Integrated Cir
cuit design while developing systems engineering skills. You will also have the opportunity to
work in Bipolar, CMOS and BiCMOS process technologies. You will design and develop analog
and mixed signal Integrated Circuits. This includes chip definition circuit design, simulation, lay
out supervision, debug, characterization and release to production. Design Engineers will handle
semi-standard and standard applications in data acquisition, data communications, LAN's, high
speed bus interfaces, telecommunications, storage products, motor control, power supplies or
switching regulators. An MSEE is required.
jPro duct Engineers
If you are a BSEE (or an MSEE) graduate with a preference for analog circuits, our Product
Engineering position may be of interest to you. Strong analog skills are necessary so that you
can evaluate and characterize new products and introduce these products to manufacturing.
Ysur duties will be to analyze, enhance and forecast Wafer Sort and Final Test yields; support
production to resolve product issues; introduce new products to manufacturing; take characteri
zation data on new products: and provide feedback to other departments.
'Test Development Engineers
Apply your interest in analog circuits to our Test Development Engineering position. Strong
analog skills are necessary so you can design automatic test equipment software and
hardware that will perform complex electrical screening of Integrated Circuits and insure this
testing correlates to laboratory benchmarks. A BS/MSEE is necessary.
