Who Can Join
a Credit Union
Credit unions are usually formed around a common bond, such as employment.
Their main purpose is to give members a place where they can save and
borrow safely. The Stanford Federal Credit Union was formed 36 years ago by
a core of nine dedicated employees of Stanford University. Originally operating
in a small room in Kncina Hall, the Credit Union now has four branch locations.
13 ATMS, and $150 million in assets.
Membership in the Stanford Federal Credit I nion is open to Stanford University
students, faculty, staff, and alumni, employees of companies located on Stanford
lands, members of the Palo Alto Chamlx'r of Commerce, and relatives ot current
members. We now serve 30,000 member-owners.
It's easv to join the credit union or switch accounts from your current bank.
Members must make a one-time deposit of $50 to join. Once a person joins
our credit union, he or she may remain a member for life, even il the qualifying
relationship ends. If you'd like more information about becoming a member,
