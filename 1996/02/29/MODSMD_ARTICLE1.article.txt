## Stanford considers telecom act's impact 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
As the fate of a new telecommunica
tions act is argued in court., Stanford schol
ars and officials also arc debating the ef-

fects the law could have
on the University.
There is one thing
that most everybody
agrees on, however: the
effects of the act may not
be good for students. Ac
cording to Carey Heck
man, co-director of the
Stanford Law and Tech
nology Center, the bill
could even result in the

elimination of student World Wide Web
pages.
"I would not be surprised if, because of
the available commercial means of putting
Web pages up, the University found it con
venient not to provide Web pages for stu
dents at all," said Heckman.

The Communications Decency Act,
which was signed into law on Feb. 8 by
President Clinton as part of the Telecom
munications Act of 19%, makes it illegal
for "any interactive computer service to
display in a manner available to a person
under 18 years of age, any comment, re*
quest, suggestion, proposal, image or
other communication that, in context, de
picts or describes, in terms patently offen
sive as measured by contemporary com
munity standards, sexual or excretory ac
tivities or organs."
A temporary injunction against a por
tion of the bill was recently granted by U.S.
District Judge Ronald Buckwalter.
Stanford's dilemma
Stanford will be affected by the inde
cency act primarily because a number of
students on campus are under 18, and
Stanford Web sites are easily accessible to
minors off campus.
