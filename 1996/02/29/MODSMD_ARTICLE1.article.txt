## Stanford considers telecom act's impact 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
As the fate of a new telecommunica
tions act is argued in court., Stanford schol
ars and officials also arc debating the ef-

fects the law could have
on the University.
There is one thing
that most everybody
agrees on, however: the
effects of the act may not
be good for students. Ac
cording to Carey Heck
man, co-director of the
Stanford Law and Tech
nology Center, the bill
could even result in the

elimination of student World Wide Web
pages.
"I would not be surprised if, because of
the available commercial means of putting
Web pages up, the University found it con
venient not to provide Web pages for stu
dents at all," said Heckman.

The Communications Decency Act,
which was signed into law on Feb. 8 by
President Clinton as part of the Telecom
munications Act of 19%, makes it illegal
for "any interactive computer service to
display in a manner available to a person
under 18 years of age, any comment, re*
quest, suggestion, proposal, image or
other communication that, in context, de
picts or describes, in terms patently offen
sive as measured by contemporary com
munity standards, sexual or excretory ac
tivities or organs."
A temporary injunction against a por
tion of the bill was recently granted by U.S.
District Judge Ronald Buckwalter.
Stanford's dilemma
Stanford will be affected by the inde
cency act primarily because a number of
students on campus are under 18, and
Stanford Web sites are easily accessible to
minors off campus.


Roster
Heckman said he would recom
mend that Stanford act with an
"abundance of caution" if he were
advising the University on how to
respond to the new regulations.
"It would be tough for the Uni
versity to contend that they did not
know about the accessibility," he
said.
Michael Roster, the University's
general counsel, said his office has
decided to take a wait-and-see ap
proach for now.
"I think it is still too early to see
what the real effects of this legisla
tion will be," he said, noting that his
office will be "watching other trade
groups and other institutions" to
see how they respond.
University Chief Information
Officer Glen Mueller agreed that
it's too soon to know the law's ef
fects. "This bill is receiving signifi
cant challenges by various groups
as a violation of First Amendment
rights. It is too soon to speculate on
possible outcomes for Stanford."
However, Chip Haven, a Stan
ford computer network specialist,
said the telecommunications act

concerns him, as there is no feasible
way to monitor potential illegal
transmissions.
"I do not think there is any way
to regulate it,"he said. "There is no
technology that I am aware of that
could filter the transfer of e-mail,
ftp files and Web sites. There would
be no way to keep up, and there is no
technology that allows us to exam
ine the contents. A bit-map (photo
graph) is just a bunch of zeroes and
ones."
This dilemma could lead to
some serious deliberation on the
part of the University, Heckman
said, and it could jeopardize the fu
ture of Stanford-supported Web
pages.
"I think there will be some head
scratching on how important this is
to the University," he said. "There
would be educational losses. The
question is if it is an educational
function worth the risk of being hit
by a lawsuit."
Haven did not comment on the
possible future of student Web
pages. However, he did say that
non-student Web pages should not
be in any danger.
"It seems very unlikely that any
limit would be placed on the person
al pages of the staff and faculty," he
said.

Student response
Students across the nation have
expressed concern about the effects
of the new law. Senior Raj Ragha
van, a resident computing coordina
tor on the Row, said many students
have placed blue ribbon icons on
their Web pages to show support for
the groups fighting the act.
Other students have turned
their Web pages black in protest of
the legislation.
"It would be unfortunate if the
school had to take away Web pages
for students just because of a bill
like this," said freshman Will Wis
ter, who put up his own Web page
this fall.
Constitutional questions
A temporary injunction was
granted last Thursday against a
portion of the bill prohibiting "inde
cent" Internet transmissions to
those under 18 years of age, citing
the "vagueness" of the law. The
American Civil Liberties Union,
one of the groups who filed the suit,
called the injunction "a partial vic
tory."
Several other suits have been
filed against the Internet portions
of the telecommunications act.
Most recently, a group of more than
20 companies, including the owners

of on-line services Prodigy and
America Online, as well as Mi
crosoft, filed suit. This lawsuit will
be consolidated with the ACLU ac
tion.
The lawsuits will now move to a
three-judge panel to decide the act's
constitutionality on March 21.
However, many believe that the
fate of the act will ultimately be de
cided by the Supreme Court.
"If I had to bet, I would bet on all
of the indecency portions being
overturned and found unconstitu
tional," Heckman said. "But there
are many ways that they could find
it constitutional. It is a tough call."
There are some serious dilem
mas that could come into play when
the constitutionality of the act is
questioned. According to Clay
Calvert, the instructor of the Com
munication Department's "Com
munication and the Law" class, one
such question involves the defini
tion of indecency used in the act.
"The section applies the same
standard of indecency that the FCC
currently applies for regulating in
decency in the broadcast media,
such as radio and television,"
Calvert said. "The question arises
whether or not the same standard
should be applied to different
media, given that the Supreme

Court has seemed to develop a
medium-specific First Amendment
jurisprudence."
In addition to the definitional
questions, vagueness concerns may
play a major role in the act's future,
as they already have in the granting
of the temporary injunction.
"In reality, we could be talking
about Planned Parenthood," Heck
man said. "Some of that stuff ends
up being viewed as indecent under
certain community standards."
Legislative concerns
Heckman said that many legisla
tors may have voted for the bill be
cause it is an election year, even
though they believed that the Inter
net portions of the bill would be ul
timately found unconstitutional.
All of the Stanford area repre
sentatives voted for the telecommu
nications bill. The media office of
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
told The Daily that she supports the
Internet portions because she feels
it is necessary to protect children.
Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., previ
ously told The Daily that she voted
for the bill although she did not sup
port the Internet indecency clause.
The media office of Sen. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif, did not return re
peated phone calls.

The fact that many congression
al representatives and senators,
such as Feinstein, supported the In
ternet indecency clauses because
they felt the need to protect the
young could lead to a number of
questions, Calvert said.
"Ultimately, the issue becomes
whether we want to enforce what
some would call a children's First
Amendment, in which only materi
al suitable for minors is permitted,"
Calvert said.
Heckman agreed, saying that
many want the government to take
a larger role in protecting children
from indecent materials.
"There is a pattern out there
that some parts of society are able to
see the state in a parental role,"
Heckman said. "Many parents are
seemingly unwilling to play a
parental role, and somebody needs
to fill the vacuum."
Unfortunately, such protection
would ultimately hurt the mission
of large universities and institutes
of learning such as Stanford, Haven
said.
"The universities are all about
the free exchange of information,
not the limitation of it,"he said.
"Why don't we just burn books
in front of the library?" he asked.
"It's the same thing."
As the fate of a new telecommunica
tions act is argued in court., Stanford schol
ars and officials also arc debating the ef-

fects the law could have
on the University.

net portions of the bill would be ul
timately found unconstitutional.
All of the Stanford area repre
sentatives voted for the telecommu
nications bill. The media office of
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
told The Daily that she supports the
Internet portions because she feels
it is necessary to protect children.
Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., previ
ously told The Daily that she voted
for the bill although she did not sup
port the Internet indecency clause.
The media office of Sen. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif, did not return re
peated phone calls.

The fact that many congression
al representatives and senators,
such as Feinstein, supported the In
ternet indecency clauses because
they felt the need to protect the
young could lead to a number of
questions, Calvert said.
"Ultimately, the issue becomes
whether we want to enforce what
some would call a children's First
Amendment, in which only materi
al suitable for minors is permitted,"
Calvert said.
Heckman agreed, saying that
many want the government to take
a larger role in protecting children
from indecent materials.
"There is a pattern out there
that some parts of society are able to
see the state in a parental role,"
Heckman said. "Many parents are
seemingly unwilling to play a
parental role, and somebody needs
to fill the vacuum."
Unfortunately, such protection
would ultimately hurt the mission
of large universities and institutes
of learning such as Stanford, Haven
said.
"The universities are all about
the free exchange of information,
not the limitation of it,"he said.
"Why don't we just burn books
in front of the library?" he asked.
"It's the same thing."
As the fate of a new telecommunica
tions act is argued in court., Stanford schol
ars and officials also arc debating the ef-

fects the law could have
on the University.
There is one thing
that most everybody
agrees on, however: the
effects of the act may not
be good for students. Ac
cording to Carey Heck
man, co-director of the
Stanford Law and Tech
nology Center, the bill
could even result in the

elimination of student World Wide Web
pages.
"I would not be surprised if, because of
the available commercial means of putting
Web pages up, the University found it con
venient not to provide Web pages for stu
dents at all," said Heckman.

The Communications Decency Act,
which was signed into law on Feb. 8 by
President Clinton as part of the Telecom
munications Act of 19%, makes it illegal
for "any interactive computer service to
display in a manner available to a person
under 18 years of age, any comment, re*
quest, suggestion, proposal, image or
other communication that, in context, de
picts or describes, in terms patently offen
sive as measured by contemporary com
munity standards, sexual or excretory ac
tivities or organs."
A temporary injunction against a por
tion of the bill was recently granted by U.S.
District Judge Ronald Buckwalter.
Stanford's dilemma
Stanford will be affected by the inde
cency act primarily because a number of
students on campus are under 18, and
Stanford Web sites are easily accessible to
minors off campus.


Roster
Heckman said he would recom
mend that Stanford act with an
"abundance of caution" if he were
advising the University on how to
respond to the new regulations.
"It would be tough for the Uni
versity to contend that they did not
know about the accessibility," he
said.
Michael Roster, the University's
general counsel, said his office has
decided to take a wait-and-see ap
proach for now.
"I think it is still too early to see
what the real effects of this legisla
tion will be," he said, noting that his
office will be "watching other trade
groups and other institutions" to
see how they respond.
University Chief Information
Officer Glen Mueller agreed that
it's too soon to know the law's ef
fects. "This bill is receiving signifi
cant challenges by various groups
as a violation of First Amendment
rights. It is too soon to speculate on
possible outcomes for Stanford."
However, Chip Haven, a Stan
ford computer network specialist,
said the telecommunications act

concerns him, as there is no feasible
way to monitor potential illegal
transmissions.
"I do not think there is any way
to regulate it,"he said. "There is no
technology that I am aware of that
could filter the transfer of e-mail,
ftp files and Web sites. There would
be no way to keep up, and there is no
technology that allows us to exam
ine the contents. A bit-map (photo
graph) is just a bunch of zeroes and
ones."
This dilemma could lead to
some serious deliberation on the
part of the University, Heckman
said, and it could jeopardize the fu
ture of Stanford-supported Web
pages.
"I think there will be some head
scratching on how important this is
to the University," he said. "There
would be educational losses. The
question is if it is an educational
function worth the risk of being hit
by a lawsuit."
Haven did not comment on the
possible future of student Web
pages. However, he did say that
non-student Web pages should not
be in any danger.
"It seems very unlikely that any
limit would be placed on the person
al pages of the staff and faculty," he
said.

Student response
Students across the nation have
expressed concern about the effects
of the new law. Senior Raj Ragha
van, a resident computing coordina
tor on the Row, said many students
have placed blue ribbon icons on
their Web pages to show support for
the groups fighting the act.
Other students have turned
their Web pages black in protest of
the legislation.
"It would be unfortunate if the
school had to take away Web pages
for students just because of a bill
like this," said freshman Will Wis
ter, who put up his own Web page
this fall.
Constitutional questions
A temporary injunction was
granted last Thursday against a
portion of the bill prohibiting "inde
cent" Internet transmissions to
those under 18 years of age, citing
the "vagueness" of the law. The
American Civil Liberties Union,
one of the groups who filed the suit,
called the injunction "a partial vic
tory."
Several other suits have been
filed against the Internet portions
of the telecommunications act.
Most recently, a group of more than
20 companies, including the owners

of on-line services Prodigy and
America Online, as well as Mi
crosoft, filed suit. This lawsuit will
be consolidated with the ACLU ac
tion.
The lawsuits will now move to a
three-judge panel to decide the act's
constitutionality on March 21.
However, many believe that the
fate of the act will ultimately be de
cided by the Supreme Court.
"If I had to bet, I would bet on all
of the indecency portions being
overturned and found unconstitu
tional," Heckman said. "But there
are many ways that they could find
it constitutional. It is a tough call."
There are some serious dilem
mas that could come into play when
the constitutionality of the act is
questioned. According to Clay
Calvert, the instructor of the Com
munication Department's "Com
munication and the Law" class, one
such question involves the defini
tion of indecency used in the act.
"The section applies the same
standard of indecency that the FCC
currently applies for regulating in
decency in the broadcast media,
such as radio and television,"
Calvert said. "The question arises
whether or not the same standard
should be applied to different
media, given that the Supreme

Court has seemed to develop a
medium-specific First Amendment
jurisprudence."
In addition to the definitional
questions, vagueness concerns may
play a major role in the act's future,
as they already have in the granting
of the temporary injunction.
"In reality, we could be talking
about Planned Parenthood," Heck
man said. "Some of that stuff ends
up being viewed as indecent under
certain community standards."
Legislative concerns
Heckman said that many legisla
tors may have voted for the bill be
cause it is an election year, even
though they believed that the Inter
net portions of the bill would be ul
timately found unconstitutional.
All of the Stanford area repre
sentatives voted for the telecommu
