## Divorce for Di Stormy marriage ends 
### 
LONDON (AP) — Princess Diana has agreed
to a divorce from Prince Charles, ending a
stormy marriage that began with a glittering cer
emony in 1981 and collapsed 11 years later after
both sought solace in affairs.
The decision to divorce means that Diana will
never become Queen of England.
No financial settlement for Diana was
announced, and there was no word about
whether she had won the role she wanted as an
informal goodwill ambassador for Britain.
Diana's statement apparently caught Buck
ingham Palace by surprise. There also were
sharp differences between the two sides over
whether Diana would retain her title of Princess
of Wales.
Diana's spokeswoman said she would retain
the title, but Buckingham Palace insisted that no
titles had yet been discussed.
The couple, who separated in 1992, have two
sons: Prince William, 13, and Prince Harry, 11.
William is second in line to the British throne,
after Charles.
Yesterday's announcement was the culmina
tion of years of reports on Charles' and Diana's
troubled union, ranging from TV interviews that
captivated the nation to tabloid speculation over
whom they might marry next.
The public airing of dirty laundry created a
spectacle that led some to question whether
Britain's royal family was still an asset to the
country. Queen Elizabeth II herself was visibly
pained by the constant stream of public recrimi
nations and revelations about her son's tortured
marriage.
