# U.S. trade deficit climbing
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
United States suffered a $111.04
billion trade deficit last year, the
worst in seven years. The deficit
with Mexico was a record, a showing
certain to energize foes of the
administration's free-trade policies.
The Commerce Department's
final tally on trade for 1995 showed
the deficit with China also climbed
to a record. But the imbalance with
Japan, while still the largest for any
country, shrank for the first time in
four years.
The deficit in goods and services
represented an increase of 4.5 per
cent from a 1994 gap of $106.21 bil
lion. In goods alone, the imbalance
was even worse, surging to an all
time high of $174.47 billion.
The administration, which has
made trade the centerpiece of its
foreign policy strategy, sought to
play down the rising deficit and
focus instead on the advantages the
U.S. economy was receiving from
rising exports.
Laura Tyson, head of the presi
dent's National Economic Council,
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey
Kan tor and Commerce Secretary
Ron Brown all held briefings to
showcase the fact that for the first
time in years, the growth rate in
exports exceeded the percentage
increase in imports.
Exports of goods and services

were up 11.7 percent in 1995 to
$783.66 billion while imports rose
10.8 percent to $894.70 billion. The
trade deficit is the difference
between imports and exports.
Tyson said that strong export
gains were recorded for a wide
range of American goods from poul
try and wheat in the farm sector to
computer chips and other advanced
technology products.
Kantor said the gain in merchan
dise exports was the biggest in dol
lar terms in U.S. history and proved
the success of Clinton's "tough
trade policy that stands up for
American workers and farmers."
But GOP presidential candidate
Pat Buchanan, the administration's
toughest trade critic, said the new
government report highlighted the
total failure of Clinton's policies.
Campaigning at a South Caroli
na textile factory forced to close
because of import competition,
Buchanan said the increase in the
trade deficit meant "we just lost 2.2
million jobs last year."
Buchanan has pledged that as
president he would boost tariffs on
Chinese and Japanese products as
punishment for their closed mar
kets, pull the United States out of
the new World Trade Organization
and withdraw from the North
American Free Trade Agreement
with Mexico.

Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole, also campaigning in South
Carolina, scheduled a stop at an
auto plant built by the German car
maker BMW to underscore the ben
efits of free trade and highlight his
differences with Buchanan.
At the White House, presidential
spokesman Mike McCurry said
pulling "up the drawbridges" with
protectionist trade policies would
put at risk 11 million American
export jobs.
For December, the deficit in
goods and services totaled $6.78 bil
lion, up only slightly from Novem
ber's deficit of $6.71 billion. Since
peaking in June, the monthly deficit
has been improving and Tyson said
this offered hope that the overall
deficit, which has risen for four
straight years, may finally narrow
in 1996. She blamed much of last
year's deficit increase on a slow
down In key U.S. export markets,
particularly Mexico.
The trade balance with Mexico,
which had shown a small surplus of
$1.35 billion in 1994, soared to a
record deficit of $15.4 billion last
year as imports from Mexico
jumped 24.7 percent while U.S.
exports to Mexico fell by 8.9 percent.
This sharp reversal resulted from
Mexico's severe economic troubles
following the forced devaluation of
the peso.
