## A 						valuable resource 
### 
The University should put
more effort into publicizing
the ombudsperson's role

Recently, the university
announced plans to enlarge
the role of the ombudsper
son, expanding the position's
responsibilities and making the job
full-time.
This is a welcome change, as the
ombudsperson's office plays a valu
able role at Stanford and its
resources are widely used — 425
students, staff and faculty have had
some interaction with the office this
year alone. On another positive
note, the impetus behind this
change, one which will mold the
objectives and workings of an
important resource to meet com
munity needs, came right from the
top of the chain of command — Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper.
According to the Stanford Bul
letin, the original charge of the
ombudsperson is " 'to protect the
interests and rights of members of
the Stanford community from
injustices or abuses . . . from gross
inefficiency, from unnecessary delay
and complication in the administra
tion of University rules and regula
tions, and from inconsistency,
unfairness, unresponsiveness and
prejudice in the individual's experi
ence with University activities . . .
to receive, examine and channel the
complaints . . . and to secure expedi
tious and impartial redress/ "
While the position does not pos
sess decision-making authority, the
ombudsperson can refer someone to
the proper channels and participate
in any subsequent negotiations on
issues involving students, faculty or
staff and the University. Communi
ty members have approached the
office with confidential matters
ranging from complaints regarding
grades to discrimination and sexual
harassment.
The current ombudsperson,

Leah Kaplan, describes her role as
one of "advocating for due process,"
ensuring that those who approach
her are treated properly and under
stand all their options and potential
recourses. Furthermore, in cases
where wrongdoing is clear, the
ombudsperson can and has been an
active advocate for student, faculty
and staff interests.
Clearly, having a resource such as
a competent ombudsperson —
someone the members of the Stan
ford community can consult when
they are in trouble or have a con
cern and don't know who to turn to
— can be a critical asset.
Unfortunately, it is distressing
that community awareness of the
office's resources may not be at the
level it should or could be. Even the
current ombudsperson acknowl
edges that most people do not know
what the office does, or even the fact
that it exists. Furthermore, while
statements explaining the role of
the ombudsperson's office exist in
such places as the Stanford Bulletin
and orientation guides, word of
mouth seems to be the dominant
mode of publicizing the office.
In years past, publicity received
greater attention — at one time, the
officc had student assistants go out
to dorms to spread information
about what the ombudsperson does
and how to contact the office. In
redefining the role of the
ombudsperson, the University
should also set concrete guidelines
for expanding awareness of the
office. The guidelines do not have to
be too demanding — a few flier dis
tributions throughout campus
dorms and departments a few times
a year would be an excellent way to
reach students and staff.
It would be unfortunate if stu
dents, faculty and staff who could
have used the advice and efforts of
an unbiased, experienced advocate
did not know of the existence of the
ombudsperson. The University, by
enlarging the focus of the position
and putting more effort into widely
publicizing it, can ensure that the
entire Stanford community has
access to this valuable resource.
