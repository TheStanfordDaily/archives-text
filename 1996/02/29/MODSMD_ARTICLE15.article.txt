Student clarifies reasons for withdrawl from COP slate

I AM WRITING in reference to Mon
day's front page story regarding my
recent withdrawal from the People's
Platform COP slate.
The article stated that my decision to
withdraw was due, in part, to "sugges
tions that because [I am] white, fl]
would be under intense, perhaps uncom
fortable pressure from the University's
ethnic centers." I am concerned that
some people may have gotten the wrong
impression from this incomplete state
ment; therefore, I feel the need to tell
the whole story before Pat Buchanan
gives me the David Duke "Student of the
Year" award. I am not writing this letter
to attack anyone or place blame; I only
want to clear my own name which has
become inadvertently publicized and
misrepresented.
I am not anti-ethnic center. I am not
anti-diversity. My withdrawal was not
due to any fear that I would not be able
to work with the ethnic centers, nor do I
harbor ill feelings towards the ethnic
communities.
My decision was largely influenced by
the realization that my three years of
dedication to serving various aspects of

the Stanford community at large were
deemed by some as less significant than
my alleged lack of history directly serv
ing the ethnic centers or the People's
Platform. But, more important (and
what The Daily only partially reported),
was the information that because I am
not only white, but also a member of the
Greek community and a Jew, some con
cern existed among certain ethnic center
members, and that these personal char
acteristics could undermine my desir
ability as a candidate for the People's
Platform slate. I was also given the
impression that should our slate be
elected, my race, religion and organiza
tional affiliation would force me to walk
on eggshells and could be constant
obstacles to overcome in my efforts to
"prove myself' and assert leadership.
First, my sorority membership is a
personal choice that some people may
justifiably find inappropriate for them
selves. That is fine. I, however, am very
proud of my involvement and I greatly
respect the community as a whole. Sec
ond, the fact that I am white is not a
choice I made. It is not the sum of my
existence. It does not define me. Nor is it

something of which I am ashamed. I
hope that I am much more multifaceted
than the color of my skin. Finally, the
viewing of my religion and culture as a
liability is beyond my tolerance. I am
sure that anyone, regardless of one's
background, can understand my anger.
It was disappointing to learn that
some people, who themselves have been
the targets of stereotyping and discrimi
nation, were so ready to jump to conclu
sions about me (before even meeting me)
based on these three arbitrary criteria.
In certain parts of this country, preju
dice is due to ignorance. What is the
excuse at Stanford?
I hope that it is now clear to the Stan
ford community as to why I was unable
to continue my COP candidacy with the
People's Platform slate. My principles
are much more precious to me than polit
ical ambitions. Not only am I unwilling
to work in an environment where preju
dicial sentiments exist, I am unwilling to
invest my time and reputation in an enti
ty that is not eager to serve and repre
sent the entire Stanford community.
I am not asserting that the aforemen
tioned sentiments are representative of

the entire People's Platform, ethnic cen
ter community or even the proposed
COP slate. If this is not what they think
or how they want to be perceived, how
ever, they need to be careful in the
future as to who appoints themselves as
their spokespersons and in what manner
their messages are conveyed.
As The Daily article mentioned, there
were additional, unrelated issues also
contributing to my to withdrawal. Like
many Stanford students, I have yet to
understand what the COP actually
accomplishes. As a result, I prefer to
maintain my involvement with Stanford
in Government, the Haas Center and
various other mechanisms through
which I can continue to effectively serve
the Stanford community as a whole. I
challenge the People's Platform and all
others running for the ASSU to expand
their focus and aim to represent the
entire Stanford community, not just spe
cialized interests. I challenge the student
body, furthermore, to demand represen
tation, effectiveness and legitimacy from
their leaders.
