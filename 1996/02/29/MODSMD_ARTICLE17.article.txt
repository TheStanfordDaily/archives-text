## The 						plague of our times 
### 
I ONCE READ an affecting interview
with an American soldier serving in
Vietnam. The man, a foot soldier in
the jungle, spoke of his reaction to the
intense mortality surrounding him. With
a certain amount of hardened bravado,
the soldier explained the process of "roll
call." After each day of fighting, he and
his friends would tally the men killed in
their division that day, checking the list
against the predictions they had made
the night before. Then, they would lay
down their predictions for the next day,
noting which soldiers were becoming
despondent or scared and thus more like
ly to be weeded out in the fighting. The
next evening they would gather to "take
roll" again.
They weren't wagering and didn't
wish death on any soldier. But death
would come, regardless, and their morbid
game apparently helped reign in its reck
lessness and unpredictability. The sol
diers' seeming disregard for death unset
tled me, but his age pinned the tale to my
memory. He was 19.
A short time later, just after my 20th
birthday, I sat with a friend over dinner
and talked about AIDS. My friend, also
young and gay, had decided we should
steel ourselves for the inevitable losses in
our future, the friends that would die. If
we could hasten our emotional matura
tion and anticipate our losses, perhaps
they would be less devastating. Unwit

tingly, we began making a "roll call" of
our own: "I worry about X — he sleeps
around." "I worry about Y; he seems
lonely." "I've seen Z hanging out alone in
bars. That's a bad sign."
If solace was our goal, the conversa
tion failed. I still dread losing my first
friend. Reading the obituaries in San
Francisco's gay newspapers leaves me
cold — each week there are 10, maybe 12,
more men who've left behind families,
friends and lovers. I suppose there aren't
really proactive measures or rehearsals
for grieving.
Through my dissatisfaction I recog
nized the young soldier's predictions
were only half the ritual. Grieving for
those he had or had not expected to lose
and being thankful for those who, expect
ed or not, were still alive, was the more
important motive of his game.
Sometimes I look to the gay men 10 or
20 years my senior who have been "on
the front lines," who watched AIDS come
into their lives, kill and refuse to leave. I
think of the activists on the streets and in
the news. Their message to us is the same
as the young soldier's — remember.
Remember there is a plague going on.
Remember those who have died. Remem
ber me when I'm gone.
I've hoped that perhaps the horrible
reality of this plague mercifully sur
passed them at some point. Maybe
they've been so numbed to loss that it's

possible to do other things again. They
can drink, dance and live like this time
was any other because AIDS passed some
threshold of rationality. It has refused to
be poignant or instructional anymore —
it has become a fact of life.
And maybe someday the horrors of
this disease will grind us all to a stop
where we turn to each other and say,
"How did we get here?" and begin to
make the world right again.
No. It is a paradox we all live in and
will continue to live in. No crisis, no mat
ter how brutal, eclipses all else and makes
life neat and sensibly tragic. Author Allen
Barnett achingly captured this point at
the publication of his first — and last —
book. He remarked that AIDS both gave
him something to write about and took
away his strength to write about it.
Life just keeps going. We take our
lumps and stumble forward and all the
streams of our experience — joy, hope,
sorrow, fear — continue to flow, regard
less of circumstance. We cannot dam or
speed any of them, but some will be
diminished and, in the end, run dry as
tragedy plays its role, never übiquitous,
just subtle and real.

HIV remains the leading cause of deat
for Americans aged 25 to 44.
