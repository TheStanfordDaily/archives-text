# Josh Golhke: Laughing leads to crying
## What am I going to do when my RA's not around? 
### 
Alot of people ask me how I got where
I am today. Actually, no one has ever
asked me that. People usually ask
me questions like, "What do you put in
your hair to make it like that?" or "Do you
have a cigarette?" But if anyone ever did
ask me how I got this far, I would tell them
I owe it all to one man: my resident assis
tant, Andy.
I've lived in no less than two gigantic
dorms, so I know that anybody can become
an RA at Stanford, as long as they are not
especially competent or totally free of neu
roses. This general lack of quality standards
for residential staff has led to a dearth of
respect for those who hold the title of RA.
Here I must draw a distinction between
those who have attained the official label —
a bureaucratic achievement at best — and
those who are residential educators at the
very core of their beings, who were born
with souls stamped, "RA." Just such a man
is Andy.
Many of the people in my house initially
doubted Andy's ability as an RA. Perhaps

they thought he was too Caucasian and
Ohioan to be an agent of multiculturalism,
too much of a chemical engineer to under
stand social situations or too Christian to
know anything about alcohol, drugs or sex.
All of this turned out to be true, but it
doesn't change the fact that he was created
for the position, that he bears the responsi
bility for my health and happiness.
For example, the other night, one of the
more self-righteous members of the house
took my car keys from me because I had had
"too much to drink." I knew who to talk to.
"Andy," I said, "Jeff took my car keys
just because I'm drunk. I need to go to the
liquor store and he won't give them back to
me."
"Don't worry about it, Josh," Andy said.
"Mere are the keys to my car. Hey, you want
a beer for the road?"
Andy knows a lot about substance abuse,
much more than he could ever learn in RA
training. At the beginning of this year, he
noticed I was kind of getting into drugs, so
he called me up to Room 208 for a discus

sion.
"Josh, I've noticed you've been smoking
a lot of pot lately," Andy said with concern.
"Well, Andy, you know, a lot of the guys
do it, and I just feel like it helps me fit in and
be cool," I explained.
"Josh, smoking dope doesn't make you
'cool' at all," Andy said. "Marijuana is for
squares. It's not the '60s anymore. It's
1996, and heroin is where it's at."
Andy was right. I realized Lou Reed
could kick Bob Marley's ass any day.
Speaking of which, in a house as diverse
as mine, ethnic issues come up quite fre
quently, and Andy has taught me how to
deal with them. When, on one occasion, I
felt I was the victim of a hate-driven attack
by one of the Christian members of the
house, I went to my favorite RA.
"Andy, Mitch cut in front of me in line at
dinner," I said. "And then he said, 'You stay
where you are, you dumb Jew.' It made me
very upset."
"Josh, you can't get upset about these
things," Andy said. "This isn't Israel. In

America, Christians have traditionally been
considered better than Jews."
"It just doesn't seem fair."
"It is fair. You can always take your
anger out on Abdul, because he's a Muslim,
which in America is worse than a Jew."
That's what was great about Andy — he
really showed me how to look at problems
from a logical, objective perspective. Nor
was he limited to race issues; Andy also
taught me a lot about sax by using that
same matter-of-fact approach.
"Andy, I hats using condoms, but I'm
afraid of getting AIDS," I complained.
"Josh, you're being silly," Andy said.
"Know the facts. Heterosexuals can't get
AIDS."
"Wow," I said in genuine surprise. "Then
I guess I can stop using those nasty little
things."
I paused and then added: "Oh, shoot, I
forgot — I still have to use them for contra
ception."
Andy looked at me gravely and asked,
"Josh, are you a man? You're not going to

get pregnant, are you? Pregnancy is a girl's
responsibility. They're the ones going
around getting pregnant all the time."
Sometimes I wonder what will happen to
me afler I graduate, when I don't have Andy
to tell me what to do. And then I wonder
about all the other students at Stanford
who have been living under the second-rate
instruction of other RAs.
I asked Andy if he ever worried about
them or me, and he answered with his typi
cal honesty.
"Josh, a lot of people think I'm an RA
just because it's easy money for doing abso
lutely nothing," Andy said. "Those people
are exactly right. So, no, I'm not worried
about anyone or anything except getting to
the bank before it closes, so I can cash my
fat paycheck from Res Ed and go get laid."

Josh thanks Andy for being not only his RA,
but his friend.
