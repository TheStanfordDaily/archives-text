# Native Americans find merchandise offensive
## Bookstore removes garments from shelves 
### Sara Southern Staff writer 
The Stanford Bookstore removed mer
chandise featuring an image of a Native
American on Monday in response to com
plaints from Native American students and
American Indian Office Program Coordina
tor Denni Woodward.
"The design was a beautiful embroidery of
a full-faced Indian with two paddles and a
canoe," said Peggy Mendelson, president and
chief executive officer of the Bookstore. It
was printed on both sweaters and T-shirts,
and had "Stanford Heritage" printed across
the middle.
The merchandise went on the shelves last
Friday and was removed from the shelves on
Monday in response to the complaints.
Woodward said she was "horrified" upon
receiving news that the Bookstore was sell
ing apparel using a Native American as a dec
oration.
"The Indian logo was banned over 20
years ago," Woodward said. "It is surprising
to me that the management [of the Book
store] thought this would be all right. The In
dian depicted on the merchandise was just as
hurtful as the old caricature that was once
the mascot."
Mendelson said the image on the apparel
was meant to commemorate the Ohlone In
dians who lived on the land on which Stan
ford is built. She added that she thought it
was "something altogether different from
the old Stanford Indian mascot."
Woodward, however, said the design does
not reflect "Stanford Heritage," as is printed
on the apparel, nor could it have been meant
to honor the Ohlone Indians.
"I think the idea that the image of an In

dian head could refer to Stanford's heritage
is sketchy," Woodward said. "This campus is
simply too diverse to be categorized as having
a single heritage."
Woodward also expressed doubt that the
design could have been meant to commemo
rate the Ohlone.
"The notion that the image on the mer
chandise was supposed to honor the Ohlone
is pretty bogus," she said. "Actually, the
image depicted was clearly that of a Plains In
dian, complete with a full-feather bonnet,
canoe and oars, not that of the Ohlone. There
was nothing in the design that referred to the
Ohlone."
After she learned that the merchandise
was being sold, Woodward initially attempt
ed to contact Bookstore management by
phone but chose to e-mail Native American
students on campus when she could not get
through to anyone.
" I know students expressed concern to the
Bookstore after hearing about it," Wood
ward said. "One of our Native American
alumni, Francis Robert, also went in person
ally and complained. I was very pleased with
the promptness with which the Bookstore re
sponded after they knew of our concerns."
The Bookstore removed the merchandise
from shelves Monday, and Woodward spoke
with Laura Dowling, general merchandise
division manager of the Bookstore, on Tues
day. Dowling will send a formal letter of apol
ogy to the Stanford American Indian Organi
zation some time this week.
"I think their decision to order the mer
chandise was a mistake," Woodward said.
"But the Bookstore responded quickly, and
I'm pleased the merchandise is off the
shelves. The design perpetuated an image
hurtful to American Indians."
