## Wrestlers gear up for run at Pac-10s 
### Karim Fakhry Contributing writer 
As the Stanford wrestlers
make final preparations for the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships this Saturday and Sun
day at Cal State-Bakersfield,
there is a general feeling that the
team is peaking at just the right
time in the season.
"We're at our strongest right
now," said 17-year head coach
Chris Horpel. Horpel, like his
wrestlers, is optimistic about the
Cardinal's chances at success in
the tournament. "We have a full
starting line-up right now. Our
spirits are high. This is the
strongest the team has been all
year."
Horpel has good reason to be
optimistic. Senior star Tod Sur
mon is ranked first in the Pac-10
and third in the country in the
150-pound weight class, where
he has wrestled all year. At this
weekend's championships, he
will drop down to the 142-pound
weight group, where his ranking
should be close to the same. Sur

mon has been the most consis
tent performer on the squad this
year, as evidenced by his un
blemished 18-0 record.
Jimmy Aguirre offers another
reason to be confident. The se
nior team leader, wrestling in
the 134-pound weight class, has
finished first and fourth in the
Pac-10 tournament in past sea
sons. This year he will probably
receive the fourth seed. Like
many of his teammates, Aguirre
has the skills and the condition
ing needed to win — success is
only a matter of how healthy he
is at the tournament.
Senior Matt Cano, another
NCAA hopeful, has the ability
and the drive to capitalize on his
opportunities in the tourna
ment. He did last year, when he
placed fourth in the 126-pound
weight class at the Pac-lOs and
subsequently qualified for the
NCAA tournament.
Another strong performer, se
nior Sahlan Martin, has a good
shot at making the national
