## Wrestlers gear up for run at Pac-10s 
### Karim Fakhry Contributing writer 
As the Stanford wrestlers
make final preparations for the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships this Saturday and Sun
day at Cal State-Bakersfield,
there is a general feeling that the
team is peaking at just the right
time in the season.
"We're at our strongest right
now," said 17-year head coach
Chris Horpel. Horpel, like his
wrestlers, is optimistic about the
Cardinal's chances at success in
the tournament. "We have a full
starting line-up right now. Our
spirits are high. This is the
strongest the team has been all
year."
Horpel has good reason to be
optimistic. Senior star Tod Sur
mon is ranked first in the Pac-10
and third in the country in the
150-pound weight class, where
he has wrestled all year. At this
weekend's championships, he
will drop down to the 142-pound
weight group, where his ranking
should be close to the same. Sur

mon has been the most consis
tent performer on the squad this
year, as evidenced by his un
blemished 18-0 record.
Jimmy Aguirre offers another
reason to be confident. The se
nior team leader, wrestling in
the 134-pound weight class, has
finished first and fourth in the
Pac-10 tournament in past sea
sons. This year he will probably
receive the fourth seed. Like
many of his teammates, Aguirre
has the skills and the condition
ing needed to win — success is
only a matter of how healthy he
is at the tournament.
Senior Matt Cano, another
NCAA hopeful, has the ability
and the drive to capitalize on his
opportunities in the tourna
ment. He did last year, when he
placed fourth in the 126-pound
weight class at the Pac-lOs and
subsequently qualified for the
NCAA tournament.
Another strong performer, se
nior Sahlan Martin, has a good
shot at making the national

tournament. Martin says that he
will be satisfied with his perfor
mance at Pac-lOs as long as he
has fun. Horpel believes that

Martin could easily make the fi
nals of the Pac-10 champi
onships in the 158-pound weight
class. Last year, Martin placed
fourth at the conference tourney
and was the first alternate at the
NCAA tournament.
In Horpel's estimation, junior

Bryan Vaniman could also place
very well at the Pac-10 tourna
ment and earn a slot in the
NCAA tourney. The 190-pound
weight class in which Vaniman
competes is a highly competitive
class in which the field is very
concentrated. Vaniman will sim
ply have to have a good tourna
ment in order to qualify for
NCAAs.
Redshirt freshman B.J.
Sanchez will wrestle in the 150-
pound weight class, where he de
feated freshman Doug Bardsley
in a wrestle-off, ending Bards
ley's spectacular year. Sopho
more Scott Chapman will repre
sent Stanford in the 167-pound
weight class, while teammate
and classmate Jason Gladden
will fill the 177-pound slot.
Chapman and Gladden are in
very similar situations. Both
have had their respective sea
sons disrupted by injuries and
haven't wrestled for weeks. It's
hard to predict how they will fare
at the Pac-10 tournament, but
they may be able to perform at
the level at which they did at the
beginning of the season.
Sophomore Chris Serjak clos
es out the lineup for the Cardi
nal. He will wrestle in the heavy
weight slot, where the number
one spot is up for grabs. Serjak
defeated sophomore teammate
Mark Neglay for the right to
compete in the heavyweight po
sition.
Horpel believes the race for
the Pac-10 crown is between two
teams, Arizona State and host
school Cal State-Bakersfield. He
says that he'll be satisfied if the
Cardinal places fourth or fifth in
the tournament.
"I'm hoping for a top-five fin
ish, at least one champion and at
least four qualifiers," Horpel
said. If all goes well, Horpel and
several team members will be
preparing for the NCAA tourna
ment come Monday.
