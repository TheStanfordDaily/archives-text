# Fifth-ranked Cardinal in a hole
## Men's volleyball faces must-win situation tonight against Pacific 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
After a lost weekend in which
the Cardinal dropped three crit
ical Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation matches, the fifth
ranked Stanford men's volley
ball team looks to right itself
tonight at 7 p.m. in Burnham
Pavilion against the University
of the Pacific.
Now 6-4 in league play and
tied with the Tigers for third in
the Pacific division of the
MPSF, the Cardinal's postsea
son chances are suddenly nar
rowing. Because only the top
three teams from each division
qualify for the MPSF tourna
ment, a victory for Stanford is
critical.
"I certainly hope [the team]
understands the significance of
this match," said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves. "Really,
it's the biggest match of the sea
son."
UOP will be a different team
than the one Stanford faced in
its league opener on Jan. 31.
Since their quick three-game
loss to the Cardinal, the Tigers
have recovered and won five of
their last seven league matches
on their way to an 9-3 overall
start.
"Of all the teams in our divi
sion, they've had the most unex
pected success," Nieves said.
"Also, I'm sure UOP senses this
as a huge opportunity for it [to
enhance its post-season
chances]."
Pacific has been aided greatly
by the emergence of sophomore
Martin Berkencamp, a transfer
from Germany. The 6-foot-8
middle blocker is currently sec
ond on the team in kills with 161
in 38 games. Middle blocker
Greg Wakeham leads the team
in that category, averaging 7.39
per game, good for third in the
nation. He also looks to rebound
from a poor first meeting
against Stanford. Last month,
the 6-foot-7 Pacific junior
racked up 17 kills, but was ha
rassed into nine errors for a
meager .205 hitting percentage.

Veteran senior setter Russell
Gan steadies the offense, aver
aging over 14 assists per game.
The X-factor for Stanford has
become junior middle blocker
Brian Moore. With his big pres
ence in the middle, the Cardinal
started the season 7-1. But the
team is winless since Moore was
forced out of the UCLA match
last Friday with a foot injury.
"We probably won't know
[Moore's playing status] until
match time," Nieves said.
Should Moore sit out, the of
fensive load will continue to rest
on the shoulders of junior oppo
site hitter Matt Fuerbringer.
His offensive outburst last
weekend, highlighted by 48 kills
against Cal State-Northridge on
Monday night, pushed the two
time All-American from 14th in
the nation in kills per game to
fourth. However, the concern
for the coaching staff is whether
his recovering shoulder can con
tinue to handle the workload.
"Fuerbringer had a heck of a
weekend," Nieves said. "But
we'll have to monitor his
progress carefully even though
he's responded well to being a
big part of our offense."
Junior setter Stewart Chong
remains third in the country in
assists, averaging nearly 17 per
game. Sophomore middle block
er Keenan Whitehurst has
emerged as the team's most reli
able hitter, ranking fifth in the
nation with a .465 hitting per
centage. He will be looking for
continued success against the
Tigers, having put down ten
kills without a hitting error in
the teams' last meeting.
As the Cardinal prepares to
play its fourth match in seven
days, Nieves realizes that the
season has turned into a situa
tion where the men are now
playing for their postseason
lives.
"Every match is important
now," ho said. "Any one match
could be the one between quali
fying for the league tournament
and not qualifying. If our backs
aren't at the wall, they're real
close."
