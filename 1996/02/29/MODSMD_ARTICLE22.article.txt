# Swimmers head south for Pac-10 Invite
## Men get one last chance to fine-tune for Olympic Trials, qualify for NCAAs 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
Several members of the Stan
ford men's swimming team will
be heading downstate to Long
Beach, Calif., tomorrow to com
pete in this weekend's Pacific 10
Conference Invitational.
The Pac-10 Invite is a differ
ent competition from the Pac-10
championships, which are nor
mally held at the beginning of
March. Because 1996 is an
Olympic year, this season the
conference championships were
held in November of 1995. Hold
ing the championships in the fall
gives the top swimmers the op
portunity to compete in the
Olympic trials, which will be
held next week.
This weekend's Pac-10 Invite
serves not as a team competition
but as an opportunity for swim
mers to complete their fine-tun
ing and to get one last chance at
qualifying for the NCAA Cham
pionships. The Cardinal, which
is permitted to take as many as
18 swimmers to the NCAAs, has
already qualified 14. This week

end the team hopes that young
swimmers like freshmen Jed
Crowe, Justin Ewers and Blake
Holden, all of whom have come
on strong towards the end of the
year, will make times that will
enable them to compete at the
NCAAs.
"We're trying to get the best
NCAA team we can get," said ju
nior Scott Jones. "The main goal
besides getting fine-tuned is to
try to get a few more guys quali
fied."
This weekend's competition
will also help prepare swimmers
to assume the mind-set they will
need to compete well in a long
three-day meet like the NCAAs.
"It's a dress rehearsal," Jones
said. "It's the same format as
NCAAs, with prelims and finals.
Everyone's getting excited."
One reason for the excitement
the Stanford swimmers are shar
ing is that virtually all of them
will be shaving for the first time
this season, giving them the op
portunity to see how fast they
can really go.
"Everyone's excited about
shaving," Jones said. "The faster

times we can post, the more ex
citement we can build. We're al
ready excited by comparing our
times to the other times we're
seeing from across the country.
If we can qualify a few more
guys, it's just going to build."
One dimension about this
meet that will be different for
the team is that the swimmers
who are competing in the trials
— as well as the coaches — will

not attend. Though the sixteen
swimmers traveling to Long
Beach are certainly fast swim
mers, most of the veterans will
be absent.
"It is a little weird," Jones
said, "but it's going to be fun.
For the guys going to trials it
may be kind of draining, espe
cially emotionally. But we'll
