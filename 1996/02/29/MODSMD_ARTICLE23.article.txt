# UC-Davis next stop for women's water polo
## Cardinal seeks to avenge San Diego State loss at Davis tourney 
### Erin Bryla 
The Stanford women's water polo team will
be looking for a little revenge this weekend when
it heads upstate to take part in the UC-Davis
Tournament.
At Davis, the 2-2 Stanford women will face
UC-San Diego and San Diego State, teams they
played just two weeks ago in their season-open
ing tournament in San Diego. I he Cardinal will
also face UC-Santa Cruz on Saturday.
Two weeks ago, the Cardinal defeated host
school UCSD 7-3 but were handed a 6-3 loss by
San Diego State. It's that three-goal loss that the
women are hoping to avenge. Even though they
lost to SDSU, the Cardinal took something from
that game that will be sure to benefit them this
weekend.
"It was a physical game," said head coach Ben
Quittner. "Everyone gained a lot of experience
on how to play."

The Cardinal will have to use that experience
to its advantage this weekend, as the team will be
without the services of junior captain Alice Cath
cart. Cathcart, the team's main holeset, is out for
at least a week due to injury. Quittner will call
upon freshman Lindsay Tam to fill the vacated
position. In Cathcart's absence, Stanford will
also look to freshman Lindsay Welsh and junior
Olivia White to assume more of a leadership role.
While doing its best to fill Cathcart's shoes,
the Cardinal also hopes to improve in a number
of areas that were weak in San Diego.
"We need to make our one-on-nobody situa
tions," Quittner said. "We're also really not click
ing on man-advantage situations. We have the
speed and are reacting well, but out of 10 to 12
one-on-nobody's, we only scored once or twice.
So we will see how this weekend is going to go."
With the exception of Cathcart, things are
going well for most of the Cardinal athletes. Last
week at the Olympic Training Center in Col

orado Springs, both Welsh and freshman goal
keeper Heather Crary earned places on the Ju
nior National Team. Welsh, who is third on the
team in scoring, and Crary, who has 37 saves,
performed well enough the entire week to be
named to the national squad.
Welsh is not the only member of the team that
has set the net on fire thus far this season. White
has scored eight times in only five games, while
Tam has found the goal on five occasions.
"We will do well," Cathcart said. "We look
good. Everyone has been working hard."
The women's performance on Saturday will
determine whether or not they will advance into
the winner's bracket on Sunday. The tourna
ment also features UC-Santa Barbara, Califor
nia, Pacific and host school UC-Davis.
"I'm pretty happy with the way we have been
playing," Quittner said. "We lost a couple of close
games. This weekend we want to step up as a
team and begin playing better as a team."
