# Track & field kicks off outdoor season
## 
### Sam Wang 
After wrapping up the indoor
season last week, the Stanford
track and field teams finally
emerge from the dank interiors
of arena stadiums into the sun
and grass of the outdoors this
weekend — just in time to see
final vestiges of winter heading
out the door.
The Cardinal athletes fin
ished off the indoor season with a
bang by posting some impressive
showings at the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation Indoor
Championships, with the
women notching their best
MPSF finish ever at second place
and the men placing a re
spectable fifth.
The first meet of the new out
door season will be a four-way
contest this Saturday against
Fresno State, Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo and late-entry Sacra
mento State. Head coach Vin
Lananna sees this competition
more as an ending rather than a
beginning.
"This is our first meet [of the
outdoor season], but in a many
ways, it is also a last meet," he
said. "It is the end of our training
cycle and the beginning of our
competitive cycle.
"We're really not that con
cerned about the score in this
meet. This is an opportunity for
our athletes to get a feel for the
outdoor track because from now
on every meet they compete in
will be outdoors and this will be a
good gauge of where they are."
The coaching staff will take
this chance to unleash some of
the runners who have been held
out of indoor competition in
favor of the outdoor season. Red
shirt sophomore Gregory Jim
merson and junior Bryan Zmi
jewski are expected to provide
punch in both the 10,000 and the
3,000-meter steeplechase.
Two-sport racehorses Antho
ny Bookman and Damon Dunn,
rested and relaxed after a suc
cessful season on the gridiron
that led to a berth in the Liberty

Bowl, will be unveiled in the
short sprints.
On the women's side, the
team will be looking not only to
hone their skills in uniquely out
door events, such as the discus,
javelin, hammer, 400-meter hur
dles and the 10,000, but also to
shore up the traditionally weak
short sprints. Lananna is hoping
sophomores Heather Miller and
Bernadette Armand will step up
in the dash events.
"Things that are not usually
our strengths, we're hoping to
make them our strengths this
year," he said. "The short sprints
have been a weakness for us, but
we feel that we have it under con
trol this year."
Because of the upcoming
NCAA Indoor Track and Field
Championships, to be held
March 8 and 9, many of the top
runners from the indoor season
will be held out of this weekend's
meet, including junior Jimmie
Johnson, redshirt sophomore
Jason Lunn, sophomore Sarna
Renfro, senior Dena Dey and
freshman Mary Cobb.
"The reason that these ath
letes are not competing is be
cause they will be traveling to the
NCAA meet and we do not want
them to go on an outdoor track
[and then have to go back into
the indoors]," Lananna said.
The athletes traveling to San
Luis Obispo can expect to face
some tough competition in the
form of the Fresno State Bull
dogs. Both the men's and the
women's teams are extremely
gifted in head-to-head competi
tion.
But Lananna isn't too wor
ried.
"Fresno State is a formidable
program," he said. "They have a
great dual-meet team and they'll
be very tough for us to beat. But
the athletes who are competing
are very capable of doing a great
job this weekend.
"Even [after] pulling out top
impact people, I still have a lot of
confidence in our team to get the
job done."
