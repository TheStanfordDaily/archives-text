l V^ or those who have not yet experi
enced "Forever Tango," Luis Bravo's
m intoxicating musical extravaganza
enjoying a successful run in San Francisco, I
issue the following warning: Don't brave this
event on a blind, first or grudging date. This
stuff is more potent an aphrodisiac than
black olives marinated in Martini and Rossi,
and I even suspect that Eros, lurking like a
sniper in the wings, fires indiscriminately
into the audience.
Is the show really that good or am I that
easy? The best way to determine that is to
judge for yourself.
The melodromatic marcato rhythm, a
straight four-beat pattern with the accents
on the first and third beats, provides the un
derlying structure of the dance. The ban
doneon, a more melancholy version of the ac
cordion, comprises the body of the music
while betraying the tango's European ori
gins. Finally, there is the soul of tango music:
violins weeping melodies of insatiable yearn
ing and loneliness.
The dance is the corporeal expression of
the music. In front of a star-studded back
drop, a couple moves languorously, with
muted passion. This is a tender tango, its
edges have been softened as much by the
skillful choreography, which acts as a curtain
which shrouds the stage in a dream-like haze.
A belated look at the program reveals that the
scene is a metaphor: here the bandoneon is
making love to the night.
It is only the first in a scintillating series of
tangos that leave you groping for (as you see
fit) a cold drink, a cold compress, a cold
shower, your neighbor's knee .... The next
scene hearkens back to the Argentine tango's
original venue, Buenos Aires's suburban
brothels at the turn of the century. European
immigrants still clinging to New World
dreams, fiercely independent gauchos of the
Pampas and working-class district denizens
would gather to dance and vie for the prosti
tutes' favors.
Tango is distinguished by its incredible
range of expression, the ability, within the
choreographic vocabulary of a single dance,
to convey a vast array of emotions and
moods. In "EI Suburbio," the tender sensitiv
ity with which el bandoneon wooed la nochc
in the previous scene is dispersed by brazen
broads in fish nets and pin-striped pimps.
Lovers are transformed into combatants,
marking their turf and striving to dominate.
The dance itself resembles a bizarre martial
art, in which opponents embrace while exe
cuting an intricate series of steps that look
potentially lethal. Expertly sparring with
their feet, the dancers articulate the darker
side of the mating ritual: rage, jealously, frus
tration and conquest. After this scene, you
will never underestimate Argentine tango, or
forget the peril that lurks beneath its most
polished and domesticated exterior.

"Forever Tango" is a showcase for the
prowess of its tangueros, internationally
renowned and authentically Argentinian
dancers, as well as for the pluck of its pro
ducer, Bravo. But neither prowess nor pluck
(nor for that matter, Bravo's fortuitous
name) accounts for its phenomenal success
or that of its Broadway predecessor "Tango
Argentine)." Both shows rode and sustained
the wave of an international tango resur
gence. In the San Francisco Bay Area, tango is
not confined to Theatre on the Square, hut is

flourishing in a multitude of venues, includ
ing the Stanford campus.
In the Bay Area, tango events are held sev
eral times a week, ranging from informal
tango potlucks, to traditional Sunday Tango
Teas. "HI Firulete: The Argentine Tango
Newsletter" keeps tangueros apprised of go
ings-on in the Bay Area (as well as 1..A.),
while Stanford Dance supports the vibrant
tango culture on campus by sponsoring a
Tango Week, which brings the some of the
best tangueros and milongueros to instruct
the Stanford community. For those who are
just getting their toes wet in tango, beginning

and intermediate classes taught by Ken Del
mar, Chelsea Eng and Nora Dinzelbaucher
meet Mondays at the Elliot Program Center.
With the aim of observing tango divested
of its mystique, 1 attended an advanced tango
workshop held in the Escondido Village
Community Room. Beneath the unforgiving
fluorescent lighting, t-shirt and jean-clad
students practiced a style of tango more sub
tle than the melodramatic exhibition style
performed in "Forever Tango."
The bandoncdns wheezed from the boom

box and the instructor (the irrepressibly ra
diant Mariela Franganillo) offered correc
tion in a lilting Spanish-accented English
more musical than the music. I glimpsed Ar
gentine Tango whittled to its essence: a cou
ple is absolutely absorbed in one another and
their common movement while preserving
their individuality through improvised "em
bellishments." These variations within the
tango theme are challenges which the part
ner must meet, so the dance is pervaded by
the unpredictability and suspense which
characterize a romantic relationship.
Technically, the tango is a tryingdance, re

quiring tenacity from its adherents. The stu
dents present had danced tango for a couple
years on average and conceded that tango
"was a lot harder than regular ballroom."
"In ballroom you lead with yourarms, but
in tango you lead with your upper body," says
Ann Williamson, who has been dancing hall
room for four years and tango for two. The
tango couples' center of gravity is the point
where their chests are pressed together, so
that together they form an inverted "V," or,
more poetically, "one heart and four legs
Maintaining one's balance while performing
a moliiwte, a 360-degree turn executed in
four steps, or a cruzada, which entails cross
ing the left foot over the right, seems chal
lenge enough, without adding embellish
ments such as the boleo (bending one knee in
back of the other, and swiveling abruptly on
the supporting leg). And all this is to be done
supposedly in the throes of passion and long
ing.
I didn't see much overt passion and long
ing in these tangueros, but rather unmistak
able determination, concentration and occa
sional gratification at steps well executed.
Hut when asked about their attraction to the
dance, they spoke — from a multitude ot
mouths — as if with one heart.
"Tango is an amazingly passionate dance,
the only dance in which I feel I can articulate
something," says Yiannis Kontoyiannis, who
confesses that he caught the "tango bug" (no
relation to the jitterbug) two years ago and
began dancing maniacally for a period ot
about six months. For Yiannis, the tango e\
presses both extreme attraction and its con
summation, as well as their polar opposites:
rejection, abandonment and loneliness.
"A tango can say: You've ruined my life,
now that I've lost you I'm less than nothing,"
Yiannis asserts. And traditional tango lyrics,
though at first bawdy and bitter, became sad
and sentimental when appropriated by the
pens of Argentina's foremost poets, Pascual
Contursi and Enrique P. Maroni:
"If you knew, that still deep in my soul I
keep that affection that 1 always had lor you.
Who knows if you could know that 1 have
never forgotten you, looking back into your
past, you would remember me. My friends
no longer come to visit me, nobody wants to
console me in my affliction ... tell me pcr
canta, what have you done with my poor
heart?"
While Tango Puro advocates may insist
that a deep understanding and feeling lor
tango lyrics are essential (and this is quite be
yond the reach of the English speaker since
there are no English equivalents for some 400
Spanish emotional words which regularly
appear in tango lyrics) for the dance, they
seemed to me superfluous. Indeed, accord
ing to Tamara DeMarco, the world is super
fluous to a couple rapt in tango:
"At that moment, the only important
thing is you and your partner. The rest of the
world simply doesn't exist."
