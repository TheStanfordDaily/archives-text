# This old (Frank Lloyd Wight) house
## 
### Dee-Ann Durbin Contributing writer 
When people think of archi
tecture at Stanford, visions of
solid Romanesque sandstone
and names like Frederick Law
Olmsted most likely come to
mind. They're probably not
thinking of Frank Lloyd Wright.
But they should be.
One of Wright's most impor
tant works, Hanna House, is sit
uated in the quiet neighborhood
directly south of campus. The
house is the subject of a free lec
ture today.
Art Prof. Paul Turner, a spe
cialist on architectural history,
will present the lecture along
with David Neuman, University
architect. The lecture, entitled
"Stanford's Damaged Treasure:

Frank Lloyd Wright's Hanna House, just south of campus, is the subject of a free lecture today. The
event kicks off a fund-raising drive for repairs to the house which was damaged in the 1989 Loma Pri
eta earthquake.
Frank Lloyd Wright's Hanna
House," also kicks off a fund-rais
ing drive to repair damage caused
to the house by the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake.
"The reason it's taken us so
long to come up with a plan to re
pair it is all the studying and
restudying we've done," said
Laura Jones, a University archi
tect and an adviser to the board
overseeing repairs. "This is the
third plan to repair the house and
the least intrusive. The repairs
will be almost invisible."
Wright built the house in 1937
for Stanford professor Paul
Hanna and his wife, Jean. The
Hannas, both experts in educa
tion, worked closely with Wright
in all aspects of the home's de
sign and construction. Later,
Wright wrote that his collabora
tion with the Hannas had been
unusually productive, yielding
one of his most innovative home

designs to date.
The Hannas were the first of
Wright's clients to adopt a radical
ly new style that Wright had been
envisioning since the 19205.
Wright wanted to replace tradi
tional rectangular floor plans with
those based upon triangles, hexa
gons or circles, and built Hanna
House on a hexagonal plan.
Many scholars believe that for
Wright, this radical period culmi
nated in 1944 when he began
building his circular masterpiece,
the Solomon Guggenheim Muse
um in New York City.
The Hannas made their home
available to students, architects
and many other visitors. Stories
about the house were published
widely; in 1963, an entire issue of
"House Beautiful" was devoted to
Hanna House.
In 1975, the Hannas gave their
home to Stanford, which has used
it for university purposes ever
since. Hanna House was the offi
cial home of Stanford's provost
until 1989, when the earthquake
damaged several portions of the
house, including the central fire

place and sections of the concrete
pad upon which the house is built.
The house has been closed since
that time.
In 1993, University President
Gerhard Casper established the
Hanna House Board of Governors
to oversee the restoration of the
House, a project estimated at $2
million. The plans for the house
include increasing the home's
structural strength and replacing
original materials.
After its restoration, Hanna
house will be used for classes, sem
inars, receptions and other uni
versity events. It will also be open
for public tours.
One million dollars have al
ready been raised for the Hanna
House restoration project, pri
marily from the Federal Emer
gency Management Agency and
the Nissan Corporation. The
Hanna House Board of Governors
is hoping to raise an additional $1
million to complete the project.

The lecture on Hanna House will
be at sp.m. in Annenberg Audito
rium in Cummings Art Building.
