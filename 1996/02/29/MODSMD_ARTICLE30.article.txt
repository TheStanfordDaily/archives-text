Swedish trio Salt have just played
their first gig in the United States,
and I am speaking to guitarist
Daniel Ewerman about what it's like to
be here for the first time.
"It's like going around in an
interactive American film," he says.
V"The only thing we know about
/ America comes from films we have
1 seen. I just walked around for two
hours, and it was really nice."
) They are in Portland, Ore., at
the moment, stranded for a day by
flooding. Ewerman feels nipped in
the bud. "We were sorry we couldn't
get to Vancouver today. We want to
see Canada."
His enthusiasm is refreshing.
Negativity and disillusionment seem
to run thick among the U.S. alterna
tive set. It just goes to show that while
v Salt may sound like bands you've
) heard before, their attitude is
v unique.
I ask Ewerman about his im
y pression of American fans. "It's
j hard to say," he tells me. "Yesterday,
they were really fine. It felt like what
we were giving them, they would try
to give back immediately. So if we
start kicking things down on stage,
they will do the same."
His English is a tad hesitant
and so he should be forgiven his in
\ comprehensible moments. He is
r excited to play more gigs and he an-
J ticipates an equally warm reception.
Americans, he says, "are really fun,
j open-minded people."
This time he may have gone
i too far, and while 1 like his optimism,
part of me can't help but be skeptical.
L Give him a few weeks, I think.
\ rn hree years ago, vocalist / gui-
A I tar player Nina Ramsby and
& I drummer Jim Tegman
JT moved into a run-down house
boat in Stockholm. Ewerman,
eager to escape his parents'
house, spent most of his time
Fv*- with Ramsby and Tegman, and
the three began playing together
immediately.

"We had met perhaps one year earlier than
that," Ewerman says. "Jim and I were at the
same art school in Stockholm. Nina was at an
other. They lived at the houseboat for six or
seven months or something."
The newly formed Salt played at that inaus
picious locale as long as they could. "We had a
couple of parties. Then after a while we got
kicked out for making too much noise."
At first, Salt had no intentions of exclusively
playing rock and roll. "We thought of making
music and trying different styles," Ewerman
says. "We were playing everything from soul to
reggae and then after a while it just seemed like
rock was the kind of music we wanted to do."
Ewerman says that Ramsby chose to write
the lyrics in English because it gave the band a
more direct emotional impact. "I think it
would have been a challenge to write in
Swedish." In their native language, Ewerman
says, the band would have felt like they were
hiding behind their words. "Perhaps it can be
more direct doing it not in your own language,"

he says.
I like the idea: a self-imposed innocence. A
risk, certainly, but a cursory listen to Salt's
debut, "Auscultate," quiets any fears. There's lit
tle uncertainty there. "You won't leave until 1
say so," Ramsby sings on "Honour Me."
aking the stage at the Bottom of the Hill in
San Francisco two weeks ago, Salt seemed
I like three friendly Swedes from next door.
Ramsby looked uncommonly spiffy, in a suit
jacket and pants. Ewerman was goofier, a euro
looking Kris Novoselic, tall and lanky. Tegman
was all smiles at the drum set as the press-heavy
crowd gave them a cheer.
The music, a hybrid of the Breeders and PJ
Harvey, was unexpectedly driving. The single
"Bluster" is all over modern rock radio and it
was delivered early in the set, loud, tight and
confident. Salt seemed emboldened by their
own buzz.
Ewerman tells me that the band grew more
sure of themselves after a European tour

m*
through Germany, Holland, Belgium I
and Switzerland. The reception was
laudatory. "Switzerland was really
good," Ewerman reports. "We love the
travel. It's really fun going around in the
van. 1 think that will get into the music
when we do the next record."
Salt welcomes comparisons to sim
ilar sounding veterans of alternative C
rock. Ramsby, with her wide ranging L
vocals, seems particularly indebted to 112 ,
Sinead O'Connor and PJI larvey. Salt Y
delivers a spare if impactive sound, J
with gentle verses building into angry ><
refrains. According to Ewerman, this V
Nirvana-esque tendency came almost \
accidentally.
"I think in the beginning we realized
we were kind of missing a guitar," he
says. "So, to have the kind of pressure in
the chorus we wanted, we had to get
quiet during the verses. We didn't want
to have to get another guitar player." C
The result is satisfying and astringent \
with a stripped-down quality that (
seems doubly striking coming from Y
Sweden. (
"I think many people are saying a r
how come so many bands coming
from Sweden sound like Ace of Base," y
he says. "Really, there are many bands I
that sound like us, but they never get /
out. It's quite good to show that there >
are more kinds of music in Sweden. It
has a really good scene, actually."
"Auscultate" should do much to re- \
configure public opinion. Edgy and /
compelling, the album still manages f#
to communicate some vulnerability. {
"I'd really like to know some of you," U
Ramsby sings on "Blaster," "I'd really j
like to know where you're heading." I
It's this yearning to find out that A
makes staying an extra day in Portland T
so frustrating. Salt is eager to get on r
with it, to make something of their
rising popularity. /
Still, though, there's a bit of \ \
residual eagerness to get back home,
to some of that normalcy they had y
at the houseboat in Stockholm.
"We're here until the 15th of
March. Then we go back to Sweden
and have five days with our girl
friends," he says, laughing. Â»
In the meantime, catch them
while you can.

Swedish trio Salt have just played
their first gig in the United States,
and I am speaking to guitarist
Daniel Ewerman about what it's like to
be here for the first time.
"It's like going around in an
interactive American film," he says.
V"The only thing we know about
/ America comes from films we have
1 seen. I just walked around for two
hours, and it was really nice."
) They are in Portland, Ore., at
the moment, stranded for a day by
flooding. Ewerman feels nipped in
the bud. "We were sorry we couldn't
get to Vancouver today. We want to
see Canada."
His enthusiasm is refreshing.
Negativity and disillusionment seem
to run thick among the U.S. alterna
tive set. It just goes to show that while
v Salt may sound like bands you've
) heard before, their attitude is
v unique.
I ask Ewerman about his im
y pression of American fans. "It's
j hard to say," he tells me. "Yesterday,
they were really fine. It felt like what
we were giving them, they would try
to give back immediately. So if we
start kicking things down on stage,
they will do the same."
His English is a tad hesitant
and so he should be forgiven his in
\ comprehensible moments. He is
r excited to play more gigs and he an-
J ticipates an equally warm reception.
Americans, he says, "are really fun,
j open-minded people."
This time he may have gone
i too far, and while 1 like his optimism,
part of me can't help but be skeptical.
L Give him a few weeks, I think.
\ rn hree years ago, vocalist / gui-
A I tar player Nina Ramsby and
& I drummer Jim Tegman
JT moved into a run-down house
boat in Stockholm. Ewerman,
eager to escape his parents'
house, spent most of his time
Fv*- with Ramsby and Tegman, and
the three began playing together
immediately.

"We had met perhaps one year earlier than
that," Ewerman says. "Jim and I were at the
same art school in Stockholm. Nina was at an
other. They lived at the houseboat for six or
seven months or something."
The newly formed Salt played at that inaus
picious locale as long as they could. "We had a
couple of parties. Then after a while we got
kicked out for making too much noise."
At first, Salt had no intentions of exclusively
playing rock and roll. "We thought of making
music and trying different styles," Ewerman
says. "We were playing everything from soul to
reggae and then after a while it just seemed like
rock was the kind of music we wanted to do."
Ewerman says that Ramsby chose to write
the lyrics in English because it gave the band a
more direct emotional impact. "I think it
would have been a challenge to write in
Swedish." In their native language, Ewerman
says, the band would have felt like they were
hiding behind their words. "Perhaps it can be
more direct doing it not in your own language,"

he says.
I like the idea: a self-imposed innocence. A
risk, certainly, but a cursory listen to Salt's
debut, "Auscultate," quiets any fears. There's lit
tle uncertainty there. "You won't leave until 1
say so," Ramsby sings on "Honour Me."
aking the stage at the Bottom of the Hill in
San Francisco two weeks ago, Salt seemed
I like three friendly Swedes from next door.
Ramsby looked uncommonly spiffy, in a suit
jacket and pants. Ewerman was goofier, a euro
looking Kris Novoselic, tall and lanky. Tegman
was all smiles at the drum set as the press-heavy
crowd gave them a cheer.
The music, a hybrid of the Breeders and PJ
Harvey, was unexpectedly driving. The single
"Bluster" is all over modern rock radio and it
was delivered early in the set, loud, tight and
confident. Salt seemed emboldened by their
own buzz.
Ewerman tells me that the band grew more
sure of themselves after a European tour

m*
through Germany, Holland, Belgium I
and Switzerland. The reception was
laudatory. "Switzerland was really
good," Ewerman reports. "We love the
travel. It's really fun going around in the
van. 1 think that will get into the music
when we do the next record."
Salt welcomes comparisons to sim
ilar sounding veterans of alternative C
rock. Ramsby, with her wide ranging L
vocals, seems particularly indebted to 112 ,
Sinead O'Connor and PJI larvey. Salt Y
delivers a spare if impactive sound, J
with gentle verses building into angry ><
refrains. According to Ewerman, this V
Nirvana-esque tendency came almost \
accidentally.
"I think in the beginning we realized
we were kind of missing a guitar," he
says. "So, to have the kind of pressure in
the chorus we wanted, we had to get
quiet during the verses. We didn't want
to have to get another guitar player." C
The result is satisfying and astringent \
with a stripped-down quality that (
seems doubly striking coming from Y
Sweden. (
