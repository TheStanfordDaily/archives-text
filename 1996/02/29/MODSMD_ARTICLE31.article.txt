## Capellini's: Faust's food 
### Eric Hsu 
In unremark
able San Mateo,
an upscale Ital
ian restaurant
sits, pacifically,
on the corner.
Once past the
substantial

frosted-glass
double doors, a mob of patrons
waiting for tables invariably over
flows the bar and crowds the mini
foyer. This is not a trivial design flaw.
Considering the fact that reservations
are heavily encouraged but frequent
ly ignored, one can expect to stand
uselessly about obstructing traffic
over the course of a josUed wait.
Fortunately, Capcllini's provides
something in the way of visual plea
sure from the moment you lay eyes
on it. The bar and entryway form
what is an altogether impeccably ap
pointed central dining area, finished
in the signature style of Bay area
restaurateur Pat Kuleto. Cathedral
ceilings, wall-length frescoes, a dark,
mirror-backed mahogany bar and
drowsily reflective brass tubing de
mand an audience. More than once I
found myself and my dinner com
panion daftly scrutinizing the eclec
tic light fixtures.
At first glance, the clientele leans
towards the upwardly social mobile
crowd, which is, of course, part of the
magic. The lavish settings foster up
perclassism, replete with a staff

plainly tutored in the fine art of def
erence.
Capcllini's offers a respectable
wine list including vintages, with the
majority of labels falling in a reason
able $15-$3O per bottle range. Drinks
from the bar are slow and predictably
expensive. Nightly specials lack such
consistency, and fluctuate in appeal
and variety. I have eaten a dinner cho
sen exclusively from the specials menu
which surrendered momentarily de
bilitating oysters on the half shell(as
temperatures drop, now is the mo
ment) and musky, suggestive duck,
but this evening's offerings were drab
and unadventurous. Fortunately, the
permanent menu is inviting enough
to merit its own attention. Gourmet
pizzas are the glaring exception, which
no one seems particularly to enjoy,
and which I think clash hopelessly
with the nachtgcist.
Be wary of filling up on the toasty
bread set inexhaustibly on the table,
which calls compulsively to be
loaded up in a pool of salt and green
olive oil. Antipasto selections come
in generous portions, but can be hit
and miss. On this outing, we tried
cantaloupe and honeydew balls
splashed in a juice of tawny port and
served among slices of parma
proscuitto. The combination had a
mild, cool effect, but it was, on the
whole, unmemorable. More arrest
ing are the wood oven-roasted porta
bello mushrooms braised in a sun
dried tomato herb dressing.
Arranged in a pleasing silver platter,

the mushrooms are big
ger than your face, fleshy
and unusual, and best

when shared with a
friend (mushrooms always are).
The house salad is so nondescript
it should only be requested out of rit
ual observance. In a similar vein, the
main dishes at Capellini's are prone
to the dubious distinction of becom
ing "favorites," displaying an aspect
of accomplishment marred by an
equal measure of complacency. The
wood oven-roasted chicken always
gratifies with strong herbal season
ings and a juicy, undercooked ten
derness. It can be ordered as its own
entree or shredded into a fusilli pasta
dish, where it is served with chopped
vegetables and a dijon mustard
sauce. In the latter case, the mustard
sauce was weak but the diced golden
peppers sweet There was a threat of
too much parsley. As with most dish
es here, one can safely forego extra
parmesan cheese.
A wearied-sounding "Shrimp
and Spaghetti" proved the darkhorse
winner of the night. The pasta issued
from the kitchen pleasandy al dente,
and the sun-dried tomato, basil and
garlic pesto is an original house for
mula. But the flavor and consistency
of the plump, striped prawns: they
were of a like ordinarily found only in
the choicest dim sum. The blend of
seafood with sun-dried tomatoes
made for a tangy sweet twist.
Paul Bourrillion has been run
ning the show as head chef at Ris
torante Capellini's for the six-odd
years of its existence. We pondered
what it meant for a French-named
cook to set the menu in a luxurious

Italian trattoria such as this. Our
maitre'd could see our curiosity was
piqued, and at the end the meal
brought us to the kitchen bar where
Paul was just finishing his dinner.
When he looked up over a plain filet
of fish, my friend released a short,
low whisde. The bushy brown mus
tache was all French, but black, al
mond eyes clearly spoke Asian. Over
the course of a friendly chat, he con
firmed this casually for us, admitting,
"But I can't cook Chinese." Eat at
Capellini's, where a half-French,
half-Asian chef specializes in Italian.
The French touch at Capellini's
graces a line-up of superlative
deserts, which add a welcome haute
finale to the evening. Your fork will
barely blemish the smooth interior of
a fresh lemon-and-lime torte, radi
ant in a raspberry-and-cream
anglaise sauce. And the caldo pane
Budino is one of the few deserts I

have ever withheld from a dining
companion out of pure selfishness:
warm bread pudding nested against
a scoop of vanilla bean gelato and
bathed in brandy hard sauce.
Capellini's is out of the reach of
most on a regular dining basis, falling
somewhere between $30 and $50 for
two, but that hasn't kept a wealth of
people from spending what is proba
bly far beyond their budgets. A two
hour promise of unrelenting atmos
phere, a culture of luxury and high
quality, occasionally outstanding
food awaits. The people know this is
only a dining experience, but it is one
they are willing to sell their souls for.

able $15-$3O per bottle range. Drinks
from the bar are slow and predictably
expensive. Nightly specials lack such
consistency, and fluctuate in appeal
and variety. I have eaten a dinner cho
sen exclusively from the specials menu
which surrendered momentarily de
bilitating oysters on the half shell(as
temperatures drop, now is the mo
ment) and musky, suggestive duck,
but this evening's offerings were drab
and unadventurous. Fortunately, the
permanent menu is inviting enough
to merit its own attention. Gourmet
pizzas are the glaring exception, which
no one seems particularly to enjoy,
and which I think clash hopelessly
with the nachtgcist.
Be wary of filling up on the toasty
bread set inexhaustibly on the table,
which calls compulsively to be
loaded up in a pool of salt and green
olive oil. Antipasto selections come
in generous portions, but can be hit
and miss. On this outing, we tried
cantaloupe and honeydew balls
splashed in a juice of tawny port and
served among slices of parma
proscuitto. The combination had a
mild, cool effect, but it was, on the
whole, unmemorable. More arrest
ing are the wood oven-roasted porta
bello mushrooms braised in a sun
dried tomato herb dressing.
Arranged in a pleasing silver platter,

the mushrooms are big
ger than your face, fleshy
and unusual, and best

when shared with a
friend (mushrooms always are).
The house salad is so nondescript
it should only be requested out of rit
ual observance. In a similar vein, the
main dishes at Capellini's are prone
to the dubious distinction of becom
ing "favorites," displaying an aspect
of accomplishment marred by an
equal measure of complacency. The
wood oven-roasted chicken always
gratifies with strong herbal season
ings and a juicy, undercooked ten
derness. It can be ordered as its own
entree or shredded into a fusilli pasta
dish, where it is served with chopped
vegetables and a dijon mustard
sauce. In the latter case, the mustard
sauce was weak but the diced golden
peppers sweet There was a threat of
too much parsley. As with most dish
es here, one can safely forego extra
parmesan cheese.
A wearied-sounding "Shrimp
and Spaghetti" proved the darkhorse
winner of the night. The pasta issued
from the kitchen pleasandy al dente,
and the sun-dried tomato, basil and
garlic pesto is an original house for
mula. But the flavor and consistency
of the plump, striped prawns: they
were of a like ordinarily found only in
the choicest dim sum. The blend of
seafood with sun-dried tomatoes
made for a tangy sweet twist.
Paul Bourrillion has been run
ning the show as head chef at Ris
torante Capellini's for the six-odd
years of its existence. We pondered
what it meant for a French-named
cook to set the menu in a luxurious

Italian trattoria such as this. Our
maitre'd could see our curiosity was
piqued, and at the end the meal
brought us to the kitchen bar where
Paul was just finishing his dinner.
When he looked up over a plain filet
of fish, my friend released a short,
low whisde. The bushy brown mus
tache was all French, but black, al
mond eyes clearly spoke Asian. Over
the course of a friendly chat, he con
firmed this casually for us, admitting,
"But I can't cook Chinese." Eat at
Capellini's, where a half-French,
half-Asian chef specializes in Italian.
The French touch at Capellini's
graces a line-up of superlative
deserts, which add a welcome haute
finale to the evening. Your fork will
barely blemish the smooth interior of
a fresh lemon-and-lime torte, radi
ant in a raspberry-and-cream
anglaise sauce. And the caldo pane
Budino is one of the few deserts I

have ever withheld from a dining
companion out of pure selfishness:
warm bread pudding nested against
a scoop of vanilla bean gelato and
bathed in brandy hard sauce.
Capellini's is out of the reach of
most on a regular dining basis, falling
somewhere between $30 and $50 for
two, but that hasn't kept a wealth of
people from spending what is proba
bly far beyond their budgets. A two
hour promise of unrelenting atmos
phere, a culture of luxury and high
quality, occasionally outstanding
food awaits. The people know this is
only a dining experience, but it is one
they are willing to sell their souls for.
