# ABSOLUTELY SCHMABULOUS!

The fourth floor of Saks is fevered with
Mizrahi Mayhem.
Stomping on the path of fuchsia stars that
stretches from the escalator to the roped-off
seating area, journalists and V.I.P.s rush to
perch on the best folding chairs in the house.
Isaac groupies and fashion victimcs crowd be
hind the velvet rope, drooling for a chance just
to inhale the second-hand smoke of their All
wise, All-merciful and All-fabulous cult hero
of couture.
Hollywood show tunes are blaring from
the speakers. Concessions girls are pushing
salt-free popcorn and Pellegrino spritzers to
the pre-show horde. Three women sitting
next to me in the front row, wearing nothing
but white terry cloth robes, wiggle their bare
calves in anticipation of His arrival.
And then [insert drum roll here] .... the
Isaac cotneth.
Last Thursday, Isaac Mizrahi unveiled his
latest line of fab-wear at San Francisco's
Saks Fifth Avenue store in Union Square.
Since "Unzipped" — the critically acclaimed
documentary that spans six months of his life
and work, from the failure of his spring 1994
collection to the triumph of his fall show later
that year— Mizrahi fan club membership has
increased exponentially. The film, made by
former lover Douglas Keevc, has catapulted
the fashion designer from the esoteric
columns of Vogue and Bazaar to spreads in
everyone's favorite populist rag, People maga
zine.
Although Mizrahi's fashions are worn by
everyone from Liz to Oprah, the mop-topped
designer still ain't a household name as yet.
Since graduating from Parsons in 1987 at 27
years of age, Mizrahi has been in the frock biz,
catering to the "financially fabulous' with the
$800 jackets and $2,000 dresses of his signa
ture collection. Quite unlike Calvin Klein or
Donna Karan, Isaac Mizrahi has yet to make
that great commercial leap forward beyond
hyper-priced couture.
Until now.
His new collection is christened IS"C, a
label that emphasizes the star power of the
duds and the illusion of celebrity that an IS" *C

Capri

pant or

satin shirt

can bring to its wearer. Be-

fore the show, I talked with

Nina Santisi, the vice-president of public rcla

tions and advertising for Isaac Mizrahi, about
the image Mizrahi's new line is striving to con
vey. Santisi asserts that the star focus of the
new line is not the designer's celebrity, but
rather she who wears Isaac's designs: "The
idea and what has been the idea in our cam
paign is that Isaac is not the star, but any
woman can be a star."
Santisi continues, stating that Isaac
Mizrahi has intentionally chosen a promo
tional route that does not borrow the talents
of Linda, Cindy, Naomi, Nadja or Kate to
show off the goods but, instead, the more real
istic frames of the actual women who will
wear IS **C:
"Isaac is actually staging a shopping experi
ence .... [Wje've chosen three local women
who have already shopped with Isaac and will
be trying on their outfits for the first time
tonight ... this event is entertaining and in
formative. It's also more in tune with real
women. You're used to seeing this on models,
but this is more real."
Then, the show begins with a puff of
smoke.
Isaac, encased in a charcoal gray mandarin
collar suit, glides onto the stage and eager
ly lights up a cigarette, though wary of the
reaction of the infamously health-conscious
Frisco crowd: "Can I light a cigarette?" he
whimpers, "Am I being politically correct?
You know I was wearing a tur coat before."
Adoring giggles from the horde of journalists
and fans before him condone the designer's
disrespect of the NO SMOKING sign and ap
plaud his neurotic-chain-smoking-New-
Yawk-designer schtick.
The nicotined Mizrahi continues by issu
ing a disclaimer: " This is not a typical fashion
show ... it's more like a meeting. An A.A.
meeting." The designer pushes his Adam Fin
gerhut ringlets away from his furrowed brow
and calls forth the first victime.
Her name is Allison Jun, a pert Asian-
American 20-something urbling, also one of
the wiggling dames who have been wearing
nothing but white terry cloth robes. Allison
mounts the stage and shines a smile of white
chiclet teeth.
"What do you do?" Mizrahi asks, jutting
his Donahue microphone into her smile.

"I work for 'Hot Wired' — the on
line magazine..
Mizrahi then throws a
deadpan "yeah, right" expres-
ST m sion at the audience and
& cynically mutters, "That
™ means she works in the cafe
teria." He takes another drag
and then ushers her to the
dressing room on stage to try on
her pre-selected IS**Cgarb, including
a fuchsia sweater, Stretch Denim Pea ('.oat
($260) and Stretch Denim Surprise Skirt
kxh)
Moments later, Allison reemerges on stage,
thoroughly denimed and beaming. Mizrahi
eyes her up and down and throws a kinetic fit
characteristic of a pre-teen I leather at the mall
with her best friend:
"Oh! Ohmigod! Allison, you look fabu
lous!"
Allison turns around, as if on cue, and al
lows the audience to fully view the skirt she is
wearing, an itty-bitty slip of denim that is ac
tually a pair of flared short shorts. To reveal
the actual identity of the "Surprise Skirt,"
Mizrahi orders Allison to "Turn around!" and
"Bend over!" He then comforts the audience
with a "Seeeeeeeeee, they're not dangerous."
Other examples of IS**C frocks that graced
the stage during the course of the evening in
clude a tailored blazer in lime, lavender and

blue madras cotton — a $220 item which
Mi/.rahi affectionately deems "Nantucket on
drugs;" a pair of Day Glo lime linen capri
pants ($160), his Prince of Wales Karate skirt
— a $126 option for the corporate raider who
likes classic patterns n' drawstring waists; and
a washable Sequined Polo Dress ($200) which
the designer hails for being
American: "That's American, the idea of
washing your own sequins! 1 have a
round of applause pleascW"
Not only does his mother think he's a ge
nius (a fact well known by all who've seen
"Unzipped"), the entire assembly of Isaac
groupies on the fourth floor of Saks believe
he's Mensa Material. Aspiring designers lav
ishly praise his hemlines with passionate ap
plause. Middle-aged shopaholics coo at the
splendor of his Pink Nylon Trench Cx>at. Jour
nalists are scrawling down his every word,
desperately attempting to record the wit of
one of the few truly original fashion designers
in the United States today.
But Allison is unimpressed. The petite
young woman, standing in a pair of dress
pants that are quite obviously too long, tells
Isaac, "I would like to see you make clothes for
short people."
In response, America's latest fashion dar
ling brushes her off like stray lint on velvet:
"There's an alteration department, you
know."

fore the show, I talked with

Nina Santisi, the vice-president of public rcla

tions and advertising for Isaac Mizrahi, about
the image Mizrahi's new line is striving to con
vey. Santisi asserts that the star focus of the
new line is not the designer's celebrity, but
rather she who wears Isaac's designs: "The
idea and what has been the idea in our cam
paign is that Isaac is not the star, but any
woman can be a star."
Santisi continues, stating that Isaac
Mizrahi has intentionally chosen a promo
tional route that does not borrow the talents
of Linda, Cindy, Naomi, Nadja or Kate to
show off the goods but, instead, the more real
istic frames of the actual women who will
wear IS **C:
"Isaac is actually staging a shopping experi
ence .... [Wje've chosen three local women
who have already shopped with Isaac and will
be trying on their outfits for the first time
tonight ... this event is entertaining and in
formative. It's also more in tune with real
women. You're used to seeing this on models,
but this is more real."
Then, the show begins with a puff of
smoke.
Isaac, encased in a charcoal gray mandarin
collar suit, glides onto the stage and eager
ly lights up a cigarette, though wary of the
reaction of the infamously health-conscious
Frisco crowd: "Can I light a cigarette?" he
whimpers, "Am I being politically correct?
You know I was wearing a tur coat before."
Adoring giggles from the horde of journalists
and fans before him condone the designer's
disrespect of the NO SMOKING sign and ap
plaud his neurotic-chain-smoking-New-
Yawk-designer schtick.
The nicotined Mizrahi continues by issu
ing a disclaimer: " This is not a typical fashion
show ... it's more like a meeting. An A.A.
meeting." The designer pushes his Adam Fin
gerhut ringlets away from his furrowed brow
and calls forth the first victime.
Her name is Allison Jun, a pert Asian-
American 20-something urbling, also one of
the wiggling dames who have been wearing
nothing but white terry cloth robes. Allison
mounts the stage and shines a smile of white
chiclet teeth.
"What do you do?" Mizrahi asks, jutting
his Donahue microphone into her smile.

"I work for 'Hot Wired' — the on
line magazine..
Mizrahi then throws a
deadpan "yeah, right" expres-
ST m sion at the audience and
& cynically mutters, "That
™ means she works in the cafe
teria." He takes another drag
and then ushers her to the
dressing room on stage to try on
her pre-selected IS**Cgarb, including
a fuchsia sweater, Stretch Denim Pea ('.oat
($260) and Stretch Denim Surprise Skirt
kxh)
Moments later, Allison reemerges on stage,
thoroughly denimed and beaming. Mizrahi
eyes her up and down and throws a kinetic fit
characteristic of a pre-teen I leather at the mall
with her best friend:
"Oh! Ohmigod! Allison, you look fabu
lous!"
Allison turns around, as if on cue, and al
lows the audience to fully view the skirt she is
wearing, an itty-bitty slip of denim that is ac
tually a pair of flared short shorts. To reveal
the actual identity of the "Surprise Skirt,"
Mizrahi orders Allison to "Turn around!" and
"Bend over!" He then comforts the audience
with a "Seeeeeeeeee, they're not dangerous."
Other examples of IS**C frocks that graced
the stage during the course of the evening in
clude a tailored blazer in lime, lavender and

blue madras cotton — a $220 item which
Mi/.rahi affectionately deems "Nantucket on
drugs;" a pair of Day Glo lime linen capri
pants ($160), his Prince of Wales Karate skirt
— a $126 option for the corporate raider who
likes classic patterns n' drawstring waists; and
a washable Sequined Polo Dress ($200) which
the designer hails for being
American: "That's American, the idea of
washing your own sequins! 1 have a
round of applause pleascW"
Not only does his mother think he's a ge
nius (a fact well known by all who've seen
"Unzipped"), the entire assembly of Isaac
groupies on the fourth floor of Saks believe
he's Mensa Material. Aspiring designers lav
ishly praise his hemlines with passionate ap
plause. Middle-aged shopaholics coo at the
splendor of his Pink Nylon Trench Cx>at. Jour
nalists are scrawling down his every word,
desperately attempting to record the wit of
one of the few truly original fashion designers
in the United States today.
But Allison is unimpressed. The petite
young woman, standing in a pair of dress
pants that are quite obviously too long, tells
Isaac, "I would like to see you make clothes for
short people."
In response, America's latest fashion dar
ling brushes her off like stray lint on velvet:
"There's an alteration department, you
know."

The fourth floor of Saks is fevered with
Mizrahi Mayhem.
Stomping on the path of fuchsia stars that
stretches from the escalator to the roped-off
seating area, journalists and V.I.P.s rush to
perch on the best folding chairs in the house.
Isaac groupies and fashion victimcs crowd be
hind the velvet rope, drooling for a chance just
to inhale the second-hand smoke of their All
wise, All-merciful and All-fabulous cult hero
of couture.
Hollywood show tunes are blaring from
the speakers. Concessions girls are pushing
salt-free popcorn and Pellegrino spritzers to
the pre-show horde. Three women sitting
next to me in the front row, wearing nothing
but white terry cloth robes, wiggle their bare
calves in anticipation of His arrival.
And then [insert drum roll here] .... the
Isaac cotneth.
Last Thursday, Isaac Mizrahi unveiled his
latest line of fab-wear at San Francisco's
Saks Fifth Avenue store in Union Square.
Since "Unzipped" — the critically acclaimed
documentary that spans six months of his life
and work, from the failure of his spring 1994
collection to the triumph of his fall show later
that year— Mizrahi fan club membership has
increased exponentially. The film, made by
former lover Douglas Keevc, has catapulted
the fashion designer from the esoteric
columns of Vogue and Bazaar to spreads in
everyone's favorite populist rag, People maga
zine.
Although Mizrahi's fashions are worn by
everyone from Liz to Oprah, the mop-topped
designer still ain't a household name as yet.
Since graduating from Parsons in 1987 at 27
years of age, Mizrahi has been in the frock biz,
catering to the "financially fabulous' with the
$800 jackets and $2,000 dresses of his signa
ture collection. Quite unlike Calvin Klein or
Donna Karan, Isaac Mizrahi has yet to make
that great commercial leap forward beyond
hyper-priced couture.
Until now.
His new collection is christened IS"C, a
label that emphasizes the star power of the
duds and the illusion of celebrity that an IS" *C
