"If you say a word often enough, it becomes
you." — Anna Deavere Smith
The woman tried to recall the color of
her grandfather's eyes. Were they light, or
dark like hers? She couldn't remember. But
she never forgets something he once said
to her.
Anna Deavere Smith repeated what her
grandfather told her when she was a little
girl in Baltimore: words said often enough
become you.
The actress is tall and thin like he was.
"When I think of myself as an intellec
tual in any way," Smith said, "I think of his
face."
That moment ot listening to her grand
father was her first transformation. Her
life has changed since then, from one dra
matic turn to the next, like the epiphanies
of a believer.
"Art is transformative," she said.
Playwright, actress and Stanford associ
ate professor, Anna Deavere Smith takes
the words of other people, repeats them to
an audience of hundreds each night,
sometimes in San Francisco, Los Angeles
or New York, and transforms into the au
thor ofthose words. This is her theater. She
interviews people who have been a part ot
an event, such as the 1992 riots in Los An
geles or the Crown Heights riots in New
York City, and tells of their experiences on
stage as it she was that person. Think of it
as an on stage documentary.
Her plays and life are an exercise in
transformation, it is difficult to describe
the style of her theater because American

drama has never quite looked like this.
Some papers call her a chameleon. In
"Twilight: l.os Angeles, 1992, presently
running in San Francisco, she changes
from one person to the next, playing 40
different characters who talk about their
time in the 1..A. riots. But chameleons only
change color. At times Smith is a I.atina
woman, a young African-American rioter,
a Korean shop owner, a white police train
er or a I lollvwood agent. She brings a com
plex and poetic multicultural experience
to the stage and this brings blacks, whites,
Latinos and Asians to the theater.
All through words said so many times
they become her.
Smith and I talked in her cramped of
fice on the second floor of Stanford's
Drama Department building, behind the
Memorial Auditorium. Stanford recruited
Smith in 1990 and full classes point to her
popularity. She teaches two courses here
one quarter each year. This winter they are
"Interviewing Techniques — In Search ot
American Character" and "Directing the
Actor." The small, cream-colored room
was bare, save for a framed photograph
from Africa and a slight tapestry. She
doesn't waste time on decoration. She cur
rently teaches 65 students, performs "Twi
light" daily, researches her next project
and rehearses in the morning.
"She works her ass off, well, she works
very, very hard, and she demands that
same effort and intensity from those who
work around her," said her teaching assis
tant Jamie Lyons. To add to Smith's long
list of responsibilities, she also published
an article in this week's women's edition of
the New Yorker.
Her crisp white shirt was misbuttoned

during our interview. She looked like she
had been in a hurry that afternoon. But in
between the rush of her life there have
been hot spots and transformations that
brought her closer to what she is doing
today. It started twenty years ago.
"/ went to an acting class and saw some
body change before my very eyes. Ami I
thought, well, yon know, people can change.
I know social change is possible because I see
this individual changing right before my
eyes."
Smith came to California in the 1970s
looking for social movements that would
bring her closer to the world. When she
found they were dying out, she moved on,
looking for something new. She went to an
acting class in the American Conservatory
Theater: watching the actor's transforma
tion from a person to a character moved
her.
Smith became an actress. While teach
ing drama in New York, she began to walk
around the city with her tape recorder to
interview people. She brought something
new to the classroom, recorded rhythms in
language and in turn created an original
form of theater.
Years afterwards, she made "Fires in the
Mirror" by acting out the interviews she
recorded around New York City. The one
woman show described the Crown
Heights riots among African Americans
and Jewish Hasidim. During the show she
played Al Sharpton, a I.ubavitcher Rabbi, a
Jamaican New Yorker and so on. Jamie
Lyons said she could fit all of the props for
Smith's play in a suitcase.
"Fires in the Mirror" was a success. She

made a shortened video version of the
show for PBS, gave interviews to the
national press and began a more am
bitious project: representing the Los
Angeles riots.
Anna Deavere Smith continues to
receive press attention because she
presents drama differently from any
other writer or performer. Her plays
aren't tor people who like to dress up
in fancy clothes, sit in plush theaters
and be entertained by mostly white

characters. The African-American woman
presents drama as if it were a cross between
Sam Shephard and the MacNeil-Lehrer
News Hour.
Only a row of chairs decorate the stage

for "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992." A blank
screen hangs backstage. Smith stands tall,
her shoulder length, curly brown hair
pulled tight on her head. She wears black
trousers, an elegant white shirt and no
shoes. When the performance begins,
slides project the name, occupation and a

few words about the interview she is reen
acting. When she plays L.A.'s former police
chief who just couldn't get away from a
fund-raiser the night of the riots, the slide
reads "Daryl Gates/ Former Chief of Los
Angeles Police Department / 'It's Awful
1 lard to Break Away. Then she turns into
Keith Watson, one of Reginald Denny's as
sailants, or Angela King, Rodney King's
aunt. There is a little music, simple lighting
and a few video clips of the police beating
King or rioters destroying shops. Not ex
actly "Les Mis."
Her theater isn't only shocking. It makes

the audience look back at an event they saw
through the media and reexamine its ele
ments through the stories of its partici
pants. In order for Smith to create such a
theatrical experience, she had to work
against the tradition of psychological real
ism, or method acting, in the academy and
theater. She had to challenge the narcis
sism and limitations of conventional
drama before she could create a theater
that was socially engaged and not egocen
tric.
"/ knew that the oppression I felt about
psychological realism wasn't just this thing
that it makes you so self-interested — when
it's poorly rendered. Hut also that it was a
limit in form."
Smith argued that method acting locks
identity into place instead of letting it

breathe and trans
form, like it does in
real life. Method act
ing and psychological
realism require an
actor or actress to
look inside them
selves and build a
character through
their experiences.
This can become a
narcissistic exercise
too easily, Smith said.
The method tech
nique became popu
lar as Freud's theory
of psychoanalysis
made its way through
Europe in the late
19th century. Both re
quire actors and ana
lysts to look deep in
side a subject. They

must dredge emotion and realization from
their psyche in order to interpret a dream
or create an authentic-feeling character.
This European method became the
mainstay of Western theater and a tradi
tion of the institution. American theater,
Smith argued, is therefore stuck in a dra
matic theory which is entertaining hut not
expansive.
"Psychological realism was limited, I
thought, in terms ol form," she said.
"You're stuck in reality. You're stuck in
this," she hit the desk, papers, pens and
chair with her hands.
"I had .1 problem to solve. It I felt this
method, the way it was being rendered, was
limited, then I better start coming up with
something else."
She challenged what we think of as a
fated identity — something fixed by psy
chological realism — with a tape recorder
and New York dialectic.
Despite her university affiliations,
Smith decided that she couldn't justify
spending her career looking into herself for
a psychological connection to a character.
She had to look outside, at the other, as she
called it, for rhythms in language. This
forced her to leave the academy and create
for herself. But she didn't fight her acting
teachers when they told her that her pri
vate thoughts on drama weren't true to
convention.
"I just went the other way."
Eventually she created a style which is
bare, direct and evocative. The stage be
came a space for her to frustrate identity,
unfurl discussions of race in America and
perform the rhythm of voice.
"She calls it putting herself in the shoes
of another," said Charles Lyons, t he chair of
the 1 )rama 1 )epartment. "But it's not a psy
chological identification."
It's a cultural transformation. It sets her
in the location, mannerisms and speech of
the subject, he said. Instead of identifying
with the soul of one of her subjects, she
shows the audience where the person
comes from, what they do, how they speak
and what they feel. When we talked in his
office, Lyons swept the room with adula
tion.
"Nobody is doing what Anna is doing. I

think she's the most important
person in American theater right
now. She's changing the whole no
tion of what acting means."
Smith denied that her race has
anything to do with her alternate
take on American drama, what
Lyons called a cultural identifica
tion. Her family and childhood,
Smith ventured, had more to do
with her perspective than the color
ofher skin.
She is the oldest of five. I as
sumed that she had to struggle for
attention in a crowded house of
eager children but I guessed
wrong. In truth, she said she abdi
cated attention to her younger
brother who was lighter-skinned
than she was. Just as she walked
away from the ensconced morals of
theater and created a new form of
acting, she didn't compete in her
family for the attention an oldest
child usually receives.
"I had a brother who got a lot of
attention from when we were very
little, because he was the second
child. Next in line. He had blond
hair and blue eyes. He was a pretty

person, very pretty. People would stop my
mother in the street and say,'(iod, where'd
you get that pretty little boy?' "
She gave him her role of first born, "the
throne," she called it, instead of fighting
for attention.
"Giving him the throne freed me. It
made him the person in the family who
was almost more like the oldest than me. It
therefore, in some ways, relieved me ot a
great responsibility."
This transformation from the oldest
child to just another girl in the house al
lowed her to change herself without de
manding a confrontation from her family.
Her rebellion to traditional acting worked
much the same way.
She said she is not a confrontational
person.
"I find if I'm with a person now who
needs a lot of attention, go right ahead. In
conversation, I 'm not going to compete for
it."

Ironically, her theater and her acting
confronts much of what it is accepted
dogma in American drama, something
Lyons is pleased to see challenged. Smith is
on a quest for American character that ex
poses the weakness of traditional theater,
and gives the human stories she collects a
voice they would have never had on stage.
She stood in the middle of a circle of stu
dents in an all-black studio in the Drama
building. "I'm trying to find beautiful lan
guage," she told her "Interviewing Tech
niques" class. "Indeed, I will go to the end
of the Karth to find somebody to talk to
me."
