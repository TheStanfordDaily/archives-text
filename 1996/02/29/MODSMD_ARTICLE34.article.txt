## THE 						BOGMEN 
### 
Life Begins At
40 Million

There aren't many things in this world
that are fun, annoying, ridiculous and seri
ous — all at the same time. One of them
would be Bob Dole, another would be the
Bogmen and their new CD, "l ife Begins at 40
Million."
Kicking off the CD is the cheesy, (Chinese
musical intro " The Big Burn." Listening to
this song, 1 found myself hard-pressed not to
toss the album into the circular file. Playful
lyrics, half-serious instrumentals, babyish
blips and bleeps characterize this track. But
looking deeper into their songs, I realized
that the Bogmen's carefree, folkish quality is
what makes them such a hit.
Vocalist Bill Campion's zany vocals and
the band's spontaneous yet fluid guitars and
keyboards make the Bogmen the perfect ac
companiment to any frat beer-fest. On
"What's Behind Your Coat," Bill Campion
epitomizes a possible frat mantra, "All work,
no play / you people are all fuckin' crazy."
In addition to straightforward, Lpicurean
lyrics, the Bogmen also delve deep into the ir
rational and perverse. On "Dr. Jerome," the
psychiatrist boldly asks a depressed patient,
"Did you learn to take a shit right? / Did you
always wear your pants too tight? / Was it in
subordination? / An Oedipus relation?"
Aside from questioning the normal by re
sponding with the perverse, the Bogmen ac
tually attempt to preach important issues. In
"The Big Burn," they draw attention to hu
manity's abuse of the environment while on
"Piss Tongue" they decry the ineffectiveness
ofthe 112 irst Amendment. The Bogmen'scom
ical yet potent lyrics in addition to their
cheerful sound allow them to approach im
portant topics without sounding grudging or
evangelistic.

This album is also an enhanced CD — it
contains a special multimedia presentation
for either an IBM or Macintosh equipped
with a CD-ROM drive.
They are a far cry from your traditional
Smashing Pumpkins or Live imitator. If the
Bogmen could be compared to anything, the
closest comparison might be with They
Might Be Giants. Wacky lyrics, carefree but
spiritual tunes, and playful instrumental set
the tone for the Bogmen. At first, their absur
dity makes it hard for you to take them seri
ously, but after a few spins, you just can't stop
humming their catchy times.
