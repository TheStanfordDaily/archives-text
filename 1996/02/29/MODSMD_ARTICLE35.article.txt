# SILKWORM
## 
### 
Firewater

"On a raft made out of rotten sticks" and
"caught on a sea of bad risks," Silkworm sing
songs about situations that are just barely not
too hopeless to care deeply about — which
may sound like a bummer but isn't quite.
When they can't get what they want, Silk
worm focus on the appetite more than the
emptiness, the want instead of the lack. So
when they "thank God for relentless thirst,"
it's probably a good thing; Silkworm's "Fire
water" is as refreshing as it is morose, with a
compelling spirit that twists the group into
the clever antithesis of the self-pitying slack
er-type.
That said, "Firewater" — the group's
fourth album and first on Matador Records
— is a thoroughly unique and ambitious
work, from its 16-song length to its musical
and lyrical intricacies to its abandonment of
indie-rock's stylishly "cool" sense of emo
tional distance. Other bands can wear non
chalant smirks, but Silkworm don't pretend
they don't care, because they clearly do. As far
as attitude, they have more in common with
the no-nonsense approach of "Beaster"-era
Sugar than the "tricks are everything" style of

Pavement.
Tracks like "Wet Firecracker," "Quick
sand" and especially "Drag the River" prove
that the guitar-bass-drums trio of Tim
Midgett, Andy Cohen and Michael Dahlquist
are as tight a three-piece as you'll find, while
"Drunk," "Killing My Ass" and, again, "Drag
the River" show that they don't let their noise
stand in the way of perfect pop songs. Of
course, it also doesn't hurt that they recorded
"Firewater" with Steve Albini, the Big Black /
Shellac guy who has recorded albums for the
l'ixies, Nirvana, Slint and many others. It's
Albini's style not to smooth out any rough
edges, and so "Firewater" 's tumult jerks and
wrenches in all the ways it's supposed to.
If there's a drawback here, it's the slow
stuff: "Slow Hands" and "Don't Make Plans
This Friday" lack the group's usual energy
and force attention toward awkwardly
strained vocal parts (At their worst, think a
less annoying Adam Duritz). Still, even the
imperfect vocals have a point — reminding
us that these guys aren't tit to be rock guys —
and this just makes their downcast anthems
all the more hard-hitting. With all their pop
smarts, Silkworm are plenty familiar with the
"candy coating on the bitterest pill;" but they
still suck hard enough to get at what's at the
core.
