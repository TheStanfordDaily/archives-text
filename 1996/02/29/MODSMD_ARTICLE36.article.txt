Wither Blister Burn &
Peei

Stabbing Westward has nothing to do with
the O.J. Simpson double murder, but they
definitely slash their way through some blis
tering, explosive rock on their newest album,
"Wither Blister Burn & Peel." With over a
decades worth of experience, Stabbing West
ward jolted the music industry in 1994 with
their gritty rhythms and hell-raising vocals
epitomized on their major label debut,
"Ungod."
In "Ungod," vocalist Christopher Hall's
wild, unrelenting shriek flooded Stabbing

cannon fodder for the Hollywood club cul

things have gone right as the vocals take the
back seat, while the instrumentals drive
through some of the most unique and cre

me / This is where it falls apart." The band
backs this idea quite successfully by having
furious guitars and riveting keyboards crush

most-unintelligible shriek tears your brain
apart — making you feel lonely and helpless.
Meanwhile, "Inside You" sounds like it
missed the cuts for Nine Inch Nails', "The
Downward Spiral." Mystical yet gentle key
boards start the song, and Hall's eerie, brood
ing vocals tiptoe softly in the background.
The tempo and volume gradually increase
before Hall closes the song with an unearthly
screech, augmented by a chaotic clashing of
guitars and keyboards.
Unfortunately, many of the songs are pat-
