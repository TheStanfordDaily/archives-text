# STABBING WESTWARD
## 
### 
Wither Blister Burn &
Peei

Stabbing Westward has nothing to do with
the O.J. Simpson double murder, but they
definitely slash their way through some blis
tering, explosive rock on their newest album,
"Wither Blister Burn & Peel." With over a
decades worth of experience, Stabbing West
ward jolted the music industry in 1994 with
their gritty rhythms and hell-raising vocals
epitomized on their major label debut,
"Ungod."
In "Ungod," vocalist Christopher Hall's
wild, unrelenting shriek flooded Stabbing
Westward's mediocre instrumentals and

placed them in industrial music's no-man's
land — far from landing a spot on Rolling
Stone's cover and too developed to be just
cannon fodder for the Hollywood club cul
ture. But this time around, it seems as if
things have gone right as the vocals take the
back seat, while the instrumentals drive
through some of the most unique and cre
ative soundscapes.
Like most industrial rock albums, Hall
voices the frustrations of today's youth. On
"Crushing Me," Hall laments, "1 feel helpless
as my everything / Comes crushing down on
me / This is where it falls apart." The band
backs this idea quite successfully by having
furious guitars and riveting keyboards crush
ing down upon you while Hall's loud, al
most-unintelligible shriek tears your brain
apart — making you feel lonely and helpless.
Meanwhile, "Inside You" sounds like it
missed the cuts for Nine Inch Nails', "The
Downward Spiral." Mystical yet gentle key
boards start the song, and Hall's eerie, brood
ing vocals tiptoe softly in the background.
The tempo and volume gradually increase
before Hall closes the song with an unearthly
screech, augmented by a chaotic clashing of
guitars and keyboards.
Unfortunately, many of the songs are pat-

terned on "Inside You" 's musical founda
tions. Soft, eerie vocals and meandering,
mid-tempo instrumentals characterize near
ly every song on the album, lust as the song
begins to accelerate and introduce a new idea,
it abruptly ends, unfinished and unfulfilled.
With Ministry's recent release failing to
satisfy mainstream's crave for music's "key
hoards on drugs," Stabbing Westward is get
ting some heavy rotation on local radio sta
tions. It would be sheer ignorance not to call
them imitators of industrial supergroup
Nine Inch Nails. Stabbing Westward may lack
the energy and aggression NIN embodies,
but they certainly seem to be trying to imitate
NlN's experimental soundscapes and
Reznor's celebrated rant.
But, there is hardly anything in modern
day music that isn't derived from something
else. Pearl Jam ripped off Jimi Hendrix's clas
sic riffs, and Oasis stole the soul and style of
the Beatles. As long as you can mosh to it,
who cares where it came from?
