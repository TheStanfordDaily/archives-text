Lucky

Hey — whatever happened to I ace to
I ace? What about Jawbreaker or the Dance
1 kill Crashers or the Muffs? A year ago, some
guy from the Offspring was proclaiming
punk the "alternative to alternative," the
major labels were signing up pop-punk
bands by the handful and everybody was pre
dicting punk's imminent conquest of the
mainstream.
Today, except for one or two major excep
tions, the post-Green Day "punk renaissance"
has almost completely failed to materialize. It's
almost like the bands and labels are following a
script: "promising, talented young punk band
signs to a major label amid much hoopla, gets
commerciallyund critically ignored, and drops
out of sight". So what happened to the "punk

revolution?" "Lucky," yet another less-than
impressive major-label debut from yet another
young, talented band, the Goops, may shed a
little light on the subject.
As any jazz snob will tell you, there isn't
much to punk, musically speaking. Its power
and appeal have always had less to do with its
musical structure than with its raw energy
and intensity. Somehow, the producers of

"Lucky" missed that
simple lesson. This
album has the kind of
impeccable produc
tion that only a major
label budget can pro
vide, and that ends up
robbing the ( loops of
most of their intensity.
There's no denying
that lead vocalist
Eleanor Whit ledge
can sing — this gal
has some pipes. But
the way she's recorded
here often makes her
sound artificial and
over-rehearsed, like
"Janis Joplin-by
numbers." The rest of
the band suffers from
overproduction as
well. Deprived of

their live energy, the
guitars sound repetitive and mechanical,
while the drums — left in the background
quickly become a monotonous thud.
There's no doubt that the (loops can put to
gether nice songs: given a chance, tracks like
"One Kiss Left" and "Where The Wild
Things Roam" would probably have rocked.
But they never get that chance here.
It's probably no coincidence that Ran
cid, NOFX and the Offspring, the only
other "punk" bands to have any kind of im
pact on the mainstream, have remained on
the indie label Epitaph, where label-mogul
Brett Gurewitz has been recording punk
since 1981. With so much experience,

Gurewitz knows punk's real appeal and has
some idea of how to preserve that appeal in
a studio setting. Until the major labels
learn those lessons, however, most bands
that choose to enter the "big leagues" will
probably end up following the same igno
minious path downward as the Smoking
Popes. Who? Exactly . . .
