# SPINANES
## 
### 
Strand

It has been way too long since the Spinanes
have released a new album, but the Northwest
duo has learned some new tricks that make the
wait worthwhile. While the band's fresh-as
evcr 1993 debut, "Manos," powers through on
the force of unrelenting energy and unblink
ing emotion, the follow-up "Strand" nudges
ahead with subtlety and savvy.
On "Strand," guitarist / vocalist Rebecca
Gates and drummer Scott Plouf fine-tune
their act without compromising the instinctu
al sound of uncanny indie-esque rock. The
new bunch of songs tone down the head-rush
frenzy of the winners on "Manos," smoothing
out the kinks while maintaining just enough
of the endearing edginess.
"Lines and Lines" goes a step beyond any
thing on "Manos," getting past innate ability
by converting it into deft skill. Gates and Plouf
guide the song on its natural course, allowing
the roller coaster dynamics to How easily, yet
never losing control of them. Plouf sets the
galloping pace, as Gates' innovative guitar
meanders between the slip-slide twang of the
introduction and thick-and-heavy strum
ming. "Oceanwide" may be an even more
complete indie-rock mantra: for a five
minute stretch, Gates takes on rhythm and
lead guitar parts all at once, keeping the beat
with a sparkling march-time jangle or a
melodic, hard-core groove, where Plouf
traces Gates with bottom-heavy drum-work
to create a bounding undercurrent that needs
no bass.
Goupled with clearer, more spacious com
positions, the improved technique makes a
palpable mark in expression. Where Gates
sounds as if she's hiding her thoughts in the
chaotic bliss of "Manos," the open mix of
"Strand" puts her musings on the line. She is

now the confidant in addition to the self-con
scious introvert, promising, "I won't tell any
body / Sweet confession," on the stately
"Azure." The vocals ring crisply and truly on
"Lines and Lines," as Gates croons her wry,
heart-felt sentiments, like "Tell you I miss
you/There's no one else I'm dreaming of,"
without flinching.
Such a level of frank intensity and thought
ful concentration is difficult to maintain
through a whole album, and a couple of tracks
on "Strand" fall through the cracks. Though
the atmospheric "Punch Line Loser" is fasci
nating in stretches, it dragsa bit, nearly refined
out of existence; the poppy closer "For No One
Klse" comes off uncharacteristically sloppy, a
tossed-oflf effort marred by silly chatter in the
background. Perhaps a lesser band could get
away with almost wasting a track, but not the
Spinanes, if only because the twosome makes
the most of its opportunities.
