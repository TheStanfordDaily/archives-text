# MARTA MARTA

lust imagine Tori Amos' poignant lyrics
and Melissa Etheridge's rock influences and
you'll have a good idea of Marta Marta's
sound. In their self-titled debut album,
Marta Marta show exactly why they're such a
hit in their home country of Denmark.
Originally a Copenhagen punk band,
Marta Marta were heavily influenced by mu
sicians such as lggy Fop, Lou Reed, David
Bowie and the Rolling Stones. However, with
the inclusion of beautiful, soothing melodies
and starkly honest lyrics, the all-female band of
Anne Vig Skoven (guitar), Use (babble (lead vo
cals and guitar), Mette Mathiesen (drums),
Minna Gross (keyboards) and Lene Frickson
(bass), add more variety in their musical style.
For example, in this album, happy little ditties
such as "Biting Heads Off Chicken" are bal
anced with profound ballads like "Sleep With
out You" and "It's Real."
Main songwriter Cabbie tries to incorporate
wry humor in all her songs. This is illustrated in
"Spin and Spin," where Cabbie writes "I'll be
your home / I'll be your wine / lust close your
eyes and enjoy the show." Of course, all these
melancholy lyrics are accompanied by flowing
rhythms and catchy tunes.
With the addition of a keyboard in their
music, Marta Marta truly have an unique
sound. At times, the music is soft, lulling. But
the mood can suddenly shift in the next track
with a cynical, cheery tune that is at odds with
the lyrics sung. For instance, in "Turn The
Tide," Cabbie exclaims in a quasi-peppy tone
"And what a fool I've been!"
This band also does an excellent job explor
ing human thoughts and feelings. In the first
track "Tango," the group frustratingly shares
that "there's a tango in my head." And in "Sleep
Without You," Cabbie gives some insight on the
connection of pain and love in human relation
ships. Of course, catchy tunes continually ac
company the smartly-written lyrics.
Marta Marta feel that their music is "about
intensity and emotions," which is seen in their
partiality to the motif of rain / darkness / pain.
Since this is the case, I think this band will fit in
just fine in the U.S. alternative / rock scene. Eu
rope has already seen what a talent Marta Marta
is ... now it's our tune. They are definitely
worth your time and money!
