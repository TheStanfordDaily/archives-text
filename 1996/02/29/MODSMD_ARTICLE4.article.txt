Stanford football place-kicker Eric
Abrams allegedly solicited fully nude pho
tographs of a Santa Clara high school stu
dent in various poses using the identities
of at least four other Stanford football
players, the alleged victim's lawyer told
The Daily yesterday.
Patrick R. McMahon, the juvenile vic
tim's attorney, said the suspect — whom
postal authorities and high school officials
identified as Abrams — allegedly asked
for more than 17 different types of nude
or semi-nude pictures from the victim.
"He wanted nude pictures and got spe
cific," McMahon said. "He definitely

wanted the genitalia."
It was not until Abrams allegedly gave
the victim his post office box number that
police realized he was their suspect, a
source close to the case said.
Some of the players were informed by
the University on Tuesday that their
names were involved, according to a
source.
Abrams is currently under investiga
tion by Santa Clara police for allegedly so
liciting explicit photographs from a Santa
Clara high school football player and at
least one other victim, sources have said.
Abrams may face charges of either sex
ual harassment or phone harassment for
the alleged solicitation, sources said.
Postal inspectors have told investigators

that no federal charges are being consid
ered, those sources said yesterday.
Abrams' lawyer condemned the allega
tions against his client in a statement yes
terday, implying that the incident was a
prank.
Thomas Nolan, a lawyer representing
Abrams, said in a statement that "there is
an entirely different side to this story.
"We are working closely with the in
vestigators and the District Attorney's
Office to help them fully understand the
events," the statement said. "The fact
that pranks can be carried too far is a con
cern to us all.
"Once all the facts become known, it
will become apparent to all that
there was no sexual misconduct,"
the statement said.
Police said media coverage of the
incident could push forward the
date when Abrams will be charged.
"Due to the controversy created
by the story, we and the district at
torney will be meeting on a more
frequent basis," Santa Clara Police
Sgt. Mark Kerby said.
But Jack Marshall, chief trial
deputy for the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's Office, said he
will not take action until he receives
the completed investigation from
Santa Clara police.
"Time is not important in this
case," Marshall said. "No one is in
danger, at least not that I know of."
In response to insinuations by
Abrams' attorney that the incident
was a prank, Marshall said the re
action was expected. "In his own in
vestigation he is getting a slant on it
that usually differs from other per
spectives," he said.
The case is taking more time to
bring to court because of its unique
ness, Marshall said. "From what
I've learned from the Santa Clara
Police Department, it's sort of an
odd-duck type of case," he said.
"It's not something we're used to
seeing. Right now it looks like a lit
tle difficult to categorize."
Abrams' family members con
tinued their silence yesterday.
When Jeffrey Abrams, Eric's fa
ther, was visited at his San Diego
home and asked about Eric's
whereabouts, he said, "I can't talk
about this."

In earlier contacts with the vic
tim, Abrams allegedly asked that
the photographs be mailed to the
Department of Athletics under the
names of different members of the
football team, McMahon said.
Each football player has his own
mailing address at the team's office
in the Arrillaga Family Sports Cen
ter. The boxes are sorted by the first
letter of the players' last names,
said Gary Migdol, the Athletics De
partment's senior media relations
director.
When packages arrive, they lire
placed in boxes which have no locks
and are accessible by any football
player. In the event that the pack
age is larger than the box, it is
sometimes placed in front or next to
the box.
Consequently, it is possible that
an athlete can send mail to any
other teammate and still pick it up
unnoticed, sources said.
Abrams allegedly identified him
self as a Stanford football recruiter
using another football player's
name on Dec. 9 and promised the
victim a career in Stanford football,
McMahon said.
The suspect allegedly asked for
photos from the waist down, from
the waist down from the back side
and from the knees to the chest, ac
cording to McMahon. He said the
suspect told the youth that he was
interested in him as a possible Stan
ford prospect and wanted "to know
about his health."
Each of the specific poses was re
quested in the original call, he
added.
For the first few calls, Abrams
allegedly asked that the packages
be mailed to the Athletics Depart
ment under the names of three cur
rent football players, one fifth-year

player who graduated after last
quarter and a former football play
er.
Once police were contacted by
Wilcox High School football coach
Eric Volta, they began tapping the
phone line to determine the voice of
the suspect, police said.
"When the victim made the ini
tial police report, he was not exact
ly sure of who he was dealing with
at Stanford," Kerby said.
The Athletics Department was
contacted and told of the allega
tions against one of its athletes and
at that point, sources said, the Uni
versity began its investigation.
Police had no information on the
suspect's identity while he was re
questing that the mail be delivered
to the Athletics Department, a
source close to the case said.
"It was too convoluted," the
source said. However, the sting op
eration to arrest the unknown sus
pect was already in the planning
stages, according to the source.
When Abrams allegedly left his
post office box number instead of
the Athletics Department address,
police closed in.
The investigators decided to
mail the package by registered mail
so the suspect would have to sign
for it at the window, The Daily has
learned. Postal inspectors, Stan
ford Police and Santa Clara officers
were all on hand to make the arrest.
Some of the football players
whose names were allegedly used
met with Jim Larimore, a special
assistant to Dean of Students Marc
Wais, who this year has officiated
judicial affairs cases, a source close
to the University said. The players
were then informed Abrams had al
legedly used their names as Stan
ford football officials, according to

the source.
The players whose names
Abrams allegedly used were not
close to Abrams, the source said.
Larimore, however, said yester
day he could not confirm or deny
his involvement in the case, citing
confidentiality concerns.
Football Coach Tyrone Willing
ham has declined to comment until
a more appropriate time, Athletics
Department officials said. Migdol
said Willingham will likely com
ment if charges are filed.
Other football players are also
declining to comment at this time.
"We can't comment until (Willing
ham] does," running back Anthony
Bookman said.
Willingham met with the team
yesterday to inform them of the in
cident. Anyone who has completed
their college eligibility — most se
niors — are not considered mem
bers of the team and did not attend.
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbar
do, Abrams' departmental adviser,
said yesterday he sympathized with
Abrams, adding that the investiga
tion would only add to Abrams'
emotional stress. Abrams' father is
fighting cancer, and Abrams has
periodically been traveling to San
Diego to be with his family, accord
ing to Zimbardo.
"I can imagine he's very dis
tressed," Zimbardo said. "He's al
ways been a fine sport and a reliable
student."
News of Abrams' alleged in
volvement in the case did not reach
the San Diego area until late last
night.
