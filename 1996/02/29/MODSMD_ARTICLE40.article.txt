## Unforgettable 
### 
Death doesn't guarantee silence when su
ence intervenes and secrets left in the grave
resurface.
Unflinching brutality is interpreted as a vi
sual medley in "Unforgettable," directed by
John Dahl ("The l ast Seduction" and "Red
Rock West"). Luckily, the eyes will not flinch
from the screen. In this film, memories pre
served in cerebral spinal fluid are extracted
and reenacted via a top-secret experimental
serum. Dahl turns another thriller/gut -spiller
into a series of vivid images pieced together
with a murder twist that keeps the suspense on
full tilt.
Ray Liotta's Dr. David Krane, a forensics
pathologist, has been accused of killing his
wife. The case is dismissed on a technicality,
something David can't live with until he
meets Linda liorentino, who uncharacteristi
cally plays a demure and awkward Dr. Martha
Ikiggs. It's Martha's formula that David is
after. After he's gotten it, he stops at nothing
to solve the mystery of his wife's murder,
l iorentino is able to make the most out of a
weak supporting role as a convincing sidekick

who trails Liotta as both her subject and
friend.
Liotta drives this film forward with his de
piction of a relentless doctor, husband and fa
ther who believes with chilling intensity that
the end justifies the means. With each injec
tion, he receives the memories of each corpse,
sometimes even their abilities.
Liotta is thoroughly convincing as a man
possessed. He uses every ounce of cunning,
manipulation and stamina he has to get to
the truth, despite the strain he is causing to
bis mind and body. He goes so tar as to use
his forensics tools to pick locks to the crime
scenes, where he needs to be for external
stimuli to jump start the formula. The pace
is kept tight thanks to the single-mindedness
of Liotta's mission.
Although the people in front of the cam
era are billed as the stars, it is the work be
hind the camera that steals the scenes.
Dahl's camera plunges into memories
without hesitation, involving viewers in a
frenetic chase. His vision dominates this
stunning collage of perspectives, inter
twining the past with the present and cata
pulting to the future. His innovative inter
pretations of each distinct memory use an
array of different film techniques to keep

the viewer hooked.
Unfortunately, the anti-climatic ending
does no justice to Liotta and Dahl's talents.
The film should've ended with Liotta's last
memory transfer, an arresting barrage of
revelations that pick up all the missing

pieces. Instead, an ending inconsistent with
the rest of the film is the poor substitute, an
affront to the dead and living who have been
pulled together during this otherwise engag
ing experience.
