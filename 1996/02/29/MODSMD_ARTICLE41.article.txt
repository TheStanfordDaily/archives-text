# It's My Party
## 
### 
The opening sequence of too-good-to
be true scenes in the life of Nick (Kric
Roberts) and Brandon (Clregory Harrison)
doesn't leave the viewer guessing for long the
plot trajectory of "It's My Party": the perfect
couple, floating above the world on a chair
lift, celebrating a birthday with an extrava
gant party, riding horses to mountainous
heights, embracing passionately in a cloud
like bed.
When Nick comes home one day to an
nounce that he is HIV positive, the fabric of

the couple's dream life unravels before either
has time to comprehend what has happened
to their relationship of fifteen years.
A year after their separation, Nick finds
out that he has developed a highly degenera
tive brain disorder that will destroy his mind
and body, and end his life within a tew weeks.
While he knows that he has no choice but to
face death, Nick is also aware that there is
more than one way to go. Rather than relin
quishing his body to the merciless time clock
set by his illness, Nick decides to end his lite
the way he wants to: "Live fast, die young,
leave a good-looking corpse."
Although by the end of the movie most of
the audience was in tears, the film played for

over an hour before 1 began to feel for the
characters at all. The dialogue was trite and
predictable. As Monty (Bronson Pinchot)
says, "Way down deep, I'm very superficial."
Writer and director Randal Kleiser's dia
logue fails to draw the characters out beyond
the two-dimensional screen. At the same
time, he does effectively portray the tragic
paradox in the lives of Nick and his friends.
There is an overpowering concern for look
ing beautiful and achieving external perfec
tion: scenes portray Herculean bodies lifting
weights in a gym. At the same time, these
men are watching each other whither away
and die as the external armor is eaten from
within.

Unfortunately, Kleiser clutters his story
with overly pronounced metaphors: Nick
teaching Brandon how to ski as a parallel for
teaching him how to live.
Hut just as Nick's joking and nonchalance
about his imminent death have become un
bearable, his character is finally given a hint
of depth. When Monty, the acerbic jokester,
jests, "At least you haven't lost your sense of
humor," Nick adds with a defensive smile,
"The only part of my immune system that's
still working."
I wouldn't change the channel on "It's My
Party," but unless the six dollars is burning a
hole in your pocket, save it for another flick.
