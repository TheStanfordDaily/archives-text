# Mary Reilly
## 
### 
The dark and misty streets of 19th cen
tury Edinburgh, Scotland, do not seem to
be a fitting place for the often bubbly ac
tress Julia Roberts with her priceless smile
and contagious laugh. Most popular for
her all-American hits such as "Pretty
Woman" and "Steel Magnolias," some of
Roberts' latest dramatic efforts were not so
warmly received ("Ready to Wear," "I Love
Trouble").
In "Mary Reilly" however, Roberts ex
ceeds all expectations without flashing a
single smile (and with an effective Irish ac
cent to boot).
This visually and psychologically dark
film tells the story of the title character
(Roberts) who is the maidservant to Dr.
lekyll (portrayed by veteran man-of-evil
actor John Malkovich), the mad scientist
who discovers a way to free the dark side of
his soul in the form of Mr. Hyde. Mary,
abused as a child, finds security in her ser
vice to the kind Dr. lekvll. They fall in love
in an extremely subtle relationship until Mr.
Hyde enters the picture.

Watching this love triangle, the audience
feels as confused as Mary, in whom the un
derstanding of good and evil meshes togeth
er in a tangle, much like her feelings for the
two sides of the same man. Roberts uses a
meek demeanor communicated effectively
through large, uncertain eyes and timid
body language, as if expecting to be hurt at
any moment, much like the younger Mary
shown in disturbing flashback scenes of
abuse.
Always in absolute control of every as
pect of his performance, Malkovich takes
advantage of both the good and evil sides of
his character with meticulous care for de
tail, right down to the way each man walks.
The only thing overlooked is an accent. Not
once does he speak with one.
Glenn Close makes a terrific cameo ap
pearance as a bra/en boarding house / broth
el operator. Under a mask of "Sunset Boule
vard"-ish makeup, her voice is completely
unrecognizable. The only downside to her
performance is that you are so surprised
that the character is actually her, you're dis
tracted from her acting.
This movie prompts one nagging ques
tion: how in the world do Mary's flowers
grow when there is absolutely no sunshine?

The lack of light gives the period settings
and colorless costumes a completely de
pressing quality.
The pace of the movie, however, is sur
prisingly swift. With the artsy appearance of
a Merchant and Ivory film, you expect Hele
na Bonham Carter's pale face to appear and
for the events to unfold at a snail's pace.
Instead, we get a very pale (ulia Roberts
and, even though certain plot points are in
comprehensible at moments, things keep
moving.
The tension and mystery surrounding
Mary and Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde generates
plenty of suspense (although at times it
seems like the director lost confidence in
the film's suspense level and felt a need to
compensate with mist). However, the direc
tor succeeds with his claustrophobic shots
of Mr. Hyde's house, cramped laboratory
and the haunted, ghostly white face of
Roberts.
Excellent performances by the actors
make this movie worth watching, despite
the gruesome and hard-to-watch transfor
mation scene which is straight out of
"Aliens."
When watching "Mary Reilly," look past
the gore and dark settings, and expect a

worthwhile drama about the confusing na
ture of duality.
