## Bottle Rocket 
### 
You'll need to put all intellectual inclina
tions aside to enjoy "Bottle Rocket." This is
an unrealistic, exaggerated story about three
oddball losers: 20-something, mentally un
stable, going-nowhere-fast guys who turn to
a life of crime for the hell of it. Despite their
big talk about research and 50-year plans,
Dignan (Owen Wilson), Anthony (Luke Wil
son) and Bob (Robert Musgrave) are hilari
ously inept at their new hobby.
After their first zanv bookstore theft, An
thony finds romance with the only signifi
cant female character in this "guy flick," the
Spanish-speaking housekeeper at their hide
away hotel, Inez (Lumi Cavazos from "Like
Water for Chocolate"). The combination of
the language barrier and Anthony's dense
personality provides for a crazy situation and
hearty laughs.
The goofy story line includes some pleas
antly far-out leaps of logic: at one moment
1 )ignan and Anthony are stranded, penniless
outlaws with an old broken-down Fiat in the
middle of nowhere, throwing punches at
each other. In the next scene, Anthony is
doing odd manual labor jobs and coaching
little league soccer.
Of course, the good-guy life doesn't last
for long, and soon they have all reconvened
along with old-timer James Caan for another
criminal adventure.
More compelling than (but equally zany
as) the movie is the real-life story of the five

close buddies
whose original
directing, writing
and acting lead to
their rise to fame.
Owen Wilson,
co-writer, shared
the big screen
with brothers
Luke and An
drew, but years
ago they shared
oblivion and a
dinky apartment
in Texas along
with the other
supporting actor
Robert Musgrave
and director/co
writer Wes An
derson. The
clincher came
when a short film
they made with
the same name
showed at the
1993 Sundance
film festival and
was picked up by
director-produc-

er James Brooks. Brooks ("Terms of Endear
ment") got them a quick shoo-in at Colum
bia Pictures and the rest is history.
The acting is surprisingly well done, espe
cially by Owen Wilson, whose hot tempera
ment, far-fetched fantasies, quizzical expres
sions and unerring enthusiasm bears a strik

ing resemblance to my 6-year-old cousin.
Robert Musgrave is the perfect nervous rich
friend and Luke Wilson does a great frank,
straight-faced comic.
The cinematography is as down to earth as
the script is outlandish. It has a charming,
un Hollywood Brothers McMullen-ish qual
ity, which, coupled with the happy-go-lucky

jazzy grooves, complements the meandering
plot.
All in all, this is a short, silly spoof about
crime, romance and about our own too-seri
ous lives. If your brain needs a break, you can
leave it at the door and find relief in "Bottle
Rocket."
