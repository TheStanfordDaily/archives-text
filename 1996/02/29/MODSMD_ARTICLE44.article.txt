# Before and After
## 
### 
From the opening credits, it is obvious that
"Before and After" is not what it seems. Di
rector Barbel Schroeder's film opens in a

quiet, wintry Massachusetts
town, appropriate for a Currier
and Ives or Norman Rockwell
picture book complete with ice
fisherman, deer... and then an
outstretched, bloody arm.
Do not be deceived. Though
the television previews and ad
materials read: "A murder. A sus
pect. A shadow of a doubt," this
film is not really about murder or
a suspect. Nor is there a shadow
of doubt that Edward Furlong's
Jake Ryan has killed his girl
friend.
Before the murder, the Ryans
are a "normal" family. After the
murder, though the family is still
well knit, the movie falls apart.
Though the beginning is master
fully pieced together, Ted Tally's
screenplay, based on Rosellen
Brown's novel, is choppy and
trite in parts. At times it moves
too quickly and falls into pits of
emotional mushiness. It even
Haunts a token love scene that
simply is unconvincing.
However, Liam Neeson and
Meryl Strcep, arguably the two
finest actors alive, do save this
film. Though they fight well and

are a convincing parenting team, something
is missing in their romantic chemistry. Streep
is strong as (Carolyn Ryan, a mother and pedi
atrician with faith in both justice and her son.
Streep's emotions are channeled and effec
tive; as Neeson says, she makes scenes look
"absolutely effortless."

Liam Neeson's overalls-clad artist Ben
Ryan is physical, immense, fiery (yet gentle)
and neither completely lovable nor totally
reprehensible. Neeson is perfectly cast, prov
ing that he really can be any character from a
Nazi to a priest, from Rob Roy to Darkman.
His Ben does not disappoint.

Furlong's lake, though central to the plot,
seems separated emotionally from the story.
Furlong's creepy, pale skin and eerie facial ex
pressions are perfect for Jake. He neither
commands sympathy nor condemnation. |u
dith Ryan, Jake's little sister, is played by new
comer Julie Weldon with freshness and

spunk. However, she is
given a bit too much wis
dom for her age.
The fundamental conflict
in this film arises between
telling the truth for justice
and protecting your family
at all costs. In one scene,
Ben tells the biblical story
of Abraham's sacrifice of
Isaac, Abraham's willing
ness to kill his son for God.
Ben asks rhetorically -
who would want him for a
father? When is it okay to
break the law to help your
family?
"Before and After" is
worth it to watch Streep
and Neeson execute their
craft and struggle with the
above questions. However,
the film's message that life
can change in a second and
will never be the same
again could be a warning to
those looking for action,
murder or romance. For
those who want more than
a teary family drama, you
may not want to lose a sec
ond by watching this film.
