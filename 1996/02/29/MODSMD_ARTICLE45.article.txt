## Sam Park Realizing the "airy nothing" 
### 
Near the end of his theatrical career, Noel
Coward had such clout as a playwright
that be began to star in his own work.
Since he shared with his characters the same
glib, witty-n-worldly speech, all the lines
came naturally. Coward didn't need much
time working on character sketches; he just
had to look in the mirror during breaks.
I have no pretensions of coming anywhere
near the hem of Coward's garment, maybe
except to clean it. But as the writer of one of
this year's Original Winter One Acts, I can
understand why he might have felt com
pelled to play a part he'd written.
First, the writer gives much of his
thoughts and emotions to a character. Situa
tions are made up and characteristics invent
ed, but in the end characters inevitably take
on aspects of the writer's personality. They
talk the way he talks, down to the last syllable
and comma. In my case, though the story was
fiction, the use of language was not. One of
the lines, "I'm not bitter; I just happen to say
everything with a bitter inflection," was
something I'd actually said to a friend once.

So in theory, the ideal person to play the
part would be the playwright, who knows
every curve and nuance of the "Line." He
knows how it should be said: how loud, silly
or serious. In reality, however, things aren't
so simple. Put aside the fact that most play
wrights can't act and even if they did, they
would be wrong for the part (50-year-old
woman today, black teen tomorrow?). Be
cause really, the "Line" belongs to the actor,
regardless of who wrote it.
The actor brings his own experience and
imagination to the part, effectively creating a
character of his own. But first, like Theseus in
the labyrinth of the Minotaur, he has to find
his way through the lines. Lines can be de
ceptive, especially when there is sarcasm,
play-acting and exaggeration involved. The
tendency is toward realism, which was tricky
in a show like mine, where the main charac
ter is caught up in the unrealistic world of
movies.
The first time I met the lead actor cast in
the play, Ceorge, he asked me what I meant in
my script note by "this should be played for

laughs." Since the play had comedy and self
parody as its foundations, I became con
vinced that no one "got it." After a dry read
through, I asked my director with a dejected
face, "Do they know it's a comedy?" 1 was ex
pecting the worst. Until, that is, I saw the first
dress rehearsal three months later.
What I saw wasn't what I'd expected. It
was better. George had turned his character, a
self-absorbed, self-dramatizing showman
into someone human, deserving of sympathy
and love. I was transfixed. There were things
I'd have done differently, like play up some of
the silliness and "ham up" the stylized lines,
but for the most part, I wouldn't have
changed a thing.
I think what a good actor does is shape a
character using his own view of human na
ture, so that a compassionate actor will bring
heart into a part, whereas a dispassionate one
will embody emotional distance. In this play,
fortunately, the former happened.
Of course, the lines didn't come off with
the exact intonation and delivery as written,
and in a worst case scenario that would be

like Seinfeld telling Ellen Degeneres jokes.
(Comedy, after all, comes from a distinctive
"voice") But in sacrificing a punch line or
two, I got something much more rewarding
in the end: someone's entire life in one act,
complete with his emotional past and senso
ry present. The actor had brought his own
memory and understanding into the part.
The words were mine, but that glance, that
meaningful stare into the distance, out of the
black box and into a magic screen; those were
all his.
His character was an emotionally de
manding role: someone whose intimate fears
and desires were revealed in the play with
sometimes brutal and unexpected honesty.
When the play opened, "airy nothing" sud
denly received a "habitation and a name."
(Ah, Shakespeare.) Words became feelings,
jokes the code for a way of living and hopes
were scripted in facial lines and suppressed
sighs. In the audience, the language of appre
ciation was spoken through smiles and
laughter ... then I realized they were just
paying him back.
