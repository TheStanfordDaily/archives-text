# POP CULTCHAH ON STAGE
## 
### JEA GRAVES 
They Might Be Giants once sang that the
worlds a dress in which we warm ourselves.
If the world is a dress and a stage at the same
time, then senior Akin Salawifs "when
mama's black" is a show to wrap yourself in,
a chance to try on someone else's corner of
the fabric. His performance is a look through
a window that will end up feeling more like a
mirror.
"He's definitely trying to expose Stanford
to something it hasn't seen before," says
freshman Beth Alexander, one of the five
dancers in the production.
On stage is a gay black man who has been
forced to go on a talk show. His mother com
plains of his deviant behavior and his selfish
ness for throwing his homosexuality in her
face. A Sally Jessy Raphael runs forth in a
flushed attempt to solve the "problem."
"One taste of my daughter's golden cli
toris," Sally huffs, "will send you leaping
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed into the won
derful world of heterosexuality!"
The audience goes wild. During the si
lence after the applause, the gay man sneezes.
A white woman stands up and says, con
vinced, "You probably have AIDS!" The au
dience loves it."And," she says, "you're prob
ably the one who gave it to my son!"

Salawu, from New Jersey, has been doing
theater since he was 11, and has written and
acted in a number of shows here. "I probably
have never been more scared of or had more
invested in a show than this one, though," he
says. "It's a risky, risky show."
The show consists of fifteen vignettes that
are funny and touching and sad and angry.
Kach one is infused with a musical energy
and navigated by body language that comes
from the backup dancers and a soundtrack of
pop music including Janet Jackson, Madon
na and Des'ree. Salawu says the production
borrows aesthetically from the visual presen
tations of Madonna's concert shows, as well
as Janet Jackson's, with the combination of
dance, music and some kind of narrative.
"We're not doing the same thing as
Madonna, but I think she's pretty honest," he
says. "We're very blunt in parts of this show..
. what we borrow from Madonna is her atti
tude when she performs: here I am, love me
or fuck you."
Written, directed, produced and per
formed by Salawu, the show was first per
formed strictly as a one-person show. Salawu
says of that experience: "I felt very much like
it was a lecture. Now, the dancers create the
world of each of my characters. The show
would never work without them." Salawu's
dancers include Beth Alexander, Khanh
Doan, Shirra Graves, Kate Lowenhar and

Julie Tsai.
Senior Tsai says
Salawu's ability to
choose his own format
is, in fact, "one of the
highlights of college
artistic production ...
the artist can be very ex
perimental."
As a subtle departure
from the solo perfor
mance style of, say,
Anna Deveare Smith,
Salawu's work is quite
unconventional. Stage
manager Stacey Ben
nett, who has known
Salawu since his fresh
man year, says,"I always
enjoy Akin's work. His
style, in general, is dif
ferent and a lot more
original than what I've
seen done here at Stan
ford. He incorporates
music and dance as an
integral part of his sto
rytelling, which makes

it more interesting just to look at. He's giving
people a way to actually see what he's talking
about."
Perhaps that effect is just what gives this
show the feel of a celebration. While the is
sues are serious and heavy, Salawu adds a
light touch to them. "There are so many shit
is-fucked-up, go-home-and-go-to-bed
plays," says Salawu. "This is not that. This is
more, shit is fucked up, but..."
In the final scene Salawu finds refuge in

God, who is, in fact, a black woman. As she
reassures him, he looks to the audience,
nods and tells them "I'm gonna be O.K.
I'm gonna be 0.K." He walks offstage with
this chant. The dancers follow. The lights
go down. Des'ree's "You Gotta Be" plays
quietly as if only in the back of his head.
The stage, the place where mainstream
America has had its way with him, is now
empty.
"It's gonna be 0.K."
