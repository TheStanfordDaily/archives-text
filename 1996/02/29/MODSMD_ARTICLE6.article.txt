# Terman Fellows selected

Six of the University's most
promising young scientists have
been named Terman Fellows as
part of a program to honor the
work of junior faculty.
The fellowships were estab
lished by a $25 million grant from
Stanford alumni William Hewlett
and David Packard, the founders of
computer giant Hewlett Packard
Co.
The six new Terman Fellows,
the second set to be named since
the program was founded in 1994,
are all assistant professors. They
are Barbara Block of the Hopkins
Marine Station, Kenneth Goodson
of mechanical engineering, John
Griffin of chemistry, Jun Liu of sta
tistics, Alfred Spormann of civil en
gineering and Jennifer Widom of
computer science and electrical en
gineering.
A Terman Fellowship brings
with it an unrestricted grant of up
to $100,000 ayear for three years.
Asst. Provost Ann Fletcher said
recipients of the award are chosen
by the deans' offices of the School of
Engineering and the School of Hu
manities and Sciences.
Goodson's work has been in the
field of nanotechnology, the pro
duction of microscopic machines
with moving parts measuring one
hundredth the diameter of a
human hair. Goodson has found
ways to measure and control the
temperature of these tiny devices.
"All the things we do on a large
scale using heat need large tools,"
Goodson explained. He said is
working to find ways to apply any
industrial process involving heat
work, such as soldering, to very
small-scale operations. Such devel
opments have many applications in
biotechnology.
Although he is a professor of
civil engineering, Spormann said
he is "a microbiologist by training."
He works with bacteria, and much
of his work has been devoted to bac
teria that can break down polluting
chemicals.
Spormann said chemicals some
times leak out of underground
gasoline tanks and get into the
water supply. Most methods of
breaking these chemicals down re
quire oxygen, which is scarce in un
derground water. There are bacte
ria, however, which can clean up
the water without oxygen. No one,
Spormann said, knows exactly how
they do this.
"We have to see how these bac
teria do us the favor of breaking

down these chemicals," Spormann
said. He also said he is working on
examining how bacteria move in
environments without water,
which has implications for the way
the body's cells generate the force
to make muscles move.
The field of information tech
nology is represented by Widom.
She develops ways for someone to
easily access databases that may
not be compatible with his or her
computer or with each other.
Programs like "Web crawlers"
that help people find their way
around the Internet are a simple
example of the kind of programs
she designs.
Liu designs computer models
that need to incorporate a random
element, such as models predicting
the movement of gas molecules or
making forecasts of economic sys
tems. Liu said these simulations in
volve functions that do not have so
lutions that can be calculated ana
lytically.
Block is studying new ways to
tag and monitor open-ocean fishes.
Griffin is working on ways to pro
duce antibiotics that can be used in
smaller amounts so they can main
tain their effectiveness longer.
