Six of the University's most
promising young scientists have
been named Terman Fellows as
part of a program to honor the
work of junior faculty.
The fellowships were estab

Stanford alumni William Hewlett
and David Packard, the founders of
computer giant Hewlett Packard
Co.
The six new Terman Fellows,
the second set to be named since
the program was founded in 1994,
are all assistant professors. They
are Barbara Block of the Hopkins
Marine Station, Kenneth Goodson
of mechanical engineering, John
Griffin of chemistry, Jun Liu of sta

computer science and electrical en

A Terman Fellowship brings
with it an unrestricted grant of up

Asst. Provost Ann Fletcher said
recipients of the award are chosen
by the deans' offices of the School of
Engineering and the School of Hu

Goodson's work has been in the
field of nanotechnology, the pro

with moving parts measuring one

human hair. Goodson has found
ways to measure and control the
temperature of these tiny devices.
