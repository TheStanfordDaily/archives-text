The man who used to run the
largest school system in the coun
try gave a speech yesterday in
which he shared his vision of how
communities and schools should
work together to improve each
other.
Ramon Cortines, who was
chancellor of schools in New York
City from 1993 to 1995 and is now
a visiting scholar at the School of
Education, named "civic capacity"
as the theme of his address.
He defined this as the "moral
imperative and civic duty" to reject
easy solutions to complex prob
lems and concentrate instead on
the basic question of how to give
students not only knowledge but
"a purpose in life."
The way Cortines sees to create
this sense of purpose is heavily re

lated to involving communities in
schools, something he feels is not
done enough. He said educators
are not always as willing as they
should be to bring parents into the
educational process.
"Teachers are fearful because
[involving parents] is not pre
dictable," Cortines said. "It
shouldn't have to be predictable."
He added that in the future,
teachers will need to be more will
ing to participate in a two-way
learning process, and that teach
ers, students, administrators and
parents should all be willing to
"question and learn from one an
other."
One of the keys to Cortines' vi
sion is "authentic collaboration"
between educational researchers
at universities and teachers in
classrooms.
