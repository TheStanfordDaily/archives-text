The man who used to run the
largest school system in the coun
try gave a speech yesterday in
which he shared his vision of how
communities and schools should
work together to improve each
other.
Ramon Cortines, who was
chancellor of schools in New York
City from 1993 to 1995 and is now
a visiting scholar at the School of
Education, named "civic capacity"
as the theme of his address.
He defined this as the "moral
imperative and civic duty" to reject
easy solutions to complex prob
lems and concentrate instead on
the basic question of how to give
students not only knowledge but
"a purpose in life."
The way Cortines sees to create
this sense of purpose is heavily re

lated to involving communities in
schools, something he feels is not
done enough. He said educators
are not always as willing as they
should be to bring parents into the
educational process.
"Teachers are fearful because
[involving parents] is not pre
dictable," Cortines said. "It
shouldn't have to be predictable."
He added that in the future,
teachers will need to be more will
ing to participate in a two-way
learning process, and that teach
ers, students, administrators and
parents should all be willing to
"question and learn from one an
other."
One of the keys to Cortines' vi
sion is "authentic collaboration"
between educational researchers
at universities and teachers in
classrooms.
He brought up many successful
examples of schoolteachers and
academia working together. He
talked about New York University's
coming in "as an equal partner" in
redesigning special education in
New York City. He also pointed out
several professors in the audience
with whom he had worked when he
was superintendent of schools in
San Francisco and San Jose.
He continued to lay out his ideas
of "civic capacity," relating these
ideas to national issues.
Replying to a question about
racial integration, Cortines criti
cized court-ordered desegregation
because in his experience it leaves
communities feeling like they
haven't been consulted.
Cortines supported the idea of a
national curriculum, although he
preferred to call it a "standard"
and said its purpose should be to

ensure that poor and minority stu
dents do not receive a subpar edu
cation.
Speaking on the movement to
make English the national lan
guage, Cortines defended bilingual
education but also said that one
goal of bilingual education is to
teach English.
He added that when he was su
perintendent of schools in San Jose
he monitored the bilingual pro
gram very closely and tried to en
sure that students did not spend
too many years in it.
Cortines said society must not
look to easy solutions that concen
trate too little on real and complex
problems. He warned against
treating school privatization and
voucher programs as cure-alls,
saying such programs are often
"more concerned with form than
substance."
Cort ines finished by saying that
"the complexity of education . ..
demands that each of us in this
room find a way he or she can help
education."
