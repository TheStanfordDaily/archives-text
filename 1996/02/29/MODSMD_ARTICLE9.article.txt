# Forum looks at women's safety issues

### Amy Slucter Staff writer 
Women's safety issues were discussed by a
panel of students and staff members at the Fire
Truck House last night.
Participants in the forum, which was spon
sored by the Women's Center Advisory Board,
considered the safety services available for
women on campus and determined which pro
grams need to be improved.
Participants examined a variety of issues, in
cluding campus lighting, parking, transporta
tion and women's self-defense classes. Some of
the first concerns raised by the students were lo
gistical.
"The area by the science quad is under con
struction, and there is relatively poor lighting,"
said graduate student Rebecca Wais. "When I
leave at night, I can barely see my car lock."
According to Julia Fremon, the manager of
campus transportation programs, the Universi
ty is studying what it can do to improve the
lighting situation. She explained that standards
for brighter lighting have been established for

all new fixtures. In addition, she indicated that
the University is looking for other ways to im
prove the safety of nighttime travel.

'We were caught in a
stranglehold.'

Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington said
the University will begin this process by in
stalling 15 to 18 emergency telephones on cam
pus. Herrington said the phones, to be marked
with blue lights, will be in place later this year.
Many women at the forum made it clear that
they feel self-defense instruction is an integral
part of women's safety. Stanford does not cur
rently offer any self-defense classes for women.
According to Carole Pertofsky, director of
Cowell's Health Promotion Services, in the past
the Coalition for Sexual Assault handled on-cam
pus self-defense classes in conjunction with a
group called Women Defending Ourselves. How

ever, last year the coalition lost its ASSU special
fee and was left without resources.
In addition, Pertofsky explained, because of
Title IX regulations the University was forced to
eliminate single-sex classes like those offered by
Women Defending Ourselves. Women Defend
ing Ourselves will offer a class at the Palo Alto
Community Center in March.
"We were caught in a stranglehold," Pertof
sky said.
Sally Baird, the sexual assault prevention pro
gram manager at Cowell, expressed her frustra
tion with the system.
"Trying to problem-solve has been tough,"
Baird said. "I have been frustrated trying to work
with prevention without self-defense."
Dean of Students Marc Wais said he was
alarmed at the dearth of self-defense classes at
Stanford and said he wanted the University to
move to change the situation.
"I would like to publicly announce that we are
going to try to find a way to move quickly on this
issue," he said. "If we can't provide a safe envi
ronment for students to live and learn, then what
do we have here?"
