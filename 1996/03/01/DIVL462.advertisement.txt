PLAYBOOK
for Better Social Positioning
as endorsed by feill Wahlt
Its all about being in the right place at the
right time. And it your not, then you're not
hot. You're not happenin'. You're not — literally
— where it's at. The new Diversions Play book
for Better Social Positioning (as endorsed by Bill
Walsh) gives you the gameplan you need to
really function at any function.
Don't wait. Just do it. You know why. The
Playbook's got the who, what, when, and how
to get you where you need to be — plus helpful
tips from the Genius himself! So if you want
to be social, get in position!
Because Social Position begins with social position
