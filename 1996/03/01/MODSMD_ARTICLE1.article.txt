The Students' Alliance an
nounced yesterday the endorse
ment of 10 students for the spring
ASSU Senate election.
None of the candidates that
the party has endorsed is an in
cumbent and all are young. The

candidates are
sophomores
Emily Andrews,
Pedro Fernan
dez and Ken
Howery; and
freshmen

Melissa Chud, Matthew Fei, An
drew Hsiao, Josh Lippman, Chris
Peart, Robert Windom and Steve
Yoda.
"We've chosen young students
who are not entrenched in the
semi-corrupt ASSU government
in order to build strength for fu
ture years," said freshman
Robert Windom, chair of the
party.
"We're a young, diverse group
of newcomers with good ideas; we
think can really help out the sen
ate," Fei said.
Central to the philosophy of
Students' Alliance is its "firm
commitment to improving stu
dent services and advocating stu
dent desires," Windom said.
"While national issues like the
ones the People's Platform tries
to address are important, we as a
party feel that there is a limit to
how much influence our student
government can affect national
policy. . . . The ASSU doesn't al
ways deal with students as direct
ly as it should."
Windom added that this year's
candidates are united on several
concrete goals: strengthening the
dorm ASSU representative sys
tem, creating a course review
book for listing and rating cours
es, offering Cultures, Ideas and
Values lecture notes, breaking
the campus vending and washing
machine "monopolies" and mak
ing it possible for students to pay
