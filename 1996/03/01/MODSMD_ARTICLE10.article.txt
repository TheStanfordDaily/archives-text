## New method found to match marrow 
### Alison Davis Contributing writer 
Pathology Prof. F. Carl Grumet and his col
leagues at Stanford Medical Center have identi
fied what they think is a more reliable way to
match bone marrow donors and recipients.
Esther Behar, a postdoctoral fellow in
Grumet's lab, was lead author of a recent study
describing their work, appearing in the Feb. 1
issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
Professors and researchers from the depart
ments of pathology and health research and
policy also contributed to the study.
Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is
the process by which a patient receives someone
else's bone marrow (the donor) after his or her
own marrow has first been eradicated by high
dose radiation.
However, immune systems are so highly
specialized that cutting and pasting bone mar
row from one person to another is not trivial. In
fact, unless donor and recipient are identical
twins, there is a risk of rejection — either the re
cipient rejects the donor's marrow or vice versa,
according to Grumet.

Medicine has devised reasonably accurate
ways to predict whether a potential donor-re
cipient union will work. For years, this has been
accomplished by a procedure called H LA typing
— a process which compares several protein
markers known to be important for marrow
compatibility between individuals.
According to Grumet, there is such hetero
geneity within these protein markers that the
probability of two random individuals match
ing is extremely remote — one in 10,000 to one
in 100,000. In contrast, siblings can have a one
in four chance of matching.
Even among HLA-matched people, there is
still a 5 percent to 10 percent chance of develop
ing a serious, often fatal complication called
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as a result of
the transplant.
While it's rare for the recipient to reject the
donor marrow, what's more common is for the
donor marrow to reject the host — this is
GVHD. "Basically, the donated marrow doesn't
like it's new house," explained Grumet.
The Stanford group hypothesized that there
must be as yet unidentified transplant markers
that are important. "We reasoned that [blood

vessels] are the first place where immune cells
will encounter foreignness," said Grumet.
The goal was to search through a battery of
protein targets present in the cells lining blood
vessels which might be heterogeneous, or poly
morphic, in the general population. The hunt
paid ofT — they identified a molecule called
CD3I, which was highly polymorphic at a spe
cific genetic locus.
It turns out that the presence or absence of a
single change in the DNA of the CD3I gene at a
specific spot was highly correlated with the
compatibility of donor-recipient marrow
matching.
Seventy percent to 80 percent of CD3I
- patients did not develop GVHD,
whereas non-CD3I-matched patients fared
much worse — only 20 percent to 30 percent did
not develop GVHD.
But the puzzle isn't solved yet — something
else must be accounting for the remaining
CD3I-matched patients who still develop
GVHD. The team's future research will focus
on searching for still other suspect molecules
which might be polymorphic and may also con
tribute to rejection, according to Grumet.
