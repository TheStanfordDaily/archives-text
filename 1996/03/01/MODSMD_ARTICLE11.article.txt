# Group will aim to coordinate service
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
A new community service
group sprang into action earlier
this week, beginning an effort to
foster communication between
different campus service groups.
The Public Service Communi
ty Leadership Program is a new
program at the Haas Center for
Public Service which hopes to
create a "community of service
groups" which will enable differ
ent service organizations to col
laborate and share their differ
ent approaches to community
needs.
Student leaders from a wide
range of community service organi
zations met for the first time Sun
day to watch a play based on the
1992 Los Angeles riots and met
again Tuesday to hold a discussion.
"The program arose from the
concern that people engaged in
community service as a response
to meeting needs in society are
themselves not together," said
Nadinne Cruz, associate director
of the Haas Center. "The very
same divisions that exist in soci
ety exist among those in commu
nity service."
Cruz, who started the new pro
gram, added that its aim is to give
student leaders a forum to "talk
honestly but safely about their
different perspectives on what
needs to be done to meet urgent
needs in society . . . and what ser
vice ought to be."
About 20 students, all of whom
have been leaders in service
groups, will be involved in the pro
gram's first year. The students
applied to the program earlier this
month.
Last Sunday the group saw a
play by Assoc. Drama Prof. Anna
Deavere Smith called, "Twilight:
Los Angeles, 1992," which deals
with the subject of race and class
in America.
At the Tuesday meeting stu
dents met with Stuart Burden,
who is here this week as part of
the Haas Center's Visiting Men
tors Program, and shared their
views on their respective commu
nity service endeavors.
"There's not community going

on between the different commu
nities on campus," said junior Fe
lipe Merino, who is coordinator of
Project AIYME — Asian Initia
tive for Youth Minority Enrich
ment — and SURE Escort Ser
vice. "I think it's everybody's re
sponsibility to cross over lines
that may be considered uncom
fortable."
A typical case of disharmony
among different service groups,
Cruz said, is the disagreement be
tween tutoring programs and
those who feel the greater need is
to address more political, "root"
problems placing youths at risk.
"Advocacy or political groups
and tutoring programs tend not to
respect what each other does in
response to the problem," Cruz
said.
Senior Lisa Dawe, who is co-di
rector of the Visiting Mentors
Program, said it is important to
provide ways for students to be
come involved in"the outside
world."
"There are so many options
out there and ways to get in
volved, but there's a fear that stu
dents are so entrenched here and
busy keeping their heads above
the water that they won't take
those opportunities," Dawe said.
Cruz asked students to explain
why they personally felt their ser
vice activities might be a "leap of
faith."
"I think service is a leap of
faith," said junior Eileen Lai, co
ordinator of Green Oaks at Stan
ford and tutor coordinator for the
Ravenswood Stanford Tutoring
Program. "We're all here because
we all feel that we can somehow
make a difference.. .. That takes
faith, faith that in our own way,
the little pieces that we do all
come together."
Senior Eric Burton, communi
ty service coordinator at the Black
Community Services Center, said
it is important to make "the dis
tinction between optimism and
hope."
"While a lot of times it's hard
to be positive about what's hap
pening in society, we can never
lose the hope," Burton said, "be
cause it's hope that really makes
things happen."
