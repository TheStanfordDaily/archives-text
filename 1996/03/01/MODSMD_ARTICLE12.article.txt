## TV industry to implement ratings Clinton says decision gives 'remote control back to America's parents' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Under
pressure from parents and politicians,
the television industry promised yes
terday to devise a ratings system to
warn of violence and sex. "They're
handing the TV remote control back to
America's parents," President Clinton
said.
The promise to rate thousands of
hours of programs by the end of the
year came during a White House meet
ing between Clinton and about 30 tele
vision and entertainment industry
executives.
Clinton also pressed his interest in
requiring stations to air at least three
hours a week of educational programs
for children.
Though the broadcasting industry
opposes such quotas, TV executives
told reporters they are interested in
improving the quality of programming.
"It is not enough for parents to be
able to tune out what they don't want
their children to watch," Clinton said.
"They want to be able to tune in good
programs that their children will
watch."
"I think (there will be) more Brady
Bunch type of programming than cut
ting edge," said Ted Turner, chief of
Turner Broadcasting System Inc.

TV executives envision a system like
the one used for movies, but they are a
long way from agreement on whether
cartoons and news magazine shows
should be rated and how to rate soap
operas.
A task force of TV executives will
begin work Friday to devise ratings cri
teria and symbols and decide what will
and won't be rated.
"I think it's going to be arduous, be
tormenting," said Motion Picture Asso
ciation of America President Jack
Valenti, who is overseeing the ratings
effort.
Industry executives privately insist
news and sports programs won't be
rated, but Valenti said no decision had
been made.
The system would cover programs
on commercial and public television
and on cable. Program distributors
would apply the rating.
A new law urges — but doesn't force
— the TV industry to rate programs.
The ratings, however, are critical to
another requirement of the law: that
new TV sets be equipped with the v
chip. With a remote-control-like device,
a person can block such programs from
appearing on the TV screen. Without
t ratings, the v-chip is useless.

Vice President A 1 Gore predicted the
system eventually would reduce the
amount of violence and sex on televi
sion.
NBC President Bob Wright said his
network is preparing for "some fallout"
of advertising revenue from a ratings
plan. The theory is that programs that
carry a tougher sex and violence rating
won't be as attractive to advertisers as
shows with a benign rating.
"It's going to cost us quite a bit of
money," Turner said. But ABC Presi
dent Robert Iger disagreed. Major
advertising groups say they support
the plan.
For years, the TV industry opposed
rating programs, saying it would vio
late free speech and reduce advertising
revenue.
Under the law, if the industry
doesn't create its own ratings system in
a year, a government-appointed panel
of industry executives would.
NBC's Wright, explaining the rever
sal, said that back when the TV indus
try was battling the provisions in
Congress, "many of us were very skep
tical" that all segments of the industry
could agree on a ratings plan. Others
indicated that the reversal makes polit
ical and legal sense for the industry.
