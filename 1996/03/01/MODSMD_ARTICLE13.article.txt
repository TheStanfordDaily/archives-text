F. Lee Bailey ordered to jail
OCALA, Fla. (AP) — F. Lee Bailey was ordered
jailed yesterday for failing to turn over millions in
cash and stock from a drug-dealer client. Prosecu
tors say the money belongs to the government.
The 62-year-old defense attorney must report
to prison today for a six-month contempt of court
sentence unless he can produce the money and
stock, Paul ruled.
Bailey says his former client gave him the
assets, now worth $3 million cash and $18.7 mil
lion in stock, for legal fees and expenses in a drug
trafficking case.
Prosecutors claim most of it belongs to the gov
ernment, as part of the forfeiture the drug dealer
agreed to in a plea bargain, and that Bailey was

supposed to take only fees and expenses and then
turn over the rest.
