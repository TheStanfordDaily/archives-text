# Cuba reacts to U.S. sanctions

### 
HAVANA (AP) â€” Yesterday Cuba warned it
won't permit anyone to enter its waters to honor
four exile pilots it shot down last weekend, and said
new U.S. sanctions would have "severe" conse
quences for bilateral relations.
Cuban citizens, meanwhile, reacted with resigna
tion or indifference to news that Washington would
tighten its economic embargo.
"This is going to strengthen the government" by
rallying people behind it, said Ramon Torres, a park
worker. "The government here is fighting for every
one."
"They are fencing us in," said Miguel Rodriguez,
who was selling carved wooden statues from an
umbrella stand at a seaside market.
The sanctions that were agreed upon Wednesday
are designed primarily to punish foreign investors
using American assets confiscated by Cuba and to
force President Fidel Castro from power.
Few Cubans, however, said they believed that

would happen. Instead, some said, they would be the
ones who would suffer.
"We are Cubans here. I'm not talking about com
munism or capitalism," Rodriguez said. "I'm here
fighting to make a living. We have an economic open
ing now, but..."
Cuba's communist government has allowed ven
dors such as Rodriguez to run their own stands at
the market for four years now under an economic lib
eralization policy. Some Cubans are allowed to run
their own businesses and to conduct them in U.S.
dollars.
Disappointing harvests of sugar, a crucial foreign
exchange earner, and the loss of aid from the former
Soviet Union have hurt the economy. As a result, the
government has aggressively solicited foreign invest
ment, especially in tourism. One government booklet
contains advertisements from dozens of sugar, cloth
ing, concrete and other firms seeking foreign part
ners.
