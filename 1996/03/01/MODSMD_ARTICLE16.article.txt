Management company
must consider student
needs in Tresidder plan

AT LONG LAST, it seems that
the much-anticipated Taco
Bell might — and that is, of
course, an emphatic might — actu
ally be on its way into Tresidder
Union.
This news came last week from
Dean of Students Marc Wais, who
has been meeting with the Tresid
der Memorial Union Advisory
Board and the Stanford Manage
ment Company — the entity which
manages Tresidder — to discuss the
future of the student union.
Temporarily putting aside the
Taco Bell-PepsiCo-Burma issue,
students should give Wais signifi
cant credit for taking positive steps
toward improving Tresidder, and
for bringing this issue to the fore. At
the same time, it must be asked
whether Tresidder improvements
are being pursued in the proper
manner.
The administration has appar
ently decided to look into Tresid
der's operations for a purely finan
cial reason: In recent years, the Uni
versity has contributed at least
$500,000 annually toward Tresid
der's upkeep. This year, however,
the Provost's Office has said they
will contribute only $300,000, thus
forcing the management company
to make up the additional $200,000
in rent and other revenue.
While it is understandable that
the building should not continue to
operate in the red, The Stanford
Management Company must
remember Tresidder's role as a stu
dent union and find appropriate
tenants.
A prime example of the manage
ment company ignoring this fact is
the case of Pulse Copy Center. Pulse
is an independent contractor, but its
predecessor, Document Express,
was a University division. Original

ly located in the Business School,
Document Express came into
Tresidder in what was supposed to
be a temporary arrangement while
its original, earthquake-damaged
space was repaired. Today, Pulse
remains — even though its Busi
ness School branch has reopened.
This business, while unquestion
ably providing much-needed rental
revenues to Tresidder, has as its pri
mary clientele not students but fac
ulty and academic departments.
The advisory board and the man
agement company must work to
avoid situations such as with Pulse.
Certainly the Tresidder building
could be filled with rent-paying
businesses which provide services
to the University rather than to the
student body. Perhaps PSSI, the
company which hauls Stanford's
trash, could be persuaded to relocat
ed its headquarters to Tresidder.
Certainly revenue would be pro
duced, but Tresidder would cease to
be a student union.
Rather than haphazardly search
ing for revenue-producing tenants,
the advisory board and the manage
ment company should respond to
specific student needs and then for
mulate a cohesive and comprehen
sive program to overhaul Tresidder.
Last year, the management com
pany conducted a study of what
businesses students would like to
see in Tresidder. Making this effort
was in the management company's
financial interest; students will be
more likely to patronize businesses
that they have specifically request
ed. With the campus' needs deter
mined, the management company
should draw up complete plans for
Tresidder specifically based upon
based upon those findings.
Tresidder can be a valuable
resource to Stanford. If properly
managed, it can provide businesses
and services of real use to the cam
pus community. But rather than
rushing into change merely for the
sake of revenues, Tresidder's man
agement must take a careful and
well-planned approach to ensure
that Stanford's student union truly
serves student needs.
