## Absolving responsibility? 
### 
THERE WAS A column in The Wall
Street Journal recently in which the
author argued that blacks use racism
as a way of getting out of responsibility for
our actions. He was specifically referring to
Joseph Jett, the Wall Street trader who is
alleged to have created fraudulent profits to
enhance his bonus compensation, saying
that when Jett's current line of defense
failed, Jett would start crying that racism
was the cause of his current dilemma. The
author then went on to say that this had
become a widespread phenomena in Ameri
ca, fostered by our liberal and politically cor
rect times. The gist of the column was that
blacks had an "Absolve me of responsibility"
card, kind of like a "Get out of jail free" card
in Monopoly.
Had I not been so amazed, I would have
laughed. It's a pretty sure bet that most
blacks and other minorities would prefer
that racism didn't exist. There are a few
whose livelihoods seem to depend upon con
flict between the races, and hence might
have to search for other vocations should
that conflict not exist, but on the whole,
most of us would prefer to live without it.
But racism exists.
However, racism, while it is a problem, it
is not the problem. The actual problem is
discrimination. The writer added to his
other erroneous assumptions — including
the belief that Jett couldn't be discriminat
ed against because he Ls well-educated and
highly salaried — a common misunder

standing about the difference between
racism and discrimination.
liacism is a set of beliefs. Discrimination
is a set of actions. Racism is about thoughts.
Discrimination is about behaviors which
affect people's lives. Sometimes people who
aren't consciously racist discriminate inad
vertently. Sometimes discrimination is built
into a systematic way that things are done.
Sometimes it is a blatant and deliberate act.
We could probably live with the racism if the
discrimination didn't occur.
Given our programming, most of us have
had a racist thought or two during our life
times, which we may have realized or had
pointed out to us, which we then changed,
or did not change, depending upon our tem
perament. The effect may have been an
inappropriate statement or two. Discrimi
nation consists of actions which detrimen
tally affect lives and points of view.
A friend told me that he thought it was
appropriate for the police to harass black
people since the cops are likely to be harass
ing someone who deserves it. What my
friend was saying, then, is that from his
point of view, most black people are likely to
be criminals. When I asked whether it was
acceptable for the police to harass me
(thinking he might say no), he was at least
consistent enough to say yes, they should,
that sometimes good people in society have
to bear some costs for the good of society as
a whole.
Who decides who should bear these

costs? And what about the cost of discrimi
nation? There is a real sense of disenfran
chisement which takes place when one does
not feel like a citizen in one's own country.
A Vietnamese friend and I discussed the
survival mechanism that minorities develop
to deal with day-to-day interactions and the
specter of discrimination. Minorities scruti
nize many interactions with others, trying
to determine if we are being treated fairly,
looking for signs of discriminatory behavior.
Most develop a "trigger level," a point at
which each of us is willing to believe that
discrimination has occurred.
So while we both agreed that there were
many situations which could be interpreted
as discrimination, our trigger levels were
different. And that's understandable
because these are developed by intuition
and experiences. And I can believe that
there are people who might allege discrimi
nation when it may not exist; perhaps they
are very sensitive, given their experiences,
and their trigger levels are quite low. How
ever, I cannot believe, as the Journal's writ
er suggested, that this is a widespread phe
nomena among the black community. It
just isn't so.

Pamela Givens promises that one day she
will write a column alxnit something other
than race relations.
