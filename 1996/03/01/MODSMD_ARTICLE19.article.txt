COP slate says The Daily's coverage was distorted

MISPERCEPTIONS REGARDING
our COP slate have been flying
around in The Daily during this
past week. Now that we actually have a
slate, we feel the appropriate time has
arrived to address concerns students
might have as a result of assumptions
born out of sensationalized coverage about
a then-unformed COP slate. As any group
of candidates for this office should, we
expect and invite intense scrutiny from
every member of the student body.
Instead, The Daily has been premature
in its coverage by drumming up false con
troversy about issues of racial divisiveness
that never existed. The pseudo-controver
sy arose as we were attempting to assem
ble a COP slate which would most effec-

tively represent the wide range of student
interests on our campus. Now that there
actually is a slate, we want to be clear
about who we are, what we are not and,
most importantly, what we stand for.
We are Ben, Angie, Jason and Bill.
First and foremost, we are Stanford stu
dents just like you. And like this student
body, we represent a great breadth of
experience and ideas. We have come
together to form a team because we share
common goals and a unified vision for the
COP. As easy as it may seem, the process
which has brought us to this point was
lengthy and difficult. Given the myriad of
interests and the importance of this job,
the process must bring together a united
group of advocates who complement one

another while serving as the student
voice. This means asking all the "tough"
questions and demanding a complete com
mitment. Our slate has achieved this goal
We are an independent slate concerned
with issues that will unify students. Root
ed in the positive goals of the People's
Platform, we believe that the COP must
transcend party politics in the interest of
representing every student. The most
important issues on campus are non-par
tisan. We are ready to tackle those real
issues.
Students deserve thorough discussion
of student issues. Ongoing issues such as
student services, safety and funding need
to be addressed in every election. Current
issues such as ASSU reform are equally

important and cannot be ignored. Issues
that have been ignored, including Greek
affairs and judicial reform, deserve fair
consideration. We are committed to honest
and open discourse about these topics. We
challenge The Daily and all other student
publications to be a forum for constructive
debate, not a venue for distorted political
melodramas removed from and irrelevant
to the everyday lives of Stanford students.
