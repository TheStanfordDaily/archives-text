# Students remember century-ago battle for independent Ethiopia
## 
### 
One hundred years ago: March 1,
1896. Adwa, Ethiopia. It is 4 a.m. and
Emperor Menelik II and Empress Taitu
are in deep prayer at church, beseeching
St. George to help the country, the
emperor and the faith. Everyone in
church takes Holy Communion and the
green, yellow and red Ethiopian flag is
dipped before the crucifix. By dawn the
Emperor and Empress have assembled
thousands of their troops who came
from every corner of the country, and
march on Adwa to meet the invading
Italian General Oreste Baratieri and his
army of over 17,000.
The fighting was intense, and with

over 5,000 dead on the Ethiopian side
and 7,000 dead on the Italian side, Adwa
was the bloodiest of all colonially moti
vated battles. The Italian army was deci
mated and all their weapons handed
over to the Emperor; 2,000 Italians were
taken prisoner. It was an uncontested
victory for Ethiopia and Italy was forced
to sign a treaty recognizing the absolute
independence of Ethiopia.
The London Spectator in March
1896 called Adwa "the most notable vic
tory of an African over an European
army since the time of Hannibal," and
commented that "the Italians have suf
fered a great disaster . . . greater than
has ever occurred in modern times to
white men in Africa." The Italian gov
ernment was in fact so humiliated by
this defeat that Prime Minister Crispi
and his entire cabinet resigned. On the
other hand, the victory put Emperor
Menelik and Ethiopia on the map as

symbols of black power. It placed
Ethiopia on equal negotiating power
with any European country and gave
her the leverage several years later to
enter the League of Nations as a found
ing member (over the objections of the
Italian government).
At the centennial celebration of
Adwa, we would like to share with the
Stanford community the significance of
the Ethiopian victory. At a time when
virtually every country in Africa and
Asia had fallen to colonialism, Adwa
became a turning point by shattering the
perception of European invincibility (the
Japanese victory over the Russians was
in 1905). Adwa inspired colonized people
throughout the world, and especially
black people, to fight for their indepen
dence. In fact, Adwa stirred so much
emotion among black people that when
Italy invaded Ethiopia again in 1935 to
avenge her defeat at Adwa, it created an

unprecedented mobilization of black peo
ples throughout the world, as thousands
(especially in the United States and
Caribbean) volunteered to fight in the
defense of Ethiopia.
Today, 100 years later, Adwa still
symbolizes the victory of unity, determi
nation and leadership . . . against all
odds.
