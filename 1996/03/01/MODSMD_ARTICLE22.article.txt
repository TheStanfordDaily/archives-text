# Allison Amend: The better part of valor
## Covered mirrors and sliced tongue: shivah in Tulsa 
### 
My grandmother died last week.
Every time I say this — in
response to someone's coarse
'who died?" after noticing me dressed in
black, in answer to a "where were you last
weekend?" or out of politeness' sake to the
understanding question "What's wrong?"
— I feel as though it's less true.
There ought to be something different
about me. I have been touched by death.
Not that my experience is particularly
new. Everyone has had someone close to
them die; all of my 20-something friends
have elderly grandparents.
Not that my experience is particularly
tragic. No gory severed heads, no painful
battles with illness (though Alzheimer's is
debilitating, my grandmother was blissful
ly unaware that she was losing the prover
bial marbles), just a sudden heart attack.
But death requires response: initial
shock followed immediately by efficacious
action. "Have you made plane reserva
tions? Called Aunt Sadie?" And in my case,
a trip to Tulsa, Oklahoma.
I lave you ever been to Tulsa? The three
most important things to come out of Tulsa

are (in descending order): supermodel
Amber Valleta, the cinematic triumph
"The Outsiders" and Oral Roberts (of "God
wants me to have a million dollars or he'll
strike me dead" fame). My apologies to Tul
sans, but it's what you would imagine
would happen if Taco Bell bought an entire
city and built it in the image of every plas
ticine franchise ever conceived. And that's
on a good day. Landlocked, drought-ridden,
segregated, bereft of any saving social
scene, if death had to occur, then Tulsa,
whether it be the cause or the epitome of
the Dickensian notion of "landscape mir
roring emotions," is the place for it.
My first funeral.
Enter me. The stage is set for shiva, the
Jewish version of a wake. Mirrors are cov
ered with sheets, and scores of geriatrics
have come to console my grandfather,
whose skeletal, fragile, numbed state
makes one worry for his health as well.
Each time the doorbell rings, I am
instructed to tell condolence-callers to wash
their hands with the pitcher outside and eat
an egg. Why they should do this is not
explained to me (I assume it's part of the

Jewish ritual), but I am glad to have a job.
The doorbell rings again, and it is more
food. Thank God. The entire salmon the
fish store brought over (free of charge
because my grandmother patronized them
faithfully for 50 years) is nearing comple
tion, and we are all so bloated from the deli
trays that have materialized mysteriously
in the kitchen over the past few days that
anything besides cold cuts is welcome.
Food, for some reason, seems to be de
rigeur at this occasion, and we are heaped
with such delicacies as tongue (mmm,
mmm, good), kugel (that clumpy noodle
raison mess only a freshwoman in a dining
hall could love), cheese balls (that was an
invention that should have been buried
with my grandmother), as well as desserts
from the old country: ruggelach, pies and a
"pecan apple thingy" that was actually very
good — "Aunt Tootsie would be happy to
give you the recipe, it's good for breakfast,
lunch, snacks, in fact, it helps you grow,
and it was passed down from her bubbie in
Poland, wouldn't you know, and not that
bad for you either: just a little corn syrup,
not more than one bag of sugar, and she

substituted margarine for the couple sticks
of butter called for in the recipe."
Conversations with unknown friends
and relations provide interesting mental
fodder as well. Did I know my grand
mother had an older brother, as beautiful
and smart and charming and promising
(he had just finished law school) as the
first nice day of spring, who died in a trag
ic car crash near Midland, Texas, when he
was just 25? And that all the relatives,
whom my great-grandfather worked so
hard to bring over from the old country,
peddling his wares throughout the South,
died with him, leaving only my grand
mother and his fiancee (who was never
heard from again) left alive?
Did I know my grandmother suffered
from anorexia, before it had a name?
Did I know my grandmother met my
grandfather on a double blind date, and
that, in the bathroom, powdering her nose,
she said to her friend, on that very night,
"Do you like Ed? Because that's the man
I'm gonna marry!"?
Did I hear the story about my grand
mother, who, one day in the later stages of

her illness, talked to my mother and aunt
for over an hour? When my mother left the
room, she said to my aunt, "What a nice
young lady. What's her name?" My aunt
replied, "That's Sheila, Mom."
"Oh," my grandmother paused. "I have
a daughter named Sheila."
And in the light of the candles, sur
rounded by grim black prayerbooks and
the sound of the minyan being recited by
bowing and bobbing men, chanting low
the ritual sound of the Kaddish, we
laugh, remembering.
And I laugh now, or I tiy to, when peo
ple ask how I'm doing. Because I finally
understand the purpose of ritual. I'm com
forted by the food, the windows steamed
with the breath of old friends, the sheets
over the mirrors and the eggs outside the
door, the liturgy of the prayers and the too
hot black wool I'm wearing. Involved in rit
ual, I'm part of something larger, an
inevitable teleology of grief. Because of
these traditions, we are able to move on.

mother had an older brother, as beautiful
and smart and charming and promising
(he had just finished law school) as the
first nice day of spring, who died in a trag
ic car crash near Midland, Texas, when he
was just 25? And that all the relatives,
whom my great-grandfather worked so
hard to bring over from the old country,
peddling his wares throughout the South,
died with him, leaving only my grand
mother and his fiancee (who was never
heard from again) left alive?
Did I know my grandmother suffered
from anorexia, before it had a name?
Did I know my grandmother met my
grandfather on a double blind date, and
that, in the bathroom, powdering her nose,
she said to her friend, on that very night,
"Do you like Ed? Because that's the man
I'm gonna marry!"?
Did I hear the story about my grand
mother, who, one day in the later stages of

her illness, talked to my mother and aunt
for over an hour? When my mother left the
room, she said to my aunt, "What a nice
young lady. What's her name?" My aunt
replied, "That's Sheila, Mom."
"Oh," my grandmother paused. "I have
a daughter named Sheila."
And in the light of the candles, sur
rounded by grim black prayerbooks and
the sound of the minyan being recited by
bowing and bobbing men, chanting low
the ritual sound of the Kaddish, we
laugh, remembering.
And I laugh now, or I tiy to, when peo
ple ask how I'm doing. Because I finally
understand the purpose of ritual. I'm com
forted by the food, the windows steamed
with the breath of old friends, the sheets
over the mirrors and the eggs outside the
door, the liturgy of the prayers and the too
hot black wool I'm wearing. Involved in rit
ual, I'm part of something larger, an
inevitable teleology of grief. Because of
these traditions, we are able to move on.
