## Volleyball falls to No. 10 Pacific No. 5 Cardinal drops fourth straight match 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
The opportunity to salvage the season was right in
the grasp of the fifth-ranked Stanford men's volleyball
team last night. Playing in the comfort of Burnham
Pavilion against a team the Cardinal thrashed in its
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation opener last
month, it appeared that the men were ready to snap
their three-match losing streak and better their post
season chances in the process.
Unfortunately, lOth-ranked Pacific was no
pushover this time, as the Tigers stunned the Cardinal
in four games, 15-6, 15-9, 12-15, 15-13, handing the
men their fourth consecutive loss and dropping them
to 6-5 in league play. Once challenging for the division
title, the Cardinal now faces the unsavory prospect of
not even qualifying for postseason play.
"We did not respond well to the pressure," said
Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves. "We started poor
ly and we finished poorly. I am very disappointed in the
way we responded."
Stanford was also hurt by the abscence of junior
middle blocker Brian Moore, who missed his third
straight match due to a foot injury. Pacific exploited
the middle by racking up 84 kills on the night while ju
nior opposite Matt Fuerbringer was unable to carry the
offensive load, commiting 11 errors on his way to a dis
mal .205 hitting percentage.
"It was a poor hitting night for him," Nieves said.
"He just wasn't the same as he was against North
ridge."
As has become routine, the Cardinal started slowly
in game one. The starting six passed erratically and
committed several errors in falling behind 5-1. By the
time it reached 9-1, every starter except junior opposite
Matt Fuerbringer had been substituted for. The subs,
led by sophomore swing hitter Devin Poolman, rallied
to make the score more respectable.
"They got several sideouts and stopped the bleeding
for us," Nieves said. Unfortunately, the team's 15 first
game hitting errors and a meager .024 hitting percent
age were too much to overcome as the Tigers easily
took the first game.
Stanford's new lineup started to hit effectively in
game two, as the men jumped out to a 3-1 lead. But that
was as good as it got for the Cardinal. Led by junior
middle blocker Greg Wakeham, Pacific ripped off a
stringof points to take a 10-3 leaden route to a 15-9 vic
tory.
The third game saw the Stanford spikers finally
showing some life, as the Cardinal took the offensive by
moving Fuerbringer to swing hitter and Poolman op-

posite the setter. These moves
staked Stanford to a 13-8 lead, as
the men fought off a late Tiger
rally to win 15-12 and put them
selves right back in the match.
Hopes of a comeback dissolved
in game four, however. Not only
did Stanford choke away an 8-1
lead, it also lost Poolman at a criti
cal juncture of the match. Up 11-
9, Stanford appeared primed to
force a fifth game until the sopho
more went down with a sprained
ankle. Pacific regained the serve
and turned the two-point deficit
into a 15-11 Tiger victory.
"We basically had a chance to
win," Nieves said. "But we weren't
good enough or tough enough to
finish them off. We've got to buck
le down in practice and as a coach,
challenge the players like they've
never been challenged before so
they can be ready right from the
start of the match."
