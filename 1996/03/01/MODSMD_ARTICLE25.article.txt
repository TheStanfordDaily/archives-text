# Baseball at No. 6 Sun Devils
## Ninth-ranked Cardinal will play three-game series at ASU 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
The road ahead doesn't get any
easier for the ninth-ranked Stan
ford baseball team, which will hit
the road for the fifth time in the
past six weeks today through Sun
day when it takes on No. 6 Ari
zona State in Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division play.
Alter dropping two of three
games to UCLA last weekend, the
Cardinal (10-7 overall, 1-2 Six-
Pac) faces a hot-hitting Sun Devil
squad which has played all 15 of
its games in front of its home
crowd at Packard Stadium. Next
week, Stanford will host last

year's NCAA runner-up, USC, in
a weekend series.
Arizona State (12-3, 0-0) has
put up huge offensive totals so far
in 1996, averaging 11.5 runs per
game with a high of 19 in its sea
son opener, a 19-7 win over Loyola
Maiymount. The Sun Devils have
also scored 17 runs on four occa
sions, including a 17-16 victory
two weeks ago against Texas
Tech, the only ranked opponent to
face second-year coach Pat Mur
phy's ballclub.
As a team, ASU is hitting .343
and has amassed 24 home runs,
twice as many as the Cardinal. In
dividual standouts for the Sun
Devils include sophomore right

fielder Dan McKinley (.500,5 HR,
19 RBI), sophomore center fielder
Mikel Moreno (.418, 5 HR, 23
RBI) and senior second baseman
Robbie Kent (.414,4 HR, 20 RBI).
Catcher Cody McKay has also
chipped in four home runs and 20
RBI.
Despite the two losses to the
Bruins a week ago, the Cardinal
lineup received a boost with the
return of senior AU-American
A.J. Hinch. Filling the designated
hitter role, Hinch went hitless in
his first game since injuring his
right shoulder, but collected four
hits over the next two days, in
eluding a home run in Saturday's
contest.
Senior second baseman Brian
Dallimore was one of four Cardinal
batters to tally five hits on the
weekend, raising his average from
.260 to .286.
"I'm starting to feel better at the
plate," said Dallimore, who batted
.323 last year and holds a .322 ca
reer average. "As each v eek goes by,
I'm getting back to last year's
form."
Catcher Jon Schaeffer, first
baseman Troy Kent and shortstop
Eric Sees knocked out five hits in
the series, while Hinch, right fielder
Joe Kilburg and center fielder Jody
Gerut added four apiece.
The Cardinal pitching staff will
look to shut down the Sun Devils'
bats, as right-handers Kyle Peter
son (2-2), Jeff Austin (3-1) and
Mario Iglesias (1-1) will start for
coach Mark Marquess.

Austin tossed a six-hit complete
game in Stanford's 9-1 win over
UCIA Saturday, fanning 13 Bruins
to increase his league-leading
strikeout total to 47 in 32 innings
pitched. The freshman's 0.84
earned run average is tops among
Cardinal hurlers.
Afler losing leads in its last two
losses, Dallimore said the team
needs to reduce its miscues — on the
field, at the plate and on the bases.
"We need to cut down on our
mistakes," he said. "In all of our
close losses, we've made lots of
them, up to 10 in each game. All of
those mistakes cost us a run or an
opportunity. If we can limit the mis
takes, we will be successful."
The Cardinal will approach this
series like any other, taking one
game at a time. With a tight race ex
pected for the Six-Pac crown, each
game is important.
"It's a long season — we know
there are a lot of games," Dallimore
said. "A 20-10 record will likely win
the conference this year. We know if
we start playing well we'll be all
right."
