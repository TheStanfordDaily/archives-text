### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
The road ahead doesn't get any
easier for the ninth-ranked Stan
ford baseball team, which will hit
the road for the fifth time in the
past six weeks today through Sun
day when it takes on No. 6 Ari
zona State in Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division play.
Alter dropping two of three
games to UCLA last weekend, the
Cardinal (10-7 overall, 1-2 Six-
Pac) faces a hot-hitting Sun Devil
squad which has played all 15 of
its games in front of its home
crowd at Packard Stadium. Next
week, Stanford will host last

year's NCAA runner-up, USC, in
a weekend series.
Arizona State (12-3, 0-0) has
put up huge offensive totals so far
in 1996, averaging 11.5 runs per
game with a high of 19 in its sea
son opener, a 19-7 win over Loyola
Maiymount. The Sun Devils have
also scored 17 runs on four occa
sions, including a 17-16 victory
two weeks ago against Texas
Tech, the only ranked opponent to
face second-year coach Pat Mur
phy's ballclub.
As a team, ASU is hitting .343
and has amassed 24 home runs,
twice as many as the Cardinal. In
dividual standouts for the Sun
Devils include sophomore right

fielder Dan McKinley (.500,5 HR,
19 RBI), sophomore center fielder
Mikel Moreno (.418, 5 HR, 23
RBI) and senior second baseman
Robbie Kent (.414,4 HR, 20 RBI).
Catcher Cody McKay has also
chipped in four home runs and 20
RBI.
Despite the two losses to the
Bruins a week ago, the Cardinal
lineup received a boost with the
return of senior AU-American
A.J. Hinch. Filling the designated
hitter role, Hinch went hitless in
his first game since injuring his
right shoulder, but collected four
hits over the next two days, in
