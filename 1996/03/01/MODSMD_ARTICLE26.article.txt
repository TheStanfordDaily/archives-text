# Women set to face UCSB, Cal
## Tennis home against Gauchos today, at Berkeley Saturday 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
After a second-place finish in
the National Indoor Tournament
last week in Madison, Wis., the
Cardinal women's tennis team

will be back at home this after
noon against UC-Santa Barbara.
More significantly, however,
Stanford (10-1 overall, 2-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion) returns to Pac-10 action on
Saturday in Berkeley against the

Golden Bears (6-4, 1-1).
Despite posting a No. 6 presea
son ranking, the Bears have had
their share of problems thus far
this season. California's top play
er, senior Pam Nelson, and its
top recruit, freshman Renata
Kolbic, both opted to leave the
collegiate ranks and turn profes
sional. Another top Bear com
petitor, Miko Hemsey, quit the
team as well.
"They are clearly in a rebuild
ing year," Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan said. "They're
just caught in a lurch right now.
They don't have their old guard
there to show the way and win
some matches, and they don't
have the new girls coming up. I
think some of the girls just didn't
pan out all that great.
"I feel sorry for them, and I
hope I still feel sorry for them
Saturday night."
As a result, Cal has struggled
to field its perennial title-con
tending squad. Last weekend in
Madison, the Golden Bears lost
three matches in as many at
tempts to Vanderbilt (5-4), Wake
Forest (5-3) and Notre Dame (5-
4). By comparison, the Cardinal
beat Wake Forest 5-1 and swept
all singles matches in a 6-0 shel
lacking of Vanderbilt.
"They're having a tough
year," Brennan said. "They're

struggling. I'm sure with Jan
Brogan coaching they'll be a lot
better by the end. She's a very
good coach, but I don't envy her
situation right now."
With Stanford on a 16-game
conference win streak, this is the
perfect time to catch Cal in
Berkeley.
"They will be tough against us
because it is Stanford-Cal,"
Brennan said. "But on the other
hand, we have got a chance to go
in there and do really well. We
have had some battles with them
and we've lost our share over
there."
Most recently, this matchup
provided a thriller last season
when the two teams collided at
Cal. The Cardinal needed a
tremendous comeback from the

No. 3 doubles team of Julie Scott
and Beth Berris to win 5-4 and
maintain its perfect Pac-10
record.
The most intriguing matchup
against Cal may surprisingly be
at the No. 6 singles spot, where
Cardinal redshirt senior Amy
Chiminello will face Cal fresh
man Marissa McLennan. McLen
nan began the season here on the
Farm and transferred to Cal
early in the season. She was able
to join the Golden Bear lineup
immediately because she is not
on scholarship.
"[Marissal is really a pretty
good player," Brennan said. "I
was very happy to have her. But
she got here and she stressed and
stressed and freaked out really.
So something didn't click, and
hopefully it was just this situa
tion and she'll be happy over
there. But it wasn't good for her
here.
"I think she was stressing be

cause she saw no opportunity.
She saw herself going in the
wrong direction and she saw us
with a lot of talent and also load
ing up again for next year."
McLennan has compiled a 7-3
singles record and also competes
at the No. 2 doubles spot for Cal.
As for UC-Santa Barbara, the
Gauchos are led by Jean Okada,
who sits at No. 46 in the nation in
singles competition. At 12-2 in
dual-match play, Okada is the
only UCSB singles player with a
winning record.
In doubles, Gauchos Amelia
White and Kelly Spencer (13-1)
have become a formidable tan
dem at the No. 1 position. They
should be a solid test for the Car
dinal No. 1 team of sophomore
Ania Bleszynski and junior Katie
Schlukebir. Despite a preseason
No. 1 ranking, Bleszynski and
Schlukebir have come out of the
gates slowly, posting a 3-3 record
for Stanford.
