# Women set to face UCSB, Cal
## Tennis home against Gauchos today, at Berkeley Saturday

After a second-place finish in
the National Indoor Tournament
last week in Madison, Wis., the
Cardinal women's tennis team

will be back at home this after
noon against UC-Santa Barbara.

have the new girls coming up. I
think some of the girls just didn't
pan out all that great.
"I feel sorry for them, and I

Madison, the Golden Bears lost
three matches in as many at
tempts to Vanderbilt (5-4), Wake
Forest (5-3) and Notre Dame (5-
4). By comparison, the Cardinal
beat Wake Forest 5-1 and swept
all singles matches in a 6-0 shel
