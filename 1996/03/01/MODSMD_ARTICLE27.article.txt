# Harmon Gym set to rock on Sunday
## Cardinal faces Cal in Pac-10 showdown 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Have some free time Sunday
afternoon around 2:30 p.m. Then
find a television that carries
Prime Sports, because you won't
be getting into a sold-out Harmon
Gym to watch No. 25 Stanford
tangle with Cal for the 227 th
time.
After all, this game could have
an NCAA Tournament berth
awarded to the winner. The Car
dinal (17-7 overall ,10-5 Pacific 10
Conference) and the Golden
Bears (16-8, 10-5) are tied for
third in the conference, and spec
ulation has it that four Pac-10
teams may not make it into the
field of 64.
Regardless of the tournament

implications, the Cal-Stanford
matchup is always one of the
fiercest of the season. Add to that
the Cardinal's 93-79 embarrass
ment of Cal earlier this year and
the hostile environment of Har
mon Gym should resemble a bull
dog on a pork chop.
"People there are so close
they're breathing down your
neck," head coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "It's the game of the
week this week and it would solid
ify either of our chances at post
season. But there will be the same
number of people at Harmon if
this game wasn't of this magni
tude. I don't know if they can yell
any louder."
Sliding new players into his
lineup, Cal head coach Todd Boze
man has reworked a team that had
lost four of six during a stretch earli
er this year. A one-game suspension
last week for Tremaine Fowlkes, Je
lani Gardner and Prentice McGrud
er for violating an unspecified team
rule has moved Tony Gonzalez,
Anwar McQueen and Ed Gray into
the starting five.
"They're playing really hard to
gether," Montgomery said. "Now,
guys are playing within their roles
and making the extra pass. His kids
are working hard and he's getting
good production off the bench."
Even with the lineup shift, the
man in Berkeley is still freshman
Shareef Abdur-Rahim. Leading the
conference in scoring at 22.0 points
per game, Abdur-Rahim has shat
tered the Cal freshman scoring
record and ranks second in steals for
freshmen and third in blocks and re
bounds.
Relegating themselves to stop
ping Abdur-Rahim backfired earlier
this year for the Cardinal, as Cal's
perimeter players scorched Stan

ford for 67.9 percent shooting in the
first half. While Abdur-Rahim only
took three shots, the Cardinal found
itself down 48-43 at halftime.
"If we stay in front of them and
front Shareef, keep the ball out of
his hands, we'll be fine," senior
David Harbour said. "We want to
minimize his touches and get back
side help and limit the penetration
of their perimeter players, force
them to beat us from the outside."
Stopping Abdur-Rahim and the
rest of Cal's weapons may seem like
a heavy task, but Bozeman has an
equal challenge in stopping Brevin
Knight and Dion Cross, who com
bined for 54 points in the first meet
ing.
"They open it up and let you play
â€” you have the option of driving to
the basket, and I'll try to do the
same thing [as last time]," Knight
said. In five games against Cal,
Knight has averaged 17.2 points
and 8.4 assists, both above his ca
reer averages.
Having the luxury of senior Andy
Poppink also helps Montgomery
battle Cal's lineup. A versatile play
er who will match up against Abdur-
Rahim inside and outside, Poppink
has missed the last two practices

with the flu but should be ready by
Sunday. Poppink has moved up to
third in the Pac-10 in rebounding,
averaging 8.3 per game.
Even "nth Poppink missing
some practice time, Harbour and
Knight feel there should be no prob
lem getting ready for the game Sun
day.
Stanford has won three in a row
over Cal, including last year's 78-73
win at Harmon.
Harbour said he feels shooting
will be the key for Stanford, with a
50 percent shooting night probably
good enough to secure the win. The
Cardinal shot 57.1 percent against
Cal earlier this year, but lately the
Bears have played stingier defense
and Stanford hasn't shot better
than 40 percent over the last three
games.
"It comes down to Sunday," he
said. "We feel we need one more win
to make the tournament, and if we
get the victory then it will take a lot
of the pressure off. Then we can just
relax and play.
"This is all the seniors' last game
ever against Cal. I don't think we
need any more incentive than that.
If we do, there's something wrong
with us."
