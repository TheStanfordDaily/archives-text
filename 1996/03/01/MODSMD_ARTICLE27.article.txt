# Harmon Gym set to rock on Sunday
## Cardinal faces Cal in Pac-10 showdown 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Have some free time Sunday
afternoon around 2:30 p.m. Then
find a television that carries
Prime Sports, because you won't
be getting into a sold-out Harmon
Gym to watch No. 25 Stanford
tangle with Cal for the 227 th
time.
After all, this game could have
an NCAA Tournament berth
awarded to the winner. The Car
dinal (17-7 overall ,10-5 Pacific 10
Conference) and the Golden
Bears (16-8, 10-5) are tied for
third in the conference, and spec
ulation has it that four Pac-10
teams may not make it into the
field of 64.
Regardless of the tournament

implications, the Cal-Stanford
matchup is always one of the
fiercest of the season. Add to that
the Cardinal's 93-79 embarrass
ment of Cal earlier this year and
the hostile environment of Har
mon Gym should resemble a bull
dog on a pork chop.
"People there are so close
they're breathing down your
neck," head coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "It's the game of the
week this week and it would solid
ify either of our chances at post
season. But there will be the same
number of people at Harmon if
this game wasn't of this magni
tude. I don't know if they can yell
any louder."
