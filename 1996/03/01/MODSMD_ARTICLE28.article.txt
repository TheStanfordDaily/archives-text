# No. 4 women out for 17th straight
## 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
Records have been falling in Bay
Area women's basketball all year.
While Stanford has been doing most
of the revising, their cross-bay rivals
from Berkeley have joined in the act
as well.
The No. 4 Cardinal (22-2 overall,
15-0 Pacific 10 Conference) hosts
Cal (6-18,2-13) tomorrow night at 7
p.m. Stanford sports its longest win
ning streak in over six years at 16,
while Cal broke a school-record 12-
game skid by stunning Washington
State 91-83 in Pullman last Satur
day.
Cal will try to pose at least a speed
bump on the Cardinal's drive for an
undefeated conference season and a
No. 1 seed in the West Region of the

NCAA tournament.
"They're consumed with the idea
of being undefeated," Stanford head
coach Amy Tucker said. "That's all
they ever talk about. We need a
strong showing in our conference to
impress the selection committee."
Cal's Gooch Foster, the dean of
Pac-10 coaches, has no such con
cerns. She will make her 15th and
possibly last trip to Maples, where
Cal has lost its nine games. Foster
took the Bears to three NCAA tour
naments in the early 19905, but the
likable Ph.D. holder has come under
fire recently for Cal's 9-42 confer
ence showing the last three years.
In her 499 th game at Cal, Foster
will face a decimated Stanford
squad. After last Sunday's brutal,
59-54 victory in Seattle, Cardinal
players seemed to be in good health.
Since then, however, sophomore for
ward Vanessa Nygaard was diag
nosed with a stress fracture in her
left foot, junior swing player
Charmin Smith injured her left
shoulder, sophomore guard Regan
Freuen is suffering from a back
problem and sophomore Olympia
Scott sustained a concussion. All but
Nygaard are probable tomorrow.
Nygaard, who is doubtful, led the
squad in rebounding for eight con
secutive games for one stretch, but
Stanford's wings and backcourt
have since picked up the slack In
each of the past three contests, 5-
foot-6 junior point guard Jamila
Wideman has paced the Cardinal in
rebounding. Her seven boards and
career-high 27 points vs. Washing
ton led to her first career Pac-10
Player of the Week award.
Wideman said Stanford has
"more than a few things" to work on
in its last three games prior to tour
nament play.
"We have to work a bit on our of

fensive execution," Wideman said.
"In the second half (against Wash
ington], we weren't really running
any plays."
Wideman shared Player of the
Week honors with her counterpart,
Cal's Eliza Sokolowska, who tied a
career high with 33 points in Cal's
recent win three days afler undergo
ing surgery to mend a broken nose.
Her 7.4 assists per game ranks fifth
in the nation and second in the Pac
-10. With a team-high 15.5 points per
contest, Sokolowska is the only
Golden Bear with a shot at all-con
ference honors but averages over six
turnovers a game.
Freshman center Jennie Leander
has filled in admirably with 7.4 re
bounds per game, tops among con
ference freshmen. Senior Kerri Bar
rett also ranks seventh in the league
in boards.
As of late, senior swing player
Kelley Tatum has provided instant
offense, with 104 points in her last
six games and a return to the start
ing lineup. Tatum and Barrett are
the only two current Cal players to
have defeated Stanford. Whether
anybody (including Foster) will be
around next year who has topped
Stanford remains to be seen.
