# Men's tennis heads to La Jolla
## Stanford to compete in Pacific Coast Doubles Tournament 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
This weekend, for the first time in over a year, the
No. 1-ranked Stanford men's tennis team heads into
competition following a loss. Not having played since
they were upset by No. 2 UCLA in the finals of the
National Indoor Championships last Sunday, the
Cardinal players will compete in the Pacific Coast
Doubles Tournament this Friday through Sunday in
La Jolla, Calif.
Stanford's top three teams will consist of the
same pairs that competed in Kentucky: senior Jeff
Salzenstein and freshman Ryan Wolters; senior Jim
Thomas and sophomore Paul Goldstein; and senior
Ricky Becker and junior Grant Elliott. Sophomores
Misha Palecek and Charles Hoeveler will also be
making the trip down south.
The tourney is a doubles-only event — not a team
event — and features mostly collegiate players, al
though a few high school and professional players
will also participate.
Head coach Dick Gould is excited about the
chance for his doubles teams to get some much
needed work against top-notch opponents. "This is
one of the strongest draws I've seen in the past 10 or
15 years," he said. "It should be great competition
for our guys."
Sophomore Paul Goldstein, who won the tourna
ment last year with partner Scott Humphries, said
that the tournament has a more low-key atmos
phere about it as compared to high-pressure dual
match situations. "It's a pretty laid back weekend,
but it does give us a great opportunity to get used to
the guys we're playing with," he said. "I think the
match play we get in La Jolla will help us earn the
doubles point later on in the season."
Goldstein's partner, Thomas, also looks forward
to a less strenuous chance to play tennis. Thomas,
who has relatives in the area, said, "This is a fun
tournament for us. It's a good time to get some need
ed work on our doubles in a fun situation."
Although the draw will not be made official until

later, Gould expects the team of
Salzenstein and Wolters to be
named somewhere between a two
and four-seed in the event. He also
expects Thomas and Goldstein to
be seeded somewhere above 12 in
the event.
Salzenstein and Wolters have
only recently begun playing with
one another, but they have
jumped out to a 4-1 record against
some very good opposition. They
beat the No. 1 team in the country
in only their third match as a
team, and suffered their only loss
against — a heartbreaker
at 9-7.
Wolters, currently the nation's
top-ranked collegiate player, said
Salzenstein is among the best

partners he has ever played with.
"It's pretty darn easy playing
with Salzy," he said. "lie has a
great serve, terrific volleys, and he
nails almost all of his returns. It's
easy to look good when you're
playing with him."
Goldstein and Thomas have
looked very promising together as
well. The two won the Northern
California regional tournament
earlier this year and knocked off
the top-seeded team in the Rolex
Indoor Championships in Dallas
three weeks ago.
Gould is also looking forward to
seeing Palecek and 1 loeveler in ac
tion. The two sophomores are
non-starters and see limited
match play during the season.
"We're just going down there to
have some fun and to play some
good tennis," Palecek said. "I'm
excited to get some matches in, es
pecially in doubles."

Hoeveler expects to come out
strong, perhaps surprising a few of
the higher-seeded teams. "Misha
and I are playing really well togeth
er, and our confidence is way up.
We're going to be looking to pull a
few upsets out there," he said.
All in all, the Pacific Coast tour
ney should prove to be a relatively
relaxing opportunity for the Stan
ford squad to brush up on the finer
points of its doubles game. "It's a
great tournament to play after
(the National Indoor Champi
onships]," Becker said. "Of course
we want to win, but there is not as
much pressure as there is in dual
matches."
"Our top priority is to stay
healthy," Gould said. "Second, we
want to be sure that we have a
strong showing. We've been in the
blood-and-guts dual match scene
for a while now, and the different
setting will be nice."
