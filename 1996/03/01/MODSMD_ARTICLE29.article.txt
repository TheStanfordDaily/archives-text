# Men's tennis heads to La Jolla
## Stanford to compete in Pacific Coast Doubles Tournament 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
This weekend, for the first time in over a year, the
No. 1-ranked Stanford men's tennis team heads into
competition following a loss. Not having played since
they were upset by No. 2 UCLA in the finals of the
National Indoor Championships last Sunday, the
Cardinal players will compete in the Pacific Coast
Doubles Tournament this Friday through Sunday in
La Jolla, Calif.
Stanford's top three teams will consist of the
same pairs that competed in Kentucky: senior Jeff
Salzenstein and freshman Ryan Wolters; senior Jim
Thomas and sophomore Paul Goldstein; and senior
Ricky Becker and junior Grant Elliott. Sophomores
Misha Palecek and Charles Hoeveler will also be
making the trip down south.
The tourney is a doubles-only event — not a team
event — and features mostly collegiate players, al
though a few high school and professional players
will also participate.
Head coach Dick Gould is excited about the
chance for his doubles teams to get some much
needed work against top-notch opponents. "This is
one of the strongest draws I've seen in the past 10 or
15 years," he said. "It should be great competition
for our guys."
Sophomore Paul Goldstein, who won the tourna
ment last year with partner Scott Humphries, said
that the tournament has a more low-key atmos
phere about it as compared to high-pressure dual
match situations. "It's a pretty laid back weekend,
but it does give us a great opportunity to get used to
the guys we're playing with," he said. "I think the
match play we get in La Jolla will help us earn the
doubles point later on in the season."
Goldstein's partner, Thomas, also looks forward
to a less strenuous chance to play tennis. Thomas,
who has relatives in the area, said, "This is a fun
tournament for us. It's a good time to get some need
ed work on our doubles in a fun situation."
Although the draw will not be made official until
