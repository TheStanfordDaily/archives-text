# Parties opt out of COP contest
## Leaders cite political bickering 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Neither of the ASSU Senate's
two political parties will run a
slate for the Council of Presidents
in this spring's general election.
However, two independent slates
declared their candidacy yester
day.

Two Peo
ple's Platform
party members
have joined an
independent
COP slate. Al
though slate or-

ganizers originally intended to
seek the endorsement of the
party, they decided against it yes
terday.
Deputy Senate Chair Bill Shen,
the independent slate's spokes
man, said "in the past, party poli
tics has been very divisive. . . .
Our decision is based on our de
sire to diffuse party politics,

which does nothing to serve stu
dent concerns."
Shen and current undergradu
ate senator Angela Parker, both
party members, will join sopho
more Ben Decker and junior
Jason Stephenson on the slate.
"They're trying to broaden
their appeal by claiming they're
independent, but the fact is that
the slate consists of [Shen and
Parker], two of the People's Plat
form's most outspoken leaders,"
said junior Andr6 Vanier, a
founder of Students' Alliance.
"Their independence is a facade."
Students' Alliance — formed
last winter to combat single-party
politics in Stanford's student gov
ernment — has chosen to focus its
efforts on electing senators rather
than finding representation in the
COP, following its belief that the
COP is less influential than the
senate itself, Vanier said.

"The Students' Alliance has
decided to concentrate on the sen
ate races because that's where we
believe the ASSU can have the
most impact," said Vanier, one of
two voting Alliance senators.
"The real action goes on in the
senate and in the financial man
ager's office. These are the
branches that affect student life.
The COP is where the political
games are played," Vanier said.
"We believe that the only way to
change that is to return the focus

of student government to student
services."
Despite the outcry about party
politics in the COP, current COP
member Rich Stolz said, "It's a
misperception to blame a lot of
things on parties. It's just easier
to explain the conflicts that arise
in the senate that way."
Part of the Alliance's decision
not to run a COP slate seems to be
an attempt to focus attention on
senior Michael Slemmer's "Con
stitution '96: A New Constitution
for the ASSU," which the party
has endorsed.
The new constitution would re
place the COP with a president
and vice president, create a judi

cial branch, reduce the size of the
senate and grant voting status to
all senators.
The reform would increase sen
ators' influence in student govern
ment issues, a fact that con
tributed to the Alliance's change
of plans, said Alliance chair Robert
Windom, a freshman.
"If and when' Constitution '96'
passes, the senate will be in charge
of implementing a lot of bylaw re
forms," said Windom, who is run
ning for an Alliance senate seat.
"We think that having our sena
tors in the position of influencing
those reforms would be the best
way to effect real change."
Another independent COP

slate, "I Prefer a Single Presi
dent," will run in the spring elec
tion as a "figurehead" for the pro
posed constitutional reform, ac
cording to slate member Pete
Vlastelica.
Alliance members have offered
political advice to the"I Prefer a
Single President" slate, Vlastelica
said. The slate consists of Vlastel
ica, fellow freshmen Joe Pawson
and David Gundelman and sopho
more Steve Liu.
Shen said though ASSU reform
was "most likely to be a dominat
ing issue of the campaign, there is
much more to the election."
Today is the deadline for COP
slates to declare their candidacy.
