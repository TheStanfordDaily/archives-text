# Parties opt out of COP contest
## Leaders cite political bickering 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Neither of the ASSU Senate's
two political parties will run a
slate for the Council of Presidents
in this spring's general election.
However, two independent slates
declared their candidacy yester
day.

Two Peo
ple's Platform
party members
have joined an
independent
COP slate. Al
though slate or-

ganizers originally intended to
seek the endorsement of the
party, they decided against it yes
terday.
Deputy Senate Chair Bill Shen,
the independent slate's spokes
man, said "in the past, party poli
tics has been very divisive. . . .
Our decision is based on our de
sire to diffuse party politics,

which does nothing to serve stu
dent concerns."
Shen and current undergradu
ate senator Angela Parker, both
party members, will join sopho
more Ben Decker and junior
Jason Stephenson on the slate.
"They're trying to broaden
their appeal by claiming they're
independent, but the fact is that
the slate consists of [Shen and
Parker], two of the People's Plat
form's most outspoken leaders,"
said junior Andr6 Vanier, a
founder of Students' Alliance.
"Their independence is a facade."
Students' Alliance — formed
last winter to combat single-party
politics in Stanford's student gov
ernment — has chosen to focus its
efforts on electing senators rather
than finding representation in the
COP, following its belief that the
COP is less influential than the
senate itself, Vanier said.
