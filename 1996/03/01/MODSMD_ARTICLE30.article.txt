# Gymnasts home for Chili's Invite
## 
### Keith Rabkin Contributing writer 
After splitting last week's
meets, the Stanford women's
gymnastics team is ready to chal
lenge lOth-ranked Arizona State
in the Chili's "Red Hot" Invita
tional tonight at 7:30 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion.
The Sun Devils will be looking
to improve on their 2-2 Pacific 10
Conference record when they face
off against the Cardinal tonight.
ASU has competed strongly all
season, racking up impressive
scores at every meet while com
piling an overall record of 6-3.

But Stanford is not without its
own strength. Despite a meager
0-3 record in the Pac-10 (2-4 over
all), the women have been on a
record-setting streak of late,
breaking team records in each of
their last three meets. As a team,
the 1996 Cardinal has set a new
uneven bars record with a 49.100
and tied the vault record with a
48.800. Tonight the women will
look to improve to 3-4 while gain
ing their first Pac-10 win.
Stanford head coach Lisa Izzi
has been training her gymnasts
hard for this meet, which marks
the halfway point in the 1996 sea
son. A win tonight would put the

Cardinal back in strong con
tention for the Pac-10 Champi
onships, which take place March
23 in Oregon. As usual, Izzi will
rely on the consistent efforts of
sophomore Keri Monahan and
freshmen Amy Murakami and
Tracey Kohl.
Monahan has been the team's
most dominant performer this
season. Last week against UC-
Santa Barbara, she set a new
team standard in the all-around,
posting a score of 39.300 to
eclipse the old record held by cur
rent graduate assistant Jene
Elzie. Against Georgia, Monahan
also set a new record in the vault
with a score of 9.925, besting her
own mark of 9.900 set last sea
son.
Murakami has been the sur
prise performer of the year. Re
bounding from a back injury, she
has tied the team record in the

uneven bars and consistently
vied with Monahan for the top
team score. She currently holds
the team's best performances
this season on both the balance
beam and uneven bars.
Kohl has also been a pleasant
surprise for the Cardinal, holding
down third place for the Cardinal
on almost every apparatus. Her
dedication and skill helped make
her the first freshman to place in
the all-around this year. Kohl cur
rently holds third place among

the team's top performers.
Arizona State will throw an ex
perienced team of veterans into
the mix tonight at Burnham. Sun
Devils head coach John Spini
boasts a career record of 193-68-1
and is well-known for pushing his
team to the limit, expecting noth
ing but the best performances
from his gymnasts. That drive al
lowed the Sun Devils to place sec
ond in the Pac-10 last year, an
achievement they look to top this
year with a conference title.
