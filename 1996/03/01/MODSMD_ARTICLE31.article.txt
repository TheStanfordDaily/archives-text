# Men's gymnastics at Cal
## Cardinal will compete against Bears, San Jose State 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
The Stanford men's gymnas
tics team will go up against some

of its toughest competition of the
year tonight at Cal when the men
join the Golden Bears — the only
team that has beaten them this
season — and San Jose State in a

7:30 p.m. meet at Harmon Gym.
Tonight's matchup brings the
competition tally between San
Jose and Stanford to five. The
Spartans have competed with-
Stanford in every one of its meets
this year. In fact, the three Bay
Area schools already competed
against one another at the San
Jose Open in January, and Cal
posted a score of 225.55 to out
pace Stanford's 220.45 and San
Jose's 201.3.
Despite the strong competi
tion, Stanford remains focused
on its own improvement rather
than on posting a high score.
"We know California is a for
midable opponent, but we're only
concerned with our team," said
team captain Peter Hegi. "We're
training to peak at NCAAs — to
us, it's the only meet that mat
ters. [This isj another week to see
how we're progressing. Our goal
is to have a good team showing."
