# Men's gymnastics at Cal
## Cardinal will compete against Bears, San Jose State 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
The Stanford men's gymnas
tics team will go up against some

of its toughest competition of the
year tonight at Cal when the men
join the Golden Bears — the only
team that has beaten them this
season — and San Jose State in a

7:30 p.m. meet at Harmon Gym.
Tonight's matchup brings the
competition tally between San
Jose and Stanford to five. The
Spartans have competed with-
Stanford in every one of its meets
this year. In fact, the three Bay
Area schools already competed
against one another at the San
Jose Open in January, and Cal
posted a score of 225.55 to out
pace Stanford's 220.45 and San
Jose's 201.3.
Despite the strong competi
tion, Stanford remains focused
on its own improvement rather
than on posting a high score.
"We know California is a for
midable opponent, but we're only
concerned with our team," said
team captain Peter Hegi. "We're
training to peak at NCAAs — to
us, it's the only meet that mat
ters. [This isj another week to see
how we're progressing. Our goal
is to have a good team showing."

Junior Keith Wiley and his gymnastics teammates will try to improve
on their 6-1 overall record tonight at Cal.
State and UC-Santa Barbara,
agreed with Hegi's assessment of
the team's objectives.
"It will be interesting to see
how California does and where
they are, but it has really no bear
ing on our goals right now," Wiley
said.
Cal head coach Barry Weiner
lost only one player to graduation
last year and returns two top
gymnasts in sophomore Josh
Birkelbaw and junior David
Kruse.
Hegi described the change in
the team's strategy since the loss
of sophomore Tim Dalrymple.
Dalrymple injured two vertebrae
several weeks ago, abruptly end
ing his season.
"Since Tim's injury, [head
coach Sadao Hamada] has redone
his game plan this year — our
goal [now] is to peak for NCAAs, "
Hegi said. "We're focusing on new
skills and sequences. This is the
last week to acquire new ones.
Then we will work on perfecting
them."
