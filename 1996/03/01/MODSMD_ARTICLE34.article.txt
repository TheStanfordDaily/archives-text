# All that Free Time
## 
### 
Besides ATMs and the fax machine, the
most important invention of my lifetime
has most certainly been the flip-top
toothpaste tube top. That little doohickey that
tops my Colgate tube saves me about 10 sec
onds of unscrewing and rescrewing (five on,
five off) every morning and night. If you do
the math, this works out (at a life expectancy
of 82 years) to 596.020 seconds, or about
seven free days before I die.
What am I gonna do with all this free time?
Colgate has provided me with an ADA
accepted week of freedom to live and love with
tartar-controlled teeth and minty fresh breath.
Besides saving me 40 cents on every 8.2 ounces
of fluoride protection, the Colgate-Palmolive
company has extended my time on earth.
Kinda sorta.
It was Leap Day that got me thinking
about toothpaste. (Oh. yeah, Happy Leap
Day.) Every four years, alongside the presi
dential election and the Summer Olympics,
the rotation of the Earth provides us with an
entire Free Day stuck in that tiny, little
crevice between February and March. Over 82
years, that's about 21 tiny little Free Days.
Three weeks of February 29th. Plus seven
Colgate days. The way I figure it. I've got a
whole month coming to me one of these days.
Of course, I'm not the only one with this
month on reserve — every single Colgate user
has a free month saved for them somewhere.
So I was thinking of using mine to take a
cruise. Or travel to Timbuktu and back again.
Or use that time to go to Blockbuster and rent
every Kevin Bacon movie ever made and stuff
my face with popcorn and beer. And then I

knew exactly what to do with my free month.
You see, my birthday is March 19 — 18
days from now — and I'll be turning 21, that
magic age where you can no longer display
your years on your fingers and toes, and the
age that our Great Society has deemed the
chronological threshold that must be passed
before buying fermented Russian potatoes. So
you'd figure that I should have to wait 18 days
for my Russian potatoes, right? But with a
bag of Orville Redenbacher in my hand and
the letterboxed-version of Footloose waiting
in my VCR, I decided to see if I could cash in
my free month.
The ladv at Safeway wasn't too pleased.
"You're still under 21," said Linda, who'd
been Serving Me For Three Years.
"But 1 want to use my free month nou>.
Look, if you think about it, I really turned 21
four days ago." She looked at me with a puz
zled, yet inquisitive expression between her
shiny, dangly, hoop earrings. She just couldn't
comprehend.
Damn Crest-users.
So maybe that plan didn't work. But I'm
sure there are lots of different ways for us to
use our free months. We can blow 'em com
pletely on a month-long romp in the Bahamas
or we can use 'em bit by bit. A few days here
to work on a problem set. A couple of hours
there when you're running late to an impor
tant meeting. A couple of minutes when The
Parents are on their way up to see your "first
college dorm room," and you haven't thrown
your dirty laundry and that half-filled bottle
of Schnapps under your roommate's bed yet.
Maybe we could put the free month on the

Stanford Card Plan and use our Universal
SUIDs to access the debit account.
Or maybe we should all pool our free
months. Right now, there are, by current esti
mate, about .'35 million free Colgate/Leap
months floating around worldwide. We could
save up those 2.9 million years and use them
in case of global emergencies. If the dinosaurs
had been brushing twice a day like their
mom's had said, they could have used their
time to skip a few climate changes and they
might have survived. Of course, I don't know
how much time a flip-top would save a T-Rex
in the morning.
I'm not exactly sure what I'll end up doing
with my Free Time. I guess I just hope that
when I'm ready to cash in that time, I'm not
too busy or tired to enjoy it. We keep accumu
lating all this Free Time everywhere in life:
from newfangled computers to remote con
trols to One-Hour Photo places. Let's make a
pact to recognize this Free Time when it hap
pens and save it up for later. We'll collect up
those morning and nighttime moments and
spend our Leap Days just doing what we
always do. And then, someday, we'll be given
our due in the form of about 28 days of free
dom with which we can do anything at all.
Until that time arrives, however, let's just
keep on brushing. Oh, and don't forget to
floss.
