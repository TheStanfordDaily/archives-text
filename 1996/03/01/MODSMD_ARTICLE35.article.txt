DEAR MISS CONDUCT: I
am planning on throwing a
party this Fruiay night in my
fraternity house. How many
kegs ivould you say is appropri
ate for such a festivity, and what
in the proper way to raise cam
pus awareness of our event ?
— Restless on the Row
That is a very good question.
Restless. I will answer your
questions separately. First, how
many kegs? Well, that depends
on what type of a party you are
intending to throw. If you are
hoping for a light, party-like fes
tive atmosphere, 1 would say
about 24' to 5$ people per keg is
average. If, however you are
intending to get shit-faced and
hook up with a nameless frosh
person in a drunken stupor,
then the average should be
nearer to about eight to 10 peo
ple per keg.
As far as campus awareness
goes, the proper etiquette
involves "fliering" the campus by
posting publicity signs at various
outlets on campus. To keep with
the social norm, your flyer should
be 8 1 / 2" X 11" and printed on
any one of a number of bright,
fluorescent colors and the word
"BEER" should be prominently

displayed. Some
times a properly
placed expletive
in 36-point Hel
vetica or Palati
no will add just

the right touch for your party's
publicity. Although state regula
tions require the words "Must
be 21 to drink*' to appear, make
sure that they are written very
small as not to dissuade poten
tial partygoers.
DEAR MISS CONDUCT:
There is a really cute guy in my
GW section. 1 don't know his
phone number! What should 1
do?
— iMvesick in iMg
Hey Lovesick ~ don't be! If
you have your beloved's name,
this one's a snap! A call to your
friendly Stanford operator
should do the trick — just dial
"0." Ask politely and use your
beau-to-be's first and last name.
The operator will probably give
you the full phone number
(seven digits), but if it's a num
ber on campus, you can just use
the last five from your dorm
room phone. If all else fails, just
follow him home from class.
Good luck — go get him!
