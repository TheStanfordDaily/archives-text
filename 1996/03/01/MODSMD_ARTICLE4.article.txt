# Campus crime rate remained steady in 1995

The number of crimes reported on cam
pus remained fairly steady last year, accord
ing to the annual crime report released
Wednesday by Stanford Police.
The report shows a decrease in burglary
and theft, a slight increase in sexual offenses
and a relatively steady level of total arrests.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
said in comparison to former years, he "does
not see a lot of change in regards to crime on
the Stanford campus. I fail to see any domi
nant trends."
The report serves to remind the student
population that Stanford is not an isolated
fortress, Herrington said.
"Students oflen get lulled into feeling that
Stanford has a fence around it,"he said. "We
need to remember that we are as vulnerable
here as elsewhere."
The report divides crimes reported in
1995 according to the categories that the fed
eral government requires to be released to
the public.

Last year saw a continuation of the de
crease in number of bike thefts, a trend that
started in 1993. Nearly 550 bikes were stolen
last year, as com pa rod to 643 in 1994.
However, burglaries from buildings on
campus have increased, from 175 in 1994 to
196 in 1995.
Grand theft, a term applicable to felony
thefts of items worth more than $500, de
creased, from 240 in 1994 to 212 in 1995.
Motor vehicle theft also decreased. Twen
ty stolen cars were reported in 1994, while
1995 witnessed 14.
Herrington said he does not see this as a
"downward trend" because the fluctuations
are statistically insignificant. He attributed
the decrease in stolen cars to the stronger car
locks of newer models and the greater num
ber of car alarms.
Sexual offenses increased slightly, from
eight in 1994 to 14 reported in 1995.
These figures include all reported offenses
on campus, whether directly to police, coun
selors or resident assistants. Unless a victim

wants to press charges, police are
only given statistical information
about a sexual offense.
According to the crime report, all
but one of the sex offenses reported
to University counselors were com
mitted by acquaintances of the vic
tim.
Most categories remained rela
tively stable.
Total arrests, both felony and
misdemeanor, increased by only
seven.
Vandalism and arson fluctuated
only slightly, as did liquor law viola
tions, which numbered 31 last year.

These violations include possession
of alcohol by minors and public dis
plays of intoxication, but not drunk
driving.
Arrests for driving under the in
fluence of intoxicating liquor or
drugs doubled last year from 16 to
32. However, in the context of
1993, when the police apprehended
45 cases of drunk driving, the in
crease is not a trend, Herrington
said.
The crime report counts a single
hate crime for all of 1995, referring
to an incident on Feb. 25 at the Hi
sexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance's
yearly Genderfuk party.
Five juvenile males allegedly
shouted offensive homophobic slurs
outside the party. Police were able
to charge the individuals with per

petrating a hate crime because they
had challenged people to fight. Ac
cording to California's penal code,
an attempt to incite violence vio
lates an individual's civil rights be
cause it resorts to threats of force or
intimidation.
The annual crime report is made
available in the hopes that the pub
lic will "have some idea of what is
going on," said Herrington. As far
as its purpose for the police depart
ment, Herrington said he usually
looks "at the development of figures
. .. month by month."
"Relatively speaking, Stanford is
a safe place. However, anyone can
come on campus, and we get a lot of
visitors. We need to take the same
precautions here as anywhere else,"
he said.
