The number of crimes reported on cam
pus remained fairly steady last year, accord
ing to the annual crime report released
Wednesday by Stanford Police.
The report shows a decrease in burglary
and theft, a slight increase in sexual offenses
and a relatively steady level of total arrests.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
said in comparison to former years, he "does
not see a lot of change in regards to crime on
the Stanford campus. I fail to see any domi

The report serves to remind the student
population that Stanford is not an isolated

campus have increased, from 175 in 1994 to
196 in 1995.

Motor vehicle theft also decreased. Twen
ty stolen cars were reported in 1994, while
1995 witnessed 14.
Herrington said he does not see this as a
"downward trend" because the fluctuations
are statistically insignificant. He attributed
the decrease in stolen cars to the stronger car
locks of newer models and the greater num
ber of car alarms.
Sexual offenses increased slightly, from
eight in 1994 to 14 reported in 1995.
These figures include all reported offenses
on campus, whether directly to police, coun
selors or resident assistants. Unless a victim
