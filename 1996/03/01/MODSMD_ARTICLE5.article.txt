# Law students worried about diversity
## 
### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
In an often emotional meeting,
Law School faculty responded to stu
dents' concerns about efforts to im
prove diversity in the professorial
ranks.
The Faculty Appointments Com
mittee "has made diversity the most
important part of our work," said Law

Prof. Kathleen Sullivan at the meet
ing attended by about 100 students.
"We regard [it] with the highest prior
ity."
Law School Dean Paul Brest noted
that there are two criteria for appoint
ing faculty that there is "no contro
versy about:" general excellence in the
legal profession and diversity.
Nevertheless, students pointed out
that only two of the approximately 40

tenured faculty are persons of color.
But Brest said there are other minori
ty faculty who are on a tenure track.
The number of women and minori
ties among Law School faculty has in
creased during the last five years. In
1990, women made up 14 percent of
the faculty and minorities constituted
12 percent. In 1995, those numbers
were 25 percent and 15 percent, re
spectively.

Compared to her experience at
Harvard, Sullivan said, Stanford has
"achieved a good healthy critical mass
of women."
Since 1993, seven permanent offers
have been extended to new faculty
members, four of those to women and
two to minorities. Twenty-three visit
ing professor offers, which are used to
recruit faculty from other universi-
ties, have been made — eight to
women and four to minorities.
However, only two of the eight
who accepted visiting professor
positions were women; none were
minorities.
Sullivan mentioned several
difficulties faced in increasing the
number of racial minorities. It is
very difficult to get some people
to leave the urban areas where
they have worked to come to the
suburbs of Palo Alto, she said. To
deal with this, she said, Brest has
even extended housing assistance
to those who would like to live in
San Francisco.
Also, some people do not want
to leave the East Coast for the
West, Sullivan said.
As a result of these two factors,
Stanford loses potential faculty to
competitors like Harvard and Yale.

Sullivan also suggested that
some individuals have promising
careers in government and prac
tice that they would not exchange
for academia. "We're competing
with Harvard, Yale, the United
States government and the top
law firms around the country,"
she said.
Students at the meeting sug
gested that searches for new pro
fessors be widened in light of the
competition. "We should be look
ing at other places," said second
year student Mary Wu, president
of the Asian and Pacific Islander
Law Students Association.
But both Sullivan and Brest
responded that the minority pool
to select from is still quite small,
making for tough competition.
A number of students also sug
gested that minority recruitment
efforts might be hampered by an
image in the legal community
that the Law School has not treat
ed faculty of color very well. Brest
responded that he has not re

ceived any indications of such
sentiment.
Brest also addressed the role of
affirmative action in the minority
recruitment process.
Emphasizing that "we ought
to be more willing to take a risk"
with minorities when making
tenure-track offers, he said some
minorities with fewer scholarly
publications are sometimes made
offers. However, stressing the
"importance of being the very
best," he said the standard for
granting tenure is the same for
everyone.
Regardless of the reason for
low minority representation, sev
eral students said something
must be done to improve the rep
resentation of minorities among
the professoriate. "If this was a
crisis in fund-raising, we'd have
found a solution," said Wu.
She added, "We (students) re
ally don't want to be rabble-rous
ing, but we feel we have to. The
faculty thinks we enjoy this."
