Skyrocketing phone bills.
Lonely Valentine's days. Tempta
tions to cheat. Long-distance rela
tionships have their drawbacks,
but some Stanford students say
they are worth the trouble.
Junior Josh Messina met his
boyfriend, Ryan — a senior at Uni
versity of Notre Dame — back
home. They shared both a friend
ship and homecoming kingships
in high school, but didn't start dat
ing until last summer.
"I couldn't let my mom down.
She wanted my sister to date
him," joked Josh, who said he is bi
sexual.
Sharing a similar background
made the choice to keep up a rela
tionship easier for Josh.

"I know this person. We're
from the same town. We grew up
together and have a history to
gether. It makes it a stronger
bond. He's beautiful. He's really
sweet."
Junior Tara Narula has been
keeping up a long-distance rela
tionship with her boyfriend of one
year, Ben. He began studying in
Berlin this quarter and will be
abroad through summer.
Tara and Josh initially said
there are no benefits of a long-dis
tance relationship, but both even
tually admitted that it gives them
more time for other activities.
"The only benefit I see is that at
school, I'm really busy and it takes
some of the pressure off. You're
not always evaluating the rela

tionship," Josh said.
"The only benefit is that we've
been going out for a year and him
being gone gives me more time to go
out with my girlfriends and do other
things," Tara agreed.
Another benefit was hesitatingly
offered by freshman Tiare Cross,
who Is also involved in a long-dis
tance relationship.
"Other people tell me we appreci
ate each other more," she said,
rolling her eyes.
Tiare met her boyfriend, Scott —
who lives in Washington — when
he came to visit his friend Loren,
who was Tiare's dormmate, last fall.
"We were sitting in the infa
mous Burbank lounge. He had
Cocoa Puffs. I wanted some. It was
all over," Tiare said. Now, Scott
comes to Burbank to visit Tiare, not
Loren.
Deciding to try a long-distance re
lationship wasn'teasy.Tiaresaid. "It
was pretty hard. There was no way
we'd even be in the same zip code."
Tiare said she felt that she'd be
"missing out" if she avoided the rela
tionship just because of distance.
"You have to be willing to take a
risk," she said.
Temptation to cheat and the re
sulting jealousy are issues in any
long-distance relationship, but
Josh, Tara and Tiare have all
learned to deal with it.
"It's not easy because we're
young and we're in college, but it
was difficult enough to find Ben and
I can't imagine finding someone

else," Tara said, citing her own
"pickiness."
She and Ben do get jealous at
times, though, Tara said.
"We both get kind of jealous.
He'll write me that he went to Paris
dancing, and I get jealous. Then I'll
tell him that I went to a Phi Delt
party, and he'll get jealous," she
said.
Tiare said she has not been par
ticularly tempted to date anyone
else, but she has had trouble con
vincing guys that she is involved
with someone else.
"They're like, 'Oh yeah, you have
a boyfriend in Washington, oh
yeah,' " she said.
"I've had a couple people who
were interested in me and a couple I
was attracted to and wanted to pur
sue," Josh said. "It's a lot of remem
bering and playing off old memo
ries. There's an angel and a devil on
both sides."
Because of the distance and pos
sible jealousy, Josh said he's learned
to overcome his insecurities.
"You have to have decent self-es
teem because there's always the
question of what the other person's
doing," he said.
Communication is also a big
issue for Josh, Tara and Tiare.
"I write a lot, but I'm an English
major," Josh said, adding that e
mail is another popular option. He
and Ryan also call every two days.
"It's nice hearing that person's
voice and remembering why," he
said.
Josh said their conversations can
be frustrating though. "You end up
repeating these anecdotes from the
week and it's hard to get anything
more significant," he said.

Tar a said her pattern of commu
nication has been to write e-mail
every day and talk on the phone
every two weeks.
Tiare said she uses the chat fea
ture on the Internet and that "the
phone bills are pretty high."
Visits are some of the highlights
of long-distance relationships.
Tiare said when she and Scott are
together, "It doesn't matter what
we do."
Josh said visits can be somewhat
traumatic though. "I get kind of
scared. It's like getting used to the
person again. It's hard to have ex
pectations," he said.
Josh will not be able to spend the
summer with Ryan because Ryan
will be studying in Ecuador. Josh
said he has learned that self-sacri
fice is a key to maintaining a long
distance relationship.
"Being a student, you're so con
cerned with yourself and where
you're going. With a long-distance
relationship, you put the other per
son ahead of you and let them go
0n.... I don't want to close off this
person, like from going to Ecuador."
One question remains — what
did these couples do for Valentine's
Day?
Scott came to visit Tiare the next
weekend.
Tara experienced Valentine's
Day through the mail. "He sent me
roses. I mailed him a package. There
were so many years when I didn't
have a valentine, it's not that hard,"
she said.
Perhaps Josh had the best
Valentine's Day. "We spent the day
in his room. It was a nice Valen
tine's Day. He's a cool boyfriend,"
he said.
