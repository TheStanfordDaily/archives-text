photographs of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a
wheelchair to the overpublicizing of Gennifer Flowers'
allegations that President Clinton was involved in an
extramarital affair with her.
She also connected the media's coverage of politics

agreement not to tell the public about the president's
personal sexual behavior," said Goodman. With a slo

private conduct of its elected officials, she added.
