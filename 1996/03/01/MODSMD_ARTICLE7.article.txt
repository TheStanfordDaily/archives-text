# 'Up close and too personal'
## Ellen Goodman ponders politics 
### Alex Scherbakovsky Contributing writer 
Renowned Boston Globe columnist and Pulitzer
Prize-winner Ellen Goodman cautioned against the
media's ever-increasing fascination with politicians'
private lives in a speech yesterday.
Speaking on "Politics: Up Close and Too Person
al" in front of a packed and enthusiastic Kresge Au
ditorium crowd, Goodman argued that journalism's
focus on private lives rather than the politicians'
stands on issues is leaving the American public alien
ated from the political process.
"We have become more familiar, more close to
public figures but in the process brought the institu
tion down," said Goodman.
Journalism in the past few decades has come full
circle from alienating the public by completely ignor
ing politicians' private lives to shoving private details
down the throats of the American electorate, she
said.
Goodman illustrated the drastic change in the
media's treatment of politics by comparing the lack of
photographs of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a
wheelchair to the overpublicizing of Gennifer Flowers'
allegations that President Clinton was involved in an
extramarital affair with her.
She also connected the media's coverage of politics
to the fluctuations in the gender gap within the
media itself.
"When I began writing, there was a gentleman's
agreement not to tell the public about the president's
personal sexual behavior," said Goodman. With a slo
gan "personal is political," journalism's feminist ele
ment began informing the American public about
private conduct of its elected officials, she added.
The pendulum, she said, has swung too far. In
stead of achieving a happy medium, journalism im
mersed itself in the politicians' private lives, and the
overblown personal incidents
began to overshadow political is
sues.
"Television journalism has be
come entertainment," she ob
served.
Goodman further stipulated

that media programs such as
CNN's "Crossfire" that don't fully
explore all sides of an issue have
created political figures such as
presidential candidate Patrick
Buchanan.
"I regard Pat Buchanan as a
petri dish conception, an embryo
created from the sperm of sound
bite politics," said Goodman.
Goodman also said despite the

popular opinion that the gender
gap in the media is shrinking, the
separation of the sexes manifests
itself in males' domination of
radio talk shows that discuss pol
itics, while women are relegated
to televised talk shows that focus
on "private" topics such as adul
tery.
In what she called "the new
gender gap," Goodman argued

that "the female world is again
personal, the male political — seg
regated as ever."
Goodman concluded her
speech by offering a few guide
lines for improving journalism.
She reminded her fellow jour
nalists in the audience of the im
portance of self-restraint and
urged them to "encourage people
to know more, not less."
