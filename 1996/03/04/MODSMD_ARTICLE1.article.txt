## New article considers cholesterol screening 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Young adults should not have their
cholesterol levels regularly screened, ac
cording to new guidelines published Fri
day by a physicians' organization and
written in part by a Stanford professor.
The American College of Physicians,
which represents 85,000 doctors of inter
nal medicine, published a set of recom
mendations in the Annals of Internal
Medicine saying, among other things,
that "screening for total cholesterol levels
is not recommended" for men under 35
years of age and women under 45.
Screening at about five-year intervals
is still "recommended but not mandato
ry" for men between 35 and 65, women
between 45 and 65 and all adults who
have a family history of heart problems or
have a high level of other risk factors such
as smoking, the article said.

Citing Insufficient evidence, the article
makes no recommendation for people be
tween 65 and 75, but screening is specifi
cally not recommended for those over 75.
These guidelines are at odds with those
advocated by other physicians' groups, in
cluding the American Heart Association,
which has issued a statement disagreeing
with the new findings.
Alan Garber, associate professor of
medicine, authored the article in collabo
ration with Warren Browner, an associ
ate professor of medicine at UC-San
Francisco.
Garber said he is concerned that too
much testing might result in overuse of
cholesterol-reducing drugs. This is partic
ularly likely in cases where diet and exer
cise fail to bring down cholesterol levels,
whether patients are genetically unre
sponsive to diet restrictions or because
patients fail to stick to diets and exercise
