## New article considers cholesterol screening 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Young adults should not have their
cholesterol levels regularly screened, ac
cording to new guidelines published Fri
day by a physicians' organization and
written in part by a Stanford professor.
The American College of Physicians,
which represents 85,000 doctors of inter
nal medicine, published a set of recom
mendations in the Annals of Internal
Medicine saying, among other things,
that "screening for total cholesterol levels
is not recommended" for men under 35
years of age and women under 45.
Screening at about five-year intervals
is still "recommended but not mandato
ry" for men between 35 and 65, women
between 45 and 65 and all adults who
have a family history of heart problems or
have a high level of other risk factors such
as smoking, the article said.

Citing Insufficient evidence, the article
makes no recommendation for people be
tween 65 and 75, but screening is specifi
cally not recommended for those over 75.
These guidelines are at odds with those
advocated by other physicians' groups, in
cluding the American Heart Association,
which has issued a statement disagreeing
with the new findings.
Alan Garber, associate professor of
medicine, authored the article in collabo
ration with Warren Browner, an associ
ate professor of medicine at UC-San
Francisco.
Garber said he is concerned that too
much testing might result in overuse of
cholesterol-reducing drugs. This is partic
ularly likely in cases where diet and exer
cise fail to bring down cholesterol levels,
whether patients are genetically unre
sponsive to diet restrictions or because
patients fail to stick to diets and exercise
plans, he said.
Garber explained that these
drugs, which are mostly available
by prescription, have been found
to cause cancer in laboratory ani
mals.
While it is not clear what this
means for human beings, Garber
said some of the drugs are danger
ous to animals in levels of expo
sure that are only slightly greater
than those a physician might pre
scribe a patient.
While still strongly advocating
that people follow a low-fat diet
and not smoke, Garber said the
importance of cholesterol levels
for the health of young adults has
been somewhat overestimated.
"When you're talking about
young people without other risk
factors, cholesterol is unimpor
tant," he explained, saying that
"cholesterol screening is not at the
top of the list" of health concerns
for people in their 20s and 30s.
Assoc. Medicine Prof. Stephen
Fortmann, who is part of a group
at the Medical Center that is
working to prevent heart disease
within the Stanford community,
disagreed with this view of choles
terol's importance.
"They're not looking at the
public health aspect [of screen

ing]," Fortmann said, adding that
the clinical trials on which the
new guidelines are based do not
take into account the effect regu
lar screening may have on a com
munity as a whole.
He explained that while choles
terol is not always the best indica
tor of an individual patient's
chances of developing heart prob
lems, the overall level of a com
munity is a valuable indicator of
the probability of "epidemic car
dio-vascular disease" breaking
out there.
"Relatively small changes in
the mean cholesterol level [of a
group of people] can have a large
effect on how many people get
heart disease," Fortmann ex
plained.
He said regular screening is
also useful for keeping people
aware and concerned about the
risk of heart disease.
"The risk to me [of the new
guidelines]," Fortmann said, "is
that you send a message that peo
ple don't need to watch their diet,
that it isn't important."
On the question of the danger
of drugs, Fortmann said, "I think
there's a potential for overuse,
but it doesn't frighten me as
much as it frightens [Garber]."
Fortmann also said Garber ap
peared to be assuming that people
would be unwilling to change
their diet and exercise habits and
would therefore be quick to seek

medication. Fortmann disagreed
with this assumption.
While agreeing that the "cost
effectiveness" of testing young
people may be questionable, Fort
mann still said the new guidelines
underestimate the usefulness of
such testing.
What the new guidelines will
mean for patients is not clear.
Fortmann said the Medical Cen
ter has no overall policy on
screening. Individual doctors de
termine and follow guidelines of
their own choosing and are not
bound by the new recommenda
tions or those of the American
Heart Association, which recom
mends regular testing of all
adults, he said.
Many people at Stanford have
a regular cholesterol test when
they give blood. Caryn Huberman
at the Stanford Medical School
Blood Center said all blood donors
are tested for their overall choles
terol.
She explained that a more de
tailed test which would give levels
of all the various kinds of choles
terol is not possible because it re
quires a patient not to eat for a pe
riod before testing, and blood
donors need to eat a meal within a
few hours before giving blood.
The only action that the Blood
Center takes regarding choles
terol tests is to advise patients
with high levels to consult their
physician, Huberman said.
