## GOP rivals look south Candidates trying to court Georgia conservatives 
### 
ATLANTA (AP) — Steve Forbes, Pat
Buchanan and Lamar Alexander courted
Georgia conservatives yesterday with
promises to support prayer in schools as
they staged a televised debate and looked
to deny Southern momentum to absent
GOP presidential leader Bob Dole.
The hourlong WSB-TV debate was a
relatively staid affair, with a few con
tentious exchanges but nothing rivaling
the bristling encounters of recent
debates in Arizona and South Carolina.
"This is charity night," Forbes said at
one point, after Alexander, using an
opportunity to question his rivals, asked
Forbes to name one thing he liked about
the Alexander and Buchanan cam
paigns.
Not that there weren't disagreements
as the three sought an edge — and a for
mula to slow Dole — heading into Tues
day's "Junior Tuesday" voting in Geor
gia and nine other states.
Forbes and Alexander, for example,
took issue with Buchanan's call for tar
iffs on Chinese and other foreign-made
goods, arguing they would amount to tax
increases for American consumers but
do nothing to create new jobs to replace
those that are eliminated or shipped
overseas in the changing global econo
my.
"We're right about this," Alexander
said. "You're wrong about this."
Forbes and Buchanan also had a few

pointed exchanges. Defending his trade
policies, Buchanan suggested Forbes
should better understand the historical
use of tariffs. "I'm surprised you didn't
study this up at Princeton or that little
prep school you went to," Buchanan said
derisively to the publishing heir.
Later, a panelist read criticism of
Buchanan that Forbes made earlier in
New York and asked Forbes if he wanted
to confront his rival in person. Forbes
appeared a bit uncomfortable with the
question, but did say he found
Buchanan newspaper columns defend
ing suspected Nazi war criminals objec
tionable.
Buchanan defended his writings and
said: "I am a controversial columnist
because I will say things that others will
not say."
Dole skipped the debate after spend
ing a day campaigning in Maryland,
ignoring his Republican rivals to target
President Clinton.
"We've got a veto coming. We're
going to veto President Clinton in
November," Dole told cheering support
ers at a fairgrounds rally.
Buchanan took the sharpest aim at
Dole, and for good reason: South Caroli
na polls showed the two men split the
votes of Christian conservative voters in
Saturday's primary. Buchanan needs to
do better if he hopes to upset Dole here
in Georgia on Tuesday.
