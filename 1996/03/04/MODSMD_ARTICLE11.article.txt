Whitewater trial to begin
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — President Clinton's Whitewater
partners and his successor as Arkansas governor go on trial today in
a case that could determine the weight of the political millstone Clin
ton has worn since Whitewater emerged as a campaign issue in 1992.
Clinton has been subpoenaed to testify, although whether he
must take the witness stand in person has not been decided.
Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, former financier James McDougal and his ex
wife, Susan McDougal, face fraud and conspiracy charges in a 21-count
indictment returned by the Whitewater grand jury last summer.
Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Stair alleges the defendants benefit
ed illegally from nearly $3 million in loans from federally backed banks.

Sex offenders target kids
WASHINGTON (AP) — Two-thirds of sex offenders in state prisons
attacked children, and a third of these victims were offspring or
stepchildren of their attackers, the Justice Department reported yes
terday.
In a report based on the largest survey ever of state prison
inmates, the department said children under age 18 bear the brunt
of sex offenses and that child molesting remains a crime most often
perpetrated by relatives and acquaintances rather than strangers.
The department's Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that
state prisons held 43,552 inmates in 1991 who raped or sexually
assaulted children under 18.
