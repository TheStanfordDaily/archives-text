# Conservatives win Spanish elections

### 
MADRID, Spain (AP) — A con
servative party with roots in the
Franco dictatorship won Spain's
general elections yesterday, ending
the 13-year rule of the scandal
plagued Socialist party.
Jose Maria Aznar, leader of the
Popular Party, told thousands of
followers in a victory speech that he
would represent "all Spain" as
prime minister and pledged to offer
"a hand held out in tolerance."
Socialist Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez, whose government had
ushered a modern Spain onto the
world stage, congratulated the Pop
ular Party, which despite its origins
is now widely regarded as center
right.
"We will be a rigorous but
responsible opposition (party)," a
sweating Gonzalez told followers at
party headquarters. He clutched a
rose, the Socialists' trademark.
Although victorious, the Popu

lar Party was short about 20 seats
from winning an absolute majority
in the powerful 350-seat lower
house of parliament. That means
the conservatives must form
alliances with other groups in order
to pass legislation.
With 99 percent of the vote
counted, the election commission
said the Popular Party was winning
157 seats to the Socialists' 140
seats. The Communist-led United
Left had 21 seats. Convergence and
Union, a coalition from northeast
Spain's Catalonia region, won 16.
Seven small regional parties split
the remaining 16 seats.
The party with the most seats
gets to form a government and
choose a prime minister.
"I am very pleased to announce
the Popular Party has won the elec
tion," party campaign director
Mariano Rajoy declared after vot
ing ended.
