# Israel declares war on Islamic militants

### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel
declared all-out war yesterday on
the militant Islamic group Hamas
after a suicide bomber blew apart
a second bus in Jerusalem in just
one week.
The blast, which scattered body
parts and pieces of twisted metal
yards from the explosion site, killed
19 people, including the bomber,
and threw the future of Mideast
peacemaking into question.
Prime Minister Shimon Peres
demanded that Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat do more to combat
terrorism. He said if Arafat did
not comply, negotiations with the
Palestinians on a final peace
agreement would not start in May
as scheduled.

"There are no negotiations
with the Palestinians," a grim
Peres told a news conference.
"There are only our demands to
the Palestinians."
Israel is "engaged in total war
against Hamas and other terror
ist organizations," said Peres, a
dove who will be hard-pressed to
prevail over a right-wing rival in
May 29 elections.
Arafat condemned the bomb
ing as a "serious and dangerous
terrorist act" and outlawed all
armed Palestinian groups. The
Hamas offshoot that claimed
responsibility announced a three
month moratorium on attacks so
long as Israel does not crack down
on Hamas.
