## Cookies with Casper 
### 
President and students
must ensure that chat
session is worthwhile

Students at Stanford
are fond of complaining
about the inaccessibility of
top administrators. People such as
University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice, they say, are difficult — if
not impossible — to get in touch
with and appear to be generally
uninterested in student view
points and concerns.
While there may be some
ground for such complaints — and
this page has certainly been
among those loudly voicing them
— it is necessary to acknowledge
when Casper and Rice do respond
to student concerns.
Such is the case with the event
"Tea and More Cookies with Ger
hard Casper," scheduled for this
afternoon. Billed as a chance for
"students to meet with President
Casper and discuss life at Stan
ford," this event represents a real
effort on Casper's part to become
more accessible and responsive to
students.
The simple fact that Casper has
agreed to take part in this event
indicates a certain level of respon
siveness to students: They have
long clamored for more face-to
face opportunities to meet with
the president.
Furthermore, Casper also plans
to hold a similar event spring
quarter ("Yet More Cookies"?),
and Dean of Students Marc Wais
has said if both go well, Casper is
willing to hold regular monthly
meet-the-students events next
year.
Stretching this event into a reg
ular series is both laudable and
appropriate. The University's
president should be in regular
contact with its students, and stu
dents should know that they have

regularly scheduled accessibility
to their president.
Accordingly, students have a
significant obligation to make
sure that this afternoon's event is,
in fact, a success. Having demand
ed that Casper allot more time to
interaction with students —
whether it be for the noble cause
of ascertaining their needs and
concerns or for the only-slightly
less-noble cause of schmoozing —
the student body must ensure
that those calls have not been hol
low and that Casper's efforts this
afternoon are not for naught.
Simply, this means that stu
dents must show up. Having
demanded presidential interaction
on a theoretical level, students
must take advantage of it on a
practical level. Doing so will not
only show Casper that today's
event is worth his time, but that
he should continue this worth
while endeavor.
At the same time, however,
Casper also has a responsibility to
treat this type of student interac
tion with the respect it deserves.
Those who attended the seniors
mingle-with-Casper event of earli
er this year — which was, per
haps, the original "Tea and Cook
ies" — remember it as being filled
simply with small talk. While it is
worthwhile for the president to
engage in pleasant banter with
students, it is more worthwhile
for serious discussion to take
place.
Thus, Casper must come into
this afternoon's event willing to
accept — and even to solicit —
students' legitimate questions on
various areas of University policy.
The campus issues which are of
concern to the student body
should also be of concern to the
president.
"Tea and More Cookies with
Gerhard Casper" will take place
this afternoon in Tresidder's Oak
West room, from 4:30 p.m. to 6
p.m. This event can be a success,
but only if both sides — the stu
dents and the president — give it
the attention it deserves.
