Great scholars are not necessarily great instructors

After learning that one of
the most thoughtful instructors I
had met was being laid off, I have
had this question in my mind: What does
it take for the Stanford community
(especially for the policy makers) to give
a thumbs-up to an instructor? Lots of
prettily framed diplomas surely impress
the heck out of anyone, especially those
like yours truly who struggle through
many courses to get the lovable A-. How
ever, printed works or provocative
research make a good scholar, not neces
sarily a good instructor.
In spite of all the hard work and the
conscientious studying, a professor can
project the image of a clumsy amateur,
too obsessively reliant on notes and the
schedule to digress into topics of inter-

ests to students. Even the unorthodox
views, sometimes carrying the devil's
advocacy to a ridiculous extreme, can be
more effective in triggering some glint of
interest in the students than the conven
tional structure of lectures. And I
assume that most of us are fair enough
to acknowledge that we have felt somno
lent in too many courses. At current
tuition rates, one course is too many. In
my particular case, the phrase, "my
argument" really annoys me. I am prob
ably too susceptible to the choice of
words, but it seems like the entire dis
cussion will be limited to proving one
doctrine, implying it is the doctrine.
I do not imply that the standard quali
fications are irrelevant. Far from it; they
provide the backbone of the teacher. Yet

to write well does not mean that you
speak well or, even further, that you
explain or teach well. Call me unscientif
ic, but I believe there is little correlation
between the doctoral degree or research
experience and the skill of teaching effec
tively. To accept the doctrine as is seems
to be what we were told to do in high
school, where there was one history, one
psychology, one philosophy and one
appraisal of Hamlet. Instructors don't
have to prove their ideas to their stu
dents, but to their peers. We are not here
to be convinced. We are here to learn and
not only for knowledge — books are
cheaper, thank you. What I need is chal
lenge. Complacency toward the profes
sors' ideas goes against the principle of a
university, where brainstorming, provo

cation and objection are welcome and
tackled. So when this instructor finally
leaves, another devil's advocate will be
exorcised, so that we may all be cute,
xerox-copy angels.
In fact, complacency usually back
fires. While professors aim to "convert"
students into "their" vision of the world,
they forget that students have been
taught to be blind. I say this with some
degree of teaching experience, which
only makes the more understanding yet
the more frustrated. Be worried if all the
students love you, especially if you teach
controversial issues. Chances are they
couldn't care less about what you taught
them.
