## A
						defining life moment 
### 
RIDING BACK TO West Campus
from Arrillaga Family Sports Cen
ter last spring, I happened upon
what can only be called one of those
"defining moments in life." I'd heard
about such events before: a revelation or
an out-of-body experience, for instance,
that shapes one's existence and forever
remains an emotional benchmark in the
individual's life.
This story actually occurred, proving
to me that God does exist and that he has
one hell of a sense of humor.
It all began innocently enough. Ped
dling past Ford Center into the empty
Business School parking lot, I was lost in
thought and entirely at ease in the wan
ing afternoon.sun, when a voice from the
opposite side of the street caught my
attention. I glanced across the pavement
and then turned my eyes to the shady
glen that surrounds Frost Amphitheater.
The scene was so idyllic that I doubted I
had really heard anything at all.
But there, standing quietly in the
shadows, was a tall, very attractive twen
ty-something in a bikini and Rollerblades.
Not sure that she had summoned me, I
hesitantly made eye-contact. To my curi
ous pleasure, she waved. Still, though, I
looked around for another person, but the
street was empty.
As I turned the handle-bars in her
direction, my grip grew tighter. Beads of
sweat formed on my brow, and perverse

little thoughts began to dance through
my head. Her beauty was more apparent
as I came closer. Slender legs, six feet
tall, blonde hair, at least five years my
elder. Was this not each young man's
fantasy? A fair maiden in need. And I,
her knight.
Trying to remain self-assured and
confident, I gently brought my bike to a
stop five feet in front of her. "What's
up?" I asked in a deep baritone voice.
With a sexy, cautious smile, she
began. "I . . . I, uh, need your help."
"Of course you do," I thought. "Where
to begin?"
Still, no one had seen us; it was abso
lutely perfect. She was perfect. No cars.
No people. No distractions. The purest of
relationships. Just her sensuous body
and my dreams of physical abandonment.
Unlike Dustin Hoffman, 1 was going to
"graduate" a few years early. Arid then
maybe co-term for the hell of it.
She pointed to the trees, and I too
began to smile. Her full lips quivered, as
if to speak again. Difficult as it was, I
forced my eyes up to meet hers. Seduc
tively, she glanced over her shoulder.
Each certain of what was to come, we
instinctively took a step toward each
other . . .
And then it all came crashing down.
"One of my dogs," she quickly started.
"One of my dogs got hold of a squirrel
and hurt it pretty bad. It's in pain â€”

can't even climb a tree. It's going to die.
I mean, really, it's in pain. I can't let it
suffer."
Shell-shocked, I stood deathly silent.
Sickly white, my face reflected in her
Ray-Bans, while my ego shrank to Lil
liputian proportions. Dreams, hopes and
aspirations came tumbling before my
eyes. There would be no graduation, no
ceremony, and no pomp and circum
stance.
Then she dropped the bomb. "Could
you come over and help me put it out of
its misery? There's a board I think we
can use."
WHAT THE F-K? My mind raced.
Was I going to go over and beat the living
crap out of a squirrel? Was she kidding?
Could having its brain pummeled by a
two-by-four constitute "making life a lit
tle easier" for the poor animal?
Shaken, my response was almost
inaudible. "Sorry," I choked, "but you'll
have to find someone else." Slowly, I
turned away and started toward my bike.
I was completely speechless. All I
could think was, "Only at Stanford. Only
at Stanford."

Ryan Craig would like to once again
remind his readers that this story is abso
lutely true, despite its absurdity. Damn.
