# Crumpets with Casper
## President will host tea for all students 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
Tonight in Tresidder Union, a meeting
titled "Tea and More Cookies" with Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper will provide
an opportunity for any and all students to
air their ideas and concerns in the first
"open-town" meeting of its kind, said Dean
of Students Marc Wais.
The meeting will be held from 4:30 p.m.
to 6 p.m. in the Tresidder Oak West.
Initiated by Casper and coordinated by
Wais, the event seeks to provide a full-scale
open forum for undergraduate, graduate
and professional students to address perti
nent issues in a talk for which Casper will
be completely unrehearsed.
While Casper has consistently met
with students since the beginning of his
presidency in more "intimate settings,"
Wais said, the low turnout at these
events "hasn't maximized [Casper's] ex

posure to students."
"He is concerned about his availability
and accessibility to students," Wais said.
Assistant to the President Jean Fetter
concurred, saying that Casper is trying to
meet the challenge of understanding the in
dividual ideas of the 14,000 members of the
student body.
"Tea and More Cookies" is "another
kind of venue to engage with students" in a
"general interchange," Fetter said.
She added that it is also a chance for
Casper to "get to people who aren't in elect
ed office," which he does on a routine basis
at his meetings with the ASSU and the
Council of Presidents.
In the past, Casper has met with stu
dents at a variety of events, including dorm
visits and early morning hikes. Members of
the senior class had an opportunity to meet
with the president in Tresidder last quar-
