# Crumpets with Casper
## President will host tea for all students 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
Tonight in Tresidder Union, a meeting
titled "Tea and More Cookies" with Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper will provide
an opportunity for any and all students to
air their ideas and concerns in the first
"open-town" meeting of its kind, said Dean
of Students Marc Wais.
The meeting will be held from 4:30 p.m.
to 6 p.m. in the Tresidder Oak West.
Initiated by Casper and coordinated by
Wais, the event seeks to provide a full-scale
open forum for undergraduate, graduate
and professional students to address perti
nent issues in a talk for which Casper will
be completely unrehearsed.
While Casper has consistently met
with students since the beginning of his
presidency in more "intimate settings,"
Wais said, the low turnout at these
events "hasn't maximized [Casper's] ex

posure to students."
"He is concerned about his availability
and accessibility to students," Wais said.
Assistant to the President Jean Fetter
concurred, saying that Casper is trying to
meet the challenge of understanding the in
dividual ideas of the 14,000 members of the
student body.
"Tea and More Cookies" is "another
kind of venue to engage with students" in a
"general interchange," Fetter said.
She added that it is also a chance for
Casper to "get to people who aren't in elect
ed office," which he does on a routine basis
at his meetings with the ASSU and the
Council of Presidents.
In the past, Casper has met with stu
dents at a variety of events, including dorm
visits and early morning hikes. Members of
the senior class had an opportunity to meet
with the president in Tresidder last quar-


Casper
ter, and last year students were in
vited to Hoover House for milk
and cookies.
"Tea and More Cookies" is a
further opportunity to munch on
goodies while offering food for
thought to the University's leader.
Senior David Barba, a coordina
tor at the Lesbian, Gay and Bisex
ual Community Center, said he
thinks the meeting will be "a good
space for serious dialogue," but
added that he is "skeptical" about
the outcome of such a dialogue.
Barba said he hopes that rather

than offering unrealistic promis
es, the president will provide "a
sense of where he stands" and will
"answer questions I'm concerned
about," such as wheelchair acces
sibility to the various community
centers.
"I just want to know if he's
thought about it and what his take
on it is," Barba said.
According to Wais, if there is a
favorable turnout tonight, similar
forums with the president may be
scheduled for as many as two or
three times a quarter next acade
mic year. A similar meeting is al
ready planned for next quarter.
"[Casper] wants to hear from
students," Wais said. "I think he'll
pick up a lot."
