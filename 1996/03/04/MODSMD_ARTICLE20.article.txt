## A
						rejection retrospective: Laura Rabinowitz, Esquire 
### 
Asking is probably the best way to get some
one to say no.
— Ari Newberger
I received my first rejection letter just yes
terday. Not for a job, mind you, but for a
rather long short stoiy. Puicall that it is
my stated intention to get paid for writing
eventually, so that, unlike my fellow class
mates, I might avoid working for some con
sulting firm and thus keep a firm grip on my
soul.
Which is why I spent so long writing and
rewriting and rewriting the damn thing.
Finally, it was finished for real, and, in the
end, it was considered by those I asked to
read it "to probably be something worth
reading." Which is a pretty nice thing to say
about someone's fiction, despite the split
infinitive.
Thus the story was sent to several maga
zines in the form of a submission. Six weeks
later, I received my first response:
The editors of Esquire appreciated the
opportunity to consider your work. We're
sorry to tell you that it does not fit our needs,
but thank you for sending it to us.
That's all. No signatures, no check, no
note from some editor saying "Great first
try! I really dug this, Michael, only it's too

long — call me when you're back in town."
Now, for the most part, I deal well with
rejection. No sniveling to my RA; no quarts
of Popov vodka to douse the pain; no mas
turbation marathons while listening to The
Cure. A few pouts and a little Xanex, maybe.
Because, for the most part, I take rejec
tion as a sign that at least I overcame stag
nation and gave some futile task a shot. Win
or lose, cool is preserved.
But this time, things are different. I
don't feel much like dealing. I feel like lash
ing out, sending hate mail or a car bomb or
canceling their account at Starbucks.
The point is, I'm a little hurt.
But the funny thing is that this incident
reminds me very much of my first rejection
by a woman. I use the term "woman" here
to describe a certain seventh grader who,
when I was still in fourth grade, was the
hottest honey to ever put ketchup on a fish
stick. Her name was Laura Rabinowitz.
She was a shrill girl, this Laura, bombas
tic in speech and overzealously effusive,
which gave her the personality of a rubber
band pulled taught and aimed at your eyes.
But I dug her anyway. Big time.
So one day, in a fit of pre-teen, cable
viewer precociousness, I decided it was high
time for this little Cabbage Patch to make

that little Chiquita banana his girlfriend.
Only I was still a little uncertain on the
details of how that was done.
In fact, it was my understanding that all
one had to do was have a secret liking for a
girl and that was enough — it made her
yours. And so, in my mind, with my crush, I
made this Laura my babe. God, I was cute
back then.
Only some weeks later — about six
weeks actually — I learned that consent is a
necessary part of dating and that, in order
to ensure that this Laura was indeed "my
girlfriend," I'd have to ask her opinion on
the matter.
Now here's the really funny part: It
never occurred to me that this Laura might
not want to be a part of my 10-year-old fan
tasy. What could possibly be lacking? Sure, I
was three years younger, but I was 4-foot-8,
87 pounds and had all my hair — I was set.
And so I called up this Ijaura and I asked
her.
I won't dwell on the details of her rejec
tion ... I think I threw up.
But I've been thinking all day today
about what this Laura said before hanging
up on me. She said: I'm glad you asked me,
Michael. You 're cute. Maybe you should try
someone else, someone more your speed.

And then she hung up. I think I threw up
again.
It's no wonder I'm stuck on that old
memory now. My piddly form letter sings
with the sentiment of Laura's romantic
euthanasia. Both cry out: Thank you so
much for thinking of me, but I sure as hell
don't want you slobbering all over me. Go try
someone with a little lower status.
Writing and romance, two inclinations
that appeared perfectly natural to me,
squelched by the same tawdry technique —
squelched at the moment the first bud
opened.
My first rejection letter — it's like Laura
all over again: A bullet to the groin with just
enough encouragement to make me want to
risk it all again. They "appreciated the
opportunity to consider" me, but needed
someone hung a little bigger. The stuff I
offered doesn't "fit" their "needs."
Like Laura, my would-be editors would
be much happier if I started slow, with
"someone more [my] speed" (as if she was
some sexual diva in a backpack). Maybe
down the road I'll be ready for the "big boy"
stuff.
But the thing is, I don't want to find
someone slower and wait around 'til big
girls are ready to let me in. I don't want any

of these insidious up-'n'-coming, Gen-X,
brain-candy, rich-daddy, lemme-tell-ya
what's-hip rag mags to be the first to let me
unhook the Wonderbra of mass publication.
I want maturity. I want the experience. I
want the sluts of the publishing world.
I want the ones who've been to bed with
all the great writers I love. I want 'em fully
developed, intellectually buxom, bursting
right out of their harnesses with readership.
So what to do? Need I recognize now that
I am the literary equivalent of a high school
sophomore who's been to second base and
back but is still entirely unaware of the
details of third? Can I only play in the
minors? Do I still need to wear a cup?
Like with romance, I could choose to
practice writing alone. But I'm going to keep
at it. I don't get off on literary masturba
tion. Not anymore. I've practiced enough,
and now I want someone, someone desir
able to be there when I spill my seeds.
Because, as far as I can tell, I am perfectly
capable of finding the narrative G-spot.
In fact, I'm even thinking of giving that
Laura a call. I hear she's working for
Esquire now.
