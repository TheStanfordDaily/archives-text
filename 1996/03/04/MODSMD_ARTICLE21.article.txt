## Women win a laugher Stanford goes to 16-0 in Pac-10 with 51 pt. win

Stanford S7
California 36

Saturday's women's basket
ball matchup between the first
and last place teams in the Pacific
10 Conference was billed as the
100 th anniversary celebration.
Stanford topped California in
1896 by a score of 3-2.
Women's hoops has come a
long way, but Cal (6-19, 2-14) had
nearly as much trouble putting
the ball in the hole two nights ago
as it did 100 years ago in a crush
ing 87-36 loss before a sellout
crowd. With its 17th-consecutive
victory, No. 4 Stanford (23-2, 16-
0) sent Cal to its worst loss ever
and matched a two-year confer
ence mark for fewest points al
lowed in a league game, tying Ore
gon's 75-36 win over Cal on
March 3,1994.
"We didn't start well tonight,
or finish well, or play well in be
tween," said longtime Cal coach
Gooch Foster.
On the other hand, Stanford
had no such difficulties. Junior
guard / forward Kate Starbird
scored 20 first-half points, single
handedly holding a one-point ad
vantage over the Golden Bears.
Stanford cruised to a 19-point
halftime edge despite missing on
all 12 of its three-point attempts.

minutes and even fired a three

favor on the other end.
Cal's woes only worsened in a
pathetic second half. Stanford
grabbed every loose ball and en
joyed the Heather Owen show, as
the sophomore forward enjoyed a
career half at Cal's expense. The
undersized Golden Bears were

unable to control Owen, who
poured in a career-high 21 points
on 9-of-12 shooting off the bench.
"I think Heather is capable of
this every single game," Stanford
coach Amy Tucker said. "I hope
this helps her confidence."
Owen's heroics came at exactly
the right time, as sophomore cen
ter Olympia Scott garnered two
quick fouls and had to sit out for
long stretches. Leading rebounder
and three-point shooter Vanessa
Nygaard sat out the contest with a
stress fracture in her left foot and,
as a result, Owen was the only
player with consistent minutes
available off the bench after
sophomore forward Naomi Muli
tauaopele's entry into the staring
lineup. The Cardinal's three post
players combined for 46 points
and 26 rebounds, including
Scott's first double-double of the
year. Scott even mustered a ca
reer-high three assists, as many as

anybody on the Golden Bears.
While Nygaard's absence did
not affect the Cardinal on Satur
day, the team shot poorly from be
hind the arc without her. With the
Cardinal's chances for a No. 1 seed
in the NCAA iourney as high as
they have been all season, Ny
gaard may not play next week even
if she is cleared to go.
"I'm hoping to have Vanessa
available if we need her to play in
the games next week," Tucker
said.
The contest was billed as the
matchup between co-Pac-10 play
ers of the week Jamila Wideman
and Eliza Sokolowska, the two
point guards. But neither scored
as Wideman completely shut
down Cal's leading scorer and the
fifth-leading player in the nation
in assists. With Sokolowska un
able to distribute the ball effec
tively, Cal's starting lineup com
bined for an incredible 10 points.

with 22 points including five
three-pointers in six attempts, Cal

than four points.
Cal set season lows for Stanford
opponents in scoring for each half,
and Pac-10 lows for free throws
(two) and free throw percentage (a

Bears could force only one steal as
Stanford committed just eight
turnovers, also a Pac-10 season
best for a conference game.
Stanford won by more than 50
points for the eighth time in histo
ry, further enhancing the Cardi

in the West. After No. 2 Georgia's
stunning loss to LSU in the quar

to topple each other. After Oregon

les, the Cardinal has opened up a
six-game lead in the loss column,
the largest in conference history.

ter Olympia Scott garnered two
quick fouls and had to sit out for
long stretches. Leading rebounder
and three-point shooter Vanessa
Nygaard sat out the contest with a
stress fracture in her left foot and,
as a result, Owen was the only
player with consistent minutes
available off the bench after
sophomore forward Naomi Muli
tauaopele's entry into the staring
lineup. The Cardinal's three post
players combined for 46 points
and 26 rebounds, including
Scott's first double-double of the
year. Scott even mustered a ca
reer-high three assists, as many as

anybody on the Golden Bears.
While Nygaard's absence did
not affect the Cardinal on Satur
day, the team shot poorly from be
hind the arc without her. With the
Cardinal's chances for a No. 1 seed
in the NCAA iourney as high as
they have been all season, Ny
gaard may not play next week even
if she is cleared to go.
"I'm hoping to have Vanessa
available if we need her to play in
the games next week," Tucker
said.
The contest was billed as the
matchup between co-Pac-10 play
ers of the week Jamila Wideman
and Eliza Sokolowska, the two
point guards. But neither scored
as Wideman completely shut
down Cal's leading scorer and the
fifth-leading player in the nation
in assists. With Sokolowska un
able to distribute the ball effec
tively, Cal's starting lineup com
bined for an incredible 10 points.

Kate Starbird drives for two of h er team-high 22 points in the Cardi
nal's 87-36 victory over Cal on Saturday.
Stanford S7
California 36

Saturday's women's basket
ball matchup between the first
and last place teams in the Pacific
10 Conference was billed as the
100 th anniversary celebration.
Stanford topped California in
1896 by a score of 3-2.
Women's hoops has come a
long way, but Cal (6-19, 2-14) had
nearly as much trouble putting
the ball in the hole two nights ago
as it did 100 years ago in a crush
ing 87-36 loss before a sellout
crowd. With its 17th-consecutive
victory, No. 4 Stanford (23-2, 16-
0) sent Cal to its worst loss ever
and matched a two-year confer
ence mark for fewest points al
lowed in a league game, tying Ore
gon's 75-36 win over Cal on
March 3,1994.
"We didn't start well tonight,
or finish well, or play well in be
tween," said longtime Cal coach
Gooch Foster.
On the other hand, Stanford
had no such difficulties. Junior
guard / forward Kate Starbird
scored 20 first-half points, single
handedly holding a one-point ad
vantage over the Golden Bears.
Stanford cruised to a 19-point
halftime edge despite missing on
all 12 of its three-point attempts.
Stanford redshirt freshman
Chandra Benton received early
minutes and even fired a three
point attempt, and Cal center Ta
tiana Dmitrieva returned the
favor on the other end.
Cal's woes only worsened in a
pathetic second half. Stanford
grabbed every loose ball and en
joyed the Heather Owen show, as
the sophomore forward enjoyed a
career half at Cal's expense. The
undersized Golden Bears were

unable to control Owen, who
poured in a career-high 21 points
on 9-of-12 shooting off the bench.
"I think Heather is capable of
this every single game," Stanford

than four points.
Cal set season lows for Stanford
opponents in scoring for each half,
and Pac-10 lows for free throws
(two) and free throw percentage (a
paltry 22.2 percent). The Golden
Bears could force only one steal as
Stanford committed just eight
turnovers, also a Pac-10 season
best for a conference game.
Stanford won by more than 50
points for the eighth time in histo
ry, further enhancing the Cardi

in the West. After No. 2 Georgia's
stunning loss to LSU in the quar
terfinals of the Southeastern Con
ference tournament and No. 6
lowa's subsequent debacle against
Purdue, the Cardinal appears to
have all but nailed down the top
seed out west, even though the rest
of the Pac-10 contenders continue
to topple each other. After Oregon
State's 0-2 showing in Los Ange
les, the Cardinal has opened up a
six-game lead in the loss column,
the largest in conference history.

Kate Starbird drives for two of h er team-high 22 points in the Cardi
nal's 87-36 victory over Cal on Saturday.
Stanford S7
California 36

Saturday's women's basket
ball matchup between the first
and last place teams in the Pacific
10 Conference was billed as the
100 th anniversary celebration.
Stanford topped California in
1896 by a score of 3-2.
Women's hoops has come a
long way, but Cal (6-19, 2-14) had
nearly as much trouble putting
the ball in the hole two nights ago
as it did 100 years ago in a crush
ing 87-36 loss before a sellout
crowd. With its 17th-consecutive
victory, No. 4 Stanford (23-2, 16-
0) sent Cal to its worst loss ever
and matched a two-year confer
ence mark for fewest points al
lowed in a league game, tying Ore
gon's 75-36 win over Cal on
March 3,1994.
"We didn't start well tonight,
or finish well, or play well in be
tween," said longtime Cal coach
Gooch Foster.
On the other hand, Stanford
had no such difficulties. Junior
guard / forward Kate Starbird
scored 20 first-half points, single
handedly holding a one-point ad
vantage over the Golden Bears.
Stanford cruised to a 19-point
halftime edge despite missing on
all 12 of its three-point attempts.
Stanford redshirt freshman
Chandra Benton received early
minutes and even fired a three
point attempt, and Cal center Ta
tiana Dmitrieva returned the
favor on the other end.
Cal's woes only worsened in a
pathetic second half. Stanford
grabbed every loose ball and en
joyed the Heather Owen show, as
the sophomore forward enjoyed a
career half at Cal's expense. The
undersized Golden Bears were

day at Cal.
unable to control Owen, who
poured in a career-high 21 points
on 9-of-12 shooting off the bench.
"I think Heather is capable of
this every single game," Stanford
coach Amy Tucker said. "I hope
this helps her confidence."
Owen's heroics came at exactly
the right time, as sophomore cen
ter Olympia Scott garnered two
quick fouls and had to sit out for
long stretches. Leading rebounder
and three-point shooter Vanessa
Nygaard sat out the contest with a
stress fracture in her left foot and,
as a result, Owen was the only
player with consistent minutes
available off the bench after
sophomore forward Naomi Muli
tauaopele's entry into the staring
lineup. The Cardinal's three post
players combined for 46 points
and 26 rebounds, including
Scott's first double-double of the
year. Scott even mustered a ca
reer-high three assists, as many as

anybody on the Golden Bears.
While Nygaard's absence did
not affect the Cardinal on Satur
day, the team shot poorly from be
hind the arc without her. With the
Cardinal's chances for a No. 1 seed
in the NCAA iourney as high as
they have been all season, Ny
gaard may not play next week even
if she is cleared to go.
"I'm hoping to have Vanessa
available if we need her to play in
the games next week," Tucker
said.
The contest was billed as the
matchup between co-Pac-10 play
ers of the week Jamila Wideman
and Eliza Sokolowska, the two
point guards. But neither scored
as Wideman completely shut
down Cal's leading scorer and the
fifth-leading player in the nation
in assists. With Sokolowska un
able to distribute the ball effec
tively, Cal's starting lineup com
bined for an incredible 10 points.
Without junior forward Patrycja
Czepiec, who tied a season-high
with 22 points including five
three-pointers in six attempts, Cal
