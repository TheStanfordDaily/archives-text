Saturday's women's basket
ball matchup between the first
and last place teams in the Pacific
10 Conference was billed as the
100 th anniversary celebration.
Stanford topped California in
1896 by a score of 3-2.
Women's hoops has come a
long way, but Cal (6-19, 2-14) had

pathetic second half. Stanford
grabbed every loose ball and en
joyed the Heather Owen show, as
the sophomore forward enjoyed a
career half at Cal's expense. The
undersized Golden Bears were
