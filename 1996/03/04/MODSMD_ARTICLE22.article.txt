The No. 6 Golden Bears didn't
have enough firepower to upset
the third-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team, even with a
headstart.

California (6-5, 1-3 Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division)
received a game in every singles
match before it started, due to an
NCAA violation, but the Cardinal
(12-1, 3-0) swept doubles play to
send the Bears to their fifth
straight dual-match defeat, 6-3.
The lead official awarded the
Bears a one-game advantage
when the Cardinal could not pre
sent him with their scorebook
from the past 10 matches. The
rule stipulates that it must be
present so that coaches can chal
lenge stacked or unusual lineups.
"In my 17 years as a coach, I've
never heard of that rule," Stan
ford head coach Frank Brennan
said.

"Not only is the rule stupid
enough, but the penalty is ex
treme. It's like a parking ticket
and the cop comes and shoots
your tires. I mean one game per
match? That is a real dumb rule."
Cal kept the match close in the
singles matches, taking half of
them and entering doubles tied
with Stanford, 3-3. Yet sopho
more Julie Scott and redshirt se
nior Kim Shasby (3-2) demol
ished Cal's No. 2 doubles team of
Nicole Elliott and Marisa Maclen
nan, 6-0, 6-1 to give the Cardinal
a 4-3 edge.
"We sort of jumped on the No.
2 team and just pummeled them,"
Brennan said. "We didn't give
them a chance to get going. That

helps a lot because it puts them in
the hole. When we won No. 2 dou
bles, the Cal girls know they obvi
ously have to win both their other
matches."
From there, the No. 3 Stanford
doubles squad of redshirt senior

Amy Chiminello and junior Emily
Burt (8-0) took control of their
match and clinched the Pac-10
victory by drubbing Pam Enkoji
and Stephanie Tibbits, 6-4, 6-0.
A tight No. 1 Cardinal doubles
squad loosened up with the out
come of the match secured.
Sophomore Ania Bleszynski and
junior Katie Schlukebir (4-3)
bounced back from a 4-6 setback
in the first set to win, 4-6, 7-5, 6-
4. The fifth-ranked duo utilized
service breaks at 6-5 in the sec
ond set and at 4-4 in the third to
increase the match's final margin
to 6-3.
In singles, Stanford jumped
out to a quick 2-0 lead as junior
Sandra De Silva and Chiminello
again cruised to easy straight-set
victories. De Silva (11-1) at No. 4
sent Amanda Augustus off her
home court with a 6-3, 6-2 loss.
Chiminello (12-1) ran all over
Maclennan, a former Stanford re
cruit, on the No. 6 court, 6-3, 6-1.
Cal pulled to within one, as
Nicole Elliott continued to give
Stanford singles problems with a
6-2, 6-3 triumph over Shasby (6-
4) at the No. 3 singles position.
On the No. 1 court, Bleszynski
(10-3) battled and beat both a
cold and Cal's Tibbits, 6-4, 6-4.
Scott (10-1) dropped her first
dual-match contest of the season
to Francesca La'O, 6-2, 7-5.
Friday's dual match served as
a formal warm-up for the Cardi
nal, as they rolled over No. 44
UC-Santa Barbara, 7-0.
