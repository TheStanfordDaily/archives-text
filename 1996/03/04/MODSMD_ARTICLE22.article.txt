The No. 6 Golden Bears didn't
have enough firepower to upset
the third-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team, even with a
headstart.

California (6-5, 1-3 Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division)
received a game in every singles
match before it started, due to an
NCAA violation, but the Cardinal
(12-1, 3-0) swept doubles play to
send the Bears to their fifth
straight dual-match defeat, 6-3.
The lead official awarded the
Bears a one-game advantage
when the Cardinal could not pre
sent him with their scorebook
from the past 10 matches. The
rule stipulates that it must be
present so that coaches can chal
lenge stacked or unusual lineups.
"In my 17 years as a coach, I've
never heard of that rule," Stan
ford head coach Frank Brennan
said.

"Not only is the rule stupid
enough, but the penalty is ex
treme. It's like a parking ticket
and the cop comes and shoots
your tires. I mean one game per
match? That is a real dumb rule."
Cal kept the match close in the
singles matches, taking half of
them and entering doubles tied
with Stanford, 3-3. Yet sopho
more Julie Scott and redshirt se
nior Kim Shasby (3-2) demol
ished Cal's No. 2 doubles team of
Nicole Elliott and Marisa Maclen
nan, 6-0, 6-1 to give the Cardinal
a 4-3 edge.
"We sort of jumped on the No.
2 team and just pummeled them,"
