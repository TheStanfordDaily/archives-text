# Card dismantled by Bears
## Abdur-Rahim scores 31, Gray 27, as Cal rolls 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Stanford 69
California 85

As good a player as Shareef
Abdur-Rahim is, you expected
him to come through with a big
game. What you didn't expect is
that Cal's defense would also
show up, stifling Stanford's of
fense en route to an 85-69 victory
yesterday at Harmon Gym.
After scoring only 13 against
the Cardinal earlier this year,
Abdur-Rahim took over with a
game-high 31 points. It marked
the fourth time this season he's
topped the 30-point plateau.
Ed Gray also chipped in 27 to
complement Abdur-Rahim's out
burst. Gray carried the Bears in
the first half, scoring 11 of Cal's
first 16 points. He finished the
first half with 19.
Although Gray missed all
seven of his field-goal attempts in
the second half, Abdur-Rahim
picked up the slack to the tune of
20 second-half points. The two
combined for 23-of-30 shooting
from the free-throw line.
"It's hard to specifically pre
pare for them, with all their mo
tion," Montgomery said. "But we
did try to emphasize Gray and
Shareef, so it's kind of ironic that
obviously that didn't work out
quite as well."
With the win, Cal assumed
sole possession of third place in
the Pacific 10 Conference at 11-5,

pushing their overall record to 17-8.
Stanford dropped to 17-8 and 10-6.
The 58-point explosion from
Abdur-Rahim and Gray was similar
to the Cardinal's effort earlier this
year, when Dion Cross and Brevin
Knight combined for 54 points.
Bozeman was well aware of the
danger the Stanford guards pre
sented, spending all week working
on stopping Knight and Cross.
"We went over those plays the
entire week," Bozeman said. "That
stagger-screen for Dion we worked
on every day, and we kept him to
one [made] shot at halflime. We
wanted to do that and cut down on
Brevin's penetration."
Two runs by Cal stand out as the
turning points of the game. After
cutting the Bear lead to five with
4:27 to play in the first half, Stan
ford didn't make another field goal
the rest of the half. Cal's 10-2 run
pushed the halftime advantage to
43-29.
In the second half, a three-point
play by Andy Poppink cut the Bear
lead to eight, but a turnover by
Cross led to an Anwar McQueen
three-pointer. The Bears then
started an 11-4 run over the next
five minutes, pushing the lead out
of reach.
Because of the over-emphasis on
shutting down Stanford's guards,
Poppink was able to get solid posi
tion on the low blocks and led Stan
ford with 19 points and eight re
bounds.
Cal's aggressive defense forced
Stanford into 20 turnovers, the
second-highest total of the season.
Cal turned those miscues, many of
which were unforced, into 24
points. The Cardinal had been av
eraging only 13.5 turnovers per
game.
"It's not like us," Poppink said.
"They came out really aggressive. I
don't know if we weren't ready for it
or if we came out too ambitious and
a little careless with the ball."
Said Montgomery: "Anytime we
turn the ball over so much we've got
problems. Early on our defense was
poor — we didn't do a good job de
fending and staying in front of
them. We just made poorer deci
sions rather than good decisions
more often than not."
Abdur-Rahim, who may have
clinched Pac-10 Player of the Year
honors with his effort yesterday,
played within Cal's offensive sys

torn, rather than standing out as
the only option. Because of this, the
Bears stayed in an offensive (low for
most of the game while Stanford
could never get any sort of run to
gether.
"Even though Shareef got 31, I
think they've gotten over being as
dependent as far as looking to go to
him every time," Montgomery said.
"Now it's more like a natural part of
what they do, and, obviously, when
he gets it, he's very capable of doing
something."
Poppink said he thought Abdur-
Rahim was more confident than
earlier this season because he was
able to hit a few outside shots, open
ing up his inside game.
With two games left in the regu
lar season, Stanford is faced with

the disheartening possibility of not
making the NCAA tournament.
1 lowever, Montgomery is not about
to admit being pressured by the un
certain situation.
"It's a 27-game schedule and
we'll continue to push through to
the end of the year," he said. "The
pressure's always on."
Knight, who managed to dish
out 10 assists amid Cal's defensive
pressure, was more direct about
how he and his teammates plan to
handle the coming week.
"We don't even talk about it,"
Knight said. "It's about winning
basketball games now. When you
start talking about the tournament
that's when t he pressure comes. We
don't even mention it, we just go
out and play."

Stanford 69
California 85

As good a player as Shareef
Abdur-Rahim is, you expected
him to come through with a big
game. What you didn't expect is
that Cal's defense would also
show up, stifling Stanford's of
fense en route to an 85-69 victory
yesterday at Harmon Gym.
After scoring only 13 against
the Cardinal earlier this year,
Abdur-Rahim took over with a
game-high 31 points. It marked
the fourth time this season he's
topped the 30-point plateau.
Ed Gray also chipped in 27 to
complement Abdur-Rahim's out
burst. Gray carried the Bears in
the first half, scoring 11 of Cal's
first 16 points. He finished the
first half with 19.
Although Gray missed all
seven of his field-goal attempts in
the second half, Abdur-Rahim
picked up the slack to the tune of
20 second-half points. The two
combined for 23-of-30 shooting
from the free-throw line.
"It's hard to specifically pre
pare for them, with all their mo
tion," Montgomery said. "But we
did try to emphasize Gray and
Shareef, so it's kind of ironic that
obviously that didn't work out
quite as well."
With the win, Cal assumed
sole possession of third place in
the Pacific 10 Conference at 11-5,

pushing their overall record to 17-8.
Stanford dropped to 17-8 and 10-6.
The 58-point explosion from
Abdur-Rahim and Gray was similar
to the Cardinal's effort earlier this
year, when Dion Cross and Brevin
Knight combined for 54 points.
Bozeman was well aware of the
danger the Stanford guards pre
sented, spending all week working
on stopping Knight and Cross.
"We went over those plays the
entire week," Bozeman said. "That
stagger-screen for Dion we worked
on every day, and we kept him to
one [made] shot at halflime. We
wanted to do that and cut down on
Brevin's penetration."
Two runs by Cal stand out as the
turning points of the game. After
cutting the Bear lead to five with
4:27 to play in the first half, Stan
ford didn't make another field goal
the rest of the half. Cal's 10-2 run
pushed the halftime advantage to
43-29.
In the second half, a three-point
play by Andy Poppink cut the Bear
lead to eight, but a turnover by
Cross led to an Anwar McQueen
three-pointer. The Bears then
started an 11-4 run over the next
five minutes, pushing the lead out
of reach.
Because of the over-emphasis on
shutting down Stanford's guards,
Poppink was able to get solid posi
tion on the low blocks and led Stan
ford with 19 points and eight re
bounds.
Cal's aggressive defense forced
Stanford into 20 turnovers, the
second-highest total of the season.
Cal turned those miscues, many of
which were unforced, into 24
points. The Cardinal had been av
eraging only 13.5 turnovers per
game.
"It's not like us," Poppink said.
"They came out really aggressive. I
don't know if we weren't ready for it
or if we came out too ambitious and
a little careless with the ball."
Said Montgomery: "Anytime we
turn the ball over so much we've got
problems. Early on our defense was
poor — we didn't do a good job de
fending and staying in front of
them. We just made poorer deci
sions rather than good decisions
more often than not."
Abdur-Rahim, who may have
clinched Pac-10 Player of the Year
honors with his effort yesterday,
played within Cal's offensive sys

torn, rather than standing out as
the only option. Because of this, the
Bears stayed in an offensive (low for
most of the game while Stanford
could never get any sort of run to
gether.
"Even though Shareef got 31, I
think they've gotten over being as
dependent as far as looking to go to
him every time," Montgomery said.
"Now it's more like a natural part of
what they do, and, obviously, when
he gets it, he's very capable of doing
something."
Poppink said he thought Abdur-
Rahim was more confident than
earlier this season because he was
able to hit a few outside shots, open
ing up his inside game.
With two games left in the regu
lar season, Stanford is faced with

the disheartening possibility of not
making the NCAA tournament.
1 lowever, Montgomery is not about
to admit being pressured by the un
certain situation.
"It's a 27-game schedule and
we'll continue to push through to
the end of the year," he said. "The
pressure's always on."
Knight, who managed to dish
out 10 assists amid Cal's defensive
pressure, was more direct about
how he and his teammates plan to
handle the coming week.
"We don't even talk about it,"
Knight said. "It's about winning
basketball games now. When you
start talking about the tournament
that's when t he pressure comes. We
don't even mention it, we just go
out and play."
