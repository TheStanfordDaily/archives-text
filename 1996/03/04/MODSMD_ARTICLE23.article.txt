As good a player as Shareef
Abdur-Rahim is, you expected
him to come through with a big
game. What you didn't expect is
that Cal's defense would also
show up, stifling Stanford's of
fense en route to an 85-69 victory
yesterday at Harmon Gym.
After scoring only 13 against
the Cardinal earlier this year,
Abdur-Rahim took over with a
game-high 31 points. It marked
the fourth time this season he's
topped the 30-point plateau.
Ed Gray also chipped in 27 to
complement Abdur-Rahim's out
burst. Gray carried the Bears in
the first half, scoring 11 of Cal's
first 16 points. He finished the
first half with 19.
Although Gray missed all
seven of his field-goal attempts in
the second half, Abdur-Rahim
picked up the slack to the tune of
20 second-half points. The two
combined for 23-of-30 shooting
from the free-throw line.
"It's hard to specifically pre
pare for them, with all their mo
tion," Montgomery said. "But we
did try to emphasize Gray and
Shareef, so it's kind of ironic that
obviously that didn't work out
quite as well."
With the win, Cal assumed
sole possession of third place in
the Pacific 10 Conference at 11-5,
