After suffering a 93-79 defeat at the hands of Stan
ford on January 31, the California basketball team
had over a month to stew in its juices and formulate a
winning game plan for yesterday's rematch versus
the Cardinal. What the Bears came up with was sim
plicity at its best: reverse everything. They did that to
perfection in yesterday's 85-69 victory over Stanford.
Instead of two Cardinal stellar performances
guards Dion Cross and Brevin Knight combined for
54 points earlier this year at Maples Pavilion— Cal
had two Bears lighting up Harmon Gym with forward
Shareef Abdur-Rahim and guard Ed Gray posting 58
points between them. Instead of Stanford hustling to
loose balls, the Bears wanted their paws all over them.
"I think [Cal's] emphasis during the week was that
maybe we played a little bit harder at our place than
they did and outhustled them for loose balls and made
the hustle plays," said Cardinal head coach Mike
Montgomery. "Maybe that's why we won. They cer

"And if you turn the game around, they had two

guys that had great individual performances much
like we had at our place with Gray and Shareef. We re
ally didn't have anyone with that kind of a standout
performance."
But while hustle and individuals made the game
that much easier for Cal to win, the backbreaker for
the Cardinal was the Bears' early aggressiveness. Be
hind the raucous denizens of Harmon Gym, Cal
charged out to a 16-6 lead in just over five minutes. In
that span, the normally sure-handed Knight had
three turnovers — fanning the flames for the Bear
faithful. Stanford never recovered from the slow start
and never found the momentum it so desperately
needed.
"We wanted to come out and be the aggressors,"
said Cal head coach Todd Bozeman. "That's when
we're at our best. We made a conscious effort to come
out and be aggressive."
On its heels, the Cardinal was still able to cut the
lead to five points on several occasions in the first half
and to eight points in the second half. But eveiy time
Stanford appeared primed to turn the tides, a clutch
score by Abdur-Rahim, a timely bucket by Gray or an
