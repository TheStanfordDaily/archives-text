# Bears win in convincing fashion Cal outplays Stanford in reversal of last meeting

### Daniel Kao Staff writer 
After suffering a 93-79 defeat at the hands of Stan
ford on January 31, the California basketball team
had over a month to stew in its juices and formulate a
winning game plan for yesterday's rematch versus
the Cardinal. What the Bears came up with was sim
plicity at its best: reverse everything. They did that to
perfection in yesterday's 85-69 victory over Stanford.
Instead of two Cardinal stellar performances
guards Dion Cross and Brevin Knight combined for
54 points earlier this year at Maples Pavilion— Cal
had two Bears lighting up Harmon Gym with forward
Shareef Abdur-Rahim and guard Ed Gray posting 58
points between them. Instead of Stanford hustling to
loose balls, the Bears wanted their paws all over them.
"I think [Cal's] emphasis during the week was that
maybe we played a little bit harder at our place than
they did and outhustled them for loose balls and made
the hustle plays," said Cardinal head coach Mike
Montgomery. "Maybe that's why we won. They cer
tainly turned that around today. The reverse was ex
actly true.
"And if you turn the game around, they had two

guys that had great individual performances much
like we had at our place with Gray and Shareef. We re
ally didn't have anyone with that kind of a standout
performance."
But while hustle and individuals made the game
that much easier for Cal to win, the backbreaker for
the Cardinal was the Bears' early aggressiveness. Be
hind the raucous denizens of Harmon Gym, Cal
charged out to a 16-6 lead in just over five minutes. In
that span, the normally sure-handed Knight had
three turnovers — fanning the flames for the Bear
faithful. Stanford never recovered from the slow start
and never found the momentum it so desperately
needed.
"We wanted to come out and be the aggressors,"
said Cal head coach Todd Bozeman. "That's when
we're at our best. We made a conscious effort to come
out and be aggressive."
On its heels, the Cardinal was still able to cut the
lead to five points on several occasions in the first half
and to eight points in the second half. But eveiy time
Stanford appeared primed to turn the tides, a clutch
score by Abdur-Rahim, a timely bucket by Gray or an
inopportune giveaway by the Cardi
nal quickly stunted any comeback.
"They came out quick, and we
tend to come out slow every now
and then," Knight said. "We want
ed to just keep our poise. We figured
we would get it back. We got it down
to five in the first half and eight in
the second half, but we just couldn't
get over that hump. They just
played hard, so you have to give
them a lot of credit for coming out
and doing what they did. They pret
ty much took us out of our offense."
The Bears did so by relentlessly
attacking and getting in the face of
the Cardinal. Stanford's usually
hot backcourt shot just 3-of-13
from the field. Even more impor
tantly, the Cal attack forced 20
turnovers for the game, which the

Bears converted into 24 points.
"The turnovers were unforced,"
Montgomery said. "We came out of
set offenses and couldn't find a shot
and just panicked. They were better
prepared mentally to get into us,
and it worked for them. They really
got up into us. We couldn't move,
we couldn't get penetration. They
got their hands on a lot of balls."
Twelve of those turnovers and
16 of those points came in the first
half which put Stanford's back im
mediately to the wall — something
the Cardinal didn't want happening
at hostile Harmon Gym where the
fans were ready to see Cal snap
Stanford's three-game winning
streak against the Bears.
"The crowd was really gunning
today," Montgomery said. "They
were really ready for us, and they
jumped in our snoot. It wasn't like
it was going to go away. We were
going to have to make it go away,
and we weren't able to do that."
