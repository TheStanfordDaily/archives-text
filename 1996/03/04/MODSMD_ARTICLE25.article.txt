When the Stanford baseball team takes to the road, it
receives no warm welcomes from its hosts.
The No. 9 Cardinal (12-8, 3-3 in PacificlO Southern
Division play) has taken its worst lumps on Friday
nights, and the trend continued this weekend in a series
opening 8-1 loss at No. 6 Arizona State's Packard Stadi

Although UCLA is the only team to take two of three
from Mark Marquess' squad, Stanford has dropped
game one in four of its six weekend series, losing to
Hawaii by a score of 11-1, Fresno State, 16-1, UCLA, 6-
5 and ASU, 8-1. As it did in Hawaii and Fresno, the Car
dinal battled back against the Sun Devils (13-5, 1-2 in
the Six-Pac) and left town with wins Saturday and Sun
day.
Yesterday, Stanford rode a solid performance by ju
nior Tom Reimers (3-1) who allowed two runs in nine in
nings of work in a 9-2 Cardinal win. Reimers, who has
been used in long relief and in the closer role so far this
year, showed his versatility in only his second collegiate
start.
A three-run home run by first baseman Troy Kent in
the second inning was all the offensive support Reimers
needed, as the right-hander shut down the Sun Devil
bats in the final innings. The blast was Kent's second of
the season.
The win came on the heels of an emotional 7-5 victo
ry in game two on Saturday, in which Stanford broke a
5-5 tie in the top of the ninth. Arizona State's Kaipo
Spenser allowed the first batter of the inning to reach
base, hitting freshman Josh Hochgesang with a 2-2
pitch. Spenser compounded his problems in a hurry,
throwing away a pick-off attempt, allowing pinch-run-
