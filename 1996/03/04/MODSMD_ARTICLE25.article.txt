When the Stanford baseball team takes to the road, it
receives no warm welcomes from its hosts.
The No. 9 Cardinal (12-8, 3-3 in PacificlO Southern
Division play) has taken its worst lumps on Friday
nights, and the trend continued this weekend in a series
opening 8-1 loss at No. 6 Arizona State's Packard Stadi
um.
Although UCLA is the only team to take two of three
from Mark Marquess' squad, Stanford has dropped
game one in four of its six weekend series, losing to
Hawaii by a score of 11-1, Fresno State, 16-1, UCLA, 6-
5 and ASU, 8-1. As it did in Hawaii and Fresno, the Car
dinal battled back against the Sun Devils (13-5, 1-2 in
the Six-Pac) and left town with wins Saturday and Sun
day.
Yesterday, Stanford rode a solid performance by ju
nior Tom Reimers (3-1) who allowed two runs in nine in
nings of work in a 9-2 Cardinal win. Reimers, who has
been used in long relief and in the closer role so far this
year, showed his versatility in only his second collegiate
start.
A three-run home run by first baseman Troy Kent in
the second inning was all the offensive support Reimers
needed, as the right-hander shut down the Sun Devil
bats in the final innings. The blast was Kent's second of
the season.
The win came on the heels of an emotional 7-5 victo
ry in game two on Saturday, in which Stanford broke a
5-5 tie in the top of the ninth. Arizona State's Kaipo
Spenser allowed the first batter of the inning to reach
base, hitting freshman Josh Hochgesang with a 2-2
pitch. Spenser compounded his problems in a hurry,
throwing away a pick-off attempt, allowing pinch-run-

run, and 5 RBIs.
ner Jay Pecci to advance all the way
to third base.
Stanford's next batter, right
fielder Joe Kilburg, picket! up the
game winning RBI, blooping a sin
gle which plated Pecci. Senior
Mario Iglesias (2-1) retired the side
in the bottom of the ninth to nail
down the win for the Cardinal.
In a great team victory, fresh
man Jody Gerut made significant
contributions both at the plate and
in the field. Gerut launched his sec
ond home run of the year and made
an outstanding catch in centerfield
in the sixth inning. But Gerut's
most important highlight came in
the bottom of the eighth, when he

fielded a slow-rolling ball in shallow
right-center and gunned down Ari
zona State's Jeff Cermak at the
plate.
"I knew the ball had to be re
leased right away — it was off Dal
limore's glove and had slowed down
a little bit," Gerut said. "I knew he'd
be trying to score so I just came up
and threw it as hard and as accu
rately as I could and fortunately we
got that bounce — it got right to
(catcher Jon Schaeffer) and he put
the tag on him."
According to Gerut, the win was
just the type of emotional perfor
mance the Cardinal has been look
ing for this year.
"We've been lacking that fire in
the last couple of weeks — at least
performance-wise on the field, we
haven't been getting it done,"

Gerut said. "Today we really
brought it together — we haven't
really played to our potential yet
this year, but it was really shining
through today."
Friday's loss was another tough
outing for sophomore Kyle Peter
son, who the Sun Devils roughed up
for seven runs in the first inning.
Peterson, last year's national
Freshman of the Year, has strug
gled since throwing 7 2/3 innings of
no-hit ball against Cal State-Fuller
ton on Feb. 2.
Stanford finally returns to
Sunken Diamond tonight, where it
has not played since an 11-1 win
over Santa Clara three weeks ago.
The Cardinal hosts Penn State in a
7 p.m. contest, then ventures across
the bay to meet St. Mary's in a
Tuesday afternoon affair.
