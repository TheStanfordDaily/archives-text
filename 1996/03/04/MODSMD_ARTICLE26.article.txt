They're learning fast, and the
only way to go for Stanford
women's lacrosse in NCAA Divi
sion I is up.
In Saturday's contest, Stan
ford (0-2, 2-5 overall) came up
short by the score of 12-7 against
its first NCAA opponent, the Uni
versity of Vermont. But they will
travel to UC-Davis this weekend
to avenge their 6-5 loss to the Ag
gies a week ago.
"We played better than we had
in a while, but our shooting per
centage needs to improve dramat
ically," said senior co-captain
Wendy Kula. "We have to learn
how to finish it off, convert it to a
goal. We're working hard on the
field, we're passing the ball, but
when we get it down in front of the
net we couldn't convert."
Both Stanford and Vermont
are young teams, with about ten
or eleven freshmen each and only
a smattering of seniors. In addi
tion, sophomore Elizabeth
Franklin faces an immense learn
ing curve since she became Stan
ford's new goalie a few weeks ago.
Saturday's game was dedicat
ed to the memory of Sarah De
vens, a standout in lacrosse, field

hockey and ice hockey at Dart
mouth College. Devens, who died
last summer, would have been
captain of all three sports in this,
her senior year.
Freshman Alexis Patrizio fired
up the Cardinal with a quick goal
within the first ten seconds. Stan
ford kept possession for almost
two full minutes before Vermont
responded, tying it up at 1-1.
A few minutes later, Vermont
scored quickly with a few Stan
ford players down on defense.
Sophomore Dara Kaplan gained
possession off the draw, and
passed to senior co-captain Peppie
Stephenson. After dishing it off to
Kula momentarily, Stephenson
slammed in another goal, just five
minutes into the game, tying the
score again at 2-2.
Vermont answered soon after,
pulling ahead to 3-2 with still 24
minutes left in the half. Despite
pressure by Kaplan, sophomore
Carole Fakhry and junior Hope
Holiday, as well as a save by
Franklin, Vermont scored three
goals in the next 14 minutes.
After successive hard checks
on Vermont's attack by Kula and
freshman Jordyn Kramer, Ka
plan scores on a fast break with
about 10 minutes left, in the half.
The half ended with the score 7-3
Twice Stanford came within three
points of the Catamounts in the
second half, thanks to two goals by
Fakhry and Kaplan within 30 sec
onds of each other, six minutes into
the half. With 15 minutes left,
goalie Franklin scooped up a failed
Vermont shot and passed it off to
Kaplan, who gave it to Kula, who
was checked but kept possession.
On a free position shot, Kula scored
the sixth Stanford goal of the day.
With the score 11-6, Stanford,
won the next draw, and immediate
ly passed down the field to Fakhry,
who ran in and tossed in a seeming

ly effortless point, the Cardinal's
last.
Although the team was frustrat
ed by the loss, they recognize their
strength and are gathering power
for the future.
"We did a lot better with our
transitions and moving the ball,"
Kaplan said. "We were playing
more of a running game."
After trouncing California
teams by large margins last year,
the Cardinal is now playing in
NCAA Division I. The contest with
Vermont was only the first of nine
NCAA games scheduled, most to be
played in the east.
"It's good for the sport to en
courage teams to come west," said

senior Hannah Flatau. "It increas
es visibility for us and lets them
know what's going on here."
"We'll take what we've learned
and apply it to other games," said
Kula. "It's not getting easier —
we'll get our revenge on Davis next
weekend."
Head coach Kay Cowperthwait
emphasized that little things like
picking up ground balls or convert
ing eight-meter shots were an issue
in this game, as well as making
shots count and keeping posses
sion.
"I think it was a really good game
for us," she said. "We're a young
team so every game we play we're
going to get better."
