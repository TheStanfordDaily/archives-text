# The 						Axe at last! Men's rugby beats the Weenies

Stanford 24
California 21

Sixteen years ago, most Stan
ford students were still watching
Sesame Street and Jimmy
Carter was in the White House.
Sixteen years ago was also the
last time Stanford won rugby's
version of Big Game — before
Saturday.
In one of the biggest wins in
recent Stanford sports history,
Stanford defeated California 24-
21 on the Bears' home turf, end
ing Cal's U.S. collegiate record
winning streak of 98 games and
paving the way for Cardinal to
move into post season play.
The first half was back and
forth, with Stanford scoring three
penalty kicks and Cal coming back
each time with a score of their
own. .Just before the half, Stan
ford penetrated far into the oppos
ing end and held the ball close to
the goal line, but before the Cardi
nal could score, the half ended
with the score knotted at 9-9.
"We thought we controlled
the first half, but didn't think
the scoreboard reflected that be
cause there were some opportu
nities in the first half we weren't
able to capitalize on. Our coach
helped us to focus and we came
out in the second half ready to
play," said senior captain Jeff
Siemon
In the second half, Stanford
controlled the game, holding the

ball in Cal's end for much of the
time, but could not score. The
score stayed tied until about
halfway through the second half
when Stanford wing Dave
Warter broke free on an 80-yard
run, escaping five tackles and
setting up a try by senior Bobby
Blunt. The conversion kick
pushed Stanford's lead to 16-9,
Five minutes later, Stanford
scored a second try after senior
Jared Hopkins ran back a kick,
breaking numerous tackles in
the process. The conversion kick
was no good, but the Cardinal
later added a fourth penalty
kick. The lead stood at fifteen
points, 24-9.
With five minutes left, Stan
ford sensed the end was near and
was emotionally and physically
spent due to Cal's physical style
of play.
"Cal comes at you and at you
and beats you into the ground
and by that time we were beaten
up," Siemon said.
Sensing Stanford's condition
and the looming defeat, the No.
1-ranked reigning national
champions were not about to go
down without a fight. Cal
stormed back, pressing down the
field and scoring two late tries,
but it was too little as Stanford
held on to win its first Big Game
since 1980,24-21.
Following the game, current
and past players celebrated the
huge win. "It was an incredible
feeling, but the best part was
seeing our coach and all the
alumni there who had never beat
Cal. Thev were shedding more

tears than most of the players,"
said senior captain Bobby Blunt.
"This has been a goal for our
coach, Franck Boivert, for a long
time and it was really special to
win it for him."
Siemon added: "This means
so much to the players and alum
ni and since Franck came here
eight years ago, we've been fo
cusing on beating Cal, and it's a
tribute to the past and present
players that we were able to win.
Holding the Axe for the first
time in sixteen years was a great
feeling."
Monday at 5:00 p.m. in the
Hall of Fame Room in the Arril
laga Family Sports Center, the
Big Scrum Axe will be presented
to Stanford's Hall of Fame in
what will surely be an emotional
moment for players, coaches and
alumni,
In addition to the significance
of winning Big Game for the first
time in sixteen years, the victory
has serious playoff implications.
Through this win, Stanford has
put itself in a favorable position
for postseason play.
The game which will deter
mine the league championship
takes place next Saturday when
Cal plays UC-Davis. Even
though the Bears downed Davis
earlier in the season, Davis has
beaten Stanford, so it should be a
close, hard-fought game. If Cal
wins, there will be a three-way
deadlock at the top of the Pacific
Coast Rugby Union standings.
The league championship would
then come down to a tiebreaker
of total tries scored, which Stan
ford currently leads, but could go
either way after next weekend's
games. If Stanford was able to
win the league title, the Cardinal
would be guaranteed a spot in
the Sweet 16 of the national
championship tournament.
If Cal wins, however, UC-
Davis will be league champs and
Stanford would be forced to play
a tough road game against a
team from the Pacific Northwest
Division to gain entry into the
Sweet 16.
Senior Chris Grasso summed
up the Cardinal victory.
"It was a great feeling. Our
goal every year is to beat Cal and
it was definitely my best experi
ence playing rugby at Stanford.
The key was that instead of play
ing like fifteen individuals, we
played like a fifteen-man unit."
Through their teamwork,
Stanford did the unthinkable
and hopes to carry the momen
tum from this game into the
playoffs.
