# Men's gymnastics falls to Cal
## Golden Bears too much for injury-riddled squad 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
Stanford men's gymnastics
struggled this weekend in a tour
nament against California and
San Jose State, losing to Cal by a
wide margin. California scored a
combined 227.2, Stanford scored
219.75 and San Jose State post
ed a total of 209.3.
The Stanford men simply
could not hit their routines as
the Stanford gymnasts
"missed," meaning made mis
takes in, 17 of the required 24
performances, according to
sophomore Jeremey Herman.
Although the performance
was disappointing, sophomore
Gabe Edelman described it as
"expected" because of changes
that the team has undergone re
cently.
"[Head coach 1 Sadao [Hama
da] hasn't been preparing us to

hit all of our routines at this com
petition. We've been working on
integrating new skills to boost
our difficulty," Edelman said.
"In the next few competitions we
should see more consistency."
Some significant absences in
the competition probably con
tributed to the weak perfor
mance, including that of Hama
da, who opted to accompany
Stanford graduate Jair Lynch to
the American Cup in Dallas,
Texas instead. Additionally,
sophomore Clarence Miao only
competed in the pommel horse
due to a sore ankle and sopho
more Jeremy Herman skipped
his high bar due to a hurt knee.
"(Hamada's absence) might
have made people feel a little less
secure, but overall, because the
team is all there and everyone's
supporting each other, it was
okay," Herman said.
However, there were a couple

of highlights to the meet â€” se
nior Peter Hegi won rings with a
9.7, and junior lan Bachrach
won the vault with a 9.7.
Bachrach also competed in the
parallel bars for the first time in
four years. His score of 8.35
ended up counting as one of the
top four for the team in that
event.
"I was nervous and excited, I
definitely wanted to do some
thing to help take the team to a
higher level," Bachrach said. "I
am willing to put forth the effort
to help the team out in any way."
The Cal gymnasts put forth a
strong showing this weekend,
hitting most of their routines,
but Edelman highlighted the
fact that Berkeley's season-high
would likely remain around the
point total they tallied this week
end, whereas Stanford's score
should improve drastically over
the course of the year.
