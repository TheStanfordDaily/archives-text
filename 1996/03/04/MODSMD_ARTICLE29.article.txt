# Women fall short in Invite
## 
### Keith Rabkin Contributing writer 
Last Friday, the women's gym
nastics team challenged the 10th
ranked Arizona State Sun Devils in
Burnham Pavilion for the Chili's
"Red Hot" Invitational title. Stan
ford lost the meet with 195.350,
only .125 points lower than the Sun
Devils' outstanding 195.475.
The close loss brings the Cardi
nal's record to a measly 2-5 and an
ugly 0-4 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. The record, however, can be
misleading. By scoring 195.375, the
gymnasts set a new school record
breaking both their season high
from last week and the all-time
record established at last year's invi
tational.
While the team was happy with
their record-setting performance, it
was thoroughly disappointed by its
loss.
"We broke the school record for
team score, but we were really dis
appointed to drop another meet to
tough competition," said freshman
Amy Murakami.
Murakami put forth another
great performance, scoring an al
most-perfect 9.95 on the floor exer
cise. This score was good enough for
the school's all-time high in the
event, breaking the previous record
of 9.9 which had stood for nearly two
seasons.
"We just keep improving each
meet," Murakami said. "Hopefully,
the trend will continue and we can
use these records to establish wins."
While Murakami was outstand
ing for the third straight meet, the
real story belonged to sophomore
Keri Monahan. Monahan won first
place in the invitational with a new
school record of 39.5. This score
broke the mark she had set last
week of 39.3. She dominated, plac
ing in the top three in all events and
setting the school record on beam
with a 9.9. She also tied the school's
third-best record on bars with her
first place performance of 9.825.
Monahan now owns the school
record in the vault, the beam, and
the all-around competition.
"She has simply been amazing,
nothing can stop her," Murakami
said. It marked the fourth time this
season that Monahan had the top
score amongst the Cardinal gym
nasts, and the third time she has led
all competitors.
The other two freshmen had
their best meets of the season as
well. Katie Fitzpatrick scored third
place on the beam with a 9.825, her
best score of the season. That score
was good enough to tie for third on
Stanford's all-time list on that appa
ratus. Tracey Kohl finished second

overall with a 38.95 — the Cardi
nal's third-best all season. In her
best meet of the year, Kohl tied
Monahan for first with a 9.9 on the
floor. The two now share the all
time record in that event.
Yet the strong showings by these
two gymnasts were not enough to
put them over John Spini's Sun
Devils. The performances of the rest
of the Cardinal were good compared
to their season highs, but too weak
to challenge ASU. With this win Ari
zona State moves into third place in
the Pac-10 with a record of 3-2 and
7-3 overall.
Lisa Izzi's gymnasts will practice

hard for the rest of the week i n an at
tempt to improve for their upcom
ing meet against Oregon State. This
meet against the Beavers will be the
team's last before the Pac-10 Cham
pionships. To earn a berth, the Car
dinal will have to put on a truly stel
lar performance.
"We keep improving at every
meet," Murakami said. "We just
need to improve a little more to beat
OSU."
Izzi will push the team hard to
better its performances A few
changes to the individual routines
are ail the team needs to bring its
score up a few points.
