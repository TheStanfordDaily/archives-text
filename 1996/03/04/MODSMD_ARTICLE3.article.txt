# It's a tossup
## Stanford Court Jugglers still at it after 16 years 
### Mary Megan Peer Contributing Writer 
Diners at Ricker will be surprised if they
walk into their dining hall after Wednesday
night's meal. Between the cash registers
and the napkin dispensers, about 15 people
throw balls, clubs and even cigar boxes in
the air. They are the Stanford Court Jug
glers, a club with a 16-year history on
campus.
Students, faculty and members of (he
community gather once a week to practice
their juggling skills. They meet, said club
director and founding member Martin
Frost, "because it's fun."
"One aspect of juggling — called passing
— needs two or more people, and the more
the merrier," Frost said. "And since in jug
gling there are always new things to learn
or develop, having interactions promotes
expansion of one's range of possibilities."
An important part of the club is the ex
change that goes on between members,
Frost said. The members are all willing to
teach anyone who comes in and are con
stantly exchanging tricks.
Frost, who is a systems software devel
oper for the University, said the club was
established to teach juggling skills to the in
terested students who passed by Memorial
Court when Frost and his friends were
practicing. When the club was founded in
1980, they called themselves the Stanford
Memorial Jugglers "because we met in
Memorial Court and everything else was
Memorial something," said Frost.
"But we kept getting asked what Memo
rial was for, so we changed the name to in
clude the other half of the name of the place
where we met, which created a still relevant
but happier-sounding name," Frost said.

Juggling grew in popularity, both on the
Stanford campus and nationwide, and in
1991, 1992 and 1993, the Stanford Court
Jugglers held festivals in Roble Gym. More
than 200 jugglers from all over the state at
tended these events, Frost said. The club
hopes to host another festival in ayear or so.
Today, conventions tend to have 600 to
800 people with the biggest, often held in
Europe, hosting 3,000 jugglers, explained
Frost.
"When else besides a convention are you
able to find 500 people all juggling in one
room?" asked Frost.
Frost said his specialty is passing, which
means standing in a group and throwing
clubs back and forth among the members.
There are both traditional and "ran
dom" feeds, in which the passer does not
follow a pattern. Frost said he has been in
volved in passing groups of up to about 20
people. "That's the most you can have to
maintain a reasonable pattern," he said.
On Wednesday nights the Stanford jug
glers practice passing in large groups as
well as doing individual tricks. Last
Wednesday, freshman Jake Olefsky was
practicing his "Mill's Mess," a complicated
but popular style of juggling which involves
three to five balls.
Olefsky, one of the club's vice presi
dents, has been juggling for more than a
year. "I was on the tennis team in high
school and I didn't get to play much. But I
had a lot of tennis balls so I learned to jug
gle," Olefsky said.
The Stanford Court Jugglers meet
every Wednesday at 7:15 p.m. in Ricker
Dinning Hall. They welcome new mem
bers, including those who have never jug
gled before. For more information, call
Jake Olefsky at 497-1510 or just show up.
