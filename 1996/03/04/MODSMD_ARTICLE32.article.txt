# Haas Center gets a mentor
## Stuart Burden visits Stanford and shares his expertise 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
Stuart Burden is a man of many experiences.
A 1984 graduate of Stanford, Burden has woven his
diverse background in human biology, gay and lesbian
issues and other topics into a career in community ser
vice.
Last week, he returned to campus as a visiting men
tor for the Haas Center for Public Service to share his
expertise with students.

The Visiting
Mentors Pro
gram aims to
"provide models
of distinguished
careers and ex
perience in pub
lic service to
Stanford stu
dents," said
Jackie Schmidt-
Posner, student
development co
ordinator at the
center.
Although
Stanford stu
dents have a
good idea of
what to do with
their degrees,
Burden said, he
encouraged
them to look at
all the options.
"Many of the
Stanford stu
dents I've met
have a clear
sense of what
they want to
do," Burden
said, "and I

1 don't think that
this conversation
would have been
welcomed
12 years ago.'

think one of the reasons I'm here is to offer encour
agement as they pursue these goals."
Burden is currently a senior program officer in the
Chicago-based Mac Arthur Foundation's population
program, which is responsible for grantmaking in
Mexico and Brazil. Burden graduated from Stanford
with a degree in human biology.
"When I was a student there was a bit more opti
mism about what we would find when we graduated,"
Burden said. "I think today's students are more wary,
more cautious and more concerned."
Burden met Tuesday for a brown bag lunch with

students in the Human Biology Department, dis
cussing the numerous options other than medical
school available to human biology majors. Burden said
he encouraged the students to take courses they were
interested in and to "be adventurous at Stanford and
take advantage of the numerous course options,"
rather just sticking to the typical pre-medicine cur
riculum.
"We've all read articles about how young people
today will fmd it more challenging to achieve or sur
pass the level of achievement of their parents, and I
think it weighs heavily on a lot of students," Burden
said.
"There's a lot of doubt about the future, which I'm
sort of surprised to find, but it makes sense when you
think of all the reports we've been bombarded with
about the difficult job market and economic uncer
tainties."
The visiting mentor's experience with gay and les
bian issues and "population issues" — or racial and
cultural issues affecting an entire population — was
the topic of a talk on "Civil Rights vs. Gay Rights: Is
there a difference?" last Monday in Ujamaa, the
African-American theme house.
Burden's grantmaking focuses on reproductive
health and rights issues, HIV prevention and ado
lescent sexuality education. He is also on the board
of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund,
which deals with human rights for lesbians and
gays.
"1 was thrilled to find an openness to discussing
this theme in Ujamaa," Burden said. "I don't think
that this conversation would have been welcomed 12
years ago. Discussing lesbian and gay issues within
the black context is not very common. The black
community has almost a, 'Don't ask, don't tell' con
ception."
Several of the lesbian students he talked with spoke
of a "significant network that they were part of with
each other," Burden said. "They weren't struggling
like I was as an undergraduate about my sexual identi
ty.... I think that's great, that they feel it's a safe
space to be out. That's a credit to the students; that's a
credit to Stanford."
Despite his praise for the school and community,
Burden said he has one concern— that students cul
tivate an international perspective and be involved in
public service from the day they leave campus.
"Many students plan to get involved when they are
professionally established and economically secure,"
Burden said, "but I think there are many contribu
tions people can make from the day they graduate —
volunteer work, work within communities, serving on
boards, becoming active in campaigns . . . continuing
to think of others as they pursue their own personal
