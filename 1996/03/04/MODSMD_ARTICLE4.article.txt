# Lines in the sand being drawn: Parties debate election issues
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Even though the ASSU's two po
litical parties say they share the
same general goals — to improve
student services and quality of life
on campus — they remain sharply
divided on several issues as the
spring general election approaches.
The Students' Alliance and the
People's Platform differ on four
major issues: the importance of
structural reform as proposed in
"Constitution '96," how much at
tention the ASSU should focus on

national policy
making, what the
role the ASSU
should play in as
suring that stu
dent groups re
ceive funding and

the party's influence on senators.
'Constitution '96'
The 10 Alliance candidates for
the senate say they unanimously
support "Constitution '96: A New
Constitution for the ASSU," au

thored by senior Michael Slemmer
and sponsored by undergraduate
senator Andre Vanier, an Alliance
member.
The proposed legislation, which
will be further discussed at tomor
row's senate meeting, would replace
the current four-person Council of
Presidents with a single president,
reduce the size of the senate by 25
percent, give all senators voting
privileges and form a judicial branch
of the ASSU.
"By restructuring the ASSU,
things will get done much more
quickly and efficiently," said fresh
man Robert Windom, chair of the
Alliance and a senate candidate.
"With a faster-acting senate, the
ASSU would be able to put student
desires into effect more smoothly
and rapidly.
" 'Constitution '96' would strength
en all branches of the ASSU. The ju
dicial branch, in par'icular, would
create a greater balance of power
and make the ASSU a more respon
sible organization and more ac
countable to students," he said.
People's Platform leaders, whose
opinions on "Constitution '96" dif
fer, insist that the ASSU should
concentrate on continuing dialogue
with students to make them aware
of important issues related to re
form.
"The Platform's top priority is to
ensure that student government
makes earnest and continued at
tempts to gather student opinion in
ways that give a voice to every stu
dent on campus," said ASSU deputy
senate chair Bill Shen, a Platform
member. "[ThLs legislation] is far
too important to be dealt with exclu
sively in the senate. We want to pass
it along to students and allow them
to vote on it."
Arguing that the ASSU's current
fixation on structural reform is dis
tracting the senate from issues
more relevant to the student body
as a whole, COP chair Mike Choo, a
Platform member, asked, "What av
erage student cares about the shape
and structure of the ASSU? We
should stop talking about internal

reform and think more about how
to make sure students feel positive
external effects of our advocacy."
National or local?
Central to the Platform's philos
ophy is the belief that the ASSU is
responsible for gauging how Stan
ford is affected by national policy
making, Choo said.
Last spring, party members led a
letter-writing campaign against
proposed cuts to federal financial
aid programs. About 20,000 to
30,000 letters were sent to politi
cians in Washington, Choo said.
Early this quarter, COP member
Rich Stolz and other party members
opened the Office of Financial Aid
Awareness in Tresidder Union.
Responding to criticism that the
party pays too much attention to the
national scene, Choo said, "We
don't take stands on national issues.
We take stands on how national is
sues affect students locally."
In contrast, the Alliance believes
"although national issues are im
portant, we as a party feel our stu
dent government's ability to influ
ence policy-making on the national
level is limited," Windom said.
Undergraduate senator Steve
Russell, an Alliance member, said
the popularity of a proposed bill in
1991 among students showed that
many agreed that the ASSU should
focus on campus issues.
The bill, authored by graduate
senators Douglas Bone and John
Overdeck, limits the scope of the
ASSU's legislation to issues that af
fect Stanford students directly.
"It provided a blueprint for bal
ancing the ASSU's commitment to
students in the context of broader
national and state university is
sues," Russell said.
Funding student organizations
Created in 1986 as a response to
budget cuts to the University's eth
nic centers, the People's Platform
ranks maintaining close ties with
the ethnic centers and communities
and ensuring that they and other
student organizations receive fund
ing each year among its highest pri
orities.
"It Is the Platform's belief that
student groups and activities add a
lot to student life," Choo said. "For

that reason, we try to fmd innova
tive ways to make sure that these
groups get funded each year....
Our party's roots are closely tied
with the ethnic centers, but since
then, we have expanded to include a
wide variety of other student
groups. We believe that helping stu
dent groups benefits the student
body as a whole."
The Alliance, however, disagrees
with the Platform's focus on fund
ing, arguing that ASSU advocacy
should concentrate on individual
students and not student organiza
tions.
"The People's Platform spends a
m£uority of their time on making
sure special-fee groups get their
funding," Russell said. "That focus
is very narrow. Over the past 10
years, (the party] has developed an
institutionalized bias toward stu
dent organizations, which is prob
lematic since those organizations
have the power to endorse candi
dates."
Party influence
The People's Platform holds
weekly caucus meetings to discuss
items that will be on the senate's
agenda. These meetings "make sure
senators are fully prepared for a
thorough discussion of the issues at
hand and understand their ramifi
cations," said Shen. "Consensus is
always the goal, but everyone
doesn't agree all the time."
Alliance senators say they dis
agree with this practice, arguing
that senators shou Id arrive at their
opinions independently, free of the
influence of other party members.
"We are not pressured by the
party to have any view or vote a
certain way," Windom said.
"There is no 'group mentality.'
Each member is encouraged to de
velop his or her own individual
consciousness" regardless of the
opinions of others.
The People's Platform is cur
rently the majority party in the
ASSU senate, holding eight of the
10 undergraduate voting senator
seats. The COP is also affiliated
with the party. The Alliance, creat
ed last winter, has two voting un
dergraduate senators, two nonvot
ing undergraduate senators and
two graduate senators.
