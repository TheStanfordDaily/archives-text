# Three COP slates will run in spring election
## 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
Students can choose from three Council of
Presidents slates in this spring's general election,
ASSU Elections Commissioner Ryan Medders
said yesterday.
The slates include two indepen
dent slates — "If I Ran the Zoo"
and"For Real" — and a slate with
no affiliation, "I Prefer to Have a
Single President." In addition, a
fourth slate sponsored by the
Chaparral is trying to get on the
ballot.
According to slate members, "If
I Ran the Zoo" hopes to bring at
tention to a number of graduate
student issues, including graduate
student housing, the development
of a commission to review gradu
ate student education and ways to
increase cooperation between
graduates and undergraduates.
"We'd like to increase the effi
ciency of student government,"
said slate member Trisha Tang, a
graduate student in chemistry.
In addition to Tang, the slate is
composed of Christopher Hoff
man, a graduate student in mathe
matics, Amit Mehta, a graduate
student in biophysics, and Emily
Osborn, a graduate student in his
tory.
The other independent slate,
"For Real," is composed of ASSU
deputy senate chair Bill Shen, un
dergraduate senator Angela Park

er, and juniors Jason Stephenson
and Ben Decker.
Shen, the slate's spokesman,
said he is confident of victory in the
election, which will be held April
17 and 18.
"I think winning is the easiest
part," Shen said. "Our most im
portant challenge is to revitalize
the ASSU as a legitimate student
government and to realize its po
tential."
Shen said the slate hopes to
draw more students to the ASSU.
"Our first priority is: 'How do we
regain the credibility and the legit
imacy of the ASSU?' We are the
only slate willing to re-market the
ASSU."
The slate with no affiliation, "I
Prefer to Have a Single Presi
dent," supports "Constitution '96:
A New Constitution for the
ASSU." The proposed legislation,
which will be further debated at to
morrow's senate meeting, would
replace the current four-person
Council of Presidents with a single
president, reduce the size of the
senate by 25 percent, give all sena
tors voting privileges and form a
judicial branch of the ASSU.
Members of the slate lack polit
ical experience, but say they hope
students will support their en
dorsement of a single president.
"We feel that a single president

could address the issues better,"
said freshman Peter Vlastelica, a
member of the slate. "We think the
students will see this as a good op
tion."
If they are elected, the slate
plans to resign and hold a special
election for a single president.
In addition to Vlastelica, the
group is composed of sophomore
Steven Liu and freshmen David
Guendelman and Joseph Pawson.
Another slate, "Dictators from
Space" which is sponsored by the
Chaparral, applied to be on the bal
lot but was denied a space because
it lacked the 200 signatures neces
sary to guarantee a slot, Medders
said.
Members of the slate expressed
confusion at their exclusion from
the ballot, saying they were confi
dent they had collected enough sig
natures.
"This is completely new to me,"
said sophomore Eric Saxon, a
member of the slate. "We're defi
nitely going to get back on the bal
lot. We did the work and we're not
going to be denied from the ballot."
Saxon said the slate plans to ap
peal the decision to the Elections
Commission.
In addition to Saxon, the slate is
composed of juniors Chris Onstad
and Eugene Park and senior Sean
Kennedy.
