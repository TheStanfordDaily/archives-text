# Raza Day draws 350 high school students

### Marni Leff Contributing writer 
Sophomore Haydee Curioca
learned some important lessons
two years ago when she attended
Stanford's Raza Day Conference
as a senior in high school.
Curioca remembered these
lessons as she planned the work
shops for this Saturday's confer
ence, an annual event designed to
reach out to Chicano / Latino high
school students in the Bay Area.
"I remember coming back from
Raza Day so pumped up," Curioca
said. "When people think about
Mexican kids they think about
graffiti and gang fights but that's
not the way it has to be. We're
worth something and there is suc
cess in the future. We are not pre
destined for poverty."
The workshops she coordinated
for Raza Day, Curioca said, were
designed to communicate this
message to the 350 high school
students in attendance.
Started five years ago by the
Chicano / Latino student group
MEChA in an effort to teach high
school students about the impor
tance of going to college and re
ceiving an education, this year's
Raza Day featured the theme "Re
learning Our Past, Reclaiming
Our Future."
MEChA sent letters to more
than 60 high schools in Redwood
City, San Jose, Oakland, Menlo
Park and other cities, encouraging
them to bring interested students
to Stanford for a day of speakers
and workshops, said Raza Day Co
ordinator Carmella Schaecher, a

sophomore.
When she came to Raza Day,
Curioca said, she had already ap
plied to Stanford and UC-Berke
ley. But Curioca, who had always
planned to go to college, said she
was the exception rather than the
rule.
"Most of the kids who come to
Raza Day are ninth-, 10th- and
llth-graders," Curioca said. "It's
a really good age because coming
here can inspire them to work
harder throughout high school. A
lot of those kids don't go on to the
big schools, like I did, but I think
Raza Day encourages a lot of them
to check out community colleges.
"Whether they are valedictori
an of their class or have a 2.0
(grade point average), Raza Day
tries to teach kids it is important to
continue with their education,"
she added.
This year's theme, conference
organizers said, is based on the
idea that members of the Chicano /
Latino community need to under
stand where they came from be
fore they can figure out where they
are going.
Keynote speaker Carlos
Jimenez, a Los Angeles high
school teacher who wrote the pio
neer textbook for high school stu
dents on Chicano studies, encour
aged the students to push their
schools to create programs to
teach Chicano students about
their history.
"Jimenez went through a lot of
history that the kids were most
likely never exposed to before,"
Schaecher said. "At the end of the
day, the kids were coming up to us,
coming up to him asking how to
get involved and how to bring Chi
cano studies to their school."
While the students were initial
ly hesitant to ask Jimenez many
questions, Schaecher said as the
day progressed, they became more
enthusiastic and vocal.
After the opening keynote

speech, students attended work
shops on issues such as how to im
prove gang relations, alternatives
to joining gangs and how to start
organizations like MECIiA at their
own high schools.
Other workshops highlighted
historical issues, such as indige
nous culture, Chicano poetry and
the recent decision made by the
University of California Regents
to end affirmative action in admis
sions policies.
"Overall, I felt really good about
the workshops and the program,"
Curioca said. "Itagain teaches kids

to take responsibility for their fu
ture. They think there is nothing
else they can do so they turn to
committing crimes and stealing
money to help their families out.
Seeing people like us, like me, who
came out of the ghettos just like
them, shows them there is some
thing else.
"We're not rich. They get a
chance to talk to us and see that
we're real down-to-earth, just like
them. I was born in Mexico, my
family was on welfare. Conferences
like this provide support. It teaches,
'Hey, if we can do it, so can you.' "
