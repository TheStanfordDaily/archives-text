FJn>r lust re lie! Irom the nagging ache ol taxes, we
recommend TIAA-CREF SRAs. SRAs are tax
deferred annuities designed to help build additional
assets — money that can help make the difference
between living and living u-elt after vour working
years are over.
Contributions to your SRAs are deducted Irom your
salary on a pretax basis. That lowers your current
taxable income, so you start saving on federal and,
in most cases, state and local income taxes right away.
What's more, any earnings on your SRAs are also
tax deferred until you receive them as income. That
can make a big difference in how painful your tax
bill is every year.
As the nations largest retirement system, based
on assets under management, we oiler a wide runiic
ol allocation choices Irom the TlAATradition.il
Annuity, which guarantee- principal and intcie-i
(backed by the company's i laims-paying ability ).
to TI AA-CREFs diversified \ ariable annuity
accounts. And our expenses are ver\ low,* which
means more of your money goes toward iinpro\ iny
your future financial health.
fo find out more, call 1 800 8-(2-28N8 We'll send
you a complete SRA information kit. plus a free
slide calculator that shows you how much SRAs
can lower your t.i \es.
