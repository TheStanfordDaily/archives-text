# Former GSB dean dies
## Colleagues recall Rene McPherson with admiration 
### Boris Bershteyn 
Rene McPherson, former dean of the Graduate
School of Business, died at age 71 on Feb. 26 at his
home in Florida.
According to a memorandum from Michael
Spence, the current dean of the Business School, his
predecessor "succumbed to pancreatic cancer."
McPherson assumed his position at Stanford in
1980. Business School Prof. James VanHorne,
who served on the search committee that selected
him, described the former dean as "full of inter
esting ideas on management and management
practice."
Business Prof. Emeritus Charles Horngren re
membered McPherson for "always making things
happen."
"He was dynamic and stimulating," Horngren
said.
However, an unfortunate automobile accident and
an uphill battle against cancer shortened McPher
son's time at Stanford, as he was slowed down by se-

vere pain. McPherson eventually left Stanford for
health reasons in 1983.
When told, "They say I might speak to you,"
McPherson would respond with "Who are 'they?' " re
membered Katherine Bostick, a former employee of
the Business School News and Publications Office. "I
liked him," she added.
A member of Fortune magazine's U.S. Business
Hall of Fame, McPherson was much praised for his
work at Dana Corp., an automobile components and
industrial products producer in Toledo, Ohio. He
served as president and chief executive officer from
1968 to 1980. According to VanHorne, his innovative
ideas helped make Dana "a corporation responsive to
the marketplace."
One of McPherson's almost legendary decisions
was to replace the corporation's thick policy manual
with a one-page statement still used today, Spence
said in the statement.
A graduate of Case Institute of Technology in
Cleveland and Harvard Business School, McPherson
was decorated as a bomber pilot in World War 11,
