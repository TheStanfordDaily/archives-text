## Another bomb kills 13 
### 
TEL AVTV, Israel (AP) — In a
scene growing horribly familiar, an
accelerating terror campaign
turned a day of light-hearted Jew
ish celebration into a nightmare of
blood and smoke when a suicide
bomber struck yesterday in the
heart of Tel Aviv, killing at least 13
people.
The victims included children in
costume and makeup for the holi
day of Purim. At least 109 people
were wounded in the attack, which
left a jumble of shattered bodies
and wrecked cars and paralyzed the
peace effort.
A mounting toll of dead and
wounded, the repeated scenes of
carnage and the heart-wrenching
despair of victims' families fueled a
deep upwelling of anger among
Israelis. It was the fourth suicide
bomb attack in nine days, the dead
liest stretch of terror in Israel's his
tory.
The death toll might have been
much higher if the bomber, who
was on foot when he carried out the
attack, had managed to enter a

crowded shopping center, authori
ties said. Israel radio said at least 13
people were killed.
The Israeli government decided
in an emergency session to form a
special anti-terrorism task force
with sweeping powers, led by the
head of the Shin Bet security ser
vice, Ami Ayalon.
Prime Minister Shimon Peres
suggested afterward that Israel
now reserved the right to strike
anywhere, including PLO-ruled
areas.
The task force would be "able to
act in every place to strike against
and punish" the suicide bombers,
Peres said. "We will reach every
corner where tliis terror is rooted."
Strikes in PLO-ruled areas
would violate the Israel-PLO
accords and badly discredit Pales
tinian leader Yasser Arafat among
his people.
A furious, wildly militant mood
swept over Tel Aviv, a city known
for its generally moderate populace
that supports peacemaking with
Palestinians and Arabs.

As government ministers met at
the heavily-guarded Defense Min
istry complex a mile from the
bombing site, crowds outside lit
bonfires and shouted "We want
war!" and "We want revenge!"
Others shouted "Death to
Arabs!" and one man held a sign
calling for a "final solution" against
them — paraphrasing the Nazi
term for the World War II slaugh
ter of millions of Jews.
In a call to Israel Radio, the
Muslim militant group Hamas
claimed responsibility for yester
day's bombing. Hamas has also
claimed the previous three bomb
ings, which killed 44 victims and
three Palestinian suicide bombers.
Faced with the possible collapse
of his three-year peace gamble,
Arafat said he was ready to cooper
ate fully with Israel in going after
Palestinian militants. But he added
that he hoped Israel would not act
hastily and break off peace talks.
"I hope that we will not reward
these terrorists," Arafat told
reporters in Gaza City.
