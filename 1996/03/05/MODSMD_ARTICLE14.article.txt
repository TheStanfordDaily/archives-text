## Education Dept. blames shutdown 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Education Department has been
unable to process 900,000 college
financial aid applications, leaving
high school seniors wondering how
much money they will receive to
attend college.
Yesterday, the department
blamed the backlog on a govern
ment contractor's computer trou
bles and work time lost due to bad
weather and the partial govern
ment shutdown.
The form, called the Free Appli
cation for Federal Student Aid, is
used to calculate how much a fam
ily can contribute to a student's
education. Schools use the infor
mation to determine eligibility for
financial aid and aid packages.
Normally, it takes 14 days for
the Department of Education to
process the applications, but some
forms received in early January
still have not been handled, said
Elizabeth Hicks, deputy assistant
secretary for student financial
assistance programs.
"We're hearing a lot of angst
from colleges," Hicks said.
At Penn State University,
financial aid officers normally
would be sending out awards this
week, said Anna Griswold, assis
tant vice provost for student finan
cial aid.
"We're very concerned," she
said, explaining that they cannot
make decisions for anyone until
they have information on most stu
dents they plan to accept. "There's
reason to believe they will get
caught up but I don't know that for

a fact. We're pushing it already."
Students and parents, wonder
ing why they haven't received their
financial analyses yet, have flooded
a question-and-answer phone line,
Hicks said. In response, the depart
ment has expanded the hours and
added more operators.
The department blames the
backlog on 21 days of work time
lost due to the partial government
shutdown and the blizzards that
closed offices during a crucial com
puter testing period.
In addition, the department has
a new contractor and is using a
new optical imaging system.
Hoping to catch up, contractors
have increased production at two
processing companies, which are
now working around the clock,
seven days per week. They also
have set up additional work sites.
The department now promises
to process by the end of March all
applications that were received by
March 1. Applications received
during March should be processed
by April 15, Hicks said.
But she cautioned that the com
puter problems may not be com
pletely solved mid she said it is pos
sible that the government will not
have information in time for col
leges to make financial aid awards
by May 1, the deadline set by most
colleges for students to accept
admission offers.
Education Secretary Richard
Riley plans to send a letter to col
lege presidents, explaining the sit
uation and asking them to consider
delaying that deadline, she said.
