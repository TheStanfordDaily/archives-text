# Tennessee Senate rules on evolution bill
## 
### 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - The state
where John Scopes was tried and convicted in
1925 for teaching evolution again wants to
restrict what students can be told about the
origins of man.
Legislation to fire any teacher who pre
sents evolution as fact was on the Tennessee
Senate agenda yesterday. It was expected to
pass despite an attorney general's opinion it
violates the constitutional separation of
church and state.
But the Senate voted 19-13 to send the bill
back to the Education Committee after six
amendments were introduced, including one
that would have protected teachers who want
ed to teach the Biblical theories of creation
along with evolution.

One that was adopted changed the bill to
say a teacher could be fired instead of shall be
fired.
Already this year, Tennessee senators have
gone on record in favor of displaying the Ten
Commandments in churches, schools, busi
nesses and homes for 10 days in May, and
against same-sex marriages.
"This is a trilogy that is making this state
a comedy," said Sen. Steve Cohen, a Memphis
Democrat.
The sponsor of the evolution bill is Sen.
Tommy Burks, whose home district is 45
miles northwest of Dayton, site of the 1925
Scopes "Monkey trial" He said he introduced
the bill because constituents told him evolu
tion was being taught as fact in Tennessee

schools. He won't say where.
The bill seems destined to pass the Senate
and then the House without significant help
from lobbyists. The conservative Eagle Forum
has been the most vocal backer of the bill,
which some lawmakers said is hard to oppose.
"You can't explain a no vote in a 15-second
sound bite," said Rep. Eugene Davidson, who
voted for the bill when it cleared the House
Education Committee.
Gov. Don Sundquist, a Republican, has not
said what he will do if the bill reaches his
desk.
The bill is more lenient than the law under
which Scopes, a substitute biology teacher,
was convicted of teaching evolution and fined
$100.
