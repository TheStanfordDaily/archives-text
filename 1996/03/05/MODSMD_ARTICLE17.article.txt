Rabin's killer takes the stand
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Assassinating Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin was an intellectual challenge similar to quitting smoking or
overcoming a dislike of computers, his confessed killer told the court
yesterday.
After much debate, Yigal Amir's lawyers put their client on the
stand in what appeared to be a diminished capacity defense. They say
Amir's obsession with removing Rabin from power reduced his abili
ty to reason on Nov. 4, when he shot and killed the prime minister at
a peace rally.
"One of the lessons of Judaism is to allow the intellect to overcome
the emotions," Amir, wearing a black skullcap and a white shirt, told
a hushed court in calm, assured tones.
"If the Torah tells you to do something against your emotions,
then it should be done," he said, referring to Jewish law. "For exam
ple, stopping smoking may be difficult, but it can be done."
Testifying earlier yesterday, police interrogator Arieh Silberman
said when he first questioned Amir, the defendant would argue that
his case was similar to that of battered wives who eventually strike
back against their husbands.
"He felt that his deed was not so terrible, and that he would be con
victed of manslaughter," Silberman said.
But Amir, explaining his opposition to Rabin's policy of ceding land
to Palestinians for peace, indicated he had always been in control.
"I want to emphasize that I was waiting for the right moment," he
said. "A decision such as this, to take down a leader, can change the
future of a nation."
The trial is scheduled to resume Thursday.
Whitewater jury selection begins
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Jury selection began yesterday in the
fraud and conspiracy trial of President Clinton's Whitewater partners
and the man who succeeded him as governor, with Clinton himself
subpoenaed to testify.
In this presidential election year, the trial could prove a liability to
Clinton, though his name is not even mentioned in the indictment
against James and Susan McDougal and Gov. Jim Guy Tucker.
The McDougals and Tucker are accused of misusing nearly $3 mil
lion borrowed from a pair of federally backed lending companies. They
allegedly lied to the bankers about how the money would be used.
The McDougals have subpoenaed Clinton, saying he can counter
claims made by David Hale, who ran one of the lending companies.
Hale is expected to testify for the prosecution that Tucker and then-
Gov. Clinton pressured him to make bad loans,, including one for
$300,000 to Susan McDougal 10 years ago.
Clinton has allied Hale's allegation "a bunch of bull" and has said
he doesn't recall talking to Hale about money.
Bobby McDaniel, a lawyer for Susan McDougal, said yesterday he
expects the president to testify in person. Clinton's lawyers prefer he
testify by videotape. No decision has been made.
If convicted on all counts, Tucker could get up to 52 years in prison
and fines of $2.75 million, and faces possible removal from office.
James McDougal faces up to 95 years and $4.75 million in fines, and
Susan McDougal faces up to 40 years and $2 million in fines.
Jury selection started from a 185-member pool, which was quickly
narrowed to 151. Fifty-six of those listened in the courtroom and the
rest watched via closed-circuit television while the indictment was
read. After lunch, individual interviews began and three people were
dismissed.
In a 12-page questionnaire filled out two weeks ago, prospective
jurors detailed their political leanings and whether they or their
spouses had given money to or worked for a campaign. U.S. District
Judge George Howard Jr. ordered their responses sealed.
