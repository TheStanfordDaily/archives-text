# Sinn Fein party barred from peace consultations; Protestants refuse to attend
## Peace efforts in N. Ireland stumble 
### 
BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) —
Efforts to get all of Northern Ireland's
parties involved in peace consultations
stumbled at the starting block yesterday.
The IRA-allied Sinn Fein party was
barred from attending; Protestant lead
ers refused to come because a "foreign"
Irishman was present; and other parties
who said they were ready to talk with one
another couldn't agree on where to meet.
The British and Irish governments —
who set the day's most important prece
dent by jointly overseeing the effort —
afterward shrugged off the half-empty
"consultative" talks at the Stormont
complex in east Belfast.
Britain's Northern Ireland secretary,
Sir Patrick Mayhew, called it an "inaus
picious" but "an entirely predictable
start."
He and Irish Foreign Minister Dick
Spring both defended the decision to
block Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams at
the Stormont gates, pointing to the Irish
Republican Army's Feb. 9 bombing in
London that ended a 17-month truce.
"We want the cease-fire reinstated and
then we can get on with having all-party
talks including Sinn Fein," Spring said.

Adams countered that the IRA
shouldn't have to resume its cease-fire in
order for his party to participate.
He noted "a strange irony" that he
was "being locked out of Stormont while
the unionists, who are boycotting this
consultative phase, are being rewarded
for their refusal to talk."
Leaders of Northern Ireland's two
Protestant "unionist" parties — who
support keeping Northern Ireland under
British rule — were boycotting the pres
ence of Spring, who they say represents a
"hostile foreign state." They object to a
1985 agreement that gave Ireland limit
ed power in shaping British policy on
Northern Ireland.
Mayhew instead will meet the union
ists tomorrow in London.
A goal of the Stormont talks, set to
run through March 13, is to produce a
mutually acceptable formula for a special
election in Northern Ireland in May. The
vote would determine how many seats
each faction will hold in negotiations
expected to start June 10.
If Northern Ireland's parties cannot
agree on a formula — and the prospects
look poor — then the British will imple

ment their own election plans, in consul
tation with the Irish.
Yesterday, Spring and Mayhew did
manage to meet with the Social Demo
cratic and Labor Party, the north's main
party for Catholics, who want the
province to become part of the Irish
Republic. SDLP leader John Hume told
the two governments they should have
allowed Sinn Fein's Adams into Stor
mont to talk with other politicians, even
if they themselves didn't want to meet
him.
And SDLP leaders firmly rejected sug
gestions that they go elsewhere to meet
unionist leaders, arguing that both gov
ernments intended Stormont's Castle
Building to be the sole venue for talks.
"We'll not be meeting them outside of
this building for the next fortnight,"
SDLP deputy leader Seamus Mallon said.
Representatives of the party affiliated
with the outlawed Ulster Defense Associ
ation — the largest Protestant paramili
tary group — were in Stormont yester
day but suggested they, too, would steer
clear of Spring. A party linked with the
outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force refused
to come.
