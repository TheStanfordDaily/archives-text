# Tea for 200
## Casper holds forum for student concerns 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
University President Gerhard
Casper yesterday fielded questions
from students on topics ranging
from the absence of on-campus
housing for sororities to alumni
giving.
About 200 people attended the
talk, titled "Tea and More Cookies
with Gerhard Casper," in Tresid
der Oak West. It was one of a series
of dialogues between students and
,he University president.
In one of the most heated dis
cussions of the tea-and-cookie ses
sion, sorority members confronted
Casper on the issue of why their
organizations are still unhoused
while fraternities with less-than
spotless behavioral records are
housed.
"This issue has been repeatedly
looked at, but the status quo has
been confirmed," Casper said. The

last examination of Greek housing
issues was in 1988, Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais said at the meet
ing.
"As a general rule, we do not
have one-sex housing; this is an ex
ception," Casper said, referring to
the "strong collegiate tradition" of
fraternity housing in the United
States.
Another student, sophomore
Taryn Upchurch, who solicits
alumni donations for the Stanford
Fund, said she has consistently en
countered alumni over the phone
who refuse to give back to the Uni
versity because of the "different
turn" they say Stanford has taken
since they graduated.
While Casper admitted that he
receives letters of complaint from
alumni on a regular basis, he said
that "the notion that our alumni
are punishing us [by not donating]
is unsupported."
About 35 percent of alumni do
nate, Casper said.
Casper said he will begin em
phasizing more strongly to enter
ing classes the importance of alum
ni donations to their education.
The attitude of "somebody pays

for it, but not me" is not a realistic
one, Casper said.
The president urged the audi
ence to abandon the impression
that Stanford is an institution with
unlimited resources.
"As far as I know, neither David
Packard nor William Hewlett has
discovered immortality, and we
have to worry about successors,"
the president admonished, draw
ing laughter from the crowd.
Responding to a question about

the University's commitment to
the humanities, Casper asserted
that "the facts are somewhat less
grim than they are made out to
be."
"The disinterest is not mine. I
am a humanities person if ever
there was one," he said. But "the
country generally is just not inter
ested in humanities.
"We will not keep the humani
ties alive unless the students are
interested," Casper said, noting

that when there are literature de
partments with only five students
and there is a dearth of interest in
foreign language study, it becomes
difficult to allocate teaching re
sources.
As for grade inflation, Casper
said that "it is completely unfair to
compare the most selective univer
sities with all universities" and
that he personally disagrees with
the system of grading on a scale.
The University admits students

because "we feel you are more than
qualified to do the work load. If you
were all making Ds, Dean Montoya
would be making mistake after
mistake and I should fire him with
due process," Casper said.
Finally, the president told stu
dents to take a more active role in
voicing their concerns.
"I urge you not to censor your
selves," Casper said.
Another talk with Casper is
scheduled for next quarter.
