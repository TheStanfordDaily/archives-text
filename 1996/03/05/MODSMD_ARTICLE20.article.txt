## Condoms on campus 
### 
Condom machines should
be installed in bathrooms
for increased availability

IN A SOCIETY plagued by
unwanted pregnancies, sexu
ally transmitted diseases and
AIDS, safer sex messages are per
vasive. At Stanford, information
al fliers posted in bathrooms
remind students about the dan
gers of unsafe sex, and both Ye
Olde Safer Sex Shoppe and the
Sexual Health Peer Resource
Center promote the practice of
protected sex — the SHPRC even
provides free condoms. The Uni
versity, however, must extend its
promotion of safer sex by provid
ing condom machines in every
residence.
Currently, the University does
not have a campus-wide policy to
place condom machines in resi
dences. A few machines exist in
random residence bathrooms or
laundry rooms, but these
machines are few and far between.
Many students who live in resi
dences with condom machines do
not know they exist because the
machine is generally located in
only one men's bathroom. To help
ensure students practice of safer
sex, the University should place
condom machines in residence
bathrooms — both mens' and
womens' — and publicize the loca
tion.
By randomly installing con
dom machines in dorms, the Uni
versity admits that there is a
need for such machines in resi
dences. But the current, haphaz
ard installments are both irre
sponsible and unfair, since it
neglects the needs of those in res
idences lacking condom
machines. The University must
ensure that the condom
machines are effective, and the
only way to do this is to install
the machines in a consistent

manner.
Condom machines must be
located in both men's and
women's residence bathrooms.
Limiting the machines to male
bathrooms is sexist and danger
ous because many women do not
know that the condom machines
exist. Women are perhaps more
impacted by unsafe sex than men
since women must bear the phys
ical burden of an unwanted preg
nancy and are more at risk of
contracting HIV through unpro
tected heterosexual sex. It is
therefore imperative that women
have the same access to con
doms.
Because many residences have
several men's and women's bath
rooms, a condom machine should
be placed in one men's bathroom
and one women's bathroom. Many
students only use one bathroom
and never enter the other bath
rooms in the residence, they may
not know the location of the
machine unless it is publicized.
Both resident assistants and peer
health educators should alert resi
dents to where the machines are
located.
In addition, condom machines
are needed in residence bath
rooms because the places where
students can currently obtain con
doms on campus — Ye Olde Safer
Sex Shoppe, Cowell Student
Health Service and Tresidder
Express — have limited hours.
Situations in which students need
condoms generally arise on the
weekends during the later hours
of the evening when all of the
places selling condoms on campus
are closed. Since many students
do not own cars, they are unable
to drive to a 24-hour store to pur
chase condoms.
In a time when unprotected sex
is life-threatening, the University
should not randomly and arbitrar
ily install condom machines in
residences. Instead, Stanford
should adopt a consistent policy
for installing machines, helping to
ensure students are able to prac
tice safer sex at all times.
