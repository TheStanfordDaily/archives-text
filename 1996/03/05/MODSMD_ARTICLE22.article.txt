## Taking notice of Taiwan 
### 
Raindrops ripple onto rice
paddies. Factories and high-rises
dapple the horizon. The road is
clogged with scooters, mini-vans, trucks
piled high with bok choy and pigs. Our
bus lumbers along as slowly as the water
oxen laboring in the fields beside the road.
The bus suddenly picks up speed. A glance
out the window reveals we're the only
ones moving. We've pulled onto the shoul
der, bypassing traffic and safety laws.
This gridlock fantasy is a reality for
the students of the Study Tour of the
Republic of China. (The Republic of
China — the ROC — is more commonly
known as Taiwan. China calls itself the
People's Republic of China.) The pro
gram, affectionately termed the Love
Boat, teaches college students about Chi
nese culture and language. Over the
course of six weeks, the Taiwanese gov
ernment took us to museums, paid for
classes, threw banquets and launched
fireworks in our honor. A country with
much of its populace in poverty spent
more than $1 million. Why do we deserve
such treatment?
The answer lies in the purpose. By the
end of the summer, we're supposed to
identify more with Chinese culture after
being seduced by the luxuries and indoc
trination. We learned to write and say Wo
men dou shr jung gwo ren — "we are all
Chinese" — in language class. The gov
ernment also gave weekly talks on topics

such as "Foreign Policy of the ROC" and
"Economic Policy of the ROC."
In theory, once wined, dined and rede
fined, we would write our representa
tives or even become a representative,
thus giving Taiwan an international
presence. Taiwan has been trying to gain
entry into the United Nations since it
was booted in favor of China. Fear of
reprisals from China has kept most
countries from establishing official ties
with Taiwan. Ironically, both govern
ments seek eventual reconciliation; the
discord arises in the interim process.
Thus, Taiwan, a thriving economy with
21 million people, lacks any official world
recognition. In a way, the Love Boat is a
colossal public relations campaign.
Whon I was younger, "Taiwan" was
the name stamped on the bottom of
cheap toys. The country was the vague
place where my parents grew up. Before
going to Taiwan I had never given much
thought to the country, let alone its
political status. Not many people do. Tai
wan seems like an unimportant little
island in the Pacific, too removed for
concern. The morass of issues, the deep
meaning of gestures seem too complicat
ed to understand.
I took notice last summer when Tai
wanese President Lee Teng-hui visited
Cornell, his alma mater. Outraged that
Lee was even allowed to step foot on
American soil, China started testing mis

siles a mere 75 miles off the coast of Tai
wan. And I took notice when China
began making warnings about Taiwan's
March 23 presidential election. This first
democratic election angers and threat
ens the autocratic regime in Beijing.
Despite all my snickering and snooz
ing at the political lectures, I wound up
caring about Taiwan. And I wasn't mes
merized or hypnotized or bamboozled.
What I'll always remember about Taiwan
is the people, not the money spent. Meet
ing the warm, funny locals, not the police
escorts, arrested my interest. Trying des
perately to order food at a sidewalk stand,
not listening to the brainwashing lec
tures, gave me something to chew. The
government tried to make me feel like
royalty when all it needed to do was make
me feel at home. Though I question the
lavish use of resources, I don't blame the
Taiwanese for their efforts. I also wonder
how to make people understand.
I don't pretend to offer an easy solu
tion. Beneath all the political propagan
da and ancient feuds, I found a basic
humanity with which I identify. We
must find the truth that goes beyond
nations and reaches back to the story we
all share.
