Students say facts deny bias in Law School hiring policy

JUST WHEN IT appeared the Law
School faculty would cower under
pressure from various minority
groups at the Law School arguing that
the failure to grant tenure to Professor
Bill Hing would evince the Law School's
inherent bias against minorities and
women, the facts came to the rescue not a
minute too late. You see, conspiracy theo
rists at the Law School posit that the fac
ulty secretly plots to keep minority and
women recruits away and to hasten the
exit of those currently on the faculty by
denying them tenure; baseless political
accusations are, however, no match for
the truth.
In reality, the Law School has an
explicit affirmative action program for
recruiting and hiring minority and
women professors, and the Law faculty
demographics have reflected the success
of the program â€” since 1990 the propor
tions of women and minority professors
have increased by nearly 100 percent and
25 percent, respectively, while the propor
tion of white male professors has fallen
20 percent. In addition, the Faculty
Appointments Committee in 1993, head
ed by then Professor Gerald Lopez (a
minority recruit himself), devoted six
months to a comprehensive nationwide
search for minority and women candi
dates, a search that yielded three employ
ment offers, none of which was accepted.

According to current Appointments
Committee Chair Professor Kathleen Sul
livan, minority and women recruitment
continues to be the highest priority of the
committee. Since 1993 seven permanent
offers have been extended to new faculty
members, 57 percent of those to women
and 29 percent to minorities, and 23 visit
ing professor offers (the mechanism by
which lateral recruits are hired) have
been extended, with 35 percent of those
to women and 17 percent to minorities.
Most recently, of the total entry-level can
didates reviewed by the Appointments
Committee, 44 percent were women and
44 percent were minorities. Similar per
centages are reflected in the review of
applicants for visiting professor positions.
Why then, when white males account
for only 27 percent of the visiting appli
cants, 37 percent of the entry-level candi
dates reviewed, and only 29 percent of the
permanent offers extended, is the Law
School faculty still overwhelmingly
white? Conventional wisdom ascribes this
fact to racism on the part of the faculty;
again, however, the facts prove otherwise.
Of the total number of visiting professor
applicants accepted since 1993, only 25
percent of the women have accepted
offers and 0 percent of the minorities
have done so. At the same time, 75 per
cent of the male applicants have accepted
their offers.

So, what is really going on here? In
fact, the Law School faculty is recruiting,
interviewing and making offers to women
and minority candidates in vastly greater
proportions than their representation in
the national pool of faculty applicants
would predict (i.e. affirmative action), but
these applicants are not accepting offers
to join the faculty. In contrast, the minor
ity of white males, whose applications are
reviewed and passed favorably on by the
faculty, are accepting their offers in three
out of four cases.
Yet, conventional wisdom assures us
that racism must explain the current fac
ulty demographic makeup, so where is it?
The conspiracy theorists blame the tenure
process (i.e. the controversy over the Pro
fessor Hing case), asserting that the facul
ty subjects minority and women profes
sors to higher tenure standards than they
do white male professors. They support
this allegation by complaining that the
faculty does not adopt the typical affirma
tive action response of lowering the stan
dards of scholarship in evaluating minori
ty and women tenure applicants. In other
words, the students would like the faculty
to adopt affirmative action hiring policies
in the first place (at the time of the
employment decision) and then, after the
faculty member has had seven tolO years
of opportunity to teach and write under
the tutelage of the Law School faculty,

judge their scholarship under a lower
affirmative action standard.
Why the need for this additional boost?
Because, according to the conspiracy the
orists, the "white male" conception of
scholarship is so inherently racist and
sexist that minorities and women can
never thrive in a system that is too blind
to recognize their talents and that holds
them back by daily indignities and attacks
upon their character and qualifications.
The plain absurdity of this suggestion is
revealed by the fact that it purports to
describe the Stanford Law School faculty,
where political liberalism and political
correctness run rampant, when in reality
it would be more indicative of a faculty
comprised of the chieftains of the Missis
sippi chapter of the Ku Klux KJan.
There is no reason why, after seven to
10 years of writing and teaching, on top of
an additional three to seven years of aca
demic training at elite universities and law
schools, minority and women faculty
members cannot be evaluated for tenure
under the same standards as white males.
To suggest otherwise is to patronize and
demean the scholarship potential of
women and minority professors and to
hold their progress back by the doubts and
insecurities of their own constituencies.
