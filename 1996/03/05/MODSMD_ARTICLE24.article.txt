# Objection to perceived stereotypes in cartoon
## 
### 
We are writing in response to the
series of comics entitled "Julie" depicting
a stereotyped Asian male and his rela
tionship to his mother. The character is
drawn as short and slight of build, wear
ing glasses and speaking in broken
English. His mother is painted as over
bearing and concerned solely about the
academic direction and success of her

son. These blatant stereotypes serve only
to reinforce the already negative concep
tions of Asians and Asian-Americans in
the Stanford community and elsewhere.
First, we are offended by the render
ing of "Mike" as small and scrawny while
his female friend is considerably larger
than he in stature. We doubt that this is
the result of the cartoonist's attempt to
draw an abnormally large female, but
rather an intent to portray "Mike" as a
diminutive Asian male. This, combined
with "Mike's" glasses, broken English
and generally passive demeanor, cannot

be seen as anything but a stereotype of
"dorky" Asian males.
Secondly, the portrayal of "Mike's"
mother is neither funny nor truly repre
sentative of Asian parents. She is seen as
unrelenting in her efforts to push "Mike"
into the sciences and goes so far as to
convince his political science adviser to
study physics. In essence, "Mike's"
mother is shown to be unreasonable and
domineering. Unfortunately, this is a
common stereotype held by many of the
uninformed and ignorant. Most Asian
parents we have encountered have been

supportive of their sons' and daughters'
pursuits in all arenas, and we resent
what we interpret as a negative charac
terization of our families. Although indi
viduals with characteristics like "Mike's"
may exist, it is socially irresponsible to
perpetuate these negative stereotypes.
We hope that in the future, the cartoon
ist would be careful not to invoke stereo
types for the sake of humor.
