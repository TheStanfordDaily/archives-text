## The 						Science Bug tells you how to scare away red eye

Q* What is red eye, and how does
9 red-eye reduction work ?
Alt looks pretty stupid, doesn't
• it? The camera flashes a few
• times before the picture is
taken, and it's supposed to prevent every
one's eyes from glowing bright red like
they're possessed. It just seems like it
would take more to scare the evil spirits
away, something more along the lines of
ugly dolls and Yanni albums. But since
I'm the Science Bug, and not the Voodoo
Bug, I'll just have to use plain ol' science
to scare away the red-eye demons.
Basically, red eye is caused by the
reflection of light off the back of your eye
balls. When you take a picture with flash,
the light from the flash enters your eye
and illuminates the back part of your eye,
the retina. The retina also happens to be
the part of your eye which detects light,
which is why incidentally, you happen to

see the flash. Duh.
Only a small part of the retina is lit up
when the flash goes off, because the front
part of your eye is always focusing light
onto the retina, so that you can see things
clearly. If it didn't focus any of the light
that came into your eyes, then the light
that entered your eyes would be hitting
your retina at all different places and you
wouldn't be able to see anything coher
ently.
Without any focusing, the light from
the flash would light up a large area of
your retina. With focusing, the light is
concentrated into a smaller area and
makes for a sometimes painful experi
ence. For the same reason, you should
never look directly at the sun. If you've
ever burned stuff with a magnifying glass
on a sunny day, just imagine the same
thing happening inside of your eyes. Or
you could watch old episodes of "F-
Troop" and get the same experience.
Binoculars, which have lenses bigger
than the ones built into your eyes, collect
even more light and could probably stir
fry your eyes if you looked at the sun with

them. And if you try to use a telescope,
you deserve whatever fate comes to you.
Anyway, there are a lot of blood ves
sels in the back of your eye. If you could
see the back of your eye, you would see a
lot of red, from all that blood. Unfortu
nately, it's really hard to see your own
retina, kind of like how it's really hard to
kiss your own elbow.
After the flash lights up your retina,
one small section is reflecting bright, red
light. This red light from your retina goes
back out of your eye. Because of the
optics of your eyes, the reflected light
heads back in the general direction from
where the flash came from. For all of you
who are wondering, you have no control
over this, so don't go trying to design
some kind of eye-laser gun. You'll just
hurt and embarrass yourself.
If your flash is located pretty close to
the camera, then this reflected light can
also be picked up by the camera and gets
recorded onto film as a tiny red dot in
each of your eyes. What makes things
worse, is that the flash is generally used
in dark situations. Bv definition there's

not as much light around when it's dark,
so the eye needs to let in more light to
function well.
In low-light situations, muscle fibers
in the iris, called the dilator pupillae,
widen the hole in the iris, called the pupil.
This allows more light to enter the eyes,
but it also allows more light to escape
from the eyes, causing horrendous red
eye.
There are a few ways to reduce red eye
when taking photos. One method is to
move the flash farther away from the
lens of the camera. If the flash and cam
era lens are far enough apart, then the
reflected light from the flash won't be
picked up by the camera. People don't
like this because it would require larger
cameras or detachable flashes. Tourists
look dorky enough with small cameras
hanging around their necks, they'd look
even worse sporting bulky cameras.
Another method to reduce red eye is to
diffuse the lighting from the flash, like
with those silly umbrella things that pro
fessional photographers use. If the light
doesn't come from one point, then red

eye is less likely. However, wearing a
large, reflective umbrella around your
neck is just stupid.
The most popular way to counteract
red eye is to reduce the size of the pupils.
In the presence of bright light, the open
ing in the iris is contracted by a muscle
called the sphincter pupillae. If I had a
tasteful joke, I'd put it here.
Red-eye reduction in cameras works
by emitting a sequence of flashes before
the photo is taken. The flashes serve to
contract the sphincter pupillae, which
reduces the size of the pupil. With a
smaller opening, less light can get into
the eye, and even less can get out. This is
what reduces red eye and causes your
pets to go silly.
But at least they don't look as silly as
people trying to kiss their own elbows.
