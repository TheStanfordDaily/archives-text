## Ban the gloves Let the sport of boxing die 
### 
Last week's issue of Sports
Illustrated included a fea
ture article on a man by
the name of Gerald McClellan, a
28-year-old African-American
who was nearly murdered last
February in London. After
being brutally beaten within an
inch of his life, McClellan un
derwent emergency brain
surgery and spent two months
in a coma, during which his
weight dropped to 128 pounds.

So what was this story doing
in the nation's leading sports
magazine? If you're unfamiliar
with McClellan's saga, then you
might be surprised to know that
no crime was reported, no
charges filed and no arrests
made after the deadly assault.
Why? Because the beating took
place within a boxing ring, pro
tected by law and sanctioned by
the sport's governing bodies.
The sport's governing bodies.
Anything strike you wrong?
The sheer brutality of boxing
has been brought into the pub
lic spotlight over the last year by
the maiming of McClellan and
the death of Jimmy Garcia. Gar
cia wasn't as lucky as McClellan
— after sustaining a brutal
beating at the hands of Gabriel
Ruelas during their title fight
last May, Garcia was rushed to a
nearby hospital, where he was
pronounced dead two weeks
later.
So what did Ruelas receive in

return for the brutal murder of
Garcia? No arrest, no convic
tion, no slap on the wrist — just
a seven-figure paycheck.
Of course, to place the blame
on Ruelas would be ridiculous
(after all, the situation could
just as easily have been re
versed). Ruelas, too, is a victim
of the sport of boxing, a tradi
tion of legalized killing that has
become nothing short of an in
stitution in this country.
The call for a ban on boxing
certainly isn't a novel idea. In
October, this issue was brought
to the forefront in the world of
sports after a Scottish fighter
named James Murray died in
England following his fight
with Drew Docherty. In re
sponse to James' death, the
British government investigat
ed the possibility of placing a
ban on boxing. They quickly de
cided against it.
Proponents of boxing will
cite numbers to support the no
tion that the sport is relatively
harmless. From i986 to 1992,
for example, 268 deaths oc
curred in other sports, includ
ing 40 in ball games. Over that
same span, only three deaths oc
curred in boxing. Furthermore,
the rate of deaths per 1,000 par
ticipants compares favorably
with that of other high-risk
sports like horse racing, motor
cycle racing and skydiving.
Forget for the moment that
Murray represented the sixth
boxer dead of head injuries in
just 19 months — the point here
is not statistics. We're not deal
ing with numbers, we're dealing
with people. We're dealing with
grown men trying to bludgeon
each other with their fists be
fore thousands of cheering fans.
While it is true that sports


Bobby
Cuza
like football and auto racing offer
risks comparable to those posed by
boxing on a purely statistical level,
the difference lies in the intent.
Boxing is unlike any other sport in
that its explicit purpose is to bash
in another man's head, to blast his
brain with so many blows to the

skull that he either loses con
sciousness or at least becomes so
disoriented that he can no longer
continue. Rendering one's oppo
nent unconscious is the ultimate
goal — death, in a sense, repre
sents the ideal.
Today, Gerald McClellan sits
in a wheelchair, blind, hard-of
hearing, his short-term memory
shot. Jimmy Garcia, James Mur
ray and a host of others — well,
we know what happened to

them. Even Muhammed Ali, the
greatest fighter of them all,
today suffers from Parkinson's
syndrome because of repeated
blows to the head sustained dur
ing 150-plus amateur and pro
fessional fights.
Boxing is not just dangerous,
it's a crime — it represents the
worst qualities of humankind.
Boxing is vicious, boxing is bar
baric, boxing is legalized murder.
Boxing should be banned now.
