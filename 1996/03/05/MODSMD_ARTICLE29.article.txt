# Tennis three-peats in Pacific Coast Invite
## Goldstein and Thomas give Stanford third-straight title, and sixth in last seven years 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
For the third consecutive year,
and the sixth time in the past seven
years, a Stanford team has won the
Pacific Coast Doubles tennis tour
nament. This year it was sophomore
Paul Goldstein and senior Jim
Thomas who brought the title
home. The pair entered the tourney
seeded seventh, and didn't drop a set
on their way to the championship.
Head coach Dick Gould was
pleased with the play of all four of
his doubles teams, but was particu
larly excited about Goldstein and
Thomas' performance.
"Paul and Jim played great all
week," he said. "They are really
going to be a strong force in doubles
for us. It's a real wonderful title for
them to have. A lot of great tennis
players have won it."
The Pacific Coast Doubles crown
they brought back from La Jolla is
not the only title Thomas and Gold
stein have won this year. The pair
<ilso won the Northern California
Regional tournament.
Goldstein is making a name for
himself as a collegiate doubles play
er. The title in La Jolla was his sec
ond in as many years. Last year he
won with partner Scott Humphries.
It was also the eighth major doubles
championship for Goldstein since
1994.
In the finals, Goldstein and
Thomas faced a veiy tough team
from Pepperdine. Ross Duncan and
Simon Asplin, from Australia and
Sweden, respectively, had already
knocked off two Stanford teams in
each of the previous two rounds.
The fifth-seeded Waves ousted the
team of junior Grant Elliott and se
nior Ricky Becker in the third
round, and then beat Stanford's top
team of senior captain Jeff Salzen
stein and freshman Ryan Wolters in
the semifinals.
Goldstein and Thomas were im
mune to the Cardinal-killers, how
ever, and won very convincingly, 6-
3, 6-2, to clinch the tournament

championship. When asked about
the importance of winning such a
large event, Thomas downplayed
the pair's accomplishments.
"There was definitely some good
competition out there, and it was
certainly nice to win," he said. "But
it is reallyjust a fun tournament. We
played well, and that is what is im

portant — more so than winningthe
title."
The victory was even sweeter for
Thomas because much of his family
was there to see him.
"It was great to see my parents,
my sister and my brother-in-law
while I was down there," he said. "I
had a great time."

Wolters and Salzenstein, the
tourney's No. 2 seed, were not dis
appointed with their semifinal loss,
although each admitted to playing
less than perfect tennis. Had the
pair been able to win the match,
they would have faced Goldstein

Sophomore Paul Goldstein teamed with senior Jim Thomas this past weekend and won the Pacific Coast
Doubles Championship in La Jolla, Calif.
and Thomas in an all-Cardinal final.
Unfortunately, they fell behind
early and ended up dropping a very
tight three-setter, 6-1,5-7,6-4.
"You always like to win every sin
gle match," Salzenstein siiid. "We
got o(T to a slow start and that hurt
us, hut there were a lot of good
things going on out there this week
end."
Salzenstein also noted that he

and Wolters are fast developing into
a powerful doubles duo. "Ryan
comes to play every day, and I'm
feeling confident about us as a
team," he said.
One of Wolters and Salzenstein's
wins came over future Cardinal
players Bob and Mike Bryan. The
twin brothers are seniors in high
school this year, but plan to attend
Stanford next fall. They didn't roll
over easy for the No. 2 seeds either,
losing in two close sets, 7-5, 7-6.
Elliott and Becker, the ninth
seeded team, advanced to the third
round relatively easily, but were

overmatched by Duncan and As
plin, G-l, 6-3. "We played well to get
to that point, but we were a little off
against Pepperdine," Elliott said.
"Ricky and I haven't been playing
together for very long. It's going to
take a couple of matches, but we'll
be a solid third doubles team."
Stanford's fourth doubles team,
sophomores Misha Palecek and
Charles Hoeveler take a great deal
of pride in their tennis as well. In the
second round, they outplayed Rice's
No. one team, splitting the first two
sets and then coming away with a 6-
3 third-set win.
