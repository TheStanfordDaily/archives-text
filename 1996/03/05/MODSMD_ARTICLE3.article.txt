# Smeal, Huerta speak on civil rights issues
## 
### Marni Leff Contributing writer 
As a child, Eleanor Smeal, presi
dent of the Feminist Majority
Foundation, hated the game musi
cal chairs. She felt it was set up to
create a whole bunch of losers and
only one winner.
"You have all these little kids
running around and everyone
laughs at the sucker who gets the
chair pulled out from underneath
them," she said.
Replacing the image of the chairs
with jobs, Smeal told about 90 peo
ple last night, presents a good pic
ture of what's going on now with
downsizing at large and small com
panies across the country. As people
continue losingjobs, Smeal said, the
need for a scapegoat will increase —
that's where Smeal sees affirmative
action entering the picture.
At the program, "Backlash! The
Sneak Attack on Women's Rights
and Affirmative Action," Smeal,
along with Dolores Huerta, co
founder and vice president of the
United Farm Workers, encouraged

students to get involved in protest
ing the California Civil Rights Ini
tiative which will be voted 011 in No
vember.
"The so-called Civil Rights Ini
tiative is an effort to repeal all civil
rights and all women's rights laws,"
Smeal said. "It's step one in repeal
ing civil rights and about step five in
repealing women's rights. It takes a
deeper hit on women, but it goes
after all anti-discrimination laws."
Smeal and Huerta said they be
lieve right-wing conservatives are
trying to disguise the initiative as
legislation that deals primarily with
ethnicity and race rather than
color.
"People vote their biases and the
Republicans are counting on that,"
Huerta said. "They are hoping peo
ple will play the racist card. They
want to send the women back to the
kitchens and the minorities back
where they came from. We are not
going to stand by and watch this in
justice happen. We are going to talk
out against it and preach out
against it and become active to cre
ate a just society."
Because the CCRI uses language
similar to the Civil Rights Initiative
of 1964, Huerta and Smeal said the
bill's writers are deliberately trying
to deceive voters.
"By using our language and call
ing it a 'civil rights' act they are try
ing to trick us into making us lose
our rights," Huerta said.
Though she believes the feminist
movement has come a long way in
the past 30 years, Huerta said legis
lation such as the CCRI turns back
the clock, a clear indication of the
continual need of affirmative action.
Affirmative action, Huerta ex
plained, was created to equalize.
Trying to end affirmative action
programs before equality is
achieved is pointless.
"At this rate, it will take us 300
years to get equity," Huerta said.

make up only 10 percent of the
house and 5 percent of the senate.
Are we willing to wait that long? It
don't think so."
