### Karim Fakhry Contributing writer 
The Stanford wrestlers returned
late Monday night from the Pacific
10 Conference tournament with a
mixed bag of emotions. At the tour
nament, which took place at Cal
State-Bakersfield on Saturday and
Sunday, the Cardinal achieved
some of its goals, but failed in at
taining others.
First, the bad news. The Stan
ford team placed seventh in the
tournament, missing its goal of a
top-five finish, behind Cal State-
Bakersfield, Arizona State, Oregon
State, Oregon, Cal Poly-Saint Luis
Obispo and Boise State. Senior
Matt Cano, who had a very strong
shot at making the NCAA tourna
ment in the 126-pound weight
class, as he did last season, missed
the qualification cut-off, finishing
the tournament with a dismal 1-3
record, earning him a disappointing
sixth-place finish.
Now for the goods news. Senior
star Tod Surmon took the champi
onship in the 142-pound weight
class, extending his win streak to 21
matches. Surmon is set to place
very high at the national tourna
ment.
"I feel I wrestled pretty well,"
Surmon said. "I've been solid all

year. I took (the match] like any
match all year. I wrestled my style,
didn't give up many points, and just
won the matches."
Surmon, like his teammates, is
very confident, about his perfor
mance in the NCAA tournament.
"I'm ready to win it,"he said.
"There is nothing to slow me down.
Everything is looking good."

Surmon's senior teammates
Jimmy Aguirre and Sahlan Martin
wrestled their way to NCAA tour
nament births in the 134- and 158-
pound weight classes, respectively.
Aguirre finished the Pac-10 tourna
ment with a 3-1 record and placed
third in his weight class, while Mar
tin finished with a 2-2 record, and a
fifth-place finish in his weight class.

"I was disappointed after the
matches I lost, but overall I wres
tled pretty well," Martin said. "I'm
happy that I'm in (he NCAA tour
nament." Martin narrowly missed
qualifying for the tournament last
season, ending up in the first alter
nate position. Aguirre, on the other

hand, has been to the tournament
before.
For those who did not qualify,
the tournament marks the end of
their season. This group includes
freshman B.J. Sanchez (150
pounds), sophomores Scott Chap
man (167 pounds), Jason Gladden
(177 pounds) and Chris Serjak
(heavyweight), and junior Bryan
Vaniman (190 pounds).
Seventeen-year head coach,
Chris Horpel, like the rest of the
team, had mixed emotions after the
tournament.

"Our three athletes wrestled
well," he said. "Tod Surmon is un
defeated, which is a first for me in
my 17 years at Stanford. We have
never had an undefeated wrestler
going into the NCAAs. Surmon be
came our first Pac-10 champion
since Jimmy Aguirre won the Pac
10s in his freshman year."
Horpel was also excited about
Aguirre's showing.
"Jimmy placed third in a very
competitive weight division," he
said. "In fact, he had to defeat na
tionally-ranked Jeremy Ensrud
from Oregon in the wrestle-backs
just to get into [that match]."
Martin was also a subject of Hor
pel's praise.
"I'm really glad Sahlan Martin

qualified for the nationals — he's
worked extremely hard," Horpel
said. "Sahlan never placed in state
[competition at the high school
level|, so it's great to have an exam
ple like him of someone who can
catch up and overtake the high
school superstars if one is dedicated
enough."
Horpel, however, was clearly not
happy with the team's overall fin
ish. "I was disappointed," he said.
"We lost too many of the close
matches to suit my fancy. I'm going
to have to talk with the team and
try to figure out why this happened.
While I realize we struggled with a
lot of injuries this season, I will
never accept losing more than our
fair share of the close ones."
