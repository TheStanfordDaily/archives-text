# Men's swimming adds one more qualifier
## 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
This weekend, a large contingent
of the Stanford men's swimming
team traveled to Long Beach to com
pete in the Pacific 10 Conference In
vitational meet. They went with a
goal: to qualify at least four more
swimmers for the NCAA champi
onships to be held March 28-31 in
Austin, Texas. With a maximum
total of 18 swimmers permitted to
compete, the Cardinal had already
qualified 14 entering the competi
tion last Friday.
In a meet that provided excite
ment for some and disappointment
for others, the Cardinal swimmers
went above and beyond their stated
goal. After taking only 17 swimmers
to the NCAAs last year, Stanford
added one automatic qualifier and
five consideration qualifiers. Now
head coach Skip Kenney will be
forced to make a difficult decision,
since some of the swimmers who
qualified will not be able to go to
NCAAs.
"It's a nice problem to have," said
junior Scott Jones. "I'm glad I don t

have to make the decision about who
goes."
Throughout the three-day meet,
Stanford's swimmers turned in sev
eral impressive performances. Per
haps the most encouraging was the

effort put forth by sophomore Jed
Crowe. Crowe shattered any doubts
about his ability by finishing with an
automatic qualifying time of 47.86
seconds in the 100-yard butterfly
and consideration qualifying times

in the 50- and 100-yard freestyle.
Sophomore Chris Olson also had an
excellent meet, getting considera
tion times in the 50 and 100 free.

The men's swimming team added one automatic qualifier and five consideration qualifiers this weekend
for the NCAA championships on March 28.
"We needed a few {>eople to step
up and swim fast," Jones said, "and
I'd say that happened. These guys
did a great job helping set us up for
NCAAs.
Olson and Crowe were not the
only swimmers who swam well this
weekend. In the absence of several of
the team leaders who will participate
in the Olympic Trials beginning to
morrow in Minneapolis, the Cardi
nal still had an incredibly fast team.
The 200-yard medley relay team of
junior Matt Martin, sophomore
Andre Salles-Cunha, Crowe and

Olson posted a time that placed in
the top five or six in the country thus
season. This is a completely different
team than the Stanford team that
qualified forthatevent in the Pac-10
championships in November.
Freshman Dan Schultz turned in
an outstanding performance in
achieving qualifying times in the 100
and 200 backstroke.
"A big improvement was Dan
Schultz," said Jones, "especially in
the 200 back. It was a great swim. He
had a plan when he went into the
race and he went out there and exe
cuted it."
I n addition to Schu ltz, Crowe and
Olson's cuts, four other Stanford
swimmers posted consideration
times in the meet. They include ju

niors Phil Trinidad in the 200
breaststroke, Casey Harmon in the
1650 free, and Martin in the 100
back, as well as Salles-Cunha in the
100 breast. They round out the qual
ifiers for a Stanford team that is pre
pared to compete for the national
championship in just over three
weeks.
"Overall, the meet was a suc
cess," Jones said. "Some guys were
swimming really fast, and others
weren't able to perform as they
hoped. But everybody enjoyed the
successes, so the team outlook was
very positive. We didn't have prac
tice today, so we didn't get a chance
to get together to share our excite
ment, but I'm sure when we do, it
will be electric."
