# Men's swimming adds one more qualifier
## 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
This weekend, a large contingent
of the Stanford men's swimming
team traveled to Long Beach to com
pete in the Pacific 10 Conference In
vitational meet. They went with a
goal: to qualify at least four more
swimmers for the NCAA champi
onships to be held March 28-31 in
Austin, Texas. With a maximum
total of 18 swimmers permitted to
compete, the Cardinal had already
qualified 14 entering the competi
tion last Friday.
In a meet that provided excite
ment for some and disappointment
for others, the Cardinal swimmers
went above and beyond their stated
goal. After taking only 17 swimmers
to the NCAAs last year, Stanford
added one automatic qualifier and
five consideration qualifiers. Now
head coach Skip Kenney will be
forced to make a difficult decision,
since some of the swimmers who
qualified will not be able to go to
NCAAs.
"It's a nice problem to have," said
junior Scott Jones. "I'm glad I don t

have to make the decision about who
goes."
Throughout the three-day meet,
Stanford's swimmers turned in sev
eral impressive performances. Per
haps the most encouraging was the

effort put forth by sophomore Jed
Crowe. Crowe shattered any doubts
about his ability by finishing with an
automatic qualifying time of 47.86
seconds in the 100-yard butterfly
and consideration qualifying times

in the 50- and 100-yard freestyle.
Sophomore Chris Olson also had an
excellent meet, getting considera
tion times in the 50 and 100 free.
