# Track takes second place at San Luis Obispo meet
## 
### Sam Wang Staff writer 
Bereft ,of many of its top run
ners, who are being held out in
favor of next weekend's NCAA In
door Track and Field Champi
onships in Indianapolis, the Stan
ford track and field team rallied
around the often overshadowed
but talented throwers and
jumpers to pull out a second-place
finish in both men and women's
competition in San Luis Obispo
over the weekend.
Fresno State captured top hon
ors on both sides of the meet, an
the men scored 229 points to the
Cardinal's 185.5 and the Lady
Bulldogs poured in 214 to Stan
ford's 179.
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and
Sacramento State finished in third
and fourth place, respectively, in
both men's and women's scoring.
With numerous impact run
ners missing from the mainstay

events in the middle and long dis
tances, the Cardinal throwers had
to step up to keep Stanford within
reach of Fresno State.
Sami Jo Small, a sophomore
from Canada, answered the call
admirably by placing first in the
javelin throw, with a hurl of 155
feet and 5 inches, second in the dis
cus, at 166-11, and third in the
hammer, at 129-11.
"I didn't go in expecting much
because it was the first outdoor
meet," Small said. "But I was real
ly pleased with my distances and
how our whole throwing squad
performed."
The squad's performances of
which Small spoke included senior
Sue Demars' fourth-place finish in
the discus, with an effort of 157-3.
Sophomore Katrinka Jackson
came in second in the shot put
after her throw traveled 41-91/4.
Jackson then topped her day off
by Landing third in the high jump.
Her attempt was two inches lower
than freshman Tracye Lawyer's
mark of 5-8, which was good enough
for first.
The throwers on the men's side
were just as motivated as those on
the women's. Adam Connolly, a
sophomore from Silver Springs,
Md., led the throwers with his first
place performance in the hammer,
heaving it 198-0. Junior Justin
Strand rivaled Connolly's perfor
mance with second-place finishes in
the shot put, the discus and the ham
mer. Despite his spot at the top of the
podium, Connolly was not quite sat
isfied.
"I was disappointed with my
marks because 1 've l>een doing much
better in practice. But for the first

meet of the year, it wasn't a total dis
appointment," Connolly said.
Despite the criticism he deposited
upon himself, Connolly was much
happier with his teammates' perfor
mances, which included an impres
sive jumping display from junior
Brian Maiming, who earned second
place in the high jump and the triple
jump and third place in the long
jump.
"Fresno State is a very difficult
team to beat in a dual-meet, tri-meet
situation because they have a huge
track team," Connolly said. "But
there were good efforts in all events.
We had a lot of good performances
and showed a lot of good signs. We
were definitely in the meet the whole
time."
Other important contributions
for the men came from red-shirt ju
nior Rob Reeder, who finished first
in the 5,000 meters, freshman Jau
ron Pigg, who came in second in the
long jump, junior Bryan Zmijewski,

who placed second in the 3,000-
meter steeplechase, and red-shirt
sophomore Mike Prindiville who
took first-place in the 1,500.
The meet marked the end of the
Cardinal's training period and, as
Small points out, the meet, because
of the absence of some the stars of
the team, allowed many other ath
letes to gain experience in a compet
itive environment.
From now on, however, it is all
engines go for the Stanford track
and field team, which will be fielding
its most competitive team possible
for all the upcoming events. But
Connolly warns against peaking too
quickly.
"We don't want to peak now.
We'd like to peak, ideally, around Big
Meet against Cal [held on May 4]
going into the Pacific 10 champi
onships [held two weeks later]. 1
think come Big Meet, we'll see a
Stanford team that might be one of
the best in some years."
