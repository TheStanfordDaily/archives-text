## 
### Sam Wang Staff writer 
Bereft ,of many of its top run
ners, who are being held out in
favor of next weekend's NCAA In
door Track and Field Champi
onships in Indianapolis, the Stan
ford track and field team rallied
around the often overshadowed
but talented throwers and
jumpers to pull out a second-place
finish in both men and women's
competition in San Luis Obispo
over the weekend.
Fresno State captured top hon
ors on both sides of the meet, an
the men scored 229 points to the
Cardinal's 185.5 and the Lady
Bulldogs poured in 214 to Stan
ford's 179.
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and
Sacramento State finished in third
and fourth place, respectively, in
both men's and women's scoring.
With numerous impact run
ners missing from the mainstay

events in the middle and long dis
tances, the Cardinal throwers had
to step up to keep Stanford within
reach of Fresno State.
Sami Jo Small, a sophomore
from Canada, answered the call
admirably by placing first in the
javelin throw, with a hurl of 155
feet and 5 inches, second in the dis
cus, at 166-11, and third in the
hammer, at 129-11.
"I didn't go in expecting much
because it was the first outdoor
meet," Small said. "But I was real
ly pleased with my distances and
how our whole throwing squad
performed."
The squad's performances of
which Small spoke included senior
Sue Demars' fourth-place finish in
the discus, with an effort of 157-3.
Sophomore Katrinka Jackson
came in second in the shot put
after her throw traveled 41-91/4.
Jackson then topped her day off
