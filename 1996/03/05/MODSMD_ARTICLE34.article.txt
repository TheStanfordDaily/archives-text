The Stanford women's water
polo team was on fire this week
end, as the squad ripped its way
through competition at UC-Santa
Barbara. The Cardinal dropped
only one game while winning
three, including a victory over
fourth-ranked UC-Davis.
Stanford pulled ofT a tight 4-3
victory over Davis on Sunday to
grab a third-place finish in the
Davis tournament. The Cardinal
relied on tough defense to keep
control over the Aggies.
"The Davis game felt really
good â€” it was a big stepping stone
for us," said head coach Ben Quit
tner. "They are one of the better
teams in the country. Both the
team and I felt we played really
well defensively."
It was a freshman show, as
Lindsay Welsh and Heather Crary
turned it on offensively and defen
sively. Crary was virtually impene
trable in goal for the Cardinal, as
she recorded 21 saves for the game.
While Crary got it done on defense,
Welsh found the net twice for the

women early in the game. Olivia
White scored next for the Cardinal
followed by Rachel Best, who
scored the game-winner. This goal
put the Cardinal up 4-1 going into
the fourth quarter. Davis would
score twice more, but because of
tough defensive play by the Cardi
nal, it was too little too late.
"This game was a challenge.
This was the first time we've raised
our level and beat out such a good
team," Welsh said.
Along with the victory against
Davis, the Cardinal came out on
top in the first two games of the
tournament. The squad defeated
UC-San Diego for the second time
this year. On Saturday morning, in
a defensive battle that ended 4-2,
Julie Baker led the way scoring two
goals, with Lindsay Tarn and
Nicole Glazer contributing a goal
each. Crary played big again with
ten saves for the Cardinal, while al
lowing only two goals.
On Saturday, the Cardinal
played above and beyond its UC-
Santa Cruz opponent and offered
them a 14-7 drubbing. Eight differ
ent Cardinal players scored, with

Welsh leading the way with three
goals. Crary split the victory with
keeper Tamar Engel.
On Saturday evening, Stanford
fell from its winning ways as the
team failed to top No. 2 San Diego
State. The young Cardinal squad
was overpowered by a bigger, and
more experienced, Aztec squad.
"We played really well, we even
had more shots on goal than they
did, but they took advantage of our
mistakes," Quittner said.
The Cardinal fell behind in the
first half, scoring only one goal to
San Diego's five. The game evened
out in the second half, but by that
time San Diego was too far out of
reach. The Cardinal saw its inexpe
rience show in the 9-3 loss. It was
in this game that the women could
have used the experience of junior
Captain Alice Cathcart, who was
out with a back injury. Cathcart's
status is day to day, as she just
started swimming again yester
day.
"I think this weekend went
O.K. We are coming together as a
team and getting better all the
time," Welsh said.
