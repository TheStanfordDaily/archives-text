# Web site in the works for alumni
## 
### Ann Kim 
As part of its efforts to keep alumni in touch
with the University and with each other, the
Alumni Association is currently developing a
resource Web site — to be ready for general use
by the end of March.
Targeting recent alumni, the Stanford On-
Line Alumni Resource (SOLAR) System site
on the World Wide Web will feature bulletin
boards for alumni to communicate with each
other and keep informed of events on campus,
a database of alumni personal information, a
search mechanism for locating alumni and per
manent e-mail forwarding addresses for each
alumnus.
Alumni will be able to activate their records
on-line for free. All alumni have a permanent e
mail forwarding address and can enter their
current address and phone number on-line so
that it can be accessed by other alumni. Alum
ni can also include their major and the organi
zations or activities they were involved with in

a personal information section.
"We think this will make it really easy for
alumni to keep in touch with each other and
the University," said Alumni Relations Pro
gram Director Lany Green. "We really think
it's going to be a hit."
Green said he foresees the SOLAR System
as being a place alumni can turn to for things
like football scores or a discussion with other
alumni about the presidential election. He also
said he sees the possibility of bringing profes
sors, University administrators and even De
partment of Athletics staff on-line to chat with
alumni.
The Web site could be a valuable resource
for alumni moving to new cities or jobs, said
Bruce Weiner, president of Mediacraft Inc.,
the company that provided the software and
technical services for SOLAR System. With
the alumni database and the search form,
the names and phone numbers of all alumni
in a particular city or at a particular compa
ny can be accessed, providing a support net-

work for the alumnus conducting the search,
he said.
Weiner described the Web site as "very in
teractive," referring especially to the search
form. The form can also be used to locate alum
ni from a certain class by major or extracurric
ular activities — as long as the information is
included in the alumnus' personal information
profile, he said.
SOLAR System is about 75 percent com
plete, according to Green, and is currently in
beta testing, which involves gathering input
from alumni around the world and students
who volunteered to part icipate.
The alumni taking part in the testing "are
really fired up about the site," said Green.
"They're very enthusiastic."
"This is a very exit ing opportunity to extend
our reach," said Alumni Association President
Rill Stone. "The Web seems a natural way of
getting to a scattered group of people. This is
the most intriguing new way of reaching people
that's come along in a long time."
