# Greeks host Field Day for local kids
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
Fifty children got a taste of college
life this Saturday at the first annual
Boys' and Girls' Club Field Day.
The kids, who came from the
Menlo Park and Redwood City
Boys' and Girls' Clubs, cheered,
played pool and shot hoops, enjoying
a few hours of fun at the Delta
Kappa Epsilon House. By the after
noon, when it was time for the kids
to leave, many had found their own
"Greek buddy" whom they knew by
name.
The field day, sponsored by the
Interfraternity Council and the In
tersorority Council, is part of a new
effort by Stanford's Greek commu
nity to encourage underprivileged
children through positive contact
with college students.
Sophomore Omeed Rezaian, vice
president of the Dekes and IFC com
munity service chair, organized the
event earlier this quarter.
"Our goal here is two-fold," said
Rezaian. "First, we simply want to
help a bunch of kids have a good time
and hope they leave with fond mem
ories. Secondly, and more impor
tantly, we want to use this field day
as a stepping stone for increased fu
ture involvement with the Boys' and
Girls' Club."
The children, many of whom
don't receive breakfast at home,
were given a small meal when they
arrived at 10 a.m. After some free
time and games at the Deke House,
the children and the fraternity and
sorority members headed to Flo
rence Moore Field where they played
outdoor games. They then returned
to the Deke House for pizza and an
awards ceremony, during which
each child was recognized. Around 2
p.m. the children left for home, each
with a bag of goodies.

Mel Rivers, a program director at
the Redwood City Boys' and Girls'
Club, said he hopes Stanford stu
dents will play an important part in
the hopes of these children.
"Our purpose is to direct these
youth and put them on a positive
road to success," Rivers said. Rivers
said he hopes Stanford's "family-ori
ented, team-oriented concept" will
encourage the children to make "col
lege a stepping stone to their suc
cess."
"A lot of times people only associ
ate the Greek system with parties,
but this is a good way to show that we
are involved in community service,"
said junior Felicia Stanger, who is
president of Delta Delta Delta.
"Each chapter has a strong philan
thropy, but it's neat that we're com
ing together to do a joint community
service event like this."
Carlos Coria, social recreation di
rector of the Menlo Park Boys' and
Girls' Club, said he hopes the field
day and other events like it will en
courage the children to continue
their education.
"Hopefully they'll pursue college,
by actually seeing what college life is
like," Coria said.
"Bringing kids and college stu
dents together is like making two
ends meet," said sophomore Andy
Roberts, a resident of the Deke
House. "A lot of the interaction we
have is when we go tutor and stuff,
but this is just all fun.... There are
two kids out there who are better at
ping pong than most of the guys liv
ing here."
And considering their young age,
the children aren't all that different
from college students, according to
Roberts.
"It's funny, we turned on the
music and all the kids just gathered
around the pool table. Just like col
lege kids."
