# Election mixup jeopardizes fees
## 7 groups may not appear on ballot 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
The special
fee requests of
seven student
groups will not
appear on the
spring election
ballot because

the groups failed to submit declara
tions of intent, according to ASSU
Elections Commissioner Ryan
Medders.
Three other groups have been
given a temporary reprieve pending
further review, Medders added.
The groups whose requests will
not appear on the ballot are Tuition
Raffle, REDWOOD, Students for
Environmental Action at Stanford,
the Stanford Band, Stanford Cheer,
Stanford Film Society and the Stan
ford Homelessness Action Coali
tion.
The Elections Commission also
did not receive declarations of in
tent from three other groups —
Barrio Assistance, Stanford Con
cert Network and Club Sports —
but they have been granted tempo
rary reprieves because the groups
claim they turned in their declara
tions, Medders said.
The status of one other special
fee group, the Stanford American

Indian Organization, is still unde
cided, as Medders has not yet been
able to reach group officials.
According to Medders, "A decla
ration of intent is a statement certi
fying that a candidate, slate or spon
sor has fulfilled or intends to fulfill
all appropriate requirements for
placement on the ballot and that
they have read or will read the cam
paign practices code and agree to
abide by it and any rulings issued by
the Elections Commission."
"Three groups called and said
they turned in a declaration of in

tent," Medders said. "We figured
that there was probably cause for
us to go ahead and let them proceed
toward placement on the ballot. We
want to check everything one more
time to make sure. We are going to
be searching for [the declarations of
intent]. Concert Network and Club
Sports said they turned them in
rather early, which makes it more
possible."
Medders added that Barrio As
sistance representatives said they
turned their declaration in to the
ASSU Appropriations Committee.
Each of the three groups will be
required to sign a pledge saying its

declaration was submitted. The
pledge will be governed by the Fun
damental Standard, he said.
Medders also granted a reprieve
until today to ASSU Legal Counsel
ing because Medders initially
thought that the organization did
not have to submit, a declaration of
intent.
Special-fee groups gave varying
reasons for their failure to file dec
larations.
Stanford Concert Network di
rector Bryan Perez said he turned
in his declaration of intent.
"I turned it in six weeks ago
when the things came out," Perez
said. "It evidently got misplaced. It
seems unfathomable that there is
not a way to work around this. It
would be an awful shame if we
didn't figure this out."

SEAS did not turn in a declara
tion because the form was included
in a packet which SEAS officers did
not think they had to pick up, SEAS
chair Kelly Naylor said.
"We just submitted the docu
ments that were in the packet for
the '96-'97 special-fee request,"
Naylor said. "The declaration was
included in another packet that had
the petitions in it. Since we had
funding last year, we did not pick
the packet up. It was not clear that
we needed to."
Student groups must collect stu
dent signatures to get their special
fee requests placed on the ballot if
voters did not approve their re
quests in the previous year. SEAS
did receive approval from voters
last year.
Stanford Film Society director

Jonathan Levitt said his group ne
glected to read the packet complete
ly and therefore was not aware that
the form was required.
Perez said not having a special
fee would severely harm the Con
cert Network.
According to the ASSU Consti
tution, the senate and the Council
of Presidents can vote to place spe
cial fees on the ballot "in extenuat
ing circumstances," Medders said.
Deputy senate chair Bill Shen
has authored a bill to put Barrio As
sistance, SHAC, SEAS, Club
Sports, SAIO, Concert Network and
the Stanford Band on the ballot.
"The bill will order the Elections
Commission to place groups on the
ballot that deserve to be there," Shen
said. "These groups are being penal
ized for miscommunication prob

lems that originated out of the ASSU
and the Elections Commission. The
process this year was very confusing.
It wasn't clear in the packets that the
forms needed to be in."
Shen said Stanford Film Society,
Tuition Raffle, Stanford Cheer and
REDWOOD were not included be
cause they did not collect the mini
mum number of petition signa
tures.
"That is binding requirement, so
we were unable to find a way for
them to be put on ballot," Shen
added.
Additionally, COP member Jon
Oram is sponsoring a bill to put
Stanford Film Society on the ballot.
Without an affirmative senate
vote, there will be no way for the
groups to place their fee requests on
the ballot.
