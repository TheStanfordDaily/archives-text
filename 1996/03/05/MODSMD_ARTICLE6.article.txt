# SEAS leads protest against Taco Bell
## 
### Jenna Land 
Students for Environmental Ac
tion at Stanford collected about 800
signatures over the weekend oppos
ing the placement of a Taco Bell in
Tresidder Union.
The petition drive, which ends
Friday, was part of a student
protest of companies owned by Pep
siCo, including Taco Bell. PepsiCo
is one of a few companies that does
business in Mvanmar, the nation in

Southeast Asia formerly called
Burma.
Myanmar is currently ruled by a
military dictatorship, and activists
have asked that foreign companies
withdraw their interests there. Ac
cording to junior Jason Burnett,
who is active in SEAS, Amnesty In
ternational has chosen Myanmar as
its No. 1 concern.
PepsiCo continues to operate a
bottling plant in Myanmar and pays
the eovernment of Mvanmar 50

cents for every $1 they make, ac
cording to SEAS member Matt Mc-
Cambridge, a sophomore. In addi
tion, he said, PepsiCo buys agricul
tural products in Myanmar to sell
overseas.
A majority of agricultural prod
ucts in Myanmar are grown by the
use of slave labor, McCambridge
said. It is unclear whether or not
PepsiCo is involved in this, as they
refuse to identify where exactly
they buy their products, he said.

McCambridge said nine out of 10
students approached agreed to sign
the petition to keep Taco Bell from
opening in Tresidder.
"People are either familiar with
the issues in Burma and have been
willing to help out, or once they hear
they are willing to help," he said. "I'm
psyched about what it says about
Stanford students, when we have the
reputation of being apathetic."
Representatives from SEAS
plan to meet with Dean of Students
Marc Wais in the near future to
make him aware of the students'
response.
"I think it's phenomenal sup
port for something that definitely
has two sides," Burnett said. "It's
important for Dean Wais to realize
a majority of students are opposed
toTaco√üell."
Wais has said any vendor at
Stanford would have to provide a
low-cost menu and stay open late
in the evening According to Mc-
Cambridge, the goal of the upcom
ming meeting is to "get him to ac
knowledge another criteria exists."
At a meeting with students yes
terday, University President Ger
hard Casper responded to the con
troversy.
"The opposition to the Taco Bell
has just developed and we obvious
ly will have to look at it in response
to thoughts of the students," he
said.
Casper said the responsibility
for making such decisions lies with
the Board of Trustees. Although he
said the trustees will give thought
to issues of social responsibility,
Casper also emphasized their
obligation to be politically neutral.
Besides Taco Bell, Kentucky
Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut are
also direct subsidiaries of Pepsi Co.
Recently, Eddie Bauer and Levi
Strauss ended their involvement in
Myanmar. When Levi Strauss
pulled but of Myanmar, the compa
ny issued a statement saying that
"under current circumstances, it is
impossible to do business in Burma
without directly supporting mili
tary government and its pervasive
violations of human rights."
Although Burnett does not
think individual boycotts can have
much effect, he believes a larger
movement can be powerful.
"If the Stanford student body
says they don't want Taco Bell,
that makes a very powerful state
ment," he said. "I think it's an
issue we can win."
Alternatives to Taco Bell, Bur
nett said, would be to bring a real
Mexican restaurant to Tresidder
or to form a student-run restau
rant.
"Basically, I'd like to see Stan
ford supporting more local busi
nesses," he said.
