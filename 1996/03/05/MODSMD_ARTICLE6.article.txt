# SEAS leads protest against Taco Bell
## 
### Jenna Land 
Students for Environmental Ac
tion at Stanford collected about 800
signatures over the weekend oppos
ing the placement of a Taco Bell in
Tresidder Union.
The petition drive, which ends
Friday, was part of a student
protest of companies owned by Pep
siCo, including Taco Bell. PepsiCo
is one of a few companies that does
business in Mvanmar, the nation in

Southeast Asia formerly called
Burma.
Myanmar is currently ruled by a
military dictatorship, and activists
have asked that foreign companies
withdraw their interests there. Ac
cording to junior Jason Burnett,
who is active in SEAS, Amnesty In
ternational has chosen Myanmar as
its No. 1 concern.
PepsiCo continues to operate a
bottling plant in Myanmar and pays
the eovernment of Mvanmar 50

cents for every $1 they make, ac
cording to SEAS member Matt Mc-
Cambridge, a sophomore. In addi
tion, he said, PepsiCo buys agricul
tural products in Myanmar to sell
overseas.
A majority of agricultural prod
ucts in Myanmar are grown by the
use of slave labor, McCambridge
said. It is unclear whether or not
PepsiCo is involved in this, as they
refuse to identify where exactly
they buy their products, he said.

McCambridge said nine out of 10
students approached agreed to sign
the petition to keep Taco Bell from
opening in Tresidder.
"People are either familiar with
the issues in Burma and have been
willing to help out, or once they hear
they are willing to help," he said. "I'm
psyched about what it says about
Stanford students, when we have the
reputation of being apathetic."
