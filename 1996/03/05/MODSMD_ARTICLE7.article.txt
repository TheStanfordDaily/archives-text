# More requests for nude photos reported
## Riverside football player is alleged victim; grandmother says caller claimed Stanford ties 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
A high school student-athlete from River
side, Calif., said he received requests for nude
photos from an individual representing himself
as a Stanford football scout.
The alleged victim, a senior at Rubidoux
High School in Southern California, received
two phone calls on Jan. 24 or Jan. 25, according
to his grandmother. The caller, she said, identi

fied himself as a recruiter from Stanford's foot
ball team and said that by the following day he
needed photographs of different body parts to
show muscle structure.
The circumstances are similar to those in re
cent incidents in which nude photos were al
legedly solicited from a high-school football
player in Santa Clara. Police arrested Stanford
place-kicker Eric Abrams on Jan. 26 at the
Stanford Post Office in connection with those
alleged incidents, and charges relating to the

case are expected to be filed in two to four
weeks.
The victim'strand mother, who spoke to The
Daily on condition of anonymity, said she spoke
to the caller. She said that when her grandson
talked to the caller, he "looked funny in the face
— he got all red," and handed the phone to her.
The caller, the grandmother said, also gave
her two phone numbers — one at the Stanford
Department of Athletics and the other at an In-
dianapolis hotel.
The hotel is the same one where
athletes participating in NFL
workouts stayed. Abrams was a
participant in these workouts,
which began Feb. 8. Officials could
not be reached to determine which
Stanford athletes other than
Abrams participated in the event.
The grandmother said the
caller told her that her grandson
would receive a full five-year schol
arship, but the caller would need
pictures of his chest, legs, buttocks
and genitals.
The grandmother said the caller
told her, "You can tell growth po
tential bv looking at pictures —

that is why we need close-ups."
She said the caller told her to
"get as close as you can."
The grandmother said she
questioned the caller as to why he
was asking for nude photographs.
She said he responded that "he
was recruiting for Stanford and
was only doing his job, only doing
what other people told him to do."
The caller told her to mail the
photos to a Stanford football play
er at an address in the Athletics
Department.
The name and address the al
leged victim's grandmother gave
The Daily were the same as were
allegedly used in the Santa Clara
incident that involved a Wilcox
High School football player. That
name was previously published in
an Associated Press wire report.
The athlete and his grandmoth

er reported the calls to the athlet
ics department at Rubidoux, but
neither the school nor the family
reported anything to the police.
"At the time, I wasn't sure if it
was a prank," said Wayne
Cochrun, the football coach at Ru
bidoux. "I thought it was a little
strange, but I didn't know if it was
something they did in the pros."
Santa Clara Police Sgt. Mark
Kerby, who is involved in the
Santa Clara investigation, said if
other alleged victims turn up in
different parts of the nation, they
need to work through their local
police departments. Kerby origi
nally said he knew of two alleged
victims — the one in Santa Clara
and one on the East Coast.
"This is definitely an additional
victim — we had no prior knowl
edge of him," he said.

Unlike the victim in Santa Clara,
the Riverside high school student
had received letters from Stanford
earlier in the year expressing inter
est in him as a football player, the
grandmother said.
According to the grandmother,
the letters said her grandson "had
been recommended to Stanford as
an outstanding student-athlete
whom they would evaluate for the
future."
The letters were signed by foot
ball coaches David Tipton, Dana
Bible and Tyrone Willingham, the
grandmother said.
The alleged victim's grand
mother said she now plans to work
with the police.
"I amgoingtogo to the sheriff,"
she said. "I am going to bring a
case against this guy, and bring it
as far as I can."
