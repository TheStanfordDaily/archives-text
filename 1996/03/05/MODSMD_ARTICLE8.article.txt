## College student airs Stanford's soiled laundry 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Editorial staff 
If you think that vomiting
on yourself is disgusting, just
imagine how the people feel
who have to deal with your
clothes after you've taken
them in to be cleaned.
For Alexandra Lynch, the
only employee of the on-cam
pus branch of Baywash, the
laundry service located in
Tresidder Union, other peo
ple's vomit is the low point of
the job. "I put tags on stuff to
show where it's dirty," Lynch
said. "I don't have gloves or
anything. It's pretty nasty."
Most of the time, however,
her job is much more pleasant,
Lynch said. A 19-year-old part

It may be a dirty job but someone has to do it: Baywash owner Bernie Nelson searches through the
racks of clean laundry.
time student at Foothill College,
Lynch has worked at Baywash
since December. Lynch lives in
Los Altos Hills with her father.
She said she heard about the job
opening through one of the own
ers, John Cahoon, who is a friend
of her father's.
From 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on
weekdays, Lynch can be found lis
tening to the radio, accepting
dirty laundry and returning clean
laundry to Baywash customers.
Cleaning is not actually done in
the Stanford branch of Baywash.
"It gets sent out," said Lynch.
"Dry cleaning goes to downtown
Palo Alto and laundry goes to the
main office in Mountain View."
Baywash's name is linked in
no way to "Baywatch," the televi
sion show about lifeguards at a
Southern California beach,

Lynch said.
"I think Baywash is older than
the show," she said. "It's so em
barrassing."
At Baywash, where there are
no drownings or women in red
bathing suits, customers come by
at irregular intervals. "Some
times there's a period of half an
hour where there will be no one,
then 20 people will come at once,"
Lynch said. "There's an average
of about 24 orders a day."
Most customers are students
and professors, Lynch said.
"They're really cool. I think you
have a lot more down-to-earth, in
telligent people at Stanford,
rather than a bunch of young id
iots. All the customers are compe
tent. It's easy to work with these
people."
Among the customers who
came to Baywash during a late
morning in February was sopho
more Crosby Grant. Grant
brought in a bundle of Oxford
shirts, silk long underwear and

ketchup-stained corduroy pants.
Explaining the ketchup, Grant
said, "We deep-fried some tater
tots and spilled ketchup all over
the kitchen [of my frat]. I was
drunk."
The pants belonged not to him,
Grant said, but to a friend.
"I got ketchup on his shoes,
too," Grant mentioned cheerfully.
Grant said he usually does his
own laundry rather than bring
ing it to Bay wash.
Many Stanford students say
they do not use Baywash because
it is more expensive than other
comparable companies.
"That's just because it's on
Stanford, and everything at Stan
ford is a rip-off basically," Lynch
said. "I think when you come tc
Stanford, you have to expect it
Tourists come here all the time,
Everything is so nice and expen
sive."
Like Grant, most customers
are polite, Lynch said. "People
sometimes have complaints, and

I tell them to call the manager.
I've never had a customer who
I've wanted to go off on."
"I've met a lot of really nice
customers," she said. "I always
talk to this music professor. I just
talk to him about life and what
I'm doing that day, what I'm
studying."
One time, Lynch said, "I had a
really cool talk with this girl. I
forget her name. We talked about
what she wanted to do and I
wanted to do. When she left, she
said 'God bless you.' I'll remem
ber that for a long time."
Even when there are no cus
tomers, Lynch said she is not
bored. "I read a lot of books about
Western civilization: Kant,
Chaucer, Machiavelli. I'm read
ing 'The Celestine Prophecy'
right now. And I'm reading this
crazy book about Nostradamus."
Already, Lynch has learned
pragmatism. When asked what
the best part of her job is, she
replied quickly, "Gettingpaid."
