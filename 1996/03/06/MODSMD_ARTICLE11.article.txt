GM workers strike
DAYTON, Ohio (AP) — About 3,000 workers went on strike
yesterday at two brake factories that supply nearly all of Gen
eral Motors' 29 assembly plants, threatening to bring produc
tion to a halt at the No. 1 automaker.
Members of the United Auto Workers union cited job secu
rity and worker safety concerns in walking off the job at the
two Delphi Chassis System plants in Dayton. They produce
parts used on nearly all GM cars and trucks.
A three-day strike at the plants two years ago idled five GM
assembly plants in Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin.
Tom Klipstine, a GM spokesman in Warren, Mich., said the
strike would have no immediate effect on other GM opera
tions.
Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at UC-Berkeley, said GM
may have been able to stockpile brakes because it has known
for more than a week that a strike was possible.
"Hut my sense is that these are critical plants and GM will
be feeling the pinch very soon," he said. Normally, the
automaker keeps a low inventory of parts.
UAW Local 696 is unhappy with outsourcing — the produc
tion of parts by outside plants or companies — that could
result in lost jobs. Union leaders have said GM has issued out
sourcing notices that could affect 125 jobs.
"We're talking about jobs, good-paying jobs. Hopefully we
can keep them alive for our kids, who are going to need jobs
later on," said Steve Mowry, 45.
Talks are to resume today.
No reprieve for F. Lee Bailey
ATLANTA (AP) — A federal appeals court cleared the way yes
terday for F. Lee Bailey to be jailed as soon as a district judge gives
the go-ahead for failing to turn over millions in cash and stock
from a drug-dealer client.
The 11th U.S. Gircuit Court of Appeals lifted the temporary
order it had issued Thursday granting Bailey a reprieve on the eve
of his contempt sentence.
It sent the case back to District Court Judge Maurice Paul in
Ocala, Fla. Paul had ordered Bailey jailed, instructing him to
decide where and when Bailey will go to begin his sentence.
