# Dole wins primaries in eight states
## Senator seizes lead in GOP race; Alexander and Lugar prepare to quit 
### 
(AP) — Bob Dole swept eight primaries and
seized an overwhelming lead in the Republican
presidential race yesterday as GOP voters made
a concerted effort to stall Pat Buchanan's con
servative insurgency and turn the party's atten
tion to beating President Clinton in November.
So overwhelming were Dole's margins that
two lagging rivals — former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander and Indiana Sen. Dick Lugar
— were preparing to quit the race today, shrink
ing the field for the delegate-rich contests
ahead.
"I always felt in my heart it was going to hap
pen, but you never know until the people vote,"
Dole said, flush with confidence that his third
bid for the GOP nomination would be success
ful.
"Tonight we have proven the Republican
Party is not spinning apart but coming togeth
er," Dole told a victory rally in Washington, say
ing the mission for Republicans now was to

defeat Clinton and adding, "Tonight we found a
leader."
Dole predicted he would handily win New
York's primary tomorrow and carry momentum
into next week's "Super Tuesday" contests in
Texas, Florida and five other states.
"I think we are in a very strong position to
win the nomination," the Senate majority lead
er said, and for once there was no voice in dis
sent.
Dole won primaries in Georgia, Vermont,
Connecticut, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts,
Colorada and Rhode Island — a "Junior Tues
day" primary sweep. There also were caucuses
in Minnesota and Washington to begin choosing
their convention delegates.
All told, the day's booty represented more
than a quarter of the 996 delegates needed to
clinch nomination — with another 93 up for
grabs in New York and 362 next Tuesday.
Convinced Dole's lead was insurmountable,

Lugar and Alexander decided last night to quit
the race, according to campaign and other
Republican sources. Lugar planned a noon
announcement today in Washington; Alexander
was to head home to Tennessee from Florida
and make his announcement there.
Dole's victories were all the more striking by
their size. In Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut,
Vermont and Rhode Island, Dole won by 2-to-l
margins. In Massachusetts and Maine his lead
was over 20 points. Only Georgia was in the sin
gle digits.
Some GOP leaders said the nomination was
Dole's.
"If he doesn't have it wrapped up, he's close,"
said Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar. He urged others to
clear the field: "There's no need to keep fighting
among ourselves."
Buchanan vowed to fight all the way to the
Republican convention, but acknowledged, "It's
an uphill battle everywhere."
