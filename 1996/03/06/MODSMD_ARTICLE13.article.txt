KAMALLAI I, West Bank (AP) -
Trying to stanch the terror, Israel's
army blockaded more than a mil
lion Palestinians in their West
Bank communities yesterday and
sealed the houses of Islamic mili
tants suspected in four bombings
that have paraly/<xl peacemaking.
Stepping up their offensive
against the militants, soldiers raid
ed a West Bank village, herding all
the men into the main square for
questioning. Prime Minister Shi
mon Peres vowed to imprison rela
tives of the suicide bombers with
out trial.

Troops also raided and ordered
shut several academic and charity
groups in the Hebron and
Jerusalem areas which Israel con
sidered connected to the militant
groups, Israeli and Palestinian
sources said.
In an about-face, the military
wing of Hamas said it would heed a
call from the group's political lead
ers to halt the bombing attacks until
July. The wing, Izzedine al Qassam,
claimed responsibility for four
bombings in nine days that killed
four bombers and 57 other people.
Angry Israelis buried the 13 vic-

Tims of the latest attack, killed
Monday when an Islamic militant
blew himself up outside Tel Aviv's
main shopping mall. Half the dead
were children.
The bombings have forced
Israel's beleaguered government,
its popularity plunging ahead of
elections May 29, to abandon its
defensive policy toward such
attacks.
Thousands of troops set up road
blocks yesterday around 465 West
Bank communities — most of them
nominally autonomous under the
Israel-PLO agreements — confin

ing about 1.2 million Palestinian
residents to their home towns.
Israeli soldiers sealed the homes
of 10 suspected Hamas members.
Troops also soldered shut the metal
doors and windows of the houses of
three of the four suicide bombers.
In the West Bank village of
Burka, soldiers forced all men older
than 15 into the main square and
made them sit on the ground as the
army questioned them one by one.
Israel did not reenter the seven
West Bank towns now fully under
Palestine Liberation Organization
control.
