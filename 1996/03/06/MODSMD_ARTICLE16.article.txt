ASSU senators must
accept their duty to
represent students

IN WHAT SHOULDN'T be
much of a surprise to anyone,
the ASSU Senate last week rub
ber-stamped more than $1 million
in special fees with less debate than
it often takes that body to adjourn a
meeting. It seems that in the name
of "letting students decide," the sen
ate has chosen to ignore its own
rules — if it ever bothered to read
them in the first place. The prob
lems with the special fee process this
year are almost too numerous to
mention.
Beginning with the members of
the Appropriations Committee —
the group responsible for evaluating
the legitimacy of special-fee requests
— our elected representatives jetti
soned the lion's share of their repre
sentative mandate. Before being
placed on the ballot, all special fee
groups must be interviewed by this
committee. During these interviews,
the committee is supposed to go over
the budgets of all applicants and
make recommendations — not just
about the propriety of the dollar
amounts requested, but also if the
groups applying even merit receiving
this money from the student body.
A memo from the financial man
ager was distributed to the commit
tee reminding them of this represen
tative responsibility and the commit
tee did spend a great deal of tirpe
interviewing applicants. Nonethe
less, they chose to approve just about
every line item on every budget,
making small, cosmetic changes here
and there.
After interviews the Appropria
tions Committee is supposed to sub
mit its modified budgets and recom
mendations to the senate for
approval or further modification.
Oddly enough, the changes they sub
mitted to the senate this year includ
ed no footnotes or specific explana

tions for any modification or for any
fee. On top of this, they did not even
include descriptions of what each
fee-seeking group's purpose was
(and some were brand-new,
unknown student groups).
Building on this irresponsibility,
the senate as a whole did not bother
to take the steps to ensure that prop
er procedures were followed. In fact,
with the exception of one organiza
tion, it rubber-stamped all of the spe
cial-fee requests in one shot. Howev
er, the senate does indeed have a
responsibility to monitor the recom
mendations made by the Appropria
tions Committee. Thankfully, some
of our representatives are aware of
this. In a message posted to the sen
ate newsgroup, Council of Presi
dents member Jon Oram wondered
why no one questioned whether it
was appropriate to place all fees on
the ballot.
Furthermore, in the time between
the Appropriation Committee's
interviews and the senate meeting,
The Daily published an article
revealing past and possible future
funding violations. At its meeting,
the senate should have at least
addressed this issue, if not re-exam
ined the new budgets to consider if
groups were drawing funds from
multiple ASSU sources in violation
of the by-laws. But, the matter was
never raised.
Unfortunately, senators tend to
ignore their charge to govern or
enforce their own rules, citing a self
imposed duty to let students vote on
fees themselves. However, the sen
ate's charge is clear and it should fol
low it — or it should question the
necessity of its own existence. As
Oram later wrote in the same mes
sage, "Why we don't follow our own
By-Laws, well, maybe it's because
senators are negligent in their over
sight responsibilities!!! Why do you
think we require the Senate to look
over these allocations?"
The senate is at a philosophical
crossroads; to continue as a legiti
mate body, it must recognize its rep
resentative responsibilities and
make the tough choices it was elect
ed to make.
