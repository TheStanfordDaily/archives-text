## Opening the closet door 
### 
Most everyone reacted to
last week's news about the Stan
ford place-kicker's alleged solicita
tion of nude photos with disgust or disap
pointment; I reacted with sadness. Sadness
because what reportedly happened wasn't
so much a reflection of a talented individu
al gone awry as it was yet another indict
ment of the closetedness of our society, of
Stanford and of football. Even the report
ing of the stoiy, and our reactions, reflected
a fundamental inability to deal with homo
sexuality.
The bottom line, whether or not this
particular case is a twisted prank, is this:
Until we all are able to accept homosexu
ality, until we are able to ask, listen and
tell, until we'are able to accept that bisex
uality and homosexuality surround and
encompass all of us, we all will have to
deny a little bit of what makes all of us
human and many of us will be forced to
live lives of deceit. The results will con
tinue to be tragic.
While I don't know the facts of this par
ticular case, I am almost certain that what
happened, if it did happen, could have been
prevented with a little effort from all of us.
Consider a child who in high school realizes
both that he is gay and that he wants to
spend his life playing football. Think about
the paradox. There are no openly gay pro
fessional athletes in football or in any other
major sport. This hypothetical (and yet real
so many times over) child may never have

had any contacts with homosexuality —
with the exception of a few media-created
freaks. It shouldn't surprise you that gay
teens have nine times the suicide rate of
straight teens.
Then, assume that at age 18 this
immensely talented hypothetical student
enrolls at Stanford, another closeted envi
ronment, where he is expected to play the
role of Ail-American Student-Athlete and
where he once again must keep his sexuali
ty locked inside of himself. Two years later,
several other varsity athletes, including
football players, slam a bench into the "Gay
Liberation" statue — one of the only sym
bols on campus allowing one to believe that
homosexuality is acceptable. How do you
think this student would react? Does it pos
sibly make sense that he would act in self
destructive ways to somehow, secretively,
release his beaten-down emotions? Does it
possibly make sense that he would want
revenge upon what gave him so much and
yet took something more important away?
I do not want to make apologies for Eric
Abrams. Like an abused child accused of
stealing, Abrams is responsible for his own
actions — whatever they may or may not
have been — and must be held accountable.
However, we all (even the Department of
Athletics) have a much greater collective
responsibility to create an environment
where it is acceptable for everyone to
emerge from the closet at all times — not
just when they are out of sight. Granting

the right to exist only in one's own bedroom
is granting a right to a two-dimensional
existence.
Changing will be a challenge for every
one. Queer people hiding from society must
come out; straight people must offer sup
port and actively work to change the soci
etal thinking that has forced an invisible
existence onto others. We must all realize
that homosexuality doesn't just exist on the
fringes of society; it exists everywhere.
There are Olympic-caliber athletes, legions
of professors and even Republican con
gressmen who are gay. My father is gay and
the first time I told a friend about this, it
was as though I was coming out myself.
Now I've realized that the more I hide this
critical element of my life, the more I fuel
the oppression.
Changing the atmosphere that may
have caused the alleged tragedy of Eric
Abrams and that causes thousands of more
horrid tragedies every day will not be easy
or sudden. It will take each one of us look
ing inside of ourselves at our own complex
sexuality and looking around ourselves at
the way we deal with others' sexuality. It's
a step that we must take if we want to allow
everyone to exist as fully human.

Nick Thompson has no knowledge of Eric
Abrams' sexual orientation.
