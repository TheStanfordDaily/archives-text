Put student-run businesses, not Taco Bell, in Tresidder

I AGREE WITH Nick Thompson,
Kevin Madden and Stanford Environ
mental Action Coalition that Stanford
should not allow PepsiCo to operate a
Taco Bell on campus; Stanford should not
do business with corporations which do
business with SLORC, Burma's repres
sive military regime. However, why give
away the right to operate student eateries
to corporations at all?
An even better reason not to have Taco
Bell in Tresidder is that on practical and
ideological grounds, students would be
best served if the student union housed
student-run businesses.
Students obviously know what we
want better than PepsiCo does, or even, I
dare say, better than Bon Appetit does. A
student-run eatery that served simple,
good food and Juice Club-esque smooth
ies without all the Styrofoam containers
would be wildly popular and infinitely
better than a soulless fast food joint.

Plus, because the employees, managers,
customers and owners would be students,
the profits could be returned in the form
of lowered prices or turned over to the
student body. A profitable eatery could
completely pay for student groups and
activities, ending the slightly absurd sys
tem of fees and fee refunds.
This is not a Pollyanna-ish proposal; at
seven campus co-ops with "restaurant"
status, students currently order food,
plan menus, cook meals, clean kitchens
and houses, pass health inspections, and
pay room and board bills, all without Pep
siCo, Bon Appetit or even University
Food Service. During my four years at
Stanford, students have demonstrated
the interest and the capacity to run stu
dent eateries, only to have them shut
down for lack of proper permits. If any
one needs further convincing, the Terrace
Cafe at the Toyon eating clubs proved
t hat Stanford students, most of whom

scored fairly well on the SAT, can run
their own eateries better and cheaper
than the University or Bon Appetit. That
cafe was shut down this year because of
political pressure from Dining Services,
but imagine how successful a student-run
restaurant would be if located in our own
student union.
It's high time that the University and
its corporate business partners relin
quished their monopoly on student eating
options and allowed students to cater to
their own needs.
The best reason not to have Taco Bell,
however, is that most students actually
don't want Taco Bell. Shooting right from
the kishkes, I would venture that what
students want is an alternative to what
we've got, not the runs to the border.
The only voices I've heard supporting
the idea of bringing Taco Bell here are an
administrator, a couple unimaginative
student political hacks and The Stanford

Review of a few years ago. Somebody,
like, say, one of our "independent" Coun
cil of President farragoes, could be very
popular while looking both independent
and presidential by taking a stand against
University monopolies and corporate junk
food and for student control of student
hangouts and eating spaces.
So yes, Stanford should not house
Taco Bell because PepsiCo does business
with Burma and supports that country's
oppressive military regime. But an even
more basic reason in my mind is that stu
dent businesses in the student union
would best serve Stanford students.
Besides, in Berkeley, where the associated
students operate their own $10 million-a
year bookstore, Stanford's architecture
already suffers enough slander as The
World's Largest Taco Bell without adding
the sting of truth to the insult.
