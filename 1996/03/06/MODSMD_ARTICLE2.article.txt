# Blame it on the rain
## Wet winter to mean full Lake Lag 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The waters of Lake Lagunita will rise
again.
With another rainy winter, the Univer
sity has decided to fill the lake for the sec
ond year in a row.
The lake is already nearly full because
of significant amounts of rain that have
fallen during the past few months. Uni
versity Water and Infrastructure Manag
er Bob Hockey said 60 million to 80 mil
lion gallons are needed to fill the entire
manmade bed.
The University is hiring about 25 life
guards to begin staffing the lake on March
31, said Asst. Director of Student Activi
ties Heather Dunn.
The decision on whether to fill the lake
is made by the University's Lake Commis
sion, composed of students, staff, police
and representatives of the Utilities Divi
sion.
In past years, the commission has
sometimes made the decision with little

data about rainfall, resulting in high costs
to the University, Hockey said. This year,
commission members were provided with
data on rainfall during the past 10 years
and have set a standard for when the kike
should be filled.
They made "a decision to fill the lake
every year if we have significant rain
(more than 10 inches) by the end of Feb
ruary," Hockey said. By the time the com
mittee met this year, 14 inches of rain had
fallen.
There are three main reasons to fill the
lake, Hockey explained. Some amount of
water is required for the population of en
dangered California tiger salamanders
that live in the lake bed. During years
when rain is sufficient, the Department of
Athletics offers sailing and windsurfing
classes. In addition, Hockey said, the Uni
versity likes to have the lake full for Com
mencement in June.
The salamanders requ ire a dry lake bed
part of the year and a few feet of water
part of the year. "We normally achieve
that depth just with the rain water,"

Hockey said.
Rain isn't likely to fill the lake com
pletely, however.
From December through April, the
University can divert water from Felt
Lake, west of Interstate 280. "That is a
key factor in the reserve of water we have
for irrigation," Hockey said. By the end of
February this year, Felt Lake was full.
By allowing Felt Lake to overflow with
water from Los Trancos Creek, the Utili
ties Division can fill Lake Lag with the ex
cess water through natural gravitational
channeling.
In May, however, water must be found
elsewhere. Beginning in early March
through June, additional water can be
taken from pumps on the golf course and
from the confluence of Los Trancos and
San Francisquito Creeks.
Finally, if those three sources cannot
keep the lake full through June, the Uni
versity has the option of taking water
from wells. The aquifer the wells serve,
however, is part of the Santa Clara
Water District and using them is
expensive, Hockey said.
His division is looking into get
ting some reimbursement from
the water district to offset that
cost, he said. The lake leaks sever
al million gallons during the
course of the season, and that
water replenishes the aquifer.
Sealing the lake bed with clay is
a possible solution to the leakage
problem, but that would affect the
salamanders, Hockey said. As a re
sult, "the lake leaking is actually
doing the very honorable thing of
recharging the aquifer," he said.
