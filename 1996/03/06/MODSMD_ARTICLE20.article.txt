# Housing and dining official responds to student's concern
## 
### 
David Cohen's letter of Feb. 13
argued that students living on the Row
should not be charged higher room rates
than students living in dormitories. In
fact, students on the Row pay no more
for their housing than students any
where else in the undergraduate resi
dence system.

The University must spend money to
maintain kitchens and dining rooms for
students, whether in dormitories or row
houses. In dormitory residences served
by University Dining Services, that over
head cost is billed in the meal plan
charge, or board rate. In houses which
run their own kitchens, those overhead
costs are billed in the room rent (hous
ing) rate. These overhead costs are col
lected from all residents in some way;
it's just a matter of how they are billed.
The kitchen and dining room over
head costs on the Row can be broken out
and assessed as a separate charge from

the housing rent rate, and this change in
billing method is being considered at the
present time for clarification to stu
dents. In any case, dining / kitchen over
head in the Row housing rate has noth
ing to do with a board rate or meal plan
charge, and does not support University
Dining Services food or management
costs. The overhead costs are purely for
the physical kitchen facilities, capital
equipment, utilities, and maintenance
and renovation costs of this part of a
Row house.
To get an accurate measure of how
costs vary from one place to another, one

needs to compare the whole cost, includ
ing room, board, dues, etc. The only dif
ference in housing room rate should be
between houses that have University
custodial service and co-ops, where stu
dents do their own cleaning. I hope this
clarifies the issue, and as always, I
encourage anyone with questions about
the rates they pay to contact the Hous
ing Facilities and Services office at 5-
1600 or the Housing Assignments Office
at 5-2810 for answers.
