# Colleen Krueger: Left of center
## Sisterhood and self-doubt: celebrating successes

£ TV /rEGAN IS double-majoring in
l\/l biology and urban studies,
Y JLstudying the relationship
between community involvement in
inner-city neighborhoods and local dis
ease rates with her adviser and friend,
former University President Donald
Kennedy. She is a varsity women's ten
nis player, section leader in the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra, volunteer coordi
nator at the Children's Hospital and she
speaks three languages fluently."
For the last two years, I have attend
ed an annual ceremony honoring the
accomplishments of a small group of
exceptional Stanford women. One by
one — as their names are called — these
incomparable students modestly
advance to the front of the group to the
steady cadence of a litany of their
achievements.
"Worked for the French embassy in
Moscow." Step. "Ran the Boston
Marathon." Step. "Chappell-Lougee
Scholar." Step. "Published academic
papers in three different countries."
Step. "Pen-name Anonymous." Step.
I defy any woman to witness this
scene without feeling a profound sense
of sisterhood, of pride and satisfaction in
these humble but shining women and
the hope they represent for the future of
our world. I defy anyone not to sincerely

marvel at the stories of how their signif
icant obstacles ultimately melted into
victory and triumph.
I also defy anyone to leave the room
with their own sense of self-worth
intact.
For one night each year, I get the
schizophrenic experience of loving wom
ankind as an entity while simultaneous
ly despising myself. I celebrate the
accomplishments of my sisters in
earnest, even as I scan my mental
resume, scourging myself with a cat-o'-
nine-tails of my own failures. It is
impossible to turn off my need for exter
nal validation, my insecurities that I am
not "good enough," even long enough to
pass out the white flowers and share a
cup of tea.
Stanford is a culture of accomplish
ments. Each student and faculty mem
ber made it here because of their
achievements, not because they are a
very nice person or because they are
kind to animals. Unless they founded an
animal shelter or won the national
Humane Society essay competition in
high school; then maybe that could help.
We are allowed to come to Stanford as
the direct result of a sheet of paper list
ing our many accolades and endeavors.
Were it not for that sheet of paper, they
wouldn't want us.

Now that we are here, our job is to
accomplish more — to be more and do
more and create more entries on that
now legal-sized sheet of paper. And we
produce. Each of us here accomplish
many things each day, big things and
small things. We turn our papers in on
time. We direct plays. We get out of bed,
even when it is very hard. We write hon
ors theses. We plan student rallies. We
talk in section. We write little columns.
The irony of this culture of achieve
ment is that the vast majority of us
never really celebrate our accomplish
ments. No one sits back with satisfac
tion and says, "By God, you did this ter
rific thing, here, at Stanford. Nicely
done." We are constantly being remind
ed that the Rhodes Scholars, the med
school admittees, the first-round-job
getters are doing more.
Even University-sponsored celebra
tions of achievement often turn into
grueling sessions of self-flagellation.
How welcomed did anyone feel at the
Sophomore Welcome first thing autumn
quarter, when 50 Presidential Scholars
were appointed from a class of 1600 stu
dents — just to start the year off on the
right note. "You're already behind,"
jeered an internal voice of competition
and self-doubt, in case anyone had
developed any illusions of adequacy,

much less grandeur, over the summer.
One of my new favorite writers —
Anne Lamott — visited a writing class
here last week, bringing her funny, sar
donic brand of redemption to Stanford
like Lot in Sodom. It's not about being
published, she said. Don't look for
worth and meaning to come from out
side yourself, through awards and hon
ors. They are temporary hits; they fade
away, the fleeting feeling of satisfaction
replaced with an even deeper hunger
for more honors and awards. Nothing is
going to arrive "by phone or fax or
mail" that is going to give you any per
manent sense of self-worth, she repeat
ed three or four times. We all nodded.
We all wondered how she got her first
story published. No one was brave
enough to ask.
I think Anne Lamott is on to some
thing. We are never going to change
Stanford, to transform the culture of
achievement into something a little
more egalitarian and a lot healthier for
all of us. But we can try to take all the
time and energy we spend comparing
and agonizing and being good little sol
diers of our culture and our University,
and look inward instead. We can concen
trate on ourselves, on building some
internal sense of self that can neither be
artificially inflated nor decimated by

today's rankings in the Stanford award
system — because it's not going to come
from anywhere else.
Next year, if I make it back for this
annual event for women, I'm going to
read this passage from Lamott's book
Bird by Bird before I go: "Most of us are
raised to be somebodies and what a no
win game that is to buy into, because
while you may turn out to be much more
somebody than somebody else, a lot of
other people are going to be a lot more
somebody than you. And you are going
to drive yourself crazy."
I'm going to close my eyes, and try to
picture Annie herself introducing me to
this celebrated and accomplished group
of women, as I walk proudly to the front
of the room — peaceful and satisfied —
to the warm vibrations of her wcrds.
"Colleen is trying very hard to be a
happy, healthy person. Some days are
better than others, but mostly they are
leading to a good place. She has some
terrific people in her life, and they help
her in that struggle. She helps them too.
All in all, she's a lot stronger than she
would have guessed."
And somehow — in this vision — that
is enough.
