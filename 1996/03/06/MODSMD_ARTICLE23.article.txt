## Cardinal hoops has blown its own bubble 
### 
It's back. That's right, it's
officially "bubble week" for
many sports fans. No, I am
not talking about the annual
bubble gum blowing contest
held in Duluth, Minn., or the
week-long celebration of "bub
ble magic," the little pink bot
tle of suds that brought us all
hours of fun and enjoyment.
Nor am I talking about the
Bubble Hoy" from the infa
mous Seinfeld episode.

What I speak of is the week
ESPN refers to as Champi
onship Week — the seven (ac
tually 10 or so) days that are
filled with just about every con
ference's end-of-the-season
tournament. Whatever confer
ence you like, whether it is the
ACC,' the WAC, the WCC, the
Abuse Your Long Distance
( ailing Card Conference, the
MAC, the Mediocre 11, or Con
ference USA, you can't escape
(unless you live on campus and
lac k cable) the lead-in to March
Madness, what I call "bubble
week."
The term "bubble" refers to
any team that is unsure of its
spot in the NCAA tournament
going into Selection Sunday

(March 10), and when used in a
sentence properly, reads
"Stanford is now on the bubble,
seeing as the squad has lost
three out of its last four
games."
As any hoops fan should
know, 64 teams make it to the
"Big Dance" — 30 who gain au
tomatic bids with a conference
tournament win, and 34 who
receive at-large bids from the
tournament selection commit
tee. The group of 34 not only
consists of conference-tourna
ment losers, but also includes
those teams who are lucky,
enough to be in a conference
that has no postseason tourna
ment. And you guessed it,
Stanford is one of those teams.
Don't get me wrong— I
would love to fill this sports
page with my analysis of all
probable 64 tournament
teams. However, in the interest
of my readers and the other
sports writers who wrote arti
cles today, I'll stick with the
Pac-10 Conference and how its
teams should fare in the tour
nament selection process.
As basketball beat writer
Greg Collins pointed out last
week in his in-depth analysis of
the Pac-10 Conference's poten
tial tournament teams, the
conference deserves four tour
nament berths. I completely
agree with Greg; however,
given the fact that Greg and I
don't make the final decisions
when it comes to the at-large
