## Cardinal hoops has blown its own bubble 
### 
It's back. That's right, it's
officially "bubble week" for
many sports fans. No, I am
not talking about the annual
bubble gum blowing contest
held in Duluth, Minn., or the
week-long celebration of "bub
ble magic," the little pink bot
tle of suds that brought us all
hours of fun and enjoyment.
Nor am I talking about the
Bubble Hoy" from the infa
mous Seinfeld episode.

What I speak of is the week
ESPN refers to as Champi
onship Week — the seven (ac
tually 10 or so) days that are
filled with just about every con
ference's end-of-the-season
tournament. Whatever confer
ence you like, whether it is the
ACC,' the WAC, the WCC, the
Abuse Your Long Distance
( ailing Card Conference, the
MAC, the Mediocre 11, or Con
ference USA, you can't escape
(unless you live on campus and
lac k cable) the lead-in to March
Madness, what I call "bubble
week."
The term "bubble" refers to
any team that is unsure of its
spot in the NCAA tournament
going into Selection Sunday

(March 10), and when used in a
sentence properly, reads
"Stanford is now on the bubble,
seeing as the squad has lost
three out of its last four
games."
As any hoops fan should
know, 64 teams make it to the
"Big Dance" — 30 who gain au
tomatic bids with a conference
tournament win, and 34 who
receive at-large bids from the
tournament selection commit
tee. The group of 34 not only
consists of conference-tourna
ment losers, but also includes
those teams who are lucky,
enough to be in a conference
that has no postseason tourna
ment. And you guessed it,
Stanford is one of those teams.
Don't get me wrong— I
would love to fill this sports
page with my analysis of all
probable 64 tournament
teams. However, in the interest
of my readers and the other
sports writers who wrote arti
cles today, I'll stick with the
Pac-10 Conference and how its
teams should fare in the tour
nament selection process.
As basketball beat writer
Greg Collins pointed out last
week in his in-depth analysis of
the Pac-10 Conference's poten
tial tournament teams, the
conference deserves four tour
nament berths. I completely
agree with Greg; however,
given the fact that Greg and I
don't make the final decisions
when it comes to the at-large


Todd
Bernstein
bids, and that Stanford got
crushed by Cal last Sunday, the
Cardinal is now a bubble team.
Due to Stanford's loss, the po
sitions of the potential Pac-10
tournament teams has juggled a
bit. Not much has changed atop
the conference -• UCLA and Ari
zona are both locks. They are now
simply playing for a higher seed. I
don't think UCLA can be any
higher than a three seed and
wouldn't be at all surprised if the
Bruins get bumped to a four seed.
After all, non-conference wins
over Wisconsin and Maryland,
and losses to Santa Clara and
Vanderbilt hardly impress any
one, except maybe UCLA head
coach Jim Harrick, whom, as I
have pointed out in the past, is
generally a few beers short of a
six-pack.
Arizona stands the best chance
of improving its postseason posi
tion this weekend, but also stands
to lose the most ground with any
combination of losses. If Arizona
beats Stanford and Cal, and UCLA
stumbles, look for the Wildcats to
edge into a two seed. However, one
or two losses could send Arizona to
as low as a four seed. Either way,
the Wildcats should not go any
lower than a four seed, and, be
sides, they seem to lose in the first
round of the tourney fairly often

anyway.
And then there's Cal and Stan
ford. I hate Cal, so if it were up to
me, they wouldn't play in the tour
nament. However, because I am a
level-headed, conscientious sports
editor, I cannot ignore them. In
many peoples' minds, Cal official
ly left the bubble on Sunday with
the 16-point win over our beloved
Cardinal. I think Cal is safe for
now, and most likely will be a
seven seed if they lose to Arizona
and beat ASU. Two wins could get
them as high as a five seed; two
losses as low as a 10 seed. Either
way, Bozeman and his squad
should be dancing on Sunday.
Stanford, on the other hand
must at least beat ASU this week
end to be assured of a spot in the
tourney. Wins over Arizona and
ASU, coupled with any Cal loss,
could earn the Cardinal as high as
a six seed, but most likely a seven
spot. Most likely, though, with a
win over ASU, the Cardinal are
staring at an eight or nine seed
and a trip to somewhere other
than the West region.
The only other combination
that must be looked at is the hor
rifying possibility that Cal wins
both games this week and Arizona
loses both. Such a combination
would vault Cal to second place in
the conference and vault my
stomach to the edge of vomiting.
No matter what happens,
though, come Sunday, bubbles will
be popping across the nation and
March Madness will have begun.

Cardinal. I think Cal is safe for
now, and most likely will be a
seven seed if they lose to Arizona
and beat ASU. Two wins could get
them as high as a five seed; two
losses as low as a 10 seed. Either
way, Bozeman and his squad
should be dancing on Sunday.
Stanford, on the other hand
must at least beat ASU this week
end to be assured of a spot in the
tourney. Wins over Arizona and
ASU, coupled with any Cal loss,
could earn the Cardinal as high as
a six seed, but most likely a seven
spot. Most likely, though, with a
win over ASU, the Cardinal are
staring at an eight or nine seed
and a trip to somewhere other
than the West region.
The only other combination
that must be looked at is the hor
rifying possibility that Cal wins
both games this week and Arizona
loses both. Such a combination
would vault Cal to second place in
the conference and vault my
stomach to the edge of vomiting.
No matter what happens,
though, come Sunday, bubbles will
be popping across the nation and
March Madness will have begun.
