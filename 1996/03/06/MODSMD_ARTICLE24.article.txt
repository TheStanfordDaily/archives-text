INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. - Be
ginning today, several current
and former Stanford swimmers
will vie for the chance to make a
big splash this summer in At
lanta, as they compete in the U.S.
Swimming Olympic Team Trials

in Indianapolis.
Cardinal coaches
Skip Kenney and

Richard Quick,
named the United
States' men's and
women's head

coaches for the
1996 Games last
year, will finally
know the makeup
of their squads, as
the top two finish

ers in every event qual
ify for the Olympic team.

Former Stanford star Jenny
Thompson will have the first
shot at clinching a spot on the
team, as she competes in the
meets' first event, the 100-meter
freestyle. Thompson set a world
record in that race at the 1992
trials, and went on to capture two
golds and one silver medal in
Barcelona.
At this, her third Olympic tri
als, Thompson said she expects
her previous experience to keep
her nerves in check, allowing her
to concentrate on racing.
"I'm very excited," Thompson
said. "I have been for about a
month. I'm not quite as nervous
as I was in '88 or '92, I'm more
confident. I'll take every event
one at a time — I want to try to
make the team in all four of my

events."
Thompson, who led the Stan
ford women to four consecutive
NCAA titles between 1992 and
95, will swim the 50-, 100- and
200-meter freestyles and the 100-
meter butterfly.
Other former Cardinal ath
letes seeking to make their sec
ond Olympic team after compet
ing in Barcelona include back
strokers Jeff Rouse '93 (one gold,

one silver) and Lea
Loveless '94 (one
gold, one bronze),
freestyler Joe
Hudepohl (one

gold, one bronze)
and butterflyer
Summer Sanders
(two gold, one sil
ver, one bronze).

Sanders, the de
fending Olympic

champion in the 200-
meter butterfly, hung

up her suit and goggles after the
Barcelona games and hosted
MTV's game show Sand Blast.
She came out of retirement sever
al months ago to chase the goal of
representing her country again in
Olympic competition.
"It's hard to look back at what
you've done and not compare,"
Sanders said. "I'm looking at this
as a whole new Olympic Trials. I
want to enjoy it and have fun. I
feel that I am older now and I
know more about what's going
on."
Sanders has been training
with the U.S. Resident National
Team, a group of eight athletes
who live and work out in Col
orado Springs, Colo., sponsored

Jenny Thompson will look to break her own world record tonight, as she
