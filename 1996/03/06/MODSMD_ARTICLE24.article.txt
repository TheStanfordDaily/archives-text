INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. - Be
ginning today, several current
and former Stanford swimmers
will vie for the chance to make a
big splash this summer in At
lanta, as they compete in the U.S.
Swimming Olympic Team Trials

in Indianapolis.
Cardinal coaches
Skip Kenney and

Richard Quick,
named the United
States' men's and
women's head

coaches for the
1996 Games last
year, will finally
know the makeup
of their squads, as
the top two finish

ers in every event qual
ify for the Olympic team.

Former Stanford star Jenny
Thompson will have the first
shot at clinching a spot on the
team, as she competes in the
meets' first event, the 100-meter
freestyle. Thompson set a world
record in that race at the 1992
trials, and went on to capture two
golds and one silver medal in
Barcelona.
At this, her third Olympic tri
als, Thompson said she expects
her previous experience to keep
her nerves in check, allowing her
to concentrate on racing.
"I'm very excited," Thompson
said. "I have been for about a
month. I'm not quite as nervous
as I was in '88 or '92, I'm more
confident. I'll take every event
one at a time — I want to try to
make the team in all four of my

events."
Thompson, who led the Stan
ford women to four consecutive
NCAA titles between 1992 and
95, will swim the 50-, 100- and
200-meter freestyles and the 100-
meter butterfly.
Other former Cardinal ath
letes seeking to make their sec
ond Olympic team after compet
ing in Barcelona include back
strokers Jeff Rouse '93 (one gold,

one silver) and Lea
Loveless '94 (one
gold, one bronze),
freestyler Joe
Hudepohl (one

gold, one bronze)
and butterflyer
Summer Sanders
(two gold, one sil
ver, one bronze).

Sanders, the de
fending Olympic

champion in the 200-
meter butterfly, hung

up her suit and goggles after the
Barcelona games and hosted
MTV's game show Sand Blast.
She came out of retirement sever
al months ago to chase the goal of
representing her country again in
Olympic competition.
"It's hard to look back at what
you've done and not compare,"
Sanders said. "I'm looking at this
as a whole new Olympic Trials. I
want to enjoy it and have fun. I
feel that I am older now and I
know more about what's going
on."
Sanders has been training
with the U.S. Resident National
Team, a group of eight athletes
who live and work out in Col
orado Springs, Colo., sponsored

Jenny Thompson will look to break her own world record tonight, as she
tries to qualify for the Olympic swim team in the 100-meter freestyle.

by the United States Olympic
Committee.
"I think my chances were bet
ter in *92," Sanders said. "But I
think about myself and how badly
I want this. I just want to enjoy
the racing part."
Several other Stanford swim
mers are considered top con
tenders in their specialties
Kurt Grote ('95) and Tyler May
field ('94) in the breaststroke,
Dan Kanner ('95) in the freestyle,
Brian Retterer ('95) and Derek
Weatherford ('94) in the back
stroke, sophomore Sabir Muham
mad (100 back and 100 fly) and
senior Ray Carey (200 fly).
Kanner, who also participated
in the 1992 Olympic trials, has
been waiting for this event for
four years.
"I remember coming out of
high school and swimming at the
trials in 1992," he said. "I did re

ally well. I finshed ninth, and
they take six guys in the freestyle.
I remember thinking,' When I
swim in '96, I'll be the best.' My
dream is to be an Olympian."
For the past month, the swim
mers have been concentrating on
composing a mental picture of
how they want to swim their race
in preparation to transfer that
image from their mind to their ac
tual performance in the pool.
"The key is to get the race you
have in your head out in the
pool," said senior co-captain Ray
Carey, who also participated in
the '92 trials. "I feel like I have a
race plan that can put me on the
Olympic team."
With such an intense level of
excitement, the swimmers not
only have to prepare their race in
their heads, but also have to ex
pend a certain amount of energy
to keep themselves down to
earth.
"Right now I'm just focusing
on visualization and keeping my
self calm," Muhammad said.
One added comfort that will

provide a little aid to the Stanford
swimmers is the presence of so
many other members of their
team.
"Anytime you're at a meet
with a team atmosphere it's an
added benefit for a couple of rea
sons," Carey said. "For one thing,
you've got people cheering for
you, and you remember that your
performance is a result of many
people's effort, not just your own.
Also, it's a very emotional meet.
You're either going to be very
happy or very sad, and it's good to
have friends there."
In all, 17 current or former
Cardinal women and 18 men hope
to swim their way to Atlanta. In
1992, Stanford boasted seven
members of the Olympic squad,
who combined for 17 medals. If
Stanford University was a coun
try, its 19 total medals would have
placed it 13th in the world.
Tonight's races include the
women's 100 free, the men's 100
breaststroke, the women's 400
individual medley and the
women's 200 free.
