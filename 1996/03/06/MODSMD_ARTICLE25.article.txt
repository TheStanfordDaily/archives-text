## Cardinal pounds both Penn State and St. Mary's, 8-0 
### Sam Stapleton 
hume^c^HHl!!*ii TllamoncT for (heir first
home games since Feb. 10. Stanford (14-8),
which has struggled much of the season,
did its best to live up to its top-10 ranking,
in sweeping a doubleheader yesterday, de
feating the Penn State Nittany Lions and
the St. Mary's Gaels by identical scores of
8-0.
The first game of the day, a makeup of
Monday night's rainout, saw the Cardinal
mount impressive offensive numbers at
the expense of Penn State (2-4-1). Senior
catcher A.J. Hinch led the attack with
three hits, two RBIs and three runs scored
in four at-bats. Seniors Brian Dallimore
and ('ale Carter also contributed, each with
two hits and an RBI in the game.
Hinch, who has served as the team's
designated hitter for the past eight games
while battling a sore shoulder, hit a tower
ingtwo-run home run, his fifth oftheyear,
in the third inning off of losing pitcher Nate
Bump, who gave up nine hits and six runs
in five innings of work.

"I was encouraged by the way we swung
the bat today," said Cardinal head coach
Mark Marquess. "We struggled a little bit
at the beginning of the season, but we
sHo\ved today a little of what we can do. We
were fortunate to get both an outstanding
offensive showing and a great pitching per
formance."
Starting pitcher Chad Hutchinson
pitched five quality innings, giving up no
runs and no walks and recording three
strikeouts.
In the sixth inning, Hutchinson gave
way to sophomore Kyle Peterson, who
yielded only one hit over two innings, in his
first relief appearance of the year. Sopho
more lefl hander Josh Koonsand freshman
southpaw Brent Hoard also contributed an
inning each to preserve the shutout and to
give Hutchinson (1-1) the first win of his
collegiate career.
"I was relieved to finally get my first
win," Hutchinson said. "1 felt I pitched well
today, better than I have so far, but I'm still
not quite there yet. I'm going to use this
win as something to build upon. As the sea
son goes on, I will continue to improve."
Pitching was the story in the twilight

game, as well. Senior Mario Iglesias got the
start against St. Mary's (1-11). He scat
tered four hits over, four shutout innings,
before giving way to junior Brendan Sulli
van in the fifth. Sullivan dominated the
Gaels, recording three perfect innings in
the win, striking out five of the nine batters
he faced.
Junior J.D. Brammer, who pitched the
eighth and ninth, was equally impressive,
recording two strikeouts in two perfect in
nings of work.
Gaels starter Brian Hedley (1-4),
pitched six strong innings, but was tagged
with the loss. Hedley gave up six runs in
the first three innings, due in part to the
five errors the Gaels committed during
that span. Of the seven runs Hedley al
lowed, only one was earned.
Stanford second baseman Brain Dal
limore continued to hit well, with two more
hits in the second game, as well as two runs
scored. Junior shortstop Eric Sees also con
tributed to the Gardinal cause, adding two
hits and two RBIs, as well as a run scored.
The Cardinal hit well in the clutch, too.
highlighted by two-out triples by
sophomore Joe Kilburg and fresh
man Jody Gerut in the second in
ning.
"1 was impressed by our ability to
capitalize on scoring situations,"
Marquess said. "We had very few
wasted opportunties." Marquess
expressed approval over all aspects
of his team's play. "We drove the
ball well, we hit well in big situa
tions, we executed bunts, and we
played solid defense, not to mention
the amazing pitching performances
we had. These were big wins for
us."
With the two shutouts, the Car
dinal pitching staff has pitched 23
consecutive shutout innings, dating
back to the fifth inning of Sunday's
game against the Arizona State Sun
Devils in Tempe, Ariz.
The wins improve the Cardinal
to 14-8 overall, and 5-1 at home, and
provide momentum for the team
heading into the weekend, when
Stanford hosts the University of
Southern California Trojans at
Sunken Diamond, in a tough Pac-
Ten matchup. "We've played well
at home so far," Marquess said.
"After so much time on the road,
we're glad to be back here for a
while."
Stanford and USC will play Fri
day at 7 p.m., and Saturday and
Sunday at 1 p.m.
