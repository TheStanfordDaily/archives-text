### Sam Stapleton 
hume^c^HHl!!*ii TllamoncT for (heir first
home games since Feb. 10. Stanford (14-8),
which has struggled much of the season,
did its best to live up to its top-10 ranking,
in sweeping a doubleheader yesterday, de
feating the Penn State Nittany Lions and
the St. Mary's Gaels by identical scores of
8-0.
The first game of the day, a makeup of
Monday night's rainout, saw the Cardinal
mount impressive offensive numbers at
the expense of Penn State (2-4-1). Senior
catcher A.J. Hinch led the attack with
three hits, two RBIs and three runs scored
in four at-bats. Seniors Brian Dallimore
and ('ale Carter also contributed, each with
two hits and an RBI in the game.
Hinch, who has served as the team's
designated hitter for the past eight games
while battling a sore shoulder, hit a tower
ingtwo-run home run, his fifth oftheyear,
in the third inning off of losing pitcher Nate
Bump, who gave up nine hits and six runs
in five innings of work.

"I was encouraged by the way we swung
the bat today," said Cardinal head coach
Mark Marquess. "We struggled a little bit
at the beginning of the season, but we
sHo\ved today a little of what we can do. We
were fortunate to get both an outstanding
offensive showing and a great pitching per
formance."
Starting pitcher Chad Hutchinson
pitched five quality innings, giving up no
runs and no walks and recording three
strikeouts.
In the sixth inning, Hutchinson gave
way to sophomore Kyle Peterson, who
yielded only one hit over two innings, in his
first relief appearance of the year. Sopho
more lefl hander Josh Koonsand freshman
southpaw Brent Hoard also contributed an
inning each to preserve the shutout and to
give Hutchinson (1-1) the first win of his
collegiate career.
"I was relieved to finally get my first
win," Hutchinson said. "1 felt I pitched well
today, better than I have so far, but I'm still
not quite there yet. I'm going to use this
win as something to build upon. As the sea
son goes on, I will continue to improve."
Pitching was the story in the twilight

game, as well. Senior Mario Iglesias got the
start against St. Mary's (1-11). He scat
tered four hits over, four shutout innings,
before giving way to junior Brendan Sulli
van in the fifth. Sullivan dominated the
Gaels, recording three perfect innings in
the win, striking out five of the nine batters
he faced.
Junior J.D. Brammer, who pitched the
eighth and ninth, was equally impressive,
recording two strikeouts in two perfect in
nings of work.
Gaels starter Brian Hedley (1-4),
pitched six strong innings, but was tagged
with the loss. Hedley gave up six runs in
the first three innings, due in part to the
five errors the Gaels committed during
that span. Of the seven runs Hedley al
lowed, only one was earned.
Stanford second baseman Brain Dal
limore continued to hit well, with two more
hits in the second game, as well as two runs
scored. Junior shortstop Eric Sees also con
tributed to the Gardinal cause, adding two
hits and two RBIs, as well as a run scored.
The Cardinal hit well in the clutch, too.
