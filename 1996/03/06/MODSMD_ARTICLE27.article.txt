# Who'll stop the rain?
## Softball returns to field after 12 rainy days off 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
After 12 days of limited practice time
and no games, the Stanford Softball
team is set to resume play today with a
doubleheader against Santa Clara at
5:00 p.m. The matchup, which was orig
inally scheduled to take place last
Wednesday, is a rematch of two games
played in the San Jose State tourna
ment. Stanford took both of those
games (1-0 and 7-4) which means the
Broncos will be looking to exact revenge
upon the out-of-practice Cardinal team.
The rain has been a frequent problem
for the Cardinal all season. Wednesday's
postponement was the third game to be

'
affected by the rain. The season opener
against Southern California College and
a mid-February game against Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo were both canceled
with no plans for rescheduling, but head
coach Sandy Pearce is confident that her
team will come out ready to play despite
the lapse in games played.
"When {the players} take this much
time off, it makes them hungry to get
out there and play," Pearce said.
Whether or not the extended break
from action will have any affect on the
team remains to be seen. Stanford en
ters today's game looking to extend a
two-game win streak. The Cardinal (8-8
overall, 0-4 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference) defeated the 15th-ranked
Sacramento State Hornets (1-0
and 4-0) in a doubleheader on Feb.
23. Those victories ended a four
game skid by the Cardinal and
provided much needed confidence
both at the plate and in the field.
For the Broncos, who are 3-14
today's game is an opportunity to
end a nine-game losing streak.
Since defeating Saint Mary's
twice and San Jose State once in
the San Jose State tournament,
the Broncos have completely
plummeted. In their last nine
games they have been outscored
50-8 by their opponents. Santa
Clara's woes at the plate have
worsened as oflate. The Broncos
gave up 15, 10, 10, and nine hits

in their last four games, respec
tively, while only chalking up
three, three, six and none for
themselves.
Pearce is not too quick to dis
count her opponent in today's
games, however. "We beat them
twice," Pearce said. "But they're a
scrappy team, and they always
work really hard. We haven't
played in so long that it's scary
going into a game like this."
In Stanford's last two meetings
with the Broncos, junior Amanda
Renteria led all sluggers, going 5-
for-6 in the two games. In the first
game, Renteria was a perfect 3-
for-3 with a double and a run
scored, which proved to be the
only run Stanford would get in the
1-0 victory. In the second contest
Renteria hit a triple, scored anoth
er run and added an RBI as the
Cardinal took the game from the
Broncos 7-4.
At the plate, Stanford received

complete game performances
from freshmen Becky Blevins and
Marcy Crouch. Blevins threw a
four-hit shutout in the first game,
and Crouch followed the exhibi
tion by allowing six hits and four
unearned runs in her outing.
Crouch also contributed to the of
fensive attack, going 3-for-6 with
one run and one RBI in the two
games.
Blevins pitched an eight-inning
shutout victory against Sacra
mento State, but Crouch's last ap
pearance on the mound was well
over two weeks ago, in a Feb. 17
loss to the University of the Pacif
ic. Today's game will provide some
much anticipated playing time for
the Cardinal.
"We're just looking forward to
getting out there and playing,"
Pearce said. "It's a good game to
get us back into things and get us
ready for Oregon and Oregon
State [this weekend]."
