# Ultimate takes home the trophy at Stanford Invite
## 
### Jason Weintraub Staff writer 
In a display of athleticism, spirit and
sheer will, the Stanford men's and
women's ultimate teams walked away
from the muddied battle fields of the an
nual Stanford Invitational this past week
end basking in the glory of a Stanford
sweep.
The Stanford Invite, the premier tour
nament on the West Coast, featured the
play of top collegiate teams and, in an un
precedented tactical maneuver by Stan
ford, the long-awaited introduction of
"Hal." The men's team, affectionately
known as the Scrubs, unveiled their latest
creation this weekend: a powerbook known
as "Hal" that utilizes a program written by
team co-captain Randy "Nike" Hulett to
call substitutions between points.
"Choosing seven people out of 23 for
each point can be very difficult," according
to Hulett. "Fortunately, Hal takes criti
cism pretty well. He has a certain je ne sais
quoi about him, a charm which allows the
team to concentrate on the game and not
substitutions."
Leaving destruction and utter chaos in
their wake, the Stanford teams dominated
all facets of the tournament. Their confi
dent style, a juxtaposition of ferocity and
suave panache, culminated in each team
defeating its perennial rival, UC-Santa
Barbara.
The Scrubs, who tasted defeat in its two
prior meetings with the Santa Barbara
"Black Tide," joined their worthy female
counterparts (who crushed UCSB in the
final 19-1) in collectively tasting omnipo
tence, savoring its flavor while relishing in
the spoils of its conquest. By successfully
garnering victory where they had previ
ously found defeat, the Scrubs attained
new life. The Stanford victories signaled a
vertical ascension towards celestial

heights, the final goal being a national
championship.
In amassing a perfect 7-0 record for the
tournament, both teams took to the skies.
Bringing agility in concert with mental
prowess, Stanford ruled the skies by ele
vating their play to a virtual crescendo of
dramatic athleticism.
Stanford fan Chris Balonek observed,
"The sky was chaos â€” at every glance I
was attacked by a myriad of flying discs
and bodies. Stanford took to the air on
golden wings reminiscent of Charle
magne's edict, 'Let my army be the rocks
on the ground and the birds in the trees.' "
With such victories comes confidence,
particularly for the unchallenged women's
team which aptly refers to its vaunted at
tack as "Superfly." Allyson Chambers, a key
player in Superfly's arsenal, boldly claimed
that Stanford will march to a national title
without any worthy competition.
"I'm not so sure," Chambers replied
when asked if there was any team in the
nation that could come close to matching
Superfly's ability. "I mean, we won 19-1 in
the final. I heard UNC-Wilmington is
pretty good, but we should kill just about
everybody."
Even the usually gifted Banana Slugs of
UC-Santa Cruz posed no threat to Cham
bers and her fellow warriors.
"They're just awful," Chambers said.
"They lost almost everyone from last
year's team [which defeated our heroes in
last year's national finall."
Men's team co-captain Mike "Window"
Payne was equally philosophical about the
long awaited clash of the titans, Stanford
and Santa Barbara. "We have spent weeks
preparing for this battle, because we like
to feel solid about ourselves when we are
out there. I liken our actions this weekend
to Sherman's March to the Sea, leaving a
muddy path of glorious fire and primordial
Armageddon in our wake."
