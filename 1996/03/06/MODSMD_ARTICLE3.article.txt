### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Bending its own rules
last night, the ASSU
Senate voted to place on
the spring general elec
tion ballot seven special
fee groups which did not
comply with the ASSU

Elections Commission's registration re
quirements.
The senate passed two rulings after two
hours of vehement debate.
In a divided voice vote, senators first al
lowed four organizations which did not file
official declarations of intent by last Fri
day's deadline on the ballot because the
Election Commission's guidelines were
"confusing."
Representatives from the Stanford
Band, Stanford 1 lomelessness Action Coali
tion, Stanford Indian American Organiza
tion and Stanford Environmental Action
Coalition explained they did not under
stand the requirement to file a declaration
