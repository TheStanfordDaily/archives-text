# Senate puts 7 groups back on spring ballot

Bending its own rules
last night, the ASSU
Senate voted to place on
the spring general elec
tion ballot seven special
fee groups which did not
comply with the ASSU

Elections Commission's registration re
quirements.
The senate passed two rulings after two
hours of vehement debate.
In a divided voice vote, senators first al
lowed four organizations which did not file
official declarations of intent by last Fri
day's deadline on the ballot because the
Election Commission's guidelines were
"confusing."
Representatives from the Stanford
Band, Stanford 1 lomelessness Action Coali
tion, Stanford Indian American Organiza
tion and Stanford Environmental Action
Coalition explained they did not under
stand the requirement to file a declaration

of intent because they were on the
ballot last year.
Elections Commissioner Ryan
Medders said he did not understand
the confusion because the first page
of the application for special-fee re
quests explicitly states, "Before
anything else, a group wishing to re
quest a special fee must file a decla
ration of intent form with the Elec
tions Commission."
Debate over the second mea
sure, which placed three other
groups on the ballot in a 9-7-1 vote,
was more intense.
A bill originally proposed by
Council of Presidents member Jon
Oram to add the Stanford Film So
ciety to the ballot was amended by
Financial Manager John Hall to in
clude two more groups — RED
WOOD and Stanford Cheer — de
spite their failures to obtain the
number of student signatures re
quired of groups seeking ASSU
funds for the first time.
Hall argued that it would be in

consistent and unfair to grant late
placement on the ballot to some
groups and not others.
"If we can't follow our own
rules, how can we expect [these or
ganizations] to?" Hall asked. "We
should overlook our rules to give
them the benefit of the doubt and
let students decide" in the spring
election whether or not the groups
deserve funding.
Others arguing in favor of the
ballot additions noted that, if fund
ed, the organizations would pro
vide worthwhile services likely to
benefit students.
Undergraduate senator Christy
Ramon pointed out that the Stan
ford Film Society acquired more
than 1,300 signatures quickly
enough to demonstrate strong stu
dent interest in the organization —
reason enough to give them anoth
er chance.
Senators opposed to the second
bill urged that the ASSU's previ
ous action placing the Band,
SAIO, SHAC and SEAS on the bal
lot should not be used as a prece
dent.
"The fact that we've made a mis
take doesn't mean that we should

make another one. These organiza
tions missed a clearly publicized
deadline" and should not get spe
cial treatment, said graduate sena
tor Sandeep Singhal.
A frustrated Bill Shen, the sen
ate's deputy chair, said, "Tonight,
we've basically nullified our own
constitution. We have completely
invalidated our own rules. In
essence, we've pissed on ourselves
and the ASSU.... We didn't just
bend the rules. We broke them."
Calling the rulings "ironic,"
Medders said, "It was fully in the
senate's power to overrule my deci
sions, but it wasn't warranted....
The ASSU hired me to enforce its
rules, and that is what I was doing."
In addition, the senate voted to
include on the ballot Stanford
Jazz Orchestra — which was orig
inally denied placement due to a
clerical error.
Before the meeting, Medders
granted four groups inclusion on
the ballot whose declarations of
intent were allegedly filed but not
found — Barrio Assistance, Stan
ford Cardinal Broadcasting Net
work, Club Sports and the Stan
ford Concert Network.
