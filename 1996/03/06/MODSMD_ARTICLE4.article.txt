# 'Constitution '96' will be put to students for vote
## 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
In an impassioned debate at last night's
meeting, ASSU senators overwhelmingly
approved the placement of "Constitution
'96: A New Constitution for the ASSU" on
the spring general election ballot.
If approved by the students in this
spring's election, the legislation would re
place the current four-person Council of
Presidents with a single president, reduce
the size of the senate by 25 percent, give
all senators voting privileges and form a
judicial branch of the ASSU. To pass, the
bill must be approved by two-thirds of vot
ers.
The bill, which required a two-thirds
vote, was approved by the senate in a 14-1-
2 vote.
"We owe it to students to put this on
the ballot," said graduate senator
Donald Aingworth.
Undergraduate senator
Howard Loo, the only senator to
oppose the legislation, said he felt
that the bill would not make sub
stantive changes.
"I have major objections to
this bill. Changing the senate size
and the COP is not going to have
any effect on the senate. By na
ture, this branch is going to be po
litical." '
Others questioned some sena
tors' intent to pass the choice of
reform on to students.
"We are not purely a transpar
ent window which passes
through to students," said gradu
ate senator DougNatelson. "Sup
posedly, we are better informed.
Vote the way you feel."
In order to debate all the struc

tural changes proposed at last
night's meeting, the senators
voted to hold an open forum
where portions of "Constitution
*96" could be discussed alongside
four other bills which proposed
variations on structural reform.

'This bill has been
overly politicized.
It will not substan
tively change how
the ASSU does
business.'
— Rich Stolz

These bills, with some minor
changes, would have addressed
each aspect of "Constitution '96"
separately. However, these bills
were likely to be defeated, said
Deputy Senate Chair Bill Shen. The

meeting ran well past midnight.
Many senators said they felt
that placing all the reform bills
on the ballot would confuse stu
dents and create contradictions if
all the bills were passed.
"It will confuse the issue if we
put everything on the ballot,"
said undergraduate senator
Armen Panossian. "We should ei
ther segment the whole thing and
put it on, or not."
"This is not enormous reform,
nor is it enormous change," said
COP member Rich Stolz. "This
bill has been overly politicized. It
will not substantively change
how the ASSU does business."
The choice is now in the stu
dents' hands, Shen said.
"I expect there to be lots of se
rious and thoughtful discussion
by students and leaders," he
said. "The ramifications of this
are too huge to ignore. We have a
great deal of work to do on fully
educating the students on this
issue."
