In order to devote more time to
her position as executive director
at a privately-funded research
center, Stanford's Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole announced yes
terday she will take early retire
ment.

I am leaving so I
can put my energy
into the center. This
is a very exciting
opportunity in the
field.'
â€” Sally Cole

Cole heads the Center for Acad
emic Integrity, which convenes
conferences throughout the na
tion on academic honesty and dis
ciplinary polipy.
"I am leaving so I can put my
energy into the center," said Cole.
"This is a very exciting opportuni
ty in the field."
Cole is leavingjust as an ad hoc
committee, the Committee of 15,
has been charged to review the
University's judicial and legisla

tive procedures.
Cole has worked at Stanford for
more than 24 years, and began her
post as judicial affairs officer in
1982. She plans to leave the Uni
versity April 1.
She has also worked as director
of research in the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs, as the as
sistant to the provost in Academic
Planning and as the director of re
search for the Study of Education
at Stanford.
Cole assumed her position as
executive director at the center
part-time last May, but now wants
to spend more time on the job.
"The center now has over 100
colleges and universities that
work together to learn from each
other," Cole said. "We work to
raise the level of student hon
esty."
Dean of Students Marc Wais
could not reached for comment,
but according to Jim Larimore,
special assistant to the dean,
there has been no clarification
about what type of a search will
be conducted to fill her posi
tion.
Cole spent much of her tenure
reviewing free speech cases and
reinterpreting the Fundamental
Standard. That speech code, writ
ten by a Law School professor, was
struck down by a Santa Clara
County judge last spring.
