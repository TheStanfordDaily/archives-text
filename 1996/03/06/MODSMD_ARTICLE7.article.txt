# Sky falling on oversized U.S.
## Rightist writer O'Rourke decries 'politics of worry' 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The world is better than it has ever been, but people
aren't enjoying it, best-selling author and political
satirist P.J. O'Rourke said last night.
The problem, O'Rourke told a nearly full Memorial
Auditorium in an often uproarious speech, is what he
calls the "politics of worry," which leads to an ineffec
tive and oversized government run by whining bureau
crats.
"This is an optimistic moment in history, but no
body is willing to say that," said O'Rourke, known for
books including "Give War a Chance" and work in
Rolling Stone magazine. "In fact, things are swell at the
moment."
Because countries have freed themselves from
threats including everything from nuclear weapons to
colonialism, "We should be enjoying ourselves, and we
are not," O'Rourke said.
In the late 1800s, for example, he said, people suf
fered from such problems as low wages, no sewage and
poor hygiene.
"One thing everyone forgets about the old times is
how the old timers smelled," he joked.
"Even the bad things are better than they used to
be," he continued. "Bad music, for example, has gotten
much shorter."

Political satirist P.J. O'Rourke last night told a rollicking Memorial Auditorium
crowd not to worry so much.
But despite the vast improve
ments in human welfare, no one is
satisfied, O'Rourke said.
"I hear people whining," he said.
"There's a hole in my ozone. ...
There's terrible poverty every
where because rich people used up
all the money in the '80s."
The constant drone of whining
continues because it is effective,
O'Rourke noted.
"We whine because it works," he
said, adding that the whining works
best of all for politicians.
He cited Chicken Little — the
folk tale character who worried in
cessantly that the sky would fall on
his head — as the model for modern
politicians.
"Do you every wonder if Chicken

Little had an agenda?" O'Rourke
asked.
Furthermore, politicians try to
convince the public that because
they care about issues more than
anyone else, they are better people,
he said.
When Chicken Littles are elect
ed, he said, the government creates
a mess.
Citing the example of failed sav
ings and loans institutions,
O'Rourke explained that the gov
ernment of worriers removed regu
lations of how the institutions
spent money but guaranteed prac
tically free insurance for the banks.
This resulted in unwise invest
ments, ultimately leading to a crash
which cost the government $500
billion — enough, he noted, for a
New York City cab ride to the plan
et Uranus and back, "10 times plus
tip."
In dealing with the savings and

loan issue, politicians lost sight of a
"simple rule of governance,"
O'Rourke said. "When buying and
selling are controlled by legislation,
the first things that get bought and
sold are legislators."
Government is too big and too
bureaucratic, he said, leading to ab
surd situations such as the hiring of
one Department of Agriculture em
ployee for every three full-time
farmers in the United States.
Credit for the positive state of
America today doesn't lie with
politicians, O'Rourke said.
"The world is a much better
place, but not because of bitching
and moaning and not because the
bitchers and moaners got elected,"
he said. "The government is not
making the world a better place.
People are."
O'Rourke's speech was spon
sored by the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau and Stanford-in-Government.
