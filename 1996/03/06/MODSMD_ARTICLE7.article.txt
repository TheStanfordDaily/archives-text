# Sky falling on oversized U.S.
## Rightist writer O'Rourke decries 'politics of worry' 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The world is better than it has ever been, but people
aren't enjoying it, best-selling author and political
satirist P.J. O'Rourke said last night.
The problem, O'Rourke told a nearly full Memorial
Auditorium in an often uproarious speech, is what he
calls the "politics of worry," which leads to an ineffec
tive and oversized government run by whining bureau
crats.
"This is an optimistic moment in history, but no
body is willing to say that," said O'Rourke, known for
books including "Give War a Chance" and work in
Rolling Stone magazine. "In fact, things are swell at the
moment."
Because countries have freed themselves from
threats including everything from nuclear weapons to
colonialism, "We should be enjoying ourselves, and we
are not," O'Rourke said.
In the late 1800s, for example, he said, people suf
fered from such problems as low wages, no sewage and
poor hygiene.
"One thing everyone forgets about the old times is
how the old timers smelled," he joked.
"Even the bad things are better than they used to
be," he continued. "Bad music, for example, has gotten
much shorter."
