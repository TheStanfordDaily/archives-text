# Tenure vote likely today

The Faculty Senate will vote
today on a plan to place a 10-year
cap on tenure review, as well as on
revised guidelines for the General
Education Requirements that will
replace the current distribution
requirement system beginning

seven-year "probationary period," unless they car
claim exception for any number of reasons from ma
ternity leave to time spent in an administrative ap
pointment.
Among the concerns raised in the previous debate
on the plan were concerns about how to adjust for
faculty members who may request extensions for
medical disabilities. Senior Assoc. Provost Kathy
Gillam, a member of the professoriate committee,
said that "we do not need to be explicit in the policy"
about how to handle such cases and that under the
policy the University would be able to accommodate
such requests.
There is currently no limit on the number of ex
tensions a faculty member can take, although there
is a 10-year cap for part-time appointments, said
professoriate committee chair Walter Falcon, direc
tor of the Institute for International Studies.
In addition, senate members will vote on recom
