# Tenure vote likely today
## 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate will vote
today on a plan to place a 10-year
cap on tenure review, as well as on
revised guidelines for the General
Education Requirements that will
replace the current distribution
requirement system beginning
this fall.
The senate will also review the
charge to the Planning and Policy

Board — a committee defined by the senate's Com
mittee on Committees as "a keeper of the faculty's
vision and mission for the University" — to possibly
allow students on the board.
The senate will discuss for a second time the rec
ommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on the
Professoriate and is scheduled to vote on the com
mittee's call for a 10-year cap on the number ol
years a faculty member can hold a University ap
pointment without being reviewed for tenure. Cur
rently, faculty members come up for review after a
seven-year "probationary period," unless they car
claim exception for any number of reasons from ma
ternity leave to time spent in an administrative ap
pointment.
Among the concerns raised in the previous debate
on the plan were concerns about how to adjust for
faculty members who may request extensions for
medical disabilities. Senior Assoc. Provost Kathy
Gillam, a member of the professoriate committee,
said that "we do not need to be explicit in the policy"
about how to handle such cases and that under the
policy the University would be able to accommodate
such requests.
There is currently no limit on the number of ex
tensions a faculty member can take, although there
is a 10-year cap for part-time appointments, said
professoriate committee chair Walter Falcon, direc
tor of the Institute for International Studies.
In addition, senate members will vote on recom
mendations involving tenure clock extensions for

reasons of childbirth. The com
mittee's original proposal allowed
for a one-year extension per child,
with the number of extensions
not exceeding the 10-year limit.
At its last meeting, the senate
voted to abolish a previous "two
child limit" on the number of
tenure clock extensions faculty
members could take.
Falcon said his panel will pre
sent an alternative plan today.
The plan, which aims to recognize
the role of fathers in the child
bearing process, would grant
mothers a nine-month extension
for each child born, in addition to
a three-month extension for child
care. The three-month extension
would be applicable for children
either born to or adopted by the
parents. The second version is
also subject to the 10-year cap.
"The committee's view is that
[the second version] is a well
thought-out alternative to the
recommendation, but we prefer
the first one," Falcon said.
"Our phones have rung fairly
frequently on this particular
point," he added.
The senate will also consider a
recommendation by the Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement to revise one of the
recommendations made by the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education, which the senate
passed last June.
The commission's recommen
dation limited the number of
units an undergraduate can take
on a pass/ no credit basis to 36 (27
for transfer students) and speci
fied that the limit would apply to
students "graduating autumn
quarter 1996 or later." The com
mittee proposes changing this

recommendation to apply to stu
dents "entering autumn quarter
1996 or later."
Physics Prof. Mason Yearian,
chair of the committee, called the
recommendation "an oversight
that somehow slipped through,"
since the other recommendations
that were made to revise the grad
uation requirements all applied to
students entering in the fall of
1996 or later.
There is currently no Universi
ty-wide policy that limits the
number of units undergraduate
students can take pass / no credit.
Also in the realm of the new
graduation requirements, the
senate will hear a proposal from
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies that would revise the rec
ommended requirement for the
natural sciences, applied science
and technology and mathematics
area, one of the four broad areas
that will replace the current nine
beginning this fall.
The original recommendation
stated that students could fulfill
this area's requirement either by
completing a three-course science
core series or by completing three
separate courses in the area, one
of which had to be in the biological
or physical sciences.
The committee now wants to
amend the proposal so that if stu
dents elect the second option, they
may take no more than two cours
es in the same sub-area.
Also on the senate's agenda is a
review of the charge to the Plan
ning and Policy Board. Falcon,
who also chairs the Committee on
Committees, said the. senate will
deal with things such as whether
the chair is to be elected or ap
pointed, whether there will be
student membership and whether
the board will retain its three
year "sunset clause."
The purpose is to "reconsti
tute" the board, Falcon said.
