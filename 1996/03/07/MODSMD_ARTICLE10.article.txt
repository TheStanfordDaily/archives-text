# Aussie beetles on a rampage

A vicious breed of Australian beetles have been rav
aging campus eucalyptus trees, as well as eucalyptus
trees at other locations in the Bay Area.
Tending to the problem at Stanford has cost the Uni
versity more than $100,000 already, said University
Manager of Facilities and Operations Herbert Fong.
Campus scenery such as the Eucalyptus Grove across
from the Stanford Stadium has been affected by the bee
tles, which are the Australian Long-Horned Borer species.
Facilities workers have removed about 250 trees in
the last four years due to the destruction that this in
sect, which only eats eucalyptus trees, has caused, Fong
said. The beetle found its way to Northern California in
1989 and since then has chewed through eucalyptus
trees in Oakland, Fremont and Martinez in addition to

portions of Southern California.
The destroyed trees could pose a serious problem be
cause they create a fire hazard and the procedure for
their disposal is expensive. One method used to battle
the beetles is to import a parasitic wasp that preys on
the beetles' larvae. The wasps were shown to have an
impact on the number of beetles in Australia and
Southern California, Fongsaid.
Stanford took combative measures against the bee
tle last spring and summer, using the predatory wasps
to control the beetle population. The parasitic wasps
can cost up to $3 each.
"We're working with the University of California at
Riverside to introduce predatory insects that will selec
tively prey on the larvae and / or eggs of this insect,"
Fong said. "We're hoping they will be able to establish
themselves, but we haven't had experience enough in
the northern climate to know how successful it will be."
