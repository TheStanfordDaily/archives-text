Transient allegedly assaults officer
A female police officer was allegedly assaulted
with a homemade knife by a male transient in the
cafeteria of the Center for Integrated Systems on
Feb. 27.
In response to a report by a community service of
ficer about a suspicious individual causing a distur
bance, Officer Sharron Donaldson approached the
individual and asked him to step outside, said Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
The transient refused Donaldson's request and
began insulting her, according to Niemeyer. Donald
son then noticed a metal object between his legs be
neath the table, he said.
She asked the transient what he was hiding and
he rose quickly, "took two aggressive steps toward
her and raised a 10-inch blade as if to strike her
head," said Niemeyer. The blade was the type used
for sawing dry wood and had a handle fashioned with
electrical tape, he added.
Officer Arthur Tiedemann, who was also present
at the incident, then drew his gun and commanded
the transient to drop his weapon. After dropping the
knife, the man was arrested. Police charged him with
assault with deadly weapon on a police officer, bring
ing a weapon on campus and carrying a dangerous
weapon, Niemeyer said. He remains in custody.
Volkswagens suffer break-ins
Thieves broke into three Volkswagen vehicles on
Feb. 28, and Stanford Police say the incidents appear
to be related.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said the
break-ins, which involved two car stereo thefts and one

attempted robbery, occurred during the daytime at
various locations on campus — the Oval, Roth Way and
a parking structure by Stanford Hospital Two of the
cars were Jettas and the other was a GTI, he added.
Niemeyer likened the burglar, who has not yet
been caught, to another whom Stanford Police ap
prehends! last month in the act of stealing a car
stereo from a Volkswagen. However, that particular
burglar has not yet been released from custody, he
said.
"They [the three break-ins] seem like they could
be related, by the method of entry," he said. All three
vehicles were apparently entered by holes punched
through the doors.
Explaining why Volkswagens were targeted,
Niemeyer said, "The VWs generally have good stere
os and they are easy to get out of the dash. In the case
we observed it only took about two minutes (to ac
quire the stereo)."
Anti-theft devices are available from Volkswagen
dealers to put plates behind the door and reinforce
the sheet metal, Niemeyer said.
Turf torn up
On Feb. 28, Stanford Police observed three juve
niles in three separate four-wheel drive vehicles tear
up the turf by Frost Amphitheater.
They were "spinning donuts in the soft turf,"
which caused extensive damage to the lawn, said
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer. The amount
of damage to University property caused by the
joyriding has yet to be determined.
The juveniles were arrested and released to
parental custody.
