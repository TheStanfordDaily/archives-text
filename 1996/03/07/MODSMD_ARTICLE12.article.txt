Tension mounts in Israel
AL FAWAIt, West Bank (AP) —
Israeli soldiers forced Palestinians
caught breaking curfew yesterday to sit
for hours on a curb inside a barbed-wire
barrier. "Head down, hands behind your
back!" one soldier bellowed.
In the A 1 Fawar refugee camp down
the road, Palestinians calmly tried to jus
tify suicide bombings by two men from
their neighborhood who killed 23 Israelis,
two Americans and a Palestinian last
week.
"Theirs was a normal response" to
Israeli occupation, said math teacher
Ivyad Qawasmi, 23, peering from his bal
cony as soldiers patrolled below to
enforce a three-day-old curfew.
With hostility running high on both
sides, the mood on the street was as if
Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin had
never shaken hands at the White House.
Hunting for Muslim militants who
plotted four suicide bombings over a
nine-day period, Israeli soldiers deployed
in most of the West Bank yesterday,

including areas that already were cere
moniously handed over to Palestinian
police last fall.
Troops demonstrated who is in
charge, laying siege to the West Bank's
465 towns and villages and confining
Palestinians to their communities.
Chicago gangsters convicted
CHICAGO (AP) — Eight members
and associates of a gang that used a cor
porate approach and strict street disci
pline to build a multimillion-dollar drug
business were convicted of drug conspira
cy yesterday.
The case was the first test of the fed
eral government's six-year "Operation
Headache," which used wiretaps, inform
ers, and even a tiny recording device
tucked into a prison visitor's badge to
infiltrate the Gangster Disciples, Chica
go's largest street gang with a murderous
history dating to the 19705.
"We view this is as a great first step,"
U.S. Attorney Jim Burns said after the
verdict was read. "But I can assure you
that the battle has just begun."
