# Dole pushes to unite Republicans
## Buchanan, Forbes still going strong; will fight to the end 
### 
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Bob Dole
watched two GOP rivals fall by the way
side yesterday but two more made it
clear they weren't ready to fall in line
with the Kansas senator's self-pro
claimed "mission to unify the Republican
Party."
The withdrawal of Lamar Alexander
and Dick Lugar from the race prompted
House Speaker Newt Gingrich to pro
nounce that "Dole is nominated."
But Pat Buchanan said he was in the
race to stay, even if Dole's nomination
now "appears inevitable." And publisher
Steve Forbes vowed to press on as well,
picking up the endorsement of former
Housing Secretary Jack Kemp.
Dole, rolling off an eight-state sweep
of primaries, obtained the endorsement
of one George Bush and got some kind
words from another.
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, son of the
former president, put his support behind
the Senate majority leader at a news con
ference on the lawn of the state capitol.
"Senator, you are made of steel and
America needs your strength," Bush

told Dole. Bush earlier had endorsed
Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, who dropped
out of the race last month.
From Austin, Dole flew to Houston
for an audience with the former presi
dent — who defeated him in the 1988
GOP primary. Bush said he wasn't
endorsing his onetime rival, but he said
it with a wink.
"I'm going to speak enthusiastically
for him," Bush said.
The former president even made a
point of letting Dole sit in a chair he
brought with him when he left the
White House.
Dole said it felt "all right. I could get
used to it."
Of Buchanan's indication that he
would take his battle all the way to the
GOP convention in San Diego in August,
Dole said:
"He didn't indicate he would support
me but I hope he will."
Dole also shrugged off Kemp's deci
sion to help Forbes, noting that Forbes
and the former New York congressman
were good friends.

"It won't change my campaign, it
might change Jack's," Dole said without
elaboration.
Looking ahead to today's primary in
New York, Dole predicted victory and
said, "there are three of us in the race. I
hope they do poorly."
With 123 delegates at stake, Texas is
the biggest prize in next week's mostly
southern "Super Tuesday" races, fol
lowed by Florida — where Dole was
headed later yesterday. Jeb Bush, anoth
er Bush son and Florida GOP guberna
torial candidate in 1994, also endorsed
Dole yesterday.
At the news conference at the state
capitol, Dole said he hoped Buchanan
would wind up supporting him. Asked
about Buchanan's talk of going to the
convention anyway, Dole cracked, "If
you don't have any delegates when you
get to San Diego why make the trip?"
Still buoyed by Tuesday's victories,
Dole said, "My mission and our mission
is to unify the Republican Party and
close ranks." He said it was time to con
front "the real target — Bill Clinton."
