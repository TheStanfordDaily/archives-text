The University should
install peepholes in dorm
doors for student safety

Many students living
in dorms — usually in a
friendly, open atmosphere
— do not think about safety in
their residences until shocking or
annoying events occur, such as
thefts, harassing strangers ran
domly knocking on doors or
drunk, violent students showing
up in the middle of the night. Only
when students hear about such
events or read about them in the
newspaper do they become more
aware of their safety and try to
become more cautious.
After a few weeks, however, stu
dents realize that being so cau
tious in the friendly dorm environ
ment is futile and perhaps unnec
essary. They are lulled back into a
false sense of security, inviting
another shocking or annoying
event to occur.
Unfortunately, the dorm envi
ronment at Stanford does not
allow students to be cautious
because dorms are kept open and
accessible to outsiders. Although
residence openness promotes a
friendly, community spirit, it
neglects the importance of student
safety. The University should
make it possible for students to be
cautious and feel safe in their resi
dences by placing peepholes in all
dorm doors so students can see
who is knocking.
First and foremost, peepholes
address the issue of residence safe
ty. Although dangerous incidents
do not occur often, a great poten
tial for danger exists. Any person
can enter a dorm at almost any
time of the day or night. Until
midnight, exit doors to the dorms
remain open, and any stranger can
waltz in and out freely. After mid
night, people wanting entrance
into any dorm simply need to

knock on the exit doors or on stu
dents' windows, and they will
most likely be let in with no ques
tions asked.
Last quarter, strangers entered
Xanadu after midnight, knocked
on students' doors, harassed stu
dents and stole students' posses
sions. This incident exemplifies
the fact that strangers can and do
easily enter dorms and wreak
havoc. Tightening security on exit
doors may be a solution — and
providing phones outside resi
dences has helped secure exterior
doors — but until the University
can create a consistent security
system for dorm exits, it can easily
and economically provide interior
security by installing peepholes.
In addition, peepholes address
intangible — but important —
issues surrounding student safety.
Many dorm-based students have a
sense of invulnerability, not believ
ing dangerous events can occur on
campus. Peepholes serve as
reminders that safety is always an
issue and that students should
practice caution when opening
their doors.
Peepholes also allow for more
individual control. Currently,
when students hear a knock at
their doors, they are forced to
interact with the person at the
door — they must either ask who
it is or open the door immediately.
Usually, students open their doors
to their friends' smiling faces. At
times, however, they open them to
complete strangers, drunk stu
dents or harassing acquaintances.
Students must then not only deal
with the annoyance of making the
person leave, but also face a poten
tially dangerous situation. Peep
holes in dorm doors would allow
students to choose for whom they
open their doors.
The University should address
the risk of students feeling unsafe
or uncomfortable in their own
homes. Placing peepholes in dorm
doors is an economical, feasible
first step Stanford can take to
allow students to practice caution
and safety.
