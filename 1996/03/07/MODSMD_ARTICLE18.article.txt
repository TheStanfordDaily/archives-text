## Ted's Team passes — again 
### 
TED LELAND IS not only the direc
tor of Stanford's Department of
Athletics but also a remarkable ath
lete. Ted's game of choice — hot potato.
And he's no bench warmer. This guy's a
first-team AJI-American. As another varsi
ty athlete has allegedly run afoul of the
law, we're set to watch Ted and company
deliver another all-star performance.
The game begins with an opening pitch.
Some athlete, preferably famous, is tossed
onto the field, not by a celebrity or presi
dent, by their own volition — a scandal, a
crime, maybe even a felony. Play ball!
Ted and the gang huddle up and pre
pare their signature play — the tried and
true — they're gonna pass! Anything will
do; just keep those hands out of the mud.
Ted drops back and surveys his options.
Should he defer to Sally Cole in Judicial
Affairs? Maybe a hand-off to the Stanford
police? No! Go long! Hail Mary! Drop the
kid right into the criminal justice system!
Strike one! Two more and he's outta
there!
Satisfied, Ted and the gang hit the
showers. That's it? Sure. They've done
their job. Send in the scrubs and let them
bat the kid around until the crowd gets
bored and goes home.
Not impressed? Let's watch a super slo
mo replay.
Spring, 1994. The baseball team cap
tures the "Six-Pac" championship. Delta
Tau Delta holds a rager to celebrate. Eight

athletes — baseball, football and a
wrestler — get lit up and decide to take
their party to the Quad. One stays in the
truck while the rest swarm over the Gay
Liberation sculpture, cover it with paint,
hoot and holler and try to beat it down
with a park bench. The cops come and
hand out charges — misdemeanors all
around and felonies for the big kids. Next
day, it's national news. Play ball!
Ted takes charge, and — you guessed it
— passes! Ted declares in The Daily,
"They are students and are treated as stu
dents. .. These actions are not representa
tive of the Department." The performance
is flawless, but not decisive. So the rest of
the team chimes in. Wrestling coach Chris
Horpel initially fumbles, making public
comments about "boys just having fun,"
but Ted whips him into shape and five
days later he's a real team player. "This
behavior is not representative of the Stan
ford wrestling program," he crows in The
Daily. The troops pitch in, too. A baseball
player declares, "They happened to be
members of high-profile groups, but it's
not fair to link all the members." "They
did it as individuals, and they'll have to
accept the consequences as individuals,"
bleats another. Even Daily sports colum
nist Dave Schwartz knows the party line.
"Some people are using individual wrongs
to bludgeon a group they dislike," he
wails. Nice teamwork, boys.
When the Eric Abrams story hit the

papers, Ted treated us to an encore: "We
have always had a philosophy within
Stanford athletics that we support the
University's process in stuff like this...
Unlike some other schools whose athlet
ics departments try to run their own
investigations, our tradition and feeling
here is that we ought to hand it over to
the University."
Very principled, Ted, but let me ask
you, just when is an athlete an athlete?
Why is it when a baseball player takes a
swing at a leather ball and knocks it over a
fence he's the poster boy for Stanford ath
letics, but when he takes a swing at a stat
ue he represents no one but himself?
Sorry, Ted. You can't have your cake
and eat it too. You can't recruit athletes,
set them up with scholarships, plaster
their faces all over your public relations
materials, encourage them to socialize like
"one of the team," then play laissez faire
when they screw up. That may be good
public relations, but it's crappy ethics for
an educator. It's time to stop polishing
your Teflon coat and acknowledge both
the good and bad you contribute to Stan
ford. Sorry if that sounds harsh, Ted, but
I call 'em like I see 'em.
