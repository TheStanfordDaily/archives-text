Objection to selection processes was logical fallacy

I AM WRITING this letter in
response to the letter written by
three law school students satirizing
the claims that have allegedly been
made by other law school students that
Stanford Law practices de facto dis
crimination in its decisions to tenure
faculty by applying the wrong stan
dards to their scholarship.
Because I am a junior in the political
science department, I am only familiar
with this debate through second-hand
sources. Thus, I do not know how accu
rately the writers portrayed the
counter-arguments to their position.
However, given the information that I
gleaned from their letter, I am truly
appalled by the poor analysis that they,
three third-year students at Stanford
Law School, applied to their under
standing of the claims of their interlocu
tors. It really makes me wonder
whether they scored very low on the
analytical portion of the LSAT, but were
admitted to Stanford Law anyway
because they were legacies.
I do not know whether the dynamic
that they claim is driving the lack of
diversity at the law school — the com
mittee's inability to successfully recruit
women of all races and male minorities
— is true as a matter of fact. Yet for the
sake of argument, I will trust that the

statistical analysis that the writers did
to make this determination is correct.
The question then becomes, how does
this very real dynamic affect the integri
ty of the tenuring process that the other
students are allegedly questioning?
The answer is that it doesn't. Those
are two independent processes. It can be
true that Stanford Law is having a diffi
cult time recruiting women of all races
and male minorities; and it can also be
true that the tenuring process is dis
criminatory, or as they prefer to call it,
racist. In order to disprove the claim
that they allege the other students are
making, they must show how they
tenuring process isn't "racist." But they
didn't. The fact of the matter is, they
can't.
If it is true that Stanford Law School
is applying the standards used to deter
mine the worth of legal scholarship ded
icated to perpetuating the supremacy of
the white race and the dominance of the
male gender to legal scholarship dedicat
ed to breaking them down (which, on
the basis of the writers' admonition that
there should not be two sets of stan
dards for the two different substances of
scholarship, one might assume to be
true) the process is discriminatory,
racist and just plain stupid.
It is illogical to declare a work or

body of work undeserving of merit
because it does not meet a set of stan
dards designed to exclude it, just as it is
meaningless to say that apples are not
bananas. Yes, they are different. Some
people prefer apples over bananas and
vice-versa. Yet, fortunately for those of
us who don't like apples, people's pref
erences and the facts of the difference
between these two fruits are not used to
exclude bananas from the grocery store.
To put it another way, this analysis is
faulty because it contains selection bias.
If you use it, you haven't really deter
mined whether or not critical race theo
ry or feminist theory is good. You've
only determined that those theories are
not what you want. Your standards are
then arbitrary and discriminatory. And
because your decision to pre-select for
scholarship maintaining the racist and
sexist status quo is morally charged, you
are a racist and, although it wasn't
mentioned in the letter, a sexist too.
But why were these men so upset
about having been assigned these partic
ular epithets? What they need to do is
enroll in Stats 60 or Math 41 so that
they can get a better understanding of
the role that logic should play in analy
sis. I know that if they knew more about
the concept of selection bias, they would
not commit the fallacy of logic that leads

them to the erroneous conclusions that
make them the immoral people that
they are.
Deep down inside, I know that they
are good people, that they don't want to
be bad. Rather than wasting time quib
bling over semantics, they should get
some help for their problem.
It's very unfortunate that we have a
system that lets people like them slide
through the cracks under the guise that
they are "qualified white men." Whatev
er they made on your LSAT (speaking of
arbitrary standards for determining
qualification), they and people like them
are prime examples of how misleading
such tests can be. Under a different
regime, their faulty logic may have been
detected much earlier and they could
have been well on their way to academic
excellence and moral fortitude.
But all in all, I guess it's good that
there are these sorts of admissions pro
grams, so that people like me can kick
some science to people like them about
how to think. Everything works out for
the best. And the irony of it all is so
sweet. (Kick some science is a term from
African-American Vernacular English
used interchangeably with the Standard
English infinitive "to educate.")
