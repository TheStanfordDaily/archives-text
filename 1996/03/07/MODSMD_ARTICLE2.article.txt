# Seniors balk at CPPC reforms
## Poll shows student frustration 
### Richard H. Engel Contributing writer 
Despite constant changes aimed
at improvement, Stanford's Career
Planning and Placement Center's
interview and bidding system con
tinues to frustrate and confuse stu
dents.
This fall, the CPPC fully auto
mated the system that allows stu
dents to learn about potential em
ployers and to secure interviews
with company recruiters.
In a move that was intended to
make the system more accessible to
students, the CPPC began to make
extensive use of the World Wide
Web, said Lance Choy, director of
on-campus recruiting.
A Daily random e-mail poll of 67
seniors indicated, however, that stu
dents are unsatisfied with the new
system and complain that the incor
poration of the World Wide Web has

created a complicated system that is
difficult to understand and use.
"I've been really annoyed at the
way the CPPC has automated the
system," said Hanson Li, a cotermi
nal student in sociology.
In the poll sent to more than 200
seniors, students were asked to rate
three aspects of the CPPC's com
puterized system on a scale of one to
10, with 10 being the best score.
Students rated the ease of under
standing and operating the system
5.4, the efficiency of the system 6.0
and the system overall 5.6.
Their major problems with the
bid system included confusing in
structions, restrictions on eligibility
and bugs.
Changes to process
The CPPC has made a number of
changes to its on-campus recruiting


Sothy Chhe — Daily
system over the years.
Using the current system, stu
dents looking for jobs must register
on-line with the CPPC at the begin
ning of each quarter in order to re
ceive the 1,000 points allocated for
interview slots. Students who are
not picked out of the group in a pre
selection process by the companies
bid against each other; the highest
bidder wins a half-hour session with
the company and perhaps a job.
Students must scroll through
the CPPC's Web page to find out
which companies are coming to
campus, what the companies do and
what the employer's bidding code is.
Each Friday afternoon the bid
ding war begins. After 5 p.m., stu
dents have the option of wagering
from one to 1,000 points over the
phone for interviews with compa
nies scheduled to arrive on campus
two weeks later.
By Monday morning the high
bidders ready themselves for up
coming job interviews and the low
bidders go back to the CPPC Web
page and search for other options.
Failed bidders may also try calling
the CPPC after sp.m. the day before
the interview to see if anyone has
cancelled.
Until the fall of 1983, the system
was dramatically different.
If a senior wanted to interview
with a company that was coming to
Stanford, all the student needed to
do was drop a resume in an employ
er's box and wait by the phone.
But the old system had serious
problems, according to Choy.
Choy pointed out that previously
only a small number of students —
those who seemed exceptionally
strong on paper — were selected for
most of the interviews.
"The problem with all pre-select

is that people start stuffing en
velopes, and a couple of hot shots get
picked for everything and end up
with all the interviews," said Choy.
Choy said the imbalance was up
setting for both students and em
ployers: Students couldn't talk to
the companies they were truly inter
ested in and employers weren't fill
ing interview slots because the "hot
shot" students would often fail to go
to interviews once they had secured
jobs with their top choices.
In 1983, the CPPC developed a
system that allowed students to be
both pre-selected by employers and
bid against other students in an at
tempt to win an interview slot. Se
niors were given 200 points and had
to sign up manually at the CPPC.
"Bidding allows people who are
really interested to get interviews,"
said Choy.
Last year, the CPPC integrated a
phone system that allowed students
to place bids over the phone and this
year the CPPC has incorporated the
World Wide Web into its system.
Overload of bugs
The most common complaint
that students had was that the auto
mated system was difficult to un
derstand and that once you under
stood it, it often did not work right.
"I think it's inefficient," said se
nior Julianne Galich, an interna
tional relations major. "It's confus
ing. It has taken me all of last quar
ter to understand it and that is after
I attended all the information meet
• , 1...... yy
ings.
Galich complained that she was
unable to plan her interviews for the
quarter because the information on
the Web was constantly changing.
When Galich arrived at the
CPPC at 8:30 a.m. for an interview
scheduled two weeks in advance,
she was told that the employer had
changed its schedule since she had
last checked the Web.
"I was told it was my responsibil

ity to check the Web every day," said
Galich. "How the system stands
today, it is more of a detriment than
a service."

Poll methodology
This Stanford Daily poll was con
ducted by e-mail between Feb. 19 and
21, Two hundred seniors were selected
at random.
The responding pool consisted of
67 seniors who said they were familiar
with the Career Planning and Placement
Center. No attention was paid to gender.
The questions have a margin of error of
approximately plus or minus .57 units
at a 95 percent confidence level.

Megan O'Donnell, a coterminal
student at the Food Research Insti
tute, said that while she could not
think of a better system, the current
process is too dependent on the Web.
"It's strange that you have to be
totally dependent on a computer for
all your job information," O'Don
nell said. "A lot of people get mis
placed, [and] a lot of the [Web] pages
are under construction; it's frus
trating and takes forever."
Choy recognized the problems
but said the Web site is here to stay.
He said he plans to upgrade the sys
tem.
" I've been waiting for a vendor to
fully automate the system and do
everything on the Web," said Choy.
But the system's problems stem
from more than the under-con
struction pages.
Every major is assigned a code in
the new system, and employers
have the option of using the code to
screen candidates by major. A com
pany could request, for example,
that the CPPC only allow computer
science, economics or engineering
majors to bid for its interview slots.
Some students have complained

that the codes can lock them out of
interviews and prevent them from
trying to prove they can perform a
job regardless of their mfgor.
One student, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said he
found the CPPC's computerized
system so constraining that he
chose to register under a different
m£gor in order to prevent being
blocked out
The student said he was eventu
ally offered a position at a company
he originally would never have even
had an interview with. He said the
employer apparently never intend
ed to screen anyone out but was un
aware that restrictions had been
placed.
Another frequent complaint was
errors in the system.
"One weekend they forgot to
turn the system on at all and half of
the senior class was freaking out,"
said Li. "I've seen two descriptions
of the same company that didn't
correspond to each other.
Choy admits that this year's sys
tem has bugs. "We have had a num
ber of problems with the computer
system, and I know that it was frus
trating for students," he said.
Ezra Baylin, a senior in political
science, said he found the system in
flexible and frustrating.
' They seem to expect perfection
on the part of the students, but
don't hold themselves to the same
standards," Baylin said. "It's a veiy
unyielding system."
Choy said he hopes that in time
the Web pages will be clearer and
the system will have fewer errors.
"Bugs came up. Once I forgot to
turn on the system," said Choy,
"Over time we hope that the in
structions will become clearer, [but]
it's confusing"
For graduating seniors, howev
er, next year is too late.
"I was told in a few years it would
be running smoothly," Galich said.
"But I won't be here in a few years."
