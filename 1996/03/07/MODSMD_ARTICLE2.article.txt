# Seniors balk at CPPC reforms
## Poll shows student frustration 
### Richard H. Engel Contributing writer 
Despite constant changes aimed
at improvement, Stanford's Career
Planning and Placement Center's
interview and bidding system con
tinues to frustrate and confuse stu
dents.
This fall, the CPPC fully auto
mated the system that allows stu
dents to learn about potential em
ployers and to secure interviews
with company recruiters.
In a move that was intended to
make the system more accessible to
students, the CPPC began to make
extensive use of the World Wide
Web, said Lance Choy, director of
on-campus recruiting.
A Daily random e-mail poll of 67
seniors indicated, however, that stu
dents are unsatisfied with the new
system and complain that the incor
poration of the World Wide Web has

created a complicated system that is
difficult to understand and use.
"I've been really annoyed at the
way the CPPC has automated the
system," said Hanson Li, a cotermi
nal student in sociology.
In the poll sent to more than 200
seniors, students were asked to rate
three aspects of the CPPC's com
puterized system on a scale of one to
10, with 10 being the best score.
Students rated the ease of under
standing and operating the system
5.4, the efficiency of the system 6.0
and the system overall 5.6.
Their major problems with the
bid system included confusing in
structions, restrictions on eligibility
and bugs.
Changes to process
The CPPC has made a number of
changes to its on-campus recruiting
