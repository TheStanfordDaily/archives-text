# Josh Gohlke: Laughing leads to crying
## Only the elite can understand what true happiness is 
### 
Most readers understand
by now that I present my pain
here solely for the purpose of their
pleasure, a principle that Germans call
Schadenfreude (Look it up, engineers).
But one of my classmates had the unprece
dented sympathy to become actually con
cerned about me. "What makes you
happy?", she asked
I told her it would take me several hours
to answer that question. I said this because
it's very important to me that people think
I'm "complicated."
However, in panicked response to my
more pressing weekly duties, I realized I
would only need 900 words or so to answer
that question.
Today's average American will never
achieve happiness because he fails to
understand it. He envisions happiness as a
glowing personification that will knock on
the front door of his Palos Verdes mansion
on a sunny Saturday morning, awakening
him and his wife, who is beautiful and
demure but knows how to be nasty.

Au contraire, happiness consists of a
series of unconnected and purportedly
unimportant moments, people and events.
The following partial list of the compo
nents of my own personal happiness may
serve to illustrate this concept.
Really Good Bike Accidents
Two determined individuals speeding
along to their predetermined, p re-pro fes
sional ends and — crash! — spokes, gears,
maybe even a little blood all over the place.
What could be more delightful than such
an intrusion of chaos into the awful order
of Stanford University? Make sure no
one's dead, but then let fly a hearty guf
faw!
Making Stanford Girls Cry
It's fun to chastise any girl until she's
about to explode, but this is particularly
easy with Stanford girls. year, I made
a freshman cry by telling her she was"the
worst Pro Fro Host ever." I also made one
of her roommates cry on seven separate
occasions, which for me means seven times
the happiness.

Drugs
Drugs were invented to make people
happy, and they rarely fail. My grandfa
ther is a doctor, so my mother taught me
that if I had a problem there was a phar
maceutical to fix it. Negative emotions can
always be corrected — and happiness
achieved — by the addition of good chemi
cals to counteract the bad ones.
Detailed Violent Fantasies
Nothing improves my mood like a
specifically formulated hypothetical act of
destruction. Abstract threats such as "I'm
going to kill that guy" are little more than
unhappy cliches, but the vividly imagined
assault is infinitely more effective: "I'd like
to grab that guy's head and hit his face
with my forehead so hard it would smash
his nose." My most recent violent fantasy
involved wrapping large rocks in paper and
going to Flicks to throw them at people.
Rainbows
No, I was just fucking around.
People Who Are "Angpry"
In the words of Suicidal Tendencies,

"Oh, did I offend you? Well, I'm sorry, but
maybe you need to be offended!" So far, the
former president of Kappa Sig, a soil
crazed Earth Systems bureaucrat and a
few Res Ed drones have indicated that my
slanders should be quelled in the form of a
scathing letter to The Daily. These people
could make me happier only by following
through on their threats of retribution.
My Discman
This was the best Christmas present I
received this year, because it allows me to
retreat even farther from the outside
world. To you, it's just walking to class on
another Monday afternoon, but to me it's
an amazing Pixies video.
Dan Barthmeier
Sophomore Dan "The Champ" Barth
meier is perhaps the most solid presence of
positive energy that I have ever known. I
have been friends with this man for almost
two years and cannot see any negative
qualities. His departure to Germany will
be a sad day for America.
Joey Ramone

He has never been photographed with
out his sunglasses. And he also penned the
lines, "Guess I'm gonna have to tell
'em / That I got no cerebellum."
Dinosaurs
Dinosaurs rule.
Gratuitous Confusion and Nonsense
My dad's friend once had a cockatiel. I
asked him what the bird's name was, and
he said, "Goose." He paused and then
added, "But I call him Arthur." I asked
him why. "Just to keep people guessing,"
he said.
The Pi Phi Formal
For me, Christmas just means, "Ten
more weeks until the Pi Phi Formal!"
Everyone Else Is a Robot
Secure in the knowledge that I'm the
only real human being on the planet, how
can happiness possibly elude me?
