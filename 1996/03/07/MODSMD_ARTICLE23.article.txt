## It's crunch time for men's hoops 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
With the pressure of making
the NCAA tournament homing
larger than Shaquille O'Neal over
a plate of double-decker tacos, the
Stanford basketball team faces
the chore of re-learning the ten
dencies of Arizona by 7:30
tonight, as well as the danger of
being left out of the tournament

has become the best team in the
conference, according to Stanford

row, eight of their last ten, and are
coming off a rare road sweep of
the Washington schools.
Davie has upped his scoringav
erage to 14.3, tops on a team that
has six players averaging at least
9.5 points per game. He also leads
the conference in rebounding at
9.6 per game.
Aside from 6-foot-2 point
guard Reggie Geary, the rest of
Arizona's rotation consists of four
players between 6-4 arid 6-7 â€” no
real power players, but the most
quickness this side of UCLA.
"Arizona now has more
perimeter play and more move

dom to a lot of their guys because
there isn't just one set guy to
throw the ball to inside," Mont-
