## It's crunch time for men's hoops 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
With the pressure of making
the NCAA tournament homing
larger than Shaquille O'Neal over
a plate of double-decker tacos, the
Stanford basketball team faces
the chore of re-learning the ten
dencies of Arizona by 7:30
tonight, as well as the danger of
being left out of the tournament
come Sunday when the field of 64
is announced.
Nine weeks have passed since
the two teams played each other,
and both have adjusted to person
nel changes since Stanford's 80-
71 win on Jan. 6. at Maples Pavil
ion.
While the Cardinal (17-8 over
all, 10-6 Pacific 10 Conference)
have worked four freshmen into
the rotation and dealt with the
loss of junior Rich Jackson to in
jury, the Wildcats lost their lead
ing scorer and rebounder, center
Joseph Blair, to academic ineligi
bility in the middle of January.
Changing to a perimeter at

tack and filling Blair's hole with 6-
foot-8, 265-pound forward Ben
Davis, No. 11 Arizona (23-5,12-4)
has become the best team in the
conference, according to Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery.
The Wildcats have won five in a
row, eight of their last ten, and are
coming off a rare road sweep of
the Washington schools.
Davie has upped his scoringav
erage to 14.3, tops on a team that
has six players averaging at least
9.5 points per game. He also leads
the conference in rebounding at
9.6 per game.
Aside from 6-foot-2 point
guard Reggie Geary, the rest of
Arizona's rotation consists of four
players between 6-4 arid 6-7 — no
real power players, but the most
quickness this side of UCLA.
"Arizona now has more
perimeter play and more move
ment, which has given more free
dom to a lot of their guys because
there isn't just one set guy to
throw the ball to inside," Mont-
gomery said.
He also added that while he
thinks the best shot at beating the
Wildcats would be to exploit their
lack of depth inside, he said his team
hasn't been too successful at going
at inside players this year.
Because of the quickness and
athletic ability of Arizona's perime
ter play era, expect another rough
outing for Brevin Knight and Dion
Cross. Cross exploded for a career
high 30 points, including a 7-for-ll
performance form three-point land,
against Arizona earlier this year so
stopping him is a priority in coach
Lute Olson's mind. The Wildcats
have shown penchant for defense
lately, limiting opponents to 43-per
cent shooting over its five-game
winning streak.
As any follower of Stanford bas
ketball this year knows, as Knight
and Cross go, so go the Cardinal.
In Stanford's 17 wins, the back
court duo has combined to shoot 49
percent from the field, 47 percent
from three-point range. Each aver
ages over 16 points per win as well.
In the eight losses, however, field
goal accuracy drops to 27 percent,
with three-point shooting bottom
ing out at 23 percent. Knight's scor
ing average drops to 10.4 while
Cross only averaged 9.9 points in
the eight losses.
With all the focus going toward
stopping Knight and Cross, Andy
Poppink has been able to get his
points on a consistent basis. While
his shooting percentage drops in the
eight losses (44 percent, compared
to 55 percent in the 17 wins), his
scoring average only dips from 14.8
to 13.8. His rebounding actually im
proves in the losses, from 7.9 to 9.0
per game.
"Andy has been able to get in and
rebound the ball," Montgomery
said. "He's been the guy who's post
ed the numbers for us and we've

needed it
"The ball always seems to come
back to Brevin to solve the prob
lems. It's tough, nonetheless he has
to handle it. But we need other play
ers to take hold of this thing and
make some plays to take a little pres
sure off everybody."
Dropping three of its last four
games, Stanford is well aware that
unless it wins at least one game this
weekend, a tournament bid may not
be offered. Closing the season with a
game at Cal and then a road trip to
Arizona doesn't help lift the spirits,
either.
"Probably the two toughest
places to play for us are at Cal and
Arizona," Montgomery said. "We
knew going into the season that
looking at the schedule fell that we
had better have a mfyority of the hay
in the barn at this point of the sea-
M
son.
Montgomery also noted that
Stanford could finish no worse than
fourth in the league and theoretical
ly could still finish second if the Car
dinal comes away with two wins this
weekend.
That's rather unlikely, as Stan
ford's only victory in 20 games at
McKale Center came 12 years ago
and the Cardinal has lost six
straight at Arizona State.
But much like last year when
Stanford won its final two games to
make the tournament, the lure of
postseason play may light the fire
under this team that has been miss
ing on a consistent basis.
"I just hope guys realize that,
even beyond the need to win
games, we need to get going in a
roll to go into postseason play,"
Poppink said. "I'm still excited to
be playing because I see the end of
the road is right there for me, and
I really hope I can get the other
guys excited a little bit to be play
ing for a while longer — not to just
realize that it's maybe just these
two games and then one more but
there's no reason for us not to
keep playing if we're not playing
well."
