# Swimmers make big splash at trials
## Thompson, Grote and Hudepohl will head to Atlanta this summer 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. - Kurt
Grote had been told that the U.S.
Olympic Trials are the most intense
swim meet in the world.
"I believe it," said Grote, who
earned a spot on the 1996 Olympic
team by finishing second in the 100-
meter breaststroke tonight.
The intensity of the meet derives
from the process of selecting the
team — the top two finishers in each
event go to Atlanta; there is no
bronze medal or any other reward
for third place. Even the Olympic
Games are more forgiving to those
who show.
But for those like Grote, who fin
ish first or second, the Olympic trials
present a chance to pursue lifelong
dreams.
"It really was an unreal experi
ence," Grote said in a press confer
ence one hour after his race. "I'm
sort of just now getting to the point
where I realize I made the Olympics.
The first 10 minutes [after the race]
I felt like I was living in a dream. It's
something I've thought about for so
long, it's almost like it hasn't hap

Joe Hudepohl swam to a berth in thel 996 Summer Olympics last night. Hudepohl, who swam at Stanford from
1992 to 1995, qualified in the 200-meter freestyle.
penedyet."
The results displayed on the
scoreboard in the Indiana Universi
ty Natatorium showed Grote as the
winner, with a time of 1 minute, 2.03
seconds. Two lanes over, Ten
nessee's Jeremy Linn, who had been
in a three-way photo finish with
Grote and Club Wolverine's Eric
Wunderlich, showed 1:08. After
about two minutes of confusion, the
final results placed Linn first at
1:01.94 with Grote second and Wun
derlich, the victim of the cruelest
possible error, was bumped to the
dreaded third place spot at 1:02.39.
When asked if first or second
place mattered to him, Grote, a 1995
graduate, did not hesitate to answer.
"It makes not one iota of differ
ence," he said. "My goal here was to
make the Olympic team — I didn't
care about what my time was or
whether I got first or second. I feel
like that swim was a complete suc
cess, I did everything I wanted to
do."
Grote executed his race-plan per
fectly, turning in the heat's fastest
second-leg afler hitting the halfway
point in third place.
"I had no idea where I was at the
50," said Grote, who will enter Stan
ford Medical School next year. "I
close my eyes on my turns just so I
won't know where anyone is so that
I can concentrate on my own race. I
had no idea how fast I was out, but I

knew I was going to have a great sec
ond 50."
On this first night of competition
at the trials, three swimmers with
ties to Stanford earned Olympic
berths. In the evening's first race,
Jenny Thompson, another 1995
graduate, swam to a third-place fin
ish in the 100 freestyle. In the 100
and 200 freestyles, the top four fin
ishers are named to the team, in
order to field a relay squad. Only the
top two finishers will swim those
races in the individual com-

petition.
Thompson, who won
the event at the 1992
Trials before going on to
capture a silver in
Barcelona, was happy
to become a two-time
Olympian, but was de- /
jected in not qualify- \
ing to swim the event
in Atlanta.

"I'm a little disappoint-

cd," said Thompson, who was
the fastest qualifier in the prelimi
nary heats. "I didn't expect to finish
third. I felt good going in and I was
enjoying the moment, but I tight
ened up in the last 25.1 never imag
ined this would happen — I guess I
never thought of the negative side.
It's sort of a shock to be third."
Separating Thompson from sec
ond place was a mere sue one-hun
dredths of a second. Angel Martino
touched in 55.39 to Thompson's
55.45. The race was won by Amy
VanDyken with a time 0f55.27.
Thompson will swim three more
races, including the 200-meter

freestyle tomorrow and the 100-
meter butterfly, which she considers
her strongest event, on Saturday.
While she did not hide her disap
pointment, Thompson said she is
ready to compete in those events.
"It's a good feeling to know that
I'm an Olympian," she said. "It takes
that pressure off of me."
Joe Hudepohl, who swam for
Stanford from 1992 t095, shared the
same mixed emotions with Thomp
son after his swim in the 200
freestyle. Hudepohl finished fourth

in the event he won at
trials four years ago as
an 18-year-old high
school senior. Al
though Hudepohl
, left Stanford to
) train with his club
coach at Shore
Aquatics in Long
Beach, he still feels
support from his col-

legiate teammates.

"They're a great group
of guys and I'm glad that they sup
port me and my decision to leave,
they were behind me the whole
way," said Hudepohl, who felt in
spired by Grote's performance. "It's
exciting to see people make the
Olympics, and when it's someone
like Kurt, who I've been teammates
with and swum relays with, it's even
more special."
Like Thompson, Hudepohl had
mixed emotions alter seeing his re
sult on the scoreboard.
"When I looked and I saw fourth,
I was kind of relieved, kind of disap
pointed but happy," Hudepohl said.

"But not many people get the chance
to be an Olympian let alone a two
time Olympian. It's a special feeling
to get to go twice, I can't complain."
Other Stanford swimmers com
peting yesterday included: Mary Ed
wards '95 (13th, 100 free), senior
Lisa Jacob (12th, 100 free), senior
Jessica Tong (30th, 100 free), junior
Michelle Jesperson (35th, 100 free),
freshman Emily Smith (36th, 100
free), Tyler Mayfleld '94 (7th, 100
breast), junior Sarah Anderson
(16th, 400 IM), freshman Kari Ed
wards (21st, 400 IM), Dan Kanner
'95 (18th, 200 free) and senior Scott
Gagner (20th, 200 free).
Today, several more swimmers
with Cardinal ties will vie for a covet
ed spot on the Olympic team. The
women's 200 freestyle will feature
Thompson, Jacob, Anderson, Jes
person, senior Jane Skillman and
sophomore Amy Oberhelman.
Swimming men's 400 individual
medley will be sophomore Tom
Wilkens and junior Matt Thompson.
Also swimming the 200 free will be
two-time Olympian Janet Evans,
who was at Stanford from 1990-91.
Each swimmer has hopes and
dreams of joining Grote, Thompson
and Hudepohl in Atlanta this sum
mer, where Grote anticipates his ex
perience here will help ease the ten
sion at the Olympic Games.
"I think that there's going to be a
lot of pressure at the Olympics, but I
really feel that I'm prepared for it
after this meet," Grote said. "If I can
put up with what I went through
today... The Olympics couldn't pos
sibly be any worse."
