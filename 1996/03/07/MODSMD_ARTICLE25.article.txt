# Cardinal to take on 'Cats
## Women's hoops looks to remain perfect in Pac-10 
### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
For all intents and purposes,
the road to the Women's Final
Four starts tonight at Maples
Pavilion for the Stanford
women's basketball team.
With the Pacific 10 Conference
title wrapped up and the opportu
nity to host a subregional virtual
ly assured (that honor is awarded
to the top four seeded teams in
each region), the Cardinal will
concentrate on locking up a No. 1
seed tonight against Arizona
when it tangles with the Wildcats
in a 7 p.m. start. With a win
tonight and a victory over Arizona
State on Saturday, Stanford is all
but guaranteed a top seed when
NCAA tournament pairings are
announced Sunday at 4:30 p.m.
"Right now we're kind of look
ing at the bigger picture, and
that's working for a No. 1 seed,"
said women's head coach Amy
Tucker. "It is very important how
you finish and I think people un
derstand that.
"Last year was an excellent les
son — we went 17-1 in the confer
ence and still did not get a No. 1
seed. So I think that in people's
minds, if you go 18-0 — we're not
guaranteed La top seed], but we're
certainly giving ourselves the best
chance of that happening."
Stanford (23-2 overall, 16-0
Pac-10), which moved up to No. 3
in this week's Associated Press
poll thanks to second-ranked
Georgia's loss in the SEC tourna
ment, might be without the ser
vices of sophomore forward
Vanessa Nygaard this weekend.
Nygaard, the team's leading re
bounder (7.1 rebounds per game)
and second-leading scorer (14.8
points per game), suffered a
stress fracture in her left foot
early last week and sat out Satur
day night's game against Califor
nia, the first start she'd missed all
season.
"It's really disappointing that
Vanessa had the stress fracture at
this point — she's had a great sea
son," Tucker said. "Obviously, we
want to save her for the tourna

ment if we have a choice."
If all goes as planned this week
end, NCAA tournament play will
kick off next Friday at Maples Pavil
ion, where the Cardinal will host
three other teams in subregional
action. Assuming the women se
cure a No. 1 seed, they will open
play Friday night against the No. 16
seed, then play the winner of the
contest pairing up the eight- and
nine-seeds in the subregional final
on Sunday, with the winner ad
vancing to the Sweet 16 at Seattle's
Hec Edmundson Pavilion.
"It's really nice to get two
games at home and play in front of
your fans and get on a roll a little
bit going into the regional," Tuck
er said.
Arizona, meanwhile, has won
five of its last seven games to im
prove to 9-7 in the Pac-10 (18-7
overall), good enough for third
place in the conference. But in a
year when the first- and third
place teams are separated by seven
games in the Pac-10 standings
with two games left to play, third
place in the conference might not

be good enough to earn an NCAA
tournament bid.
"I hope three get in," Tucker
said, "even though I think what's
happening below us in the confer
ence — with everyone beating each
other up a little bit — hurts that
opportunity. The third-place team
now has seven or eight losses. That
does not look good."
What looks even worse are Ari
zona's prospects tonight. Coming
off last weekend's 51-point blud
geoning of Cal, the Stanford
women have now won 17 consecu
tive games overall, 29 straight at
home and 25 in a row in Pac-10
play. It would take nothing short
of a miracle for the Wildcats to
snap those streaks tonight.
"The first time we played them,
we were without three of our top
seven players and we beat them by
20," Tucker said. "[We] kind of em
barrassed them down there. I
think they're going to be really fo
cused on playing hard."
Stanford has won 19 in a row
over Arizona, a streak dating back
to the 1985-86 season, and has
taken seven straight from the Sun
Devils. A pair of wins this weekend
will make the Cardinal only the
second team in Pac-10 history to
go a perfect 18-0.
