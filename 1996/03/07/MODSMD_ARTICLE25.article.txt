## Women's hoops looks to remain perfect in Pac-10 
### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
For all intents and purposes,
the road to the Women's Final
Four starts tonight at Maples
Pavilion for the Stanford
women's basketball team.
With the Pacific 10 Conference
title wrapped up and the opportu
nity to host a subregional virtual
ly assured (that honor is awarded
to the top four seeded teams in
each region), the Cardinal will
concentrate on locking up a No. 1
seed tonight against Arizona
when it tangles with the Wildcats
in a 7 p.m. start. With a win

poll thanks to second-ranked
Georgia's loss in the SEC tourna

vices of sophomore forward
Vanessa Nygaard this weekend.
Nygaard, the team's leading re
bounder (7.1 rebounds per game)
and second-leading scorer (14.8
points per game), suffered a
stress fracture in her left foot
early last week and sat out Satur
day night's game against Califor
nia, the first start she'd missed all
season.
"It's really disappointing that
Vanessa had the stress fracture at
this point — she's had a great sea
son," Tucker said. "Obviously, we
want to save her for the tourna
