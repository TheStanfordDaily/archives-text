# Track and field heads to Indianapolis
## Individuals will try to shine at NCAA Indoor Championships 
### Sam Wang Contributing writer 
In a sport where the team often takes precedence over the
individuals, nine Stanford athletes travel to Indianapolis this
weekend in search of personal glory at the NCAA Indoor
Track and Field Championships.
These athletes qualified for the NCAAs by posting some of
the top marks in the country in their respective events during
the indoor season. However, many of the Cardinal partici
pants were unsure of their status until the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Indoor Championships held only two
weeks ago in Reno, Nev.
Among the individuals who qualified for the nationals at
the MPSFs — the athletes' final indoor meet before the
NCAAs — was junior sprinter Jimmie Johnson in the 400-
meters with a season-best time of 47.28. Despite coming in
first, Johnson was initially disappointed after the MPSF be
cause he was unsure if his time will be good enough to quali
fy for the national meet.
"Coming in first was nice, but it wasn't the goal. The goal
was to qualify for the nationals and to run in the 46-[second
range]," Johnson said. "I didn't get the job done, so I was dis
appointed in that."
However, after the meet Johnson found out his time was
good enough for a trip to Indianapolis.
