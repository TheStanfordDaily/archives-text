# Track and field heads to Indianapolis
## Individuals will try to shine at NCAA Indoor Championships 
### Sam Wang Contributing writer 
In a sport where the team often takes precedence over the
individuals, nine Stanford athletes travel to Indianapolis this
weekend in search of personal glory at the NCAA Indoor
Track and Field Championships.
These athletes qualified for the NCAAs by posting some of
the top marks in the country in their respective events during
the indoor season. However, many of the Cardinal partici
pants were unsure of their status until the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Indoor Championships held only two
weeks ago in Reno, Nev.
Among the individuals who qualified for the nationals at
the MPSFs — the athletes' final indoor meet before the
NCAAs — was junior sprinter Jimmie Johnson in the 400-
meters with a season-best time of 47.28. Despite coming in
first, Johnson was initially disappointed after the MPSF be
cause he was unsure if his time will be good enough to quali
fy for the national meet.
"Coming in first was nice, but it wasn't the goal. The goal
was to qualify for the nationals and to run in the 46-[second
range]," Johnson said. "I didn't get the job done, so I was dis
appointed in that."
However, after the meet Johnson found out his time was
good enough for a trip to Indianapolis.

Members of the track and field team will head to Indianapolis
this weekend for the NCAA Indoor Championships.
Johnson is also competing on
the distance medley relay team
which is tentatively scheduled to
have senior co-captain Mark
Fadil, redshirt sophomore Jason
Lunn and freshman Jake Maas
running along with Johnson.
The women's distance medley
team also qualified to run in this
weekend's meet on the merits of
its Reno performance, a time of
11:46.83. The team consists of
sophomore Monal Chokshi, fresh
man Mary Cobb and senior cap
tains Dena Dey and Tyra Holt,
both of whom competed in the
same event last year when they
finished sixth, good enough for

All-American honors.
Despite being a freshman, Cobb
has already shown herself to have
plenty of poise under the bright
lights of big competitions. Her
fifth-place showing in the cross
country national championships
this fall contributed mightily to
the Cardinal's ninth-place finish
in the team competition. Her expe
rience will come in handy since
Cobb will be doing double duty in
Indianapolis — she's also running
in the 5,000.
Sophomore Sarna Renfro joins
Cobb in the individual events in
the 3,000 by posting a provisional
qualifying time of 9:44.88 in the
MPSFs.
The championship spans a two
day period, starting on Friday, and
will mark the formal conclusion to
the indoor season.
