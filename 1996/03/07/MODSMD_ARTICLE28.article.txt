# Sweet revenge?
## Women's lacrosse to battle Davis 
### Solveig Pederson Staff writer 
Two weeks after narrowly los
ing to UC- Davis 6-5 in overtime,
Stanford women's lacrosse is
ready to get. its revenge.
The Cardinal will take the
field at Davis at 1 p.m. Saturday.
Stanford and the Aggies have
clashed in the Western Women's
Lacrosse League championship
game for the past three years.
Last season, Stanford topped the
Aggies 8-6 to win the title for the
first time in three years, and the
competition between these long
time rivals is fierce.
"Davis is always a tough team
because it's 50 percent playing
and 50 percent mental," said se
nior co-captain Wendy Kula.
"But everyone is going to be fired
up because it was a real tough
loss for us last time."
Over the past weeks in prac
tice, the Cardinal has concen
trated on strengthening the finer
points of its game. Tuesday's ses
sion focused primarily on shoot
ing, since less than 25 percent of
Cardinal shots found the net. in
last weekend's loss to the Uni
versity of Vermont.
"Every time we take a shot, we
have to know it will be a good
shot," said sophomore Carole
Fakhry.
But the challenge is also to
match up against the solid Davis
defense.
"They're very aggressive, al
most a zone defense," said head
coach Kay Cowperthwait. "We're
working on moving the ball, set
ting the picks, trying to get in
side the zone."
Because of that strong zone,
Stanford needs to move the ball
quickly in order to be able to
shoot, according to Kula. In addi
tion, Stanford's defense is work
ing on double-teaming opposing
players sooner to avoid foul trou
ble and incurring the free posi

tion shots that took their toll in
recent games.
Davis, a "run-and-gun" team,
tends to gain possession and im
mediately try to run down field to
the goal, while Stanford prefers a
slower style that relies on good
stick skills and accurate passing
strategies. The Cardinal hopes to
run Saturday's game its way.
"Everyone's just really excit
ed to go and play against Davis,"
said senior Gaby DiMuro. "We'll
slow it down and play our 'run
and-gun' team."

If we trust each other,
we are by far the better
skilled team. It's about
who wants it more.'

If the 0-2 Cardinal returns
victorious this weekend, it will
be a major turning point in the
squad's season. A victory would
create momentum that would
carry through into Stanford's
road trip to Nashville during
spring break, where they will
face many of the toughest NCAA
Division I opponents. In 1995,
the Cardinal posted a perfect 12-
0 record in the Western Women's
Lacrosse League and only
dropped five games overall.
"We're not used to losing —
we want to get our first win,"
Fakhry said.
To win on Saturday, Stanford
needs to come together as a
team. The entire Cardinal mid
field is new this year, Kula said.
Players are trying to work as
much as possible together, build
ing trust.
"If we trust each other, we are
by far the better skilled team,"
Kula said. "It's about who wants
it more."
