# Men's golf to take on nation's best
## Cardinal looks to regroup at the Golf Digest Invite 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
For the season, the men's golf
team has displayed a Jekyll-and-
Hyde personality, alternately going
from awesome to awful at a mo
ment's notice. The Cardinal can only
hope that its good side shows
through this weekend, as the squad
faces its most difficult test of the year
at the Golf Digest Collegiate in Hous
ton, Texas
Coming off a horrendous sev
enth-place showing at the John
Burns Invitational in Kanehoe,
Hawaii, 17th-ranked Stanford seeks
to relocate the strong game they dis
played only two weeks earlier at the
Ping Collegiate in Tucson, Ariz.,
where they finished second overall.
"We showed what our potential
could be if we got things together,"
said head coach Wally Goodwin of
the Ping tournament. "We were by
no means at our best, but you could
see glimpses."
However, while the Arizona tour
nament included a few ranked
squads, the competition exhibited
there pales in comparison to the
amalgamation of talent the team wi 11
face this weekend. No less than 12 of
the top 15 teams in the nation will be
vying for the title, including eight of
the top nine. With such powerhous
es as Arizona State and Oklahoma
State in the running, Stanford finds
itself a heavy underdog.
"No one has given us much re
spect this year," Goodwin said. "We
haven't shown the greatest form,
but I know my guys are capable."
The Cardinal will once again be
led by sophomore All-American
Tiger Woods, who played himself to
the top of the Rolex Collegiate Golf
rankings by capturingthe individual
crown at the Burns event. While
Woods may be the odds-on favorite
to take the title this weekend at the
TPC-W T oodlands, he will meet a

strong challenge from other top col
legians, such as Brad Elder of Texas
and Darren Angel of ASU.
Freshman Joel Kribel and senior
captain Jerry Chang will also be ex
pected to play key roles in the team's
performance. Normally displaying
polished, consistent games, both
players struggled last week in
Hawaii, en route to finishes outside
of the top 20. After a particularly
frustrating tournament, Kribel
hopes to return to the form that has
made him one of the top rookies in
the nation.
"We had a lot to get discouraged
about [in Hawaii)," Kribel said, "but
hopefully we'll be able to turn it
around and work really hard for this
tournament."
Most likely the fate of the team
will lie with the play of the No. 4 and
5 golfers. A nagging problem
throughout the season, the scores
produced in the final two spots have
been the sorest spot of a team that
has suffered a number of problems
and breakdowns. After countless
shuffling, Goodwin has still been un
able to come up with a productive
pair to round out the squad.
"I keep expressing this point, but
it's just too much to ask the top three
guys to carry this team," he said.
"Wherever the four and five guys
take us is where the team will go."
Adding to the Cardinal's troubles
will be the high winds expected at the
Woodlands. A cold front approach
ing the Houston area may create
poor weather. While it would pale in
comparison to the 40-mile-per-hour
gales which blew the squad away in
Hawaii, any sort of wind can be seen
as problematic.
"We just have a difficult time ad
justing to it," Goodwin said of the
wind. "It's something that we're
going to have to learn to deal with if
we want any reasonable hope of tak
ing our performance to the next
level."
