# In a coup, Stanford lands Panther papers
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
After years of effort, Stanford Univer
sity Libraries has permanently added
the Black Panther Party archive to its
Special Collections Department.
The archive includes material in a va
riety of forms, including unpublished
manuscripts and papers, photographs,
art and videotapes. "There is everything
from reports of community programs to

material relating to the FBI and its ef
forts to suppress the party to material re
lating to Huey Newton's trial," said His
tory Prof. Clayborne Carson, director of
the Martin Luther King Papers Project.
Carson called the Panther archive
"one of the most significant social move
ment collections of the recent past."
The University originally acquired
the papers last August when it made an
agreement with the Huey P. Newton
Foundation Inc., named after the late

party activist, to temporarily house the
archive.
Last week, the University and the
foundation reached a formal agreement,
the terms of which were not disclosed.
The collection will be permanently
housed in the Special Collections Depart
ment of Green Library.
"I am excited that this has finally hap
pened," said Carson. "I have been a facil
itator trying to get the Huey Newton
Foundation and the University togeth

er."
Elaine Brown, vice president of the
foundation's board of directors, said she
is excited the papers are at Stanford.
"These are the last records of our party
as it was — they are quite extensive,"
said Brown. "We intend to continue dis
cussions on these topics — it isn't dead
history."
Carson acted as a liaison between the
University and Black Panther
Party leaders David Hilliard, Elaine
Brown and Fredrika Newton. Car
son said he has been working on ob
taining the papers for more than
three years.
"It has been a long process of get
ting two sides to understand each
other — [the former party leaders]
were not very familiar with Stan
ford, and when we first started to
talk, the idea of putting the papers

here would not have occurred to
them," Carson said.
Tony Angiletta, director of col
lections for the libraries, said as
soon as the archive is fully orga
nized, which should take until the
end of this year, it will move from its
current location at the Stanford
Auxiliary Library to Green.
"Like any archives of any real
size, you want to make it the most
usable for faculty and students it
can be," said Angiletta "We will
probably have an electronic finding
aide and organize it by document
type, date, organization and classi
fication."

Student accessibility is an im
portant aspect of the project to
Carson. Carson taught a Peters
Seminar on the Black Panther Pa
pers this fall, and he said "that
seminar has been a large part of
the reason I have tried to get the
archive."
Carson said he sees the new
archive as an extension of the King
Papers Project, which began at
Stanford in 1985. "We are offering
them a research opportunity that is
unique — with both projects, Stan
ford students will have research op
portunities that are unique to this
campus."
