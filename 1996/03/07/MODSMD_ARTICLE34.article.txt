And without an overarching vision, how could that

Carey Perloff, artistic director of A.C.T., possesses
each of these qualities. She has needed every one to
achieve the status she enjoys today.

theaters," Perloff said. She sat in her sparsely decorat-

Perloff has worked in New York, where her former
company won an Obie award lor artistic excellence,
and in Los Angeles, where she achieved a Drama-
Logue award for outstanding direction. She studied
112 Classics at Stanford and after graduation attended
Oxford as a lulbright scholar. She has been artistic di
rector of A.C.T. since 1992, has recently opened a glit
teringly restored Geary Theater with her production of
Shakespeare's "The Tempest" and is married with two
young children. She is only 37.
"She is pretty self-confident, she was always good at
everything she did," said her mother, Marjorie Perloff,
an Fnglish professor at Stanford. "And of course she's
opinionated."
\ lind-set
Perloff's definitive opinions and forthright person
ality have both helped her get where she is today and
caused many conflicts in her life.
This was true in childhood — it led to strange con
tradictions in her personality. "I built doll houses, the
size of bookshelves, up to the ceiling," Perloff said. She
created winter scenes, make-believe ice rinks — "any
thing I could imagine," she said. But at the same time
she adamantly refused to believe in Santa Claus, said
i her mother.
\ When she went to Oxford, Perloff's opinions
1 clashed rather more dramatically with those held by
Y university authorities. Perloff was directing "The
»tl Satyricon" by Pretonius, and had printed post-
Mkk card-type invitations to send around the uni
versity. The picture on the postcard, taken
from an original drawing of a Grecian vase,
Ml depicted a naked man having an erection while
J another sat at his feet. The university proctors, in
charge of student discipline, were outraged. Perloff
laughed as she described their reaction. They refused to
allow her to deliver the cards through the internal uni

versity mailing system.
"The publicity was great, said Perloff, eyebrows
raised. At times when she speaks, Perloff seems arro
gant — when asked what kinds of shows she has done
she responded, "Everything, everything." In other mo
ments, she is funny — she described an embarrassing
theatrical moment when her lead actress suddenly dis
appeared off stage and could be heard running to the
dressing room to retrieve a missing prop.
At all times, however, Perloff is composed. She is the
perfect foil to the pandemonium generated by actors,
designers and students in the busy main lobby of the
A.C.T. offices.
C onlli( lincj visions
Her latest clash, however, has had more serious con
sequences. Benny Sato Ambush, a former A.C.T. asso
ciate artistic director, resigned from the company after
five years last April. The reason for his decision, he said
in a telephone interview from the Old Globe Theater in

San Diego, was simple: "Under her leadership, I think
the theater has no social vision, zero, none."
Their relationship began on a flat note.
Perloff, who has the power to hire and fire, began by
asking Ambush and the other two associate directors to
give up their titles. Ambush refused. "Any other title
would have meant, in essence, a demotion," he said.
When Ambush heard that Perloff had approached
Richard Syde, offering him an associate position, Am
bush told her that he would only stay on two condi
tions: that he keep his title and receive the same salary
as Syde. Perloff agreed.
A few months later, Ambush discovered that he was
being paid less than Syde. He confronted Perloff.
"There was hemming and hawing and a lot of ex
cuses," he said, "but she did agree that it shouldn't have
happened." Ambush received sporadic payments over
the next few months, but was only given full reim
bursement when he finally left the company.
The final blow to the relationship came when Am
bush was not given any show to direct in the '95-'96

season. The apparent stum- \ \
bling block was that Perloff and
Ambush, who is African-Ameri- 1
can, had different aesthetic visions
of theater. He wanted to be more
community- and activist-oriented
than she did.
"I think that we have amply demonstrated |
that we are serving a diverse audience, in terms of
age, gender and ethnicity," said Perloff in answer to
Ambush's criticism. To the suggestion that her own clas
sical background may incline her towards Eurocentric
works, she replied: "Great plays stimulate great thought
and great emotion. 1 try to choose plays that will do that."
For Ambush this meant only one thing. "1 was
squeezed out, I became an invisible man," he said. He
resigned.
I lie price ol demanding standards
"1 think that Carey has rubbed some people the
wrong way," said Daniel Cantor, an actor in the A.C.T.
company. "It's inevitable when you take over a theater."
Tact is perhaps not Perloff's strong point.
"There were times with 'Arcadia' when I needed her
to back off," Cantor said, describing Perloff's critical j
approach when she directed the West Coast premiere I
of Tom Stoppard's play. "If you water a plant too n
much, it will drown." 11l
Peter Maradudin, resident lighting designer at ill
A.C.T., laughed when he discussed Perloff's style of
directing: "Everyone answers to her."
Perloff, however, answers to a higher authority too i
— the board and subscribers of A.C.T. This can be a
pressure when her vision conflicts with theirs. For ex- '
ample, Perloff was determined to stage "The Tempest"
for the opening of the Geary Theater. The board, how
ever, was not so sure. As a result, when the San Francis
co Chronicle lampooned the production, the board
took an "I-told-you-so" attitude, according to Perloff's
mother.
"In some ways there is a price to be here," she said,
"but the advantage is that it is her theater and she can
do anything she wants."
There are few seats remaining for Perloff's produc
tion of "The Tempest." A.C.T.'s bank balance is healthier
now than it has been for years. Perloff has crafted a
strong negotiating position in order to choose the future
productions of the company. I ler one caveat is simple: "I
have no interest in directing mediocre literature."
The trade-off has come at a price. Perloff
needs every ounce of energy and drive that she
possesses to do her job while also maintaining her
marriage and raising a family.
Her husband gave up his job in New York to move to
San Francisco and now works as a lawyer. Most of
A.C.T. have become familiar with the sight and sound
of 6-year-old Lexie and 19-month-old Nicholas run
ning around the offices and even attending rehearsals. ,
"It's chaos," admitted Perloff. "You try to include i
them as much as possible in what you do. This was 1
who I was." KA
Cantor has a unique memory concerning the
birth of her son Nicholas. He was strolling KjjLw
around 24th Street in San Francisco the day after
Nicholas was born when he bumped into Perloff. Vi
He was stunned. Shouldn't she be resting? No, she had 1
a few errands to do in the city.
"She probably feels tired a lot," he ended. "But you
would never know."

Carey Perloff, artistic director of A.C.T., possesses
each of these qualities. She has needed every one to

Perloff has worked in New York, where her former
company won an Obie award lor artistic excellence,
and in Los Angeles, where she achieved a Drama-
Logue award for outstanding direction. She studied
112 Classics at Stanford and after graduation attended
Oxford as a lulbright scholar. She has been artistic di
rector of A.C.T. since 1992, has recently opened a glit
teringly restored Geary Theater with her production of
Shakespeare's "The Tempest" and is married with two
young children. She is only 37.
"She is pretty self-confident, she was always good at
everything she did," said her mother, Marjorie Perloff,
an Fnglish professor at Stanford. "And of course she's
opinionated."
\ lind-set
Perloff's definitive opinions and forthright person
ality have both helped her get where she is today and
caused many conflicts in her life.
This was true in childhood — it led to strange con
tradictions in her personality. "I built doll houses, the
size of bookshelves, up to the ceiling," Perloff said. She
created winter scenes, make-believe ice rinks — "any
thing I could imagine," she said. But at the same time
she adamantly refused to believe in Santa Claus, said
i her mother.
\ When she went to Oxford, Perloff's opinions
1 clashed rather more dramatically with those held by
Y university authorities. Perloff was directing "The
»tl Satyricon" by Pretonius, and had printed post-
Mkk card-type invitations to send around the uni
versity. The picture on the postcard, taken
from an original drawing of a Grecian vase,
Ml depicted a naked man having an erection while
J another sat at his feet. The university proctors, in
charge of student discipline, were outraged. Perloff
laughed as she described their reaction. They refused to
allow her to deliver the cards through the internal uni

versity mailing system.
"The publicity was great, said Perloff, eyebrows
raised. At times when she speaks, Perloff seems arro
gant — when asked what kinds of shows she has done
she responded, "Everything, everything." In other mo
ments, she is funny — she described an embarrassing
theatrical moment when her lead actress suddenly dis
appeared off stage and could be heard running to the
dressing room to retrieve a missing prop.
At all times, however, Perloff is composed. She is the
perfect foil to the pandemonium generated by actors,
designers and students in the busy main lobby of the
A.C.T. offices.
C onlli( lincj visions
Her latest clash, however, has had more serious con
sequences. Benny Sato Ambush, a former A.C.T. asso
ciate artistic director, resigned from the company after
five years last April. The reason for his decision, he said
in a telephone interview from the Old Globe Theater in

San Diego, was simple: "Under her leadership, I think
the theater has no social vision, zero, none."
Their relationship began on a flat note.
Perloff, who has the power to hire and fire, began by
asking Ambush and the other two associate directors to
give up their titles. Ambush refused. "Any other title
would have meant, in essence, a demotion," he said.
When Ambush heard that Perloff had approached
Richard Syde, offering him an associate position, Am
bush told her that he would only stay on two condi
tions: that he keep his title and receive the same salary
as Syde. Perloff agreed.
A few months later, Ambush discovered that he was
being paid less than Syde. He confronted Perloff.
"There was hemming and hawing and a lot of ex
cuses," he said, "but she did agree that it shouldn't have
happened." Ambush received sporadic payments over
the next few months, but was only given full reim
bursement when he finally left the company.
The final blow to the relationship came when Am
bush was not given any show to direct in the '95-'96

season. The apparent stum- \ \
bling block was that Perloff and
Ambush, who is African-Ameri- 1
can, had different aesthetic visions
of theater. He wanted to be more
community- and activist-oriented
than she did.
"I think that we have amply demonstrated |
that we are serving a diverse audience, in terms of
age, gender and ethnicity," said Perloff in answer to
Ambush's criticism. To the suggestion that her own clas
sical background may incline her towards Eurocentric
works, she replied: "Great plays stimulate great thought
and great emotion. 1 try to choose plays that will do that."
For Ambush this meant only one thing. "1 was
squeezed out, I became an invisible man," he said. He
resigned.
I lie price ol demanding standards
"1 think that Carey has rubbed some people the
wrong way," said Daniel Cantor, an actor in the A.C.T.
company. "It's inevitable when you take over a theater."
Tact is perhaps not Perloff's strong point.
