# the 						girl & i: more substance than image
## 
### Liz Chien 
Usually, when you think of what a rock
star should look like, the image of a
person clad in ass-tight leather from
head to toe, having 10 ka-zillion piercings, a
rat's nest for hair and a general bad attitude
comes to mind ... all in the name of musi
cal talent.
Fortunately, the girl & i possess the latter
sans all the sketchy characteristics. Com
prised of Stanford alums, Michael Halaas,
25, and Nyree Rabushka, 22, the girl & i are
an up-and-coming force in folk / alterna
tive music as evidenced in their debut
album "H HATCH EM ISTRYCiRAVITY."
However, what makes them so different
from the hundreds of bands out there is that
even though Halaas and Rabushka explore
the same themes as many other alternative
bands (i.e. pain, anger, frustration and

death), they do so with per
spective and honesty. Instead of
simply focusing 011 the negative
aspects as Nine Inch Nails does,
the girl & i also versify hope,
healing and self-respect.
"It's because we're generally
positive people," says Rabush
ka.
The group also delves into a
medley of other topics.
Rabushka explains, "We sing
about rape and suicide, but we
also sing about boys and
strength in relationships like in
'Certain.'"
She admits that some of
their lyrics are hypocritical, but
explains that this forces them to
face reality and live out what
they are singing. For instance,
during a concert at Kimball
Hall, Rabushka was feeling jit
tery and uncomfortable be
cause everyone was staring at
her. But when she started
singing "You cannot be afraid
of this room / You cannot hide
from their stares" in a song,
Rabushka started laughing. "I
realized that that was what they

were supposed to be doing." Staring at her,
that is.
Although Halaas and Rabushka both
enjoy a wide variety of music, the two
find common ground in their love for
folk sounds, the girl & is musical style finds
its roots in the Indigo Girls and Ani diFran
co. In fact, Halaas has opened for diFranco
in concert. "She's just great," says Halaas.
The pair also has a shared love for Tori
Amos, which can be seen in the girl & i's
profound and smartly-written lyrics.
Though many of their songs are in
spired by the relationship between the two,
Fialaas and Rabushka's personal motiva
tion comes from an authentic love for
music and a driving desire to succeed.
They are currently working with veteran
record producer Fioward Johnston, the
producer of Bobby Brown and Bobby Mc-
Ferrin's big albums.

In addition, Johnston is also teaching the
pair about the "business," introducing them
to record industry big-wigs and giving them
case examples of other bands' success sto
ries. Halaas and Rabushka like lohnston's
honesty about success and failure in the
music business.
"One minute he talks about getting this
major label to sign us, and then the next he
says that it may take 10 years," says Rabushka.
The two are more than willing to go the
distance. Rabushka explains, "It's a 100 per
cent dedication thing. You can't do it any
other way.'' They care so much about get
ting their music out that the financial back
ing for this album came mostly out of Ha
laas' and Rabushka's own pockets with ad
ditional support from credit card compa
nies and investors.

To top it off, Halaas and Rabushka are
both working 40 hours a week at their day
jobs plus playing gigs at nights. "It's tough
when you have to play until about one or
two in the morning and then have to get up
to go to work at H a.m.," says Halaas, who
puts his Human Biology degree from Stan
ford to good use at the Neurobiology Lab in
the Stanford Medical Center. Rabushka,
with her economics degree, works at a com
puter firm in Silicon Valley.
Halaas and Rabushka also have to do all
of the band's clerical work, which includes
calling record labels, talking to potential
sponsors, dealing with financial backers and
answering fan mail, (the girl & i give their
mailing and e-mail address on the back of
the album insert.) Rabushka received a
marriage proposal from a guy in Colorado
who really liked the girl & i's music. She had
to decline after discussing it with her
boyfriend.

Halaas and Rabushka's relationship is
one that ranges from respect to stu
pidity to silliness to seriousness. This
is seen in how the two decided on the
group's name. During the brainstorming
session, Halaas came up with the names
Mike & Ny and Ny & 1. In fact, he was re
lentlessly advocating the latter suggestion.
But Rabushka persevered and finally came
up with "the girl & i." "Since Mike always
referred to me as 'the girl,' I scribbled 'the
girl & i' on a piece of paper and handed it to
him." For days afterwards, whenever some
one asked if the two had come up with a
name yet, Halaas would answer enthusiasti
cally in the affirmative and nudge Rabushka
to give the band name. However, Rabushka
could not say the name and would only
shyly write it on a piece of paper.

In this way, they are like siblings, a mar
ried couple and best friends all wrapped
into one relationship. Just a note: they arc
not married or romantically involved. Ha
laas is gay and Rabushka has a boyfriend.
However, Rabushka says, "We share a
checking account, so we must be married.
'Hey mom, I married a gay man. He's big
and strong, and will take good care of me.' "
The interaction between the two is heart
warming, incredible and goes a long way in
explaining the dynamics and flow of their
music. The title of the album is a good sum
mary of their musical relationship:
"HEATCHEMISTRYGRAVITY." It is as if
the two understand each other so well that
the instrumentals and lyrics effortlessly
blend and vibrate together.
"Were able to work together because we
have profound respect for each other," ex
plains Halaas. Rabushka adds, "Mike's the
greatest." This mutual attitude is heard and

felt throughout the album. In fact, they
work so well with one another that within
about a year-and-a-half of deciding to work
together, Halaas and Rabushka released this
13-track album.
Halaas first met Rabushka when they
were students at Stanford. Rabushka
was roommates with one of Halaas's
best friends. When he heard Rabushka sing,
he said, "Wow! I'hat girl can sing!" Howev
er, the two did not work together while at
Stanford. Halaas had a solo career playing
the piano — from which he put out three
albums — and Rabushka was involved with
another band. But the two were friends and
regularly advised each other on personal
and professional dilemmas. In all, Halaas
and Rabushka have known each other for

about six years, according to
Halaas's count, or for about
four years, from Rabushka's
estimation.
So, where do the girl & i go
from here? The group is
currently communicating
with major record labels and
have received excellent feed
back from almost every
one who has listened to
"H EATCI HIM ISTRYGRAVI
TY." These individuals recog
nize that the talent and force
behind the girl & i is substan
tive. For example, I ialaas has
been playing the piano since
he was about five years old
and does a good portion of
the guitar work for this
album, though he just
learned how to play the guitar
last April.
the girl & i are consistent
ly getting the word out about
their musical philosophy and
sound. They have already
done two live performances
via KZSU and the Stanford
Television Network (SCBN),
and will be playing at the

CoHo on Friday. By the way, that's tomor
row.
The striking thing about the girl & i is
that they really care about and believe in
their music. When asked if they would give
up their day jobs for music, they both an
swered, "Yes. In a second." Halaas and
Rabushka also have strong faith in them
selves. Says Rabushka with a determined
look, "We're going to make it. 1 just know it."
And they're going to do it without don
ning skin-tight leather or voluntarily
punching dozens of holes in their bodies.
Now, that's impressive!

him." For days afterwards, whenever some
one asked if the two had come up with a
name yet, Halaas would answer enthusiasti
cally in the affirmative and nudge Rabushka
to give the band name. However, Rabushka
could not say the name and would only
shyly write it on a piece of paper.

In this way, they are like siblings, a mar
ried couple and best friends all wrapped
into one relationship. Just a note: they arc
not married or romantically involved. Ha
laas is gay and Rabushka has a boyfriend.
However, Rabushka says, "We share a
checking account, so we must be married.
'Hey mom, I married a gay man. He's big
and strong, and will take good care of me.' "
The interaction between the two is heart
warming, incredible and goes a long way in
explaining the dynamics and flow of their
music. The title of the album is a good sum
mary of their musical relationship:
"HEATCHEMISTRYGRAVITY." It is as if
the two understand each other so well that
the instrumentals and lyrics effortlessly
blend and vibrate together.
"Were able to work together because we
have profound respect for each other," ex
plains Halaas. Rabushka adds, "Mike's the
greatest." This mutual attitude is heard and

felt throughout the album. In fact, they
work so well with one another that within
about a year-and-a-half of deciding to work
together, Halaas and Rabushka released this
13-track album.
Halaas first met Rabushka when they
were students at Stanford. Rabushka
was roommates with one of Halaas's
best friends. When he heard Rabushka sing,
he said, "Wow! I'hat girl can sing!" Howev
er, the two did not work together while at
Stanford. Halaas had a solo career playing
the piano — from which he put out three
albums — and Rabushka was involved with
another band. But the two were friends and
regularly advised each other on personal
and professional dilemmas. In all, Halaas
and Rabushka have known each other for

about six years, according to
Halaas's count, or for about
four years, from Rabushka's
estimation.
So, where do the girl & i go
from here? The group is
currently communicating
with major record labels and
have received excellent feed
back from almost every
one who has listened to
"H EATCI HIM ISTRYGRAVI
TY." These individuals recog
nize that the talent and force
behind the girl & i is substan
tive. For example, I ialaas has
been playing the piano since
he was about five years old
and does a good portion of
the guitar work for this
album, though he just
learned how to play the guitar
last April.
the girl & i are consistent
ly getting the word out about
their musical philosophy and
sound. They have already
done two live performances
via KZSU and the Stanford
Television Network (SCBN),
and will be playing at the

CoHo on Friday. By the way, that's tomor
row.
The striking thing about the girl & i is
that they really care about and believe in
their music. When asked if they would give
up their day jobs for music, they both an
swered, "Yes. In a second." Halaas and
Rabushka also have strong faith in them
selves. Says Rabushka with a determined
look, "We're going to make it. 1 just know it."
And they're going to do it without don
ning skin-tight leather or voluntarily
punching dozens of holes in their bodies.
Now, that's impressive!

the girl & i
Usually, when you think of what a rock
star should look like, the image of a
person clad in ass-tight leather from
head to toe, having 10 ka-zillion piercings, a
rat's nest for hair and a general bad attitude
comes to mind ... all in the name of musi
cal talent.
Fortunately, the girl & i possess the latter
sans all the sketchy characteristics. Com
prised of Stanford alums, Michael Halaas,
25, and Nyree Rabushka, 22, the girl & i are
an up-and-coming force in folk / alterna
tive music as evidenced in their debut
album "H HATCH EM ISTRYCiRAVITY."
However, what makes them so different
from the hundreds of bands out there is that
even though Halaas and Rabushka explore
the same themes as many other alternative
bands (i.e. pain, anger, frustration and

death), they do so with per
spective and honesty. Instead of
simply focusing 011 the negative
aspects as Nine Inch Nails does,
the girl & i also versify hope,
healing and self-respect.
"It's because we're generally
positive people," says Rabush
ka.
The group also delves into a
medley of other topics.
Rabushka explains, "We sing
about rape and suicide, but we
also sing about boys and
strength in relationships like in
'Certain.'"
She admits that some of
their lyrics are hypocritical, but
explains that this forces them to
face reality and live out what
they are singing. For instance,
during a concert at Kimball
Hall, Rabushka was feeling jit
tery and uncomfortable be
cause everyone was staring at
her. But when she started
singing "You cannot be afraid
of this room / You cannot hide
from their stares" in a song,
Rabushka started laughing. "I
realized that that was what they

were supposed to be doing." Staring at her,
that is.
Although Halaas and Rabushka both
enjoy a wide variety of music, the two
find common ground in their love for
folk sounds, the girl & is musical style finds
its roots in the Indigo Girls and Ani diFran
co. In fact, Halaas has opened for diFranco
in concert. "She's just great," says Halaas.
The pair also has a shared love for Tori
Amos, which can be seen in the girl & i's
profound and smartly-written lyrics.
Though many of their songs are in
spired by the relationship between the two,
Fialaas and Rabushka's personal motiva
tion comes from an authentic love for
music and a driving desire to succeed.
They are currently working with veteran
record producer Fioward Johnston, the
producer of Bobby Brown and Bobby Mc-
Ferrin's big albums.

In addition, Johnston is also teaching the
pair about the "business," introducing them
to record industry big-wigs and giving them
case examples of other bands' success sto
ries. Halaas and Rabushka like lohnston's
honesty about success and failure in the
music business.
"One minute he talks about getting this
major label to sign us, and then the next he
says that it may take 10 years," says Rabushka.
The two are more than willing to go the
distance. Rabushka explains, "It's a 100 per
cent dedication thing. You can't do it any
other way.'' They care so much about get
ting their music out that the financial back
ing for this album came mostly out of Ha
laas' and Rabushka's own pockets with ad
ditional support from credit card compa
nies and investors.

To top it off, Halaas and Rabushka are
both working 40 hours a week at their day
jobs plus playing gigs at nights. "It's tough
when you have to play until about one or
two in the morning and then have to get up
to go to work at H a.m.," says Halaas, who
puts his Human Biology degree from Stan
ford to good use at the Neurobiology Lab in
the Stanford Medical Center. Rabushka,
with her economics degree, works at a com
puter firm in Silicon Valley.
Halaas and Rabushka also have to do all
of the band's clerical work, which includes
calling record labels, talking to potential
sponsors, dealing with financial backers and
answering fan mail, (the girl & i give their
mailing and e-mail address on the back of
the album insert.) Rabushka received a
marriage proposal from a guy in Colorado
who really liked the girl & i's music. She had
to decline after discussing it with her
boyfriend.

Halaas and Rabushka's relationship is
one that ranges from respect to stu
pidity to silliness to seriousness. This
is seen in how the two decided on the
group's name. During the brainstorming
session, Halaas came up with the names
Mike & Ny and Ny & 1. In fact, he was re
lentlessly advocating the latter suggestion.
But Rabushka persevered and finally came
up with "the girl & i." "Since Mike always
referred to me as 'the girl,' I scribbled 'the
girl & i' on a piece of paper and handed it to
him." For days afterwards, whenever some
one asked if the two had come up with a
