## Evvia: the highbrow Hellenic dive 
### Ari Biernoff 
For all the hype
surrounding the
flurry of new
restaurants to open
in Palo Alto, most of
them are hardly
stunning. It's clear
by now that celebri
ty chefs, trendy in
gredients and nice
dinnerware don't
guarantee anything
but a high tab. What
happened to those

old staples, fussiness and inventiveness? Ewia,
which opened last July next to the Aquarius
Theater and has packed full houses since, de
scribes itself as "contemporary Hellenic cui
sine" — a brazen move that provoked me to
suspect a little too much invention. Would it
serve up dishes unheard of in the Mediter
ranean, like salmon on aaigula? Or would it be
a subterfuge for overpriced diner food?
I don't know what suburb you grew up in,
but when I hear of Greek food I immediately
think of gyros wrapped in aluminum foil and
baklava pretty as museum pieces under their
plastic shields but drowned in honey and stale
walnuts. Finesse doesn't come to mind at all.
Ewia, though, manages to take two often
overworked formulas and blend them into an
inventive and professional hybrid. Our dinner
was a series of small delights and light touches
within a sequence of ample and filling dishes
— an encounter with food artistry perhaps
typical on the Peloponnesus but rarely en
countered on this Peninsula.

Ewia is immediately likable. large and
high-ceilinged, the dining area is nicely
parceled by beams, unobtrusive skylights and
wooden mantles. The restaurant's design tries
very hard to please, with copper pots hanging
over the semi-open kitchen, terra cotta and
china arranged on mantles and a whole wall of
glass bottles of oil and vinegar — in soft blues,
pinks, yellows and reds — illuminated from
behind. It resembles a giant nouveau rustic
hearth, if your hearth was color-coordinated
by Restoration Hardware; very pretty and
more than a little affected, with a menu that
invokes Zeus and suggests ambrosia. Atten
tion to decor is nice but a restaurant's success
is made or lost on the plate, and our first
course was a marvelous vindication.
After being seated at one end of an enor
mous plank table, our party of six turned its
sights on wine. Our waiter courteously
steered us away from the lowest-priced Greek
white, which he likened to pine resin. We set
tled on a bottle of Kourtaki ($2l), a dry white,
considerably nicer than turpentine but not
much better than a cheaper chardonnay.
While the Blue Chalk Cafe refugees next to us
erupted into chatter, we sank into our two ap
petizers, Spanakopita ($4.95) and Pikilia
($6.95). Most Greek restaurants handle
spanakopita with all the aplomb of Denny's,
drenching the spinach and cheese mixture in
salt and basting the phyllo exterior with
grease. This spanakopita was instead a marvel
of lightness, both in the flaky phyllo and the
filling nicely flavored with mint. The pikilia,
an assortment platter, delivered a trio of ex
cellent salads. A Melitzanosalata, though de
scribed by our buzz-cut waiter as a "Greek
salsa," turned out to be a smoky eggplant

salad, really a milder version of baba
ghanoush. The Tzatziki offered an appropri
ately sour counterpoint, loaded with very
fresh crisp cucumber and mint. Taramasala
ta, a spread made of cod roe, lemon and oil,
made a superb match for warm triangles of
pita. Other taramasalatas have relied too
much on salt, or have reeked of fish oil, but
Ewia's absolutely shined. The stuffed grape
leaves were lemony, with a perfectly cooked
rice filling, but the leaves themselves were un
expectedly stringy and tough. These mostly
excellent starters, along with sourdough
bread, kept our attention on the food.
The beautiful logic of eating out in a larger
group is getting more tastes. The standout en
tree was the Ami Kapama ($14.50), one of
Ewia's signature lamb dishes. This Greek osso
bucco took a generous lamb shank and
smothered it with a roasted, oniony tomato
baste perched on a mound of orzo. The Kota
Souvlas ($ 12.95), a half free-range roast chick
en with lemon oregano potatoes also scored a
victory. Pungent potatoes, cooked expertly,
complemented a chicken whose well-crisped
skin peeled back to reveal properly moist
meat. The only disappointment among the
entrees was a portabella mushroom salad,
Psito Manitari ($9.50), two meaty portobellos
overdressed in vinegar and buried beneath a
mound of yuppie saiad greens. Vegetarian
dishes are clearly not a top priority in the
kitchen, although an Ewia Pitta ($8.50), a foc
caccia spin-off featuring a rosemary-flavored
olive and eggplant tapenade on pita, made for
a stronger meatless option. Finally, the Xifias
Souvlaki ($14.95), grilled swordfish served
with rice and greens, made up with craft what
it lacked in imagination. The chunks of fish

were meaty and juicy, and the greens — bok
choi and chard-flavored with lemon and what
tasted like fennel — came out crisp enough to
offer just the right resistance to chomping
teeth.
At dessert, Ewia's pastry chefs again proved
their phyllo wizardry. We shared two desserts,
the jazzy Baklava ($4.50) studded with wal
nuts and figs, and the Galaktobouriko ($4.50),
a phyllo custard pie which rekindled thoughts
of brioche gone Mediterranean. One serving
of strong, sludgy Greek Coffee ($2.50), boiled
over sand a few feet away from our table with
the grounds left in, was more than enough for
all of us. We turned the meal into a leisurely
ritual but never felt pressured to hurry. De
spite its crowds Ewia provides well-paced ser
vice.
Ewia takes a cuisine often relegated to fast
food status in America, and lightens it with
California touches without falling into cliche.
Its popularity is well-deserved. It delivered
one of the most stylish and savory meals I've
eaten in Palo Alto, certainly the most ethereal
phyllo pastries I've yet tasted, and a much
more memorable treat than the dozen
mediocre Italian and Californian bistros that
dot downtown.
