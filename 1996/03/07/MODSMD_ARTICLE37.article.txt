# Sit Back (Six One Acts) and enjoy the shows
## 
### Samuel Park 
It's Saturday night, the weather is per
fect for a night out (no rain), and
drama instructor Sonja Kuftinec is at
Prosser Studio — that most black of black
boxes — handing out programs and usher
ing in latecomers during intermission. Judg
ing by her excitement, it seems like there's
nowhere else she'd rather be. No, not even
Paris.
"I'm so proud," says Kuftinec, a filth-year
graduate student.
Six of her students / directors unveiled
one-act shows last weekend, which run
through this Saturday. Some experimental,
others more traditional, all six productions
originated from her class, the Undergradu
ate Directing Workshop.
From what Kuftinec refers to as an "in
tensive two-quarter theatrical laboratory,"
the students/ directors experimented with
form, space and ways of doing theater.
For junior director Brooke Maylie, that
meant going into rehearsals without a for
mal script. Her play, "Life Amidst the Dying
Day Lily," explores everyday life in war-torn
Bosnia, and she wanted the actors to learn
about the people with her, not just memo
rize lines. The script grew out of those ex
plorations.
"I had outlines of scenes," said Maylie,
who drew much of the dialogue from
poems, personal narratives and interviews
with Sarajevans in Palo Alto. She knew
which sorts of ideas to touch upon, using
each scene to explore it. By breaking from
traditional narratives, Maylie wanted to
allow feelings and emotions to be the most
important things.
"Lines are more like symbolic vehicles to
help portray the emotions, as opposed to
having the dialogue propelling the scene,"
Maylie said. There is no plot in her play and
all the scenes work independently of each
other. Each scene makes a point.
Another writer / director, Anjel Van

Slyke, also chose a fragmented structure.
1 ler show, "Recollections of a Fire Insurance
Salesman, or How to Spin an Urban Memo
ry Tale," consists of a series of monologues
by various characters, concerning the mem
ory of a man living in the age of technology
and excess information.
The play grew out of an in-class exercise
exploring creation myths, in which Van
Slyke showed how one person saw the
world.
"But she chose to explore deconstruction
rather than creation myths," Kuftinec said.
In such exercises, Kuftinec wanted her stu
dents to explore different aspects of creating
theater.
"I was trying to get them to think beyond
'actors learning lines' like talking heads,"
said Kuftinec, who emphasized the impor
tance of design and space in communicating
information. "When you stop thinking of
words, you get to an idea."
In fact, for their first exercise last quarter,
she asked the class to "convey a mood" with
out using words. The goal was to think "con
ceptually."
"I encouraged them to use sound and
space and the relationship with the audi
ence," said Kuftinec.
In another exercise, she asked the class to
do a scene incorporating exercises with light
and sound — and limiting dialogue to three
lines.
"I kept telling them, 'audiences today
tend not to hear a lot,' " said Kuftinec. "They
retain less than 50 percent of what they hear.
What they do retain are images and relation
ships."
This influence can be seen in both Van
Slyke's and Maylie's shows. In "Recollec
tions," the progression of an entire love af
fair is told through a series of black-outs,
with the actors' still poses revealing the
changing status of their relationship. There
is no dialogue in that scene. Farly on in
"Lily," a street cleaner casually sweeps off
three dead bodies from the stage with his

broom.
"It's a great example of how images can
convey something in some ways more pow
erful than words," Kuftinec said.
Maylie agrees that there are some things
images can do that words can't. "|They| can
evoke different feelings," she said.
This emphasis on images is also clear in
"Miriam's Flowers," directed hy Stephanie
Ciarcia and written hy Migdalia Cruz. F.ach
image in the play, from the mother lying in a
bathtub to a young woman kneeling in front
of a religious statuette, takes on symbolic
meaningina morbid tale about the effects of
a young boy's death (crushed by a train) on
his sister and mother.
Whether concentrating on images or lan
guage, Kuftinec put the emphasis on origi
nality, on the idea that directing is more
than about interpreting an existing text.
That concept was perfect for senior Jason
Wishnow, who directed a script,
"Pheromonc Biscotti," that he'd written last
summer with senior Kristie I .u Stout. Rather
than figuring out lines written by another
writer, Wishnow had the chance to freely
work with the actors in experimenting with
the text.
"Being the writer, I could say to my actors
at our first rehearsal, 'I wrote this script, but
it doesn't mean it's set in stone. I would like
your opinions on it and your input on how
it can be made even better,' " Wishnow said.
Wishnow credits the cast for coming up
with many of their own gestures, as well as
adding jokes and twists into the script.
"I thought it would be destructive if I re
garded it as 'my' play. I wanted it so that
everyone involved could say this is our play,"
he said.
Billed as a "nightmarish comedy about
waiting, with lots of sex and coffee," the play
is set at a coffee house, where two strangers,
Mondrian (Dan Maidenberg) and Babette
(Nicole Marmon) try to befriend and force a
life / love story out of a reluctant intellectu
al, David (Ilya Druzhnikov).

The other two one-acts are more tradi
tional shows. David Mamet's "Duck Vari
ations explores the friendship between
two old men, Fmil (Drew Rapp), and
George (John Wright). According to the
director, freshman Robert Harris, they are
"sitting by a lake in Central Park dis
cussing the life and habits of the duck . . .
nothing more."
Steve I)ietz s "More Fun than Howling" is
about two women, Lorctta (Kate Lowenhar)
and Lois (Nancy Novitski), both attracted to
lake (John Chakan). According to the direc
tor, freshman Abina Anthony-Davis, Jake is
a "bowling nut extraordinaire," and she was
intrigued by the women's attraction to this
"surprisingly lovable" man.
Unlike the other shows, "More Fun" fo
cuses less on images and more on the acting.
"Abina has been working very closely with
the actors," Kuftinec said. "She is relying
more on them than in the design."
"Duck" is also an actor-oriented show.
With a very simple set (bench, bushes, trash
can), it consists of a scries of conversations
broken by the music of a saxophone player.
"Something that's exciting to me is that
|Harris] moved beyond the script," said
Kuftinec. "The staging is completely his
own. At some points he moves into the
realm of fantasy, but it is very connected to
what he sees the play as being about."
The shows opened last weekend, and play
throughout this week in a noon series. They
close this weekend.

the students/ directors experimented with
form, space and ways of doing theater.
For junior director Brooke Maylie, that
meant going into rehearsals without a for
mal script. Her play, "Life Amidst the Dying
Day Lily," explores everyday life in war-torn
Bosnia, and she wanted the actors to learn
about the people with her, not just memo
rize lines. The script grew out of those ex
plorations.
"I had outlines of scenes," said Maylie,
who drew much of the dialogue from
poems, personal narratives and interviews
with Sarajevans in Palo Alto. She knew
which sorts of ideas to touch upon, using
each scene to explore it. By breaking from
traditional narratives, Maylie wanted to
allow feelings and emotions to be the most
important things.
"Lines are more like symbolic vehicles to
help portray the emotions, as opposed to
having the dialogue propelling the scene,"
Maylie said. There is no plot in her play and
all the scenes work independently of each
other. Each scene makes a point.
Another writer / director, Anjel Van

Slyke, also chose a fragmented structure.
1 ler show, "Recollections of a Fire Insurance
Salesman, or How to Spin an Urban Memo
ry Tale," consists of a series of monologues
by various characters, concerning the mem
ory of a man living in the age of technology
and excess information.
The play grew out of an in-class exercise
exploring creation myths, in which Van
Slyke showed how one person saw the
world.
"But she chose to explore deconstruction
rather than creation myths," Kuftinec said.
In such exercises, Kuftinec wanted her stu
dents to explore different aspects of creating
theater.
"I was trying to get them to think beyond
'actors learning lines' like talking heads,"
said Kuftinec, who emphasized the impor
tance of design and space in communicating
information. "When you stop thinking of
words, you get to an idea."
In fact, for their first exercise last quarter,
she asked the class to "convey a mood" with
out using words. The goal was to think "con
ceptually."
"I encouraged them to use sound and
space and the relationship with the audi
ence," said Kuftinec.
In another exercise, she asked the class to
do a scene incorporating exercises with light
and sound — and limiting dialogue to three
lines.
"I kept telling them, 'audiences today
tend not to hear a lot,' " said Kuftinec. "They
retain less than 50 percent of what they hear.
What they do retain are images and relation
ships."
This influence can be seen in both Van
Slyke's and Maylie's shows. In "Recollec
tions," the progression of an entire love af
fair is told through a series of black-outs,
with the actors' still poses revealing the
changing status of their relationship. There
is no dialogue in that scene. Farly on in
"Lily," a street cleaner casually sweeps off
three dead bodies from the stage with his

broom.
"It's a great example of how images can
convey something in some ways more pow
erful than words," Kuftinec said.
Maylie agrees that there are some things
images can do that words can't. "|They| can
evoke different feelings," she said.
This emphasis on images is also clear in
"Miriam's Flowers," directed hy Stephanie
Ciarcia and written hy Migdalia Cruz. F.ach
image in the play, from the mother lying in a
bathtub to a young woman kneeling in front
of a religious statuette, takes on symbolic
meaningina morbid tale about the effects of
a young boy's death (crushed by a train) on
his sister and mother.
Whether concentrating on images or lan
guage, Kuftinec put the emphasis on origi
nality, on the idea that directing is more
than about interpreting an existing text.
That concept was perfect for senior Jason
Wishnow, who directed a script,
"Pheromonc Biscotti," that he'd written last
summer with senior Kristie I .u Stout. Rather
than figuring out lines written by another
writer, Wishnow had the chance to freely
work with the actors in experimenting with
the text.
"Being the writer, I could say to my actors
at our first rehearsal, 'I wrote this script, but
it doesn't mean it's set in stone. I would like
your opinions on it and your input on how
it can be made even better,' " Wishnow said.
Wishnow credits the cast for coming up
with many of their own gestures, as well as
adding jokes and twists into the script.
"I thought it would be destructive if I re
garded it as 'my' play. I wanted it so that
everyone involved could say this is our play,"
he said.
Billed as a "nightmarish comedy about
waiting, with lots of sex and coffee," the play
is set at a coffee house, where two strangers,
Mondrian (Dan Maidenberg) and Babette
(Nicole Marmon) try to befriend and force a
life / love story out of a reluctant intellectu
al, David (Ilya Druzhnikov).

The other two one-acts are more tradi
tional shows. David Mamet's "Duck Vari
ations explores the friendship between
two old men, Fmil (Drew Rapp), and
George (John Wright). According to the
director, freshman Robert Harris, they are
"sitting by a lake in Central Park dis
cussing the life and habits of the duck . . .
nothing more."
Steve I)ietz s "More Fun than Howling" is
about two women, Lorctta (Kate Lowenhar)
and Lois (Nancy Novitski), both attracted to
lake (John Chakan). According to the direc
tor, freshman Abina Anthony-Davis, Jake is
a "bowling nut extraordinaire," and she was
intrigued by the women's attraction to this
"surprisingly lovable" man.
Unlike the other shows, "More Fun" fo
cuses less on images and more on the acting.
"Abina has been working very closely with
the actors," Kuftinec said. "She is relying
more on them than in the design."
"Duck" is also an actor-oriented show.
With a very simple set (bench, bushes, trash
can), it consists of a scries of conversations
broken by the music of a saxophone player.
"Something that's exciting to me is that
|Harris] moved beyond the script," said
Kuftinec. "The staging is completely his
own. At some points he moves into the
realm of fantasy, but it is very connected to
what he sees the play as being about."
The shows opened last weekend, and play
throughout this week in a noon series. They
close this weekend.

It's Saturday night, the weather is per
fect for a night out (no rain), and
drama instructor Sonja Kuftinec is at
Prosser Studio — that most black of black
boxes — handing out programs and usher
ing in latecomers during intermission. Judg
ing by her excitement, it seems like there's
nowhere else she'd rather be. No, not even
Paris.
"I'm so proud," says Kuftinec, a filth-year
graduate student.
Six of her students / directors unveiled
one-act shows last weekend, which run
through this Saturday. Some experimental,
others more traditional, all six productions
originated from her class, the Undergradu
ate Directing Workshop.

tensive two-quarter theatrical laboratory,"
