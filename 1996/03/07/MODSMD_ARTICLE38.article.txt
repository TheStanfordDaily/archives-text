## 
### Story by Taylor Antrim, Mike Noren Travis Vigil Graphic by Mike Noren 
rn his weekend Toyon 1 lall will be host
to something of a Lollapalooza for
the post-Occam's Razor Stanford
scene. Five bands — Jacob's Purge, Lifskada,
Oddjob, Aunt Beru and Jellyroll — will be
playing one after another on two stages in one
night, all for the sixth annual Battle of the
Bands, brought to you by Phi Kappa Psi fra
ternity and their friends at the I)elta Gamma
sorority.
The night's mission will be to crown a sort
of champion of Stanford's live music scene,
and the basic structure is as follows: bach band
plays a 30- to 45- minute set, and then a panel
of judges — includingone representative from
Intermission, one from k/.SU, one from the
Knoll and one Phi Kappa l'si alum — picks the
winners. The first-place winners then perform
an extra set at Toyon, receive a $300 prize and
get invited to perform live on K/SU; the sec
ond-place winners receive $ 100.

Beer and EANABS will
he served during the show,
but the Battle of the Bands
is much more of a concert
than a party. "We aim to
run out of heer early," says
Battle organizer Ari Muka
mal. "Our main focus is
the bands, not having a
party.
"I think that a lot of
campus bands don't get
the chance to be listened to
for their own sake," he
continues. "I think they
get listened to in a venue
where people aren't actual
ly listening to the music.
So it's our aim to showcase
the talent that's available
on campus and to let peo
ple know that if they go to
a party, they should proba
bly stop and listen to the
band, because it's probably
pretty good."

Oddjob
112 or lack of a better word, Oddjob describe
their sound as "acid jazz." The Ivnd is a six
piece consisting of Sean Forner (drums), Burt
Herman (bass), Matt Johnson (guitar), Tami
Jones (vocals), Joey Kosinski (alto sax) and
Mike Rosenthal (soprano and tenor sax). Per
forming obscure covers of London acid jazz
groups and such standards as lames Brown,
the band is about 50 percent vocal and 50 per
cent instrumental material.
Currently in the process of writing original
songs, Oddjob are still mostly a cover band.
This is mainly due to the fact that the band is
still in its infancy. The band formed and played
its first show at (]asa Italiana last quarter.
I lowever, the members of Oddjob are not
new to the Stanford scene. Forner, Johnson
and Jones all played in the campus band Fez.
But as Johnson points out, "I wouldn't want

people to have the impression that we are ! \v
all over again."
This will be the band's first Battle of the
Bands, but they are optimistic. "Hopefully
we'll play a good set," says Johnson. "I think
we will. I think we're pretty solid at this point.
Our tunes groove really well and they're really
smooth, hut they're sort of more mellow. I
think people will get into that."
Aunt Beru
Charles Cioodan (guitars / vocals), Scott
McKissen (rythym guitar), Mike Rubio
(skins) and Bud Vigil (bass / vocals) comprise
the band Aunt Beru. When asked to describe
their sound, there was silence. Finally Vijjil
managed to pinpoint it as "rock and stuff."
The description seems appropriate for a band
that covers "Eye of the Tiger" and Madonna's
"Material Girl."
They have been together for over a year and

this will be their second Battle of the Bands.
1 lowever, it will be their first with the current
line-up, since some members graduated .it the
end of the last academic year.
Since the reformation, the group has had a
successful stretch highlighted, the band says,
by a memorable gig at a party for McKissen's
brother in "some sort of nut grove, most
probably almonds.
The band plans to play mostly original ma
terial for the performance. The show should
be outstanding since they claim to do good
"rock moves," and we should expect nothing
less from a band who points to Luke Skywalk
er's Aunt, Aunt Beru, as their biggest influ
ence.
Lifskada
The newly named Lifskada had one hell of
a summer. A house in Malibu, celebrity par
ties, nasty drug habits and a freak shooting
don't make for an especially restful vacation,
but the seven members of this campus ska
band have managed to take it in stride. "We
took last quarter off," bassist Paul Resnikoff
says. "The summer was exciting but traumat
ic. It made us focus on our goals."
Lifskada features drummer Tommy Casey,
keyboardist John Redding, the two-man horn
section of Brad Laybourne and Doug Flanzer
on trombone and sax, Pat Enright on guitar,
bassist Resnikoff and finally vocalist Kaney
Crump. While Lifskada have played plenty of
standard punkish ska, the band has now
begun to move in a slightly different direction,
adding jazz improvisation to give the music a
more traditional and organic feel. "We're dif
ferent from other ska bands because we don't
have an encyclopedic knowledge of the genre,"
Resnikoff says. "But we're all into exploring."
Rehab-ed, recovered and ready to play, Lifska
da seem to have their sordid past behind them.
Jacob's Purge
Campus band Jacob's Purge got their name
from a fifth grade friend of singer/ guitarist
Mikel Jollett. This real life Jacob, Jollett says,
"could express in music what he couldn't oth
erwise express." Jacob would give Jollett mixed
tapes from time to time full of dark, emotion
ally cathartic songs. The four members of the
band liked the idea: music as release or purga
tion. Hence the name.
Jollett, drummer James Doozenberg,
bassist Pat Chen, and guitarist (and occasion
al tambourine player) Matt Christensen com
prise the band, a combination which has only
been together since last October. Each mem
ber has played in other bands before, and
Christensen, Doozenberg, and lollett all have
experience songwriting. With only one cover
in their repertoire, the band offers a wide vari
ety of original material. Their sound? lollett
