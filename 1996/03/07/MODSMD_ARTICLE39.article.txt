## LOU REED Set The Twilight Reeling 
### 
Lou Reed has done some pretty interesting
things in his career as underground musi
cian / demigod, and I'm not just talking
about drugs. From dating a transsexual to al
lowing Marky Mark to take a wholesale sam
ple of "Walk on the Wild Side," Reed has re
mained an enigma for three decades now.
Most importantly though, he has served as
a major influence on much of what we hear
on the radio today. U2, the Cowboy Junkies,
RHM and lane's Addiction (just to name a
few) have all done Reed covers — mostly
from his Velvet Underground days.
So with this is mind, it has often been net
essary to forgive him for Ins blunders. I mean,
the Velvet stuff is so powerful that the whole
period from the late '70s through his '8(1 re
birth with the release of "New York tan
probably be overlooked.
However, there is 110 need to ignore his
mostly ignored releases sinte "New York."
After all of his meandering into arena-rotk
and '70s-drug-cool, it's nice to have rock
and-roll Reed back. I lis newest, "Set the Twi
light Reeling," is solid rock and roll and it will
probably go largely unnoticed.
Despite Reed's outstanding rock guitar,
tight backing music and quality production,
his tuneless singing could never be made
playable for the radio. I.ven the album's ultra
catchy, three-chord-anthem "I fookywooky"
with lines like "The traffic's so noisy it's a
shock / Sounds like fireworks or a gun on the

next block / And I want to hookywookv with
you" — is still too quirky to ever get substan
tial rotation on any station.
"Set the Twilight Reeling," jumps and jit
ters through 11 new tunes, at times soaring to
heights far above most of his work and then
plummeting to his late '70s depths. Most no
table on the album are the songs "Sex With
Your Parents (Motherfucker) Part II — a
blatant jab at right wing conservatives — and
the almost sweet "The Proposition' ("Your
foot needs your arm / Your arm needs your
knee / And one of these days I know you will
need me").
With songs like these, Reed once again
proves that he is still able to write some of the
most compelling and innovative rotk
around. This credo is most concisely ex
pressed in the liner notes where Reed writes
"Due to increased dynamic range, raise vol
ume above average. PI.AY IT LOUD."
So, with "Set the Twilight Reeling," Lou
Reed has once again produced a quality rock
and-roll product. Like everything he does,
this album has its mysterious flaws tor sure,
but sometimes you just gotta cut Lou a little
slack because as Reed so aptly states in"The
Proposition:" "Without mystery, what would
writers talk about?"
