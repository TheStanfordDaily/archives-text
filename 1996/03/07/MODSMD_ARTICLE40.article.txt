# THE
						COWBOY JUNKIES
## Lay It Down 
### 
Over the past 10 years, the Cowboy Junkies
have become reliable purveyors of mood. Any
one of their six albums, from the gloriously

dark "The Caution Horses" to
the brave and fine "Black Eyed
Man" will soundtrack your
jags of melancholy, your occa
sional bouts of despondency.
Margo Timmins' voice feels
like a dry breeze, a brush of
warm air, close but not cloy
ing.
Never ambitious, the band
has allowed the formula of
their WBK breakthrough "The
Trinity Session" to survive
more or less intact. Their hall
mark: compelling songwrit
iug underscored by a combi
nation of country, blues and
folk. 1993's "Pale Sun, (Ires
cent Moon" featured an edgy
opener and a Dinosaur Jr.
cover: two of the least com
promising moments in the
band's career, but the other
tracks, delicate lullabies and

ascetic blues ramblers, landed
cold. It seemed the Cowboy Junkies had
grown dissatisfied with strict pigeon-holing.
They seemed to be (lining with breathing
room.
Their newest release, "Lay It Down" seems
to have ignored that problem. There is little
experimentation here; it's a mature album, el
egantly formulaic, occasionally staid. "Some
thing More Besides You" features Michael
Timmins' fine, restless guitar, rising up and
then dropping out of sight with a capricious
sense of timing. "Speaking Confidentially"
warms to a funky bass line, an even danceable
groove. Elsewhere, its the usual. Both ver
sions of "Come Calling" have nice, ringing re
frains. The rootsy, folk-narrative of "Bea's
Song (River Song Trilogy: Part II)" sounds fa
miliar. The trick with the Cowboy Junkies is
to find the point where languid becomes
lethargic, when mellow becomes boring.
"Lonely Sinking Feeling" falls fiat and worn
out while "Musical Key" seems gracefully ex
hausted. Neither will lift your spirits, but one
can make your depression pretty, your torpor
appealing.
The misplaced blues instincts of "Pale Sun,
Crescent Moon" have thankfully been toned
down. There are 110 standouts, 110 unforget
table tracks, but the whole album neverthe
less works. "Lay It Down" features few extra
neous flourishes; occasional strings are its
only extravagance. Overall, the Cowboy
Junkies have produced an agreeable and
decorous piece of work, proving that hedging
a bet can be a good thing from time to time.
