# ROLLERSKATE SKINNY
## Horsedrawn Wishes 
### 
If the alternative mainstream valued vision
over angst, Rollerskate Skinny would be Pearl
Jam. Strange as it sounds, the two groups have
their similarities: Both specialize in supreme
ly self-indulgent rock songs about "the weight
of living" and such, and both somehow pull it
off. But while Pearl Jam merely mastered the
art of recreating classic rock for the '90s,
Rollerskate Skinny forged their own path —
and in the process, discovered their brilliance
and lost their audience.

"Horsedrawn Wishes" is Rollerskate Skin
ny's long-awaited follow-up to their stunning
(though generally ignored) 1994 debut,
"Shoulder Voices," and here the group con
tinues to make wonderfully inventive music
that's probably too ambitious for its own
good.
The vocals and melodies may be reminis
cent of a lot of recent British pop (particular
ly the first Stone Roses album), but Roller
skate Skinny's instrumentation has always
reached for much more. Swirls of noise, un
conventional structures and elaborate or
chestration dominate almost every track to
the point that nobody really cares what the
poor guy is singing about. What results is an
hour full of disorienting beauty and garbled
emoting — either a work of genius or a sonic
mess, depending on your perspective.
"Cradle Burns" might be the group's
catchiest song yet, laying a pleasant verse
chorus-verse structure over a soundscape
that can simultaneously conjure images of a
day at a medieval carnival or a ride in one ot
those ships that the Jetsons drove around in.
Other standout tracks like "Swingboat Yawn
ing," "Man Under Glass" and "Swab the Tem
ples" similarly benefit from the band's appar
ent dislocation from time and space: Roller
skate Skinny never decided on an era, and
their work is better because of it.

Classic
Excellent
Almost, but...
Lacking
Yanni

Still, despite all the great stuff, Rollerskate
Skinny ultimately run into the same problems
as fellow everything-but-the-kitchen-sink
rockers Mercury Rev. Packing so many ideas
into each song, Rollerskate Skinny get lost in
themselves, making the music more interest
ing but the songs less fun. Such musical excess
surely helps to make "Horsedrawn Wishes" a
rich, mind-expanding listen, but 12 tracks of
like-minded overload is a lot to take, and the
listener is often left waiting for a change-up
that never comes.
