## ARCHERS OF LOAF The
						Speed of Cattle FOLK IMPLOSION 
### 
In the fickle and forgetful world of alterna
tive rock, record companies learn to take ad
vantage ofopportunities before they fly by. So
when a band like the Folk Implosion lands a
surprise Buzz Clip from their "Kids" sound
track, or when the Archers of Loaf make a
splash with their excellent "Vee Vee" album, it
only makes sense that labels would try to cash
in with properly timed compilations ot B
sides, out-takes, rare tracks, live tracks and the
like. The Archers' "The Speed of Cattle" and
the self-titled Folk Implosion disc are two
such releases, tasty hits of new old stuff sure to
capitalize on the hands' good luck and whet
fans' appetites for more.
"The Speed of Cattle" reliably delivers an
hour of the Archers' usual punky pop, with all
their hooky guitars, hoarse vocals, bitter lyrics
and trademark energy. As always, the Archers
ol Loaf are consistently likable, but the com
pilation format in this case lacks cohesion and
purpose, making too many songs seem like
leftovers. "Tatyana" and "Powerwalker" are
perfectly fine but unnecessary, while "Don't
Believe the Good News" is just plain dull. Still,
the bursting "What Did You Expect" (origi
nally from the super Merge Records compila
tion "Rows of Teeth") is fantastic, and "Mutes
in the Steeple" is one of the most pleasant

pieces the band has done, with a pretty piano
part and a dandy Thinking Fellers-like stretch
in the middle.
Mixed in with the rare tracks are alternate,
stripped-down versions of older Archers clas
sics like "Web In Front," "Freezing Point" and
"Revenge." The original crack at "Web in
Front" is particularly interesting, offering a
more downcast reading of the usually upbeat
gem, but the others are probably best heard
on other Archers releases, "Icky Mettle" and
"Archers of Loaf vs. the Greatest of All Time."
The Folk Implosion release — featuring
seven songs from their "Palm of My Hand"
single and their "Electric Idiot FP" — sounds
fresher than the Loaf's, if only because we've
heard less of the Folk Implosion to become
accustomed to. The relatively new duo of Se
badoh's Lou Barlow and John Davis haven't
yet fallen into a routine, and so their old
tracks have plenty of new tricks.
"Lo-fi Suicide" is truly an eerie and edgy
bit of guitar pop, while "Mood Swing" and
"Opening Day" have an enthusiasm and pep
that you wouldn't expect from a batch of
tossed-off basement recordings. And if that
weren't enough, "Palm of My 1 land" seems to
be yet another installment in Barlow's ongo
ing series of great masturbation-inspired pop
songs.
