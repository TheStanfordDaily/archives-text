# SHOVELJERK
## Swarm 
### 
What is this? On the cover of Shoveljerk's
debut album, "Swarm," two young girls and
two young boys huddle around a futuristic
lamp, wearing nothing but goggles and girl's
panties. Perversion? Subversion? Moral ero
sion? Well, whatever it is, you'd be wrong to
judge Shoveljerk's new album on the cover's
pedophilic undertones. Formerly known as
Black Happy, this Idaho band puts forth a
solid effort in their debut.
The album opens with "Easy Target," a
song which begins with an ax-grinding riff
reminiscent of White Zombie on their wild
ly popular single "More Human than
Human." But the opening riff on this song
completely misrepresents the character ol
the album. Just as you expect mosh-ready

music, the band quickly slinks down into
soulful, country rock. Rolling, melodic
rhythms; energetic, slow to mid-tempo
beats and consistent vocals resound over
and over.
That's the slight problem with the album,
there's nothing spontaneous or unexpected.
Vou just wait for something random to hap
pen — insane lyrics, gunfire, an ear-piercing

10-minute solo or even Roseanne liarr's
rendition of the national anthem. Unfortu
nately, they just keep playing the same old
tune.
Actually, the guitar lead is quite refresh
ing and creative, but it simply whispers soft
ly in the background, buried under lead vo
calist Haul Hemenway's shrill, heart-pound
ing drums and unimaginative riffs on the
rhythm guitar. When it actually has 20 sec
onds to shine on its own, the guitar solo re
hashes some dull, monotonous musical
phrase.
That's okay though. Uncalled-for antics
might disrupt the bands melodic continu
ity. This steady, rolling feeling conveys a
spirituality which complements the spiri
tual nature of the lyrics. For example, in the
uplifting "Heat vs. Down," Hemcnway
asks, "Life's so overrated .... What good
would that be if your eyes and ears were
opened up?" And after pondering, he an
swers, "Maybe I should stop complaining."
Shoveljerk also makes a huge statement
about media control. In "Looper," Hemcn
way decries TV control by saying, "Hey Mr.
TV /Thank you for the years of mindless
answers / We don't know much about the
gutter / But I'm sure you'll help us." Mean
while, on "Summer," he accuses the paper
boy of bringing only one side of the news,
preventing the masses to see both sides of
the story.
"Swarm" is definitely an admirable debut
effort. Shoveljerk have thoughtful, potent
lyrics and a good grasp of musical structure.
They also have a great guitar lead waiting in
the wings. All they have to do is learn to ex
ploit it. Once they find the one thing that'll
take them over the top, they've got a good
shot at winning the hearts of the main
stream masses.
