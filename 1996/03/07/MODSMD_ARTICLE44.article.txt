# GAVIN FRIDAY
## Shag Tobacco 
### 
Conspicuous musician-friends of rock stars
live a curious existence. While they may indeed
have talent of their own, their lives and work

will be forever over
shadowed by that of
their much more fa
mous associates. On the
other hand, they are al
most guaranteed per
manent employment in
the musical world be
cause there are enough
fanatics to buy every
thing associated with
semi-deified rock stars,
including albums made
by their friends.
Such is the predica
ment faced by Gavin
Friday, good friend of
Bono, lead singer of the
supergroup U2. They
grew up within the
same musical scene in
Dublin and have yet to
part as friends. Indeed,
they collaborated to
gether on a track for the
"In the Name of the Fa
ther" soundtrack a few
years ago.

Because of his interest in experimental pop
music, Friday has enjoyed semi-cult status
within the extreme U2 community ever since
their shift to that genre with "Achtung Baby"
in 1991.
With his newest album, "Shag Tobacco,"
Friday is making one more attempt to break
out from behind U2's shadow, and if the
worlds pop audience had any imagination, he
would surely succeed.
The album is dense and textured, filled
with tight rhythms and flowing melodies.
Possessing a special gift for instrumentation,
Friday often drops a baritone sax and bass
clarinet into the mix, giving his music a time
less quality.
Friday's vocals suggest a curious cross be
tween Peter Gabriel and Lou Reed. Essential
ly, he talks melodically and sings narratively,
giving the album both a confessional realism
and a lyrical beauty.
Further, almost every track resonates with
musical creativity. "Angel" fuses an organic
bass line into an otherwise delicately beautiful
ballad, creating extremely provocative results.
"Little Black Dress" opens with a ripe sax
hook which soon inverts itself to wonderfully
claustrophobic results.
Still, one can't help but somewhat associate
Friday with U2. (Indeed, Bono and The Edge
both sing backing vocals on "Little Black
Dress.") However, Friday seems to be bitterly
aware of this fact. On "My Twentieth Century,"
he sings "My friends are famous ... But who
am I to criticize? My pointing finger backfires"
Whether or not Friday has learned to ac
cept his role as sidekick to a supergroup,
"Shag Tobacco" deserves significant attention
on its own merits. Indeed, if one had to chose
between this album and U2's latest, Gavin Fri
day would undoubtedly come out on top.
