## Down Periscope 
### 
i Hollywood loves a formula, especially if it
translates into box office bucks.
Take a military officer who gets the job done
but is despised by the top brass, give him a
motley crew of rejects and delinquents, and
put them all together in a situation where they
must swim or sink. Somehow, everything will
work out in the end.
Well, formulas can be a good thing (look at
what it's done for Coca Cola), and "Down
Periscope" uses it to its full advantage.
Kelsey Crammer, erstwhile known as
Frasier Crane on "Cheers" and "Frasier,"
plays Lt. Commander Thomas Dodge, an ir
reverent hut brilliant second officer that has
been up lor promotion three times, only to
be stonewalled by the more traditional mem
bers of the Navy Brass.
In a move to get 1 )odge off their backs and
into a desk job, the traditionalists compromise
and agree to give him a command, but instead

of getting the nuclear sub he had been trained
to run, Dodge gets a rusty diesel tub that has
not seen action since Cerhard was student
teaching over at Berkeley. Dubbed the U.S.S.
Stingray in the film, she is actually the U.S.S.
Pampanito, a war museum located near Fish
erman's Wharf.
As if giving Dodge a "museum" for a com
mand was not enough to wound his pride, the
Navy brass "hand pick" a crew of misfits and
delinquents to serve under him. Oh yes, it's a
model of diversity that would make even the
Office of Admissions blanche. From a profes
sional gambler and wacky sonar officer to a col
lege basketball star who was the reason why the
gambler lost his shirt, it is a motley crew from
hell.
"I need a tetanus shot just looking at it. I
think the only thing holding it together are the
bird droppings," says a disgusted Rob Schnei
der (from Saturday Night Five) while describ
ing the condition of the sub. Schneider plays
Dodge's executive officer, Ft. Commander
Marty Pascal, and is the kind of charming bu
reaucrat that most people would encounter at

the local I )MV.
A member of the
crew who would make
feminists proud is Lieu
tenant Kmily Lakes,
played by l-auren Holly
of "Dumb and Dumb
er" fame. As the first
woman to serve on a
submarine, she endures
sexual harassment, but
rolls with the punches
and shows the crew she
can carry out the job of
dive officer as well as any
man. In the film at least,
she banishes the idea
that women and seamen
don't mix.

In fact, the entire movie revolves around a
can-do attitude. Ward is given what is per
ceived to be the impossible task of slipping
past the East Coast U.S. naval defenses using
his rickety old sub. It's a case of the underdog
vs. the big had boys, with predictable results.

But then again, watching how these guys out
wit the best navy in the world is half the fun in
the movie.
I liked "Down Periscope." While it
stretched the limits of logic, overall it was an
enjoyable feel-good experience.
