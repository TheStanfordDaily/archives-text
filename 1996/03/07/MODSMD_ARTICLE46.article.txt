One of Anne Frank's friends said: "Cod knows every
thing. Anne knows everything better."
Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Docu
mentary, Jon Blair's "Anne Frank Remembered" seems
to know everything about Anne. It was created to com
memorate the s()th anniversary of the Holocaust in
1995. With the help of the Anne Frank House, Blair as
sembles a heartbreaking history of "Hitler's most fa
mous victim."
Eloquently narrated by Kenneth Branagh, the film
spans Anne's early childhood in Frankfurt, her sanctuary
in Amsterdam as well as her concentration camp years in
Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. However, the film contin
ues after her death, following Otto Frank back to Ams
terdam. Blair uses modern footage of the Neo-Nazi
movement and even a Nelson Mandela reading of Anne's
diary.
Blair characterizes Anne as the "just plain naughty"
yet typical teenage girl. She loves movie characters — es
pecially Rin Tin Tin — hangs pictures of Hollywood
stars and the English royalty on her walls, even fights
with her mom. Glenn Close reads excerpts from Anne's
diary. At first, Close's voice does not fit the youthful
Anne. However, as the film progresses, her mature voice

bccomes tragically appropriate. If Anne had lived, she
would be older than Close. But Anne will remain a
teenage girl forever.
The film is full of photos, interviews with friends and
family, and even a moving-picture clip of Anne at a
neighbor's wedding. All of the remembrances are
poignant. Miep (lies, one of the women who helped hide
the Franks, is able to recount the years she helped smug
gle food into the Franks' home with the grace and clarity
of a trained actress. Her tearful first meeting with Peter
Pfeffer, the son of Fritz Pfeffer who hid with the Franks,
is full of pauses and thanks in both German and Fnglish.
Blair lets the speakers take their time, letting their stories
gradually play out.
Two months after Gies' and Pfeffer's meeting, the film
reveals that Pfeffer died of cancer. Watching the docu
mentary makes one realize that time is precious. In ten
years, this documentary would undoubtedly capture less
faces. Sadly, many may no longer be with us.
Otto Frank, who passed away in 19H0, once said that
he did not really know his Anne while she was alive, only
after reading her diary. He wanted Anne's message to be
a universal one against racism, religious intolerance and
genocide. Blair reminds us not to forget.
"Anne Frank Remembered" is a well-made documen
tary that is very difficult to watch. It is, however, worth
the time, tears and self-reflection. Blair has created a
masterpiece of priceless memories that will educate and
bring life to the textbook writings of the Holocaust.
