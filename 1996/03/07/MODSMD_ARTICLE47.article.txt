# Rumble in the Bronx
## 
### 
When have karate movies ever been any
good? Although "Rumble in the Bronx" breaks
away from the repulsive bad-ass formula set by
Jean-Claude Van I)amme and Stephen Segal —
there are no bombs and no bed scenes in this
film — it's still a bad movie.
It's really too bad that Jackie Chan, martial
arts movie champ in the Far East, couldn't have
done something with a bit more substance. The
kung fu in the movie is actually quite thrilling
to watch — it's very evident that he's been
trained in the real thing. Unfortunately, it is the
only thing of interest in this action-packed flop.
There's not much of a plot in this film. Basi
cally, it's just a series of action scenes loosely
strung together by the story of Keung (Chan), an
out-to-lunch but well-intentioned tourist from
Hong Kong, who comes to visit his uncle, grocery

store owner Mr. ('.hu (Bill Tung). He ends up get
ting in a squabble with members of a pick-pock
eting motorcycle gang, and eventually becomes
entangled with big-time diamond thieves.
The movie is supposed to be a comedy, and
members of the gung-ho audience laughed
hysterically at the mediocre jokes. "Rumble in
the Bronx" is definitely more silly than sus
penseful, but lacks any true humor.
Throughout the movie, Chan maintains the
good-guy outlook, always helping everyone
from the crippled neighbor to the bad guys who
are trying to get him ("Don't ever come here, I'll
beat you up each time — watch your step"). In
termittently, he throws in fortune cookie phi
losophy ("Don't let your situation change you,
change it").
1 Respite Chan's overall modesty, his film un
abashedly displays lots of skin, both his own
beautiful physique and that of a bikini-dad
stripper. Yet Chan wins his brawls not because
of his bodily brawn, but because of his brain.

He's clever and quick, which makes his moves
quite appealing, even to non-violent types.
lust as Chan is an uncanny hero in his jeans
and sneakers, the cinematography is unlike
that of glamorized, sleek American movies.
The obvious editing cuts and English dubbing
set it apart from the usual standard. Its nice
that this unpretentious movie, perhaps an un
intentional spoof, doesn't take itself too seri
ously.
The best part of the movie was clearly the very
end, when they show real clips of the filming,
proving that Chan does all his own stunts. Here
Chan truly shines and his natural charm is at its
best—smiling genuinely even after breaking his
ankle, one of many casualties in the production.
For action movie enthusiasts, the quality of
the stunts will probably be enough to excite.
Hut for anyone who is looking for something
more than strong kicks and weak slapstick,
you'll be greatly disappointed.
