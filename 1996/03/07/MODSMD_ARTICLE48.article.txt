## If Lucy Fell 
### 
If Only We Could Think Of A Better End
ing.
Cute and witty, "If Lucy Fell" lacks the one
factor that would make it complete: a cute
and witty finale. Written and directed by Eric
Schaeffer ("My Life's in Turnaround"), who
plays lovesick painter/voyeur Joe, the film is
peppered with sharp and quirky scenes and
dialogue that nevertheless cannot save the
ending.
Lucy and Joe, best friends and roommates
since college, have a pact — if they don't find
love before Lucy's 30th birthday, they will
jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. Lucy (Sarah
Jessica Parker) has been stringing along Dick
for over two years, but her "hug test" pre
vents him from ever being christened her
Boyfriend. Joe (Eric Schaeffer) is obsessed
with Jane (Elle Macpherson), the mysterious
woman who lives across the street. As Death
Pact Day looms near, Lucy and loe push each
other to finally seek true love.
Sarah Jessica Parker is pcrfect as the aloof
and somewhat neurotic Lucy — "Would you
drink my spit?" — who offers an unusual
form of therapy to her equally unusual pa

tients. Elle Macpherson offers a solid and
subtle portrayal of Barbie-like Jane, especial
ly tender while being painfully blunt. Ben
Stiller's ("Reality Bites") dread-locked
Bwick, a popular painter and Lucy's latest
love interest, is a treat to watch, mumbling
and painting with Hans and Franz-like assis
tants.
Schaeffer has woven together a host of hi
larious idiosyncratic elements into "If Lucy
Fell" — Joe's relationship with the wheel
chair bound man outside the convenience
store, his morning run through Central Park,
Lucy's date who spends an eternity in the
bathroom, even a surprise appearance by the
world's most famous convenience store
clerks. However, even the strong acting and
offbeat humor cannot compensate for the
predictable and cliched climax. After failing
in each of their relationships, Lucy and Joe
don't jump off the Brooklyn Bridge, they —
you guessed it — realize their love for each
other. Lucy's epiphany in the ridiculous talk
out-loud-to-herself monologue is symbolic
of the apparent desperation to resolve the
otherwise clever plot.
As a romantic comedy, "If Lucy Fell" is
just that — it's romantic, and it's funny. But
it's not much else.
