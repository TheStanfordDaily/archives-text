## Kristie Lü Stout Wooed by an action flick 
### 
Last week, I went koo koo for John Woo.
Moi — a pacifist undergraduate fe
male into feathery caresses on the
nape, an enthusiast of Redon's pastel sighs
on paper and a subscriber of existential un
derstatement 'n' unbearably light narratives
— went absosmurfly koo koo lor John
Woos classic shoot-em-up thriller, "A New
Tomorrow."
The Jlick is so bloody its hemorrhoidal.
But rather than convulse in disgust (as I
did during that filmic homage of I iannibal
Letter) or downright leave the theater (as 1
did during the final scene of l.arry Clark's
tantrum-of-a-movie, "KIDS"), I stayed put.
I watched. 1 absorbed. I punched the air and
yelled "Heeeee Haw!"
I reall yreall yrea 11 y liked it.
Granted, my mother banned me from
watching "The Incredible Hulk," "Mam
mal" and "Little House on the Prairie" as a
child to shield me from their presumed vi
olent content (everyone knows how sinis
ter that Michael Landon character is).
Nevertheless, my bloodthirst for
banglbang! movies manifested itself last

Thursday night in Cubberly Theater as I
watched John Woo's classic and heaved for
more.
But it wasn't the mere bloodshed that or
anged my carrot. It was the heavy-handed
grandeur of it a 11... the exaggerated frater
nal embraces between Mark and Ho, the
monsoon of sweat on Kit's brow, the gar
gantuan ocean-side inferno that toasts the
end of the movie. It was the hyper-inflated
props ami over-realized expressions that set
my aorta pumping faster than a polka.
Like opera, "A Better Tomorrow" not
only captures the primitive drives of hu
mankind — thanatos, fraternal eros, sixtv
caliber gunatos — but heightens it. Sibling
rivalry turns into a life-threatening duel,
heterosexual male companionship turns
into a gripping aJmost-love affair and a man
with a gun turns into a killing machine who
plugs away a litter of lackeys in a single
round of fire.
Sledgehammer could only wish he had it
this good.
Like a wheel of stinking roquefort, the
movie gropes for your attention and nabs it.

Fven the so-called "detached" members of
the audience can't ignore the stench of John
Woo. The salty pools of sweat, the musky
perspiration of a dozen gangsters during
their final collective exhale, the metallic
tinge of burnt blood ... it's hard to overlook
their pungent presence. (And amazing to
think that their presence was realized with
out the assistance of smell-o-vision or filmic
scratch-and-sniff.)
In John Woo's cinematic landscape,
gangsters and gunsters alike die with a
bang!, not a murmur. Likewise, when men
are under pressure, they don't merely per
spire. They leak gallons of body juices
through their deep manhole pores. When
Mark gets beat up — he's not just roughed
up a bit, given a boo-boo strip and dis
missed — he's pulped into ground chuck.
When Kit gets mad, he throws a fitful per
formance comparable to a Juliette Lewis on
a triple dose of PCP. When an intruder's in
the house to kill Kit's old man, it takes a
combination of a few gunshots, hearty
punches, multiple blows to the stomach, a
vase cracked over the head and an ample

tide of'boiling water thrown in the face to fi
nally restrain the bastard.
Indeedy, Woo's characters live hard, fall
hard and (better than Demi's honey-bunch
es-of-oats) die hard.
Why did 1 take delight in seeing the oper
atic Hoods of blood and betrayal last week?
Perhaps it's because I am locked away in the
parlor room of society, Stanford University
— a place where the only blood flood 1 see is
an occasional blood drive and the only be
trayal dramas I see played out involve the
Draw, rush or e-mail frivolities. Due to the
banality of Stanford life, due to the lack of
adrenal-enhancing action here on the so
porific green pastures of Stanford U„ I em
braced John Woo and eagerly lapped up his
cinematic carnage.
but rarely am I the carnivorous
cinephile. Last week, John Woo adequately
filled my quota for celluloid violence. Al
though I won't be able todigest "The Killer"
or "Broken Arrow" until the next eclipse, 1
anxiously await an evening of light kisses,
pastel doodling and light Woody Allen
comedies before the next sunrise.
