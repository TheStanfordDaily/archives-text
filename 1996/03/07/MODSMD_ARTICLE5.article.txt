# KAs score $300K trust, sort of
## Large bequest will help pay off debts — once it comes 
### Sara Southern Staff writer 
The Stanford Kappa Alpha chapter has a gift of
$300,000 from the William Roy Williamson Trust
"waiting in the wings," said Chris Burns, a local at
torney serving as one of the fraternity's alumni ad
visers.
When the fraternity will actually see the money,
however, is uncertain. "It had been determined at
trial court that the trust would be liquidated and the
money would go out to the beneficiaries," Burns
said. "But the trustee has since filed a notice of ap
peal in an effort to postpone the trust's liquidation.
Chapter president Robert Volkel said the money
was "obviously a nice surprise" and he hopes that by
the end of year the fraternity "will either have re
ceived the money or at least have a date for its liqui
dation."
When the fraternity receives the gift, it will first

take care of some "small, pending debts," Volkel
said, adding that "all other details regarding how
the money will be spent have yet to be determined."
The KAs lost their house — located at 664 Lomi
ta Drive — last spring after a large portion of frater
nity members graduated, leaving the chapter with
out the number of members necessary to remain
housed.
If the fraternity gains a required minimum of
pledges this year, Volkel said, its contract with the
University will allow members to move back into the
house next year.
"I'm very optimistic about Rush this spring,"
Volkel said. "I'm confident we'll meet the numbers
required to get our house back."
Burns, who said he is not "professionally in
volved" in the issue, could not provide the name of
the trustee, allowing only that it was a bank.
Pasadena attorney Sandra
Murphey — who would represent
the KA chapter should litigation
become necessary — declined to
comment.
The appeal to postpone the
trust's liquidation was filed on
Feb. 29. The trustee is "charged
with carrying out the intent of
the trust itself," Burns said. He
added that the contention of the
trustee was that a current liqui
dation of the trust was not
Williamson's "intent."
Although the appeal may suc
ceed in postponing the liquida
tion of the trust, the money will
inevitably reach the KAs at some
point in the future, Burns said. "I
am not familiar with the terms of
the trust," Burns said. "I do
know, however, that the fraterni

ty will eventually receive the
sum. I just don't know when."
Among the other beneficiaries
named in the Williamson Trust
are the KA chapter at University
of Arizona and the American
Cancer Society. Tom Harrison, a
KA alumni representative, said
as far as he knew, "the chapter in
Arizona will receive $1.2 million,
although I'm not absolutely posi
tive."
"It's my understanding that
Williamson was an individual
who apparently attended several
different schools," Harrison said.
"That's why the trust has been
split up between several KA chap
ters at different universities, al
though I don't believe Williamson
ever attended Stanford." Harri
son did not, however, know which
other KA chapters are beneficia
ries of the trust.
Burns said the case "has been
actively litigated and will proba
bly continue to be."
