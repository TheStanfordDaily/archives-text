# Quad plans: parking wanted
## 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Details on the design and timetable for the new
Science and Engineering Quad were discussed at a
public forum yesterday, although audience members
seemed more concerned about the disruption caused
by construction and the loss of parking spaces.
Speaking before a full Hewlett-Packard Auditori
um, contractors and University officials detailed
plans for the new quad, which calls for construction
of three new buildings on Serra Mall opposite the
William Gates Computer Science Building and an
annex to the McCullough Building, as well as a large
landscaped area on the present site of the Applied
Electronics Lab, the Electronics Research Lab and
the Physics Tank. The Sequoia Building will be de
molished and the Varian Parking Lot will be elimi
nated to make room for the new structure.

The planned elimination of the Varian lot will re
sult in the loss of 135 parking spaces. Julia Freeman,
manager of Transportation Programs, said the site of
the Varian lot will be fenced off after Commencement
this year and the nearest parking alternatives will be
at the Medical Center, at the Oval, on Lomita Mall
and at Parking Structures 1 and 2. No new space will
be added anywhere on the west side of campus.
Some of those spaces will be designated to accom
modate holders of the higher-priced permits current
ly required to use high-priority parking facilities
such as Varian.
Freeman said the University has several plans to
"lure people out of their cars," including increasing
Marguerite service by adding two routes starting on
the west side of campus, one going to Governor's Cor
ner and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and
another to the south part of Es
condido Village and the California
Avenue CalTrain station. There
are also indefinite plans to extend
partial shuttle service to nights
and weekends.
In addition, Freeman said
1,000 bicycle parking spaces will
be constructed in the area of the

new quad, including several cov
ered "bike corrals."
But the audience remained ex
tremely concerned about the loss
of so many parking spaces.
In response to a questioner
who said that it would be impossi
ble for her to get from her car to
her office in the rain without get
ting wet, Freeman acknowledged
that access would be more diffi
cult for cars.
She suggested that "Stanford is
becoming a city rather than a sub

urb," and the idea of the construc
tion is to have new attractive
buildings in landscaped settings
and that "automobiles don't mix
with that."
Another audience member,
frustrated by the lack of parking,
said he would personally pay for
500 parking spaces if the Universi
ty would guarantee him they
would remain free.
Another major concern was dis
ruption during construction of the
new buildings. Freeman said the

major roads will remain open at
least to bicycle traffic, but it would
be difficult to get from the Varian
Lab to Serra Mall, the Gates
Building and the Gilbert Biologi
cal Sciences Building, which now
requires simply crossing the Vari
an parking lot.
Freeman was one of several
presenters at the forum. Others
included John Moyer of Lehrer
McGovern Bovis Inc., a construc
tion management firm which is
assisting in the work. Moyer

showed a series of slides illus
trating what the plan will look
like at various stages of comple
tion.
The buildings on Serra Mall
will be a new statistics building, a
Regional Teaching Facility to re
place the Physics Tank and a new
building for the Electrical Engi
neering Department.
Moyer said construction will
begin on the statistics building
and the Regional Teaching Facili
ty this summer and on the electri

cal engineering building in the
summer of 1997, with the whole
project to be finished by Novem
ber 1998. Moyer said the Univer
sity "will be holding forums regu
larly" at every stage of the
process.
David Neuman, the University
architect, stressed that the new
buildings "are in the character of
Stanford" and will be built of ma
terials such as limestone that will
make for colors similar to that of
the Gates Building.
