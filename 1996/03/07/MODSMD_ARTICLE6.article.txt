Details on the design and timetable for the new
Science and Engineering Quad were discussed at a
public forum yesterday, although audience members
seemed more concerned about the disruption caused
by construction and the loss of parking spaces.
Speaking before a full Hewlett-Packard Auditori
um, contractors and University officials detailed
plans for the new quad, which calls for construction
of three new buildings on Serra Mall opposite the
William Gates Computer Science Building and an
annex to the McCullough Building, as well as a large
landscaped area on the present site of the Applied
Electronics Lab, the Electronics Research Lab and
the Physics Tank. The Sequoia Building will be de
molished and the Varian Parking Lot will be elimi

The planned elimination of the Varian lot will re
sult in the loss of 135 parking spaces. Julia Freeman,
manager of Transportation Programs, said the site of
the Varian lot will be fenced off after Commencement
this year and the nearest parking alternatives will be
at the Medical Center, at the Oval, on Lomita Mall
and at Parking Structures 1 and 2. No new space will
be added anywhere on the west side of campus.
Some of those spaces will be designated to accom
modate holders of the higher-priced permits current
ly required to use high-priority parking facilities
such as Varian.
Freeman said the University has several plans to
"lure people out of their cars," including increasing
Marguerite service by adding two routes starting on
the west side of campus, one going to Governor's Cor
ner and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and
