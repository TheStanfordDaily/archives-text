## Video details life on the Farm 
### Tracy Jan Contributing writer 
For some freshmen, Orienta
tion week is the first time they ever
set foot on the Farm. Due to dis
tance and expense, they simply
cannot visit campus before en
rolling.
Prospective Stanford students
who live too far away to visit now
have another option. Christopher
Klass, a 28-year-old entrepreneur,
has developed a series of 41 video
tapes, titled "The Klass Report,"
detailing campus life, off-campus
housing and mass transit options.
"Gone are the days where you
can go to a decent college close to
home," Klass said. "Although kids
are applying to more and more
schools farther and farther away,
families are using the same selec
tion means from 40 years ago."
For students making their se
lection today, Klass' 30-minute
video offers clear campus and facil
ities shots, as well as scenes from
San Francisco, University Avenue,
the foothills and some off-campus
apartments.
The students featured in the
video made many positive com
ments about the University. Klass
said his film crew stopped students
randomly in White Plaza last

spring to obtain candid interviews.
"It is much more fair if we just
ask the average person his impres
sion of his school. We want to know
what it is like to actually live and
be a student at Stanford," Klass
said.
Melissa Mills, a sophomore fea
tured in the video, said she was

stopped by a cameraman and in
terviewer who said he was filming
a video for his personal use. "It was
a gorgeous day. They said that this
is a video to give students an idea of
what it is like to be at Stanford,"
Mills said.

Christopher Klass' campus-tour video tapes will give prospective
freshmen and other new students the chance to visit Memorial
Church and other Farm landmarks from their living rooms.
