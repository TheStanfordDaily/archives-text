## Video details life on the Farm 
### Tracy Jan Contributing writer 
For some freshmen, Orienta
tion week is the first time they ever
set foot on the Farm. Due to dis
tance and expense, they simply
cannot visit campus before en
rolling.
Prospective Stanford students
who live too far away to visit now
have another option. Christopher
Klass, a 28-year-old entrepreneur,
has developed a series of 41 video
tapes, titled "The Klass Report,"
detailing campus life, off-campus
housing and mass transit options.
"Gone are the days where you
can go to a decent college close to
home," Klass said. "Although kids
are applying to more and more
schools farther and farther away,
families are using the same selec
tion means from 40 years ago."
For students making their se
lection today, Klass' 30-minute
video offers clear campus and facil
ities shots, as well as scenes from
San Francisco, University Avenue,
the foothills and some off-campus
apartments.
The students featured in the
video made many positive com
ments about the University. Klass
said his film crew stopped students
randomly in White Plaza last

spring to obtain candid interviews.
"It is much more fair if we just
ask the average person his impres
sion of his school. We want to know
what it is like to actually live and
be a student at Stanford," Klass
said.
Melissa Mills, a sophomore fea
tured in the video, said she was

stopped by a cameraman and in
terviewer who said he was filming
a video for his personal use. "It was
a gorgeous day. They said that this
is a video to give students an idea of
what it is like to be at Stanford,"
Mills said.

Christopher Klass' campus-tour video tapes will give prospective
freshmen and other new students the chance to visit Memorial
Church and other Farm landmarks from their living rooms.
"They stopped a lot of people.
My friend and I talked pretty can
didly, but they cut the stuff I said
that was a little less favorable, like
the classes are kind of hard," Mills
said of her 15-minute interview. "I
guess they just put in whatever
fit."
"The students interviewed said
a lot of things that were perhaps
true, but the video did not mention
the things that limit you," said
sophomore Aracely Tamayo, who
is not featured in the video but who
has viewed it.
"For example, Palo Alto is a nice
city but the video did not mention
that it closes down early. Also, it
made going to San Francisco sound
really easy," Tamayo said.
"The video does what it claims;
it is certainly not an expos£, for it is

uniformly positive about the cam
pus," said Vivian Barry, an assis
tant dean in the Office of Under
graduate Admissions.
Barry said the difference be
tween Stanford's video and"The
Klass Report" lies in the focus.
"Our video focuses on the acade
mics at Stanford and contains
metaphors that represent a really
good picture of Stanford."
Barry said although the techni
cal quality of "The Klass Report" is
outstanding, the group of students
interviewed was not diverse, nor
was it representative of the stu
dent body in terms of ethnicity and
extracurricular interests. "We
wou Id not use the video in addition
to or instead of our admissions
video," Barry said.
"The video is very misleading
because it kept on showing down
town San Francisco," said Lynn
Moeller, manager of visitor infor
mation. "But if I were a prospec
tive student looking at the video,

I'd get a good sense of the campus
atmosphere."
Moeller also mentioned the lack
of diversity among the students
shown. She said the film crew
should have chosen the students
more carefully. "Seeing the video is
like when people come and visit the
campus. If they do not like their
tour guide, they may not come here
for college," Moeller said.
Klass apologized for the lack of
diversity in the video. "We specifi
cally tried to get as many minority
and foreign students as possible.
Although most universities are
predominantly white, I agree that
everyone should be included, but
that is not always easy to do," Klass
said.
He said the Stanford video is due
to be updated in September, and he
hopes the new version of the video
will feature a wider variety of stu
dents.
More than 15,000 tapes of the
featured schools have been sold

since they went on sale last Novem
ber.
Klass, who claims he was a "vic
tim of the frenzied college selection
process," came up with the idea of
college video tours shortly after he
graduated from Northeastern Uni
versity in Boston, a school which
did not suit his needs, he said.
"Few people have the time,
money or patience to truly ac
quaint themselves with the envi
ronment of each school that inter
ests them. Most end up taking a
leap of faith. Unfortunately, that
faith sometimes proves misguid
ed," Klass said.
However, unlike other people
who make the wrong decision
about where to go to college, Klass
said he is having the opportunity to
re-live the college experience.
"It was absolutely thrilling to
make these videos. College is an ex
citing, transitional time for bloom
ing," Klass said. "I could be a pro
fessional college student."
