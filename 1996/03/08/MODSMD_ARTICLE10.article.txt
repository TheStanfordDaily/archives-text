Stanford University President Gerhard Casper had
earned a reputation tor political reserve. A 1994 New York l imes article singled him out as the embodiment of a new breed
ol university presidents who did not, ami would not, make public statements on national issues like welfare reform, federal
aits funding, or the conflict in Bosnia. He declined to speak on the ami-immigration measure Proposition iB~ with a
reminder that In speaking for, or purporting to speak tor, the institution, one may exercise a coercive effect that constrains
the opportunities of faculty and students to take independent positions according to their personal judgments." So it came
as something as a surprise when, one rainy I ebruarv afternoon in 1996, ( asper allowed himself something ol an indulgence:
"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome vou to the dedication ceremony for the William (iates (Computer
Science Building at Stanford I niversitv. You will he relieved to learn that I word-processed mv remarks using Microsoft
Word. W hen I came to Stanford in 1992, I was enticed b\ the prevailing standard to shift from another program to Word.
I ittle did I know that one dav I would Ix in a position to refer to this episode in m\ education as an indication that even
university presidents occasionally recognize quality and standards — and that at least some lawyers recognize the difference
between a standard and a monopoly.
So 11 was that Stanford's normally staid president managed 111 a few short breaths to lend his endorsement and by his
own logic, the I Iniversity's to a commercial software product and to Microsoft ( orporations side of a searing legal debate
that is tearing at the fundaments of American antitrust law.
I he reason was standing over his head: 1 he William I I. Gates Computer Science Building, for which Microsoft chair
man and CEO Bill Gates had donated $(•> million.
< aspei s departure from propriety can be traced one would hope —to the halo that necessarily surrounds major uni
versity gift donors. Stanford doesn't yet seem prepared to swear allegiance to Microsoft: The "Wintel" platform — Windows
operating system, Intel microprocessor - is still about as rare on campus as a decent parking space, and Residential
( omputing has not seen fit to upgrade from the two-year-old version of Microsoft Word that runs 011 residence cluster
Macintoshes. Yet by erecting the Gates building as the cornerstone of its new science and engineering quadrangle, Stanford
has proven that even .1 pioneering, western university whose history is one of innovation and entrepreneurship is willing to
plow onto the road ahead with (lates as its leader.
In this we are not alone . Gates' book, The Road Ahead has been on the New York 1 imes
bestseller list for 1 weeks with a little dagger indicating that "some bookstores report receiving hulk orders for the book.
A I senet news group, alt.fan.bill-gates, provides a worldwide forum tor discussing the man and his empire though not
all the newsgroup's traffic is flattering or printable. A New York l imes Syndicate column called "Ask Bill gives wide-eyed
readers the software tycoon's answers to the fundamental questions: "1 was blown away by your statement in .1 recent col
umn that you use a 486 laptop computer, and you have a high-speed ISDN telephone network connection at home. I his

Gates is, without question, a businessman and opportunist of the highest caliber, and lie deserves credit as one of the
fust daring lew to recognize and exploit the personal computer revolution. Yet it is dubious vvhethei this qualities him to lead
society into the next century.
Microsoft s strategy since its inception has been to borrow, adapt and popularize ideas, rather than inventing its own.
Windows 9S, the much-hvped upgrade that took the press by storm last summer, did no more than give Wintel adherents
access to features that had been available to users ol other platforms, most notablv the Macintosh platform, for years tot
instance, a "recycling bin' that allowed you to delete files by dragging them onto .111 icon, and a "Start" button that allowed
you to launch applications with a single click.
Meanwhile, drastic miscalculation on the Microsoft campus in Redmond Wash., allowed puny Silicon Vallev startups

Iiki Netscape C ommunicatioiis Corp. to heat Microsoft to the punch in exploiting the potential ol the Internet and World
Wide Web. And today, Microsoft seems to he taking a see no-evil approach to the component software" paradigm that may
urow out ol technologies like ()penDoc and Java, which some hope will tip the scales away from producer-, of large, full-fea
tured software applications toward developers of small highlv specialized software components. It seems that Cates compa
ny will do everything it can to avoid, or quash, new ideas and technologies that threaten us own dominance.
\nti Microsoft mouths have decried this approach toward innovation, and a highly vocal corps has voiced a slew of accu
sations against Microsoft for aliened transgressions of antitrust laws and business ethics. And many fault Mill Cates for being
less than generous with his copious fortune — conservatively estimating (iatess fortune at Sio billion, his $6 million gift to
Stanford amounts to less than one-tenth of 1 percent of lus net worth. Nevertheless, it s clear that whether acceptable or not,
the practices of Cates and his company serve goals no less noble or ignoble than those of any public company fulfilling its
obligation to its shareholders to make as much money as possible within the hounds of the law. But that s all the more
reason to believe that looking for the future of humanity in the Microsoft empire is like looking tor good creme brulec at
McDonald's.
Even ignoring the profit motive behind Microsoft's incursion into the world
order, it s less than clear that what (iates envisions for our technologically blessed future is actually possible or even desir
able. (iates's mind is filled with notions that, like flying cars and moving walkways, seem far-fetched and in the end offer lit
tle more than novelty value to society.
I or instance, The Road Ahead speaks of a "wallet PC" that will not only carry digital cash but will also display photos of
vour kids and, when prompted, will bark directions to the nearest C hinese restaurant that s still open. But theres no indica
tion of how this will make life any more enjoyable, other than putting Zagat out of business.
(iates predicts that technology will enable everyone will become a publisher or content provider, and that artists and
musicians will be able to peddle their wares directly to consumers. I he Internet, (iates says in lus book, has demonstrated
some of the changes that will occur when everyone has access to low-friction distribution and individuals can post messages,
images, or software of their own creation, hvervone, he says, will have access to works that before the revolution stood .1

leries and publishers to package and sell their creations.
I veil it Gates is right and technology effects what lie calls friction-free, unmediated commeice lus claim that all
voices will be able to reach their audiences unimpeded contradicts another of his promises about the new technocracy, (hat
technology, in the form of intelligent agents and screening programs, will alloys individuals to screen out noise and inanity
and extract the precious drops of value from the fire hydrant of the information highyvay. I le even env isions an claboiatc sys
tem whereby individuals will make money by charging their fellow human beings to read their communiques: "If a man
sends sou a $100 message suggesting that he is your long-lost brother, he explains in The hmul Ahead, you might forgiyc

I veryone yv il I be able to reach everyone else, (iates promises, but not to yvorry no one y\ili be able to reach sou. Net

in il and error and social interaction The result: Media companies, advertising agen ies, the very middlemen that the

untelevised technological revolution is supposed to depose, will become more
important than ever.
If current events are anv indication, Bill Gates and the Microsoft
Corporation seem poised to be prime among those middlemen, making a prof
it on every kind of information transaction imaginable. Aside from maintain
ing a near-stranglehold on the personal computer software market, Microsoft
has entered numerous deals with middlemen extraordinaire from Visa to NBC"
to the Internet access provider UUNet technologies. In one particularly eye
brow-raising step, (I a res' Corbis Corporation last year purchased the Bettmann
Archive, one of the worlds largest collections of photographic images.
And its those billions of dollars that will change
hands on the information highway that are the true focus of Gates vision of
the future. Underlying all of Gates' dreams for society is a dystopian picture of
a technocracy where "society" is just another word for "marketplace," where
"communication is synonymous with "commerce and "intellection with
"acquisition. Hveryonc has free time, and they choose to fill it with the vacant
and the titillating.
The grand promise of multimedia, as Gates would have it, is that some
day, you'll Ik- able to bail on a lunch date by attaching a weather map to an e-mail
message: "l unch in the p.irk may not Ix 1 such a great idea, l ook at the forecast.
I'.ven love will be revolutionized, and awkward impediments like romance
and elation will be no more: "Lovers will use special effects to blend some text,
a video clip from an old movie and a favorite song to create .1 personal valentine.
Gates's prophecies betray a genuine fear of the uncertainty inherent in the
human experience. A screen on Ihe Road A head's companion cd-rom allows
readers to click a button to ask Gates, "1 low will students be effected [sic| by
the new technologies?
"1 really envy kids who are growing up today, Gates says, exasperated,
"because of this accessibility to information in an engaging form. Simply pag
ing through the encyclopedia like 1 did, it's so scattered, the information about
one particular branch of science, or what happened in the 16th century, or a
country, and what makes it unique. They're all just mixed together. It makes it
hard to kind of get your mind around it."
The same holds true 111 Gates's vision of the museum of the future, where
the object is to know in advance what you might otherwise have discovered:
"You can walk for hours through the I.ouvre, admiring paintings that are
at best vaguely familiar, but the experience becomes much more interesting
when there is someone knowledgeable walking with you. I "he multimedia doc
ument can play a role of guide, at home or in a museum Exposure to the
reproductions is likely to increase rather than diminish reverence for real art
and encourage more people to get out to museums and galleries.
Gates seems eager to let the children of the future cast off the risk and
serendipity that are so essential to true intellectual inquiry — and unfortu
nately, this dangerous idea is one of the few of Gates prophecies that seems
possible given the current course of technology. We can already purchase
Microsoft Cinemania 96, which a features list says will allow us to see "thou
sands of photo portraits and movie stills, film music clips, insightful articles,
and more, and Microsoft Art Gallery, which allows us to "explore the essence
and considerable substance — of artistic genius by looking at "all 2,000
paintings by type" and "enhance your art awareness with a comprehensive glos
sary."
Of course, the real appeal behind Gates' ideas is not the curtain but the
man behind it: the I larvard University dropout who and turned luck, ingenu
ity and instinct into a $6 billion a year enterprise. I he one who can purchase
vour dreams with his pocket change yet still wears what looks like a five-dollar
haircut and flies coach class (except when the airline bumps him into first for
free — and I bet that never happens). The one who has the chutzpah and the
wherewithal to rent all the helicopters in the area to keep the paparazzi away
from his wedding yet still manages to come off as something of a geek in
speeches and interviews.
The true danger to society is posed not by Gates' obsession with com
merce, but with America's obsession with Gates' obsession. Gates is no
Richelieu seeking power through subterfuge and manipulation: he is forthright
in The Road Ahead about his intentions to make Microsoft a leading money
maker in the information age, and his company makes no apologies for being
brash and ruthless in its pursuit of mammon. But even so, Americans still flock
to hear his speeches and lay down their money to buy a piece of the future —
which, if Gates is correct, will consist mostly of laying down more money.
In a world that measures success in dollars and looks for its future course

from the mind and coffers of an eccentric and ineluctably human computer
industry billionaire, universities like Stanford may be the only institutions
capable of preserving technology as a tool for facilitating rather than debasing
the human endeavors of knowledge, inquiry, interaction and communication,
the only forces willing and able, in the language of Stanford's founding grant,
"to promote the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf of human
ity and civilization."
It may be cause for alarm, then, that at the close of the Gates Buildings
dedication, John Freidenrich, the president of Stanford's Board of Irustees,
handed (iate.s what he said was a key to the building, along with an invitation
to "come back anytime.
Or it may be time to change the locks.
