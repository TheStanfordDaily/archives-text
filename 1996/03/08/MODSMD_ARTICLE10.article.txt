Stanford University President Gerhard Casper had
earned a reputation tor political reserve. A 1994 New York l imes article singled him out as the embodiment of a new breed
ol university presidents who did not, ami would not, make public statements on national issues like welfare reform, federal
aits funding, or the conflict in Bosnia. He declined to speak on the ami-immigration measure Proposition iB~ with a
reminder that In speaking for, or purporting to speak tor, the institution, one may exercise a coercive effect that constrains
the opportunities of faculty and students to take independent positions according to their personal judgments." So it came
as something as a surprise when, one rainy I ebruarv afternoon in 1996, ( asper allowed himself something ol an indulgence:
"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome vou to the dedication ceremony for the William (iates (Computer
Science Building at Stanford I niversitv. You will he relieved to learn that I word-processed mv remarks using Microsoft
Word. W hen I came to Stanford in 1992, I was enticed b\ the prevailing standard to shift from another program to Word.
I ittle did I know that one dav I would Ix in a position to refer to this episode in m\ education as an indication that even
university presidents occasionally recognize quality and standards — and that at least some lawyers recognize the difference
between a standard and a monopoly.
So 11 was that Stanford's normally staid president managed 111 a few short breaths to lend his endorsement and by his
own logic, the I Iniversity's to a commercial software product and to Microsoft ( orporations side of a searing legal debate
that is tearing at the fundaments of American antitrust law.
I he reason was standing over his head: 1 he William I I. Gates Computer Science Building, for which Microsoft chair
man and CEO Bill Gates had donated $(•> million.
< aspei s departure from propriety can be traced one would hope —to the halo that necessarily surrounds major uni
versity gift donors. Stanford doesn't yet seem prepared to swear allegiance to Microsoft: The "Wintel" platform — Windows
operating system, Intel microprocessor - is still about as rare on campus as a decent parking space, and Residential
( omputing has not seen fit to upgrade from the two-year-old version of Microsoft Word that runs 011 residence cluster
Macintoshes. Yet by erecting the Gates building as the cornerstone of its new science and engineering quadrangle, Stanford
has proven that even .1 pioneering, western university whose history is one of innovation and entrepreneurship is willing to
plow onto the road ahead with (lates as its leader.
In this we are not alone . Gates' book, The Road Ahead has been on the New York 1 imes
bestseller list for 1 weeks with a little dagger indicating that "some bookstores report receiving hulk orders for the book.
A I senet news group, alt.fan.bill-gates, provides a worldwide forum tor discussing the man and his empire though not
all the newsgroup's traffic is flattering or printable. A New York l imes Syndicate column called "Ask Bill gives wide-eyed
readers the software tycoon's answers to the fundamental questions: "1 was blown away by your statement in .1 recent col
umn that you use a 486 laptop computer, and you have a high-speed ISDN telephone network connection at home. I his

actually alien spacecraft, or are witnesses merely misperceiving natural, hut unfamiliar events?
Gates is, without question, a businessman and opportunist of the highest caliber, and lie deserves credit as one of the
fust daring lew to recognize and exploit the personal computer revolution. Yet it is dubious vvhethei this qualities him to lead
society into the next century.
Microsoft s strategy since its inception has been to borrow, adapt and popularize ideas, rather than inventing its own.
Windows 9S, the much-hvped upgrade that took the press by storm last summer, did no more than give Wintel adherents
access to features that had been available to users ol other platforms, most notablv the Macintosh platform, for years tot
instance, a "recycling bin' that allowed you to delete files by dragging them onto .111 icon, and a "Start" button that allowed
you to launch applications with a single click.
Meanwhile, drastic miscalculation on the Microsoft campus in Redmond Wash., allowed puny Silicon Vallev startups

Iiki Netscape C ommunicatioiis Corp. to heat Microsoft to the punch in exploiting the potential ol the Internet and World
Wide Web. And today, Microsoft seems to he taking a see no-evil approach to the component software" paradigm that may
urow out ol technologies like ()penDoc and Java, which some hope will tip the scales away from producer-, of large, full-fea
tured software applications toward developers of small highlv specialized software components. It seems that Cates compa
ny will do everything it can to avoid, or quash, new ideas and technologies that threaten us own dominance.
\nti Microsoft mouths have decried this approach toward innovation, and a highly vocal corps has voiced a slew of accu
sations against Microsoft for aliened transgressions of antitrust laws and business ethics. And many fault Mill Cates for being
less than generous with his copious fortune — conservatively estimating (iatess fortune at Sio billion, his $6 million gift to
Stanford amounts to less than one-tenth of 1 percent of lus net worth. Nevertheless, it s clear that whether acceptable or not,
the practices of Cates and his company serve goals no less noble or ignoble than those of any public company fulfilling its
obligation to its shareholders to make as much money as possible within the hounds of the law. But that s all the more
reason to believe that looking for the future of humanity in the Microsoft empire is like looking tor good creme brulec at
McDonald's.
Even ignoring the profit motive behind Microsoft's incursion into the world
order, it s less than clear that what (iates envisions for our technologically blessed future is actually possible or even desir
able. (iates's mind is filled with notions that, like flying cars and moving walkways, seem far-fetched and in the end offer lit
tle more than novelty value to society.
I or instance, The Road Ahead speaks of a "wallet PC" that will not only carry digital cash but will also display photos of
vour kids and, when prompted, will bark directions to the nearest C hinese restaurant that s still open. But theres no indica
tion of how this will make life any more enjoyable, other than putting Zagat out of business.
(iates predicts that technology will enable everyone will become a publisher or content provider, and that artists and
musicians will be able to peddle their wares directly to consumers. I he Internet, (iates says in lus book, has demonstrated
some of the changes that will occur when everyone has access to low-friction distribution and individuals can post messages,
images, or software of their own creation, hvervone, he says, will have access to works that before the revolution stood .1

leries and publishers to package and sell their creations.
I veil it Gates is right and technology effects what lie calls friction-free, unmediated commeice lus claim that all
voices will be able to reach their audiences unimpeded contradicts another of his promises about the new technocracy, (hat
