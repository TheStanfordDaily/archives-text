## Should we worry about the deficit? 
### Paul Krugman 
p
X or most of last year, claims and counter-claims about who had the
better plan to balance the budget dominated American politics. For
the moment the deficit seems to have faded as an issue, but this pause
may offer a good opportunity to sit back and ask some basic ques
tions: Is it necessary ro balance the budget? What harm do budget
deficits do? What are the reasons, if any, to be particularly concerned
about the deficit right now?
( oncerns about the budget deficit are of two kinds. I he most ele
mental concern is simply whether the government will be able to pav
its bills. (jovernments can and do go bankrupt this rarely leads
directly to their collapse, but it does lead to default on their debts, and
such collapse usually brings massive political and economic disruption
in its wake. (Ciovernments have the option of paying their debts by
printing large sums of money, but this is also usually disastrous as
anyone who is familiar with modern Cierman historv can testify).
I he other kind of concern is more subtle. Kven if there is no clear
.mil present danger of government bankruptcy, budget deficits can
harm a national economy, reducing its rate of growth and thus hold
ing down living standards.
l et us begin with the first concern. At first sight it might seem
that a government, like an individual, must on average live within its
means. I cannot borrow everv year for the rest of mv life; whv should
the U.S. government be any different? 1 lowever, the U.S. government
is a bit different from individuals, l or one thing, it has no planned
retirement date nothing is forever, but it is a good guess that the
Federal government will still be around, still honoring its debts, when
every current taxpayer is long gone. Furthermore, the revenue of the
government its tax collections - grow steadily over time, as the
economy grows. (Federal taxes have held steady at about 20 percent of
C iross Domestic Product — (iDI* — tor the last generation).
What this means is that it is perfectly possible for the government
to borrow forever. I hink of the following example: suppose the gov
ernment borrows this year .1 sum that will be repaid with interest out
of the taxes it expects to collect next year. Next year it repays that debt,
but borrows again against the taxes it expects to collect the following
ve.ir; and so on. Now since tax revenues in 1998 will probably be larg
er than in 1997, and tax revenues in 1999 will be larger still, this would
mean that each years debt will be larger than the previous years — in
other words, the government would be running persistent deficit

We can run deficits forever,

forever.

I his example shows that the government need not balance its
budget to be fiscally sound. As long as the government s debt grows
no faster than its revenues, it can run deficits forever. And indeed, bv
this measure the U.S. government did not have .1 serious deficit prob
lem before the u)8os. Although the Federal budget was in the red
every year except one between i960 and 1979, the ratio of debt to
(il)I' fell steadily from sN to percent. After that, things changed
but let s hold off on that for a moment.
Suppose that you are not worried about the solvency of the gov
ernment. I hen why worry about the deficit? The main answer is that
when the government runs a budget deficit it attracts away savings
that could otherwise be used to help the economy grow. Think of it
this way: people first make .1 decision about how much of their
income to save, then decide where to put it. If the government is not
running a deficit, all of th.u savings is available to finance business
investment — factories, research and development, etc.. — which
contribute to the growth of productivity and living standards. When
the government runs a deficit, these funds are instead pulled into
holding of Federal bonds; the roughly $4 trillion of debt the govern
ment has run up since 19X0 mean some $4 trillion less in these pro
ductive investments. I his is an especially serious concern for the
United States, because as a nation we have an unusually low savings
rate — about half that of most other advanced countries. With such

limited savings, we ought not to he diverting a large share of them
into unproductive Federal deht.
V-x ntil a few years ago, economists who warned against the deficit
mainly worried about these economic effects. Most estimates suggest
ed that the deficit was exerting only a modest drag on economic
growth — maybe one tenth of a percentage point each year — but
these things add up over time. Furthermore, if we are disappointed in
U.S. economic performance, we should do everything we can to help
the economy, and eliminating the budget deficit is one of the most
obvious and straightforward tools available. If we don't do that, we
have little excuse for complaining about slow growth. Still, as long as
it is only tin.* economic effects one is worried about, balancing the
budget looks like a worthy project but not a crisis-level issue.
In the last few years, however, many economists — myself includ
ed — have become concerned about the more basic issue: the solven
cy of the US government. Although a government can run deficits
forever, it can do so only if the deficits are not too large; in particular,
debt must not grow faster than the tax base. In fact, however, since
19H0 U.S. debt has been growing far more rapidly than the tax base;
from 34 percent of GDP in 1979 it has grown to more than 70 per
cent today, and the ratio is still rising.
Worse yet, the United States faces what is often referred to as the
"demographic time bomb . After national defense, the two biggest
programs of the Federal government are Social Security and Medicare,
which provide retirement income and medical care to older
Americans. Workers pay into these programs during their earning
years, then receive benefits later. However, the typical person can
expect to receive much more in benefits than he or she paid into the
system. I his was possible in the past because thanks to population
growth there were always more workers paying into the programs
than retired people drawing benefits. In a little over 10 years, howev
er, vast numbers of babv boomers will begin to retire — and the Social
Security and Medicare programs will be in deep trouble, requiring a
bailout from general tax revenue. Such a bailout will be impossible if
the government is still in deficit, and especially if meanwhile it has run
up large new debts. As a matter of sheer fiscal prudence, the U.S.
ought to be making a big effort to get the budget under control now;
the later we wait, the harder it will be, and the greater the danger of
the Federal government simply being unable to meet its obligations.
The case for a balanced budget used to be a somewhat abstract mat
ter, resting on reasonable but not unchallengeable economic theory.
These days, any accountant can tell you that we had better do some
thing soon.
