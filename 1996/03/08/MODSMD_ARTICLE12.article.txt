# A 						new Croatian spring

### Tin Gazivoda 
A
-/id first glance, the city of Zagreb, Croatia seems as placid as a
young couple watching autumn leaves, fully arrayed with colors, gen
tly descend to the ground. The city was struck only twice during the
terrible four-year war in Croatia and Bosnia, and many of the more
unfortunate looked to it as a safe haven. The crowded streets, tradi
tional cable cars and cafes give one the impression of a dynamic
Eastern European town that seems to have dealt well with the transi
tion to a market economy.
What lies underneath the surface is, however, very different:
wounded soldier returning from Vukovar or a 20-year-old friend leav
ing for a faraway battlefield in Bosnia. These powerful images express
the other side of war, where the feelings of despair and loss dominate.
For many, the Dayton Peace Agreement signed late last year was just
another step in a sequence of vague and frustrating responses of the

international community to the war that took place in Croatia and
Bosnia over the past four years. All ot us whose youth has been shaped
by this war share the feeling that somehow the very best years ot our
lives have been taken away — memories lost forever, lour years have
passed since the tanks of the Yugoslav National Army placed under
siege the beautiful cities of Vukovar and Dubrovnik, thus announcing
the beginning of the war. C ultural monuments went up in flames and
people were forced to leave their homes solely on the basis of their
nationality. The experience produced anger and yet it also gave the
people tremendous strength and a prevailing sense of righteousness.
I he status quo reached in Croatia toward the end of 1992 gave the
country a necessary breathing space. Normal daily life was restarted,
at least in Zagreb and the Istrian peninsula. I he other two major
regions of Croatia — Slavonia in the east and Dalmatia in the south
were, however, in a much more difficult situation. Rebel Serb
nationalists gained control over one-third of the country, almost com
pletely cutting of the southern and eastern regions.
As the economy approached a state of paralysis a few well-con
nected war profiteers amassed fortunes .it the expense of the average
citizen. Real wages dropped to the level of 300 DM per month in the
worst days. Ski vacations in Austria or three-week long holidays 011 an
Adriatic island were not to be mentioned. Professors and doctors were
barely able to provide for the bare necessities of life.
For too many people the situation is still much the same today.
I he double-shock of a state of war and the gradual strengthening of
market forces eventually led to the division of society into two basic
groups. Some were able to quickly adjust to the changing environ
ment. The results of their efforts can he seen in the explosion of small
and medium-size businesses in 1993. Small trading companies, cafes
and firms working on licenses from foreign companies spread
throughout the central region. However, these changes allowed the

rise of individuals willing to use any methods necessary to ensure the
success of their enterprise. I he insolence of this nouveau riche class
further angered the mass of the population, which continued to live
on a near subsistence level. I he social friction is reinforced by the fact
that the newly drawn class lines are not indicative of levels of educa
tion or competence.
I he country is further divided along political lines. On the one
hand, the ruling party has grown into a defendant of various hard-line
policies. Its main support is drawn from an unengaged constituency
ol significant size. On the other hand, the democratic opposition has
recorded considerable growth in the numbers of its supporters and its
voice.
At a more humane level, politics appear to lie detached from the
hardships of everyday life. My good friend Blaz, who graduated from
the High School of Economics, completed his studies in a night

school. The experience left him resentful toward the educational sys
tem as a whole. At the age of iX Bla/ decided it was time to start work
ing and accepted a hard job in a small town about 20 miles away from
Zagreb. Always ready for a quick sip of brandy, his temper is out
matched only bv the jokes and comments which naturally slip from
his mouth.
Unlike others, Bla/. avoids the issue of politics. When you
approach him more slowly, edging around a few related topics, it is
possible that Bla/ will speak his mind. Always full of reservations, his
views and to a certain extent his attitude are representative of the posi
tion taken by a majority of the people of Croatia: appalled at the
atrocities of the war and the suddenness of its outbreak, resentful
toward the inequalities it has created and very uncertain about what
the future will bring.
The common belief that the country is approaching a turning
point serves to increase the aforementioned social, political and every

day tensions. Ihe pressure tor
democracy is coming from all
sides — the intellectuals, the
tree press, human rights groups,
the youth and even the Church.
Since the counter-reaction has
been just as strong it is certain
that the struggle will continue
on all levels ol societal life. But

All of us whose youth
HAS BEEN SHAPED BY THE WAR
FEEL THAT SOMEHOW
THE VERY BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES
HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY

personal experience leads me to believe that the "Croatian spring will
come once again in a more powerful and permanent form. Our young
couple will eventually find its way to the main square — it is so close.
