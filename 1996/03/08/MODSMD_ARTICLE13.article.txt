If votive heard just one thing about this new
novel Infinite Jest, you've probably heard that
its Big. But before you go parading lines about
the no-matter of various kinds of Size, let me
assure you that 33-vear-old David Foster
Wallace uses his 1,079 pages very clettlv indeed.
If you've heard anything else, you've prob
ably heard something like: Infinite Jest indicts
Americans compulsion for entertainment; the
book has a maddeningly complex plot involv
ing terrorist conspiracy; it takes place in the
21st century; it'll tell you more about tennis
than vou care to know; it is hilarious; its
Htnnlet, it's Gravity's Rainbow, it's Naked
Lunch; it has really, really long sentences that
might drive you nuts; it's strangely human, or
it's strangely heart-wrenching for something so
mind-boggling.
It you're wandering about in the hype
storm proudly brandishing your old Wallace
paperbacks, this is what you've been waiting
tor: a novel with the infectious humor and
penetrating contemporary-cultural vision of
I he Broom of the System (198-), a novel that
infuses postmodernisms troubled inheritance
with a human soul (as Wallace tried to clo in
"Westward the Course of Umpire lakes Its
Way, from Girl with Curious Hair (1989), and
a novel that's something different altogether.
Whatever you've heard or suspected about
this book is probably more or less right,
because there's a whole lot in those eleven hun
dred pages, and so it's maybe just as significant
what's not in there.
One thing that's not in this book, as some
reviewers have complained, is 1 climax, an
ending, some sort of resolution. 1 he first 1.3
percent of this book takes place in the Year of
( Had (as in trash bags — 'Revenue-enhancing
subsidized time' is the Fed's response to a grave
budgetary pinch, early in Century 21), and in
it we meet Harold Incandenza, our narrator
for the time being and a prodigious mental
power (as in, like, pick a number between one
and something really big, and I lal will recite
for you what's 011 that particular page of the
0.K.D.), whom nobody can tell is a prodi
gious mental power (when he speaks, people
hear not the Latinate polysyllables we hear but
animalistic grunts, and take him for retarded).
During the remaining 98.7 percent of the
book, which takes place one year before the
Year of Glad (Year of the Depend Adult
Undergarment, if you must know), Hal's func
tioning quite normally, and people hear
Latinate polysyllables when he talks. What the
I lell Happened to I lal is foremost among
things unresolved.
You'll learn plenty about Hal: about his

militant-grammarian of a mother, his Nobel
caliber scientist and 'apres-gards' filmmaker of
a father, his wildly disparate brothers (one
birth-defected and one a perverse Don Juan).
You'll even learn about how the U.S. govern
ment turned northern New England into a
toxic landscape out of a horror flick and foist
ed it on Canada; how vengeful Quebecois sep
aratists in wheelchairs are plotting to under
mine the United States, using one of I lals
dad s films — called, get this. Infinite /est — to
turn Americans into catatonic TV-watching
machines. You will not learn what renovated
1 ial's verbal faculties.
Or at least you ? night not. You might how
ever turn right back to the beginning of the
book and re-read for a few minutes until, 10,
there's this little half-sentence there, this smok
ing gun of a phrase, that gives you a real good
idea what happened to Hal, and you thought
it was just verbosity or delirium or something
the first time around. Which is not to say that
you have to read 2,158 pages to "get this novel;
only that the "resolution it offers isn't the kind
of resolution you're used to getting at the ends
of novels. I lere, you get it in the beginning,
the middle, all over the place; and resolutions
bits and pieces together only imply What
I lappened to 1 lal. Wallace, in an essay, once
used a metaphor for television-watching that
(although likelv a little obscure out of context)
is instructive here: it you point something out
to a dog, he wrote, the dog will look only .it
your finger. Infinite Jest may be a very large lin
ger, but its pointing at something way bigger.
A lot of what's brilliant about this novel isn't
even in the novel, but a reader with serious
megabytes of available mental ram can look
into the ether, out in front of the novel's finger,
and see some remarkable, high-resolution res
olution.
As a writer who grew up on postmod
ernism (he's young enough by far to be John
Barth's son), Wallace knows the shortcomings
of language and representational modes at
least as well as he knows TV commercials' jin
gles (and this is .1 man said to take serious sab
baticals in front of the television), lie also
knows the emptiness that comes of writing
about the impossibility of writing. 21st-centu
ry literatures recovery from its 20th-century
death throes, this novel demonstrates, means
trying — with that impossibility, and all of
postmodernisms lessons, in mind — to write
about humanity and values and soul and plat
itudes, so on and so forth; merely to point a
finger at a resolution, or a trite but soulful
notion, and try to keep the language out of the
readers line of vision.
And so it's a whole slew of recovering sub
stance-abusers (110, I/s not just about Hal
Incandenza and Francophone terrorists) who
will likely elicit your sympathy in this novel.
As you bear down and plow into this big
novel, big Don Gately (with a square head he
let friends close elevator doors 011, the story
goes) bears down and plows into sobriety, and

he's got Demerol as close on his heels as
Wallace has the failings of language. With the
same finger-pointing detachment he uses to
indicate a resolution, Wallace'll show you this
hulking ex-burglar plodding through the days
at a halfway house. The pathos of a very large
criminal's painstaking care in the meatloaf he
makes for a houseful of recovering addicts
(who hate the meatloaf. but would never tell
Don) is the more stirring tor its plainness,
unencumbered bv comment, judgment, or
any real linguistic attempt to represent it, the
pathos. Reading Infinite Jest consists largely of
looking very, very intensely at what Dave
Wallace more-or-less-silently points out.
Look at Kate Gompert, a clinically
depressed ex-pot-smoker enduring one of her
lirst aa meetings: "totally by herself at a non
smoking table over bv a window, ignoring her
pale reflection and making little cardboard
tents out of her raffle tickets and moving them
around. 1 his is the only mention of Kate
(iompert in a two-page-long paragraph, sub
ject to being missed during sneezes. But if you 1
read those phrases again, and again, you might
find them becoming a more and more stirring |
image, of melancholy isolation and the mun
dane and microscopic fibers of life; it's the
tiny-ness of these phrases that's stirring, the
phrases own isolation in a long narrative that
has little to do with them (in which Don
Gately assuages cynical drug addicts' fears
about aa). This is perhaps what the literary
trend called Minimalism really ought to have
been: a kind of forbearance, or humility,
which grants a little privacy to those human
essences in whose service literature is made,
some place where no writer dares take her stul
tifying words. And what better place to find
privacy than in an eleven-hundred page novel's
crowd of words, where only the keen ot eye
will even notice the finger pointing at the pale
reflection of Kate Gompert's suicidal face in a
darkened glass.
David Foster Wallace, whose book tour
lately brought him to San Francisco, seems a
surprisingly reserved, even shy person to be the
author of this titanic novel. But Infinite /est is
essentially a soft-spoken book, whose silences
are shockingly pregnant; its true immensity
lies not in its word count, but in the magical
and immense resonance (this book proves the
deep tragedy of that word's loss to cliche) just
a few of Wallace's careful words can produce.
One of the novel's greatest rewards can be the
experience of finding something surprising, in
the depths of yourself, when you espy some
thing in the novel that makes a kind of perfect
and very rare sense that you feel certain only
you understand — when your eyes follow the
trajectory of one outstretched finger, and then
you find yourself pointing too, a part of one of
those great upward-finger-pointing-fests of
groundlings watching something amazing
come screaming across the sky.
