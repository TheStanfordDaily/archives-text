forgetting and elucidating, leaving PT A

having burned off the iSose threaUk,
a circled design dedicating a life *
to it, the mother breast-feeding
during the lecture on R. Lowell,
* #her blouse collar outlining the triangle
of neck shoulder tiny head, I watch
ignoring her recycled observations for this ■
shameful voyeSrism, her stare
cain halfway to the^odium,
other eyes falling on the blades of my shoulders,
my?hother, on my arm, in a hospital
or civic buildmg, stopping at the top
of the stairs and stepped down,
the building so magically empty,
with a back harder than the steps ||
she met, deliberately left, *

and watchtthc water I put on
to boil, pleasantly forgotten are
. . . well, what isn't? whether
the water vvull have boiled before I finish
this, the race is ended more
quickly, we will be drinking tea.
