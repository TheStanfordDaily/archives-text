Why do we love rich people? Its a distinctly American question.
I he most envied in other societies are those of the noblest lineage, the
fairest skin, the highest learning. In the United States, none of that
matters. Instead, the pays the thing: a lew hundred million and a
place on Marthas Vineyard gets you magazine covers and an audience
with the president.
Contrary to the beliefs of some twentysomethings that the cult of
cash emerged in full bloom during the Reagan years, Americas obei
sance to money goes much farther back. F. Scott Fitzgerald staked his
claim to immortality when he drew up the enduring character Jay
(iatsby, for whom money acted like some impervious Gore-Tex parka,
insulating him from the vulgar and profane details of the real world
below.
But there's a difference in our current fascination with wealth. No
longer do we grant the rich their own shimmering, impregnable high
society, eyeing them with equal parts disdain and envy. Instead, we
want them down here, with us, leading us out of the funk of life in
the '90s to some faraway national cocktail party. Where once we
admired rich people for their fancy cars and dogs, or even their busi
ness acumen, today we beseech them to help us in other ways, too —
not by sharing their wealth, alas, but by flaunting it, as their cold hard
claim to leadership and moral authority.
I he tiltrarich are only too willing to oblige: witness the emer
gence of 11. Ross Perot, Steve Forbes and the cover boy of this issue of
|r., Bill Gates. Fo be sure, all have earned and held onto their money

through shrewd business
decisions and not a small
amount of work. But that is
not why so many Americans
consider two of these men fit
for the presidency and the
other damn near permitted to

What seduces us is that the rich
SEEM WILLING TO TOSS AWAY THEIR
MILLIONS CHASING WINDMILLS

take over the world. What seduces us, in the final analysis, is that they
all seem so willing to toss away their millions chasing such windmills.
He must he in it for noble reasons, we tell ourselves. Lookit, he's los
ing money!
We have every reason to be frightened by this trend, especially at
a time when most of the country's wealth resides in precious few
hands and is likely to stay there; when ceos can increase their salary
tenfold by laying off a few thousand workers. We should be alarmed
because rich people's apparent good intentions often mask worldviews
in which everything is a commodity of exchange to be packaged,
bought and sold — and that includes your votes.
For some scary evidence, check out Jim Luh's deconstruction of
Gates on page 6. And while Wild Bill adds millions by the minute,
the federal government is losing them — a real cause for alarm,
according to the "Great Debunker, Economics I'rof. Paul Krugman
(page 8). The sky isn't falling everywhere: In bloodstained Croatia, Tin
Gazivoda reports, the New Year and a peace agreement bring cautious
hopes. And Christopher Hager muses on what just might be this
decades Great American Novel.
Some points of privilege: this is the second issue of Jr., which
means we've been alive for six months, which in the magazine busi
ness is cause tor a minor celebration. We're in a new place (in the mid
dle of your Daily) and in a new big size, but we haven't forgotten our
roots. Which reminds us — if you didn't see our first issue, you can
find it on the World Wide Web, or you can swing by the Daily offices
and pick up a hard copy. While you're at it, let us know how we're
doing. Ask your cat's litter if you have to.
Finally, 1 would be remiss to leave out some misleading misinfor
mation from my last note. In it, I lamented that fewer than 20 per
cent of registered voters cast ballots in the 1994 midterm elections. A
friend corrected me: about 20 percent of eligible voters participated, a
rather normal if depressingly low rate. Like many of those who voted
for the Republicans in 1994, I regret my error.
