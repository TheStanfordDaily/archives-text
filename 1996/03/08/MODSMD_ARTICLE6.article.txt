Claiming his share of virtual anonymity, University
President Gerhard Casper has a secret, unlisted e-mail account
on the Stanford network: holmes@sherlock.stanford.edu.
Although Casper is officially listed as hk.gxc@Forsythe.Stan
ford.edu, fingering the unofficial account reveals that "holmes"
is, "In real life: Mr. Gerhard Casper," — and that he has No

Plan.
Casper's clever cyber
moniker seems to be more
than a mere tribute to Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle's
beloved 19th-century
mystery novels. In select
ing the super sleuth as his
alter ego, Casper seems to
betray a certain pride in
his own stealth.
Students are forgiven
for wondering what's next
for those cocky kids in
Building 10 — possibly
Provost Condoleezza Rice
flaming her way across the
Internet as Alii hat@4l ?
