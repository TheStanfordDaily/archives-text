With sculptures b\ Auguste
Rodin, Alexander ('.alder and Henry
Moore littering campus grounds, vou
might wonder: Where's little I eland?
You won't be able to find him in the
Quad. I ite-si/.e sculptures ot the fam
ily Stanford are currently languishing
in the Bonair Siding maintenance
yard on the east side of campus along
with assorted University vehicles and
maintenance trailers.
1 he group of Figures stood for
years outside the Quad and were later
moved to an area outside Cummings
Art Building. 1 hey stood there until
1978, when an unknown assailant
sawed off Leland Jr.'s thumb.
Growing concerns about the statue's
safety prompted the removal of the
figures to the rather undistinguished
surroundings of the Bonair mainte
nance lot where they still reside
today.
Desolate though it might be, it's
really quite pleasant — quiet, with a
few scattered picnic tables and a large
leafy tree. Perhaps this is a spot worth
considering as an alternative to the Oval
for your next romantic assignation.
