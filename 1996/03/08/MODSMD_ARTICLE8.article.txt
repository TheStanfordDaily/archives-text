# The
						Delt house's pricey toaster

### 
Students returning to Stanford
from overseas campuses this quar
ter could hardly believe their good
luck when they drew into the spa
cious, newly vacated residence for
merly known as the Delt House
on the shores of Lake L.agunita.
And they were more than a little
startled when they learned that the
University had dropped an
astounding $390 011 a "Savory Pop
2-4 Pop Up Toaster for the house.
But imagine their surprise
when Housing and Dining
Services refused residents request
that the toaster be returned for a
cheaper model and the leftover
money used to buy plates and sil
verware for the kitchen, which the
University had left strangely
unstocked. Residents ultimately
forked up the money for spoons
out of their own house dues, leav
ing them a little less jazzed about
their upscale new digs. But you
should try some of that toast.
