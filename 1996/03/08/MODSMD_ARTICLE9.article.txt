## Unlike the Ivies, Stanford never had quotas. But the climate for Jews on campus has been uneasy

It may come as a surprise thai conflict about the ethnic composition
of American colleges and universities did not begin with the advent of
the Civil Rights Movement. 1 ong before the beginning of America's
imbroglio over affirmative action, another debate took place about
just which students were going to compose the entering classes at
1 iarvard, Yale and other prestigious institutions, a debate which also
called into question the purpose and future of higher education. But
the contention was not over the inclusion of Chicanos, Asians or
blacks. Rather, the focus of this fierce debate in the early part of this
century was a group whose story is sometimes ignored in the
American drama of discrimination and diversity —Jews.
In the narrative of American history found in most elementary
school textbooks, Jews appear to have invented the American Dream;
they function as the original model minority. American Jews have
achieved a level of affluence virtually unmatched among other ethnic
minorities in the United States, largely through their success in high
er education. As any Ivy League student knows, Jews have found their
way into the high reaches of academe in extraordinary proportions:
while they make up only 3 percent of the American population, they
compose about one-fifth of the undergraduate population inside the
ivory towers of the Eastern Seaboard. Jews have become an integral
part of American higher education and intellectual life, to the point
where 20th-century American intellectual history is practically indi
visible from American Jewish history.
But the legacy of Jewish involvement in higher education has not
come easily. Members of the post-baby boom generation arc largely
unaware that many major private American colleges and universities
in the first half of the century actively discriminated against Jews in
admissions. In the eyes of University administrators, Jews may have
been white, but they were still fundamentally "different' — while
qualified to navigate the rigors of higher education, they were consid
ered uncouth, unsophisticated and obnoxious. Administrators feared
that too much of the "Jewish presence" in higher education would
undermine the rarefied gentility so assiduously cultivated inside the
wrought-iron gates. Concerned with the rising proportion of Jews in
their student bodies, Ivy League schools imposed quotas limiting the
number of Jewish admits beginning in the 19205.
Such quotas would seem impossible to enforce — after all, you
can t always tell a Jew just by looking at one. And while many Jews
changed their distinctively Eastern European last names, others did
not, and admissions officials were easily able to weed out applicants
with last names like Leibowitz, Eisenstien and Walinsky. I he quotas
were also instituted at a time in American history when it was possi
ble to determine people's ethnicity based on what neighborhood they
lived in and where they went to high school. Anti-Jewish quotas effec
tively limited Jewish enrollment to only those individuals who came
from the "best" families, had gone to the "right"' preparatory schools,
and were seen as able to conform to rather than disrupt the mannerly
environment of the private universities. I he quotas were only quietly
lifted over the course of the 1950s due to growing pubic embarrassment
over the quotas and the sprit of postwar egalitarianism.
hat is the story of Jews at Stanford? While Jews don't have the
recognizable difference of skin color to distinguish them from the rest
of white America, they do have crucial cultural and religious differ
ences that come into play in a campus setting. Yet provisions to
accommodate the needs of Kosher students were not made until 1992,
after repeated agitation by Jewish students to establish a Kosher co-op
and allow Kosher students exemption from mandatory meal plans.
Jewish students also confronted administrative barriers to their reli
gious practices. Jane Stanford stipulated in the Founders Cram that
110 religious services could be conducted at Stanford outside Memorial
Church. In 1965, when a group of Jewish students attempted to con
duct services in an empty room on campus, they were warned to dis
band by University officials. The University only relented when the

next day's Stanford Daily blared, "Jkws barrf.d krom worship on
campus."
Even now, Jewish students occupy a strange and sometimes
uncomfortable niche at Stanford as neither just a "religion" or just an

"ethnicity." When a group

Americans, they were turned down. Allison Schachter, one of the stu
dents who requested the programming, says, "(Assoc. Residential
Educational Director] Ann Porteus told us that she thought Jews were
a people of privilege and didn't need special programs during
Orientation. That's ridiculous — nine times out of 10 Orientation
falls during Rosh 1 lashanah, which marks the most important period
in the Jewish religious calendar. Jews start feeling alienated from this
place right off the bat.
Questions about the place of Jews at Stanford have also arisen
because of the relatively small number of Jews in the student body.
Compared to the formidable Jewish communities at comparable insti
tutions on the East ('oast, the Jewish population at Stanford has fluc
tuated between a scant 10 and 12 percent over the last 20 years. Civen
these figures, as well as recent attention to Jewish quotas at East Coast
colleges, much energy has been devoted — both in the form of stu
dent-generated conspiracy theories as well as scholarly research — to
ascertaining whether anti-Jewish quotas existed at Stanford. Jon
Reider, associate director of undergraduate admissions, attended
Stanford as an undergraduate and says such rumors are nothing new.
"I've been hearing those rumors for the past 30 years, and no one has
ever found any evidence to prove that Stanford had quotas. Stanford
is mentioned only in passing in the few books that have been pub
lished on the anti-Jewish quotas, and their assertions of the existence
of quotas are only based on the convictions of the few Jewish mem
bers of the Stanford community in the '40s and '50s.' Although
Reider.s own research has turned up no evidence of quotas, history is
rarely so simple.
Part of the complexity of Stanford's relationship with American
Jews is due to geography. Stanford has always had a history distinct
from that of Eastern counterparts precisely because it has evolved not
in Connecticut or New York but in California. This has more signifi
cance than the difference between lacrosse and water polo. The Jewish
population of the United States has been historically clustered on the
East Coast: Ellis Island's a lot closer to Brooklyn than to Berkeley.
Even today, the majority of American Jews reside in the Mid-Atlantic
and New England areas of the United States.
Stanford also did not become a "national" university until rela

tively recently and Californians still constitute
almost 50 percent of the applicant pool and about
40 to 45 percent of each Stanford class. During the
first half of the century, the contemporary 1 larvard

applicant from Rhode Island in 1953, regardless of religious affiliation.
That Stanford draws heavily on Californians is nothing unusual.
Around 70 percent of all students at private universities attend college
within 500 miles of their hometown. The pattern is the same every
where — most students at Yale and Princeton are from New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut. The small size of Stanford's Jewish com
munity is in part the result of this provincialism — the hulk
of the American Jewish community is not local.
It would be a mistake to assume that the lack of formal
discriminatory policies against Jews grants Stanford's administrators
