Know the Responsibilities
(a) Third-parts responsibility
A primary responsibility assumed hy students is to discourage violations ol the Honor
Code hy others Various methods arc possible. Moral suasion may be effective. Drawing
attention to a suspected violation may stop it. Initiating physical restraint, such as uppci
hods control holds (hall nelsons, "choke" holds, etc.). is a necessary and obligator
remedy u lien other methods ;ire inappropriate or have tailed. lac tilts members have 11 ke
responsibilities when suspected violations come to their attend)>n Whipping students
with rulers is acceptable — although meter sticks have been found to he more patnlul
and more relevant in today's metric-dominated society.
Know the Temptations
(dl "Procedures thm create temptations to violate lite Honor Code "
Although students arc expected to resist temptations to cheat, the faculty may
nevertheless endeavor to maximize inducements to dishonesty.
Examples of acceptable procedures include the follow ing: failure to give adequate
warning for major papers and/or projects; providing cheat sheets at the exam loom
door, making every answer "A" ; writing exam answers on the blackboard in really,
really big letters and then saying "Hey guys! Don't look here on the blackboard'*!
leaving ollice unlocked with cxatn prominently displayed; posting a "( heater ot~
the Week Award and giving him/her a Dinner tor Iwo at II lornaio ; adhering to
a strict t based curve; ottering more points to students with the numbers ainT
"V" on their Hicks I'asses. and; stringing up "honorable ami conscientious" students
by their toes betore each exam
Such procedures place honorable and conscientious students in a difficult position
and often at a disadvantage.
Know the Consequences
(e) Penalty grading
Under the Legislative and Judicial Charter, students may be penalized for
violations of the Honor Code without notice, hearing, and adjudication, as therein
provided. An instructor may . therefore, lower a student's grade or impose any other
penally, including name-calling, blackmail, caning, electrocution, t Innese water
torture, discmhowelmcnt. immolation, or taping together ol buttocks on the grounds
