David Shields
Remote
In this highly allegorical work, David Shields looks into his own life -
our lives- to reveal the remoteness that has come to circumscribe us
all. America's obsession with beauty, celebrity, and the transmitted
image has overtaken and transformed traditional ideas of American
Culture. David Shields teaches English at the University of Washington.
