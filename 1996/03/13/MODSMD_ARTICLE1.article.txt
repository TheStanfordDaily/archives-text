# Swimmers qualify for Atlanta '96
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
INDIANAPOLIS — After placing four
swimmers on the 1996 United States
Olympic team in the first two nights of com
petition at the U.S. Olympic Team Trials, the
Cardinal has continued to make its presence
known in the fast waters of the Indiana Uni
versity Natatorium.
In the meet's first event last Wednesday,
1995 graduate Jenny Thompson qualified for
the 4 x 100-meter freestyle relay by placing
third in the 100 free in 55.45 seconds. Kurt
Grote (Class of '95) followed Thompson's
swim by putting himself on the U.S. team via
a second-place finish in the 100 breaststroke.
Grote swam to a time of 1:02.03, less than a
tenth of a second behind winner Jeremy Linn
of Tennessee. In the last race of day one, Joe
Hudepohl, who competed for Stanford from
1992 to 1995, gained a spot on the men's 4 x
200 free relay, finishing fourth in the 200
free. Both Thompson and Hudepohl compet
ed at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.
In the 100 and 200 freestyles, the top four
swimmers make the Olympic team. In all

other events, only the first and second place
times qualify.
The co-captain of this year's women's
squad, senior Lisa Jacob, led off day two of
the competition by placing third in the 200
free, clocking 2:00.65. Jacob was touched out
by Trina Jackson for second place by a mere
.03. Sophomore Tom Wilkins, swimming in
his first Olympic Trials, grabbed fifth place in
the 400 individual medley with a personal
best time of 4:23.11.
The championship finals on day three
began with one former Olympic gold-medal
ist qualifying for the 1996 team and ended
with another missing the team by less than a
quarter of a second.

In the women's 400 free, Janet Evans, a
four-time Olympic gold medalist, overtook
her nearest competition in the last 50 meters
to win the race in a time of 4:10.97. At age 24,
Evans, who swam for the Cardinal from 1990
to 1991, qualified for her third Olympic team.
Another 1992 Stanford Olympian, Lea
Loveless (Class of '94) fell short in her bid to
make the Atlanta squad in the 100 back
stroke. Loveless, the American record holder
in the event, finished sixth in 1:02.81. Whit
ney Hedgepeth won the race in 1:01.52, while
14-year-old Beth Botsford grabbed second,
0.07 behind.

Top: Stanford alumnus Kurt Grote celebrates his victory in the 200-meter breastrtroke
race on Sunday. Grote qualified for the 1996 Summer Olympics in both the 100- and 200-
meter breaststroke. Above: Freshman Suzanne Toledo heads for the finish of the 200-
meter breaststroke preliminary.
In the evening's final race, se
nior Ray Carey provided the
Stanford highlight of the night,
racing to second place in the 200
butterfly. Carey's time of
1:57.66 was 0.27 back of winner
Tom Malchow of Michigan and
0.23 faster than the defending
Olympic champion and Ameri
can record holder, Mel Stewart
of Tennessee.
Carey used a furious charge in
the homestretch to overtake
Stewart, a longtime rival.
"I feel good about my last 10
or 15 meters," Carey said. "This
morning I think my third 50 was
slow, so the two things I wanted
to do tonight were pick up the
third 50 and be there with 10 or
15 meters to go to be in a position
to use my strength."
In 1992, Carey finished fourth
in the event, missing the
Olympic team by only seventeen
one-hundredths of a second.
Saturday, the Stanford men
placed another swimmer on the
U.S. Team when 1992 Olympian
Jeff Rouse (Class of *93) placed
second in the 100 backstroke.
Rouse, the world record holder
in the event, was defeated in his
specialty by Tripp Schwenk,
54.94 to 55:15. Rouse was more
than one second slower than his
record time of 53.86.
While Rouse is excited to com
pete in his second Olympic
Games, he expressed frustration
with his performance.
"I don't like losing anytime,
that's never any fun," Rouse
said. "But I think I'm a little
more disappointed in my time. I

expected I could go under 54 sec
onds today. Everything wasn't
there tonight — we'll go back,
look at the tapes and see what I
did wrong. I've been gearing four
years for Atlanta, and I think I'll
be ready this summer."
Rouse's Stanford teammate
Brian Retterer (Class of '94) fin
ished a close third in a time of
55.46.
The rest of the night featured
several swimmers who had al
ready made the Olympic team
adding a second event to their
schedules in Atlanta. Tom Dolan
(400 IM, 400 free), John Piersma
(200 free, 400 free), Amy
VanDyken (100 free, 100 fly)
Angel Martino (100 free, 100 fly)
and Amanda Beard (100, 200
breast) all qualified additional
races.
In Sunday's finals, Grote
started out fast in the 200 breast
and held off the field in the
homestretch to capture Stan
ford's first gold-medal of the
meet.
"I felt like I saw everyone in
the last 50," said Grote, whose
2:14.22 was just ahead of Eric
Wunderlich (2:14.45) and Steve
West (2:14.96). "I thought I saw
people blowing by me on both
sides, but I guess I didn't."
The fast pace Grote set early
came back to haunt all three of
the race's leaders, as they battled
for a spot on the Olympic team.
"There wasn't anything to
make me go faster (on the last
lap)," Grote said. "I didn't have
anything left. I felt like I com
pletely lost my stroke on the last
length. Going into the 100 I was
feeling more tired than I wanted

to, so I was really hoping that I
wasn't going to cash myself in for
the last 50. Fortunately, I built
up a good enough lead that it
didn't hurt me too bad."
Grote's Stanford teammate
and training partner, Tyler May
field, finished fourth in the race
at 2:15.77, almost two-and-a
half seconds faster than his qual
ifying time. For Mayfield, the
swim came on the heels of a dis
appointing seventh-place finish
in the 100 breast on the first
night.
"To me that was the swim of
the meet for our team," said Stan
ford coach and head men's coach
for the Olympic team Skip Ken
ney. "Even though we've had guys
make the Olympic team, I'm so
proud of Tyler. To be able to
bounce back from adversity and
disappointment like that — I told
him, 'You were a real man tonight.
You showed me the courage of a
great human being.'"
In the next event, Summer
Sanders, another former Stan
ford swimmer, fell short in her
bid to qualify for the team in the
200 IM. Sanders won the silver
medal in the event in Barcelona
and is still the American record
holder. Sanders finished far off
the pace set by Allison Wagner
(2:13.71) and Kristine Quance
(2:13.76), touching seventh in
2:18.06, six seconds slower than
her record.
Swimming in the 100 fly,
freshman Matthew Pierce fin
ished 14th with a time of 55.04
after turning in a 54.78 in the
morning prelims. John Hargis of
Aubarn (53.42) and Mark Hen
derson, a Cal graduate (53.51),

went one-two in the champi
onship heat.
Cardinal sprinter Sabir
Muhammad struggled in his pre
liminary heat, and placed 32nd
overall. Although the Atlanta
native was not successful in his
bid to swim in the Olympics in
his hometown, Kenney sees a
bright future for the sophomore.
"We were worried about his
lack of experience and the
amount of pressure he felt and
put on himself, and we saw the
results of that," Kenney said.
"But he is too good — to me, he's
more talented than anyone else
who was in that race last night.
It's just a matter of time."
In Monday's finals session,
15-year-old Brooke Bennett
opened the night by defeating
two-time defending Olympic
gold medalist Evans, winning
the race 8:35.80 to 8:37.65. The
men's 50 free was won by Gary
Hall Jr. (22.27), while David Fox
(22.50) was the runner-up.
Swimming for DeAnza Cuperti
no, Bill Schell (Class of '94)
placed 15th with a time of 23.48.
On Monday, the closest Stan
ford came to adding another
swimmer to the Atlanta team
was Loveless' fourth place finish
in the 200 back. Loveless
(2:14.62) was in contention for
the second-place spot at the
halfway point, but could not
keep pace with 14-year-old Beth
Botsford (2:10.66) and Whitney
Hedgepeth (2:12.10). Loveless
came up short in her bid to be
come a two-time Olympian, after
winning a gold and a bronze in
Barcelona.
The night's final race provid
ed the biggest thrill for the sell
out crowd in the Natatorium, as

Michigan's Dolan threatened the
American record, missing the
mark by 0.09 with a time of
2:00.20. Stanford's Wilkins was
in eighth place halfway through
the race, but the sophomore
turned in the fastest breast
stroke leg to move into fifth
heading into the freestyle, where
he finished at 2:03.59. In the "B"
final, junior Matt Thompson
chased down two competitors in
the final leg to win the heat in
2:05.73 to wind up ninth overall.
On Tuesday, freshman Tate
Blahnik narrowly missed quali
fying for the Olympic team in the
200 back. His time of 2:00.48 was
one second behind the second
place finisher.
Thompson came up just short
in the women's 50 free. She fin
ished third in a time of 25.61,
just 0.38 seconds out of second
place.
" Kenney was pleased with the
performances turned in by the
Cardinal men.
"We've had an outstanding
meet," Kenney said. "No team
ever has a perfect Olympic Trials.
No matter how many people you
put on the team, there's going to
be more people not making the
team. You die for those kids be
cause they've given so much of
their life to swimming and to
Stanford. It's hard, and as soon
as it's over, we have to go right to
the NCAA championships
(March 28-30 in Austin)."
While Olympic women's coach
Richard Quick admitted his Cardi
nal swimmers have not all turned
in the times they had hoped for,
the squad is excited to participate
in what should be a wide-open
team competition at its NCAA
meet March 21-23 in Ann Arbor.

Whether they qualified for the
Olympic Games or not, Kenney
and Quick are proud of the ef
forts put out by Stanford ath
letes here at the Olympic Team
Trials. For those who swam their
way onto the team, the next goal
is to represent the United States
in the 1996 Games and seek gold
in Atlanta.

the competition by placing third in the 200
free, clocking 2:00.65. Jacob was touched out
by Trina Jackson for second place by a mere
.03. Sophomore Tom Wilkins, swimming in
his first Olympic Trials, grabbed fifth place in
the 400 individual medley with a personal
best time of 4:23.11.
The championship finals on day three
began with one former Olympic gold-medal
ist qualifying for the 1996 team and ended
with another missing the team by less than a
quarter of a second.

In the women's 400 free, Janet Evans, a
four-time Olympic gold medalist, overtook
her nearest competition in the last 50 meters
to win the race in a time of 4:10.97. At age 24,
Evans, who swam for the Cardinal from 1990
to 1991, qualified for her third Olympic team.
Another 1992 Stanford Olympian, Lea
Loveless (Class of '94) fell short in her bid to
make the Atlanta squad in the 100 back
stroke. Loveless, the American record holder
in the event, finished sixth in 1:02.81. Whit
ney Hedgepeth won the race in 1:01.52, while
14-year-old Beth Botsford grabbed second,
0.07 behind.

Top: Stanford alumnus Kurt Grote celebrates his victory in the 200-meter breastrtroke
race on Sunday. Grote qualified for the 1996 Summer Olympics in both the 100- and 200-
meter breaststroke. Above: Freshman Suzanne Toledo heads for the finish of the 200-
meter breaststroke preliminary.
In the evening's final race, se
nior Ray Carey provided the
Stanford highlight of the night,
racing to second place in the 200
butterfly. Carey's time of
1:57.66 was 0.27 back of winner
Tom Malchow of Michigan and
0.23 faster than the defending
Olympic champion and Ameri
can record holder, Mel Stewart
of Tennessee.
Carey used a furious charge in
the homestretch to overtake
Stewart, a longtime rival.
"I feel good about my last 10
or 15 meters," Carey said. "This
morning I think my third 50 was
slow, so the two things I wanted
to do tonight were pick up the
third 50 and be there with 10 or
15 meters to go to be in a position
to use my strength."
In 1992, Carey finished fourth
in the event, missing the
Olympic team by only seventeen
one-hundredths of a second.
Saturday, the Stanford men
placed another swimmer on the
U.S. Team when 1992 Olympian
Jeff Rouse (Class of *93) placed
second in the 100 backstroke.
Rouse, the world record holder
in the event, was defeated in his
specialty by Tripp Schwenk,
54.94 to 55:15. Rouse was more
than one second slower than his
record time of 53.86.
While Rouse is excited to com
pete in his second Olympic
Games, he expressed frustration
with his performance.
"I don't like losing anytime,
that's never any fun," Rouse
said. "But I think I'm a little
more disappointed in my time. I

expected I could go under 54 sec
onds today. Everything wasn't
there tonight — we'll go back,
look at the tapes and see what I
did wrong. I've been gearing four
years for Atlanta, and I think I'll
be ready this summer."
Rouse's Stanford teammate
Brian Retterer (Class of '94) fin
ished a close third in a time of
55.46.
The rest of the night featured
several swimmers who had al
ready made the Olympic team
adding a second event to their
schedules in Atlanta. Tom Dolan
(400 IM, 400 free), John Piersma
(200 free, 400 free), Amy
VanDyken (100 free, 100 fly)
Angel Martino (100 free, 100 fly)
and Amanda Beard (100, 200
breast) all qualified additional
races.
In Sunday's finals, Grote
started out fast in the 200 breast
and held off the field in the
homestretch to capture Stan
ford's first gold-medal of the
meet.
"I felt like I saw everyone in
the last 50," said Grote, whose
2:14.22 was just ahead of Eric
Wunderlich (2:14.45) and Steve
West (2:14.96). "I thought I saw
people blowing by me on both
sides, but I guess I didn't."
The fast pace Grote set early
came back to haunt all three of
the race's leaders, as they battled
for a spot on the Olympic team.
"There wasn't anything to
make me go faster (on the last
lap)," Grote said. "I didn't have
anything left. I felt like I com
pletely lost my stroke on the last
length. Going into the 100 I was
feeling more tired than I wanted

to, so I was really hoping that I
wasn't going to cash myself in for
the last 50. Fortunately, I built
up a good enough lead that it
didn't hurt me too bad."
Grote's Stanford teammate
and training partner, Tyler May
field, finished fourth in the race
at 2:15.77, almost two-and-a
half seconds faster than his qual
ifying time. For Mayfield, the
swim came on the heels of a dis
appointing seventh-place finish
in the 100 breast on the first
night.
"To me that was the swim of
the meet for our team," said Stan
ford coach and head men's coach
for the Olympic team Skip Ken
ney. "Even though we've had guys
make the Olympic team, I'm so
proud of Tyler. To be able to
bounce back from adversity and
disappointment like that — I told
him, 'You were a real man tonight.
You showed me the courage of a
great human being.'"
In the next event, Summer
Sanders, another former Stan
ford swimmer, fell short in her
bid to qualify for the team in the
200 IM. Sanders won the silver
medal in the event in Barcelona
and is still the American record
holder. Sanders finished far off
the pace set by Allison Wagner
(2:13.71) and Kristine Quance
(2:13.76), touching seventh in
2:18.06, six seconds slower than
her record.
Swimming in the 100 fly,
freshman Matthew Pierce fin
ished 14th with a time of 55.04
after turning in a 54.78 in the
morning prelims. John Hargis of
Aubarn (53.42) and Mark Hen
derson, a Cal graduate (53.51),

went one-two in the champi
onship heat.
Cardinal sprinter Sabir
Muhammad struggled in his pre
liminary heat, and placed 32nd
overall. Although the Atlanta
native was not successful in his
bid to swim in the Olympics in
his hometown, Kenney sees a
bright future for the sophomore.
"We were worried about his
lack of experience and the
amount of pressure he felt and
put on himself, and we saw the
results of that," Kenney said.
"But he is too good — to me, he's
more talented than anyone else
who was in that race last night.
It's just a matter of time."
In Monday's finals session,
15-year-old Brooke Bennett
opened the night by defeating
two-time defending Olympic
gold medalist Evans, winning
the race 8:35.80 to 8:37.65. The
men's 50 free was won by Gary
Hall Jr. (22.27), while David Fox
(22.50) was the runner-up.
Swimming for DeAnza Cuperti
no, Bill Schell (Class of '94)
placed 15th with a time of 23.48.
On Monday, the closest Stan
ford came to adding another
swimmer to the Atlanta team
was Loveless' fourth place finish
in the 200 back. Loveless
(2:14.62) was in contention for
the second-place spot at the
halfway point, but could not
keep pace with 14-year-old Beth
Botsford (2:10.66) and Whitney
Hedgepeth (2:12.10). Loveless
came up short in her bid to be
come a two-time Olympian, after
winning a gold and a bronze in
Barcelona.
The night's final race provid
ed the biggest thrill for the sell
out crowd in the Natatorium, as

Michigan's Dolan threatened the
American record, missing the
mark by 0.09 with a time of
2:00.20. Stanford's Wilkins was
in eighth place halfway through
the race, but the sophomore
turned in the fastest breast
stroke leg to move into fifth
heading into the freestyle, where
he finished at 2:03.59. In the "B"
final, junior Matt Thompson
chased down two competitors in
the final leg to win the heat in
2:05.73 to wind up ninth overall.
On Tuesday, freshman Tate
Blahnik narrowly missed quali
fying for the Olympic team in the
200 back. His time of 2:00.48 was
one second behind the second
place finisher.
Thompson came up just short
in the women's 50 free. She fin
ished third in a time of 25.61,
just 0.38 seconds out of second
place.
" Kenney was pleased with the
performances turned in by the
Cardinal men.
"We've had an outstanding
meet," Kenney said. "No team
ever has a perfect Olympic Trials.
No matter how many people you
put on the team, there's going to
be more people not making the
team. You die for those kids be
cause they've given so much of
their life to swimming and to
Stanford. It's hard, and as soon
as it's over, we have to go right to
the NCAA championships
(March 28-30 in Austin)."
While Olympic women's coach
Richard Quick admitted his Cardi
nal swimmers have not all turned
in the times they had hoped for,
the squad is excited to participate
in what should be a wide-open
team competition at its NCAA
meet March 21-23 in Ann Arbor.

Whether they qualified for the
Olympic Games or not, Kenney
and Quick are proud of the ef
forts put out by Stanford ath
letes here at the Olympic Team
Trials. For those who swam their
way onto the team, the next goal
is to represent the United States
in the 1996 Games and seek gold
in Atlanta.

INDIANAPOLIS — After placing four
swimmers on the 1996 United States
Olympic team in the first two nights of com
petition at the U.S. Olympic Team Trials, the
Cardinal has continued to make its presence
known in the fast waters of the Indiana Uni
versity Natatorium.
In the meet's first event last Wednesday,
1995 graduate Jenny Thompson qualified for
the 4 x 100-meter freestyle relay by placing
third in the 100 free in 55.45 seconds. Kurt
Grote (Class of '95) followed Thompson's
swim by putting himself on the U.S. team via
a second-place finish in the 100 breaststroke.
Grote swam to a time of 1:02.03, less than a
tenth of a second behind winner Jeremy Linn
of Tennessee. In the last race of day one, Joe
Hudepohl, who competed for Stanford from
1992 to 1995, gained a spot on the men's 4 x
200 free relay, finishing fourth in the 200
free. Both Thompson and Hudepohl compet
ed at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.
In the 100 and 200 freestyles, the top four
swimmers make the Olympic team. In all

other events, only the first and second place
times qualify.
The co-captain of this year's women's
squad, senior Lisa Jacob, led off day two of
the competition by placing third in the 200
free, clocking 2:00.65. Jacob was touched out

Top: Stanford alumnus Kurt Grote celebrates his victory in the 200-meter breastrtroke
race on Sunday. Grote qualified for the 1996 Summer Olympics in both the 100- and 200-
meter breaststroke. Above: Freshman Suzanne Toledo heads for the finish of the 200-
meter breaststroke preliminary.
In the evening's final race, se
nior Ray Carey provided the
Stanford highlight of the night,
racing to second place in the 200
butterfly. Carey's time of
1:57.66 was 0.27 back of winner
Tom Malchow of Michigan and
0.23 faster than the defending
Olympic champion and Ameri
can record holder, Mel Stewart
of Tennessee.
Carey used a furious charge in
the homestretch to overtake
Stewart, a longtime rival.
"I feel good about my last 10
or 15 meters," Carey said. "This
morning I think my third 50 was
slow, so the two things I wanted
to do tonight were pick up the
third 50 and be there with 10 or
15 meters to go to be in a position
to use my strength."
In 1992, Carey finished fourth
in the event, missing the
Olympic team by only seventeen
one-hundredths of a second.
Saturday, the Stanford men
placed another swimmer on the
U.S. Team when 1992 Olympian
Jeff Rouse (Class of *93) placed
second in the 100 backstroke.
Rouse, the world record holder
in the event, was defeated in his
specialty by Tripp Schwenk,
54.94 to 55:15. Rouse was more
than one second slower than his
record time of 53.86.
While Rouse is excited to com
pete in his second Olympic
Games, he expressed frustration
with his performance.
"I don't like losing anytime,
that's never any fun," Rouse
said. "But I think I'm a little
more disappointed in my time. I

expected I could go under 54 sec
onds today. Everything wasn't
there tonight — we'll go back,
look at the tapes and see what I
did wrong. I've been gearing four
years for Atlanta, and I think I'll
be ready this summer."
Rouse's Stanford teammate
Brian Retterer (Class of '94) fin
ished a close third in a time of
55.46.
The rest of the night featured
several swimmers who had al
ready made the Olympic team
adding a second event to their
schedules in Atlanta. Tom Dolan
(400 IM, 400 free), John Piersma
(200 free, 400 free), Amy
VanDyken (100 free, 100 fly)
Angel Martino (100 free, 100 fly)
and Amanda Beard (100, 200
breast) all qualified additional
races.
In Sunday's finals, Grote
started out fast in the 200 breast
and held off the field in the
homestretch to capture Stan
ford's first gold-medal of the
meet.
"I felt like I saw everyone in
the last 50," said Grote, whose
2:14.22 was just ahead of Eric
Wunderlich (2:14.45) and Steve
West (2:14.96). "I thought I saw
people blowing by me on both
sides, but I guess I didn't."
The fast pace Grote set early
came back to haunt all three of
the race's leaders, as they battled
for a spot on the Olympic team.
"There wasn't anything to
make me go faster (on the last
lap)," Grote said. "I didn't have
anything left. I felt like I com
pletely lost my stroke on the last
length. Going into the 100 I was
feeling more tired than I wanted

to, so I was really hoping that I
wasn't going to cash myself in for
the last 50. Fortunately, I built
up a good enough lead that it
didn't hurt me too bad."
Grote's Stanford teammate
and training partner, Tyler May
field, finished fourth in the race
at 2:15.77, almost two-and-a
half seconds faster than his qual
ifying time. For Mayfield, the
swim came on the heels of a dis
appointing seventh-place finish
in the 100 breast on the first
night.
"To me that was the swim of
the meet for our team," said Stan
ford coach and head men's coach
for the Olympic team Skip Ken
ney. "Even though we've had guys
make the Olympic team, I'm so
proud of Tyler. To be able to
bounce back from adversity and
disappointment like that — I told
him, 'You were a real man tonight.
You showed me the courage of a
great human being.'"
In the next event, Summer
Sanders, another former Stan
ford swimmer, fell short in her
bid to qualify for the team in the
200 IM. Sanders won the silver
medal in the event in Barcelona
and is still the American record
holder. Sanders finished far off
the pace set by Allison Wagner
(2:13.71) and Kristine Quance
(2:13.76), touching seventh in
2:18.06, six seconds slower than
her record.
Swimming in the 100 fly,
freshman Matthew Pierce fin
ished 14th with a time of 55.04
after turning in a 54.78 in the
morning prelims. John Hargis of
Aubarn (53.42) and Mark Hen
derson, a Cal graduate (53.51),

went one-two in the champi
onship heat.
Cardinal sprinter Sabir
Muhammad struggled in his pre
liminary heat, and placed 32nd
overall. Although the Atlanta
native was not successful in his
bid to swim in the Olympics in
his hometown, Kenney sees a
bright future for the sophomore.
"We were worried about his
lack of experience and the
amount of pressure he felt and
put on himself, and we saw the
results of that," Kenney said.
"But he is too good — to me, he's
more talented than anyone else
who was in that race last night.
It's just a matter of time."
In Monday's finals session,
15-year-old Brooke Bennett
opened the night by defeating
two-time defending Olympic
gold medalist Evans, winning
the race 8:35.80 to 8:37.65. The
men's 50 free was won by Gary
Hall Jr. (22.27), while David Fox
(22.50) was the runner-up.
Swimming for DeAnza Cuperti
no, Bill Schell (Class of '94)
placed 15th with a time of 23.48.
On Monday, the closest Stan
ford came to adding another
swimmer to the Atlanta team
was Loveless' fourth place finish
in the 200 back. Loveless
(2:14.62) was in contention for
the second-place spot at the
halfway point, but could not
keep pace with 14-year-old Beth
Botsford (2:10.66) and Whitney
Hedgepeth (2:12.10). Loveless
came up short in her bid to be
come a two-time Olympian, after
winning a gold and a bronze in
Barcelona.
The night's final race provid
ed the biggest thrill for the sell
out crowd in the Natatorium, as

Michigan's Dolan threatened the
American record, missing the
mark by 0.09 with a time of
2:00.20. Stanford's Wilkins was
in eighth place halfway through
the race, but the sophomore
turned in the fastest breast
stroke leg to move into fifth
heading into the freestyle, where
he finished at 2:03.59. In the "B"
final, junior Matt Thompson
chased down two competitors in
the final leg to win the heat in
2:05.73 to wind up ninth overall.
On Tuesday, freshman Tate
Blahnik narrowly missed quali
fying for the Olympic team in the
200 back. His time of 2:00.48 was
one second behind the second
place finisher.
Thompson came up just short
in the women's 50 free. She fin
ished third in a time of 25.61,
just 0.38 seconds out of second
place.
" Kenney was pleased with the
performances turned in by the
Cardinal men.
"We've had an outstanding
meet," Kenney said. "No team
ever has a perfect Olympic Trials.
No matter how many people you
put on the team, there's going to
be more people not making the
team. You die for those kids be
cause they've given so much of
their life to swimming and to
Stanford. It's hard, and as soon
as it's over, we have to go right to
the NCAA championships
(March 28-30 in Austin)."
While Olympic women's coach
Richard Quick admitted his Cardi
nal swimmers have not all turned
in the times they had hoped for,
the squad is excited to participate
in what should be a wide-open
team competition at its NCAA
meet March 21-23 in Ann Arbor.

Whether they qualified for the
Olympic Games or not, Kenney
and Quick are proud of the ef
forts put out by Stanford ath
letes here at the Olympic Team
Trials. For those who swam their
way onto the team, the next goal
is to represent the United States
in the 1996 Games and seek gold
in Atlanta.

the final, where she finished third to earn a spot on the Olympic relay team.
INDIANAPOLIS — After placing four
swimmers on the 1996 United States
Olympic team in the first two nights of com
petition at the U.S. Olympic Team Trials, the
Cardinal has continued to make its presence
known in the fast waters of the Indiana Uni
versity Natatorium.
In the meet's first event last Wednesday,
1995 graduate Jenny Thompson qualified for
the 4 x 100-meter freestyle relay by placing
third in the 100 free in 55.45 seconds. Kurt
Grote (Class of '95) followed Thompson's
swim by putting himself on the U.S. team via
a second-place finish in the 100 breaststroke.
Grote swam to a time of 1:02.03, less than a
tenth of a second behind winner Jeremy Linn
of Tennessee. In the last race of day one, Joe
Hudepohl, who competed for Stanford from
1992 to 1995, gained a spot on the men's 4 x
200 free relay, finishing fourth in the 200
free. Both Thompson and Hudepohl compet
ed at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.
In the 100 and 200 freestyles, the top four
swimmers make the Olympic team. In all

other events, only the first and second place
times qualify.
The co-captain of this year's women's
squad, senior Lisa Jacob, led off day two of
the competition by placing third in the 200
free, clocking 2:00.65. Jacob was touched out
by Trina Jackson for second place by a mere
.03. Sophomore Tom Wilkins, swimming in
his first Olympic Trials, grabbed fifth place in
the 400 individual medley with a personal
best time of 4:23.11.
The championship finals on day three
began with one former Olympic gold-medal
ist qualifying for the 1996 team and ended
with another missing the team by less than a
quarter of a second.

In the women's 400 free, Janet Evans, a
four-time Olympic gold medalist, overtook
her nearest competition in the last 50 meters
to win the race in a time of 4:10.97. At age 24,
Evans, who swam for the Cardinal from 1990
to 1991, qualified for her third Olympic team.
Another 1992 Stanford Olympian, Lea
Loveless (Class of '94) fell short in her bid to
make the Atlanta squad in the 100 back
stroke. Loveless, the American record holder
in the event, finished sixth in 1:02.81. Whit
ney Hedgepeth won the race in 1:01.52, while
14-year-old Beth Botsford grabbed second,
0.07 behind.
