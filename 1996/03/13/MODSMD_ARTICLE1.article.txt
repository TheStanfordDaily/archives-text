INDIANAPOLIS — After placing four
swimmers on the 1996 United States
Olympic team in the first two nights of com
petition at the U.S. Olympic Team Trials, the
Cardinal has continued to make its presence
known in the fast waters of the Indiana Uni
versity Natatorium.
In the meet's first event last Wednesday,
1995 graduate Jenny Thompson qualified for
the 4 x 100-meter freestyle relay by placing
third in the 100 free in 55.45 seconds. Kurt
Grote (Class of '95) followed Thompson's
swim by putting himself on the U.S. team via
a second-place finish in the 100 breaststroke.
Grote swam to a time of 1:02.03, less than a
tenth of a second behind winner Jeremy Linn
of Tennessee. In the last race of day one, Joe
Hudepohl, who competed for Stanford from
1992 to 1995, gained a spot on the men's 4 x
200 free relay, finishing fourth in the 200
free. Both Thompson and Hudepohl compet
ed at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.
In the 100 and 200 freestyles, the top four
swimmers make the Olympic team. In all

other events, only the first and second place
times qualify.
The co-captain of this year's women's
squad, senior Lisa Jacob, led off day two of
the competition by placing third in the 200
free, clocking 2:00.65. Jacob was touched out
by Trina Jackson for second place by a mere
.03. Sophomore Tom Wilkins, swimming in
his first Olympic Trials, grabbed fifth place in
the 400 individual medley with a personal
best time of 4:23.11.
The championship finals on day three
began with one former Olympic gold-medal
ist qualifying for the 1996 team and ended
with another missing the team by less than a
quarter of a second.

In the women's 400 free, Janet Evans, a
four-time Olympic gold medalist, overtook
her nearest competition in the last 50 meters
to win the race in a time of 4:10.97. At age 24,
Evans, who swam for the Cardinal from 1990
to 1991, qualified for her third Olympic team.
Another 1992 Stanford Olympian, Lea
Loveless (Class of '94) fell short in her bid to
make the Atlanta squad in the 100 back
stroke. Loveless, the American record holder
in the event, finished sixth in 1:02.81. Whit
ney Hedgepeth won the race in 1:01.52, while
14-year-old Beth Botsford grabbed second,
0.07 behind.
