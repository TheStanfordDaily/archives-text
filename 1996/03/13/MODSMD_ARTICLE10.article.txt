SHARM ELrSHEIK, Egypt (AP)
â€” World leaders came to this Egyp
tian resort, begun by Israel during
its occupation of the Sinai peninsu
la, for an anti-terrorism summit
that President Clinton said yester
day would find "ways to combat
those who seek to kill peace with
violence."
The conference today is intended
to spark new momentum for peace
in the region after suicide-bombings
in Israel over the past three weeks
left 62 people dead. Yet problems
that have fostered violence seemed
likely to haunt the meeting.
The three-hour forum includes
leaders from 11 Arab nations and
Israel, Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, President Jacques Chirac of
France and British Prime Minister
John Major, all hastily assembled by
the Clinton administration to
underscore its commitment in the
Mideast.
Clinton said before leaving the
White House that "the will of the
people for peace is clearly greater
than the forces of division.... This
summit of the peacemakers can be
an important step in the process for
peace in the Middle East."
The leaders attending the sum
mit are determined to come up with
"ways to combat those who seek to
kill peace with violence," he said.
After the summit, Clinton said,
he will travel to Israel "to stand

with the people there in their time
of grief."
"In this time of difficulty, in the
battle against terror and the strug
gle for peace, Israel is not alone," he
said.
Syria and Lebanon chose not to
come. Syria, accused of fostering
terrorists, said it won't attend
because the meeting is merely "pro
paganda."
Aboard Air Force One with Jor
dan's King Hussein, Clinton said he
wished Syria were represented at
the meeting. "But I believe that in
terms of continuing the peace pro
cess and keeping commitments,
that President Assad will do that,"
he said. "And that's very impor
tant."
Clinton said he hoped the sum
mit would produce "a strong, united
stand for keeping the peace process
going and standing against the ter
ror."
Differences in Israeli and Arab
hopes for today's meeting arose
even as workmen were painting the
slogan "Summit of the Peacemak
ers" in Arabic and English on the
conference headquarters.
While Israeli Foreign Minister
Ehud Barak urged efforts to achieve
"concrete results" in the war on ter
rorism, PLO leaders criticized
Israel's 17-day closure of Palestini
an territories as a hardship that
would only provoke more violence.
