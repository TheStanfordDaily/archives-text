Former interior secretary fined
WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Interior Sec
retary James Watt was spared a jail sentence yes
terday and instead was fined and ordered to per
form 500 hours of community service for with
holding documents from a grand jury investigat
ing a government housing scandal.
Watt, who served in the Reagan administra
tion, was fined $5,000 — the maximum for the
single misdemeanor to which he had pleaded

guilty — and placed on five years probation. He
had faced a possible jail term of up to six months.
In sentencing Watt, U.S. District Judge Royce
C. Lamberth said, "It seems to me that what you
did there is out of character. ... It was an aberra
tion from your life. You have had a life of great
integrity and it's a shame to see what happened
here."
Lamberth said he had been torn in giving Watt
what he described as a "break" because he believed
"trifling with" a grand jury was a serious offense.
