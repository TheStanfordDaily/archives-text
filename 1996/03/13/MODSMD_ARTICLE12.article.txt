# Dole triumphant on 'Super Tuesday'
## 
### 
(AP) — Bob Dole won contests in
Texas, Florida and four other
Southern states yesterday to tight
en his hold on the Republican presi
dential nomination. Basking in vic
tory, he reached out to his remain
ing rivals and said it was time to
"put our ideas together" to beat
President Clinton.
"I think it is pretty clear now
that Bob Dole will be the nominee,"
Dole said. "This is now a race
between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton."
Early returns showed Dole
defeating Pat Buchanan and Steve
Forbes by more than 2-to-l margins
in Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Okla
homa and Mississippi. Dole, the
Senate majority leader, hoped
Louisiana and Oregon would deliv
er him a seven-state "Super Tues
day" sweep — and leave him with
roughly three-quarters of the dele
gates needed to clinch the nomina
tion.
That prize in sight, Dole made a
conciliatory gesture to Forbes and
Buchanan — perhaps hoping his
tone would convince them to quit,
or in Buchanan's case at least damp
down his attacks.
Dole clearly hoped yesterday's
victories would be so lopsided that
Buchanan and Forbes would
rethink their candidacies: Dole had

at least 641 delegates — two thirds
of the 996 delegates needed to clinch
nomination. In comparison, Forbes
had 73 delegates and Buchanan 62.
"We've listened and we've heard
strong messages," Dole said. He
echoed Forbes' theme of economic
growth and Buchanan's emphasis
on middle-class economic anxiety.
" It is time to come together now and
put our ideas together and build a
strong agenda for November."
Dole walloped Buchanan even in
Louisiana, where Buchanan's cau
cus victory in February triggered a
surge of support for the conserva
tive commentator.
Dole's satisfaction at the election
results came in the face of three new
national surveys showing Clinton
with double-digit leads in head-to
head matchups. They also showed
Dole would suffer if Ross Perot
mounted another independent can
didacy.
In these new surveys — and exit
polling of yesterday's GOP voters —
half the respondents also said Dole
did not have new ideas.
"What I make of those is that
once we get a nominee and he is out
there focusing on Bill Clinton
instead of getting beat up in pri
maries eveiy day then we will turn
this around," Dole said.
