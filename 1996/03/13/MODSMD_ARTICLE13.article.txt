TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) â€” China test-fired another
missile near Taiwan early today, intensifying the ten
sion in the region a day after China launched war games
and fired sharp words at the United States.
Taiwan has threatened to strike back if the mock
warfare turns into an attack, but both sides seemed
anxious not to turn up the rhetoric. The Chinese For
eign Ministry's remarks were relatively restrained, and
the Taiwanese military was at pains to deny newspaper
stories alleging Chinese violations of Taiwanese
airspace.
There was no immediate reaction from Taiwan to
the missile-firing, which broke a four-day hiatus that
had generated optimism among U.S. officials. The mis

sile was monitored electronically by USS Bunker Hill,
an Aegis-class guided missile cruiser in the area.
The M-9 missile was unarmed and did not cross Tai
wanese territorial waters as it fell to a test zone off Tai
wan's southern coast. The zone previously had been
designated by the Chinese.
Yesterday, police said they completed an island-wide
cleanup of bomb shelters and residents of Taipei, the
capital, were urged to clear their basements, which dou
ble as shelters but haven't been used for that purpose.
The military said the Chinese deployed warships and
staged bombing runs on the first day of the eight-day
exercise that has rattled Asia and drawn in the U.S.
navy.
