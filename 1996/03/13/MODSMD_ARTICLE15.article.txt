## Editorial Decisions on dining

The University must
consider all options in
review of food service

UNIVERSITY DINING Ser
vices, ever the focus of stu
dent complaints, has never
been known for good service or good
prices. With a formal review of the
department coming soon, that could
change — if the University remem
bers to keep Dining Services focused
on its key mission: serving students.
To that end, Stanford should consid
er all options as it seeks ways to
improve its student meal program.
At the outset, Provost Condoleez
za Rice should be praised for taking
on one of the University's most
entrenched bureaucracies. As most
other departments sweated through
years of cutbacks and consolidations,
Dining Services remained largely
untouched because of its status as a
"revenue-generating" unit. Now
that Rice has decided to focus her
cost-management talents on improv
ing Dining Services' inefficiencies,
students may finally see changes.
It's clear that food service meal
plans must be made more flexible
and less expensive. Students have
been saying this for years; students
are justified in wondering why Din
ing Services hasn't responded. Cur
rently, students living in "a la board"
dorms — the vast majority — must
purchase at least 12 meals a week,
and only if they also purchase points.
A less expensive plan without points
mandates 14 meals a week. For
spring quarter, the 14 meals-a-week
plan will cost $1,100, or more than
$7 per meal. Besides being outra
geously expensive, such a require
ment is far too stringent.
Residential Education's goal of
fostering community by having res
idents eat with their dorms is a
noble one, but forcing everyone to
buy 12 or more meals places an
unfair burden on many, especially
upperclassmen.

With this in mind, food service
should consider offering a signifi
cantly scaled-back meal plan, per
haps as low as five meals per week.
Furthermore, while it is obviously
necessary for Dining Services to
require a certain minimum number
of meals per week for planning pur
poses (If they sold one-meal plans,
what would happen if everyone
demanded their one meal at the
same time?), it should consider giv
ing students the choice to opt for no
meal plan at all.
If necessary, the University
should look into continuing to con
solidate dining operations to save
money. Even though this would
affect the community dining atmo
sphere, the increased meal-plan flex
ibility would make it worthwhile. It
is also worth considering eliminating
the department altogether and con
tracting out its duties to a private
vendor like Host Marriott. A number
of schools already do so, and the
results there seem to be positive.
The advantages are clear: A pri
vate food-service provider would
have an incentive to cut costs and
keep prices low because it would be
making a profit. The current Dining
Services monopoly has no incentive
to do so because it knows it can
charge as much as it wants because
students will be forced to pay it. That
mentality is wrong.
One has to wonder if an academic
institution like Stanford should even
be in the food service business. It's
clear that providing food is not one of
the University's core competencies;
why shouldn't the University out
source the operation? Stanford jetti
soned its legal department in favor of
outside lawyers two years ago to save
money; why can't the same be done
with Dining Services?
Now that the University appears
to be getting serious about improv
ing Dining Services, we hope that
department will be able to clean up
its act. Above all, the University
should make sure that food service
offers the flexibility of less strin
gent meal plans and reasonable
prices — and should be open to all
possible alternatives.
