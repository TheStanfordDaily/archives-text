Daily editorial was unfair, film society president says

THE DAILY'S MARCH 8 editorial
misrepresented some of the facts
about the debate over the spe
cial-fee process at the ASSU Senate
meeting on March 5. In addition to
making false claims about the Stanford
Film Society's compliance with proto
col, the editorial does not even attempt
to elucidate the whole story, or even
the extenuating circumstances that
caused the film society to seek place
ment on the ballot at that time.
As I said to the senate last week,
there is no getting around the fact that
the film society did not submit all of the
appropriate paperwork by the designat
ed deadlines. The coordinator of the spe
cial fee process for our group, while
assuring our organization continually
that everything was under control,
neglected to carefully read the packet
that the elections commission supplied

until the night before the petitions were
due. For this reason, we were only able
to obtain 1,316 of the 1,404 required
signatures by the deadline. At that time,
we turned in our petition with that
number of signatures, contrary to The
Daily's implication that we failed to
turn it in at all.
When the Elections Commission
denied an extension which would have
allowed us to obtain the remaining 88
signatures, we promptly obtained these
signatures (plus an additional 387 for
safety's sake) and completed all other
necessary materials for our group's
placement. In accordance with the ASSU
Constitution, we appealed to the COP to
sponsor a bill that would let the senate
decide whether our circumstances were
sufficiently extenuating to be given a
reprieve from the original deadlines.
In determining that our circum-

stances were extenuating, the senate did
not place us on the ballot as The Daily
states. Instead, it effectively granted an
extension to the film society and to two
other groups (Redwood and Stanford
Cheer) to comply with the same require
ments that other groups followed to be
placed on the ballot for the spring gen
eral election. Not until this Friday will
the Elections Commission evaluate the
validity of the paperwork which we
turned in last week and the paperwork
which it anticipates receiving from these
two other groups by that time.
We chose to fight for our group's
placement on the ballot so that the many
students who want a financially viable
film society on campus do not have to be
punished for one person's simple mis
take. While The Daily argues that the
senate has a "constitutional obligation"
to exclude certain groups from being

placed on the ballot, we feel that the
obligation of the senate to represent the
interests of students and student groups
supersedes this arguable duty, which
allows for exceptions nonetheless. With
the interests of students in mind, the
senate chose to relax the stringent regu
lations of the Elections Commission to
allow a fee-seeking group — whose goal
of providing opportunities to screen,
study and create films appears to have
wide support among students — a sec
ond chance at obtaining placement.
Rather than view this incident as such,
The Daily used this example of the
ASSU's consideration to call for that
body's dissolution on the grounds that it
violated its constitution, which is appar
ently not even the case.
