# Housing official responds to editorials on condoms, peepholes
## 
### 
Regarding The Daily's March 5 edito
rial on condom machines, I am happy to
say that Housing Facilities and Services
already has a long-standing policy of
installing them upon request by resi
dences. The fact that they exist in some
undergraduate residences and not others
is a function of that local decision-mak
ing responsibility (that is, historically
some houses have wanted them and
some have not).
It might also be helpful to know,
though, that over time, sales from con-

dom machines have tended to be
extremely low — in one year, sales
totaled $50 for all machines in residences
— and this makes it challenging to con
vince vendors to leave the machines in
place. Our guess is that students prefer
other ways of getting condoms, but we
are open to hearing otherwise. Any resi
dence group that wants to add a machine
should simply contact their facilities
supervisor to make the request.
Regarding the March 6 editorial
about peepholes, I am not sure what
The Daily means by "an economical,
feasible first step" — installing peep
holes in the 3,500 student room doors in
undergraduate housing alone would cost
approximately $75,000 and might trig
ger fire-safety code issues which would
be even costlier. With all the many

demands on a finite budget, we haven't
yet concluded that this would be the
best way to help students practice cau
tion and safety. Again though, we are
open to hearing otherwise.
We have heard more from undergrad
uate students who want additional and
better bike racks, for example, and bet
ter exterior lighting, and phones for visi
tors to use (so that exterior doors can
remain locked). We have installed
phones on or near all student residences
— a project that was completed last
summer — and have been upgrading
lighting wherever and whenever we have
had the opportunity (around Stern,
Grove Mayfield and other CIP houses
last summer and fall, and soon in Gover
nor's Corner). We are also working on a
bike rack master plan with the Trans-

portation Department aimed at address
ing students' concerns in housing and
elsewhere on campus.
These worthy endeavors and the
introduction of peepholes have to com
pete for resources from the same limited
budgets, so increasing the priority of one
will necessarily decrease the priority of
another. (Mandated code compliance
projects compete for the same money as
well.) We welcome students' input as we
balance and re-balance these needs and
figure out which ones to meet, where,
how and when. Anyone with suggestions
should feel free to contact his / her Facil
ities Supervisor or any of the managerial
staff in Housing Facilities and Services.
