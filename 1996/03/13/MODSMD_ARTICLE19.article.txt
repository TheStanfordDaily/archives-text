## Environmental racism 
### 
WHY SHOULD AN environmen
tal group care about racism? On
one level, if you are working for
systemic change, you need allies. On
another level, the philosophy that allows
racism is similar to, if not the same as,
the philosophy that allows humans to
separate themselves from nature. Both of
these explanations are important, inter
esting and critical in the long term. How
ever, there is a third explanation, that if
not paid heed in the short term to will
continue to lead to tragic results.
The third explanation, and the one
most difficult to deal with, is that the envi
ronmental movement has traditionally
been passively racist — or, at least,
because of the environmentalist's inatten
tiveness to racial issues, environmental
damage has disproportionately fallen
upon the shoulders of people of color.
Consider toxic dumping. Fifty-three
out of 54 California toxic waste sights are
located in communities dominated by peo
ple of color. Even controlling for income,
communities of color are much more like
ly to be burdened with waste than white
communities. While poor white communi
ties don't get dumped on, more affluent
African American, Chicano or Native
American ones do.
The traditional explanation for this
phenomenon is to blame this location bias
on alleged racist motives within corpora
tions such as Romic, a recalcitrant haz
ardous waste facility currently under fire
in East Palo Alto. The corporations pre
dictably, and accurately, deny this.

Large corporations can't be racist. They
have no morals (good or bad) because they
care only about profit. If most large corpo
rations were people, they'd slit their moth
er's throats for an extra nickel or frantical
ly build rubber rafts for drowning people if
they thought they'd profit from the posi
tive publicity. There is no way that a toxic
waste facility would move into a moderate
ly affluent community of color instead of a
slightly less affluent, slightly less educated
white one unless it was more profitable to
do so — or unless racism existed on some
one else's part.
One possible, frequently fingered, cul
prit for this racism is the government.
However, while individuals in government
organizations like Occupational Safety
and Health Administration can be racist,
the government operates Unostly) on
objective standards and is thus unlikely to
be responsible for subjective racism.
Environmentalists, on the other hand,
operate entirely on subjective standards in
choosing their battles. There is no set algo
rithm for mobilization — no one insists, for
example, that every three dumping viola
tions should equal one protest. Moreover,
though slowly becoming more accepting of
people who don't fit the standard stereo
types, the environmental movement is still
relatively homogenous and in the 1970s
and 1980s, when most of these toxic facili
ties were finding locations, the movement
was almost completely homogenous. Had
Romic violated the law in Menlo Park, local
communities would have coalesced in oppo
sition and citizens, used to being heard by

the powers that be, would have risen up in
opposition. In East Palo Alto, there is too
much baggage for a support network to
exist and there is enough disempowerment
and disenfranchisement for organization to
be extremely difficult.
Growing up in America deals everyone
a certain amount of racism. Environmen
talists, being well-meaning, probably have
smaller doses than other people. However,
there's a certain inertia of internalized
attitudes that everyone picks up from the
news, from their textbooks and from
observing the interactions of people of dif
ferent races. I have it, you have, we all
have it; no matter what race we are, we all
subconsciously classify different-looking
people as "others." Furthermore, even if
all of this internal racism could be
expunged, there'd still be the great moun
tain of divisions and lack of trust, brought
on by history, to overcome before commu
nities and people of different races could
really coalesce and mobilize.
In the end, race is too much a part of
our history and of our present to be
ignored. The environmental movement
tried to ignore it for 20 years and failed.
Now that movement and others like it
must become actively anti-racist if they
wish to succeed.
