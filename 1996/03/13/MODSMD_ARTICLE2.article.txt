# Brazilian president returns to the Farm
## Cardoso announces new scholars program 
### Amy Slucter Staff writer 
In a gesture signalling that
both Stanford and Brazil are in
terested in strengthening their
historic ties, Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso an
nounced Monday a new program
that will bring a Brazilian scholar
to the University each year.
The Joaquim Nabuco profes
sorship, which begins next year,
will be the first chair in Brazilian
studies in any university in the
United States.
"It is particularly meaningful
for me to return to Stanford Uni
versity," Cardoso said, pausing to
glance around Dinkelspiel Audito
rium. "In the audience I recognize
old friends."
Cardoso, who was a visiting pro
fessor of political science at Stan
ford in 1977, is perhaps the
strongest link in the chain that con
nects Stanford to Brazil. Another
link is his wife, Ruth Cardoso, who
completed her doctorate in poverty
and inequality at Stanford.
According to Terry Karl, associ

ate professor of political science
and director of the Center for
Latin American Studies, the Uni
versity is enormously proud that
Cardoso accepted the invitation to
come to Stanford to give Monday's
Robert G. Wesson Lecture, an an
nual lecture series in international
relations.
Cardoso's visit gave Karl and Po
litical Science Prof. Philippe
Schmitter an opportunity to renew
their friendship with Cardoso. The
three, together with Albert
Hirschman, a political economist
and Princeton University professor
who also attended the speech, col
laborated to write a series of essays
titled, "Transitions From Authori
tarian Rule," when Cardoso was at
Stanford.
"We didn't have any clue that
he would be president," Karl said
after the speech. "At that point he
was an academic."
Cardoso's speech, titled "In
Praise of Politics," made it clear
that Cardoso has been able to
make an effective transition from
academics to politics.
"To be a true political man re
quires the capacity to innovate,"
Cardoso said. "The real leader in
a country is a kind of symbol.
What I am saying is that the polit
ical man must create public
spaces for those who are not oiga
nized."
Brazil is the largest democracy
in South America, but it has one of
the most uneven distributions of
income in the world. However, ac
cording to Cardoso, the class con
flict over income distribution has
lost its relevance.
"Individuals and groups are no
longer defined by the place they
play in production," Cardoso
said. "We no longer define our
selves by what we do, but by what
we are."
Cardoso noted that by expand
ing direct participation, inequality
would be diminished.
"The restoration of democracy

is only a first step," Cardoso said.
"We need to reform the structure
of the state at every level in order
to provide greater equality for all
citizens and to improve income
distribution."
He noted that political parties
have lost their ability to mobilize
the population to solve social
problems like poverty and in
equality. He explained that glob
alization and the weakening of the
nation-state have diminished the
ability of the state to act indepen
dently.
"We must strike an ideal bal
ance between the role of the state
and the role of the populace," he
said. "We must agree to govern
each other."
Cardoso emphasized that the
need to expand democracy and in
crease participation must involve
discussion and negotiation. It
must also involve education so
that the people are ready for
democracy, he said.
The challenge to what Cardoso
called "development with justice"
is that Brazil is dominated by en
trenched interests.

'We must strike an
ideal balance
between the role of
the state and the role
of the populace....
We must agree to
govern each other.'
— Fernando
Henrique Cardoso

"As you deepen democracy
and try to maintain growth and
build a more equitable economy,"
Karl said, "entrenched privileges
will have to take some losses."
Constant negotiation is funda
mental to solving this problem,
she said.
"Cardoso is making an appeal
for all sectors to make sacrifices to
make Brazil a more equitable
country," she said.
Karl said it is incorrect to define

Cardoso's policies as neo-liberal.
She said Cardoso is a man who de
fies labels.
University President Gerhard
Casper also praised Cardoso as a
man of quiet inner confidence who
is known for his civility.
"For you, politics is in the best
sense of the word a vocation,"
Casper said. "We also would like
you to return to academics," he
said as he presented Cardoso with
the Wesson Certificate.
Not everyone on Monday, how
ever, praised Cardoso. Atossa
Soltani of Amazon Watch, a San
Francisco-based environmental
group, criticized the president's
actions regarding the Amazon
rain forest. Standing outside the
auditorium, Soltani used an am
plifier to protest the construction
of a highway through the heart of
the rain forest.
Following his speech, Cardoso
quickly left the auditorium in
order to catch a flight headed for
Japan where he celebrated the
100 th anniversary of the Treaty
of Amity between Brazil and
Japan.
