## The
						lessons of FRI: Downsizing the University 
### 
Last November, around the
time when most students'
thoughts turned to a flight home
for Thanksgiving and the football
team's prospects against Cal, a small
group of people, some wearing white and
burning incense, planted themselves in
White Plaza and fasted there for 24
hours. There was a peculiar, foreign
feeling to the scene and most onlookers
paused just for a second before moving
on. Only a handful of posters and plac
ards reading "FRI" betrayed the group's
exotic anonymity.
Two weeks earlier, word had leaked
that University administrators were
mulling over plans to close the Food
Research Institute, Stanford's 75-year
old center devoted to studying interna
tional development. The gathering in
White Plaza coincided with a meeting of
the Faculty Senate's advisory board to
determine the institute's fate. In Decem
ber, the board forwarded a recommenda
tion for FRl's closure to the University
president, who promptly endorsed it. The
final, official death knell sounded two
months ago, when the Board of Trustees

approved FRl's closure.
That announcement signaled the
death not just of FRI, but, apparently,
the FRI "story." Had the FRI fasters,
professors and alumni succeeded in at
least staying their department's execu
tion, we might still see news of the lat
est developments splashed on The
Daily's front pages. But that didn't hap
pen — and so the decision was made,
the credits rolled, and now we can occu
py ourselves with sex scandals and the
NCAA tournament.
So why is this space devoted to an old
story? Because it isn't over. For one,
uncertainty remains about where the
institute's extant faculty and students
will relocate. Some plan on hopping to
another department, others wait on news
of funding, and the rest will probably to
pick up and hit El Camino. More than a
few already have.
But what's really alarming (and news
worthy) for anyone concerned with the
welfare of Stanford is that the downsiz
ing virus which claimed the Food
Research Institute reproduces rapidly.
The Faculty Senate has apparently con

ceded as much, revealing recently that
the verbs "consolidate," "merge" and
"combine" will soon appendage all official
discussions about "small departments."
FRI is the first Stanford department
to be closed in two decades, but there is
good reason to believe that this shutdown
will be a watershed. The institute, Dean
of Humanities and Sciences John Shoven
said last November, did not "measure up
to Stanford's standards of excellence."
The institute was "not as distinguished
as it should be." Its position in national
rankings had declined in recent years. In
the final analysis, FRI did not register
"high on a measure of academic centrali
ty to a great university."
Forget, for the moment, that disserta
tions produced by FRI scholars regularly
clean up at national competitions, or that
some observers believe research under
way at the institute may soon yield a
Nobel Prize. More troubling is the
authority Shoven claimed for administra
tors to use pseudoscientific criteria —
like the number of journal citations
attributed to a department's faculty
members — as valid measures of merit

and worth, the better to determine
whether the University should continue
supporting such work or cast if off. There
does not seem to be a big gap from that
kind of rationale to a Stanford governed
by a hollow democracy, with dozens of
careers and livelihoods resting on the cal
culated whim of a few individuals.
These days, admonitions like this usu
ally elicit quick retorts. Last week, The
New York Times published a long-over
due, seven-part series on the real eco
nomic and human costs of corporate
downsizing. The day after the series fin
ished, Times columnist William Safire
denounced such "popu-lib whining,"
insisting that "downsizing provides the
greatest good for the greatest number."
Similarly, the current Stanford adminis
tration often reminds detractors that
managing a grand university is not
unlike running a large corporation.
In many ways, Stanford is an indus
try — a great, big institution with a lot
of people and cash flowing about. But
Stanford does not answer to the stock
market and shareholders. Its most valu
able capital is human, and its products

can't be bought and sold. Defenders of
downsizing claim that the threat of los
ing their jobs makes workers more effi
cient. But if we try to apply a similar
philosophy to this University, I suspect
the students and teachers doing Stan
ford's best work won't become more
efficient. They'll leave.
Ultimately, the Stanford we know
today will vanish in just that sort of anx
ious and suspicious climate, where facul
ty look over their shoulders and feverish
ly check national rankings like college
basketball bookies, and students shy
away from small and innovative pro
grams they know command little respect.
Things aren't that bad yet. But the
silence that has attended the larger
issues involved in the closing of the Food
Research Institute — for instance, their
total absence from lists of issues the
Council of Presidents purports to fight
for — is cause for more than a little con
cern. It might not be long before stories
like FRl's stop seeming so old.
