Special-fee request was
poorly handled, jazz
orchestra member says
In correction of The Daily's March 6
article on the ASSU Senate meeting
from the night before, the Stanford
Jazz Orchestra was not ever "denied
placement [on the special-fee ballot]
due to a clerical error." The bill being
dealt with was "To Correct the Stan
ford Jazz Orchestra Special Fee
Request," wherein the Appropriations
Committee attempted to make amends
to the Jazz Orchestra for its haphaz
ard procedure in the special-fee recom
mendation process.
From conversation with Appropria
tions Committee member and Deputy
Senate Chair Bill Shen, it seems that

the Appropriations Committee is
intended to be the route through which
a special fee request is brought to the
senate for approval. This being the case,
each special fee should be dealt with on
an individual basis and care should be
taken when making cuts to a group's
budget, since the groups themselves
have little or no chance to debate these
recommendations in the senate, particu
larly since the original recommenda
tions were unveiled, brought to the
floor, and "rubber-stamped" all in one
evening at the Feb. 27 senate meeting.
I agree with The Daily's editorial
that the changes that were made to the
budgets were generally "small, cosmetic
changes here and there." I would go on
to say that the changes were arbitrary,
irresponsible and undocumented. In
our case, I believe that every expense
on our budget was justified and, like
every other group that submitted a

budget, every item was documented. In
return for this, we got a 10-minute chat
with three members of the Appropria
tions Committee, in which they did not
ask us about any specific item and did
not indicate that they thought that any
of our listed expenses were too high.
However, sometime between that Sun
day afternoon and the senate meeting
on Tuesday, over $1,200 of our $10,890
budget was removed. For the larger
budgets on the ballot, these cosmetic
changes are not too significant; for our
budget, and for other smaller fee
requests, it begins to look like major
surgery. To the committee's credit,
they did ask us which line items were
more important to us and which were
less important; to their detriment, they
turned right around and cut the more
important ones, while leaving the less
important ones alone. I still have not
received a satisfactory explanation as to

why these cuts were made.
The Daily said that it thinks the
committee and the senate did not live
up to their responsibilities in examining
which groups were fit to receive special
fees and in determining how much of
each group's budget was valid. We
believe that this lack of attention also
worked against those groups whose
budgets were documented and consid
ered, who took the time to learn that
the ASSU By-laws restrict us from
receiving general fees (which the
Appropriations Committee did not),
who submitted a declaration of intent
and whose budgets were chopped up by
the committee at 5:30 a.m. after stay
ing up all night.
I thank Bill Shen and the other sena
tors for the $500 they gave us for com
plaining. Yes, Bill, something is better
than nothing, since you asked. But we
are still looking for the rest of the

money we budgeted. And I imagine that
other groups are looking for their
money also â€” it seems to have disap
peared inside that gaping hole in the
Appropriations Committee's logic.
When the bill to correct our special
fee was brought up at the March 5
meeting, some of the senators protested
on the grounds that if they corrected
our budget, they would have to go back
and reconsider all the budgets. All I
have to say to them is: If you had done
it right the first time, spending less
time arguing about "points of order"
and more time examining and dis
cussing budgets, there would be no
need for you to reconsider every budget
on the ballot. But that did not happen,
and so the need exists.
