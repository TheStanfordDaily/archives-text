# Tackling health care
## Six Stanford students will spend spring vacation pondering public policy issues 
### Stephen L. Shih Contributing Writer 
Ah, spring break. For many col
lege students across the country,
it's the perfect time to reunite with
friends, hit the beach and party.
But for some, it's an opportunity to
tackle one of the most controversial
public policy issues facing the coun
try today: health care.
While many will be working on
their tans or watching obscene
amounts of college basketball, six
Stanford students will be acting as
facilitators for "Exploring Health
Care from a Cross-Cultural Per
spective," the newest of eight Alter
native Spring Break trips being of
fered this year by the Haas Center
for Public Service.
The program will examine the
U.S. health care system and com
pare it to that of another society —
Japan. The students involved will
host about 20 Japanese medical
school students and investigate
controversial topics such as med
ical ethics, alternative medicine
and the quality of managed care.
Many of the students are look
ing forward to learning about how
medicine is practiced in Japan and
about Japanese culture in general.
"Anything cross-cultural is
important in America," said
sophomore Joyce Ho. "It's nice to
have a different perspective on
things."

The students will spend most of
break in San Francisco, but "Ex
ploring Health Care" is actually a
two-week program, stretching out
into the first week of spring quarter.
Although the itinerary has not
yet been fully determined, the stu
dents plan to visit various hospitals
and clinics in the city, such as
Kaiser Medical Center, San Fran
cisco General and an AIDS hospice.
Ho said the visits are designed to in
troduce the students to different
approaches to health care in the
United States.
The first week will also include
sight-seeing tours and a trip to On-
Lok, a prominent facility that
caters largely to the Bay Area's el
derly Asian community.
The second week of the program
will kick off with an on-campus
medical ethics seminar on April 1.
The seminar, which is open to the
entire Stanford community, will in
clude discussions on various case
studies and feature Ernie Young,
co-director of the Center for Bio
medical Ethics.
For the rest of the week, stu
dents will tour the Medical Center
and examine issues in preventive
health care, alternative medicine
and primary care. In addition, the
Japanese students will have the
chance to attend classes at the
School of Medicine.
According to junior Paul Kim,
co-coordinator of Alternative

Spring Break '96, "Exploring
Health Care" is the result of a col
laborative effort between the
spring break program and Volun
teers in Asia, which operates a
Trans-Pacific Exchange between
students at Stanford and in Japan.
Alexis Olian, finance director of
Volunteers in Asia and an associate
program director for "Exploring
Health Care," said the idea for the
trip may have been a result of ex
change students encountering the
very different health-care systems
of a foreign country.
Olian and other Volunteers in
Asia staff members have been busy
working out the itinerary for the
program, but she said the students
have also had an active role in plan
ning the activities.
In fact, according to Kim, the
main appeal of the program is that
it gives students an opportunity to
explore aspects of the health-care
system that interest them.
Junior Wilmer Huang, for ex
ample, is looking forward to learn
ing more about alternative and pre
ventative medicine, which may be
effective ways to cut medical costs
and improve care in the near fu
ture, he said.
Grace Bhudhikanok, a graduate
student in epidemiology, is espe
cially interested in the cross-cultur
al component of the program.
"Right now, the American
health care system is in flux," she

said. "I wonder how the Japanese
are handling [health-care prob
lemsl, if there are any solutions
they've found."
According to Kim, the student
facilitators were selected from a
pool of qualified applicants. He and
co-coordinator Katie Monahan
wanted students with experience in
the issue, vision and initiative.
More than anything else, they
looked for students who showed a
genuine interest in medicine and
public health, Kim said.
Ki m said he expects the program
to be a success and to pave the way

for new trips next year. Alternative
Spring Break already sponsors pro
grams on homelessness, environ
mental protection and other issues.
" 'Exploring Health Care' is
symbolic of the Alternative Spring
Break program's desire to expand,"
he said.
According to Kim, the trips en
able students to participate in a
community service project and,
hopefully, to generate a sustained
interest in a particular issue.
Each program stresses learning
from group interaction and apply
ing the knowledge gained to future

experiences, he said.
"The real part of the program,"
he said, "is asking 'What do you do
with what you learn?' "
Kim noted that groups such as
the Stanford Homelessness Action
Coalition were created by previous
Alternative Spring Break partici
pants, and he said he and Monahan
hope the student facilitators for
"Exploring Health Care" will con
tinue their involvement in the field
when the trip is over.
"We hope they come back to
Stanford with changed views of
why they're here," he said.
