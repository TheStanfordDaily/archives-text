# Netscape CEO reflects on firm's success
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Speaking before a capacity
crowd of 300 at Bishop Auditori
um, Netscape Communications
Corp. President and CEO Jim
Barksdale reflected on the history
and future of one of the most suc
cessful startup companies in U.S.
history.
Barksdale said he was proud
and fortunate to have been a co
founder of the company, which
has a market value of more than
$3 billion, according to most esti
mates. He admitted that even he
wua .how. well his
company's stock "has done.
"I don't think that anyone
could have predicted how well the
stock has performed. It exceeded
all expectations," Barksdale said.
"Even the most optimistic ap

praisal was for the stock to hit a
high of $51. It closed at $78 on the
first day of trading."
Barksdale credited much of the
company's success to the fact that
there is ready demand for its prod
uct. Netscape, which markets and
operates one of the most prolific
World Wide Web browsers, came
up with what has become the most
accessible and easily used applica
tions on the Internet.
"We saw that there was a mar
ket for the product," said Barks
dale. "Within 60 days of introduc
ing the Netscape browser, we had
captured 70 percent of the traffic."
i34iH.sdalc sryjri while, it is H easy
"to realize ndhVattd and vast po
tential of the market now, back
when he and his partners started
the company, no one foresaw the
explosive growth and profit poten
tial it had.

"It's like the guy who sold the
first phone. I mean, how do you
see the market out there before
anyone else?" Barksdale said.
During the question-and-an
swer session, audience members
asked how Netscape plans to keep
its hold on the market given all the
competitors that are closing in to
grab a share of the business. Some
were particularly interested in how
the company is reacting toward Mi
crosoft Corp.'s aggressive moves to
gain a larger foothold in the market.
Barksdale answered confident
ly, saying he was not greatly con
cerned about another company
supplanting Netscape anytime
%oort. Many popular Web sites, he
said, operate best with Netscape's
Navigator browser, and the de
mand for the product is increasing
daily. Barksdale said many com
petitors offer consumers nothing

more than a copy of the service and
products that Netscape currently
offers, so consumers would not be
likely to switch away from
Netscape.
"Why would anyone choose to
leave a service they've been with
for three years, has high utility
and low cost?" asked Barksdale.
He said he was more concerned
about a competitor coming "out of
nowhere," and he used the current
problems at Apple Computer to
make his point.
"(Former Apple CEO Steve)
Jobs was so focused on what he
perceived was his enemy, IBM,
that he could not see what was
quickly coming at him from the
sides, Intel and Microsoft," Barks
dale said. "Who knows, maybe our
biggest competitor in five years
will come from a company started
by someone in this room."
