# Pioneering journalist and editor dead at 94
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Katherine Beebe Pinkham Har
ris, 94, a pioneering journalist,
writer and editor at Stanford, died
of cancer on Sunday.
During her 35-year journalism
career, Harris covered events rang
ing from the Tokyo Rose trial, to
Queen Elizabeth's coronation to
the kidnapping of Charles Lind
bergh's baby.
She worked at Stanford in a
number of different capacities. Her
first job was as secretary and assis
tant to Prof Everett Smith, then
head of the journalism program.
Several years later, in 1961, Harris
produced promotional material for
the Office of Development before
moving to the University News and

Publications Scrvice.
Former News Service Director
Bob Beyers said in a statement that
Harris "demonstrated exceptional
persistence, professionalism and
integrity covering several of the
greatest stories of her time. She
cared personally about those in
volved in human trauma."
Harris' granddaughter, Jen
nifer Young Taylor, said her caring
nature showed through more than
once.
When covering the trial of Iva
Toguri, the Japanese-American
woman known as Tokyo Rose and
convicted of treason after World
War 11, Harris "was convinced .. .
there was no chance she had been
Tokyo Rose, that she was an inno
cent Japanese-American woman,"
Taylor said.

When covering the Lindbergh
case, Harris was the one reporter to
crack through the security sur
rounding the famous pilot's resi
dence by asking the family for in
formation about the baby's diet â€”
an attempt to let the kidnappers
know how better to care for the
child.
"She said to me more than once,
'I suddenly got the idea about the
diet... and put on my white gloves
and walked up to the door,' " Tay
lor said. "That did get a response.
Someone shielding the family took
the note she had written."
"It was the woman-to-woman
kind of thing that broke the ice,"
Taylor said.
As a woman, Harris had to fight
for the stories and positions she
got. Her first job in journalism was

in the women's department of the
Oakland Tribune. When a
"rewrite" position opened up, Har
ris managed to persuade the editor
to let her work in the news depart
ment.
Later, as the Associated Press'
first female correspondent west of
the Mississippi River, she covered
the first United Nations meetings
and Queen Elizabeth's coronation.
She was forced to retire at 55 due to
Associated Press regulations for
women.
She married Edwin G. Pinkham
in 1941; he died in 1948. In 1974,
she married Stanford History Prof.
Emeritus David Harris, who died in
1975.
She is survived by three step
granddaughters and four great
grandchildren.
