# New lineup system aids police officers
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
A victim comes into the police station to report a crime. Police pre
pare a lineup of possible suspects, hoping the victim can give them a
lead.
But instead of sorting through old file photos to fill the lineup
or dragging in several prisoners, the police simply suggest charac
teristics to a computer database and the suspects appear on a
screen.
From there, the victim can look at the suspects from varying dis
tances and from any of 16 different angles.
Stanford Police say the Police Lineup System would make police
work much easier — if it i« ever marketed.
For now, the system is just a project for Computer Science 247 A:
"Human-Computer Interaction: Interaction Design Studio."
Master's students Craig Blackwood, Tor Norbye and Sandy Felt,
first-year doctoral student Derek Reamon and sophomore Hussein
Kanji designed the "P.L.U.S. Interactive" system, which they
demonstrated Monday in Cordura Hall.
"This thing is just a prototype, but we happen to think it's a pret
ty doggone good idea," Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
"We would consider it if it's marketed."
To develop the system, the students consulted with the Stanford
and Palo Alto Police Departments, Felt said. "We had all these ideas
about how a virtual system would improve on a real system," she
said, "but we really didn't have any idea how a real lineup worked."
Under the system, police begin by photographing suspects when
they are booked in jail. "We put them on a lazy susan and take a video
of them turning all around," Felt explained.
Police then enter information into the file on the suspect's name,
gender, race, date of birth, age, height, weight, hair color, eye color,
driver's license number and any marks, tattoos or scars.
On Monday, students acted out a scenario in which Stanford Po
lice Det. Mark Swineford questioned a woman trying to identify a
suspect who ran out of the room.
With controls, Swineford was able to show the profile of the sus
pect the woman was most likely to have seen, as well as zooming in
and out on the virtual suspect. He showed one suspect at a time on
the screen and then all three to allow the woman to choose the most
likely candidate.
But the system is not likely to be installed in the Stanford Police
Department soon. Blackwood said while the students had a lot of fun
designing it, the other work they have been neglecting in the mean
time may prevent them from marketing their product.
