### Prithika Balakrishnan Contributing writer 
The Federal Bureau of Investi

ford Police's most wanted crimi
nals in Waikiki, Hawaii, on Thurs
day after a foot pursuit.
Alton Faletoi Jr. allegedly stole
more than $30,000 worth of com
puter equipment, cellular phones,
stereos and credit cards from aca
demic buildings and individuals
connected with the University,
said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. Members of the Sher
iff s Department Fugitive Appre
hension Unit are currently flying
to Honolulu to execute the war
rant, charging Faletoi with pos
session of stolen property.
According to Niemeyer, Stan
ford Police and the FBI have been
searching for Faletoi, 31, since
early October. During the sum
mer, Faletoi allegedly stole nu
merous pieces of high-tech equip
ment from Stanford before begin
ning a nationwide spree, where he

"pillaged colleges in the area, such
as Santa Clara, before moving to
Southern California and then
Oregon," Niemeyer said.
He allegedly victimized numer
ous universities, including Lewis
and Clark College and Reed Col
lege in Portland, Ore., and univer
sities in Washington. He then
traveled to Utah and finally Le
Claire, lowa, where he was given a
ride by a local farmer on Oct. 14,
Niemeyer added.
Faletoi was able to escape lowa
and Illinois police before being
made a federal fugitive by the FBI,
which charged him with unlawful
flight to avoid prosecution. FBI in
vestigation later revealed that
Faletoi had traveled to Philadel
phia before flying to Honolulu.
They were able to decipher his
whereabouts by tracing a stolen
credit card he had used to send
flowers to a woman at Stanford,
and "were able to close in on him
from there," according to Niemey
er.
Faletoi was planning on leaving

the United States for Samoa, a
plan that the FBI learned of
through an anonymous tip, ac
cording to Niemeyer. After stak
ing out the Honolulu airport sev
eral times, FBI agents came upon
the suspect by chance on
Kalakaua Boulevard in Waikiki
and then chased him on foot to a
Chinese restaurant, where he was
finally apprehended.
Faletoi is currently awaiting
extradition to California, where he
will be re-booked at Santa Clara
County Jail.
Stanford is the only institution
among the alleged victims to press
charges. Due to the cost involved
in the extradition process, other
alleged victims do not plan to file
suit at this time.
According to Niemeyer, Stan
ford has the "most cases, as well as
the most reliable cases."
After the Stanford trial, the
other universities and individuals
will be given the opportunity to
file charges but, Niemeyer said,
"Stanford gets him first."
