# Housing and Dining Services to undertake internal review
## 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
Housing and Dining Services will undergo an in
ternal review next quarter in an effort to assess the
positives and negatives of the organization, as well as
to understand its overall market position.
University Budget Director Timothy Warner said he
called for the review after Provost Condoleezza Rice re
organized her office, giving him the responsibility of
overseeing the finances of Housing and Dining Services.
"I thought it would be useful to do a big-scale re
view of the operation, at least to make it clear for me
what was going on in the operation," Warner said.
The committee doing the review will most likely be
made up of 10 to 12 people, including three students,
Warner said. With the aid of the ASSU's Nomina
tions Committee, two undergraduates and one grad
uate student will be selected.
"We want students who have been in at least one
of the meal plans and who will be here next year,"
Warner said.
He added that the committee will include two or
more faculty members, at least one of whom will be a

resident fellow. The remainder of the group will be
made up of various members of the University staff, in
cluding Residential Education Director Jane Camarillo
and Housing and Dining Services Director Keith Guy.
Warner said he is going into the review process
hoping to make the current system even better than
it currently is, as well as to address student concerns.
"It is quite a strong system," he said. "It is not
something that needs to be fixed."
Among the Consortium on Financing Higher Edu
cation schools — a group of 31 top private universi
ties and colleges — Stanford ranked second most ex
pensive in board price, according to Guy. Stanford
ranked 19th in room rates, and seventh in combined
room and board rates.
Guy said Housing and Dining Services is looking
forward to the review.
"It is a chance, in a non-budget cuts-driven way, to
look at the system and make it better — institutionally,
structurally and functionally," he said, adding that such
a review has never been done in his 10 years at Stanford.
"This could have positive outcomes for everybody."
Warner said the internal review will probably con
tinue into fall quarter at least.
