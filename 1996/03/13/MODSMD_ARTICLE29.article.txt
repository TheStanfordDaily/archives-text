# SEAS protests Taco Bell
## 
### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
Members of Students for Environmental Ac
tion at Stanford led a demonstration Friday after
noon to protest the possible placement of a Taco
Bell in Tresidder Union. The rally culminated in
the presentation of a petition signed by more than
2,000 people to the dean of students.
Holding signs that read "Stanford Out of
Burma" and "Stanford Demands Corporate Re
sponsibility," about 50 students gathered in front
of Old Union to participate in the demonstration
against the fast-food chain whose parent compa
ny, PepsiCo, conducts business in Myanmar, the
nation in Southeast Asia formerly known as
Burma.
The international community has condemned
Myanmar's military dictatorship for human rights
abuses. According to SEAS, PepsiCo's bottling op
erations in the country financially support the gov
ernment. Furthermore, the company purchases
agricultural goods that may depend on slave labor,
they said.
In its efforts to restore peace and democracy to
the country, SEAS is part of a much larger "Free
Burma Coalition" which includes many universi
ties, said Kelly Naylor, SEAS co-coordinator.
SEAS has adopted a two-pronged strategy in
its current efforts, said Naylor. "We are trying to
influence from an investment standpoint and try
ing to impact at the consumer level," she ex

plained. The attempt to block Taco Bell is part of
the latter effort.
The group is also supporting an ASSU resolu
tion asking Stanford to stop purchasing any prod
ucts made by corporations in Myanmar.
At the rally, SEAS coordinator Tim Knight
stressed the need to continue "to fight for corporate
responsibility." The organization plans to make a
presentation before a University advisory panel on
investment responsibility in the next few months.
After Knight's comments, the group observed a
moment of silence in remembrance of those who
have died fighting for democracy in Myanmar.
The supporters then took the petition, contain
ing more than 2,000 signatures collected during
the past week, to Dean of Students Marc Wais. The
petition urged the University to reconsider any de
cision to place Taco Bell in Tresidder as well as its
involvement more generally with companies oper
ating in Myanmar.
"We urge [the University] to remove Taco Bell
from the list and look into other possibilities," said
SEAS co-coordinator Jason Burnett as he handed
over the signatures.
Stressing the broad support from the Stanford
community, he added that "about 80 percent of the
people [who were approached] were willing to sign
the petition. This is a very dramatic number."
Office staff accepted the petition on behalf of
Wais, who was out of town at a conference.
SEAS members said they are not certain about
the status of the Taco Bell.
