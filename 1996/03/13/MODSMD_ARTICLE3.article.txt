Next time CNN shows President Clinton jog
ging, look for the Stanford insignia on his outfit.
While driving the presidential and vice-presiden
tial motorcades during Clinton's visit to the Bay
Area on Saturday, members of the Stanford Democ
rats presented a few token gifts to the U.S. leader.
Stanford Democrats co-chairs Bill Shen and
Maria Bleavins, both sophomores, offered Clinton
a Stanford baseball cap, and sophomore Rebecca
Bowen gave him a pair of running shorts.
Bowen explained that shorts made perfect sense
"since I know he jogs and I thought they might
even be useful."
The president proved to be glad to receive the
gifts.
"Clinton and I had a conversation — really, re
ally short, of course — about the shorts and the
weather in D.C.," Bowen said.
Bleavins and Shen also got a chance to chat with
Clinton after offering the cap.
