Next time CNN shows President Clinton jog
ging, look for the Stanford insignia on his outfit.
While driving the presidential and vice-presiden
tial motorcades during Clinton's visit to the Bay
Area on Saturday, members of the Stanford Democ
rats presented a few token gifts to the U.S. leader.
Stanford Democrats co-chairs Bill Shen and
Maria Bleavins, both sophomores, offered Clinton
a Stanford baseball cap, and sophomore Rebecca
Bowen gave him a pair of running shorts.
Bowen explained that shorts made perfect sense
"since I know he jogs and I thought they might
even be useful."
The president proved to be glad to receive the
gifts.
"Clinton and I had a conversation — really, re
ally short, of course — about the shorts and the
weather in D.C.," Bowen said.
Bleavins and Shen also got a chance to chat with
Clinton after offering the cap.

President Clinton greets onlookers Saturday at the Buchanan Field Airport as part of
his visit to Concord. Clinton was in town for NetDay96, a statewide event for which
volunteers helped schools get hooked up to the Internet.
"Maria and I introduced our
selves, and on behalf of the Stan
ford Democrats, we presented him
with the cap," Shen recalled. "I
suggested to him that it would
come in handy during his golf
match with the lieutenant gover
nor (Gray Davis) that afternoon.
After putting it on, 1 told him that
it was a great fit, which it was."
Bleavins was impressed with
the president's relaxed attitude.
"He put the cap on and then he put
his arm around me," she said.
"That made it so personal."
The presidential entourage
likes to involve students in the
area it is visiting, Shen said.
About 40 Stanford students
were involved, six in the vice-pres
idential motorcade, 14 in the pres
idential motorcade and 20 staffing
the NetDay96 event in Concord
where Clinton and Vice President
A 1 Gore were speaking.
Clinton spoke to a crowd of at
least 20,000 at Ygnacio Valley
High School, a school participat

ing in the effort to get educational
institutions across the state
hooked up to the Internet. He also
helped wire a classroom there.
Early last week, Bleavins submit
ted the names of the participating
Stanford Democrats to the White
House, which completed security
checks before the Saturday event.
Security checks at the event
were rigorous, Shen said, pointing
to the three hours of preparation
necessary before the president
was driven only 200 yards from a
helicopter to a hotel Friday night.
"Basically, we just drove some
people from one place to another,"
Shen said. "But for political
junkies, it was a thrilling opportu
nity to see what goes on behind the
scenes of a presidential visit."
The Stanford representatives
said Clinton and Gore were friend
ly and human.
"Regardless of how you stand
politically, you have to be in awe of
the president," Shen said. "In per
son, he commands respect — not
through intimidation but through
his caring attitude. He was so nor
mal, seemingly someone you can
hangout with."
