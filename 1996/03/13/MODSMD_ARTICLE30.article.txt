Addressing current issues of
racial diversity and affirmative ac
tion, activist Tim Wise debated mul
ticulturalism with sophomore
Bruce Gibney and junior JefTGiesea
in Roble lounge on Friday night.
The topic of the debate was "Is
the current critique of multicul
turalism a racist backlash or a
needed insight?" About 50 stu
dents attended the discussion,
which was sponsored by The
Thinker, Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford, The
Stanford Review and the White
Anti-Racist Project of California.
Wise, a white anti-racist activist,
said that while critics of multicul
turalism may have good intentions,
the criticism has the negative effect
of creating a racist backlash.
"The intents of the people who
are involved in the backlash are
not necessarily racist," Wise said,

"and it would be simplistic for me
to argue that all who criticize mul
ticulturalism are racists."
However, Wise argued, current
policies of racial diversity, while
not perfect, are necessary because
"if you do not have affirmative ac
tion or multiculturalism to cush
ion the blow of civil society, what
are you going to replace it with?"
Giesea questioned the validity
of assisting certain minorities at
the expense of other groups.
Instead of admitting students
to a university on the basis of race,
Giesea proposed looking for other
solutions that would create a level
playing field without favoring one
side over the other.
Wise rebutted Giesea's state
ment, asking what society should
tell this generation of minorities.
"Are we going to say to them,
'You're . . . out of luck?' " Wise
asked. " 'Maybe your children will
have better schools. Too bad for
you. Now go wash my windows.' "

Gibney challenged Wise's
premise that government can
"legislate racism away," arguing
that "we feel compelled to force
others to learn what they don't
want to learn."
Gibney also criticized the psy
chological effects that affirmative
action can have on acceptances to
colleges.
"When you go to the mailbox
and pick up your acceptance," Gib
ney said, "do you want to think, 'I
was accepted because I did well and
have a unique cultural experience,'
or do you want to say, 'Dean [of Un
dergraduate Admissions James]
Montoya knows I'm black?' "
In rebuttal, Wise cited various
scholarships available to groups as
diverse as Tupperware dealers and
children of Confederate soldiers.
"There's no complaint that
they're having a damage to their
self-esteem," Wise said. "It's only
black and Hispanic people who
(people say) have this problem."
