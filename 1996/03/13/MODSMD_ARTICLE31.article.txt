## Bespectacled owls help researchers understand learning

Owls with glasses are helping re
searchers at Stanford better understand
how learning takes place.
Daniel Feldman, a graduate student
in the Neurosciences Program, placed
prisms over the birds' eyes which shifted
their vision about 20 degrees to the side.
This changed the nature of their visual
input and forced their brains to adjust by
building neural connections that could
respond properly to the new conditions.
Feldman was able to study the underly
ing mechanisms of this development by
examining the neurons' reactions to
noise because sight and sound detection
are intimately connected in the owls'
brains.
"Our objective was to study the chem
ical and physical changes of the neurons
as they learned to respond to modified
stimuli," Feldman said.
"Owls use an intra-aural timing dif
ference to form a mental map of their
world," said Feldman. They can exploit
the fact that sounds reach each ear at dif
ferent times, depending on the position

of the source.
For example, if a noise comes from di
rectly in front, it will reach both ears at
the same time. If however the sound
comes from the left side, it will reach the
left ear a fraction of a second before it
reaches the right ear. The brain process
es the time difference to localize the exact
relative position of the source. "This
gives them an edge for hunting prey at
night," Feldman said.
This relationship between sight and
sound localization also aided the re
searchers in their study.
"Through precise control of the audi
tory stimuli, we found a new function for
one of the receptors that sits on the
nerve cell's surface, the NMDA recep
tor," said Eric Knudsen, professor of
neurobiology.
"We found that when this receptor is
inhibited, the cell cannot express the
learned response; when the receptor is
uninhibited, the learned response is ex
pressed. This clearly shows that the
NMDA receptor is essential not only for
activating the learning process, but also
for its expression," Knudsen said.

Neurons interact with other neurons
at junctions where they transmit impuls
es. The NMDA receptors, along with
other types of receptors, lie on the sur
face of the cells and receive signals from
nearby neurons through chemical mes
sengers called neurotransmitters. This
close communication is the basis for the
electrical wiring of the brain.
Owls store a spatial map of their sur
roundings in a specific region of the
brain. After a few weeks of receiving al
tered visual input, the neurons in this
area learn to respond to stimuli that ap
pear to be coming from different posi
tions in space than they used to, Feldman
said.
At first, the owls were confused by
their new perspective. Within a short
time, however, the owls adapted and
were able to fly, eat, sleep and even lay
eggs while wearing glasses, Feldman
said.
The brain activity experienced a simi
lar adjustment. The neurons initially
continued to express the previously nor
mal response to specific noises. However
they soon underwent a transition such

that the normal response and the newly
learned response were both expressed,
Feldman reported.
The researchers studied the brains
during the transition period, introducing
controlled bursts of noise directly into
the owls' ears and observing the corre
sponding brain activity using electrodes
applied directly to the neurons. They also
applied controlled doses of specific drugs
to watch the neurons' response when in
teracting with the drug.
They found that when they applied a
drug that specifically knocked out the
NMDA receptors, the cell did not express
the new, learned response. Only the old,
incorrect response was expressed. How
ever, when they removed the drug, the
learned response reappeared. This dis
crimination occurred only with com
pounds that inhibited the NMDA recep
tors. Other, more general drugs did not
have the same effect.
"There are still questions as to
whether the change in response is due to
an increase in the number of receptors on
the cell or if it is something else altogeth
er," Knudsen said. "We are currently

doing more work to help resolve this
issue."
The same receptor lies in human
brains and is thought to play a similar
role. The pathway studied is located in
the forebrain and controls our response
to loud sudden sounds that probably de
serve our immediate attention, Knudsen
said.
Knudsen also explained why owl
brains were good models for understand
ing human learning. "Both owls and peo
ple have stationary ears, meaning we
can't twitch and turn our ears like cats
are able to. Both are excellent at localiz
ing sound. And we have yet to find a func
tional difference between owls and mam
mals in terms of sound localization and
gaze control."
However, the pathway for learning is
still unclear. "This is only one step in a
mechanism where most other steps are
not yet known," Feldman stressed.
"Though this knowledge could eventual
ly lead to means of treatment for things
like learning disabilities, that day is a
long way away. This is only the begin
ning."
