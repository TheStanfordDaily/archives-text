## New treatments for lymphoma explored 
### Libusha Kelly Editorial staff 
A promising new form of
treatment for lymphoma may
one day have cancer patients re
ceiving outpatient therapy with
few side effects, according to re
searchers at the Medical Center.
"I think eventually this will
be available in the community
and widely used," said Susan
Knox, assistant professor of ra
diation oncology, and lead au
thor of a new paper on the
study. "Hopefully in about two
to four years."
Cancer patients are often
forced to use a host of physically
harmful treatments such as radia
tion and chemotherapy to treat
their diseases. Hair loss, weight
loss and nausea are common in
patients who undergo chemother
apy, according to Knox. However,
the new treatment, called ra
dioimmunotherapy, seems to
avoid such problems.
"For the most part (the pa
tients) were completely asymp
tomatic. They felt well and were
able to go about their normal
lives," Knox said. "They said it
was much milder than the
chemotherapy they had done."
The study was done with 18
patients who had low- to mid
range cases of the cancer. All of
the patients had already gone
through other forms of treat
ment which did not succeed in
eradicating the cancer before
participating in the study.
Thirteen of the patients saw
some reduction in the size and
number of their tumors. In six
patients, the tumors disap
peared entirely.
While the study looks ex
tremely promising, Medicine
Prof. Ronald Levy, a researcher
on the team, said it will require
more testing before it is widely
available. "We need to know
how well it really does work in
larger numbers of subjects. It's
too early to know how beneficial
it is."
Radioimmunotherapy in

volves targeting the radiation
treatment to cancer cells only.
Ideally, this means that sur
rounding cells would not be af
fected or damaged by the treat
ment. This is in contrast to tra
ditional chemotherapy, which
is often toxic to healthy cells as
well as cancerous ones.
Lymphoma is a condition in
which the lymph nodes produce
cancerous cells as well as stan
dard immune system cells.
Most of the cancer cells are con
centrated in the lymph nodes,
however some are found in the
bloodstream.
In order to best target cancer
cells, the radioactive isotope
used to kill the cancer cells,
called yttrium-90, is attached to
an antibody which recognizes
and binds only to cancer cells.
The cells are highly sensitive
to radiation, making this thera
py very effective. "Lymphoma
is very radiosensitive. The can
cer cells can't repair radiation
well at all, so they are killed.
Solid tumors are more resistant
to killing," Knox said.
Knox said the most signifi
cant side effect of the treatment
was that white blood cell counts,
which protect against infection,
dropped in most patients.
Further studies to assess the
safety and effectiveness of this
treatment are ongoing at Stan
ford, Knox said. According to
both Levy and Knox, other
studies which have used ra
dioimmunotherapy on solid tu
mors have not been as promis
ing as those for lymphoma, but
research continues.
Levy said he believes the
treatment will eventually be an
option on its own for lymphoma
patients, but there is still work
to be done. "Gradually, it will be
worked up to a front line treat
ment. But it can't just have
fewer side effects, it also has to
work better."
Knox is optimistic about the
therapy and its development.
"The results have been really en
couragingand exciting," she said.
