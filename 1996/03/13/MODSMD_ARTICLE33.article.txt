# Annual 'Graduate' showing canceled
## Seniors bemoan lost tradition, say there's no substitute for final flick 
### Sarah Katz Senior staff writer 
It's as Stanford as the Big Game Bonfire,
and it's about to go the same way.
In a blow to tradition, the annual Sunday
Flicks showing of the movie "The Graduate"
has been canceled pending renegotiation of the
film's distribution rights.
Flicks Manager Craig Zajac said his distrib
utor's contract to release the film for public
showing expired recently, and it is uncertain
when, or even if, a new contract will be final
ized.
"I don't think anyone's really in a big hurry
to get the distribution rights back," Zajac said
of his distributor, Films Inc. "Nobody really
rents it but us."
To compound the problem, there is an un
certainty as to who actually owns the film be
cause the original producer, Embassy Pic
tures, has gone out of business, Zajac said.
Without knowing this information, Zajac can
not acquire the movie in any other way, he
added.
"The only phone number I can find is

some company in France," he said. "I even
called the American Film Institute to try to
find out who has the rights. ... I have not
been able to find anyone with access to the
entire movie."
"The Graduate" stars a young Dustin
Hoffman as a recent, directionless college
graduate who is seduced by Mrs. Robinson,
one of his parents' friends, as he tries to ad
just to the adult world. It has been shown as
the last movie of spring quarter for years,
with seniors in cap and gown getting in for
free.
Though nobody seems to know when the
tradition started, Assoc. Dean of Undergradu
ate Admissions Jon Reider, a Stanford history
buff, noted that the showing "probably started
in the '70s. It seems to have been an institution
since at least the '80s."
To find a suitable replacement, Zajac said
he plans to let the final movie be "seniors'
choice" — a movie chosen through voting
over the first three weeks of spring quarter.
Seniors in cap and gown will still have free
entrance.
"It's still going to be pretty much a party,"

he said. "It's just the movie on the screen will
happen to be a little different."
But many seniors, bemoaning the loss of an
other tradition, said nothing can substitute for
the real thing.
"I have not seen 'The Graduate' at all and I
have been waiting four years to see it. Now I'm
really upset," said Melissa Bloom. "It sounds
pathetic, but it's true."
"To say I'm disappointed puts it mildly,"
said Eric Bauer. "The top choice [of voting se
niors] is going to be 'The Graduate.' "
Zajac said renting the video and showing it
on a big screen is also out of the question, since
he would still need to acquire public showing
rights.
"I can't get the rights to show it publicly,
and we're a little too big to get away with"
showing it illegally, he said.
But others said Zajac shouldn't worry too
much about legality. "You can pretty much
get anything you want if you try hard
enough," said senior Jon Toma. "I think he
could find a 'gray-market' environment
where the film would be available — like
China."
