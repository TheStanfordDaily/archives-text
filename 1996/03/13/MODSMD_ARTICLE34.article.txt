# University settling lawsuit over patent
## 
### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
The University last week
quickly settled a lawsuit against a
Florida electrical engineering
company it accused of using an en
gineering professor's patented
discovery in its products.
The terms of the settlement
with Harris Corp., formerly RCA
Corp., were not released, but the
University originally sought "mil
lions" when the suit was first filed
in 1994, a University attorney told
The Daily at the time.
The two sides met just once
last month before reaching the
deal, said University General
Counsel Michael Roster. Almost
two years had passed since the
suit was filed.
"We're pleased with the out
come," Roster said. "Litigation is
expensive and it wasn't serving ei
ther side's business purposes."
In 1978, the University
patented devices called insulated

gate bipolar transistors, compli
cated current-controlling devices
used in products ranging from
washing machines to power
plants. The discovery and subse
quent patent belonged to Electri
cal Engineering Prof. James
Plummer.
The University's research poli
cy mandates that rights to any dis
covery made at Stanford will be
shared by the researcher and the
University.
The University had planned to
license Plummer's discovery to a
number of companies, said Mona
Wan, the associate in the Office of
Technology Licensing responsible
for the discovery. When Harris
Corp. used the technology without
the license, the University filed
the breach of patent suit in March
1994.
The University receives more
than $31 million each year from li
censing fees.
Officials at Harris Corp. could
not be reached for comment.
