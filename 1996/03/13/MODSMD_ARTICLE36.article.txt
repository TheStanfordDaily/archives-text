# Is there life after college?
## New book offers tips for securing that dream job

Senior Bliss Temple believes
that deciding what to do after col
lege is like standing in an airport
and trying to choose which plane
to take.
"It's not like I want to go to
Houston, but even so, there might
be something great there," she
said.
Temple, who is double majoring
in public policy and earth systems,
plans to co-term next year. Since
she didn't declare earth systems
until this fall, Temple said she
needs the extra time to fulfill that
major to her satisfaction.
Senior Jeff Lai, on the other
hand, has gone through job appli
cations and interviews in order to
get a job in the field of information
technology consulting. He com
mented on the difficulty of choos
ing a job that fits the individual.
"In every major, there's always
the glamorous jobs, the jobs that
everybody wants," he said. "Stop
and ask yourself, 'Is that what I re
ally want? Does that fit my
lifestyle? Would I really be happy
doing that?' "
Sven Newman hopes to provide
creative career options and in
sights to college students and re
cent college graduates in his book,
"So. . . What Are You Doing After
College? Real-Life Advice from
People Who've Been There."
Newman, a 1991 graduate of
Brown University, said, "When I
was coming out of college, like
everybody else, I was relatively
panicked ... or extremely pan
icked." He found a job with a pub
lishing company and then went
into management consulting.

Newman explains in his book
that meeting with old friends and
talking about what everyone was
doing inspired him to collect sto
ries from recent graduates in
every field imaginable, from work
ing for a magazine to mountain
biking through Latin America.
He ended up with 25 different
stories, written by the graduates
themselves, divided into five cate
gories: creative careers, corporate
work, volunteering, graduate
school and traveling. Each selection
consists of a description of the job,
the pros and cons, the author's per
sonal experience and resources for
students interested in such a job.
Newman's objectives, he said,
were "to provide clarity on the op
tions that people immediately
think of' and "to give students
and recent grads a taste of how
many options are out there."
Newman said he hopes to con
vey the message, "Look, I'm only a
year or two out of college. This is
where you could be a year from
now."
To find people with all types of
jobs and experiences, including
three Stanford graduates and one
Stanford graduate student, New
man looked in alumni newspapers
and magazines, asked colleges
what their recent graduates were
doing and talked to friends about
people they knew.
Newman found Daniel Baer,
currently a candidate for a mas
ter's degree in filmmaking, during
a coffee break one morning while
he was working on the book. New
man said he was walking down the
street to find coffee when Baer
stopped him and asked him to play
the part of a bicycle thief in his

first documentary film.
They started talking, and New
man found out that Baer had par
ticipated in Volunteers in Service
to America, or VISTA. Newman
then asked Baer to write about his
experience in the book.
Baer said he applied to VTSTA,
now a part of Americorps, out of a
feeling of idealism and a desire to
help the community. He spent his
year in VISTA working for the
AIDS Foundation in San Antonio,
receiving a small stipend.
His job was to develop a pro
gram in writing grants, but in his
essay in the book, Baer said the job
also entailed personal interaction
with clients of the foundation. "I
saw it as part of my express pur
pose to eat lunch with the clients,
to get to know them and to learn to
care about them as individuals."
"All of these people and dozens
more, most of whom have died
now, have shaped my outlook on
life," Baer wrote. "VISTA provides
an entree into communities that
few recent college graduates
would otherwise come to know
from the inside."
Newman said he hopes that
Baer's story inspires other college
graduates to take on similar pro
jects. "Maybe there's an adven
ture in the back of your mind,"
Newman said.
College graduates can hear
about an entirely different post-col
lege route by reading about the ex
perience of Nat Cousins, who went
to Hastings Law School after grad
uating from Stanford in 1992.
Cousins said he had known since
high school that he wanted to be
come a lawyer. "People are very
fearful of law school," Cousins

says. "Most of the anx
iety is self-created —
but perhaps unavoid
able."
Cousins now works
as a litigator in enter
tainment law. He said
his firm negotiates con
tracts between actors
and directors or fulfills
any legal obligations
for people involved in
the entertainment in
dustry. Next year he
will work as a law clerk
for a federal judge.
"Still," he said, "1
don't know what I'm
going to do with the
rest of my life." But he
does not seem to be
worried. "Things *
take care of them-

selves. That's a
healthy perspective — a very Stan
ford perspective."
Two other Stanford graduates,
Samantha Sherman and Amy Dal
ton, whose stories also appear in
Newman's book, seem to agree.
Dal ton majored in American Stud
ies, which she described as "an
amorphous major without train
ing for anything." Dalton said she
wanted a job in advertising, pub
lishing or public relations, but
that it was not easy to find.
"The [Career Planning and
Placement Center] isn't necessari
ly set up for people who aren't
looking for jobs in investment
banking or management consult
ing," Dalton said.
Dalton said she answered an ad
she found in the paper. "I was told
you never get a job from looking in
the paper. But I did." Although the

publishing company she applied to
did not hire her immediately, com
pany officials kept her resume on file
and six months afler graduation of
fered her a job different from the one
for which she had initially applied.
Dalton worked as the publish
er's secretary and organized con
ferences for the product manager.
She has since moved to Harper
Collins, where she works as a pub
licist and plans author tours.
Dalton said the tools she gained
from her first job helped her get
her current job. "Things tend to
work out — not in ways that you
think they will, but they do. ... If
you just keep working at it, doors
open."
Sherman has made her way in
the door in broadcast news, but
things did not look so good for a
while. "It was maddeningand it was

terrifying. Almost everyone I knew
had jobs lined up or projects lined
up or something. I had nothing."
But a month after graduation,
she was offered an interview and
then a job as a production assis
tant in broadcast news, in re
sponse to a call she had placed
about a flier she saw at the CPPC.
Sherman now works as an associ
ate producer for a Sacramento
television station.
She said she misses college be
cause she no longer has all of her
friends around and she lacks the
security of those four years, but
she loves her work.
"I enjoy what I do and I'm pas
sionate about the media," Sher
man said. "It's important that you
like the work and that you do what
makes you happy, even if it's not
the norm for Stanford graduates."
