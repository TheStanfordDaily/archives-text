# Ruling may decrease course reader prices
## 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
A recent federal court ruling against the
right of publishers to collect royalties for
course reader materials could significantly de
crease their price for students.
However, professors and publishers would
bear the brunt of the change as a result of last
month's ruling by the Sixth Circuit Court in
Michigan.
At Stanford, the case could mean a 50 percent
reduction in the price of the average course read
er, according to Stanford Bookstore Course Ma
terials Manager Hani Sayegh.
In the case, Princeton University Press sued
Michigan Document Services, a copying service
that specializes in producing course readers,
for not asking permission or paying fees for the
use of copyrighted materials in course readers.
Michigan Document contended it was not
necessary to ask the publisher for permission
or pay a fee because of the "fair use" section of
the federal Copyright Act.
The "fair use" clause lists several circum
stances under which it is permissible to use copy
righted materials without obtaining permission.
These include "criticism, comment, news report
ing, teaching (including multiple copies for class
room use) scholarship or research."

At present the ruling is only binding in
Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.
However, the Association of American Pub
lishers is appealing the ruling to both the same
court and the U.S. Supreme Court.
This means the ruling is not actually in force
yet anywhere, Sayegh said. He said the appeal
probably wouldn't be heard until at least this
spring.
There is also a ruling still in effect from 1994
that favors the publishers in a similar case.
However, publishers, bookstores, authors
and lawyers are all considering what it might
mean if the ruling against the publishers stands.
Sayegh said an exemption for course readers
from copyright restrictions "would be a wonder
ful thing." Along with the expense of paying roy
alties, obtaining permission is extremely time
consuming, often taking up to a month, he said.
Jim Smith, president of Michigan Document,
saw the decision as an important and very positive
change for the way course materials are made.
"What has been business as usual for the
last five years has been terrorism on the part of
publishing companies," Smith said, explaining
that publishing companies had successfully
used the threat to sue, "even though the law
does not support their position. ... They are
wrong, and what they are doing is dramatically
hurting education."

Regarding the loss of royalties to authors,
Smith said the effect would not be great. He es
timated that publishers received $10 million
annually from the makers of course readers, of
which about half went to authors.
"You divide $5 million among the hundreds
of thousands of authors out there, and how
much does that mean?" Smith asked.
He also said he had proof that publishing
companies frequently defrauded authors of
these royalties, small though they were. He said
he had obtained the support of 165 authors, who
said their purpose in publishing was to share
their work with as many people as possible.
Not everyone sees the development as entirely
positive. Michael Roster, Stanford's general coun
sel, said the ruling has both good and bad effects.
"We at the University have interests on
both sides," he explained. While he acknowl
edged that it was "very much in our interest for
our faculty to be able to put together course
materials," he was concerned about the impli
cations for university presses.
"The university presses are barely eking out
a living," Roster said.
Royalties to authors often do not amount to
much money, he said, but printing academic
books that have a narrow appeal is rarely cost-ef
fective. Without royalties, university presses may
find it difficult to produce the same variety.
