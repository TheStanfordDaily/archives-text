# End of the quarter excuses
## 
### 
I haven't been to Econ 52 since January.
I'm not implying that this is good
behavior or bad behavior, I'm simply,
out-and-out, stating a fact: Econ 52 makes
me want to vomit.
Or at least it did in January.
I'm riding the mean as far as grades go, so
I'm not worried about that (can you say,
'Pass/No Clue?'), but it just hit me that at
some point someone is going to ask me to fill
out a few blue books showing my vast knowl
edge of macroeconomics, and all I'm gonna
be able to do is draw a few multi-colored
graphs and pretend I know what the letters
stand for. I'll be given questions about
Keynes and the Real Business Cycle and the
IS-LM graph relating aggregate income and
expenditure to the real interest rate.
Better those questions than asking me
things like: In what room does this class
meet every day at 9 o'clock in the morning?
And, can you spell the professor's name
correctly?
Should 1 feel guilty about not going to
class? Should I believe the urban legend
that every skipped lecture costs me $65 in
cash and prizes and that over the course of
the quarter I've lost a kazillion dollars for a
class that's just too early in the morning?
Should I feel guilty that I'm working on
Diversions instead of doing my statistics
"computational exercise? "
Guilty? Nah. Guilt is highly overrated
(Sorry, Mom). Why feel bad about missing
class? I mean, isn't Res Ed based on the
fact that we learn more outside the class
room than we learn inside the classroom?
So, ifyou really think about it, I'm learning
more bv sleeping an extra hour in my resi
dence than if I dragged myself down to the

Quad (or is it Kresge?) to listen to someone
talk about graphs and curves and changes
in the syllabus.
Rationalization sure is fun when done
correctly.
The whole P NC thing changes every
thing too. (Actually, it's called CR NC now
that they've "improved" the grading sys
tem. Great name change, guys, about as
clever as changing "Pro Pros" to
"Admits.") Taking a class just to squeak by
has a liberating effect on your attention
span. Suddenly, the third page of a lengthy
problem set is just not that important when
it's "Time Travel Week" on "Late Night
with Conan O'Brien." Those are the times
when you don't even bother to fake the
answers — you just ignore numbers seven
through nine altogether, thinking: "Yeah,
the TA'll see no red marks at the end and
assume I got no points off! Full credit!"
Rationalization and final grade apathy
are taught to all Stanford students through
a year-long class known as CIV — ever
heard of it? I think it's cross-listed as Lec
ture-Skipping 101: You'll (n't That B + /A-
No Matter What You I)o.
By the time we're received our 15 units
of B+/A-, we've perfected the art of ratio
nalization. "It's too early in the morning,"
and "I'm taking it P NC" become child's
play. New rationales are required, such as:
"But it's only worth 4.2 percent of the final
grade!" or "That C+ is because I don't
write in his stupid style" or "Why go to
class? I'm just gonna end up photocopying
someone's ASSU Lecture Notes anyway."
Rationalization is a good thing and all
when done correctly, but maybe we do too
much of it. I think what I'm trying to say is

that, as a whole, we spend too much time
rationalizing our procrastination and class
skipping, and not enough time actually pro
crastinating and skipping class. This is the
perfect example of Stanford students talk
ing about something and just not doing it.
So here is my solution: Let's just do it.
Procrastinate. Skip class. Don't bother
showing your work. Then we can just get
on with our lives. Don't complain for two
hours about a paper due tomorrow
accept your procrastination and watch
"Strictly Ballroom" one more time. Don't
whine for a half an hour that your problem
set is just too long — play some Sega. Don't
go to that 9 a.m. class — sleep in and reap
the benefits of an extra hour of rewarding
shut-eye surrounded by a residence full of
peers selected for their diversity and
accepting multicultural outlook.
And if you do go to class, could you do me
a favor? Could you find out what room the
final exam is in? Thanks.

Editor's Note: This is the last Diversions page of
the quarter, kids! Not to worry, we'll be back
soon with our Spring Quarter Premeire. But if
you get desperate over Break, just call the Diver
sions Hot Line: 497-1627 Ask for the guy in the
funny hat.
