## Native American Studies minor added 
### Marni Leff Contributing writer 
The University committee
charged with creating the Com
parative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity program revealed specifics
about the proposal on Monday but
said the final product may not be
in place until fall of 1997.
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo,
who chairs the committee, told a
group of 20 people that students
will be able to minor and possibly
major in Native American Studies
when the CSRE program is imple
mented. Camarillo also said stu
dents who want to major in
African and Afro-American Stud
ies will not have to take the core
courses required in the CSRE cur
riculum, a change from the initial
plan.
In addition, Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven clarified yesterday that
Chicano Studies, Afro-American
Studies and Asian-American
Studies will likely be considered
majors, not concentrations within
the CSRE major.
"While the design has changed
in the actual implementation of
the program, we haven't changed
the views about it," Shoven said.
"It's still going to be innovative

with an emphasis on issues and so
cial sciences."
Program outlined
At Monday night's meeting,
Camarillo outlined the program's
structure for the first time.
Fielding questions about differ
ent components of the program,
Camarillo explained that students
either majoring or minoring in all
the areas except Afro-American
Studies will be required to go
through a core of CSRE classes â€”
three courses are required to
major, two to minor.
Because the Afro-American
Studies program has a long histo
ry at Stanford, Camarillo ex
plained, students will be given the
option but will not be required to
take CSRE courses.
Camarillo explained that the di
rectors of each of the ethnic stud
ies programs as well as the direc
tor of the comparative studies
component of CSRE will sit on a
steering committee responsible
for coordinating the program.
"The steering committee will
not be a governing body," Camar
illo said. "With CSRE each pro
gram will still retain its own in
tegrity and its own autonomy.
