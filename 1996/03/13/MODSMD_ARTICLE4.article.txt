# Ethnic studies major outlined
## Native American Studies minor added 
### Marni Leff Contributing writer 
The University committee
charged with creating the Com
parative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity program revealed specifics
about the proposal on Monday but
said the final product may not be
in place until fall of 1997.
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo,
who chairs the committee, told a
group of 20 people that students
will be able to minor and possibly
major in Native American Studies
when the CSRE program is imple
mented. Camarillo also said stu
dents who want to major in
African and Afro-American Stud
ies will not have to take the core
courses required in the CSRE cur
riculum, a change from the initial
plan.
In addition, Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven clarified yesterday that
Chicano Studies, Afro-American
Studies and Asian-American
Studies will likely be considered
majors, not concentrations within
the CSRE major.
"While the design has changed
in the actual implementation of
the program, we haven't changed
the views about it," Shoven said.
"It's still going to be innovative

with an emphasis on issues and so
cial sciences."
Program outlined
At Monday night's meeting,
Camarillo outlined the program's
structure for the first time.
Fielding questions about differ
ent components of the program,
Camarillo explained that students
either majoring or minoring in all
the areas except Afro-American
Studies will be required to go
through a core of CSRE classes —
three courses are required to
major, two to minor.
Because the Afro-American
Studies program has a long histo
ry at Stanford, Camarillo ex
plained, students will be given the
option but will not be required to
take CSRE courses.
Camarillo explained that the di
rectors of each of the ethnic stud
ies programs as well as the direc
tor of the comparative studies
component of CSRE will sit on a
steering committee responsible
for coordinating the program.
"The steering committee will
not be a governing body," Camar
illo said. "With CSRE each pro
gram will still retain its own in
tegrity and its own autonomy.
Each individual program will have
a faculty / student committee to
oversee it."
The planning committee is in
the process of preparing a formal
proposal to send to Shoven and the
associate dean in Humanities and
Sciences, Camarillo said. It will
later be reviewed by the Dean's
Advisory Committee on the Cur
riculum, the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, the senate's Steering
Committee and finally the senate
as a whole.
"If we can't make it to the Facul
ty Senate by the end of the year, at
least the proposal will go to the Fac
uity Senate in the very beginning of
next autumn," Camarillo said.
The chances that the CSRE
proposal will make it through all

the committees in time to be put
on the agenda for the senate's last
meeting this year, Camarillo said,
are about 50 percent.
"If we don't meet that dead
line," Camarillo said, "the CSRE
program won't be able to start this
fall and it is unlikely that it could
start in the middle of the year, so
we're looking at the fall of 1997."
Adding that he will do his best
to make sure the proposal moves
quickly through the dean's office,
Shoven said he has not given up on
the idea of having the CSRE pro
gram in place this fall.
"I am really pushing for speed,"
Shoven said. "I think it's definitely
stretching it, but I think we can get
it done this year. If we fail, we fail,
but I think there is still a chance."
Native American Studies added
Camarillo said there is a good
chance that Native American
Studies could be offered as a major

within the CSRE program.
Initially, Native American
Studies was not going to be includ
ed in the CSRE major, although
there was a possibility to add the
program later.
"The charge of the committee
was to talk about what had already
developed in committees looking at
Asian-American and Chicano
Studies and talk about how they
would fit with CSRE," Camarillo
said. "It's natural then in that con
text of ethnic studies that Native
American Studies would come up."
A final decision on whether to
include a Native American Studies
major in the proposal has not yet
been made.
"We still haven't come to clo
sure on that issue," Camarillo said.
"The final decisions will be made
either at the end of this week or the
very beginning of spring quarter."
Camarillo added that Native
American Studies will definitely

be offered as a minor when the
CSRE program begins.
"I don't know if we will be able
to mount a major or not," Shoven
said. "A minor with the option for
an individually designed major is a
way to begin and then see how it
develops. If there is enough stu
dent interest and faculty re
sources, I think it's definitely
something worth doing."
The committee is reviewing al
ready existing classes that focus
on Native American issues.
"Native Americans are and
have been for the last century a
huge part of the anthropology pro
gram," Camarillo said. "The big
question is whether we can rea
sonably offer a big enough core of
classes to make Native Americans
Studies a major. There are defi
nitely enough courses right now
for it to be a minor."
Eighteen courses currently
exist that either focus on or devote

significant amounts of time to Na
tive American issues. With a new
Native American professor start
ing next fall in the Department of
Sociology, Camarillo said, at least
one and possibly two additional
classes will be offered.
Separation
With Afro-American Studies ma
jors no longer required to take the
CSRE core, students involved are
more optimistic about the program.
However, they remain con
cerned that the Afro-American
Studies program will eventually
lose its independence. In addition,
students worry that by making re
quirements different for one
major, the University is creating
tension among ethnic groups.
"When I first heard about
CSRE my initial fear was that
Afro-American Studies would get
subsumed," said sophomore Ryan
Bathe, an Afro-American Studies

major. "That fear has been al
layed, but I'm still concerned.
"The attitude at the meeting
was, 'Don't worry, be happy.' I am
not going to drop my guard and em
brace this program with open
arms," she added. "I call it like I see
it and the way I see it is by making
the requirements different for Afro-
American Studies, we are being pit
ted against other groups and demo
nized again by the University."
The idea that all the ethnic pro
grams should be on an equal level,
Camarillo said, is one he finds
troublesome.
"1 don't know where that con
ception came from," Camarillo
said. "Theoretically, all the pro
grams are equal. Afro-American
Studies has a historical legacy be
cause it's the only program that
formerly offered a major and the
committee understands the need
to give it special consideration be
cause of that."

least the proposal will go to the Fac
uity Senate in the very beginning of
next autumn," Camarillo said.
The chances that the CSRE
proposal will make it through all

the committees in time to be put
on the agenda for the senate's last
meeting this year, Camarillo said,
are about 50 percent.
"If we don't meet that dead
line," Camarillo said, "the CSRE
program won't be able to start this
fall and it is unlikely that it could
start in the middle of the year, so
we're looking at the fall of 1997."
Adding that he will do his best
to make sure the proposal moves
quickly through the dean's office,
Shoven said he has not given up on
the idea of having the CSRE pro
gram in place this fall.
"I am really pushing for speed,"
Shoven said. "I think it's definitely
stretching it, but I think we can get
it done this year. If we fail, we fail,
but I think there is still a chance."
Native American Studies added
Camarillo said there is a good
chance that Native American
Studies could be offered as a major

within the CSRE program.
Initially, Native American
Studies was not going to be includ
ed in the CSRE major, although
there was a possibility to add the
program later.
"The charge of the committee
was to talk about what had already
developed in committees looking at
Asian-American and Chicano
Studies and talk about how they
would fit with CSRE," Camarillo
said. "It's natural then in that con
text of ethnic studies that Native
American Studies would come up."
A final decision on whether to
include a Native American Studies
major in the proposal has not yet
been made.
"We still haven't come to clo
sure on that issue," Camarillo said.
"The final decisions will be made
either at the end of this week or the
very beginning of spring quarter."
Camarillo added that Native
American Studies will definitely

be offered as a minor when the
CSRE program begins.
"I don't know if we will be able
to mount a major or not," Shoven
said. "A minor with the option for
an individually designed major is a
way to begin and then see how it
develops. If there is enough stu
dent interest and faculty re
sources, I think it's definitely
something worth doing."
The committee is reviewing al
ready existing classes that focus
on Native American issues.
"Native Americans are and
have been for the last century a
huge part of the anthropology pro
gram," Camarillo said. "The big
question is whether we can rea
sonably offer a big enough core of
classes to make Native Americans
Studies a major. There are defi
nitely enough courses right now
for it to be a minor."
Eighteen courses currently
exist that either focus on or devote

significant amounts of time to Na
tive American issues. With a new
Native American professor start
ing next fall in the Department of
Sociology, Camarillo said, at least
one and possibly two additional
classes will be offered.
Separation
With Afro-American Studies ma
jors no longer required to take the
CSRE core, students involved are
more optimistic about the program.
However, they remain con
cerned that the Afro-American
Studies program will eventually
lose its independence. In addition,
students worry that by making re
quirements different for one
major, the University is creating
tension among ethnic groups.
"When I first heard about
CSRE my initial fear was that
Afro-American Studies would get
subsumed," said sophomore Ryan
Bathe, an Afro-American Studies

major. "That fear has been al
layed, but I'm still concerned.
"The attitude at the meeting
was, 'Don't worry, be happy.' I am
not going to drop my guard and em
brace this program with open
arms," she added. "I call it like I see
it and the way I see it is by making
the requirements different for Afro-
American Studies, we are being pit
ted against other groups and demo
nized again by the University."
The idea that all the ethnic pro
grams should be on an equal level,
Camarillo said, is one he finds
troublesome.
"1 don't know where that con
ception came from," Camarillo
said. "Theoretically, all the pro
grams are equal. Afro-American
Studies has a historical legacy be
cause it's the only program that
formerly offered a major and the
committee understands the need
to give it special consideration be
cause of that."
The University committee
charged with creating the Com
parative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity program revealed specifics
about the proposal on Monday but
said the final product may not be
in place until fall of 1997.
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo,
who chairs the committee, told a
group of 20 people that students
will be able to minor and possibly
major in Native American Studies
when the CSRE program is imple
mented. Camarillo also said stu
dents who want to major in
African and Afro-American Stud
ies will not have to take the core
courses required in the CSRE cur
riculum, a change from the initial
plan.
In addition, Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven clarified yesterday that
Chicano Studies, Afro-American
Studies and Asian-American
Studies will likely be considered
majors, not concentrations within
the CSRE major.
"While the design has changed
in the actual implementation of
the program, we haven't changed
the views about it," Shoven said.
"It's still going to be innovative

with an emphasis on issues and so
cial sciences."
Program outlined
At Monday night's meeting,
Camarillo outlined the program's
structure for the first time.
Fielding questions about differ
ent components of the program,
Camarillo explained that students
either majoring or minoring in all
the areas except Afro-American
Studies will be required to go
through a core of CSRE classes —
three courses are required to
major, two to minor.
Because the Afro-American
Studies program has a long histo
ry at Stanford, Camarillo ex
plained, students will be given the
option but will not be required to
take CSRE courses.
Camarillo explained that the di
rectors of each of the ethnic stud
ies programs as well as the direc
tor of the comparative studies
component of CSRE will sit on a
steering committee responsible
for coordinating the program.
"The steering committee will
not be a governing body," Camar
illo said. "With CSRE each pro
gram will still retain its own in
tegrity and its own autonomy.
Each individual program will have
a faculty / student committee to
oversee it."
The planning committee is in
the process of preparing a formal
proposal to send to Shoven and the
associate dean in Humanities and
Sciences, Camarillo said. It will
later be reviewed by the Dean's
Advisory Committee on the Cur
riculum, the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, the senate's Steering
Committee and finally the senate
as a whole.
"If we can't make it to the Facul
ty Senate by the end of the year, at
least the proposal will go to the Fac
uity Senate in the very beginning of
next autumn," Camarillo said.
The chances that the CSRE
proposal will make it through all
