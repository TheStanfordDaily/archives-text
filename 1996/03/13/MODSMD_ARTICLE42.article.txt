# Protesters demand equality for local immigrant workers
## 
### Jenna Land Contributing writer 
Calling for increased public
awareness, more than 100 stu
dents, community members and
activists gathered Sunday at El
Camino Park in Palo Alto to
protest the treatment of immi
grant workers.
Protesters spent most of the
hour-long rally decrying the in
equities facing workers at the
Stanford Park Hotel and Hewlett-
Packard Co.
Workers for these two companies
face many injustices, UC—Berkeley
student Raquel Jimenez said.
"Their labor goes unrecog
nized; it is invisible," Jimenez
said. "Their work doesn't get as
much respect or (isn't) seen as im
portant as the workers in suits."
Protesters expressed anger
that the Stanford Park Hotel be
longs to the non-union Western
Lodging Group and that Hewlett-
Packard conducts business with
the union-busting janitorial firm,

Somers Building Maintenance.
Elaine Peterson, a representa
tive of the Hotel and Restaurant
Workers Union, said immigrants
are exploited because of their
background.
"Companies single them out
and give them the worst working
conditions as opposed to white
workers," she said.
The struggle, Jimenez said,
began when workers "started to try
and be recognized by the union."
Workers for the Western Lodg
ing Group, who asked to remain
anonymous, said their union in
volvement has made their employ
ers forbid that they speak on the
job. Workers said their fight is one
the community must participate
in because their own involvement
jeopardizes their jobs.
Freshman Deborah Orosz, who
is active in Resistance Action orGa
nizing Education (RAGE), agreed.
RAGE and the Ghicano / Latino
student group MEChA helped or
ganize Sunday's rally.
"As students at a highly respect-

Ed and powerful university we are
in a situation unique from that of
Stanford Park Hotel and Hewlett-
Packard workers," Orosz said. "We
can stand up to these businesses
without fear of risking our jobs,
money or personal safety."
Stanford, she continued, is in
volved with both companies.
"Stanford provides 75 percent of
the total business of the Stanford
Park Hotel," she said. Hewlett-
Packard actively recruits Stanford
graduates for employment and the
company's founders, David
Packard and William Hewlett, have
donated millions of dollars to the
University, Orosz added.
"I am enraged, as are other stu
dents and members of Stanford's
community, by my university's in
volvement with unethical corpora
tions such as these two," she said. "I
am enraged by the tactics of intimi
dation used by the Stanford Park
Hotel and by the insistence of
Hewlett-Packard to ignore and
therefore condone ill treatment and
manipulation of their employees."
