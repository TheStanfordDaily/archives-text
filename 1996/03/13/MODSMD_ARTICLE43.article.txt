## Cardinal basketball headed to Big Dance Women earn No. 1 seed in West Region 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
Last year, Vanderbilt and its six
losses stole a No. 1 seed from the 26-
2 Cardinal, clearly displeasing the
Stanford women's basketball squad.
This year, the Cardinal has no such
complaints.
In an anticlimactic announce
ment Sunday, third-ranked Stan
ford (25-2 overall, 18-0 Pacific 10
Conference) learned it had earned a
No. 1 seed in the West Region. How
ever, instead of facing Georgia, who
many felt would be shipped west as
the top No. 2 seed, Penn State (25-6,
13-3) will come west after winning
the Big Ten Conference tourna
ment.
"Obviously, I'm pleased and we
felt we deserved a No. 1 seed," said
head coach Amy Tucker. "I expected
it as I did last year and it didn't hap
pen. You just never know what
they're going to do with you."
The Cardinal will receive better
television exposure than any team in
the tournament, as it will be the only
team featured on ESPN for each of
its games. On Saturday, the
women's first-round subregional
contest with No. 16-seed Grambling
(21-6, 13-1 Southwestern Athletic)
will take place at 9:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion, with the late start courtesy
of television. At 7 p.m., Western Ath
letic Conference champion Colorado
State (25-4, 12-2 WAC) will take on
No. 9-seed Nebraska (19-9, 8-6 Big
8). The Saturday winners will battle
at Maples on Monday night at 9 p.m.
Stanford was just one of three
Pac-10 squads to make the cut, as
Oregon State (19-8,11-7) drew a No.
6 seed in the Midwest and Oregon
(18-10,10-8) earned the No. 11 spot
in the Mideast. Arizona (19-8, 10-8)
missed the field despite its most wins
ever.
To nobody's surprise, the SEC
sent a record-tying seven teams to

the tourney, while many felt LSU
(19-10) or Arkansas (20-11) was un
fairly snubbed. The Big Ten sent six
despite Northwestern's (21-10) ab
sence, while the ACC, Big Eight,
Southwest and Conference USA
sent four squads each. All except the
ACC are generally regarded as weak
er than the Pac-10, and Conference
USA teams received the Nos. 7, 8, 9
and 14 seeds.
Thirty-seven of the 64 squads in

the tourney were there last year, but
just seven of those are in the West,
the lowest total of the four regions.
Nine teams are making the journey
for the first time. The SEC's pres
ence permeates each region, but the
Cardinal does not lament taking on
Alabama or Auburn, the Nos. 4 and
6 seeds, respectively.
