## Cardinal basketball headed to Big Dance Women earn No. 1 seed in West Region 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
Last year, Vanderbilt and its six
losses stole a No. 1 seed from the 26-
2 Cardinal, clearly displeasing the
Stanford women's basketball squad.
This year, the Cardinal has no such
complaints.
In an anticlimactic announce
ment Sunday, third-ranked Stan
ford (25-2 overall, 18-0 Pacific 10
Conference) learned it had earned a
No. 1 seed in the West Region. How
ever, instead of facing Georgia, who
many felt would be shipped west as
the top No. 2 seed, Penn State (25-6,
13-3) will come west after winning
the Big Ten Conference tourna
ment.
"Obviously, I'm pleased and we
felt we deserved a No. 1 seed," said
head coach Amy Tucker. "I expected
it as I did last year and it didn't hap
pen. You just never know what
they're going to do with you."
The Cardinal will receive better
television exposure than any team in
the tournament, as it will be the only
team featured on ESPN for each of
its games. On Saturday, the
women's first-round subregional
contest with No. 16-seed Grambling
(21-6, 13-1 Southwestern Athletic)
will take place at 9:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion, with the late start courtesy
of television. At 7 p.m., Western Ath
letic Conference champion Colorado
State (25-4, 12-2 WAC) will take on
No. 9-seed Nebraska (19-9, 8-6 Big
8). The Saturday winners will battle
at Maples on Monday night at 9 p.m.
Stanford was just one of three
Pac-10 squads to make the cut, as
Oregon State (19-8,11-7) drew a No.
6 seed in the Midwest and Oregon
(18-10,10-8) earned the No. 11 spot
in the Mideast. Arizona (19-8, 10-8)
missed the field despite its most wins
ever.
To nobody's surprise, the SEC
sent a record-tying seven teams to

the tourney, while many felt LSU
(19-10) or Arkansas (20-11) was un
fairly snubbed. The Big Ten sent six
despite Northwestern's (21-10) ab
sence, while the ACC, Big Eight,
Southwest and Conference USA
sent four squads each. All except the
ACC are generally regarded as weak
er than the Pac-10, and Conference
USA teams received the Nos. 7, 8, 9
and 14 seeds.
Thirty-seven of the 64 squads in

the tourney were there last year, but
just seven of those are in the West,
the lowest total of the four regions.
Nine teams are making the journey
for the first time. The SEC's pres
ence permeates each region, but the
Cardinal does not lament taking on
Alabama or Auburn, the Nos. 4 and
6 seeds, respectively.
"I thought Georgia could be [sent

Kate Starbird and the third-ranked Stanford women have their eyes
on the Women's Final Four in Charlotte, N.C.
to the West]," Tucker said. "I'm
happy they're not. I expected either
Georgia or Alabama."
The Crimson Tide (22-7, 7-4
SEC) garnered a No. 10 ranking in
the latest Associated Press poll, tops
among the No. 4 seeds, while fifth
seeded North Carolina State (19-9,
10-6 ACC) has plummeted to 23rd,
its lowest position of the year.
Should Stanford advance to the
West Regional in Seattle on March
23 and 25 (Saturday and Monday),
one of these squads likely will match
up with the Cardinal.
On the lower half of the bracket,
Rene Portland and Penn State will
attempt to overcome recent disap
pointments in the tourney. The
ninth-ranked I.ady Lions feature a
great backcourt in Tina Nicholson
and Katina Mack but have been
plagued by numerous injuries in
their quest for their first Final Four
berth. year, the Lions were the
only top-four seed not to advance to
a subregional, losing to Kay Yow's
North Carolina State squad 76-74.
Penn State will face No. 15-seed
Youngstown State (20-8, 14-4 Mid-
Continent) in the first round, as the
Penguins make their first appear
ance in the NCAAs.
The weakest of the No. 3 seeds
could face Penn State in a regional
semifinal. Colorado (25-8,9-5 Big 8),
ranked 19th in the land prior to
stunning regular-season confer
ence-champion Kansas 75-47 in the
championship game of their tour
ney, has suffered from the losses of
Ail-American point guard Shelley
Sheetz and center Isabelle Fi
jalkowski to graduation. Ceal
Barry's squad racked up early wins
in the preseason NIT.
No. 6 seed Auburn is the only
squad in the West Stanford has
faced this season, defeating the

Tigers 63-44 in the championship of
the Cardinal Classic on Dec. 20.
Stanford boasts a 8-2 record against
tourney squads overall.
Like last year, the top four seeds
in each region will host a subregion
al the first weekend on either Friday
and Sunday or Saturday and Mon
day, with the winners advancing to
the regionals. All four regionals will
take place March 23 and 25.
While more than pleased at their
region as a whole, Stanford drew the
toughest of the bottom seeds. Gram
bling has received votes all season,
getting one in the latest AP poll to go
along with 15 votes and a No. 38
ranking in the coaches' poll. The
high-scoring Tigers have post
ed 86.5 points per outing, second in
the nation behind Louisiana Tech,,
and their 27.4 margin of victory
ranks third.
But they have faced such com
petitors as Baptist Christian (whom
they defeated by 96), Belhaven, Paul
Quinn and Wiley. Against their only
two NCAA tourney opponents, Pa
tricia Bibbs' club was been crushed
102-62 in its opener against Purdue
and 67-56 to Oklahoma State in De
cember.
Grambling defeated Alcorn State
72-57 to win the SWAC title for its
16th win in 17 tries. Despite featur
ing just one player over six feet in 6-
foot-4 center Kelly Bryant, the
Tigers outrebound their opponents
by over 5.5 boards per game. The
backcourt of senior Janetta Graham
and sophomore Shiakiea Carter has
combined for over 32 points per
game, with each averaging 16. Point
guard Carter's 4.4 steals per game
ranks sixth nationally, and she aver
ages 5.5 assists. Bibbs employs an
11-player rotation for her up-tempo
attack.
The 8-vs.-9 matchup will feature
two of the nation's top three-point
shooters in Colorado State's Becky
Hammon and Nebraska's Kate Gal
ligan. Hammon's 43.5 percent suc
cess rate and 3.0 three-pointers per

game rank 12th and ninth in the
country, respectively, while Galligan
places seventh at 46.1 percent from
long range.
Colorado State was the first team
on the outside of the top-25 polls,
ranking 26th in both. The Rams
have never before made the foray
into March Madness, but afler top
seed Utah was derailed by No. 5-seed
New Mexico in the WAC tourney,
Colorado State dispatched the Lobos
72-65 to take the automatic bid.
The Rams have three losses to
tourney teams (the other was to 20-
game-winner San Diego State), but
have just one victory over a tourney
team (Utah) of their 25 wins. An ex
cellent three-point shooting team,
the Rams fire from behind the arc
at a conference-leading 38.3 per
cent clip. WAC freshman of the year
Hammon led the league in scoring
with 19.8 points per contest and in
firing behind the arc at 43.9 per
cent.
Senior Teresa James placed sec
ond in WAC rebounding with 8.3
boards per contest, while senior
point guard Dee Dee Dominguez av
erages a modest 4.4 assists.
Nebraska never set anyone on
fire while aiming for a 20-win sea
son. The Huskers have just one win
in their tourney history and ad
vanced to the second round in 1993,
when they became Marianne Stan
ley's final USC vict i m i n a 78-60 Tro
jan victory. Three current Huskers
were members of that squad.
Nebraska benefits from fine
shooting of 48.4 percent from the
field, led by junior swingman Tina
McClain. McClain guns at a 56 per
cent rate and posts 13.9 points and
6.7 boards. Oddly, sophomore guard
Anna DeForge paces the club in re
bounding with seven per game and
in scoring with 14.7 points, and is
just one assist shy of the team lead as
well. Ten players on the roster are
listed as guards, yet the Huskers
outrebound their opponents by four
per game.

the lowest total of the four regions.
Nine teams are making the journey
for the first time. The SEC's pres
ence permeates each region, but the
Cardinal does not lament taking on
Alabama or Auburn, the Nos. 4 and
6 seeds, respectively.
"I thought Georgia could be [sent

Kate Starbird and the third-ranked Stanford women have their eyes

to the West]," Tucker said. "I'm
happy they're not. I expected either
Georgia or Alabama."
The Crimson Tide (22-7, 7-4
SEC) garnered a No. 10 ranking in
the latest Associated Press poll, tops
among the No. 4 seeds, while fifth
seeded North Carolina State (19-9,
10-6 ACC) has plummeted to 23rd,
its lowest position of the year.
Should Stanford advance to the
West Regional in Seattle on March
23 and 25 (Saturday and Monday),
one of these squads likely will match
up with the Cardinal.
On the lower half of the bracket,
Rene Portland and Penn State will
attempt to overcome recent disap
pointments in the tourney. The
ninth-ranked I.ady Lions feature a
great backcourt in Tina Nicholson
and Katina Mack but have been
plagued by numerous injuries in
their quest for their first Final Four
berth. year, the Lions were the
only top-four seed not to advance to
a subregional, losing to Kay Yow's
North Carolina State squad 76-74.
Penn State will face No. 15-seed
Youngstown State (20-8, 14-4 Mid-
Continent) in the first round, as the
Penguins make their first appear
ance in the NCAAs.
The weakest of the No. 3 seeds
could face Penn State in a regional
semifinal. Colorado (25-8,9-5 Big 8),
ranked 19th in the land prior to
stunning regular-season confer
ence-champion Kansas 75-47 in the
championship game of their tour
ney, has suffered from the losses of
Ail-American point guard Shelley
Sheetz and center Isabelle Fi
jalkowski to graduation. Ceal
Barry's squad racked up early wins
in the preseason NIT.
No. 6 seed Auburn is the only
squad in the West Stanford has
faced this season, defeating the

Tigers 63-44 in the championship of
the Cardinal Classic on Dec. 20.
Stanford boasts a 8-2 record against
tourney squads overall.
Like last year, the top four seeds
in each region will host a subregion
al the first weekend on either Friday
and Sunday or Saturday and Mon
day, with the winners advancing to
the regionals. All four regionals will
take place March 23 and 25.
While more than pleased at their
region as a whole, Stanford drew the
toughest of the bottom seeds. Gram
bling has received votes all season,
getting one in the latest AP poll to go
along with 15 votes and a No. 38
ranking in the coaches' poll. The
high-scoring Tigers have post
ed 86.5 points per outing, second in
the nation behind Louisiana Tech,,
and their 27.4 margin of victory
ranks third.
But they have faced such com
petitors as Baptist Christian (whom
they defeated by 96), Belhaven, Paul
Quinn and Wiley. Against their only
two NCAA tourney opponents, Pa
tricia Bibbs' club was been crushed
102-62 in its opener against Purdue
and 67-56 to Oklahoma State in De
cember.
Grambling defeated Alcorn State
72-57 to win the SWAC title for its
16th win in 17 tries. Despite featur
ing just one player over six feet in 6-
foot-4 center Kelly Bryant, the
Tigers outrebound their opponents
by over 5.5 boards per game. The
backcourt of senior Janetta Graham
and sophomore Shiakiea Carter has
combined for over 32 points per
game, with each averaging 16. Point
guard Carter's 4.4 steals per game
ranks sixth nationally, and she aver
ages 5.5 assists. Bibbs employs an
11-player rotation for her up-tempo
attack.
The 8-vs.-9 matchup will feature
two of the nation's top three-point
shooters in Colorado State's Becky
Hammon and Nebraska's Kate Gal
ligan. Hammon's 43.5 percent suc
cess rate and 3.0 three-pointers per

game rank 12th and ninth in the
country, respectively, while Galligan
places seventh at 46.1 percent from
long range.
Colorado State was the first team
on the outside of the top-25 polls,
ranking 26th in both. The Rams
have never before made the foray
into March Madness, but afler top
seed Utah was derailed by No. 5-seed
New Mexico in the WAC tourney,
Colorado State dispatched the Lobos
72-65 to take the automatic bid.
The Rams have three losses to
tourney teams (the other was to 20-
game-winner San Diego State), but
have just one victory over a tourney
team (Utah) of their 25 wins. An ex
cellent three-point shooting team,
the Rams fire from behind the arc
at a conference-leading 38.3 per
cent clip. WAC freshman of the year
Hammon led the league in scoring
with 19.8 points per contest and in
firing behind the arc at 43.9 per
cent.
Senior Teresa James placed sec
ond in WAC rebounding with 8.3
boards per contest, while senior
point guard Dee Dee Dominguez av
erages a modest 4.4 assists.
Nebraska never set anyone on
fire while aiming for a 20-win sea
son. The Huskers have just one win
in their tourney history and ad
vanced to the second round in 1993,
when they became Marianne Stan
ley's final USC vict i m i n a 78-60 Tro
jan victory. Three current Huskers
were members of that squad.
Nebraska benefits from fine
shooting of 48.4 percent from the
field, led by junior swingman Tina
McClain. McClain guns at a 56 per
cent rate and posts 13.9 points and
6.7 boards. Oddly, sophomore guard
Anna DeForge paces the club in re
bounding with seven per game and
in scoring with 14.7 points, and is
just one assist shy of the team lead as
well. Ten players on the roster are
listed as guards, yet the Huskers
outrebound their opponents by four
per game.
Last year, Vanderbilt and its six
losses stole a No. 1 seed from the 26-
2 Cardinal, clearly displeasing the
Stanford women's basketball squad.
This year, the Cardinal has no such
complaints.
In an anticlimactic announce
ment Sunday, third-ranked Stan
ford (25-2 overall, 18-0 Pacific 10
Conference) learned it had earned a
No. 1 seed in the West Region. How
ever, instead of facing Georgia, who
many felt would be shipped west as
the top No. 2 seed, Penn State (25-6,
13-3) will come west after winning
the Big Ten Conference tourna
ment.
"Obviously, I'm pleased and we
felt we deserved a No. 1 seed," said
head coach Amy Tucker. "I expected
it as I did last year and it didn't hap
pen. You just never know what
they're going to do with you."
The Cardinal will receive better
television exposure than any team in
the tournament, as it will be the only
team featured on ESPN for each of
its games. On Saturday, the
women's first-round subregional
contest with No. 16-seed Grambling
(21-6, 13-1 Southwestern Athletic)
will take place at 9:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion, with the late start courtesy
of television. At 7 p.m., Western Ath
letic Conference champion Colorado
State (25-4, 12-2 WAC) will take on
No. 9-seed Nebraska (19-9, 8-6 Big
8). The Saturday winners will battle
at Maples on Monday night at 9 p.m.
Stanford was just one of three
Pac-10 squads to make the cut, as
Oregon State (19-8,11-7) drew a No.
6 seed in the Midwest and Oregon
(18-10,10-8) earned the No. 11 spot
in the Mideast. Arizona (19-8, 10-8)
missed the field despite its most wins
ever.
To nobody's surprise, the SEC
sent a record-tying seven teams to

the tourney, while many felt LSU
(19-10) or Arkansas (20-11) was un
fairly snubbed. The Big Ten sent six
despite Northwestern's (21-10) ab
sence, while the ACC, Big Eight,
Southwest and Conference USA
sent four squads each. All except the
ACC are generally regarded as weak
er than the Pac-10, and Conference
USA teams received the Nos. 7, 8, 9
and 14 seeds.
Thirty-seven of the 64 squads in

the tourney were there last year, but
just seven of those are in the West,
the lowest total of the four regions.
