There could be no more fitting conclusion to Stanford
women's basketball team's storybook regular season
than Amy Wustefeld driving coast-to-coast to beat the
buzzer and tie her career high on Senior Night.
Before 6,124 fans, the No. 3-ranked Cardinal (25-2
overall, 18-0 Pacific 10 Conference) struggled to a 79-63
victory last Saturday over a pesky Arizona State squad
that had nothing to play for after being assured of avoid
ing .he conference cellar for the first time in three sea
sons. The Sun Devils (8-19, 4-14) played Stanford even
throughout the second frame.
En route to the second perfect season in Pac-10 histo
ry (along with the 1988-89 Cardinal's), Stanford won for
the 19th straight time (three shy of the school record),
the 27th consecutive conference game (one shy of the
league mark), the 32nd straight time at home and the
48th in a row at Maples within the Pac-10. Runner-up
Oregon State placed an amazing seven games behind
Stanford, a record that mathematically almost can never
be broken.
After the game, Stanford held its breath and waited
for the inevitable — a No. 1 seed in the West Region of the

NCAA tournament scedings that were announced Sun

Player of the Year honors with Oregon State's Tanja
Kostic and head coaches Amy Tucker and Marianne
Stanley splitting the coaching award with each other,
some Stanford players even partook in dancing with the
Dollies afterward.
"Probably our best performance of the night was af
terwards," Tucker said. "I just hope the Dollies didn't get
hurt."
An emotional Stanley took home the coaches' award
for the second consecutive season she has been on a
bench — she also garnered the honor with USC in 1992-
93. Meanwhile, junior point guard Jamila Wideman
joined Starbird on the All-Pac-10 list while sophomore
forward Vanessa Nygaard earned honorable mention.
"I think a lot of times, players like Jamila get over
looked because they are not great scorers," Tucker said.
"I really think she's the heart and soul of our team."
Wideman turned in another splendid performance
with 19 points, eight assists and eight boards while Star
bird poured in 19 in the first half, finishing just two
points shy of averaging an even 20 per game for the reg-
