# Men get shipped East to confront Bradley Braves

recruiting pitch to "Come to
Stanford, see the East Coast in
March."
For the third time in four
NCAA tournament appearances
for Montgomery's team, Stan
ford is heading to the East Re
gion. Seeded ninth, the Cardinal
(19-8) will play eighth seed
Bradley (22-7) Thursday at the
Providence Civic Center. Tip-off
is set for 12:25 p.m. EST.
"I would be less than honest
to say that we weren't a little dis
appointed," Montgomery said.
"It makes you wonder what
would have happened had we not
won the last two games."
Returning from the euphoric
sweep in Arizona late Saturday
night, the team left yesterday to
head back east in an attempt to
get acclimated to the change in
time zones. Traveling across the
country has cost Stanford one
practice day, making today's
shoot-around and full practice
that much more important in
preparing for a team that the
Cardinal coaches and players
aren't very familiar with.
"It's tough because it's not a
team you see on television," se
nior Andy Poppink said.
