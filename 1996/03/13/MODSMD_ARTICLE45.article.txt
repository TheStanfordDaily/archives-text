# Men get shipped East to confront Bradley Braves
## 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
Mike Montgomery might
want to think about changing his
recruiting pitch to "Come to
Stanford, see the East Coast in
March."
For the third time in four
NCAA tournament appearances
for Montgomery's team, Stan
ford is heading to the East Re
gion. Seeded ninth, the Cardinal
(19-8) will play eighth seed
Bradley (22-7) Thursday at the
Providence Civic Center. Tip-off
is set for 12:25 p.m. EST.
"I would be less than honest
to say that we weren't a little dis
appointed," Montgomery said.
"It makes you wonder what
would have happened had we not
won the last two games."
Returning from the euphoric
sweep in Arizona late Saturday
night, the team left yesterday to
head back east in an attempt to
get acclimated to the change in
time zones. Traveling across the
country has cost Stanford one
practice day, making today's
shoot-around and full practice
that much more important in
preparing for a team that the
Cardinal coaches and players
aren't very familiar with.
"It's tough because it's not a
team you see on television," se
nior Andy Poppink said.

striking similarity to last year's
tournament for Stanford — head
east (Albany, N.Y.) to play early
Thursday against an unknown
team (UNC-Charlotte) with a na
tional powerhouse looming in the
second round (Massachusetts).
Once again, the Minutemen
(31-1) stand as Stanford's likely
second round opponent should
the Cardinal get past Bradley. As
the top seed in the east, Massa
chusetts plays 16th seed Central
Florida (11-18) in the first
round.
"I'm not worried about UMass
right now," Montgomery said.
Both Poppink and senior Dar
ren Allaway were intrigued with
the possible rematch with the
Minutemen, who knocked Stan
ford out of last year's tourna
ment with a 75-53 win.
"I think actually it is a good
thing for us," Poppink said. "It's
almost an identical situation to
the one we were in last year. The
expectations are a little different
— last year there was much more
anxiety."
The lower-than-expected seed
ing can be turned into a positive,
according to Montgomery and the
players. Similar feelings of a lack
of respect have been used to moti
vate the team this year.
"Rill Frieder said a few things

that rubbed us the wrong way,"
Poppink said, referring to the
Arizona State coach's comments
about how Stanford will never be
a contender because the Cardinal
can't beat quality teams on the
road. "Brevin [Knightl and
David [Harbourl get charged and
the rest of the team rallies
around that."
Bradley, located in Peoria, 111.,
is making its first NCAA tourna
ment appearance since Hersey
Hawkins led the Braves to the
tourney in 1988. Bradley is coming
off back-to-back NIT appearances.
Much like Stanford, Bradley
returned all five starters this sea
son. Led by All-Missouri Valley
Conference guard Anthony Park
er, the Braves finished first in the
MVC in the regular season with a
15-3 conference record. Bradley
lost to Tulsa 60-46 in the confer
ence tournament final after beat
ing the Golden Hurricane twice
during the regular season, with
both games going to overtime.
Bradley posted wins over tour
nament participants Georgia
Tech, New Orleans and Tulsa
(twice) while losing to Kansas
State, Villanova, Penn State and
Tulsa.
Parker, a junior, averages
18.3 points and 6.4 rebounds per
game, both tops on the team. In
important games he has come up
big, scoring 30 in the Braves' 84-
82 win over Georgia Tech in the
final of the Cable Car Classic and
averaging 23.5 points in

Bradley's four overtime contests.
Along with the 6-foot-5, 190-
pound Parker, the Braves field
four senior starters — 6-8, 225-
pound Chad Kleine (6.3 ppg, 3.3
rpg) at center, 6-5, 230-pound
Dwayne Funches (11.8 ppg, 5.1
rpg) at power forward, 6-6, 220-
pound Deon Jackson (11.3 ppg,
4.2 rpg) at small forward and 5-
10, 175-pound Billy Wright (4.9
ppg, 5.6 apg) at point guard.
Along with his "pass first,
shoot second" mentality, Wright
is one of the top defenders in the
MVC. Three players off the
bench average double-figure
minutes, while another is close at
9.7 minutes per game. Top re
serves are point guard Aaron Zo
brist (second on the team in
three pointers made and at
tempted) and 6-8, 205-pound
power forward Bayo Akinkunle
(5.2 ppg, 3.5 rpg).
For Stanford, all five starters
have two tournament games
under their belts from last year
and are taking a much more busi
ness-like attitude to Providence.
"We were fresh-faced a little
bit last year," Allaway said.
"We've done the one-win thing
already. We as seniors have ac
complished all but two of our
goals this year — getting to the
Sweet Sixteen and winning at
Pauley [Pavilion, UCLA's home
courtl. We didn't manage to get
that though, but every other
thing we set out to do we did.
Now, one more left."

team you see on television," se

striking similarity to last year's
tournament for Stanford — head
east (Albany, N.Y.) to play early
Thursday against an unknown
team (UNC-Charlotte) with a na
tional powerhouse looming in the
second round (Massachusetts).
Once again, the Minutemen
(31-1) stand as Stanford's likely
second round opponent should
the Cardinal get past Bradley. As
the top seed in the east, Massa
chusetts plays 16th seed Central
Florida (11-18) in the first
round.
"I'm not worried about UMass
right now," Montgomery said.
Both Poppink and senior Dar
ren Allaway were intrigued with
the possible rematch with the
Minutemen, who knocked Stan
ford out of last year's tourna
ment with a 75-53 win.
"I think actually it is a good
thing for us," Poppink said. "It's
almost an identical situation to
the one we were in last year. The
expectations are a little different
— last year there was much more
anxiety."
The lower-than-expected seed
ing can be turned into a positive,
according to Montgomery and the
players. Similar feelings of a lack
of respect have been used to moti
vate the team this year.
"Rill Frieder said a few things

that rubbed us the wrong way,"
Poppink said, referring to the
Arizona State coach's comments
about how Stanford will never be
a contender because the Cardinal
can't beat quality teams on the
road. "Brevin [Knightl and
David [Harbourl get charged and
the rest of the team rallies
around that."
Bradley, located in Peoria, 111.,
is making its first NCAA tourna
ment appearance since Hersey
Hawkins led the Braves to the
tourney in 1988. Bradley is coming
off back-to-back NIT appearances.
Much like Stanford, Bradley
returned all five starters this sea
son. Led by All-Missouri Valley
Conference guard Anthony Park
er, the Braves finished first in the
MVC in the regular season with a
15-3 conference record. Bradley
lost to Tulsa 60-46 in the confer
ence tournament final after beat
ing the Golden Hurricane twice
during the regular season, with
both games going to overtime.
Bradley posted wins over tour
nament participants Georgia
Tech, New Orleans and Tulsa
(twice) while losing to Kansas
State, Villanova, Penn State and
Tulsa.
Parker, a junior, averages
18.3 points and 6.4 rebounds per
game, both tops on the team. In
important games he has come up
big, scoring 30 in the Braves' 84-
82 win over Georgia Tech in the
final of the Cable Car Classic and
averaging 23.5 points in

Bradley's four overtime contests.
Along with the 6-foot-5, 190-
pound Parker, the Braves field
four senior starters — 6-8, 225-
pound Chad Kleine (6.3 ppg, 3.3
rpg) at center, 6-5, 230-pound
Dwayne Funches (11.8 ppg, 5.1
rpg) at power forward, 6-6, 220-
pound Deon Jackson (11.3 ppg,
4.2 rpg) at small forward and 5-
10, 175-pound Billy Wright (4.9
ppg, 5.6 apg) at point guard.
Along with his "pass first,
shoot second" mentality, Wright
is one of the top defenders in the
MVC. Three players off the
bench average double-figure
minutes, while another is close at
9.7 minutes per game. Top re
serves are point guard Aaron Zo
brist (second on the team in
three pointers made and at
tempted) and 6-8, 205-pound
power forward Bayo Akinkunle
(5.2 ppg, 3.5 rpg).
For Stanford, all five starters
have two tournament games
under their belts from last year
and are taking a much more busi
ness-like attitude to Providence.
"We were fresh-faced a little
bit last year," Allaway said.
"We've done the one-win thing
already. We as seniors have ac
complished all but two of our
goals this year — getting to the
Sweet Sixteen and winning at
Pauley [Pavilion, UCLA's home
courtl. We didn't manage to get
that though, but every other
thing we set out to do we did.
Now, one more left."
