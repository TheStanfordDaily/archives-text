# Victory over ASU ends season on high note

The letdown was bound to happen — you don't
beat a national power like Arizona on its home
court for only the second time in 21 tries and come
back just as strong the next game.
But head coach Mike Montgomery was more
concerned with how Stanford (19-8 overall, 12-6
Pacific 10 Conference) would respond to the "in
evitable" lull at a place where it had lost six games
in a row. And even after failing to score a field goal
for a stretch of eight minutes, eight seconds in the
second half last Saturday afternoon, Stanford still
managed to clamp down on Arizona State (11-16, 6-
12) to win going away, 67-53.
"A pretty doggone good weekend," Montgomery
said. "We come on the road thinking we need one
and get the bonus Thursday night and manage to
get out of here with a win too."
During Stanford's cold streak, the Sun Devils
used a 7-0 run to cut the score to 49-48 with 9:34 to
play in the game. Visions of an earlier loss to USC
surfaced as Stanford couldn't find the fire to finish
off a team from the bottom reaches of the Pac-10.
"We kind of looked at each other and knew that
at some point we had to step it up, and it was de
fense which did it," said senior Andy Poppink.
Keyed by a combination of poor shot selection by
Arizona State and tighter Cardinal defense, Stan
ford scored on seven straight possessions during a
15-0 run that ended any speculation of two miracle

upsets for the Sun Devils (ASU upended California
on Thursday 56-53). Instead, Stanford came away
with its first-ever sweep of the Arizona schools in
one season.
"Coach said either we're going to gut it up or roll
over, and we gutted it up and pushed the lead up
and eventually got the 'W\" said Brevin Knight.
"We just played tough 'D' — we were able to get out
on the break and get some easy shots."
Back-to-back steals by Dion Cross and Poppink
and subsequent fast-break buckets helped set the
tone for the final ten minutes of the game. With
Cross and David Harbour shutting down Sun Devil
scorers Jeremy Veal and Ron Riley, Arizona State
did not score for an 8:27 stretch at the end of the
game.
"They were trying to go to those guys to shoot it
and they were consistently up in their face," Mont
gomery said.
Riley led all scorers with 27, but after lofting a
25-foot airball with 6 minutes left in the game, he
hardly touched the ball on offense. Instead, Veal
and Quincy Brewer spent most of every possession
dribbling around the perimeter, unable to crack the
Cardinal defense.
Knight harassed Brewer into eight of Arizona
State's 18 turnovers and Veal made only seven of
17 shots. The Sun Devils shot only 39.6 percent for
the game and a dismal 33 percent in the second
half.
Cross could not have played a game more con-
