# Victory over ASU ends season on high note
## 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
The letdown was bound to happen — you don't
beat a national power like Arizona on its home
court for only the second time in 21 tries and come
back just as strong the next game.
But head coach Mike Montgomery was more
concerned with how Stanford (19-8 overall, 12-6
Pacific 10 Conference) would respond to the "in
evitable" lull at a place where it had lost six games
in a row. And even after failing to score a field goal
for a stretch of eight minutes, eight seconds in the
second half last Saturday afternoon, Stanford still
managed to clamp down on Arizona State (11-16, 6-
12) to win going away, 67-53.
"A pretty doggone good weekend," Montgomery
said. "We come on the road thinking we need one
and get the bonus Thursday night and manage to
get out of here with a win too."
During Stanford's cold streak, the Sun Devils
used a 7-0 run to cut the score to 49-48 with 9:34 to
play in the game. Visions of an earlier loss to USC
surfaced as Stanford couldn't find the fire to finish
off a team from the bottom reaches of the Pac-10.
"We kind of looked at each other and knew that
at some point we had to step it up, and it was de
fense which did it," said senior Andy Poppink.
Keyed by a combination of poor shot selection by
Arizona State and tighter Cardinal defense, Stan
ford scored on seven straight possessions during a
15-0 run that ended any speculation of two miracle

upsets for the Sun Devils (ASU upended California
on Thursday 56-53). Instead, Stanford came away
with its first-ever sweep of the Arizona schools in
one season.
"Coach said either we're going to gut it up or roll
over, and we gutted it up and pushed the lead up
and eventually got the 'W\" said Brevin Knight.
"We just played tough 'D' — we were able to get out
on the break and get some easy shots."
Back-to-back steals by Dion Cross and Poppink
and subsequent fast-break buckets helped set the
tone for the final ten minutes of the game. With
Cross and David Harbour shutting down Sun Devil
scorers Jeremy Veal and Ron Riley, Arizona State
did not score for an 8:27 stretch at the end of the
game.
"They were trying to go to those guys to shoot it
and they were consistently up in their face," Mont
gomery said.
Riley led all scorers with 27, but after lofting a
25-foot airball with 6 minutes left in the game, he
hardly touched the ball on offense. Instead, Veal
and Quincy Brewer spent most of every possession
dribbling around the perimeter, unable to crack the
Cardinal defense.
Knight harassed Brewer into eight of Arizona
State's 18 turnovers and Veal made only seven of
17 shots. The Sun Devils shot only 39.6 percent for
the game and a dismal 33 percent in the second
half.
Cross could not have played a game more con-
trary to his 9-for-9, 27-point out
burst Thursday against Arizona.
The senior guard scored only five
points, missing four of five shots
(including all three of this three
point attempts), but dished out a
team-high five assists and cor
ralled three steals.
Instead of a perimeter attack,
Stanford turned inside to Pop
pink and Darren Allaway. The
two seniors combined to shoot
12-for-15 from the floor, all with
in 15 feet of the basket. Poppink
shook off his worst game of the
season by scoring a team-high 24
points and grabbing eight re
bounds.
"I was just hoping to get some
easy baskets early and get my
confidence back," he said.
Said Montgomery: "What we
did is we sucked it up and found a
way to keep them from scoring,
Then we found the guy who was
scoring for us enough to allow us
to win."
The strong game by Poppink
was a bit of a slap to the confer
ence coaches who did not vote the
senior forward to the All-Pac-10
team. Knight and Cross both
made the team for the second
year in a row, but Poppink only
received honorable mention sta
tus despite posting season aver
ages of 14.4 points and 8.1 re
bounds per game.
Joining Knight and Cross on
the all-conference team were
UCLA's J.R. Henderson, Toby
Bailey and Charles O'Bannon,
Arizona's Reggie Geary and Ben
Davis, Washington State's Mark
1 lendrickson and Isaac Fontaine,
Washington's Mark Sanford and
Cal's Shareef Abdur-Rahim.
Abdur-Rahim also grabbed
both Player of the Year and
Freshman of the Year honors.
Stanford's Mark Seaton, Ore
gon's Terik Brown, Washing
ton's Todd MacCulloch and
UCLA's Jelani McCoy were also
on the all-freshman team.
But more important than in
dividual honors for Poppink was

the return of the grittiness and
intensity that Stanford captured
during its six-game winning
streak earlier this year.
"This means an awful lot to
finish strong like this," he said.
"Last year at this point in the
season, we were pretty worn

down emotionally and physically
going into the tournament. We
played our hearts out in one
game but I don't know if we had
enough for that second round. As
a team right now we have a good
feel about going into the tourna
ment."
