# Stanford sluggers get swept by Trojans
## 
### Sam Stapleton 
The seventh-ranked USC base
ball team came to Stanford last Fri
day intent on establishing itself as
the front-runner in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division. With
a convincing three-game sweep of
the No. 8-ranked Cardinal, the Tro
jans left little doubt who will be the
team to beat this year in the highly
competitive Six-Pac.
USC (16-4 overall, 5-1 Six-Pac),
which has now won eight straight
games at Sunken Diamond, com
bined its vaunted offense with quali
ty pitching to dominate Stanford
and take hold of first place in the Six-
Pac. The Trojan lineup lived up to its
billing, scoring 27 runs on 38 hits, in
cluding five home runs and seven
doubles, over the course of the series.
Sunday afternoon was the closest
game of the series, as USC won a
hard-fought contest 10-7. The Tro
jans established an early lead, scor
ing four runs in the first two innings
off Stanford starter Tom Reimers on
the strength of second baseman
Ryan Stromsborg's first home run of
the season.
Stanford, led by senior A.J.
Hinch, fought back with five runs in
the second, sending 11 men to the
plate and chasing Trojan starter
Steve Immel. Hinch went 4-for-5 in
the game with 2 RBIs and his sixth
home run of the season.
However, the Trojan offense
proved impossible to shut down.
USC added a run in the third and
two runs in the fifth to retake the
lead, 7-5. The Trojans threatened to
score nearly every inning, pounding
out 13 hits and stealing seven bases

in the game. Reimers and freshman
right hander Chad Hutchinson
nonetheless managed to keep the
game close until right fielder Jeff In
glin's two-run homer in the ninth in
ning (his seventh of the season) put
the game out of reach.
Reimers (3-2) gave up seven
earned runs in seven innings in tak
ing the loss, while Trojan righty

Scott Henderson (3-0) took credit for
the win with his six innings of effec
tive relief.
On Saturday afternoon, the Tro
jans established an early 3-0 lead
with two runs in the third inning and
another in the fifth off Stanford
starter Kyle Peterson. Stanford
fought back with two runs in the
sixth at the expense of USC starter

Seth Etherton.
However, the Cardinal bullpen
couldn't keep the game close, as re
lievers J.D. Brammer, Mario Igle
sias, Brendan Sullivan and Josh
Koons surrendered six runs in the
seventh and eighth. Stanford mus
tered a run in the bottom of the
