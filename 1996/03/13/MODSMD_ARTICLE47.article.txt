# Stanford sluggers get swept by Trojans
## 
### Sam Stapleton 
The seventh-ranked USC base
ball team came to Stanford last Fri
day intent on establishing itself as
the front-runner in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division. With
a convincing three-game sweep of
the No. 8-ranked Cardinal, the Tro
jans left little doubt who will be the
team to beat this year in the highly
competitive Six-Pac.
USC (16-4 overall, 5-1 Six-Pac),
which has now won eight straight
games at Sunken Diamond, com
bined its vaunted offense with quali
ty pitching to dominate Stanford
and take hold of first place in the Six-
Pac. The Trojan lineup lived up to its
billing, scoring 27 runs on 38 hits, in
cluding five home runs and seven
doubles, over the course of the series.
Sunday afternoon was the closest
game of the series, as USC won a
hard-fought contest 10-7. The Tro
jans established an early lead, scor
ing four runs in the first two innings
off Stanford starter Tom Reimers on
the strength of second baseman
Ryan Stromsborg's first home run of
the season.
Stanford, led by senior A.J.
Hinch, fought back with five runs in
the second, sending 11 men to the
plate and chasing Trojan starter
Steve Immel. Hinch went 4-for-5 in
the game with 2 RBIs and his sixth
home run of the season.
However, the Trojan offense
proved impossible to shut down.
USC added a run in the third and
two runs in the fifth to retake the
lead, 7-5. The Trojans threatened to
score nearly every inning, pounding
out 13 hits and stealing seven bases

in the game. Reimers and freshman
right hander Chad Hutchinson
nonetheless managed to keep the
game close until right fielder Jeff In
glin's two-run homer in the ninth in
ning (his seventh of the season) put
the game out of reach.
Reimers (3-2) gave up seven
earned runs in seven innings in tak
ing the loss, while Trojan righty

Scott Henderson (3-0) took credit for
the win with his six innings of effec
tive relief.
On Saturday afternoon, the Tro
jans established an early 3-0 lead
with two runs in the third inning and
another in the fifth off Stanford
starter Kyle Peterson. Stanford
fought back with two runs in the
sixth at the expense of USC starter

Seth Etherton.
However, the Cardinal bullpen
couldn't keep the game close, as re
lievers J.D. Brammer, Mario Igle
sias, Brendan Sullivan and Josh
Koons surrendered six runs in the
seventh and eighth. Stanford mus
tered a run in the bottom of the

ninth, but it wasn't nearly enough as
the Trojans handed the Cardinal a 9-
3 defeat.
Peterson (2-4) pitched 5 2/3 in
nings in the loss, giving up three
runs and striking out three. Ether
ton (4-1) earned the win with seven
innings of work, giving up only two
runs and striking out five,
Friday night was Randy Flores
night at Sunken Diamond. The
Trojan lefty needed only 101 pitch
es to shut out the Cardinal 8-0, scat
tering five hits over nine innings.
Flores (4-0) improved his career
record versus Stanford to 5-0, with
four shutouts.
Stanford starter Jeff Austin (3-2)
suffered through his second straight
sub-par outing, surrendering eight
runs in seven innings of work. USC
scored five runs in the first inning on
catcher Chad Moeller's bases-loaded
triple and left fielder Paul Cruz's
two-run home run, his second of the
year. The Stanford freshman man
aged to shut the Trojans down until
the seventh, when third baseman
Morgan Ensberg's three-run homer
ended Austin's night and added fur
ther cushion to USC's lead.
The weekend sweep drops Stan
ford to fifth place in the Six-Pac at 3-
6 in league play (14-11 overall). The
Cardinal will now take two weeks off
for finals (a make-up game versus

St. Mary's on Monday was post
poned because of rain), a much
needed rest for a beleaguered ball
club that is 5-6 in its last eleven
games, with all six losses in league
play.
"Maybe the break will be good for
us," said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess. "The rest might help, but
we certainly have a lot of work to do."
Stanford will not face an easy
schedule over the coming weeks.
Stanford will resume play with a
three-game series against arch-rival
California. While the injuiy-ridden
Golden Bears currently rest at the
bottom of the Six-Pac standings,
they should reach full strength in
time for the series. The two teams
play on Saturday, March 23 and
Monday, March 25 at Berkeley and
on Sunday, March 24 at Sunken Di
amond.
The Cardinal follows the series
with a trip to Reno to take on Neva
da on Tuesday, March 26.
Upon returning to Palo Alto,
Stanford will end the first half of the
season with a three-game set against
the upstart Arizona Wildcats at
Sunken Diamond from Friday,
March 29 through Sunday, March
31. Arizona, the weakest team in the
Six-Pac over the past two seasons,
has surprised the league this year by
jumping out to a 3-3 start in confer
ence play.

The weekend sweep drops Stan
ford to fifth place in the Six-Pac at 3-
6 in league play (14-11 overall). The
Cardinal will now take two weeks off
for finals (a make-up game versus

St. Mary's on Monday was post
poned because of rain), a much
needed rest for a beleaguered ball
club that is 5-6 in its last eleven
games, with all six losses in league
play.
"Maybe the break will be good for
us," said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess. "The rest might help, but
we certainly have a lot of work to do."
Stanford will not face an easy
schedule over the coming weeks.
Stanford will resume play with a
three-game series against arch-rival
California. While the injuiy-ridden
Golden Bears currently rest at the
bottom of the Six-Pac standings,
they should reach full strength in
time for the series. The two teams
play on Saturday, March 23 and
Monday, March 25 at Berkeley and
on Sunday, March 24 at Sunken Di
amond.
The Cardinal follows the series
with a trip to Reno to take on Neva
da on Tuesday, March 26.
Upon returning to Palo Alto,
Stanford will end the first half of the
season with a three-game set against
the upstart Arizona Wildcats at
Sunken Diamond from Friday,
March 29 through Sunday, March
31. Arizona, the weakest team in the
Six-Pac over the past two seasons,
has surprised the league this year by
jumping out to a 3-3 start in confer
ence play.
Stanford ends its break with a
game at Sunken Diamond versus
San Francisco State on Monday,
April 1 at 7 p.m.
