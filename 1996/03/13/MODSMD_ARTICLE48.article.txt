Despite playing without one of
its star players, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team pulled to
gether last Saturday for a 10-9 tri
umph over arch-rival UC-Davia.
In addition to senior co-captain
Wendy Kula's three points, fresh
men Nicole Whelan and Alexis
Patrizio both netted two goals for
the Cardinal, with Carole Fakhiy,
Daria Kramer and freshman Lisa
Light also contributing to the
final tally.
"With that even distribution,
it shows that everyone was an of
fensive threat and eveiyone was
working hard," Kula said.
Because of a family emergency
Friday, sophomore Dara Kaplan
flew home to the East Coast and
was not on campus for Saturday 's
game. But Stanford persevered in
a back-and-forth contest, as six
different scorers combined to
snag the victory.
"I'm excited that we were able
to win without Dara, but we'll be
ecstatic to have her back," said
head coach Kay Cowperthwait.
There was never more than a
two-goal difference between the
teams, and the game see-sawed
right up until the very end. Stan
ford led 10-8 wit h two minutes re
maining, when Davis scored a
goal to cut the deficit to one. At
that point, the Cardinal's job was

to keep possession, wait out the
clock, and keep Davis from scor
ing.
"This was our first game that
we played really well together as a
team," Cowperthwait said. "A lot
of the game was played on the
midfield â€” we had a lot of really
fast midfield players."
Cowperthwait cited exception
al performances from attack wing
Whelan and defensive wing Meg
Pearson, both freshmen, as well
as key saves by goalie Elizabeth
Franklin.
" It was really important for us,
for our confidence/' Whelan said.
"We'll be able to take this experi
ence to our next game and hope
fully repeat some of the good ele
ments."
Defensive communication was
also key to the win.
"Davis never took a one-on
one shot against the goal/'
Kramer said. "{The Aggies] really
had to work for their shots. They
weren't coming in at 100 percent
speed; there were very few fast
breaks. Most goals came from
free-position shots."
In addition, Franklin took a
proactive role and came out of the
net to play defense on the field,
Kramer said. The defense held
Davis back so that they couldn't
play its faster running game, and
the Cardinal was able to utilize its
