Pepperdine 1

If No. 10 Pepperdine was sup
posed to be a test for the second
ranked Stanford women's tennis
team last Saturday, then the Cardi
nal set the curve.
Stanford (13-1, 3-0 Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division) took
five of the six singles matches, all in
straight sets, to clinch the intersec
tional clash with the Waves before
doubles play even began.
The 6-1 victoiy was Stanford's
second of the weekend, as the Cardi
nal demolished the University of the
Pacific on the road on Friday, 7-0.
With much of the lineup com
plaining of injury and illness, it was
extremely important for the Cardi
nal to get off the courts as quickly as
possible.
"I was very pleased," said Stan
ford head coach Frank Brennan.
"When you're banged up like this,
you just want to get off the court.
You don't want to have any doubles
pressure to worry about."
Stanford redshirt senior Amy
Chiminello (13-1) led the charge for
the Cardinal on Saturday, finishing
first with a 6-0, 6-1 victory over
Annabel Rognon at the No. 6 posi
tion.
The rest of the Cardinal women
followed suit. In the No. 2 through
No. 6 singles matches, the Waves
could only manage 18 total games to
Stanford's 60.
At No. 2, junior All-American
Katie Schlukebir (11-3), currently
No. 16 in the nation, bounced back
from a slow start to defeat No. 30 An
gela Lawrence, 6-3,6-1.
Junior Sandra De Silva (12-1)
continued to tear up opponents. The
No. 14-ranked singles player in col
lege tennis blew away Pepperdine's
Kathrin Denn, 6-2,6-2.
Redshirt senior Kim Shasby and
sophomore Julie Scott had little
more trouble in their matches. Shas
by (7-4) disposed of Tomoko Tsuru
tani, 6-3,6-2 on the No. 4 court while
Scott (12-1) handed Anna Sveden

hov a 6-2,6-2 defeat at No. 5.
Pepperdine's only point came in
the No. 1 singles match, where Is
abela Petrov upset Stanford sopho
more Ania Bleszynski, 7-6,6-2.
Bleszynski had three set points in
the first set after jumping out to a 5-
2 lead. But Petrov fought hack to
forge a 6-6 tie. Petrov, No. 34 in the
country, then won the first three
points of the tie breaker.
"I felt like I was playing well in the
beginning," Bleszynski said. "But

then I got up 5-2 and I backed off. I
started playing too defensively in
stead of putting it away."
With the first set going to Pepper
dine, Petrov took advantage of the
momentum in the second set, win
ning 6-2.
"She just started playing well in
the second set," Bleszynski said. "I
think that first set gave her a lot of
confidence."

Sandra De Silva pounds a backhand earlier this year. The women's
tennis team trounced Pepperdine last weekend, 6-1.
"One of the intangibles Ania
needs to learn is how to play well
with a lead," Brennan said. "When
she gets a lead, she plays too soft. She
just can't figure out why it's impor
tant to win that next game. I suppose
if you get burned enough, you finally
pick that up."
Despite clinching the win in sin
gles, the teams did play one doubles
match. The Cardinal team of junior
Emily Burt and senior Beth Berris
(2-0) used their quickness to down
Petrov and Tsurutani in an eight
game pro set, 8-4.
"Beth looked good," Brennan
said. "Beth and Emily work well to
gether. They're a quick team and
they know how to play doubles. You
can be short if you're good jumpers
and you're quick enough."
In Friday's match, the Cardinal

was just too much for the unranked
Tigers of Pacific. Stanford took all
six singles matches in straight sets
and one doubles match.
Bleszynski and Schlukebir
cruised in their usual No. 1 and No.
2 spots. Brennan shook up the rest of
the singles lineup, however, resting
De Silva, Shasby and Chiminello due
to nagging injuries and illness.
But the Cardinal didn't miss a
step. Scott stepped up into the No. 3
spot and breezed past her Pacific op
ponent, 6-2, 6-0. The Stanford re
serves also found similar success.
Berris (2-0), in her first match
back from a wrist injury, blew by
Tanya O' Neil, 6-3, 6-2. Senior
Wendy Sacks (4-0) and Burt (3-0)
also tamed their Tiger opponents in
straight sets.
In doubles, Berris teamed up
with Scott for an 8-5 Cardinal victo
ry.
"Pacific is a little bit of a test,"
Brennan said. "You're on the road,
you have different officials, the

crowd is a little different. The courts
are set up a little strange. It really is
a good little test, and you just have to
suck it up. It's nice when a match
that's supposed to be routine actual
ly is routine."
Stanford will utilize the next two
weeks to recuperate from illness and
those nagging injuries before head
ing out on a spring break road trip
that features a collision with No. 3
Texas on March 28. The Cardinal
will also play No. 32 Texas A&M on
March 27.
"This is obviously a key road trip
for us with this interregional play,"
Brennan said. "We can see how our
big competition plays and we'll be at
their home."
The Longhorns, defending na
tional champions, handed Stanford
two of their three losses last season,
including a 5-2 loss in the semifinals
of the NCAA championships.
"I think the team will be a little
extra-motivated," Brennan said. "It
will be put-up or shut-up time."

suck it up. It's nice when a match
that's supposed to be routine actual
ly is routine."
Stanford will utilize the next two
weeks to recuperate from illness and
those nagging injuries before head
ing out on a spring break road trip
that features a collision with No. 3
Texas on March 28. The Cardinal
will also play No. 32 Texas A&M on
March 27.
"This is obviously a key road trip
for us with this interregional play,"
Brennan said. "We can see how our
big competition plays and we'll be at
their home."
The Longhorns, defending na
tional champions, handed Stanford
two of their three losses last season,
including a 5-2 loss in the semifinals
of the NCAA championships.
"I think the team will be a little
extra-motivated," Brennan said. "It
will be put-up or shut-up time."
Stanford 7
Pacific 0
Stanford 6
Pepperdine 1

If No. 10 Pepperdine was sup
posed to be a test for the second
ranked Stanford women's tennis
team last Saturday, then the Cardi
nal set the curve.
Stanford (13-1, 3-0 Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division) took
five of the six singles matches, all in
straight sets, to clinch the intersec
tional clash with the Waves before
doubles play even began.
The 6-1 victoiy was Stanford's
second of the weekend, as the Cardi
nal demolished the University of the
Pacific on the road on Friday, 7-0.
With much of the lineup com
plaining of injury and illness, it was
extremely important for the Cardi
nal to get off the courts as quickly as
possible.
"I was very pleased," said Stan
ford head coach Frank Brennan.
"When you're banged up like this,
you just want to get off the court.
You don't want to have any doubles
pressure to worry about."
Stanford redshirt senior Amy
Chiminello (13-1) led the charge for
the Cardinal on Saturday, finishing
first with a 6-0, 6-1 victory over
Annabel Rognon at the No. 6 posi
tion.
The rest of the Cardinal women
followed suit. In the No. 2 through
No. 6 singles matches, the Waves
could only manage 18 total games to
Stanford's 60.
At No. 2, junior All-American
Katie Schlukebir (11-3), currently
No. 16 in the nation, bounced back
from a slow start to defeat No. 30 An
gela Lawrence, 6-3,6-1.
Junior Sandra De Silva (12-1)
continued to tear up opponents. The
No. 14-ranked singles player in col
lege tennis blew away Pepperdine's
Kathrin Denn, 6-2,6-2.
Redshirt senior Kim Shasby and
sophomore Julie Scott had little
more trouble in their matches. Shas
by (7-4) disposed of Tomoko Tsuru
tani, 6-3,6-2 on the No. 4 court while
Scott (12-1) handed Anna Sveden

hov a 6-2,6-2 defeat at No. 5.
Pepperdine's only point came in
the No. 1 singles match, where Is
abela Petrov upset Stanford sopho
more Ania Bleszynski, 7-6,6-2.
Bleszynski had three set points in
the first set after jumping out to a 5-
2 lead. But Petrov fought hack to
forge a 6-6 tie. Petrov, No. 34 in the
country, then won the first three
points of the tie breaker.
"I felt like I was playing well in the
beginning," Bleszynski said. "But

then I got up 5-2 and I backed off. I
started playing too defensively in
stead of putting it away."
With the first set going to Pepper
dine, Petrov took advantage of the
momentum in the second set, win
ning 6-2.
"She just started playing well in
the second set," Bleszynski said. "I
think that first set gave her a lot of
confidence."


Red Byer — Daily
Sandra De Silva pounds a backhand earlier this year. The women's
tennis team trounced Pepperdine last weekend, 6-1.
"One of the intangibles Ania
needs to learn is how to play well
with a lead," Brennan said. "When
she gets a lead, she plays too soft. She
just can't figure out why it's impor
tant to win that next game. I suppose
if you get burned enough, you finally
pick that up."
Despite clinching the win in sin
gles, the teams did play one doubles
match. The Cardinal team of junior
Emily Burt and senior Beth Berris
(2-0) used their quickness to down
Petrov and Tsurutani in an eight
game pro set, 8-4.
"Beth looked good," Brennan
said. "Beth and Emily work well to
gether. They're a quick team and
they know how to play doubles. You
can be short if you're good jumpers
and you're quick enough."
In Friday's match, the Cardinal

was just too much for the unranked
Tigers of Pacific. Stanford took all
six singles matches in straight sets
and one doubles match.
Bleszynski and Schlukebir
cruised in their usual No. 1 and No.
2 spots. Brennan shook up the rest of
the singles lineup, however, resting
De Silva, Shasby and Chiminello due
to nagging injuries and illness.
But the Cardinal didn't miss a
step. Scott stepped up into the No. 3
spot and breezed past her Pacific op
ponent, 6-2, 6-0. The Stanford re
serves also found similar success.
Berris (2-0), in her first match
back from a wrist injury, blew by
Tanya O' Neil, 6-3, 6-2. Senior
Wendy Sacks (4-0) and Burt (3-0)
also tamed their Tiger opponents in
straight sets.
In doubles, Berris teamed up
with Scott for an 8-5 Cardinal victo
ry.
"Pacific is a little bit of a test,"
Brennan said. "You're on the road,
you have different officials, the

crowd is a little different. The courts
are set up a little strange. It really is
a good little test, and you just have to
suck it up. It's nice when a match
that's supposed to be routine actual
ly is routine."
Stanford will utilize the next two
weeks to recuperate from illness and
those nagging injuries before head

March 27.
