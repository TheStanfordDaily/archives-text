If No. 10 Pepperdine was sup
posed to be a test for the second
ranked Stanford women's tennis
team last Saturday, then the Cardi
nal set the curve.
Stanford (13-1, 3-0 Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division) took
five of the six singles matches, all in
straight sets, to clinch the intersec
tional clash with the Waves before
doubles play even began.
The 6-1 victoiy was Stanford's
second of the weekend, as the Cardi
nal demolished the University of the
Pacific on the road on Friday, 7-0.
With much of the lineup com
plaining of injury and illness, it was
extremely important for the Cardi
nal to get off the courts as quickly as
possible.
"I was very pleased," said Stan
ford head coach Frank Brennan.
"When you're banged up like this,
you just want to get off the court.
You don't want to have any doubles
pressure to worry about."
Stanford redshirt senior Amy
Chiminello (13-1) led the charge for
the Cardinal on Saturday, finishing
first with a 6-0, 6-1 victory over
Annabel Rognon at the No. 6 posi
tion.
The rest of the Cardinal women
followed suit. In the No. 2 through
No. 6 singles matches, the Waves
could only manage 18 total games to
Stanford's 60.
At No. 2, junior All-American
Katie Schlukebir (11-3), currently
No. 16 in the nation, bounced back
from a slow start to defeat No. 30 An
gela Lawrence, 6-3,6-1.
Junior Sandra De Silva (12-1)
continued to tear up opponents. The
No. 14-ranked singles player in col
lege tennis blew away Pepperdine's
Kathrin Denn, 6-2,6-2.
Redshirt senior Kim Shasby and
sophomore Julie Scott had little
more trouble in their matches. Shas
by (7-4) disposed of Tomoko Tsuru
tani, 6-3,6-2 on the No. 4 court while
Scott (12-1) handed Anna Sveden

hov a 6-2,6-2 defeat at No. 5.
Pepperdine's only point came in
the No. 1 singles match, where Is
abela Petrov upset Stanford sopho
more Ania Bleszynski, 7-6,6-2.
Bleszynski had three set points in
the first set after jumping out to a 5-
2 lead. But Petrov fought hack to
forge a 6-6 tie. Petrov, No. 34 in the
country, then won the first three
points of the tie breaker.
"I felt like I was playing well in the
beginning," Bleszynski said. "But

then I got up 5-2 and I backed off. I
started playing too defensively in
stead of putting it away."
With the first set going to Pepper
dine, Petrov took advantage of the
momentum in the second set, win
ning 6-2.
"She just started playing well in
the second set," Bleszynski said. "I
think that first set gave her a lot of
confidence."
