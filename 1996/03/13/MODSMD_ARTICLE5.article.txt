# GSB ranked No. 1
## Law School drops from second to third; School of Medicine climbs to 10th place 
### Kristie Lilje Smith Contributing writer 
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business regained its position as
the nation's top business school in
U.S. News & World Report's 1996
ranking of America's best gradu
ate schools.
Stanford, which first gained
the title in 1994, was relegated to
the third spot last year behind
MIT and the University of Penn
sylvania. These schools now stand
in Stanford's shadow at number
two and three, respectively.
According to Bob Morris, the
managing editor of "America's
Best Graduate Schools," the busi
ness school rankings are based on
surveys that the magazine circu
lates among academics and such
top recruiters as Hewlett-
Packard Co. and Bank of Ameri
ca. The schools also submit infor

mation regarding their admis
sions process and their school
standards, he said.
The rankings are generated by
a computer model that mathe
matically compares each school's
data, Morris said.
"The business school rankings
are very close," Morris explained.
Stanford ranked higher this year
because of better feedback from
the recruiter's surveys, he said.
Because the scores among the
schools are often so close, the
magazine is considering rounding
the scores up to the nearest per
centage point next year, Morris
said.
According to Morris, the cur
rent system creates a "a false pre
cision." With schools within such
a close range of each other, the
rankings seem "to create a dis
tinction [between schoolsl where
there is none," Morris added. So,
next year perhaps a score of 99.9
will not be ranked second under a
school with a score of 100.
James Baron, associate dean
for academic affairs at the Busi
ness School, said although he is
pleased with the Stanford's new
ranking at No. 1, he agrees that it
is difficult to compare different
schools and assess their rank
based on a tenth of a point.
"Obviously people would prefer
a better ranking than worse," he
said. "(At the Business School), we
are cautious in over-interpreting
rankings — concluding that we
can't do better (if we are ranked
No. 1), or that the sky has fallen if
we get a bad ranking," he said.
Baron said the Business School
is always trying to improve by
"benchmarking against other or
ganizations." The magazine's
ranking is just another form of
input the school uses in trying to
improve, he said.

Business school deans and MBA
program heads ranked Stanford in
the top five in accounting, finance,
marketing, nonprofit organizations,
productions / operations manage
ment and quantitative analysis.
Although MIT retained its po
sition as the top graduate school of
engineering, Stanford moved into
the second spot this year — two
rankings ahead of last year's
showing. Stanford's computer en
gineering, materials and metallur
gical engineering and mechanical
engineering programs were
ranked in the top five, with its pro
gram in environmental engineer
ing ranking first in the country.
Stanford's doctoral programs in
the biological sciences and comput
er science remained at No. 1 this
year, while the Law School dropped
from second place to third place,
ranking behind Yale and Harvard.
For the past five years, the Law
School has ranked among the top
five.
The School of Medicine was
back in the top 10 list of research
oriented medical schools this year,
moving up to the 10th spot from
12th place in 1995.
