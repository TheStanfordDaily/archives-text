Stanford men's tennis players
had enjoyed two weeks away from
singles competition heading into
their March 8 match with UC-
Irvine, but they showed no signs
of rustiness on the court last Fri
day in shutting out the Anteaters
7-0. The match upped the second
ranked Cardinal's dual-match
record to 11-1 on the season — its
only loss coming at the hands of
No. 1 UCLA in the finals of the
National Indoor Championships.
Friday, Stanford simply domi
nated Irvine up and down the line
up, dropping only one set in the
entire match.

" Irvine is not at all a bad team,"
Stanford head coach Dick Gould
said. "We just tended to business
on the court. Overall, I thought we
played a really great match out
there."
Leading the charge for the Car
dinal was senior captain Jeff
Salzenstein. Salzenstein, who has
played first singles for the Cardi
nal all year long, improved his
dual-match record to an even 5-5
and bolstered his overall record to
15-6 with a convincing 6-2, 7-5
win over Irvine's top player, Marc-
Andre Tardif.
"Jeff looks better every time
out," said Gould of the nation's
sixth-ranked player. "He gave a
good effort all around."
In the most exciting match of
the day, Stanford senior Jim
Thomas pulled out a come-fro m
behind three-set victory over Ju
lian Foxon, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, to pre
serve his perfect dual-match
record at 10-0. Thomas, now

ranked 29th nationally and the
only remaining undefeated Cardi
nal player, played second singles
for the first time in his collegiate
career against Irvine. Perhaps un
accustomed to playing so high in
the Cardinal lineup, he came out a
little tight to begin the match.
"Jim showed the effects that
moving up in the lineup can some
times have," Gould said. "He
seemed a little nervous at times,
and missed some of his shots. But
I give him a lot of credit for settling
down and coming back to win."
After bouncing back to take the
second set, Thomas was in danger
of dropping the match after losing
the first three games of the decid
ing set. Thomas didn't let the
pressure of playing from behind
affect him, however — he held
serve in the fourth game to get on
the board, 1-3, and then broke
right back in the fifth game to put
the players back on serve. Once he
had captured that break, Thomas
said he thought he had the match in
control.
"I thought he was lucky to break
me when he did," Thomas said. "I
knew all along that if I played one
point at a time he wouldn't be able
to close me out. Then when I broke
him back, I think he got a little de
flated and began to question
whether or not he could win the
match. I knew I could win at that
point."
Stanford won the rest of its sin
gles matches in straight sets. 24th
ranked sophomore Paul Goldstein
(17-6) dropped only four games on
his way to winning 6-3, 6-1 at the
No. 3 spot, while 4 lst-ranked junior
Grant Elliott knocked off his oppo
nent, 6-3,6-4 in the fourth slot to up
his dual match record to 9-2 (13-3
overall).
In the quickest match of the day,
No. 52-ranked Ricky Becker (10-1)
disposed of Irvine's Cameran
Lindee 6-0,6-0.
"We call him 'the Doctor' be
cause he slices, dices and carves up
his opponents like a surgeon," said
third-ranked freshman Ryan
Wolters, who was unable to play
against Irvine due to a stress frac
ture in his left foot. "Ricky obvious
ly had the right medicine out there

on the court today. You've got to
play really well to beat a guy the way
he did."
In the second-closest match of
the day, sophomore Charles Hoevel
er, normally not a starter for the
Cardinal, ousted his opponent 7-5,
6-4 after falling behind 1-4 in both
sets.
"I was proud of Charles for com
ing out with a win in that match,"
Gould said. "He doesn't get to play
in a whole lot of matches, but he
competed hard and didn't let being
down get to him."
Salzenstein was particularly
happy with the focus his team had in
the singles matches, especially after
some had voiced concern that Stan
ford would have trouble "getting
up" for Irvine because of pressing
academic work and lack of singles
play in the two previous weeks. "It
was a good match for us to play, and
we played well," the team captain
said. "We hadn't played singles in a
good while, but we came out ready
to go and that's what we need to do."
The doubles teams fared equally
well, as the Card swept all three
matches. The fourth-ranked pair of
Thomas and Goldstein won 8-3 in
the first position, and the "Road
Warriors," Becker and Elliott, had
no trouble in the third slot, winning
8-2.
The second doubles match was
considerably closer. Salzenstein and
sophomore Misha Palecek, who had
never previously played together,
faced Irvine's previously-undefeat-

Ed duo of Lindee and Steve Tallack
son. Salzy and Palecek broke the
Anteater duo at 3-3 and rode the
break out, winning 8-6.
Gould said that the match
against Irvine was a good way for
the Cardinal to end the quarter.
"This match was really a tribute to
the guys having worked hard. It's a
nice way to head into the short
break we have now," he said.
The break is indeed short. While
the Stanford players do not have
any matches during dead week or fi
nals, they have three matches
scheduled over spring break, begin
ning with a March 27 match versus
BYU. That will be followed by two
important Pac-10 conference
matches at Arizona and Arizona
State.
"It's always tough going to Ari
zona," Gould said. "There's a lot of
driving and those teams are pretty
good. But I think we'll come out all
right."
"We've got to keep working hard
and putting out the effort," Salzen
stein said. "It is really important for
us to concentrate on the Pac-10
teams. The Arizona schools are
scary teams. We're expected to win,
and it isn't always easy to do."
Gould's team will also use this
break to get healthy. Wolters hopes
to fully recover from the stress frac
ture in his foot in time for the BYU
match. If all goes well for the star
freshman, he will begin practicing
again the Saturday after exam
week.

whether or not he could win the
match. I knew I could win at that
point."
Stanford won the rest of its sin
gles matches in straight sets. 24th
ranked sophomore Paul Goldstein
(17-6) dropped only four games on
his way to winning 6-3, 6-1 at the
No. 3 spot, while 4 lst-ranked junior
Grant Elliott knocked off his oppo
nent, 6-3,6-4 in the fourth slot to up
his dual match record to 9-2 (13-3
overall).
In the quickest match of the day,
No. 52-ranked Ricky Becker (10-1)
disposed of Irvine's Cameran
Lindee 6-0,6-0.
"We call him 'the Doctor' be
cause he slices, dices and carves up
his opponents like a surgeon," said
third-ranked freshman Ryan
Wolters, who was unable to play
against Irvine due to a stress frac
ture in his left foot. "Ricky obvious
ly had the right medicine out there

on the court today. You've got to
play really well to beat a guy the way
he did."
In the second-closest match of
the day, sophomore Charles Hoevel
er, normally not a starter for the
Cardinal, ousted his opponent 7-5,
6-4 after falling behind 1-4 in both
sets.
"I was proud of Charles for com
ing out with a win in that match,"
Gould said. "He doesn't get to play
in a whole lot of matches, but he
competed hard and didn't let being
down get to him."
Salzenstein was particularly
happy with the focus his team had in
the singles matches, especially after
some had voiced concern that Stan
ford would have trouble "getting
up" for Irvine because of pressing
academic work and lack of singles
play in the two previous weeks. "It
was a good match for us to play, and
we played well," the team captain
said. "We hadn't played singles in a
good while, but we came out ready
to go and that's what we need to do."
The doubles teams fared equally
well, as the Card swept all three
matches. The fourth-ranked pair of
Thomas and Goldstein won 8-3 in
the first position, and the "Road
Warriors," Becker and Elliott, had
no trouble in the third slot, winning
8-2.
The second doubles match was
considerably closer. Salzenstein and
sophomore Misha Palecek, who had
never previously played together,
faced Irvine's previously-undefeat-

Ed duo of Lindee and Steve Tallack
son. Salzy and Palecek broke the
Anteater duo at 3-3 and rode the
break out, winning 8-6.
Gould said that the match
against Irvine was a good way for
the Cardinal to end the quarter.
"This match was really a tribute to
the guys having worked hard. It's a
nice way to head into the short
break we have now," he said.
The break is indeed short. While
the Stanford players do not have
any matches during dead week or fi
nals, they have three matches
scheduled over spring break, begin
ning with a March 27 match versus
BYU. That will be followed by two
important Pac-10 conference
matches at Arizona and Arizona
State.
"It's always tough going to Ari
zona," Gould said. "There's a lot of
driving and those teams are pretty
good. But I think we'll come out all
right."
"We've got to keep working hard
and putting out the effort," Salzen
stein said. "It is really important for
us to concentrate on the Pac-10
teams. The Arizona schools are
scary teams. We're expected to win,
and it isn't always easy to do."
Gould's team will also use this
break to get healthy. Wolters hopes
to fully recover from the stress frac
ture in his foot in time for the BYU
match. If all goes well for the star
freshman, he will begin practicing
again the Saturday after exam
week.

Stanford 7

Stanford men's tennis players
had enjoyed two weeks away from
singles competition heading into
their March 8 match with UC-
Irvine, but they showed no signs
of rustiness on the court last Fri
day in shutting out the Anteaters
7-0. The match upped the second
ranked Cardinal's dual-match
record to 11-1 on the season — its
only loss coming at the hands of
No. 1 UCLA in the finals of the
National Indoor Championships.
Friday, Stanford simply domi
nated Irvine up and down the line
up, dropping only one set in the
entire match.

" Irvine is not at all a bad team,"
Stanford head coach Dick Gould
said. "We just tended to business
on the court. Overall, I thought we
played a really great match out
there."
Leading the charge for the Car
dinal was senior captain Jeff
Salzenstein. Salzenstein, who has
played first singles for the Cardi
nal all year long, improved his
dual-match record to an even 5-5
and bolstered his overall record to
15-6 with a convincing 6-2, 7-5
win over Irvine's top player, Marc-
Andre Tardif.
"Jeff looks better every time
out," said Gould of the nation's
sixth-ranked player. "He gave a
good effort all around."
In the most exciting match of
the day, Stanford senior Jim
Thomas pulled out a come-fro m
behind three-set victory over Ju
lian Foxon, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, to pre
serve his perfect dual-match
record at 10-0. Thomas, now

ranked 29th nationally and the
only remaining undefeated Cardi
nal player, played second singles
for the first time in his collegiate
career against Irvine. Perhaps un
accustomed to playing so high in
the Cardinal lineup, he came out a
little tight to begin the match.
"Jim showed the effects that
moving up in the lineup can some
times have," Gould said. "He
seemed a little nervous at times,
and missed some of his shots. But
I give him a lot of credit for settling
down and coming back to win."
After bouncing back to take the
second set, Thomas was in danger
of dropping the match after losing
the first three games of the decid
ing set. Thomas didn't let the
pressure of playing from behind
affect him, however — he held
serve in the fourth game to get on
the board, 1-3, and then broke
right back in the fifth game to put
the players back on serve. Once he
had captured that break, Thomas
said he thought he had the match in
control.
"I thought he was lucky to break
me when he did," Thomas said. "I
knew all along that if I played one
point at a time he wouldn't be able
to close me out. Then when I broke
him back, I think he got a little de
flated and began to question
whether or not he could win the
match. I knew I could win at that
point."
