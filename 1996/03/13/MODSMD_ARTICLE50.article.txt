Stanford men's tennis players
had enjoyed two weeks away from
singles competition heading into
their March 8 match with UC-
Irvine, but they showed no signs
of rustiness on the court last Fri
day in shutting out the Anteaters
7-0. The match upped the second
ranked Cardinal's dual-match
record to 11-1 on the season — its
only loss coming at the hands of
No. 1 UCLA in the finals of the
National Indoor Championships.
Friday, Stanford simply domi
nated Irvine up and down the line
up, dropping only one set in the
entire match.

" Irvine is not at all a bad team,"
Stanford head coach Dick Gould
said. "We just tended to business
on the court. Overall, I thought we
played a really great match out
there."
Leading the charge for the Car
dinal was senior captain Jeff
Salzenstein. Salzenstein, who has
played first singles for the Cardi
nal all year long, improved his
dual-match record to an even 5-5
and bolstered his overall record to
15-6 with a convincing 6-2, 7-5
win over Irvine's top player, Marc-
Andre Tardif.
"Jeff looks better every time
out," said Gould of the nation's
sixth-ranked player. "He gave a
good effort all around."
In the most exciting match of
the day, Stanford senior Jim
Thomas pulled out a come-fro m
behind three-set victory over Ju
lian Foxon, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, to pre
serve his perfect dual-match
record at 10-0. Thomas, now

ranked 29th nationally and the
only remaining undefeated Cardi
nal player, played second singles
for the first time in his collegiate
career against Irvine. Perhaps un
accustomed to playing so high in
the Cardinal lineup, he came out a
little tight to begin the match.
"Jim showed the effects that
moving up in the lineup can some
times have," Gould said. "He
seemed a little nervous at times,
and missed some of his shots. But
I give him a lot of credit for settling
down and coming back to win."
After bouncing back to take the
second set, Thomas was in danger
of dropping the match after losing
the first three games of the decid
ing set. Thomas didn't let the
pressure of playing from behind
affect him, however — he held
serve in the fourth game to get on
the board, 1-3, and then broke
right back in the fifth game to put
