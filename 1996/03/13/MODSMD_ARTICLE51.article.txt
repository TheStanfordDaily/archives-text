The postseason prospects of the tenth-ranked Stan
ford men's volleyball team were not looking good as it
headed into last weekend. With a 6-5 mark in Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation play and a four-match losing
streak, the Cardinal spikers were faced with the unsa

out junior middle blocker Brian Moore, who missed his
second week of competition due to a foot injury.
No Moore? No problem.
Playing their most inspired volleyball of the year,
Stanford shocked third-ranked Long Beach State 15-13,

opposite Matt Fuerbringer led the charge. Defensively,
Stanford harassed the 49ers into 14 first-game errors
and a .269 hitting percentage as the Cardinal grabbed a
one-game lead.
"I turned to assistant coach A 1 Roderigues and told
him, 'It's nice to be in it early,' " Nieves said.
Stanford and Long Beach matched each other almost
point-for-point in game two. Clutch play by middle
blocker Mike Hoefer, who had 16 kills and a blistering
.609 hitting percentage, kept the score close until Stan
ford eventually tied the score at 14 before surging ahead
for the win.
Game three stayed close early on, but eventually
Long Beach broke down, committing 11 errors, and
