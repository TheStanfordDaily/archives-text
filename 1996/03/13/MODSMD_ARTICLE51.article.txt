The postseason prospects of the tenth-ranked Stan
ford men's volleyball team were not looking good as it
headed into last weekend. With a 6-5 mark in Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation play and a four-match losing
streak, the Cardinal spikers were faced with the unsa
vory task of playing two top-10 teams on the road with
out junior middle blocker Brian Moore, who missed his
second week of competition due to a foot injury.
No Moore? No problem.
Playing their most inspired volleyball of the year,
Stanford shocked third-ranked Long Beach State 15-13,
16-14,15-8 on Friday night, then followed up with a five
game thriller over No. 8 USC on Saturday (12-15,15-8,

12-15, 16-14, 15-12) to improve to 8-5 in league play
while moving into a third-place tie with Pacific.
"Things really fell into place for us," said Stanford
head coach Ruben Nieves. "It was a real gutsy perfor
mance and they definitely responded to the pressure."
Coming off of one of their most disappointing losses in
years, the Cardinal spikers quickly showed they were a
different team on Friday night at Long Beach, displaying
a high intensity level from the start.
The Cardinal was handling its serves and passing the
ball well, as junior swing hitter Aaron Garcia and junior
opposite Matt Fuerbringer led the charge. Defensively,
Stanford harassed the 49ers into 14 first-game errors
and a .269 hitting percentage as the Cardinal grabbed a
one-game lead.
"I turned to assistant coach A 1 Roderigues and told
him, 'It's nice to be in it early,' " Nieves said.
Stanford and Long Beach matched each other almost
point-for-point in game two. Clutch play by middle
blocker Mike Hoefer, who had 16 kills and a blistering
.609 hitting percentage, kept the score close until Stan
ford eventually tied the score at 14 before surging ahead
for the win.
Game three stayed close early on, but eventually
Long Beach broke down, committing 11 errors, and
Stanford was able to pull away for
the upset sweep.
"A lot of people were starting to
count us out," Nieves said. "We were
definitely in a corner heading into
the road trip but we responded well.
It was the best we've played."
Saturday night saw some a re
turn of the bad habits that had ham
pered the Cardinal during its four
match rut. The men managed to run
off to an 8-3 lead on the Trojans, but
their sharp passing from the prior
match was not there, and USC's ag
gressive jump serving got the Tro
jans back in the game.
"The key is handling their
serves," Nieves said. "And we just
weren't doing that early on."
After choking away its lead in
game one, Stanford won the second
game handily to tie up matters at
one game apiece. But the Cardinal
spikers got behind early again in
game three. The Trojans rained kills
on them all game long, with fresh
man Gabe Gardner leading the
charge with 34. Stanford made a late
run to close the gap to 13-12, but
Garcia's hitting error on game point
gave USC a two games-to-one lead.
Game four provided the key turn
ing point of the match, if not the sea
son. The match appeared over after
the Trojans jumped out to a 13-7
lead, but Garcia's passmg and side
out game stabilised the team and
Stanford slowly chipped away at the
deficit.
"The guys just did not give up,"
Nieves said. "Also, USC was falter
ing. We were putting the pressure on
and they started to miss more
serves."
Eventually, the Cardinal over
came the deficit and forced the
quick-rally game five. With the Tro
jans on their heels, Stanford got an
early one-point lead and eventually
stretched it to four at 14-10. USC
made one last run before its serve on
match point sailed out of bounds,
completing an unlikely two-game
road sweep for the Cardinal.
"[The season] definitely felt like it
was slipping away," Nieves said.
"Some nails were already in the cof
fin, but we're out of the coffin and
back in the race."
Now 9-5 overall, the Stanford
spikers face a stretch of five home
games. This weekend the Cardinal
faces La Verne and Ohio in two
non-conference matches. The 12th
ranked Buckeyes are 8-0 in the Mid

west Intercollegiate Volleyball Asso
ciation and 12-2 overall.
After a week off for finals, Stan
ford will face California on March
25, followed by matches against Pep
perdine and Loyola Marymount on
the March 29 and 30, respectively.
"We intentionally scheduled the
Cal match right after finals to get the
team back in a competitive mode,"

Nieves said.
As for Pepperdine, the Waves are
currently fourth in the Mountain
Division and boast one of the tallest
lineups in the league.
LMU, on the other hand, has fall
en out of the rankings, a season full
of promise gone down in flames.
After starting 2-3, they have won
only once in their last 13 matches.
