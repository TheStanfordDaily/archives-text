# Carey's comeback trail will take him to Atlanta
## Fifth-year senior returns from shoulder injury to earn spot on 1996 Olympic Team 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. - At
the U.S. Swimming Olympic
Team Trials, mere fractions of a
second mean the difference be
tween the thrill and honor of com
peting for the United States in the
Olympic Games and the agony
and disappointment of missing
out on a life-long dream.
Stanford's Ray Carey has expe
rienced both emotions.
Last Friday, the fifth-year se
nior swam to a personal-best
time of 1:57.66 in the 200 butter
fly, finishing second and earning
a spot on the 1996 United States
Olympic Team. Michigan's Tom
Malchow won the race in
1:57.39. Only the top two swim
mers in every race qualify for the
squad.
Four years ago, in this same

pool, Carey touched the wall
fourth in the 200 fly, just 0.17 sec
onds off the coveted second-place
position. At the trials, there is
nothing — except perhaps person
al satisfaction — for swimmers
who finish out of the top-two.
Friday night, defending
Olympic 200 fly champion Mel
Stewart swam to third place, 0.23
behind Carey. Facing the press
with sadness and disappointment
on his face, Stewart summed up
the intensity and the unforgiving
truth of the Olympic Trials.
"I've always been taught that
first place is first place and second
place is last place," Stewart said.
"At the Olympic Trials, first is
first and second is first — third is
last. I just got last place."
Stewart, who won the event at
trials in 1992, was swimming to
ward a berth on the Olympic team
until he was chased down by

Carey in a furious three-way bat
tle to the wall. Carey trailed Stew
art by just over half of a second at
the 150-meter mark before over
taking the American record hold
er in the last 15 meters as the ca
pacity crowd at Indiana Universi
ty Natatorium roared its encour
agement. Carey's sprinted to a
final split of 30:54, fastest in the
field.
But his thrilling comeback in
the last lap Friday was not the
only one Carey has had to make
recently in his swimming career.
Two years ago, at the World
Championships in Rome, Carey
sustained a shoulder injury while
swimming the 200 fly. Carey suf
fered from long thoracic nerve
palsy due to a virus, resulting in
the degeneration of a nerve in his
right shoulder. Seventeen months
ago, Carey could not lift his right
arm above his head, much less

swim butterfly.
The injury forced Carey to red
shirt last year while he rehabili
tated the arm. The process was
hard work and left him lonely at
times as his Cardinal teammates
competed without him, but Carey
credits the layoff as the main fac
tor in the race which earned him a
trip to Atlanta this summer.
"I spent nine months kicking
and biking and running and I
thought that showed in the last 50
where my legs didn't die," Carey
said. "In a 200 fly, your legs usual
ly give way first. That's the part of
my swimming that's improved the
most in the last two years and I
think that's what made the differ
ence."
Stanford men's coach and the
head men's Olympic coach Skip
Kenney doesn't just think that
made the difference. He is sure of
it.

"I'm convinced that Ray made
the Olympic team because of his
injury," Kenney said. "Thereason
I say that is because he concen
trated on kicking — he put his legs
in an area of conditioning that I've
never seen before. I think the in
jury was a real blessing in dis
guise."
Carey never doubted that he
would return as a top contender
by the time trials rolled around,
but often as he rehabilitated by
himself in the diving well, the in
jury felt like anything but a bless
ing.
"The doctor said (recovery)
would take six to nine months,
and of course I heard six to six
months," Carey said. "It took the
nine months get around — it was
long enough and boring enough to
motivate me. I thought, 'There
better be a reason for this.' I came
back training hard and had a great
meet last summer at (national
championships) — I used that to
really springboard me toward this
meet."
If Carey needed any extra in
centive and inspiration to swim
his way onto the Olympic team, he
got it on the first night of competi
tion, when his close friend and
teammate Kurt Grote placed sec
ond in the 100 breaststroke. With
two days until his event, Carey
tried to keep his emotions steady,
concentrating on the business of
joining Grote at the Atlanta
Games.
"I knew I could deal with the
excitement of my race and the
crowd and things like that," Carey
said. "I was thinking, 'If Kurt
swims really fast and makes the
Olympic team, I'm going to be so
excited for him. How am I going to
be able to deal with that excite
ment?; That was probably the
hardest thing I've faced this week,
being really excited for Kurt and
saying to myself, 'Calm down,
relax, you still have to do your
job.' "
Carey did his job well. So well,
in fact, that his time was good

enough to move him ahead of Car
dinal great Pablo Morales
(1:57.75) on the Ail-Time U.S.
Performers list. Carey is now the
third-fastest American ever and
the ninth-fastest man of all-time
in the 200 fly. Morales, the gold
medalist in the 100 fly in 1992,
was training for Barcelona when
Carey arrived at Stanford in the
fall of 1991.
"Pablo helped me a lot," Carey
said. "He was an unbelievable in
spiration, so (moving ahead of
Morales) just adds to the feel of
tonight."
Because of his incredible deter
mination and his presence on the
Stanford team as a leader and
role-model, it was hard for his
coach and teammates to not feel
overcome by emotion when Carey
achieved his goal.
"It was an emotional race even
before it started because of what
Ray means to me and what Ray
means to the team," Kenney said.
"You knew it was going to be emo
tional and I really thought Ray
had a chance to win. I just don't
think there is anyone out there
more dedicated."
Grote felt every bit as excited
for Carey as Carey had felt for him
two nights before.
"It was the most emotional
race I've ever watched," Grote
said. "I was shaking — I couldn't
sleep the night after he raced be
cause I care so much about him as
a person and I knew how badly he
wanted to make the team. It was a
nerve-wracking experience but it
was the ultimate high when he
made it."
When he arrives in Atlanta,
there is no question as to what
goal Carey will bring with him. He
wants to be the best.
"The goal here at trials is to
make the Olympic team," Carey
said. "At the Olympics, your goal
has got to be to win the gold
medal, no matter what is going on
— to achieve the best that can be
achieved. For me, the goal is to
race for that medal."

position. At the trials, there is
nothing — except perhaps person
al satisfaction — for swimmers
who finish out of the top-two.
Friday night, defending
Olympic 200 fly champion Mel
Stewart swam to third place, 0.23
behind Carey. Facing the press
with sadness and disappointment
on his face, Stewart summed up
the intensity and the unforgiving
truth of the Olympic Trials.
"I've always been taught that
first place is first place and second
place is last place," Stewart said.
"At the Olympic Trials, first is
first and second is first — third is
last. I just got last place."
Stewart, who won the event at
trials in 1992, was swimming to
ward a berth on the Olympic team
until he was chased down by

Carey in a furious three-way bat
tle to the wall. Carey trailed Stew
art by just over half of a second at
the 150-meter mark before over
taking the American record hold
er in the last 15 meters as the ca
pacity crowd at Indiana Universi
ty Natatorium roared its encour
agement. Carey's sprinted to a
final split of 30:54, fastest in the
field.
But his thrilling comeback in
the last lap Friday was not the
only one Carey has had to make
recently in his swimming career.
Two years ago, at the World
Championships in Rome, Carey
sustained a shoulder injury while
swimming the 200 fly. Carey suf
fered from long thoracic nerve
palsy due to a virus, resulting in
the degeneration of a nerve in his
right shoulder. Seventeen months
ago, Carey could not lift his right
arm above his head, much less

swim butterfly.
The injury forced Carey to red
shirt last year while he rehabili
tated the arm. The process was
hard work and left him lonely at
times as his Cardinal teammates
competed without him, but Carey
credits the layoff as the main fac
tor in the race which earned him a
trip to Atlanta this summer.
"I spent nine months kicking
and biking and running and I
thought that showed in the last 50
where my legs didn't die," Carey
said. "In a 200 fly, your legs usual
ly give way first. That's the part of
my swimming that's improved the
most in the last two years and I
think that's what made the differ
ence."
Stanford men's coach and the
head men's Olympic coach Skip
Kenney doesn't just think that
made the difference. He is sure of
it.

"I'm convinced that Ray made
the Olympic team because of his
injury," Kenney said. "Thereason
I say that is because he concen
trated on kicking — he put his legs
in an area of conditioning that I've
never seen before. I think the in
jury was a real blessing in dis
guise."
Carey never doubted that he
would return as a top contender
by the time trials rolled around,
but often as he rehabilitated by
himself in the diving well, the in
jury felt like anything but a bless
ing.
"The doctor said (recovery)
would take six to nine months,
and of course I heard six to six
months," Carey said. "It took the
nine months get around — it was
long enough and boring enough to
motivate me. I thought, 'There
better be a reason for this.' I came
back training hard and had a great
meet last summer at (national
championships) — I used that to
really springboard me toward this
meet."
If Carey needed any extra in
centive and inspiration to swim
his way onto the Olympic team, he
got it on the first night of competi
tion, when his close friend and
teammate Kurt Grote placed sec
ond in the 100 breaststroke. With
two days until his event, Carey
tried to keep his emotions steady,
concentrating on the business of
joining Grote at the Atlanta
Games.
"I knew I could deal with the
excitement of my race and the
crowd and things like that," Carey
said. "I was thinking, 'If Kurt
swims really fast and makes the
Olympic team, I'm going to be so
excited for him. How am I going to
be able to deal with that excite
ment?; That was probably the
hardest thing I've faced this week,
being really excited for Kurt and
saying to myself, 'Calm down,
relax, you still have to do your
job.' "
Carey did his job well. So well,
in fact, that his time was good

enough to move him ahead of Car
dinal great Pablo Morales
(1:57.75) on the Ail-Time U.S.
Performers list. Carey is now the
third-fastest American ever and
the ninth-fastest man of all-time
in the 200 fly. Morales, the gold
medalist in the 100 fly in 1992,
was training for Barcelona when
Carey arrived at Stanford in the
fall of 1991.
"Pablo helped me a lot," Carey
said. "He was an unbelievable in
spiration, so (moving ahead of
Morales) just adds to the feel of
tonight."
Because of his incredible deter
mination and his presence on the
Stanford team as a leader and
role-model, it was hard for his
coach and teammates to not feel
overcome by emotion when Carey
achieved his goal.
"It was an emotional race even
before it started because of what
Ray means to me and what Ray
means to the team," Kenney said.
"You knew it was going to be emo
tional and I really thought Ray
had a chance to win. I just don't
think there is anyone out there
more dedicated."
Grote felt every bit as excited
for Carey as Carey had felt for him
two nights before.
"It was the most emotional
race I've ever watched," Grote
said. "I was shaking — I couldn't
sleep the night after he raced be
cause I care so much about him as
a person and I knew how badly he
wanted to make the team. It was a
nerve-wracking experience but it
was the ultimate high when he
made it."
When he arrives in Atlanta,
there is no question as to what
goal Carey will bring with him. He
wants to be the best.
"The goal here at trials is to
make the Olympic team," Carey
said. "At the Olympics, your goal
has got to be to win the gold
medal, no matter what is going on
— to achieve the best that can be
achieved. For me, the goal is to
race for that medal."

Senior Ray Carey surges ahead in the finals of the 200-meter butterfly.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. - At
the U.S. Swimming Olympic
Team Trials, mere fractions of a
second mean the difference be
tween the thrill and honor of com
peting for the United States in the
Olympic Games and the agony
and disappointment of missing
out on a life-long dream.
Stanford's Ray Carey has expe
rienced both emotions.
Last Friday, the fifth-year se
nior swam to a personal-best
time of 1:57.66 in the 200 butter
fly, finishing second and earning
a spot on the 1996 United States
Olympic Team. Michigan's Tom
Malchow won the race in
1:57.39. Only the top two swim
mers in every race qualify for the
squad.
Four years ago, in this same

pool, Carey touched the wall
fourth in the 200 fly, just 0.17 sec
onds off the coveted second-place
position. At the trials, there is
nothing — except perhaps person
al satisfaction — for swimmers
who finish out of the top-two.
