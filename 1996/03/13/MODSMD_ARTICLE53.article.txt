# Swimmers change focus to NCAA championships
## Women look to defend title in Ann Arbor 
### Ratha Harntha Staff writer 
For the first time in recent mem
ory, the Stanford women's swim
ming will not be the clear-cut fa
vorites when NCAA Champi
onships kick off in Ann Arbor,
Mich., on March 21-23.
"We have to have a great team ef
fort," said head coach Richard
Quick. "It is going to be the most
wide-open NCAAs since I've been at
Stanford. I think there are four or
five teams with a chance to win a
national championship. It's going
to be a wonderful team battle."
Michigan, Southern Methodist
and USC all have legitimate shots
at ending the Cardinal's streak of
four consecutive national titles. In
the last seven years, Stanford has
taken home five championships
and finished twice both other years.
As far as head-to-head competi
tion, the Cardinal defeated the
Wolverines in Ann Arbor on Oct. 21
by a score of 174-126. But the Tro
jans ended Stanford's eight-year
undefeated record in dual meets on
Jan. 27 when they edged the Cardi
nal 154-147. Stanford has not met
SMU in a dual meet this year.
"All these teams, if they have an
incredible meet, they can win," said

senior co-captain Jane Skillman.
Aside from all of the competition
the Cardinal will face, it also must
contend with the limited amount of
time between this week's U.S.
Olympic Trials and the NCAAs, as
well as the different mind-sets of
the swimmers at the two meets.
"It will take a change in thinking
more than anything, because there
is very little training between now
and the NCAAs," Quick said. "The
main thing is, it goes from being an
individual meet to a team effort. It's
a huge, huge difference.
Cardinal swimmers have not
performed as well as they would
have liked at the Olympic Trials and
it is unsure whether or not they will
have enough time to rebound from
this week's competition.
"Olympic Trials are a long meet,
with a lot of ups and downs," Skill
man added. "We're trying to take
the positive things from this meet
and throw away the negatives and
get ready to go into NCAAs ready
for a humongous meet because
there are about four schools who
will have a chance to win. It's the
first time it's been like this for a
while."
But not everything is going
against the Cardinal. Every school
must face the same time con

straints, and no school can match
Stanford's experience. No other
team in the team in the country has
as many swimmers who have won
national titles. Then again, no other
team has won the NCAA champi
onship in the past four years.
Stanford has three-quarters of
its swimmers back from the 200-
meter medley relay and 400-meter
freestyle teams that won titles last
year. In addition, junior Claudia
Franco and senior Jessica Tong fin
ished second in the 50-meter
freestyle and 100-meter backstroke,
respectively, while junior Sarah An
derson took third in the 500-meter
freestyle. Tong, Franco, sophomore
Amy Ohlberhelman and junior
Michelle Jesperson also return to
the 800-meter freestyle relay team
that placed second last year.
Skillman is of the opinion that
experience will play a huge factor.
"We won't take anything for grant
ed, that's for sure. You never know
what's going to happen," the senior
said.
The Cardinal has already proven
its resilience this year. After the loss
to USC, the team rebounded at the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships by crushing the field to win
its tenth consecutive conference
title.
