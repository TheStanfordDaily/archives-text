# Men head to Austin to capture NCAA crown
## 
### John Fabian Staff writer 
Two-and-a-half short weeks
from now, the Stanford men's
swimming team will depart for
Austin, Tex., to battle for its fourth
national championship in five
years. While several members of the
team are competing at the U.S.
Olympic Trials, another group of
swimmers who have already quali
fied for the NCAA championships is
cheering them on from campus and
awaiting their return to the Farm
so that they can pool their excite
ment together.
"We're in kind of a tough spot,
getting focused with less than half
of the team here," said junior Scott
Jones. "But the guys here are really
excited about getting the whole
team back together. For the first
time this year, we will all be focused
on one thing."
Like last year, the Cardinal has
improved throughout the season,
rising from a team with an outside
shot at the title to a team expected
to be one of the main competitors.
Unlike most seasons, however,
there is not one or even two clear fa
vorites heading into the champi
onships March 28-30. Michigan,
Stanford, Texas, and Auburn are

expected to battle closely in of the
most eagerly anticipated NCAA
championships of the past twenty
years.
"They way we've been swim
ming, other teams are expecting
now more than they have been,"
said junior Casey Harmon. "I doubt
we're expected to win, but I don't
think they realize that we will if we
do things right."
If the Cardinal can maintain its
focus, and carry out its race strate
gies in the water, it has a good shot
at another national championship.
"We want to win," Jones said.
"Our expectations are higher than
anyone else's are for us. That's an
awesome position to be in. Other
teams might not be expecting us to
really compete. If they aren't,
they're going to be surprised."
Throughout the season, this
Stanford team has had to deal with
the problem of having dual foci —
one group of veteran swimmers
concentrating on the Olympic Tri
als, the remainder of the team con
centrating solely on the NCAAs.
Once the trials are over, though, the
team will have one unified goal.
"The responsibility is on the
guys who did not go to the trials to
help the others quickly re-focus as
soon as they get back," Harmon

said. "Once they get here, they
might need a half a day or so to have
some down time and recuperate.
It's going to be important for us to
get them back on the bandwagon
with the rest of the team and get ex
cited."
Some of the swimmers at the tri
als are already getting excited about
returning to the team. After com
peting in such an intensely individ
ually-focused event, the idea of re
turning to the strong team atmos
phere that Stanford maintains is
inviting.
"I talked to Scott Claypool
tod;v Jones said. "It was fun to
talk uj him, because he was talking
about how different the individuii
competition there is from the team
competitions we're used to. He was
saying how he missed the team at
mosphere, and is already getting ex
cited about NCAAs."
Senior co-captain Ray Carey
maintains that the strain of the
Olympic Trials should not hold any
of the swimmers back from having
an excellent NCAA meet, even if
they do not make the U.S. team.
"If you go into trials and have a
tough race and swim tough, it gives
a lot of confidence," Carey said. "If
you go in as an Olympian, you're
going to be unbeatable."
