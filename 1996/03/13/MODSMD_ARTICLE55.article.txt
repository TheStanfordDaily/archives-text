# Fencers to try for first NCAA title
## 
### Laura Drum Senior staff writer 
The men's and women's fencing teams will wrap
up a season unprecedented in Stanford history with a
trip to the NCAA championships at Yale from March
29 to April 1.
Tomorrow, an NCAA committee will determine
the participants in this competition of competitions.
Stanford has recommended nine fencers to the board
— the men's contingent consists of sophomore Sasha
Zucker and freshman Tim Chang in foil, senior Errol
Hunter and freshman James Chung in sabre, and
freshman Alden Clarke in epee, while the women hope
to send senior Stephanie Wien and freshman Lauren
O'Brien in epee and seniors Morgan Hoch and Chloe
Sladden in foil.
Sending nine representatives would be an impres
sive feat for the Cardinal, especially considering each
school can fiend no more than ten fencers, two in each
weapon. Although the athletes will compete individu
ally, overall placements in the NCAA tournament also

determine national rankings. With this strong of a
team, the eighth-ranked Stanford squad is anticipat
ing an increase in status.
"I expect us to be ranked fourth next year," said
head coach Zoran Tulum. "And in two years, we will
begin to attack the [national] title."
The Stanford fencing program appeared just a few
years ago. Now the team holds its own against the na
tion's best. "We are the big guys now," Tulum said.
"It's exciting to be here and be part of a growing
program," added Clarke. "We have the future to look
forward to."
This confidence is understandable in the afterglow
of the NCAA Western regionals, which the Cardinal
won two weeks ago in San Diego. In that tournament,
Stanford faced Air Force — last year's regional title
holders — in a tight competition. After a strong show
ing by both schools in the first four weapons, the bat
tle for first came down to the men's foil. Stanford had
to win eight of nine bouts in this weapon to claim the
Regional title. Pressed up against the wall, the Cardi
nal did just that, and walked away champions.
