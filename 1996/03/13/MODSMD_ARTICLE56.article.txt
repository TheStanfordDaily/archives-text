# Men's gymnastics falls to Cal
## 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
In front of one of the largest
crowds ever assembled for a Stan
ford men's gymnastics meet,
Stanford placed second in a five
school competition last Saturday
night at Burnham Pavilion. The
Cardinal finished with a score of
223.4, just short of California's
227.35, but ahead of Oklahoma's
223.25, Illinois' 218.65 and
UCLA's 217.65.
Despite Stanford's third loss to
Cal on the season, the team per
formed well overall, improving on
many of the mistakes it made a
week ago against the Golden
Bears.
The Cardinal put in a particu
larly strong showing through the
first four rounds of the competi
tion — the floor exercise, pommel
horse, rings and vault. Stanford
was in the lead after these four
events but relinquished the top
spot after the parallel bars, one of
the team's most glaring weakness

es. Several gymnasts then missed
their routines in the high bar —
the final event — contributing to
the relatively low score.
Head coach Sadao Hamada ex
pressed satisfaction with his
team's overall output. "I think we
did a very good job on four events,"
he said. "I understand [the weak
ness on the parallel bars] because
we are not doing enough routines.
They really kept the mental side
strong; they were calm, confident,
not too nervous. Every one of them
had the right frame of mind in the
competition.
"I was very satisfied. But skill
wise, we are not quite ready."
Hamada experts the top gym
nasts to be eventually scoring 9.8s
and the younger gymnasts to pro
duce 9.4 sand 9.55, instead of 8.95.
Junior lan Bachrach is quickly
developing into one of these top
gymnasts. Bachrach scored a
team-high 9.8 in his rings routine,
which his coach deemed "out
standing."
In fact, the usually stoic Hama

da broke character and hugged
Bachrach after his rings routine.
"I was absolutely ecstatic,"
Bachrach said. "For Sadao to give
me a hug is huge — it's pretty
amazing."
"The only other time Sadao has
ever hugged me was during (the
NCAA championships), when I hit
my event to clinch the title."
Junior Keith Wiley also turned
in a great performance Saturday,
placing second in individual
scores. Wiley, however, was more
concerned with his missed parallel
bar routine than with his success
es.
"Right before the parallel bars,
they announced the scores and we
were winning by two-tenths [of a
point]," said Wiley, who scored an
uncharacteristic 8.05 on the event.
"I think I got a little bit nervous.
But as a team, we had a lot more
hits and personally, I had a lot
more hits. I think it's because
we've been practicing more rou
tines and we're more focused this
weekend."
