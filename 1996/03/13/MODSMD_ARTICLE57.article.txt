# Cardinal women lose to Beavers
## 
### Keith Rabkin Contributing writer 
Last Friday, the Stanford
women's gymnastics team
dropped another close competition
to a Pacific 10 Conference oppo
nent when it lost its last home
meet of the season to sixth-ranked
Oregon State.
The loss brings the Cardinal's
record to 2-6 overall and 0-5 in the
Pac-10. Though most of these loss
es have been close, many of the
gymnasts are disappointed by
their unimpressive record.
"We came close in most of the
meets, but we hate to have to add
Pac-10 losses to our record," said
sophomore Keri Monahan.
Nonetheless, the 18th-ranked
Cardinal is proud of its perfor
mance of late, having broken the
Stanford all-around record three
times this year. On Friday the
women pulled it off again, shatter
ing the previous record of 193.725
with a score of 194.35.
"Our performance showed that

we are an up-and-coming team,"
Monahan said. "Everyone is sur
prised by how close we come to
beating the top teams."
Record or not, the Cardinal's
score was still not good enough to
defeat the Beavers, who came in
.225 points higher at 194.500. All
the Cardinal's Pac-10 losses have
been by 1.5 points or less, a deficit
the team hopes to overcome in the
postseason.
"We haven't competed to the
best of our ability against most of
the teams, but if we do we can beat
them," Monahan said.
With Friday's loss behind
them, the women will now look to
the future. Pac-10 Conference
championships begin Saturday at
Oregon State, and while the cham
pionships do not carry any more
weight than a regular-season away
meet, they represent one of the
most important meets of the sea
son.
"All Pac-10 opponents will be
there," Monahan said. "We have
come close to beating them before.

If we can perform to the best of our
ability, we may be able to earn a
couple of Pac-10 wins for our
record."
Stanford expects to battle it out
with rivals UCLA, Washington,
Arizona, Arizona State, and Ore
gon State for the conference title.
While each of those teams has de
feated Stanford this year, every
match has been close, and a strong
performance could vault the Car
dinal into the Pac-10's elite.
Last year the team finished
fifth in conference, but this year it
expects better. "We are focused
and confident going into the
meet," Monahan said. "Even
though it only counts as a [regular
season] meet, the pressure is on
since we want to place high in the
conference."
Monahan's performances have
been near-perfect of late, and she is
expected to place high among the
Pac-10's individual performers.
Nonetheless, Monahan is more
concerned about her team's per
formance than her own.
