# Rugby destroys Humboldt 71-5

### Neal Sweeney 
Needing a convincing win over Humboldt State to put
itself in a position to capture the league crown, the Stan
ford men's rugby team delivered last Saturday afternoon
with a 71-5 victory at Maloney Field.
Possibly suffering a minor letdown following last
week's Big Game victory over Cal, the Cardinal started
slow against Humboldt. Stanford controlled the tempo
in the first half, but a few key mistakes prevented the
men from putting the game away early.
"Knowing we needed to win big to improve our
chances of a league championship, we were a little too of
fensive-minded in the fust half," said senior co-captain
Jeff Siemon. "We got caught up in trying to score and lost
some balls on tackles."
At halitime, coach Franck Boivert reminded the team
that they must focus on the basics of the game — tack
ling, passing and support on the runs.
"Franck wasn't too happy with our performance in
the first half," said senior co- captain Bobby Blunt. "He
felt we weren't playing at the same level of effort as our
other games, but we picked it up in the second half."
In the second half, the Cardinal came out focused and
was able to wear down Humboldt by virtue of its superi
or speed and endurance.
"In the first half, we were trying to run through the
tackles, but in the second half we were able to capitalize
on our quickness and training," Siemon said. "We real
ized we were able to play much better by relaxing and try

ing to have fun rather than focusing on offense."
Cal's 23-15 win over UC-Davis on Saturday, coupled
with Stanford's convincing win over Humboldt, puts
the Cardinal in position to capture the league crown.
The Golden Bears' victory created a three-way dead
lock at the top of the Pacific Coast Rugby Union stand
ings, with Stanford, UC-Davis and Cal ail tied with one
loss. As a result, the league championship must be de
cided by the total number of tries scored in league
games. Stanford currently leads the three teams with
21 tries, followed by Davis with 11 and Cal with 10. But
while Stanford and Davis have finished their league
schedules, Cal plays Humboldt this Saturday in its final
league game.
The Bears will definitely press on ofTense against
Humboldt to try and catch Stanford's lead in total tries,
but the Cardinal's 10-try lead could prove insurmount
able. Chances are good that Stanford will win the tie
breaker, taking the league title and advancing directly to
the Sweet 16 of the national championship tournament
on April 20. The two other teams will be forced to play a
preliminary game against a tough team from Washing
ton or Oregon.
After Saturday's game against Sacramento State —
Stanford will rest and recover from a tough stretch of
games with light practices and weightlifting sessions.
Over spring break, the team plans to either stay at Stan
ford and work through a mini-training camp of grueling
two-a-day practices or travel to Canada to play Victoria
and British Columbia.
