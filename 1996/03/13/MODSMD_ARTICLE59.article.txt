# Women impress at Stanford Invite
## Water polo tops UC-Davis, hangs tough vs. No. 1 UCLA 
### Erin Bryla 
Victory was twice as nice last weekend, as the
women's water polo team defeated UC-Davis for the
second time in as many weekends.
The Cardinal allowed Davis only one goal in its 4-1
win at DeGuerre Pool last Friday in the Stanford Invi
tational. Four members of the Cardinal found the net
to make the victory a team effort.
The Cardinal played five other games on the week
end and came out on top against the UC-Santa Barbara
A and B teams and Davis B. But the Cardinal's most im
pressive play probably came in its loss to the No. 1-
ranked team in the nation, UCLA.
"They are a very, very good team," said junior Olivia
White. "We played exceedingly well. It is disappointing
when you come so close, but you can't really be upset
when you played so well."
The young Cardinal played tough defense to keep
the game close. The women allowed only two goals in
the first three quarters and pulled to within one when
Rachel Best gave the Card a goal of its own.
That's when the Bruins showed how they earned
their top ranking, overpowering Stanford by scoring
three late goals and putting the game out of reach.
Down just 2-1 at the start of the fourth quarter, the
Cardinal would not find the net again as the game
ended 5-1.
"Despite the loss, we played the best game of the
season," said head coach Ben Quittner.

The women took out their frustrations the next
morning in a 15-2 trouncing of UC-Santa Barbara's B
team. Lindsay Welsh and Lindsay Tam lead the offen
sive surge, combining for nine goals.
The Cardinal played Santa Barbara's A-team in the
afternoon and scrapped by with a 6-5 win. Julie Baker
led the scoring with three goals and Welsh added two.
Stanford also faced third-ranked California in the
afternoon. Again the Cardinal held tough through
three quarters of play, as the women kept the score
even at two apiece going into the final period. But the
Bears put on a late flurry in the fourth quarter, scoring
twice, while the Cardinal could only manage one goal
and had to concede a 5-3 defeat.
Sunday the Cardinal spanked the Davis B team by
12 goals, 10 of which came in the first half, as Tam and
Welsh combined for seven goals. The women then fol
lowed up the victory with an upset of Davis A in the af
ternoon.
"The tournament went really well," Quittner said.
"We keep proving ourselves against the best teams in
the country. [But] our offense still needs to improve
and we need to score more."
That's what the Cardinal will be working on over the
next three weeks. Friday, the women will have an op
portunity to avenge Saturday's 5-3 loss against Cal
when they meet the Golden Bears at 3 p.m. in
DeGuerre Pool.
"We still feel we can beat them even though they are
a little bigger and more experienced," Quittner said.
