# Kribel third in Texas
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Coming off of his worst per
formance of the season, Stan
ford golfer Joel Kribel could have
let the pressure and disappoint
ment cripple his game. Instead,
the Brannerite showed why he is
considered one of the top fresh
men in the nation.
Against the very best college
golfers in the nation, Kribel dis
played the wealth of talent which
allowed him to dominate the ju
nior circuit a year ago, posting
one of only four below-par scores
and finishing third individually
in the Golf Digest Collegiate In
vitational in Woodlands, Texas.
"I just worked really hard in
the time between our last tour
nament and this one and things
kind of came together," Kribel
said. "Whether is was raining or
whatever, I just put in the time,
hitting a lot on the range and
doing a lot of work with my
putting".
Unfortunately, as a team, the
17th-ranked Cardinal didn't
fare quite as well as Kribel,
charging out of the gate with a
strong first round only to fall
back to tenth place overall, be
hind such top rivals as winner
Nevada-Las Vegas, Texas and
defending national champion
Oklahoma State. However, the
team remained upbeat about its
progress thus far this season.
"I'm really proud of the
guys," said head coach Wally
Goodwin. "There are some signs
that we can be a really good ball
club.
"It's only natural to be a little
disappointed when you don't
win a tournament, but these are
the best teams in the country
and we really didn't play near
our ability. On any other given
day, we could have easily been
near the top of the board."
Set on the tremendously chal
lenging TPC-Woodlands course,
the event was clearly the tough
est test Stanford has faced all
season, featuring one of the most
fearsome collections of collegiate
talent to be assembled this sea
son. Of the 17 teams invited, 12
were ranked in the nation's top
15, including eight of the top
nine.

The weather played an adver
sarial role as well, battering the
players with strong winds and
frigid temperatures.
"It definitely made it difficult
for everybody," Kribel said. "As
we were teeing off on the first
day, the wind chill was down at
15 degrees."
After Kribel, sophomore Ail-
American Tiger Woods finished
a distant second on the team.
Woods lacked the brilliance that
has invariably become expected
of him, tailing off after a scorch
ing first-round 70 to record a
pair of five-over-par 77s en route
to a tie for 23rd overall. Illness
clearly took its toll on his game,
as he battled flu symptoms
throughout the weekend.
"Tiger really wasn't in top
shape physically," Goodwin said.
"It's just one of those types of
things where you can only chalk
it up to bad luck.
"He was four or five strokes
offhis average. With him playing
his normal game, we were easily
in the top five."
For the rest of the squad, it
was a matter of looking past the
scores to see a silver lining. Team
captain Jerry Chang, who had
problems in the team's last tour
nament, continued to struggle as
he posted an uncharacteristic
second-round 85 en route to
66th-place finish. However,
shades of the senior's old game
seemed to be returning as he
charged in on the final nine holes
with a one-under-par 35.
"Jerry's such a fighter,"
Goodwin said. "He's having a lit
tle trouble right now, but I know
that he won't let it get to him."
In the No. 4 spot, junior Con
rad Ray found the consistency
which had been so elusive before
in the season, posting three
straight 76s to finish in a tie for
52nd. The fifth man, Darren
Dragovich, showed signs of
progress as well, although the se
nior joined teammate Chang
with a 80-plus score in the sec
ond round.
"I was pretty pleased with
both guys [Ray and Dragovich],"
Goodwin said. "Conrad put to
gether his first solid perfor
mance in quite a while and Dar
ren is really starting to come
along.
