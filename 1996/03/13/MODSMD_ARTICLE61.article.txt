# Track and field garners six All-American honors
## 
### Sam Wang Contributing writer 
With the collective attention of
Stanford's athletic community riv
eted to the hardwood — where the
women's basketball team polished
off its Pacific 10 Conference sched
ule with an unblemished record and
their male counterparts secured a
berth in the Big Dance — nine Stan
ford track and field athletes quietly
flew to Indianapolis last weekend to
compete in the NCAA Indoor Track
and Field Championships.
The unheralded group of nine
runners entered the RCA Dome on
Friday and emerged a day later car
rying six All-American honors.
Among the triumphant Cardi
nal athletes was the women's dis
tance medley relay team consisting
of freshman Mary Cobb, redshirt
sophomore Monal Chokshi, junior
tri-captain Tyra Holt and senior tri
captain Dena Dey.
In what head coach Vin Lananna
described as a "courageous perfor
mance," the women finished with a
fifth-place time of 11:21.95, just .26
seconds behind fourth-place Penn
State, despite dropping the baton
on the second leg.
Holt was running in the 400-
meter leg when a Villanova athlete
running in the next lane accidental
ly knocked the baton out of her
hand. By the time Holt recovered
and made the exchange to Chokshi
for the 1,200-meter leg, the Cardi
nal team was in last place.
But Chokshi and anchor Mary
Cobb dug deep within themselves to
help the team overcome such a dis
astrous occurrence.
"They were really impressive to
come back as they did," Lananna
said. "When Monal got the stick,
they were dead-last by 15 meters.
Monal put us back into the race
and Mary Cobb ran a great anchor
leg."
Cobb had already assured her
self of a spot on the All-American
honor roll by running well in the
5,000 meters the previous day. Her
effort of 16:13.14 established a new
school indoor record for freshmen
and was good enough for a sixth
place finish.
"This is my second time running
this race," she said. "It's such a dif
ferent race. It's not a race I always
do, so I wanted to have fun with it.
This is my first indoor season ever
— I'm still trying to learn how to
run it, so I was happy."

A long jumper who strayed onto
the track during her warm-ups pro
vided some unexpected excitement
during Cobb's race. A runner in
Cobb's pack slammed into her,
causing momentary confusion.
Fortunately, the freshman was able
to recover quickly.
"We were able to not let it shake
us up. It was early in the race and
we got right back onto focus."
Hockey-like antics continued in
the 3,000, where redshirt sopho
more Monal Chokshi ran a time of
9:27.61 to take ninth place, good
enough to earn All-American hon
ors. Chokshi had to jockey continu
ously for space in her preliminary
heat so that she wouldn't be
trapped when the leaders made
their move.
"I got bumped a couple of times,
but I think everyone did," she said.
"That's the way the race was. You
just have to be careful. You can't
think about it because it's not going
to influence the race — they're not
going to disqualify anyone. You just
have to recover and then get right
back into it."
The male distance medley also
represented the Cardinal in Indi
anapolis. Junior Jimmie Johnson,
junior Tad Heath, redshirt sopho
more Jason Lunn and senior Mark
Fadil, all competing in their first
NCAAs ever, made up the men's
squad that finished in tenth place
with a time 9:58.43.
Johnson also qualified for the
400-meter sprint. Though he didn't
advance to the finals, Johnson said
he still enjoyed competing in his
first NCAA championships.
"This is the kind of meet you like
to run in because everyone pushes
each other to a good time," he said.
With NCAA championships
marking the end of the indoor sea
son, the outdoors continue to heat
up for Stanford with the Mustang
Invitational at San Luis Obispo this
weekend, to be followed by the
biggest track and field event hosted
at Stanford this year — the Stan
ford Invitational.
Thousands of track and field
athletes — high school, collegiate
and professional — will converge on
Stanford to celebrate the unveiling
of the Cobb Track and Angell Field,
the new home of Stanford track and
field. The Cardinal will be moving
from Stanford Stadium into a
brand-new facility that sports an
all-weather nine-lane track and
state-of-the-art equipment.
