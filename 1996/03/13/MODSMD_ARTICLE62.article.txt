# Softball turning its season around
## Women sweep OSU, split with Oregon to improve to 13-9 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
In just its third year of Pacific
10 Conference play, the Stanford
softball program tripled its previ
ous number of Pac-10 wins last
weekend with a pair of 1-0 victories
over Oregon State and a 2-1 win
over Oregon. The Cardinal (13-9
overall, 3-5 in the Pac-10) has now
won seven out of its last eight
games to turn around a season that
started 6-8.
Sharp defense and near-perfect
pitching have proven to be the
remedy for the Cardinal, and both
played key roles in Stanford's wins
over the Oregon schools. In Sun
day's doubleheader against OSU,
Stanford freshman Becky Blevins
and sophomore Jessica Schulman
pitched the first and second games,
respectively, allowing just three
hits in both games combined.
"Our pitchers are throwing re
ally well," said head coach Sandy
Pearce. "The players are coming
together, and we're so happy [with
the wins]."
Blevins pitched the first game,
giving up just one hit and one walk
while striking out six, and was per
fect through the first three in
nings.
In the bottom of the third, Stan
ford freshman Jennie Foyle took
advantage of two Beaver errors to
reach third base. With two outs
and nobody on, Foyle reached first
on a mishandled grounder, then
advanced to third after OSU catch
er Kim Herman made a wild throw
trying to catch Foyle stealing sec
ond. Junior Summer Lee then
ripped a single to right to score
Foyle. That run proved to be the
only one of the game as Oregon
State pitcher Amy Warner retired
the next 10 Cardinal batters.
Stanford's lack of offense made
for nail-biting games (each game
was won by just one run) and put
the pressure on the Cardinal pitch
ing and defense.
Blevins suffered Stanford's
only loss of the weekend in Satur
day's first game against Oregon in
which she allowed just one hit. De
spite excellent pitching by Blevins,
the game was lost on a Cardinal
error that allowed an Oregon run
early in the game.

Though Stanford's error proved
to be the difference in that game, it
served as a wake-up call to the Car
dinal defense, which was near-per
fect for the remainder of the week
end.
"Defense used to be our neme-

our nemesis. Now it's

sis," Pearce said. "Now it's our
strength. Mentally, you can see the
focus [of the players]."
"Focused" aptly describes Stan
ford's pitching this weekend.
Schulman, who pitched the 2-1 vic
tory against the Ducks on Satur

day, led the charge in Sunday's
nightcap against the Beavers.
Schulman allowed the first batter
to reach base in each of the first
three innings, but each time the
Cardinal defense turned down the
next three batters. Schulman
ended the game by retiring 15
straight OSU batters and noted
that the early hits forced her to
focus on each new batter.
"After the first few innings, my
goal was to keep at least the first bat
ter off base," Schulman said. "I
knew if we could keep runners off
base, we could keep them from
building any offensive momentum."
Unlike the Beavers, Stanford
had no difficulty getting on base,
but had serious problems scoring
runs once they did get on. The Car
dinal put at least one runner on
base in every inning but did not
score until the bottom of the sev
enth. In sLx of the seven innings,
Stanford's leadoff hitter got on
base, but the Cardinal could not
produce any runs.
Freshman Marcy Crouch led off

the Stanford rally in the seventh
with a single. Junior Amanda
Renteria followed by laying down a
soft bunt. Renteria's speed helped
her beat out the throw to first,
while Crouch advanced to third.
Foyle then came to the plate for the
Cardinal and ripped an RBI single
to right-center to end the game.
Tomorrow the Cardinal is off to
sunny Hawaii, where the women
will compete in a six-team tourna
ment against teams including New
Mexico State and Tennessee-Chat
tanooga. Pearce expects her team
to win the tournament and sees it
as a good warm-up for Stanford's
March 26 game against nationally
ranked Washington. The Cardinal
will also travel to Cal State-Fuller
ton and San Diego State over the
break, but Washington is shaping
up as the Cardinal's biggest game.
"Washington is really impres
sive," Pearce said. "It's a huge
challenge. As long as we keep our
team focus, — pitching and de
fense — going, we'll be right
there."
