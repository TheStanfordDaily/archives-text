Answer: Miyake, the 11-year-old Stanford
favorite that recently moved from its cramped
quarters at 261 University Avenue to its spa
cious new locale at 140 University Avenue, on
the corner of High Street.
This PaJo Alto sushi institution figured out
years ago that a restaurant cannot be all things
to all people. Miyake's decision was unequivo
cal; to cast its lot with the young, boisterous,
economy-minded crowd, and to leave the
business lunch clientele to Mac Arthur Park
and company. Hie new Miyake certainly hasn't
abandoned its original ethos, but the spacious,
post-modern interior pushes it a half-step
closer to being the establishment restaurant
the old Miyake never was and never could be.
Those who have yet to visit Miyake are in for
a surprise. For starters, Miyake doesn't take
reservations. During the week this usually is not
much of a problem. Last Tuesday we had to wait

between 10 and 15 minutes to be seated for din
ner. But on weekends the wait easily surpasses
an hour during peak periods. This is remarkable
considering that the new location has 125 seats,
compared with the old restaurant s 50.
Once you have actually gotten in through
the door, the first thing to grab your attention
is the music It's loud. The kind of loud that
keeps you from hearing the other people at
your table. And it's dance music, with an occa
sional Japanese pop band thrown in for good
measure. On our first visit, wc saw more than
one group walk into the restaurant, look at
each other, and walk out. One should definite
ly know what lies in store at Miyake before de
ciding to dine there.
The music goes well with the flashing strobe
lights and multi-colored disco light on the ceil
ing. It should come as no surprise that the lights
periodically dim and the dining room fills with
fog created by Miyake's own fog machine. This
is not the atmosphere for quiet romantic din
ners. But it works perfectly for rowdy birthday
celebrations (of which there were three during
our dinner) and occasions that involve stand
ing on a chair and drinking shots of sake to the
cheers of assembled waiters and patrons.
Miyake's new decor stands in marked con
trast to its earlier setting. Where the old restau
rant operated in a shoe-box sized space, the
new Miyake occupies an airy corner building
ringed with windows. Its curved dropped ceil
ing is punctuated with elaborate Corinthian
columns. The sushi bar runs along the far right
wall, illuminated by a series of dangling mo
bile-like chandeliers holding exposed light
bulbs that reflect off the mirrors behind the bar
and the shiny faux brass ceiling.

Because of the general commotion and fre
netic pace at Miyake, don't expect an unhurried
waiter to spend a few minutes walking you
through the menu, suggesting dishes to meet
your tastes. Besides, even if he did, you proba
bly wouldn't hear him. If you aren't familiar
with Japanese cuisine, and aren't feeling adven
turous, I recommend taking someone with you
who knows their way around a Japanese menu.
Despite Miyake's lengthy dinner entree and
lunch combination menus, sushi is what made
Miyake famous. The sushi menu, available
during lunch and dinner, boasts a whopping
153 items. The biggest seller is the California
roll — crab, avocado and cucumber rolled in
rice, wrapped in seaweed and rolled again in
rice. The crab is real and cooked, and together
with the avocado and cucumber, it is a deli
cious combination of tastes and textures. Un
fortunately, nearly every plate that I saw had
unraveled or broken rolls with crab and avoca
do spilling out the side. If you are looking for
artistically-arranged, every-piece-is-a-master
piece sushi, then you might want to try else
where.
The shiitake roll (black mushroom) had a
surprisingly sweet taste, while the ume shiso
roll was a delightful combination of aromatic
mint and slightly bitter plum. Ebi nigiri is
cooked prawn on a hand-formed rice cake
with a dab of wasabi. Although I enjoyed it, if I
were paying more than $1.70,1 would expect
higher-quality ingredients than the thin, flat
prawn that came atop the rice cake. The natto
roll is a flavorful fermented soy bean with kick
If you sit at the sushi bar, as we did one Sat
urday afternoon, you can select your sushi
from little wooden boats that float by in the

narrow oval pool that rings the bar. The sushi
chefs keep the boats well-stocked with the
most popular varieties of sushi, particularly
sashimi (sushi made with thinly-sliced raw
fish). We tried meguro sashimi (tuna) and
hamachi sashimi (yellow tail), and found both
of them to be adequate. If you want a sushi that
isn't stocked on one of the boats, however, it
may be a battle trying to get it from one of the
sushi chefs behind the counter.
Miyake offers an economical and satisfying
lunch menu that includes 19 specials with rice,
miso soup and salad for $3.95, as well as 15 dif
ferent obento boxed lunches for $5.25. And for
dinner patrons who don't find raw fish, rice
and seaweed appetizing, there are numerous <1
la carte and dinner combinations that include
traditional Japanese favorites such as teriyaki,
tempura, yakimono and cutlets.
Miyake is not for everyone. Diners looking
for tranquillity should flee this restaurant. Self
professed sushi connoisseurs turn their noses
up at the mention of it. But economy-minded,
noise-tolerant, fun-loving sushi patrons flock
to it in droves. Meanwhile the quiet, upscale
sushi restaurants do one-half the business
Miyake does. It's your choice.

Answer: Miyake, the 11-year-old Stanford
favorite that recently moved from its cramped
quarters at 261 University Avenue to its spa
cious new locale at 140 University Avenue, on
the corner of High Street.
This PaJo Alto sushi institution figured out
years ago that a restaurant cannot be all things
to all people. Miyake's decision was unequivo
cal; to cast its lot with the young, boisterous,
economy-minded crowd, and to leave the
business lunch clientele to Mac Arthur Park
and company. Hie new Miyake certainly hasn't
abandoned its original ethos, but the spacious,
post-modern interior pushes it a half-step
closer to being the establishment restaurant
the old Miyake never was and never could be.
Those who have yet to visit Miyake are in for
a surprise. For starters, Miyake doesn't take
reservations. During the week this usually is not
much of a problem. Last Tuesday we had to wait

between 10 and 15 minutes to be seated for din
ner. But on weekends the wait easily surpasses
an hour during peak periods. This is remarkable
considering that the new location has 125 seats,
compared with the old restaurant s 50.
Once you have actually gotten in through
the door, the first thing to grab your attention
is the music It's loud. The kind of loud that
keeps you from hearing the other people at
your table. And it's dance music, with an occa
sional Japanese pop band thrown in for good
measure. On our first visit, wc saw more than
one group walk into the restaurant, look at
each other, and walk out. One should definite
ly know what lies in store at Miyake before de
ciding to dine there.
The music goes well with the flashing strobe
lights and multi-colored disco light on the ceil
ing. It should come as no surprise that the lights
periodically dim and the dining room fills with
fog created by Miyake's own fog machine. This
is not the atmosphere for quiet romantic din
ners. But it works perfectly for rowdy birthday
celebrations (of which there were three during
our dinner) and occasions that involve stand
ing on a chair and drinking shots of sake to the
cheers of assembled waiters and patrons.
Miyake's new decor stands in marked con
trast to its earlier setting. Where the old restau
rant operated in a shoe-box sized space, the
new Miyake occupies an airy corner building
ringed with windows. Its curved dropped ceil
ing is punctuated with elaborate Corinthian
columns. The sushi bar runs along the far right
wall, illuminated by a series of dangling mo
bile-like chandeliers holding exposed light
bulbs that reflect off the mirrors behind the bar
and the shiny faux brass ceiling.

Because of the general commotion and fre
netic pace at Miyake, don't expect an unhurried
waiter to spend a few minutes walking you
through the menu, suggesting dishes to meet
your tastes. Besides, even if he did, you proba
bly wouldn't hear him. If you aren't familiar
with Japanese cuisine, and aren't feeling adven
turous, I recommend taking someone with you
who knows their way around a Japanese menu.
Despite Miyake's lengthy dinner entree and
lunch combination menus, sushi is what made
Miyake famous. The sushi menu, available
during lunch and dinner, boasts a whopping
153 items. The biggest seller is the California
roll — crab, avocado and cucumber rolled in
rice, wrapped in seaweed and rolled again in
rice. The crab is real and cooked, and together
with the avocado and cucumber, it is a deli
cious combination of tastes and textures. Un
fortunately, nearly every plate that I saw had
unraveled or broken rolls with crab and avoca
do spilling out the side. If you are looking for
artistically-arranged, every-piece-is-a-master
piece sushi, then you might want to try else
where.
The shiitake roll (black mushroom) had a
surprisingly sweet taste, while the ume shiso
roll was a delightful combination of aromatic
mint and slightly bitter plum. Ebi nigiri is
cooked prawn on a hand-formed rice cake
with a dab of wasabi. Although I enjoyed it, if I
were paying more than $1.70,1 would expect
higher-quality ingredients than the thin, flat
prawn that came atop the rice cake. The natto
roll is a flavorful fermented soy bean with kick
If you sit at the sushi bar, as we did one Sat
urday afternoon, you can select your sushi
from little wooden boats that float by in the

narrow oval pool that rings the bar. The sushi
chefs keep the boats well-stocked with the
most popular varieties of sushi, particularly
sashimi (sushi made with thinly-sliced raw
fish). We tried meguro sashimi (tuna) and
hamachi sashimi (yellow tail), and found both
of them to be adequate. If you want a sushi that
isn't stocked on one of the boats, however, it
may be a battle trying to get it from one of the
sushi chefs behind the counter.
Miyake offers an economical and satisfying
lunch menu that includes 19 specials with rice,
miso soup and salad for $3.95, as well as 15 dif
ferent obento boxed lunches for $5.25. And for
dinner patrons who don't find raw fish, rice
and seaweed appetizing, there are numerous <1
la carte and dinner combinations that include
traditional Japanese favorites such as teriyaki,
tempura, yakimono and cutlets.
Miyake is not for everyone. Diners looking
for tranquillity should flee this restaurant. Self
professed sushi connoisseurs turn their noses
up at the mention of it. But economy-minded,
noise-tolerant, fun-loving sushi patrons flock
to it in droves. Meanwhile the quiet, upscale
sushi restaurants do one-half the business
Miyake does. It's your choice.
