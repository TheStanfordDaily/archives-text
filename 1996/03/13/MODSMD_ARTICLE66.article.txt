# LOVE AND ROCKETS GET A SECOND CHANCE?
## 
### Story by Craig Garrett Graphic by Travis Vigil 
Remember those kids in junior high
who dressed all in black? Man they
were cool, because angst is cool, and
wearing black nail polish and a sullen look is
cooler than being on the cheer leading squad.
In fact, you might have been one of those
glum souls yourself. If so, you've probably
moved on since then and now wear colors a
few shades brighter than those inky threads
you wore back then. You may even wear
shorts occasionally. And probably all you
have left now to remind you of those angst
filled days of yore is a closet full of Cure
posters at home, a couple of Smiths t-shirts
and maybe an old Love and Rockets tape.
Yes, Love and Rockets. They were arch
modern-rockers before everybody was. In
those days, their appeal lay at least partially in
their image: British, literary, Romantic, ob
scure; this image and all its associations fit
neatly under the label "gothic." Early fans of
the movement were the real progenitors of
this image, cloaking themselves in extrava
gant, antiquated costumes and displaying an
unhealthy interest in gargoyles. Soon, how
ever, this descriptive label became integral to
certain bands' images and sound.

Probably the most perfectly gothic band
of the period was Bauhaus. If you were
a real goth you had at least one
Bauhaus t-shirt (black, of course). Unfortu
nately, Bauhaus was, as one band member re
portedly said, "too intense" to last, and the
band broke up in the early '80s. Lead singer
Peter Murphy went on to a pursue a solo ca
reer, while two of the remaining three mem-

bers — guitarist Daniel Ash
and drummer Kevin Haskins
— formed lones on Tails. In
1984 the other member of
Bauhaus — bassist David J
Haskins (Kevin's brother) —
rejoined the other two, and
the three became Love and
Rockets.
Over the course of the next
four albums, Love and Rock
ets enjoyed steadily climbing
fame, culminating with their
hit single "So Alive" in 1988.
That year the band toured ex
tensively with modern rock
giants the Cure and the Pixie*.
The rigors of touring and
newfound mainstream suc
cess took its toll, however, and
Love and Rockets went on a
four-year hiatus. Once they
returned to the studio in 1994,
the band tried to head in a
new direction with the album
"Hot Trip to Heaven." This
record didn't sell well, though,
maybe because the band's
solid fan-base had since
grown out of its goth phase.
So where does a band go

when it has lost its niche in the rock world,
when its fans forget about it, when it is what
some people would call "washed-up?"
The Edge in Palo Alto.

Love and
Rockets are
burrent-

ly on tour
to pro-

mote

their
forth-

coming ~
album,

"Sweet F / A" (the
title is an English collo-

quialism — "sweet fuck all"

— which means, literally, "nothing"), and they
will be playing The Edge on March 17. Over
the past few years the band has been exploring
new territory and took a whole new approach

to recording the last album, "Hot Trip to Heav
en," according to drummer Kevin Haskins.
"We decided not to do any preparation for
that album at all," he explains. u We booked

a studio m England and we just

showed up the first day
k. and said 'Hi, how are

you doing?' I just
k cot some sort

of drum
l loop or

sampled
l loop

y going.
then we

f)u s t
worked,

r huilt up from
there. It was com-

pletely spontaneous.
"We decided iust

to be as free as we could and just

work, using the intellect, more of the sub
conscious, letting things flow out. And we
were very happy with the album." The sound
on "Hot Trip to Heaven" is more ambient-in

fluenced, relying heavily on effects and syn
thesizers.
"We were listening to bands like the Orb
and Underworld around that time," Haskins
says. These influences lent the music an at
mospheric, unstructured mood (a friend of
mine listened to the CD while getting her
wisdom teeth pulled, in hopes that its mind
altcring effects might help her forget what
was going on in her mouth).
For the forthcoming album "Sweet F / A,"
however, Love and Rockets have left the waves
of ambient noise behind. This new album
bears the marks of producer Rick Rubin
who has worked with such bands as the Red
Hot Chili Peppers, L.L Cool 1 and the Beastie
Boys — and who lent love and Rockets the
use of the same Los Angeles house / studio
where the Chili Peppers recorded "Blood
Sugar Sex Magik."
According to Haskins, Rubin "gave advice
from .1 distance. Without actually getting into
the studio with the band, he gave them a di
rection. "| Rubin took] what was then a fin
ished mix that we did in England and spent a
weekend withe at us being present... remix
ing it."says Haskins. "He sent it to us and said,
'Well this is the way I would approach all the
mixing.' In effect he just dried up everything,
took all the effects off, all the reverb, which we
had been big on using in the past," giving the
music a "more contemporary, American'*
sound.
It is appropriate that this album should
have a more American sound since the band
has been operating out of Los Angeles for the
past couple of years. Gone are any traces of the
gothic (is there a band that is farther from goth
than the Red Hot Chili Peppers?). "We feel it's
the best piece of work we've come out with''

Haskins says, "hut [the last couple
of albums] are in such different
areas, anyway."

Will anybody give this
album a chance? That
question has yet to be
answered. Outside of a few fans
who have stuck with Love and
Rockets since the early days, most
people may be too busy trying to
keep on the cutting edge by buying
the new Silverchair album instead.
Quite possibly those people will
remember the Bauhaus t-shirl,
those Cure posters, and write off
their goth phase the same way oth
ers deny ever liking Bon lovi or
getting that perm in eighth grade.
This development would not bode
welJ for Love and Rockets, but with
the fickle American audience these
days, anything is possible... even
at The Edge.
