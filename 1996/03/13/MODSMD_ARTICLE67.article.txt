# how far will you go for art?
## the
						oregon shakespeare festival makes 760 miles worth the trip. 
### story by gabriela teodorescu graphic by jason wishnow 
We woke up very, very early. We drove
through Berkeley, rain and Mt. Shasta
National Forest. We ruined our hacks by
sitting in a car for six hours, one way. And we even
endured the fruit check at the California-Oregon
border.
All for the arts. More specifically, all for two
performances at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.
And, almost to our surprise (and certainly to
our relief), it was absolutely worth it.
The Oregon Shakespeare Festival is one of the
best and largest professional theater companies in
the United States. Whether or not you've heard of
them, the fact that they run eleven plays for eight
months every year in obscure little Ashland, Ore
gon and last year still managed to have 91 -percent
theater capacity should convince you that they are
better than good. They're damn good.

Admittedly, the real reason my best friend and
I embarked upon this arduous journey was to see
one of the best scripts of the century performed.
Tom Stoppard's "Arcadia" defies, thankfully, any
sort of quick summary or short profile. It is a play
of metaphysics — using art and science master
fully, interweaving Lord Byron with Isaac Newton
and allowing the Second Law of Thermodynam
ics and iterated algorithms to explain the meaning
of life. Or at least one of the meanings of life.
In a scene somewhat relevant to life at this
renowned university, Hannah larvis and Valen
tine Coverly are discussing the comparative value
of their different research pursuits, after a literary
critic has dismissed all of Valentine's science as
trivial when compared to poetry. Hannah re
sponds:

top-notch fashion. Especially riveting perfor
mances were given by Andrew Borba (Septimus
Hodge), Carole Healey (Hannah Jarvis) and
Richard Howard (Bernard Nightingale). Fault
could rarely be found in the directing, the play
being brought to life by Stephen Hollis. If you do
see one play at the festival, it should be this one.
The trip was actually worth just "Arcadia," but
if you're here, you might as well take in another of
the many offerings.

Okay, okay. By now you're probably wondering
why we didn't see a Shakespeare play at a so enti
tled festival. Well, the truth is, the company does
seven contemporary plays and four of the Bard's.
Unfortunately, time just didn't permit us to see
one of those rhymed English pieces. 1 lowever, the
four being directed this year promise to be excel
lent. The Shakespeare season began with "The
Winter's Tale," directed by Fontaine Syer. The
piece includes a bear on stage (don't try that at
home) and other favorite scenes in this extreme
tale of jealousy set in the kingdom of Sicily.
That perennial romance, "Romeo and Juliet,"
also graces the stage this season. It is directed by
Rene Buch. The plot most likely needs no rehash
ing, but it is a sure bet that the festival's rendition
will bring out the best in this Shakespeare favorite.
"Love's Labor's Lost" exhibits the folly of men
in love — and with brilliant dialogue and witty
scenes, manages to make lovers of fools and fools
of lovers. If you're in Ashland without a significant
other and wish to laugh at either of the genders,
Shakespeare's got the dialogue to make swear off
romance for at least three years. The play is direct
ed by Fat Patton.
The final Shakespeare is one of his lesser
known, "Coriolanus." The play examines Rome in
494 B.C.F. It is a military story of battle, pride,
envy and power, somewhat reminiscent of "Julius
Caesar," in plot only. Tony Taccone directs this
tragic history of battles, betrayal and blood.

The contemporary plays of the season are a
varied but acclaimed bunch. Rita Doves' "The
Darker Face of the Earth" is a tale about South
erners and slaves set in South Carolina circa 1840.
Directed by Ricardo Khan and written by a
Pulitzer Prize winner in poetry, the play uses a
loose form of "Oedipus Rex" and transports it to
an ante-bellum plantation.

"It'sall trivial.. .Com
paring what we're looking
for misses the point. It's
wanting to know that
makes us matter. Oth
erwise we're going
out the way we
came in."
k Suffice it to
say, not only is the
play brilliant, hut
the festival's rendi
tion of it was clearly
stunning. The actors
played their roles in

Drury Pifer wrote "Strindberg in Hollywood"
about one of Sweden's greatest writers, Johan Au
gust Strindberg. It is a fictional account of the
possible situation of Strindberg in the city of film,
directed by Pat Patton. The writer justifies the play
thus: "Strindberg never went to Hollywood and
Hollywood couldn't care less about the Swedish
playwright. Strindberg, the man, was impossible.
Hollywood, by any standard, is intolerable. But
neither can be ignored. It seemed a good reason to
get them together." Judging by that statement, the
piece must at least have good humor.
One of the most interesting plays at the festival
is "Cabaret Verboten." Written by Jeremy
Lawrence and directed by Penny Metropulos, the
musical piecc exhibits art in Weimar Germany. It
looks at the cabaret form as one of the many forms
censored by Hitler during his dictatorship. Using
some famous musical pieces and displaying dance
and cabaret routines, it seems a glitzy and enter
taining production.
"A Pair of Threes: Three Viewings (by Jeffrey
Hatcher) and Three Hotels (by Jon Robin Bait/.)"
produces two unrelated plays in one show. The
first piecc is about undertakers and funerals, di
rected by Fontaine Syer and the second piece, di
rected by Michael J. Hume, examines the life of a
young boy as he lives in different hotels because of
his father's traveling job.
Finally, the festival produces "Awake and
Sing!," one of the first of Clifford Odets' plays. It
premiered during Odets' highly successful 1935
year. In Ashland, the play is directed by Debra
Wicks. It puts on stage the difficulties of a Jewish
family of working class status which aspires to
middle-classdom. The play concentrates on the
dreams and hopes of second-generation lewish
immigrants.

The other play we attended combined two of
Moliere's one-acts with the autobiography of his
life. "Translated and contrived" by Nagle Jackson,
it is an entertaining tale about Moliere's debut be
fore King Louis XIV. Within the play are full per
formances of "The Love Doctor" and"The Forced
Marriage" (also known as "The Husband in Spite
of Himself"). James Edmondson directed the
piece. However, the play excels mainly in its comic
moments and has some stumbling blocks during
more serious parts. The lead, played by Ray
Porter, failed to go beyond slapstick in the less

comedic scenes. As my companion said, while it
was wholly entertaining, the piece worked best in
the tangential scenes and usually with the tangen
tial actors. For example, both the scene with the
doctors in the first one-act and the scene with the
philosophers in the second one had us in stitches.
Nevertheless, despite the small negatives, the play
succeeded in its comedic turns, and since Moliere is
not famous for his subtlety, the overall effect was
positive.
.\shl.\nC> Atmosphepe
Ashland itself is worth visiting, after all, you
can't stay in the theaters all the time. For walking, a
wonderful little park just behind the Angus
Bowmer Theater intrigues visitors. It has a random
statue of Abraham Lincoln, but aside from that it's
green and lush with creeks and fountains fortu
itously placed. People in southern Oregon are in
teresting. Kind of cool. Sometimes strange. In this
one park, there was at least one person doing tai chi
in the middle of a grassy knoll, rollerbladers with
hair that hadn't been washed for weeks abounded
and families with children dressed in Elizabethan
clothing were feeding the ducks at the pond. 1 bis, I
may add, was a typical Saturday afternoon.
The best places to visit in Ashland are actually
the bookstores and the artsy shops. The ludor
Guild Gift Shop across from Bowmer theater is a
must-see. The store offers t-shirts with Shake
spearean insults on them ("You speak a great deal
of nothing"), lots of Shakespeare "memorabilia
and unique, hard-to-find knick-knacks. Most of
the bookstores along East Main (Ashland's "strip )
have either great new books and coffee houses or
rare and used books where you might even find a
first edition of Allen Ginsberg's "Howl." Fhe best
place for new books seemed like Bloomsbury
Books, but my absolute favorite bookstore is
Shakespeare and Company — it has great rare,
used and first edition hard covers and the prices are
reasonable.
Aside from bookstores, cute boutiques share
their facades with Native American craft stores and
knit-and-quilt shops. And a theater with an old
neon sign disrupts the continuity of the high cul
ture ambiance. Nonetheless, Ashland's little quirks
lead both to introspection and high amusement,
elements which are sometimes lacking at our am
bitious, grade-driven Stanford tower.
As for lodging, The Stratford Inn is a good lit
tle hotel with very reasonable prices, and perks ol

a whirlpool and an indoor pool
(which was heaven to our bodies
upon arrival). It also offers free
bagels and coffee in the morning j
and a nice 1 5- to 20-minute walk j

to the theaters. Other places
catering to different tastes cer
tainly do exist, though, and you
should find out about them
before booking a reservation
— there's even a youth hos- i

Tel for those with small pock
etbooks.
To satisfy your palate after
a long day at the theaters,
Ashland seemed to have j
lots of good restaurants.

The one we would recommend at all costs (and it
is a little pricey, but well worth it) is the Plaza
Cafe. While their specials change daily, that
weekend we tasted the most incredible Char
broiled Garlic Salmon with Fresh Basil Pesto
I.inguini as well as the Grilled Pork Tenderloin
with Shiitake Sherry Sauce. The desserts, too,
were tip-top — I recommend the Creme Brulee
and the Lemon Tart. Our waitress, Lisa, also of
fered us wonderful service and was very knowl
edgeable about the menu.
For imbibing the nectar of the gods, the town
also advertises at least three or four wineries, so if
you have the time and plan on walking, not driving,
go wine tasting, too.

Needless to say, the one clincher of sacrificing
yourself for art is that you must amuse yourself
for those six hours in the car. We found that lis
tening to the radio stations was more amusement
sometimes than we could take. One radio station
somewhere along the 505 proudly pronounced,
"The best hits without the hard rock and rap." It
seemed extremely funny after a few hours in the
same sitting position. Also, the radio stations had
some unique advertising. 1 he ad lor some Mexi
can restaurant named Jim Boys (does that sound
like a Mexican place?) featured this poor guy who
spent his whole life talking about the food there.
(Must have been a CS grad with a penchant for
Mexican food.) This ad was supposed to attract
people to dine there. Scary. Also, we didn't have
the time, but anyone who passes by Chico should
most certainly stop at the Oy Vey (we're not kid-

ding
you here) Cafe.

It is, according to
their publicity, the

eatery in trendy i
Chico. And on your
wav back from Ash-

rvaj uavi\ iiuin iioir
land, stopping in Yreka
(yes, Yreka, not Eureka)
for the Denny's $1.99
breakfast menu is not a
bad idea. You can use
their bathrooms, too.
And keep in mind:
the drive is for art's sake.
