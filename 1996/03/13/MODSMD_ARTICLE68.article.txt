## SKINNY PUPPY The 						Process 
### 
While some bands, like Nine Inch Nails,
may play at pathos and terror. Skinny Puppy
actually WF.RH a scary, scary band. Although
their 12 years of existence produced 10 al
bums of some of the creepiest and most in
fluential industrial music in existence, Skin
nv Puppy's musical reputation was equaled
and probably exceeded by the dark rumors
that always seemed to surround them. Over
the years, the band supposedly broke up at
least four or live times, and each band mem
ber was reported dead at least once, always
from some particularly unpleasant form ol
drug addiction or suicide.
Well, this time the rumors are true. Key
boardist Dwayne Gocttel is dead from a
heroin overdose which may or may not have
been intentional, and surviving members
Ogre Nivek and cEvin Key refuse to be in the
same room with each other. "The Process" is
Skinny Puppy's final album. Although the
record's two-year creation was a long and
grueling — er — process that ultimately
caused the band's destruction, the result is a
fine tribute to the memory of one of indus
trial music's most important — and most
dysfunctional — bands.
When compared to Skinny Puppy's earli

er releases, "The Process" is surprisingly
melodic and subdued, favoring trance key
boards and complex synthesizer arrange
ments rather than the overpowering guitars
and brutal drum-lines that usually typify in
dustrial music. Quiet techno-ballads like
"Cult" and "Candle" seamlessly blend gentle,
dirge-like strings and pianos with bursts of
metal guitars and bizarre samples to create a
sound that is eerie but not discordant. Ogre's
vocals add to the sense of unease, encom
passing distorted, multitracked whispers and
odd, off-key singing as well as more typically
industrial shouting.
"The Process" has its flaws, of course —
Ogre occasionally seems to be trying too
hard to be "creepy," and I have a hard time
understanding why he feels the need to
sound British when he's from ( anada. Over
all, however, the album comes together well
— a fine tribute to a talented but flawed
band.
