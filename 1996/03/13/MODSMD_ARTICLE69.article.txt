# NICK CAVE AND THE BAD SEEDS
## Murder Ballads 
### 
Depending on how many people you esti
mate were in that Bella Vista slum that
burned down, and on whether or not von

count Biko, the mysteriously crucified terri
er, there are approximately 96 acts of murder
on Nick Cave's collection of "Murder Bal
lads." With the exception of the sarcastically
optimistic cover of Dylan's "Death Is Not the
End," each song centers around killing peo
ple, out of passion or just for fun, with lyrics
like "They found Mary Bellows cuffed to the
bed / With a rag in her mouth and a bullet in
her head / Oh poor Mary Bellows."
Yet if anyone could get away with such
bloody monotony, it's Nick Cave and the Bad
Seeds. Since his early work with the Birthday
Party, Cave has established himself as one of
rock music's most engagingly twisted artists,
the mastermind behind the most unstable
masterpieces of the last 20 years. Indeed, it's
likely that if there were no Nick Cave, the
Jesus Lizard would not exist the way it does
today.
But while the Cave of old was truly upset
ting, the new Cave is just kind of creepy. The
Bad Seeds' music is cleaner and toned down,
and Cave himself has shifted from actual
murderous freak to teller of stories about
murderous freaks. "Murder Ballads" may be
Cave's most violent album based on sheer
number of deaths, but it's also one of his
most tranquil. The songs are consistently lis
tenableand often pretty, with Cave himself a
safe distance from the deeds he describes.
In "Stagger Lee," Cave acts as the unin
volved narrator, reading off dialogue be
tween the title character and his victims,
while in"The Curse of Millhaven," he as
sumes the character of Lottie, a 14-year-old,
blonde-haired girl who kills townsfolk be
cause "foul play can really get a small town
going." On other occasions, Cave enlists
friends to sing the parts of other characters.
1M Harvey, Shane MacGowan and Kyiie
Minogue all turn in respectable guest perfor
mances.
Unfortunately, though, Cave's role as
Leonard Cohen-influenced storyteller is not
nearly as interesting as his old persona of
Leonard Cohen-influenced psychopath, and
Cave's obsessions are beginning to grow stale.
"Murder Ballads" is a thoroughly well-craft
ed work, but it ultimately lacks the creative
edginess that a work this gruesome demands.
