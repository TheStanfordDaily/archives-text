# Few changes seen in fall grades
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Preliminary numbers on grade
distribution for fall quarter re
vealed few changes from fall quar
ter 1994.
The data — released to The
Daily yesterday — showed a small
drop in the number of A's, B's and
C's and a slight increase in the
number of D's awarded last quar
ter compared to a year ago. Two
hundred ninety-four "NP's" — or
"not passed" — were given out.
The new grading policy, passed
in the spring of 1994, records an
"NP" when a student fails a class.
Under the changes, students must
add classes by the third week of the
quarter and drop them by the
fourth week if they do not want
them to appear on their transcript.
Classes dropped between the fifth
and eighth weeks show up on tran
scripts as a "W" for "withdrew."
Phvsics Prof. Mason Yearian,

chair of the senate's Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment, said when the approximate
ly 1,000 incomplete and not-yet
reported grades are turned in, the
small drop in A's and B's may dis
appear.
"The students who take incom
pletes are generally trying to do
well and are conscientious," said
Yearian. "Those minus signs may
convert to positive."
The number of A's awarded to
students dropped from 6,036 in
fall '94 to 5,861 in fall '95, or a
change of -0.19 percent. B's
dropped from 3,834 to 3,562, a
change of -0.67 percent. The num
ber of C's decreased slightly from
901 to 890, and D's increased from
138 in fall '94 to 218 last quarter.
The new data only includes
grades from courses numbered
below 200, thus highlighting the
policy's effect on undergraduates.
"We don't really see any trends
yet," said Yearian. "Thesechanges

in the grading policy were not in
tended to attack grade inflation."
"One of the main reasons (for
the policy) was to produce a histor
ical academic record," said Geolo
gy Prof. Gail Mahood, who chaired
C-AAA when the policy was pro
posed. "The other was to make
sure students and faculty commit
ted to their classes early and main
tained the commitment."
University Registrar Roger
Printup said the data proves that
outside predictions for grade de
flation proved wrong. "People
thought that somehow tightening
add and drop dates would have an
impact on grades — it just hasn't,"
said Printup.
Mahood said the shift from a
"record of achievement" to a "his
torical record" is a national one.
"There are a lot of places that are
talking about what it was we did,"
said Mahood. "Most schools have
already stricter policies than we do.
"We are seeing a shift toward

people being more concerned and
showing more commitment to
core academic work," Mahood
said. "I think it is part of a general
social trend — people are getting
more concerned about jobs and
their futures aren't as secure."
Yearian said while trends in the
new policy may not be obvious
now, C-AAA plans to "do an ex
haustive survey during the sum
mer of the whole year's grades."
Yearian said by then the com
mittee will have fewer grades left
as incompletes or not-yet-reported
grades.
"Because this is only the first
quarter, these numbers are bound
to have some glitches," said Yeari
an.
Yearian also said he expected
the number of "W's" to decrease
over the next two quarters. "Peo
ple will be more aware of the new
policy, of the new dates." Ninety
five "W's" were given out last
quarter.
