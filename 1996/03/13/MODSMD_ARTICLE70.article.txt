# ADAM SANDLER
## What The Hell Happened To Me? 
### 
I love Adam Sandler. He was a genius on
Saturday Night Live. His first album is defi
nitely a comedy classic. "Billy Madison" had
me rolling on the floor. So I guess you could
say that I had high expectations from his sec
ond album, "What The Hell Happened To
Me?" Perhaps they were too high.
Not that the album isn't funny. There are
some skits on the album that had me laugh
ing out loud. But 1 have to admit that there
were other skits that left me disappointed.
If you don't already know, Sandler can be
very obscene (much more so than his SNL
character saying "constipa-TION ... mas
turba-TION). But it is his obscene and off
color humor that makes him so funny.
Things like a mom asking her children to

Classic

Almost, but...
Lacking
