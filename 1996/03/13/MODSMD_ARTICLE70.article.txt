# ADAM SANDLER
## What The Hell Happened To Me? 
### 
I love Adam Sandler. He was a genius on
Saturday Night Live. His first album is defi
nitely a comedy classic. "Billy Madison" had
me rolling on the floor. So I guess you could
say that I had high expectations from his sec
ond album, "What The Hell Happened To
Me?" Perhaps they were too high.
Not that the album isn't funny. There are
some skits on the album that had me laugh
ing out loud. But 1 have to admit that there
were other skits that left me disappointed.
If you don't already know, Sandler can be
very obscene (much more so than his SNL
character saying "constipa-TION ... mas
turba-TION). But it is his obscene and off
color humor that makes him so funny.

masturbate while they arc swimming, or a
farting hypnotist, or four guys reminiscing
about how they all had sexual encounters
with 60-year-old men. Most people sound
dumb when they swear every other word, but
the way Sandler does it, every time he lets a
four-letter word slip, 1 find myself smiling.
The album starts off slow. The first few
skits are like those on SNL, but they go about
five minutes too long. The fourth track intro
duces Sandler's recurring character of the
album, the Excited Southerner. Unfortunate
ly, this character doesn't quite live up to last
album's "Beatings of a ..or "The Buffoon."
All in all, I'd say the skits are average: some
are really funny, others are just plain bombs.
But then comes "The Chanukah Song."
This song has classic Sandler written all over
it. It's just Sandler playing the guitar and
singing about famous Jewish people ("We
got Ann Landers and her sister Dear
Abby / Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish
not too shabby"). Another classic song on the
album is "Dip Doodle," a song filled with gib
berish dedicated to grandmas ("You gotta
libby, you gotta labbv / You gotta hug grand
ma, even though she's flabby").
Other songs on the album aren't quite as
classic — instead of just Sandler and a guitar
there is an entire band behind him — but
some are still quite funny ("I'm fuckin' wast
ed / It's the best shit I ever tasted" from "Mr.
Bake-O" or "I got a piece of shit car" from
"Ode To My Car").
There are funny moments on this CD,
stuff that you would definitely want to show
to your friends. But a significantly large part
of the 75 minutes on this album you will
probably never listen to twice.

Lovelife

Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker is as much a
thinker as he is a show-off, which makes his
hand much more of a threat to Ameri-centric
modern rock than any other ofthe Britpopcrop.
Although Oasis' druggy Beatles revival wins the
popularity contest, and Blur's new-wave sneer
and catchy na-na-na's entertain, Pulp's "Differ
ent (. 'lass" one-ups those faves with impeccable
wit and an incomparable sense of drama.
For once, stereotypically British pomp
translates well across the Atlantic, where
themes of class struggle and streetwise
Anglo-existentialism intrigue rather than
repel. Though the band gets tripped up in
Cocker's Brit narcissism in some stretches,
Pulp explodes the excuse that "they're too
British" because the frontman peddles his
smarmy bombast through engrossing pop
song character sketches packed with as much
substance as glam-rock style. The opening
track, "Mis-shapes", cuts to the quick, at once
a manifesto for the British working class as
well as an allegorical anthem for British rock
ers, punctuated by Cocker's impassioned cry
of "We want your homes / we want your lives
/ we want the things you won't allow us.'
Cocker moves from one persona to the next
with convincing ease, from a voyeuristic

sleaze in "Underwear" to the boy-next-door
romantic of "Disco 2000."
"Common People" is the crowning
achievement of the current British invasion,
l unny and fren/ied, Cocker gives the listener
a tour of the bleakness of everyday life as he
toys with an upper-class twit who thinks
"poor is cool,' glaring and moping without
resorting to melodrama. The lyrics sting with
wry sarcasm and desperate sincerity, alter
nating between cheeky lines like, "I said, 'Pre
tend you got no money' / She just laughed
and said, 'You're so funny,' " and blunt ones
like, "You will never understand / how it is to
live your life / with no meaning or control."
The music matches Cocker's lead, the new
wave guitar rjffs and snazzy keyboard synco
pation getting past campy nostalgia to en
hance the energy of the piece.
In stark contrast to the vivid and concrete
narratives of "Different Class," Push's
"Lovelife" falls flat because its tales of rela
tionships gone bad never get beyond the gen
eral. About the only similarity between Lush
and its counterparts at the front of the Brit
pop pack is that Pulp's Cocker shares lead vo
cals with singer / guitarist Miki Berenyi on
"Ciao!" The name dropping backfires on
Lush, only showing up the limitations of its
pop-song craft: Cocker's unique delivery is
rendered boring by a combination of poor
verses and bored vocal patterns, but he still
manages to upstage the accented monotony
of Berenyi's voice.
With the vocals up and the guitars more
straightforward, the poppy mix of "Lovelife"
bears little resemblance to the swirling, omi
nous textures that made Lush's 1991
"Spooky" a fresh, interesting listen. The single
"Ladykillers" grates with poseur attitude, as
Berenyi's once-smooth voice turns harsh and
mangled in a feeble attempt to talk tough. The
lyrics are trite and adorned with little energy,
so canned bits like, "You think you're such a

ladykiller / But you were nothing special until
you turned out the light," sound worse than
they read. One might give Lush the benefit of
the doubt and say the band has refined its act,
it only the songs didn't emerge as Echobelly
soundalikes or Elastica without the edges.
