## BALLOON GUY The 						West Coast Shakes 
### 
Some of their songs are like "Wow!" and
others are like "Oh," hut all in all, Balloon
Guy's debut alhum "The West Coast Shakes"
is a pretty good listen.

The group has an interesting propensity
for odd song titles and lyrics. For example,
in "russell," they sing about an attempt to
lose some guy named Russell and croon
"thank God for camouflage." Later, in the
sixth track, Russell appears again as "tipsy
russell," which makes you wonder if they
ever really did get rid of Russell in the
fourth track.
However, one redeeming quality of this
album is that catchy music accompanies
the unique lyrics. In "salty language," you
don't really understand what vocalist Scott
Tretter is saying, but the music is scintillat
ing enough that your body moves to the
beat anyway. However, I would be interest
ed to find out what exactly "salty language"
is.
Their musical style shifts from song to
song. In "dapper", the sound is a very indus
trial, Nine Inch Nails-ish, sort of music.
However, in the sixth track, the group
seemed to have combined lounge music and
a children's sing-a-long with lots of guitar
work in order to come up with "tipsv rus
sell."
All of these songs are, of course, sung
with the correct amount of angst and frus
tration. But Balloon Guy temper this with a
pinch of sarcasm and humor. Kxample?
Well, just read the song titles. The third
track is named "bad taste moves quick."
There are a couple of truly beautiful bal
lads on this album (tracks 13 and 14). The
music is soft, lulling and hypnotic. Again,
you cannot understand the words, but the
melodies make up for that. After all, know
ing Balloon Guy's partiality lor strange
lyrics, you're probably better off not know
ing what the words are. The title of track 13
is "springtime in ho chi ininh city." I Imiiim.
What would any rock / alternative album
be without paranoia, and in this regard, Bal
loon Guy deliver wonderfully, "i read it all" i>
bursting with it, and it comes complete with
dark, claustrophobic tunes to heighten the
sensation.
Though the lyrics may be incomprehen
sible, this album has excellent instrumental
work. The music is very catchy and the style
is varied enough so that you don't get bored
So, if you feel like listening to enticing tunes
without all the warbling, Balloon Guy is a
good deal.
