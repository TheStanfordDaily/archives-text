## The 						Birdcage 
### 
Walk into "The Birdcage" and enter a world
of politics, cross-dressing, great actors playing
one-dimensional characters and great direc
tors covering old ground. Remaking a classic is
always a tricky business, even for Mike Nichols
and Klaine May, collaborators on "The Grad
uate," and this film is no exception. Based on
"La (lage aux I'olles," this "Birdcage" revamps
a film that was in no great need of updating
and, in the process, moves the setting to Flori
da so the sets can be entirely pink and
turquoise, and lots ofextras get to wear thong
bikinis and roller blades.
"The Birdcage" is the nightclub at the center

of the film, a place where all the performers are
drag queens and all the patrons are Kennedys.
Its owner is Armand, played by Robin Williams
in a fairly sedate role. 1 le is the straight man to
his brashly comedic lover, Albert (a.k.a. "Stari
na"), an over-the-top Nathan lane. The two
live in comparative bliss atop their (!opacabana
as Armand lovingly endures the outbursts of
the flamboyant Albert and along with Albert's
maternal care, raises his son, Val (Dan I utter
man). The first half of the film has a few amus
ing moments and a few long tracking shots, but
is rather bland despite Lane's efforts to be as
melodramatic as possible.
Trouble appears in the form of Val's im
pending marriage. Although Val is proud of his
father and of his life at The Birdcage — "I'm
the only guy in my fraternity that doesn't come

from a broken home" — he fears his future in
laws, an ultraconservative senator and his wife
(Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest). When
Val asks Armand and Albert to pretend they are
straight to cater to the arrival of his uptight in
laws, "The Birdcage" enters the realm of farce.
It is here that l.ane — dressed up as a housewife
and spouting the tenets of Rush Limbaugh —
really shines and the movie gets the.laughs it
was trying for in the first half.
There are just too many problems in the
film th.it prevent it from being as hysterical as
it could have been. Not only are the formida
ble talents of Hackman and Wiest completely
wasted in playing such one-dimensional char
acters, but they are entirely unsympathetic on
all levels. The audience is expected to care
whether the senator is exposed to the press tor

"consorting" with Armand and Albert in an
election year, and while the self-absorbed,
racist, sexist and homophobic portrait Hack
man paints of the senator makes Lane's per
formance as a housewife funny, it does not
make one feel bad that the man might lose his
scat in congress. And although Futterman's
performance as Val begins well, he eventually
causes his family so much pain I started think
ing he was a schmuck too.
Williams and Lane are convincing as a cou
ple in love, but the politics overwhelm them
the same way they overwhelm the movie. As
it attempts to be hilarious, "The Birdcage"
loses its potential to be an honest portrayal of
gay relationships and becomes a vehicle lor
about 500 Bob Dole jokes.
