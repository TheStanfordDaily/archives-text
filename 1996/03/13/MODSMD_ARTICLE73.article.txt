# Homeward Bound II:
## Lost in San Francisco 
### 
The furry trio's lost again, this time in San
Francisco. For those of you who saw the first
"Homeward Bound," Disney didn't yet it
right the second time either. Both films sub
stitute catchy commentary for dialogue and

excessive sentimentality for plot line.
In "Homeward Bound II,"the film's main
character is Chance (voice by Michael ). Fox,
who comes across here more like Skippy I lan
delman than Alex P. Keaton),a bulldog who is

always getting
into trouble. His
misadventures
and campy
quips — "I wel
come danger
with open
paws," to name
one of the better
ones — substi
tute for enter
tainment or nar
rative.
Pun aficionados
can handle the
hair -brained
commentary; it's
when Chance
meets Delilah
(enter love inter
est), that things
go from just
bearable to whol
ly absurd: Sepa
rated from his
pals Sassy and
Shadow, Chance
falls head-over
tails for his new
pooch ie pookie.
It gets worse.
The two sniff

tails and the romance culminates in a scene
with the canine couple on a pier where
Delilah admits that, "I've never felt this way
about anyone before." Never mind the
cliche. Or that it's a bad pick-up line. The
point is that a dog says it.
Granted, it's a difficult task to make a
quality film with live animals. But director
David Hllis misses even on the homo sapi
ens. It's important to remember that the
film's target audience is children. With this
in mind, some of the movie s messages are
disturbing, l or example, it's clearly Dad
who decides whether the kids can keep
Delilah. And the dichotomy between
"street dogs ' and "pets" end in an unlor
tunate commentary that inner-cit\ life is
less desirable than middle-class suburbia.
Both messages are clear: Dad is the head of
the family and lower-class urban life is in
terior.
Others have done animal stories more
successfully. "Babe" (yeah, the one with the
pig) is a surprisingly believable film that
never descends into the Disney traps of try
ing-to-be-clever and misguided sentimental
ity.
Unfortunately, 1 )isney turned a wonderful
children's book ("The Incredible Journey,'' by
Sheila Burnford) into a full-fledged furry fi
asco. If you want a good animal story, rent
"Babe." Or better yet, read the book by Burn
ford.
If you're going to see a good (lick you're
barking up the wrong tree. "Homeward
Bound II" is a dog.
