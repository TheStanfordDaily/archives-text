# The 						Starmaker
## 
### 
If all of Giuseppe Tornatore s "The Star
maker" was as well done as the last 10 min
utes, it might be worth seeing. This Italian
film is obnoxiously repetitive and simply un
appealing.
The basic story is original and has poten
tial. Joe Marielli (Sergio Castellito) travels
the Sicilian countryside claiming to be a tal
ent scout for Universal Studios of Rome. Ba
sically 75 percent of the film is of Joe order
ing his victims to turn to the right, to the left,
to the center and then to quote the lines from
"Gone With the Wind." Watching the Sicilian
men and women quote Rhett and Scarlet —
"After all, tomorrow is another day" — is hu
morous for about the first 15 times, then it
loses its punch. Alone the wav, the Sicilians

confide in him their war stories, family se
crets, even unplanned pregnancies. Yet, Joe
could care less. 1 le wants their money.
The one shining performance comes from
Tiziana Lodato, who plays Beata, an orphan
and self-proclaimed "daughter of the Virgin
Mary" who falls in love with Joe. I.odato is
the epitome of innocence, even though her
character is expelled from the nunnery. The
actress conquers a difficult scene when she
plays the orphan as a patient in an insane asy
lum. Lodato has energy and an intriguing
glimmer in her eyes. Hopefully, her talent
will be better used in her next movie.
Castellito plays Joe well. His eyes and facial
expressions draw the audience into the film.
The film's problem is it's story line. Joe is
crafted to be so creepy, he's not fun to watch,
let alone worthy of support to win the girl.
Does Beata only want him for his ticket to
movie stardom?

1 lowever, if you want to see a film about
how prisons can rehabilitate, this is the film
for you. Though the fraudulent Joe enters the
prison a "bad" man, he emerges a gem. Too
bad his reform is completely unbelievable.
All of a sudden the creepy quack transforms
into a saint. (Not even Brothers Grimm fairy
tales could accomplish this transformation!)
Then "The Starmaker" delivers its moral.
Too bad Tornatore doesn't reform Joe earlier.
Like Joe's life, by this point the film is too late
to be salvaged.
This movie definitely requires a certain
mood from its audience: the patience needed
to watch the same thing over and over, and
then the naivete to believe both Beata's blind
devotion and Joe's reformation. "The Star
maker," like a polluted night sky, makes one
search for the shining, beautiful stars that
may not even exist in the murky haze.
