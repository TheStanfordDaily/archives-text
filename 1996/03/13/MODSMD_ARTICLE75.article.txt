## Fargo 
### 
Far for the course for the Coen brothers
("Barton Fink," "The Hudsucker Proxy")
means controlled mayhem, a wry sense of
irony and a keen eye for extracting the mani
ac lurking inside the ordinary citizen. Their
latest film won't disappoint.
A tight story that unravels to fantastic lev
els of violence and macabre humor, "Fargo"
also manages to keep constant an underlying
sense of the places and people of Minnesota.
In a land where people still say, "Aw-jeez" and
"Darn-tootin' " William H. Macy's Jerry
Lundegaard is a mild-mannered car sales
man driven to desperation. He has arranged
for the kidnapping of his wife so that he can
elicit some much-needed funds from his
tyrannical father-in-law, Wade Gustafson,
who is hard-pressed to part with his money.
Hiring two thugs to carry out the deed — the
loquacious Steve Buscemi (as the locals de
scribe him, a "funny-looking little guy") and
a blond "La Femme Nikita" cleaner type —
Macy starts a chain that quickly goes awry.
Enter Frances McDormand's pregnant
police chief Marge Gunderson, married to
Norm "Son-of-a-Gunderson." Her investiga
tion, pieced together from the superior ob
servation skills her deputy (who doubles as a
human coffee server) lacks, leads her to Min
neapolis, the scene of a crime that never hap-

pened. Behind
her sweet smile
and friendly dis
position lies a
razor sharp
mind intent on
cracking the
case. It leads her
to a crumbling
Macy, who both
bends and even
tually breaks
under the weight
of his con
science.
Americana in
all it's gory glory
is what drives
this fil m. The
Coens walk a
thin line between
the grotesque
and the sublime,
between ridicule
and reality and
between chaos
and control. One
thing: if I heard
"Avuh" one

more time, I'd
think I was in a Stephen King novel. That,
and scenes of body parts disposed of by wood
chippers are reminders of the horror that's
ever-present in small-town America. The

film, like the snow that inundates everything,
drips and freezes with the peculiarities of
mundane existence. Like an avalanche, it
gathers strength gradually, then faster until it
bowls the viewer over with its brilliance. Get

ting knocked off-balance by this kind of film
is a welcome experience, lust remember to
look for stray bits of main characters when
you get up to dust that snow off.

Admit it. You too would loooove to share a beer with Steve Buscemi.
