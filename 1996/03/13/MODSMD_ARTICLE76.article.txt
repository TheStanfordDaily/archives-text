# The 						Young Poisoner's Handbook
## 
### 
There is a scene in the new British export,
"The Young Poisoner's Handbook," in which
a poison victim sits hunched on the sofa, sick
to his stomach, a huge bowl lurking omi
nously on his knee. We watch in disgust as he,
every so often, torturously hurls very realistic
vomit into this bowl.
And there's another scene in which yet an
other poison victim is immobilized over the
bathroom sink, spewing green puke pretty
much everywhere. In fact, there are a lot of
scenes in"The Young Poisoner's Handbook"
that somehow involve the graphic depiction ot
vomit ejection. And quite a few times, you're
left to ask yourself, "Is this really worth it?"
The answer, oddly enough, is yes.
"The Young Poisoner's Handbook," as the
title may indicate, is not your average formu
la Hick. It's not even your average art house
movie. What it is is a highly-intelligent black
comedy which comments on British society
by telling the tale of 14-year-old Graham
Young, played with wide-eyed expertness by
Hugh O'Conor.
We first encounter young Graham in
1961, at his home in Neasden, England,
where his somewhat unhealthy obsession
with his homemade chemistry set has turned
the house on its ear because the tea is tainted
with ammonia again. Graham escapes pun
ishment by revealing that the real tea tainter
was actually his sister's depilatory, and we
giggle with relief. With his wide-eyed stare
and baby-faced grin, Graham seems harm
less. Besides, he's our narrator; he can't be a
murderous poisoner.

It becomes quite clear to us later on that
Graham is not so harmless. When a school
mate makes a date with the object of Gra
ham's affection, said schoolmate spends his
evening seriously regretting having eaten a
ham sandwich a la Graham. (This is where
we are first introduced to the puke motif.)
And we officially realize that Graham is not
your average "Mr. Wizard" fan when he poi
sons his mother slowly and agonizingly to
death and charts her "progress" on this jour
ney every so diligently in his little chemistry
journal. As his poor mum's hair falls out in
clumps and she vomits blood (the regurgita
tion motif again) while brushing her teeth,

Graham watches, as wide-eyed as the rest of
us, almost as if he doesn't believe his own
success.
Eventually his little escapades get out of
hand, and Graham is arrested and sent to a
mental hospital, where he spends eight years
convincing his shrink of his rehabilitation.
But guess what happens when Graham is re
leased? That's right, more vomiting!
Based on a true story, "The Young Poison
er's Handbook" is hilarious, once you get
past all the puke. We care about Graham (to
a certain extent), and we almost want him to
succeed in his psychotic toxicological mis
sion. Because the movie is told from Gra

ham's point of view, it's almost as if he's sane
and everyone else is crazy, which seems to be
a pretty common theme in movies that
"comment" on British society. O'Conor and
director Ben Ross make Graham a sympa
thetic character, and it's not until Graham
becomes a victim of his own concoctions that
we understand the true absurdity of what's
going on.
So if you have a fascination for the
macabre and an appreciation for the blackest
of comedies, "The Young Poisoner's Hand
book" is definitely recommended movie fare,
lust don't see it on a full stomach.
