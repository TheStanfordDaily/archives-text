## Wendy Lee Sick of cinephelia 
### 
I'm sick and tired of foreign film snobs.
You know, those smug, self-proclaimed
cinfyhiles. The tw/fMr-worshippers. The
cineaste- maniacs.
The ones who you hear in the ticket line
expostulating upon the recently discovered
director's cut of "The Seventh Seal," and
how that's completely changed their inter
protation of the game of chess with Death.
The ones who swear that the movie they're
just about to see is a remake of a French film
that was made 30 years ago, and how they al
ready know the remake's going to suck. The
ones who come out of theater debating the
symbolism of the cigar that the main char
acter kept lighting but not smoking — since
a cigar can't just be a cigar in the world of
haute cinema. These are the kind of people
who insist on having espressos and lattes
with their popcorn.
foreign film snobs can't act like ordinary

movie-goers, who just want to escape the
tribulations of modern life through the
flickering screen. No, they insist on having
some substance to what they watch. They
have to have plots and characters that make
you think. They consider any movie that
comes out of corporate Hollywood to be
pure excrescence. In my mind, foreign film
snobs even rank ahead of the indie freaks
when it comes to insufferable attitudes
about what movies — excuse me, films —
that are worth watching.
I've figured out that three things charac
terize foreign films (which, incidentally, can
also apply to the highbrow breed that watch
es them): they're incredibly long, they fea
ture characters who talk and talk and talk,
and they are completely devoid of action.
Case in point: "II Postino." Maybe you've
heard of it. It's about this tongue-tied, sim
ple-minded postman who delivers fan mail

to an exiled poet. Thus, ho spends a lot of his
time cycling along the Italian coast, which is
so glowingly photographed you'd swear it
was a tourism advertisement. I le teaches the
poet about the beauty of simple country life,
and the poet teaches him self-expression
through flowery language. Oh, and along
the way he happens to win the affections of
his beloved Beatrice with his poetry.
Be still my beating heart.
If "II Postino" was made by a Hollywood
mega-studio it would probably be about a
disgruntled postal worker who got his kicks
by sending people anonymous hate mail. In
stead of love poems, he'd send threats to high
governmental officials (hey, even the presi
dent ). Which would you rather see — a sappy
valentine that maybe only Knglish majors
would appreciate, or a John Grisham knock
off involving chase scenes and shoot-outs and
a token sex scene in a post office? Case closed.

And then there's the whole problem with
subtitles. I mean, trying to simultaneously
read subtitles and watch the action on the
screen is like trying to rub your head and
your stomach at the same time. Vou don't go
to the movies to read. You go to be enter
tained. And I don't get the whole dubbed
vs. subtitled controversy. What's wrong
with having the valedictorian from the
Academy of Overacting play 17 different
parts? It's not sacrilege. It's called giving
your brain a break.
II Hob Dole was elected president and
made 1 nglish the official language of the
United States, perhaps foreign films would
be banned, big loss. So we'd lose an Acade
my Award category. So reviewers would get
bored and critics would lose half of the
choices on their top-10 lists. At least we'd be
rid of the foreign film snobs and their
whiny,faux, art-house subculture.
