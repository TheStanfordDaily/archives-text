# Party security stays the same, police say
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Stanford Police say they have made no
changes to party security despite a student per
ception that police are cracking down.
"From our standpoint, nothing has
changed," said Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington. "There is a heightened awareness
(of safety) on the part of students and adminis
trators."
The increased concern is in part due to an in
cident at a Delta Sigma Theta sorority fund
raiser in February when two men were injured
in a shooting. The people involved were not
Stanford students.
A University committee has been set up to
create a campus-wide standard for security at
parties.
Police conduct routine checkups at all cam
pus parties. In recent weeks, a number of par
ties were shut down after police visited. Her
rington said for the most part, students shut
down parties voluntarily.
At a March 3 Phi Delta Theta party, the po
lice filed three citations â€” two for minors in
possession of alcohol and one for serving alcohol
to minors, Herrington said. While minor in pos
session citations are common, he said citations

for serving minors are "fairly rare" on campus.
Phi Delt Vice President Chris Muchmore
said police intervention at the fraternity is "rel
atively rare."
"Nothing of the sort has happened in several
years, at least not since I've been here," he said.
Parties last weekend at Chi Theta Chi and
Griffin House in the Suites also were closed
down, this time due to noise complaints.
Students may see the rash of parties ending
early as the result of tighter security, but Her
rington said parties are closing down without
pressure from the police.
"My people are reporting that parties are
breaking up on their own," Herrington said.
"There's often a quick decision made that the
party's over once we stick our heads in."
Calling the checkups on parties "routine"
measures aimed primarily to prevent disorder
from occurring, Herrington said, "Droppingby
to talk to [residents hosting the parties] is one
of our normal procedures."
Police have encountered fewer problem par
ties recently than in past years, he added.
"Things are much better now than they
were eight or 10 years ago [when] there were
thousands of people drinking on the streets,
and we were picking people off lawns with alco
hol poisoning," Herrington said. "In general,

parties are better managed, more contained."
"There are always problems, but the num
ber of serious problems has declined," he said.
"We haven't solved the problem, but we're on
the right road."
The party safety committee is looking for
concrete ways to solve the problems.
In its first preliminary meeting on Friday,
the committee discussed crowd control, facility
capacity, off-campus guests, security staff
based on the sizes and types of events, server
training and devising a clear set of safety stan
dards which would be applicable to parties
hosted by fraternities, residences and student
organizations, said Heather Dunn, assistant
director of the Office of Student Activities.
"We want to make students aware of the
risks, liabilities and possibly serious conse
quences" of throwing parties on campus, Dunn
said. "We want students to determine what will
best help them manage their parties."
Dunn added that the Office of Student Ac
tivities will enforce a new requirement next
quarter that requires hosts of parties involving
outside guests to attend workshops and discuss
risk management with administrators.
The committee is also considering requiring
party hosts to inform the police of their plans,
Dunn said.
