Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit:
Essays on Native American Life Today
During the months of March and April, Kepler's has been highlighting Native American writing with
a display of books and a flier of recommended novels, poetry, short stories, and essays. We are very
fortunate to be able to welcome, in conjunction with this attempt at greater awareness, Leslie
Marmon Silko. Her first book, Ceremony, is used as a text in university courses throughout the
world. Following Ceremony are equally important works such as Almanac of the Dead, Lagiina
Woman (poems), The Man to Sandßainclouds (anthologies), and Storyteller (poems and short
stories). Her most recent work, Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit explores Pueblo Indian
language and literature. Further, she uses this study as a base from which she examines the
interrelationship of human identity, imagination, and storytelling of the Pueblo Indians.
