IMMIGRATION
By large majorities, Americans of all ethnic backgrounds favor reductions in immigration. For example,
in November, 1994, a Times/Mirror Center Poll indicated that 82% of Americans think that the U.S. should
restrict immigration, up from 76% in 1992; 63% said that immigrants take the jobs, housing and health
care of Americans. The 1992 Latino National Political Survey, the largest poll of Latinos in the U.S.,
indicated that more than 7 out of 10 felt there were too many immigrants.
Legal immigration adds nearly one million persons to the United States every year. Our explosive
growth puts increasing pressure on social and natural resources and services, including education and
health care. In California, for instance, the Department of Finance projects that student population growth
will require building a 650-student school each day to keep up. —The Washington Times, ad 5-10-95
