Silicon Valley giant David Packard
dies at 83; Friends and employees
remembei his kindness, intelligence

David Packard, Hewlett-Packard
Co. Co-founder and Stanford Univer
sity benefactor, died Tuesday of pneu
monia after being hospitalized at
Stanford Hospital for 10 days. He was
83.
A 1934 graduate of Stanford,
Packard is being remembered as the
founder of Silicon Valley and a con
tributor to all aspects of life around
the Bay Area.
"He was always a presence, always
an adviser, always expressed his
views," University President Gerhard
Casper said Friday.
Beginning with his contributions
to everything from Stanford sports to
student government in his under
graduate days, Packard never strayed
far from his alma mater. He served on
the Board of Trustees for 15 years,

two as president, and at the time of his
death remained a trustee of the
Hoover Institution.
Packard was first drawn to Stan
ford from his native Colorado by the
work of the late Frederick Terman, a
professor of electrical engineering.
Terman had a great influence on
Packard and William Hewlett — en
couraging them to found the company
that became so successful — and the
two repaid their mentor many times
over the years.
Packard and Hewlett contributed
funds for the construction of the Ter
man Engineering Center and helped
start the Terman Fellows program in
1994. The donations were only part of
the total $300 million given to Stan
ford by one or both of the families over
the years.

Electrical Engineering Depart
ment, remembered that, along
with the monetary help, Packard
served as the same kind of role
model as Terman had.
"When I was recruited to Stan
ford in 1954," Linville said. "Dr.
Terman arranged that I spend half
a day with David Packard. It was
an absolutely persuasive kind of
contact.
"It was clear that this man had
a great interest in Stanford Uni
versity and more than that, he had
a sense of quality that was just

Packard was remembered as
someone very down-to-earth de
spite his wealth. He was known for
an unusually candid manner, as
someone unafraid of pointing out
problems and suggesting solu

White, who was also a chair of the
Electrical Engineering Depart

traordinary perception — as well
as his ability to be unpretentious
— during a visit to the San Fran
cisco Exploratorium.
White was director of the Ex
ploratorium for a few years and
had invited Packard to tour the fa
cility and possibly make a dona

able to suggest areas for possible
improvement.
"It was amazing to me that an
outsider could grasp the structure
of a place like that," White said.
The same day, White took
Packard out to lunch at the ritzy
St. Francis Yacht Club in San
Francisco. "David Packard arrived
in a car that the Hertz people
would call 'not exactly new,' "
White remembered. "And off the
lunch menu, he ordered a ham

burger and a glass of milk."
In his early days at Stanford,
the 6-foot-5 Packard was known
more for his contributions to ath
letics than to engineering. He was
a member of a football team that
went to. three Rose Bowls in the
early 19305. He also set a record in
track and lettered in varsity bas
ketball.
Always athletic, it was during a
hiking trip in Colorado that
Packard and Hewlett pledged to
start a company together some
day.
That chance would come in
1939, after Packard had left Stan
ford to do graduate work at the
University of Colorado and work
for General Electric Co. in Sch
enectady, N.Y. With Terman's en
couragement, Packard left his se
cure job to return to Stanford on a
fellowship, soon crossing paths
again with his friend Hewlett, who
was a graduate student in electri
cal engineering.
With $538 in capital, Hewlett-
Packard Co. was founded in 1939
in a garage in Palo Alto — widely
held as the site where Silicon Val
ley began. A coin toss decided
whose name went first on the com
pany logo.
Among the company's first
products was a radio oscillator de
signed by Hewlett, eight of which
were bought by Walt Disney Stu
dios to develop the soundtrack to
"Fantasia."
Shortly before his return to Cal
ifornia, Packard married Lucile
Salter, whom he had met as a dish
washer in her sorority house at
Stanford. Also a generous philan
thropist, Lucile Packard died in
1987, leaving the legacy of the
campus children's hospital which
bears her name.
Packard's influence on medi
cine at Stanford extended to his
presidency on the Board of
Trustees during the time when the

School of Medicine moved from
San Francisco to campus. In 1986,
at the same time as giving $40 mil
lion for the Lucile Salter Packard
Children's Hospital, the Packards
donated $30 million to the Medical
School to modernize prenatal facil
ities and pediatric research labora
tories. The Packard Foundation
gave an additional $25 million for
pediatric advancement in 1993.

'I think there's no
doubt, for reasons
that go beyond their
philanthropy, that
[Hewlett and
Packard] can be
compared only to
the founders, Leland
and Jane Stanford.'
— John Ford

Children's Hospital President
and CEO Lorraine Zippiroli re
called Packard as "a man who was
truly a legend who walked among
us. His generosity is seen every
where in the community and per
sonally to those of us at Packard
Children's Hospital," Zippiroli
said in a statement. "The light of
Mr. Packard's life will be seen
through the eyes of the countless
children who have been restored to
their optimal health because our
hospital was here."
Vice President of Development
John Ford, who has coordinated
many donations from Packard
over the past 14 years, said
Packard's generosity went deeper
than numbers.
"I think there's no doubt, for

reasons that go beyond their phil
anthropy, that [Hewlett and
Packard] can be compared only to
the founders, Leland and Jane
Stanford," Ford said. Packard was
"a towering individual, not only
physically," Ford recalled. "He was
also a man of great ideas, a sense of
purpose .... He had a great faith
in people — in finding people and
letting them run with their ideas."
Packard gave of his life to Stan
ford in more than one way, Casper
said. His relationship with the
University "has lasted for almost
two-third of Stanford's existence,"
the president noted. "He came
here in 1930 as a student and im
mediately became very well
known on campus .... From then
on, the connection to Stanford
lasted."
And the connection was on a
very personal level, Casper said, of
fering another example of
Packard's kindness.
The Packards owned some
property in Monterey, near the
Monterey Bay Aquarium they
helped found. After Casper be
came Stanford's president,
Packard offered the property any
time Casper needed some solitude.
"I have done that several
times," Casper said. "When I want
to go write something, I do it in
seclusion.
"Two years ago, when I was at
the house, I found out he was in
Monterey at the same time,"
Casper said. "I found out he was
staying in a hotel in Monterey be
cause he didn't want to disturb
me."
Packard is survived by four chil
dren and nine grandchildren.
In lieu of flowers, the family
asks for donations to the Packard
Children's Hospital, Monterey
Bay Aquarium, the Stanford
School of Engineering or a charity
of the giver's choice.

the president noted. "He came

lasted."
And the connection was on a
very personal level, Casper said, of
fering another example of
Packard's kindness.
The Packards owned some
property in Monterey, near the
Monterey Bay Aquarium they

Packard offered the property any
time Casper needed some solitude.
"I have done that several
times," Casper said. "When I want
to go write something, I do it in
seclusion.
"Two years ago, when I was at
the house, I found out he was in
Monterey at the same time,"
Casper said. "I found out he was
staying in a hotel in Monterey be

Silicon Valley giant David Packard
dies at 83; Friends and employees
remembei his kindness, intelligence

David Packard, Hewlett-Packard
Co. Co-founder and Stanford Univer
sity benefactor, died Tuesday of pneu
monia after being hospitalized at
Stanford Hospital for 10 days. He was
83.
A 1934 graduate of Stanford,
Packard is being remembered as the
founder of Silicon Valley and a con
tributor to all aspects of life around
the Bay Area.
"He was always a presence, always
an adviser, always expressed his
views," University President Gerhard
Casper said Friday.
Beginning with his contributions
to everything from Stanford sports to
student government in his under
graduate days, Packard never strayed
far from his alma mater. He served on
the Board of Trustees for 15 years,

two as president, and at the time of his
death remained a trustee of the
Hoover Institution.
Packard was first drawn to Stan
ford from his native Colorado by the
work of the late Frederick Terman, a
professor of electrical engineering.
Terman had a great influence on
Packard and William Hewlett — en
couraging them to found the company
that became so successful — and the
two repaid their mentor many times
over the years.
Packard and Hewlett contributed
funds for the construction of the Ter
man Engineering Center and helped
start the Terman Fellows program in
1994. The donations were only part of
the total $300 million given to Stan
ford by one or both of the families over
the years.

and University President Gerhard Casper at a memorial service held for Packard at Memorial Church on Friday.
Electrical Engineering Depart
ment, remembered that, along
with the monetary help, Packard
served as the same kind of role
model as Terman had.
"When I was recruited to Stan
ford in 1954," Linville said. "Dr.
Terman arranged that I spend half
a day with David Packard. It was
an absolutely persuasive kind of
contact.
"It was clear that this man had
a great interest in Stanford Uni
versity and more than that, he had
a sense of quality that was just
unique," Linville said.
Packard was remembered as
someone very down-to-earth de
spite his wealth. He was known for
an unusually candid manner, as
someone unafraid of pointing out
problems and suggesting solu
tions. Materials Science Prof. Bob
White, who was also a chair of the
Electrical Engineering Depart
ment, said Packard showed his ex
traordinary perception — as well
as his ability to be unpretentious
— during a visit to the San Fran
cisco Exploratorium.
White was director of the Ex
ploratorium for a few years and
had invited Packard to tour the fa
cility and possibly make a dona
tion. Packard immediately was
able to suggest areas for possible
improvement.
"It was amazing to me that an
outsider could grasp the structure
of a place like that," White said.
The same day, White took
Packard out to lunch at the ritzy
St. Francis Yacht Club in San
Francisco. "David Packard arrived
in a car that the Hertz people
would call 'not exactly new,' "
White remembered. "And off the
lunch menu, he ordered a ham

burger and a glass of milk."
In his early days at Stanford,
the 6-foot-5 Packard was known
more for his contributions to ath
letics than to engineering. He was
a member of a football team that
went to. three Rose Bowls in the
early 19305. He also set a record in
track and lettered in varsity bas
ketball.
Always athletic, it was during a
hiking trip in Colorado that
Packard and Hewlett pledged to
start a company together some
day.
That chance would come in
1939, after Packard had left Stan
ford to do graduate work at the
University of Colorado and work
for General Electric Co. in Sch
enectady, N.Y. With Terman's en
couragement, Packard left his se
cure job to return to Stanford on a
fellowship, soon crossing paths
again with his friend Hewlett, who
was a graduate student in electri
cal engineering.
With $538 in capital, Hewlett-
Packard Co. was founded in 1939
in a garage in Palo Alto — widely
held as the site where Silicon Val
ley began. A coin toss decided
whose name went first on the com
pany logo.
Among the company's first
products was a radio oscillator de
signed by Hewlett, eight of which
were bought by Walt Disney Stu
dios to develop the soundtrack to
"Fantasia."
Shortly before his return to Cal
ifornia, Packard married Lucile
Salter, whom he had met as a dish
washer in her sorority house at
Stanford. Also a generous philan
thropist, Lucile Packard died in
1987, leaving the legacy of the
campus children's hospital which
bears her name.
Packard's influence on medi
cine at Stanford extended to his
presidency on the Board of
Trustees during the time when the

School of Medicine moved from
San Francisco to campus. In 1986,
at the same time as giving $40 mil
lion for the Lucile Salter Packard
Children's Hospital, the Packards
donated $30 million to the Medical
School to modernize prenatal facil
ities and pediatric research labora
tories. The Packard Foundation
gave an additional $25 million for
pediatric advancement in 1993.
