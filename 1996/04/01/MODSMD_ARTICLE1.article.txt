Silicon Valley giant David Packard
dies at 83; Friends and employees
remembei his kindness, intelligence

David Packard, Hewlett-Packard
Co. Co-founder and Stanford Univer
sity benefactor, died Tuesday of pneu
monia after being hospitalized at
Stanford Hospital for 10 days. He was
83.
A 1934 graduate of Stanford,
Packard is being remembered as the
founder of Silicon Valley and a con
tributor to all aspects of life around
the Bay Area.
"He was always a presence, always
an adviser, always expressed his
views," University President Gerhard
Casper said Friday.
Beginning with his contributions
to everything from Stanford sports to
student government in his under
graduate days, Packard never strayed
far from his alma mater. He served on
the Board of Trustees for 15 years,

two as president, and at the time of his
death remained a trustee of the
Hoover Institution.
Packard was first drawn to Stan
ford from his native Colorado by the
work of the late Frederick Term an, a
professor of electrical engineering.
Terman had a great influence on
Packard and William Hewlett — en
couraging them to found the company
that became so successful — and the
two repaid their mentor many times
over the years.
Packard and Hewlett contributed
funds for the construction of the Ter
man Engineering Center and helped
start the Terman Fellows program in
1994. The donations were only part of
the total $300 million given to Stan
ford by one or both of the families over
the years.
