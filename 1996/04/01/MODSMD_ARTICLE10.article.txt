# Mascot banned in ESPN Web scandal
## 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
The Stanford Tree faces five years of proba
tion due to a failed attempt to trick the Devil.
Two undergraduate students were caught
trying to stuff ESPN's cyberspace ballot box in
the sports network's Battle of the Mascots. The
Tree was disqualified from its first-round match
against the Duke Blue Devil by the tournament
selection committee.
"Already, folks are calling it Treegate," re
ported ESPN on its World Wide Web site.
In a subsequent poll, site users voted to place
the evergreen delinquent on five years of proba
tion. The sentence was far from unanimous, 51.8
percent in favor and 48.2 percent against, yet few
mentioned the possibility of fraud. ESPN pre
vented anyone accessing the site on a Stanford
computer from voting.
ESPNet's Battle of the Mascots allows fans to
select their favorites among 16 college mascots
through head-to-head competitions.
The scandal unfolded when Chip Haven, the
University's acting director of networking sys
tems, received a complaint from ESPN. Appar
ently, the ESPN site, one of the most heavily ac
cessed sites on the Internet, had been "rendered
inoperative by a bombardment of requests."
Network security officer Steve Hansen was
able to identify the accounts used and to shut
them down. Apparently, a script activated on five
University computers repeatedly accessed ESP-
Net and voted for the Tree.
According to Haven, two students, a comput
er science major and a biology major, violated the
rules of "leland" accounts. The policy of Univer
sity's computing resources implies that users
cannot harass others or deny them access.
Since scripts sent from Stanford prevented
anybody from using the ESPNet site, the con
tract was violated. Haven therefore removed the
ability of the two students to access their ac
counts. He calls the disqualification of the Tree
"a reasonable outcome."
This view is not shared by Council of Presi
dents member Jon Oram, who protested the
punishment on behalf of the ASSU in a letter to
ESPNet. He argues that "rules never prohibited

nor discussed" multiple vol ing.
Oram further wrote that "since these votes
were (unfairly) excluded from the final count, it
is completely inappropriate to disqualify the
Tree himself from the competition due to the ac
tions of a few students."
In an official response to Oram, Haven said
students disrupted "a legitimate business activi
ty" and that ESPN is generously willing to forgo
a lawsuit.
ESPNet features editor Mitch Gelman reaf
firms his company's intention to treat the inci

dent with a sense of humor. He said the Tree,
which could have beaten the Blue Devil on its
own, is perhaps the scandal's only "tragic" vic
tim.
The mascot agrees. Sophomore Chris Bon
zon, the man behind the Tree, calls ESPNet's
punishment "pretty ridiculous.
Band director Josh Schiller, a junior, said it is
unfair "to punish the entire University and the
Tree for what was done without their knowl
edge." However, he notes, those who worry
about the incident "take life too seriously."
