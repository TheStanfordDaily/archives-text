## Yeltsin reveals peace plan Russia's concessions do little to end fighting in Chechnya 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Desperate to
show voters he will stop the war
that is sinking his presidency,
Boris Yeltsin announced a halt to
combat operations in Chechnya,
limited troop withdrawals and a
willingness to hold indirect talks
with the rebels' leader yesterday.
But his long-promised peace
plan stopped short of promising
an end to the fighting and left
scant hope for an imminent settle
ment.
Yeltsin refused to budge on the
separatists' two main demands —
full withdrawal of Russian troops
and independence for Chechnya
— and his tone was more tough
than conciliatory.
"Without doubt, we will not put
up with terrorist acts and we will
respond to them adequately,"
Yeltsin said.
The announcement came just
11 weeks before Russia's presi
dential election, with the unpopu
lar Yeltsin trailing Communist

Gennady Zyuganov and voters
demanding an end to the blood
shed in Chechnya.
It also capped a month of with
ering air and ground attacks on
Chechen strongholds, apparently
intended to push the rebels into
the southern mountains before
the plan was announced.
Thousands of troops were
reportedly continuing large-scale
operations yesterday in eight
sealed-off mountain villages of
southeastern Chechnya, and
Yeltsin's open-ended statement
left it unclear what would become
of troops in such hot spots.
The announcement was met
with skepticism by politicians,
analysts and even Russia's mili
tary commander in Chechnya,
who cast doubt on the feasibility
of the unilateral cease-fire, which
Yellsin said would begin within
hours.
"It's unlikely that combat oper
ations will be stopped right after

the president's statement," Gen.
Vyacheslav Tikhomirov told NTV
Independent Television from
Chechnya. "You understand, it's
impossible."
A series of broken promises and
defied orders throughout the 16-
month-old war have raised serious
questions both about Yeltsin's
intentions and about his control of
the army.
His Security Council declared
the military operation in Chech
nya to be effectively completed as
of Jan. 25, 1995. But fighting has
raged on for another 14 months
and the death toll is now estimat
ed at over 30,000. Most of those
killed were civilians.
Reading a statement at his
desk, a Russian flag at his side,
Yeltsin declared a unilateral
cease-fire in Chechnya starting at
midnight yesterday, along with
unspecified, phased withdrawals
"from the tranquil areas of Chech
nya to its administrative borders."
