— For the first time, U.S. troops this
week will provide security and other
limited support for U.N. war crimes
investigators, the commander of the
NATO-led peace force in Bosnia said
yesterday.
Adm. Leighton Smith told reporters
he did not expect any major confronta
tions when investigators from the U.N.
War Crimes Tribunal search for mass
graves and other evidence of atrocities
near Srebrenica, in eastern Bosnia.
The U.N. search, which is expected
to start tomorrow, will be in Serb terri
tory at sites of alleged massacres of
thousands of Bosnian Muslims last
summer.
"There may be some demonstra
tions," Smith said. "This obviously is a
very emotional issue. But I don't antic
ipate that there will be problems" for
the U.S. troops.
Smith was escorting Defense Secre
tary William Perry on a visit with U.S.

troops at Comanche Base, just west of
here, where attack helicopters of the
4th Aviation Brigade are based.
Perry arrived here yesterday morn
ing and later flew to Sarajevo where he
met with NATO commanders and act
ing Bosnian President Ejup Ganic. He
then flew to Albania.
Perry was supposed to take a heli
copter tour over parts of the demilita
rized buffer that is being patrolled by
the Implementation Force, or IFOR,
troops, but a blinding snow storm kept
him grounded. Instead he visited
Comanche Base for a hriefing on U.S.
operations and a chat with some Amer
ican soldiers.
Asked about providing security at
Srebrenica, Perry told reporters he
fully supports Smith's plan, but he
mentioned no details.
In his comments to reporters, Smith
initially was reluctant to discuss
specifics of the Srebrenica plan. Pressed
for details, he said U.S. officers would

provide a liaison team that could, if an
emergency arose, immediately call on
U.S. firepower in the area. Some emer
gency medical support also will be pro
vided, as well as possible lodging for the
U.N. investigators, the admiral said.
Another officer, who spoke on condi
tion of anonymity, said the liaison team
of U.S. soldiers would be within hand
held radio range of the grave sites.
Smith was adamant that this did not
reflect a change in policy. He mentioned
that the NATO-led force in Bosnia had
provided similar support for war crimes
investigators in the sector of Bosnia
being monitored by British forces. This
is the first time, however, that U.S.
forces have done so, Smith said.
"We will not guard grave sites, we
will not exhume bodies, we will not pro
vide individual security," he said. The
idea is to secure the roadways in the
vicinity of Srebrenica and to be avail
able in case the investigators get in
trouble.
