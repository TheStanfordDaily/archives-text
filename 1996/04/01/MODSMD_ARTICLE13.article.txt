Mutant gene discovered
DALLAS (AP) -- Researchers say they have
found a gene that for the first time can be direct
ly associated with coronary artery disease and
adult diabetes.
Their report appears in today's edition of the
journal Circulation, published by the Dallas
based American Heart Association.
The gene targeted by the research is a
mutant or changed form of one that tells the
body how to make an enzyme that turns fats in
the bloodstream into a source of energy.
In the study people carrying the mutant gene
were 1.73 times more likely to have coronary
arteries blocked by fatty deposits and three
times more likely to develop diabetes as adults.
Video time bomb?
WASHINGTON (AP) — A court order for
President Clinton to give videotaped testimony
in a Whitewater criminal trial has producers of
Republican attack ads pondering potential uses
of the footage in the fall campaign.
Whether Clinton's testimony ends up appear
ing in GOP ads depends on its public release by
a federal judge in Arkansas, a likely scenario if it
is played before jurors, legal experts say.
