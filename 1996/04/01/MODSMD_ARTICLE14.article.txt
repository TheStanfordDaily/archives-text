JORDAN, Mont. (AP) - The
Freemen holed up on an isolated
farm where they claim to have
their own legal system should sur
render and face an established
court, a leader of another militant
group said yesterday.
Others urged that outsiders
stay away and not get involved in
the standoff between federal
authorities and the Freemen, bar
ricaded on a wheat farm on the
snow-covered prairie of east-cen
tral Montana.
More than 100 FBI agents have
been keeping watch on the
Freemen's compound, 30 miles
outside Jordan, since two leaders
of the group were arrested on
March 25.
A third member of the group
surrendered Saturday. Authorities
won't say how many people are
still at the farm, but 14 of them are
believed to be wanted on various
state and federal charges.
Neighbors said the Freemen
have built bunkers and openly
stockpiled food, fuel and weapons
â€” possibly including military
armaments.

FBI agents have twice stopped a
pair of sympathizers trying to
reach the farm.
"Stay home, and let the negotia
tors and the people on the site han
dle this problem, so we don't have
a Waco or a Ruby Ridge," John
Parsons of the Tri-State Militia of
South Dakota said yesterday.
"The key thing here is that we
need a peaceful solution to this
problem. They need to come out
and face their forum in a court of
law and state their problems in a
court of law under a system that is
just," Parsons said on ABC's "This
Week With David Brinkley."
The Freemen deny the legiti
macy of the government. Members
call their compound "Justus
Township" and insist they have
their own laws and their own
courts.
The Washington Post reported
yesterday that the FBI was consid
ering an offer from white sepa
ratist Randy Weaver, whose wife
and son were killed by federal
agents in 1992 in a shootout at
Ruby Ridge, Idaho, to mediate an
end to the standoff.
