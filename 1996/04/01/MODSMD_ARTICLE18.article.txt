The University should not
allocate more office space
for Edmonds and her staff

THE UNIVERSITY IS often
accused of devoting insuffi
cient resources to student
affairs. While it is true that in a
budget-tightening time it is more
important to devote scarce dollars
to academic departments than to
Residential Education, it is neces
sary to maintain top-notch stu
dent-oriented programs if the Uni
versity is to remain attractive to
undergraduates.
Thus, the University deserves
congratulations when it makes an
attempt to put more resources at
the disposal of offices directing
student affairs, as it has done by
moving the office of Vice Provost
and Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds into a much larger
space. However, in this particular
case, it is questionable whether
the change is, in fact, a beneficial
use of resources.
Until last month, the vice
provost's office was situated in a
small suite at the front of Tresid
der Union's second floor. It has
now been relocated to the former
Computer Science Department
offices surrounding the Tresidder
Lalß. Dean of Students Marc
Wais' office has moved into those
vacated by Edmonds, and the
Office of Financial Aid will be mov
ing into the former dean of stu
dents' office on the third floor of
Old Union.
It is appropriate for the dean of
students to be moved to a location
more accessible to students, as his
office has been. And there is no
reason to dispute the Financial Aid
Office's purported need for more
space. However, there is also no
apparent reason for Edmonds'
office to occupy as much space as it
now does.
According to the Stanford

Directory, nine people — including
Edmonds — work in the vice
provost's office. Thus, nine people
are now filling the space formerly
occupied by a much larger contin
gent of computer science profes
sors, graduate students and class
rooms. Any observer must wonder
why such a large amount of space
is necessary for such a small staff.
Furthermore, this is a staff
which seems to accomplish nearly
nothing. Most of the real work
done by those under the student
affairs aegis is accomplished else
where — in the dean of students'
office, the Office of Student Affairs
and the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions, to name a few.
In Edmonds' state of student
affairs address, delivered October
24, she articulated a clear set of
goals for her office this year — to
create three task forces, charged
with examining Greek life, the
alcohol policy and judicial policy.
Since that day, Edmonds has suc
ceeded in developing guidelines for
only one of the three task forces.
In roughly six months, that seems
to be her office's greatest achieve
ment.
Thus it seems incongruous to
suggest the vice provost's office
needs greater space to carry on its
work. There are neither enough
people working there nor enough
being done to justify occupancy of
such a large amount of space.
Furthermore, Edmonds' office
is now located in particularly prime
storefront space in Tresidder.
ASSU business projects like the
Cardinal Collection and Lecture
Notes are trapped in the building's
first floor; they would certainly be
more viable tenants for some of
Edmonds' new office space. The
Stanford Management Company is
seeking new revenue sources in
Tresidder — perhaps they could
rent some of the space to retailers.
The University seems resigned
to the fact that Edmonds' office
will accomplish little. What must
be questioned is whether it must
be done in such a copious amount
of prime space.
