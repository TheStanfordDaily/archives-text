# Hundreds attend Packard memorial

Mourners hailed Stanford graduate and
Hewlett-Packard Co. Co-founder David
Packard as a father, colleague and role
model at a memorial service on Friday.
The speakers at the service in Memorial
Church — filled with mourners despite
Packard's request to have no memorial ser
vice — remembered him as the leader of one
of the most successful companies in the
world and a lifelong friend of the University.
Packard died at Stanford Hospital on
Tuesday.
Provost Condoleezza Rice commented
on the pairing of Packard and Stanford Uni-
versity that seemed so perfect.
"From the day he and his lifetime
partner Bill Hewlett entered Fred
Terman's engineering laboratory,
David Packard and Stanford was an
inspired match," Rice said.
"David expressed his love for the
University first and foremost by liv
ing a life that honored its highest
values," she said. "David... under
stood the essence of a university —
that our most important contribu
tion to society is the people that we
teach and train."
Morris Doyle, who served on the
Stanford Board of Trustees with
Packard, said time, money and en
thusiasm donated proved Packard's
devotion to the University.
"Although Dave served his coun
try with great distinction and be
came a world citizen ... he was a
Stanford man from the beginning,"
Doyle said.
Current Hewlett-Packard CEO
Lou Piatt noted that the company
Packard built was based on values
unique for businesses of the time,
such as trust, challenge, teamwork,
flexibility and innovation.
"The most important lesson I
learned from Dave is that you can
bring these values to life and give
them real meaning by applying
them consistently to everything
you do," Piatt said.
Also noted for his modesty and
humble nature, Packard was
changed little by his success and
wealth. Piatt pointed to a statement
Packard made when being honored
for his life: "I think you get the most
satisfaction in trying to do some

thing useful. After you've done
that, you ought to forget about it
ai.J do something else. You
shouldn't gloat about anything
you've done. You ought to keep
going and find something better to
do."
Packard was also known for hav
ing a sharp eye and a remarkable
understanding of complex situa
tions. When he saw a problem, he
didn't hesitate to explain, often sug
gesting possible solutions.
Hoover Institution Distin
guished Fellow and former Secre
tary of State George Shultz recalled
a session in the Oval Office while
Packard was serving as President
Nixon's deputy defense secretary.
The topic of discussion was a pro
posed loan to Lockheed Corp., a
major defense contractor.
While some cabinet members felt
the loan was vital to the country's
defense, Packard suggested the
problem was the fault of Lockheed's
move into the commercial air busi
ness. If the commercial air aspect of
the company went bankrupt, the de
fense work would take care of itself,
he said.
"That was obviously unwelcome,
but it was dead honest," Shultz said.
"Neither Dave nor I was ever invited
back to the Oval Office to discuss
that issue. But what it said to me was
one more illustration of this integri
ty and honesty that was so charac
teristic of the man."
Through his 83 years, Packard
never shied away from accepting
new challenges.
"Dave's race is won," Rice said,
"and we are all the richer for his hav
ing run it so well."
More than 1,200 people attended
the service.
