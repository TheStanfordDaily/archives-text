## Springtime, Stanford-style 
### 
IT'S SPRING AT Stanford, I can toll.
Sunsplash fliers are up, freshman
girls are fretting about Rush, and the
Group Comm sign-up lists are complete
ly full.
As Dickens might have said, it is the
best of times, it is the worst of times.
Eight thousand dollars for what
amounts to nine weeks of vacation.
The rituals of spring are well known.
Andy in Branner finally builds up
enough nerve to call the cute girl on page
23 of the frosh book. She lives in Larkin,
but they've never met.
("Um, I know you don't know me, but
my dorm is having a boat dance, and
. . .")
As 19-year-olds, they feel pretty cool
taking swigs from the bottle of Southern
Comfort they snuck onto the ship.
By 11:00, Andy is passed out on the
deck. Meanwhile, she's hooking up with
his roommate.
Spring. When all our priorities get
rearranged. Credit loads drop to single
digits, the majority of them falling under
the "Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation" heading. You choose your
classes according to when each one's
final occurs and by what percentage of
the total grade the exam carries. Multi
ple midterms and problem sets are
scorned — they require far too much
work. A research paper? Yeah, right.
Avoid classes for the first eight weeks,
then cram for the last one. It's a fair

trade. Your adviser hates it, but he hates
everything you've done thus far. His rec
ommendation won't mean much any
way.
It's a time for slacking, not studying.
Knock out all your distribution require
ments in one quarter. Learn to play the
accordion. Get a tan, for God's sake.
Just put down the books.
The Coffee House is packed with
seniors, frolicking in worldly pleasure
one last time before reality hits them
squarely in the face. "I can't believe it's
over," they scream to each other every
five minutes. "It seems like we just got
here."
Yep, spring is here. The "water" in
Lake Lag has been stagnant for several
weeks now. Bacteria the size of small
mammals patrol the surface, anxious to
mutate into more lethal forms. And like
a bad case of acne, weeds grow from the
center of our beloved puddle to the edges,
looking more like Lambda Nu's front
lawn than a legitimate body of water.
In other words, the lake is ready for
swimming.
Dump a load of gravel at one end to
make a beach; throw a lifeguard up in
the chair to protect us from whatever
may lurk in Lag's most mysterious
waters. Fifty dollars to anyone who dares
to put their head underwater. Another
25 bucks to those who survive the expe
rience.
It must be spring. Stanford has that

country club feel about it again. Even the
Oval is dotted with young vixens in biki
nis, awakened from their six-month
hibernation to tempt the palates of male
passerbys. Where they came from, no
one really knows. Perhaps they aren't
even students, but ethereal spirits sent
from heaven. It's enough to make you
forget all those jokes you heard when
you came to Stanford. ("Nine out of 10
California girls are pretty . . .") After all,
Playboy wasn't here in April.
The first weeks of spring are crucial
— in essence, a do-or-die period for the
school. One by one, students emerge
from their rooms sickly white and ane
mic, barely coherent after three months
of academic hell. They shade their eyes
from the sun and flinch as their skin
turns from yellow to orange to red.
It's time to head to Zott's, up Alpine
Road in yonder foothills. By foot, by car,
by bike.
It's time to kick off our shoes and lay
out in the sun. It's time to make a road
trip. Time to head for the beach, or to the
snow in Tahoe.
It's spring again. Time to enjoy Stan
ford. Worry about the consequences
later.

Ryan actually swam in Lake Lag. And
loved every minute of it.
