The Stanford Band was a crowd favorite in Providence

THE NCAA BASKETBALL tourna
ment brings along with it excite
ment, drama, emotion and school
pride, and the Stanford men's basketball
team definitely gave the fans who were
in Providence an effort to be proud of.
But I was actually proud of something
else in Providence — something I com
pletely did not expect, and that was the
Stanford Band.
As one of the hundred or so Stanford
fans who were in Providence cheering
the team on, I found that a major part of
the ambiance throughout the game was
the battle of the university bands. All of
the other seven schools had the tradi
tional pep band that played the same old

rally-type songs with some being more
stiff than ot hers. My initial thought was
the natural "uh-oh" when thinking of
how our band would be accepted in New
England. But believe it or not, the fans
in Providence appreciated the relaxed
style of the band and the contemporary
selection of music.
After the first game against Bradley
University, whose band actually played
selections from the '40s, our band's
uniqueness led the local newspaper to
run a front page article that really
emphasized the positive aspects about
the controlled irreverence.
On the day of the second round game,
I guess the fans in Providence had read

the article because before and through
out the game, the entire crowd began to
cheer for our band after every song. The
Tree and the dollies received standing
ovations, and the few times that the band
members went into the crowd to play,
the fans patted them on the back and
cheered wildly when they finished. Even
the hometown UMass band, who endless
ly played the CBS Sports NCAA basket
ball tournament theme, did not get the
cheer that the Stanford Band did.
I was as surprised to this reaction as
any other Stanford fan would be, but as
I look back at the tournament, I can
understand why the people of Provi
dence rallied behind them. Throughout

the two games, our band not only
showed that they were having fun but
also showed that they had class. Yes,
class. Sure, they put their trumpets on
their head when the opposing team's
band played some tired old fight song,
but other than that they really repre
sented the University well. From send
ing the team off from the hotel to lead
ing the Stanford crowd in cheers to the
Tree signing autographs in the crowd,
the Band, the Tree and dollies deserve a
lot of credit as they earned the right to
be the fan favorite in Providence.
