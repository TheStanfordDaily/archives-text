## Fretting to Freud: a letter to the über-analyst 
### 
In my favorite episode of M*A*S*H, a
recurring character, Dr. Sydney Freedman,
consoled himself from the havoc of the Kore
an War by writing a letter to his mentor, Dr.
Sigmund Freud — even though Freud was
already some 13 years decul at the time.
Not that my life much resembles actual
war right now, but the analogy to writing a
thesis while Ixtth being an liA and trying to
plan a future must hold for something. I
have thus chosen to make public this rather
cathartic and personal letter.
Sigmund,
My girlfriend's been reading "Mein
Kampf" again — this time in the original
Hebrew.
She said it was only for inspiration while
writing her thesis on Wagner, but I think
it's somewhat more endemic to our rela
tionship. Only last week she .asked if we
might hold off on sex for a while. I asked her
for how long and she muttered something
about when George Burns plays the Holly
wood Howl again.
No, things are not well.
The last few weeks have assured me that
my future is about as secure as a seat belt
made of string cheese. I have no definitive
plans; all my attempts to make any are
thwarted by surly receptionists and their

robotic response to any comment from the
jobless.
I call Conan O'Brian's assistant: "Hello,"
I say.
"Please send a resume and a cover let
ter," she replies.
"I only want an autograph," I say.
"Please send a resume and a cover let
ter," she replies.
Resume and cover letter, resume and
cover letter — is that all there is to do? Is
thus the only way to knock on the doors of
the elitely employed? Isn't there any other
hoop to jump through? At least one that
they respond to?
Even worse, I must waddle through this
bureaucratic murk while tryingto finish the
monstrosity of my honors thesis. I toil away
for hours on the thing. I fear it will overtake
me: Last night I dreamt an angel scolded me
for footnoting the Talmud. I asked him why
this was such a sin, he replied that God
much prefers endnotes.
If I do ever finish the monster it will be a
miracle. Oh, but even my faith in such
things wavers. In a fit of impudence I asked
of God to prove himself to me — as he did
for the prophet Gideon (Judges 6:37) — so
that I might know that my belief is not
entirely insipid. I said, "If you do exist, God,
do as you did for Gideon and by morning
moisten the fleece I have laid out under my
car. If by morning there is dew on the fleece

alone and it is dry all on the ground then I
shall know that you do indeed exist." The
next morning both the fleece and the
ground were dry but I had an immense cold
sore on my lower lip.
I seek solace from all this doubt in my
relationship, but I fear this too will follow
the karmic pattern of the last few weeks.
Perhaps you could help me find meaning in
this dream I had:
We were walking, my girlfriend and I,
along a beach, when we came upon the
corpse of a mermaid. She asked me to be cer
tain the thing was dead before we bothered
to start the Ixirbecue.
I refused on the grounds that the mer
maid was not kosher and should, therefore,
not be touched. My girlfriend then swal
lowed the mermaid whole, collapsed and
transformed into a snake.
Mother thinks my dream means I
haven't been eating well. But what does she
know? She still thinks it's Dad who fondles
her feet under the dinner table.
Father is well, of course. He has the con
stitution of an ox, though without quite so
many amendments. He is convinced that
graduate school is the direction I should fol
low. But who knows if that will even be im
option. 1 sent as a writing sample for my
MFA applications a copy of my sit-com pilot
— the one about a band of mutant super
hero / affirmative action activists, "The

Mai com X-men" — and I've heard nothing
yet.
So even the safehouse of grad school
looks as if it might refuse me its cushy
promise of the undergraduate hereafter.
Like I said, tilings are not well.
Even my column, once a pleasurable
place for sublimation, has become a source
of agony. My fellow students are forever
confusing me with the character I have cre
ated for myself in my little corner of our
school newspaper. Just this morning a
young woman standing in front of me at the
student cofTee house turned to me and said,
"Aren't you Michael Green? Quick, say
something funny about your penis."
Yes, my descent is becoming increasingly
apparent. And so 1 turn to you, friend
Freud, for advice. You are the only one who
would understand this post-adolescent
anomie. Tell me what to do? Where to go
when my life has no direction; when June
17 cries, "Judgment Day is nigh!"; when
every step 1 take to avoid the mediocrity of
the finance industry yields me another bout
with rejection?
I ask you because only you had the
answers. Sure our psychology department
rejects your precious genius, but they do so
only because they feel their own inadequacy
before you: Millions of dollars in funding
and they come up with nothing to rival your
insights.

And, Oh!, how they have caricatured
you! They have made you into an insane,
unstable addict who wanted to suckle his
mother well into his 70s. Ha — what do
they know? The cancer that plagued your
jaw would have prevented you from ever
wanting such a ludicrous thing.
It is unfortunate but students today only
honor you with facial hair. Yes, the goatee
has become such standard fare that one can
be purchased at Urban Outfitters — they
keep them discounted on a rack beside the
blue hair and unimpressed smirk.
Other than that, I am your sole defen
dant here. So please, sweet Siggy, grant me
the favor of your advice. I struggle to keep
alive my fantasies of being paid to write, but
it is not easy in the face of my growing stack
of rejection letters.
I look forward to your reply. Until then,
however, I promise to persist and to console
myself with what I take to be your warning
from your "Creative Writers and Day-
Dreaming:"
"As people grow up they cease to play,
and they seem to give up the yield of plea
sure which they gained from playing."

honor you with facial hair. Yes, the goatee
has become such standard fare that one can
be purchased at Urban Outfitters — they
keep them discounted on a rack beside the
blue hair and unimpressed smirk.
Other than that, I am your sole defen
dant here. So please, sweet Siggy, grant me
the favor of your advice. I struggle to keep
alive my fantasies of being paid to write, but
it is not easy in the face of my growing stack
of rejection letters.
I look forward to your reply. Until then,
however, I promise to persist and to console
myself with what I take to be your warning
from your "Creative Writers and Day-
Dreaming:"
"As people grow up they cease to play,
and they seem to give up the yield of plea
sure which they gained from playing."
A player still,
Michael
