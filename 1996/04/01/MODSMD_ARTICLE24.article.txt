## Baseball regains winning feeling No. 15 Cardinal sweeps Arizona, has now won six of its last seven 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
During spring break, most
Stanford students like to hit
the road, enjoy the sun and put
winter quarter behind them.
That's basically what the
No. 15 Cardinal baseball squad
did once final exams ended
March 22.
Playing three of four games
away from Sunken Diamond
last week, Stanford rebounded
from a win less series against
USC three weeks ago by taking
two out of three games from
California, then downing the
Nevada Wolfpack on Monday.
Senior A.J. Hineh said being
swept by USC served as a
wake-up call for the Cardinal.
"Anytime somebody comes
in here and sweeps a series in
your yard, it sends a message
that you're not invincible,"
Hinch said. "We've had high
preseason rankings, and a lot
of the players on our team are
highly touted — it's really easy
to be complacent, maybe not
work as hard as you should and

kind of get out of focus. [The
USC series] slapped us in the
face a little bit and showed us
there were other teams out
there that can beat us like
that."
Since that time, it has been
Stanford which has seemed in
vincible at times, and the
squad continued to roll this
weekend, enjoying a three
game sweep of visiting Ari
zona. It was the Cardinal's
first series sweep of the season.
Stanford chased the Wild
cats (20-19, 4-11 in the Pacific
10 Southern Division) out of
town yesterday, tying a season
high with 16 runs in a 16-3 tri
umph. In seven games since
the USC series, Stanford (20-
12, 8-7 in the Six-Pac) has av
eraged 10 runs and more than
13 hits per outing, while the
pitching staff has held the op
position to less than five runs
per game.
Yesterday, ("had Hutchin
son (3-1) won his third straight
decision, tossing his first com
plete game for Stanford. The
hard-throwing right hander
scattered nine hits, struck out
eight Wildcats and allowed just
one walk. Last week against
Nevada, Hutchinson went 7 1/3
innings, striking out 10. Against
Arizona, the freshman said his
energy increased in the later in
nings.
"I felt a lot better there in the
last few innings," Hutchinson
said. "I got a second wind and I
got into a rhythm. Not all my
pitches were working great
today, so I was trying to get some
ground balls and the defense just
came up big — they played flaw
less behind me, turning some key

double plays which I've got to
love. It was a good win for us, a
good sweep to build the morale of
the team."
As has been the case during
Stanford's recent stretch of six
wins in seven games, there were
several offensive heroes. Leadoff
man Joe Kilburg extended his
hitting streak to seven games
with a single and a double. Kil
burg has also driven in a run in
seven straight, adding two RBIs
Sunday. Filling in at first base
for Troy Kent, junior Luke
Quaccia banged out four hits,
scored twice and drove in two.
Perhaps most impressive,
however, was the performance of
the All-American Hinch. Hinch,
still in the designated hitter spot
after dislocating his throwing
shoulder six weeks ago, had a

weekend to remember. Hinch
had three hits in each of the
three games for a .643 weekend
average to go with a total of six
RBIs and five runs scored. Home
runs Friday night and Sunday
raised Hinch's team-leading
total to nine.
When asked to account for his
success against the Wildcats,
Hinch could not point to one spe
cific cause.
"I don't know how to explain
it, it was just a good weekend for
me personally as well as for the
team," Hinch said. "This week
end is huge for us because it gets
us back on the winning track and
puts us in position to at least
make a run in the second half of
the season."
After opening the Six-Pac
schedule 3-6, the Cardinal has

boosted its league record to 8-7
and moved into sole possession
of third place. Stanford sits two
games behind front-runners
USC and UCLA as the confer
ence heads into the second half
of its season.
Cardinal coach Mark Mar
quess looks for both the offense
and the pitching to continue to
be consistent as his squad pre
pares to challenge for the league
lead.
"This weekend, we got three
real good pitching performances
and I'm very pleased with that,"
Marquess said. "Arizona is a
very good hitting team. We're
going to need that for the second
half. We took a lot of batting
practice over the break and it's
obviously been good for some of
us, and I think the layoff was
good for us. We've been working
hard the past ten days and it's re
ally paying off."
In Saturday's thriller with
Arizona, the Cardinal needed
outstanding performances from
several players to pull out a 7-6
victory with a run in the bottom
of the ninth inning. After smack
ing his third hit of the day, Hinch
scored on a wild pitch to put
Stanford ahead 6-5 in the sev
enth. Senior Mario Iglesias re
lieved starter Jeff Austin in the
eighth inning, and promptly re
tired the first five Wildcats he
faced.
With the victory apparently in
the Cardinal's grasp, Iglesias got
into trouble, giving up a two
strike double to Kenny Corley,
then an RBI single to the next
hitter, Colin Porter. Arizona's
turn at the plate ended when
Omar Moraga lined hard to
Quaccia, who was holding Porter
on first base.
Stanford sent the top of the
lineup to the plate in the last of
the ninth. Kilburg led off the
frame with a fly ball to center for
the first out before freshman
center fielder Jody Gerut tapped
a check-swing in front of the
plate, beat out the throw and
found himself safe at first.

Hinch, the next Cardinal bats
man, brought the Sunken Dia
mond crowd to its feet, sending a
shot to deep center for out num
ber two.
With the crowd still buzzing
about Hinch's near game-win
ner, Schaeffer sealed the win for
Stanford, lining a double to
right-center. Gerut, who never
slowed down, scored the winning
run from first base.
"[Pitcher Ben White] kept
picking over to first base and I
was getting kind of anxious,"
Schaeffer said. "I told myself to
relax and see the ball come out of
his hand. He threw the ball right
down the middle and I didn't try
to do too much. I just put a good
hard swing on it."
Gerut said he was looking to
score as soon as he saw the ball
off Schaeffer's bat.
"I saw Schaeffer's hit going
over second base and I knew it
was in the gap," Gerut said. "I
knew I had to score, so I was
chugging as hard as I could —
coming around third, I thought I
was about to die."
Friday night's matchup with
Arizona provided little drama, as
Stanford used a five-run second
inning to build an 8-0 lead en
route to a 14-2 drubbing of the
Wildcats. Sophomore Kyle Pe
terson worked 7 2/3 innings, al
lowing eight hits, two unearned
runs and three walks while strik
ing out 11.
The Cardinal offensive attack
was led by a career-night from
Gerut, who went 3-for-4, scored
four runs and drove in six. Gerut
hit two of Stanford's four home
runs and added a two-run dou
ble. Hinch went deep for the
eighth time this year while Josh
Hochgesang hit his second.
"I'm feeling a little more com
fortable at the plate than I have
been before," said Gerut, who
had seven hits in the series and is
enjoying a seven-game hitting
streak. "I've been doing a lot of
work off the field with the coach
es and I'm getting the feel back
for hitting the ball."

Hinch, Kilburg and Dallimore
matched Gerut's three hits Sat
urday, as Stanford's total
reached 16.
In the four games played by
Stanford last week, the pitching
was solid and the Cardinal bats
were busy, as the team averaged
11.5 hits and eight-plus runs
during the stretch. Stanford de
feated Cal 14-7 and 7-6 before
falling 7-5 in the series finale.
The following day, the Cardinal
traveled to Nevada and downed
the No. 13-ranked Wolfpack, 7-3.
Leading the way was Stan
ford's leadoff hitter Kilburg,
who showed some muscle by
belting a home run in each of the
four contests. In his first 341 col
legiate at-bats, Kilburg hit just
one long ball before the unex
pected power surge.
In all, Kilburg went eight-for
-19 against Cal and Nevada, with
seven RBIs and nine runs scored
(Kilburg had just eight RBIs
through the season's first 25
games). For his efforts, he was
named the Pac-10 Offensive
Player of the Week last Tuesday.
While Kilburg's heroics
caught everyone's attention, his
teammates also feasted on the
pitching of the Golden Bears and
the Wolfpack. In three games,
Dallimore collected five hits in
11 at-bats, scoring five runs.
Carter went 6-for-17, scoring
three runs and driving in six.
The Cardinal hosts San Fran
cisco State tonight in a 7 p.m.
contest. Sunken Diamond will
feature two more night games
later in the week, as Stanford
opens a rare Thursday-Friday-
Saturday series with Arizona
State. Saturday's game is sched
uled for 1 p.m.
With the recent success of the
squad, Hinch and his teammates
are looking forward to adding to
Stanford's win total this week.
"We definitely had to earn our
spot to get back into the [Six-
Pac] race," Hinch said. "Hope
fully we can carry this momen
tum into the next weekend and
the weekend after that. I think

Sophomore Kyle Peterson winds up during a game against USC three weeks ago. After being swept by the Tro
jans, the Cardinal has rebounded to win six of its last seven games, including a weekend sweep of Arizona.
