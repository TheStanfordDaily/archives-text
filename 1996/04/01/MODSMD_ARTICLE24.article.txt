## Baseball regains winning feeling No. 15 Cardinal sweeps Arizona, has now won six of its last seven 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
During spring break, most
Stanford students like to hit
the road, enjoy the sun and put
winter quarter behind them.
That's basically what the
No. 15 Cardinal baseball squad
did once final exams ended
March 22.
Playing three of four games
away from Sunken Diamond
last week, Stanford rebounded
from a win less series against
USC three weeks ago by taking
two out of three games from
California, then downing the
Nevada Wolfpack on Monday.
Senior A.J. Hineh said being
swept by USC served as a
wake-up call for the Cardinal.
"Anytime somebody comes
in here and sweeps a series in
your yard, it sends a message
that you're not invincible,"
Hinch said. "We've had high
preseason rankings, and a lot
of the players on our team are
highly touted â€” it's really easy
to be complacent, maybe not
work as hard as you should and

kind of get out of focus. [The
USC series] slapped us in the
face a little bit and showed us
there were other teams out
there that can beat us like
that."
Since that time, it has been
Stanford which has seemed in
vincible at times, and the
squad continued to roll this
weekend, enjoying a three
game sweep of visiting Ari
zona. It was the Cardinal's
first series sweep of the season.
Stanford chased the Wild
cats (20-19, 4-11 in the Pacific
10 Southern Division) out of
town yesterday, tying a season
high with 16 runs in a 16-3 tri
umph. In seven games since
the USC series, Stanford (20-
12, 8-7 in the Six-Pac) has av
eraged 10 runs and more than
13 hits per outing, while the
pitching staff has held the op
position to less than five runs
per game.
Yesterday, ("had Hutchin

decision, tossing his first com
