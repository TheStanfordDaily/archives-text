# Stanford synchro second at NCAAs

### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
When the Ohio State syn
chronized swimming team came
to Stanford on Feb. 24 to take
part in the Stanford Invitation
al, few familiar with the sport
doubted that the meet would
offer a preview of this year's col
legiate championships. After
all, the two schools finished one
two at last year's champi
onships, and both squads fig
ured to compete for the title
again after returning a solid
core of swimmers from last sea
son.
Fortunately for Stanford,
things went as expected when
NCAAs kicked off March 22 at
Canisius College in Buffalo,
N.Y., with the two schools once
again going head-to-head for the
national title. Unfortunately,
however, the result was the
same as a month earlier, as the
Buckeyes totaled 97.0 points to
Stanford's 85.0 to take home
the title for 13th year in a row.
Senior Ail-American Bridget
Finn highlighted the Cardinal's
performance, taking home first
place in the senior figures event
and the solo competition. Stan
ford also took first place in the
team overall senior figures.
Perhaps most impressive,
however, the Cardinal earned
six of the fourteen All-American
awards granted at the NCAAs
for the first time since 1988.
Taking All-American honors
were senior Julie Davies (for the

fourth straight year), Finn
(third straight year), junior
Amy Markezich, junior Lesley
Riddervold, freshman Cather
ine Chen and freshman Vanessa
Shaw.
Davies, Finn, Markezich,
Riddervold, Chen, and Shaw
joined up with Julie Petho and
Maia Young in the team routine
event, earning the Cardinal a
second-place finish. Finn, Shaw
and Riddervold also took second
in the trio routine, while fresh
man Rachel Wong took second
in the junior figures.
Shaw and Riddervold also
combined for a third-place fin
ish in the duet, while Davies,
Markezich and Chen placed
fourth in the trio. Davies and
Chen took fifth in the duet.
Despite failing to loosen Ohio
State's stranglehold on the na
tional title, head coach Vickey
Weir's team enjoyed enormous
success this season. The Cardi
nal withstood the loss of four
swimmers from last year's na
tional runner-up squad, but still
managed to increase its point
total at NCAAs after welcoming
Shaw, Riddervold (both former
National Team members) and
Chen, a National Age Group
champion.
The Cardinal began the sea
son with a 108-45 victory over
Washington, then recorded a
100-42 win over California. But
those meets served as little
more than tune-ups for the Feb.
24 showdown with the Buckeyes
at DeGuerre Pool.
Despite sweeping the senior
and junior figure events behind
strong performances from Finn
and Wong, the Cardinal was un
able to hold off the 13-time de
fending national champions in
the day-long competition. Ohio
State All-American Becky Ja
sontek led her team to first
place finishes in the solo, duet,
trio and team routine events to
help the Buckeyes squeeze out a
95-90 victory.
The following weekend, the
Cardinal returned to Pacific 10
Conference competition in Tuc
son, Ariz., when the Stanford
women took part in the Pac-10
Conference Championships. As
expected, the Cardinal breezed
to a first-place finish, sweeping
both figure categories and all
four routine events and earning
a trip to the West Zone Champi
onships in San Diego on March
7-9, where the women officially
secured a berth at Collegiate
Nationals.
With a talented group of
young swimmers returning next
season, the Cardinal will be
looking to narrow the gap even
further on Ohio State next year.
All six All-Americans return,
with the exception of Julie
Davies, who is graduating. Brid
get Finn, though registered as a
senior, still has one season of
NCAA eligibility remaining.
