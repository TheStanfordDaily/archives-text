Charlotte, N.C. — After win
ning a school-record 23 consecu
tive contests, the Stanford <
women's basketball squad need
ed just two more for a third na
tional title. But the No. 5-ranked
Georgia Lady Bulldogs ended the
Cardinal's fifth Final Four run in
seven years before the largest
women's basketball crowd ever
to witness an NCAA tournament
game on Friday.
The Midwest region and SEC
regular-season champs posted an
86-76 victory over the third-

ranked Cardinal (29-3 overall,
18-0 Pacific 10 Conference) be
hind a stellar performance from

Naismith Player of the Yeai
Saudia Roundtree. The

senior point guard
chalked up 26

points, seven assists and six re
bounds while making all nine of
her free throw attempts.
Other Bulldogs struggled
from the line, allowing Stanford
to put together a dazzling run
that cut an 18-point deficit to five
late in the second half. Georgia
('2B-4, 10-1 SEC) missed eight
consecutive free throws and 12 of
13, with La'Keshia Frett, an 88-
percent shooter from the line,
clanging five straight. The Cardi
nal's 13-2 spurt over a four
minute stretch cut Georgia's lead
to 81-76 with one minute, 21 sec
onds remaining and brought
Stanford closer than it had been
since four minutes remained be
fore the break. But the Cardinal
failed to narrow the gap on three
straight possessions.
"We came up against a team that I
really thought was better," said in
terim head coach

Amy Tucker.

"I'm not
going to
ksay we
didn't

play
well."

Georgia's 86 points shattered
the previous best of 77 by a Car
dinal opponent, as did its 46 be
fore halftime. The two teams bat
tled back and forth early until the
Cardinal held its last lead, 20-19.
Then Bulldog center Tracy Hen
derson scored six straight fol
lowed by a three from guard
Kedra Holland. Stanford coun
tered Georgia's 15-2 spurt with a
9-2 run of its own, before
Roundtree took over with slash
ing penetration, effortless pull
ups, brilliant dishes and tena
cious defense.
"I'm not sure there was any
thing we could have done to com
bat their quickness," Tucker
said. "The thing we were hoping
for in Saudia's case was she
wouldn't shoot well."
Roundtree didn't feel she
played all that well. But with the
6-3 Frett driving the baseline and
posting 22 points and eight
boards, the Georgia post players
forced their Cardinal counter
parts into foul trouble. Sopho
mores Olympia Scott and Vanes
sa Nygaard both fouled out in the
final minute after posting dou

ble-doubles, and Georgia held on.
"We never felt that we were
not going to the national champi
onship game," Roundtree said.
"When they started coming back,
we never panicked."
Five Stanford players scored
in double figures, led by junior
forward Kate Starbird, Stan
ford's single-season scoring
record holder. But Starbird's 20
proved futile as the Bulldogs
grabbed 48 rebounds (a season
high for Cardinal opponents) and
made over half their shots, which
30 of Stanford's other 31 oppo
nents could not manage.
Stanford and Georgia formed
half of the identical Final Four
from the previous year, while
East region winner Tennessee
(31-4, 9-2 SEC) edged Mideast
champ Connecticut (34-4, 17-1
Big East) 88-83 in overtime in
the other game. The Lady Vols
claimed their fourth national
title in the second all-SEC affair
ever, defeating Georgia 83-65 in
the most lopsided title tilt in the
15-year history of the event.

Sophomore center Naomi Mulitauaopele takes it up strong during the women's 86-76 loss to Georgia last Friday in the semifinals of the
Women's Final Four.
The Cardinal claimed a berth
in the Final Four by winning the
West Regional over two other
SEC foes, Alabama (24-8, 7-4)

1 was just thinking
don't let there bean
offensive foul.'
—Naomi Mulitauaopele

and Auburn (23-9, 6-5). The No.
10 Crimson Tide and the Cardi
nal staged a classic battle in the
regional semifinal on Saturday,
March 23. Stanford pulled out a
78-76 victory behind a six-footer
from sophomore Naomi Muli
tauaopele with 2.7 seconds re
maining in overtime.
Mulitauaopele's hometown
heroics in Seattle's Hec Edmund
son Pavilion bailed the Cardinal
out of a stunning early exit. Stan
ford suffered through its most
prolonged offensive drought of
the season, going without a field
goal in an eight-plus minute
stretch in the second half. Dur
ing the dry spell, the No. 4-seed
ed Tide turned a 49-38 deficit
into a 56-50 advantage.
The Cardinal began to convert
but Alabama always had an an
swer, pushing the lead to 69-62
with under five minutes to play.
Just as the Alabama offense
began to stall, Stanford clawed
back, notching seven consecutive
points to even the score. The
teams remained tied at 72 when
junior point guard Jamila Wide
man traveled with 11.7 seconds
to play. After a timeout , Alabama
freshman Dominique Canty got a
good look from 10 feet out, but
the shot caromed off the glass
and then the rim just before the
buzzer, and Stanford entered its
first overtime since a 74-73 loss
to Tennessee in 1992.
Defense keyed the extra
frame, as Alabama went without
a field goal. Mulitauaopele scored
early to give Stanford its first

lead since the middle of the sec
ond half, and her soft jumper as
Alabama's Latrice Jones went to
the floor set the stage for Ail-
American Shalonda Enis' missed
shot from close range off a terrif
ic inbound pass.
"My heart was pounding,"
Mulitauaopele said. "I was just
thinking, 'Don't let there be an
offensive foul."'
Stanford had also outscored
Montana 4-2 in overtime in a
1987-88 postseason clash to earn
its first NCAA tournament win.
The combined six points and two
for the losing squad matched
tourney overtime record lows.
Five additional minutes were
not required in Monday's re
gional final against Auburn. The
Tigers, who had lost to Stanford
63-44 in the championship of
the Cardinal Classic on Dec. 20,
could not stop Stanford with
their 2-3 zone in the first half as
they fell behind 38-20. But two
quick threes before the half cut
the margin to 12, and another
Stanford offensive slumber at
the start of the second half cut
the lead all the way down to 41-
39. But behind Nygaard's game
high 23, Starbird's 17 (to go
with her game-high eight re
bounds) and Scott's 15, Stan
ford pulled away down the
stretch.
Nygaard's four three-pointers
moved her into a tie for the sin
gle-season three-point record at
Stanford. Against Georgia, she
broke Molly Goodenbour's 1993
standard for threes made and at
tempted by one each (75 in 193
tries).
The win sent co-head coach
Marianne Stanley to her 11th
Final Four (including AIAW) but
first in 11 years and marked the
first time co-head coaches led a
squad to the Final Four since
Leon Barmore and Sonja Hogg
took Louisiana Tech to consecu
tive trips in 1983 and 1984. Tuck
er felt relieved of the intense pres
sure she had felt since Tara Van-
Derveer agreed to take a year off
to coach the U.S. National Team.
"Well, I can't honestly say
that I thought we'd be in the
Final Four (at the start of the
year]," Tucker said. "I'm a very

conservative person so it doesn't
really matter what I say, it really
matters what they believe and
they believed."
Starbird was named the re
gional's most outstanding play
er, joining Mulitauaopele, Ny
gaard, Auburn's Laticia Morris
and Enis on the all-regional
squad.
Stanford advanced to its ninth
straight Sweet 16 by destroying
Colorado State (26-5, 12-2 West
ern Athletic Conference) 94-63.
The Cardinal bolted to a 40-16
lead after 12 minutes in their sec
ond-round battle on March 18.
Stanford ended up firing a sea
son-best 92 percent for the game
from the free-throw line and
again featured five double-figure
scorers, led by Starbird's 22.
Wideman added 12 and eight as
sists.
The Cardinal notched its
biggest tournament win in histo
ry in the opener on March 16,
crushing No. 16 seed Grambling
(21-7, 13-1 Southwestern Athlet
ic Conference) 82-43. The Lady
Tigers shot a West Region
record-low 22.4 percent from the
field, including 14.3 percent after
the half. The Cardinal led by 20
at the half and pulled away after
the break for the 39-point win.

We came up against
a team that I really
thought was better.
I'm not going to say
we didn't play well.'
—Amy Tucker

Starbird led all scorers for the
fourth straight game with 19 and
Nygaard added 17 with nine re
bounds.
Stanford loses swingman Bob
bie Kelsey and guard Amy
Wustefeld to graduation and
Stanley to a probable head coach
ing job. VanDerveer is expected
to return as head coach and will
join three new guards and possi
bly forward Kristin Folkl in
1996-97.

Charlotte, N.C. — After win
ning a school-record 23 consecu
tive contests, the Stanford <
women's basketball squad need
ed just two more for a third na
tional title. But the No. 5-ranked
Georgia Lady Bulldogs ended the
Cardinal's fifth Final Four run in
seven years before the largest
women's basketball crowd ever
to witness an NCAA tournament
game on Friday.
The Midwest region and SEC
regular-season champs posted an
86-76 victory over the third-

ranked Cardinal (29-3 overall,
18-0 Pacific 10 Conference) be
hind a stellar performance from

Naismith Player of the Yeai
Saudia Roundtree. The

senior point guard
chalked up 26

points, seven assists and six re
bounds while making all nine of
her free throw attempts.
Other Bulldogs struggled
from the line, allowing Stanford
to put together a dazzling run
that cut an 18-point deficit to five
late in the second half. Georgia
('2B-4, 10-1 SEC) missed eight
consecutive free throws and 12 of
13, with La'Keshia Frett, an 88-
percent shooter from the line,
clanging five straight. The Cardi
nal's 13-2 spurt over a four
minute stretch cut Georgia's lead
to 81-76 with one minute, 21 sec
onds remaining and brought
Stanford closer than it had been
since four minutes remained be
fore the break. But the Cardinal
failed to narrow the gap on three
straight possessions.
"We came up against a team that I
really thought was better," said in
terim head coach

Amy Tucker.

"I'm not
going to
ksay we
didn't

play
well."

Georgia's 86 points shattered
the previous best of 77 by a Car
dinal opponent, as did its 46 be
fore halftime. The two teams bat
tled back and forth early until the
Cardinal held its last lead, 20-19.
Then Bulldog center Tracy Hen
derson scored six straight fol
lowed by a three from guard
Kedra Holland. Stanford coun
tered Georgia's 15-2 spurt with a
9-2 run of its own, before
Roundtree took over with slash
ing penetration, effortless pull
ups, brilliant dishes and tena
cious defense.
"I'm not sure there was any
thing we could have done to com
bat their quickness," Tucker
said. "The thing we were hoping
for in Saudia's case was she
wouldn't shoot well."
Roundtree didn't feel she
played all that well. But with the
6-3 Frett driving the baseline and
posting 22 points and eight
boards, the Georgia post players
forced their Cardinal counter
parts into foul trouble. Sopho
mores Olympia Scott and Vanes
sa Nygaard both fouled out in the
final minute after posting dou

ble-doubles, and Georgia held on.
"We never felt that we were
not going to the national champi
onship game," Roundtree said.
"When they started coming back,
we never panicked."
Five Stanford players scored
in double figures, led by junior
forward Kate Starbird, Stan
ford's single-season scoring
record holder. But Starbird's 20
proved futile as the Bulldogs
grabbed 48 rebounds (a season
high for Cardinal opponents) and
made over half their shots, which
30 of Stanford's other 31 oppo
nents could not manage.
Stanford and Georgia formed
half of the identical Final Four
from the previous year, while
East region winner Tennessee
(31-4, 9-2 SEC) edged Mideast
champ Connecticut (34-4, 17-1
Big East) 88-83 in overtime in
the other game. The Lady Vols
claimed their fourth national
title in the second all-SEC affair
ever, defeating Georgia 83-65 in
the most lopsided title tilt in the
15-year history of the event.

Sophomore center Naomi Mulitauaopele takes it up strong during the women's 86-76 loss to Georgia last Friday in the semifinals of the
Women's Final Four.
The Cardinal claimed a berth
in the Final Four by winning the
West Regional over two other
SEC foes, Alabama (24-8, 7-4)

1 was just thinking
don't let there bean
offensive foul.'
—Naomi Mulitauaopele

and Auburn (23-9, 6-5). The No.
10 Crimson Tide and the Cardi
nal staged a classic battle in the
regional semifinal on Saturday,
March 23. Stanford pulled out a
78-76 victory behind a six-footer
from sophomore Naomi Muli
tauaopele with 2.7 seconds re
maining in overtime.
Mulitauaopele's hometown
heroics in Seattle's Hec Edmund
son Pavilion bailed the Cardinal
out of a stunning early exit. Stan
ford suffered through its most
prolonged offensive drought of
the season, going without a field
goal in an eight-plus minute
stretch in the second half. Dur
ing the dry spell, the No. 4-seed
ed Tide turned a 49-38 deficit
into a 56-50 advantage.
The Cardinal began to convert
but Alabama always had an an
swer, pushing the lead to 69-62
with under five minutes to play.
Just as the Alabama offense
began to stall, Stanford clawed
back, notching seven consecutive
points to even the score. The
teams remained tied at 72 when
junior point guard Jamila Wide
man traveled with 11.7 seconds
to play. After a timeout , Alabama
freshman Dominique Canty got a
good look from 10 feet out, but
the shot caromed off the glass
and then the rim just before the
buzzer, and Stanford entered its
first overtime since a 74-73 loss
to Tennessee in 1992.
Defense keyed the extra
frame, as Alabama went without
a field goal. Mulitauaopele scored
early to give Stanford its first

lead since the middle of the sec
ond half, and her soft jumper as
Alabama's Latrice Jones went to
the floor set the stage for Ail-
American Shalonda Enis' missed
shot from close range off a terrif
ic inbound pass.
"My heart was pounding,"
Mulitauaopele said. "I was just
thinking, 'Don't let there be an
offensive foul."'
Stanford had also outscored
Montana 4-2 in overtime in a
1987-88 postseason clash to earn
its first NCAA tournament win.
The combined six points and two
for the losing squad matched
tourney overtime record lows.
Five additional minutes were
not required in Monday's re
gional final against Auburn. The
Tigers, who had lost to Stanford
63-44 in the championship of
the Cardinal Classic on Dec. 20,
could not stop Stanford with
their 2-3 zone in the first half as
they fell behind 38-20. But two
quick threes before the half cut
the margin to 12, and another
Stanford offensive slumber at
the start of the second half cut
the lead all the way down to 41-
39. But behind Nygaard's game
high 23, Starbird's 17 (to go
with her game-high eight re
bounds) and Scott's 15, Stan
ford pulled away down the
stretch.
Nygaard's four three-pointers
moved her into a tie for the sin
gle-season three-point record at
Stanford. Against Georgia, she
broke Molly Goodenbour's 1993
standard for threes made and at
tempted by one each (75 in 193
tries).
The win sent co-head coach
Marianne Stanley to her 11th
Final Four (including AIAW) but
first in 11 years and marked the
first time co-head coaches led a
squad to the Final Four since
Leon Barmore and Sonja Hogg
took Louisiana Tech to consecu
tive trips in 1983 and 1984. Tuck
er felt relieved of the intense pres
sure she had felt since Tara Van-
Derveer agreed to take a year off
to coach the U.S. National Team.
"Well, I can't honestly say
that I thought we'd be in the
Final Four (at the start of the
year]," Tucker said. "I'm a very

conservative person so it doesn't
really matter what I say, it really
matters what they believe and
they believed."
Starbird was named the re
gional's most outstanding play
er, joining Mulitauaopele, Ny
gaard, Auburn's Laticia Morris
and Enis on the all-regional
squad.
Stanford advanced to its ninth
straight Sweet 16 by destroying
Colorado State (26-5, 12-2 West
ern Athletic Conference) 94-63.
The Cardinal bolted to a 40-16
lead after 12 minutes in their sec
ond-round battle on March 18.
Stanford ended up firing a sea
son-best 92 percent for the game
from the free-throw line and
again featured five double-figure
scorers, led by Starbird's 22.
Wideman added 12 and eight as
sists.
The Cardinal notched its
biggest tournament win in histo
ry in the opener on March 16,
crushing No. 16 seed Grambling
(21-7, 13-1 Southwestern Athlet
ic Conference) 82-43. The Lady
Tigers shot a West Region
record-low 22.4 percent from the
field, including 14.3 percent after
