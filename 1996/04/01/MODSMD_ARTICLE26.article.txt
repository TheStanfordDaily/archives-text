Charlotte, N.C. — After win
ning a school-record 23 consecu
tive contests, the Stanford <
women's basketball squad need
ed just two more for a third na
tional title. But the No. 5-ranked
Georgia Lady Bulldogs ended the
Cardinal's fifth Final Four run in
seven years before the largest
women's basketball crowd ever
to witness an NCAA tournament
game on Friday.
The Midwest region and SEC
regular-season champs posted an
86-76 victory over the third-

ranked Cardinal (29-3 overall,
18-0 Pacific 10 Conference) be
hind a stellar performance from

Naismith Player of the Yeai
Saudia Roundtree. The

senior point guard
chalked up 26

points, seven assists and six re
bounds while making all nine of
her free throw attempts.
Other Bulldogs struggled
from the line, allowing Stanford
to put together a dazzling run
that cut an 18-point deficit to five
late in the second half. Georgia
('2B-4, 10-1 SEC) missed eight
consecutive free throws and 12 of
13, with La'Keshia Frett, an 88-
percent shooter from the line,
clanging five straight. The Cardi
nal's 13-2 spurt over a four
minute stretch cut Georgia's lead
to 81-76 with one minute, 21 sec
onds remaining and brought
Stanford closer than it had been
since four minutes remained be
fore the break. But the Cardinal
failed to narrow the gap on three
straight possessions.
"We came up against a team that I
really thought was better," said in
terim head coach

Amy Tucker.

"I'm not
going to
ksay we
didn't

play
well."

Georgia's 86 points shattered
the previous best of 77 by a Car
dinal opponent, as did its 46 be
fore halftime. The two teams bat
tled back and forth early until the
Cardinal held its last lead, 20-19.
Then Bulldog center Tracy Hen
derson scored six straight fol
lowed by a three from guard
Kedra Holland. Stanford coun
tered Georgia's 15-2 spurt with a
9-2 run of its own, before
Roundtree took over with slash
ing penetration, effortless pull
ups, brilliant dishes and tena
cious defense.
"I'm not sure there was any
thing we could have done to com
bat their quickness," Tucker
said. "The thing we were hoping
for in Saudia's case was she
wouldn't shoot well."
Roundtree didn't feel she
played all that well. But with the
6-3 Frett driving the baseline and
posting 22 points and eight
boards, the Georgia post players
forced their Cardinal counter
parts into foul trouble. Sopho
mores Olympia Scott and Vanes
sa Nygaard both fouled out in the
final minute after posting dou

ble-doubles, and Georgia held on.
"We never felt that we were
not going to the national champi
onship game," Roundtree said.
"When they started coming back,
we never panicked."
Five Stanford players scored
in double figures, led by junior
forward Kate Starbird, Stan
ford's single-season scoring
record holder. But Starbird's 20
proved futile as the Bulldogs
grabbed 48 rebounds (a season
high for Cardinal opponents) and
made over half their shots, which
30 of Stanford's other 31 oppo
nents could not manage.
Stanford and Georgia formed
half of the identical Final Four
from the previous year, while
East region winner Tennessee
(31-4, 9-2 SEC) edged Mideast
champ Connecticut (34-4, 17-1
Big East) 88-83 in overtime in
the other game. The Lady Vols
claimed their fourth national
title in the second all-SEC affair
ever, defeating Georgia 83-65 in
the most lopsided title tilt in the
15-year history of the event.
