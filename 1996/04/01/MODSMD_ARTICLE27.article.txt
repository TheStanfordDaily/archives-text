# Cardinal bows out of Big Dance with near-upset of UMass
## Last-minute rally not enough as Stanford's season ends in second round of NCAA tourney 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
One year removed from an embarrass
ing loss to Massachusetts in the NCAA
tournament, Stanford was one shot away
from serving the biggest dish of crow the
No. 1 team in the country had seen all year.
But like they had done so many times
earlier this year, the Minutemen (35-2)
made the clutch offensive and defensive
plays to close out a 79-74 win in the second
round of the East Regional in Providence,
R. 1., on March 16.
Stanford (20-9) got within one at 75-74
on a Dion Cross three-pointer, but Massa
chusetts answered with a 15-footer by
Donta Bright with 32 seconds left in the
game. Bright shook free because Stan
ford's attention was focused on All-Ameri
can center Marcus Camby on the low post.
Coming out of a timeout after Bright's
shot, the Cardinal was looking for Cross
for another three but head coach Mike
Montgomery knew that his sharpshooter
won Id not get a clean look. So the play went
to the second option, freshman Peter
Sauer fading back on the left wing to the
three-point line.
"We'd been running that play a lot down
the stretch for 10-15 footers, but we need-

Ed the three," Sauer said. "That made it a
lot harder — a fade-away 20-footer."
Sauer got a clean look at the basket but
shot off-balance. The trajectory of the shot
reflected its hurried nature, as the ball ric
ocheted hard off the glass and rim, falling
into Camby's hands.
Camby went on to sink both ends of a
one-and-one to ice the game and a berth in
the Sweet Sixteen. Massachusetts eventu
ally advanced to the Final Four in East
Rutherford, N.J., where the Minutemen
were ousted by Kentucky 81-74 on Satur
day.
"One missed shot and one made shot
and we're talking about going to the 16 and
beating the No. 1 seed in the country,"
Montgomery said. "The next step is not
needing that shot."
While the idea of leaving a season-decid
ing shot to the hands of a freshman might
seem misguided, up until that point Sauer
had been playing one of his best games of
the year. Before the shot, he was 5-of-6
from the field, including a clutch three
pointer with 1 minute, 53 seconds left that
cut the UMass lead to 73-71.
He also scored six straight points earlier
in the second half when the Minutemen
