# Cardinal bows out of Big Dance with near-upset of UMass
## Last-minute rally not enough as Stanford's season ends in second round of NCAA tourney 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
One year removed from an embarrass
ing loss to Massachusetts in the NCAA
tournament, Stanford was one shot away
from serving the biggest dish of crow the
No. 1 team in the country had seen all year.
But like they had done so many times
earlier this year, the Minutemen (35-2)
made the clutch offensive and defensive
plays to close out a 79-74 win in the second
round of the East Regional in Providence,
R. 1., on March 16.
Stanford (20-9) got within one at 75-74
on a Dion Cross three-pointer, but Massa
chusetts answered with a 15-footer by
Donta Bright with 32 seconds left in the
game. Bright shook free because Stan
ford's attention was focused on All-Ameri
can center Marcus Camby on the low post.
Coming out of a timeout after Bright's
shot, the Cardinal was looking for Cross
for another three but head coach Mike
Montgomery knew that his sharpshooter
won Id not get a clean look. So the play went
to the second option, freshman Peter
Sauer fading back on the left wing to the
three-point line.
"We'd been running that play a lot down
the stretch for 10-15 footers, but we need-

Ed the three," Sauer said. "That made it a
lot harder — a fade-away 20-footer."
Sauer got a clean look at the basket but
shot off-balance. The trajectory of the shot
reflected its hurried nature, as the ball ric
ocheted hard off the glass and rim, falling
into Camby's hands.
Camby went on to sink both ends of a
one-and-one to ice the game and a berth in
the Sweet Sixteen. Massachusetts eventu
ally advanced to the Final Four in East
Rutherford, N.J., where the Minutemen
were ousted by Kentucky 81-74 on Satur
day.
"One missed shot and one made shot
and we're talking about going to the 16 and
beating the No. 1 seed in the country,"
Montgomery said. "The next step is not
needing that shot."
While the idea of leaving a season-decid
ing shot to the hands of a freshman might
seem misguided, up until that point Sauer
had been playing one of his best games of
the year. Before the shot, he was 5-of-6
from the field, including a clutch three
pointer with 1 minute, 53 seconds left that
cut the UMass lead to 73-71.
He also scored six straight points earlier
in the second half when the Minutemen

were threatening to pull away,
finishing with 11 to go along with
a team-high seven rebounds.
Sauer was in the final 13 minutes

because Stanford was having
trouble matching up against
Massachusetts' size with the 6-6
Bright and the 6-7 Dana Dingle.
"The veterans all acknowl
edged that I played hard, and
that's how we look at it in our
program," Sauersaid. "Ifyou play
hard off the bench, you'll get no

words from the coach for not hav
ing shots fall."
While Sauer came on strong in
the second half, it was Brevin
Knight who controlled the tempo
of the game. His 27 points led all
scorers and he routinely made any
defender unlucky enough to
square up against him look like
his feet were buried in cement. He
also added nine assists and only
two turnovers.
The start of the game looked
startlingly familiar to last year's
75-53 shellacking, as Massachu
setts jumped ahead 14-5 after five
minutes of play by pounding the
offensive boards. Early on, the
Minutemen held a 10-1 rebound
ing advantage.
"I was leery of the start of the
game, because from a confidence
standpoint we had to do some
things and have some success to
get some confidence," Mont
gomery said. "There had to be
maybe in the back of their minds
'wow, I remember what happened
last year.' But we got it turned
around, because we had been
there before."
Massachusetts went scoreless
over the next six minutes, allow
ing Stanford to cut it to 14-11.
Later the Cardinal pulled ahead
26-22 with 4:16 left in the half.
Massachusetts responded by
scoring nine of the final 13 points
of the half to go into halftime with
a 33-31 lead. Stanford had excep
tional ball handling to thank for
being so close, as the Cardinal had
only two turnovers at halftime.
"You don't expect Massachu
setts to play poorly," Montgomery
said. "We knew we had to per
form. Brevin was very good with
the ball."
With Camby saddled with
three fouls, Calipari started back
up Tyrone Weeks in the second
half to avoid a quick fourth on
Camby. Massachusetts didn't
miss a beat, scoring on eight of its
first nine possessions after half
time. That built a double-digit
Minuteman lead and it seemed

like Stanford was about to fold its
tent.
"It looked like we were going to
run away but they did not stop,
and Brevin Knight was unbeliev
able," Calipari said. "We had no
answers."
The lead went as high as 13
with seven minutes to play. The
Cardinal rally began with a
Knight three-pointer, followed by
Sauer's three straight buckets.
Stanford went on an 11-4 run to
close to 71-68, thanks in part to
Massachusetts guard Carmelo
Travieso missing two of three free
throws after being fouled on a
three-point attempt.
But the miracle comeback
would not be, and the No. 1 team
in the country avoided losing for
only the second time all season.
"We played well, but guess
what — they played well, too,"
Calipari said. "We're not the kind
cf team that beats people by 50.
We're a grind-it-out throwback to
yesteryear on how we play basket
ball."
For the game, Massachusetts
shot 54 percent from the floor
compared to Stanford's 42 per
cent. Despite the early rebound
advantage, the Minutemen ended
up out-rebounding Stanford only
35-31.
The biggest difference for
Massachusetts was Camby's pres
ence on both ends of the court. De
spite playing with foul trouble,
the junior center scored 20 points
(on 9-for-15 shooting), grabbed
eight rebounds and blocked seven
shots. Stanford felt the absence of
sophomore center Tim Young in
side, as Camby and Weeks (5-for
6, 10 points) converted almost
every time t hey posted up.
"UMass has a luxury [in
Camby|," Cross said. "They prob
ably don't have to work as hard on
defense because he's back there,
and offensively he causes so many
problems. Tim is height, and we
didn't have that. He would have
given him a lot of trouble."
Last year, Young outplayed

Camby, collecting 13 points, nine
rebounds and two blocks to
Camby's 10 points, three re
bounds and five blocks.
The first round saw Stanford
take out all its frustrations of re
ceiving the ninth seed in the re
gion. Led by Knight's 26 points,
the Cardinal stayed just enough
ahead of eighth-seeded Bradley to
keep the game from getting tense,
winning 66-58.
Stanford used an 8-0 run late
in the first half to push its lead to
15 but saw Bradley score the last
seven points of the half to cut the
lead to 33-25.
"We got off to a really good
start and got out early. I think in
some respects that hurt us be
cause we did lose our concentra
tion right before the half," Mont
gomery said. "We were running
well, moving the ball and creating
shots."
In the second half, Stanford's
lead bounced from seven to 14
points until Bradley cut it to five
with 6:58 left in the game on one
of Anthony Parker's eight three
pointers. The lead was again cut
to five at the 1:51 mark, but
Knight answered with four
straight points to seal the game.
Parker, the Missouri Valley
Player-of-the-Year, scored a ca
reer-high 34 points on 11-for-21
shooting (8-for-10 from three
point range) and also grabbed 10
rebounds.
"You won't find a more out
standing performance in this en
tire tournament than what An
thony Parker had today," said
Bradley head coach Jim Molinari.
Taking Parker out of the
Braves' offense, the rest of the
team shot 11-for-38 (29 percent)
and no player scored more than
eight points.
"I think we played a little fear
ful," Molinari said. "You have to
step up and make jump shots, be
cause Stanford won't let you get
in the paint."
Poppink dominated inside,
grabbing a career-high 17 re

bounds while scoring 10 points —
the 16th double-double of his ca
reer.
Cross added 16 points (4-for-7
from three-point range), moving
into third place on the career scor
ing list at Stanford. His 32 points
over the weekend give him 1,635
in his four-year career, moving
him past Kimberly Belton (1615).
Todd Lichti (2336) and Adam
Keefe (2319) top the all-time list.
For the first time all year,
Stanford's bench produced no
points. However, with Bradley's
Deon Jackson and Dwayne
Punches in a funk all game and
point guard Billy Wright having
no success slowing down Knight,
the Stanford starters controlled
the game.
With the season over, all eyes
look to next year and the return of
Young to the lineup. Add junior
transfer Peter Van Elswyk (6-9)
and freshman Mark Madsen (6-9)
to Sauer and Mark Seaton (6-10)
and suddenly Stanford has more
size than anyone in the confer
ence.
"We're going to be a way differ
ent team next year, there's no
question about it," Montgomery
said. "We're going to be bigger,
yet we still have a point guard.
But the experience, the knowing
how to win, the physical and men
tal toughness, I have no idea if
that's there."
Seniors Cross, Poppink, Dar
ren Allaway and David Harbour
combined to play in 451 games for
Stanford, starting 279. Cross and
Allaway were freshmen on the
Cardinal squad that went 7-23, a
season that both Poppink and
Harbour missed due to injury.
"They've been through the
whole doggone thing — the NIT,
the NCAA, they are the first
group to win in the NCAAs, the
first to win at Arizona. Poppink
and Harbour are fifth-year guys
— half my time at Stanford
they've been here," Montgomery
said. "I'm just real proud of
them."
