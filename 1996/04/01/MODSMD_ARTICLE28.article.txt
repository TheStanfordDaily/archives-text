# Knight shines in tournament spotlight
## 
### Greg Collins Senior staff writer 
While Stanford may fade
from the lips of basketball
pundits in the next few
months after its second-round
loss to UMass in the NCAA
tournament, Brevin Knight
cemented his name in the
hoops cognoscenti with two of
the most dominant games in
his three-year career.
The point guard ended his
junior year by staking a claim
to preseason All-American
honors next season with his
performances against Bradley
and Massachusetts. Knight
averaged 26.5 points, 6.5 as
sists, 4.5 rebounds and two
steals in the tournament
while playing 37.5 minutes a
game. He made 16 of 33 field
goal attempts and 20 of his 23
free throws.
Throughout most of the
regular season, Knight saw
his job as working the ball
around the Cardinal offensive
set as much as possible to set

up high percentage shots for
others — usually Dion Cross's
outside game and Andy Pop
pink's post moves.
"A lot of times, when
Brevin penetrates he's going
in with the idea of kicking it
out," head coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "He doesn't have
to score the ball for us to be
successful, assuming that we
can run our offense and get
people good shots."
But come tournament time,
when it's one loss and out,
Knight took over as the focal
point of the offense. With Pop
pink shooting 5-for-25 in the
two tournament games and
Cross constantly hounded by
the opponent's best defender,
the offensive pressure fell on
Knight.
The most impressive part of
Knight's performance was the
fact that he flourished while
still running the offense and
setting up teammates, as re
flected by his 6.5 assists per
game. Many on hand felt that
total was low — Knight normal
ly averages closer to double fig
ures in assists.
"You have other guys who are
like two-guards who bring the
ball up the floor, but as far as
setting up teammates and going
to the basket, I don't see anyone
quicker or better on defense
than him," said teammate Peter
Sauer.
In the two tournament
games, Knight faced two dis
tinct types of defensive point
guards. Bradley's Billy Wright,
a 5-foot-10 water bug, was hop
ing to out-quick Knight while
Massachusetts' Edgar Padilla,
who stands at 6-2, likes to use
his strong hands and size to
force steals.
They would both learn that
neither method works against
Knight, a bottle of lightning in
cardinal red.
Knight was especially suc
cessful breaking down Wright
and Padilla off the dribble. At
one point in the first half against
Bradley, he blew by Wright for a
lay-up, nailed a 17-footer and
then took it to the hole again for
a jump-stop reverse lay-up.
Were it not for Marcus
Camby roaming the middle,
Knight probably would have
topped his career-high of 31
points against UMass. In the
second half, Camby swatted
three attempts by Knight after

he had beaten his defender on
the perimeter.
After the third block, Camby
and Knight exchanged smirks
and a few words.
"I just gave him a little stare
to let him know I was going to be
here the rest of the afternoon so
take it to the perimeter," Camby
said.
But rather than flinch at the
prospect of getting a Rawlings
imprint on his forehead every
time he went to the hole, Knight
went on to score 10 points and to
assist on five baskets (for 12
points) down the stretch in

'Brevin just has too
much. He goes be
tween his own legs
and then your legs and
then through you and
up and under you. We
tried three different
ways to handle that
screen off the ball and
none of them worked.'

Stanford's near-miracle come
back.
"I told him that I was going to
keep coming — either he had to
block every one or I was going to
score," Knight said.
Much of the difficulty Massa

chusetts had covering Knight
stemmed from Calipari's inabil
ity to come up with a way to han
dle the screens Stanford kept
setting for Knight on the
perimeter.
"We had talked about the fact
that if we set screens, I don't
care how good defensively they
are, they can't just go through
people," Montgomery said. "It's
going to open us up."
Said Calipari: "Brevin just
has too much stuff. He goes be
tween his own legs and then
your legs and then through you
and up and under you. We tried
three different ways to handle
that screen off the ball and none
of them worked."
Bradley coach Jim Molinari
had the same problem as Cali
pari — one player can't handle
him alone, and Knight is so
quick and slippery that a double
team often leaves two players in
the dust rather than one after
Knight makes his move.
"He's a great player and he
took it to us," Molinari said.
"Our defense kept getting split."
Wright, who was elected to
the Missouri Valley All-Defen
sive team three years in a row,
said Knight was the quickest
guard he faced all year. "He's a
complete point guard. He kind of
lulls you to sleep."
Along with scoring 26.5
points a game, Knight kept the
team under control. Stanford
tied a previous season best with
only eight turnovers against
Bradley, then did himself one
better against Massachusetts,
turning it over only seven times.
