While Stanford may fade
from the lips of basketball

pink shooting 5-for-25 in the
two tournament games and
Cross constantly hounded by
the opponent's best defender,
the offensive pressure fell on
Knight.
The most impressive part of
Knight's performance was the
fact that he flourished while
still running the offense and
setting up teammates, as re
flected by his 6.5 assists per
