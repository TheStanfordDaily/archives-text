# Law professor earns spot in state Senate
## Sher wins close race 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Law Prof. Emeritus and De
mocrat Byron Sher won a close
race in a special election on Tues
day, edging Republican Patrick
Shannon by just under 5,000
votes for the 11th District seat in
the state Senate.
Sher garnered 54 percent of
the votes, or 64,443 ballots, while
his opponent Shannon received
46 percent, or 59,624 votes.
Before the election, Sher rep
resented the 21st District in the
state Assembly, where he served
for the past 16 years. His district
covered Stanford, Palo Alto and
other parts of Santa Clara Coun
ty as well as San Mateo County.
In Sher's new position, which
he was sworn into Thursday, he
will serve most of San Mateo
County and a considerable
amount of Santa Clara County,
including Stanford and Palo Alto.
Because of Proposition 140,
which was passed in 1990 and im
poses term limits on state offi
cials, Sher would have had to va
cate his seat in the Assembly in

November.
"I'm delighted to be able to
continue to serve in the legisla
ture and move over to the sen
ate," Sher said at his Los Altos
campaign headquarters Tuesday
night. "The balance in the senate
is what's really important here.
We're really at a point where
there's a danger in California
moving over to the ultra-conserv
ative vote."
With Sher's victory, the De
mocrats now hold a 22-to-16 ad
vantage over the Republicans in
the state Senate, with indepen
dents making up the remaining
two seats. The election also
marks the first time in 12 years
that a Democrat has held the
11th District seat.
The special election was called
by Gov. Pete Wilson to fill the seat
vacated by Stanford Law Prof,
and Republican Tom Campbell,
who in December won a seat in
the U.S. House of Representa
tives. Campbell on Tuesday won
the Republican nomination for
his House seat and will face De-

mocrat Dick Lane in November
when he is up for re-election.
Despite Tuesday's victory, Sher
will have to run again Nov. 5 in
order to remain in his seat. Shan
non has already announced that he
will again challenge Sher for the
legislative position.
Sher emphasized that he won by
running a grassroots campaign.
"This is a campaign that took t he
word out to the people and out on
the streets. That's what we had in
our campaign that the opposition
didn't have. They tried to do it sim
ply with money and mail, but grass

roots does work."
Sher's campaign manager Jim
Thurber estimated that between
700 and 900 unpaid volunteers
worked at Sher's campaign head
quarters in Los Altos and at auxil
iary headquarters in San Jose and
Redwood City.
"IThe campaign] was run pretty
much by the citizens of this com
munity, unpaid volunteers who
came in here everyday . . . tele
phoned, stuffed envelopes, put on
stamps . . . did all that work rather
than having it done professionally,"
Thurber said.
Known by many for his efforts
to protect the environment, Sher
served as chair of the Natural Re
sources Committee in the Assem
bly. He also garnered attention last

year when lie introduced a bill to
change California's hate crime sta
tus. The bill would have broadened
the legal definition of a hate crime
in order to include actions against
property owned by entities, such
as Stanford, and actions directed
against groups. The bill eventually
died in the Assembly.
Commenting on his victory,
Sher said, "For me, the most grati
fying thing about this is that it
shows that California is still going
to stay a progressive state."
Thurber added that he thought
Sher's victory showed that the vot
ers were still willing to bring back
somebody with experience. "The
debates and so forth indicated that
Byron knew the background, knew
where he was coming from, knew

where the district was coming
from."
Martin Gorfinkel, one of the
volunteers who worked on Sher's
campaign, explained why so
many volunteers came out in sup
port. "The only reason . . . for our
effort is that we have a hell of a
fine candidate. We've got some
body who is exemplary among
members of the California legis
lature."
Sher's seat in the Assembly will
now be led vacant until the Novem
ber elections.

Anna Eshoo, the congresswoman
who serves the Stanford area, easi
ly won the Democratic nomination
and will face Republican Ben Brink
in November.
