# Law professor earns spot in state Senate
## Sher wins close race 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Law Prof. Emeritus and De
mocrat Byron Sher won a close
race in a special election on Tues
day, edging Republican Patrick
Shannon by just under 5,000
votes for the 11th District seat in
the state Senate.
Sher garnered 54 percent of
the votes, or 64,443 ballots, while
his opponent Shannon received
46 percent, or 59,624 votes.
Before the election, Sher rep
resented the 21st District in the
state Assembly, where he served
for the past 16 years. His district
covered Stanford, Palo Alto and
other parts of Santa Clara Coun

In Sher's new position, which

will serve most of San Mateo
County and a considerable

including Stanford and Palo Alto.
Because of Proposition 140,
which was passed in 1990 and im
poses term limits on state offi

November.
"I'm delighted to be able to
continue to serve in the legisla
ture and move over to the sen

campaign headquarters Tuesday
night. "The balance in the senate
is what's really important here.
We're really at a point where
there's a danger in California
moving over to the ultra-conserv
ative vote."
With Sher's victory, the De
mocrats now hold a 22-to-16 ad
vantage over the Republicans in
the state Senate, with indepen
dents making up the remaining
two seats. The election also
marks the first time in 12 years
that a Democrat has held the
11th District seat.
The special election was called
by Gov. Pete Wilson to fill the seat
vacated by Stanford Law Prof,
and Republican Tom Campbell,
who in December won a seat in
the U.S. House of Representa
tives. Campbell on Tuesday won
the Republican nomination for
his House seat and will face De-
