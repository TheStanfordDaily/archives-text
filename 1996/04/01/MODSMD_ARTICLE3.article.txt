# 2,580 students admitted to the Farm
## Acceptance rate drops 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial Staff 
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions mailed 2,580 admis
sion packages to high school se
niors across the country on Fri
day, a decline from last year due to
the University's new early deci
sion programs.
Thirty-five percent of the Class
of 2000 was already accepted
through the early decision process,
so only 14 percent of regular ad
mission applicants were accepted.
The overall admit rate dropped
from approximately 19 percent
last year to 15.8 percent this year.
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid James
Montoya said the selection
process was more challenging this
year, mostly because in the regu
lar admissions round, only one out
of seven students was accepted
compared to previous years' one
out of five.
"Bv academic measures, we

had a stronger
applicant pool
than before, and
the extracurricu
lar profiles were
exceptional,"
said Montoya.
"Not only did we
have trouble se
lecting who
would be admit-

ted, but we had trouble deciding
who would be on the wait list.
"We found ourselves facing a
situation where we were wait list
ing and denying students who
would have every expectation that
they would be admitted."
Applications increased from
last year by almost 1,000 to 16,360
students, but 328 fewer students
than last year were admitted. An
entering class of 1,600 is antici
pated.
Montoya said another complex
ity of the process was dealing with

the logistics — being careful
which letters were sent out and
when, dealing with financial aid
and scheduling alumni gather
ings.
"The challenge was for us deal
ing with a grueling selection
process and dealing with the com
plexity of three rounds of admis
sion instead of one," Montoya
said.
Montoya said he had been con
cerned about sending a false mes
sage to high school students that
the only way of gaining admission
was through early decision.
"We want students to under
stand that if they are not ready to
make a decision early in their se
nior year, then they still have an
opportunity to get in to Stanford
during the regular admission,"
said Montoya. "I feel we succeeded
in being incredibly responsible to
this goal and responsive to the
need of the high school students
and counselors.
"Looking over our statistics

and the high quality of both the
early pool and the regular pool,
and at the percentage rates for
early acceptance and regular ad
mission, I think we met that chal
lenge."
Montoya said it was difficult to
judge what the percentage yield
would be in the regular applicant
pool and said he was guessing it
would be in the high 50s to low 60s.
"You could say that the rate
would be lower because we had ad
mitted 35 percent of the class —
but also, we didn't know what the
impact of other schools like Yale
and Princeton switching to early
decision programs, or Harvard's
decision to admit 1,000 students
through their early action pro
gram," Montoya said.
He added that staff wanted to
be sensitive to the needs of the
University and not put it in the sit
uation of having too large of a
freshman class. "That has an im
pact on housing, and we ap
proached this in a cautious way.
We are doing our best to be sensi
tive to the residence program and
not bring in too large of a class,"
Montoya said.
"The strength of our wait list is

extraordinary — just look at the
high percentage of kids we denied
— kids with straight A's we denied
— anyone of them would be terrific
as Stanford student," Montoya
said.

The strength of our
wait list is extraordi
nary — just look at the
high percentage of
kids we denied — kids
with straight A's we
denied — anyone of
them would be terrific
as Stanford student.'
— James Montoya

Ninety percent of admitted
students are in the top tenth of
their class, and almost half the
students have straight A's. More
than half of the applicants with
4.0 grade point averages and 60
percent of the applicants with a

combined score of 1500 on the
SATI were either denied admis
sion or placed on the wait list.
"I anticipate many more calls
and more correspondence from
disappointed and angry parents
and counselors as result of our low
admit rate," Montoya said. "Many
of the students who would have
gained admission have found
themselves on the waiting list."
There is wide geographical dis
tribution among the prospective
freshman as well. Applicants from
all 50 states and 45 countries were
offered admission. California had
the highest representation at 38.2
percent. Texas was second at 5.6
percent, followed by New York at
5.2 percent.
Other states well represented
among admitted students are Illi
nois at 3.5 percent, Washington at
3.1 percent and Massachusetts at
2.7 percent.
Ethnically, the admitted group
is 51.2 percent white, 9.3 percent
African-American, 23 percent
Asian-American, 9.6 percent His
panic and 1.4 percent Native
American. International students
make up almost 5 percent of the
accepted pool.
