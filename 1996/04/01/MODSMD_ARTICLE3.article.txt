# 2,580 students admitted to the Farm
## Acceptance rate drops 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial Staff 
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions mailed 2,580 admis
sion packages to high school se
niors across the country on Fri
day, a decline from last year due to
the University's new early deci
sion programs.
Thirty-five percent of the Class
of 2000 was already accepted
through the early decision process,
so only 14 percent of regular ad
mission applicants were accepted.
The overall admit rate dropped
from approximately 19 percent
last year to 15.8 percent this year.
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid James
Montoya said the selection
process was more challenging this
year, mostly because in the regu
lar admissions round, only one out
of seven students was accepted
compared to previous years' one
out of five.
"Bv academic measures, we

had a stronger
applicant pool
than before, and
the extracurricu
lar profiles were
exceptional,"
said Montoya.
"Not only did we
have trouble se
lecting who
would be admit-

ted, but we had trouble deciding
who would be on the wait list.
"We found ourselves facing a
situation where we were wait list
ing and denying students who
would have every expectation that
they would be admitted."
Applications increased from
last year by almost 1,000 to 16,360
students, but 328 fewer students
than last year were admitted. An
entering class of 1,600 is antici
pated.
