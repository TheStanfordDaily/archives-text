# Law School applications decline
## 
### Timothy Kiefer Contributing writer 
Applications for admission to the Law
School declined 3.5 percent this year compared
to last, paralleling a decline in applications at
other top-ranked law schools.
There were 4,149 applications for admission
for the class entering this fall, compared with
4,298 applications last year.
Applications hit a peak of 6,006 in 1991 and
have tumbled 30.9 percent in the five years
since.
Faye Deal, director of admissions for the
Law School, said the decline in applications will
not have a negative impact on the school.
"The drop in application volume is not at the
point to worry about it," Deal said. "We have
more than enough qualified applicants."
Despite the drop in applicants, the Law
School is expected to reject nearly 90 percent of
the applications it received this year. The Law
School typically admits 450 students to produce
an entering class of 180.
Deal said many college seniors may be choos-

ing to get work experience first in an effort to
improve their future odds of acceptance.
"The group that isn't applying are people
straight out of college with good numbers who
would be fence-sitters for us," she said.
The Law School's peer institutions reported
similar declines in their application numbers
this year.
Applications at Harvard Law School are
down 3 percent to 4 percent from last year, ac
cording to spokesman Mike Chmura. Chmura
said final figures were not yet available.
At Yale Law School, applications are down 2
percent to 3 percent from last year, Director of
Admissions Jean Webb said. Webb said final
figures were not yet available.
The University of Chicago Law School re
ported a decline of 4.2 percent in applications
received and Columbia Law School announced
a 2.9 percent decline. Both numbers represent
applications received as of March 1 of this year
in comparison to last year.
UC-Berkeley Boalt Hall School of Law re
ported a 2.4 percent decline in total applica
tions.

Admissions directors offered a variety of
possible reasons for the decline.
"It could get as trivial as the popularity of
lawyer shows on TV," said Edward Tom, direc
tor of admissions at Boalt.
Webb also cited television as a possible fac
tor, although she doubted whether it was a sub
stantial influence.
"L.A. Law was popular, and now ER is popu
lar," she said, pointing to a recent rise in med
ical school applications. She also added that
changes in legal salaries may play a role.
"Legal salaries have plateaued, and students
are learning that now," she said.
James Milligan, director of admissions at
Columbia, said potential applicants to elite law
schools may have been deterred by the long
hours and high stress often found in large cor
porate law firms.
Milligan also cited a trend away from law
school and toward medical school and MBA
programs. He said some undergraduate schools
have increased their pre-medicine counseling
and decreased their pre-law counseling in re
sponse to a change in student demand.
