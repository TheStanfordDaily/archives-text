# 'A legend among us:' David Packard 1912-1996
## Packard: Businessman, benefactor Visionary entrepreneur helped set new standards in management 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial Staff 
When he set foot on the Stanford campus in
1930, even David Packard was probably un
aware of the influence he would have over the
University and surrounding communities dur
ing his 83-year life.
Packard, who died Tuesday, was a founding
father of Silicon Valley, along with his business
partner William Hewlett. His influence on
Stanford and the Bay Area spanned the spec
trum from methods of doing business to per
sonality.
The "H-P Way" is well known as a model for
business today. Hewlett and Packard were
among the first to decentralize decision-mak
ing, offer flexible working hours and promote an
employee profit-sharing program.
Hewlett-Packard has been cited frequently
for excellence in personnel practices, business
management, product quality and service.
"As far as the company is concerned, the
greatest thing that he left behind him was a code
of ethics known as the 'H-P Way,' " Hewlett said
in a statement.
As a role model, Packard's influence
stretched to many aspects of the University as
well.
"The standards he set for engineers, for engi
neering and for technical companies reflected
back on the way we taught engineering," said
former Electrical Engineering Department
Chair Bob White, noting the "Hewlett-Packard
standard of quality."
"You always knew if you bought H-P equip
ment, it would work, or if it didn't, they would
fix it very quickly," he said.
Packard and Hewlett took advantage early on
of the resources Stanford had to offer, White said.

"He was one of the first people to start found
ing companies in this area instead of going back
to Bell Labs or elsewhere," White noted.
Later on, Hewlett-Packard recruited thou
sands of students from Stanford and returned
the favor by having employees serve as lecturers
at the University.
Packard's support of the Terman Fellows
program and a continuing education program
also showed his interest in the University's
workings, said John Linville, former chair of
Electrical Engineering Department.
Twenty years after he graduated, Packard
helped set up a program to allow employees in
technical companies with bachelor's degrees to
return to school part-time and earn master's de
grees. When one older Hewlett-Packard em
ployee participated in the program in the mid
-19605, Linville said, Packard proved the impor
tance of the program.
Although the employee was 20 years older
than most of the students in the master's pro
gram, he successfully completed his degree and
returned to Hewlett-Packard full-time.
"David Packard observed that this was a re
newed man," Linville remembered. "He said,
'Whats happened to this man is something we
should do for everyone who needs it."
Colleagues remembered Packard as a vi
sionary in terms of the University's needs. In
addition to providing funding for the Lucile
Salter Packard Children's Hospital and Ter
man Engineering Center, Packard most re
cently made a joint contribution with Hewlett
of $77.4 million to fund a new Science and En
gineering Quad.
Vice President of Development John Ford
said he was with Packard "the day he stood up in
the plaza at Green Earth Sciences and looked
out over the engineering buildings and said,

'What are we going to do with this? "
"You see where that led," Ford said.
University President Gerhard Casper re
flected that Packard deserved to see the work on
the quad complete. It is scheduled to be finished
in 1999.
Casper said he last visited with Packard at
the opening of the new William Gates Comput
er Science Building on Jan. 30.
"During lunch, we were in a room that over
looks where the new Science and Engineering
Quad will be built," Casper said. "I took him to
the window to show him where the (Electrical
Engineering) Department would be built ...
and how all of this could relate back to the earth
sciences building. But it was all in our imagina
tion .... I had very much hoped we would be
able to complete this."
The standard Packard set over the years has
influenced Stanford in a number of ways, per
haps none so obviously as the standard in giv
ing.
"There's no doubt that [Hewlett and
Packard's] generosity has made a significant
difference here at Stanford," Ford said. "It's im
pacted almost every area of this University —
from the physical landscape and buildings... to
the number of people who are supported. All of
those gifts are enormously important in the
growth of the University."
Packard also supported the University indi
rectly, especially in speaking out in favor of
funding for research, Casper said.
His commitment to such a wide variety of
causes is evidence of the standard he set and
the influence he was able to have, Casper
said.
"One can really not help but see him (as a role
model)," he said, "because first of all he never
rested. He never saw that the job was done."
