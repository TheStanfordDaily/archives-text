# Seniors provide leadership for a young Cardinal squad
## Skillman, Jacob, Tong and McLaren guide the team to fifth straight NCAA championship 
### Todd Bernstein Editorial staff 
The role of underdog was not a role the women's swimming and diving
team had played in a longtime. But at the start of the 1995-1996 season,
the Stanford women were thrown into the NCAA pool as an underdog,
having to adjust to the loss of four All-Americans, including NCAA cham
pions Jenny Thompson and Eileen Richetelli.
The Cardinal, which began its season with 14 freshmen, eight sopho
mores, 10 juniors and five seniors, was expected to suffer from its lack of
experience.
Four senior women, however, made sure that Stanford would not
merely contend for the title, but win it and prove to everyone that Stan
ford women's swimming is in a league of its own.

The four seniors — JaneSkillman, Lisa Jacob, Jessica Tong, and Mau
reen McLaren — would lead the team all season, from the elation of
romping over Michigan in the season opener, to the low of losing to USC
and ending the team's 57-dual meet win streak, and finally to the thrill of
winning a fifth straight NCAA title.
Head coach Richard Quick realized early in the season both the team's
role as an underdog and the seniors' role in overcoming that label. "[Win
ning the championshipl is satisfying because this team came together
and worked really hard toward a goal we weren't favored to win," Quick
said. "We took that as a challenge and turned it into something fun."
"The leadership of the seniors was key," added junior Claudia Franco.
"In dual meets, Jane Skillman would pull out a great swim and it's been
like that all year. The seniors don't say anything — following their ex
amples is leadership in itself."

Each of the four seniors feels she contributes to the team in a unique
way, but maintains that the Cardinal squad is not a hard one to lead. Co
captains Jacob and Skillman focus on their experience in leading the
team.
"I feel like I've had a lot of experience in big meets like NCAA champi
onships and team battles," Skillman said. "I guess I try to keep everyone
focused throughout the year. This is really a team effort and they don't
need too much leadership along the way."
Jacob was even stronger in her belief that the team didn't need much
guidance this year. "It's not like I really need to lead these people," she
said. "They're great and kind of take care of themselves. I guess a lot of
people had some doubt about us this year, and I think we showed every
one that we are still the best team."
Quick, however, does not dismiss Jacob's leadership role so easily, be
lieving her leadership through example helped the team to achieve its
goals this year.
"This team used Lisa's making the Olympic team as a springboard to
this year's national championship," Quick said. "When she made the
Olympic team, she wasn't favored to do that either. It was proof to every
body that what's written and what's said doesn't really make a difference
— it's what you do when it counts."
Tong, a transfer from Texas, sees her role as more subdued than the
roles of the two co-captains. "Not being a captain, I've tried to provide ex
amples while training and at meets," she said. "I think a lot of our fresh
men and sophomores are really talented — they just need that little push
to break through at the NCAAs."
Despite the seniors' insistence that the team doesn't need much guid
ance, the underclassmen realize the senior's importance.
"The seniors mean so much," said freshman Elin Austevoll. "In every
event they step up and show us what we have to do. They take responsi
bility and are just great."
McLaren has perhaps the most unique role among the seniors because
she has to miss part of the swimming season to play for the Cardinal vol
leyball team. McLaren, whose first love is swimming, tries to keep the
team loose during the season.
"I go out and swim every year just for fun," McLaren said. "So when I
go out there I try to be the fun person and try to remind people what it's
all about — the love of swimming."
McLaren, who has won six NCAA team titles while at Stanford,
doesn't just provide the team with laughs — her swims are often the most
inspirational. During the final preliminary session of the NCAA champi
onships, McLaren tied California's Larissa Herold in the 200-yard back
stroke, thus forcing a swim-off. In the swim-off McLaren shaved two sec
onds off her career-best time and beat Herold with a time of one minute,
56.85 seconds. Quick's praise of McLaren seemed endless.
"That last swim-off was huge," Quick said. "That was a volleyball
player who comes out for swimming late and she finds a way to contribute
to her team and swim two seconds faster than she ever has in her life."
The Cardinal seniors finished the season as they had begun it — with
a win at Michigan's Canham Natatorium and indeed proved that they
were the best around. "I am really thrilled for the senior class — they did
a great job all season long, starting in [Michigan I back in November when
they all stepped up and showed us the way," Quick said.
For Skillman, Tong, Jacob, and McLaren, this year's championship
was a sweet as they come. "I remember last year the Michigan team said
'good meet, Stanford — see you in Ann Arbor next year,'" Skillman said.
"I remember thinking that I wanted to win [the championship] again in
Michigan, making it four in my four years. And I wanted to be a senior
holding the trophy on the top of the steps."
And that is just what she did.
