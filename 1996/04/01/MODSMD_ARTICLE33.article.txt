## Suzman collapses in Kresge 
### Timothy Kiefer Contributing writer 
Helen Suzman, a white South
African legislator who waged an
often lonely battle against
apartheid, collapsed while giving a
speech Ln Kresge Auditorium on
March 20.
She was taken to Stanford I los
pital, where she underwent tests
and spent the night. She was dis
charged from the hospital the fol
lowing morning.
Suzman, 78, served in the
South African parliament from
1953 until 1989. Between 1961
and 1974 she was both the only
anti-apartheid member of parlia
ment and its only woman.
Law School Dean Paul Brest,
who was sitting on the stage be
hind Suzman, prevented her from
falling and helped her into a chair.
Suzman then appeared to immedi
ately regain consciousness.
Although Brest suggested end
ing the program early, Suzman

unexpectedly rose from the chair
and attempted to continue giving
her speech.
"I apologize; this has never
happened before," she said, blam
ing her collapse on medications
she was taking for a cold.
However, within about a
minute Suzman started to col
lapse again, prompting Brest to
quickly end the program.
"You would not have wanted to
be her opponent," Brest said to
the audience as Suzman was again
helped to a chair and the audience
rose to a standing ovation.
Despite her age, the South
African political leader gave no
hint of any medical problems prior
to her collapse. She appeared
healthy during her speech and
during a lunch with law students
the previous day.
Suzman was at Stanford to re
ceive the Jackson I I. Ralston Prize
in international law. Former win
ners of the prize include President
Jimmv Carter. Canadian Prime

Minister Pierre Trudeau and most
recently Czech President Vaclav
Havel.
Suzman's tenacity in attempt
ing to continue with her speech
was paralleled by her tenacity in
South Africa's political arena,
where she opposed apartheid leg
islation and fought for better con
ditions for political prisoners.
She frequently clashed with
the ruling National Party and es
pecially with Prime Minister P.W.
Botha, whom she referred to in
her speech as being "unpre
dictable" and "irrational."
Without friends in the National
Party-dominated parliament,
Suzman was obliged to look to the
outside world for allies in her fight
against apartheid.
"One National Party member
was so irritated by my questions,
he said, 'You only ask these ques
tions to embarrass South Africa
abroad,' "shesaid. "I said, 'But it's
not my questions that embarrass
South Africa. It's your answers.' "
