### Timothy Kiefer Contributing writer 
Folger and Levin, a San Francisco-based law
firm, has donated $250,000 to the Law School to
support public interest law. The donation will fi
nance grants given to Stanford law students who
work in public interest law during the summer
months.
The Folger and Levin Public Interest Fellow
ship Fund was created by six partners in the firm.
Five graduated from Stanford Law School in
1973, while the sixth received a Stanford under
graduate degree in 1967.
"Our honest feeling is that law firms should be
doing more for the community," said John Levin,
one of the donors. "We hope our gift will inspire
other firms to take a leading role in the steward
ship of law schools."
According to Dan Pollak of the Law School's
Office of Fxternal Relations, major gifts from law
firms are unusual, and this gift is even more note
worthy since it was made by a relatively small
firm.
Public interest law includes legal aid bureaus
providing assistance to low-income clients, public
defender offices, state and federal prosecutors'

offices and political advocacy organizations.
First- and second-year law students typically
work in law-related jobs during the summer
months. Although corporate law firms pay their
summer associates $1,000 a week or more, public
interest jobs are usually unpaid. The Folger and
Levin donation will supplement the Law School's
current practice of giving small grants or loans to
pay summer living expenses for public-interest
students.
About 75 first- and second-year students will
do public interest work this summer. In the early
1980s, when tiie school first began providing
summer assistance to public interest students,
only about 15 students worked in public interest
during the summer.
Approximately 10 percent of the Class of 1995
took public-interest jobs upon graduation, ac
cording to the Law School's Office of Career Ser
vices. About 50 percent of students went to law
firms and about 30 percent took judicial clerk
ships.
The public interest donation is the second
large gift to the Law School by Folger and Levin.
In 1992, the law firm donated $250,000 to make
the Law School more accessible to disabled stu
dents, faculty and staff.
