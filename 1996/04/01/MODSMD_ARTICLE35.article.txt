teacher and he was my hero."

the same time he was teaching
Schultz. "He made common things
electric," Horpel said. "He was
very well known in the world of
wrestling."
"He had a sense of wonder, al
ways wanted to learn more about
life," added Martel. "He had a
heart.. . and was just nice to peo
ple."
Schultz is survived by his wife
Nancy, their 9-year-old son
Alexander and their 6-year-old
daughter Danielle.
