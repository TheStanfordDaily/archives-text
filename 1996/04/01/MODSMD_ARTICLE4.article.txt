# Abrams pleads no contest to charges

Stanford football place-kicker Eric
Abrams pleaded no contest last week to mis
demeanor charges of phone harassment for
posing as a Stanford football recruiter and re
questing nude photographs of high school
athletes.
Abrams, 22, was charged Thursday with

seven counts of phone ha
rassment, which, according
to Santa Clara County
Deputy District Attorney
Jack Marshall, is defined as
"making repeated phone
calls with the intent to
annoy."
"We felt that we could not
prove any statute that car
ried with it an element of sex
ual intent," Marshall said.

Judge Randle Schneider sentenced
Abrams at a hearing on Thursday, the same
day the charges were filed, to three years pro
bation, 100 hours of community service, a
$200 fine, psychiatric counseling and restitu
tion where deemed necessary by probation.
He was also admonished not to represent
himself as from Stanford University or the
Stanford Athletic Department.
By pleading no contest, Abrams did not
legally admit guilt in the crime. But in a state
ment through Nolan, Abrams said the actions
were part of a prank.
"He intended to do no harm, and he ac
cepts the consequences of his actions," Nolan
said.

The victims were all minors, but Marshall
said to his knowledge, there is no penal code
which makes annoying phone calls a worse
crime dependent on the age of the victim.
The seven charges were for each victim,
mostly from across California, including
Santa Clara County, San Francisco County,
San Mateo County, Riverside County and
Alameda County. Two victims were from out
of state: Montgomery County in Pennsylva
nia and Jefferson County in Alabama.
Psychological tests on Abrams given to the
prosecution by Abrams' lawyer Thomas
Nolan affected how Abrams was charged,
Marshall said. "That really helped us," he
said. "It gave us some insight into what moti
vated the conduct."
Abrams, a senior majoring in psychology,
was arrested at the Stanford post office in a
sting operation Jan. 26.
Marshall said the calls to the athletes
began last June, and the last call was made
Jan. 24. "It is my belief that in various ways
complaints and reports of misconduct were
beginning to hit the police department proba
bly sometime in the fall," Marshall said.
"Stanford Police were investigating the
complaints before the Santa Clara case sur
faced, but they had no leads," he said. Santa
Clara police officers investigated the com
plaints from their county, and when Abrams
gave a victim his Stanford post office box
number under another football player's
name, police were able to trace the calls to
him.
Marshall said restitution — appropriating
money for criminally incurred costs — may


Abrams
not be deemed necessary. "This is
separate from whether or not peo
ple suffered damages —■ that is a
civil issue. The probation depart
ment will look at the claim and de
cide if restitution is necessary," said
Marshall.
According to Marshall, the pur
pose of requiring Abrams not to

represent himself as being from
Stanford is to discourage Abrams
from participating in similar activi
ties in the future.
"This means he cannot go out
and falsely represent himself as a
recruiter — not that he can't say he
went to Stanford," said Marshall.
"If the court becomes aware that he
has engaged in similar conduct, rep
resenting Stanford University
without permission, then he can be
sent to jail."
Marshall said the sentence was

standard for this type of case. "We
tried to look at this like any other
case under this type of statute, and
the sentence was one the court
would hand out on any given day, to
any person," said Marshall. "I han
dle some of the more sexual cases,
ones where victims are really aggra
vated, afraid to pick up the phone.
Here, no one was terrified or scared,
or even highly upset — more they
were annoyed."
Patrick McMahon, the lawyer
representing the Santa Clara vic-

Tim, said although his client was
pleased that Abrams was receiving
psychological counseling, the fami
ly was angry at the suggestion the
incidents were pranks.
"Such a spin is untrue and un
fortunate — this is no prank,"
McMahon said, adding that he is
drafting a complaint for a civil suit
to be filed within two weeks. "The
only way we wouldn't file is if we
could settle the matter with
Abrams' civil attorney out of
court."

McMahon said the civil charges
would include privacy violations,
nuisance and infliction of distress.
He said he was not sure if he could
act on the sexual overtones of the
case. "This was a form of sexual ha
rassment: My client was not con
senting, but I don't think there is
any legal basis to act on," McMahon
said.
Through the suit or an out-of
court settlement, McMahon said he
will seek a fund for his client's col
lege education.

Although the criminal investiga
tion has ended, Abrams can still be
punished by the University, which
is investigating possible violations
of the Fundamental Standard.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
said the Abrams case has been for
warded to the Office of Judicial Af
fairs and is "currently being adjudi
cated." He added the University
acts independently of the court jus
tice system and is "not held captive
by what goes on in the outside
world."
