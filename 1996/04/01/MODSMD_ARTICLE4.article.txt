Stanford football place-kicker Eric
Abrams pleaded no contest last week to mis
demeanor charges of phone harassment for
posing as a Stanford football recruiter and re
questing nude photographs of high school
athletes.
Abrams, 22, was charged Thursday with

seven counts of phone ha
rassment, which, according
to Santa Clara County
Deputy District Attorney
Jack Marshall, is defined as
"making repeated phone
calls with the intent to
annoy."
"We felt that we could not
prove any statute that car
ried with it an element of sex
ual intent," Marshall said.

Judge Randle Schneider sentenced
Abrams at a hearing on Thursday, the same
day the charges were filed, to three years pro
bation, 100 hours of community service, a
$200 fine, psychiatric counseling and restitu
tion where deemed necessary by probation.
He was also admonished not to represent
himself as from Stanford University or the
Stanford Athletic Department.
By pleading no contest, Abrams did not
legally admit guilt in the crime. But in a state
ment through Nolan, Abrams said the actions
were part of a prank.
"He intended to do no harm, and he ac
cepts the consequences of his actions," Nolan
said.

The victims were all minors, but Marshall
said to his knowledge, there is no penal code
which makes annoying phone calls a worse
crime dependent on the age of the victim.
The seven charges were for each victim,
mostly from across California, including
Santa Clara County, San Francisco County,
San Mateo County, Riverside County and
Alameda County. Two victims were from out
of state: Montgomery County in Pennsylva
nia and Jefferson County in Alabama.
Psychological tests on Abrams given to the
prosecution by Abrams' lawyer Thomas
Nolan affected how Abrams was charged,
Marshall said. "That really helped us," he
said. "It gave us some insight into what moti
vated the conduct."
Abrams, a senior majoring in psychology,
was arrested at the Stanford post office in a
sting operation Jan. 26.
Marshall said the calls to the athletes
began last June, and the last call was made
Jan. 24. "It is my belief that in various ways
complaints and reports of misconduct were
beginning to hit the police department proba
bly sometime in the fall," Marshall said.
"Stanford Police were investigating the
complaints before the Santa Clara case sur
faced, but they had no leads," he said. Santa
Clara police officers investigated the com
plaints from their county, and when Abrams
gave a victim his Stanford post office box
number under another football player's
name, police were able to trace the calls to
him.
Marshall said restitution — appropriating
money for criminally incurred costs — may
