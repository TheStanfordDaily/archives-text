# Four students garner Truman Scholarships
##

An unprecedented four Stanford students
were named Harry S. Truman Scholars last
month, setting a scholarship record for the
number of winners in one year by a single
university.
But without a clerical error by the Univer
sity, two of the five finalists would not have
even been nominated. Normally, universities
may not nominate more than three students
for the prestigious public service award.
Winning the honors were juniors Brooks
Allen, Aaron Padilla, Nick Thompson and se
nior Vivek Nasta.
"[Public policy work] doesn't have high
salaries," Allen said. "This award gives me
more freedom."
The Truman Scholarship, one of the most
respected public service awards in the United
States, recognizes commitment to careers in
public service, leadership potential, intellec
tual strength and prospects for performing
well in graduate school.
The scholarship program was established
by Congress in 1975 as a memorial to Presi
dent Truman. It is comparable in stature to
the Rhodes and Marshall Scholarships,
which tend to be more academic in nature.
Truman Scholars are given $30,000 to

cover tuition and other expenses for their se
nior year and for two years of graduate study.
In addition, they are invited to attend a na
tional leadership conference in the spring
and hold a summer internship in a branch of
the federal government of their choice.
Fifty-eight scholars were chosen from 47
U.S. institutions.
The rigorous application procedure is
composed of two parts. Students must first
submit partial applications to Stanford's
nominating committee, which includes Sci
ence, Technology and Society Program Di
rector Robert McGinn, Haas Center for Pub
lic Service Director Timothy Stanton and
Economics Prof. Gavin Wright. After being
chosen to represent Stanford, nominees pro
ceed to regional competitions by state. Final
ists are interviewed by a panel of distin
guished community members, which then
selects the winners of the award.
Stanford was allowed to enter an unusual
number of candidates this year because in
formation was miscommunic ited to two stu
dents overseas, who were then added to the
list bringing the total number of representa
tives to five, all of whom subsequently be
came finalists.
