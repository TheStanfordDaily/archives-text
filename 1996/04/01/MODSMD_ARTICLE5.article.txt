# Four students garner Truman Scholarships
## 
### Jennifer Wang 
An unprecedented four Stanford students
were named Harry S. Truman Scholars last
month, setting a scholarship record for the
number of winners in one year by a single
university.
But without a clerical error by the Univer
sity, two of the five finalists would not have
even been nominated. Normally, universities
may not nominate more than three students
for the prestigious public service award.
Winning the honors were juniors Brooks
Allen, Aaron Padilla, Nick Thompson and se
nior Vivek Nasta.
"[Public policy work] doesn't have high
salaries," Allen said. "This award gives me
more freedom."
The Truman Scholarship, one of the most
respected public service awards in the United
States, recognizes commitment to careers in
public service, leadership potential, intellec
tual strength and prospects for performing
well in graduate school.
The scholarship program was established
by Congress in 1975 as a memorial to Presi
dent Truman. It is comparable in stature to
the Rhodes and Marshall Scholarships,
which tend to be more academic in nature.
Truman Scholars are given $30,000 to

cover tuition and other expenses for their se
nior year and for two years of graduate study.
In addition, they are invited to attend a na
tional leadership conference in the spring
and hold a summer internship in a branch of
the federal government of their choice.
Fifty-eight scholars were chosen from 47
U.S. institutions.
The rigorous application procedure is
composed of two parts. Students must first
submit partial applications to Stanford's
nominating committee, which includes Sci
ence, Technology and Society Program Di
rector Robert McGinn, Haas Center for Pub
lic Service Director Timothy Stanton and
Economics Prof. Gavin Wright. After being
chosen to represent Stanford, nominees pro
ceed to regional competitions by state. Final
ists are interviewed by a panel of distin
guished community members, which then
selects the winners of the award.
Stanford was allowed to enter an unusual
number of candidates this year because in
formation was miscommunic ited to two stu
dents overseas, who were then added to the
list bringing the total number of representa
tives to five, all of whom subsequently be
came finalists.
"There is satisfaction in know
ing people you recognize as being
excellent are going to be put in a
place to make a contribution in so
ciety," McGinn said.
McGinn's role in the process
should not be overlooked. In writ
ing recommendations, McGinn
said, "I tried to capture what the
essence was of each person — what
made them tick." His dedication
and attention to detail in the
lengthy two-page student ac
counts were praised by the Tru
man Foundation in Washington,
D.C., and will be used as sample
letters in the following year's
brochure.
McGinn attributes most of the
students' success with their own
hard work, but said, "Stanford de
serves some credit as a university
because of the emphasis placed on
public policy as a valued endeav
or."
Nasta, who is double majoring
in Science, Technology and Soci
ety and history, said he is "proud
to be able to go into public service
as one of the first people in my
family." He attended high school
in West Orange, N.J.
"I spent a lot of time on the ap
plication just because it was an ex
tension of me," he said, addintr

that he tried not to get too attached
to it.
Nasta's primary public service
work is in the field of science and
technology and his interests lie in
research and development policy.
Two summers ago he interned at
the Office of Science and Technol
ogy Policy in Washington, D.C.,
writing a home page and organiz
ing efforts to educate people.
Nasta's dream is to work in the
White House as the senior adviser
for Science and Technology, and he
believes the government "should
encourage global collaboration in
technology." Nasta wants to make
the United States more competi
tive by empowering masses of
everyday citizens with the knowl
edge of how to utilize technology
and making the field more hands
on and applications-oriented.
"Basic science is great and it's
wonderful, but the reality is that
technology these days requires
mass participation. Otherwise we
will fall behind Japan," he said.
He hopes to use his award as
"leverage to get in where a lot of
policy work is going on." Nasta
plans to defer graduate school for
a year to work for a San Francisco
consulting firm in order to "really
understand the business side of
technology."
At Stanford, Nasta pursued a
variety of disciplines including his
tory, economics and computer sci
ence, nearly completing the re

quirements for three majors.
Nasta attributes his accomplish
ments to his family, his adviser,
McGinn, and his college. "Stan
ford gave this to me and I will
never forget that," he said.
A political science major, Allen
— who has worked with the Up
ward Bound low-income federal
tutoring program to aid high
school students in preparing for
college — believes a university ed
ucation must be more accessible to
all stratas of the population.
As a residential counselor in the
summer and tutoring coordinator
during the academic year, Allen
said he "always had leanings in the
education direction." Allen also
coaches a basketball team at an
East Palo Alto school in his free
time. He is from Santa Cruz, Calif.
Allen believes the stress his par
ents placed on the value of educa
tion and the opportunity it pro
vides influenced his decision to go
into the field.
"I wasn't too optimistic about
my chances of winning," he said. "I
knew the odds were stacked
against me." The Truman Scholar
stipend will make it possible for
Allen to go directly to graduate
school.
Allen hopes to study public poli
cy at the Kennedy School of Gov
ernment at Harvard University or
the Woodrow Wilson School at
Princeton University and complete
his internship at the Department

of Education in Washington, D.C.
In the future, he would like to work
with high school students and
eventually dreams of starting his
own school.
Allen echoed Nasta's sentiment
that Stanford had much to do with
his success, saying "the name does
carry some weight" and students
"clearly benefit from the legacy of
past Truman Scholars here." He is
grateful for the real world experi
ence he has received, but adds that
one must get off campus to get in
volved.
Padilla, who is from Loveland,
Colo., is an international relations
major with a focus in environmen
tal issues. Padilla is a member of
Students for Environmental Ac
tion at Stanford and last summer
did research in Costa Rica.
He plans to go to either Harvard
or Princeton to earn a master's de
gree in public policy.
Thompson, who is from Chest
nut Hill, Mass., is a KZSU radio
host, as well as the founder of a stu
dent newspaper, The Thinker. He
also is a coordinator for SEAS and a
member of the University's Advi
sory Panel on Investment Respon
sibility.
A triple major, Thompson will
graduate with degrees in econom
ics, public policy and earth sys
tems.
He plans to do graduate work in
international environmental eco
nomics.

to be able to go into public service
as one of the first people in my
family." He attended high school
in West Orange, N.J.
"I spent a lot of time on the ap
plication just because it was an ex
tension of me," he said, addintr

that he tried not to get too attached
to it.
Nasta's primary public service
work is in the field of science and
technology and his interests lie in
research and development policy.
Two summers ago he interned at
the Office of Science and Technol
ogy Policy in Washington, D.C.,
writing a home page and organiz
ing efforts to educate people.
Nasta's dream is to work in the
White House as the senior adviser
for Science and Technology, and he
believes the government "should
encourage global collaboration in
technology." Nasta wants to make
the United States more competi
tive by empowering masses of
everyday citizens with the knowl
edge of how to utilize technology
and making the field more hands
on and applications-oriented.
"Basic science is great and it's
wonderful, but the reality is that
technology these days requires
mass participation. Otherwise we
will fall behind Japan," he said.
He hopes to use his award as
"leverage to get in where a lot of
policy work is going on." Nasta
plans to defer graduate school for
a year to work for a San Francisco
consulting firm in order to "really
understand the business side of
technology."
At Stanford, Nasta pursued a
variety of disciplines including his
tory, economics and computer sci
ence, nearly completing the re

quirements for three majors.
Nasta attributes his accomplish
ments to his family, his adviser,
McGinn, and his college. "Stan
ford gave this to me and I will
never forget that," he said.
A political science major, Allen
— who has worked with the Up
ward Bound low-income federal
tutoring program to aid high
school students in preparing for
college — believes a university ed
ucation must be more accessible to
all stratas of the population.
As a residential counselor in the
summer and tutoring coordinator
during the academic year, Allen
said he "always had leanings in the
education direction." Allen also
coaches a basketball team at an
East Palo Alto school in his free
time. He is from Santa Cruz, Calif.
Allen believes the stress his par
ents placed on the value of educa
tion and the opportunity it pro
vides influenced his decision to go
into the field.
"I wasn't too optimistic about
my chances of winning," he said. "I
knew the odds were stacked
against me." The Truman Scholar
stipend will make it possible for
Allen to go directly to graduate
school.
Allen hopes to study public poli
cy at the Kennedy School of Gov
ernment at Harvard University or
the Woodrow Wilson School at
Princeton University and complete
his internship at the Department

of Education in Washington, D.C.
In the future, he would like to work
with high school students and
eventually dreams of starting his
own school.
Allen echoed Nasta's sentiment
that Stanford had much to do with
his success, saying "the name does
carry some weight" and students
"clearly benefit from the legacy of
past Truman Scholars here." He is
grateful for the real world experi
ence he has received, but adds that
one must get off campus to get in
volved.
Padilla, who is from Loveland,
Colo., is an international relations
major with a focus in environmen
tal issues. Padilla is a member of
Students for Environmental Ac
tion at Stanford and last summer
did research in Costa Rica.
He plans to go to either Harvard
or Princeton to earn a master's de
gree in public policy.
Thompson, who is from Chest
nut Hill, Mass., is a KZSU radio
host, as well as the founder of a stu
dent newspaper, The Thinker. He
also is a coordinator for SEAS and a
member of the University's Advi
sory Panel on Investment Respon
sibility.
A triple major, Thompson will
graduate with degrees in econom
ics, public policy and earth sys
tems.
He plans to do graduate work in
international environmental eco
nomics.
