# Women's swimming captures NCAA title
## 
### Todd Bernstein Editorial staff 
It was like deja vu all over again, as the women's
swimming and diving team won its fifth consecutive
national championship a week ago at Michigan's
Canham Natatorium to put an end to Stanford's
1995-1996 NCAA championship drought.
Led by seniors Lisa Jacob, Jane Skillman, Jessica
Tong and Maureen McLaren, and the performance
of junior Claudia Franco, Stanford demolished the
competition, finishing 81 points ahead of second
place Southern Methodist and 125 points ahead of
Michigan.
Despite failing to win any events on March 21,
the Cardinal swam consistently and strongly,
building an early lead by finishing second in three
events and placing swimmers in the championship
Finals throughout the night.
The night belonged to Tong, who not only took
home second place in the 50-yard freestyle and the
400 individual medley, but also led the Cardinal's
relay teams to second-place finishes in the 200 free
relay, the first event of the night, and the 400 indi
vidual medley relay.
Tong, a transfer from Texas, was pleased with her
swims on day one, but wanted to taste victory later
in the meet. "I was really happy with our relays,' she

in the meet. "I was really happy
with our relays," she said. "It's
not fun to get second ever, but I
am pretty happy with how I did —
I wasn't even expecting to place
that well in the [50 free 1."
following the last event of the
night, Stanford head coach
Richard Quick seemed more en
thusiastic about Tong's perfor
mance, and felt the team had done
reasonably well in forging a 158-
113 lead over SMU after only the
first two sessions of the competi
tion.
"Last night was a good, solid
night — we have a 45-point lead,
which is better than no lead,"
Quick said. "I had hoped we would
have had a little bit bigger lead
than that, but it was pretty good.
"[Tongl did a great job," he
added. "First of all, she leads off
our 200 free relay, giving us a
chance to win. We get second, but
she does a great job. Then she gets
second in the 50 freestyle and then
leads off our medley relay with a
great swim that led us to a second
place."
Stanford approached day two

with cautious optimism, expecting
to build its lead, while trying to re
main focused and avoid becoming
overconfident.
"[Day one] was a really good
day for us, but we are going to get
better every day, and I think our
lead will be bigger than 45 points,"
Tong said.
Tong was right, as the Cardinal
established itself as the dominant
team by the middle of the prelimi
naries on day two. After the pre
liminary session, Stanford had
earned No. 1 seeds in the 200 med
ley relay and the 100 back, and
held eight spots overall in that
night's championship finals.
The Cardinal began the finals
by settinga Canham pool record in
the 200-yard medley relay with a
time of 1 minute, 40.9 seconds.
Tong led off the relay, establishing
a slight lead for freshman Klin
Austevoll. Austevoll held that
lead, as did freshman Suzanne
Toledo. Franco, who swam the an
chor leg, extended the lead and fin
ished strong in earning the Cardi
nal 40 first-place points.
The victory only fueled the Car
dinal's momentum, as the women
earned points in every swim of the

night, with freshman Kari Ed
wards finishing seventh in the 400
individual medley, Franco taking
third in the 100 fly consolation
final, Austevoll garnering fourth
in the 100 breast, and Jacob, Skill
man, Amy Oberhelman and
Michelle Jesperson all earning
points in the 200 free.
The highlight of the night came
in the 100 back, as seniors Tong
and McLaren battled to a one-two
finish. Tong, who set a pool record
with a time of 54.09, finished just
ahead of McLaren, who touched
the wall at 54.56.
The Cardinal added a first
place finish in the 800 free relay,
the last event of the night, to vir
tually wrap up the team title.
Quick, while quick to praise the in
dividual accomplishments of the
swimmers, realized the impor
tance of the relays as well.
"It was a great performance
and what the team really needed,"
Quick said. "We are not a great
team that is going to win a lot of
events, so when we have a chance
to win one like the relays, we need
to make sure we do it.
"It really helps the psychologi
cal momentum of the meet," he

added, "not only because of the
points, but the momentum in get
ting ready for the next day is
huge."
Although carrying an insur
mountable 69-point lead going
into the last day of competition,
Stanford grew even stronger
throughout day three, getting sur
prising performances from junior
diver Megan Gardner and Ober
helman in the 1650 free.
Gardner, who had failed to
score any points in the first two
days of diving, dove flawlessly on
day three and finished second in
the 10-meter platform, just 24
points behind national champion
Becky Ruehl.
Going into the meet, head div
ing coach Rick Shavone expected
Gardner to use this year's compe
tition as a learning experience,
and never thought she would score
so high in the finals.
"[Gardner] is a really young
diver," Shavone said. "Keeping
her in the meet and relaxed was
the biggest objective of mine. Did I
think she could do this? No — it's
a big step for her.
"I had gotten upset with her be
fore the [10-meter platform], so I
sat her down and tried to calm her
down," he added. "She was tough
as nails up there tonight — she
didn't make a mistake."
Gardner, while equally happy
with her performance, was not as
emotionally contained as
Shavone. "I was pretty nervous

coming to NCAAs because I had a
lot of expectations and I knew it
was going to be hard," she said. "I
just tried to have fun; that's when
I do my best, and I definitely had
fun this year."
Following her last dive, an elat
ed Gardner was quick to praise her
coach. "It was a mixture of relief

It's always great
when the kind of se
nior leadership we
had pays off with a
title.'

and pure happiness," she said.
"The most important factor was
my coach— we've been working
for six months and he's put in as
much as anyone, even me."
The other shock of the night was
the third-place finish of Oberhel
man in the 1650 free. Oberhelman,
who didn't expect to score any
points in the finals, shaved 30 sec
onds off of her season best and five
seconds off her career-best times,
to place with a time of 16:14.82.
After finishing the 1650 heat,
Oberhelman seemed as surprised
and excited as anyone about her
performance. "I had no idea what

to expect," she said. "I was just
looking for a good swim to help the
team score points."
In addition to the surprises on
day three, the Cardinal got excel
lent performances from Franco,
who set a pool record in the 100
free by swimming a career-best
49.04. Franco, who also helped
Stanford's 400 free relay team
close out the NCAAs with a victo
ry, felt confident going into her
100 free race.
"I was really calm before it and
I felt I had a good chance of win
ning," Franco said, "I basically
tried to stay up, and when I made
the last turn and saw that I was
ahead, I just thought: 'Do any
thing to finish first.'"
The Cardinal's 81-point victory
was the team's fifth straight
NCAA championship, tying the
Texas for the longest title run.
Co-captain Skillman, who has
experienced the last four Cardinal
titles, felt this year's win was espe
cially sweet. "I feel really comfort
able at Stanford and on this team,
and I feel like I got to let it all come
out this year," she said. "This year
there was a little something extra
since it was my last one."
A tired but happy coach Quick
echoed Skillman's thoughts in ex
pressing his feelings about the win.
"It feels great," he said. "It's al
ways great when the kind of senior
leadership we had pays off with a
title. I am thrilled for the team, for
the senior class, and for Stan ford."
