# Secretary of State heads to Stanford
## 
### Lila LaHood 
Secretary of State Warren
Christopher will unveil the ob
jectives of the United States'
new environmental foreign poli
cy in an address at Stanford on
April 9.
The address, which will begin
at 11 a.m. in Memorial Auditori
um, will focus on U.S. plans for
the full integration of environ
mental and resource concerns
into the nation's core foreign
policy objectives.
"This is the first time the
U.S. has incorporated environ
mental issues into its foreign
policy plans," said David Leavy,
director of communications at
the State Department. Accord
ing to Leavy, the State Depart
ment understands that environ
mental and resource concerns
such as water rights affect many
countries and regions whose
stability is crucial to U.S. securi
ty.
The State Department made
a very conscious decision in
choosing Stanford as the venue
for this important event, he
said. Christopher is a 1949 grad
uate of the Law School, where
he was a co-founder and the first
president of the Stanford Law
Review. He is also a former
chairman of the University's
Board of Trustees.
Stanford was also chosen be
cause of its renown internation
al studies programs and the on
campus presence of the Hoover

Institution, an international
think tank, Leavy said.
"We are very enthusiastic
about it," said Larry Horton,
the University's director of gov
ernment and community rela
tions, in reference to the upcom
ing address. "The Secretary of
State rarely travels within the
country," Horton said.
Most of the Secretary of
State's duties are in Washing
ton, D.C., or abroad, Leavy said.
Christopher's last domestic
speech was at Harvard Univer
sity in January, for an annual
event at which the Secretary of
State lays out the U.S. foreign
policy objectives for the coming
year. Christopher rarely gives
more than two or three speeches
a year in the United States.
Christopher is not scheduled
to make any other public ap
pearances while in California.
Stanford has extended invi
tations to several community
leaders and local officials to at
tend the address, Horton said,
but due to limited seating, Stan
ford students, faculty and staff
will have first priority on tickets
before they will be available to
the public.
"I hope students would be en
couraged to come," Leavy said.
"It will be a historic event."
Tickets for the address can be
obtained between 10 a.m. and 5
p.m. Wednesday through April
8, at the Stanford Ticket Office
in the lower lobby of Tresidder
Union.
