SPRING QUARTER COURSES IN FRENCH AND ENGINEERING
As a part of this year's program for engineering students also interested in French and as a follow-up to the recent
colloquium at Stanford on French and Engineering, two courses are being offered. They are given in French.
Students who have not been able to take prior courses in the program are invited to consult with the professor
(Department of French and Italian: 3-4183) before or at the first meeting.
The Time Schedule listing has been changed. A first organizational meeting will
be held in order to accommodate as many students as possible. If you are not free
at the time of the first meeting, please email the instructor and let him know the
open times in your program for scheduling the course.
FRENCH 128. Management of Technological Resources (same as Engineering 152). This
course will explore technology vs. science and why they have different production and diffusion processes: the role
of corporation technology management and its relationship with research and development, support of corporate
development, integrating external technologies, making money with existing technologies, adapting technologies to
a new business, competitive intelligence, feeding the strategic process, and implementing the strategy.
3-5 units, Organizational meeting Tuesday, April 2, at 11:00 am in History 13, Instructor Thierry Weil, Visiting
Professor, Ecole des Mines, Paris (weil@leland)
FRENCH 129, Advances of Technology in Europe: Computer Assisted Engineering
("LAO"), (same as Engineering 153). The status and art of "IAO" and the European technological perspective.
Stages of development: specifications, behavioral description, software analysis, theoretical elements, methods,
languages and tools. The nature of the European market, especially French, will be considered: documentation,
background, testability, etc. Examples from aeronautics and telecommunications will show that the same
procedures can be used in two different sectors.
