# Managed competition?
## Experts rate health plans 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Information from a new Stanford study may shed
valuable new light on the debate over managed com
petition in health care.
A study of 5,000 Stanford employees over the past
two years found that workers who paid a larger per
centage of the cost of their health insurance out of
their own pockets tended to be more price-conscious
in their choice of insurance provider.
"The study is supportive of the assumptions that
underlie [Stanford's employee insurance] policy,"
said Economics Prof. Emeritus Victor Fuchs, a
health-care expert who was not involved in the study.
Stanford's policy is one of managed competition,
which in principle tries to control the overall cost of
health care by giving insurance companies incentives
to compete to provide lower prices.
The Stanford version of managed competition
gives employees a choice between four plans, but
whichever plan the employee chooses, he or she gets
paid the same amount by Stanford, which is a per
centage of the cost of the lowest-priced plan. Employ
ees who select more expensive plans must pay the dif
ference themselves. There are also rules to standard
ize the levels of care offered by the four competing
plans.
Asst. Economics Prof. Anne Royalty, who con
ducted the study of Stanford employees with Neil
Solomon, a former post-doctoral fellow, said the idea
behind the managed competition model was to give
employees both the incentive and the ability to make
price the main factor in choosing health-care plans.
This,, supporters say, will cause companies to lower
their prices to compete.
"I think [the study] confirms the validity and ap
propriateness of decisions the University has made,"
said Business Prof. Alain Enthoven, who came up
with a model of managed competition that formed
the basis of the plan adopted by Stanford.
The idea for the study came out of the congres
sional debate over health care in 1993, Royalty said.
She added that there was, at the time, little statistical
evidence to confirm or deny theories as to people's be
havior in a setting of managed competition.
Enthoven said the proposition that managed com
petition incentives would make people price-con
scious was "just normal market economics." Howev
er, Fuchs noted that there was "vigorous opposition
from many quarters" to this as
sumption from those who thought
that "people treat health care dif
ferently from other commodities."
Royalty's figures, however,
show that for the Stanford sam
ple, if the cost of a plan increased
10 percent, employees were be
tween 2.8 percent and 7.9 percent
less likely to choose it. In earlier
studies where managed competi
tion was not in effect, those fig
ures were between 1 percent and 2
percent.
The study also supports the
idea that managed competition
leads to lower rates. Each of the
four providers used by Stanford
lowered their rates over the two
year period of the study.
"There seems to be data actual
ly showing that people appear
more price-conscious [when man
aged care is in effect]," Royalty
said, adding that another recent
study of the University of Califor
nia system provided evidence
along the same lines.
Enthoven said these studies
were very important new develop

ments.
"Before, there were several
studies, but they were just not
nearly as good as these two" for
the purposes of evaluating man
aged competition, he said.
The data indicated that older
workers and workers who are
chronically ill or have chronically
ill dependents are less sensitive to
price changes. A major factor in
this, Royalty said, is that such peo
ple have more extensive medical
histories and are less comfortable
switching to doctors who do not
know them.
This could mean that people
who need the most expensive care
could, over time, end up being con
centrated in the more expensive
plans, she said. This is in line with
a major criticism of managed care,
namely that it would disadvantage
those who need care the most.
Enthoven said such "adverse
selection . . . is something that can
be measured and corrected." He
said once data is available to mea
sure the degree to which the elder
ly and chronically ill are disadvan
taged, the University could com
pensate them by increasing the
percentage it pays of their premi
ums.
