# Shave, haircut and a master key
## 
### Jennifer Brinsky 
Junior Nathan Jones knew
when he became a resident assis
tant that his job would include
being a counselor, role model and
friend. He did not know it would
include being a beautician.
A Feminist Studies major
from Highland Park, 111., Jones is
an RAin Paloma, an all-fresh
man dorm in Florence Moore
Hall. He began giving haircuts as
soon as the school year started,
and by now, he estimates that he
has cut the hair of about a quar
ter of the Paloma residents.
"I don't know any real tech
niques," he admitted, laughing.
"I just make up stuff." So far,
this strategy seems to have
served him well; he reports only
one casualty.
"This one person's hair had
lots of different layers. When I
finished there was something re
ally strange about it. But he kept
[the style], and people still come
to me."
Dan Greenwood, a Paloma
resident, spoke positively about
Jones. "He did a good job," said
Greenwood. "I went from very
long to very short." Greenwood
said his roommate has also gone
under Jones' scissors.
Most people, unless they have
had their heads shaved, wonder
about the shapes of scalps under
all that hair. Jones reported that
some people's heads are definite
ly more of a challenge than oth
ers.
"Some people have really 'ter
rainous' scalps, and you end up
with bald spots," he explained.
Because students are worried
about messing up, he said, "A lot

of people aren't willing to cut
other people's hair." But Jones
said he always rises to the chal
lenge.
Jones is no novice to the art of
cutting hair. While growing up,
his parents gave him and his five
younger siblings haircuts, so it

was only natural for him to fol
low in their footsteps.
"I always cut my own hair,"
Jones said, running his hand
over his close-cropped style.
"Last year I lived in Synergy,
and after people found out I
could cut hair, I gave haircuts to

a lot of my housemates."
This year, one conflict that
has arisen over Jones' haircut
ting in Paloma is where it should
be done. "I was doing it in the
guys' bathroom, but they seemed
very protective of their bathroom
space," Jones said. Now he cuts
the hair of residents in the re
spective bathroom according to
their gender.
"The counter space (in Flo Mo
bathrooms) is perfect. I put out
paper towels and the garbage can
fits right under the sink, so it's
easy clean-up," he said.
Jones' reputation is quickly
spreading across campus. After a
woman in one of Jones' classes
discovered his talent, he picked
up a new customer. He said he is
developing quite a clientele.
Previously a member of the
Stanford a cappella group Mendi
cants, Jones said he provides an
extra bonus for his special
clients. Those people who have
become his "regulars" often find
their appointments livened up
with melodies.
"For them, I sing if I get into
it," Jones said.
Recently, because of his in
creasing clientele, Jones invested
in a pair of special salon scissors.
"I thought about putting out a
donation jar to defray the cost of
the scissors," he said. As of now,
however, his cuts are still free.
Jones thinks he would like to
have professional instruction on
haircutting someday.
"If I had the time, it would be
nice to learn how to do it better.
Right now I'm kind of doing it off
the cuff. I'm not very good at
comb manipulation while I'm
giving haircuts."
