Judge reverses decision
NEW YORK (AP) â€” A federal judge who came under attack
from the White-House on down throwing out a confession and
80 pounds of cocaine and heroin reversed himself yesterday and
reinstated the evidence.
U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. said additional testimony
from police and the defendant caused him to switch his initial rul-
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the rights of
Carol Bayless of Detroit by pulling over her car in New York City on
April 21 because four men around it hurried away when they
noticed police.
Police found the drugs in her trunk. But Baer said in his original
ruling that the evidence was inadmissible because it was only natu
ral in that neighborhood for black men to fear police and run away.
Sen. Bob Dole had said the judge should be impeached, and
House Speaker Newt Gingrich had charged that Baer's ruling was
"the perfect reason why we are losing our civilization."
The White House called the judge's ruling "wrongheaded" and
threatened to ask him to quit. Clinton appointed Baer in 1994.
In his reversal yesterday, Baer apologized for the inference in his
original ruling that it is common to run from police in Manhattan's
gritty Washington Heights section because of past corruption.
