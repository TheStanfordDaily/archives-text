# Two local phone companies merge
## Deal will help companies confront telecommunications competition 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Seems like just yester
day they were Baby Bells and now they're get
ting married.
SBC Communications Inc. and Pacific Tele
sis Group yesterday became the first big local
phone companies to combine, strengthening
their ability to confront new competition in the
revamped world of telecommunications.
SBC will pay $16.7 billion in stock for Pacif
ic Telesis. It's the biggest deal since the phone
business was deregulated in February and
marks the rising star of SBC, which may some
day join the constellation of widely recognized
phone acronyms like AT&T and MCI.
The merger won't mean immediate changes
for employees or the millions of consumers who
buy phone service from the two companies.
There are no plans to raise rates or cut thou
sands of jobs.
But it marks a milepost on a road that
telecommunication companies of all kinds,
driven by the new regulations and technology,
are taking toward providing many services —
local and long-distance phoning, video and data
exchange.
Opponents of the telecommunications

reform object to such mega-deals.
"In the end, we're afraid that just a couple of
companies will have the technology and eco
nomic resources to compete against one anoth
er," said Bradley Stillman, legislative director
of the Consumer Federation of America, an
advocacy group.
The deal between SBC and Pacific Telesis
surprised investors and observers who were
expecting the first merger of Baby Bell compa
nies — the local carriers formed in the 1984
breakup of the Bell System — to be Nynex
Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp.
They combined their cellular businesses last
year and discussed a broader relationship.
"While others are talking about it, we're
doing it," Pacific Telesis chief executive Phil
Quigley said.
SBC and Pacific Telesis first talked more
than a year ago but waited until after the law
passed to negotiate seriously.
The combined company will use SBC's
name, be based in San Antonio and be led by Ed
Whitacre, chief executive officer of SBC.
Quigley will be vice chairman.
The companies will continue to provide the

main phone service in California and Texas,
develop complementary wireless operations
and start a long-distance business.
Customers will not notice a difference until
well after 1997. For instance, the companies
cannot offer residential customers a combined
local and long-distance service until more com
petition develops in the local market.
SBC is the only one of the major Bell carriers
that hasn't slashed jobs in recent years. Pacific
Telesis is about 80 percent finished with a pro
gram started in 1994 to eliminate 10,000 jobs
by the end of 1997.
There is little ch.ince for the companies to
cut costs in equipment and networks since their
main operations are separated by several
states. Pacific Telesis operates local phone ser
vice in California and Nevada. SBC is in
Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and
Texas.
Wall Street analysts expressed some disap
pointment that the deal won't produce signifi
cant cost savings. In late New York Stock
Exchange trading, SBC's stock tumbled $2.87 1
/ 2 to $49.75 but Pacific Telesis stock rose $5.87
1/2 to $33.75.
