# Justices decide on age discrimination

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Supreme Court made the nation's
employers more vulnerable to being
sued for age bias, ruling yesterday
that some lower courts have been
reading a major anti-discrimination
law too narrowly.
The unanimous decision said
employers who fire workers over 40
and replace them with significantly
younger people may be breaking the
law even if the new employees also
are over 40.
The court reinstated an age-bias
claim by a North Carolina man who
was fired at age 56 after his supervi
sor allegedly told him he was "too
damn old for this kind of work."
The federal Age Discrimination
in Employment Act protects work
ers age 40 and over. Federal appeals
courts had split aver. Mifafther any
illegal bias can occur if an employee
iy fired and replaced bv, someone
over 40.
But Justice Antonin Scalia wrote
for the nation's highest court that
the replacement employee's age is
irrelevant.
"The fact that one person in the
protected class has lost out to
another person in the protected
class is ... irrelevant, so long as he
has lost out because of his age,"
Scalia said.
David Gregory, a St. John's Uni
versity law professor who had stud
ied the case, called the decision
"potentially very significant in this
era of corporate downsizing."
"This will force employers to be
more meticulous," he said. "It won't
open any floodgates of new litiga
tion but it will open things up, espe

cially for those who are replaced by
their proteges after training them."
In other action, the court:
—Ruled in a Georgia case that a
death row inmate's first federal
appeal generally cannot be dis
missed as an abuse of the legal sys
tem even if it is filed just before a
planned execution.
—Agreed to use a Mississippi
case to decide whether people whose
parental rights have been terminat
ed must be allowed to appeal even if
they cannot afford to pay the court
fees.
—Said it will review a voting
rights dispute over how municipal
court judges are elected in Mon
terey County, Calif. A decision
could provide important new guide
lines for other local elections
nationwide.
—Rejected an appeal in which
, officials argued thaUjflr
ents do not have a right to sue tneir
state government for not doing
enough to help them collect child
support payments.
In the age-bias case, lower courts
had thrown out James O'Connor's
lawsuit because after being fired he
was replaced by someone aged 40 —
not 39 or younger.
But Scalia said, "The fact that
a replacement is substantially
younger than (O'Connor) is a far
more reliable indicator of age dis
crimination than is the fact that
(he) was replaced by someone out
side the protected class."
Scalia noted that the age differ
ence must be significant, but did not
offer a specific definition of "sub
stantiallv younger."
