# Prosecutors say current trial is their best chance yet of winning a conviction against Kevorkian
## Kevorkian mocks his third assisted-suicide trial

PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) - Dr. Jack
Kevorkian mockingly wore a colonial
style costume to court yesterday for his
third trial on assisted-suicide charges —
a case that may be prosecutors' best
chance yet of winning a conviction.
"If Thomas Jefferson justifies and
endorses and advocates suicide for can
cer, why am I in this courtroom?"
Kevorkian shouted in a white wig, knee
britches, a vest and buckle shoes.
For this trial, held under Michigan
common law, Judge David Breck ruled
that prosecutors must prove only that
Kevorkian knew two women sought to
commit suicide and that he gave them
the means.
Kevorkian has twice escaped convic
tion under Michigan's now-expired

assisted suicide law, enacted by the Leg
islature specifically to stop him. The law
exempted anyone whose intent was to
relieve pain rather than kill.
Kevorkian was acquitted three weeks
ago on charges stemming from two 1993
deaths. And in 1994, he was found inno
cent in another death.
Kevorkian, 67, is charged in the
deaths of Sherry Miller, 43, and Marjorie
Wantz, 58, in 1991. Miller died after
inhaling carbon monoxide, and Wantz
died of an injection. Theirs were the sec
ond and third of the 27 suicides
Kevorkian has helped with since 1990.
Neither of the women was termi
nally ill — and that could also work to
the advantage of the prosecution.
Miller had multiple sclerosis; Wantz

had pelvic pain.
Prosecutor Lawrence Bunting said he
will argue that Miller and Wantz had
other options.
"In this case, you have a lady who had
multiple sclerosis — it was not terminal
at the time — and you have a lady who
the medical examiner testifies there was
nothing physically wrong with her,"
Bunting said. "She had a mental prob
lem."
Bunting said the doctor and his sup
porters are misleading the public.
"Everybody can look at somebody
who is terminally ill and say, 'This per
son needs help,' " Bunting said. "Every
body has sympathy. The question is, in a
free society do you allow someone with
out any constraints to act, as the Ameri

can Medical Association has called, 'a
reckless agent of death?' That's what we
have in Dr. Kevorkian."
Despite Brock's ruling, defense attor
ney Geoffrey Fieger said Thursday he
still plans to show jurors Kevorkian's
"sole intent was to relieve pain and suf
fering." He said the ruling "has abso
lutely no effect on us."
Kevorkian faces up to five years in
prison on each of two counts if convicted.
Prospective jurors were given a 67-
page questionnaire yesterday. Because
of an appeals court ruling obtained by
prosecutors, there was only one question
referring to religion: "Do you have any
philosophical, religious, moral or politi
cal beliefs that forbid a person from com
mitting suicide under any condition?"
