# Umpire collapses at opener
## John McSherry pronounced dead later at hospital 
### 
CINCINNATI (AP) - Baseball's 328-
pound umpire John McSherry died yesterday
after collapsing on the field seven pitches into
the Cincinnati Reds' season-opening game.
"He probably had a massive coronary,"
said Richard Jolson, one of the Reds' doctors.
McSherry, 51, walked away from home
plate and motioned to the other umpires.
Then, in front of the TV cameras, he fell to the
ground near the backstop. He was pro
nounced dead at a hospital about an hour
later.
Reds manager Ray Knight said he was told
by another umpire that McSherry had post
poned a doctor's appointment for arrhythmia,
or irregular heart beat, because of the season
opener.
"He said John was supposed to go get his
arrhythmia (treated) earlier and he didn't want
to do that," Knight said. "He made the state
ment that, 'I'm going to be here opening day
with them and then go get that tomorrow.'"

The hospital said McSherry had scheduled
an appointment for today.
As the game opened, McSherry had been
joking around with Reds catcher Eddie
Taubensee.
"In fact, he said, 'Eddie, you can call the
first two innings.' He seemed to be in good
spirits," Taubensee said.
After the seventh pitch, "(McSherry) just
said, 'Hold on, time out for a second,' "
Taubensee said. "I turned around and said,
'Are you all right, John?' He didn't say any
thing."
Knight said McSherry was considered one
of the more personable umpires, always will
ing to talk things out.
"Whether or not he was right, he was
always fair," Knight said. "He would never try
to overpower you. He was a supportive, solid,
caring umpire."
The game against the Montreal Expos was
postponed until today.
