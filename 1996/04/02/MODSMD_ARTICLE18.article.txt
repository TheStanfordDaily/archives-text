# Few turn out to Freemen's rally

### 
LEWISTOWN, Mont. (AP) - A rally called
to show support for the Montana Freemen
drew eight people yesterday instead of the hun
dreds predicted by organizers, who insisted
their ranks would grow as the week pro
gressed.
The Freemen supporters, outnumbered 4 to
1 by reporters and TV camera crews, held court
at a paint-chipped picnic table in a snow-cov
ered campground west of town.
The rally was held about 120 miles west of
the remote Garfield County farm where the
militants are holed up and surrounded by more
than 100 FBI agents.
Participants said they would remain as long
as the standoff continues and pitched two
small tents at the campground. Organizer Ed
I>eStage predicted attendance would increase
as supporters around the country see news of
the encampment.
"The word is going out," said LeStage, a
spokesman for the Freemen Patriots of the
Northwest, based in Kamiah, Idaho, and —
despite its name — unaffiliated with the Mon
tana Freemen.
"We're here for the duration," he said.
"We'll be staying until the FBI leaves Jordan.
We're in the early stage of a long rally."
Another rally organizer, Chad Erickson, said
the gathering was held in Lewistown because it
is far enough away from the standoff that law
enforcement officials won't be unduly con
cerned. FBI agents have twice stopped a pair of
sympathizers trying to reach the compound.
The Freemen, who have named their 960-
acre compound "Justus Township," deny the
legitimacy of the government and have set up
their own laws and their own courts.
Neighbors said the group has built bunkers
and openly stockpiled food, fuel and weapons
— possibly including military armaments.
The compound has been surrounded by
more than 100 FBI agents since a week ago
today, when Leßoy Schweitzer and Daniel
Petersen Jr., two Freemen leaders, were
arrested.
