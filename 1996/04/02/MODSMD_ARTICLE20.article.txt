## Editorial Evaluation criteria 
### 
The Daily will use these
guidelines when making
special-fee endorsements

THE ASSU SPRING General
Election is fast approaching,
and students will soon be vot
ing on whether to fund each of the
30 special-fee groups on the ballot.
As usual, The Daily's Editorial
Board will make recommendations
on each group based on submitted
budgets and missions. Sometimes
these endorsements are controver
sial, but making them is an impor
tant pail of The Daily's mission.
Many students do not have the
time to fully scrutinize a group's
budget and weigh the costs against
the group's contribution to campus
— and repeat this process 30 times.
For this reason — and to make more
informed endorsements — the Edi
torial Board plans to meet with rep
resentatives of each of the groups
before the election to discuss their
budgets and goals.
At least three of the nine board
members will meet with representa
tives of each group, go over their
budget and ask questions. The
entire board will then discusses
each special-fee applicant and make
a recommendation.
Ideally, these recommendations
help students think more clearly
and critically about student groups
before they vote. The endorsements
are not meant to take the place of
students thinking for themselves,
however. We encourage all voters to
read the Elections Handbook when
it is distributed and look at the
groups' budgets themselves.
To help our readers — and the
student groups in question — better
understand The Daily's recommen
dations, here are the criteria that
will be used to evaluate fee requests.
These are based in pail on the crite
ria listed in the ASSU Bylaws for the
Senate Appropriations Committee,
which makes recommendations on

special-fee groups to the full Senate:
• Does the group provide good
value for the dollar?
• Does the group make a consci
entious and reasonably successful
effort to involve and serve a signifi
cant portion of the student body
population that funds it?
• Does the group demonstrate ini
tiative in self-funding; that is, does
its budget indicate that the group is
actively seeking revenue sources
other than the special fee? Examples
of this include outside fund-raising
or working for the Stanford Fund.
• Has the group responded to its
refund rate and the results of last
year's election? For example, a
group that failed to receive its spe
cial-fee last year — or has experi
enced an unusually high refund
rate — should be able to show how
it adjusted its budget or activities to
better serve its audience.
• Should the student body popu
lation targeted to fund the group's
special fee — not the University, a
different population or other parties
— be financing the group? Consid
ering the recent trend of reduced
University funding for student ser
vices and activities, this is particu
larly important. In addition, last
year's Common Sense Fee Reform
now permits groups to request spe
cial-fee funding from specific sub
populations of the student body; a
group's decision to solicit funding
from only one sub-population, like
undergraduates, should have an
explanation.
Special-fee groups should be
aware that they will be evaluated on
an individual basis, and that these
criteria are intentionally vague and
open to interpretation. For example,
a community-service group which
neither involves large numbers of
students nor targets its services to
the student body might nonetheless
be worthwhile because of the service
opportunities it creates and the pos
itive impact it has upon the commu
nity in which all students live.
The Daily will welcome responses
to its endorsements, and will pub
lish them on a space-available basis
during election week.
