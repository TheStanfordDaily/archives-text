### 
C 1\ /TY NAME'S VANESSA Hua.
|\/l People call me Vanessa
JLVJLHua." I reckon that me and
Forrest Gump have something in com
mon. No, I don't figure that life is like a
box of chocolates. Or that we's both
idiots. We's both footnotes to history,
people who just happened to be There
when it was a Somewhere.
In my case, I stumbled into the frame
of the Real World, the show which pre
sumes to capture real life — that is, the
real lives of seven good-looking youths
in free housing. That year, the show
was set in San Francisco. People across
America were addicted to watching the
cast members hop on cable cars, wander
through the fog, and fight. Pedro, the
charming AIDS activist, was an instant
star of the show.
My 15 minutes of fame began to tick
away when two men spoke on an AIDS
panel in my dorm. Both were HIV posi
tive. They talked of prejudice, problems,
injustice, of their thoughts and feelings
about the tiny virus which had made
such a giant change in their lives. Both
were dynamic people who had decided
not to retreat and die a quiet death. One
was a Stanford graduate, Nick McMil
lan. The other one was Pedro. After
they spoke, they invited us to ask ques
tions.
"How has having HIV changed your
perception of the future?" I asked.
Nick replied that random, unexpect-

Ed moments, like realizing that he
might not be able finish paying for a car
on the three-year installment plan, con
stantly reminded him of his mortality.
Pedro said that he lived every moment
deliberately, savoring every minute. I
mulled over everything they said that
night. Their courage to speak out was
as much an inspiration as what they
said. A few months passed. Then the
show aired.
The editors decided to spare me from
the cutting room floor. The camera
pans around Trancos and, suddenly, I
have my national television debut. I
returned to Stanford and discovered I
was an celebrity. "Hey, weren't you on
The Real World?" "You were that girl
on The Real World!" "Did you know
that you were on The Real World?" As
the re-runs air again and again between
episodes of Beavis & Butthead, people
continue to ask me about a moment
from two years ago.
I had my brush with history. I go on.
For me, the future remains relatively
free. I'm lucky. Pedro died last year. He
eerily lives on in that unchanging cellu
loid world. Pedro can no longer chal
lenge old images or create new ones.
And I wonder about Nick. He had been
to Asia and he met his lover here at
Stanford. That's all I can remember,
those scattered threads of a rich
tapestry. No one ever asks about him;
fame refuses to show what lies beyond

the limelight. I wonder if Nick has also
succumbed to this terrible disease. May
the legacy of their work go on.
I worry though that people forget
once they've changed the channel, once
they've clicked off the set. We all get
caught up in our own lives. History
seems to move mysteriously apart from
us. America's most popular fantasy,
Forrest Gump, succeeded by living in a
blissful idiocy of the events swirling
around him. The starving children of
"We are the World" . . . the survivors of
the Los Angeles riots . . . sufferers of
the civil wars of "no importance." Who
will care for them now, after the cam
eras and fame has left?
Failure to acknowledge our shared
humanity makes our own fate uncer
tain. Our power comes in remembering.
And so a force greater than me pass
es above. I struggle to understand those
events that I live through but cannot
see. I reach back to that time, to redis
cover the truth of that experience, in
The Real World. For a moment, we
breathed the same hush of air. I was
present in their presence.
In my mind, I see them smiling.
