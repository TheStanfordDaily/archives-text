Student dismayed by Athletics Department actions

I HAVE SPENT the last three years of
my Stanford career working in the
Department of Athletics and I have
spent a great deal of personal time and
energy supporting the department in a
variety of ways, so I am somewhat
informed and familiar with the general
workings of the department. I am con
cerned about the recent developments
regarding the funding of the Stanford
Cheerleaders.
I was a little disappointed when I
heard that the department was cutting
off funding to the cheerleaders, because
they are starting to play an important
role in Stanford athletics, but I was
much more dismayed after discussing the
situation with members of the depart
ment's administration. From what I
understand, the funding was not actually
cut off, but the cheerleaders were
encouraged to seek alternative sources of

funding such as the Stanford student
body. Essentially I was told that the Ath
letics Department was not willing to lose
the cheerleaders, but they wanted to see
if they could get someone else to pay for
them. It was also indicated to me that
the Athletics Department felt that the
students should fund the cheerleaders. If
I remember correctly, the cheerleaders
were not a group that was revived at the
request of the students, instead it was
former football head coach Denny Green
and certain alumni who were the
strongest supporters of the squad.
This particular situation is just a
small part of the general image that the
Stanford Department of Athletics is por
traying to the students in general. Cou
pled with the recent decision to charge
admission for certain sporting events,
which is a decision that I support, I get
the feeling that the department looks at

the Stanford student body only as a
source of revenue and not as the back
bone of its fan base.
One of the things that makes Stanford
special is that it has a collection of world
class athletes that participate in many of
the same activities as the rest of the stu
dent body. Compared to other major uni
versities, we do not place our athletes on
a pedestal and isolate them from the rest
of the students. As a result, Stanford
enjoys student support on a wider range
of sports than many other universities.
It is a shame that instead of cultivat
ing a relationship with the Stanford stu
dents, the Athletics Department feels
that the students are a resource to be
exploited. As this trend continues and
Stanford students realize that they are at
the bottom of the department's priority
list, I'm afraid that the widespread sup
port for our athletic teams will diminish.

As hard as the student-athletes at Stan
ford are forced to work in order to keep
up with both the high academic and ath
letic standards, as well as the effort that
numerous students put in to support the
department, usually without any recogni
tion for their services, it is unfortunate
that the department's administration
chooses to alienate the group with which
it should have the closest bond. If we
take this to an outrageous extreme, we
could just double tuition and have the
students subsidize all of the depart
ment's activities.
One of the biggest regrets that I have
as I fmish my Stanford career is that I
have spent so much time supporting a
department that really does not care
about Stanford students.
