# Truman Scholarships article was inaccurate
## 
### 
The Daily's April 1 story "Four Stu
dents Garner Truman Scholarships"
contains two erroneous statements of
fact that should be corrected.
The article states that "Without a
clerical error by the University, two of
the five finalists would not have even
been nominated." Further on one reads
that "Stanford was allowed to enter an
unusual number of candidates this year
because information was miscommuni

cated to two students overseas, who were
then added to the list bringing the total
number of representatives to five, all of
whom subsequently became finalists."
Where the author of this article
obtained this misinformation is beyond
me. There was no "clerical error" by the
University and no "miscommunication
of information" to two students study
ing overseas that somehow played a role
in their being nominated.
The fact of the matter is that in
early 1995 my predecessor, Political
Science Emeritus Prof. Hubert Mar
shall, called the attention of the Execu
tive Director of the Truman Founda-

tion to the fact that many of Stanford's
best students study overseas in their
junior years and are therefore unavail
able for the campus interviews used in
selecting Stanford's three nominees for
Truman finalists. In mid-1995 the Tru
man Foundation gave Stanford one
time-only permission to nominate up to
two such students studying overseas
without a campus interview â€” if the
selection committee judged their candi
dacies comparable in quality to the
three students selected after home cam
pus interviews. Partly to deal with the
increasing phenomenon of juniors
studying overseas, in the future the

Truman Foundation will allow each
school to nominate a total of four candi
dates for Truman Scholarship finalist.
Most importantly, I want to make it
crystal clear that the Stanford student
studying overseas who went on to win
a Truman Scholarship was awarded
this signal honor solely because of the
excellence of his candidacy, not
because of any clerical error or mis
communication of information by
Stanford or anyone else.
