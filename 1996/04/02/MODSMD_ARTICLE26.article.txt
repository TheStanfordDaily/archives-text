QWhy do mirrors flip things left
9 and right, but not up and down?
Alt has always bothered me that
• whenever I look in a mirror, the
• part in my hair is on the wrong
side of my head. It seems strange that a
mirror would switch left and right around,
but wouldn't flip me upside down in the
process. Why is it that a mirror only flips
things left and right, but not up and down?
I mean, besides the fact that no one would
use them if they did.
The explanation is that when you look
in a mirror, it's not really left and right
which are inverted. Instead, the real inver
sion achieved by a mirror is more appropri
ately termed "depth inversion."
What this means is that things that are
close to a mirror appear close to the mirror
on the other side. Conversely, things that
are far away from the mirror, look like
they're really far awav on the other side of

the mirror. When you look in a mirror, it's
not right and left that are inverted, it's for
wards and backwards that are flipped
around.
So, how does this depth inversion make
everything look totally wrong?
Well, try this little experiment in front
of your favorite mirror. Facing the mirror,
hold out your left hand in front of you.
Your mirror image, that person standing
across from you, with a look of true amaze
ment, should also be holding out the hand
which is on your left. Since there is depth
inversion, however, your mirror image's
body appears farther away from the mirror
than your reflected hand does. This makes
it look like your reflected left hand is your
mirror image's right hand.
Now, point at the mirror. You are point
ing away from your body, yet your reflec
tion is pointing right back at you. This is
what has actually changed — forward for
you is backwards for your reflection. The
left-right inversion that everyone
attributes to mirrors actually comes from
this depth inversion.
In your mind, you are rotating your

mirror image 180 degrees so that both of
your conceptions of forward match up. In
doing so, you have flipped around your
mirror image's left and right sides, so you
think left is right and right is left. Up and
down, though, still remain the same, so
you don't perceive any up and down flip
ping.
The great thing about this experiment
is that you can try it with anything that
you can look at in a mirror, including your
roommate's left hand, your next door
neighbor's left hand or even your favorite
historical figure's left hand. I wouldn't
choose one of the Chipmunks, though. I
don't think you can tell their fingers
apart.
With over 5 billion people in the world,
the possibilities are almost endless! No
matter whose hands you look at in the mir
ror, their hands will appear reversed. The
oretically, this should also work for right
hands, but that is beyond the scope of this
article.
While we're speaking of mirrors, hands
and science, have you noticed that the
reflection of your left hand, which should

look very similar to your right hand, is
noticeably different from the original? This
doesn't just happen for any object, though.
Most things, like ping pong balls, Styro
foam peanuts and the Olsen twins, are
indistinguishable from their mirror
images.
But certain objects — like hands,
corkscrews, slinkys, scissors and expensive
sports cars — look different when reflected
in a mirror. Any object which cannot be
superimposed on its mirror image possess
es a special quality railed "handedness."
Sometimes, this is also referred to as "chi
rality," usually by chemists who are talk
ing about tiny molecules which possess the
same quality.
Interestingly enough, these chiral
molecules which chemists deal with play
an important part in biology. It turns out
that almost all biological chemicals come in
specific chiral configurations, the molecu
lar equivalent of either right-handed or
left-handed.
One of the most commonly used exam
ples of chiral biological chemicals are the
two forms of carvone. The two are chemi

cally identical, except that one is the molec
ular mirror image of the other. One form
of carvone is the main flavoring compo
nent in the caraway seed, which gives rye
bread its unique flavor. The other form of
carvone is the chief ingredient in
spearmint oil. Not surprisingly, the com
pound tiistes very much like spearmint.
The huge difference in the smell and taste
of the two chemicals is derived solely from
the chirality of the two chemicals. As you
can see, chirality is a pretty powerful thing.
Without it, life on earth as we know it
couldn't exist. With it, we can build
slinkys.
As a final word of advice, if you ever
meet some people who look a lot like you
but with their hair parted on the wrong
side of their head, do not take any
spearmint gum from them. It doesn't taste
very good.
