## Baseball captures fifth straight win No. 13-ranked Cardinal shuts out San Francisco State 11-0 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Stanford

In recent weeks, Stanford right
fielder Joe Kilburg has tried to
simplify the game of baseball as
much as he can.
That philosophy has worked
wonders, as the sophomore col
lected two more hits last night in
the No. 13-ranked Cardinal's 11-0
victory over non-conference oppo
nent San Francisco State.
With the two base hits, Kilburg
extended his hitting streak to
eight games and raised his batting
average to .343. During his streak,
which ties the career-high he set
last year, Kilburg is 16-for-36
(.444) with 15 RBIs and 15 runs
scored. Kilburg has already posted
career-best totals in home runs (4)
and RBIs (23).
"I'm seeing the ball pretty well
and just trying to make my swing
as simple as possible," Kilburg

said. "I've set my hands back far
ther in the swing and widened out
my feet to eliminate body move
ment to get my hands right
through the zone."
Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess spoke highly of Kil
burg's recent play.
"He's been great since the
break — ever since finals were
over, he's really swung the bat
well," Marquess said. "He's really
helped us offensively, being on
base all the time."
As in the past few games, Kil
burg was one of many contribu
tors to the Cardinal's impressive
offensive team totals. Stanford
has tallied at least 10 hits in eight
consecutive contests. The 11 runs
marks the third time in four
games Stanford has plated more
than 10 runs.
Center fielder Jody Gerut con
tributed with the bat once again,
matching Kilburg's eight-game
hit streak with a triple in the first
inning. (ierut scored the first Car
dinal run on a wild pitch later in
the frame. In the fourth inning,
the freshman tripled and scored
again as Stanford (21-12) took a
comfortable 6-0 lead. In the last
eight games, Gerut has hit .395, rais
ing his batting average 37 points
from .266 to .303.
Starting pitcher Mario Iglesias
(6-1) was the first of four Cardinal
hurlers who kept the Gators off the
basepaths for most of the evening.
Iglesias gave up the only two hits
manage*! by San Francisco State
(14-18), as the bullpen pitched mag
nificently. Throe relievers faced the
minimum 18 batters in six innings,
allowing only one base runners on a
walk by Tom Reimers in the ninth.
Brendan Sullivan, John David
Brammer and Reimers each tossed
two innings, as the Cardinal pitching
staff notched its sixth shutout of the
season, matching its 1995 total.
Marquess was able to use his
bullpen exactly as planned, and was
pleased with the staffs perfor
mance, which has been consistently
solid over the past two weeks.
"It worked out great. We wanted
to give all those guys a short outing
so they'll be ready to go fort his week
end," Marquess said. "We wanted to
play today rather than tomorrow —
if we got rained out today, we'd be
too close to Thursday [versus Ari
zona State], so we wanted to get the
game in today and the weather coop
erated."
Stanford benefited from three
Gator fielding errors which led to
four unearned runs. The Cardinal
put the contest out of reach with a
five-run outburst in the fifth inning,
sending nine men to the plate.
After second baseman Brian Dal
limore led off the inning with a
ground-out, San Francisco State
pitcher Martin Cole walked Luke

Quaccia. A ground ball by Josh
Hochgesang was misplayed by
shortstop Jorge Marias and Stan
ford's John Salter followed with an
RBI single. Macias committed his
second error of the inning on a
grounder off the bat of Eric Sees be
fore Kilburg smacked a single, dri

ving in two. After Gerut struck out
looking, pinch-hitter Troy Kent plat
ed Kilburg with an RBI double.
"There are a few things we would
have liked to do better, but when you
beat a team 11-0, you can't com
plain," Kilburgsaid. "We're trying to
k(>ep our strikeouts down, and we

struck out five times tonight. We
also have set team goals like scoring
in more t ban four innings in a game
tonight we scored in four but left
the last three frames with zeros."
Nevertheless, the Cardinal won
for the seventh time in eight games,
includinga season-high five in a row.
