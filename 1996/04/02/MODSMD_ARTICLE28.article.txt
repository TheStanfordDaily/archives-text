## Baseball captures fifth straight win No. 13-ranked Cardinal shuts out San Francisco State 11-0 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer

In recent weeks, Stanford right
fielder Joe Kilburg has tried to
simplify the game of baseball as
much as he can.
That philosophy has worked
wonders, as the sophomore col
lected two more hits last night in
the No. 13-ranked Cardinal's 11-0
victory over non-conference oppo
nent San Francisco State.
With the two base hits, Kilburg
extended his hitting streak to
eight games and raised his batting
average to .343. During his streak,
which ties the career-high he set
last year, Kilburg is 16-for-36
(.444) with 15 RBIs and 15 runs
scored. Kilburg has already posted
career-best totals in home runs (4)
and RBIs (23).
"I'm seeing the ball pretty well
and just trying to make my swing
as simple as possible," Kilburg

said. "I've set my hands back far
ther in the swing and widened out
my feet to eliminate body move
ment to get my hands right
through the zone."
Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess spoke highly of Kil
burg's recent play.
"He's been great since the
break â€” ever since finals were
over, he's really swung the bat
well," Marquess said. "He's really
helped us offensively, being on
base all the time."
As in the past few games, Kil
burg was one of many contribu
tors to the Cardinal's impressive
offensive team totals. Stanford
has tallied at least 10 hits in eight
consecutive contests. The 11 runs
marks the third time in four
games Stanford has plated more
than 10 runs.
Center fielder Jody Gerut con
tributed with the bat once again,
matching Kilburg's eight-game
hit streak with a triple in the first
inning. (ierut scored the first Car
dinal run on a wild pitch later in
the frame. In the fourth inning,
the freshman tripled and scored
