# Softball stumbles over spring break
## 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
Leis, luaus, and beaches were
all part of the equation that
equaled Stanford Softball over
the past three weeks, as the Car
dinal traveled to a tropical par
adise during Dead Week for the
University of Hawaii Softball
Invitational. The Stanford slug
gers then enjoyed a one-week
hiatus from competition to
focus on finals before facing sev
eral top-ranked schools over the
break.
The Cardinal went 5-7 (in
cluding the trip to Hawaii) to ex
tend its record to 17-16 overall,
3-7 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
The tournament in Hawaii was
by far Stanford's most success
ful venture of the three-week
period. The Cardinal was seeded
first in the tournament after
three days thanks to key victo
ries over No. 15 Hawaii, No. 18
New Mexico State and a team
from Tokyo, but lost in the
semifinal game to Hawaii 1-0.
Tanned from its tropical ex
cursion, Stanford returned to
campus with eight days to pre
pare for Pac-10 rival Washing

ton, the No. 2 team in the na
tion. But the Huskies proved
overpowering, as the Cardinal
lost both games, 7-0 and 3-0.
Despite the crushing losses to
Washington on March 26, Stan
ford bounced back the next day
at Cal State-Fullerton. The Car
dinal split two games with the
fifth-ranked Titans, winning 2-
0 in the opener before falling 3-0
in the nightcap. Unfortunately
for Stanford, the opener against
the Titans would prove the only
victory of the break, as the Car
dinal was swept 3-2, 7-0 by San
Diego State on March 28.
Stanford head coach Sandy
Pearce was pleased with her
team's performance in Hawaii.
"The Hawaii tournament was a
really good tournament for us,"
she said. "We played good soft
ball; we were consistent and
solid."
But Pearce's outlook was not
as positive about the rest of the
break. "We came out flat
[against Washington]," she
said. "We've been playing up
and down lately. We didn't come
out to play, and it showed."
Young players are what
Pearce considers to be part of
the problem. She says the team
is experiencing "growing pains"
despite her hope that the team
would have adjusted and been
playing well regularly by this
point in the season.
Pearce said, "It's frustrating.
We can do anything we want to,
but [with us] it's day to day.
Hopefully, we will get over that
soon."
Losses have been the result of
inconsistent play so far, but
Stanford will need to get over
the ups and downs soon. This
weekend the women are off to
Arizona to play No. 1-ranked
Arizona and Arizona State. Most
important for the Cardinal at
this point is run production —
Stanford struggled at the plate
over the break, getting shut out
five times.
Against Washington, the Car
dinal bats never even got warm.
Husky pitcher Stephanie Burns
was perfect through five innings

before walking two en route to a
no-hitter in the first game. In
the second game Stanford man
aged three hits but never put a
string together for a score. In
fact, the Cardinal put a runner
in scoring position only once in
the 3-0 shutout.
The team's year-long hitting
woes continued against the
Aztecs of San Diego State. Stan
ford actually out-hit SDSU
seven to four in the first game
but was not able to produce the
needed runs, as the Aztecs
jumped out to a 2-0 lead en route
to a 3-2 victory. In the closer,
San Diego State capitalized on 8
hits and two Stanford errors to
post a decisive 7-0 victory, as the
Cardinal managed only four
hits.
Outstanding pitching on the
part of Stanford freshman
Becky Blevins keyed the Cardi
nal's victory over the Titans.
Blevins worked nine scoreless
innings, giving up just four hits
and one walk while striking out
eight Titan batters.
The extra-inning duel was fi
nally decided in the ninth when
the Cardinal scored two runs on
RBI hits by freshman Shane An

derson and junior Amanda
Renteria.
Renteria also helped spark
the Stanford offense in Hawaii

best choices in the
batter's box. We're

— Sandy Pearce

with a run and two RBIs in a 5-2
victory over Bowling Green. As a
team, the Cardinal enjoyed a
.300 batting average in the tour
nament, thanks in large part to
the performance of the fresh
men. Kelly Yablonski, Marcy
Crouch, and Jennie Foyle com

bined for a .520 batting average
through the first three Stanford
victories.
Blevins and Foyle were both
named to the All-Tournament
team, Blevins as the All-Tourna
ment pitcher and Foyle as an in
fielder.
Looking ahead, an obvious
concern for Pearce is the team's
inability to produce runs.
"We're not making the best
choices in the batter's box," she
said. "We're getting one or two
hits an inning, but we're not
putting it together and explod
ing [offensively]."
Stanford will need to combine
solid hitting, pitching and de
fense if it hopes to upset Arizona
this weekend. The Wildcats sit
atop the Pac-10 and currently
hold the No. 1 ranking in the na
tion. Their most recent victories
include a sweep of defending na
tional champion UCLA.
ASU will also pose a threat to
the Cardinal. Stanford is only 3-
7 in the Pac-10 and the Sun Dev
ils are a top-25 team. Hopefully
for the Cardinal, hitting woes
and growing pains can be over
come before the season enters
the home stretch.
