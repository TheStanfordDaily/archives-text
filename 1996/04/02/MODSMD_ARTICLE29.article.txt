# Softball stumbles over spring break
## 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
Leis, luaus, and beaches were
all part of the equation that
equaled Stanford Softball over
the past three weeks, as the Car
dinal traveled to a tropical par
adise during Dead Week for the
University of Hawaii Softball
Invitational. The Stanford slug
gers then enjoyed a one-week
hiatus from competition to
focus on finals before facing sev
eral top-ranked schools over the
break.
The Cardinal went 5-7 (in
cluding the trip to Hawaii) to ex
tend its record to 17-16 overall,
3-7 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
The tournament in Hawaii was
by far Stanford's most success
ful venture of the three-week
period. The Cardinal was seeded
first in the tournament after
three days thanks to key victo
ries over No. 15 Hawaii, No. 18
New Mexico State and a team
from Tokyo, but lost in the
semifinal game to Hawaii 1-0.
Tanned from its tropical ex
cursion, Stanford returned to
campus with eight days to pre
pare for Pac-10 rival Washing

ton, the No. 2 team in the na
tion. But the Huskies proved
overpowering, as the Cardinal
lost both games, 7-0 and 3-0.
Despite the crushing losses to
Washington on March 26, Stan
ford bounced back the next day
at Cal State-Fullerton. The Car
dinal split two games with the
fifth-ranked Titans, winning 2-
0 in the opener before falling 3-0
in the nightcap. Unfortunately
for Stanford, the opener against
the Titans would prove the only
victory of the break, as the Car
dinal was swept 3-2, 7-0 by San
Diego State on March 28.
Stanford head coach Sandy
Pearce was pleased with her
team's performance in Hawaii.
"The Hawaii tournament was a
really good tournament for us,"
she said. "We played good soft
ball; we were consistent and
solid."
But Pearce's outlook was not
as positive about the rest of the
break. "We came out flat
[against Washington]," she
said. "We've been playing up
and down lately. We didn't come
out to play, and it showed."
