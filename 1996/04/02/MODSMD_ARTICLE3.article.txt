# Student service offices have new homes

Call it a game of musical office space.
Students returning from spring break found
the offices of Dean of Students Marc Wais and
Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds in different locations.
Edmonds' office recently moved into the
portion of Tresidder Union abandoned by the
Department of Computer Science following the
opening of the Gates Computer Science Build
ing In turn, Wais' office moved into the office
formerly occupied by Edmonds' office, on the
second floor of Tresidder near the spiral stair
case. Finally, the Financial Aids Office now gets
the entire third floor of the Old Union, which it

formerly shared with Wais' of
fice.
Got all that? If not, read it
again really slowly.
"We've been on two differ
ent floors or in different build
ings for years," said Cynthia
Rife, assistant director of fi
nancial aids. "We're excited to
have the staff all on one floor at
last. We hope it will be easier
for the students."

Wilis also expressed excitement at the move.
"I think the prime motivating factor in the move
was for the dean of students to be more accessi
ble to students. The third floor of the Old Union
tended to be somewhat ivorv-towerish in the

way of student traffic."
Wais also noted that it will help his office
work more closely with the Office of Student Ac
tivities, allowing for more "natural collabora
tion" between the offices.
"So far, it's been fun," he said. "It was espe
cially fun not having to walk to the cafeteria in
the rain (yesterday)."
However, Wais said he really misses his view
from the third floor of Old Union.
Though students currently may have
headaches from keeping track of all of the mov
ing, it is indeed intended to help students out by
making the offices more accessible. The moves
also correlate nicelv with a scheduled remodel-

ing of the financial aids area of Old
Union.
The remodeling, which Rife said
should be complete by the begin
ning of next fall quarter, is expect
ed to make the Financial Aids Of
fice more efficient and more acces
sible to students.
Plans for the remodeling in

clude lower information windows
more accessible to disabled stu
dents and a conference room that
can be used for such events as loan
information sessions, Rife said.
She also noted that financial aid
files will finally be on the same
floor as the offices, which will in
crease efficiency.
"We're excited, because it gives
us an opportunity to rethink how we
can get information and counseling
to students in a much better, more
flexible configuration," Rife said.
