# Volleyball completes a perfect March
## Cardinal tops Pepperdine, Loyola Marymount to stretch win streak to seven 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
At the end of Februaiy, the Stan
ford men's volleyball team was 7-5
overall and falling fast in the na
tional polls. With a four-match los
ing streak to boot, it appeared the
men wouldn't even qualify for post
season play.
What a difference a month
makes.
The Cardinal completed an un
defeated March by knocking off
Pepperdine on Friday night (15-10,
16-17,15-5,5-15,17-15) and Loyola
Marymount (13-15, 15-4, 15-7, 17-
15) on Saturday in a pair of home
matches. These wins, along with
three-game victories over Califor
nia, Ohio State and La Verne, put
Stanford at 13-5 overall and 10-5 in
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion play, good for third in the divi
sion. The Cardinal has also climbed
back into the top five nationally,
placing fifth in last week's poll.
"We've looked good, even domi
nant," said Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves.
Stanford displayed its domi
nance in game one against Pepper
dine. Riding the strong play of ju
nior middle blocker Mike Hoefer
and sophomore middle blocker
Keenan Whitehurst, the Cardinal
racked up 20 first-game kills. The
men also played sound defense,
forcing the Waves into seven errors
while holding them to a .267 hitting
percentage. Brushing off a late Pep
perdine rally, Stanford pulled away
for the easy win.
The Cardinal continued its
strong play in the second game,
jumping out to leads of 8-1 and 14-7.
But suddenly things fell apart, as
the men fell into the same bad
habits that hurt them during their
losing streak. Bad passes, hitting er
rors and Pepperdine's increased de
fensive pressure allowed the Waves
to roar back and snatch a victory to
even the match at one.
The Jekyll-and-Hyde antics con
tinued in games three and four.
Stanford put on a clinic in the third
game, polishing off Pepperdine in
18 minutes while nailing 16 kills,
hitting .481 and holding the Waves
to a .091 hitting percentage. Pep
perdine came back to steamroll the
Cardinal in game four by the same
score in only 24 minutes. The
Waves had 19 kills and only one
error, good for a blistering .667 hit
ting percentage. Stanford hit just
.184.
As a result, the Cardinal found
itself in the quick-rally game five
against a team it should have fin
ished off two games earlier. The
men jumped out to leads of 5-0 and
11-7, but the "Cardiac Cardinal" al
lowed Pepperdine to side out for its
eighth point, igniting a spurt that
put the Waves up 12-11. Eventually
the Cardinal pulled ahead and com
pleted the victory on its third match
point.
"We had them in the coffin, let
them out, but we came through,"
