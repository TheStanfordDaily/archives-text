# Women's tennis gets revenge
## Cardinal downs No. 8 Texas to avenge last year's NCAA loss 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The No. 2 Stanford women's tennis squad was all
business this vacation, rolling over archrival No. 8
Texas in Austin in a lopsided 7-2 victory.

The Cardinal (15-1 overall, 3-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division) jumped out to an early 4-2 lead
in singles play and clinched its fifth consecutive dual
match victory with a win in the No. 1 doubles contest.
Stanford went on to sweep the doubles competition
from the Longhorns (12-3) before 532 spectators under
the lights at the Penick-Allison Tennis Center.
"This was a nice step in the right direction," said
head coach Frank Brennan. "Obviously, whenever you
play one of your archrivals Like Texas, it's always great
to win, and to beat them on their home court is even
sweeter.
"It was a big-time atmosphere, and I thought our
team stepped up and responded really well. I was really
proud of them."
With the 7-2 win, the Cardinal avenged two of its
three losses last season. In 1995 dual-match competi
tion, the Longhorns ended Stanford's long-standing
home winning streak in March with a 6-3 win. Even
more significantly, Texas ended the Cardinal season in
the semifinals of the NCAA tournament by a 5-1 score,
sending Stanford home while the Longhorns went on
to win the national title.
Brennan says those losses were definitely on the
minds of the Cardinal women.
"I think that was a good motivating factor," the
coach said. "I've seen this team play their best when
they're out for revenge, when they've got something to
prove."
With finals behind them and no academic worries in
the back of their m inds, Brennan also thought the team
was able to concentrate better on the match.
"I think the girls were more relaxed and less
stressed about school," said Brennan. "They were fo
cused quite well. I definitely think that has something
to do with it. I think we are that kind of team; we are
very academically-oriented. That's why I almost think
we play better on the road. You get away from school
and you're in a little envelope with your team."
Stanford's All-Americans led the way at the top of
the singles lineup. Sophomore Ania Bleszynski (12-4),
the No. 10-ranked player in the nation, started slowly

against No. 13 Farley Taylor in the
No. 1 match, but bounced back to
win 3-6, 6-2, 6-1.
"Ania was awesome," Brennan
said. "She started off a little ner
vous in the first set. It's one thing to
not be nervous and win, but I think
it's even more impressive to be
tense and to not get it going and to
slowly work yourself out of that.
Ania was able to hang in there and
get it turned around in the second
set and then in the third set she was
running the girl off the court. She
came full circle."
Junior Katie Schlukebir (12-3)
also earned the Cardinal a point on
the No. 2 court versus Cristina
Moros. Schlukebir, No. 14 in colle
giate singles, won a tight match in
straight sets, 6-4, 7-5.
"Katie played a great match,"
Brennan said. "It was probably her
best match of the year, beating a
good player in a nice, solid perfor
mance. She kept herself together
real well."
Stanford found similar straight
set success at the bottom of the line
up in the No. 5 and No. 6 singles
matches. Sophomore Julie Scott
(13-1) rolled over Nomena Rasolo
malala with a 6-3,6-1 win at the No.
5 position. Redshirt senior Amy
Chiminello (14-1) had even less
trouble with Anne Pastor in the No.
6 match, winning 6-1, 6-0.
The Longhorns received their
only points of the entire match in
the middle of the lineup. At No. 3,
Texas's Melody Falco, a transfer
from Arizona, defeated junior San
dra De Silva (12-2) in the Stanford
junior's first straight-set loss of the
season, 6-4, 6-4. De Silva jumped
out to early leads in both sets, but
could not close the door on Falco.
"Sandra is a very good player but
she will have matches like that,"
Brennan said. "It wasn't about her
forehand or her backhand or what
ever. It's about how she competes.
When you 're up 4-1, you have to fin
ish them off and then you're in
great shape."
Redshirt senior Kim Shasby
took the first set at the No. 4 slot,
but Longhorn Laura Berendt re
bounded for a three-set win, 5-7, 6-
1,6-4.
"I'm looking forward to a good
spring quarter out of [Kim]," Bren
nan said. "The good news is that it
has nothing to do with her tennis.
She is hitting the ball great and

she's healthy, so it's just a matter of
her relaxing and keeping her stress
level under control."
The Cardinal was even more
dominant in doubles play with
three straight-set triumphs. The
No. 1 doubles team of Bleszynski
and Schlukebir (5-3) cruised to a 6-
2, 6-1 victory over Taylor and
Moros, the fourth-ranked doubles
team in the nation.
"Again, they played their best
match of the season," Brennan
said. "They played the No. 4 team in
the country, won 6-2, 6-1, and it
wasn't even that close. They were
just awesome. They're a big power
team and everything was working."

ford's No. 2 squad, eked out a 7-5,7-
6 (3) win over Falco and Berendt.
Meanwhile, Rasolomalala and Pas
tor were no match for an unbeaten
Stanford tandem on the No. 3
court. Junior Emily Burt and se
nior Beth Berris (3-0) took the
match 6-4,6-3.
The defending champion Long
horns, who have fallen from No. 2
to No. 8 in the rankings since the
beginning of the season, were miss
ing one player from their lineup,
Sandy Sureephong. The Ixmghorn
freshman, ranked No. 16 national
ly, usually competes at the No. 2
singles position.
"They had a player out of the
lineup, but it is my experience that
those things don't really matter,"
Brennan said. "Everybody just
steps up and does a little better."
The Cardinal will now dive head
first into Pac-10 Conference action
with all seven remaining matches
against conference foes. First up for
the Cardinal are No. 7 UCLA and
No. 14 USC in Los Angeles this Fri
day and Saturday, respectively.
Stanford will play four consecutive
road matches before returning to
Stanford Tennis Stadium on April
17 versus California.
