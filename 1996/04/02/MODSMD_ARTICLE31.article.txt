# Women's tennis gets revenge
## Cardinal downs No. 8 Texas to avenge last year's NCAA loss 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The No. 2 Stanford women's tennis squad was all
business this vacation, rolling over archrival No. 8
Texas in Austin in a lopsided 7-2 victory.

The Cardinal (15-1 overall, 3-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division) jumped out to an early 4-2 lead
in singles play and clinched its fifth consecutive dual
match victory with a win in the No. 1 doubles contest.
Stanford went on to sweep the doubles competition
from the Longhorns (12-3) before 532 spectators under
the lights at the Penick-Allison Tennis Center.
"This was a nice step in the right direction," said
head coach Frank Brennan. "Obviously, whenever you
play one of your archrivals Like Texas, it's always great
to win, and to beat them on their home court is even
sweeter.
"It was a big-time atmosphere, and I thought our
team stepped up and responded really well. I was really
proud of them."
With the 7-2 win, the Cardinal avenged two of its
three losses last season. In 1995 dual-match competi
tion, the Longhorns ended Stanford's long-standing
home winning streak in March with a 6-3 win. Even
more significantly, Texas ended the Cardinal season in
the semifinals of the NCAA tournament by a 5-1 score,
sending Stanford home while the Longhorns went on
to win the national title.
Brennan says those losses were definitely on the
minds of the Cardinal women.
"I think that was a good motivating factor," the
coach said. "I've seen this team play their best when
they're out for revenge, when they've got something to
prove."
With finals behind them and no academic worries in
the back of their m inds, Brennan also thought the team
was able to concentrate better on the match.
"I think the girls were more relaxed and less
stressed about school," said Brennan. "They were fo
cused quite well. I definitely think that has something
to do with it. I think we are that kind of team; we are
very academically-oriented. That's why I almost think
we play better on the road. You get away from school
and you're in a little envelope with your team."
Stanford's All-Americans led the way at the top of
the singles lineup. Sophomore Ania Bleszynski (12-4),
the No. 10-ranked player in the nation, started slowly
