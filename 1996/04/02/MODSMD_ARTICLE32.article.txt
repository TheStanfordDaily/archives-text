# Track team breaks in newly renovated facility with a win
## Stanford outscores Air Force, Irvine, Wisconsin women 
### Sam Wang Contributing writer 
The Stanford track and field team may not
have won any national championships or partici
pated in any Final Fours, but it still had a busy
spring break with two competitions 011 campus to
christen the newly-renovated Cobb Track and
Angell Field.
The inauguration of the new facilities took

place March 22-23 at the Stanford Invitational,
where 37 colleges and universities, 75 high
schools and numerous Olympians competed in
the two-day event.
The Cardinal athletes were not shy about join
ing in the festivities, posting a total of 55 season
bests and eight NCAA provisional qualifying
marks. But no one topped Sarna Renfro's perfor-
mance in the 5,000-meter run.
Renfro blazed to a time of
16:09.84, which not only automat
ically earns her a trip to the NCAA
championships, but is also good
enough to qualify her for the U.S.
Olympic Team Trials in June.
"We had a heck of meet," said
head coach Vin Lananna. "We
had eight provisional NCAA
qualifiers [in one weekend] and
we didn't have eight qualifiers
last year. Right now we have a
total of 11 qualifiers, which is
more than we've had in the last
five years."
The celebration for Stanford
continued the subsequent week
end, when the Cardinal held its
first head-to-head competition at
its new home, hosting Air Force,
UC-Irvine and the Wisconsin
women's squad.
The Cardinal men captured
the team competition title with a
score of 185 to 151 over second
place Air Force. The Stanford
women also had similar success,
topping the Lady Badgers of Wis
consin 216 to 185.
The men easily controlled the
meet, winning 10 of 19 events
and placing at least one person in
the top three in all but one con
test. Perhaps the most surpris
ing aspect of the victory was the
dominating performance of the
Cardinal sprinting corps.
Sophomores Damon Dunn
and Anthony Bookman finished
one-two in the 100, with Dunn
coming in at a wind-aided 10.64.
Dunn then came back to place
second in the 200 behind junior
Jimmie Johnson, who also cap
tured top honors in the 400 with
a season-best time of 47.02.
The Stanford sprinting squad
topped off its day with another
fine performance, dusting the
field in the 4 x 100 relays. An
chored by Johnson, with Dunn,
Bookman and freshman Jauron
Pigg running the other legs, the
crew raced to a time of 41.44, yet
another season best. All four
members of the relay squad be
long to the football team.
"We're very fortunate to have
a good group of football guys who
are also track people. That's a big
boon for us," said Lananna of his
sprinters.
The meet also marked the re
turn of redshirt junior Pete

Swanson, who had been out since
late last season with a broken
foot. Swanson, who also plays
football in the fall, will provide
leadership and lots of points with
his shot put and discus throws.
Swanson placed third in the
discus with a throw of 155 feet, 2
inches and second in the shot put
at 57-1 1/2 — not bad for his first
mAnf naplf
"To throw 57-2 and hitting
the Pac-10 standards in the first
meet is pretty good and that's the
first time he's put the shot in a
year," said Lananna.
However, there is still plenty
of room for improvement if
Swanson is to qualify for the
NCAAs and maybe even for the
Olympic Trials, as Lananna ex
pects of him.
"His timing is off and there
are some things he has to work
on," he said. "He's strong but the
shot put is an event where your
timing needs to be down. It
shows up in the discus, where he
hasn't thrown nearly as far as he
is going to.
"In a couple of weeks he
should be doing great."
In the women's competition,
the jumpers and sprinters con
tributed mightily to the Cardinal
victory in an impressive display
of team balance.
Sophomore Bernadette Ar
mand finished first in the 100-
meter hurdles with a time of
14.58. The triple jumpers also
stepped up, with freshmen Jen
Test and Mandy Clayton and
sophomore Rhonda Witmer
sweeping the top three spots.
Stanford's powerful middle
distance and throwing squads
also pitched in with wins by red
shirt sophomore Monal Chokshi
and freshman Mary Cobb in the
1,500 and 3,000, respectively.
Both posted NCAA provisional
qualifying marks. Sophomore
thrower Sami Jo Small hit the
double-whammy by winning
both the discus and the javelin.
"I think overall, we have a
very strong women's team and
I'm pretty fired up about the bal
ance of our team," Lananna said.
Stanford will try to carry the
momentum from these victories
into Eugene, Ore., next weekend
when it faces some tough compe
tition in the form of Oregon and
Washington State. Both schools
should give the Cardinal a good
gauge of where they stand rela
tive to the rest of the Pacific 10
Conference.
