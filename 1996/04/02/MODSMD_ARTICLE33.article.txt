# Stanford remains sports' elite
## 
### 
I remember when I got into
Stanford, my friends who were
set to go to big time sports uni
versities like Texas and Michigan
made fun of me for Stanford's lack

of any powerhouse sports teams.
"Not true!" I would protest, cit
ing the numerous NCAA champi
onships that Stanford sports teams
bringhomeeach year. "Yeah," they
would respond with a chuckle, "but

you guys only win championships
in sports like water polo and swim
ming; you suck in big time sports
like football and basketball."
For my first two-and-a-half
years on the Farm, even during last
year's record-tying five NCAA ti
tles, I sat in silent pride as my
friends talked of Sugar Bowls and
Rose Bowls, knowing all the time
that in any given month Stanford
can win more national champi
onships than all of their schools
combined.
I did take solace this year in the
football team's improvement, but
trying to convince somebody from
Memphis that the Liberty Bowl
means anything is harder than
convincing Olympic ticket agents
that New Mexico is in the United
States. I reveled in the fact that the
Cardinal men's hoops team adi

vanced further In the NCAA tour
nament than both Texas, Michi
gan, and even my hometown Mem
phis Tigers.
However, I did not reach my
Stanford sports comfort zone until
last week when I found myself,
ironically, at the University of
Michigan to report on the women's
national swimming champi
onships.
It was at that meet, which Stan
ford won for the fifth-straight year,
that I discovered that winning a na
tional championship is winning a
national championship — no mat
ter what the sport.
Granted I was spoiled — I am
sure the swimming championships
wouldn't have been as exciting or
as fun if Stanford wasn't destroy
