# Stanford remains sports' elite
## 
### 
I remember when I got into
Stanford, my friends who were
set to go to big time sports uni
versities like Texas and Michigan
made fun of me for Stanford's lack

of any powerhouse sports teams.
"Not true!" I would protest, cit
ing the numerous NCAA champi
onships that Stanford sports teams
bringhomeeach year. "Yeah," they
would respond with a chuckle, "but

you guys only win championships
in sports like water polo and swim
ming; you suck in big time sports
like football and basketball."
For my first two-and-a-half
years on the Farm, even during last
year's record-tying five NCAA ti
tles, I sat in silent pride as my
friends talked of Sugar Bowls and
Rose Bowls, knowing all the time
that in any given month Stanford
can win more national champi
onships than all of their schools
combined.
I did take solace this year in the
football team's improvement, but
trying to convince somebody from
Memphis that the Liberty Bowl
means anything is harder than
convincing Olympic ticket agents
that New Mexico is in the United
States. I reveled in the fact that the
Cardinal men's hoops team adi

vanced further In the NCAA tour
nament than both Texas, Michi
gan, and even my hometown Mem
phis Tigers.
However, I did not reach my
Stanford sports comfort zone until
last week when I found myself,
ironically, at the University of
Michigan to report on the women's
national swimming champi
onships.
It was at that meet, which Stan
ford won for the fifth-straight year,
that I discovered that winning a na
tional championship is winning a
national championship — no mat
ter what the sport.
Granted I was spoiled — I am
sure the swimming championships
wouldn't have been as exciting or
as fun if Stanford wasn't destroy

Hut the Cardinal's season had all
the drama of Kentucky's champi
onship run.
The women started as an under
dog in this year's NCAA title race,
despite carrying a 51 dual-match
win streak and the last four NCAA
crowns into the season. Like any
good team should do, though, the
team used its newfound underdog
status as a motivational tool rather

than a detriment.
The Cardinal swimmers rolled
through the majority of the season,
but faltered for the first time in
years, when USC beat Stanford
just before the Pac-10 champi
onships. The women bounced
back, though, and despite success
fully defending their Pac-10 title,
approached the NCAA finals still
an underdog.
That's where I came in and was
lucky enough to witness the swim
ming clinic that the women put on
at Michigan's Canham Natatori
um. The women's title run embod
ied everything that sports should

be, even without all the press, all
the glitz and glamour of "March
Madness," and even without CBS
screwing up the television coverage
of the meet.
I watched as the team's seniors
— Lisa Jacob, Jane Skillman, Jessi
ca Tong and Maureen McLaren
excelled to ensure the team cham
pionship. I watched as Claudia
Franco and Amy Oberhelman
swam career bests in their respec
tive events to contribute to the
team's point total. And I got to
watch as a team came toget her and
won with pride, dignity and humil
ity — all of which my friends most

likely missed.
I'd be lying if 1 wrote that I do
not wish for a Rose Bowl bid for the
football team and a NCAA Elite
Eight trip for the men's basketball
next year. But for now, I am con
tent to gloat about Stanford's mul
tiple national championships and
make fun of my friends' schools for
not having any swimming, water
polo, tennis, volleyball, women's
basketball or gymnastics power
houses.
And, ultimately, I will smile as
Stanford receives its second
straight Sears Director's Cup .at
the end of this year.
