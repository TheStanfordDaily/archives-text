# Engineering Dean Gibbons honored

James Gibbons spoke modestly at a recent
awards ceremony honoring his life's achieve
ments, including the development and inven
tion of two procedures which have become in
tegral to the production of semiconductor
chips and have earned him two prestigious
awards.
"If there was ever an award that should be
received by an extended group of students,
this would be it," said Gibbons, dean of the
School of Engineering, as he accepted the
Semiconductor Industry Association's Uni
versity Research Award during the associa
tion's annual meeting in Washington, D.C.,
last Tuesday.
The Semiconductor Industry Association is
a group that tries to represent the interests of
the semiconductor industry. They support re
search at various labs and universities, includ
ing Stanford, which has been granted several
research contracts by the organization.
The association chose Gibbons as its sec-

ond annual award recipient because of his
contributions to the semiconductor industry,
including his research and his own and his
students' work establishing pioneering new
companies.
"The most significant research that my stu
dents and I did over the past few years was our
work with ion implantation, which we worked
with from 1965 to 1975," Gibbons said.
Gibbons said the process, which introduces
an electric charge to a semiconductor chip,
"has become common technology now." This
process is used on almost every semiconductor
chip three to four times during production.
"There are other ways to add a charge to
chips, but this process adds precision and con
trol, which at the time was necessary to ad
vancement," Gibbons said.
"The ion implantation process is sort of an
atomic shotgun," he explained. "The problem
with the process is that it microscopically
tears the crystal."
Gibbons and his team of students fixed the
problem by inventing a procedure which
heats the surface of the crystal and "very ac-

curately mends the tears on the surface," he
explained.
Two companies, one of which was formed
by team of Gibbons' graduate students and
the other by Gibbons himself, sell equipment
related to this process.
Gibbons said it was "fun" receiving the
award from keynote speaker William Perry,
the secretary of defense and a fellow Stanford
professor with whom Gibbons has enjoyed a
long relationship.
Gibbons will also receive the American
Electronics Association's Medal of Achieve
ment on April 30. This award honors lifetime
achievement.
Gibbons, who has been at the University
for 39 years, will step down as dean in May.
"I think it's time for new leadership," he
said. "It's always necessary to have new ideas
and new leadership, and 10 years, though I've
been dean almost 12, seems the right amount
of time before that occurs."
Gibbons will stay on as a professor and will
assume the title of counsel to the president
for industry relations.
