## For secret to aging, talk to the baboons 
### Wai Fung Kwok 
Baboons have something to
teach us about growing old
gracefully.
According to new studies by
Assoc. Biology Prof. Robert
Sapolsky, the missing ingredi
ent to a recipe for "successful
aging" may be plain old friends.
For almost 20 years, Sapol
sky has spent his summers
studying the behaviors of a pop
ulation of wild baboons in the
Serengeti of East Africa. His re
search suggests that how the
baboons lived their youthful
lives might determine the qual
ity of their later years.
According to Sapolsky,
"These studies, along with
other research, suggest how dif
ferent personalities (in hu
mans) translate into different
degrees of success." Sapolsky is
using interaction and aging in
baboon society to parallel simi

lar conditions in human society.
In the most old-world pri
mate societies, including those
of the baboons, females spend
their entire lives in the troop
that they were born into while
the males usually leave the
troop around puberty to join
other troops.
However, as Sapolsky ob
served, there is another time
when male baboons transferred
troops again — old age. This is
seemingly an unwise move
given that there are predators
lurking everywhere as the old,
feeble baboon searches across
the savanna for his new home.
Why should the senior baboon
ever risk his life like this when
he already has a home, Sapolsky
asked.
Data from Sapolsky's studies
suggest there is actually a pret
ty good reason for leaving — the
