## For secret to aging, talk to the baboons 
### Wai Fung Kwok 
Baboons have something to
teach us about growing old
gracefully.
According to new studies by
Assoc. Biology Prof. Robert
Sapolsky, the missing ingredi
ent to a recipe for "successful
aging" may be plain old friends.
For almost 20 years, Sapol
sky has spent his summers
studying the behaviors of a pop
ulation of wild baboons in the
Serengeti of East Africa. His re
search suggests that how the
baboons lived their youthful
lives might determine the qual
ity of their later years.
According to Sapolsky,
"These studies, along with
other research, suggest how dif
ferent personalities (in hu
mans) translate into different
degrees of success." Sapolsky is
using interaction and aging in
baboon society to parallel simi

lar conditions in human society.
In the most old-world pri
mate societies, including those
of the baboons, females spend
their entire lives in the troop
that they were born into while
the males usually leave the
troop around puberty to join
other troops.
However, as Sapolsky ob
served, there is another time
when male baboons transferred
troops again — old age. This is
seemingly an unwise move
given that there are predators
lurking everywhere as the old,
feeble baboon searches across
the savanna for his new home.
Why should the senior baboon
ever risk his life like this when
he already has a home, Sapolsky
asked.
Data from Sapolsky's studies
suggest there is actually a pret
ty good reason for leaving — the
current ruling gang treats the old
fellow horribly. Baboons subject
ed to the most brutal treatments
during their elderly years are like
ly to be the high-ranking males of
the troop back in their prime.
His studies showed that elderly
males who were once dominant
figures in the troop were subjected

to twice as many harassments as
the senior newcomers. Given this
fact, the better question might be:
Why should half of the elderly
males choose to stay and be bru
talized by his own relatives?
Sapolsky found that for the se
niors that do stay, they all have an
unique quality that allows them to
endure the rough times. They all
have friends in the troop, in par
ticular, female friends. The in
tense male-male competition pre
vents them from being close thus

these males form friendships with
females.
When Sapolsky compared the
elderly males that stayed in the
same troop to those that left, the
former all had "long-lasting"
friendships.
Other studies have suggested
that these males placed friendship
at a high priority throughout their
prime years. These males were
willing to stop fighting other
males for high ranks in their
primes in order to put more effort

into forming better friendship
with females. These are males
who have "worked hard to become
part of a community," according
to Sapolsky.
So does this behavior of aging
baboons provide any lessons for
humans?
"There is actually much evi
dence showing that men who have
more close friends in their old age
do "better" — they live longer,
have fewer medical complications,
are happier by their own estimates

and have less incidence of depres
sion," Sapolsky said. "You might
think that there is a confound —
men who are less healthy are not
able to be as socially active and be
able to have friends — but this has
been controlled for."
However, for women, these
studies suggest a somewhat differ
ent twist. "In contrast, studies
show that more successful aging
occurs in women who, rather than
just have more friends, have bet
ter quality of friendships," Sapol

sky said. "The sense is that this re
flects the fact that for women,
merely having more 'friends'
often means having more people
they are stuck having to care for."
Indeed, many gerontologists
today think that "successful
aging" requires more than just
eating right and getting enough
exercise. Performing small, incre
mental steps — such as building
enduring friendships — through
out one's life is as crucial as any
preventive medicine, he said.
