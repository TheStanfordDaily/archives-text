Mistakes in
calculating
budgets for
groups receiv
ing ASSU spe
cial fees may
delay the spring

general election or even make a
special election necessary.
When submitting their bud
gets to the senate, many of this
year's groups followed improper
procedures, calculating expenses
incorrectly or failing to provide
line-item summaries, according
to Deputy Senate Chair Bill
Shen.
The problems were discovered
late, leaving Shen, a member of
the ASSU Appropriations Com
mittee, only a few days to make
all the corrections.
Shen must submit the budgets
by noon today in order for elec
tion handbooks to be printed on
schedule.
According to ASSU Bylaws,
election handbooks must be dis
tributed to students seven days
before the general election. If the
handbooks are not distributed by
the required time, the election
cannot be held.
Shen is confident the mistakes
can be corrected bv the deadline.

"I would characterize this as a
minor technicality that the finan
cial office caught," he said. "The
budgets were returned so we
could clear up the mistake."
Undergraduate senator Steve
Russell attributed the mistake to
a failure on the part of the Appro
priations Committee.
"The ASSU charges the Ap
propriations Committee with
evaluating and computing fig
ures," he said. "The implicit as
sumption is that these are calcu
lated correctly. If the Appropria
tions Committee doesn't do its
job, the special-fee process ceases
to be effective."
If Shen is unable to finish the
corrected budgets by noon today,
a separate election for special-fee
requests might be held.
However, a special election for
special fees could be unconstitu
tional, according to Russell.
Russell said it is specified in
the bylaws that special-fee re
quests must be voted on in the
general election.
Elections commissioner Ryan
Medders agreed that ASSU By
laws specify that a separate elec
tion for fee requests could not be
held, but he said the language
specifying this rule was vague.
"The senate has the power to

interpret its own constitution,"
he said.
Medders said the ASSU Elec
tions Commission is operating
under the assumption that only
one election will be held.
In a separate development,
members of the Elections Com
mission voted to put the Chapar
ral's Council of Presidents slate,
"Dictators from Space," on the
spring general election ballot.
Members of the slate charac
terized their exclusion from the
ballot as "pretty absurd."
"What we did was a minor vio
lation," said senior Sean
Kennedy, a member of the slate.
The slate had been denied

placement on the ballot because it
did not fill out the header infor
mation for each petition when col
lecting the 200 signatures neces
sary to place it on the ballot, ac
cording to Medders.
However, the Elections Com
mission determined that students
were still able to understand what
they were signing without the
header information.
"Even though some of the
header information was not filled
out, an informational page was at
tached which didn't prevent a stu
dent from understanding what he
or she was signing," Medders said.
Members of the slate called
their slate's placement on the bal
lot a victory for student rights.
"Placing us on the ballot shows
that Stanford respects the right of
every student â€” even the ones
from outer space," Kennedy said.
