After 24 years, departing Judi
cial Affairs Officer Sally Cole has
officially spent her last day at
Stanford.
"It's bittersweet," Cole said of
her departure. "I've learned a lot
of wonderful things, and I've met
lots of wonderful people. But now
I am spending time doing some
thing different and exciting."
Dean of Students Marc Wais
said his office expects to name an
acting judicial affairs officer by
the end of the week. Because of
potential upcoming changes by
the Committee of 15, which was
named to review the University's
judicial and legislative proce
dures, his office plans on naming
only an interim replacement.
"We believe that it is not in
everyone's best interest to con

duct a national search when
things are most likely to change
within the next year," he said.
Cole left Stanford to give more
time to the Center for Academic
Integrity. She serves as the execu
tive director of the privately fund
ed organization, which was
founded in 1992 to "help colleges
and universities develop a viable
network for sharing information
about academic integrity, policies
and procedures."
The Center for Academic In
tegrity is a consortium of more
than 100 colleges and universi
ties, including Stanford. It spon
sors an annual conference and
also distributes various material
to participating schools to pro
mote academic integrity, accord
ing to Cole.
Cole said Stanford needs im
provement most in the area of
student and faculty involvement.
"Stanford needs much more in
the way of student and faculty
input," she said, citing the exam
ple of the Student Judicial Coun
cil, which she said has met only
three times in two years.
"On paper, there is student in
volvement, but in reality there is
none," she said.
Cole cited schools such as Rice
University, UC-Davisand the Uni
versity of Maryland as examples of
schools that successfully use stu

dent-faculty interaction. She said
university organizations that act
in honor code enforcement roles
usually move on to education and
prevention roles as well.
Wais said he is optimistic about
Cole's future.
"I think she left the University
for an exciting opportunity," he
said. "In that respect, I am de
lighted for her. Stanford really ap
preciated her years of service and
her knowledge of the campus. In
that respect, it is a loss."
Cole had served as judicial af
fairs officer since 1982. She previ
ously served as the assistant to
the provost in Academic Plan
ning, as well as the director of re
search for the Study of Education.
