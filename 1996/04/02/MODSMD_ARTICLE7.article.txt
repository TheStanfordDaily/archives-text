## Stanford Jews to celebrate Passover 
### Pascale Goupillaud 
The beginning of spring quarter is traditionally a
busy time in the lives of most students. In addition
to paying bills, choosing classes and comparing
spring breaks, many Jewish students on campus as
sume the added responsibility of participating in
seder, the traditional Passover dinner ceremony.
Passover celebrates Israel's deliverance from
Egyptian bondage, said Ari Cartun, rabbi for the
Hillel Foundation, the Jewish community center on
campus. The week-long holiday is traditionally set
aside for thinking about the meaning of freedom.
Because first-night seders are usually held in the
home, most of the student leaders are accustomed to
participating in fairly small family seders led by
older family members.
"At home, I always followed whoever led the seder
in my family," said sophomore Emily Gestrin, co
leader of one of the seders. "It's going to be fun to
share the seder with the whole campus and get input
on how other students do things differently in their
own seders."
Junior Nicole Marmon, who led seders last year,
said, "I think the student-led services bring students
closer together and allow them to enjoy Passover on
a more personal level. I think that's what's so great
