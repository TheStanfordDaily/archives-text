## Stanford Jews to celebrate Passover 
### Pascale Goupillaud 
The beginning of spring quarter is traditionally a
busy time in the lives of most students. In addition
to paying bills, choosing classes and comparing
spring breaks, many Jewish students on campus as
sume the added responsibility of participating in
seder, the traditional Passover dinner ceremony.
Passover celebrates Israel's deliverance from
Egyptian bondage, said Ari Cartun, rabbi for the
Hillel Foundation, the Jewish community center on
campus. The week-long holiday is traditionally set
aside for thinking about the meaning of freedom.
Because first-night seders are usually held in the
home, most of the student leaders are accustomed to
participating in fairly small family seders led by
older family members.
"At home, I always followed whoever led the seder
in my family," said sophomore Emily Gestrin, co
leader of one of the seders. "It's going to be fun to
share the seder with the whole campus and get input
on how other students do things differently in their
own seders."
Junior Nicole Marmon, who led seders last year,
said, "I think the student-led services bring students
closer together and allow them to enjoy Passover on
a more personal level. I think that's what's so great

about the whole concept.
There will be four different
seders conducted by students,
said Cartun. These include the
conservative (traditional) seder,
the more modern reform seder, a
graduate student seder and a
seder led by members of the Jew
ish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi.
Cartun said students have
been helping to organize seders
for several years now under his
leadership. Each year, Cartun se
lects students to lead the services
and conducts classes teaching stu
dents how to lead the seder.
"The classes have taught me a
lot about the seder that I didn't

know before — not just about how
to lead it, but also about how the
seder works and its meaning,"
said Gestrin.
Classes also include learning
more about the Haggadah, which
is the actual text of the seder, and
learning how to create supple
ments to the seder service.
"I've learned a lot that I didn't
expect to learn, especially a lot of
new stories and interpretations
to take away with me. Passover
means a lot more to me now,"
said senior Mike Nagin, leader of
a second-night seder.
The other leaders said leading
the service is a much more mean
ingful experience than following
along.
" I 've been going to seder since I
was little, but it means a lot more
to me now that I'm leading. It's a

lot more active process than I've
ever approached the seder with
before," said senior Katie Fried
man, leader of a second-night
seder.
All the leaders agreed that
learning how to lead the seder is a
valuable experience, a skill that
they will be able to use their en
tire lives.
"This is something that I'm
going to be able to carry with me
my whole life, so that someday
when I have my own family, I'll
know how to lead the seder," said
Gestrin.
"I'm looking forward to being
able to do the same things when I
have a seder at home," echoed ju
nior Oren Ahoobim, co-leader of
the conservative seder.
Sophomore Ben Sussman, co
leader of the reform seder, cited

the importance of seder as a "com
munity-oriented holiday." Suss
man said he looks forward to
being able to make his service en
joyable for his fellow students.
"For me, Passover has al
ways been the most enjoyable
Jewish holiday," said Sussman.
"It's very unreligious — very
much a community-oriented
holiday. It's very enjoyable for
me. You don't have to be Jewish
to enjoy Passover."
The student-led seders are
open to the Stanford community.
They are scheduled for tomorrow
and Thursday, beginning at 5:45
p.m. in various campus locations.
For students, the price is $ 10 and
for non-students, it is $35. Those
interested should go to Hillel to
make reservation or call 723-
1602 for information.
