We didn't think we could make it any easier to surf the Net.
■IssSs&W- J
Today, more students are using Macintosh'
computers to share ideas on the Internet
than any other computer. No small wonder,
either. Because with a Macintosh there are
no complicated commands needed to get
up and surfing on the Net. So in a matter
of minutes you can be on-line accessing
the exciting new universe of the Internet.
(Not to mention prospective employers.)
And right now, buying a Mac" is as easy as
using one. For a limited time, we're offer
ing special campus savings on selected
Macintosh computers and Apple'printers.
So visit us today, and look into the power
of Macintosh. The power to be your best?
But we just did.
