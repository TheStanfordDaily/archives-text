Josh Dapice M hat Triple Threat Major Economii \
What do you do when you can't decide among three sports? If you are triathlete Josh
Dapice, you compete in all of them. A typical week for Josh includes five swims of
5,000 yards, live seven mile runs, and four two hour bike rides. He is coached b\ the
Masters Team coach, which gives him the opportunity to work out with Masters triath
letes. He is also a Pledge Marshall for the Sigma Nu fraternity. This past November, Josh
placed second out of all Americans (and 18th in the world) in the World Junior
Championships in Mexico. Josh has also raced in Japan, New Zealand and the Bahamas, not
to mention around the United States —he criss-crossed the country 13 times attending com
petitions last year. He is currently in training for next month's Collegiate Nationals in Lake
San Antonio, California.
Andrew Martinez-Fonts H Inn I Itiwale s \// l Major I'roJiu tDi
Andrew Martinez-Fonts is in his tirst season on the Stanford Men's I Itimate Team, better
known as SMUT. He original 1> hoped to play on the volleyball team, and, as a three sport
athlete in high school (baseball, soccer, volleyball), planned to walk-on as a member of the
Cardinal spikers. Little did he know he would soon find himself happily shutting down passes
and snaring disks, rather than bumping serves and spiking halls. When Andrew isn't practicing
his forehand Frisbee pass, he's working on his craft as a graphic designer. While still in high school.
Andrew found design work in the marketing department of a mutual fund company, and has been
putting his artistic skills to good use ever since. Nowadays, Andrew \s art can be seen campus-wide: he
creates graphics for the Stanford Daily, dorm T-shirts, uniforms, anil posters for campus events like the
Big Game Gaieties. His proudest artistic achievement? The poster for this year's Winter One
Acts. Or maybe it's the designs he occasionally applies to Frisbees. It's a toss
up.

50 faster than ever: The Chicago Bulls reached fifty wins faster
than any team in US sports history, but to Scottie Pippen, what mat
ters most is capturing another NBA title. Pippen, an Ail-American
when he played college ball, was only 6' 1 " when he graduated
from high school. Hard work and another six inches helped him
become a versatile threat at both ends of the court. As a
pro, the hard work continues —while most players relax in the
off-season, Pippen works out almost every day. Pipp's
plans? After winning the championship, he has two things on
t his mind: power boating on Lake Michigan and preparing for
Dream Team 111 at the Summer Olympics.
Tennis stars support the Women's Tennis Team as the
Cardinal takes on the USC Trojans on April 19th at 1:30 PM.
In fact, show up and you can do more than just root for your
team —you can get some great NIKF. stuff. Here's how: look
for the NIKE table set up with tennis gear to transform you into
an Andre Agassi look-alike. Everyone who comes
over to the table gets a Swoosh headband and a
chance to look like a reigning superstar. But
don't worry—you don't have
to match the
famous haircut.
Flip, vault,
pommel. The Cardinal
Men's Gymnastics team
hosts the NCAA National Championships
on Saturday, April 27th. You should be there to
support your team and to win some cool NIKE stuff. Just
look for your NIKE student rep and show her your tumbling
talents -you're sure to get a *10' and free NIKE stuff.
Aussie standout Cathy Freeman is a rising star
international track and field cosmos. The 22 year old Australian
first caught the world's attention at the 1994 Commonwealth
Games in Canada. Her win in the 200 m made her the
first Aboriginal Australian to win a Commonwealth title.
She celebrated hv unfurling the indigenous Aboriginal
flag—a daring demonstration of her ethnic pride. But.
when she went on to capture the 400 m crown, she
added an Australian llag. Wrapped in the two flags.
Cathy made a bold statement about national
racial reconciliation. Watch for her this summer!
