Introducing Two New
Columbia University Programs
at Biosphere 2
Biosphere 2 is a mini-campus, world renowned tor its 3.15-acre research facility
enclosing a collection of diverse ecosystems, from rainforest to desert. On fan 1, 1996,
Columbia University joined Biosphere 2 to build and guide its research, education
and visitor programs. Two new undergraduate programs in the earth and
environmental sciences are now offered that immerse students in the
multidisciplinarv stud\ of the environment and provide a base of environmental
knowledge for future decision makers.
Summer Field Course in Earth and Environmental Science. This six-week, six
credit course gives students practical and state-of-the-art experience in field
techniques used in environmental research. Biosphere 2's unique global change
research facility, together with the geological and ecological resources close by —
including Meteor Crater, the Grand Canyon and the Sonoran Desert — provide a
broad view of methods used to understand past, present and future Earth system
problems. Course begins May 20, 1996.
Earth Semester. This four-and-a-half month, 16-credit course of study offers
students an integrated approach to the physical, biological and human aspects of the
environment. Studying with Earth scientists, biologists, anthropologists, economists
and political scientists, students will receive a multi-faceted view of the natural world
and of human society as an agent of environmental change. The program is designed
to foster a sense of how to "manage" human activity to maintain or improve quality
of life for all species on the planet. Course begins Sept. 1996.
