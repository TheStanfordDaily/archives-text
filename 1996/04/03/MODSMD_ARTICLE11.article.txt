FBI investigates clubbing
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The FBI
opened a civil rights investigation yester
day into the videotaped clubbing of two
illegal immigrants, and the Mexican gov
ernment condemned the beating as a "fla
grant violation" of the rights of its citizens.
Sheriffs deputies clubbed the immi
grants Monday after chasing a battered
pickup crammed with people suspected of
sneaking across the border. TV news heli
copters captured the beating on video in
broad daylight.
During the chase, the pickup reached
speeds of 100 mph, its shabby camper top
disintegrating in the wind to reveal the
people crammed inside.
"People inside were throwing things at
officers in the chase and at other cars, hit
ting some of them," sheriffs Sgt. Mark
Lohman said yesterday.
The truck finally stopped on the side of
the freeway and the passengers ran away.
One deputy, holding his baton two
handed like a baseball bat, was video
taped clubbing the driver on the back and

shoulders, even as the driver fell, face
down, on the ground.
When a woman got out of the cab, the
same deputy beat her in the back with the
baton, then grabbed her by the hair and
pulled her to the ground. At least one
other deputy struck her with his baton.
Possible grave sites surveyed
VLASENICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) â€” War crimes experts began yester
day to investigate the thawing fields of
eastern Bosnia, believed to contain the
remains of thousands of Muslims alleged
ly massacred by Serb fighters.
U.S. forces are to protect the investiga
tors in Serb-controlled areas from Srebreni
ca to Zvornik, where experts from the inter
national tribunal for former Yugoslavia are
seeking evidence of wartime atrocities.
The fields around the destroyed town
of Srebrenica have come to symbolize the
horror of Bosnia's war. Authorities
believe the spring thaw may yield proof
that up to 7,000 Muslims were killed
there by Serb fighters in July.
