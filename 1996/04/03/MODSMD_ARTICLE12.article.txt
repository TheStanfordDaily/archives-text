# Clinton implicated for loans
## Witness says president gained from illegal Whitewater transaction 
### 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - Asmall
time banker at the center of the White
water case testified yesterday that he
secretly loaned $300,000 in the mid
1980s to then-Gov. Bill Clinton and his
Whitewater partner James McDougal.
It was the first time that it has been
alleged publicly and under oath that the
president benefited from an illegal
Whitewater-related transaction.
Clinton's personal lawyer, David
Kendall, said the president stood by his
previous denials of any wrongdoing. He
would not comment specifically on the
new allegations.
The White House would have no com
ment, spokeswoman Mary Ellen Glynn
said.
The exact amount Clinton is alleged
to have received was not immediately
clear from the testimony, but the wit
ness, David Hale, said that he had agreed
at one point during his discussions with
Clinton to lend him $150,000.
Hale did not say what the money was
for.
Asked about the possibility of criminal

charges against the president in light of
Hale's allegations, W. Hickman Ewing
Jr., a Whitewater prosecutor, said: "I'm
not going to say. We're still evaluating
the overall investigation. ... We're not
making a comment on who knew what
when."
Hale said that he, Clinton and
McDougal agreed at a meeting in early
1986 that Hale's lending company would
make a $150,000 loan on paper to
McDougal's wife, Susan, but that the
money would go to Clinton.
Hale testified that Clinton said, "My
name can't show up on this" and McDou
gal responded, "I've already taken care of
that."
He said McDougal called him after the
meeting and told him to boost the loan to
$300,000 and make it payable to Mrs.
McDougal's marketing business.
The witness said that he made the
loan and that the money ultimately went
to James McDougal and Clinton. Ewing
said documents to be introduced later
would show where the money went.
Hale had said previously outside court

that he made the $300,000 loan to Mrs.
McDougal after Clinton pressured him.
However, Hale did not immediately testi
fy yesterday about any such pressure,
and the president has branded the alle
gation "a bunch of bull."
Hale is the government's star witness
in the fraud trial of the McDougals and
Gov. Jim Guy Tucker. The three were
charged by the Whitewater prosecutor
with obtaining $3 million in federally
backed loans under false pretenses. The
$3 million includes the $300,000 loan to
Susan McDougal.
Bobby McDaniel, Susan McDougal's
lawyer, said: "What you heard from
David Hale today is a different story than
what he's said before. It's a fabrication,
period, that this money was to go to Bill
Clinton. Bill Clinton is his meal ticket to
a lighter sentence."
According to Hale, Clinton offered at
the 1986 meeting to put up as collateral
some land in Marion County, where
Whitewater was — Clinton did not men
tion Whitewater — but James McDougal
said that would not be necessary.
