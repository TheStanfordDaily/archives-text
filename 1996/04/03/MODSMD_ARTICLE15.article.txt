Packard's legacy of giving
should act as a standard
for alumni and community

MANY AFFECT Stanford in
various ways, but few go
beyond the rest and give
back to the University more than
they received in experiences at the
Farm.
David Packard, who passed
away last week at the age of 83,
was a man whose contributions
exceeded his fiscal generosity.
Along with his long-time business
partner, Bill Hewlett, Packard
helped build Stanford into a world
class university.
The legacy he left for the Uni
versity has been compared to that
of its founders, Leland and Jane
Stanford. From the new Science
and Engineering Quad and the
Lucile Salter Packard Children's
Hospital to the Terman Engineer
ing Fellowships and the Terman
Engineering Center, Packard has
changed the face of Stanford.
His contributions have some
times taken less visible forms. As a
member of the Board of Trustees
for 15 years, Packard lent his wis
dom to many generations of Stan
ford administrations.
In his actions, Packard estab
lished a tradition of giving to pri
vate universities, which rely heavi
ly on alumni support to maintain
the high quality of education they
offer. Tuition only covers about
half of a Stanford education, with
the rest of the funds coming from
other sources, including alumni
donations.
Unfortunately, Packard's strong
lead in this area is not being fol
lowed as widely as one would hope.
According to the Chronicle of Phi
lanthropy survey of the nation's
wealthiest communities in 1994,
Silicon Valley ranked 39th in dona
tions by corporations and individu
als compared to income levels.

The dearth of giving from Sili
con Valley is partially caused by the
fact that many of the area's compa
nies are fairly new. In the rapidly
changing high-technology indus
try, profits are by no means stable.
However, personal giving from the
surrounding community is also low
compared to other regions.
While corporate giving should be
made a priority, it is also clearly the
responsibility of individuals to do
their part and give back to a com
munity which has given them the
ability to prosper. For Silicon Val
ley, this can mean supporting Stan
ford programs, which not only
enrich the community but educate
those who may participate in its
companies in the future.
Packard and his wife, Lucile
Salter, are among the top givers to
Stanford. Their gifts rank among
the largest in the nation to private
universities.
Even though the Packards' gen
erosity is something which few
people have the financial means to
match, the message of their gen
erosity is nonetheless relevant. In
an area with a large population of
highly educated, financially secure
people, more can be done to help all
kinds of non-profit institutions.
Packard did not confine his philan
thropic efforts to Stanford. His
foundation has one of the largest
endowments in the country, and
his contributions have gone to
fund diverse projects such as the
Monterey Bay Aquarium.
One of the main sources of
funding for all educational institu
tions — the government — is
becoming less able to help. The
current budget-cutting mentality
in Washington has manifested
itself at Stanford, causing layoffs
at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center and reducing funding for
research in the School of Engi
neering.
Without the help of private indi
viduals who follow the lead of peo
ple like Packard, the United States'
greatest asset — its higher educa
tion — will relinquish its lead in
the world.
