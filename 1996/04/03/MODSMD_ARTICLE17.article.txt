## The 						danger of bipolarization 
### 
I SPENT PART oflast week standing
beside a frosty highway in Oregon
holding a simple sign: "Save Enola
Hill Old-Growth From The Salvage
Rider." As I stood there surrounded by
other activists, hundreds of cars drove
by and everyone had something force
ful to say. Some pumped their fists out
their windows and honked their horns
in salute; others gave us the finger or
slowed down and cursed our mothers.
The rally was part of an effort to
save Enola Hill, a small ancient forest
that's probably horizontal on a boat
heading across the Pacific this morn
ing. More importantly, the rally was an
attempt to bring to light the issues sur
rounding the Timber Salvage Rider — a
bill Clinton signed into law nine
months ago that has dramatically
increased clearcutting of our public
forests. However, as the rally went on,
it became clear to me that rallies, the
newspaper articles they generate and
even public outreach are completely
futile with this issue. Logging in the
Northwest has become so polarized
that trying to change someone's opin
ion on it is like trying to cut steak with
a plastic butter knife. People either
believe the myth that environmental
ists spike trees or that loggers would
bulldoze small children for a dollar and
a quarter. No one is changing sides.
Logging in Oregon, no matter how
polarized, is just another example of

bipolar opposition destroying rational
discourse and consensus decision-mak
ing in this country. Bipolar opposition is
the process of dividing everything into
two polarly opposite camps: black and
white, Democrat and Republican, good
and evil, loggers and owls, citizens and
immigrants. Bipolar opposition makes
processing information easier, but it
nullifies consensus and leads to soma
tization, stereotypes and conflict.
For example, our government shut
down not because there are giant ideo
logical rifts between Republicans and
Democrats (personally, I think they are
simply two different mouths of the
same corporate ogre — one mouth has
fangs, the other just pincers) but because
representatives stood adamantly along
party lines instead of searching for con
sensus. Even in their statistical analy
ses, each party exaggerates the worst
part of the other's statistics and dis
torts everything to an extreme. This
pattern is true of nearly every conflict
in this country.
If the conflict over logging in Oregon
or the budget — doesn't make sense
to you, consider immigration in Califor
nia. For example, in Monday's San
Francisco Chronicle there was a letter
to (he editor that started off saying,
"it's beyond me how anyone can say
California is not being hurt by legal
immigration." The letter then proceed
ed to list problems from highway litter

to public education to graffiti under the
assumption that immigrant "vagrants"
were responsible. People have taken
such strong stands on the issue that
they see evidence supporting their
views, no matter how absurd, wherever
they look. Just watch what happens
with the news of Monday's illegal immi
grant beating. People who are anti
immigrant will believe the police offi
cers were acting in self-defense trying
to stop the flood of immigrants crossing
our borders. Others will believe inno
cent victims were savagely beaten by
brutal police. The truth will be lost in
the crossfire.
If presented with all the facts of the
Salvage Rider, specifically its ridiculous
anti-liability provisions, 90 percent of
the population would probably oppose
it. However, if Congress passed a law
banning all logging in the United
States, most environmentalists would
blindly support it — just as we blindly
support the Endangered Species Act
and Superfund cleanups with no
grounding in most forms of logic.
As Robert Kennedy once said, "It is
easier to fight than to think." It's unfor
tunate that we all follow that dictum.

Nick Thompson shaved his head so no
one can recognize him.
