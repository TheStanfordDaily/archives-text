# Colleen Krueger: Left of center
## White gloves and bows — it's Cotillion all over again 
### 
Yesterday i saw a big group of
frosh women having a picnic in front
of their dorm. It looked as though it
might rain at any moment, so they were
huddled together in sweatshirts and polar
fleece, optimistically drinking crayola-yel
low lemonade on a blanket in the damp
grass. One of them had a little disposable
camera, and spent the whole time yelling,
"Everybody get together! Closer for the pic
ture!" They all rolled their eyes but put
their heads close together and grinned for
the camera, the way girls do in those kinds
of pictures.
I thought the scene was a little sad.
Next week, everything will be different
for my funny, determined picnickers.
Freshman year — as they know it — is
most likely over, whether they like it or not.
Next week is Sorority Rush.
Things will get better, for some. Others
may have a rough couple of weeks ahead of
them. Maybe they won't even know if
things are better or worse, just that they're,
we 11... different, and they can't go back to
the way it was before.
I came to Stanford pretty much decided

that the Greek system was like a gigantic
Cotillion — a big, evil dinosaur of an insti
tution. Somehow, college women were con
vinced to juf' re each other using the same
scorecard ol uperfieial characteristics men
have l>eon using to rate us for years. I was
highly suspicious of the whole process and
of anyone involved in it.
I've learned a lot since then, mostly that
many of my initial assumptions were
wrong. It came as quite a shock to me that
sorority women are the backbone of the
Women's Center, and of many women's
organizations on campus. The same
women who seemed vaguely sinister parad
ing from tent to tent in black formals fresh
man year have become personal role mod
els as activists and spiritual leaders, as
mentors and friends.
I've also realized that most people who
grumble about the evils of the Greek sys
tem have no qualms about drinking free
beer every weekend, and no complaints
about attending a university with a far
more vibrant social scene than other highly
academic schools without fraternities and
sororities. And I'm the first one to condemn

the University's sneaky practice of shining
up to Greek alumni and their donations
while quietly milking life hell for actives,
particularly housed fraternities.
Most importantly, 1 really like most of
the sorority women I know. In my best Pat
Buchanan, "Some of my best friends are
sorority women." And I envy the strong
mid copious female friends they all have.
Sometimes I feel like I'm at a real disad
vantage, working hard to overcome my own
anti-social tendencies and meet half the
interesting women they have at their fin
gertips.
But ... I still cringe at the memory of
the white tents. I have this one lingering
problem. A little qualm that no Greek panel
ever made me feel exactly right about it.
That Heather Dunn and all her minions
don't really talk about. That my ex-sorori
ty-president roommate could never quite
explain it to my satisfaction.
I think it's mean.
I can't quite get over the exclusivity of
the whole thing. It just seems strange to me
that — at a place like Stanford, where we
talk so much about inclusion and fairness

and removing artificial barriers that sepa
rate peoples and classes and races — we
still have to leave some people out. You're
chosen, or you're not. You can want to be a
part of a group, more than anything in t he
world, but you can't join if they don't want
you.
And it's not like a sports team or admis
sion to medical school, where there are
clear standards and decisions are made
based on your grades or your mile time. It's
not about externals. It's about you, as I was
reminded by a good friend. Devastated
because she didn't get a bid from her top
choice, she spent the whole day smiling for
her friends who did get bids, enduring their
awkward, uncomfortable apologies as they
did their hair and make-up to go out with
their new sisters. I found her that night in
the bathroom — sobbing uncontrollably —
just so embarrassed and disappointed and
sad.
"Everything else I've ever lost at, there
was always a reason, like grades or some
thing, and I can deal with that," she said.
"But this is about me. They rejected me.
Thev didn't want me." How asinine did I

feel telling her it wasn't personal? She was
right. Of course it's personal. It's nothing
but personal.
To be fair, most Greek folks I know hate
the Rush process. It conjures up images of
Miss America finalists or country club
admissions for them, and they'd rather not
have to hurt feelings and choose members
based on seven hours or so of social interac
tion. But as far as I can tell, it goes with the
territory. It's part of the package. A Greek
system without Rush looks a lot like Roth.
I just couldn't help wondering if any of
my picnickers would be crying in the bath
room next week. If some of her friends
would feel truly guilty and sad for their
excitement and joy in the midst of her rejec
tion; if others wouldn't think about it at all.
And that even if they work things out in a
few weeks, it still won't be the same.
It made me feel better to know that they
had their photos of the gray sky and the
sunny lemonade and a time when things
were pretty simple.
