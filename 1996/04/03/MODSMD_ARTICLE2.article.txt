# Ballot might be special-fee free
## ASSU misses budget correction deadline 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Although re
vised special-fee
budgets were
approved by the
ASSU Senate at
a meeting last
night, their in-

clusion in the spring general elec
tion remains uncertain.
The Senate Appropriations
Committee submitted the budget
— which had to be revised because
of incorrect formatting — too late
yesterday to meet a deadline for
typesetting.
ASSU Type and Design, which
is responsible for producing infor
mation packets about the general
election, required the budgets to
be submitted by noon yesterday.
The budgets for six special-fee
groups were not corrected by the
deadline, said committee member
and Deputy Senate Chair Bill
Shen, and the typesetters said
they could not promise to finish
the handbook by the required
seven days in advance of the elec
tion.
"Type and Design told me all

bets were off after [yesterday's]
noon deadline," said ASSU Elec
tions Commissioner Ryan Med
ders. "They told us they were not
optimistic about meeting the pro
duction deadline."
According to ASSU Bylaws,
election handbooks detailing fi
nancial and factual information
about special-fee groups and all
candidates for the senate, Council
of Presidents and class presidents
must be distributed to the student
body a week before the general
election.
"The Elections Commission is
currently working under the as
sumption that there will be no spe
cial fees on the ballot," Medders
said. "I cannot go under the as
sumption that given the situation,
Type and Design will be able to
have everything done on time. I
have to assume the worst case sce
nario."
"[Type and Design] doesn't
give us deadlines," Shen respond
ed. "We give them deadlines. It's
their job to do this, and it's my
feeling that they're going to do it."
