# Ballot might be special-fee free
## ASSU misses budget correction deadline 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Although re
vised special-fee
budgets were
approved by the
ASSU Senate at
a meeting last
night, their in-

clusion in the spring general elec
tion remains uncertain.
The Senate Appropriations
Committee submitted the budget
— which had to be revised because
of incorrect formatting — too late
yesterday to meet a deadline for
typesetting.
ASSU Type and Design, which
is responsible for producing infor
mation packets about the general
election, required the budgets to
be submitted by noon yesterday.
The budgets for six special-fee
groups were not corrected by the
deadline, said committee member
and Deputy Senate Chair Bill
Shen, and the typesetters said
they could not promise to finish
the handbook by the required
seven days in advance of the elec
tion.
"Type and Design told me all

bets were off after [yesterday's]
noon deadline," said ASSU Elec
tions Commissioner Ryan Med
ders. "They told us they were not
optimistic about meeting the pro
duction deadline."
According to ASSU Bylaws,
election handbooks detailing fi
nancial and factual information
about special-fee groups and all
candidates for the senate, Council
of Presidents and class presidents
must be distributed to the student
body a week before the general
election.
"The Elections Commission is
currently working under the as
sumption that there will be no spe
cial fees on the ballot," Medders
said. "I cannot go under the as
sumption that given the situation,
Type and Design will be able to
have everything done on time. I
have to assume the worst case sce
nario."
"[Type and Design] doesn't
give us deadlines," Shen respond
ed. "We give them deadlines. It's
their job to do this, and it's my
feeling that they're going to do it."
Suggesting that overtime pay

or extra staff be offered, Shen said,
"We are doing everything humanly
possible to keep on track with the
timeline. We will offer Type and
Design any assistance we can give.
There are no restrictions on time,
money or manpower."

Confident that the special-fee
wrinkles will be ironed out in time,
Senate Chair Alane Murdock said,
"There are enough people who are
willing to put in the time and ef
fort" to ensure that the election
ballots will include special-fee
groups.
Medders said he will know later
today whether or not Type and De
sign will take on the job. If they are
unable to handle the production,

he said he will begin to search for
an off-campus printer.
Once the handbook is printed,
groups and individuals featured in
the document must go to the office
of the Elections Commission to
check the information for errors
before the final draft is sent to
press on Monday.
While in years past, groups have
had up to a week to review the ma
terial in the handbook, this year

they will be working in "an ex
tremely condensed period of time,"
Medders said.
Admitting that the various
problems that have arisen with the
special-fee groups are not the fault
of any particular group or individ
ual, Medders said he feels adminis
trative inefficiency on the part of
the Appropriations Committee
was the main source of the current
troubles.

In response, Shen said, "Prob
lems will arise. Problems did arise,
and we dealt with them. Rather
than pointing fingers, I'd like to
prevent this from happening again
in the future."
In other ASSU business, the
senate passed a bill naming three
undergraduates — junior Howard
Loo, sophomore Danny Bramzon
and freshman Katherine Loo — to
the Committee of 15, the group

which is authorized to make modi
fications to Stanford's judicial pro
cedures. The three fill half of the
student positions on the commit
tee, left open by the resignation of
six other students, who were un
able to serve full terms.
The administration recently
charged the committee comprised
of students, faculty and staff with a
re-evaluation of Stanford's Honor
Code.
