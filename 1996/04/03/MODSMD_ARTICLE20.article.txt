## Woods takes title at Southwestern 17th-ranked Cardinal shoots 907 to grab third-place tie at tourney 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
In what may prove to be a preview of both the Pa
cific 10 Conference championship and the NCAA
West Regional in May, the Stanford men's golf
team showed indications of shaking the inconsis
tency which has been such a burden throughout the
season at last week's Southwestern Tournament.
The 17th-ranked Cardinal bounced back from a
horrendous performance just three weeks ago,
posting a three-round score of 907 in the competi
tion at the North Ranch Country Club in Westlake
Village, Calif. The squad found itself in a third
place tie with Bay Area rival San Jose State, well be
hind champion Arizona State but trailing host
school and runner-up USC by just three strokes.
Coming off a disappointing lOth-place finish in
the Golf Digest Intercollegiate March 8-10, the
team displayed the ability to perform respectably
against the West Coast teams most likely to stand
in its way of a return to the NCAA championships.
The Pac-10 was well represented in the 13-team
field in Westlake Village, with eight of the confer
ence's schools competing.
"It's always good to see how you can do against
the teams that you might see in the postseason,"
said head coach Wally Goodwin, "and we may see
several of these teams come April and May."
Once again, all-world sophomore Tiger Woods
led the Stanford charge, taking the individual title
and finishing as the only player in the tournament
under par. The victory will likely vault Woods back
into the top spot in the Rolex Collegiate Rankings, a
position he relinquished to Texas' Brad Elder after
illness slowed him at the Golf Digest tournament.
Senior Jerry Chang emerged from a two-tourna
ment slump to finish second on the team. Chang,
the team captain, rebounded nicely after subpar

performances in his previous two outings.
Junior Conrad Ray and senior Darren Dragovich
also produced strong showings, finally beginningto
lend a measure of stability to the number four and
five spots, which have clearly been the team's weak
spot this season. Ray and Dragovich, who have
emerged from a pack of players to claim the final
two varsity positions, shot 234 and 235, respective
ly-
"We really need the guys at four and five to do
well for us," Goodwin said. "I've said it many times,
but I just can't stress it enough."
