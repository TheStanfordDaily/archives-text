# Cardinal basketball overcomes the odds to make it a year to remember
## 
### 
The women's basketball
team loses three key con
tributors to graduation,
watches the head coach depart to
oversee the U.S. Olympic Team,
then waves goodbye to its top re
turning freshman, who takes her
own leave of absence to try out for
the Olympic volleyball team. Then
the women go out and lose their
opener to a no-name Massachu
setts team.
Sure looked like a long season
ahead.
The Cardinal men, lauded as a
top-20 team in preseason polls,
lose sophomore center Tim Young
to injury, and suddenly a team
picked by some to win the Pac-10
doesn't even look like a tourna
ment team.
Yeah, right.
Ok, so maybe things looked a
little shaky for the Stanford
women after they dropped their
first game to an unranked oppo
nent. Junior Kate Starbird, the
team's leading scorer a year earli
er, was held to a paltry three
points, and the Cardinal offense
looked clumsy against a zone de
fense.
Things started falling apart
early for the men, too. The Cardi
nal got embarassed by USF and
pulverized by North Carolina.

Young was declared out for the
season with a bad back. And sud
denly, Stanford was having trou
ble putting away teams like Amer
ican University and Harvard.

So what happened?
The Cardinal men first showed
they had the heart to win in their
Pac-10 home opener against Ari
zona. Led by the gutsy play of
Brevin Knight and the precision
shooting of Dion Cross, the Cardi
nal executed an electrifying upset
of the No. 7-ranked Wildcats, a
prelude to wins over defending na
tional champion UCI.A and Cal
right here on Stanford's home
floor.
The season did have its down
points. Losses at USC, Washing
ton and Oregon tested our faith,
and late-season collapses versus
Washington State and Cal had us
doubting the team's ability to win

a big game. But the Cardinal re
stored our faith with yet another
upset of Arizona and its short but
admirable run in the NCAA tour
nament.
The heart and intensity of the
senior leaders marked this Cardi
nal team. They helped the team
maintain focus when things got
rough. They played solid, team
oriented basketball and it almost,
earned them a win over the top
ranked team in the country.
On the women's side, head
coaches Amy Tucker and Mari
anne Stanley got things turned
around in a hurry after that
UMass loss. The women rebound
ed with a win at Providence, then
returned home and dismantled an
Old Dominion team that would
eventually earn a No. 2 seed in t he
NCAA tournament.
But perhaps the biggest turn
ing point for the women came on
Saturday, Dec. 16, when the (Car
dinal scored an astonishing 90-
72 victory over then-No. 2 Ten
nessee, the eventual national
champions, preserving Stan
ford's home-court winning
streak and giving the women a
boost of confidence that would
propel them through the remain


Bobby
Cuza
der of the season.
After that, the Cardinal just
made it look easier and easier with
every win. The women took the
conference championship in a
cakewalk and rolled into the
NCAA tournament on a 19-game
winning streak. Bucking the odds,

the women earned themselves a
No. 1 seed in the West Regional
and made a breathtaking run to
the Final Four, where they bowed
out gracefully to a more talent
laden Georgia team.
Looking back, no one could
have asked for more from these
Stanford teams. Both overcame
long odds to make this one of the
most exciting seasons in the histo
ry of Cardinal basketball.
Just wait until next year.
