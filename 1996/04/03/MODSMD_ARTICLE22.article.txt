# Men's tennis blanks Utah
## Cardinal rolls to an easy victory despite lackluster showing 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
Stanford 7

With the biggest tennis weekend
of the year com big up mid a suc
cessful road trip to Arizona just
concluded (the Cardinal beat Pacif
ic-10 Conference rivals Arizona and
Arizona State 7-0 and 5-2, respec
tively), there was good reason to ex
pect the Cardinal to come out a lit
tle Hat yesterday against Utah.
And it did.
Unfortunately for the Utes,
though, Stanford was still able to
sweep the match, 7-0, in spite of a
less-t han-stellar showing.
Only senior Jim Thomas and
sophomore Paul Goldstein were
able to finish off their opponents in
straight sets. Thomas, who has
moved up from the fourth singles
spot to second as a result of his con
sistent on-court excellence, pre
served his perfect dual-match
record with a 7-0, 6-3 win. At 14-0,
lie is the only undefeated Cardinal
player this season. The big guy with
the soft touch nailed two cross
court backhand winners to win a
pivotal first set tie-breaker, and
then cruised in the second set for
the victory.
There was little excitement in
the third singles match. Goldstein,
ranked 27th in the latest ITA rank
ings, blew his opposition off the
court 6-2, 6-1.
"I'm hitting my forehand real
solid. I ain't complain about the
way I've been playing," Goldstein
said, referring to his last four
straight-set wins.
In (he most interesting match of
the day, senior captain Jeff Salzen
stein won a tight three-setter
against Christian Svensson, 6-4, 4-
6,6-3. Utah's star Swede was by far
the loudest player to step on the
Stadium's courts. With every
stroke, Svensson let go a grunt only
Monica Seles fans could appreciate.
In between guttural yelps, and es
pecially after one particularly poor-
Iy-played point, Svensson took the
opportunity to shout loudly in what
can only be assumed to be his native
tongue. Salzy, ranked fifth in the
nation in singles, is known
throughout collegiate tennis for his
excellent sportsmanship and he
maintained his composure during
the win.
The sixth singles match also fea
tured some shouting. Senior Ilicky
Becker, recipient of the Milwaukee
Tennis Classic's sportsmanship
award, was forced to deal with a
number of outbursts and snide re
marks from his opponent.
"You never like to play a player
who does that, but it may have
helped me out today," Becker said.
"Matches like these against teams

we know we should easily beat are
really hard to get up for. When
you're playing a really annoying
guy like I was, it's easier to stay fo
cused on winning."
Becker was able to focus just
enough, winning a close match, 6-4,
5-7,6-2 over Cory Dalos.
In the fourth singles slot, Ryan
Wolters turned in an uncharacter
istically subpar performance.
Wolters, ranked fourth nationally,
couldn't find a groove during the
first set, which he lost 6-3. He con
tinued to struggle in the second and
at one point found himself down 5-
3. Fortunately for the freshman, he
was able to find his stroke, winning
the next four games of the second
set and breezing in the third for a 3-
6, 7-5,6-3 victory.
Junior Grant Elliott wasn't in
top form either. He won his fifth
singles match 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, but had
more trouble than he would have
liked.
The lack of crispness in Wolters

and Elliott's games can probably be
attributed to rustinesa. Both play
ers were playing in only their sec
ond singles matches since return
ing from injuries.
VVolters had not faced singles
competition since late February at
the Rolex National Indoors. He was
sidelined for over three weeks after
doctors found a stress fracture in
his left foot. Since his return he has
looked good, winning two singles
and four doubles matches, but he
isn't back to the top of his game yet.
"I know if I had to sit out for
three weeks with an injury, it would
take me a good while to get back.
For Ryan to be hitting the ball as
cleanly as he is already is remark
able," said Goldstein of his fresh
man teammate's road to recovery.
Elliott sprained his ankle and was
forced to miss two singles matches.
Yesterday he said he was glad to be
back. "It's always good to a get

matches in," Elliott said. "We've got
a big weekend ahead of us, and now
I've got a good feel for where I'm at."
Stanford will face two of the best
teams in the country this weekend.
On Friday the Cardinal faces No. 1-
ranked UCLA, the only team to beat
the 15-1 Cardinal this year. On
Thursday the men meet USC, No. 9
in the nation and winners of three
NCAA championships in the '90s.
(The Cardinal won the other three.)
In doubles play yesterday after
noon, Goldstein and Thomas —

ranked sixth in nation — continued
their excellent team play by win
ning 8-3 at first doubles. In an ap
propriate conclusion to a lopsided
battle, Thomas served up a big win
ner down the middle to close out t he
match.
At second doubles, the 19th
ranked pair of Salzenstein and
Wolters won a closer match, 8-5.
The team earned its only break on a
cross-court forehand passing shot
from Salzy to go up 7-5. Stanford's
captain then served out the match
for the win.
Elliott and Becker also won 8-5
in the third doubles match. Playing
against a bandanna-clad duo, the
"Road Warriors" jumped to a 7-3

lead before finishing the match off.
With four solid wins under its
belt, the team looks forward to the
big clash this weekend. The
Citibank / Stanford Challenge, as
the event has been billed, promises
to be full of exciting and high quali
ty tennis.
"Those are really big matches
for us," Gould said. "We're not
razor sharp yet, but we will be for
the weekend. I like the way our
guys are performing. Our doubles
teams keep on winning and we
haven't had a singles starter lose in
the last five matches. I'm pleased
with where the team is at right now.
We just need to keep getting a little
better each time out."

looked good, winning two singles
and four doubles matches, but he
isn't back to the top of his game yet.
"I know if I had to sit out for
three weeks with an injury, it would
take me a good while to get back.

Wolters won a closer match, 8-5.
The team earned its only break on a
cross-court forehand passing shot
from Salzy to go up 7-5. Stanford's

Elliott and Becker also won 8-5

With four solid wins under its
belt, the team looks forward to the
big clash this weekend. The
Citibank / Stanford Challenge, as
the event has been billed, promises
to be full of exciting and high quali
ty tennis.
"Those are really big matches
for us," Gould said. "We're not
razor sharp yet, but we will be for
the weekend. I like the way our
guys are performing. Our doubles
teams keep on winning and we
haven't had a singles starter lose in
the last five matches. I'm pleased
with where the team is at right now.
We just need to keep getting a little
better each time out."
