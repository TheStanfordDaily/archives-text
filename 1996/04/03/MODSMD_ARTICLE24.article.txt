knocked out in the first round of the NCAA
tournament by Santa Clara.

wish him the best of success in his future,"
said Athletic Director Ted Inland.

team competition in second place with a 905,
14 strokes shy of No. 3-ranked Arizona State.

season and a Liberty Bowl appearance in
1995, begins the first of its 15 spring football
practices Monday. Head coach Tyrone Will
ingham's team will practice five times a week
for three weeks, culminating in the annual

Spring Game on Satur

79 players will report
to spring workouts, in
cluding 14 returning
starters — six on offense,
seven on defense and the
punter. "It's only nat
ural that expectations
are greater than the pre-

vious year. We've told
our players from day one that our goal every
year is to play in a 12th game — and 1996 is
no different," Willingham said.

country runner Greg Jimmerson were
