# Women gymnasts can't get out of Pac-10 slump
## Cardinal finishes sixth at conference championships then drops meet to Cal 
### Keith Rabkin Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's gym
nastics team continued its drea
ry month of March by losing
two more meets over the break,
both in Pacific 10 Conference
action.
After a home loss to Oregon
State on March 8, the Cardinal
traveled to Corvallis, Ore., for
the Pac-10 championships on
March 23. There, the 15th
ranked Cardinal challenged six
other Pac-10 rivals but placed
only sixth, just barely beating
out California to avoid finishing
last. The home-team Beavers
captured first, upsetting sev
enth-ranked UCLA in the
process.
Overall, the women were dis
appointed with their poor
showing. After notching
record-breaking scores for most
of the season, their mild score
of 193.00 was a let-down.
'"We didn't perform the way
we wanted to," said freshman
Amy Murakami. "We wanted to
go in hard and hit the Pac-10
with everything we had."
While its performance was
far from outstanding, the Car
dinal was even more upset that
it couldn't gain revenge on its

Pac-10 rivals. After going 0-5 in
the conference, the women
wanted to prove that they could
beat some of those teams.
"We were disappointed that
we didn't beat our rivals," Mu
rakami said. "If we were on, we
would have placed higher."

last season, when the Cardinal
finished fifth at Pac-lOs. There
were a few bright performances
for the Cardinal, though.
Sophomore Keri Monahan
managed a fifth-place overall
finish in the meet with a sixth
place finish on the beam. Mu
rakami also placed second on
the uneven bars.
