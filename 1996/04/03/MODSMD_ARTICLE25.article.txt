# Women gymnasts can't get out of Pac-10 slump
## Cardinal finishes sixth at conference championships then drops meet to Cal 
### Keith Rabkin Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's gym
nastics team continued its drea
ry month of March by losing
two more meets over the break,
both in Pacific 10 Conference
action.
After a home loss to Oregon
State on March 8, the Cardinal
traveled to Corvallis, Ore., for
the Pac-10 championships on
March 23. There, the 15th
ranked Cardinal challenged six
other Pac-10 rivals but placed
only sixth, just barely beating
out California to avoid finishing
last. The home-team Beavers
captured first, upsetting sev
enth-ranked UCLA in the
process.
Overall, the women were dis
appointed with their poor
showing. After notching
record-breaking scores for most
of the season, their mild score
of 193.00 was a let-down.
'"We didn't perform the way
we wanted to," said freshman
Amy Murakami. "We wanted to
go in hard and hit the Pac-10
with everything we had."
While its performance was
far from outstanding, the Car
dinal was even more upset that
it couldn't gain revenge on its

Pac-10 rivals. After going 0-5 in
the conference, the women
wanted to prove that they could
beat some of those teams.
"We were disappointed that
we didn't beat our rivals," Mu
rakami said. "If we were on, we
would have placed higher."

worse this year than they did
last season, when the Cardinal
finished fifth at Pac-lOs. There
were a few bright performances
for the Cardinal, though.
Sophomore Keri Monahan
managed a fifth-place overall
finish in the meet with a sixth
place finish on the beam. Mu
rakami also placed second on
the uneven bars.
While the Cardinal finished
slightly ahead of Cal at the cham
pionships, the Bears had their re
venge over spring break when
Stanford visited Berkeley on Fri
day. The unranked Golden Bears
stole the women's last chance for a
Pac-10 win by upsetting the Car
dinal 194.1 to 193.05.
Stanford had the meet in hand
until the last event. Going into the
beam, the Cardinal was well
ahead on points, but three falls
from the beam seriously damaged
the Cardinal's score.
"We should have beaten them,"
Murakami said, "but we didn't
stay together mentally."
The loss drops the Cardinal to
0-6 in the Pac-10 and 2-7 overall,
hardly indicative of a record
breaking season.
Despite the loss, however, the
Cardinal finished one-two-three
overall at the Cal meet with Mon
ahan taking first, freshman
Tracey Kohl capturing second and
Murakami placing third. Unlike
its previous Pa'c-10 meets, Stan
ford did not manage to shatter any
school records.
The Bears, meanwhile, per
formed brilliantly, bringing their
record to 16-6 overall and 2-4 in
the Pac-10. Candice Kwok was the
Bears' star performer, shattering
her school record with a 9.900.
Kwok also placed first on the vault
with a score 0f9.925, good enough
to beat Monahan, Stanford's all
time vaulter.
The Cardinal will now set its
sights on the NCAA Western Re
gionals which take place April 13
in Los Angeles. The women will
need to stay together mentally to
ensure that they don't give away
another meet like they did at Cal.
