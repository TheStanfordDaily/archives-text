# Water polo still can't top pesky Golden Bears
## Cardinal women take four of seven over break but lose three straight to Cal 
### Erin Bryla Contributing writer 
As a first-year varsity sport,
the Stanford women's water
polo team has accomplished
much. But there is one goal that
still eludes them — a victory
over California.
Over the past three weeks the
women won four out of the seven
games they played, with all
three losses coming at the hands
of the Golden Hears. Two of
these losses were in regular sea
son play, with the other coming
in a tournament at UC-Davis
this past weekend.
In the first Cal game on
March 15, the Cardinal came out
on lire in the first half, jumping
out to a quick 5-2 lead. Hut with
just under two minutes left in
the first half, Cal doused Stan
ford's hopes of victory by scoring
three quick goals. After that, the
Hears never looked back,
outscoring the Cardinal four
goals to two. Julia Baker scored
three of Stanford's seven goals
in the losing effort.
The Cardinal redeemed itself
the following week with a 14-2
drubbing of the University of
Pacific. The Tigers proved no
match for the much deeper Car
dinal.
"We dominated UOP, and
that was good because then we
had the opportunity to play
everyone," said head coach Ben
Quittner.
The Cardinal didn't have
much time to rest on its laurels,
heading to Berkeley to meet Cal
once again on March 27. Stan
ford came out strong and played
tough defense, but it was all for
naught. Cal's s Courtney Young-
Johnson let the young Cardinal
know why she is a member of the
Senior National Team by racking
up seven goals. Captain Alice
Cathcart and Baker both scored
two goals apiece, but the rest of
the Stanford squad only scored
two as the Golden Bears went on
to win 10-6.

"This was a frustrating game.
We came out and played really
well, but Courtney Johnson-
Young scored seven goals,"
Quittner said.
After the loss the Cardinal
traveled to Davis, where the
women won four out of five
games. The victories were by no
means easy, with most of the
games decided by two goals or
less. Strong defense led the way,
however, as the Cardinal began
the weekend with a 10-2 victory
against UOP. Freshman Lind
say Tam led the scoring with
four goals and Cathcart scored
two.
The Cardinal maintained its
winning ways against UC-Santa
Barbara as Tam again led the
way with three goals. The rest of
the Stanford squad doubled that
total as the Cardinal went on to
win 6-3.

"We try to play team defense
and stifling defense. Ideally,
they will never get a shot, and if
they do it will be a bad one," said
freshman goalkeeper Heather
Crary.
After the Santa Barbara
game, the Cardinal clashed once
again with its nemesis. Stanford
was plagued by an inability to
score despite playing well on de
fense. Baker was the only mem
ber of the Cardinal who managed
to find the net, as Cal won 5-1.
"We played well defensively.
It was 1-1 until the third quar
ter," Quittner said. "We just
need to set our mind on scoring.
We need to put together games
where we score six or seven and
hold opponents to under five. It
should be expected of everyone
to score."
Despite the third loss to Cal
in two weeks, the Cardinal fin

ished the weekend on an up-note
by defeating UC-Davis and
Davis Open, a mixture of Aggies
and National Team players.
Tam scored three goals to lead
the Cardinal to a 5-4 victory over
UC-Davis. Olivia White and
Baker also scored one apiece.
The women won by one goal
against Davis Open, pulling off a
6-5 victory.
"We played really well, except
[for] the Cal game. We dominat
ed UOP, and against Santa Bar
bara and Davis it was close, but
we pulled it out," Crary said.
The Cardinal will probably
face the Bears again this year
but is hoping for a different re
sult.
"Every game we are coming a
little bit short, but hopefully we
will beat them at the right time.
The national tournament will be
the right time," Quittner said.
