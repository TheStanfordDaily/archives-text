### David Stein Contributing write 
The Palo Alto City Council voted Monday to con
sider zoning changes that could facilitate Stanford's
expansion and development plans.
Although the vote was 7-0 in favor of starting the
months-long process to consider the proposal tp en
large Stanford Shopping Center, the council did not
indicate whether or not it will approve the proposal,
said Palo Alto Vice Mayor Joseph Huber.
"Our staff told us that we needed to look over the
codes before anything could be done," Huber said.
"This doesn't mean anything in the approval of the
project; it only initiates the discussion of possibly
changing the codes."
Huber added that he personally will take no
stance on the issue until he sees more information
on the changes to the zoning codes.
At present, the city's zoning codes limit Stanford
to adding only 65,000 square feet to the shopping
center. Stanford's current proposal aims to expand
the shopping center by an additional 165,000 feet.
Other construction by the University that could
be affected by the council's vote includes plans to ex
tend Sand Hill Road to El Camino Real to decrease
