# Expansion?
## Council mulls Stanford plan 
### David Stein Contributing write 
The Palo Alto City Council voted Monday to con
sider zoning changes that could facilitate Stanford's
expansion and development plans.
Although the vote was 7-0 in favor of starting the
months-long process to consider the proposal tp en
large Stanford Shopping Center, the council did not
indicate whether or not it will approve the proposal,
said Palo Alto Vice Mayor Joseph Huber.
"Our staff told us that we needed to look over the
codes before anything could be done," Huber said.
"This doesn't mean anything in the approval of the
project; it only initiates the discussion of possibly
changing the codes."
Huber added that he personally will take no
stance on the issue until he sees more information
on the changes to the zoning codes.
At present, the city's zoning codes limit Stanford
to adding only 65,000 square feet to the shopping
center. Stanford's current proposal aims to expand
the shopping center by an additional 165,000 feet.
Other construction by the University that could
be affected by the council's vote includes plans to ex
tend Sand Hill Road to El Camino Real to decrease
traffic around the mall, to build
an apartment complex near cam
pus to house Stanford employees
and to construct a senior housing
complex near Bing Nursery
School which would provide inde
pendent and assisted living facili
ties for the elderly.
The council decided to initiate
discussion of the proposal, Huber
said, because an independent de

veloper such as Stanford could
not do so by itself without official
intervention by the council.
Although this decision was ul
timately nondecisive, Stanford
was pleased with the vote, said
Andy Coe, director of community
relations.
"Even if the decision did not
mean a whole lot, it was an impor
tant step," Coe said.
The necessary public hearings
and environmental reviews will
begin in late spring. Coe said he
hopes the council will decide
whether or not to approve the

project by late fall.
At that time, Huber said the
council has the option to vote or to
pass the decision on to the citizens
of Palo Alto.
"We will probably let the voters
make the decision, either by refer
endum or with the council putting
the measure on the ballot," Huber
said.
Huber also expects some sort
of decision to be made by fall. If
approval is given, construction
could begin as early as next spring
and continue for three to four
years.

Until then, however, Huber ex
pects much "vocal opposition" by
Palo Alto residents regarding the
possible expansion.
"With so many cars and traffic
involved, there are bound to be
objections," Huber explained.
On the other hand, Coe said
the three Stanford projects "will
deal with circulation and parking
issues."
Noting that funds for the ex
pansion and construction plans
will come entirely from Stanford,
Coe said the projects "will ulti
mately show true public benefit."
