### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Biology Prof. Emeritus Colin S. Pittendrigh, who
helped found Stanford's Human Biology Program, died
March 19 in Bozeman, Mont.
The cause was cancer. He is survived by his wife, a
daughter, a son and two grandchildren.
"He was a salient person," said Psychology Prof. Emer
itus Albert Hastorf, also a Human Biology Program
founder. "He really was a delightful guy."
Colleagues remembered Pittendrigh, who at the time
of his death was professor emeritus at Hopkins Marine
Station in Monterey, as an excellent teacher and friend.
University President Emeritus and Biology Prof. Don
ald Kennedy said Pittendrigh was originally recruited to
Stanford from Princeton University to help build the
fledgling Human Biology Program.
The University was interested in the professor "not
only because he was a wonderful scientist and teacher but
because we thought he would contribute to the Hum Bio
Program," Kennedy said.
Pittendrigh ended up leading a very successful one
quarter preparatory class for potential human biology
majors and becoming a popular lecturer.
Sociology Prof. Emeritus Sandy Dornbusch recalled
that he used to watch Pittendrigh's lectures to see what
made them so successful.
"I went to tiy to figure ouy what his tricks were, and it
was very interesting," Dornbusch
said. "After the class, I would tell him
what I thought lie had done. It was
obvious he had put an enormous
amount of energy into class prepara
tion.
"Everybody who was lucky
enough to be a student of his remem
bers his great lectures," Dornbusch
added.
Pittendrigh would oflen incorpo
rate stories of his own experiences
into lectures, Kennedy said. During
World War 11, Pittendrigh worked in
Trinidad, examining yellow fever by
studying the mosquitoes that spread
t he disease.
"He got to be quite famous for
those stories," Kennedy said. "Colin
was a marvelous collector of anec
dotes."
Pittendrigh was born in 1918 in
Whitely Bay, England, near the bor
der with Scotland, leaving him with
an accent all his colleagues enjoyed,
Kennedy said. He received a bache
lor's degree from the University of
Durham in England in 1940 and a

doctorate from Columbia University
in 1948. He joined the Princeton fac
ulty in 1947.
I le produced some of the pioneer
ing work on biological clocks in ani
mals. Since then, Dornbusch said,
It discoveries have been applied to
humans in the form of developing
biochemical devices to change body
rhythms and understand jetlag.
He was awarded a Guggenheim
Fellowship, the Alexander von Hum
boldt Prize and a gold medal from the
(V.ech Academy of Sciences, among
other prizes.
In his spare time, Pittendrigh en
joyed trout fishing. On several occa
sicin, he took fishing trips in Montana
and Idaho with Stanford colleagues,
entertaining along the way with his
stories.
Through it all, teaching was most
important to Pittendrigh, Dornbusch
said.
"I Ie once said to me that although
he was a pretty well-known re
searcher and had been dean of the
graduate school at Princeton, that
when he died friends thought he
would lx> remembered as a great
teacher, and that gave him enormous
satisfaction," Dornbusch said. "He
preferred that to everything else."
