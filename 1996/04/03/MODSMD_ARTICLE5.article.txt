The University Libraries recently
purchased a 1,500-piece collection of
books and manuscripts on the French
political economy, including the origi
nal printing of the Edict of Nantes.
The new exhibit, which is being
housed in the Stanford Auxiliary Li
brary until renovations on Green Li
brary are complete, is named after Gus
tave Gimon, a pharmacist and leader of
the French resistance during World
War 11. Donations to fund the collection
came from Gimon's son Jean-Paul and
the President's Fund.

"It's rich both in terms of linear de
velopment of discipline but also very
rich in issues of other forms of thinking
that get raised in the development of
political economy," said History Prof.
Keith Baker, director of the Stanford
Humanities Center.
Included in the collection is a section
on the Edict of Nantes, which granted
religious tolerance to the French
Catholic Huguenots. The collection an
alyzes the economic ramifications of re
ligious tolerance, Baker said.
In addition, the exhibit contains ma
terials on the tension between econom
ic liberalization and political abso
lutism in the 1700s.

"It discusses the way in which the
French absolutist regime tries to stim
ulate economic growth in order to com
pete more effectively with England,"
Baker said.
The third major section, he said, dis
cusses the origins of French socialism
which inspired Karl Marx's socialism
and subsequently communism.
'It's going to put Stanford on the
map in the study of French political
economy," said History Prof. Carolyn
Lougee, who studies 17th century
French social history. "We haven't real
ly been on that map."
The University was notified of the
collection's existence in 1994 by the

same antiquarian dealer from which
the University purchased another
French collection in 1993, said Tony
Angiletta, assistant librarian for collec
tions.
"I received a letter from the dealer
(which said this was) 'a once in a life
time opportunity,' " said Mary Jane
Parrine, curator for Romance Lan
guage Collections who handled the ex
hibit. Adding that she receives similar
letters every day, she said the true value
of the exhibit wasn't discovered until
eight notebooks described its contents.
"As I was looking it over, I thought,
