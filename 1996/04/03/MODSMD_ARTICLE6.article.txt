## Grad student braves cancer with support from family, friends 
### Kristie Lilje Smith Contributing writer 
You take all the necessary precautions. You
don't smoke. No one in your family smokes.
There's no family history of the disease. You never
think it will happen to you.
John Pickett, a 36-year-old second-year gradu
ate student in the Department of Classics, didn't
think cancer would happen to him. Nor did Patri
cia Pickett, his wife, or his eight-year-old daughter
and 16-year-old son. But it did happen.

Four months ago, John Pickett was diagnosed
with terminal lung cancer when he was seeking
treatment for a persistent cough. At first the doc
tors didn't know what was wrong with him. But
after a few unsuccessful prescriptions, his doctors
decided to take a biopsy.
The prognosis . .. four to six months.
The emotional crisis and financial burden the
family has sustained because of John's sudden ill
ness is severe. He underwent rigorous chemother-

Church.
apy in hopes of slowing the disease.
However, the treatments were un
successful and only made him sick.
The therapy was discontinued in
February, and John decided to
spend the remainder of his time at
home with his family. "I want to stay
at home with them as long as I can,"
said Pickett, who must be hooked to
an oxygen tank 24 hours a day.
John and his family came to
Stanford from Oregon in August
1994 so he could pursue a doctoral
degree in the Classics Department.
Once they arrived, the family
quickly became an important part of
the graduate community in Escon
dido Village, said Holly Knapp, a
neighbor of the Picketts. John's
wife, Patricia, took a job in the Es
condido Village office, and John be
came the resident in charge of the
after-hours lockout services for all
of Escondido.
When the Escondido communi
ty found out about John's illness,
the response was immediate and
supportive, said the Picketts. Stu
dents around the area brought food
to the Picketts on a daily basis. In
addition, four neighbors established
a bank account in Patricia's name at
the Stanford Credit Union to help
offset the family's large health-care
expenses as a result of John's ill
ness.
When John and his family decid

ed to move back to Portland to be
closer to home, the Stanford com
munity's support continued.
Several residents in Escondido, as
well as John's fellow students and
others from the Classics Depart
ment, helped the family to pack. An
undergraduate fraternity offered to
help move the family out of their
apartment. The Picketts returned
to Oregon on Saturday.
Most recently, the Stanford
Bookstore teamed together with
Round Table Pizza and many Stan
ford volunteers to sponsor the
"Picketts' Fund-raiser." People can
purchase a voucher for a pizza at the
Customer Service Department at
the Bookstore between April 1 and
April 30 to support the Picketts or
can contribute to the family directly
by leaving a donation at the Cus
tomer Service Department.
The Picketts expressed their ap
preciation for the opportunities at
Stanford and the community spirit
that this campus fosters in its resi
dents.
"There's an actual community
here," said John. "I went to Reed
College as an undergraduate, where
only about three of 1,200 students
had children. There was a homoge
nous population. At Stanford, my
daughter has friends from
Guatemala and Korea."
"My son has also had many op
portunities while at Stanford,"
John added. John said his son has
been exposed to the computer re
sources on campus and has had the
experience of working for a biology

graduate student doing on-line
medical research. In fact, the Stan
ford experience has influenced their
teen-age son so much that he hopes
to come back to Stanford in a few
years for college, John said.
"We really appreciate everything
that people have done for us," the
Picketts said. Patricia said she
never realiy.ed how nice it would be
not to have to prepare dinner
throughout this ordeal.
The Picketts explained that they
were hesitant about their neighbors
establishing fund at the Credit
Union, but the neighbors wouldn't
take no for an answer. "So many
people that we don't know have
given $5 or $10 donations," John
said.
"The mailman even gave us
some money last week because he
said that he had heard what had
happened," Patricia said.
To<late, members of t he commu
nity have donated more than $7,000
to the Picketts. Kven the Classics
Department, which John explained
was relatively small, donated
$3,000. "We'reoverwhelmed by the
generosity," they said.

If you would like to contribute to the
Picketts' fund, anonymous dona
tions can be made payable to Patri
cia Pickett, Acct. # 1097267and sent
to the Stanford Credit Union, P.O.
Pox 10690, Palo Alto, CA 94303 or
deposited directly at the counter of
the Credit Union. Contributions can
also be channeled through the Stan
ford Bookstore.
