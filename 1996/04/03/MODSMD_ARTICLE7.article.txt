# Fellows named
## 6 Eastern European students win year of study at Stanford 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
Six students from formerly communist Eastern
European countries have been selected as the first
recipients of a new fellowship program.
The New Democracy Fellows will be provided
with at least one year of graduate study in the social
sciences. University Provost Condoleezza Rice, who
initiated the program, said the main objective of the
fellowship is to "create a new generation of scholars
who are well-trained in the social sciences so that
the academy can be rebuilt in [formerly communist
Eastern European] countries."
Rice, who served as senior director for Soviet af
fairs for the National Security Council from 1989 to
1991, said the program is built on a "belief that you
cannot have a democracy without knowledge and

ideas and a recognition that partic
ularly the social sciences in former
ly communist Eastern Europe were
completely corrupted."
The fellowship, administered by
Stanford's Institute for Interna
tional Studies, will target five acad
emic departments: anthropology,
history, political science, sociology
and psychology.
History Prof. Emeritus Alexan
der Dallin, a senior fellow at the in-

stitute and director of the new program, said the
chosen fields were considered "the most deficient or
distorted as a result of the period of communist
rule."
The inaugural group of New Democracy Fellows,
who will begin their studies this fall, are Rozita Di
mova (anthropology) from Macedonia; Barnabas
Gero (sociology) from Hungary; Andrey Kounov
(political science) from Kazakhstan; Nikolay Mari
nov (political science) from Bulgaria; Sergei Safonov
(political science) from Russia; and Alexei Sitnikov
(political science) from Russia.
Dallin said the students are coming initially for a
year, but the hope is that they will want to continue
into doctoral programs. If admitted to such pro-
