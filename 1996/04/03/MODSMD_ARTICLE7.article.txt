# Fellows named
## 6 Eastern European students win year of study at Stanford 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
Six students from formerly communist Eastern
European countries have been selected as the first
recipients of a new fellowship program.
The New Democracy Fellows will be provided
with at least one year of graduate study in the social
sciences. University Provost Condoleezza Rice, who
initiated the program, said the main objective of the
fellowship is to "create a new generation of scholars
who are well-trained in the social sciences so that
the academy can be rebuilt in [formerly communist
Eastern European] countries."
Rice, who served as senior director for Soviet af
fairs for the National Security Council from 1989 to
1991, said the program is built on a "belief that you
cannot have a democracy without knowledge and

ideas and a recognition that partic
ularly the social sciences in former
ly communist Eastern Europe were
completely corrupted."
The fellowship, administered by
Stanford's Institute for Interna
tional Studies, will target five acad
emic departments: anthropology,
history, political science, sociology
and psychology.
History Prof. Emeritus Alexan
der Dallin, a senior fellow at the in-

stitute and director of the new program, said the
chosen fields were considered "the most deficient or
distorted as a result of the period of communist
rule."
The inaugural group of New Democracy Fellows,
who will begin their studies this fall, are Rozita Di
mova (anthropology) from Macedonia; Barnabas
Gero (sociology) from Hungary; Andrey Kounov
(political science) from Kazakhstan; Nikolay Mari
nov (political science) from Bulgaria; Sergei Safonov
(political science) from Russia; and Alexei Sitnikov
(political science) from Russia.
Dallin said the students are coming initially for a
year, but the hope is that they will want to continue
into doctoral programs. If admitted to such pro-


Rice
grams, they will be awarded addi
tional three-year fellowships
from their respective depart
ments.
More than 150 applications
were received from students
from a range of countries in the
region.
The committee assessed,
among other things, the stu
dents' motivation to return to
Eastern Europe to make use of
their graduate training through
academic, research or public ser
vice positions.
"The hope is that people will go
back as a result and provide social
science training in those coun
tries, and the fellowships won't
be needed any longer," said Polit

ical Science I'rof. David Hol
lo way.
"Academics is a multiplication
effect," said Rice, "because
they'll go and train other people."
She hopes the program will pro
duce "a large enough cadre of aca
demic and faculty members that
it can be sustained on its own."
The fellowships cover tuition,
living expenses and round-trip
transportation, (lifts from Don
ald Kendall, former chairman of
PepsiCo, and the E.L. Wiegand
Foundation of Reno, New, pro
vided start-up funds.
"Although the main aim of the
program is to help the develop
ment of social sciences in the re
gion, the fact is we're bringing
some very interesting people from
different backgrounds to Stan
ford," said Holloway. "I think the
fellows will make a significant
contribution to Stanford, too."
