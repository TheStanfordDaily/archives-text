Then come to a small seminar where you can read about
and discuss issues like sexual harassment, the

workplace.
LING 52: Language in the Workplace. Tu-Th 2:15-
3:45, 200-305.
Puzzles about language and time:
Natural languages have various ways to refer to time,
past and future, sequences of events, and temporal
reasoning patterns. The expression of time and tense in
different languages raises questions of a philosophical,
psychological, and linguistic nature. In this seminar, we
consider the logic of time, the semantics of tense and time
adverbials, temporal metaphors, different kinds of
situations (states/events) time and tense in narrative
discourse.
LING 131: Puzzles about language and time: Tu-
Th 10:00-11:50, Terman 152.
