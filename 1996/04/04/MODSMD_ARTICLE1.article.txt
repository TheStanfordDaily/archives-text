The Beacon campus gas station on Serra Street
may become a Texaco service station, a move that has
aroused controversy because of Texaco's invest
ments in Myanmar.
Students for Environmental Action at Stanford
will meet with the owner of the station, Roy Wicks,
this morning to discourage him from converting the
station to Texaco. SEAS is active in protesting
human rights and environmental abuses by the mili
tary government in Myanmar — the country in
Southeast Asia formerly known as Burma.
"We don't want to threaten him," said SEAS co
coordinator Kelly Naylor. "He owns the gas station
on campus — we don't want to destroy his business."
SEAS members are also protesting the potential
placement of a Taco Bell in Tressider Union because
of the involment of its parent company, PepsiCo, in
Myanmar.
Wicks said he would choose not to use Texaco gaso
line "if there is a major problem."
"But right now, as far as I am concerned, they are
a good company to deal with, and I'd have to see
something pretty drastic to change my mind," he
said.
Wicks emphasized that Texaco is not buying the
station —it is only the vendor from whom he will buy
the gasoline.
Tim Knight, a member of SEAS, said his group un
derstands Wicks is still negotiating with several dif
ferent companies but wants to approach him with the
information about Texaco and explain the situation.
"We want to keep it friendly," said Knight. "We are
targeting Texaco in this, not the local owner of the
station. We want to work with him if it is at all possi
ble."
Although he currently buys Beacon gasoline,
Wicks is planning a remodel of the station which
would include new pumps, a new service area and a
different brand of gasoline.
Texaco came under campus fire before for its deal
ings in Myanmar last spring when students protest
ed Stanford's investments in the company. The Stan-
