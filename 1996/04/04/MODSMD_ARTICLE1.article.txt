# Station may sell Texaco, irking some
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
The Beacon campus gas station on Serra Street
may become a Texaco service station, a move that has
aroused controversy because of Texaco's invest
ments in Myanmar.
Students for Environmental Action at Stanford
will meet with the owner of the station, Roy Wicks,
this morning to discourage him from converting the
station to Texaco. SEAS is active in protesting
human rights and environmental abuses by the mili
tary government in Myanmar — the country in
Southeast Asia formerly known as Burma.
"We don't want to threaten him," said SEAS co
coordinator Kelly Naylor. "He owns the gas station
on campus — we don't want to destroy his business."
SEAS members are also protesting the potential
placement of a Taco Bell in Tressider Union because
of the involment of its parent company, PepsiCo, in
Myanmar.
Wicks said he would choose not to use Texaco gaso
line "if there is a major problem."
"But right now, as far as I am concerned, they are
a good company to deal with, and I'd have to see
something pretty drastic to change my mind," he
said.
Wicks emphasized that Texaco is not buying the
station —it is only the vendor from whom he will buy
the gasoline.
Tim Knight, a member of SEAS, said his group un
derstands Wicks is still negotiating with several dif
ferent companies but wants to approach him with the
information about Texaco and explain the situation.
"We want to keep it friendly," said Knight. "We are
targeting Texaco in this, not the local owner of the
station. We want to work with him if it is at all possi
ble."
Although he currently buys Beacon gasoline,
Wicks is planning a remodel of the station which
would include new pumps, a new service area and a
different brand of gasoline.
Texaco came under campus fire before for its deal
ings in Myanmar last spring when students protest
ed Stanford's investments in the company. The Stan-
ford Management Company said
at the time that it would begin in
vestigating Texaco's human
rights and environmental record
in Myanmar.
Texaco spokeswoman Cynthia
Michener said Texaco believes its
presence in Myanmar helps to im
prove economic conditions that en
courage human rights.
"We are fully aware of the
human rights charges directed at
the Myanmar government, but we
are not a 'drill and leave' compa
ny," said Michener.
"Through the creation of jobs,
higher wages, the transfer of tech
nology and establishment of social
services, we try to create better
conditions for our employees — we
want to set a good example in coun
tries we don't agree with political
ly," she added.
But Naylor said there was a

broader concern at hand.
"Many companies that have al
ready pulled out of Myanmar say
that there is no way to operate
there without directly contribut
ing to the military government,"
Naylor said.
"When corporations are there,
they can say, 'Oh well, we are keep
ing this country open for western
trade and influence,' but no matter
what, they are financially support
ing the government," she added.
Wicks said the station was a
Texaco before, about eight years
ago. "We've been a Texaco, we've
been a Shell station. Students
never seem to be happy," Wicks
said.
Naylor said she hopes SEAS can
help Wicks realize that in his ef
forts to remodel and his desire to
comply with environmental regu
lations, he needs to consider the
world-wide effect. "We are trying
to find a solution that is good for
him, good for campus and for our
environment and world," said
Naylor.
