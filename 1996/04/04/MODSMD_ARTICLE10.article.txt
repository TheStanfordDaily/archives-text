Graduate students Elisabeth Friedman and Wil
metta Toliver have been awarded the 1996
Woodrow Wilson Dissertation Grants in Women's
Studies, a $1,500 grant given to 15 students nation
wide.
The grant, sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson
National Fellowship Foundation, encourages orig
inal and significant research on women and their
positions in society. The award must be used for ex
penses involved with writing doctoral disserta
tions, such as travel, books and computer services.
Friedman, a doctoral candidate in political sci
ence, is currently writing her dissertation, titled
"Gendering Transitions: Paradoxes of Women's
Participation in Latin American Democratiza
tion." She said she's found that politics in the tran
sition to democracy are influenced by gender, and
that political parties in the region are geared to
ward men.
"This grant is critical for people doing research
in women's studies," Friedman said. "Very few
grants supporting women's studies exist."
Friedman received her bachelor's degree in po
litical science and women's studies at Barnard Col-

lege, the women's college at Columbia University
in New York City. She has traveled throughout
Central and South America and spent 18 months
in Venezuela, where she conducted her original re
search.
This quarter, Friedman is also teaching
"Women in the Transition to Democracy in Latin
America," a course offered in Latin American and
feminist studies.
Toliver, who is pursuing a doctorate in African
history, completed her undergraduate work at
Spelman College in Atlanta, and then spent a year
at Oxford in England. After finishing her master's
degree at Stanford, she went to Dakar, Senegal,
where she is currently spending a year researching
her dissertation.
Her study, which is titled "Allin Sitoe Diatta:
Addressing Historical Silences Through Sene
galese Culture," focuses on Diatta, the priestess
queen who led the village of Casamance against
French intrusion during World War 11. Toliver
plans to connect her research in Senegal to the
broader role of African women in history.
Recipients of the Wilson grants are chosen by an
interdisciplinary committee. The money for the
grants is provided by the Ford Foundation, the
Philip Morris Foundation and former grantees.
