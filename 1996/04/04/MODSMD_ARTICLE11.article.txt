# Med students meet their match
## 
### Timothy Kiefer Contributing writer 
Eighty-five percent of the graduating School of
Medicine students opening envelopes on "Match
Day" were chosen by one of their top three residency
choices, down from 92 percent last year.
Sixty-eight percent got their first choice, 6 percent
their second choice and 11 percent their third. The
newly minted M.D.s will now spend between three
and seven years working at a hospital to learn their
area of practice.
Match Day, which took place at medical schools
across the nation on March 20, is organized by the Na
tional Resident Matching Program, a standardized
process which matches residents with hospitals. Stu
dents interview with residency programs, and then
both the programs and the students rank their top
choices. A computer matches the students with the
programs based on the rankings. Students are re
quired to accept their assignments.
Opening the envelopes ended a tense period of un
certainty for medical school students.
"It's really like a computer dating service," said
graduating student Diana Prince. "It feels much
more like a gamble than getting a job or getting into
medical school.
"The night before I had nightmares, waking up
every hour," said Prince. "Everybody had sleeping
problems the night before."
For Prince, the envelope contained good news. She

got her first choice, Sonoma Community Hospital in
Santa Rosa, where she will work in family practice.
All the participating students gathered in the Med
ical School lounge, and the tension gave way to giddy
exuberance as the envelopes were given out one by
one. Some students opened their envelopes right
away, while others sought privacy for the big mo
ment.
"After everybody opened up their envelopes it got
to be really excited," said Prince.
But not everyone was celebrating. "I remember
one student looking disappointed and teary-eyed,"
said Clerkship Administrator Kate Miller.
Of the 68 participating Medical School students,
14 will stay at Stanford and two more will return after
an internship elsewhere. The next most popular hos
pitals were UC-San Francisco (nine), UCLA (six),
Harvard (five) and the University of Washington
(five).
Forty-nine percent of the Stanford graduates will
go into a general practice program, including internal
medicine, family practice or pediatrics, paralleling a
trend toward generalist medicine and away from spe
cialization. Nationally, 54 percent of the students in
this year's match will enter a generalist program.
Forty-two of the students will remain in California
for their residencies. All but three will be somewhere
on either the West or East Coasts.
Three couples in the program were able to go to the
same city for their residencies, with two couples going
to Seattle and one to Baltimore.
