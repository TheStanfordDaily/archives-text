# Brown presumed dead in crash
## Jet crashes in Croatia; commerce secretary mourned by Washington 
### 
(AP) — An Air Force jetliner carrying
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and a
delegation of American business execu
tives veered off course and crashed into
a cloud-covered hill yesterday outside
Dubrovnik, Croatia. All 33 people
aboard were presumed dead.
In Washington, a somber President
Clinton called Brown "a magnificent life
force" and urged prayers for those
aboard the lost flight.
The State Department said it would
not release the names of those aboard
the plane until today, in deference to the
families. But State Department
spokesman Glyn Davies said Brown was
presumed dead.
In a statement announcing that one
of its vice presidents was aboard the
plane, the Riggs National Bank of Wash
ington said, "We have been told that the
crash left no survivors." Croatian TV
also said all aboard the T-43 military
passenger jet were killed.
Word of the crash stunned Washing
ton and brought an outpouring of
prayers and praise for Brown and his
entourage, who were on a mission to

find ways to rebuild the wartorn Balkan
region's infrastructure and economy.
"To all of their loved ones and their
families and friends, I want to say that I
am very grateful for their lives and their
service," Clinton said in brief remarks to
about 700 Commerce Department work
ers, pausing at the end for a moment of
silence. Vice President A 1 Gore, first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and most of the
Cabinet sat solemnly at the ceremony,
most of them staring downward.
"He was one of the best advisers and
ablest people I ever knew," Clinton said
of Brown, who as Democratic National
Committee chairman was a major figure
in the president's 1992 campaign victo
ry. "Those of us who loved him will
always be grateful for his friendship and
his warmth."
Clinton's use of the past tense hours
before any fatalities were confirmed
reflected the pessimism in Washington
that any good news would come from
rescue teams at the hillside where Croa
tian officials found the downed plane
resting on its belly, its midsection appar
ently burned.

The mood was much the same among
the parade of elected officials and other
dignitaries who called on Brown's wife
of 33 years, Alma, at the family's Wash
ington home.
"This is a man whose multiple talents
will not be easily replaced," said Eleanor
Holmes Norton, the District of
Columbia's delegate to Congress. "For
the African-American community, the
loss is into infinity."
For all the mournful talk, the White
House and the Pentagon said they could
not confirm any fatalities because Amer
ican rescue teams had trouble reaching
the site because of bad weather. But,
speaking privately, several administra
tion officials said that as the hours
dragged on, there was little hope for sur
vivors.
Air Force Lt. Gen. Howell Estes said
there were 33 people aboard the aircraft
— 27 passengers and a crew of six. The
T-43, the military version of the twin
engine Boeing 737, disappeared from
radar screens at 2:52 p.m. local time —
7:52 a.m. in Washington — as it
approached the Dubrovnik airport.
