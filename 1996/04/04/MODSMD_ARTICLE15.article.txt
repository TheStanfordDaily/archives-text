ESPNet shouldn't punish
the Tree for ballot rigging
in the Battle of the Mascots

Recently, espn's world
Wide Web site conducted a
Battle of the Mascots, allow
ing ESPNet Sports Zone users to
choose among 16 college mascots in
a NCAA tournament-like format.
The Stanford Tree rolled over the
Duke Blue Devil in a first-round
matchup, garnering nearly two
thirds of the votes.
However, after discovering that
two Stanford students had activat
ed a script that repeatedly accessed
the site and voted for the Tree on
five University computers, the
tournament selection committee
disqualified the evergreen from the
competition. Furthermore, a poll
of site users — a poll in which
Stanford students were not able to
participate — placed the Tree on
five years of probation as a result
of the Treegate scandal.
The Tree is an innocent victim
of the actions of two misguided
fans and the sports network's
overzealous officials. ESPN pro
vides valuable services to millions
of sports fans, but it definitely
botched this call.
The contest had no explicit rules
prohibiting multiple voting. The
two students and their computer
program may have violated the
competition's spirit, but th6y did
not violate its letter. (They did,
however, violate University policy
regarding computing resources
and have been dealt with accord
ingly.) COP member Jon Oram
actually went as far as to praise the
perpetrators' ingenuity, arguing in
a letter to ESPNet that "such
efforts should be encouraged, not
penalized." While Oram's support
of such deliberately devious behav
ior is questionable, it is clear this
behavior did not break the con
test's rules. It should not have pro

voked a punitive reaction.
Even after the selection commit
tee deemed the ballot rigging a
breach of the competition's spirit,
it should not have disqualified the
Tree. Merely discarding the tainted
votes — the established practice in
other cases of vote fraud — would
have sufficed. If the Stanford mas
cot proved triumphant without the
illicit help, it should have been
allowed to continue to the next
round.
In addition, the Tree itself was
not responsible for the attempt to
stuff the ballot box, nor did it con
done the act. In fact, the feisty
mascot — which last made nation
al headlines after brawling with
Oski the Bear at a 1995 basketball
game — had no knowledge whatso
ever of the actions taken on its
behalf until well after the polls
were closed. As a result, ESPNet is
unjustly punishing something that
has done nothing wrong.
If ESPNet's disqualification of
the Tree from this year's battle is
questionable, its decision to sug
gest a five-year sanction against
the Tree borders on the absurd.
What makes matters worse is the
gutless manner in which the ban
was imposed. Instead of making a
ruling itself, the selection commit
tee placed the decision in the hands
of site users. Because anyone
accessing the site from a Stanford
computer was prohibited from vot
ing, virtually all eligible voters had
a vested interest in seeing the Tree
banned from further competition
— if the evergreen was out, it
couldn't defeat their preferred
mascot. It is a testament to human
decency that 48.2 percent of those
who did vote recognized the inher
ent injustice of the sanction — not
enough to save the Tree, but more
than might have been expected to
support the Stanford mascot.
ESPNet's treatment of the Tree
is deplorable. The disqualification is
unjust; the five-year ban even more
so. In order to restore its own name
to the ranks of the just, ESPNet
should immediately reinstate the
Tree to the ranks of competition.
