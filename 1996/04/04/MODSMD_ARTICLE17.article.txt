## As long as we both shall live 
### 
I'M QUIETLY SLIPPING over the
most terrifying threshold of maturi
ty — getting married has become
the responsible thing to do. I've finished
college and soon, God willing, I'll be
financially independent. I'm old
enough, older than my parents were
when they married. All my "get-out-of
jail-free" cards have expired. I can't
wave off marriage as the concern of
"adults" anymore. I am one.
This is particularly distressing if
you're gay.
Especially right now, when all the rules
are changing. Within the next two years
the state of Hawaii will probably remove
gender restrictions from its marriage
licensing process. The state's supreme
court has asked the state to come up" with"
a good reason why male / female couples
should be given the privilege to marry
while same-sex couples should be denied
this privilege. The state hasn't come up
with anything good yet. So it could be wed
ding bells for many blushing brides and
grooms soon.
The religious right is going berserk.
The specter of same-sex marriage has
become an enormous cash cow for them
and sparked one of their most swift and
effective campaigns yet. Christian con
servatives have flooded Hawaii, trying
to amend the state's constitution. In
almost 30 other states, they've
launched similar efforts to restrict mar
riage to male / female couples. Legisla

tures across the country are clamping
down on their definitions of marriage.
States whose laws did not previously
define marriage as a male / female pair
ing are now rewriting those laws, detail
ing their marriage laws to make the bias
against same-sex couples explicit. Even
though no same-sex couple has ever
been granted a marriage license in any
state, the drive to codify and narrow the
definition of marriage is barreling
ahead.
The logic of this movement escapes
me. Is marriage only precious for some
if it is denied to others? And what does
such a vociferous response say about
our insecurity over marriage? Is the
"foundation of American society" really
"gbinj^To crumble if Jane and Jill* "are
allowed to get hitched?
Ironically, in the blind rush to defend
marriage, the religious right is making
a mockery of the institution. Consider
for a second the implications of this
rigid exclusivity: I could pick up my
friend Julie, drive to Vegas, pay less
than $100 at a drive-through window
and leave married. I don't even have to
get out of my car and this contract
would be legally binding in all 50 states,
would entitle us to spousal benefits
from employers, joint income-tax
returns, family rates at Disneyland,
hospital visitation rights and the chance
to adopt children.
Conversely, if I met the right boy

next year (again, God willing) we could
never be married, regardless of our
commitment to one another. If we
shared a house, a bank account, parent
ing responsibilities, a bed, a toothbrush
— none of it matters. I could pledge to
throw myself on his funeral pyre —
irrelevant. Nothing could win our union
the same legal recognition as the "nup
tials, fries and a coke" ceremony that
Julie and I enjoyed.
Establishing the value of marriage
through exclusivity makes absurd dou
ble standards like this possible. It
insults the institution of marriage to
argue that it can only represent and
support a single type of love. It makes
gender a singular, inviolable criterion
for honoring a relationship and destroys
the connotations of intimacy and com
mitment that marriage should have.
Artist Kate Bornstein provided the
best perspective on issues of love and
gender with the phrase, "The opposite
sex is neither." Love is not about oppo
sites and not about sex. It's the courage
to face a risky and uncertain world with
another person and say, "I'm watching
out for this one, and they are looking out
for me." Marriage should reflect this.

really, well, wonderful.
