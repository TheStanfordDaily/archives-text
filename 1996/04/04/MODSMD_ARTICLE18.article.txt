Stanford's plan options don't reflect real world

AN ARTICLE IN Tuesday's Daily
about a study of Stanford's
employee benefit plans goes a
bit far in implying that the universi
ty's experience sheds valuable light on
the validity of managed competition.
Far from it, Stanford's availability
of generous options among competi
tively-priced health plans is not the
norm in the non-academic world. The
recent trend of acquisitions and merg
ers of insurers and HMOs also casts
serious doubts that enough players
will be left around for true competi
tion to take place. And new evidence is
emerging that a substantial majority
of consumers still show preference for
fee-for-service plans.
A recent study by the U.S. Depart
ment of Labor found that in compa
nies which offer several health plans
— from the expensive fee-for-service
to Health Maintenance Organizations
(HMOs) and Preferred Provider Orga
nizations (PPOs) — fee-for-service
plans are still the most common
choice. When fee-for-service plans

were offered along with HMOs,
approximately 60 percent of full-time
employees chose a fee-for-service plan.
When the combination of offerings
included fee-for-service plans and
PPOs, employee choices were evenly
divided. When all three types were
offered, fee-for-service plans were cho
sen by 40 percent, while HMOs and
PPOs were each selected by 30 percent
of the employees.
Since the share of health care con
sumers covered by fee-for-service
plans declined in recent years, one
possible explanation for continued
interest in fee-for-service is that such
plans have taken steps to curb costs
through deductibles, pre-admission
certification, utilization review for
expensive procedures, and price reduc
tions for care received from designated
physicians and hospitals. It makes
sense that some consumers will choose
to pay a higher premium to maintain a
long-standing relationship with a par
ticular physician, while others with
little history of illness may choose a

plan on the basis of cost alone.
For Stanford employees, a key fac
tor in deciding whether to choose any
of the four University plans may
depend both on the comprehensive
ness of coverage and convenience and
the ability to receive all types of care
at one site — the Stanford Health Ser
vices, the Palo Alto Medical Clinic or
any of the other medical practices
nearby, for example.
Professor Alain Enthoven's conclu
sion that managed care has made
Stanford people price conscious when
it comes to choosing medical plans is
correct. But it would be difficult to
infer from Stanford's experience — at
least not yet — that managed competi
tion is a success. New data from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics show that
only two-fifths of full-time workers in
private establishments are offered a
choice of health plans, and nearly one
third of those who are offered health
insurance can choose from more than
one type of plan.
For patients and their physicians,

as well as employers, the current
trend of big insurers shelling out bil
lions of dollars to gobble up smaller
companies and HMOs, then trying to
recoup their investment costs defies
the very idea of managed competition
that Professor Enthoven and his col
league, Dr. Paul Ellwood, have worked
so hard to develop. The goal of man
aged competition, as I understand it
from reading their papers, was not
revenue enhancement to line the pock
ets of insurers and providers, but to
streamline medical practices and to
bring costs in line with what the
nation can afford.
Cost cutting has occurred of course,
but it seems unlikely to continue as
health care industry mergers and
acquisitions proceed at a frantic page
leaving around a handful of insurance
monopolies calling the shots and offer
ing less choice for everybody.
