# Josh Gohlke: Laughing leads to crying
## Stroking my ego — my friends, an RV and Oregon 
### 
THERE MAY COME a time in your
life when you're happy at last.
Maybe you're finally becoming
esteemed and well-liked on your own
terms. Perhaps you've got a decent job
lined up and a girl who's built like a brick
shithouse and, man, you probably think
you're pretty damn cool.
That's when it's a gocxl time to cram
yourself into a small, enclosed space and
drive to a cold, remote place with five peo
ple who have no respect for you whatsoev
er.
Not having enough money or desire to
take a plane somewhere like Hawaii for
spring break, five of my friends and I decid
ed to take an RV to the country's second
most-popular vacation spot, Oregon.
It started out tolerably well, driving
through the picturesque Napa Valley.
"This is great, watching all this beauti
ful scenery through the windows," Craig
said. "It's just like TV. Man, I love TV."
Craig made a lot of important, arbitrary
rules to keep us in line during the trip. His
most important rule was: "No using the RV
bathroom. Especially you, Gohlke!"

The first night we camped on the beach
in northern California. We took a picture of
Jeff and Craig embracing, with the sunset
in the background. It was romantic.
When we stopped for breakfast in Elk,
Calif., an old man grumbled at us, "Stan
ford — just as liberal as ever." And we
weren't even in Oregon yet.
Oregon's first important natural
resource, as far as I could tell, is sand. Ore
gonians like to zip up) and down big sand
dunes in little four-wheel, motorized
coffins. We looked at several places that
rent these vehicles until we found one that
seemed safe.
The safest dune-buggy operation was
managed by a guy in a long-sleeve, purple
and-green Garfield T-shirt. Garfield was
saying, "Give me coffee, and no one gets
hurt!"
When Jacob was speeding up a huge hill
in his dune buggy, he was thinking of just
going down the other side, but at the last
minute he decided to skip and look first.
The other side was a 40-foot vertical drop
into two feet of water.
"I almost died," Jacob said.

"So did we," Jesse and I said.
At a bar in Eugene, Ore., I went to the
bathroom and it said on the chalkboard,
"Gohlke sucks."
"Well, it already said 'sucks,' " Craig
said. "I just wrote 'Gohlke' above it."
We went to another bar in Eugene the
next day and met the head brewer. He
majored in beer and wine at UC-I)avis. We
said, "Hey, we're majoring in beer, too, if
you know what we mean. Whoo!"
While I was driving the RV to Crater
my friends started playing a card
game called "El Presidente." The winner of
the game is the President, and they decided
the last-place person should be called the
Gohlke.
"Oh, you're the Gohlke!" they would say
to the loser.
It was really bad to be the Gohlke.
When we got to Crater Lake, the whole
place was covered with snow, but we decid
ed to go to sleep in our tiny beds rather
than think about how it got there.
The next morning, there was more snow,
but now it was on the RV and the parking
lot and the road. It had come from the skv.

"Do you have a TV in your RV?" the
woman at the gift shop drawled.
"Yeah," we said.
"You should've watched the news last
night," she said.
When we were sliding down the steep,
icy road in the snowstorm a few hours later,
I turned around and said to my friends,
"Guys, this is definitely a column!"
They burst into cheers.
On the way back, we passed through
Weed, Calif., which is the first town I would
go to if I had a rock band. "Nobody parties
like WeedV I would shout to the crowd.
Our last stop was Chico, Calif., where we
went to the Sierra Nevada brewery. The
old, fat man who manages the place was
impolite to us because he doesn't like young
punks. But the security guard liked us so
much that he filled up our gallon milk con
tainer with free beer. He's going into the
Navy soon, but while he was in community
college he pledged Phi Delta Theta because
they were the "biggest partiers."
He was the coolest Phi Delt I ever met.
Also in Chico, Louis and Craig and I
went to the most depressing carnival ever.

Craig made me go on the "Zipper." We sat
down in a tiny cage and a speed-addict
worked a machine that filing us in concen
tric circles until we no longer knew our
names.
"Squeal, little piggies," the speed-addict
said.
"Come on, you sissy faggots!" another
man advertised his carnival game.
"Three guys from E-storce-ia," the Ferris
wheel operator conspiratorially greeted us.
The trip taught me a lot about America,
but what it taught me about myself, was
most important.
I can always depend on my friends to
remind me that, despite any illusions I may
have to the contrary, the Gohlke is the last
thing anyone would want to be.
"Sorry you had to find out from us," my
friends said.

Josh Gohlke has no classes, no direction,
two more months of spring break and only
a slight will to live.
