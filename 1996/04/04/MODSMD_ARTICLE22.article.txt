## Track and field heads north for the weekend Cardinal will compete against Oregon and Washington State this Saturday in Eugene 
### Sam Wang Contributing writer 
It will be a homecoming of
sorts for many of the Cardinal
athletes when the Stanford
track and field team heads
north to Eugene, Ore., this
weekend to compete in a trian
gular meet against Pacific 10
Conference rivals Oregon and
Washington State.
Eleven members of the Car
dinal squad originally hail from
the Pacific Northwest, but Pac
-10 powerhouse Oregon and the
up-and-coming Cougars of
Washington State promise to
make these athletes' visit home
a little uncomfortable.
()n t he women's side, Oregon
returns all the key components
of the green-and-gold jugger
naut that rolled to a second
place finish in last year's confer
ence championships. Only the
mighty Lady Bruins of UCLA
kept Oregon from capturing the
Pac-10 crown.
"That's going to be a tough
meet for our women," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "If there is
any team that can give UCLA a
run for their money in the out
door Pac-lOs this year, it's Ore
gon.
"I think Oregon is potential
ly the Pac-10 favorite."
()regon's balance and experi
ence are its biggest assets. The
Ducks' potent crew in the 4 x
400 relay team, which includes
the defending NCAA champion
in the 400, ensures that the
Oregon women will also get
plenty of points from the indi
vidual 400- and 200-meter
events.
Oregon also has many con
tributors in the field disciplines,
including a solid corps of throw
ers and jumpers. And its mid
dle-distance and distance run
ners match up well with Stan
ford's talented group of ath
letes.
Even though Washington
State has an excellent squad in
the field events, it cannot quite
match Oregon's depth and tal
ent in the longer running
events. That gives Lananna rea
son to believe the women's meet
will be a fight between the Car

dinal and the Ducks.
"I think the competition on
the women's side will be clearly
between us and Oregon," he
said.
As for the men, it should be
interesting to see if the Cardinal
sprinters can keep the form that
led to victories in the 100, 200,
400 and 4 x 100 last weekend.
This week, they have the unen
viable task of facing some very
talented competition in the
likes of Pat rick Johnson and La
mond Woods. Those two led the
Ducks to second place in the
Pac-10 last year. But Lananna
still has confidence his guys will
be able to carry this heavy load.
"Oregon's got some great
sprinters. They are very, very
strong. They will have a hella
cious 4 x 100," Lananna said.
"But with the way [Anthony]
Bookman, [Damonj Dunn,
[Jimmiel Johnson and Jauron
Pigg look, I think we might be
able to stay close to them."
As is the case with their fe
male counterparts, the Oregon
men make up a well-balanced
team, with the middle-distance
and distance events being their
traditional strengths.
Relative to the rest of the
conference, however, the Ore
gon men are not as strong as the
women. The Washington State
men, on the other hand, will
play a more significant role in
this meet than the Cougar
women.
The Cougars have a great
group of jumpers and throwers
that should keep WSU competi
tive. But Lananna hopes Oregon
and Washington State will nulli
fy each other enough for his men
to sneak in with a good finish.
"I'm hoping what is going to
happen is that Washington
State's strengths will balance
out Oregon's strengths, and
then hopefully we'll sneak in on
our strengths," he said.
This weekend's meet marks
the temporary end of head-to
head competition for the Cardi
nal. After their trip to Eugene,
the Stanford athletes will com
pete in a series of invitationals
which will take them right up to
the Big Meet against Cal on May
4, and then into the Pac-10
