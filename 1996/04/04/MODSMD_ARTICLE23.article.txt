# Men's gymnastics takes aim at MPSFs
## Men head for conference championships after win over Army, San Jose State 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
Three months and six meets
later, members of the Stanford
men's gymnastics team have put
all head-to-head competition be
hind them and are now focusing
their attention on the postseason
championship meets. First up:

the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration championships tomorrow
and Saturday at UC-Santa Bar
bara.
The Stanford men wrapped up
regular-season competition two
weeks ago with a home meet ver
sus Army and San Jose State. The
Cardinal finished with a disap
pointing total score of 222.6 —

one of their lowest scores all year
— but still managed to stay ahead
of the Cadets (215.75) and the
Spartans (213.15).
Head coach Sadao Hamada had
been aiming for a total team score
of at least 227, but the team fell
short of his expectations as the
men committed errors through
out the meet.

Hamada downplayed the com
petition, writing it off as a "rough
night."
"At least no one got hurt," he
said. "It's always tough to com
pete without training; my guys
just came out of a Dead Week and
a finals week. I'm not too con
cerned about tonight's perfor
mance because I saw a lot of good
things."
Despite the flawed perfor
mances, junior lan Bachrach per
formed solidly, scoring a 9.8 on
the floor exercise — good for first
place — and securing the top spot
in both the rings and vault.
But while Bachrach was happy
with his own performance, his pri
mary concern was for the team.
"We're lacking the cohesive
ness of a team," he said. "I'm hop
ing that we can really work hard
as a team, and that by MPSFs we
show significant improvement."
In preparation for the MPSF
tournament, the team practiced
twice daily over spring break and
will continue to buckle down in
hope of nailing down some much
needed consistency.
Thus far, the team has yet to
produce "a really great score,"
said team captain Peter Hegi.
"[That] would bring the team
much-needed confidence."
The Cardinal men must work
to build up the discipline and con
sistency necessary for great per
formances and great scores, he
added. They hope to accomplish
both goals this weekend at the
MPSF tournament in Santa Bar
bara. .
MPSFs serve as a practice tour
nament for the NCAA West Re
gional competition, which takes
place April 13 in Lincoln, Neb.
The same six teams that will com
pete in Santa Barbara will be com
peting in Nebraska, but the stakes
at regionals will be considerably
higher.
The team's performance at the
regional will determine its eligibil
ity for the NCAA championships,
to be held at Stanford April 25-27.
Hamada estimates the team will
need to score 230-plus points in
order to win the title for the sec
ond consecutive year.
The team knows that these last
few weeks will be do or die, and ex
pectations are running high.
"I'm hoping by MPSFs we can
show the country that we are one
of the best teams in the nation,
with or without Tim [Dalrymple,
who is out for the year with a neck
injury]," Bachrach said.
