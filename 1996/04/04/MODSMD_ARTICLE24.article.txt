# Volleyball says aloha to nation's top-ranked team
## Fourth-ranked Cardinal in Hawaii for two matches vs. 23-1 Rainbows 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
The fourth-ranked Stanford men's volleyball
team resumes action this weekend with a pair of
critical Mountain Pacific Sports Federation match
es against top-ranked Hawaii. The three-day affair
in I Jonolulu begins tonight with a 7 p.m. showdown,
followed by a 7:30 p.m. match on Saturday.
Trying to hold off Pacific for the third automatic
playoff berth in the MPSF's Pacific division, Stan
ford needs at least a split this weekend to maintain
its slim edge on the Tigers. Meanwhile, Hawaii is on
a quest to become only the sixth NCAA men's vol
leyball team to finish unbeaten in conference play.
"We've always had all-out battles with Stan
ford," said Hawaii head coach Mike Wilton. "We ex
pect this weekend to be no different. Stanford is
playing very well right now."
While the results indicate strong play, Cardinal
head coach Ruben Nieves is nevertheless concerned
with his team's performance. While playing impres
sively in three-game routs of Ohio State and No. 3
Long Beach State last month, Stanford has also had
to sweat out five- and four-game nail-biters against
Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount, respectively.
"In short, we're not steamrolling along," Nieves
said.
Nonetheless, there have been several standout
performers for Stanford during the streak. The
team has gotten a big boost from the return of junior
middle blocker Brian Moore, who has been recover
ing from a nagging foot injury. Despite seeing limit
ed action last weekend against Loyola Marymount,
Moore has traveled with the team and looks to make
an impact this weekend.
Meanwhile, junior opposite hitter Matt Fuer
bringer has climbed to third nationally in kills per
game at 6.7, while junior setter Stewart Chong is av
eraging over 17 assists per game, also good for third
in the country. Sophomore swing hitter Devin Pool
man and sophomore middle blocker Keenan White
hurst have also continued to put up big numbers.
"[Poolman's] jump-serving and hitting really
help the team," Nieves said. "Keenan has been pret
ty darn consistent, putting in a workmanlike effort
every night."
As a team, the Cardinal is hitting .349, fifth-best
in the nation. "They have lots of ability," Wilton
said. "They are a very big blocking team and have a
very talented setter in Stewart Chong. He's a player
we wish had come to Hawaii."
The Rainbows come into this pair of matches
sporting a 23-1 overall record and looking to com
plete the greatest season in school history. They

have already clinched the Pacific
Division and a berth in the MPSF
playoffs.
Offensively, Hawaii is led by
sophomore Yuval Katz, an oppo
site hitter from Haifa, Israel, who
has 502 kills this season. Junior
swing hitter Aaron Wilton and

sophomore swing hitter Naveh
Milo also bring heat up front, av
eraging a combined eight kills per
game. With so many options, se
nior setter Erik Pichel leads the
nation in assists, averaging nearly
20 per game.
When not putting down kills,
the Rainbows freeze their oppo
nents with blistering service aces.
Katz's deadly jump serve has pro
duced 40 aces to lead a team that
has 184 aces this season to its op

ponents' 73. He is followed closely
by Milo with 33, while Pichel has
registered 24.
"They are the leaders in jump
serving, bar none," Nieves said.
"And while their defense doesn't
block particularly well, they make
up for it in their digging."
The men will not only have a
chance to blemish Hawaii's unde
feated conference mark today and
tomorrow, but they can also bol
ster their once-dim postseason

prospects. To do so, however, the
Cardinal must overcome the in
consistency that has tainted its re
cent win streak.
"We've got to hope our bad
spells are short," Nieves said.
"There's no doubt Hawaii can
take advantage of our mistakes
and lapses because they are much
better equipped to do so. We can
beat Hawaii, but we'll have to put
together one of our best perfor
mances of the year."
