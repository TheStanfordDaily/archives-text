# Volleyball says aloha to nation's top-ranked team
## Fourth-ranked Cardinal in Hawaii for two matches vs. 23-1 Rainbows 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
The fourth-ranked Stanford men's volleyball
team resumes action this weekend with a pair of
critical Mountain Pacific Sports Federation match
es against top-ranked Hawaii. The three-day affair
in I Jonolulu begins tonight with a 7 p.m. showdown,
followed by a 7:30 p.m. match on Saturday.
Trying to hold off Pacific for the third automatic
playoff berth in the MPSF's Pacific division, Stan
ford needs at least a split this weekend to maintain
its slim edge on the Tigers. Meanwhile, Hawaii is on
a quest to become only the sixth NCAA men's vol
leyball team to finish unbeaten in conference play.
"We've always had all-out battles with Stan
ford," said Hawaii head coach Mike Wilton. "We ex
pect this weekend to be no different. Stanford is
playing very well right now."
While the results indicate strong play, Cardinal
head coach Ruben Nieves is nevertheless concerned
with his team's performance. While playing impres
sively in three-game routs of Ohio State and No. 3
Long Beach State last month, Stanford has also had
to sweat out five- and four-game nail-biters against
Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount, respectively.
"In short, we're not steamrolling along," Nieves
said.
Nonetheless, there have been several standout
performers for Stanford during the streak. The
team has gotten a big boost from the return of junior
middle blocker Brian Moore, who has been recover
ing from a nagging foot injury. Despite seeing limit
ed action last weekend against Loyola Marymount,
Moore has traveled with the team and looks to make
an impact this weekend.
Meanwhile, junior opposite hitter Matt Fuer
bringer has climbed to third nationally in kills per
game at 6.7, while junior setter Stewart Chong is av
eraging over 17 assists per game, also good for third
in the country. Sophomore swing hitter Devin Pool
man and sophomore middle blocker Keenan White
hurst have also continued to put up big numbers.
"[Poolman's] jump-serving and hitting really
help the team," Nieves said. "Keenan has been pret
ty darn consistent, putting in a workmanlike effort
every night."
As a team, the Cardinal is hitting .349, fifth-best
in the nation. "They have lots of ability," Wilton
said. "They are a very big blocking team and have a
very talented setter in Stewart Chong. He's a player
we wish had come to Hawaii."
The Rainbows come into this pair of matches
sporting a 23-1 overall record and looking to com
plete the greatest season in school history. They
