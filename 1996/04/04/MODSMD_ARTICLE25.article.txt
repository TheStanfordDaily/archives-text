# Sun Devils on deck for No. 13-ranked Cardinal
## Baseball to meet No. 16 Arizona State tonight at Sunken Diamond in first of three-game set 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
At the halfway point of the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division schedule, No. 13 Stan
ford (21-12 overall) finds itself
right where it expected to be at
the beginning of the season — in
the thick of the race for the
league title.
Three weeks ago the Cardi
nal struggled against confer
ence rival USC, as the Trojans
administered a three-game
sweep at Sunken Diamond,
leaving Stanford with a 3-6
record in the Six-Pac. But head
coach Mark Marquess' squad
has turned things around since
then, winning seven of its last
eight contests. The Cardinal
kicks off a three-game series
versus No. 16 Arizona State (22-
13,6-9 in the Six-Pac) tonight at
7 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
In its past two conference se
ries, the Cardinal has taken two
of three from California and
swept Arizona to lift its record
to 8-7, good for sole possession
of third place in the division.
USC sits atop the standings at
11-4, with UCLA (10-5) one
game back.
Marquess was pleased with
the position his team earned by
sweeping Arizona last weekend.
"It was a good way to finish
up the first half," he said. "To
end up 8-7 after we were 3-6 be
fore our (final exams] was big
for us."
Center fielder Jody Gerut be
lieves the team has picked up its
play and will look to build on its
momentum as Stanford faces its
Six-Pac foes the second time
around.
"It really gives us a lot of mo
tivation going into the second
half," Gerut said after the Ari

zona series. "We have a lot of
confidence now that those other
teams have lost a few games."
Following the Arizona sweep
last week, two Stanford players
mopped up Pac-10 Player of the
Week honors.
Designated hitter A.J. Hinch
and Chad Hutchinson were
named Pac-10 Southern Divi
sion Player and Pitcher of the
Week, respectively. Hinch paced

Stanford offensively, going 11-
for-18 (.611) in four games. The
senior smacked six extra-base
hits, including three home runs
and three doubles, good for
eight RBIs and six runs scored.
The award is the second for
Hinch, who was also named
Player of the Week in 1995.
Hutchinson (3-1), a fresh
man right-hander, picked up
two wins for the Cardinal in out
ings at Nevada on March 26 and
against Arizona last Sunday.
Hutchinson tossed his first col
legiate complete game against
the Wildcats, striking out eight.
At Nevada, he worked 7 1/3 in
nings, surrendering one run
and two hits while tallying an
other 10 strikeouts.
Stanford hopes to ride its re
cent success into this weekend's
three-game matchup with the
Sun Devils. The Cardinal won
the first series between the two
teams, winning twice at ASU's
