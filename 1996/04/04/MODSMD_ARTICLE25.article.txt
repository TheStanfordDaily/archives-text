# Sun Devils on deck for No. 13-ranked Cardinal
## Baseball to meet No. 16 Arizona State tonight at Sunken Diamond in first of three-game set 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
At the halfway point of the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division schedule, No. 13 Stan
ford (21-12 overall) finds itself
right where it expected to be at
the beginning of the season — in
the thick of the race for the
league title.
Three weeks ago the Cardi
nal struggled against confer
ence rival USC, as the Trojans
administered a three-game
sweep at Sunken Diamond,
leaving Stanford with a 3-6
record in the Six-Pac. But head
coach Mark Marquess' squad
has turned things around since
then, winning seven of its last
eight contests. The Cardinal
kicks off a three-game series
versus No. 16 Arizona State (22-
13,6-9 in the Six-Pac) tonight at
7 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
In its past two conference se
ries, the Cardinal has taken two
of three from California and
swept Arizona to lift its record
to 8-7, good for sole possession
of third place in the division.
USC sits atop the standings at
11-4, with UCLA (10-5) one
game back.
Marquess was pleased with
the position his team earned by
sweeping Arizona last weekend.
"It was a good way to finish
up the first half," he said. "To
end up 8-7 after we were 3-6 be
fore our (final exams] was big
for us."
Center fielder Jody Gerut be
lieves the team has picked up its
play and will look to build on its
momentum as Stanford faces its
Six-Pac foes the second time
around.
"It really gives us a lot of mo
tivation going into the second
half," Gerut said after the Ari

zona series. "We have a lot of
confidence now that those other
teams have lost a few games."
Following the Arizona sweep
last week, two Stanford players
mopped up Pac-10 Player of the
Week honors.

Stanford offensively, going 11-
for-18 (.611) in four games. The
senior smacked six extra-base
hits, including three home runs
and three doubles, good for
eight RBIs and six runs scored.
The award is the second for
Hinch, who was also named
Player of the Week in 1995.
Hutchinson (3-1), a fresh
man right-hander, picked up
two wins for the Cardinal in out
ings at Nevada on March 26 and
against Arizona last Sunday.
Hutchinson tossed his first col
legiate complete game against
the Wildcats, striking out eight.
At Nevada, he worked 7 1/3 in
nings, surrendering one run
and two hits while tallying an
other 10 strikeouts.
Stanford hopes to ride its re
cent success into this weekend's
three-game matchup with the
Sun Devils. The Cardinal won
the first series between the two
teams, winning twice at ASU's
Packard Stadium.
Arizona State continues to put
up impressive offensive totals, as
the club averages more than nine
runs per game and boasts a .325
team batting average. The Sun
Devils are led by four offensive
standouts: center fielder Mike
Moreno (.390, 8 HR, 33 RBIs),
third baseman Mike Torti (.349, 7
HR, 38 RBIs), first baseman Rob
bie Kent (.343,6 HR, 43 RBIs) and
right fielder Dan McKinley (.338,
6 HR, 31 RBIs). The foursome has
also stolen 26 bases in 26 at
tempts.
In the team's series with
at Packard Stadium last weekend,
Kent went 8-for-12 (.667) with six
RBIs and four runs scored. Kent
was named the Pac-10 Player of
the Week earlier this year.
Stanford has also posted out
standing offensive totals over its
last seven games. Hinch, who has
been in the designated hitter role
since injuring his throwing shoul
der six weeks ago, is batting .416
with nine home runs and 30 RBIs,
all team highs. His home run total
matches a career-high set last
year.
Meanwhile, sophomore Joe Kil
burg has raised his average to .343
by putting together an eight-game
hitting streak. The right fielder
has already posted career-high
marks in home runs (4) and RBIs
(23).

Also hot since the USC series is
freshman Jody Gerut (.303, 4 HR,
27 KB Is). Batting in the second
spot in the lineup, Gerut has
racked up 10 RBIs in the past four
games, including six in a 14-2 victo
ry over Arizona last Friday night.

Entering the second half of the
Six-Pac schedule, the Cardinal
hopes to win each weekend series,
make a run at the league champi
onship and possibly earn the right
to host a regional in the NCAA
tournament. Judging by its recent

play, those goals are all well in
reach for the Cardinal.
"The Six-Pac is tough," said
sophomore catcher Jon Schaeffer.
"USC started out beating up on
some teams, but things have
evened out since then."
