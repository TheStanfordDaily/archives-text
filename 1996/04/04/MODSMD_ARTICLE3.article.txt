# Nurses union reaches contract settlement
## 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Stanford Health Services has reached an
agreement on a new two-year contract with the
union representing more than 1,000 bedside
nurses at Stanford Hospital.
The new contract calls for an average annu
al salary increase of 2.5 percent for the next two
years. It also has provisions for job security in
the event of reorganization and increases the
input of nurses in making emergency changes
in staffing levels.
The agreement, the result of bargaining car
ried out over the past three months, was rati

fied last month by the union, the Committee
for the Recognition Of Nursing Achievement
(CRONA), after a vote of its membership. The
new contract primarily is with nurses working
at inpatient units rather than clinics.
Felix Barthelemy, SHS director of human
resources, said that while "it was a very diffi
cult negotiation for both sides," the process
they used — which he called "interest-based
bargaining" — kept the talks from becoming
adversarial.
One of the management negotiators, Assoc.
Director of Nursing Laurie Gunderson, agreed
that the process kept the negotiations con
structive. She explained that it involved both

sides discussing each issue in general rather
than each arriving with a position worked out
in advance. While she thought it was more
strenuous than traditional processes, she also
called it "more satisfactory to both manage
ment and unions."
No representative from CRONA could be
reached for comment.
In addition to the pay raise, management
gave a job-security guarantee to nurses whose
positions may be eliminated by reorganization
or given to an agency other than SHS.
Barthelemy mentioned SHS's discontinuation
of outpatient kidney dialysis and
the cooperation between Stanford
and UC-San Francisco changes
that might cause dislocation.
Nurses have a guarantee that
they will either be placed with the
new agency, placed elsewhere in
the hospital, given re-training or, if
these are all unavailable, receive
severance benefits. In addition, if
reorganization puts a nurse into a
lower-paid job, SHS will make up
the difference for the two years of
the union contract.
Barthelemy called this "a for
malization of what we have been
doing in the past," noting that SHS
had traditionally helped nurses in
this way and that there had been
no layoffs of nurses for eight years.
"We recognized [the nurses'] in
securities about what would hap
pen in the future," Gunderson ex

plained, "but it's hard to give guar
antees about the unknown."
The other major part of the new
contract gives nurses more au
thority to change the staffing lev
els at short notice. Barthelemy
said the level of nursing staff at
any given time is determined by an
"acuity index system" which uses
information about how many pa
tients there are and how much care
they require. This is then used
with a complex computer model to
determine how many nurses there
should be.
A manager, usually a registered
nurse who is a management em
ployee rather than a union employ
ee, normally makes any correc
tions in the computer model that
require human judgment. Under
the new agreement, both this man
ager and the resource nurse on
duty, who is a union employee,
have the authority to make
changes in an emergency, depend
ing on which of them is actually
present at the hospital.
