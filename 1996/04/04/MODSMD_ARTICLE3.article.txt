# Nurses union reaches contract settlement
## 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Stanford Health Services has reached an
agreement on a new two-year contract with the
union representing more than 1,000 bedside
nurses at Stanford Hospital.
The new contract calls for an average annu
al salary increase of 2.5 percent for the next two
years. It also has provisions for job security in
the event of reorganization and increases the
input of nurses in making emergency changes
in staffing levels.
The agreement, the result of bargaining car
ried out over the past three months, was rati

fied last month by the union, the Committee
for the Recognition Of Nursing Achievement
(CRONA), after a vote of its membership. The
new contract primarily is with nurses working
at inpatient units rather than clinics.
Felix Barthelemy, SHS director of human
resources, said that while "it was a very diffi
cult negotiation for both sides," the process
they used — which he called "interest-based
bargaining" — kept the talks from becoming
adversarial.
One of the management negotiators, Assoc.
Director of Nursing Laurie Gunderson, agreed
that the process kept the negotiations con
structive. She explained that it involved both

sides discussing each issue in general rather
than each arriving with a position worked out
in advance. While she thought it was more
strenuous than traditional processes, she also
called it "more satisfactory to both manage
ment and unions."
No representative from CRONA could be
reached for comment.
In addition to the pay raise, management
gave a job-security guarantee to nurses whose
positions may be eliminated by reorganization
or given to an agency other than SHS.
Barthelemy mentioned SHS's discontinuation
