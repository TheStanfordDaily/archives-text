# Screening Asian America
## The 						San Francisco Asian American Film Festival 
### Athima Chansanchai 
The crowd converged on the hospitality
table set beside the regular ticket
booth .it San Francisco's Kabuki ( he
ater. The tickets in demand the second week
in March were lor the 14th Annual s.in I ran
cisco International Asian American Film Fes
tival (SFIAAII ), an event which became my
life for live days and nights.
A big party that lasted over a week, the fes
tival drew Asian Americans and others from
all over the Hay Area. I he lounge next door to
the Kabuki was used by the National Asian
American Telecommunications Association
(NAAIA, the sponsors of the event) as their
base of operations during the festival. It was
also where all the schmoo/ing, wining and
dining of filmmakers and their groupies took
place.
I he films ranged from the sublime to the
surreal to the downright silly, but all were a
conscious platform upon which Asian and
Asian-American voices and images were al
lowed a rare opportunity to take center stage.
11 was difficult tinhoose among the 100 plus
films offered, but I finally selected film pro
grams which revolved around the theme of
Asian Americans on the fringes of their com
These films represented the gaps that
still exist within AsiAm communities,
spaces where communication is shll lacking
.iiul through which dialogue can be opened.
Sex workers, homosexuals, the children of
interuillur.il marriage and student protest
ers hover on the outskirts of the Asian
American community, and their voices are
the loudest in demanding acknowledg
men I

Sex Workers
CI bases in South Korea are bordered by
camp tow lis that cater to the libidos of the ser
vicemen stationed in the 94 bases throughout
the country. Considered essential to main
taining the morale of the troops, prostitutes
are a staple of these towns. At the same time,
their status within the Korean community has
been consistently low. "Women Outside' is a
film dedicated to these women. I )irectors Park
I lye Jung and J. I l.ikagi take us into the seed
ler side of the Wth parallel, where these
women have nowhere in their culture to turn
to for direction after the\ have embarked on
this path. I he\ become marked women, os
traci/ed by other Koreans and condoned by
the government to keep up relations with the
U.S. military. I he remarkable accessibility to
the bars, the women and their candor reflects
the time and compassion of the directors to
bestow their subjec ts the respect normally de
nied to them. I hrough the camera their sto
ries are heard.
Doubles
"Let the words of intercultural children ol
p.ist and present speak, said director Keggc
I ife '" I he < osby Show"), who introduced his
film, I )oubles: lapan and America's Intercut
tural Children.' 1 he film shows the human
rcmnantsof American occupation in lapan: I
wanted to show a human side to war, a human
sioi \ that continues when milit.it \ operations
have ceased"
I he tilni bounces in extremes, lor some ol
the subjects, their faces are the onh connei
lions to their American fathers. For others,
such as Hawaiian based /;<»/></>, their mixture
is a part of the ethnic pateliwoi k, nothing un
usual. Still others have found a middlcground

from which thcv derive a composite of both
cultures. They belong to neither culture, un
constrained by racial niches, unwilling to let
others define who they are but unable to es
cape society's labels. Instead they must contin
ualh defend their reconciliation with both
cultures to doubters who make them choose
one or the other. "Doubles'' is the term they
have coined, claiming twice the beauty, cul
ture, strength and intelligence of their back
grounds.
Out, Out, Out of the Closet
A never talked about segment of Asian and
Asian American culture that won't be ig
nored, lesbians / gays / bisexuals / transsexu
als were a formidable presence at the festival,
debunking any notion that they haven't
carved out .1 place for themselves.
Some of the films seemed to overcompen
sate for the lack of mainstream screen time de
voted to gay storylines. 1 hen again, the fact
that so many openly gay actors were able to
present themselves as themselves in these films
is a merit in itself. As actors taking on a very
unpopular identity, they are defying societal
constraints and norms to present another as
pect of life others try to shun or shove back
into closets.
"Queer boys forever" is the gay mens'
short series shown on Monday night, March
11. Made up of four films, the program began
with "forever Jimmy," which revved up the
crowd (a mostly male group — I was one of six
women) with its flashy collage of Hong Kong
pop stars set to .1 New Wave soundtrack. Terrv
( lim's "Bottom" is a sobering depiction of gay
Asian stereotypes. The recurring words are
Kxotic, young, smooth, Asian, bottom ..."
Deceased filmmaker Kirby Hsu's "CiOM"
(Cia\ Oriental Male) finds new ways to mix
lood metaphors with identity issues, dishing
up "Potato Queens," "Rice Queens'' and other
assorted labels, ['he climax of the evening
came with Ming S. Ma's "Slanted Vision," til
lering insights into the experiences of gay
Asian men. At times heavy handed, the film
ultimateK wins over audiences with its intri
cate composition of original footage (another
spool of cooking shows with food metaphors
running rampant), interviews with gay Asian
porn stars (real and fictitious), locals who tell
stories from behind blank masks or whose
onh identity is revealed by the angle of their
eyes.
Accompanying that night of male homo
sexuality was the lesbian program on
Wednesday night, with a handful of men in
the audience. A tightly knit community of
women (mostly petite Asian-American
women dressed in black) — whether they
were butch, dyke, femme, transsexual or
transgender— came to see the program of
eight shorts titled "It Ain't Hasy to be Pretty,"
also lovingly referred to as, "It Ain't Pretty
Being Mas v."
I li/a Barriosand I lima 8., recent graduates
of Mills C College Masters of l ine Arts program,
are two filmmakers who emerged at the film

festival as hits with their short experimental
narrative, "Lick." Together they gave the audi
ence a story they could relate to: getting
dumped by a lover. Barrios said that the thing
she would miss most from her relationship
was her lover's "magical tongue." That im
agery stands out in this film, and hence the
name. Their twist on it incorporates an instal
lation piece designed by Barrios, a red corn
dor the ex-lover has to pass through, with r.i
zors on one side and tongues and hands pro
truding out the other side. It is hoped the
woman will choose the tongues and hands
rather than get cut. Their film will also he
shown at London and Italy film festivals.
The receptions after the films were some
times more the talk of the festival than the
films. Receptions followed every major
screening. For instance, the reception follow
ing the first gay film out of South Korea, "Bro
ken Branches," was filled to the brim with
Asians clad in the prerequisite black attire,
smoking cigarettes, eating sashimi and sushi,
listening to Taiko drums and looking ah
solutely fabulous.
Tiananmen Square
I arger than life dynamics encompass
Carma Hinton and Richard Gordon's "The
(iate of lieavenly Peace," the three-hour epic
documentary chronicling the student
protests that led up to the Tiananmen Square
Massacre in 1989. It cuts through the mass
media hype to the drama happening under
neath. 1 luman frailties go hand in hand with
acts ot human bravery when we see the events
as they happen day to day. In hindsight, a dis
organized student movement became a mi
crocosm of government paranoia, with con
spiracy theories running in both camps.
Pieced together through a meticulous col
lection of archival footage and interviews with
some of the foremost leaders of the student
uprising, this film is a remarkable testament to
the power of collective will to not only move
an entire nation but rivet the entire world.
Some of these leaders, such as Chai 1 ing,
emerge as demagogues through the struggle.
"Sympathy fascists," a term I heard used in an
other SFIAAM film, "Like drains of Sand, 1
kept coming up in my head while watching
these students put themselves through hunger
strikes to retain followers and control the
square.
Director Hinton, a China-born American,
defended them and said, "They were making
decisions under tremendous pressure. They're
human." She added, "Real change does not take
place in the streets. It takes place day to day.
No longer outsiders looking in, the
world within the festival was for Asian
Americans to share one another's in
terpretations of their lives, so different from
the stereotypical depictions normally given on
screen. Their characters grapple with issues of
sexuality, interracial marriage, ostracization
from their communities and safeguarding the
ideals of democracy and freedom.
