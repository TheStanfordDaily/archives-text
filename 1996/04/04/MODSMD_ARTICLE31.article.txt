### Story Photos by Craig Garrett 
Not long ago the media got its filthy
hands on a perfectly good revolution
and almost ruined it. I laving begun as
an underground community of women
linked hy music and homemade Vines, riot
grrrl experienced a crisis after it hit the pages

ot Newsweek. The lesson of this ex
perience was clear: when the "au
thorities' try to define you, the
simplified image they make hears
little resemblance to who you really
are and what you really stand tor.
Once society's structures of defini
tion notice you, once they say that
you "exist," you've been tainted,
and you no longer have control
over your own identity.
Now wiser and even more wary
of the power structures of society,
riot grrrl lives on even though, as
tar as the cultural authorities are
concerned, it died as soon as it
eluded their spotlight.
Sleater-Kinney .ire proof of the
longevity of the riot-grrrl spirit.
Named after a street in Olympia,
Wash. — the cradle of the riot grrrl
movement — Sleater-Kinney may
not use the label "riot grrrl" to de
scribe themselves, but that's only
because the term now lies rotting as
tool of the media authorities, .1
sign of the critics' compulsion to
define and conquer. And this band
is not about to be conquered.

Bands like Sleater-Kinney
have understood for a long time that
definition equals control. As lead singer
Corin lucker sang with her former band,
Heavens to Betsy, "If you dissect it, you can
control it / If you uni name it, you can own
it." Riot grrrfs uneasiness with societv s sys
tems of meanings comes out ol a fundamen
tal understanding that gender itscll is a prod
uct of social definitions. At its heart, riot grrrl
was always about questioning gender roles,
especially in the world of music, where play
ing in a punk band was certainly not an ac
cepted place for women. There is no room for
passive femininity in punk, where music is
angry and confrontational, an assault on the
listener.
Singers / guitarists Corin Tucker and (Car
rie Brownstein and drummer foni Ciogin
make music that stands up lor itself and re
fuses to be pushed around. On "Stay Where
You Are", oft the new I.P "Call the Doctor,

Brownstcin sings, "She's dead il you want and
that's me if you want / stuffed in the corner,
'little girl lost' / It's me if you want but it's not

what I want /1 want to burn up the

place, set it on fire." Their

music is
a warn

ing to
any on e

with
pow e r
who would

try to paste
a label on
them or use

them as some- '
tiling they
don't want to
be.

While Sleatcr Kinney are defiant and
angry, the\ also have moments ol
emotional vulnerability, such as
Brownstein's "I asi Song" otf last year's sell 11
tied 10-inch. I his frankness goes against the
masculine rock-and-roll attitude that die tates
how a "rock star" should act. By being emo
tionally sincere, Sleater-Kinnev calls into
question the aloofness that goes along with
the traditional rock musician image.
"A lot of times," explains lucker, "I feel like
when we are in a band that we're supposed to
take over this position of being totally cool,
being suddenly off limits, suddenly we're rock
stars. I just really feel that that's not how I
want to deal with music." In the song "I
Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone," rucker makes
fun of this rock star position: "I wanna be
your Thurston Moore / wrestle on your bed
room floor / always leave you wanting more."
In the competitive world of rock and

roll, cool is a weapon, a

way of be

coming in

vincible by disengaging

from sincere contact. In contrast,

the prini.n \ tl ol ilie community to which
Slc.iter Kinney belong is climin.it compel

itiveness <mci je.ilousv.

"We re.illy try to sup

port othei bands with

women in them that v\e

like, our friends,"

Fucker says, "like

leam Drescb and

Bikini kill and the

I bird Sex, trying

to say that we

don't want to

just clobber

everyone want

ing to get to the top

which is kind of the atti

tude th.it a lot of people have....

If anything is going to get better, it's got

to get better for everyone."

Male-dominated music criticism has
had some trouble grasping this con
cept in writing about Sleater Kinney.
Many critics (myself included) insist on in
quiring about the band's attitude towards its
competitors for the top spot in the music in
dustry's "female rage" niche. When I men
tioned Alanis Morissette, Tucker exclaimed

with disbelief, "Why does everyone always
ask us about her?" Seeing music as a com

petition, a race to the top, male critics he
tray their own mode ol operation in that

they often imagine their endeavors as
some kind of contest, a competition

whore thev use hands to help them
selves get ahead — even hands like Sleater-
Kinney.
"I think that it can he really disturbing
sometimes the way that men deal with

music,'" luckcr explains. "It's in such an un
emotional, very scientific way, that they
have to score points and (make) themselves
look good by reviewing it." From her stand
point, Morissette is an example of this con
cern with getting ahead, through marketing

and record sales. With her multi
platinum album and MTV videos,
Alanis is winning .1 game that
Sleater Kinney aren't interested
in playing. Ultimately, it is the
critics' own fault for seeing
Sleater Kinney s music in the
same terms as Morissette and the
music industry: as competition,
as profits.
"Il seems like she |Moris
set to | is really capitali/ing on a role
and she's really found a niche
| where shecan| be consumed by a
large audience," suggests Tucker.
Sleater Kinney are emphatic in
their unwillingness to lie packaged
for this kind of consumption. In
the song "Taking Me 1 lome," l uck
er lays out the terms of exchange,
"I'm here 011 die counter / with 110
money down / for nine ninety
nine /you're taking me home,"
then refuses them outright:
"NO'I lOK SAI I / NOT YOUR
(lIKI / NOT YOUR Tl I INC."
One ol the reasons for this re
jection of finaix ial success
is that the sacrifices neces
s.ii \ to succeed in today s music

world aiv too great. Sure, women musicians
have garnered some ol the biggest critical and
populai successes ol recent years (a la I'). I lar
vev, I 1/ I'hair, or Courtney love), hut sir
ceeding in the music industry means turning

voursell into what it wants you to be. for

women, this process seems to in

volve appearing in lingerie

on the cover ol Spin

magazine or

singing "Is she

perverted like me?

/ Will she go down

on you in .1 theater?'

or "I'll fuck you till

your dick is blue." Suc

cess, in the music indus
try's eyes, always includes

' playing into fantasies of
what that male-dominated

' industry wants women to be.
Hut Slcater Kinney aren't going

to he its "tiling;" they aren't going to surrender
control of themselves and their music.
In "Sold Out," Tucker takes an aphorism
of the capitalist desire for success and puts a
question mark after it: "Diamonds are a girl s
best friend?" She's asking whether financial
victory is such a worthy goal, but she knows
the answer. Slcater-Kinney and the commu
nity they belong to know that real friendship
is much more important than anything that
comes from competition and monetary suc
cess. Although this kind of friendship means
having to deal with one another's deepest
hurts, ,i community of friends has a value
that cannot be measured, especially by the
cultural "authorities."
