## THE
						AFGHAN WHIGS Black Love 
### 
Though lead Afghan Whigt ireg Dulli isn't
sure â€” "A lie, the truth, which one shall I
use?" near the beginning of Black I ove,"
it doesn't matter because he tells both with
such convincing intensih that even his lies
might as well be the truth. When the same
line reappears halfway through, it becomes
clear to those who are accustomed to the tor
tured / torturing, "I've-got-dick-for-a
brain" persona Dulli tops on the band's last
album, "lientlemen." that lie's got a con
science, too.
While it doesn't quite hit with the same
force that "< ientlcnien does, the added emo
tional and musical complexity of "Black
I.ove" helps to pick up the slack. However
slightly, regret and redemption seep into the
Whigs' powerful formula, where the guitars
build tip the tension of the pieces. I he open
ing track, "( rime Scene, Part One," steadily
mounts 112 rom a mournful organ intro to hi is
tering guitar riffs as Dulli squirms, howling
in throaty desperation that "all the evidence
is piling up on inc."
lightly wound and impeccably com
posed, Black I ove" seems like a concept
album about burned out lives and loves, one
in which I Hilh's cliarac tcrs revel in depravity
without completely overcoming remorse. So
although Dulli struts mcnacingK in the

arson fantasy "(ioing to Town,'' his reckoning
comes in the downcast "Night by dandle
light" .is he silts the wreckage of his psyche in
searching verses like "Do I blame, all my pain
/On the wickedness /1 have arranged?" The
last track, "Haded," is a soulful retrospective
of the rest of the album, as Dulli seeks salva
tion ("Lord, lift me out of the night ") and un
derstanding ("You can believe in me, baby")
before giving into the sec ret that's "gonna kill
you in the end.
Although its easy to lose sight of it in the
midst of the narratives, the music is more
than a match lor the content ol Dulli 's pas
sionate vocals. Ihe shimmering "Honky's
I adder sounds lifted right off "(ientlcnien,"
proving that Dulli s.it his best when lie s at
his brashest and most bitter. More impres
sively, "Blame, 1 tc." takes .1 funky 70s cop
show groove without reverting to parody or
nostalgic camp. I lie tune shows the Afghan
Whigs at their most explosive, .is complexity
and a visceral impact complement one an
other.
