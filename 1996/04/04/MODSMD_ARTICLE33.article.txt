## Phantom Blues 
### 
I lie American musical tradition has
readied a critical juncture. A huge repertoire
of solids exists, and the music itself is begin
ning to prove itself to he timeless.

One needs to look no further than Taj
Mahal's latest album, "Phantom Blues," for
further proof. A collection ol mostly old
rock, soul, and blues standards, the album is
remarkably fresh and expansive.
Taj Mahal has built a career by paying re
spect to the roots ol rock and roll, and his all
encompassing tastes come remarkably close
to defining exactly what is American music.
I he material itsolt is the star, and Taj
Mahal's interpretations are consistently bril
liant. I lis band has a muscular sound, some
how succeeding in making traditional read
ings ol old music sound new.
"l.onelv Avenue, Doc Pomus' powerful
lament on rejection, rattles along with a per
iod mixture ol pain and anger. The track
simply throbs with hurts. Indeed, Mahal may
have even outdone Ray Charles's classic in
terpretation ot the song.
Mahal gets some .ill star help on a few
tracks from brie Clapton and Bonnie Raitt.
Ironically, on "I Need Your l oving," Raitt's
vocals seem rather unnecessary as Mahal's
singing whips the song into a beautifully
chaotic frenzy.
( laptop's additions, however, are nothing
short ol inspired, adding fiery guitar to the
ripe blues ol "Here In The Dark" and
"(You've (iot To) l ove Her With A Peeling."
Both ( lapton and Mahal share a deep under
standing ol the motives and methods of the
blues, and their combined visions creates the
expected sparks.
With "l et I he l our Winds Blow," Mahal
revisits another classic, this time from Pats
Domino. The track rollicks along as was in
tended. and Mahal makes the track sound
absolutely vital. I or a listener uninitiated in
rock and roll, the song could have been writ
ten yesterday.
"Phantom Blues' is a powerful and deep
album, one which will sound as good now as
it will in a hundreds \ears, when music histo
rians look back upon the golden age ol twen
tieth-century American music. That rock
and roll was once seen as a passing lad and
blues as a hopelessly crude musical style is
now simply laughable, more of a testament to

the orthodoxy of American life than the
artistry of the music itself.
