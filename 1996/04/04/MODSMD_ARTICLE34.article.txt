"To all the Refugees out there, this is a
dedication," runs a lyric from the Fugees
cover of Bob Marley's "No Woman, No Cry".
And so this latest album, "The Score" evens
things out for those people who don't always
have the voices to defend themselves. The
Fugees, made up of 1. Boogie (Lauryn Hill),
Bras (Prakazrel) and Wyclef, lead an unin
hibited offensive for themselves and their
Haitian refugee roots, which infuses the
down times in-between the songs.
Their vicious blend of politics, verbal
slamming and genuine musical ability put
the Fugees heads above the rest. Hill's vocals
stand alone. No studios need to mix her at all.
She's smooth. Wyclef's tribute to Bob Mar-

ley's "No Woman, No Cry" takes the music
back from the white appropriators and places
in the hands of the people.
A friend told me about her ideas on the
Fugees' remake of Roberta I lack's "killing
Me Softly,' putting a post-modern spin on its
meaning, and I think she's onto something.
America with its outstretched arms has both
given and taken from both the lugees and
their families, and as a result their music
comes out with an edge.
The l ugees pay much respect to their mu
sical influences, whether it's Marley or I lack
or the flamingos' "1 Only Have byes For
You." The bass-line of "Zealots, is an espe
cially scathing indictment ol industry critics
(including misguided members ol the press
who suggested they should split up) and oth
ers who would pass the Fugees oil as just an
other rap act. Says I boogie in "Ready or
Not," "Frontin' niggahs can be Al (lapone / I
be Nina Simone / defecating on your micro
phone." She goes at the critics again in
"Zealots," with "Despite .ill my theories and
logic / I add a motherfucka so you ignorant
niggahs hear me." They refuse to lay down to
their critics, and their music vibrates with an
infectious energy designed lor around-the
clock play, making your mind think while
your feet are busy groovin'.
Their integrity comes from being ground
ed in a deeper experience of alienation from
their mother country, of being not only aliens
to this country but within black America as
well.
