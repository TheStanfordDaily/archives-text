## GUIDED BY VOICES Under the Bushes Under the Stars BRAINIAC Hissing Prigs in Static Couture 
### 
While the town may lack the glit/ and style
of Seattle, Los Angeles, New York or any of
the big rock music "scenes," Dayton, Ohio, is
currently home to some ot the best bands in
the country. Two of these groups at the top of
the Dayton heap — Cluided by Voices and
Brainiac — take strikingly different ap
proaches to pop music, yet both overflow
with visions and ideas that are all too rare in
a post-"Teen Spirit' alternative culture in cri
sis.
In any given year, it's a good bet that (iuid
ed by Voices will release more great songs
than most record companies. Ihe new 24-
song "Under the Bushes Under the Stars is
the near-perfect follow-up to last years 28-
song "Alien Lanes," just as "Alien Lanes was
the near-perfect follow-up to the previous
year's 20-song "Bee Thousand. With some
of the most engaging melodies in memory,
GBV frontman Bob Pollard's idea bucket
seems bottomless, as he and his bandmates
have been carrying on for over a decade —
through 12 full-length albums and a slew ot
singles and LPs — and they show no signs ol

slowing clown.
In contrast to the gorgeous melancholy ol
"Bee Thousand" and the relentless scruff ol
"Alien I.anes," the general mood ol "Under
the Bushes" is one ol optimism. Over the
usual dusty guitar pop backdrop, Pollard
now sings about "what makes big dadeb
happy, what makes the buzzard buz/," or
ways to "trigger a synapse and tree us Irom
our traps." Tracks like "The Official Ironman
Rally Song," "(Ihosts ol a Different Dream,'
"Underwater Kxplosions" and "Drag Days"
offer strong melodies and upbeat hopes,
while the slower, sadder numbers like "bright
Paper Werewolves," "burning flag Birthday
Suit" and "Acorns & Orioles are too friendly
to be dreary. Highlights include the punky
punch of "Cut-Out Witch" and the tri
umphant fuck you of "Sheetkickers," but the
real strength of any tiuided by Voices record
is its hard-driving consistency. "Under the
Bushes" serves up 24 soni»s without a single

dud, and the jolting transitions
from great track to great track
are just as appealing as the tracks
themselves.
If Guided by Voices are re
sponsible for putting the I )ayton
scene on the map, townmates
Brainiac are the ones to keep it
from ever being pigeonholed.
Their last LP "Bonsai Superstar"
and their recent "Internationale"
single promised great things, but
few could expect that Brainiac
would deliver something as rev
olutionary as "Hissing Prigs in
Static Couture." High-voltage,
sci-fi punks, Brainiac (with pro
duction help from (iirls Against
Boys' l.li janney) somehow as
semble beats, blips, hisses,
screeches and noise blasts into
some of the best-sounding and
definitely most hyper ( Sorry, Su
perchunk) rock music available.
Irom the pompous strut ol
"This Little Piggy" (with Speak
and-Spell backing vocals) to the
shockingly smooth ride of "Hot

Seal ( .m l Sit Down," Braini.k si ill match
their reckless experimentation with tight
music ianship and strong songwi iting. I r.u ks
I ike "70 Kg Man," "Nothing Invert ihanges" "I
Am a (bracked Machine" and "I'ussylootin'
dazzle with an innovative Irenzy, complete
with weird tunings and timings that show
that the band is really too smart to he com
pletely out ol their minds.
