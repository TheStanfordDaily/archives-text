# THE 						YOUNG DUBLINERS
## Breathe 
### 
The Young Dubliners arc a group ih.it
evolved from .1 traditional Irish folk pair into

a raucous septet that specializes in folk / elec
tric rock. But in their first full length alhum
"Breathe," their sound is not so easily catcgo
ri/ed.
Fortunately, in this transition, the group's
co-founders Keith Roberts and Peter OToole
have not forgotten their units, as heard in
several songs where traditional Irish instru
incuts sut h as a mandolin, banjo, harmonica,
Jew's harp and fiddle are used. The instru
incuts are a good companion to the song's
themes. lor instance, " I hunder," a song
about spiritual awakening and hope, opens
with ol the pure sounds o! the electric guitar
belore O lonic's brooding voice is heard.
I here are also a couple ol traditional Irish
dillies, complete with launty tunesand spoil
(aneous veils. I lowever, the upbeat soundsdo
not disguise the serious lyrics. "follow Me
Up lo (!arlow," .1 fierce battle cry song, dales
back lo the 17th century, "loggy Dew" re
counts the rebellion, where seven Irish
rebels seized Dublin's (ieneral Post Office
aiming to dely the oc«.upving British lorces.
I'lie rebels were caught and executed. But this
just motivated the Irish to keep fighting tor
their freedom. () loole leels that the song is a
part ol Ireland's identity and heritage.
I Ins is not to sav that the group ol Roberts
(vocals, acoustic guitar), O Toole (\tH.ils,
guitar, mandolin, harmonica, banjo). Randy
Woollord (electric guitar, vocals), letl Del
lisanli I sax, tin whistle, piano), Bren I lolmes
(bass). lon Mattox (drums, percuvsion) and
( has Walt/ (violin, vocals) does not explore
tlie usual roik themes ol pain, sullering, and
anger. I lowever, the Young Dubliners give a
ilifferenl perspective «»n these mollis. "Wash
Mv 1 lands, is a song about a 111.111 who seeks
solace from the demands ol "reality," ol
everyday existence. 0"loole sings "wash my
hands /taste mv soul, should lei go / just
leave me alone."
The Young Dubliners sound is unii|ue.
Indescribable. Unless you wanl tosavthat it's
mix ol lolk. hard rock,country, ja//,and Irish
tunes. Bui even then, this list does not quite
explain I lie style ol "Mary" or" I hunder and
a couple ol other songs 011 the album.
So the thing lo do is simply sil back and
enjoy the lovely music.
