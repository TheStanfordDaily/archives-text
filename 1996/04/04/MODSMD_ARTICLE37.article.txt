# Jay Leno
## Late night schmoozer 
### Jodi Triplett 
■ was eating a hot dog for lunch when the
phone rang. It was a press agent from
"The Tonight Show" calling to ask if In
termission wanted to have an interview with
lav Leno. 1 choked in mid-wiener bite, spray
ing small chunks of ball park frank onto the
receiver. "Yes!" I finally managed.
In my initial joy at receiving the assign
ment, I hardly stopped to wonder why lay
Leno would, apparently unbidden, call The
Stanford Daily. And then I learned that
David Letterman is planning an upcoming
appearance in San Francisco. It wasn't too
tough to figure out that Leno is looking for
some publicity here too.
It seems that the talk show media furor of
four years ago may have subsided somewhat,
but the battle for late-night primacy contin
ues. The highly publicized competition be
tween Letterman and Leno came to a head
when Letterman defected to CBS to chal
lenge Leno (and NBC's) late-night hegemo
ny. In the ratings war that followed, Daves
trademarked goofiness nosed him into first
place.
Leno himself acknowledges his rocky start
as host, proclaiming, "The first year of the
show we made some huge mistakes.'
The foremost of these mistakes was a fail
ure to develop his own coinedic style. By try
ing to continue Carson's act, he alienated
both Carson's and his own fans.
Serious internal staff conflicts also had
Leno eating Dave's dust." I he lonight Show
executive producer Helen Rush nick was fired
only six months after Leno ascended to John
ny's throne, after reportedly harassing both
employees and guests.
Lately, however, Leno has had his consid
erable chin in the air.
For one, he stopped aping Carson and is
again comfortable being the funny man his
years performing stand-up proved him to be.
New producers, a new stage and a new band
(led by guitarist Revin F.ubanks) have lent,
we 11... a mnvlife to the show. That and some
heavy advertising during prime-time staples
such as "Friends," "FR and "Seinfeld has
more people sticking with NBC into the wee
hours of post-prime-time.
The initial gap between lay and Dave is
closing.
Leno's improved persona coincided with a
decline in Lettermania — attributable in part
to Dave's abrasive New York attitude at the
1995 Oscars which went over about as well as
Cher's sequined monokini (though not hall
as titillating). Some memorable moves by
lay, like his in-your-face interview with a 1 to
say the least) chagrined Hugh Grant proved
Leno couldn't be blown off as an interviewer.
Also, CBS's prime-time shows simply didn t
have the popular support to keep people
tuned in.
The result? For the past year or so, the two

L's of late-night have been pretty much even.
Which might explain why lay's giving out in
terviews to a college paper.
Mv guess is that Leno is trying to corner
the college market: the Gap-bought-grunge
wearing, unread-copy-ot-Kerouac toting,
soon-to-trade-in-the-frayed-flannel-tor-a
pai r-of- Dockers - and-a- signing-bonus
crowd of Generation Xers who insist they
defy labeling.
lav's PR guys must figure it this way: You
graduate. You get a job. You come home at
nine. You eat vour left-over Chinese tood.
You unwind in front ot the TV. And who bet
ter to unwind with than the prominently
jawed guru of late-night talk shows?
I figure that's about right because, talking
id Ja\ on the phone, it sounded like he
had an agenda. 1 le was careful to bring up
issues particularly relevant to Stanford (and
college campuses in general).
For example, Leno has a reputation in the

"My favorite shows are not
necessarily the celebrities — I
prefer to interview authors.
But people want to see
Elle McPherson, not Amy Tan."

business tor being a nice guy. I asked him
since he was known as such, was there any
thing that upset him, made him mad?
"1 always hear this, 'Well, late-night TV,
it's the Old Boys Club.' And on this show the
executive producer's a woman, the producer
is a woman, the director is a woman ... I m
very proud of the fact that we've tried to open
the show up a bit more in terms ot women
and minority involvement in the program
going with a primarily black band ... that s
what makes me teel best about the program.
lbs reply sounded like something out ot a
PC "How To" manual.
lay went on lo say, 1 he lonight Show
has a lot more minority involvement in
guests. You sec attitudes change. It's a bit like
trying to make a left turn on the Titanic, but
very slowly you see less ot the blonde bimbo
fallingout of her dress and more women who
have something to say. I hat s not to say we
don't do the whole "Baywatch" thing once in
awhile too, but it's a lot more balanced than I
think these shows were years ago.
Finally, when 1 asked him if he felt he had
lost anything in the transition from stand-up
comedian to the host of "The Tonight Show,"
he again brought up the topic of minorities
and women.
"By doing a program where women and
minorities and everybody are featuied
prominently, treated equally, made tun ot

equally as well, you do something to make
people more aware. We're very conscious to
have some Asian, some black, because that s
what the country looks like. When you watch
a lot of television shows everybody seems to
be blonde.
And then to soften it up he added, "It's not
like some sort of political correctness — it's
just the way it is and the right thing to do."
Don't get me wrong— it's extremely laud
able that lay Leno is making an effort to rep
resent all ethnicities and genders on his high
ly watched show. However, it seems remark
able to me that in a 19-minute phone inter
view, he spent a full 10 minutes (unbidden by
the interviewer) fully outlining how well
" The Tonight Show" has incorporated mi
norities and women into its production and
performances.
When asked who his favorite guests were,
1 eno had a similarb college-tailored view
point. He cited authors and other artistic
types but tempered this by saving, "M\ fa

vorite shows arc not necessarily the celebri
ties— I prefer to interview authors. But peo
ple want to see I lie McPherson, not Amy
Tan."
It the rest of the nation perceives Stanford
as the center of laid-back, PC!, savc-the sala
manders intelligence, l.eno comes across as
our man.
Moreover, 1 enos audience is comprised
mainly of white-middle-class-fairly conserv
ative-highly-hyphenated-America. Widen
ing appeal to a younger crowd at a time when
Letterman's ratings are sliding downward is a
smart move.
Besides, it's no secret that the ripped jeans
of today will turn into white-collared shirts
of tomorrow — exactly the market L.eno at
tracts best. In fact, when asked about the
conservative element that comprises his
main audience, 1 eno s reply was both inspir
ing and hip: "Occasionally you make some
people who aren't aware of something more
aware. Yeah, it is a reasonably conservative
type post, but if you can make reasonably
conservative people more aware of a situa
tion and what's going on, then you re accom
plishing a little something.
"Like there was a joke we did the other
night about Pat Buchanan's 'Rainbow Coali
tion;' " he wanted to bring all shades of white
people together, first people laugh at the
joke, just the fact that they get the joke shows

that they understand the situation."
The combination of entertainment with
appeal to intelligence will go far with college
types. More ego-petting passive entertain
ment, please.
Leno may be pandering, but it's undeni
able that he's worked hard to put to
gether a good television program. He
makes no bones about how much work has
gone into getting where he is today. 1 le's up at
7:30 a.m. and often doesn't head to bed until
two or three in the morning.
If it sounds like he can't have time to do
much else, you're right. In his mid-40s, Leno
is married but has no children. He sees his
wife of over 15 years, Mavi., mainly on the
weekends and on road trips.
I his dedication to work isn't limited to his
time on "The Tonight Show" either. About
his own college wars, Leno had this to say - . 1
would go off and do clubs on weekends and
make three or four hundred dollars. It would
cost me sometimes four hundred dollars to
get to the work. So 1 worked as a mechanic to
be able to afford to get to the job.
I eno s choice to increase his exposure is
timely in another aspect as well. " I he Late
Shift," the book that documents the turbu
lent period of Letterman's switch to and
lay's ascension to permanent host of "The
Tonight Show, was recently made into an
II HO movie.
"I read the book but did not see the
movie, Leno said of Ihe Late Shift. 1
didn't see it primarily because then the press
would ask me to comment on it, then you
hear from lawyers... and 1 just said It I don t
see it, it's simpler.' 1 don't have any animosity.
I make my living making tun of everybody. I
spoke to the guy who played me. I'm not the
kind of guy who would ever keep an actor
from work. It's just a part so have tun.
lay's response to " Ihe Late Shift is typical
of his even-tempered reaction to the media
hoopla concerning his competition with Let
terman. I eno looks upon the competition as
a positive force that will hopefully improve
the quality of both shows.
His philosophy is that, "When you do a
show even day, you just have to have an even
temperament. 11 you have these emotional
mood swings you're gonna go batty because
you have to do it every single (.lay. 1 his com
posed attitude certainly gives him points
over the always tunny, but somewhat errati
cally tempered, I etterman.
Of course, if you really want to appeal
to ,i college audience, talking about
how to get a job is a good way to go.
lay's advice for people interested in getting
into television is, "II there's a job you like,
physically go and meet the people who do the
job you want to do. The people on our staff,
the people that work in television, are the peo
ple that physically came here and made an el
fort to somehow get involved in the situation.
About his own job, lay admits lie's got it
pretty good. "Coming from a place like New
Lngland, show business is something you
thought you did until you had to get a regu
lar job. 1 thought, I'll just keep doing this
until I have to do something else.' "
It's a safe bet that lay won't have to do
"something else' for quite some time. Ihe
institution of late-night TV is going to be
here for awhile, and lay is tied at the top of the
proverbial heap.
With any luck (and perhaps a few more
■, well-placed phone calls) he'll stay there.
