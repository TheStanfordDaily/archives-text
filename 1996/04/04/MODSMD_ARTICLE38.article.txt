## Executive Decision 
### 
It's pretty good. Really.
Kurt Russell returns to the action genre
with the airborne thriller "Executive De
cision." (Complex plot lines somehow
weave together to boil down to a hijacked
plane with "enough nerve gas to wipe out
the entire Eastern seaboard" where ex
tremist Muslim terrorists have their tin
gers on the trigger, heading toward Wash
ington, !).(,!. A special task force hoards
the plane by a device engineered to tacili
tate aircraft-to aircraft human transport,

only to lose contact with Washington.
Thus sets up the dilemma: without know
ing if the terrorists have been taken out,
do the military brass shoot down the
plane, killing hundreds of Americans,
wiping out all evidence of the possible
nerve gas; or do they allow the aircraft to
enter United States airspace to possibly
take out the entire l ast ( oast?
"Executive Decision" covers little new
ground. In fact, it doesn't cover any. With
the requisite gadgets and gizmos and cool
looking uniforms and ». ra/y Muslims inter
spersing their terrorist rhetoric with refer
ences to Allah, the film is another in a series
of terrorist/hijacking stories where good
old fashioned American Macdvver like

ingenuity ultimately saves the day. But boy,
is it fun to watch. Director Stuart Baird
leaves the audience hanging at every junc
ture, dripping suspense from the albeit
predictable scenes. Russell is adequate as
the cocky intelligence expert that is forced
to lead the tight-knit fraternity of the elite
operatives. John I.egui/amo ("To Wong
I bo, I hanks lor Everything, Julie New
mar") is solid as the self appointed leader
of the group, as is Oliver Piatt ("l latlin
ers"), who plays a bumbling engineer/com
puter science hacker who is called upon to
defuse the bomb. Halle Berry
("Boomerang") is a brave flight attendant
that helps the Americans despite the risk of
being discovered. A healthy dose ol testos

terone fuels this movie throughout.
"Executive Decision" is not .1 great film;
it follows action thriller paths blazed al
ready by other high-profile films. And
being sandwiched between "Broken
Arrow" and the upcoming'lom Cruise ve
hicle "Mission Impossible" (May 22) may
mean it will get lost in the shuffle. But it is
one of the better action flicks in recent
memory — for a two-hour diversion, a
load of suspense and some cool toys, it
doesn't get much better than "Executive
Decision." You know what's going to hap
pen, but it's a hell of a ride getting there.
One question, though: what is up with
Steven Seagal?
