"The Celluloid ( loset, .1 documentary
based on Vito Kusso's groundbreaking II
book of the same name, ain't afraid to drag
the long hidden skeletons of film lore out of
Hollywood's moth hailed eloset and onto
the screen.
Narrated hy I ill lomlin, thedoeumentary
is a chronicle of gay presence (and denial of)
throughout film history. It excavates cellu
loid gems from the cinematic closet and pol
ishes them until they gleam of out ed bril
liance.
One such gem is a grainy 1895 Thomas
I dison experimental short film ol two men
walt/ing next to a huge, suspended funnel,
l is a peculiar mise-en-scene indeed but,
more importantly, lis a rare moment when
film was unafraid to display intermale ten
derness.
Kxcerpts of black and white Charlie
Chaplin follies and even virgin white Doris
Day/Hock Hudson flirtations, glimpses of
the competitive brawn in Hen llur 'and the
male pin-up show in "Cientlemen Prefer
Blondes'' are revealed to be laden with ho
mosexual tendencies .ts well. Showing such
classic footage alongside insightful com
mentars from movie hi/ insiders (including
quick-witted writer (lore Vidal and trans
sexual dowager/cultural critic Quentin
('risp)," I he ( 'elluloid ("loset" highlights the
homosexual subtexts that even the stringent
Production Code and a passionately homo
phobic industry failed to squelch.

I lie documentary also reveals Holly
wood's attempt to vilify gays and lesbians,
reducing them to stock film stereotypes such
as I he Sissy, I he Victim who cannot bear the
stigma of his/her homosexuality and I he
Ps\i hologicallv I )isturbed Villain (think: the
murderous male duo in Hitchcock's "Rope"
and Sharon Stone .is the quasi lesbian pick
wielder in "Basic Instinct").
1 lie ( elluloid ( loset masterfully ana
lyzes how these stereotypes, alongside well
disguised ga\ nuances, linger in the celluloid
of the silent screen, the (iolden Age and the
repressed n technicolored 19505. However,
when the film delves into the more recent
era of filmmaking, it shifts from a carefully
engineered argument into a hastily arranged
collage of nameless gay film images. It
glosses over homosexuality as portrayed in
modern film, underscoring the impact of
"My Own Private Idaho" and " I he Crying
(iame, and completely overlooking lellini's
"Satryicon," ( hen kaige's "larewell My
Concubine'' and John Waters' "Polyester."
In addition, the documentary shifts from a
detached analysis of film history into a sac
charine sweet homage of homosexual cine
ma, complete with overbearing sentimental
score.
But despite the rushed and oversentimen
tal encapsulation of contemporary gay por
trayals, "The ( elluloid ( loset" is an effective
documentary that exposes what has long
been scratching at I lollywood's closed closet
door, f.njoy "The Celluloid Closet," and
you'll never see Charlton Heston the same
way ever again.
