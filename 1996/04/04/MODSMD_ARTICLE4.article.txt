# Senate ponders role of teaching
## Faculty will consider research pressures 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The proper
balance for
professors be
tween teaching
and research
will come
under discus
sion at today's
Faculty Senate
meeting.

Several resolutions focusing on
the Planning and Policy Board's
recommendations regarding un
dergraduate education will be the
focus of debate at the meeting.
The board released a report,
"Planning in an Era of Change,"
in December to help guide Stan
ford through the next several
years.
Also at today's meeting, the
senate will charge a second Plan
ning and Policy Board, which will
meet during the next few years
and continue to develop a plan for
the University's future.
The report released in Decem
ber recommended that faculty
"commit themselves to enrich
ing undergraduate education

through the teaching of intellec
tually challenging courses de
signed for first- and second-year
students" and that deans of
schools should "ensure that facul
ty are playing the dominant roles
in all undergraduate majors."
The recommendations come
out of a concern that members of
Stanford's Academic Council —
made up of ail full professors —
may not be spending enough time
in undergraduate courses, focus
ing instead on research.
Many faculty feel, however,
that they are already giving all the
time they have to Stanford and
cannot expand their work with
undergraduates, said Senate
Chair Gail Mahood, a geological
and environmental sciences pro
fessor.
Senate members are likely to
"bring up the fact that many peo
ple feel they're already working as
hard as they can," Mahood said.
"For many people, that involves a
lot of time trying to support grad
uate programs. Although they
might like to teach undergradu
ates more, they might not have

t r> —
time to do it."
Four resolutions were devel
oped to help guide discussion dur
ing the meeting, Mahood said. The
senate may vote on the resolu
tions, but "we don't necessarily
expect they will all be adopted,"
she said.
The resolutions suggest that
faculty should provide most of the
course teaching for undergradu
ates; that faculty in undergradu
ate schools should "shift the bal
ance of their research and teach
ing activities slightly in order to
make it possible for faculty to com-

Mit greater energy to enriching
undergraduate education;" that
the Planning and Policy Board
should explore the feasibility of a
point or incentive system to en
sure that research and teaching
are adequately balanced; and that
the board should gather more data
on undergraduate teaching and
advising.
Biology Prof. Pat Jones, a
member of both the senate and the
board, said she feels Stanford is
pretty close to achieving a good
balance between research and
teaching already.
However, she added, "to the ex
tent that there are some faculty
who are superb researchers who
aren't doing much teaching, I
think it's a missed opportunity —

both for the students ... and the
faculty because it's stimulating to
interact with the bright students
we have."
Many Stanford professors can
not offer more in work with either
undergraduates or graduate stu
dents, Chemistry Prof. Michael
Fayer said.
"We already are committing
maximal effort," he said. "We do a
great job with limited resources."
Were professors to shift their
efforts, something would be lost
on one end, Fayer said.
"Devoting more time in one
area means devoting less time to
other areas," he said. "Everything
we do is education."
Much of the time already spent
on research and graduate educa

tion goes to filling out requests for
grants to support the graduate
work, Mahood said. Time devoted
to undergraduate teaching may
come out of grant-writing time,
she said, but then the University
will need to find other resources
for research.
"There's not been a whole lot of
discussion of that," Mahood said,
although University President
Gerhard Casper has mentioned
trying to raise money for begin
ning graduate students.
"If we had ways of supporting
graduate students on fellowships .
. . that would really be good for
everybody," she said. "It would re
lieve some of the pressure on fac
ulty to write grants to support
these kinds of students."
