# Flirting with Disaster
## 
### 
Although "Flirting with Disaster' is an
amusing comedy, it is also rather annoying.
About an hour into the movie I began to feci
restless; the way I Ice I when someone tells too
many puns.
But instead ol puns, this movie relies on
classic character cliches to elicit the pained
chuckles.
It all begins with Mel (ben Stiller), the
nerdy control-freak who decides that the res
olution to his pathetic mid life crisis is find
ing out who his birth parents are.
Then there is the sole appealing charac
ter, Mel's down-to-earth, grounded and
supportive wife Nancy (Patricia Arquette),

who tolerates his neglect and sexual inade
quacy after the birth of their first, yet still
unnamed child.
Next is the neurotic New Yorker, Mel's foster
lewish mother (Mary'lyler Moore), who is not
embarrassed about graphically demonstrating
the wonders of her push- up bra; and her exas
perated, back-seat husband (Cieorge Segal).
Then there is the psycho psychology stu
dent and adoption agent, the recently di
vorced, bitter, beautiful and all-black wearing
I ina (Tea I.eoni). I hough incapable at her
job, she is quite talented at making sure she
gets it all on tape.
The scene thus set, we next encounter a
long string of possible birth parents: from the
Reagan loving Texas-accented alcoholic rich
bitch from San Diego to the scummy gun
possessing hell's angel truck driver to the hip
pie turned newage/"ex-felon pro-acid" com
mune couple.

Along the way we also meet a gorgeous
anil sensitive bisexual writer who is fascinat
ed by bodily functions and his in-the-closet
gay lover, a federal agent.
Although it is interesting to see all of these
contrived characters bafflingly look, awk
wardly talk and eagerly make-out with each
other — it gets old. As the characters become
frustrated with their situation, the audience
becomes even more frustrated with the
movie.
As 1 heard one elderly lady say to her friend
.is she exited the theater, "I 've never seen such
a stupid movie. But stupid does not always
mean bad.
In fact, there is actually some decent acting
in this film and it's humorous. Should you
choose to see it, keep in mind the words of the
hippie-mom advising her acid-tripping
guest, "just go with it."
