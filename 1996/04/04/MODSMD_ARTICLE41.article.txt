## Sgt. Bilko 
### 
Originally a '60s TV slum', "Sgt. Bilko" tills up the big screen with sillv
antics and a cheesy sitcom plot. But it has the good fortune of featuring
Steve Martin as the title character, and his performance makes the movie.
Sgt. Bilko heads a group of soldiers called the "Motor Pool," a team re
sponsible lor Fort Baxter's motorized vehicles. But everyone, including
nincompoop Col. Hill (Dan Akroyd). knows Bilko runs an illegal gam
bling operation. 1 lis elaborate set up includes work tables that convert
into casino tables and living quarters that more closely resemble a frater
nity house than a barracks.
I veryone's having a great time until Major Thorn (Phil I lartman) ar
rives. I lis career was damaged by one of Bilko's scams on another base, so
he decides to ferret out some hard evidence of Bilko's illegal activities
while also threatening to shut down the less-than-productive Fort Baxter
(conveniently providing Bilko with a larger dilemma which, it solved by
him, can save his career and make him a hero). In a completely unneces
sar\ romantic subplot, Thorn also tries to seduce Bilko's fiancee, whom
Bilko has jilted several times.
I he plot may be predictable, but it is hard to ask for anything deeper
or more complicated from a movie based on a TV show. The real enter
tainment comes from watching a seemingly tireless Steve Martin as a
slick, kiss-up ol a con artist with a hand in everything at once. This is a fa
miliar role for him (think: "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels," "My Blue 1 leaven,"
l eap of Faith "), but it's because he's so good at playing liars. With
smooth delivery, Martin gets away with one-liners like "I just want a
week's pay tor an honest day's work. I lealso manages to make Bilko a lik
able coninan by making him goofy and spastic, always wearing Martin's
signature wiseguy smile.
Martins boisterous character leaves Aykrovd and Hartman in the
dust. For a star of his stature, Aykrovd gets a surprisingly small amount
ol screen time and hardly a chance to be funny. While I lartman gets plen
ty of screentime, he sets aside his comic talent to play a bad-guv straight
man.
This short movie (it's an hour and 30 minutes) feels even shorter be
cause it keeps you laughing. "Sgt. Bilko" moves quickly and a good oldies
soundtrack keeps things upbeat. A few stereotypical scenes disappoint,
including a few featuring nerdy computer hackers and, of course, the
classic "every-movie-about-the-Army-must - have-one-of- these-hum ili -
at ing-basic-training" scenes.
All in all, the perfectly harmless "Sgt. Bilko" comes through with
laughs. This is not destined for the comedy hall of fame or an Oscar for
cinematography so save your seven dollars and rent the video.

Steve Martin is Sgt. Bilko, a freewheeling master sergeant and master schemer. Wild.
