Throughout Spike Lee's latest, "Girl 6,"
words are equated with power, whether
they're said in person, or as this film focuses
on, over the phone.
Randies Girl 6 is an out-of-work actress.
Told hy the super-slimy director Quentin
larantino (playing himself, no doubt) to take
off her blouse, she refuses and has to fend for
herself in the big bad world. The rent's coming

up and with nowhere left to turn, Handle be
comes (iirl ft, the latest in a long line of women
fulfilling fantastic and often ridiculous fan
tasies. (iirl ft and I >ebi Mazar do a duet for one
man with a twins fetish, a principal role play
er who refers to his "kielbasa" repeatedly.
I ee's direction is most convincing when he
stays light to this area. 1 'he.se women, who are
disconnected and disembodied except
through the phone, manipulate themselves to
appease these pathetic men who buy into
what they are selling: a fantasy.
"Girl ft" is happening when it stays here,

hut wandering outside the office parameters
into tangents drives the film down a worn
path. Randies fixation on a little girl who falls
down an elevator shaft is highly distracting
and contrived, to the point where if this is a
metaphor it is too in-your-face to really ad
vance the story.
Another sub-plot has her e.\-hushand( Isiah
Washington) hanging around trying to get
hack with her, turned on by her new-found tal
cut for phone sex. ( an you say slea/e? That's
what starts to ooze out of this film after Kandle,
as her favorite character, "lovely" brown,

overdoses on her calls and starts getting
hooked. (falling up Madonna as a madame of
an at-home phone sex service, Handle starts to
go downhill, and so does the film.
(■ranted, lee's send-ups of foxy brown
and " I he leffersons" are amusing and pro
vide some much needed comic relief. The
mixing and matching ol video and film to
bring fantasy and reality together is an inven
tive but ill fated maneuver that makes the ride
much rougher than it should be. It'd be better
to call 911 and save "(iirl
