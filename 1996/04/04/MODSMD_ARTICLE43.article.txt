# Diabolique
## 
### 
"Diabolique," the remake of the much
hetter Irench film of the same name, should
be renamed "I'athetique."
The film is a transparent attempt to create
substance out of what passes for style nowadays.
It tails to highlight anything but Isabellc Adjani s
inability to rise up from her doe-in-the head
lights roles often years past. Set in a boy's school,
the film's headliner is a stunning Sharon Stone,
who plays a schoolteacher with .1 His edge. A

knockout, she continually turns the heads of her
young pupils and of Cilia// Palminteri's (iuy,
who is married to Adjani's Mia.
Mia, .1 former nun, has been suffering
under the weight of her mentally abusive and
domineering husband. I lis masochistic mind
games and humiliating public taunts drive
her to find comfort in the arms of his mis
tress, coincidentally the only available
woman on the staff, Stone s Nicole. I hey
conspire to be rid of him for good and then
when the deed is done things start to unravel.
Mis body disappears and Mia suspects her
husband to be haunting her from the grave.

I liter Kathv Bates as ,i tough-as-nails and
out-of-work detective trying u> quit smoking
and needing a hobby. She gets it as Mia re
cruits her to solve the mystery of her hus
band's disappearance.
Using a worn storyline that leaves little to
the imagination, suspense is suspended by
the overacting of the other players and the
drawn out action that leaves the viewer want
ing more from Stone, whose ruthlessness and
coolness under pressure keep a tight rein 011
an otherwise wayward film. She is a refresh
ing counterpart to Adjani, whose expert l'm
a-victim look wears thin after the first few

reds of this lllm, or any other. Palminteri's ar
rogance and macho demeanor are enough to
justify any violence perpetuated against him,
and his fate is one we all cheer for. It comes
much too late, however, as our attention
wanes in and out. In when Stone is on the
screen, out when she's off.
Hoping to recreate film noir, "1) ia -
bolii|ue," like many other so-called suspense
thrillers of the 90s, fails to create anything
hut a white-washed over the-top rendition
th.it wouldn't even cut it as a farce. Skip this
and rent the original.
