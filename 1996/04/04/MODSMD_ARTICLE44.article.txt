## Two Much 
### 
It's got Antonio Banderas! It' v
got Melanie Griffith! It's got tin
mob, mistaken identity and I'lori
da's own senior citizens!
What " Two Much" doesn't have
is anything that makes it even re
motely worth watching.
The movie s so called plot ceil
lers around Banderas swindler Arl
Dodge (Ciet it? As in"the Artlu
Dodger?"). Art gets "tricked int(
marrying heiress Hetty Kerner (the
obnoxiously perky Melanie (iiil
hth), which prett\ much mean?
that she took their one night staiu
a little more seriously than he did
Unfortunately, poor Art discover?
too late that he really wants to hi
with Betty's oh so deep artist sis
ter, I i/ ( Darryl I lannah). 1)1
course, being a gentleman, An
can't bear to break Beth 's heart, si
what does he do? (You'll never
guess.) lie pretends to be twins!
Better still, he names Ins "twin"
Bart! (What .1 si retch!) Then we get
introduced to Belts s mobster e\
husband, Ciene Pal let to (Danny
Aiello), who, ol course, wants to

kill Art. All this is supposed to
make for two hours ol hijinks and
hilarity.
It doesn't.
In fact, the film is so completely
inane that it literally tells you when
to feel, how to feel and what to leel
about every supposed tw Ist or turn
ii takes. When Antonio performs
the requisite "running back and
forth between the-two women
while pretending to be both
twins" scene, we get lunkv "come
dy" music that tells us to laugh.
The music makes us laugh; the
scene d<>esn I.
And w h\ should we laugh? After
all, this is the mo\ le that propelled
Melanie and Antonio into the per
petualb ( publicly) lip locked slate
thc\ rein now! Plus, we aren't even
watching interplay between an
noving people, we're watching in
tcrpla\ between annovmg two ill
mensional character cliches!
And ol course, "Two Much has
the obligatory car chase, during
which Art's eccentric dad (you had
to know he'd have an eccentric
dad) drives oil a bridge and ex
claims, "Don't worry, I've seen this
done thousands ol times!"
You can say that again, gramps.
