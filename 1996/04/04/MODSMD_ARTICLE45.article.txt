## The
						Raw and the Cooked in Woodside 
### Ari Biernoff 
After a day hiking
around the red
woods off Highway
84 with my Anthro
pology Department
flyboy, I was ready
to return to the
Great Indoors.
Dangerously close
encounters with
deer, salamanders
and banana slugs
prompted my glam
companion to tell

harrowing stories of wild dogs and killer
turkeys — so it was time to get away from the
wildlife and back to the sustaining grip of food
in nearby Woodside. The Woodside Caft; in
downtown Woodside has made its reputation
on tasty baked goods and a cheery storefront.
Recently it has remodeled under new owner
ship, and now serves lunch and dinner seven
days a week. Its owners also run the Portola
Park Restaurant, which serves a similar menu
in fancier surroundings.
Our appetites flaring, we slid into the cafe.
The restaurant has not only expanded, but also
done a little image retooling: the first room is
still very much cafe-style, with pastry counters
and round tables. Walk through a trio of low
arches, though, and you find yourself in the
second room, where about six tables stand in

two clusters away from the open grill and pizza
oven. It's an unwitting parody of today's Cali
fornia Italian grill — overpainted pale yellow
walls, faux-marble tabletops and a giant Bac
chus-like theatrical mask on the wall, every
thing in the supposedly Florentine colors of
"Martha Stewart Living." Since the dining
room resembled every other restaurant found
in some districts of Palo Alto, we subsisted on
gossip until the menus arrived. Fortunately, no
deer or turkey anywhere to be seen.
The stuffed eggplant ($6.00), pricy for a
starter, was the standout of the meal. Three
spokes of tender eggplant came wrapped
around a velvety filling of spiced ricotta,
mushrooms and thyme, flattered by a roast
ed red pepper and tomato coulis. We clam
ored for extra bread to mop up the satisfy
ingly smoky red pepper sauce, and only
wished that an accompanying hub of spinach
hadn't been served cold. Butternut squash
soup ($4.50), a latte mug full of soft curry
colored pur£e, also scores big on flavor. Al
though the soup relied too strongly on ginger
for flavor, it smartly dodged excessive sweet
ness. These two dishes were easily the
strongest efforts we tasted from the Wood
side Cafe's kitchen. Two disappointing en
trees followed this early success.
The Farfelle "Elena" ($9.75) was a uniform
disaster. The bowtie pastas tossed with feta, pe
tite green beans, fresh tomato and Kalamata
olives sounded refreshing and light, but from
the first bite were oily, salty and impossibly bit

ter. When I later asked our waiter about the bit
terness, she replied that the Kalamata olives
were responsible. Don't believe it: I've eaten
Kalamata olives at dozens of restaurants and
delis in four countries and never tasted such
metallic sharpness. The green beans and toma
toes, which could have provided some relief
from the flecks of olive and the thick layer ofoil
coagulating below the pasta, were cooked to
oblivion.
We gratefully turned to our other entree, a
seared Sonoma duck breast with pomegranate
sauce, polenta and sugar snap peas ($13.50).
We found crisp, tender slices of duck with just
the right amount of fat puzzlingly plopped
onto a layer of dark liquid that tasted of fruit
vinegar and sugar without a hint of fresh
pomegranate. The duck shared a plate with
soft sweet peas and a mound of honest corn
polenta, chewy and well-endowed with fresh
corn kernels. We had several bites of uncooked
corn meal, though, which didn't ease our sus
picions of sloppy kitchen management. Al
though well cooked and nicely garnished with
parsley confetti, the duck came undone as a
dish without the aid of a fresher, less syrupy
sauce and stronger side dish. At prices half that
charged by the Woodside Cafe, these imperfec
tions could be passed off as charming foibles or
gee-whiz haphazardry. But a $10-15 entree de
mands more than incidental attention to food.
Muted flavors are one thing, careless prepara
tion another. As talk shifted from wild animals
to wild people, we hoped the meal would find

some reunification in dessert.
The dessert menu only listed five items, a
surprise since half the Woodside operation is a
bakery; when we asked about pastry selections,
we were led to the spookily-dark pastry cases,
which we had to lean over other patrons to see.
We chose Woodside's tiramisu ($4.50), a stack
of shockingly dry lady fingers graced with only
the vaguest thought of rum and coffee, and
smothered in very fresh layers of mascarpone
cheese. Echoing the rims of parsley decorating
the savory dishes, cocoa shavings flecked the
rim of the dessert plate — a nice touch com
ing too late.
Our appetizers were skillful, one entree was
tastily competent while the other came out
nearly inedible, and the dessert arrived satisfy
ing but botched: this scorecard makes the
Woodside Cafe an unreasonable excursion
considering the distance and substantial price.
If heading out to I hiddart Park or 1 ialf Moon
Bay, stop at the Woodside for cookies and
biscotti. Unless you're just dying to start spend
ing that trust money, hike elsewhere for a full
meal.
