## Tether me to Tetris Elizabeth Morse 
### 
I never thought it would happen to me,
but sometimes an addiction creeps upon
you. I had observed it in friends and
loved ones, in other students and particular
ly in dropouts, from Harvard l aw types to
the blue-haired cyber punk wannabe who
sometimes lives next to me in New York dur
ing the summers.
I swore to myself, never. I watched my
freshman procrastination buddy, Brian, as
he became more and more absorbed and
eventually failed even to leave his room, ever.
I had rny own means of procrastination:
"Hey Brian ... I have two exams tomorrow
and a 10-page paper that was due yesterday,
but I got it extended. My third aunt twice re
moved died again. I have to stay awake and
do some work ... I think it's time lor a s.itc
way run to get an industrial-sized tub ol
C appio. Wanna come?'
And there it was, the intruder, the \ illain
that breaks up marriages and causes in
escapable Is in chemistry. Brian was
hooked. So was his roommate. So was most
ol m\ freshman dorm.
'letris.

I was never particularly good at comput
er games. My parents refused to buy me a
Nintendo, so I wound up reading a lot. I was
a seriously deprived child.
I he scars are permanent. When I baby
sit, I year-olds kick my butt at Mortal Kom
bat. During ( hristmas break when it was
snowing and we were stir crazy, my best
friend (whom I am extremely competitive
with) and I went to an arcade where a brat
one third my height killed me .it Rage (an
inane game where stupid dinosaurs pummel
each other idiotically . . . no, I'm not bitter)
in three seconds Hat. I was embarrassed.
So I thought I was sate in I urope — they
don't even really have email here yet. But
then I noticed everyone in the cluster at
school whispering conspiratorially. It was
only two weeks into the quarter, so the\
couldn't possibly have been doing work; be
sides, no one realh works on study abroad
programs anyway. I stink m\ head in,onl\ to
discover the terrible truth. On all three ar
chak Mac Si's, which are too old to run any
thing else, mv friends were sitting like zom
hies, hushing anvone who tried to approach

them.
My old enemy. Tetris.
I tried to fight it; 1 really did. first, I hid it
on .ill the computers — I changed its name
and icon and put it in out-of-the-way tiles.
Bui I didn't want to erase the high scores and
have people after me with machete knives.
I hev found it in less than 24 hours. Then, I
bought a disk and kidnapped it, asking for
money for its return.
This is where I made my fatal mistake.
Somebody else had it at home, so it was back
at school within .1 few hours. However, I now
had it 111 my possession, and my powerbook
waslumgrv. I figured, why not. 111 can't force
them to stop, I might as well make my way to
the top of their high scores lists.
What I didn't account for is that you don't
plav Tetris casually. You train. Tetris is easy
enough that after you lose, you always feel
that you can do better next time. And next
time is as simple as pressing the return kev
after your hist game. You begin to refuse to
let anvone else play on your cop\ o! Tetris be
cause von don't want them screw ing up your
high scores. I ife depends 011 knowing how

much progress you can make with each
game.
It's a vicious cycle. You start telling your
self that you can stop anytime .. . after just
one more line, that is. Then exams hit and
you tell yourself it's very good for stress re
lief, so vou have a moral obligation to your
self to he playing. Then exams have passed
and you are still playing Tetris. Vou are on
break and have nothing better to do (and
why not cancel the trip to (ireece) so why not
play some more Tetris? One more game
won't hurt anyone.
It's easier never to start than to quit.
Tetris is Satan. It has nine levels, jtist like
hell.
It was created by a communist Russian
during the cold-war era to cause the down
fall of western civilization (just read the dis
claimer at the beginning).
It's un-American.
Rehabilitation programs don't work.
It leads to bigger, badder addictions
(don't get me started about Doom).
Tetris is pure, unadulterated evil.
I love it.
