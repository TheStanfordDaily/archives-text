# 'Special' solution?
## Loophole in bylaws may allow ASSU to publish fee requests before deadline 
### Sarah Cameron Contributing writer 
Members of
the ASSU Elec
tions Commis
sion have dis
covered a loop
hole in ASSU
Bylaws which

may make the inclusion of special
fee requests on this spring's ballot
possible.
According to the bylaws, hand
books containing information
about the election must be made
available to students seven days
prior to the spring general election,
which will be held April 17 and 18.
But members of the Elections
Commission discovered a loophole
which specifies that only the indi
vidual names of groups requesting
special fees and the amount they
want — not the entire line-item

summaries — must be distributed
to students a week before the elec
tion.
The Elections Commission,
which because of miscalculations
had feared it would not be able to
publish the handbook in time, now
plans to take out an ad in The Daily
detailing the groups' names and
amount requested, according to
Senate Appropriations Committee
Chair Bill Shen.
Shen said "the Elections Com
mission informed us that we don't
need the entire explanation. I am
confident that the situation is re
solved."
Elections Commissioner Ryan
Medders, however, said there are
no guarantees of special-fee re
quests being placed on the spring
ballot, because elections hand
books must still be distributed in
