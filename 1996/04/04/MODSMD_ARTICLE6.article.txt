### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
The Continuing Studies Pro
gram's experiment in "distance
learning" takes a step forward
this quarter, with the broadcast
of its first televised course of
fered for credit and a grade.
The course, "Gothic Cathe
drals and Great Churches of
England, 1150-1350," begins
tonight and is taught by sociolo
gist Robert Scott. The course will
air on Channel 51 every Thurs
day at 7 p.m., with repeated
broadcasts on Sundays at 8 p.m.
"Gothic Cathedrals" is the
third Continuing Studies course
to appear on Channel 51. During
winter quarter, "The War on
Drugs: History, Policy and Alter
natives," taught by Hoover Insti

McNamara, piloted the use of
World Wide Web sites and virtual

This quarter's course will deal
with the mechanics of building
the cathedrals and churches, the
historical context behind their
construction and their "political,
economic and socio-cultural ef
fects."
According to Charles Junker

from the President's Commis

and Learning, which examines
the possibilities for expansion of
technology and media in educa

versity.
Chris Thomsen, the managing
director of the commission, said
although the broadcasting tools
have been available, they have
not been applied to high-content
materials like rigorous humani
ties courses. He added that the
use of the World Wide Web is one
of the ways the Continuing Stud
ies Program is different from
analogous broadcasts like PBS.
So far, 25 students have cho
sen to take the course for credit
and will only be charged a regis
tration fee of $30. Junkerman ex
plained that it would not be ap
propriate to charge a full fee for
an experimental program.
Continuing Studies students
are generally members of the
surrounding community or Stan
ford faculty, Junkerman said.
