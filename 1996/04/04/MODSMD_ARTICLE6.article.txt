# TV course for credit: Must-see Channel 51
## 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
The Continuing Studies Pro
gram's experiment in "distance
learning" takes a step forward
this quarter, with the broadcast
of its first televised course of
fered for credit and a grade.
The course, "Gothic Cathe
drals and Great Churches of
England, 1150-1350," begins
tonight and is taught by sociolo
gist Robert Scott. The course will
air on Channel 51 every Thurs
day at 7 p.m., with repeated
broadcasts on Sundays at 8 p.m.
"Gothic Cathedrals" is the
third Continuing Studies course
to appear on Channel 51. During
winter quarter, "The War on
Drugs: History, Policy and Alter
natives," taught by Hoover Insti
tution Research Fellow Joseph
McNamara, piloted the use of
World Wide Web sites and virtual
classroom.
This quarter's course will deal
with the mechanics of building
the cathedrals and churches, the
historical context behind their
construction and their "political,
economic and socio-cultural ef
fects."
According to Charles Junker

man, associate dean of Continu
ing Studies, the impetus for ex
ploring the new medium came
from the President's Commis
sion on Technology in Teaching
and Learning, which examines
the possibilities for expansion of
technology and media in educa
tion within and outside the Uni
versity.
Chris Thomsen, the managing
director of the commission, said
although the broadcasting tools
have been available, they have
not been applied to high-content
materials like rigorous humani
ties courses. He added that the
use of the World Wide Web is one
of the ways the Continuing Stud
ies Program is different from
analogous broadcasts like PBS.
So far, 25 students have cho
sen to take the course for credit
and will only be charged a regis
tration fee of $30. Junkerman ex
plained that it would not be ap
propriate to charge a full fee for
an experimental program.
Continuing Studies students
are generally members of the
surrounding community or Stan
ford faculty, Junkerman said.
Another class, "The Brain —
An Owner's Manual," taught by
Biology Research Associate Joel
Benington, is currently being
taped for a future showing.
Junkerman said that featur
ing a variety of different classes
is part of the ongoing experiment
with cable television. McNama
ra's social policy course can be
complemented by a "pure hu
manities" broadcast of "Great
Cathedrals" and Benington's sci
ence lectures.
Scott said the general interest
subject of his course is a likely
reason for its broadcast. Addi
tionally, the highly visual nature
of the classes helps to enhance
the presentation, Junkerman
said.
Since Channel 51 serves local
communities, "distance learn
ing" will not take place complete
ly by remote. The students regis
tered for "Great Cathedrals" will
gather in a classroom atmos
phere twice during the quarter.
Junkerman said other schools'
experiences have demonstrated

that distance learning works
most effectively when students
meet each other.

1 thrive on feedback
from students. I
would be very inter
ested in hearing
what they think.'
— Robert Scott

That should come as a comfort
to Scott, who admits to liking "the
intimacy of the classroom." Ac
cording to Scott, the taping
process did not intrude on his
teaching. "It was striking," he
added, "I didn't notice [the cam
erasl after two minutes of the first
lecture."
"I thrive on feedback from stu
dents," Scott comments, "I would
be very interested in hearing
what they think."
Although he is currently op
timistic about the televised lec
tures, he has "no idea what I'll
think after seeing myself on
TV."
