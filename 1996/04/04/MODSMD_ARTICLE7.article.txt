# Dorm darlings: RF kids are Stanford vets

### Valerie Hung Contributing Writer 
Although 8-year-old Jeffrey Tratner, a resi
dent of Florence Moore Hall, finds that the
noise from staff meetings keeps him awake past
his bedtime, being the child of resident fellows
does have its perks.
"Maybe one thing that's nice is not having
my parents complain about cleaning," he said.
Cara Tratner's life as a 5-year-old RF child
differs only slightly from that of college stu
dents. "Normally I go to school, that's what I
do," she said. "We have a little after-school
thing, and the after-school people come and
then we go wash up."
Much of Cara's free time is spent completing
projects such as weaving pot holders and help
ing her father build a doll house, she said. Al
though currently working on the Pippi Long
stocking series of books, Cara's creative energy
is limited because "after dinner I have a little
time to play, but then bedtime."
For Naomi and Simon Shachter, life in Serra
Hall is not all fun and games; having RFs for
parents does involve its share of responsibili
ties. On top of being good like other children, 6-
year-old Naomi and 3-year-old Simon must re
member to stay in their beds during staff meet
ings and keep quiet when something is going on
in the lounge.
