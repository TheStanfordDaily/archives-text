# Dorm darlings: RF kids are Stanford vets
## 
### Valerie Hung Contributing Writer 
Although 8-year-old Jeffrey Tratner, a resi
dent of Florence Moore Hall, finds that the
noise from staff meetings keeps him awake past
his bedtime, being the child of resident fellows
does have its perks.
"Maybe one thing that's nice is not having
my parents complain about cleaning," he said.
Cara Tratner's life as a 5-year-old RF child
differs only slightly from that of college stu
dents. "Normally I go to school, that's what I
do," she said. "We have a little after-school
thing, and the after-school people come and
then we go wash up."
Much of Cara's free time is spent completing
projects such as weaving pot holders and help
ing her father build a doll house, she said. Al
though currently working on the Pippi Long
stocking series of books, Cara's creative energy
is limited because "after dinner I have a little
time to play, but then bedtime."
For Naomi and Simon Shachter, life in Serra
Hall is not all fun and games; having RFs for
parents does involve its share of responsibili
ties. On top of being good like other children, 6-
year-old Naomi and 3-year-old Simon must re
member to stay in their beds during staff meet
ings and keep quiet when something is going on
in the lounge.

Naomi and Simon Shachter play with Grandmother Willow from "Pocahontas" at Dis
neyworld during a recent vacation from their lives as "RF kids" in Serra Hall.
Naomi explained the reasoning
behind this: "They're having talk
and we don't want to interrupt
them."
Like Cara, Simon thinks being
an RF child is "fun" and would
recommend it to his friends. His
sister Naomi also enjoys living in a
dorm. "I get to play with my
friends every day," she said.
These friends include staff
members such as the resident as
sistants, other RF children,
friends from elementary school
and students in the dorm. The
Shachters have bestowed upon
some of their college friends pet
nicknames such as "Jelly Bean,"
"Yo-Yo" and "Barney."
For Jeffrey, however, the large
number of people living in Flo Mo
does not allow for such close famil
iarity.
"There are so many people in
the dorm it's hard to get to know
everyone personally," he ex
plained. "But it's nice listening to
conversations when I go up and
eat dinner."

Seventeen-year-old Michael
Leßaron and 16-year-old Athena
Leßaron had a different perspec
tive. Although neither of them has
developed close friendships with
their co-residents in Roble Hall,
Athena said she feels that she has
benefited from living in a college
environment.
"I really like living here," she
said. "I like the campus, I like
knowing some older people."
As a high school student cur
rently applying to colleges,
Michael finds that the advantages
of being an RF child are numer
ous.
"I can't think of any disadvan
tages," he said. "Part of the ad
vantage would be to get a look at
college life so it won't be such a
shock when I go to college next
year. All the facilities are a great
advantage — the computers, the
libraries."
Michael has discovered, howev
er, that while his "courtesy" II)
card allows him to experience the
joys of dorm food, he cannot check
out books from the library.
Michael does attend lectures and
dorm discussions sometimes, but
never any campus parties — much
to the disappointment of his high

school friends. These friends love
visiting the RF apartment,
Michael said.
"They think it's amazing to
open the door and see this hallway
full of college students," he said.
"They're in high school, and to
them, it's like, 'Oh wow, college
students.' "

'Part of the advan

Having friends over can lead to
complications, however. "Some
times policemen or security
guards will get suspicious |when|
they see us in the lounge," Michael
said. "They were talking to mv
friends [once], when 1 came in. So
1 had to explain to them that I was
the RFs' kid, that we were just
usinir the area."

Although the Leßarons have
lived in Roble only since August
1994, living in a dorm has already
changed Michael personally, he
said.
"Being around all these people
made me a bit more sociable," he
explained. "I was an incredibly shy
person, incredibly uncomfortable
in the presence of large crowds. I
remember when we first visited, I
couldn't imagine living here."
Michael has adapted, however,
and he now feels comfortable
around Stanford students.
"Haven't met anyone too scary
yet," he joked.
Neither Michael nor Athena
plans to attend Stanford after
graduating from high school.
They love Stanford, but they
would like a change of scenery.
"I kind of just wiint to getaway
from home," Athena said.
In contrast, Naomi Shachter
not only wants to go to Stanford
for college, she also knows which
dorm she wants to live in. "Serra!"
she shouted, as her 6-year-old eyes
scanned the Serra RF apartment.
For now, Naomi knows Stan
ford students as baby-sitters. But
maybe one day she'll know them
as classmates.
