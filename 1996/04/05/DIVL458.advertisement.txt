Hey, it's that thoughtful guy.
Wonder what's on his mind?
There's a lot going on at Northwestern this summer. Its right on Lake
Michigan. I he campus has beaches, hike trails, and jogging paths.
Northwestern has music groups, theatrical performances, arts and crafts
workshops... That wine-tasting minicourse sounded fun. Intramural
sports... Volleyball and basketball tournaments... Outdoor movies...
Plus, Northwestern Summer Session organizes great off-campus trips.
They even plan an overnight canoe trip ii
in Wisconsin.
Maybe I II take a few courses
this summer; earn a little extra
credit. Northwestern has
smaller classes during the
summer, and they even have
intensive course sequences in
physics, chemistry, and nine
languages. With Northwestern
intensives, I could earn a full
year of college credit in
eight weeks.

Summer in the Windy City sounds
like a hot time. Chicago has jaz
zfests, bluesfests, and gospelfests,
Cubs and Sox games, some of the
best museums and art galleries in
the world, and ethnic festivals all
summer 10ng... I d have plenty to
do, and its all just minutes from
the Northwestern campus.
Northwestern has
great summer study
abroad programs:
three or six weeks in
Prague, Czech
Republic, six or eight
weeks in Alexandria,
Egypt, or six weeks in
South Africa. All
three give me the
chance to earn college
credit this summer.
Great ideas for this summer...
