# Workers' union fights Stanford

### Dana Hangai Contributing writer 
Angered with low wages, mem
bers of Local 1877 of the Service
Employees International Union
representing Bay Area janitors met
Wednesday with employers to begin
wage negotiations.
In order to write a new contract,
a bargaining committee of elected
union members, which represents
the University's janitors among
others, sat down with 12 represen
tatives of 25 janitorial employers at
Sacred I leart Church in San Jose.
According to Facilities Engineer
Chonna Delaney, the University
contracts out for janitorial services
and has no involvement in the hir
ing process. American Business
Maintenance currently holds the
contract for the majority of Univer
sity custodial services. The contract
began last September.
Local 1877 currently represents
three-quarters of the Bay Area jani
torial work force. A majority of its
5,000 members live in poverty, ac
cording to Local 1877 data. Ameri
can Business Maintenance current
ly has 70 unionized janitors clean
ing University academic buildings,
said Site Manager Kent Edwards.
Negotiators are asking for full
health insurance coverage, higher
wages, improved training methods,
a single contract for all Bay Area
janitors and workload limits in
order to increase safety in the work
place.
Union organizer Rosa Escamil
la, who is in charge of members
working at Stanford, criticized the
University's cost-cutting tech
niques.
"Several years ago," Escamilla
said, "they reduced personnel at
that time and a lot of people got big
ger areas to clean. Quite a few peo
ple left because of the workload,
and some people became injured.
Even if they give you a lot of safety
tips, if you're being pressured to do
a lot of work, you 're not going to fol
low it, because you're pushing
yourself."
Union representative Danielle
Mahones said many industrial in
juries have occurred because of in
creased workloads by employers.

She estimated that many janitors
clean -10,000 to 60,000 square feet
of office space in one shift, equiva
lent to eight to 10 one-family
homes.
While wage increases have not
been determined, Escamilla said
the negotiators would request at
least $7.42 an hour, a 50-cent pay
raise over current Santa Clara
County contract rates.
"A large part of this campaign,"
union Communications Officer
Teresa Marshall said, "is drawing
the contrast between the economic
circumstances of the janitors, many
of whom live in East Palo Alto, and
their economics and living condi
tions and comparing it with the
CEOs and the locations in which
they live.
"For a fraction of a penny for a
square rental foot," Marshall con
tinued, "these client companies can
certainly afford the minuscule dol
lars it would cost to bring our clients
above the poverty level and provide
full family benefits."
Immigrant worker rights is an
important issue for Local 1877, as
40 percent to 50 percent of its mem
bers are immigrants. One of the
union's goals is to discourage em
ployers from harassing workers for
documents when their immigration
status has already been verified.
Marshall felt confident about (he
outcome "because we are in the
strongest position that we've ever
been in going in negotiating for our
members." I n (he past, she said, (he
employers told them that there was
too much non-union competition
but because of Local 1877's in
creased representation, they now
possess a stronger foundation.
In May, the Local 1877 is plan
ningto lead a march from East Palo
Alto through Stanford to "get a
camera's view of poverty by going
over to the rich part of town to show
a contrast of the two areas," Es
camilla said.
While a strike is not currently
planned, Escamilla did not rule out
the possibility.
"Right now," Escamilla said,
"that hasn't been discussed but I
know it's something that, depend
ing on how negotiations turn out,
you never know."
