Hit and run reported
On Monday at about 9 p.m., a dark blue
sedan collided with a biker at the corner of
Quarry and Welch Roads, then fled at high
speed, Stanford Police said.
"I was coming up Quarry Road away from
the Stanford Shopping Center, and I was
making a left-hand turn, and I had a green
light on that turn, and the car was coming
through the Welch Road intersection," said
senior Nolan Alexander, the victim.
"1 ended up face down in the intersection
with the bike on top of me," he said. "The car
continued to go straight into the psychiatry
building parking lot, paused for a moment,
apparently to see if I was still conscious, and
turned out of the parking lot and sped away."
Alexander said witnesses said thecarcould
have been a Chevrolet Corsica.
Alexander suffered minor scratches and
bruises, and the bicycle was totaled. The
value of the bike was about $75, Alexander
said. He was not wearing a bike helmet at the
time.
"I could have been seriously injured," he
said. "I could have hit my head and been

knocked unconscious. Considering the time
of night, another car could have continued
and run me over."
Naked jogger reported
A white male adult was observed jogging
down a hill wearing only sneakers on March
23 at 9:45 a.m. near Old Page Mill Road, Stan
ford Police said.
A female student who was jogging on a
neighboring hill reported the incident to the
Stanford Police. The man was described as a
balding white male between 30 and 35 with a
medium build.
"The young lady observed a (male) com
pletely naked 20 yards away from her heading
towards the Old Page Mill Road. He made no
eye contact," said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. "He was just jogging naked
and did not appear to be chasing her or any
thing like that.
"It's not really illegal," he said. "There has to
be some way that the person offends or annoys
another. In other cases we've had, the jogger
will be just wearing shorts and run up behind
another jogger and pull up his shorts and expose

his private area, and that is illegal."
Such events may become more common
with the coming of spring.
"With more and more good weather, we
will find more and more of these cases,"
Niemeyer said.
Skateboards confiscated
Four juveniles were cited and released
for skateboarding in a restricted area on the
evening of March 27. Daredevil skateboard
ing has been a continual problem on cam
pus, said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
"We've been just deluged and inundated
with these skateboarders," he said. "It's dan
gerous to the environment and themselves.
We've tried lots of things like warnings, but
now we have had to resort to selective en
forcement."
The juveniles had their skateboards held
as evidence. According to Niemeyer, it is a
crime to skateboard anywhere in the Quad
for recreational purposes, although "you can
skateboard to and from class."
