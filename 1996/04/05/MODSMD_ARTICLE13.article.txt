Officials investigate crash
DUBROVNIK, Croatia <AP> — Inves
tigators turned yesterday to unraveling
the final minutes of Commerce Secre
tary Ron Brown's flight and the reason it
crashed near this Dalmatian port, killing
all 35 people aboard.
Defense Secretary William Perry said
initial speculation focused on faulty
instrumentation. But many questions
remained a day after the jet clipped a
barren hill in a raging rainstorm and
crashed about two miles short of
Dubrovnik's Cilipi Airport.
Why was the plane off course? Why
did rescue efforts erroneously focus at
first on the waters of the Adriatic Sea?
Could Croatian, NATO and U.S. res
cuers have reached the site any faster?
Even the number of victims was
uncertain until more than 2-1 hours after
the crash. Initial reports from Washing
ton said 33 people were on board, but the
State Department listed 35 victims yes
terday — all Americans except for one
Bosnian and a Croat.

"In travel in this part of the world,
and in these conditions, you don't always
get a good ipas-enger) manifest," the
I S Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Gal
braith, told a news conference.

I'.N investigators yesterday stacked
up row of blindfold.-* on a muddy hillside,
powerful evidence that beneath them lay
the victims of an ethnic massacre.
The do/ens of blindfolds, strips of
cloth mostly in dark colors, support sur
vivor-' accounts that up to 7,000 men
were slaughtered by the Bosnian Serbs
who overran the Muslim enclave of Sre
brenica last summer.
In Bosnia's first spring thaw in peace
after four years of war, investigators are
spreading out in pursuit of human
remains and other physical evidence to
back up such accounts. What they find
will be used by the war crimes tribunal
in the Netherlands to prosecute those
responsible.
