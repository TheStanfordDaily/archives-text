# Pipe bomb found in prof's cabin
## Kaczynski suspected as Unabomber; charged and held without bail 
### 
HELENA, Mont. (AP) â€” Investiga
tors found a partially assembled pipe
bomb, chemicals and meticulous notes on
making explosives in the mountain cabin
of the former UC-Berkeley math profes
sor suspected of being the Unabomber,
federal officials said yesterday.
Theodore John Kaczynski, 53, was
charged yesterday with possessing the
bomb components and was held without
bail. Appearing before a judge, Kaczynski,
bearded and thin, said he was mentally
competent and couldn't afford his own
lawyer.
The charge made no mention of the
Unabomber's string of bombing attacks,
which killed three people and injured 23
in 18 years. Federal officials said the
charge was designed to hold Kaczynski
while agents build a case.
The FBI again searched Kaczynski's
hand-built, 10-by- 12-foot cabin yester
day. Federal officials said the search
could last several days.
"It's going very slowly because we're
not sure if it's booby-trapped," said a fed
eral agent speaking on condition of

anonymity. "We have an explosives ord
nance team X-raying everything before
we touch it."
The cabin has no electricity or no run
ning water, which would appear to match
the Unabomber's aversion to modern
society and technology.
FBI agents had been staking out
Kaczynski's cabin near the Continental
Divide for several weeks, ever since his
own mother and brother in the Chicago
area notified authorities that they had
stumbled across some of his old writings
while cleaning out the house they were
putting up for sale and found them simi
lar to the Unabomber's anarchist mani
festos.
Kaczynski was taken into custody by
federal agents Wednesday so they could
search his cabin in the wilderness 50
miles northwest of Helena.
A key question went unanswered:
How could Kaczynski, described by
neighbors as going everywhere on foot or
on an old bicycle, have mailed bombs
from locations including San Francisco,
Oakland, Calif., Sacramento, Calif., and

Chicago? Other bombs were left in cities
around the country.
Dick Lundberg, a neighbor, said he
sometimes gave Kaczynski rides into
Helena. Plane connections were available
there.
Asked about the possibility of accom
plices, one federal agent said: "This guy is
a loner. He wouldn't work with someone
else."
FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms agents found a partially
completed pipe bomb in the loft at
Kaczynski's cabin, according to an affi
davit by FBI agent Donald .1. Sachtleben.
Ten three-ring binders were recovered
filled with "page after page of meticulous
writings and sketches which I recognize
to be diagrams of explosive devices,"
Sachtleben said. The diagrams show
cross-sections of pipe bombs and electri
cal circuitry.
In addition, agents found galvanized
metal, copper and plastic pipes, four of
them with copper plates sealing one end,
"one of the first steps in the construction
of a pipe bomb," Sachtleben said.
