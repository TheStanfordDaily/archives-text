The University should
take a stand on case
over publishing rights

THERE ARE MANY frustra
tions at the start of a new
quarter: paying bills, signing
up for classes, buying books — par
ticularly course readers. Paying as
much as $70 for what amounts to
little more than a collection of
photo copies is not uncommon. Few
things seem as illogically priced.
What makes the readers so
expensive is that the Stanford
Bookstore — or whoever is compil
ing the reader — must obtain the
rights to reproduce every article or
excerpt, a process which generally
involves royalty payments.
But a recent federal court deci
sion in Michigan might change
that. In a case brought by the
Princeton University Press against
a company called Michigan Docu
ment Services — which specializes
in course readers — the court ruled
that royalty payments are not nec
essary when the reproductions are
used for educational purposes.
Stanford, in the interest of sav
ing its students money, should
actively support this decision as
the appeals process winds its way
through the federal courts.
Though the most recent deci
sion on the case — in 1984 —
favored publishers, it seems clear
that it should riot'be necessary for
those who compile course readers
to pay royalties. The federal Copy
right Act's fair-use clause sets
forth certain contexts in which it is
acceptable to make copies without
obtaining permission. "Teaching
(including multiple copies for class
room use), scholarship or
research" are among the accept
able circumstances.
Michael Roster, Stanford's gen
eral counsel, has expressed reser
vations about this most recent
decision, arguing that university

presses depend upon royalties to
stay in business.
But the convenience of publish
ers is not a valid reason for main
taining a detrimental and flawed
interpretation of the law. The Uni
versity should acknowledge that
and, if necessary, find other ways
to keep Stanford University Press
solvent.
Furthermore, it should also
acknowledge that its student body
is a far more integral part of the
Stanford community than Stan
ford University Fi iss, and work to
advance the interests of that com
munity. Students, who are now
paying nearly $30,000 annually in
tuition, room and board, can use
every monetary break they can get.
Hani Sayegh, the course materials
manager for the Bookstore, told
The Daily this ruling could mean a
50 percent reduction in the price of
the average course reader. If that is
the case, the ruling could result in
significant savings for students.
However, it would also have a
detrimental impact on another,
equally important, component of
the Stanford community— the fac
ulty. Faculty members who author
the excerpted books and articles
receive a portion of the royalties
paid by those who produce course
readers. But the amount received
by authors is negligible, and many
argue their goal in publishing is to
have their work read by as many
people as possible, not solely to
make money. Thus, the ruling
would most likely not significantly
hurt faculty members. In fact, they
would benefit ffom maßfrift the
process to create readers easier,
since Sayegh said it often takes up
to a month to obtain permission to
reproduce a certain work.
The Association of American
Publishers is currently in the pro
cess of appealing the ruling. The
University should support Michi
gan Document Services as it Fights
this battle, and should consider fil
ing its own friend-of-the-court brief
individually or in collaboration with
other universities interested in eas
ing the burden on their students.
