## Civilization is ending 
### 
CIVILIZATION IN THE United
States is unraveling. I know. I've
seen the signs as clearly as if they
were posted on the side of the freeway;
politeness and common courtesy are dis
appearing. You know the saying, com
mon sense isn't so common? Neither is
common courtesy, anymore.
If you come from somewhere in the
northeastern United States, this will not
come as a surprise. After all, New York
ers are renowned for their rudeness. In
New York, it's fairly common to see peo
ple walking down the street two or three
abreast, without considering the people
walking in the other direction who, inci
dentally, may want to use the sidewalk
also- Wben they inevitably walk into you,
despite your best efforts to avoid them,
rarely, if ever, does anyone say "Excuse
me." I don't think I ever heard one that
was not my own.
People step on your feet on the sub
way, stick their elbow in your head on the
bus and steal your taxi in the street with
out even feeling a bit of remorse. I believe
rudeness in New York is a reaction to the
invasion of one's personal space, which,
with so many people in such little space,
is inevitable. But other societies have
evolved politeness in response to close liv
ing quarters, so rudeness isn't the only
response.
However, I've noticed that New York
doesn't have a monopoly on rudeness.
Perhaps too many inmates have escaped

the asylum, and New Yorkers are spread
ing their particular brand of sociability
with the rest of the country and the
world.
But there really aren't enough New
Yorkers leaving the city to be blamed for
everything, so I have to figure civilization
is unraveling. I have seen people picking
their nose, yawning or sneezing without
covering their mouths, belching without
saying excuse me, asking for things with
out saying "please," receiving things
without saying "thank you." And then
there are the people who leave the bath
room without washing their hands. You
know who you are.
And let's talk about common cour
tesy. Common starts with the space you
share at home with your roommate or
family and goes out from there. What
reason could there be to leave your
mess in the kitchen or bathroom or
hallways, to throw trash on the ground
outside, to discard your empty fast food
containers on the highway, to leave
your waste in the aisle at the movie
theater, waiting for someone else to
clean up after you? If you feel no obli
gation to clean your own room, that's
fine, but there is a certain responsibili
ty incurred in the community of com
mon living, and no one should have to
clean up after another responsible
human being.
Northern California appears to have
at least one edge on politeness New York

doesn't have — drivers here are much
more courteous than New York drivers
have probably ever been. Perhaps it's the
spaciousness out here, or the general
laid-back attitude that prevails. I have a
friend who describes a New York City
minute as the time it takes for someone
to beep their horn at you after the traffic
light has turned green. Believe me, it
doesn't even take seconds. I have hardly
ever heard anyone even use their horn
here.
But the best example of civilization in
driving is how people here react to inop
erable traffic lights. In New York and
many other cities on the East Coast,
when a traffic light is out, each direction
must fend for itself. The heaviest flow of
traffic takes over, and the cross traffic
must inch forward slowly in an attempt
to break into the never-ending stream.
This usually results in gridlock, and
requires eventual police intervention.
Here, I was shocked to see that people
treated the non-working traffic light as a
stop sign, and traffic was orderly, if a bit
slow.
I'll know the end of civilization is near
ing when Californians start driving like
New Yorkers.
