# Fac Sen drops students from board
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
In a blow to student
involvement in Universi
ty policy-making, the
Faculty Senate voted 17-
16 yesterday, with Sen
ate Chair Gail Mahood
casting the deciding vote,
to cut the representation
of students from the new
Planning and Policy

Board.
In the original charge, the section on
membership read, "The board shall consist
of nine members of the Academic Council
and two students."
But due to concerns about openness of
discussion in board meetings originally
raised by Assoc. Education Prof. Patricia
Gumport, the board decided to remove the
phrase, "and two students."
"The value of this committee is that it is
a place where faculty can speak thoughtful
ly about alternative visions for the Univer
sity," Gumport said. "Consulting students
is fine, but we should keep the constituency
as a committee of faculty."

English Prof. John Bender agreed,
"Meetings are concerned with not just con
fidential information, but information of an
extremely sensitive nature."
The first Planning and Policy Board was
formed three years ago as a committee to
undertake strategic planning. After the
board's report came out in January, t he sen
ate decided to charter another board for the
next three years as well.
The report, titled "Planning in an Era of
Change," has been regarded as a blueprint
of the University's direction over the next
few years.
Food Research Prof. Walter Falcon, who
directs the Institute for International Stud
ies and was a member of the first board, re
minded the senate of a University document
that states that students are to be repre
sented on University committees unless
t here are "clear and compelling reasons why
they should not be."
The two student ex officio members of
the senate, Council of Presidents member
Rich Stolz and ASSU Senate Chair Alane
Murdock, were present at the meeting.
Stolz said that given the board's goal of

examining the long-term relation
ship between faculty and the Uni
versity, including students would
he an important expression of
Stanford's commitment to student
representation. The other student
member of the senate, senior
Liane Nomura, was not present.
"I understand there are issues
that students don't need to know
or don't concern them," Stolz said.
"But students are important to
have on the committees because
they add a different perspective to

policy-making."
Stolz pointed out that students
already serveon committees which
deal with sensitive issues, includ
ing the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education, faculty search
committees and the Board of
Trustees.
Philosophy Prof. John Perry
said he supported having students
on the committee. "My experience
is that students have worked well
on committees," Perry said. "I
think when you get bright,
thoughtful students, they are an
asset."
However, Gumport said the
"precious tasks with which the
board has been charged demand a

place to hold both controversial
and effective conversation."
The senate had to take two
votes. The first, which Murdock
said was miscounted, was 15-14 in
favor of striking the phrase, "and
two students."
In the second vote, some of (he
faculty who abstained in the origi
nal count voted, and the amend
ment prevailed.
To ensure that the board con
sults with students on issues con
cerning them, the senate added a
fifth specific duty to the charge
which reads, "the Planning and
Policy Board shall consult with
students and student organiza
tions as it deems appropriate."
