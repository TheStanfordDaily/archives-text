Medical plans are not optimal for University

THE APRIL 2 edition of the Daily
had an article headlined "Experts
rate health plans." The study and,
for that matter, the article ignores the
obvious question, "Is squeezing the
insurers on cost in the best interest of
Stanford employees?" I think not.
The result of this squeeze has been
tighter control with fewer options. Two
of the three options in the Triple Option
plan are too expensive to be practical for
most people for all but the most simple
medical procedures. This leaves the
employee limited to their primary care
physician and that physician's medical
institution.
More importantly, this cost squeeze

has caused the University to split mental
health care from physical health care.
This is counter to the generally accepted
view that treating the whole person
results in the highest quality of life for
the individual.
A primary care physician cannot
refer a person to a mental health pro
fessional under the present scheme.
The individual must contact a person at
Value Behavioral Health on an 800
number for a preliminary diagnosis.
The person at VBH does not have
access to the individual's medical histo
ry. Based on this interview, the individ
ual is referred to a local agency where
another phone interview takes place,

again without reference the previous
interview or to medical history. Then a
mental health professional contacts the
individual for an appointment. There is
no connection between physical and
mental health providers; in fact, the
insurance system erects barriers to
coordinating physical and mental
health treatment.
I know a woman who felt she needed
to see a mental health professional but
found the prospect of discussing her per
sonal issues with an anonymous person
on an 800 line too daunting to start the
process. This is a way to control costs
with the logical extension being not pro
viding insurance at all, the lowest cost

solution to the University and the lowest
cost insurance to the employee.
Employees are making rational choic
es when they choose the lowest cost
insurance option because they do not see
significant differences in the overall lev
els of coverage. "This [process] will cause
companies to lower their prices to com
pete." This process also causes compa
nies to lower their costs by limiting
access to health care either directly or
indirectly. This is not in the best interest
of Stanford employees or, in the long
run, the University.
