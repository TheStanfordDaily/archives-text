# Allison Amend: The better part of valor
## Sneezing and sniffling my way down El Camino 
### 
WELL, HERE IT is, spring again
and I greet each morning with
swollen, itchy eyes and a red,
runny nose, to which most of my
acquaintances magnanimously respond
with a "Wow, you look tan!"
Yes, I'm allergic to spring, ill with the
scent of lilac bushes, the clouds of gold
enrod dust that float and settle, like the
flowing skirt of a Victorian beauty on tin l
grass. Longer days mean not additional
daylight baseball time, but more sun
shine to spur the plants' growth. No rain
means no relief, even temporary, from
their oppressive pollen.
Since I've quit smoking, I pour that
extra money into the Kleenex fund, lit
tering my room with used cotton like
empty bottles in a bar. You'll excuse my
vacant stare, won't you, when I explain
it's due to medication, not disinterest in
your narrative?
So I take a trip to Cowell (you knew
this was coming, didn't you?). Cowell, for
all its faults, is a vast improvement over
my pediatrician's office (yes, I still see
the pediatrician when I go home. I like

his bedside manner: "OK, now I'm going
to feel your tummy. Watch Barney over
my left shoulder"). At least here I don't
feel like typhoid Mary bringing strep
throat to little babies in the waiting
room. And The New Yorker is infinitely
more interesting than Highlights for
Children, although the illustrations are
better in Highlights.
I'm seen right away by Stanford Uni
versity standards (which means that the
health problem I am experiencing has
not taken care of itself in the days that I
spent in the waiting room), and am
asked if I wear contact lenses. Yes, I
reply, and am told to remove them.
I'he nurse asks me to step to the back
of t lie room and cover my left eye. "Can
you read the letters on the optical
chart?"
Of course I can't. I wear contacts. She
writes this down, nodding.
The diagnosis is, of course, that I am
pregnant. They send me away with two
Sudafed and a condom.
I believe this violent reaction to my
surroundings is but symptomatic of a

larger malaise, a dissatisfaction with my
location. For where are we, here at Stan
ford University? We're not urbanites,
since I often say I'm going to The City,
which sounds like a bad soap opera. (Oh
wait, "The City" is a bad soap opera.)
And we're not in the country, as the exis
tence of Jasper Ridge as a separate
nature preserve, where you must enter
only with a guide, proves our non-natu
ral status.
We're in the suburbs, there's no two
ways about it. El Camino stretches on,
promising strip mall after strip mall with
relentless similarity. I miss the deafen
ing, numbing noise of the city, the forced
contact with perfect strangers that I
never receive in my car on Foothill
Expressway or in the widened aisles of
Target.
There is possibility in the city, even in
gutter trash on abandoned street cor
ners. A dirty syringe, a hundred-dollar
bill, it's door one or door two in the game
of Life, but at least it's played in the city.
You won't find any trash near the gut
ters of Palo Alto. You won't even find

gutters.
But don't get me wrong, I love the
country too. Nature becomes as much of
a presence in a remote area as skyscrap
ers are in the city. Shadows become more
intense, a breeze is a major disturbance,
crickets seem equipped with subwoofers.
There is something intriguing about soli
tude, the danger and the promise of
knowing that no one knows where you
are, or what you're doing, your vocal
cords sighing with relief at their rest.
It's just here, in the Stanford Simu
lacrum that we seem poised between two
elements, neither one nor the other, like
a teenager in her mother's clothes. Yes,
we have the Dish, but it is cordoned off by
fences and streets. Yes, we have the Mall,
hut it is bordered by El Camino, pointing
an admonishing royal finger toward Mex
ico, the real land of nature in American
mythology. The failure of the suburbs is
that they try to be both in one.
Yet while nature is, as its nomencla
ture will inform you, natural, and while
the Rousseau's urban sprawl is natural
ly and spontaneously formed, the suburb

is a studied exercise in planned living.
Rows of identical tract houses always
make me wonder if drunken residents
pound on the wrong doors. "Oh, sorry,
my condo looks just like this one."
They also shape the way residents live.
Sidewalks are extraneous since "they"
have determined we will drive our cars
everywhere. So, too, grocery stores are
lengthy sojourns. Restaurants and stores
close at 9:00, since "they" think we
shouldn't be out later than that anyway.
Do I seem paranoid? Maybe it's the
medication after all. But I am beginning
to think 1 was misdiagnosed. It's not the
begonias and the lilies, the tulips and the
trees. I'm responding to the entire
Peninsula with sneezes, the endless
expressways and sub-developments with
tearing eyes and the relentlessly repeti
tious redundancy of the Chili's, Fresh
Choice, Chevy's, Blockbuster scries with
a rasping cough. It's not spring my body
rejects; I'm allergic to suburbia.
