## Men's tennis gears up for blockbuster weekend Second-ranked Cardinal hosts No. 1 UCLA today 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
This weekend could turn out to
be one of the most exciting of the
year at the Stanford Tennis Stadi
um when perennial powers UCLA
and USC charge into town to do
battle with the second-ranked
Cardinal.
Since the NCAA began record
ing tennis results in 1946, the Car
dinal, the Bruins and the Trojans
have captured 42 of 50 NCAA
championships, with Stanford
winning 13 titles and UCLA and
USC taking home 15 apiece
(UCLA and USC tied in 1976).
This weekend, four of the nation's
top five players, including the top
ranked collegiate player on the
ATP tour, UCLA sophomore
Justin Gimelstob, will take to the
court at Stanford along with four
former No. 1 players.
"This weekend we will see the
best amateur tennis being played
anywhere in the world," said Stan
ford head coach Dick Gould.
Beneath the talent, the history
and t he rankings lies a long-stand
ing rivalry. Stanford, UCLA and
USC have battled one another for

years, each seeking bragging
rights with passion.
"This isn't just another couple
matches for us," said Cardinal se
nior Ricky Becker. "It's definitely
a lot bigger. This is my last year to
play in front of all the fans at
home, and 1 really want to bring
home a couple of big wins.

Stanford Tennis Stadi
um is our house. No
body walks out of our
house with a victory.'
— Rickey Becker

"Stanford Tennis Stadium is
our house. Nobody walks out of
our house with a victory. No
body."
Walking into the Card's house
at 1:30 p.m. this afternoon are the
undefeated and top-ranked UCLA
Bruins, who will battle Stanford in
a rematch of the finals at the Na
tional Indoor Championships. In
that February contest, UCLA
clobbered the Cardinal 5-1 to halt
the second-longest winning streak

in modern collegiate tennis histo
ry at 37 victories. With the win,
the Bruins assumed the top spot in
the national polls.
Gimelstob has played a crucial
role in the Bruins' success with a
phenomenal run in both the colle
giate and professional ranks. His
ATP tour ranking has jumped
nearly 300 spots to No. 293, mak
ing him the highest-ranked college
player on the tour. Most recently,
Gimelstob defeated No. 60 Karol
Kucera in the first round of the
Franklin Templeton Tennis Clas
sic before losing to eventual cham
pion and No. 10 player in the
world Wayne Ferreira, 2-6, 6-4, 7-
5. The 19-year-old gave Ferreira
quite a scare — he led 5-2 in the
third.
Gimelstob, No. 3 in the colle
giate rankings, will likely face off
against Stanford captain Jeff
Salzenstein. The fifth-ranked se
nior, who was ranked No. 1 in the
preseason, lost in his last en
counter with Gimelstob 6-2, 7-5.
At the time, the Cardinal's undis
puted leader was still recovering
from a flu-related collapse he ex

perienced three days earlier.
"Jeff will have to stay focused,"
Gould said. "He's been concerned
about his health recently, and that
has hurt his focus some. I le's real
ly going to have to concentrate on
the match at hand and do some
adapting.
"He will be fine though. I have
all the confidence in the world in
Jeff. I don't care who he's play
ing."
The Bruins also feature Srdjan
Muskatirovic, a former No. 1 play
er who is currently ranked No. 28.
The star Yugoslavian defeated
Stanford freshman Ryan Wolters
in their encounter at the National
Indoor finals. Wolters, currently
ranked fourth, is another former
No. 1 player.
Gimelstob and Muskatirovic
also combine to form the top dou
bles team in the country. Stan
ford's first doubles team, sixth
ranked senior Jim Thomas and
sophomore Paul Goldstein, must

knock off the powerful Bruin duo
in what's shaping up as one of the
best matches of the day. Thomas
and Goldstein won the Pacific
Coast Doubles tournament earlier
this year and have already defeat
ed a No. 1 doubles team in Texas
Christian's Paul Robinson and
David Roditi during a Rolex-spon
sored tournament in Dallas.
Stanford is still shuffling its
line-up, but Gould does know one
thing for certain. "We are capable
of beating anyone in their line-up,
and they are capable of beating
anyone in ours," he said. "It is
going to be a heck of a dogfight out
there."
Indeed, Salzenstein, Goldstein,
Thomas, Wolters, Becker and ju
nior Grant Elliott will all bite and
scratch for the Cardinal. Thomas,
now ranked No. 53, has been play
ing No. 2 singles the last few
matches and has produced an un
blemished 14-0 record on the sea
son. The 27th-ranked Goldstein,
who dropped a tough 6-2, 4-6, 6-2
match to UCLA's Eric Taino in
their last meeting, is also riding a
hot streak. Goldstein has won his
last five matches in straight sets.

Win or lose, the Cardinal will
square off against the Trojans to
morrow at noon. Last season, Stan
ford cut short USC's two-year reign
as NCAA title holders. Stanford
and USC have won each of the last
eight NCAA championships. In the
past eight years, the winner of the
Stanford-USC battle at Stanford
Tennis Stadium has gone on to win
the national crown six times.
USC's top player, freshman
Cecil Mamiit, jumped all the way
to the top of the polls at t he start of
spring but dropped to No. 3 in the
latest rankings. Salzenstein,
Mamiit's probable opponent,
hopes for a repeat performance of
his last matchup with the Trojan
star. In their last clash, Salzen
stein easily disposed of Mamiit 6-
2, 6-4 to secure the title at the
Rolex Intercollegiate Indoor
Championships.
"This is our second-to-last
homestand," Gould said "We've
got a really great team this year,
and it would be a shame if people
miss seeing them play this week
end. These matches will be some
of the most exciting tennis you can
see anywhere."
