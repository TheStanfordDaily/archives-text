## Men's tennis gears up for blockbuster weekend Second-ranked Cardinal hosts No. 1 UCLA today 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
This weekend could turn out to
be one of the most exciting of the
year at the Stanford Tennis Stadi
um when perennial powers UCLA
and USC charge into town to do
battle with the second-ranked
Cardinal.
Since the NCAA began record
ing tennis results in 1946, the Car
dinal, the Bruins and the Trojans
have captured 42 of 50 NCAA
championships, with Stanford
winning 13 titles and UCLA and
USC taking home 15 apiece
(UCLA and USC tied in 1976).
This weekend, four of the nation's
top five players, including the top
ranked collegiate player on the
ATP tour, UCLA sophomore
Justin Gimelstob, will take to the
court at Stanford along with four
former No. 1 players.
"This weekend we will see the
best amateur tennis being played
anywhere in the world," said Stan
ford head coach Dick Gould.
Beneath the talent, the history
and t he rankings lies a long-stand
ing rivalry. Stanford, UCLA and
USC have battled one another for

years, each seeking bragging
rights with passion.
"This isn't just another couple
matches for us," said Cardinal se
nior Ricky Becker. "It's definitely
a lot bigger. This is my last year to
play in front of all the fans at
home, and 1 really want to bring
home a couple of big wins.

Stanford Tennis Stadi
um is our house. No
body walks out of our
house with a victory.'
— Rickey Becker

"Stanford Tennis Stadium is
our house. Nobody walks out of
our house with a victory. No
body."
Walking into the Card's house
at 1:30 p.m. this afternoon are the
undefeated and top-ranked UCLA
Bruins, who will battle Stanford in
a rematch of the finals at the Na
tional Indoor Championships. In
that February contest, UCLA
clobbered the Cardinal 5-1 to halt
the second-longest winning streak

in modern collegiate tennis histo
ry at 37 victories. With the win,
the Bruins assumed the top spot in
the national polls.
Gimelstob has played a crucial
role in the Bruins' success with a
phenomenal run in both the colle
giate and professional ranks. His
ATP tour ranking has jumped
nearly 300 spots to No. 293, mak
ing him the highest-ranked college
player on the tour. Most recently,
Gimelstob defeated No. 60 Karol
Kucera in the first round of the
Franklin Templeton Tennis Clas
sic before losing to eventual cham
pion and No. 10 player in the
world Wayne Ferreira, 2-6, 6-4, 7-
5. The 19-year-old gave Ferreira
quite a scare — he led 5-2 in the
third.
Gimelstob, No. 3 in the colle
giate rankings, will likely face off
against Stanford captain Jeff
Salzenstein. The fifth-ranked se
nior, who was ranked No. 1 in the
preseason, lost in his last en
counter with Gimelstob 6-2, 7-5.
At the time, the Cardinal's undis
puted leader was still recovering
from a flu-related collapse he ex

Senior Jeff Salzenstein will face off against UCLA phenom Justin Gimelstob, today at 1:30 p.m. when the
Cardinal meets the Bruins at Stanford Tennis Stadium.
