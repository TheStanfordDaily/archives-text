# Softball hits the desert
## Women visit top-ranked Arizona, No. 20 ASU 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The Stanford softball team leaves today
for its toughest road trip of the season. The
Cardinal will face No. 1 Arizona tonight at
6 p.m. and then compete against No. 20
Arizona State tomorrow at the same time.
The Wildcats are currently tied with No.
2 Washington for the top spot in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference. The Arizona women (30-
4 overall, 3-1 Pac-10) have proven especial
ly formidable of late, sweeping defending
national champion and third-ranked
UCLA on March 29 and splitting with the

Huskies on March 31.
A potential mental roadblock for Stan
ford (17-16, 3-7) is the limited success the
team has experienced on the road. The
Cardinal is only 6-10 away from home and
has yet to secure a conference win on the
road in four tries. Nevertheless, head
coach Sandy Pearce expects her team to
overcome that obstacle this weekend.
"We're looking forward to the road
trip," Pearce said. "Arizona has a wonder
ful stadium. We play at night in front of
5,000 or 6,000 fans, and it's never a prob-
lem to get up for the No. 1 team."
The Cardinal players also be
lieve they're up to the task. "I

think [the Wildcats] are beatable,''
said sophomore pitcher Jessica
Schulman. "It will be a good chal
lenge for us to play well after the
break."
Stanford has had time to reflect
upon its performance over the
break, and after three hard davs of

practice, Pearce believes her
squad is ready.
"It's been a long break," she
said. "We're really focused and
ready to play. The girls are hungry
to play well. Arizona can be beat
en. If we go in and play our game,
anything can happen."
The Wildcats may come first
for the Cardinal, but Stanford will
not overlook the Sun Devils. ASU
is right behind the Cardinal in the
Pac-10 standings, but the Sun
Devils do sport two noteworthy
achievements that Stanford has
not attained this year — a top-25
ranking and two victories over
UCLA.
"We can beat Arizona State,"
Pearce said. "It will depend on
how the players come out and
play. ASU has been playing very
well. We're really excited to play."

Dacquisto will provide a big chal
lenge for Schulman and her pitch
ing cohorts, particularly freshman
Becky Blevins. Blevins leads Stan
ford with a 1.22 ERA. She and the
rest of the Cardinal defense have
hold opponents to a .224 batting
average.
Dacquisto, however, is batting
.496, tops on a team that bats a
collective .347. Dacquisto also
leads ASU in stolen bases (24),

RBIs (30) and hits (60). In all, (lie
Sun Devils feature three hitters
hitting over .400.
The Cardinal players are very
much aware of the significance of
both of this weekend's contests.
"Arizona State — more than Ari
zona — is really big for us," Schul
man said. "Arizona is really a
game to prove ourselves against a
great team. Arizona Stati' is a
game we need to win to stay in the
running for the regional champi
onships."
With only 24 games left in the
season, the Cardinal must make
the most of every opportunity. In
deed, with five of the eight Pac-10
schools ranked in the top 25, the
14-game conference homestretch
will be anything but easy.
