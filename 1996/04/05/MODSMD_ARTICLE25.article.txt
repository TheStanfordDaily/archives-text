# Home finale for lacrosse
## Stanford hosts Cal in last home game 
### Solveig Pederson 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team challenged five East Coast
teams over spring break in
Nashville, Tenn. and managed only
one win and four losses against
some of the nation's best squads.
However, such a win-loss ratio does
not reflect the learning and
progress that occurred over the
break, as Stanford (4-9 overall, 2-6
NCAA Division I) showed Eastern
schools that West Coast lacrosse
cannot be taken lightly.
"We definitely improved in the
week," said Cardinal head coach
Kay Cowperthwait. "It's really
good for us to play the kind of com
petition that we just don't see out
here at all. We're a better team for
it."
The Cardinal notched its only
victory of the week when it defeated
Davidson 17-8 on March 29. Co
captain Wendy Kula singled out
sophomore Dara Kaplan as the
biggest offensive threat in that con
test. "She has the speed to get down
the field quick enough to get the
key passes," Kula said.
Goalie Elizabeth Franklin
recorded several saves in the win
despite playing in a new position
this season. Indeed, according to
Kula, inexperience did not prove to

be Stanford's Achilles' heel.
"With the exception of [North
Carolina], we were on the same
level of ability," Kula said. "We
would either get ahead and be too
comfortable with the lead or let
down our intensity."
The Cardinal opened its road
trip with a game against Virginia
Tech on Saturday, March 23. Stan
ford fell just short of victory in a 12-
11 loss.
"When it came down to crunch
time, we weren't coming up with
ground balls and making passes,"
Cowperthwait said. "We ran out of
time and couldn't capitalize on
things we should have."
North Carolina defeated the Car
dinal 19-4 on Sunday, March 24. Al

though, like Stanford, it is a new
varsity program, the Tar Heels are
an especially strong team with sev
eral players already on scholarship.
The Tar Heels' only loss on the sea
son came at the hands of Maryland,
the defending national champions.
Down 13-0 at halftime, Stanford
battled back during the second half
but was unable to put a dent in the
North Carolina lead.
"During the first half, we played
like UNC was a great team," Kula
said. "We were intimidated. During
the second half, we played with con
fidence."
"It was a good team for us to play
because they were so strong and we
were able to keep up with them for
the second half," Cowperthwait
said.
Against Vanderbilt on Wednes
day, March 27, the Cardinal
stormed out of the gates, forging an
early 5-1 lead. Unfortunately for

Stanford, however, the Com
modores returned a long string of
unanswered goals and amassed an
insurmountable lead. Vanderbilt
ultimately prevailed 20-13.
On the Cardinal's final day of
competition in Nashville, Duke
dealt Stanford a 10-7 loss.
The Cardinal will get a chance to
show California what it learned over
spring break when the two teams
meet tomorrow at 1 p.m. in Stan
ford's last home game of the season.
A much weaker team than any
that Stanford encountered in
Nashville, the Bears rely on the
"run-and-gun" style commonly
used in the West. Stanford hopes
the intensity it developed over
spring break will cariy over into to
morrow's contest.
"We had to play up to a different
level [in Nashville 1 and I hope that
against Cal we can maintain that
level," Cowperthwait said.
