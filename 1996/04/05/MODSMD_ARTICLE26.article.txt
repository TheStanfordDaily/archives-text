# A 						tennis fan's guide to heckling
## 
### 
u T four fans are loud and bois-
I terous during this week-
J-end's matches, then the
home court will definitely work to
our advantage."
— Jim Thomas
I plan to be a loud and boisterous
tennis fan today. I hope you are
planning likewise, but in case you
are not, here is a little something
that might change your mind.
Vocal sports fans can transform
any venue into a visiting player's
worst nightmare. But don't tell this
to tennis fans, most of whom sit
tight-lipped throughout matches,
restricting themselves to episodic
outbreaks of mild applause. Rules
that outlaw crowd noise during
points partially explain the passivi
ty of tennis fans.
I have no problem with these

rules. Tennis is not basketball; it
has always been a genteel sport, and
during points players ought not be
subjected to silly distractions.
However, only 25 percent of the
average tennis match is spent play
ing the points. I see no reason why
fans ought not involve themselves

in the match the other 75 percent of
the time. The best way to get in
volved in a match is through a prac
tice known as heckling.

Between points, an experienced
heckler — especially at the college
level — uses verbal assaults to chip
away at the typically-fragile ego of a
tennis player. Nearly four years of
heckling players who visit Stanford
Tennis Stadium has taught my
friends and me to act in the follow
ing ways — ways I hope you will
begin emulating today:
Situation: A visiting player makes
grunting noises during points.
Fan Response: Mock him. Imitate
the embarrassing sounds without
hesitating to embellish. For exam
ple, "meh" like a sheep if that were
how the grunts sound.
Situation: A visiting player conj
plains incessantly.
Fan Response: In the most anal


The Real
Deal

Joe
Bialowitz
retentive voice you can muster,
make fun of the cry-baby by shout
ing, "Wah! Wah!"
Situation: A visiting player calls a
ball out even though it was clearly
in.(In tennis vernacular, this prac
tice is known as "hooking")
Fan response: Allow no one to
cheat with impunity on your home
court. First, you would do well to
begin your tirade with a McEnroe
like "Are you kidding me?" or "You
can't be serious!" Then, if the hook
was serious enough, you should
consider utilizing the coup do gras
of trash-talk: "Oh, c'mon! I could
catch a whale with that hook!" Rise
from your seat for added effect.
Avoid using slurs against the play
er's familial relations — unless his
family is present and engaged simi
larly in heckling.
Situation: The umpire overrules
the call of a home player.
Fan Response: This scenario will

not occur if, through your heckling,
you have previously established the
home court advantage. But in the
event you have been too complacent
prior to the overrule, now is the
time to start riding the umpire with
a simple taunt, such as "Open your
eyes, ump!"
Situation: At an important stage
of the match, a visiting player dou
ble-faults or makes consecutive un
forced errors.
Fan Response: You could opt for
an indirect approach by exhorting
your player with a call of "C'mon
now, he's flustered!" tactful
but probably more effective at get
ting in the opposing player's
kitchen is the mock-Heimlich Ma
neuver: Make gurgling, coughing
sounds while placing your hands
around your neck in a "help-I'm
choking" position, then shout for
all to hear, "Are there any doctors
in the house? Anybody know the
Heimlich? What about CPR?" 1
would discourage clapping after
double-faults, unless you can offer
inebriation as your excuse.
Situation: A Stanford player has

just put away an overhead.
Fan Response: Yell "Boom!" the
moment that the yellow projectile
leaves the court.
Situation: A Stanford player
shanks his passing shot attempt,
but a measure of good fortune
transforms the shot into a success
ful lob; OR a visiting player nets an
easy overhead.
Fan Response: The lucky Stan
ford player can only view such a
point as a gift, so yell "Merry
Christmas!" or "Happy Hanukah!"
Situation: Match point for the
home player.
Fan Response: The Cardinal
coaching staff has suggested that
crowd members rise from their
seats prior to and during the point.
When the visiting player looks up
right before his ball toss, the abrupt
change of scenery will clue him in to
how many people genuinely desire
that he lose the point.

Joe regrets to inform his readers
that this will be the only appearance
of The Heal Deal in 1996.
