u T four fans are loud and bois-
I terous during this week-
J-end's matches, then the
home court will definitely work to
our advantage."
— Jim Thomas
I plan to be a loud and boisterous
tennis fan today. I hope you are
planning likewise, but in case you
are not, here is a little something
that might change your mind.
Vocal sports fans can transform
any venue into a visiting player's
worst nightmare. But don't tell this
to tennis fans, most of whom sit
tight-lipped throughout matches,
restricting themselves to episodic
outbreaks of mild applause. Rules
that outlaw crowd noise during
points partially explain the passivi
ty of tennis fans.
I have no problem with these

rules. Tennis is not basketball; it
has always been a genteel sport, and
during points players ought not be
subjected to silly distractions.
However, only 25 percent of the
average tennis match is spent play
ing the points. I see no reason why
fans ought not involve themselves

in the match the other 75 percent of
the time. The best way to get in
volved in a match is through a prac
tice known as heckling.

Between points, an experienced
heckler — especially at the college
level — uses verbal assaults to chip
away at the typically-fragile ego of a
tennis player. Nearly four years of
heckling players who visit Stanford
Tennis Stadium has taught my
friends and me to act in the follow
ing ways — ways I hope you will
begin emulating today:
Situation: A visiting player makes
grunting noises during points.
Fan Response: Mock him. Imitate
the embarrassing sounds without
hesitating to embellish. For exam
ple, "meh" like a sheep if that were
how the grunts sound.
Situation: A visiting player conj
plains incessantly.
Fan Response: In the most anal
