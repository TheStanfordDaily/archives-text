# Women's tennis goes Hollywood
## Cardinal heads to Southern California to face UCLA and USC 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Winter quarter and spring vacation are over,
and for the Stanford women's tennis team, that
means it's crunch time.
Coming off of its biggest victory of the season, a
7-2 dismantling of Texas, the second-ranked Car
dinal (15-1 overall, 3-0 Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) kicks off a stretch of seven
Pac-10 matches in just 15 days, four of them on
the road. According to head coach Frank Brennan
however, the Cardinal women often play their
best tennis under such circumstances.
"I think they focus well for big matches," he
said. "I think this is a team with priorities. I think
they realize that this is showtime. This is not a
time to miss practice or be casual with your train
ing. You've got to focus hard."
In a similar situation last season, the Cardinal
rolled through Pac-10 competition without drop
ping a single dual match, posting a 10-0 confer
ence record for the year.
No. 7 UCLA will be the first to challenge Stan
ford this afternoon in Los Angeles. The Bruins
(12-3, 3-2) feature the fourth-ranked singles play
er in the country, senior Keri Phebus. Phebus cap-

tured the NCAA singles title a
year ago.
"Day in and day out, I think
Phebus is the best player in the
country," Brennansaid. "She won
the national championship last
year and she could win it again."
Phebus (12-3) will collide with
Stanford All-American sopho
more Ania Bleszynski (12-4), who
may be coming off of her best two
sets of the season. After dropping
the first set against Farley Taylor
of Texas, the No. 8 singles player
in the nation, Bleszynski stormed
back to take the match 3-6, 6-2, 6-
1. The Cardinal sophomore cur
rently holds a No. 1 1 singles rank
in collegiate tennis.
Senior Paige Yaroshuk and
sophomores Stephanie Chi and

Kelly Rudolph also return for the
Bruins. UCLA boasts a combined
40-8 record for the season at the
No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 positions.
Paige and Yaroshuk also team
up for doubles competition, where
the duo has compiled a 9-2 record
and earned a No. 4 national rank
ing. The Bruins' three losses have
come at the hands of No. 4 Arizona
(twice) and No. 1 Florida.
Stanford can be certain that
last year's national quarterfinal
matchup will be fresh in UCLA's
mind this afternoon. In that con
test, the Cardinal bounced back
from a 4-3 deficit in doubles to
beat the Bruins and advance to the
semifinals. It was the third time
Stanford had beaten UCLA dur
ing the season.
"They don't like us much down
there," Brennan said. "The fact
that we seem to pull out all the big
ones — we beat them three times
last vear — that really sticks in

their claw a little bit. But we're re
ally competitive. We like to beat
those guys, so we'll be ready for
them."
Tomorrow the Cardinal will
clash with No. 21 USC (.10-4, 2-3).
The Trojans have defeated No. 29
Arizona State twice in conference
play but have lost to both UCLA
and Arizona.
"They've got quite a few new
faces," Brennan said of the Tro
jans. "We don't know too much
about them. They've got a few
players who took some time off
and played some professional ten
nis and had some mixed results, so
we just don't know how good they
are. We'll have our hands full
there, too."
At the very least, USC returns
seniors Melissa Hernando and
Suzanne Italiano and sophomore
Nicole London, whom the Cardi
nal encountered two times last
year.
