# Baseball notches sixth-straight win
## Cardinal kicks off homestand with a 4-3 victory over Arizona State 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Last night was full of oddities at Stan
ford's Sunken Diamond.
The only scheduled Thursday night
contest of the season featured rowdy
fans on the grassy hill receiving free piz
zas, a foul ball landing in the press box
behind home plate for just the second
time in history and the No. 13 Cardinal's
hottest hitter being ejected from the
game for an incident on the base paths.
There were some things that did look
normal, however, most notably the con
test's outcome — a 4-2 win for Stanford
over No. 16 Arizona State (22-14, 6-10
PacificlO Southern Division). The victo
ry extended the Cardinal's winning
streak to a season-high six games and
improved its record to 22-12 overall, 9-7
in the Six-Pac.
As in recent games, Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess got strong individ
ual performances from both his pitching
staff and his hitters. Sophomore Kyle
Peterson (5-4) collected his third-consec
utive win, missing his first complete
game of the season by just one batter.

"He had all his pitches going today,
and I definitely saw the Kyle Peterson of
last year," said catcher Jon Schaeffer.
"He's working hard and really getting a
feel for what he wants to do out there. He
just pitched an excellent game tonight —
he had them puzzled all night."
Schaeffer was referring to Peterson's
stellar 1995 campaign, which saw the big
right-hander claim National Freshman
of the Year honors after posting a 14-1
record. Despite a few rocky outings early
in the 1996 campaign, Peterson has re
gained his form.
"He's back pitching like he's capable,
especially in the last three outings,"
Marquess said. "He had a good fastball,
and the change was good. When you see
a lot of ground balls, I think they're out
in front of that change and they roll over
on it. It was a tight game the whole way,
so he couldn't give them much and he
didn't."
Offensively, the Cardinal had to
scrape for all four of its runs as starting
pitcher Jason Bond (4-3) allowed just
seven Stanford hits.
"I give Bond a lot of credit — we didn't
really hit the ball hard against him,"

Marquess said. "The runs we did get we
had to manufacture."
One Cardinal batsman who did hit
the ball hard was right fielder Joe Kil
burg, who went 2-for-2 with an RBI to
extend his hitting streak to nine games.
Kilburg got an early breather, though,
when he was ejected by umpire R.J.
Moya in the fourth inning for a collision
with Sun Devil shortstop Michael
Collins. Kilburg was in a run-down after
being picked off first base by Bond.
"I was just trying to draw an interfer
ence call, to get enough contact to get a
safe call and get to second," Kilburg said.
The incident was not the first contact
on the base paths in the game for Kil
burg, who collided with catcher Cody
McKay before scoring Stanford's first
run of the night.
With the victory, the Cardinal keeps
pace with Six-Pac front-runners USC
and UCLA, both of whom picked up wins
yesterday.
"We're playing good baseball right
now — the baseball we should be play
ing," Peterson said. "If we keep playing
like this, I think we're going to go a long
way."
