The Stanford wrestling team
completed a successful 1995-96
campaign by sending three of
its top wrestlers to the NCAA
Championships in Minneapo
lis, Minn., on March 21-23.
Seniors Jimmy Aguirre (131
pounds), Tod Surmon (142) and
Sahlan Martin (158) earned
Stanford a 29th-place finish in
the team standings, the Cardi
nal's highest place in six years.
Head coach Chris Horpel was
extremely satisfied with the re
sults, noting that the team had
accomplished three of its goals
by qualifying three wrestlers to
the tournament, producing one
All-American and breaking
back into the top 30 after being
away from the position for sev
eral years.
"We did all this under some
very difficult circumstances,"
Horpel said. "When our former
assistant coach, Dave Schultz,
was murdered at the end of Jan
uary, it really took some time to
get back on track. In the end, we
won- able to dedicate the end of
the season to Dave. I think he
would have been proud of our
performance."
The sixth-seeded Surmon
cruised through the first two
rounds, pinning Jon Vaughn of
Illinois in six minutes, 18 sec
onds and taking down 11th
seeded Dorian Hager of West
Virginia by a score of 6-5. Un
fortunately for Surmon, his
winning streak came to a halt in
the round of eight, where he
succumbed to third-seeded
John I lughes of Penn State, the
defending national champion at
142 pounds, by a narrow 5-4
margin.
Surmon — who qualified for
the NCAA tournament by win

ning the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships — was one of
four wrestlers (out of 330 qual
ifiers) who entered the tourna
ment undefeated — the first
wrestler in Stanford history to
do so. I le also set a school record
with an astonishing 23 consecu
tive victories.
Surmon won his first conso
lation match but went down in
the second to No. 2 seed Roger
Chandler of Indiana by a score
of 4-1. In his third and final
wrestle-back, Surmon beat Phil
Judge, the ninth seed out of
Michigan State, to finish the
season with a seventh-place fin
ish at NCAAs — good for All-
American honors — and a sen
sational 25-2 record.
Aguirre qualified for the
tourney with a third-place finish
at the Pac-10 Championships.
At NCAAs, Aguirre advanced to
the round of Hi with a 7-1 upset
of ninth-seeded Kmilio Nardone
ofSeton Hall, but then fell 4-3 to
eighth-seeded Yero Washington
of Fresno State.
Aguirre went on to capture
his first two matches in (he con
solation bracket but lost the
third to Frank Laccone of Pur
due. Overall, Aguirre finished
ninth in his bracket and earned
Honorable Mention All-Ameri
can accolades. Washington and
Laccone went on to place sixth
and eighth, respectively.
Martin placed fifth at the
Pac-10 Championships and
earned a wild-card bid to the
NCAAs. I lowever, Martin made
an early exit, losing 8-4 to
fourth-seeded Mark Bybee of
Northwestern in the round of
32. Martin then lost 9-5 to
Brook Iloerr of Indiana in his
first wrestle-back, eliminating
him from further competition.
Mart in finished the season with
a record of 16-8.
