# Senators discuss ways to balance research, teaching
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The Faculty Senate yesterday debated various
methods of measuring faculty involvement in under
graduate education.
Continuing discussion of "Planning in an Era of
Change" a report released recently by the Planning
and Policy Board — senators took sides on the ques
tion of how research and teaching should be balanced
at Stanford and whether, indeed, they can be exam
ined individually.
Discussion focused on four recommendations de
veloped by the senate's Steering Committee. No votes
were taken.
The plan that drew the most fire was a suggestion to
have the next Planning and Policy Board examine the
feasibility of institut ing a point system or other incen
tives to "ensure proper allocation of faculty time"
across research, graduate teaching, undergraduate
teaching and administ rat ive service.
I'nHor that plan, faculty mem
bers would earn points for serving
in those lour areas.
"The term pun it a) stem makes
mv teeth hurt," said Statistics
Prof. Bradley Efron. "I can't see
how anyone believes this is going to
solve the problem."
Philosophy Prof. John Perry
agreed, saying a point system
would not necessarily mean a shift
in focus to undergraduate educa
tion. For instance, he said, a profes
sor might give more hours of ser
vice to an administrative commit
tee in order to avoid teaching.
The solution to the problem is
not a system of points but a change
in the Stanford atmosphere, Perry
said.
"We mainly recruit people be
cause they want to make an intel
lectual success," he said. Teaching,
along with research, ought to offer
opportunities for the same kind of
success, he said.
"Make it economically reward
ing to be a great teacher at Stan
ford," he suggested.
The board recommended that
faculty and deans make a bigger
commitment to undergraduate ed
ucat ion, especially courses designed
for freshmen and sophomores.
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall,
however, stressed that undergrad
uate education as a whole is impor
tant and freshmen and sopho

mores shouldn't be privileged.
Communication Prof. Steven
Chaffee added, "This idea of set
aside courses for first- and second
year students is contradictory to
what a lot of us do."
Other senators said the issue at
hand hu= more to do with basic
about education than a sys
tem of incentives.
"We have to define what educa
tion is, what undergraduate educa
tion is," said Biology Prof. Robert
Simoni.

facility or an undergraduate teach
ing institution should be answered
before debate 011 the balance of the
two continues, he said.
From his point of view, he
added, "This is a research universi
ty, and research should remain the
most important objective, if only by
the tiniest of margins."
While it is difficult to convince
more faculty to teach undergradu
ate courses, it is not impossible,

English Prof. John Bender said.
Faculty in the School of Humani
ties and Sciences would need to
teach only one extra class every
other year in order to give every
freshman and sophomore a small
class experience, he said.
Such an effort would be well
worth it, Perry said.
"Our sophomore [curriculum]
has been a historic embarrass
ment," he said. "If we could solve
our sophomore-year problem by
having every faculty member teach
one more course, wow, what an op
portunity."
Several programs have already
been developed to make sophomore
year more accommodating of stu
dents looking for direction.
Also in the meeting, Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation Ramon Saldivar an
nounced professors teaching this
year's Sophomore College, a pro
gram that brings sophomores
back to Stanford two weeks early
to study in small groups with se
nior faculty and participate in ses
sions about research opportuni
ties.
University President Gerhard
Casper, Psychology Prof. Anne
Fernald and Biology Prof. Pat
.Jones will join last year's staff
Saldivar, Provost Condoleezza
Rice, Materials Science Prof. John
Bravman, Geological and Environ
mental Sciences Prof. Gail Mahood
and Law Prof. Robert Weisberg
for the program, which this year
will also expand to include 80 stu
dents, 30 more than last year.
