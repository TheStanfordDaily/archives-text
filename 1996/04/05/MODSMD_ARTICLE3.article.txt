## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The Faculty Senate yesterday debated various
methods of measuring faculty involvement in under
graduate education.
Continuing discussion of "Planning in an Era of
Change" a report released recently by the Planning
and Policy Board â€” senators took sides on the ques
tion of how research and teaching should be balanced
at Stanford and whether, indeed, they can be exam
ined individually.
Discussion focused on four recommendations de
veloped by the senate's Steering Committee. No votes
were taken.
The plan that drew the most fire was a suggestion to
have the next Planning and Policy Board examine the
feasibility of institut ing a point system or other incen
tives to "ensure proper allocation of faculty time"
across research, graduate teaching, undergraduate
teaching and administ rat ive service.
