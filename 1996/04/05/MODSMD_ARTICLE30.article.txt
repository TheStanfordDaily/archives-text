# Women's water polo meets Davis — again
## Cardinal has taken last three contests 
### Erin Bryla Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's water
polo team may be playing UC-
Davis once again this weekend,
but this time the roles have
changed. The fifth-ranked Cardi
nal will no longer be the underdog
when it takes on the seventh
ranked Aggies tomorrow at 10
a.m. in DeGuerre Pool.
Stanford has downed Davis in
each of its last three meetings.
While the Cardinal women
wouldn't mind seeing some varia
tion in their opponents, they also
see the benefits of playing the
same teams time and again.
"It's always good when you know
a lot about every player," said fresh
man goalie I leather Crary. "You get
to know every player's moves."
Crary has helped transform the
Cardinal into a hard-nosed defen
sive squad. ()n the ot her side of the
ball, however, Stanford still hopes
to see marked improvement in the
number of goals it scores. While
the women have been on lire
against some teams, they have yet
to light up the net against a na
tional contender like Davis.
The last meeting between the
Cardinal and the Aggies proved
significantly closer than the Car
dinal would have liked. Stanford
pulled off a narrow 6-3 victory at
Davis last weekend.

"The Stanford players should
be confident, but I hope that they
are not overlooking this team,"
said Cardinal head coach Ben Quit
tner. "I am looking for them to be
consistent and beat the teams that
they have been beating all season."

Davis boasted a No. 3 ranking
in each of its last three meetings
with Stanford. Since then howev
er, Stanford has maintained its
No. 5 slot while Davis has been
bumped out of the top five by last
year's national champions. Slip-

pery Hock.
Tomorrow's matchup will be
t Cardinal's only contest of the
day, unlike most Saturdays where
t lie women have played as many as
three games of t heir 50-game sea
son.
