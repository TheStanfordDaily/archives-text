In an effort to stay within campaign spending limits,
members of a sen ior class president slate asked two but
ton companies to falsify receipts to indicate that the slate
had spent less than the full amount paid for the 100 but
tons.
One company agreed to falsify the receipt, but, after
being contacted by The Daily, changed its mind and in
formed t he slate it was abandoning the deal.
The members of the "PHAT" slate, juniors Bella
Shen, Hadlev Al>ernathy, Aymeric Praise and Brant
Richards, said yesterday that due to ethical reasons, the
button idea was scrapped even before the Word of Mouth
button company of Palo Alto pullet! out of the deal.
"We realize we made a mistake," Abernathy said. "We
are wrong. We apologize to all those we let down."
Both button company owners said they had never be
fore received a request for two different receipts.
"It seemed to me that it was wrong for them to be vi
olating t heir campaign rules and it's unfair to the other
candidates and the students in the election," said Neil
Nathanson, who owns Original Buttons in Mountain

View. Nathanson said he refused the slate's request for
a $20 reduction in the indicated cost of the order on the
reccipt.

slate can spend a maximum of $120 on its campaign. Ex
ceeding the limit can result in disqualification from the
elect ion, Hearings Officer Solomon Ijoflersaid.
liefler said he will not decide whether to take action
until he receives more factual information about the
case.
"I think that might be an attempt to subvert or un
ethically influence the election," he said. "I haven't de
cided whether it is or not."
The spring general election will be held April 17 mid
18.
In a letter to Word of Mouth, a copy of which was ob
tained by The Daily, Shen asked the company to write
them "a second receipt saying we sjK'nt $(i since we are
spending over our budget." Shen said the letter was not
sent to the firm.
The firm's owner, who asked that she not be identi
fied, said the order for 100 buttons was placed with the
intent of returning two receipts, hut no receipts or in
voices were faxed.
