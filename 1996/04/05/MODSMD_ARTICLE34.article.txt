# A 						major hang-up
## 
### 
()ne of my biggest hang-ups is people who do.
You know what I mean You say. "Hello. They
say, "Click, without even leaving their name,
number or a brief message. 1 hate it when that
happens, and it happened again today. Twin-
It didn't use to bother me much, but it's
been happening more and more and more. And
it's gotten to the point where these premature
consummators of conversation have become the
pit bull of my pet peeves. 1 mean it they rank
right up there with people who state the obvi
ous at climactic points in movies (but that's
another column).
Now. I realize 1 might seem a little too
worked up. and I realize that I'm not alone. Hut
the problem':- worse than you might think. -Just
consider this breaking news story that never
broke:
ANYWHERE, USA (AP) — Some call him
the Unacaller. Others know him as "Mr Hang-
Up." Hut one thing's for sure: The hellion of
hang-up is back, and he's busier than ever, hit
ting harried households at an unprecedented
pace.
Known for his unique "hit-and-run'-
prankstvle, this telephone troublemaker has
eluded police for months and continues to
invade the phone lines and phone lives of thou
sands of people across the count ry.
"This is obviously someone with a lot of free
time on their hands," said Police Captain Ralph
Nadermeyer. "We don't have much informa
tion. We think he's a male, but maybe he's a
female. I mean. . . franklv. we're at a loss."

And the calls keep coming Marta Brockmey
er. of Rloomfield, N T. has had her line hit
seven times this week alone.
"I was on the phone with my mother when
my call-waiting beeped. Hroekmeyer said
through tears. "I clicked over, but there was
nobody there. I was confused. I tried to get back
to my mom, but I don't know — there was
just a dial tone We were . . . cut off."
From Anapolis to Anaheim, all people can do
is uneasily go on about their business, their
lives disrupted by the constant fear that the
next caller just might be him. Apparently, some
are victimized even when they're not at home.
"Like, I came home and there was a message
on my machine, right'.'" said part-time college
student Dorn Bartle. "Hut really, there, like,
wasn't! I mean, it was just like 'Click! Dial tone.
. .' No message, no nothin' — 'sup with that?"
Unfortunately, say police, normal tactics are
proving fruit less.
"Usually, we tell people, 'If you think it's
him, try to stay on the line 'til we trace him,'
said Nadermeyer. "Hut if they can keep him on
the line. then. well, it's obviously not him. . ."
As you can see, this is no laughing matter.
And as the problem grows, so do the questions:
Who is this person'.' What exactly does he want?
And why won't he just ask for it'.' In my experi
ence, I don't remember any other prank callers
that seem to have this problem.
Last year, it was "Michael," who called every
night for a week at 2 a.m., "just to talk." Before
that, there was "Sigi." who called several morn

ings and crowed like a rooster before reading
me my daily Bible verse. In seventh grade, it
was "Mario." who proudly announced, its
Mario!" and then left the Super Mario Bros,
theme on my answering machine.
And just last month, my roommate hung up
on an obscene phone caller. A female obscene
phone caller. (When 1 told him he'd just cut
short what many men pay $5 a minute for. ho
seemed unaffected. "What can I say'.' 1 asked
what she wanted." he explained. "She said she
wanted me to get off. So I did." But that s
another column. >
The point is, whoever is behind the hated
hang-ups has a sophisticated sickness. Appar
ently, they lack the true grit that it takes to
make it as a truly crafty cranker. They lack the
pride to prank. And perhaps we shouldn't be so
quick to call the caller callous.
Obviously, this is someone who is very lone
ly. Someone wanting to garner attention, but
not knowing how. Someone who needs to reach
out and touch someone, but all he can do is
reach. Someone we can identify with.
No, "Mr. Hang-Up" is not wise or wicked, or
even simple. He simply does not know how to
ask.
And maybe there's just a little bit ol "Mr.
Hang-Up" in all of us.
Sniff.
