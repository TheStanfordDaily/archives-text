# Prof, captures science award

### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Stanford Chemistry Prof. Robert Waymouth was
named the recipient Tuesday of the Alan T. Waterman
Award from the National Science Foundation.
Each year, the $500,000 award, named in honorof the
first director of the National Science Foundation, is
given to one researcher age 35 or younger. Waymouth is
the third Stanford faculty member to win in the award's
21-year history.
Waymouth said ho was "kind of speechless" when he
found out about the award. "1 didn't expect to get it at
all."
Waymouth's research is in the crossroads of organic,
inorganic and polymer chemistry. This year, along with
graduate student Geoffrey Coates, he created a new type


Sothy Chhe — Daily
of polypropylene that could be
used in everything from car
bumpers to clothing.
Polypropylene is a common
plastic t hat currently can be found
in two forms a hard form used
for containers, clothing and insu
lation, and a soft form used in
roofing tars and melt adhesives.
Way mouth's research combines
the two forms to create a rubber
like substance that is strong but
elastic.
In order to combine the two
forms of polypropylene, Way
mouth had to invent a catalyst
that changes form as it constructs
a chain of polypropylene. The elas
tic polypropylene consists of the
combination of hard isotactic and
soft atactic segments.
The catalyst is a metallocene
consisting of a single metal atom
sandwiched between two fiat
rings containing five carbon
atoms. Two additional rings are
attached to the sides of each ring.
Short propylene monomers are
welded together at the site of the
atom, creating a long string of

polypropylene molecules.
When the two rings are on op
posite sides of the atom, a hard
polymer is created. When the rings
are on the same side, a soft poly
mer is created.
The challenge, Way mouth said,
was to keep the rings from rotat
ing too fast — without control of
the speed, the polypropylene chain
would have very short hard se
quences and would behave like a
soft polymer.
Waymouth and Coates added
extra atoms to the rings to slow
the rotation rates, allowing the
catalyst to oscillate between struc
tures so the mix of hard and soft
polymers can be controlled. The
lengths of strings of the hard and
soft variety can be controlled by
changing the pressure and tem
perature of the reaction.
The technique is so new its ap
plications and variations are still
unknown, Waymouth said.
"It's a new idea, and we don't
really know how general it is," he
said. "There's a whole new field
out there you can play around in."
The $500,000 that came with
the award, to be spent over three
years, will be useful because it car
ries no restrictions, Waymouth
said.

"I'm free to explore off-the-wall
and bizarre ideas," he said. "I
think if I'd tried to get funding for
this idea, people would have
looked at me like I was a lunatic."
Psychology Prof. Ewart
Thomas, who serves on the com
mittee that names winners of the
Waterman award, said those
"bizarre" ideas helped earn him
the award.
"We had a lot of candidates who
made novel contributions, but we
thought that Bob's work was rela
tively unexpected, given the state
of polymer chemistry at the time,"
Thomas said.
He added that the overall qual
ity of nominees was high and he
would like to bring many of them
to Stanford to complement Way
mouth's contributions to science.
Department of Chemistry
Chair John Brauman said Way
mouth himself already makes a
significant contribution to the
quality of the department.
"Stanford wants to be the best
there is, and having people like
Mr. Waymouth make it that way,"
Brauman said. "He's a spectacular
scientist. He's a spectacular
teacher. ... I think he represents
exactly the kind of faculty member
that all of us admire."
