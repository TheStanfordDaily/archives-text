## Law prof, will join city government of SF 
### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
Law Prof. Michael Wald will soon be an
nounced by San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown
as the city's new social services director.
"It's something that I'm very excited about
and looking forward to," said Wald.
The Department of Social Services is re
sponsible for administering several welfare

programs, including Aid to Families with De
pendent Children. The agency's other pro
grams deal with food stamps, medical benefits,
indigent persons, child abuse and neglect and
the elderly. Wald said he will be responsible for
the "overall carrying-out of programs that the
department administers."
In 1993, Wald began serving in the general
counsel's office in the Department of Health
and Human Services in Washington, where he

worked on department policy drafting laws. Pie
returned to Stanford in January and was con
tacted in early February for the San Francisco
position, he said.
Wald said the main challenges he will en
counter will be budget cutbacks and changes in
welfare policy at the federal and state levels. He
said it will be more difficult to continue pro-
prams due to both funding reduc
tions and what he called the
"punitive" nature of some of the
new rules.
Wald believes his appointment
reflects Brown's desire to bring in
new people for a number of im
portant posts in the city govern
ment. Wald added that this is not
uncharacteristic for San Francis
co; past city mayors have taken
similar steps.
San Francisco presents a
unique situation compared to
most places, however, because it
is a city and a county, Wald said.
Welfare programs are usually ad
ministered by counties, so may
ors of other cities cannot easily
make changes to county govern
ment.
Wald will begin the job in the
first week of June. He will take a
leave of absence from the Law
School in order to fulfill his new
duties, although he said he
"might participate in some class
es" on an informal basis.
