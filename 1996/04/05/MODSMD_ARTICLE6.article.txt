# Dealing with depression

Attending a competitive school such as Stanford
is often accompanied by a fair share of anxiety, as it
has been for senior Megan Curran, who currently
faces the pressures of graduation, preparation for
medical school, career decision-making and family
problems at home.
For many students, these pressures often result
in an emotional low. And for a small minority, in
cluding Curran, it's more than just feeling
"bummed out" — it's a clinical illness called de
pression. Curran was diagnosed with major depres
sion during her freshman year.
"It's not that my life was falling apart; I have a
lot of good things going on, too," said Curran. "But
I was just really unhappy. I would be normal
around people, then 1 would go into my room and
just dissolve. There were times when I cried every
day for a month."
For junior Mike Schneider, who was diagnosed
with manic depression in fall 1992, his change of
mood came after his grandfather's death during his
senior year in high school.
"I was facing a lot of regular life pressures, but
when my grandfather died, it flipped a switch,"
Schneider said. "I didn't know what depression was
at the time. I was hiding in bed and never wanted to
see anyone."
Curran and Schneider are not alone. On a year
ly average, 10 percent to 13 percent of the student
body seeks individual guidance from Counseling
And Psychological Services, a division of Cowell
