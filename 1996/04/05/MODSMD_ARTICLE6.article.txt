# Dealing with depression
## 
### Jenn Huie Contributing writer 
Attending a competitive school such as Stanford
is often accompanied by a fair share of anxiety, as it
has been for senior Megan Curran, who currently
faces the pressures of graduation, preparation for
medical school, career decision-making and family
problems at home.
For many students, these pressures often result
in an emotional low. And for a small minority, in
cluding Curran, it's more than just feeling
"bummed out" — it's a clinical illness called de
pression. Curran was diagnosed with major depres
sion during her freshman year.
"It's not that my life was falling apart; I have a
lot of good things going on, too," said Curran. "But
I was just really unhappy. I would be normal
around people, then 1 would go into my room and
just dissolve. There were times when I cried every
day for a month."
For junior Mike Schneider, who was diagnosed
with manic depression in fall 1992, his change of
mood came after his grandfather's death during his
senior year in high school.
"I was facing a lot of regular life pressures, but
when my grandfather died, it flipped a switch,"
Schneider said. "I didn't know what depression was
at the time. I was hiding in bed and never wanted to
see anyone."
Curran and Schneider are not alone. On a year
ly average, 10 percent to 13 percent of the student
body seeks individual guidance from Counseling
And Psychological Services, a division of Cowell


Sothy Chhe — Daily
Student Health Services. Seven
teen pcrcent of this total falls in the
category of depression.
There has been a significant in
crease over the past three years of
students who come to Stanford with
anti-depressant medication, a> well
as an increase in the need for such
medication after arrival, -aid Ale
jandro Martinez, director of CAPS.
Depression is consistently one of
the top two reasons students seek
counseling at the Bridge, Stan
ford's peer counseling center, sec
ond only to relationship problems.
Young adults and college students
are especially vulnerable to this ill
ness, said Doug Daher, staff psy
chologist at Cowell.
"It's easy in a community like
this, where there's intense competi
tion and a lot of pressure to per
form, to get off balance," said
Daher. "Students often put too
much emphasis on one aspect of
their life and forget about the oth
ers, like exercise and sleep."
Depression results from a wide
spectrum of variables, ranging
from genetic predispositions to
chemical imbalances, said Daher.
"There is a perception from the
outside that the stressful Stanford
environment is what drives stu
dents to seek counseling," he said.
"But that's not the case. It's a com
bination of many factors, often in
volving students' past experi
ences."
This is the case for Curran.
"My dad was an alcoholic and
manic depressive, so I have it in my

genes," Curran said. "I was sexual
ly assaulted during my freshman
year of high school. I was so scared.
It's a memory I repressed for long
time."
Instead of talking about her
problems, in high school Curran
turned to alcohol and bulimia as an
escape, she said. When she came to
Stanford, Curran wanted a clean
start, but found that her problems
had "snuck into [her] suitcases and
came along with (her)."
"There was a small voice inside
me that really wanted to get help,"
she said. "I remember confiding in
my (resident assistant) early in the
year that I was dealing with alcohol
problems and an eating disorder. I
wanted help because I felt like I had
earned the opportunities that Stan
ford had to offer, and I didn't want
them taken away from me. I de
served to be here, but not the way I
was."
Curran took her first step by
seeking counseling at Cowell,
where she received a prescription
for Prozac, one of several new anti
depressants that are now the most
frequently prescribed for depres
sion. These anti-depressants serve
to enhance the patient's mood, said
Erin Chapman, psychiatrist at
('dwell
"In the past, physicians were not
comfortable with prescribing anti
depressants because they had a lot
of side effects and were lethal in an
overdose," Chapman said. "The
new [anti-depressants) are very
safe. Some side effects could include
nausea, headaches and decrease in
sex drive, but are very unlikely."
I lowever, Prozac was not the so
lution to Curran's problems. The
negative side effects of fatigue and

nausea she experienced were a con
stant irritation.
"My low point during my fresh
man year was one night when I
went on a blind date and got drunk,
even when I had decided not to
drink," Curran said. "I blacked out
and woke up in the morning with a
black eye and covered in my own
vomit. I knew right then it had to
stop."
Curran stopped out spring quar
ter that year and was hospitalized
for a month. It was then that she
was first diagnosed with clinical de
pression.
There are two major types of de
pression — depression and manic
depression. The first, as in Curran's
case, is when the patient's mood
varies between being normal or de
pressed, said Chapman. The latter,
as in Schneider's case, is when the
patient's mood varies between
being depressed and being "high"
or "euphoric."
"Manic depressives are often as
sociated with psychosis," said
Chapman. "They have extra energy
and may take spontaneous actions
like spending money they don't
have or go on gambling sprees."
Schneider was diagnosed with
manic depression the summer be
fore com ing to Stan ford.
"1 had a wild summer of cop car
chases and skv diving," he said. "My
relationship with my family was
going to shit. Things were out of
control. Then 1 got arrested for tres
passing when I went to visit a friend
at his school and was taken to jail.
My lawyer got me released to a psy
chiatric hospital where I was diag
nosed with manic depression."
The idea of being manic depres
sive was hard to accept, said Schnei

der. His initial reaction was to resist
medication.
"I couldn't accept the fact that
there was something more power
ful then me," he said. "I was taught
all my life that I could overcome
anything. But I can't beat this
thing, and I never will. That just
sucks."
Schneider has been taking lithi
um on and ofT since his diagnosis.
Lithium is one of the few "miracle
drugs" in psychiatry that helps pre
vent the recurrence of manic-de
pressive episodes. In the last four
years, however, Schneider has ex
perienced 10 manic episodes. These
episodes occurred when he stopped
taking medication in order to in
duce a mental "high."
"A drug addict can always find
his drug, mine is in my head," said
Schneider. Each manic episode re
sulted in hospitalization.
Being "high" is a state of mind
and it makes one feel all-powerful,
Schneider said. Realistic percep
tions become obscure.
"1 bought a shotgun last fall and
was playing with it in my mouth,"
he said. "I had the energy to pull the
trigger, and I didn't have the judg
ment to do otherwise."
Currently, Schneider has
stopped out from Stanford and will
return next fall. His primary care is
through the Partial Hospitalization
Program at Stanford Hospital,
which includes one hour of group
therapy, four days a week. Schnei
der has also involved himself with a
12-step program through Narcotics
Anonymous.
A cure has not yet been found for
manic depression. Manic depres
sives may recover, but there tends
to be a lifelong vulnerability and

subsequent recurrences.
Less serious types of depression
am be cured with a combination of
medication and psycho-social sup
port. There ;ire several medical per
spectives on the illness, said Daher.
"You can look at depression as a
type of self-regulation, a way of
slowing up the system," he said.
"It's a way to tell the ego-conscious
ness that it's time to get back on
balance and gain better self-aware
ness."
This may have been a factor for
Curran, who tapered off medication
during her sophomore year because
it was putting her to sleep in class,
she said. Last fall, she began taking
Zoloft, another one of the new anti
depressants. Though she feels
much more emotionally stable, she
still does not feel completely herself.
"It's so hard for me to deal with
uncertainty and change," Curran
said. "Part of me knows it's a chem
ical imbalance in my brain. Taking
anti-depressants for me is like a di
abetic taking insulin. It may be
something 1 need to function, to be
happy and healthy."
As a lIA for Cedro House and a
poor counselor at the Bridge, Cur
ran is putting her efforts towards
helping others that may share her
past experiences.
"People who know me but don't
know what I've been through are
always surprised when they find
out about my past," said Curran. "I
think it's a really important lesson
to know that a lot of students have
stuff going on underneath their fa
cades, especially at Stanford. Most
everyone has had a 1 raumatic expx'-
rience in their life that they've had
to deal with, and it's just not talked
about enough."
