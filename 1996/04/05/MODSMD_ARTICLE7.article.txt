## Dean hopes to 'live, eat, breathe' student life 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Days of eating together in a uni
versity cafeteria will return for
Dean of Students Marc Wais and his
wife Sue.
When they first started dating,
Marc Wais was studying at Harvard
University, and they often ate
meals together in Harvard's cafete
ria. Now married, they will be mov
ing next August into Junipero
House in Wilbur Hall, where Marc
Wais will take over reign as resident
fellow and will once again enjoy
meals with his wife in a college din
ing hall.
Wais will be replacing Eddie At
wood as RF of Junipero. Though
the Wais family, which includes two

daughters, ages 1 and 3, will not
move into Junipero until next fall,
both Wais and his wife are already
meeting with potential resident as
sistants and will be spending the
next six weeks working on the rigor
ous RA selection process.
In addition to anticipat ing work
ing with the residence staff, the
Wais family is eager to learn more
about Stanford students and Stan
ford culture in general.
"I hope to get a better sense of
the pulse of the campus, to see what
happens after 5 o'clock in the
evening," Wais said. "We are all ex
cited to be living, eating and breath
ing Stanford."
Both Marc and Sue Wais have
experience in residential education.
Marc Wais served as part of a resi
dence staff at George Washington
University and the University of
Miami and is familiar with the hous
ing system at Harvard. Sue Wais
has a master's degree in education
and worked in student activities at
Emerson College in Boston and
William Paterson College of New
Jersey in Wayne, N.J.
"I am looking forward to inter
acting with students again," Sue

Wais said.
Residential Education Director
Jane Camarillo said Marc and Sue
Wais "feed off each other's energy."
"Marc comes with enthusiasm
and energy to this position and with
the balance of experience that we
love for RFs," she said.
The position of RF is generally a
renewable one-year appointment.
The maximum stay for an RF is four
years, with some exceptions. Ac
cording to Camarillo, the main du
ties of an RF are to direct program
ming of dorm presentations, pro
mote community development and
supervise the residence staff, which

includes RAs, the head academic ad
visor and t he resident computer co
ordinator. RFs are also expected to
make themselves available to resi
dents by going to dinner in the din
ing hall and inviting students into
their apartments for informal chats.
"I plan to provide the intellectual
flavor for the dorm, support the RA
staff, ensure that people succeed
outside of the classroom and form a
sense of community," Marc Wais
said. "The students should feel that
Junipero is their home."
As to whether he saw any conflict
of interest in serving both as dean of
students and as mi RF, Wais re

sponded that, should any conflict
arise, he can always defer to some
one else in his office. He said he will
keep his roles as separate as possi
ble.
"Once I enter the house, I be
come IVhu-c the RF, not Marc the
dean," he said.
Wais is confident that his family
and Junipero will Ixi a good fit. Stu
dents will benefit from his and his
wife's experience and enthusiasm,
lie said. Also, Wais said, his family
will benefit greatly from their expo
sure to students, and he hopes that
his daughters will feel like they have
94 big brothers and sisters next year.
