## Dean hopes to 'live, eat, breathe' student life 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Days of eating together in a uni
versity cafeteria will return for
Dean of Students Marc Wais and his
wife Sue.
When they first started dating,
Marc Wais was studying at Harvard
University, and they often ate
meals together in Harvard's cafete
ria. Now married, they will be mov
ing next August into Junipero
House in Wilbur Hall, where Marc
Wais will take over reign as resident
fellow and will once again enjoy
meals with his wife in a college din
ing hall.
Wais will be replacing Eddie At
wood as RF of Junipero. Though
the Wais family, which includes two

daughters, ages 1 and 3, will not
move into Junipero until next fall,
both Wais and his wife are already
meeting with potential resident as
sistants and will be spending the
next six weeks working on the rigor
ous RA selection process.
In addition to anticipat ing work
ing with the residence staff, the
Wais family is eager to learn more
about Stanford students and Stan
ford culture in general.
"I hope to get a better sense of
the pulse of the campus, to see what
happens after 5 o'clock in the
evening," Wais said. "We are all ex
cited to be living, eating and breath
ing Stanford."
Both Marc and Sue Wais have
experience in residential education.
