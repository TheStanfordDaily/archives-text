With a $1.2 million grant from
the Carnegie Corp., the Stanford
Adolescence Center began its first
project yesterday when a group of
undergraduate and graduate stu

from an East Hay community group
attempting to curb teen-age vio

Psychiatry Prof. Chris Hayward
and Sociology Prof. Emeritus
Sandy Dornbusch, the center's
principal investigators, announced
the grant at a meeting Wednesday.
The grant came after Stanford
won a competition between several
universities, Dornbusch said. He

added that when the Carnegie
Council on Adolescent Develop

money to one university to continue
similar work.
"They invited various schools to
consider setting up a center, and we
won the competition," Dornbusch
said, adding that the money should
last for two years. "Stanford has
many excellent researchers in this
area, many of whom don't know
each other, and this kind of collabo
ration and integration has remark
able potential."
The center will serve as an acad
emic community in which profes
sors and students can share their
