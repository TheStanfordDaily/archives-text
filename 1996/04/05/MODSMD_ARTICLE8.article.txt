# Center will focus on study of adolescence
## 
### Marni Leff Contributing writer 
With a $1.2 million grant from
the Carnegie Corp., the Stanford
Adolescence Center began its first
project yesterday when a group of
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents met with representatives
from an East Hay community group
attempting to curb teen-age vio
lence.
Psychiatry Prof. Chris Hayward
and Sociology Prof. Emeritus
Sandy Dornbusch, the center's
principal investigators, announced
the grant at a meeting Wednesday.
The grant came after Stanford
won a competition between several
universities, Dornbusch said. He

added that when the Carnegie
Council on Adolescent Develop
ment folded, it decided to give
money to one university to continue
similar work.
"They invited various schools to
consider setting up a center, and we
won the competition," Dornbusch
said, adding that the money should
last for two years. "Stanford has
many excellent researchers in this
area, many of whom don't know
each other, and this kind of collabo
ration and integration has remark
able potential."
The center will serve as an acad
emic community in which profes
sors and students can share their
work and receive feedback.
"Take the issue of puberty, for
example," Dornbusch said. "We
have a lot of talented people in dif
ferent fields working on the topic,
from endocrinologists to sociolo
gists."
Collaborating through the cen
ter, Dornbusch explained, will help
both faculty and students further
their research.
"For me personally, although I

am retired, I am still doing re
search," Dornbusch said. "The cen
ter is really a chance for me, and
others, to receive constructive criti
cism. In the process of doing re
search, people will be able to {ire
sent their work and get feedback
from others who specialize in ado
lescence and therefore be able to do
a better job."
In addition to providing academ
ic opportunities, Dornbusch said,
the center is linked to the Chil
dren's I lealth Council and the East
Bay Public Safety Corridor. The
Children's Health Council will
work with the center in clinical

studies. The center will also help
the East Bay Public Safety Corridor
in its attempt to reduce adolescent
violence.
Work with the East Bay Public
Safety Corridor, Dornbusch said,
began yesterday when graduate
and undergraduate students met
with group representatives.
The Curriculum on Children
and Society, which currently has
128 undergraduate students, will
become part of the center. The cen
ter is adding a new course on ado
lescence to the curriculum, and it
will provide undergraduates with
the opportunity to work as paid re

search interns.
With about half of the 41 faculty
participants coming from tin
School of Medicine, Dornbusch said
the center will serve as a tremen
dous resource for undergraduates.
"Participation in research pro
jects is what provides students wit h
a really great education," Dorn
busch said. "We're looking to have
students help us develop t he project
from the very early stages."
Students interested in intern
ships with the center need to apply
for a year-long training seminar
and should contact Hayward for
more informat ion.
