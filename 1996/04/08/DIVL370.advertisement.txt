Hey, you. Yeah you. Down here. I'm talking to you.
I know what you're thinking. It's a talking ant. Well, get
over it.'Cause I got a beef to grind. All I've been hearing about
lately is how powerful Macintosh computers are. The power of
multimedia. The power of easy Internet access. The power
of cross-platform compatibility. And on top of that, Apple is
practically giving all that power away with their incredibly
low campus prices. Well, you know what I say? Power
is being able to lift 12 times your own body weight,
pal. See that leaf over there? I'm gonna
go bench press it.
