Abbas Milani
Tales of Two Cities
Abbas Milani was born to a well-off family in old-world, prc-oil-boom Tehran in
1948. At the age of 15, he was sent to San Francisco to be educated, and in 1975 he
returned to his childhood home to teach in modern Iran. By 1977 he was
imprisoned by the Shah's regime, but in 1986 he returned to the United States in
self-exile. Kirkus Reviews wrote of lales of Two Cities, "Any book chronicling these
experiences would be interesting; that this one turns out to be a breathtaking
example of the quiet, selfless gorgeousness of the memoirist's art is the reader's
good fortune."
