## Ethical questions raised as ASSU leaves one side out 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
The handbook for the upcom
ing ASSU spring general election
was almost printed without a
statement in favor of a proposed
new ASSU Constitution to offset a
statement in opposition.
Although both statements are

now included in the handbook, the mix-up has led to
ethical questions about the balance of viewpoints in
the student body's guide to voting in the election,
which will be made available tomorrow.
"Constitution '96," authored by senior Michael
Slemmer, is one of two amendments to be voted on
in this spring's election. It would replace the current
four-person Council of Presidents with a single pres
ident and vice president, create a judicial branch for
the ASSU, reduce the size of the senate by 25 per
cent and give all senators voting power.
ASSU Elections Commissioner Ryan Medders al
lowed the authors of the con statement — ASSU
Senate Chair Alane Murdock and COP members
Rich Stolz and Nicole Vazquez — to submit their
text late to ASSU Type and Design, but no effort was
made to request the submission of a pro statement
from the author or sponsors of "Constitution '96."
The mix-up has fueled intense disagreements
about the ASSU's duties to ensure a balanced pre
sentation of election information and to facilitate
the involvement of students outside the organiza
tion.
A question of ethics
Much of the debate centers around who has re
sponsibility for soliciting or submitting statements
on ballot measures.
Because ASSU Bylaws do not require the elec
tions commissioner to solicit such statements, Med
ders' failure to notify Slemmer of the submission of
a con statement does not constitute an elections vio
lation.
However, in a portion of the bylaws about the
election handbook, it states that "a position state
ment [must be] submitted by each sponsor."
But because of a conflicting clause in another sec
tion of the constitution, interpretations of the elec
tions commissioner's responsibilities to collect in
formation for the handbook vary widely.
Medders admitted that not presenting both sides
of the issue is ethically problematic and said "ideal
ly you would have someone publicize the need for
sponsors" for and against any constitutional mea
sure to appear on the election ballot.
However, due to the importance of strictly fol
lowing job descriptions the ASSU assigns its offi
cers, Medders said he might have overstepped his
bounds if he had sought out a pro statement.
Agreeing with Medders' close following of the by
laws' election rules, Murdock said, "In the ASSU if
you try to do something that is not in your job de
scription, you can get in trouble."
