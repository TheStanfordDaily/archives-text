## Ethical questions raised as ASSU leaves one side out 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
The handbook for the upcom
ing ASSU spring general election
was almost printed without a
statement in favor of a proposed
new ASSU Constitution to offset a
statement in opposition.
Although both statements are

now included in the handbook, the mix-up has led to
ethical questions about the balance of viewpoints in
the student body's guide to voting in the election,
which will be made available tomorrow.
"Constitution '96," authored by senior Michael
Slemmer, is one of two amendments to be voted on
in this spring's election. It would replace the current
four-person Council of Presidents with a single pres
ident and vice president, create a judicial branch for
the ASSU, reduce the size of the senate by 25 per
cent and give all senators voting power.
ASSU Elections Commissioner Ryan Medders al
lowed the authors of the con statement — ASSU
Senate Chair Alane Murdock and COP members
Rich Stolz and Nicole Vazquez — to submit their
text late to ASSU Type and Design, but no effort was
made to request the submission of a pro statement
from the author or sponsors of "Constitution '96."
The mix-up has fueled intense disagreements
about the ASSU's duties to ensure a balanced pre
sentation of election information and to facilitate
the involvement of students outside the organiza
tion.
A question of ethics
Much of the debate centers around who has re
sponsibility for soliciting or submitting statements
on ballot measures.
Because ASSU Bylaws do not require the elec
tions commissioner to solicit such statements, Med
ders' failure to notify Slemmer of the submission of
a con statement does not constitute an elections vio
lation.
However, in a portion of the bylaws about the
election handbook, it states that "a position state
ment [must be] submitted by each sponsor."
But because of a conflicting clause in another sec
tion of the constitution, interpretations of the elec
tions commissioner's responsibilities to collect in
formation for the handbook vary widely.
Medders admitted that not presenting both sides
of the issue is ethically problematic and said "ideal
ly you would have someone publicize the need for
sponsors" for and against any constitutional mea
sure to appear on the election ballot.
However, due to the importance of strictly fol
lowing job descriptions the ASSU assigns its offi
cers, Medders said he might have overstepped his
bounds if he had sought out a pro statement.
Agreeing with Medders' close following of the by
laws' election rules, Murdock said, "In the ASSU if
you try to do something that is not in your job de
scription, you can get in trouble."

Nevertheless, Slemmer called
the fact that he was not asked to
submit a statement "ridiculous."
Medders, Murdock and Stolz
each claimed they had assumed
Slemmer was aware of his right to
submit a statement and that he
was going to do so. But Slemmer
said he felt their failure to inform
him of the con statement was
"more insidious" than their as
sumptions.
Slemmer said he thought no
pro or con statements would be in
cluded in this year's handbook
since last year's handbook did not
have opinions on the ballot's con
stitutional measures.
Slemmer said he was prompt
ed to write the llth-hour state
ment after he received a copy of
the con statement late Thursday
from Jon Oram, COP member
and co-sponsor of "Constitution
'96."
"I felt it was my responsibility
to inform [Slemmer], present the
issue to the Elections Commis
sion and make sure that both

sides be represented," Oram said.
"I was shocked at the possibility
that a con statement would ap
pear | in the handbook] and no pro
statement. ... What would that
say about the validity of this elec
tion?"
The authors of the statement
against "Constitution "96" are
concerned now that Slemmer
might have benefited unfairly
from access to his opposition's in
formation.
Slemmer's statement is "in
formed by ours, but ours is not in
formed by his," Stolz said. "That
is not exactly fair."
"It gives one side an unfair ad
vantage when they have access to
the other side's information,"
Murdock added. "That creates
some real ethical problems."
Calling the issue of unequal ac
cess to information a "valid con
cern," Slemmer said he avoided
formulating his statement as a re
action to the con statement.
"Although I could have been
unfair and aimed my statement as
a direct response to theirs, I didn't
do it that way," he said. "I was try
ing to be really upfront."
Oram added that his "intent
was not to make sure that ISlem

mer] had an unfair advantage,"
but rather to ensure the election
handbook have a fair balance of
opinions on "Constitution '96."

'It gives one side an
unfair advantage
when they have ac
cess to the other
side's information.'

Outsiders' involvement
In addition to ethical disagree
ments among the Elections Com
mission, proponents and oppo
nents of "Constitution '96," the
last-minute submission of state
ments has raised concern about
how difficult it is for outsiders to
participate in the ASSU.
Graduate senator Bernard
Gilroy said, "It's certainly a pa
thetic thing if the only way to get
access [to ASSU procedures! is to
be an ASSU regular, especially
when there is an obvious choice
for a contact person."

Gilroy and Oram raised objec
tions to the difficulty outsiders
experience in their attempts to
understand or become involved
with the goings on of the ASSU.
"Actions like the one with this
pro and con statement demon
strate what a huge advantage
ASSU insiders have over [stu
dents at large]," Oram said.
"Based on this incident, it seems
the ASSU is saying, 'Yeah, you're
welcome to participate, but we're
going to manipulate the informa
tion as much as we can and make
use of the specialized knowledge
we have.' "
"It's not so much that people
are prevented from participating,
but it is certainly much more diffi
cult for outsiders to gain access"
to the resources insiders are
aware of, Gilroy said. "The ASSU
does not do as much as it should to
involve students."
Calling the role of the senate
chair "increasingly politicized,"
undergraduate senator Steve
Russell said, "I'm in the ASSU
and I'm often not involved. I don't
know how we hope to have stu
dents credibly involved when the
ASSU's own members are often
left uninformed."
