## New evidence on Unabomber Two people able to place Kaczynski in Sacramento area 
### 
HELENA, Mont. (AP) - As federal
agents searched for proof (hat Theodore
Kaczynski left his Montana cabin to mail
bombs, yesterday two people said they
had seen the hermit in Sacramento,
Calif. — in the area where the
Unabomber mailed his last four bombs.
Frank Hensley, a desk clerk at the
Royal Hotel, next door to the bus depot
in downtown Sacramento, said ho saw
Kaczynski in the neighborhood or stay
ing at the hotel almost annually during
the last five years. I le stayed at the hotel
two or three times, usually in the late
spring or summer, Hensley said.
"If it wasn't for all this, I'd be expect
ing to see him about now," I lensley said,
referring to Kaczynski's recent arrest.
At a Burger King restaurant next to
the Sacramento bus depot, manager
Mike Singh said he saw Kaczynski a few
times in recent years. On one occasion,
Kaczynski was carrying an armload of
books, Singh said.

"He said he was doing research and
he had a breakfast sandwich," he said.
"He looked like one of those bums who
come in in the morning and have a sand
wich and cup of coffee and walk out."
FBI spokesman George Grotz con
firmed that agents were investigating
whether Kaczynski had traveled to the
Sacramento area.
Federal investigators tracking
Kaczynski's movements are trying to
learn how the former math professor,
who had no visible means of support,
could get to other states where the
Unabomber's bombs were mailed or left.
They reportedly are checking
whether he rode buses to those states;
two bus line employees in Montana said
that Kaczynski was a passenger numer
ous times.
Kaczynski, 53, was taken into custody
at his cabin near Lincoln, Mont., on
Wednesday and is being held without
bail in a Helena jail. He has been charged

in federal court with possession of bomb
making materials.
The charge is intended to keep Kaczyn
ski in custody while investigators buUd a
case against him for the Unabom attacks
that killed three people and injured 23 in
nine states over the past 18 years.
Meanwhile, the painstaking search of
Kaczynski's 10-foot-by-12-foot cabin
continued yesterday. Grotz said investi
gators were combing the cabin and the
surrounding forest.
The cabin search already has turned
up a partially completed pipe bomb,
bomb-making chemicals and compo
nents, and notes on making bombs.
One law enforcement official said a
typewriter found in the cabin appears to
be the one the Unabomber used to type
his 35,000-word manifesto and letters.
Another said investigators defused a live
bomb in the cabin on Friday that they
believe was intended for someone in par
ticular.
