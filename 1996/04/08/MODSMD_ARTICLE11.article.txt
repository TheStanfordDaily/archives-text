NEW YORK (AP) — Oklahoma City bomb
ing suspect Timothy McVeigh says he's never
touched a bomb and wants to testify at his trial
so "jurors know me and not what they've
read," Time magazine reported.
"People have to realize that 90 percent of
the case that people think they have, it has all
been through non-verifiable leaks," McVeigh
was quoted as saying in the magazine's April
15 issue, due on newsstands tomorrow.
"And I think you would be surprised how
much those leaks are bogus. Especially
through eyewitnesses," he said.
The interview with McVeigh took place in a
federal prison in Oklahoma last month just
before he and fellow suspect Terry Nichols

were transferred to Colorado, where their trial
will be held.
In the interview, McVeigh maintained his
innocence in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the
Alfred P. Murrah federal building that killed
IGB people and injured more than 500.
McVeigh and Nichols face the death penalty if
convicted of federal murder and conspiracy
charges.
McVeigh said he has been falsely labeled a
"speed freak," "gun freak" and "loner," and
wants to testify at his trial "so that the jurors
know me and not what they've read."
Time said McVeigh refused to discuss specif
ic evidence or disclose where he was on the
morning of the bombing, saying, "we're saving

that for the trial."
But he did deny that he ever built a bomh.
"I've never had my hand on one. I used to
watch other people do it. I won't go into that,"
McVeigh said. "There were plastic soda bottles.
They would put vinegar and baking soda in and
screw t he cap on and it would burst."
The Los Angeles Times reported last year
that Nichols told federal authorities he and
McVeigh learned how to make bombs while
they were selling military surplus items at
gun shows around the country in 1994 and
1995.
Nichols' brother James Nichols announced
last week that he is working on a book that
would prove Terry's innocence.
