Local girl hopes to make history
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - She's 4-foot-2 and needs aluminum
extensions to help her reach the rudder pedals.
But size isn't slowing pilot Jessica Dubroff, a 7-year-old girl
from a coastal town south of here who hopes to make history by Hy
ing a Cessna 1778 Cardinal airplane across the country and back.
"I can't wait," said Jessica, a student pilot for just four months.
She plans to take off Wednesday from Half Moon Bay Airport
with her father, Lloyd Dubroff, in the back seat and her flight
instructor, Joe Reid, as co-pilot.
In order to set the record, she must do all the flying — about 40
to 50 hours during the 6,500 mile trip.
Brushing aside Easter tradition
SAN DIEGO (AP) — Witches, atheists and followers of the
Roman goddess Diana brushed aside tradition on Easter morning,
holding their own meeting at a city park where Christians have
held services for decades.
"Our purpose is being supportive of a pluralistic society where
the religion and the government are completely separate," said
Eugene Patnode-Sturtevant, a Unitarian Universalist.
