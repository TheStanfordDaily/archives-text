# Negotiator calls situation 'complicated'
## Standoff continues 
### 
JORDAN, Mont. (AP) - As
the standoff between anti-gov
ernment Freemen and FBI
agents neared the end of its sec
ond week yesterday, one of the
negotiators said he was not
optimistic about a quick resolu
tion.
"It's a very, very volatile situa
tion," said Montana state Rep.
Joe Quilici, who has met with
Freemen representatives twice,
along with three other legislators.
"Right now, I can't be optimistic.
It's so deep and complicated, it's
hard to get a handle."
Quilici said some minor
progress was made in negotia
tions Thursday and Friday, but
he would not discuss specifics.
"Things are better than they
were when we got over there," he
said in a telephone interview

from his home yesterday.
Quilici said Freemen leaders
and the FBI would decide when
and if talks would resume.
Easter services at St. John's
Lutheran Church included
prayers for the Freemen and the
law officers who have been sta
tioned outside their compound
since March 25.
The Rev. Helen Young asked
God to "turn (the Freemen) from
their ways, to the peace and
mercy you proclaim."
"These are just some of the
people who have contacted me in
the past two weeks offering their
prayers," Young said, holding up
two pages of typewritten names.
"People are calling us from all
over the country."
After days of activity, the com
pound was quiet yesterday.
