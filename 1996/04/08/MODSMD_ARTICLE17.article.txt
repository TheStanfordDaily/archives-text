Fac Sen made the wrong
choice in decision about
student representation

STUDENT INVOLVEMENT in
University governance is a
firmly established tradition at
Stanford. On bodies ranging from
the Board of Trustees, Stanford's
most powerful policy body, to the
Committee of 15, the only group
with the ability to make changes to
Stanford's judicial procedures, stu
dent committee members provide
their unique viewpoints on impor
tant issues.
The Faculty Senate made a dis
turbing change, however, when it
voted to remove a provision for stu
dent membership from the new
charge to the Planning and Policy
Board. By removing the proposed —
to place one graduate student and
one undergraduate on the commit
tee — the senate has sent a message
to the entire student body that the
faculty believes them to be irrespon
sible and unable to maintain confi
dentiality.
In a University dedicated to liber
al education and values, this is a
paradox. If policies are made which
will affect students, there should be
student input in these decisions.
The previous Planning and Policy
Board — having fulfilled its charge
and dissolved — recently issued a
report, titled "Planning in an Era of
Change," which laid down guidelines
for the University's future. Among
the report's recommendations were
suggestions about merging small
departments, the structure of doc
toral programs and the enrichment
of undergraduate education.
It is obvious that those issues —
and others the board discussed
under its previous three-year charge
— are relevant to students. Students
are invovled with virtually all com
mittees and boards which affedt stu
dent concerns; there is no reason
why the Planning and Policy Board

should be any different.
Faculty members argued that stu
dents should be excluded because
"information of an extremely sensi
tive nature" would be discussed.
Without giving specifics as to what
"sensitive" information is, the facul
ty has sent the message that there
are no cases in which students can be
trusted to maintain confidentiality.
This is a ludicrous insinuation.
The meetings of the Board of
Trustees tire all closed, as are judicial
procedures involving violations of
the Honor Code — all areas in which
students are involved and have
proven that they can respect the
integrity of these processes.
The original charge for the board
did contain a provision for excluding
students from confidential matters
"on rare occasions." Although doing
so would have been a step away from
full student representation, and an
obstacle to students serving on com
mittees to the best of their abilities,
student representation was main
tained, with a provision for closed
door sessions in extreme cases.
Not only is it a violation of princi
ple to remove the student members
from the committee, but it is also a
violation of the Faculty Senate's own
rules. The Rules of the Senate of the
Academic Council, in Section VI,
part 5, state that "Wherever possi
ble, the appointment of student
members shall be made."
The underlying message of
including student representatives is
clear: that students are active partic
ipants in their education. By voting
to not have students on the Planning
and Policy Board, the senate has said
that their concerns are essentially
irrelevant.
The faculty senate has implied
through its actions that students are
incapable of thoughtful and respon
sibile representation on University
bodies. If its members do in fact
believe otherwise — that is, if they do
have respect for their students, not
the simple contempt suggested by
Thursday's vote — they must recon
sider their action and pass a resolu
tion placing student representatives
on the Planning and Policy Board.
