## Admissions of superiority 
### 
MY BROTHER recently received his
rejection letter from Stanford.
My family was disappointed, but
not terribly surprised. As captain of two
varsity sports and with SAT scores push
ing the 1500 mark, he never had a legiti
mate shot at gaining admission. His sta
tus as a National Merit Scholar undoubt
edly counted against him, too.
With test scores pushing double-digits,
I had been — admittedly — a sure thing.
Each year the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions releases statistics relevant to
the demography of the applicant pool. Eor
instance, The Daily revealed last week
that 60 percent — the overwhelming
majority — of applicants with credentials
similar to my brother's were denied the
privilege of a Stanford education. At the
same time, more than half of the appli
cants who boasted a perfect 4.0 CPA also
were also rejected.
We are all familiar with these figures
because they're so shocking and so often
quoted. We read them in the paper, or
hear President Casper list them in his
welcome address, then we commit them
to memory so we can boast of our school's
excellence to friends at other universities.
Stanford uses this information, it
seems, to stroke the egos of those who
have been accepted. It's a cross between
self-affirmation and blatant propaganda.
What a power trip it must be to deny
admission to an applicant who has many
times the intellectual prowess of one's

own self.
The math is simple. The University
describes the sterling qualifications of
those applicants who did not receive letters
of acceptance in order to emphasize the
extraordinary excellence of those who did.
At the center of this equation is the Office
of Undergraduate Admissions, which ulti
mately decides who gets placed in the first
group and who gets placed in the second.
The equation holds true in theory.
Those of us who received admission
should be inherently "better" than those
who didn't. Until this year, I liked reading
the outrageous numbers that the Univer
sity fed the press. The higher the SAT
scores of those who got rejected, the bet
ter I felt. I still remember one unlucky
chap with a 1560 and a spot on his high
school track team; to his misfortune,
there was no room at the inn. I had
checked in five minutes earlier.
This appealed to me, the notion that I
possessed something this fellow clearly
did not. What was it? I have no clue. But
in his infinite and indelible wisdom Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions and Finan
cial Aids James Montoya had recognized
my superiority over this one-dimensional
drone.
But now these statistics and anecdotes
are beginning to annoy me. I've watched
half a dozen people I know very well —
including my best friend and my own
brother — receive letters of rejection
from Stanford. All have been tremen

dously woll-roundcd and excellent at
whatever they undertake. Academically,
each one easily deserves to attend a first
rate institution, far more than I ever did.
Yet, once again I'm being told that I'm
more qualified than any one of them.
Worse yet, I believe it. I got in, of course;
they didn't.
I sat next to a businessman on a flight
home during my freshman year. He saw
my CIV books and asked where I went to
school. When I told him, he replied,
"Stanford is a great school. Congratula
tions." He was quiet for a moment, then
began again. "All my friends who went
there became pompous assholes. I think
the prestige of the school instilled that in
them."
Surprised, I listened, but gave his
words little credence. In a sense, however,
it seems he was right. When you arrive at
Stanford, you ask, "How did I get in
here?" Two years later, you look at the
same people and wonder, "How did they
get in here?"
This superiority complex pervades
much of the school. In the end, however,
I'm afraid that the distinction between
those of us who got in and those of who
didn't is not as significant as we'd like to
believe.
