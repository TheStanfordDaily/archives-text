Fac Sen wrong to keep students off planning board

WE, THE UNDERSIGNED, greet
with dismay the news that the
Faculty Senate has voted to
remove the student representation from
the new charter for the Planning and Poli
cy Board. This decision, made at Thurs
day's senate meeting, contradicts the long
standing and uniquely progressive attitude
of the University and faculty toward stu
dent participation in the governance of
Stanford. The board will, we feel, be less
ened by the silencing of the student voice.
More sad and frightening, however, is the
precedent set and the message apparently
intended; to wit, that students are undesir
able and unqualified to sit on University
committees, and that students have no
legitimate role in fostering the Universi
ty's vision of its own future.
Faculty have special experience and spe
cial competencies which students — no
matter how dedicated — cannot duplicate.
However, as the future members of the
academy, students too have a unique per
spective on the shape of the years to come,
for both the University and society as a
whole. Students also have unique insights
and knowledge about the functioning of
Stanford and its present condition. Faculty

are removed in time from the day-to-day
concerns of students, from the community
fostered in residences and dining halls,
from the pulse and interests of the student
body. Students, perforce, live within this
aspect of the University — an aspect as
vital and as significant to Stanford's future
as the world of research and academe.
By excluding students from a role in
deliberations on the vision of the Universi
ty's future, the senate has cut off a vibrant
and deeply concerned voice. By offering
only nebulous reasons for this exclusion,
the senate has fostered an impression that
it views the students not as rational,
mature adults, but as mere consumers of
the University's "product" — or, worse, as
simple packages of the University's repu
tation.
The sponsors of this move have raised
only vague concerns over issues of confi
dentiality and reliability; they have failed
to give specific and unique examples to
indicate why this is of special concern to
the board. As it stands, students serve on
scores of University committees and dis
charge their duty with intelligence and
honor. Students even serve on the sub
committees of the Board of Trustees, the

ultimate governing body of the University.
Those in the senate who oppose student
representation on the Planning and Policy
Board owe it to the students — and to the
University community at large — to
explain exactly what business will be con
ducted by the board that requires a more
stringent guarantee than the business of
the Board of Trustees. That explanation
was not offered at the senate meeting, nor
since.
Instead, certain members of the senate
voiced a hazy woriy that the presence of
students would compromise the congenial
ity of the Planning and Policy Board —
that faculty members would not feel com
pletely comfortable discussing controver
sial topics with students present. Yet we
wonder: Do these faculty feel that students
are intrinsically fractious and their partici
pation inherently deleterious? If this accu
rately represents the view of the faculty,
we fear it signals a change in the attitude
of the faculty toward the students, and in
fact harbingers a major shift in the philos
ophy of this University.
We must remember that the University
is a community. It is not just the students.
It is not just the faculty. Without the lat-

ter, the former would wither — but the
inverse is true as well. Without students,
the University cannot exist. Is not the pri
mary mission of a university to educate?
We as students recognize — indeed,
embrace — the truism that the University
must be viewed from both sides of the
desk. It is classroom and residence, library
and stadium, laboratory and dining hall
... faculty and students.
To exclude students from these deliber
ations, to silence a strong and sweet voice,
weakens the purpose of the Policy and
Planning Board and, ultimately, diminish
es the University. We urge the senate to
reconsider its motion, and to add once
more student representation to the board.
