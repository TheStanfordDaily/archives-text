## Life after Egypt: Applying to be the Unabomber 
### 
"In every generation it is one's duty to
regard himself as though he, personally,
had gone out from Egypt."
— The Passover Haggadah
THAT LINE NEVER meant anything
to me, no matter how many times we
sang it. Seder after seder after seder.
Please, as if'l would have had anything to do
with that ordeal. An Exodus? I hate moving.
And what to pack? What shoes to take?
Sneakers don't do so well in the sand, and
Birkenstocks, well, they're just a little too
trendy, even if they do make comfortable
desertware.
No, the modern Jew is not the same crea
ture as the biblical one. Same religion, dif
ferent people — we could never understand
one another. Imagine:
"Here, try this soup," offers my aunt Ida.
Answers a man named Habuakkuk: "If
it's lentils, I'll sell you my birthright for a
mouthful."
"It's matzah ball. Not as good as my
mother used to make, but not so bad either.
Here, take."
"This is miraculous. The hand of God
must reside by you."

"Please, my husband's hand barely
resides by me. It's nothing, really — I used
the mix, from a box. Maybe some dill."
"Nay, I will make here an altar for the
Lord, and I will sacrifice two kids and a
sheaf of barley..."
"Eeh, if you're gonna be knockin' off
kids, here, take mine! Davey does nothing
but watch TV all day, and his brother's no
better. Do you know how badly he did on the
PSATs? Here, eat some more."
(Assembling an altar out of patio furni
ture and doilies.) "I will sing a Psalm unto
the Lord ..."
"Not necessary, but you could help clear
the table."
Yup, Jews have evolved over the cen
turies. And so whenever I read the reminis
cent ramblings of the Sages of the sixth and
seventh centuries in the Passover prayer
guide, especially this part about how all men
should identify with that wacky tribal
troupe called the Hebrews, I never thought
anyone took them seriously — even without
the gendered language. If nothing else, I
knew they weren't talking to me.
Until now, that is.
I am speaking, of course, about gradua

tion, again. Yes, I know this has been my
theme for a few weeks now. Put despite
what you naive non-pre-med non-seniors
might believe about the undergraduate
hereafter, it is not a pretty thing. Leaving
college without any definitive plans ... it's
like going outlet shopping with only 10
bucks: Everything you ever wanted is in
front of you, but your options are limited
and you can only pick one thing.
Graduation is a painful set of choices; the
insecurity involved will make the playing of
"Pomp and Circumstance" a Prozac
moment for more than a few of us. And I'm
gonna dwell on it until its over.
So, bearing all this graduation angst in
mind, it comes as little surprise that I
should feel a sudden kinship with the con
cept of the Exodus: Come this June I'll be
exiting the Egypt of Academia. Shedding
the yoke of papers and policy classes. No
longer heeding the taskmaster's charge,
"Bring those 10 to 12 pagers to my office by
4:15 sharp. And in 12-point Times, you
mongrel — none of this Helvetica crap."
Finally getting out of what I was supposed
to have resented all along.
But the thing is I don't wanna go. Who

am I kidding? me live on in this Coco
Puff dreamworld of instant gratification
and short-term goals. Hail the fleshpots of
Egypt! Please, sir, I want some more.
I don't know where else to go. What to do
after Egypt? I can't wander in the desert
forever — I'll starve, and besides, I burn
easily.
Where to turn? Show me the way to
Sinai and I'll await a revelation at its foot.
Find me the address of the Land of Canaan
and I'll send my resume there.
Ixx)k at mo: I'm directionless. I'm pan
icking I'm doing that thing the rabbis were
talking about where I feel as if I, personally,
had gone out of Egypt.
And the only clue I have as to what hap
pens next is The Fates repeated hints that I
might not be an employed writer right
away. Which is a sizable problem since my
only other life's ambition is to be a super
hero. Unfortunately, I don't have the upper
body strength for that line of work.
So I'm thinking, now, that maybe I could
become a super-villain instead. After all, the
Unabomber was just caught — there is an
opening.
Why not? I could grow a mustache. Polish

up on my electrical wiring skills and Marx
ism and I've got myself one hell of a new
trade. I could be like him: IJve in a hut with
no water or electricity with my mustache
and some Thorazine while fashioning bombs
and manifestos that will change the world —
or at least airport security measures.
Of course, I'd have to add my own per
sonal flair to the job — make it mine, as it
were. A yarmulke instead of a hood maybe.
A studio apartment in an Upper West Side
brownstone instead of a Montana cabin.
And instead of economic professors I could
bomb all the graduate admission depart
ments that turned me down.
Sure, I'll just fax my resume over to ol'
Teddy Kaczynski at the Ixnvis and Clark
County jail in Helena, Montana, shmooze
him on the phone, get flown into to some
militia's headquarters in Idaho for a second
round interview and — Poof. — a career
with more integrity than consulting.
It might not be what the rabbis intended,
but at least I'll know what I'm doing next
year.
