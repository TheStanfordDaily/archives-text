## Men's tennis still can't solve top-ranked UCLA Cardinal loses 4-3 thriller, rebounds to beat USC 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
By splitting two very close match
es at Stanford Tennis Stadium this
weekend, the Stanford men's tennis
team (16-2, 4-1 in the Six-Pac) de
fended its No. 2 ranking but failed to
put to rest doubts about its ability to
defend its 1995 NCAA champi
onship.
On Friday, a standing-room only
crowd of 1,700 saw the Cardinal drop
a 4-3 decision to undefeated and No.
1-ranked UCIA. On Saturday, Stan
ford prevailed 5-2 over No. 9-ranked
USC, despite being nearly upset in
the closing stages of the match.
The Bruins, who are now respon
sible for both of Stanford's losses
this season, were outplayed in dou
bles but seized control quickly in sin
gles, where a late Cardinal comeback
fell just short.
"I was proud we even got back
into the match," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould.
Trailing 3-2, the Cardinal's fate

hinged on the outcome of two third
set tiebreaks being played concur
rently in No. 1 and No. 6 singles. In
the No. 6 position, No. 54-ranked se
nior Ricky Becker fought off six
match points — including two in the
tiebreak — before putting away
UCLA's Vincent Allegro, 6-2, 5-7, 7-
6 (11-9) to tie the score at 3-3. No
more than 30 seconds later, howev
er, UCIA's Justin Gimelstob aced
Jeff Salzenstein to close out the
Bruin victory, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-4).
The No. 3-ranked Gimelstob
played well but also benefited from a
subpar performance by the No. 5-
ranked Salzenstein, who failed to
convert two match point opportuni
ties against Gimelstob's serve in the
12th game of the final set. On his
first chance, Salzenstein did not re
turn the first serve deep enough, and
Gimelstob took aire of it with a blis
tering forehand to the open court.
On his second crack at the match,
the senior captain attacked the net
off of Gimelstob's second serve, but
despite good positioning, couldn't

quite stick a volley down the line.
The Bruin sophomore closed in on
the ball and lifted a topspin lob win
ner. It was a sign of things to come.
"Before (losing the two match
points], I was riding a big wave of
momentum," Salzenstein said. "I
was killing him to get to 15-40 in that
game. There was about a five-to-10
minute interval where I really
thought he didn't think he could win
the match. But you've got to put
away the good players. Anytime you
can come out from the grave like he
did, it lifts your spirits."
Stanford head coach Dick Gould
said Salzenstein "put himself in a po
sition to win the match without play
ing especially well," and added that
Salzenstein's serve had improved
from "a C-minus earlier in the week
to a B against UCIA."
"Jeffs serving game made his
volleying tentative, and when Jeff
didn't do enough with his volleys,
Gimelstob was able to run them

Gimelstob, who won liLs first
round U.S. Open men's singles
match last summer as well as sever
al major championships in the ju
niors, said of his more recent victory:
"This is special because I get to share
it with my team, and we haven't won
here at Stanford in 10 years."
After a doubles sweep highlighted
by Jim Thomas and Paul Goldstein's
8-4 upset of the No. 1-ranked Bruin
duo of Gimelstob and Srdjan
Muskatirovic, Ryan Wolters pushed
the lead to 2-0 with a 6-1,6-3 defeat of
Heath Montgomery in No. 4 singles.
The Cardinal freshman said he felt
no p;iin from his recent ftxit injury.
Thereafter, though, things fell
apart quickly for the Cardinal. Ju
nior Grant Elliott dropped a 6-3,6-1
decision to his nemesis, No. 87-
ranked Matt Breen, who defeated
Elliott the last time UCLA visited
Stanford.
Next, UCLA's No. 28-ranked
Srdjan Muskatirovic thoroughly
outplayed No. 53-ranked senior Jim
Thomas en route to a 6-2,6-2 victory
in No. 2 singles.
"Muskatirovic served well and
didn't allow me many chances,"
Thomas said, "but a large part of the
outcome was me. I wasn't playing
aggressively, I wasn't ever in a
rhythm, mid I wasn't trying to find a
way to win. I wasjust out there kind
of playing."
In the first three-set match com
pleted, UCI-A's No. 33-ranked Eric
Taino defeated No. 27-ranked Stan
ford sophomore Paul Goldstein, (J-1,
3-6,6-1.
The outcome of Saturday's
match against USC was in many
ways the reverse of the result from
the previous day. Though Stanford
again gained the doubles [wiint.
this time by winning two of three
matches — this time it was the Car
dinal that jumped ahead in singles,
only to hold on for dear life in the last
two matches of t he day.
Leading 3-2, Stanford needed
just one victory at either No. 2 or No.
3 singles, but found itself down a
break in the third set of each of those
matches.
Goldstein was the first Cardinal
to get the break back and the first to
win his match, a backcourters' bat
tle against No. 56-ranked Manny
Ramirez.
"Early in the third set, |assistant
coach John Whitlinger] came over

and said some things that helped my
game," Goldstein said. "My oppo
nent was controlling the points. 1
needed to set the tone and apply a lit
tle pressure."
Goldstein began attacking the
net more frequently, resulting in
four straight games for him, and a
match-clinching 7-6 (7-5), 2-6, 6-4
victory for his team.
Thomas ended up winning his
match against No. 91-ranked Adam
I J eterson, 6-2,3-6,7-6 (7-4), who had
beaten Thomas in each of their five
previous meetings. Meanwhile, El
liott racked up an early 6-2, 7-5 de

his matches by defeating Fernando

when Lukas Hovorka defeated
Wolters 2-6, 6-1, 6-4. Salzenstein
then succumbed to No. 2-ranked
Cecil Mamiit, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4).
The ups and downs of this week
end left Gould questioning his
team's pedigree.
"1 thought we played tentatively,
waiting for the other guys to lose,
and we won't be a championship
team if we play like that," Gould
said. "1 didn't like our body language
when we got down, our heads
would go down and our shoulders
would drool)."

Freshman Ryan Wolters winds up for a backstroke during his 6-1, 6-
3 win over UCLA's Heath Montgomery on Friday.
By splitting two very close match
es at Stanford Tennis Stadium this
weekend, the Stanford men's tennis
team (16-2, 4-1 in the Six-Pac) de
fended its No. 2 ranking but failed to
put to rest doubts about its ability to
defend its 1995 NCAA champi
onship.
On Friday, a standing-room only
crowd of 1,700 saw the Cardinal drop
a 4-3 decision to undefeated and No.
1-ranked UCIA. On Saturday, Stan
ford prevailed 5-2 over No. 9-ranked
USC, despite being nearly upset in
the closing stages of the match.
The Bruins, who are now respon
sible for both of Stanford's losses
this season, were outplayed in dou
bles but seized control quickly in sin
gles, where a late Cardinal comeback
fell just short.
"I was proud we even got back
into the match," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould.
Trailing 3-2, the Cardinal's fate

hinged on the outcome of two third
set tiebreaks being played concur
rently in No. 1 and No. 6 singles. In
the No. 6 position, No. 54-ranked se
nior Ricky Becker fought off six
match points — including two in the
tiebreak — before putting away
UCLA's Vincent Allegro, 6-2, 5-7, 7-
6 (11-9) to tie the score at 3-3. No
more than 30 seconds later, howev
er, UCIA's Justin Gimelstob aced
Jeff Salzenstein to close out the
Bruin victory, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-4).
The No. 3-ranked Gimelstob
played well but also benefited from a
subpar performance by the No. 5-
ranked Salzenstein, who failed to
convert two match point opportuni
ties against Gimelstob's serve in the
12th game of the final set. On his
first chance, Salzenstein did not re
turn the first serve deep enough, and
Gimelstob took aire of it with a blis
tering forehand to the open court.
On his second crack at the match,
the senior captain attacked the net
off of Gimelstob's second serve, but
despite good positioning, couldn't

quite stick a volley down the line.
The Bruin sophomore closed in on
the ball and lifted a topspin lob win
ner. It was a sign of things to come.
"Before (losing the two match
points], I was riding a big wave of
momentum," Salzenstein said. "I
was killing him to get to 15-40 in that
game. There was about a five-to-10
minute interval where I really
thought he didn't think he could win
the match. But you've got to put
away the good players. Anytime you
can come out from the grave like he
did, it lifts your spirits."
Stanford head coach Dick Gould
said Salzenstein "put himself in a po
sition to win the match without play
ing especially well," and added that
Salzenstein's serve had improved
from "a C-minus earlier in the week
to a B against UCIA."
"Jeffs serving game made his
volleying tentative, and when Jeff
didn't do enough with his volleys,
Gimelstob was able to run them

Senior Jim Thomas strokes a backhand in his 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 (4) win over USC's Adam Peterson on Satur
day. Thomas fell to UCLA's Srdjan Muskatirovic in straight sets on Friday.
down," Gould said.
Gimelstob, who won liLs first
round U.S. Open men's singles
match last summer as well as sever
al major championships in the ju
niors, said of his more recent victory:
"This is special because I get to share
it with my team, and we haven't won
here at Stanford in 10 years."
After a doubles sweep highlighted
by Jim Thomas and Paul Goldstein's
8-4 upset of the No. 1-ranked Bruin
duo of Gimelstob and Srdjan
Muskatirovic, Ryan Wolters pushed
the lead to 2-0 with a 6-1,6-3 defeat of
Heath Montgomery in No. 4 singles.
The Cardinal freshman said he felt
no p;iin from his recent ftxit injury.
Thereafter, though, things fell
apart quickly for the Cardinal. Ju
nior Grant Elliott dropped a 6-3,6-1
decision to his nemesis, No. 87-
ranked Matt Breen, who defeated
Elliott the last time UCLA visited
Stanford.
Next, UCLA's No. 28-ranked
Srdjan Muskatirovic thoroughly
outplayed No. 53-ranked senior Jim
Thomas en route to a 6-2,6-2 victory
in No. 2 singles.
"Muskatirovic served well and
didn't allow me many chances,"
Thomas said, "but a large part of the
outcome was me. I wasn't playing
aggressively, I wasn't ever in a
rhythm, mid I wasn't trying to find a
way to win. I wasjust out there kind
of playing."
In the first three-set match com
pleted, UCI-A's No. 33-ranked Eric
Taino defeated No. 27-ranked Stan
ford sophomore Paul Goldstein, (J-1,
3-6,6-1.
The outcome of Saturday's
match against USC was in many
ways the reverse of the result from
the previous day. Though Stanford
again gained the doubles [wiint.
this time by winning two of three
matches — this time it was the Car
dinal that jumped ahead in singles,
only to hold on for dear life in the last
two matches of t he day.
Leading 3-2, Stanford needed
just one victory at either No. 2 or No.
3 singles, but found itself down a
break in the third set of each of those
matches.
Goldstein was the first Cardinal
to get the break back and the first to
win his match, a backcourters' bat
tle against No. 56-ranked Manny
Ramirez.
"Early in the third set, |assistant
coach John Whitlinger] came over

and said some things that helped my
game," Goldstein said. "My oppo
nent was controlling the points. 1
needed to set the tone and apply a lit
tle pressure."
Goldstein began attacking the
net more frequently, resulting in
four straight games for him, and a
match-clinching 7-6 (7-5), 2-6, 6-4
victory for his team.
Thomas ended up winning his
match against No. 91-ranked Adam
I J eterson, 6-2,3-6,7-6 (7-4), who had
beaten Thomas in each of their five
previous meetings. Meanwhile, El
liott racked up an early 6-2, 7-5 de
feat of Reid Slattery, and Becker lx*-
came the only Cardinal to win both

his matches by defeating Fernando
