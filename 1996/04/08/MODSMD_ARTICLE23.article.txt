## Men's tennis still can't solve top-ranked UCLA Cardinal loses 4-3 thriller, rebounds to beat USC 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
By splitting two very close match
es at Stanford Tennis Stadium this
weekend, the Stanford men's tennis
team (16-2, 4-1 in the Six-Pac) de
fended its No. 2 ranking but failed to
put to rest doubts about its ability to
defend its 1995 NCAA champi
onship.
On Friday, a standing-room only
crowd of 1,700 saw the Cardinal drop
a 4-3 decision to undefeated and No.
1-ranked UCIA. On Saturday, Stan
ford prevailed 5-2 over No. 9-ranked
USC, despite being nearly upset in
the closing stages of the match.
The Bruins, who are now respon
sible for both of Stanford's losses
this season, were outplayed in dou
bles but seized control quickly in sin
gles, where a late Cardinal comeback
fell just short.
"I was proud we even got back
into the match," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould.
Trailing 3-2, the Cardinal's fate

hinged on the outcome of two third
set tiebreaks being played concur
rently in No. 1 and No. 6 singles. In
the No. 6 position, No. 54-ranked se
nior Ricky Becker fought off six
match points — including two in the
tiebreak — before putting away
UCLA's Vincent Allegro, 6-2, 5-7, 7-
6 (11-9) to tie the score at 3-3. No
more than 30 seconds later, howev
er, UCIA's Justin Gimelstob aced
Jeff Salzenstein to close out the
Bruin victory, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-4).
The No. 3-ranked Gimelstob
played well but also benefited from a
subpar performance by the No. 5-
ranked Salzenstein, who failed to
convert two match point opportuni
ties against Gimelstob's serve in the
12th game of the final set. On his
first chance, Salzenstein did not re
turn the first serve deep enough, and
Gimelstob took aire of it with a blis
tering forehand to the open court.
On his second crack at the match,
the senior captain attacked the net
off of Gimelstob's second serve, but
despite good positioning, couldn't

quite stick a volley down the line.
The Bruin sophomore closed in on
the ball and lifted a topspin lob win
ner. It was a sign of things to come.
"Before (losing the two match
points], I was riding a big wave of
momentum," Salzenstein said. "I
was killing him to get to 15-40 in that
game. There was about a five-to-10
minute interval where I really
thought he didn't think he could win
the match. But you've got to put
away the good players. Anytime you
can come out from the grave like he
did, it lifts your spirits."
Stanford head coach Dick Gould
said Salzenstein "put himself in a po
sition to win the match without play
ing especially well," and added that
Salzenstein's serve had improved
from "a C-minus earlier in the week
to a B against UCIA."
"Jeffs serving game made his
volleying tentative, and when Jeff
didn't do enough with his volleys,
Gimelstob was able to run them
