# Say hello to Justin Gimelstob
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
Coaches call him the best player
in college tennis. Fans call him the
worst-mannered. Some just call him
Justin Gimelstob.
To the extent that a collegiate
player has left his heart on the court
and his impression on spectators,
Gimelstob may be second only to
John McEnroe.
Like Johnny Mac, Gimelstob
came out West from the New York /
New Jersey area, a region known for
producing animated tennis players.
But after watching the native of
Roseland, N.J., defeat Stanford's
Jeff Salzenstein Friday, one gets the
feeling that even a hardened East
erner would gawk at Gimelstob's on
court antics.
Said Salzenstein: "Justin is a
good kid off the court â€” not a jerk at
all. On the court, it might be debat
able."
Those who ventured to Stanford
Tennis Stadium three days ago wit
nessed a phenomenal display of ten
nis acumen by the Bruin sophomore.
He showed why over the past year he
has been defeating older and more

experienced players on the ATP
Tour, why as a collegian he is ranked
293 in the world, and why he ought
to turn pro at the end of the academ
ic year.
But he also showed a seedier side,
thanks in part to some provocation
from the vocal, sellout crowd.
Trailing 5-4 in the second set, for
example, Gimelstob faced a crucial
set point against his serve. He un
loaded a solid approach into the cor
ner, but was passed by a remarkable
crosscourt backhand that appeared
to catch the line. Gimelstob immedi
ately called the ball out. Salzenstein,
who admitted that "in pressure situ
ations, the lines are sometimes seen
as being out," appealed to the chair
umpire. The overrule came swiftly.
Game and set, Stanford.
But before the third set could
commence, the partisan crowd made
Gimelstob feel worse than a witch in
Salem. The boos rained down, and so
did the taunts: "Maybe you'd get
that call in UCLA!" and "Not here,
not at Stanford, Gimelstob!"
After a shanked backhand by
Gimelstob allowed Salzenstein to
hold serve in the next game, the
Bruin had had enough. He turned to

the ballgirl and motioned for a ball,
presumably to practice a backhand
before sitting down for the
changeover. The ballgirl was not
paying attention. "Gimme the
fuckin' ball now!" he yelled. Ball in
hand, he cranked a backhand into
the opposite court, then sat down.
Yet it was Gimelstob who had the
last laugh, clinching the victory for
his team with mature, error-free
play in the third-set tiebreak. After
celebrating with his teammates, he
turned in the direction of the most
vocal Cardinal fans, pointed at them,
and proceeded to raise his clenched
fist above his head and punch his op
posite palm in a belligerent display of
emotion.
Of course, there were no fights
and eveiyone, even the disappointed
Cardinal faithful, had a great time. It
was college tennis at its best, filled
with emotion from all the partici
pants, athlete and fan alike. And in
the end, Gimelstob was a true
sportsman.
"There's nothing to say to the
Stanford fans," Gimelstob said.
"They have a great tradition here.
The fans get into it. They do a great
job."
