# Women's tennis keeps on truckin'
## Second-ranked Cardinal records sweep of No. 6 UCLA, No. 21 USC 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
It had upset written all over it, but the No. 2-
ranked Stanford women's tennis team turned
a slow start into a two-match sweep of Pacific
10 Conference rivals UCLA and USC this
weekend, winning both matches by a 6-2 mar
gin.
On Friday against the sixth-ranked Bruins
(15-4 overall, 4-3 Pac-10 Southern Division),
the Cardinal (17-1,5-0) dropped five of the first
six sets in singles competition, as sophomore
Julie Scott was the only Stanford competitor to
start favorably. Scott (15-1) downed Brandy
Freudenberg in the No. 5 match, 6-2, 6-4, but
the Cardinal could not find its usual success
elsewhere.
Redshirt senior Amy Chiminello, currently
tops on the Cardinal roster with a 16-1 record,
found herself down a set to Bruin Jody Anglin.

Stanford sophomore Ania Bleszynski, squar
ing off against defending NCAA singles cham
pion Keri Phebus, also lost in a tight first set.
"For a while it looked pretty bleak," said
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan. "It
looked like we might only win two matches."
But the Cardinal bounced back. Chiminello
fought off two match points in the No. 6 match
to defeat Anglin, 1-6, 6-1, 7-5. Bleszynski (14-
4) also denied Phebus a match point in the
third set and won arguably the biggest match
of her career, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6.
"We won two matches in which we were
down match points and that is rather extraor
dinary," Brennan said.
"That was a great win for Ania," he added.
"A huge hurdle for her to actually break
through and beat one of the top players in the
country. She's coming into her own. The faith
that I had in her is being fulfilled. She's actual
ly outperforming what I thought she could do

with these heroic comebacks. I didn't know she
had that in her. I just knew she was damn
good."
Bleszynski had some extra motivation,
though, due in large part to a Daily Bruin arti
cle which claimed that Stanford's weaknesses
were at the top of the lineup, where Bleszynski
plays in both singles and doubles.
"I think she found some extra motivation,"
Brennan said. "Ania took exception to that and
I think that's when she plays her best. She's
got a lot of pride and I think that kind of got
under her skin a little bit."
Redshirt senior Kim Shasby (9-5) also
dropped her first set, but rebounded to give the
Cardinal its fourth point of the day with a 6-7,
6-2, 6-4 victory.
"So we went into the doubles up 4-2 rather
than down 4-2 or even 5-1," said Brennan. "We
pot it turned around pretty good.
We're a senior team. We should
have some poise and we did."
UCLA earned its two points on
the No. 2 and No. 3 courts. Bruin
senior Paige Yaroshuk defeated
junior Katie Schlukebir (13-4) by
a 7-5, 6-2 score and junior Sandra
De Silva (12-4) lost in straight sets
to Stephanie Chi, 6-4, 6-1.
With the lead secure, the Cardi
nal went on to take two doubles
matches relatively quickly. In a
clash of two of the top doubles
teams in the nation, the third
ranked duo of Bleszynski and
Schlukebir (7-3) blew away the
No. 4 tandem of Phebus and
Yaroshuk in a laugher, 6-1,6-1.
The No. 3 squad for the Cardi
nal, junior Emily Burt and senior
Beth Berris (4-0), also earned a
straight set victory, defeating Ani
cia Mendez and Kelly Rudolph, 6-
1,7-6.
The No. 2 doubles match was
suspended in the third set, ending
the match at 6-2 in favor of Stan
ford.
On Saturday afternoon the
Cardinal ran its winning streak to
eight with a 6-2 win over the No.
21-ranked Trojans. The Cardinal
has now strung together 19 con
secutive Pac-10 wins, dating back
to the 1994 season.
Stanford took no chances

against USC, jumping out to a
quick start by taking five of the six
singles matches. Bleszynski,
Schlukebir, Shasby, Scott and
Chiminello all won in straight
sets. De Silva was the only loser,
dropping her match to IJSC's
Karolina Baklarova, 6-4,6-2.
In doubles, Bleszynski and
Schlukebir clinched the victory
with another strong performance,
rolling over Pam Trump and Ditta
Huber, 6-1, 7-5. Baklarova and
Suzanne Italiano earned a three
set victory over Shasby and Scott
after the match had been decided,
and the third doubles match was

suspended.
Stanford has now seen each of
its Pac-10 opponents at least once
and has posted a 6-0 record against
those teams. Five conference
matches remain, two on the road in
Arizona and three at home against
California, UCLA and USC.
"I think we have an advantage
in the sense that we know what's
out there," said Brennan of the
upcoming matches. "There's not
going to be any surprises, al
though there could always be
something. It's kind of nice to
know that we've been through it
already."
