# Baseball takes two of three from ASU
## Schaeffer's homers lift the Cardinal to 10-6 win Saturday 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
In splitting its first two meetings
with Arizona State, the Stanford
baseball team (23-12 overall, 10-8
in the Pacific 10 Southern Division)
worked hard to manufacture its
runs in a 4-2 win Thursday and a 7-
6 extra-inning loss on Friday.
Saturday afternoon, though,
catcher Jon Schaeffer put runs on
the board the quick way, homering
twice off Sun Devil starter Kaipo
Spenser (3-5) in the Cardinal's 10-6
victory. Schaeffer had two-run
shots in both the first and fourth
innings. Schaeffer's five home runs
rank second on the team to A. J.
Hinch's nine.
"I felt great up there today,"
Schaeffer said. "I was first-pitch
swinging all three times against

ranked Cardinal won two of three this weekend to improve to 23-12.
Spenser, just trying to hit the ball
hard."
Schaeffer, who began the season
;is the Cardinal's designated hitter,
moved behind the plate when
Hinch injured his throwing shoul
der diving back into first base sever
al weeks ago.
"Those were two big swings for
us," said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess of SchaefTer's two bombs.
"That's four runs with two swings
of the bat — that was the key."
Marquess was also pleased by
the performance of freshman start
ing pitcher Chad I lutchinson.
Hutchinson (4-1) picked up his
fourth consecutive win, allowing 10
hits and five earned runs in 6 2/3 in
nings of' work. The right-hander
kept the Arizona State lineup off
balance all day, striking out three
Sun Devils looking (five total) and
allowingjust two bases on balls.
"I was getting t he curve over for
strikes for the first time this year,"
Hutchinson said. "My slider was
breaking real nice but I couldn't get
it over — that's really been my

punch-out pitch, but I didn't have it
with me today."
Aft ( *r Arizona State (23-15, 7-11
in the Six I'ac) scored a run in the
second inning without the benefit
of a clean hit, Hutchinson kept his
focus and worked into the seventh
inning for tho third consecutive
start.
In the second inning, Hutchin
son retired leadoff man Robbie Kent
and induced a seemingly harmless
infield pop-up from the next batter,
Andrew Beinbrink. Hut the ball
dropped to the infield grass between
Stanford third baseman Josh
Hochgesang and shortstop Eric
Sees, and a sacrifice bunt by Sun
Devil catcher Cody McKay ad
vanced Beinbrink to second base.
Hutchinson then got Mike Torti to
ground to third, but an errant throw
by Hochgesang kept the inning
alive, as Beinbrink moved to third.
The next hitter, Kevin Tom
mas ini, dribbled the ball meekly
down the third baseline. Beinbrink
ran right past Hochgesang, who
was letting the ball run foul. The
grounder stayed in fair territory
and Beinbrink scored the first Ari
zona State run.
"I thought 1 lutchinson showed a
lot of heart and a lot of character

today because we played so poorly
behind him early," Marquess said.
"He could have self-destructed but
he hung in there and really pitched
a whale of a game."
Saturday's game came on the
heels of a lengthy 11-inning Friday
night affair. After nearly 4 1/2
hours of play, Arizona State
claimed victory on a solo homer off
the bat of Kent.
Stanford played catch-up all
night, as the Sun Devils held leads
of 2-0,15-1 and 6-3 before the Cardi
nal rallied to tie the score at 3-3 in
the sixth and 6-6 in the ninth. Trail
ing 6-5 in the bottom of the ninth,
Schaefier drove in Hinch with a
clutch single to tie the score mid
send the game to extra innings.
"That hit was big for me," Scha
efier said. "It definitely would have
been nice to win, but the confidence
will help me in the long run."
Schaeffer and his teammates
look to carry their recent success
into next weekend's showdown
with USC in Los Angeles. After
sweeping Arizona this weekend,
I SC remains atop the Six-Pac with
a record of 14-4. Stanford has a firm
grip on third place in the league,
t railing the Trojans by four games
and UCLA bv three.
