# Volleyball gets a rude awakening
## Men get swept by top-ranked Hawaii 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
It was a lost weekend in Hon
olulu for the fourth-ranked
Stanford men's volleyball team.
The Cardinal men did not just
lose two matches to top-ranked
Hawaii — they were steamrolled
in the process. The Rainbows did
not concede a single game,
sweeping Stanford 15-2, 15-5,
15-5 on Thursday and complet
ing the task Saturday night with
a 15-3,15-11,15-8 win.
The ugliness only starts
there. For the weekend, the Car
dinal hit just .065, including an
underwhelming -.011 percent
age on Thursday. The men also

averaged nearly 10 hitting errors
per game while mustering only
nine team blocks on the whole
weekend. Needless to say, both
matches were over quickly, as
the Rainbows completed the
weekend sweep in a combined
two hours and 54 minutes.
Things looked optimistic for
the Cardinal on Thursday night
as a crowd of 9,274 filed into the
Special Events Arena in Honolu
lu. Stanford had junior middle
blocker Brian Moore ready to
step in and contribute off the
bench as well as the momentum
of a season-high seven-match
winning streak.
The Rainbows deflated the Car
dinal's optimism in game one, mak
ing it apparent why they are the top
team in the nation. With swing hit
ters Aaron Wilton and Navih Milo
leading the charge, 1 law;iii method
ically put Stanford away in only IS
minutes. While they were racking
up kills on their way to a sizzling
.650 hitting percentage, the Rain
bow's consistent digging and bloc k
ing frustrated the Cardinal into
several hitting errors. Stanford
would end up with only six kills and
a -.192 hitting percentage.
The second game was an im
provement, as the Cardinal hit for
a positive percentage Hut the ac
tion did not last much longer, as
Hawaii snuffed out any Stanford
hopes by putting down 20 kills and
committing only six errors, good
for a .359 hitting percentage. Al
though they committed Hi service
errors during the match, Hawaii
also came up with seven crucial
aces, led by sophomore oppoj ite
hitter Yuval Katz. Katz would
eventually finish the evening with

15 kills, five digs and a .357 hitting
percentage.
(Jame three was more of the
same, as the Cardinal was held to a
.000 hitting percentage. The Rain
bows hit .385 while getting 14
game three kills and some strong
defense from Wilton. Thejunior as
sisted on seven blocks while lead
ing the team with -ix digs. After
one hour and 17 minutes, the bar
rage was over and Stanford had
suffered a humbling setback.
After a brisk workout Friday,
Stanford returned to action the fol
lowing day in an attempt not only
to make a better showing of itself,
but also to spoil I lawaii's bid for an
undefeated conference schedule.
With a crowd of 10,225 cheering
them on, the Rainbows once again
made ijiiick work of the Cardinal,
taking a one-game lead in only 21
minutes. Stanford's offense was
bottled up once again, finishing
with a .000 hitting percentage.
Hawaii cruised along with little
trouble, getting 15 first-game kills
and committing only three errors.
After four less-tban-stellar
games, Stanford finally showed
some inoxie and made t he final two
games competitive.
.Junior opposite Matt Fuer

bringer bounced back from a poor
hitting night on Thursday with 16
kills in 30 attempts, good for a .300
hitting percentage. Sophomore
middle blocker Keenan Whitehurst
hit an effective .417 while sopho
more swing hitter Devin Poolman
chipped in with 13 kills and four
digs. I'nfortunately, the team's 11
hit ting errors did them in as Hawaii
squeaked out a four-point win.
With the momentum of a two
game lead and on the verge of mak
ing history, the Rainbows came out
strong in the third game. Wilton
and Katz led the stampede, as
Hawaii threw down 23 kills and
forced the Cardinal into 11 more
hitting errors. Senior Krik Pichel
ran an effective offense on his way
to a 54-assist night. As a result,
Hawaii was able to pull away and
become only the sixth team in
NCAA histoiy to complete a perfect
conference schedule.
As for the Cardinal men, they
return to the mainland with a 10-7
conference record, putting them in
a third-place tic with Pacific. That
makes next weekend's matches
against UC-San Diego and San
I )iego State virtual must-win situa
tions in Stanford's quest to secure
a post-season berth.
