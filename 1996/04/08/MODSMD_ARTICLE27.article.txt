# Volleyball gets a rude awakening
## Men get swept by top-ranked Hawaii 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
It was a lost weekend in Hon
olulu for the fourth-ranked
Stanford men's volleyball team.
The Cardinal men did not just
lose two matches to top-ranked
Hawaii â€” they were steamrolled
in the process. The Rainbows did
not concede a single game,
sweeping Stanford 15-2, 15-5,
15-5 on Thursday and complet
ing the task Saturday night with
a 15-3,15-11,15-8 win.
The ugliness only starts
there. For the weekend, the Car
dinal hit just .065, including an
underwhelming -.011 percent
age on Thursday. The men also

averaged nearly 10 hitting errors
per game while mustering only
nine team blocks on the whole
weekend. Needless to say, both
matches were over quickly, as
the Rainbows completed the
weekend sweep in a combined
two hours and 54 minutes.
Things looked optimistic for
the Cardinal on Thursday night
as a crowd of 9,274 filed into the
Special Events Arena in Honolu
lu. Stanford had junior middle
blocker Brian Moore ready to
step in and contribute off the
bench as well as the momentum
of a season-high seven-match
winning streak.
