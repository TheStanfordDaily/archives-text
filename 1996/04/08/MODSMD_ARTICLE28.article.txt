# Women's water polo squeaks by UC-Davis
## 
### Erin Bryla Contributing writer 
It came down to the wire Satur
day morning at DeGuerre Pool, as
the fifth-ranked Stanford
women's water polo team took
four quarters to finally put away
seventh-ranked UC-Davis for the
fourth time in as many tries.
"Every time you play Davis,
you know it is a tough game," said
head coach Ben Quittner.
Freshman Lindsay Welsh
opened the scoring when she gave
Stanford a 1-0 lead shortly after
the start. It looked like the Cardi
nal would be up 1-0 at the end of
the first period, but Davis man
aged to find the net with less than
ten seconds to go to tie up matters
at one goal apiece.
Freshman Lindsay Tam broke

this deadlock early in the second
quarter when she scored by push
ing a backhand shot past the Davis
goalie. Tarn's goal was quickly fol
lowed by a goal from team captain
Alice Cathcart, who lobbed it in
from 15 yards out when the Davis
goalie came just a little too far out
of her cage. Goalie Heather Crary
shut out the Aggies for the rest of
the half and the Cardinal went
into the locker room with a two
goal lead.
However, the Stanford women
came out in the second half lack
ing this initial intensity and
squandered the early lead. Davis
took advantage of the let-down to
get itself back into the game, as
the Aggies beat Crary and the Car
dinal defense twice to even the
score at 3-3.
This tie quickly evaporated,
though, as the Cardinal regained
its composure behind the leader
ship of Welsh. The freshman sen
sation came into her own in the
second half, scoring twice to put
the Cardinal up 5-3.

Davis battled back and scored
again to cut the deficit to one, but
with less then a minute on the
clock, Nicole Glazer put the game
out of reach by ripping a shot past
the outstretched arms of the Aggie
goalie.
"1 am pretty happy overall. Be
sides a few mental breakdowns, I
think we did a few nice things,"
Quittner said.
While Welsh was busy leading
the Cardinal offense with three

goals, it was the presence of Cath
cart on the defensive front that
proved the key to the game. Crary
had a marked effect on defense as
well, recording seven saves.
Quittner was also pleased with
the play of Tarn but feels the
women have room for improve
ment.
"If we want to move up in the
rankings we need to cut the men
tal mistakes and bad passes,"
Quittner said.
