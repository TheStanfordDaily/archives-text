April is the Crudest Month ...
Today's birthday:
Your tarot card is "Day"from the Major Ar
cana, No. 19. Its watchwords are: sun
shine, light, masculinity and virility. But
don't disregard this if you are of the female
persuasion, for the same techniques of
self-improvement (leading to that cat-in
the-sun content feeling) are applicable.
Palindromic nomenclature leads to flexi
bility that others will appreciate. Be as
sertive and smile: you'll go far.
Aries (March 21-April 19)
Watch your step today in class or meetings,
something you say could come back to
haunt you. Enjoy the sunshine in your lifo
(remember: it radiates from within), be
cause you don't know when clouds will
form.
Taurus (April 20-May 20)
Your love life soars today as that special
someone finally reciprocates your feelings.
Don't push him / her too far, though, in ex
plaining his feelings, or he might rescind the
offer!

Gemini (May 21-June 20)
Your public relations skills peak today:
Everyone at work or home will be happily
persuaded to your unique way of viewing the
world. Just don't abuse the power.
Cancer (June 21-July 22)
Don't forget the small details as you go about
your day. A forgotten key or lost paper could
sidetrack you and waste your precious time.
Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)
Stay away from computers today. The pen is
mightier than technology for once. Take time
out to drop a line to someone who needs to
hear from you in ink.
Virgo (Aug. 2.'J-Sept. 22)
Numbers are your friends as your bank ac
count balance soars or your problem set
flows out of you. Do as much work as you
can today, while you're in the mood.
Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)
What goes around comes around, to you,
Libra. You get a taste of your own medicine
today, which may be bitter herbs. Learn your
lesson and it won't happen again.

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)
You're feeling active today, which makes it a
great time to start that new diet or exercise
regime you've been planning. Put it off no
longer!
Sagittarius (N0v.22-Dec.2l)
Carry the dictionary around today, and
watch what you say! People are in no humor
for your harsh, teasing "jokes."
Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan 19)
Stop thinking about it and go! Now is your
chance, Capricorn, to take that trip or make
the plunge you've been waffling over. Seize
the day, worry about the money and conse
quences later.
Aquarius (Jan 20-Feb.lB)
Your friends need you more than you think,
today. Try to be available and open; they
need lots of encouragement.
Pisccs (Feb.lO-March 20)
When in doubt, let it out. Tell the person
you're miffed at what it is they do to annoy
you. Now is not the time to let it roll off your
back.
