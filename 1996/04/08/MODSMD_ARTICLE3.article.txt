The Faculty Senate's recent de
cision not to include students on
the new Planning and Policy
Board prompted ASSU leaders to
hold a special meeting Friday
night to consider the University's
commitment to student represen
tation.
At the meeting, student leaders
discussed their reaction to Thurs
day's senate vote and tried to "un
derstand the point of view of the
Faculty Senate and what their in
tentions were," said Bernard
Gilroy, an ASSU graduate senator.
In close vote, the senate passed
an amendment removing the
phrase, "and two students," from
the charge to the board, which
originally read, "The board shall
consist of nine members of the
Academic Council and two stu
dents."
The senate created the board
about three years ago to examine
strategic planning issues.
"The reasons the senate gave
for not keeping students on the
board were frightening — it
seemed to say student representa
tion is an intrinsically bad thing,"
Gilroy said. "It makes us question
what the Faculty Senate wants to
discuss if they don't want us on
our committees."
Assoc. Education Prof. Patricia
Guinport, the senator who origi
nally voiced her concern with stu
dent representation on the board,
said the reason she did not want

students included was not because
she felt students were unreliable.
"Over the past several decades,
students have proven themselves
mature and articulate contribu
tors to University policy-making
— this is why we have them on the
Faculty Senate," Gumport said.
"With regard to the board, I be
lieve effective student input can be
made through open and ongoing
consultation, which might be a
more effective vehicle to obtain the
full diversity of student view
points."
Gumport said the proposed ad
dition of two students to the new
board is less likely to represent the
full range of student perspectives
that might be relevant to particu
lar issues than consultation with
whole groups.
ASSU Financial Manager John
Hall said he was worried about the
message the senate was sending to
students by not includingstudents
directly on the board.
"I think the Stanford faculty
has a long history of being open to
student involvement and being in
terested in the positive contribu
tions students can make," Hall
said.
Hall said he felt that the action
as it stands — excluding students
directly from the board without a
more specific explanation as to
why students would be detrimen
tal to the decisions the committee
would make — represented a re
versal of a tradition of welcoming
