# Beating the odds: Child finds marrow donor
## 
### Jennifer Wang Contributing writer 
Adrian Sandoval has beat the odds
once again.
The 2-year-old, suffering from a
rare genetic disorder, found a match
ing bone marrow donor this week,
after a year-long wait at the Lucile
Salter Packard Children's Hospital.
Adrian became the first patient
with X-linked lymphoproliferative dis
ease to be treated at the Children's
Hospital when he was moved here

from the University of Nebraska Med
ical Center last April. Although Ne
braska employs the international ex
perts on the disorder, which was dis
covered in 1975 and seems to affect
only males, Adrian's parents chose to
move him closer to their Menlo Park
home to say goodbye.
But now it looks like Adrian may
have a full, healthy life ahead.
"He truly is the miracle baby," said
Adrian's cousin Emilia Delgadillo, the
family's unofficial press secretary. "He
is always fighting and makes the fami

ly want to fight too. He is a happy, won
derful child and you can't help but love
him."
The National Bone Marrow Donor
Program found the match for Adrian,
notifying his parents, Salvador San
doval and Patricia Muller Sandoval on
Thursday.
Only 272 cases of the disease have
been reported worldwide, but this is
the second time the tragedy has struck
the Sandoval family. They lost their
first son, David, in 1990, when he was
less than 2 vears old.

Adrian's slim one-in-a-million
chance of finding a match was due to
the scarcity of minority donors in the
national registries. While Caucasians
make up a high percentage of potential
donors, only 6 percent of those regis
tered are Chicano / Latino.
As there is relatively little informa
tion on the disease, Sandoval does not
know exactly what Adrian's chances of
survival are.
Dr. Yisheng Lee, the hematologist
treating Adrian at Stanford, said
Adrian could reject the injected
marrow.
Salvador Sandoval said the
family has decided to wait until
the summer for the operation to
allow Adrian to regain some
strength. After the operation, he
said, it will be at least a month be
fore the success is known.
In the course of finding Adri
an's donors, the family has helped

set up more than 100 blood drives
on the West Coast aimed at Chi
cano / Latino donors.
While Adrian's future is look
ing bright, the struggle is far from
over.
"There are ups and downs, but
we are always hopeful," Sandoval
said. "We don't stop here just be
cause Adrian found a donor. You
want to give back when you re
ceive."
