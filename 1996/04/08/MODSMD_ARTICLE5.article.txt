National Humanist of the Year
Richard Dawkins defended scien
tific Darwinism and explained
Saturday night that all life in the
universe, even that which is
undiscovered, has evolved in the
same manner.
"I have a strong hunch that all
life evolved by something equiva
lent to Darwinian natural selec
tion," Dawkins, a zoology profes
sor at Oxford University, told
about 1,000 people in Memorial
Auditorium. "It is not just a theo
ry of life on this planet, but a the-

ory of life all over
the universe. . . .
We don't know if
there's life on
other planets,
but my own sus
picion is that
there is. And not
only queerer
than we suppose,
but queerer than

we can suppose. There are more
things on heaven and earth that
can be dreamed of in any philoso
phy."
