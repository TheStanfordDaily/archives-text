# Humanist endorses evolutionary theory

National Humanist of the Year
Richard Dawkins defended scien
tific Darwinism and explained
Saturday night that all life in the
universe, even that which is
undiscovered, has evolved in the
same manner.
"I have a strong hunch that all
life evolved by something equiva
lent to Darwinian natural selec
tion," Dawkins, a zoology profes
sor at Oxford University, told
about 1,000 people in Memorial
Auditorium. "It is not just a theo
ry of life on this planet, but a the-

ory of life all over
the universe. . . .
We don't know if
there's life on
other planets,
but my own sus
picion is that
there is. And not
only queerer
than we suppose,
but queerer than

we can suppose. There are more
things on heaven and earth that
can be dreamed of in any philoso
phy."


Dawkins
The hour-long lecture was
sponsored by the Stanford Hu
manists.
Dawkins, called the"Charles
Darwin of today," began his
speech by quoting author Aldous
Huxley, reminding people, "We
are going to die and that makes us
the lucky ones. Most people are
not going to be born."
112 le explained that since one day
the sun will become a red giant
and will engulf the earth, the odds
of being born in a century which
allows life on this planet are low.
In fact, he stated, "It's over
whelmingly probable that you are
dead."
Dawkins said Darwinian theo
ry is the only possible solution to
the problem of how living things
improbably exist, since natural
selection "snares out the luck"
through "incremental, not im

probable steps" so that at t he end
of a long period of time, an eye, or
another body part gradually de
velops.
"We are all descended from a
long line of successful survivors,"
he added.
Dawkins gave a general."recipe
for life (to survive) anywhere." In
gredients include, he said, heredi
ty, mutation, the replication
power of DNA and randomness.
As an example of the natural se
lection process, Dawkins pointed
to the human brain. The brain, he
said, has swelled out of necessity.
"Would you expect evolution to
be progressive?" Dawkins asked.
"Not the silly kind of progress
(which says that) evolution is
aimed at the glorious goal of homo
sapiens. But that doesn't mean
evolution doesn't mean to be pro
gressive in another sense, like an
arms race. In an escalated arms
race, weaponry gets better but ef
fectiveness doesn't change be
cause the opposition is improving
at the same rate. This occurs in

nature: between predators and
prey, parasites and hosts ..."
He speculated that for hu
mans, the brain could be a kind of
peacock's tail — the smarter of
the species reproduce more. Or,
he speculated, maybe language
put such demands on the brain
that it caused the brain to evolve
quickly.
Dawkins also addressed a cre
ationist critique of Darwinism.
"Many people have heard that
Darwinians believe that life
evolves at random. Creationists
say evolution should have been
random. Mutation is random, but
natural selection is anything but
random. It's preeminently non
random."
The final ingredient to Darwin
ism, Dawkins said, is gradualism.
Evolution has to be gradual, he
said. He refuted what he called
the "much publicized theory of
punctuated equilibrium," or "the
theory of evolution by jerks."
"Even punctuated steps are
just rapid gradualism," he said.
