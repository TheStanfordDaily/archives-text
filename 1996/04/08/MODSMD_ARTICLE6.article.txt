# 'Bringing the world into the classroom'
## New group aims to put spark in school 
### Yu-Jin Kim 
A group of Stanford students
has joined a newly formed collabo
ration of Bay Area college students
in hopes of putting a spark in chil
dren's education by speaking
about current events in local
schools.
"Bringing the world into the
classroom" is the motto of the new
community service group Cur
rents. Currents allows students to

gain first-hand teaching experi
ence at local elementary, junior
high and high schools while giving
presentations on timely topics.
A desire to bring contemporary
issues into the classroom motivat
ed the group's founder, Foothill
College student Tully Somekh.
Finding limited interest in the pro
gram at Foothill, Somekh turned
to other Bay Area schools such as
Stanford, UC-Berkeley, De Anza
College and Santa Clara Universi
ty to recruit interested students.
At Stanford, Somekh found ju
nior Ben Saenz, and sophomores
Dara Kaplan and Jenn Derr. At
present the Stanford chapter is
still in its organizational stages,
but Currents members are opti
mistic about the program's poten
tial.
"I've always wanted to find a
way to add another dimension to
education. Currents will get stu

dents to see what's going on in the
world," Kaplan said.
Currents will allow students to
give presentations at local schools
on topics which they have already
studied or have a deep interest.
Not much of training or research is
necessary because Currents mem
bers should already be relatively
knowledgeable about their topics,
Saenz said.
"It shouldn't take much time,"
he said, "because they're talking
about something they're excited
about, in their area of expertise."
Derr agreed. "They can talk
about exactly what they're good at
and what they like," she said.
Kaplan, a human biology major,

and Derr, a biology major, plan to
give presentations on current
bioethical issues such as AIDS and
sexually transmitted diseases.
Saenz, a member of the Stanford
Solar Car Project, will talk about
the solar air and topics on alter
nate energy.
By talking about things that in
terest them personally, Currents
members hope "to go in there and
make students excited about the
topic," said Derr.
Members hope to expand their
range of topics to cover current de
velopments in other areas such as
political science and literature. Ka
plan said the main criteria for a
Currents topic is that "it's some

thing [the presenter] is really ex
cited about."
Currents members see their po
sition as college students as a key
advantage to the program. "I think
k Is will respond well to us because
we're not really kids and we're not
really adults," said Kaplan.
Derr said one of the program's
benefits is allowing students from
several universities to work to
gether.
"It lets students get involved
not only with other Stanford stu
dents but with students from
other colleges," she said. "It's
more of a community effort."
"We're hoping it can spread as
an organization" atrreed Saenz.
