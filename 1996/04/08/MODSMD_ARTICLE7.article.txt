## Storey filled with chef's blissful desserts 
### Heather Knight Staff writer 
Some people have all the luck. Students who are
fortunate enough to draw into Storey House don't get
just a prime location and beautiful home — they get
the desserts, too.

the kitchen tables at every meal, courtesy of Storey's
chef, Janice Warren. The desserts and other delicious
food may draw the students to her kitchen, but this
former model's lively conversation is what keeps
them there.
"I love the students. Every once in a while, you
wish someone would go live at Sigma Chi, but, gener
ally speaking, Storey attracts great students," War
ren said.
Warren's cooking career took off while she taught
pre-school in East Palo Alto. Because Warren consid
ered the school district lunches to be overpriced and
of poor quality, she took on the role of chef, as well as
teacher.
Warren spent the following years catering and
teaching cooking classes and seminars on nutrition. A
self-professed lover of the classifieds section, Warren
noticed an ad announcing an opening for a cook in
Haus Mitteleuropa eight years ago. She worked there
for two years before moving to Storey.
Warren said she enjoys cooking in the college
house atmosphere.
"It's more creative than cooking for 5-year-olds
and less creative than catering. It's a great situation if
you're a people person. I listen to great music all day
and talk to really interesting people. I get summers
off. It's great. You get to be a lot more creative than

with your own family," she said.
Warren said she hits received a
lot of positive feedback from the stu
dents.
"People generally love my
desserts, but in a house of 40 some
people, you're not going to please
everyone," she said.
Warren definitely seems to have
pleased most, though. Senior Amir
Taghinia has lived in Storey for two
years and says the foot! may have
something to do with that. His fa
vorite dishes are Warren's stuffed
grape leaves, Greek burritos and
cream pies.
Junior Eddie Dinel, whose fa
vorite dish is lasagna, said he has
mixed feeling about her cinnamon
rolls.
"The cinnamon sugar becomes
glue. It tastes wonderful, but it's a
pain to hash," he said.
Other student favorites include
chocolate chip cookies and the
make-your-own-sushi bar.
If some dishes sound exotic, that
is no accident. Warren tries to intro
duce students to many typo:- of
foods.

"So many people here have been
all over the world, but what do they
want to eat? Kraft Macaroni and
Cheese. Their parents redly did a
disservice to them by not having
them try things," she said.
Obviously, calorie counting
comes into play. Warren said stu
dents often complain about the calo
ries in her food.
"We always have a lot of fresh
fruit. Nobody's making you eat I the
desserts)," she said.
The development of healthy eat
ing habits among many students
has changed Warren's menu over
the past few years.
"We used to have sausage and
fries for lunch. People wanted burg
ers all the time. Now, they prefer
steamed rice every night. I use hard
ly any oil in my cooking. Mydesserts,
I make no apology for, " she said.
Almost miraculously, Warren
has maintained a slim figure.
"You can't cook and not taste.
Luckily, I don't need to taste the
desserts anymore. There are always
people that do it for you," she said.
Heing in the kitchen all day, War
ren said her family dinners at home
sometimes suffer.
"My kids are having nuggets and
fries from McDonald's tonight," she
lauirhed.
