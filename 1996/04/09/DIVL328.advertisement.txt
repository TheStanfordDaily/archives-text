A) Stanford grads know a great opportunity when they see one.
B) Stanford grads want to stay in the Bay Area after graduation.
C) We couldn't grow over 1200% in 2 years with just anybody.
D) There aren't enough good Harvard grads to fill up half a company.
E) All of the above.
At Score, we take graduates from Stanford, the Ivy
League, and other top universities and provide them with first
rate educational and business experience. You need to have a
heart for kids, a keen business mind, a solid academic record,
and the energy to hang with the nation's fastest-growing
educational start-up.
It's not an easy job, but our employees know that it's a
rewarding one.
Hey, twenty top Stanford grads couldn't be wrong.
