Your tarot card is Two Guns." This is a con
frontation card, where the forces in your life go

your previously lofty mood hits a
downturn today. Pamper yourself and ride it out:
tomorrow is another dayl

give yourself free reign. You can't do wrong,
you're golden.

while you're walking to class. Even the
