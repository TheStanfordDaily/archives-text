# Vandals hit center
## Two incidents of racist grafitti raise community, police concern 
### Dana Hangai Contributing writer 
In two separate incidents last
week, vandals wrote derogatory
racial epithets in Room 14 of the
Asian American Activities Center
— the first time in recent memory
that such remarks have been
aimed at one of Stanford's ethnic
centers.
On April 1, an unknown sus
pect or suspects wrote "CHINK"
in red felt pen on a computer mon
itor in the couch room, according
to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. No other objects in the
room were damaged.
In a second incident discovered
Friday morning by Asst. Director
Cindy Ng, vandals entered and
used a mustard bottle present in
the room to write "Fuck yo chink"
inside the refrigerator, Niemeyer
said. Police believe that the van
dalism occurred within an 18-hour
period on Thursday afternoon.
According to Niemeyer, the
room is used routinely by people
who are not in the Asian-American
community and the inside door to
Old Union is often unlocked. "Our
deputy h. surmised that the door
was not locked," Niemeyer said,
"since there was no evidence of
forced entry."
Currently, police have identi
fied no suspects. Although the
mustard container was finger

printed, it provided no usable in
formation.
A similar incident occurred dur
ing winter quarter, when the
words "Chinks suck" were written
on a table in the couch room pro
vided for the Korean student liter
ary magazine Reflections. The
case Wiis not reported to the police,
said Rick Yuen, the center's direc
tor, because it was believed to be
aii isolated incident.
"The first time it happened, it
was a isolated event," said fresh
man Jane Kim, a staff member at
the center. "And then it happened
again, so people started talking
about it. Now it's happened a third
time, so we decided finally to re
port it."
Members of the Asian-Ameri
can community "are extremely
upset over this," Yuen said. "This
is a very disrespectful and despica
ble act."
Yuen said there would be no
changes to the center's meeting
policies but "we've notified the
various officers of the various
Asian-American organizations.
We have asked students and the
community to be watchful when
they are in the center."
Asian American Students Asso
ciation Chair Gavin Funabiki said
he was unsure what action the
Asian-American community
would take regarding the graffiti,
but a general meeting will be held
Thursday to discuss the issue's
implications.
When he initially heard about
the vandalism, Funabiki said, "I
was pretty shocked. I didn't think
anything like that would happen
on campus. I know that some peo
ple have said this on campus, but I
didn't believe that people would
do that kind of thing."
Anyone with information con
cerning the vandalism should
contact Stanford Police at 723-
9633.
