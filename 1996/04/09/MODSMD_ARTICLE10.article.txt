# College students for a day
## Eighth graders find Stanford not quite like 'saved by the Bell' 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Editorial staff 
For the four eighth graders
from Long Beach, Calif., who are
visiting Stanford, the University
has held only one major disap
pointment: the size of dorm
rooms.
"They look bigger on TV. On
'Saved By the Bell: The College
Years,' you could fit three beds
and a weight set in a room," said
Ivan Zaragoza, whose trip to
Stanford is the result of his
prize-winning essay.
Aside from the space issue,
however, their Stanford visit has
gone successfully. Zaragoza,
Marisa Henderson, A'sma Abu-
Zaineh and Veasha Sok, all 13
years old, have spent the last two
days touring the campus, as well
as exploring San Francisco. They
are accompanied by their science
teacher from Lindbergh Middle
School, Jane Bahk.
Bahk is a 1995 Stanford grad
uate and a participant in the
Teach For America program,
which, under the auspices of
Americorps, sends college gradu
ates into needy schools nation
wide for two-year periods.
Lindbergh has limited re
sources and is located across the
street from a housing project,
Bahk said. A wall divides the
school and the housing project in
order to protect students from
stray bullets. The bulk of the
funding for the trip to Stanford
came from a personal friend of
hers and Bahk is covering most
of the daily expenses.
Bahk arranged the trip after
she heard about a national essay
contest which offered winners a
trip to Houston. She encouraged
her own students to enter the
contest, providing the added in
centive of a trip to Stanford for
Lindbergh's best essayists. Abu-
Zaineh and Sok won the contest,
writing about AIDS and genetic
engineering, respectively.
Bahk then re-opened the con
test, saying that two more stu
dents could win places on the trip
with essays about why they

wanted to go.
Since Sunday, the visitors
have been on the move almost
nonstop. Following tlu'ir plane's
arrival Sunday afternoon, they
headed to the Exploratorium in
San Francisco. They especially
liked the Exploratorium's Tac
tile Dome, which featured a tun
nel they could crawl through. "I
hit my head," Zaragoza said.
"Then I scared [the girls]."
The group then hit China
town, where they had dinner.
Henderson inadvertently or
dered two full-sized dinners
sweet and sour chicken and chow
mein — as well as rice. "The
plates in Long Beach are small
er," she explained.
On Sunday night, the group
stayed at the Glass Slipper Inn
on El Camino Real. The two hoys
shared one bed, the two girls
shared the other and Bahk slept
in a sleeping bag on the floor.
On Monday morning, they
met up with Stanford students in
order to attend classes. Zaragoza
and Sok went with freshman
Steve Macias, while Henderson
and Abu-Zaineh went with fresh

man Ann Karash.
"We went to a Literature and
the Arts class," said Sok. "We
were learning about Frances
[sic] Goya."
As for whether the class held
the boys' attention, Zaragoza ad
mitted, "I was falling asleep. It
wasn't boring, but I was tired.
The guy next to us fell asleep
too."
The girls, meanwhile, attend
ed a modern dance class, which
Henderson characterized as
"kind of cool. But it looked like
mostly warm-ups. My interest
was torn away."
Next, Henderson and Abu-
Zaineh sat in on an Italian class.
"It was very confusing," Abu-
Zaineh said. "The teacher
thought we were students. She
was like, 'You didn't bring your
books.' Ann answered in Italian,
so we don't know what she
said."
In the late afternoon, the
eighth graders met up to attend
Assoc. Biological Science Prof.
Robert Sapolsky's human behav
ioral biology class. "The class
was difficult," said Sok. "But

I the professor] gave a lot of ex
amples you could understand."
The best part of the lecture,
the eight b graders agreed, was
hearing about bedbugs' mating
practices.
Zaragoza, Sok, Henderson
and Abu-Zaineh will remain on
campus for the rest of today and
depart t his evening. When asked
about their impressions of the
University mid-way through
their visit, they were mostly pos
itive.
"I like tin' Flicks tradition,"
said Zaragoza. "Why do they
throw paper?"
"1 think the best feature is the
church," said Henderson.
"I don't see any cars around,"
said Sok. "I don't like the bikes.
They're everywhere. They go
fast."
"1 like the way all the build
ings look old," said Abu-Zaineh.
Already, Abu-Zaineh is look
ing toward the future. "Hope
fully, I'll get in [to Stanford],
and if I get in, my parents will
have to buy me a bike, and
they'll see what a beautiful cam
pus it is."
