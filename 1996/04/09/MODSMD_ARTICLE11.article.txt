Molester asks to be castrated
SAN ANTONIO (AP) - A child
molester who threatened to kill his
next victims was released from prison
yesterday after agreeing to a parole so
strict he will be locked up or accompa
nied by guards at all times.
Larry Don McQuay, a professed
"child-molesting demon" who has
acknowledged abusing some 240 chil
dren, agreed to parole conditions that
prison officials said were among the
most restrictive ever issued.
"I don't think there's any problem
using the word 'unprecedented,' " said
Larry Todd, a spokesman for the
Texas Department of Criminal Jus
tice.
McQuay also has asked to be cas
trated in hopes it would stop his urge
to molest. Prison officials said it's up
to him to decide when and if he
receives the surgery.
"Cost does not appear to be an issue
at this point in that people are lining
up for us to pay for this," said Victor

Rodriguez, chairman of the Texas
Board of Pardons and Paroles.
"We will refer to him any and all
information that we have."
Team investigating crash
DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) - A
U.S. team investigating the plane crash
that killed Commerce Secretary Ron
Brown focused on the Dubrovnik air
port's navigation system yesterday and
ruled out any link between the crash
and the suicide of the system's mainte
nance chief.
Niko Jerkic shot himself in the chest
at his home Saturday, three days after
Brown's plane slammed into a hilltop
near Dubrovnik in a windy rainstorm,
killing all 35 people aboard. Brown and a
group of U.S. business leaders were
looking into business and investment
opportunities in the Balkans.
The Croatian Interior Ministry
issued a statement yesterday saying Jer
kic was not working Wednesday, the day
of the crash.
