# Classmates recall Kaczynski
## Unabomber suspect was fascinated by bombs, former friends say

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Unabomber
suspect Theodore Kaczynski had a fascina
tion with explosives — and a connection
with wood — dating back to high school in
the Chicago suburbs, two former class
mates said yesterday.
Jo Ann I)e Young, who now lives in San
Jose, was so suspicious of Kaczynski that
she called the FBI anonymously bust year
and suggested investigators examine her
class at Evergreen Park High School.
She didn't mention Kaczynski's name,
however, she said.
"I was very nervous," she said. "I fig
ured if I was wrong, I'd ruined a life.... I
didn't feel they were real interested in
what I had to say."
Jo Ann and her husband Lorin, who
also attended the school, described
Kaczynski as a lonely, brilliant but imma
ture student who liked to attract attention
with pranks.
Kaczynski, in an accelerated program,
was two years younger than most of his
classmates.
Lorin De Young said Kaczynski's bril
liance received so much attention at Ever

green Park that he may have felt alienated
when he went to Harvard University and
later UC-Berkeley, where geniuses were
common.
"Everybody fussed over his brilliance to
a great degree, he was a focal point at our
school," he said. "I guess that might be
part of his downfall."
Jo Ann De Young recalled an incident
from chemistry class in which Kaczynski
rolled up a piece of paper and twisted it in
t he middle. On either side of the twist, he
had put different chemicals and sealed the
ends of the roll. Kaczynski handed it to her
and told her to unwind it.
"When I twisted it, there was like a pop.
The thing had gone off, like he made a lit
tle hand bomb," she said.
Kaczynski pulled the same stunt the
next day with another girl and was almost
suspended, she said.
She also once opened her locker to find
the hide of a ait that had been dissected
earlier in class. She believes Kaczynski,
who stood by and watched her discovery,
had planted it there.
Ijorin De Young played trombone with

Kaczynski in the high school band.
"He was quiet, immature, very bright
in math and science. He was just a whiz,"
he said. "But he was socially inept... he
wasn't interested in girls, he didn't play
sports, he wasn't much of a musician."
The De Youngs — who now run a pri
vate school for children — have a theory
on why Kaczynski, if he is the Unabomber,
carefully enclosed his bombs in wood.
"We came from Evergreen Park, and
Oak Lawn was next to us," Jo Ann said.
"He was kind of like the bomb in the
wood."
The Unabomber's obsession with the
environment and industrial society must
have come after high school, Lorin De
Young said.
"I don't recall his being interested in
politics at all," he said.
But his wife said she felt strongly
enough about Kaczynski to call the FBI
when details of the Unabomber case
emerged last year.
Lorin De Young said he thought she had
gone overboard — until last week, when
Kaczynski was identified {is a suspect.
