## Election ineptitude 
### 
The ASSU Senate was
exceedingly negligent in
organizing for election

ELECTIONS ARE inherently
difficult to organize, but a
series of unacceptable mis
steps by Stanford's student govern
ment nearly turned next week's vot
ing into a disaster. The problems am
be traced back to a common source
— a general lack of leadership in the
political arm of the ASSU.
Because of some scrambling on
the part of the Elections Commis
sion, it appears that the election will
go on as planned. However, the pro
gression to this point has been far
from smooth.
Much of the blame lies on the
backs of the members of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, which is
charged with reviewing and adjust
ing special-fee groups' funding
requests and forwarding complete
and accurate budgets to the full sen
ate for ballot placement.
The committee did meet with spe
cial-fee groups, but it failed to ensure
that the budgets were accurate and
properly formatted. As it turned out,
a significant number did not add up
correctly, and none of the budgets
followed the required form.
These problems would have made
it impossible for the financial side of
the ASSU to enforce spending rules,
so Financial Manager John Hall
refused to accept the budgets when
he received them in mid-March. Hall
returned them to the senate and
asked that they be fixed.
At this point, the ASSU was
already far behind the schedule
delineated in its elections package,
which said that groups would be able
to inspect final proofs of their bud
gets in the Elections Handbook
stalling March 11.
As it turned out, Deputy Senate
Chair Bill Shen did not resolve the
problems until last Tuesday, nearly
three weeks after the problems were

initially reported. That night, the
"fixed" budgets were passed by the
senate, which was not even provided
paper copies of the revisions.
On Wednesday, well past
announced deadlines, the new bud
gets were given to Type & Design for
inclusion in the elections handbook.
Although he was at fault for the
delay, Shen had the audacity to try to
shift some of the blame to the type
setter, saying "[Type & Designl
doesn't give us deadlines. We give
them deadlines."
Such unprofessional behavior is
unacceptable, especially because
Shen himself was at fault. To its
credit, Type & Design was able to do
the job quickly, returning proofs to
the ASSU late Thursday.
Although the Elections Commis
sion tried to contact all groups quick
ly, many were not able to check their
budgets before Friday's 1 p.m. dead
line; some groups said that they
didn't even know about the deadline
until it was too late.
This was unfair, especially since
the original schedule said that
groups would have nearly two weeks
to check their budgets.
Despite the numerous mixups,
the handbook will be distributed
starting today — although it still
won't be complete. One of the two
constitutional amendments on the
ballot won't be detailed because
ASSU Senate Chair Alane Murdock
failed to tell the Elections Commis
sion about it until Friday. Further
more, confusion over ballot measure
pro and con statements almost kept
a statement supporting "Constitu
tion '96" out of the handbook.
These errors are typical of the
problems of the ASSU: Its leaders
cannot effectively organize and lead
anything, be it a senate meeting or
the spring election. Instead of focus
ing on the basics — ensuring that
budgets balance or that all passed
amendments are on the ballot, for
example — they prefer to squabble
among themselves.
Poor leadership from ASSU politi
cians is nothing new; nonetheless,
it's unfortunate and has wreaked
havoc on the entire election process.
