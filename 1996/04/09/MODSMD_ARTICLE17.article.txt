## Reflections on religion 
### 
£TTTE HAVE TO pray in the
\l\l fields; if they catch us, they
V Y will kill us." So read the read
the letter from a Chinese Christian
woman. As part of its annual Singing
for Freedom Concert, Amnesty Interna
tional gave a presentation on human
rights violations. This year, Amnesty
focused on China, detailing the religious
persecution, and the stripping of civil
rights. At the intermission, we signed
postcards, asking for the release of a
prisoner-of-conscience.
Then the lights dimmed again. We all
sat down again to be entertained. Out
from the corner ran Testimony, the
Christian a cappella group, famous for
their big smiles. The crowd was not
entirely welcoming. We were on-guard
against any message this group would
send. They sang "Amazing Love," a
beautiful church hymn. As their voices
hushed, Testimony did not break into a
skit or a mime. A man stepped forward.
"We'd like to thank Amnesty for
allowing us to sing. Amnesty promotes
religious freedom that allows mission
aries . . . ah, Christian missionaries, to
spread the truth in other countries."
The audience seethed in the dark
ness. I felt sorry for the speaker. His
words seemed to subvert his purpose.
Instead of provoking thought, he alien
ated the crowd.
He nervously added, "If you're inter
ested in hearing more, read the Bible.

The Bible is the truth. Talk to any
Christian, and I'm sure they'll be happy
to tell you."
They sang about a religious battle
and trooped off stage, stalwartly smil
ing.
Comments overheard ranged from"I
can't believe they just did that" to
"That was inappropriate" to "What else
could you expect?"
Afterwards, I wondered if there was
any better way for Testimony to have
conveyed its message. The audience
seemed primed to reject the religious
intrusion. How was the group any dif
ferent from SEAS protesting Taco Bell
or a professor charting the path of an
electron? In this academic atmosphere,
it somehow seems easier to reject prose
lytizers as being narrow-minded. It's
much harder to understand the origins
of the beliefs which are not based upon
the accepted notions of the rational, the
intellectual.
Sunday, I went to the Easter sunrise
service at Frost Amphitheater. As a
child, I had my yearly dose of religion on
that day of the resurrection. Since being
at Stanford, though, I had not been to
service.
People were singing on the stage. I
remembered the last time I had been
there, for the They Might Be Giants
concert. "No body-surfing this time," I
joked. I wasn't quite sure what to
expect.

The cool breath of the dawn matched
the congregation's sense of peace. Birds
flew overhead in shifting formations.
Curled on my blanket next to some of
my friends, 1 listened to the speakers,
the preachers. Though I enjoyed the
service, I did not share that overwhelm
ing elation.
Afterwards, the people were min
gling and hugging, truly a part of a larg
er community. They wanted to spread
that sense of joy. Reverend Thompkins
spoke of how every Christian should
spread the truth of Jesus, and the great
courage it takes to do so. Still, I'm not
sure of the effectiveness of conversion. I
bristle at the term "any Christian" —
no homogenous label can capture per
sonal spirituality. Ascribed core beliefs
have different manifestations in indi
viduals.
Ultimately, religion is an intensely
private choice. A piece in the Rodin
Sculpture garden captures my vision.
Entitled "Prayer," the visible markers
of prayer are gone: no hands clasped,
head bowed or knees bent — they have
all been pared away, into a sculpted
torso and thighs. The wholeness of
prayer is seen from within.
