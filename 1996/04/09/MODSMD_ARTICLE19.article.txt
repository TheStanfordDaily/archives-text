Q # Why is it easier to balance an
egg on its end on the vernal
• equinox than on other days ?
A I'm reminded of something I
• once heard, "The moon may be
• smaller, but the earth is a lot
closer." The quote actually has nothing
to do with this question, but it's cool
nonetheless.
I asked around about this and no one
seemed to have a very concrete explana
tion as to why it is easier to balance eggs
on an equinox than on any other day of
the year. Scientifically, there doesn't
seem to be any reason to believe it's 1 rue.
But still, I'll pursue the question.
You're probably wondering what an
equinox is. Technically, it's one of the two
points where the ecliptic crosses t he celes
tial equator. Of course, that probably
doesn't make anything clearer. It probably
wouldn't make too much of a difference if
I told you that the ecliptic is the apparent

circular path relative to the fixed stars fol
lowed by the sun in one year. And telling
you that the celestial equator is the inter
section of the celestial sphere with the
earth's equator might just cause a nervous
breakdown for some people.
A more understandable definition
would be that the equinoxes are the
points in the year when the sun is direct
ly above the earth's equator. On an
equinox, the length of the day is equal to
the length of the night.
Anyway, the idea of the equinoxes
started back when people thought the
sun orbited the earth, so they actually
thought that the sun was crossing over
the equator. When it appeared that the
sun was crossing over from the southern
hemisphere to the northern hemisphere
around March 21, they called it the ver
nal equinox. Around Sept. 23, when it
looked like the sun was crossing back
over to the southern hemisphere, they
called it the autumnal equinox.
The thing is, though, that the equinox
really has nothing to do with the gravita
(ional effect of the sun on the earth.

Some people think that the alignment of
the sun with the earth on the equinox
makes it easier to balance things, but this
isn't true. The only time the sun's align
ment would help to balance things would
be if it were directly overhead, and during
the equinox this only happens at the
equator at noon. If you don't see why,
maybe you should go back and re-read
the last few paragraphs. If you're back a
second time and still don't understand,
go back again and try reading it over
slowly. If this is your third time around, I
suggest you just give it up and go work on
the crossword or something. I'll give you
a hint, 10-down is the word "sun."
Another proposed theory about eggs
and the equinox is that gravity is weakest
during the vernal equinox because the
earth is closest to the sun at that point, and
so the sun's gravity helps to cancel out
some of the earth's gravity. The main
problem with this is that the earth's orbit
is closest to the sun sometime in the mid
dle of December, nowhere near either
equinox. The other problem is that the
force of gravity you feel from the sun is less

than one-tenth of a percent of the force of
gravity you feel from the earth. The differ
ence between when the sun is closest and
when it is farthest is many times smaller,
so the distance of the sun from the earth
makes almost no difference at all.
So, this whole discussion begs the
question: "Why do people continue to
believe that eggs are easier to balance on
the vernal equinox?"
Probably, people continue to believe
this because they don't try balancing eggs
any other day of the year. If you don't try
balancing eggs on any other day of the
year, you probably will only be able to
balance eggs on the vernal equinox.
This in turn begs another question:
"Who started this whole egg and equinox
thing in the first place?"
I'm only guessing here, but I think it
probably has to do with the fact that the
vernal equinox is the closest astronomi
cal event to Easter. Probably, one vernal
equinox many years ago, someone with a
bunch of eggs they had bought for Easter
got really bored and tried balancing them
on their ends. When this extremely bored

(and boring) person eventually got it to
work, he or she probably told another
equally bored / boring friend, who in turn
found it to be the only ray of light in their
otherwise boring life and went on to tell it
to other people. Eventually, it leaked out
of Boring Town and made its way into
contemporary urban folklore.
Which brings us to beg once again for
another question: "Who started the rela
tionship between eggs and Easter?"
The answer is that the prominence of
the egg is a custom which was handed
down from ancient Middle Eastern pagan
spring festivals where the egg was seen as
a symbol of fertility. The egg then became
a symbol of birth and resurrection when
put into the context of Easter and Lent.
And finally, this begs the ultimate
question: "Which came first, the equinox
or the egg?"
