If Kappa Alpha fraternity can re
cruit enough new members during
this spring's Fraternity Rush, the
fraternity will regain its house at
664 Lomita Drive, Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Heather Dunn said
yesterday.
Rush kicked off last night for the
17 campus fraternities and will run
through April 22.
Because the KAs were unable to
attract enough new members in
last spring's Rush, they lost their
house for this year. All housed fra
ternities must maintain 90 percent
occupancy.
There are currently seven
housed and 10 unhoused fraterni

housed is in jeopardy of losing its
house, Dunn said.
"Everyone is expecting to get a
full number of pledges this year,"
Interfraternity Council President

Craig Thomas said. "We are confi
dent everyone will keep their hous
es, and we hope that some fraterni
ties might get their houses back as
well."
The KA house holds 52 people,
and, according to IFC Rush Chair
Rob Volkel, the KAs need 35
pledges to fill the house.
Due to the existence of a grand
father clause, fraternities that had
on-campus housing in the 1980s
have the right to retain their hous
es assuming they have enough
members and are in good standing
with the University. Since the KAs
are both "grandfathered" and in
good standing, they can regain
their house next fall if they have
enough members, Dunn said.

the Zetes occupied 353 Campus
