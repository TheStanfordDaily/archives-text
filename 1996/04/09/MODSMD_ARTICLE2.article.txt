# KAs hope to regain house through Rush
## 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
If Kappa Alpha fraternity can re
cruit enough new members during
this spring's Fraternity Rush, the
fraternity will regain its house at
664 Lomita Drive, Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Heather Dunn said
yesterday.
Rush kicked off last night for the
17 campus fraternities and will run
through April 22.
Because the KAs were unable to
attract enough new members in
last spring's Rush, they lost their
house for this year. All housed fra
ternities must maintain 90 percent
occupancy.
There are currently seven
housed and 10 unhoused fraterni
ties. No fraternity that is currently
housed is in jeopardy of losing its
house, Dunn said.
"Everyone is expecting to get a
full number of pledges this year,"
Interfraternity Council President

Craig Thomas said. "We are confi
dent everyone will keep their hous
es, and we hope that some fraterni
ties might get their houses back as
well."
The KA house holds 52 people,
and, according to IFC Rush Chair
Rob Volkel, the KAs need 35
pledges to fill the house.
Due to the existence of a grand
father clause, fraternities that had
on-campus housing in the 1980s
have the right to retain their hous
es assuming they have enough
members and are in good standing
with the University. Since the KAs
are both "grandfathered" and in
good standing, they can regain
their house next fall if they have
enough members, Dunn said.
Zeta Psi fraternity, which is cur
rently unhoused, Ls in a similar po
sition as the KAs. In the mid-1980s,
the Zetes occupied 353 Campus
Drive, which Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity had until winter quarter. If
the Zetes can acquire enough new
members to fill the 54-person
house, they may regain their house
as early as fall 1997, Dunn said.
"The Zeta Psis are a strong but
small organization," Dunn said.
"We do not anticipate the numbers
this year, but there is a good oppor
tunity for them ... to fill up the
house" for the 1997-98 school year.
The Delta Upsilon fraternity
may also get a house in the near fu
ture, though it will take at least an
other year for them to fill the neces
sary conditions for obtaining a
house.
According to Dunn, the Delts
will also need some time to "re
group" before applying to live in a
house again.
Both the former Beta Theta Pi
and Delt houses will be open to all
students for at least another year.
Due to low membership numbers,
the Betas lost their house for this
year and have since dissolved.
Fraternity Rush brings with it a
few changes this year. In past years
fraternities were allowed to host
two on-campus Rush events per
week and an off-campus weekend
trip, culminating the two weeks of
Rush before Bid Night, April 22.

This setup will still apply for all
fraternities except for the Delts,
who, because of late entry into
Rush, are holding their weekly
Rush events off-campus, most like
ly at nearby hotels.
Another change to this year's
Rush has to do with the Rush moni
tors â€” fraternity members who en
sure that the parties comply with
the rules of Rush. In the past,
housed fraternity members would
monitor Rush events for housed fra
ternities, and unhoused fraternity
members monitored unhoused
Rush events. This year, each Rush
event will include two monitors, one
from a housed fraternity and the
other from an unhoused fraternity.
Fraternities cannot serve alco
hol at any Rush events nor can
members contact Rushees outside
Rush events. Also, during the two
week period, fraternities cannot
throw general parties or have par
ties in conjunction with any sorori
ty on sorority bid night.
"We are looking for a well-man
aged Rush and pledge process,"
Dean of Students Marc Wais said.
"We hope there will be a good fit be
tween students and the organiza
tions."
Due to some changes in the Rush
brochure, Rushees should visit the
fraternity booth in White Plaza this
week, from noon until 1 p.m., to get
an updated list of event locations
and times.
