## Baseball's back-Just give it a chance 
### 
Last Friday I was here at
The Daily, minding my
own business, when out of
the corner of my eye I spotted
the latest issue of Sports Illus
trated. Dated April 8, its cover
boldly proclaimed Kentucky's
NCAA championship victory
over Syracuse.
It almost made me want to
cry.
You see, for a sports fan like
myself, there isn't much reason
to go on living at this time of the
year. With March Madness be
hind us and football season still
months away, there just isn't
much in the world of sports to
get excited about.
Growing up in San Diego, I
never had a NBA team to latch
onto (at least not a legitimate
one — the Clippers did have a
brief stint in town), so I've never
been much of a pro basketball
aficionado. And besides, the
NBA is a bore this year if you're
not a Chicago Bulls fan.
As you can imagine, being
from Southern California I'm
not much of a hockey fan either.
And hey, c'mon — does anybody
actually get worked up over pro
golf or pro tennis? I didn't think
so. All of which brings me to the
topic of this column — baseball.
Lest you forget, baseball is
still considered this country's
national pastime, despite the
fact that 1996 marks the first
full major league season in three
years. The last time baseball
played an entire 162-game
schedule, I was a sophomore in
high school and each league had
only two divisions.
Baseball turned off a lot of
fans two years ago when the

players' union went on strike,
forcing the cancellation of the
playoffs and World Series for
the first time in more than 90
years. Fans felt betrayed and
disillusioned, and many swore
they'd never come back.
I, too, got fed up with the self
ish attitudes of players and own
ers alike, but I knew that even-

tually the game would suck me
right back in.
Well, this spring I've decided
to put all hard feelings aside and
give baseball another chance.
And to all you fans out there, I
encourage you do to the same.
People will say baseball is
boring, baseball is stupid, base
ball is the worst sport to watch
on TV. But anyone who ever
played Little League knows why
this game is so magical, and why
no players' strike, antitrust law
suit or salary dispute will ever
push the game out of the Amer
ican consciousness. Whether it
was tossing warm-up throws be
fore practice, sliding feet-first
into second base on a steal or
taking some cuts at the local
batting cage, baseball always
left you coming back for more.
Of course, most of us don't
play baseball anymore — we
