Ending their home season with
a resounding victory, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team trounced
California's Golden Bears 18-10
Saturday afternoon.
Stanford (5-9 overall, 2-6 NCAA
Division I) had a rocky start, falling
behind 7-4 by halftime. After play
ing their last five games against
eastern schools, the Cardinal need
ed to relearn how to counter the
"run-and-gun" style of the West.
"It took the first half to get used
to playing out here again," said
Cardinal head coach Kay Cow
perthwait. "I'm really glad that
they came out in the second half
fired up and kept the intensity."
In the first half, Stanford and
Cal played a seesaw game, but the
Bears kept the edge. The Bears
scored the first goal and the Cardi
nal couldn't capitalize on opportu
nities to pull ahead. Sophomore
Dara Kaplan was the last Stanford
player to score in the half, tying it
up at 4-4 with 13 minutes remain

According to Cowperthwait,
goalie Elizabeth Franklin played a
big role in keeping the Cardinal in
the game, especially in the first
half. Easing into her new position
over the course of the season,
Franklin's confidence has grown
alonu with her skill level.

"Before spring break I started to
piece it together and today every
thing really came together,"
Franklin said.
"[ln] the first half we just
weren't playing our game, we
weren't playing as a team," said se
nior co-captain Peppie Stephen
son. "There were too many fouls
and we made stupid checks. The
second half was passing — we got
the ball right off the draw."
Stanford roared back into the
game after halftime, scoring a total
of 14 goals to Cal's three.
Kaplan hit quickly, scoring in
the first minute to bring the Cardi
nal within two. With only a forlorn
free position goal from California
sandwiched in between, sopho
more Carole Fakhry added two
more, cutting the Bears' lead down
to one.
Stephenson recovered the ball
after the draw. After a fast break by
junior Hope Holiday, Fakhry again
had possession but failed to con
vert. Senior Hannah Flatau fought
to get the ball, and after passing to
freshman Meg Pearson and onto
Kaplan, the sophomore tied the
score on a free position shot at 8-8
with 22 minutes left in the contest.
Cal would never have the lead
again. After goalie Elizabeth
Franklin denied the next Bear goal,
co-captain Wendy Kula created the
