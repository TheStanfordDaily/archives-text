# Track teams take back seat in Oregon
## Women and men both finish third in tough road meets

There is no place like home.
The Stanford track and field
team would certainly agree after
having two exceptional perfor
mances in a row at the newly reno
vated Cobb Track and Angell Field,
including victories in head-to-head
competition against Air Force and
Wisconsin two weeks ago.
Too bad the Cardinal had to trav
el to Eugene, Ore., last weekend to
face Oregon and Washington State
in a triangular meet.
Taking on powerful Oregon, last
year's Pacific 10 Conference run
ner-up in both men's and women's
competition, is no easy task, as the
Ducks demonstrated by winning
both sides of the meet.
The Stanford women finished
second to Oregon, falling by a score
of 135.5 to 116.5. Meanwhile, the
Cardinal men finished with 100
points, which placed them a distant
third to Oregon. The male Ducks
edged out Washington State 148 to
137.
Oregon put on an impressive dis
play of team balance, as the men
captured victories in 10 of the 19
events and the women won nine of
17. The Ducks placed high in virtu
ally all the events, a key for accumu
lating a high point total. Stanford
men picked up three victories and
the ladies garnered four.
Among the brightest spots for
the Stanford women was freshman
Mary Cobb. In a smooth and delib
erate performance, she blazed to a
time of 4:21.95 in the 1,500 meters,
good enough for both first place and
a NCAA provisional qualification.
Senior Dena Dey finished second by

only a couple blinks of the eyes, at
4:22.17.
"It was a really fast time," Cobb
said. "Overall, I was very happy
with the race. I felt I ran very well
and very strong.
"It was a very smooth race. You
never know how it's going to go, but
at the end I had done everything I
wanted. It went the way I wanted it
to go."
The talented freshman from
Santa Barbara has already provi
sionally qualified for the 3,000, but
also has a shot at the 5,000, an event
in which she finished sixth in the
NCAA indoor championships a
month ago. However, she emphati
cally believes the 1,500 to be her
best event — not to mention her fa
vorite.
"The 1,500 is definitely my pri
ority. I just love that race. It's quick
and really exciting," Cobb said.
On the men's side, sophomore
Adam Connolly anchored a solid
performance by the throwing squad
with his victory in the hammer
throw. His season-best toss of 206
feet-11 inches led a field that includ
ed junior Justin Strand, who placed
third with a throw of 193-8.
In his second meet back, captain
Pete Swanson, a redshirt junior,
finished a solid second in both the
shot put and the discus at 55-6 1/4
and 163-1, respectively.
Other winners included junior
Chris Buddin and sophomore Adam
Fusco. The pair led Stanford to a
one-two finish in the pole vault.
Buddin cleared the bar at 16-4 3/4
while Fusco made 15-11.
Sophomore Jeff Allen took the

meter run last weekend in Oregon.
400-meter hurdles with his time of
53.69.
However, these performances
were not enough to keep Oregon
and Washington State from quickly
distancing themselves from the
Cardinal.
The Stanford women fared bet
ter than their male counterparts.
Along with Cobb, there were three
other winners for the Cardinal.
Tracye Lawyer continued to
demonstrate the extensive
progress she has made in only her
lirst year in collegiate competition
by winning the high jump with a
leap of 5-8 3/4. She had captured

first place in the same event three
weeks ago at the Stanford Invita
tional. Sophomore Katrinka Jack
son placed second with an effort of
5-7.
In another Stanford one-two fin
ish, senior Sue Demars and sopho
more Sami Jo Small hurled the dis
cus 161-6 and 154-0 respectively.
Sophomore Bernadette Armand
sped to first place in the 100-meter
hurdles, a race in which the top
three finishers were separated by
only .07 seconds. Armand came in
at 14.51.
The Cardinal was perhaps only a
couple of freak accidents away from
pulling ofTan encore performance of
last year's upset of Oregon.
Junior tri-captain Tyra Holt, a
versatile athlete who competes in
numerous events every meet, in

cluding anchoring the 4 x 400
relay, pulled up lame with a ham
string injury the day before the
meet.
Another unexpected develop
ment transpired in the 800, where
sophomore Sara Moore was unable
to recover from a fall that occurred
about one quarter of the way into
the race.
The near-upset of the Pac-10 fa
vorite demonstrates the talent of
this year's women team and the pos
sibilities for the future.
"There were some unexpected
things that happened," Cobb said.
"To only lose by 20 points and to
have had all these things happen is
very good.
The Stanford team travels to
Berkeley next week for the Pierce
Golden Bear Challenge.
