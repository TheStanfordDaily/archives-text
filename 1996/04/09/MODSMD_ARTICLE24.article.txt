# Softball captures two from Arizona schools

### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The Stanford softball team (19-18 over
all, 5-9 in the Pacific 10 Conference) went 2-
2 this weekend against two top-20 confer
ence teams. The Cardinal swept No. 20 Ari
zona State but not before losing two great
games to the top-ranked University of Ari
zona (5-0 and 10-3).
The pivotal matchup for Stanford was
Saturday's doubleheader against the Sun
Devils. The Cardinal is just ahead of the
Sun Devils in Pac-10 standings, making a
Stanford victory imperative to its maintain
ing a solid conference standing and receiv
ing a berth to the NCAA post-season tour
nament.
The importance of the 3-1 and 1-0 victo
ries was compounded by the two losses
Stanford suffered to Arizona (5-0 and 10-3)
on the previous night, but the Cardinal an
swered the call with a clean sweep of the
Sun Devils in what was possibly the team's
best performance of the season.
"The Arizona State game was great,"
said head coach Sandy Pearce. "We were a
totally different team tthan we were
against Arizona]. Becky Blevins was domi
nant and our defense played remarkably

well behind her."
Dominant is an appropriate description
of the pitching performance given by the
freshman. Blevins fanned eight Sun Devil
batters in the first four innings and allowed
just one run in the game on six hits and two
walks.
Blevins pitched so well that she also got
the starting nod at the mound for the sec
ond game. In that game, Blevins worked
three full innings before freshman Marcy
Crouch came on in relief to pitch the final
four innings. Blevins and Crouch each al
lowed one hit and one walk in the shutout
victory.
"For our two pitchers to shut them
down like that was the difference in the
game," Pearce said. "I thought one run
wouldn't hold [in the second gamel, but it
did."
The one run came in the top of the sec
ond inning when Kelly Yablonski ripped an
RBI single to drive in Michelle Acosta who
had just reached base on a double.
Unfortunately the Cardinal was not as
successful against the top team in the coun
try. Stanford braved not only the No. 1
Wildcats, but also extremely cold and windy
conditions in Friday's doublehead
er. Pearce noted that the weather
wiis a possible (actor but also credit
ed Arizona for their success all sea
son.
"They're the No. 1 team for a rea
son," Pearce said. "We didn't play
our game. Arizona makes you make
errors, and (with them] one error is
three runs. Becky Blevins pitched a
good first game and did an outstand
ingjob, but if our team isn't playing
with her 100 percent, it's not good."
Simply put, errors crept back into
Stanford's game. Not only did the
Wildcats outhit the Cardinal 21 to
11 in the two games, but they also
committed only one error to Stan
ford's six. Five of the Cardinal errors
came in the second game, which
Stanford lost 10-3. Crouch made her
first appearance at the mound since
shoulder and back injuries restrict
ed her pitching over a month ago
and allowed 13 hits.
Crouch and her teammates have
a non-conference game this week
and then take the week off before
starting their second round of Pac
-10 competition.
