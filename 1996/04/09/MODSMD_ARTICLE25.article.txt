# Stanford takes third at MPSF finals
## Men's gymnastics heads to regionals with slight edge 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
If you think of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) tournament as
a trial run for NCAA West Regional, than
the Stanford men's gymnastics team would
have narrowly edged out Nebraska for the
last berth from the West Region into the
NCAA tournament (which will be held at
Stanford). Unfortunately, although all of
the same teams will compete in the NCAA
West Regional in Lincoln, Neb., this week
end, the stakes were a little bit different this
time.
Stanford placed third at MPSFs with a
total team score of 224.75. California, with
228.97, and Oklahoma, with a total 226.84,
took first and second respectively. Nebras
ka closely followed Stanford with a 224.21.
New Mexico and Brigham Young Universi
ty rounded out the top six, scoring 222.53
and 218.85 respectively.
The Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion tournament determined the teams
that would head to regionals, but the Cardi
nal was not primarily concerned with that.
The gymnasts had their collective eyes set
on showing the NCAA that they are true
contenders who deserve an NCAA tourney
berth.

spring break, the Stanford men trav
eled to Santa Barbara and proved
that the training paid off.
Head coach Sadao Hamada had
predicted a fourth place showing for
t he team, behind Nebraska, but a de
cent performance by the Cardinal
combined with a weak one by the
('ornbuskers to push Stanford into a
third-place finish.
"I was surprised we beat | Nebras
ka). I thought they were a lot
stronger. I was prepared to take
(bird or fourth place," 1 lamada said.
"We did about average — not too
good, not too bad, but coming in
third place was a pretty good accom
plishment."
Hamada highlighted the perfor
mance of freshmen Scott Fin

klestein, who outdid himself with
two strong scores in the pommel
horse (9.55) and high bar (9.7).
"I really felt pretty prepared
going into the meet. After spring
break, 1 felt like I was in really good
condition and as a result I hit my
routines," Finklestein said. "I
hadn't been hittingmy routines very
well (before). I had added confidence
to perform to my best ability."
Junior lan Bachrach put in a
strong performance last weekend as
well. In the individual events, he
placed second in the high bar with a
9.525, third in rings with a 9.525 and
third in the vault with a 9.-1. Senior
team captain Peter Hegi scored a
team and personal high 0f9.8 on the
high bar.
The team must now place in the
top three this weekend in Nebraska,
otherwise they will be forced to
watch the NCAA championships
tournament from their own sideline.
