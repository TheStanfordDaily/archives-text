## Men's gymnastics heads to regionals with slight edge 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
If you think of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) tournament as
a trial run for NCAA West Regional, than
the Stanford men's gymnastics team would
have narrowly edged out Nebraska for the
last berth from the West Region into the
NCAA tournament (which will be held at
Stanford). Unfortunately, although all of
the same teams will compete in the NCAA
West Regional in Lincoln, Neb., this week
end, the stakes were a little bit different this
time.
Stanford placed third at MPSFs with a
total team score of 224.75. California, with
228.97, and Oklahoma, with a total 226.84,
took first and second respectively. Nebras
ka closely followed Stanford with a 224.21.
New Mexico and Brigham Young Universi
ty rounded out the top six, scoring 222.53
and 218.85 respectively.
The Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion tournament determined the teams
that would head to regionals, but the Cardi
nal was not primarily concerned with that.
The gymnasts had their collective eyes set
on showing the NCAA that they are true
contenders who deserve an NCAA tourney
berth.
