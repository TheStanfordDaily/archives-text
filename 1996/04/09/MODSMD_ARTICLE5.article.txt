## New Stanford study says eating right is only half the battle Exercise a must for low cholesterol 
### Laura Lane Contributing writer 
Oat bran. Fish oil. Red wine. What do these items
have in common? They have all been shown to reduce
a person's risk of heart disease. But there is some
thing missing from this list: exercise.
In a recent study, researchers at the Stanford
Center for Research in Disease Prevention examined
the contribution of exercise and diet in reducing the
risk of heart disease. The study, named Diet and Ex
ercise For Elevated Risk, showed that exercise must
be combined with diet to significantly reduce blood
cholesterol levels.
In an effort to find non-pharmaceutical approach
es to heart disease prevention, researcher Marcia
Stefanick observed the effects of exercise combined
with a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet on blood choles
terol levels in people at risk for heart disease. "Our
biggest concern is having people being put on med
ication for cholesterol unnecessarily," explained Ste
fanick.
Currently, the National Cholesterol Education
Program (NCEP), which has recommended choles
terol-lowering diets, does not emphasize the impor-

tance of exercise in cholesterol man
agement. "We're really hoping that
they will give equal weight to the
role of exercise and weight loss,"
Stefanick said. "What we're demon
strating here is that [exercise] is
just as important as the diet."
One-hundred-ninety-seven men
and 180 post-menopausal women
were included in the study. They
had high levels of LDL (bad choles
terol) coupled with low levels of
HDL (good cholesterol). They were
then placed into one of four groups.
The control group had no lifestyle
change; however, the others altered

either their diets, exercise levels or
both diet and exercise habits. After
one year, their blood cholesterol lev
els were again measured and com
pared to those taken in the begin
ning.
Participants in the diet and ex
ercise group significantly reduced
their levels of LDL (bad choles
terol) over the groups that did not
exercise. Men who were dieting and
exercising decreased their LDL lev
els by 10 percent while the corre
sponding group of women de
creased their LDL levels by 7.5 per
cent, compared with the control
group. Those in the diet-only group
did not show a significant drop in
LDL levels.
The other important component
in blood cholesterol levels is HDL

(good cholesterol). Although elevat
ed HDL levels have a protective ef
fect, they did not increase with the
addition of exercise. However, as a
good sign, HDL levels did not de
crease with the low-fat, low-choles
terol diet so that the dieters did re
tain the protection of HDL against
heart disease.
"We are recognizing how impor
tant the role of weight loss is within
the exercise message. If people exer
cise enough to get weight loss then
they will get the benefit. We're hop
ing that people will realize that they
can't just do diet, they can't just do
exercise, they really have to have a
healthy life. They are equally im
portant," said Stefanick.
The dieters in the study were
placed on the NCEP's Step II diet.

which consists of less than 30 per
cent of calories from fat (with less
than 7 percent from saturated fat)
and less than 200 milligrams per
day of dietary cholesterol. Stanford
dietitians, including Dietary Inter
vention Coordinator Sally Mackey,
held classes with the dieters to in
struct them how to follow the spe
cific diet.
The dietitians educated the di
eters on the fat and cholesterol con
tent of frequently consumed foods
as well as suggesting alternate
foods with lower fat contents. The
researchers also made random,
unannounced phone calls to the di
eters to see if they were abiding by
the diet.
Supervised by Exercise Physiol
ogist Mary Sheehan, participants in

the exercising groups met three
times a week to jog or walk briskly
for 45 minutes. They also kept logs
of their activities.
In the initial screening for par
ticipants, it was found that one
fourth of those screened had high
enough LDL levels and low enough
HDL levels to put them at risk for
developing heart disease. Based on
this study, Stefanick estimated t hat
more than 25 percent of the popula
tion are at some risk for heart dis
ease.
In the future, Stefanick hopes to
continue to search for non-pharma
ceutical methods to treat people at
risk for heart disease "so we can fig
ure how to help them come up with
a lifestyle change that benefits their
health," she said.
