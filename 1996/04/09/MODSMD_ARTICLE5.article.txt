In a recent study, researchers at the Stanford
Center for Research in Disease Prevention examined
the contribution of exercise and diet in reducing the
risk of heart disease. The study, named Diet and Ex
ercise For Elevated Risk, showed that exercise must
be combined with diet to significantly reduce blood
cholesterol levels.
In an effort to find non-pharmaceutical approach

Stefanick observed the effects of exercise combined
