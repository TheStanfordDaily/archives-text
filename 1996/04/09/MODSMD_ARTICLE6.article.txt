# Christopher to focus on environment
## 
### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
Announcing the United States' new environ
mental foreign policy is nothing like selling NATO
expansion to the Russians or bringing peace to the
Middle East.
At Stanford today, Secretary of State Warren
Christopher will speak to a hometown crowd with
out the threat of a possible Communist takeover, a
nuclear arsenal or Palestinian militant groups.
The speech, in which Christopher will piece to
gether environmental positions into a concrete pol
icy, will begin at 11 a.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
Formerly chairman of the Board of Trustees, a
Stanford law student and a Stanford parent,
Christopher said he is coming to the auditorium
for more than "sentimental reasons."
"Stanford continues to be in the forefront, in
the vanguard, on environmental issues," Christo
pher said in an interview yesterday.
Attempting to give the United States a lead in
protecting the environment, Christopher is hoping
that not only other countries, but universities, will
similarly reprioritize.
While he did not commit to increasing shrinking
research and development budgetb for environ
mental research, Christopher complimented Stan
ford's environmental programs and predicted
other institutions will devote more resources to en
vironmental innovation.
"When a major department of the government
focuses its resources, it has an effect, not immedi
ately but over time, on the research activities at
universities," he said. "If the United States places
an emphasis on this, then many scholars would
want to follow the train of it."
In his speech, Christopher will reportedly set
priorities for environmental protection in each
continent, request $180 million in federal funding
to support natural resource protection and propose
an international conference on treaty compliance
and enforcement.
"It's timely to take steps to try to make sure the
environment is fully integrated into our foreign
policy in every conceivable way," he said. "We have
done a good job in three years. I think we can do
better."
The new policy is meant to
bring countries together, includ
ing even those, like China, which
have had tense relations with the
United States. Protecting the en
vironment abroad is in the inter
ests of the United States as the
20th century — not President
Clinton's term — concludes,
Christopher said.
"Environmental forces tran
scend boundaries and don't mind
crossing borders," he said. Envi
ronmental destruction "is very se
vere and very compelling and thus
has worried me through the
course of my tenure."
Enforcement of environmen

tal regulations will be done posi
tively, he said. "We have to use
the incentives we have ... in
choosing areas where we're going
to focus our aid," he said. "Coun
tries who are abusing their envi
ronment limit the prospect of
success."
The United States will encour
age the World Hank to set envi
ronmental standards before final
izing aid packages, and the U.S.
representative to t he World Hank
will vote against countries whose
environmental practices are sub
par, he said.
The environment has been a
chief focus of Vice President A 1
Gore's policy, and the State De
partment created a fifth undersec
retary position, designated for
global affairs.
Timothy Wirth, who holds that
position — and whose brother is a

Stanford history professor — will
appear today with Christopher at
a private reception at the Institute
for International Studies. Later,
Christopher will meet with the
Board of Trustees. Following the
speech, five professors, including
former University President Don
ald Kennedy, will discuss the
speech at the Center for Econom
ics and Policy Research.
Despite his Stanford connec
tions, Christopher stopped short
of saying he would use this speech
to start a new tradition. Though
each January, the secretary of
state has given a State of the State
address at. Harvard University,
Christopher said he has no similar
plans for the Farm.
"I haven't come out before be
cause I don't want anyone to ac
cuse me of coming back to the
place I love the most," ho said.
