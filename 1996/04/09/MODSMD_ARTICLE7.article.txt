# ASSU: Only president can OK amendments
## Senators say spring ballot bill about respect 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Council of
Presidents
member Jon
Oram has au
thored a bill to
simplify the
process of get-

ting University approval for
amendments to the ASSU Consti
tution.
In rare across-the-board consen
sus, ASSU senators say the bill is
especially important in light of the
Faculty Senate's recent decision to
exclude students from its Planning
and Policy Board.
The bill — which was passed by
the ASSU Senate in February and
will appear on the spring general
election ballot — requires the Uni
versity president to take official ac
tion within 90 days following the
senate's passage of any measure
that alters its constitution.
"We've had a lot of problems this
year with the ratification process,"
Oram said. "We didn't think it was

appropriate for the president to del
egate the approval of [ASSU Con
stitutional amendments] to admin
istrators below him.
"The fact that there's no time
line specified in the constitution
gives [the administration] a pocket
veto over everything we present to
them. If they don't act on an
amendment, then it can never be
come part of the constitution,"
Oram said.
Last week's Faculty Senate deci
sion to keep students off its board
responsible for researching and
making recommendations about
the University's future raised the
ire of student leaders, who feel the
move indicates a lack of respect for
students.
According to the current ASSU
Constitution, the Board of Trustees
may designate either the president
or another University official to act
on its behalf in accepting ASSU
amendments. ASSU senators, how
ever, said they feel that it is impor
tant that the president himself al

ways be involved in their constitu
tional changes.
"This bill is definitely needed,"
said undergraduate senator Armen
Panossian. Approval of ASSU con
stitutional amendments "should be
at the top so that everyone in the
administration, up to and including
t he Board of Trustees and the pres
ident, Ls aware of what we do in t he
ASSU."
Dean of Students Marc Wais,
who refrained from giving an offi
cial statement in favor or opposed
to the Faculty Senate's recent ac
tions, said, "I can understand why
students are unhappy with the
committee's latest decision. ... My
main concern is that there be active

meaningful student participation
in the [Faculty Senate's policy
making! process."
Calling the provisions in Oram's
bill "more symbolic than substan
tive," Wais said he recognizes the
importance of more intimate in
volvement of the president in ASSU
business.
Assistant to the President Jean
Fetter, who met with Oram as he
was drafting the legislation, said
University President Gerhard
Casper is willing to sign all ASSU
amendments upon the dean of stu
dents' recommendations.
Wais said he is not offended by
the bill, even though the dean of
students has traditionally been the
president's designee for ratifying
amendments passed by the ASSU.
"If it were my responsibility, I
am confident that I would ratify
ASSU amendments in as timely a

fashion as possible. Hut I support
the bill and think the ASSU's ac
tions are well-intentioned," he said.
There is widespread criticism
that the ASSU spends too much
time deliberating over internal pol
itics, which raises questions about
how seriously the administration
takes ASSU business.
Graduate senator Doug Natel
son said he feels the administration
often does not seem to invest much
time or thought into ASSU deci
sions.
"When there are amendments
passed by students, the University
should act on it"in a more timely
fashion than they have done in the
past, he said. "When we go to the
trouble to put through a constitu
tional amendment, students and
the administration should know
that we actually care about the
issue."
