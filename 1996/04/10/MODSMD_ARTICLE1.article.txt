## Christopher cleans up environmental policy in Stanford address 
### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
The environment is a global issue
affecting Americans and the United
States' interests, Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said yesterday,
outlining specific goals to limit envi
ronmental destruction.
Addressing a crowd of about 1,400
in Memorial Auditorium, Christopher
emphasized the necessity of integrat
ing environmental diplomacy into

American foreign policy.
"Our ability to advance our global
interests is inextricably linked to how
we manage the earth's natural re
sources," he said. "That is why we are
determined to put environmental is
sues where they belong: in the main
stream of American foreign policy."
In a meeting at the Institute for In
ternational Studies, which preceded
the speech, Christopher said environ
mental issues "transcend borders"
and bring countries together, even

countries such as China whose rela
tionship with the United States has
been tense.
"You try to talk to the Chinese
about human rights, and they say,
'Not at all.' You talk about prolifera
tion, and they say, 'Maybe but not
now.' But you talk about the environ
ment, and they say, 'Right away,' " he
said.

nounced in the hour-long public
address that the State Depart
ment will issue an annual Global
Environmental Challenges report
each Earth Day beginning next
year.
The reports, which are compa
rable to human rights reports,
will "be an essential tool of our
environmental diplomacy, bring
ing together an assessment of
global environmental trends, in
ternational policy developments
and U.S. priorities for the forth
coming year," Christopher said.
Christopher gave an oral envi
ronmental assessment yesterday,
using environmental dilemmas in
individual regions — such as
water rights in the Middle East
and population swells in Rwanda

to link environmental prob
lems with security and stability.
In some embassies, the United
States will establish Environ
mental Hubs to advance its envi
ronmental goals and help U.S.
businesses sell environmental
technology, Christopher said.
"Our businesses recognize
that pitting economic growth
against environmental protec
tion is what President Clinton
has called 'a false choice,' " he
said. "Both are necessary and
both are closely linked."
Environmental technologies,
Christopher said, constitute a
$400 billion market. He encour
aged non-governmental organi
zations to participate in a "part
nership for environment and for
eign policy."
In addition to discussing the ef
fects of environmental degrada
tion on security and people,
Christopher attempted to frame

environmental abuse as a prob
lem which affects the economy.
Using El Salvador as an example,
he cited the connections among
environmental damage, limited
economic resources and emigra
tion.
Developing countries must
consider environmental factors
and not just economic ones, he
said in response to audience ques
tions.
"I think it's very shortsighted
for them to go hell-bent on the
economy, but it's very seductive
for countries that see economic
growth as the sole goal of their
nation," he said.
Reflecting on a recent trip to
Russia and Ukraine where he vis
ited patients suffering from the
aftermath of the Chernobyl nu
clear explosion, Christopher said
that "economic reforms will not
meet their potential if one-sixth
of the Russian land mass remains

so polluted 112 hat it is unfit even foi
industrial use, and if Russiar
children are handicapped by th<
poisons they breathe and drink."
He said the State Departmen
will seek a multilateral agree
ment to reduce greenhouse gases
and will work on reducing the
detrimental effects of toxic chem
icals.
The enforcement of any envi
ronmental agreement warrants
its own conference, he said, which
the United States will host at th<
end of next year.
In an interview on Monday
Christopher emphasized that en
forcement would be done posi
tively through incentives, and
yesterday he said the standard o!
living cannot be sacrificed
through sanctions.
"It's always a difficult balanct
of concern about the people of the
country wanting to impose sanc
tions or take steps that will send

effective messages to the leaders
of the regime and at the same
time
not impose unnecessary burdens
on the people of the country," he
said.
"We are going to use the re
mainder of 1996 to try to ensure
that 1997 is a banner year on the
environment," he said.
Earlier in the day, Christopher
answered questions and was
briefed by members of the Envi
ronmental Forum, a focus group
by the Institute for International
Studies.
"Environmental concerns and
security issues intersect," Politi
cal Science Prof, and Center for
International Security and Arms
Control Chair David Holloway
told Christopher, citing water as
a way in which environmental
tools can be used in conflict.
"During the Cold War, we
learned it was better to think of

security as mutual security,"
Holloway said. "We will not be se
cure unless others are secure."
Christopher asked for advice
on how best to integrate the envi
ronment into everyday foreign
policy without emphasizing it too
much.
Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich said
the State Department must im
plement the policies it sets in its
speeches.
Offers bv former University
President Donald Kennedy to
help the State Department in the
implementation were well-re
ceived by Christopher and Un
dersecretary for Global Affairs
Tim Wirth.
"We can use some better argu
mentation," Christopher said.
"There has not been enough work
done," adding that the Institute
for International Studies — and
the academic world as a whole —
"can be verv helpful to us."

has called 'a false choice,' " he
said. "Both are necessary and
both are closely linked."
Environmental technologies,
Christopher said, constitute a
$400 billion market. He encour
aged non-governmental organi
zations to participate in a "part
nership for environment and for
eign policy."
In addition to discussing the ef
fects of environmental degrada
tion on security and people,
Christopher attempted to frame

environmental abuse as a prob
lem which affects the economy.
Using El Salvador as an example,
he cited the connections among
environmental damage, limited
economic resources and emigra
tion.
Developing countries must
consider environmental factors
and not just economic ones, he
said in response to audience ques
tions.
"I think it's very shortsighted
for them to go hell-bent on the
economy, but it's very seductive
for countries that see economic
growth as the sole goal of their
nation," he said.
Reflecting on a recent trip to
Russia and Ukraine where he vis
ited patients suffering from the
aftermath of the Chernobyl nu
clear explosion, Christopher said
that "economic reforms will not
meet their potential if one-sixth
of the Russian land mass remains

so polluted 112 hat it is unfit even foi
industrial use, and if Russiar
children are handicapped by th<
poisons they breathe and drink."
He said the State Departmen
will seek a multilateral agree
ment to reduce greenhouse gases
and will work on reducing the
detrimental effects of toxic chem
icals.
The enforcement of any envi
ronmental agreement warrants
its own conference, he said, which
the United States will host at th<
end of next year.
In an interview on Monday
Christopher emphasized that en
forcement would be done posi
tively through incentives, and
yesterday he said the standard o!
living cannot be sacrificed
through sanctions.
"It's always a difficult balanct
of concern about the people of the
country wanting to impose sanc
tions or take steps that will send

effective messages to the leaders
of the regime and at the same
time
not impose unnecessary burdens
on the people of the country," he
said.
"We are going to use the re
mainder of 1996 to try to ensure
that 1997 is a banner year on the
environment," he said.
Earlier in the day, Christopher
answered questions and was
briefed by members of the Envi
ronmental Forum, a focus group
by the Institute for International
Studies.
"Environmental concerns and
security issues intersect," Politi
cal Science Prof, and Center for
International Security and Arms
Control Chair David Holloway
told Christopher, citing water as
a way in which environmental
tools can be used in conflict.
"During the Cold War, we
learned it was better to think of

security as mutual security,"
Holloway said. "We will not be se
cure unless others are secure."
Christopher asked for advice
on how best to integrate the envi
ronment into everyday foreign
policy without emphasizing it too
much.
Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich said
the State Department must im
plement the policies it sets in its
speeches.
Offers bv former University
President Donald Kennedy to
help the State Department in the
implementation were well-re
ceived by Christopher and Un
dersecretary for Global Affairs
Tim Wirth.
"We can use some better argu
mentation," Christopher said.
"There has not been enough work
done," adding that the Institute
for International Studies — and
the academic world as a whole —
"can be verv helpful to us."
