# Pugwash expands Stanford presence
## 
### Shoshana Deutschkron Contributing writer 
Under new student and faculty leadership,
the Stanford chapter of a nationwide organiza
tion concerned with the implications of science
and technology is expanding its on-campus ac
tivities.
Student Pugwash USA, which since 1979
has attempted to facilitate discussion of the eth
ical, social and global effects of science and tech
nology, currently has chapters in more than
120 colleges, universities and high schools.
Pugwash takes its name from the Pugwash
Conferences on Science and World Affairs,
which began in 1957 in Pugwash, Nova Scotia,
and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995. These
conferences were started at the behest of Albert
Einstein and Bertrand Russel in response to
the development of the hydrogen bomb.
This year's first Pugwash-sponsored event
at Stanford, a panel discussion — titled "What
if Anne Frank had Internet Access?" — was
held Monday night in Jordan Hall. The panel,
which was moderated by Computer Science
Prof. Eric Roberts examined the possible posi
tive and negative implications upon society of
potential uses of the Internet.
Panelist Clifford Stoll, author of "Silicon
Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the Informa
tion Highway," said he is skeptical of the "race
to get on the Internet."
"If you want to make a change in society you
must be a member of society," Stoll said. "By
spending hours prowling around the Web and
avoiding doing socially important things, might
it be that the hours spent on-line are hours that

you are not talking to other people and forming
social links to change society?"
Other panelists were more positive about the
Internet's possibilities. Peter Leyden, a fea
tures editor at Wired magazine, said he believes
"although there are dangers, problems and
stumbling blocks, very little is going to happen
on this planet that will be locked out. Technolo
gy will have a great impact on people's lives and
how people are going to communicate."
Because of the way new technology is help
ing to "get word out" faster than ever before,
Leyden said "in the 21st century, technologies
are really going to change the politics of the
world."
Hilary Naylor, a network coordinator at the
San Francisco Amnesty International office,
commended the Internet for its role in quicken
ing response time to reports of torture around
the world. "Amnesty's job is to shine a spotlight
on the jail cell mid say, 'We know what you are
doing.' The sooner we can shine this spotlight,
the better. Use of technology can get action
going quicker," Naylor said.
Panelist Evelyn Pine, former executive di
rector of Berkeley Community Memory, also
highlighted the Internet's ability to dissemi
nate and respond to information quickly. How
ever, Pine cautioned that "the Internet is not
and will never be the thread of hope which con
nects us to each other; what connects us is the
thread of humanity."
The executive director of Student Pugwash
USA, Sandy lonno, flew in from the non-prof
it organization's national headquarters in
Washington, D.C., to attend the panel. Follow
ing the discussion, lonno distributed pledges

to those present which asked signers to use sci
ence and technology "in socially responsible
ways." Itistheorganization'sgoaltoget 1 mil
lion young people to sign the pledges by the
year 2000.
The Stanford chapter of Student Pugwash
USA has maintained a presence on campus for
many years. For the past two years, the Nation
al Chapter Conference of Student Pugwash
USA has been hosted by Stanford.
It was not until this year, however, with the
appointment of President Anna Yusim, a fresh
man, that the chapter's activities have broad
ened their scope. Yusim is on Pugwash's board
of directors, along with the Stanford chapter
president from last year, Rajesh Krishnan,
Class of '95.
Also this year, Roberts became the chapter's
faculty adviser. Roberts, who teaches a course
on computers, ethics and social responsibility
and is president of Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility, said his goal is to get
"more attention paid to the social context of sci
ence." Roberts stressed that developers of sci
ence and technology "must not abdicate re
sponsibilities because then it is not clear that
the public interest is served by the science and
technology."
According to this year's chapter vice presi
dent, Elizabeth Lee, a junior majoring in
human biology, "Before, people involved were
more |Science, Technology and Society], now
that Anna is here things might change a bit be
cause she is more interested in drawing people
in from a wide variety of departments, such as
human biology, biology, STS, engineering and
computer science."
