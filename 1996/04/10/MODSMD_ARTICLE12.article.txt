llnabomber may have known his targets
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Investigators who had long theorized
that the Unabomber chose his targets from books, the media or rad
ical environmental publications have discovered possible direct links
between suspect Theodore Kaczynski and at lea.st four of the victims.
Four of the targets had frequented universities where Kaczyn
ski studied or worked, or had positions in those areas, federal law
enforcement sources said yesterday. And at least two bombs had
written references to people who may also have crossed his path.
"I think the possibility of that is very high — that there was
much more of a personal connection with these people that we
previously had believed," said an investigator who spoke on con
dition of anonymity.
Four victims in the 16 attacks taught at, attended or frequent
ly visited schools where Kaczynski was enrolled or worked.
Defects linked to obesity
CHICAGO (AP) - Obese mothers are at least twice as likely as
thinner women to have babies with debilitating birth defects, two
studies found.
And a vitamin known to help prevent such abnormalities appears
to offer overweight women no protection, the researchers said.
Both studies, published in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association, involved so-called neural tube defects and
women who were obese at concept ion, not those who gained a lot
of weight during pregnancy.
The neural tube defects linked to obesity include spina bifida
an incomplete closure of the spinal column that often results in
paralysis — to anencephaly, in which most of the brain is missing.
The defects annually afflict some 2,500 U.S. babies and an
unknown number of miscarried fetuses.
An estimated 10 percent of women of childbearing age an
obese.
