# President signs line-item veto bill

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In a dramatic shift
of purse-string power, President Clinton signed
a line-item veto bill sought by presidents since
Ulysses S. Grant. He promised unprecedented
scrutiny of "the darkest corners of the federal
budget."
Hut opponents accused Congress of surren
dering a precious piece of its constitutional pre
rogative to spend the people's money. Federal
employees immediately filed a court challenge.
Tipping his hat to Republican mid Demo
cratic predecessors, Clinton kept four pens
used in yesterday's signing and dispatched
them to former Presidents Reagan, Ford,
Carter and Hush — all of whom had pleaded for

the power to slash specific provisions from
spending bills.
"Their successors will be able to use this
power that they long sought to eliminate waste
from the federal budget," said Clinton, who
won't be able to use the line-item veto unless
re-elected.
The bipartisan bill will be a fixture in the
presidential election, with Clinton and Senate
Majority Leader Hob Dole both claiming credit.
"It will help put Washington on a pork-free
diet," Dole said yesterday.
Clinton, who seldom used the line-item veto
as Arkansas' governor, noted that 43 of the
nation's 50 governors can carve away at budget

bills. "They have used it well and without any
upsetting of the constitutional framework,"
Clinton said.
Under the new law, presidents can sign
spending bills and — within five days — cancel
specific items, including appropriations, nar
rowly targeted tax breaks covering 100 or fewer
people and new or expanded entitlements.
It does away with a requirement, in place
since the nation's founding, that a president
must approve or reject legislation in its entire
ty-
Congress still gets the last word on spend
ing: A line-item veto can be overridden by a
two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress.
