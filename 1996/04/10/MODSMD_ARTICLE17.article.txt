Faculty should not
emphasize split between
research and teaching

STAN FORD'S REPUTATION
as a research facility is excep
tional, and research — both
academic and technological
remains an integral aspect of the
school. The Faculty Senate, how
ever, is concerned that (he Univer
sity's excellence in research over
shadows its commitment to under
graduate education. The debate in
the Senate — whether the I niver
sity should create incentives for
professors to teach more under
graduate classes examines
Stanford's role as an institution
focused primarily upon either
research or educating undergradu
ates.
Along with three other plans, the
senate is considering a point sys
tem, which would distribute faculty
time between undergraduate class
es, graduate classes, administrative
service and research. This, some
senators believe, would strengthen
faculty commitment to all aspects
of education, and decrease the
chance that undergraduates would
be neglected in favor of research.
Those opposed, however, say that
this incentive plan is constricting
and the senate should pursue other
incentives — such as monetary
ones — for professors to teach more
undergraduate classes.
Although no decision was
reached in creating an incentive
plan, it is imperative that the Fac
ulty Senate seriously consider the
needs of undergraduates when
creating this policy because it
affects both faculty and students.
If professors must relinquish time
spent on research projects, they
will not be enthusiastic about the
teaching responsibilities forced
upon them. Although it would
mean more undergraduate classes
— and thus more faculty involve

moot in undergraduate alt airs —
uninterested professors are not a
boon to students, and might even
create more distance between stu
dents and faculty.
More important than the specif
ic plans the senate is considering,
however, is that the senate
acknowledge the importance of
undergraduates' role at Stanford.
After last week's decision to
remove student representatives
from the Planning and Policy
Board, the senate seems to want to
distance itself from students.
The senate should concern itself
with maintaining and improving
the educational opportunities
available to students. To do so, the
senate should not create a dichoto
my between faculty research and
undergraduate education. Com
bining the two — and therefore
creating more intellectual interac
tion between students and profes
sors — would benefit everyone
involved.
Considering undergraduates,
therefore, does not mean that
professors must relinquish their
dedication to research. Biology
Prof. Robert Simoni said he
believes placing Stanford in a cat
egory would be detrimental to
both undergraduates and faculty.
"This is not an either-or ques
tion," he said. "Stanford profes
sors both teach and do research
extremely well, and they should
continue to do so." He added that
having a reputation as a great
research institution attracts
strong undergraduate applicants,
which then helps create an excep
tional undergraduate educational
atmosphere.
The Senate should acknowledge
that research can — and should —
be a vital part of undergraduate
education, and thus should not
suppress the faculty's involvement
with research projects. It should,
however, ensure that undergradu
ates benefit from professors'
research by creating a plan that
involves undergraduates more
deeply in the research conducted
bv Stanford faculty.
