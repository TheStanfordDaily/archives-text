## The 						essence of charity 
### 
THE BIBLE SAYS charity begins
at home. At least, that's what the
owner of a local gas station said
when informed that Texaco, the compa
ny he wants to sell his station to, has the
international environmental and human
rights record of napalm and that doing
business with the Burmese military is
like supporting a rabid Doberman in a
kindergarten classroom.
He told the concerned students who
visited him they shouldn't worry about
Burma, East Timor or Los Angeles
when there are people dying left and
right in our own neighboring city. Char
ity begins at home and our backyard is a
mess.
He was right in a sense — and so are
many other people rejecting such
international work on the same grounds
— but I disagree about what both
"home" and "charity" mean.
The "home" — where one should
focus their charity — isn't a set geo
graphical location with a mailing
address It's not as though we should
help people in East Palo Alto and ignore
others in Newport, New York or New
Delhi. Home is where one can make the
most impact. For many, it matches their
geography; for many others, it doesn't.
Home is much less a function of geogra
phy than a function of you — what type
of person you are, the way you lead your
life, the issues that catch your interest,
the skills you have and every character

istic that makes you human.
Furthermore, charity doesn't have a
starting and ending point; it's an ethic
of how to live one's life. "Charity" actu
ally means love of fellow humans —
something that certainly shouldn't be
bound by borders.
Charity also isn't simply a set of easi
ly quantifiable reactive actions: for
example, giving $10 to someone to buy
dinner. It can also be proactive action
working toward systemic change and
working to make all of society more
charitable. As corporations are forced to
consider the social impact of the their
actions in Burma (the most blatant
example of corporate irresponsibility)
they will also learn to consider the social
impact of their actions in the United
States. Boycotting historically callous
corporations such as Pepsi or Texaco
isn't just charity for the sake of 40 mil
lion Burmese, it's charity for the sake of
everyone in society harshly impacted by
corporate irresponsibility.
To exemplify my definition of home,
consider racism. As a white male from
New England, the home I need to per
form my charity is within the white
elite. I can organize there and have my
voice heard. Most people can't. If I spent
the summer in Mississippi, I'd accom
plish much less than if I talked to a
neighbor who runs a bank and told him
about the benefits of investing in poor
communities. I shouldn't be trying to

organize youth in East Palo Alto to
resist oppression; while I should support
such efforts, I should focus my energy
on the segments of society that cause
such oppression.
For the gas station owner, his home is
largely his station and position in the oil
industry, and that's where a large part
of his charity and goodwill should start.
He could help humanity much more by
demanding Texaco clean up its act (both
internationally like in Burma and
domestically like in Los Angeles) than
he could by sending a percentage of his
profits to help the homeless in East Palo
Alto. I lis life and talents have given him
an opportunity to do good that very few
of us can, and he needs to seize that
opportunity instead of disregarding it
because of superficial geographic lines.
No gas station ever has canceled or
conditioned a contract with Texaco
because of their record in Burma, nor do
I think anyone has done it because of
Los Angeles, Ecuador or anywhere else
with Texaco's black star on them. Doing
so would be a difficult financial decision,
but this owner could be on the cusp of
something huge and true to charity in
its essence.
