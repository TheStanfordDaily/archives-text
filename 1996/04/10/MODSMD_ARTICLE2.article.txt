Undersecretary for Global Affairs Tim Wirth pre
dicted more cooperation between the United States
and developing countries on environmental issues at
a panel held yesterday in conjunction with Secretary
of State Warren Christopher's address at Stanford.
Wirth was one of six panelists at a forum at the
I Center for Economic Policy Research, which followed
Christopher's speech. Wirth, who was appointed by
President Clinton and is the first person to hold the of
fice of undersecretary for global affairs, accepted
questions and elaborated on the State Department's
environmental policy.
1 The issue that generated the most questions was
1 that of the United States influencing the behavior of

China. One questioner said that
since the Chinese have not been re
sponsive to American pressure on
trade issues, he doubted they would
respond on environmental issues.
Wirth said the Chinese would be
sensitive to environmental pressure
out of "raw self-interest." He said
"there Ls no question in IMeijing's]
mind that they're in deep environ
mental trouble," and that "China
has so many environmental prob
lems that they're asking us for
help." Ile praised the proposals that
the Chinese government produced
at the World Environmental Sum
mit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
The idea that the Chinese will
continue to be responsive to envi
ronmental issues was echoed by
Population Studies Prof. Paul
Ehrlich, a panelist, who noted that
('hina was one of the first countries
in the world to attempt to solve |>op
ulat ion problems.
Ehrlich, who called Christo
pher's address "a stunningly good
speech," said the West "hasn't done
all the things it should have to help"
Chinese commitment to the envi
ronment

He cited the need for the West to
come up with power generation al
ternatives that would make the Chi
nese less dependent on coal and nu
clear power.
Audience members also asked
about the role of American corpora
tions and government agencies in
international environmental policy.
Wirth sharply disagreed with a
questioner who was concerned that
American business was moving its
polluting operations to countries
with lax environmental standards.
Accordingto Wirth, multination
al corporations "are taking with
them a higher environmental stan
dard rather than moving to the low
est common denominator."
A problem does exist, Wirth said,
in the practice of dismantling older
American factories and plants and
re-assembling them in developing
countries. Wirth said the result is
plants that are not environmentally
sound enough to pass muster in the
United States but are actually above
the prevailing standards in China
and other countries where they
were rebuilt.
Another major area of discussion
was internal American politics. A
questioner brought up the implica
tions of partisan politics for the de
partment's environmental work.
Wirth acknowledged that there

are areas where the Republican
Congress and some independent
agencies are causing "inconsisten
cy" in U.S. environmental policy.
He cited the Treaty on Biodiversity
that has yet to be approved by the
Senate, saying that Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., the chairman of the
Senate's Foreign Relations Com
mittee, has made it clear that the
treaty will not pass his committee
during his tenure as chairman.
Wirth deplored this stance.
He noted that environmental
politics worked best when it is not a
partisan issue, adding that he's en
couraged by increasing moderation
among Congressional Republicans.
Former University President
I)onald Kennedy, who is a professor
of environmental sciences, was on
the panel and noted that most of the
initiatives Christopher had raised
do not require the cooperation of
Congress.
"In terms of statutory capacity, I
don't think there's much [Clinton]
needs from Congress," Kennedy
said.
The faculty members at the
panel included Ehrlich, Kennedy,
Biology Prof. Marcus Feldman, Po
litical Science Prof. David Holloway
and Rosamond Navlor, a fellow at
the Institute for International
Studies.
