## Stanford politics — coming down from High Street 
### 
For the duration of six
months of my junior year, I had
little doubt that Stanford Uni
versity was a place that eared about
me. I lived in a warm and spacious
house, kept tidy by both residents and
cleaning help, and populated with
undergraduates full of energy and
well-informed thoughts on the
midterm Congressional elections. The
Stanford staff spent its entire working
day helping its clients cope with the
various oddities of student life
reminding us about looming deadlines
for filing housing applications, doling
out small necessities like stamps and
maps and serving hut tea each day
when students returned from soccer
practice or the library. A faculty mem
ber found people who were willing to
teach courses custom-made by the stu
dents themselves. None of my classes
exceeded 15 students - the majority of
them, in fact, had a teacher-student
ratio of 1:1. And no course sign-ups
were required.
Where on Mayfield Avenue can this
educational fantasyland lie found? As
far as I know, nothing resembling it
exists on the 8,200 acres of sun
drenched farmland we call Stanford. It
took me 12 hours and a few thousand
miles before I arrived at (if) High Street
in Oxford, England, and discovered a

slice of Stanford inviolably focused on
and committed to its core constituents:
students.
I've been back for just over a year
now, but High Street never seemed
more distant than last Thursday, when
Stanford's august governing body, the
Faculty Senate, resolved by the margin
of a single vote to rebuke its own com
mittee's recommendation to add stu
dent members to the Planning and Pol
icy Board. When this year's senate
chair, Gail Mahood, broke a deadlocked
16-16 tie on the proposal, students -
to borrow the parsimonious parlance of
a Branner dinner conversation — got
screwed. Defenders of the senate deci
sion cited the extreme "confidentiali
ty" of certain matters that the enor
mously influential planning board con
siders, as if no student is immune from
leaking sensitive University informa
tion to The Stanford Review or anti-
Pepsi protesters. In private, faculty
members no doubt heaved sighs of
relief that at least one University com
mittee was safe from mouthy under
grads who occasionally dangle partici
ples and rollerblade to meetings.
I found it ironic, or maybe oddly fit
ting, that the senate's decision more or
less coincided with the happy occasion
of the annual mailing of acceptance let
ters to America's finest high school

seniors. No time of year features so
many back-slapping, self-congratulato
ry bromides about this or the other
school's commitment to diversity and
self-generated undergraduate research.
And at no other time (that I can recall)
have the inevitable boasts of a "stu
dent-friendly"' campus contradicted
with recent events. To wit:
• May 1994: Despite the opposition
of nearly two-thirds of Stanford stu
dents — including their reputed repre
sentatives, the Council of Presidents
the Faculty Senate passes a cranky,
punitive new grading policy (authored
by Mahood) which brings back the
'NP,' (nee 'F'), not to mention the Uni
versity's reportedly sullied reputation.
• April 1995: Administrators, this
time with the assent of elected student
representatives, terminate the wonder
fully spontaneous, semi-traditional
procession of seniors into Stanford
Stadium before commencement. The
procession is subsequently dubbed
"The Wacky Walk," and is reinstated
at least for another year — after a
White Plaza protest complete with a
pony keg and shucked clothing.
• Anytime, Anyplace: Students con
front myriad and mounting bureau
cratic nuisances — most described and
justified, simply, as "the rules." They
range from $50 fines incurred for sub

mitting tuition payments a day late to
freshman advisers who know more
about the hottest technology stocks
than the differences among CIV tracks
to the strangely inflated prices of soft
drinks in dining halls to the mystifying
disappearance of student loan checks
in Old Union.
Most students, 1 suspect, have
rather reasonable demands. They want
to attend a university in which one
need not worry about services and
perquisites vanishing absent some
thing resembling a democratic hearing.
As in any democracy, carps in dormito
ries and on editorial pages focus blame
on elected representatives for not
fighting for Things That Matter,
instead indulging in political posturing
and infighting. And so with each spring
arrives a new dose of constitutional
amendments and special-fee blood
baths intended to restore the diseased
body politic, or at least lower our quar
terly dues.
To be sure, most activities conduct
ed by ASSU apparatchiks border on the
absurd. But at times, their voices have
a cracking courage. At Thursday's
meeting, the ex-officio student mem
bers of the Faculty Senate made force
ful statements against the senate's
intention to drop students from the
policy board. Later, they forced a

recount of the first floor vote when it
initially appeared that they had pre
vailed.
The unfortunate truth is that we
can't expect such acumen on a regular
basis. Nor should we anticipate that
tenured faculty members and adminis
trators will, all at once, resolve to give
students a dynamic and central role in
the shaping of Stanford's future. I
think they might, if students in greater
numbers — and in organizations out
side of the AS.SU Senate — prove that
they, too, share investment in the com
munity and care about the course it
charts. Some evidence of solidarity anil
vigilant group responsibility must
emerge before our instructors begin to
regard us and our seemingly trifling
complaints with any degree of serious
ness.
Perhaps some in the Faculty Senate
knew on Thursday that a grand sum of
20 students have applied to fill 1(5 posi
tions on the five University and ASSU
committees created this year. No argu
ment against student representation is
stronger than those depressing figures.
You pay for what you get. Life on High
Street is nice, but sooner or later, you
have to come down.

more distant than last Thursday, when
Stanford's august governing body, the
Faculty Senate, resolved by the margin
of a single vote to rebuke its own com
mittee's recommendation to add stu
dent members to the Planning and Pol
icy Board. When this year's senate
chair, Gail Mahood, broke a deadlocked
16-16 tie on the proposal, students -
to borrow the parsimonious parlance of
a Branner dinner conversation — got
screwed. Defenders of the senate deci
sion cited the extreme "confidentiali
ty" of certain matters that the enor
mously influential planning board con
siders, as if no student is immune from
leaking sensitive University informa
tion to The Stanford Review or anti-
Pepsi protesters. In private, faculty
members no doubt heaved sighs of
relief that at least one University com
mittee was safe from mouthy under
grads who occasionally dangle partici
ples and rollerblade to meetings.
I found it ironic, or maybe oddly fit
ting, that the senate's decision more or
less coincided with the happy occasion
of the annual mailing of acceptance let
ters to America's finest high school

seniors. No time of year features so
many back-slapping, self-congratulato
ry bromides about this or the other
school's commitment to diversity and
self-generated undergraduate research.
And at no other time (that I can recall)
have the inevitable boasts of a "stu
dent-friendly"' campus contradicted
with recent events. To wit:
• May 1994: Despite the opposition
of nearly two-thirds of Stanford stu
dents — including their reputed repre
sentatives, the Council of Presidents
the Faculty Senate passes a cranky,
punitive new grading policy (authored
by Mahood) which brings back the
'NP,' (nee 'F'), not to mention the Uni
versity's reportedly sullied reputation.
• April 1995: Administrators, this
time with the assent of elected student
representatives, terminate the wonder
fully spontaneous, semi-traditional
procession of seniors into Stanford
Stadium before commencement. The
procession is subsequently dubbed
"The Wacky Walk," and is reinstated
at least for another year — after a
White Plaza protest complete with a
pony keg and shucked clothing.
• Anytime, Anyplace: Students con
front myriad and mounting bureau
cratic nuisances — most described and
justified, simply, as "the rules." They
range from $50 fines incurred for sub

mitting tuition payments a day late to
freshman advisers who know more
about the hottest technology stocks
than the differences among CIV tracks
to the strangely inflated prices of soft
drinks in dining halls to the mystifying
disappearance of student loan checks
in Old Union.
Most students, 1 suspect, have
rather reasonable demands. They want
to attend a university in which one
need not worry about services and
perquisites vanishing absent some
thing resembling a democratic hearing.
As in any democracy, carps in dormito
ries and on editorial pages focus blame
on elected representatives for not
fighting for Things That Matter,
instead indulging in political posturing
and infighting. And so with each spring
arrives a new dose of constitutional
amendments and special-fee blood
baths intended to restore the diseased
body politic, or at least lower our quar
terly dues.
To be sure, most activities conduct
ed by ASSU apparatchiks border on the
absurd. But at times, their voices have
a cracking courage. At Thursday's
meeting, the ex-officio student mem
bers of the Faculty Senate made force
ful statements against the senate's
intention to drop students from the
policy board. Later, they forced a

recount of the first floor vote when it
initially appeared that they had pre
vailed.
The unfortunate truth is that we
can't expect such acumen on a regular
basis. Nor should we anticipate that
tenured faculty members and adminis
trators will, all at once, resolve to give
students a dynamic and central role in
the shaping of Stanford's future. I
think they might, if students in greater
numbers — and in organizations out
side of the AS.SU Senate — prove that
they, too, share investment in the com
munity and care about the course it
charts. Some evidence of solidarity anil
vigilant group responsibility must
emerge before our instructors begin to
regard us and our seemingly trifling
complaints with any degree of serious
ness.
Perhaps some in the Faculty Senate
knew on Thursday that a grand sum of
20 students have applied to fill 1(5 posi
tions on the five University and ASSU
committees created this year. No argu
ment against student representation is
stronger than those depressing figures.
You pay for what you get. Life on High
Street is nice, but sooner or later, you
have to come down.
