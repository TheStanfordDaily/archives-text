# Overhauling the ASSU Constitution: A single president
## One executive leads best 
### Jon Oram 
MY RESUME SAYS that I am Stanford's
student body president. Now, factually,
that's true. This is indeed my title. 1 am
one of four members of the COP. But of course, I
don't write "COP" on my resume. I wouldn't want
to have to explain how complicated, bureaucratic
and schizophrenic our executive branch really is.
The purpose of any executive branch of govern
ment is to carry out policy decisions and to provide
an authority which can speak on behalf of all con
stituents. It does not exist to allow every group to
be directly represented; it does not act as a delib
erative body.
Truth be told, it's not the people in the ASSU
who plague student government. It's the institu
tion itself. The COP is supposed to provide leader
ship, to set an example for the legislative and
financial branches. Yet even within the COP, inter
nal lack of communication, misunderstandings and
personal disagreements often prevent us from

effectively serving students.
So, how would a single presi
dent be an improvement?
The current structure of the
COP inhibits any single member
from exerting leadership within
the council or on any particular
issue. Demands for "consensus"
and "power sharing" among
members who claim to represent
similar viewpoints but who dis
agree on the specifics limit the
flexibility and the voice of stu-

dent government. We spend all our time arguing
over issues, not acting on them, in a feeble attempt
to find a solution we all support and can take credit
for. It wastes time and effort, and often makes many
problems not worth tackling.
Student government should provide incentives
for leadership and responsiveness to student needs.
The structure of the executive branch, then, should
remove obstacles that limit what students, hot!) in
and out of the ASSU, can do on behalf of all of us.
So who are the members of t he COP? Come on,
before you saw that picture of me in the upper
right-hand corner, I'll bet you had no idea who I
was. How many COP members can you name? I
doubt you can name all four. Even if you can, do
you know who's responsible for what issues? Who
deals with issues involving faculty? How about
graduate issues? Any idea?
The truth is, responsibilities within the COP
are so diffuse that different people are working on

di versi ty of op in ion s
is the equivilent of

president.'

different things all the
time. One advantage of
this system is that if a
controversial issue comes
up, one in which the
ASSU has not performed
well, any member of the
COP can claim, "It
wasn't me! The other guy
was responsible for that!"
A single president

would be accountable â€” to the senate, the admin
istration and the student body. If the president
was recognized and known by all, when something
went wrong, we'd all know who to turn to. If he or
she screwed up, we'd have an actual person to
blame, not just a nebulous COP. A single president
would be accountable to the student body for each
and every action of the ASSU, and, as a result,
more likely to be responsive to student demands.
Over and over again I'm reminded how little
respect the ASSU has earned over the years. At. a

senate meeting, University Pres
ident Cerhard Casper referred
to the ASSU as an illegitimate
body. Nearly every day, The
Daily's editorials remind us liovv
incompetent we are.
As things stand now, with four
members of the C( )P, t he admin
istration never knows who it's
supposed to deal with. Some
COP members deal with certain
issues, some with others. One
week one member might come to

a committee meeting, only to be replaced by his
cohort at the next. How is the ASSU supposed to
build a working relationship with the administra
tion given this structure? 1 low can we expect t hem
to respect us? It's no wonder people think we're
illegitimate. To some extent, wo are.
A COP with a diversity of opinions is the equiv
alent of a schizophrenic president. It's that simple.
II we had a single president, not only could we
eliminate tliroe COP salaries, but also the bureau
cracy and conflict that limit what student govern
ment can do for you.
It's pretty much intuitive you can't have four
people running an organization. Could you imag
ine four (ierhard (Jaspers running this 11niversity?
It's an absurd idea, yes, but that's exactly what
the ASSU has right now.
