# COP is superior concept

### Rich Stolz 
I" T'S EASY TO pass off the concept of a single
president for the ASSU as a reform simply
■ because it is new and different, but has any
one yet asked what we would lose if we aban
doned the COP?
We would lose consensus leadership, an execu
tive that is inherently forced to take into account
the needs of Stanford's many constituent parts
and communities and an emphasis on inclusive
ness.
1 have heard people in favor of a single presi
dent speak of some idealized image of a single,
macho and charismatic generalissimo who will
lead the student body and the ASSU as an insti
tution into some kind of hallowed greatness. It's
a naive notion to think that single executives lead
to better leaders. It's also naive to believe that a
single president will solve intra-ASSU conflict.
The truth is, any situation with strong personal
ities present can lead to either conflict or cohe-

sion. And naive notions don't
make presidents.
A single president for' the
ASSU won't mean more
accountability, efficiency or
governance. None of these qual
ities are inherently associated
with a single executive. In fact,
reality has demonstrated other
wise. So imagine for a moment
an ASSU that is not more
accountable or efficient than
the current ASSU, and add to it

the following qualities: unoriginal, less represen
tative and less productive. All this with a single
president.
By diminishing the executive from a council to
a single president, the student body will also lose
diversity in its leadership. The perspectives that
different people on equal footing can bring to a
decision-making process are vital to quality
choices.
Through the COP, the ASSU institutionally
recognizes the diverse nature of the student
body: graduate and undergraduate, different eth
nicities, economic backgrounds, departmental
affiliations. The ASSU's executives are best posi
tioned among students to have an impact on this
University. They must be representative of Stan
ford's diversity.
A single president would be able to do only one
quarter of what the four members of Ihe ('< )P are
able to do. Perhaps more importantly, a single

71 single president
for the ASSU icon 7
mean more account
a b i lity, efficiency
or governance.'

president would probably
find the majority of her
time spent dealing with
administrative details.
The establishment of a
single executive shifts
the role of the president
away from engaged stu
dent advocacy toward
procedurally oriented
bureaucracy.

The advantage of having a council is the distri
bution of duties it allows. The COP is able to
adapt its student schedules to the needs of the
ASSU, whiit not sacrificing their studies. A coun
cil of four presidents is best prepared to deal with
t he wide ranging issues on which they must con
tinuously act.
In the ASSU, the biggest obstacle to effective
student representation is the amount of time stu
dents can afford to spend for their University's
student government at the risk of harming their

acadmic careerss.
The ASSU is a large organiza
tion involving dozens of
employees, a banking system,
several different offices and
hundreds of details that often
get set aside simply because
there is no time to pursue
them. The ASSU is also a stu
dent-interest lobbying group
designed to bring the concerns
of students to the faculty and
administration of the Universi-

ty. There are dozens of different demands made
of the COP every day, and the vast majority of
them are not glamorous or newsworthy but
important nonetheless.
Rather than discuss how the ASSU can repre
sent students more effectively, the debate has
centered on how we can make the ASSU bureau
cracy more efficient. Rather than address the
procedural roadblocks which frustrate students'
efforts to be productive student advocates, we're
faced with a proposed constitution that's more
procedurally oriented than ever.
Finally, by losing the council we will be losing
something genuinely unique to Stanford stu
dents: a Council of Presidents. It's become a tra
dition, one of a hand till of living traditions that
can be associated only with Stanford.
