## Baseball stumbles in loss to San Jose State

San Jose St. 8

Last night, the Stanford
baseball team traveled down
Highway 101 to face South Bay
opponent San Jose State at Mu
nicipal Stadium. The short trip
home probably seemed like a
long one for the Cardinal (23-
13), who dropped an 8-6 deci
sion to the Spartans (22-18).
The non-conference loss was
the first for Stanford since Feb
ruary 16 when the Fresno State
Bulldogs were 16-1 victors over
the Cardinal. The road ahead
gets no easier for Mark Mar
quess and his 12th-ranked
squad, as Stanford squares off
with Pacific-10 Conference
Southern Division front-runner
USC this weekend at Dedeaux
Field. San Jose State has been a
thorn in the side of the Cardinal,

as the Spartans won for the fifth
straight time against Stanford
in the past three years.
In their only meeting of 1996,
Stanford came out of the gates
fast, plating three runs and
loading the bases before San
Jose State's Jason Davis could
record an out. Davis (5-2)
worked out of the early jam,
however, and went on to surren
der three runs and six hits in
three innings to pick up the win.
The night was one of squan
dered opportunities for the Car
dinal, as the offense loaded the
bases with no outs again in the
top of the fifth inning, but again
could not push any runs across.
Trailing 7-4 with a Stanford
runner on every base, Josh
Hochgesang, Fric Sees and Joe
Kilburgall struck out to end the
threat.
Stanford starter J.D. Bram
mer (0-2), making his first start
of the year, was roughed up
early and lasted just 1 2/3 in
nings. Trailing 3-0, Spartan
Patrick Walsh stroked a two-
run home run in the bottom of the
first to cut the deficit. The next in
ning, Walsh drove in three more
runs, producing a two-out, bases
loaded triple to chase Brammer
and give San Jose State a 5-4 lead.
If the Cardinal can find a posi
tive in last night's defeat, it is the
return of All-American A.J. 11 inch
to the field. Hinch, who will be
Team USA's catcher this summer
at the Olympic Games in Atlanta,
had been the team's designated
hitter since injuring his throwing
shoulder in a game against Santa
Clara in early February. Hinch,
who had recently estimated a re
turn to the defensive lineup in late
April, played the entire game be
hind the plate.
Offensively, centerfielder Jody
Gerut and second baseman Brian
Dallimore swung the bat well for
Stanford, picking up three hits
apiece. Gerut turned in a 3-for-5
effort, knocking out a single, a
double and a triple. The freshman
improved his batting average to
.298 and scored three of the Cardi
nal's runs. Gerut leads the team
with four triples on the season.
Dallimore tfillied three RBIs on
the evening and laced a pair of
doubles.
Stanford faces USC in a three
game series beginning Friday. The

last time the two squads met, five
weeks ago, the Trojans swept
I hree from Stanford at Sunken Di
amond, leaving the Cardinal with
a IMS conference record. Since that
time, Stanford has won three

straight Six-Pac series to go 7-2 ii
league play and 9-3 overall.
USC stands in first place in the
conference with a 14-4 record ii
the Six-Pac, while the Cardinal i;
currently four games back at 10-4
