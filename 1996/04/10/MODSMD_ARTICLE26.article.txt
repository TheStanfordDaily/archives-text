# Golf wins U.S. Collegiate for first time in 32 years
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
After a disappointing and diffi
cult winter, the Stanford men's
golf team is just starting to warm
up, and head coach Wally Goodwin
couldn't have asked for better tim
ing.
With less than a month before
the start of the postseason, the
17th-ranked Cardinal has begun
to pick up momentum, steam
rolling its competition at the na
tionally-televised U.S. Collegiate
Championships last weekend in
Santa Cruz, Calif., to take the title
for the first time in 32 years.
"It was great," Goodwin said.
"We really just whipped a lot of the
teams coming out of our district
and that always makes me feel
good about our postseason
chances."
The squad's performance was
anchored by spectacular individ
ual showings from its three top
players. Freshman Joel Kribel
headlined the three-man show,
bouncing back from an awful out
ing a week ago at Southern Cal to
finish second overall with a seven
under-par, '209. Only a phenome
nal final round score of 64 by San
Jose State's Arron Oberholser
prevented Kribel from taking the
individual crown.
"Joel had a really excellent
tournament, especially for a fresh
man," Goodwin said. "His only
weak spot lies in his lack of experi
ence, but that should take care of
itself as he matures.

"He's a great golfer now, but
he's going to be absolutely awe
some as a junior and senior."
All-everything sophomore
Tiger Woods trailed Kribel by
three strokes to finish in third
place. Currently the top-ranked
collegian in the nation, Woods
continued on a season-long tear
which has found him near the top
of the leader board in every tour
nament the team has competed in.
"People have pretty much come
to expect the very best out of
Tiger," Goodwin said, "and he's
continued to produce day in and
day out."
Rounding out an unbelievable
two-three-four finish for the Car
dinal was senior captain Jerry
Chang, who placed fourth after
firing a three-under-par, 213.
"I have never seen a finish like
that in all the time that I've been
coaching," Goodwin said. "We've
had plenty of times when three of
our guys would do really well, but
to finish with three guys in the top
four is amazing."
At the vastly improved four and
five spots, junior Conrad Ray and
sophomore Eri Crum teamed up
to produce one of the most promis
ing outings all season. Ray, who
has solidified his position on the
varsity squad with strong perfor
mances in the past few weeks, re
covered from a rough first round
to post scores of 73 and 72 to fin
ish.
"I like to see those kind of
scores out of my players," Good
win said. "It's always better to
have the scores improving as the
tournament goes on.
"Conrad's last couple of scores
really helped us."
Goodwin was similarly pleased
with Crum, who, in his first ap
pearance as a varsity starter, pro
duced a very respectable three
round total of 228.
"Eri played a great little game
for us in his first time out," Good
win said. "He really got in there to
be competitive."

Perhaps most remarkable
about the team's performance,
however, was its reaction to the
adversity and pressure surround
ing the ESPN broadcast of the
event. Having folded when faced
with distraction earlier in the
season, the Cardinal showed re
markable resiliency, taking a
two-hour shift in the start time of
the final round and the resulting
inability to warm up adequately
in stride.
"I was very pleased with our
mental effort," Goodwin said. "We
really learned a lesson about
adapting and, hopefully, we can
duplicate t his type of performance
again throughout the rest of our
season."
