BERKELEY, Calif. - In the
first half his No. G singles match
yesterday at Hell man Tennis Cen
ter, California's Nathan Jackmon
was dominating his opponent,
Stanford junior Grant Elliott.
"I was whupping his ass," Jack
mon said. "I was in that ass like a
wedgie."
Indeed, Jackmon had staked
himself to a 6-1, 5-4 lead, and was
serving for the match and the op
portunity to prevent the No. 2-
ranked Stanford men's tennis team
(17-2,5-1 in the Six-Pac) from win
ning its decisive fourth match of
the day.
Then the Bear sophomore fell
apart. Failing to make any first
serves during the first four points
of the game, he allowed Elliott to
work the point to deuce. When
Jackmon managed to get to match
point, he finally produced a good
serve — a high kicker. Elliott, how
ever, responded with what Jack
mon called "an awesome forehand
winner down the line." It was the
kind of shot that can take the wind
out of even the best competitors,
the kind of shot that makes one
wonder if there is any way he can
ever put away his feisty opponent.
"Once I got that break he kind of
crumbled," Elliott said.
Three straight breaks to open
the third set gave Elliott a 1-6, 7-5,
6-3 victory, and clinched the team
victory for the Cardinal.
Elliott's comeback took on
added importance when No. 53-
ranked Jim Thomas was defeated
by Cal's Bobby Mahal, 5-7,6-2,6-4,
in the No. 2 singles match. Had
Mahal's win been coupled with a
victory by Jackmon, then the team
score would have stood at 3-3 head
ing into the final match of the day,
ajate-starting indoor match in
which No. 5-ranked Jeff Salzen
stfein used the luster surface to de
feat Cal's Casey Louie, 6-2, 6-4.
Thomas was hobbled during his
match by what he described as "an
ugly toenail." But Mahal thought
the injury actually helped Thomas'
game because it accentuated the
Cardinal senior's frustratingly me
thodical style of play.
"Jim was even tougher for me to
play today than previously," Mahal
said, "because his injury caused
him to use even more time than
usual between points."
The day began with a glimmer of
hope for the No. 15-ranked Bears
(7-8, 0-6), as their No. 2 doubles
team of Jackmon and Mahal de
feated Salzenstein and Ryan
Wolters, 8-6. Meanwhile, Stanford
was down a break in No. 1 doubles,
and on serve in No. 3 doubles.
But the Cardinal quickly shut

Cal got on the board quickly in

No. 5 singles, where a patient Sut
ton notched Cal's first point of the
day with a 6-4,6-0 defeat of Becker.
But Stanford took the load for
good when the No. 27-rankod Gold
stein's defeated Raizadeh in No. 3
singles, 6-2, 6-2. Goldstein's victory
was keyed hv ability to keep the ball
deep consistently and volley with
amazing touch.
Freshman sensation Wolters

match against Chris Santoso, 6-4,
6-2.
After ;i long weekend against
UCLA and USC, the Cardinal suc
cessfully avoided a letdown against
a traditionally scrappy team from
Berkeley.
