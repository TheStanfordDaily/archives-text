## ESPN remains the best around 
### 
It's not "NYPD Blue," "ER," "Party of
Five" or "Seinfeld." It's not "Chicago
Hope," either. No, the best show on tele
vision right now is ESPN's Sportscenter.
Night in, night out, ESPN produces
Sportscenter, a sjx>rts show that is informa
tive, accurate, insightful, and above all, en
tertaining. It doesn't matter who the hosts
are or what games were played that night —
just like "Cheers", there is never a bad
episode of Sportscenter.
I would also argue that ESPN's live cover
age of sports is far superior to any of the other
networks. This became painfully obvious
during March, when CBS's coverage of the
men's tournament paled in comparison to
ESPN's similar coverage of the women's
tourney. Everything was better on ESPN —
the announcers were better prepared, Robin
Roberts far exceeded CBS's Pat O'Brien as a
studio host, and, most importantly, on ESPN
y< >ii never missed an important play to see an
other car commercial with freaky little grem
lins. All of this simply led me to believe that
CBS stands for "our Coverage of Basketball
Sucks."
But I digress — the topic here is Sports
center. The show has had many hosts over
the years, some staying for years, others de
porting soon after arrival. Despite the
turnover, t here always seems to be a cult fol
lowing of the show, especially of the "Big
Show" (10 p.m. EST with Dan Patrick and
Keith Olberman) and the "Feel Good Edi
t ion" (2 a.m. EST). The intelligence and witof
the shows' anchors always permeates their
performances, and many of their analyses,
jokes, and catch-phrases have invaded and
dictated popular sports culture. I know you
probably have your favorite anchors and
catch-phrases, but I thought I would share
the sayings I believe have Ixvome (or should
Invome) indispensable in the sports world.
Chris Berman became the first national

star to emerge from the depths of the Bristol,
Conn., studios and make a name for himself
by making up names for others — "Berman
isms." Classic names include Bert "be home"
Blyleven, Jose "won't you let me take you on
a sea" Cruz and Tim "purple" Haines. In ad
dition, Berman patented perhaps the most
famous home run call of them all: "Back,
back, back, back, back, back, back and
GONE!"
There was a slight changing of the guard
when Dan Patrick and Keith Olbermann in
troduced their sardonic witand dry humor to
the Big Show. With such classics as "Jose

Canseco with the whifjjffl7," and "Michael
Jordan touches nothing but the bottom of the
net!" Dan Patrick became a sports fan fa
vorite. Playing off of Patrick, Olbermann
coined such classics as "George McCloud fires
from way down town — BANG!" and "pitch
er Greg Maddux says to Barry Bonds, uhhli,
you 're not good." CMberman and I*at rick have
made the Big Show one of the most enjoyable
hours of television sports coverage and even
managed to add a little Spanish to the broad
casts with "en fuego" — the term accorded to
a player when he "catches fire" on the court.
New blood has crept into t he studios late
ly, and new anchors have sought to find the
new versions of "en fuego" and"the whiffff."
