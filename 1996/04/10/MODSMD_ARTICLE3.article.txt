# Trustees OK $88.7M med research center

### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
The Board of Trustees approved an
$88.71 million School of Medicine complex
at its quarterly meeting yesterday, which
will house the new Center for Clinical Sci
ences Research, scheduled to open in the
spring of 1999.
Dean of the Medical School Eugene
Bauer said one goal of the center is to bridge
the gap between basic and clinical sciences.
The new center "will enable basic scientists
to reach out to clinical researchers in the
development of the next round of revolu
tionary therapies," Bauer said.
Board Chairman John Freidenrich said
the trustees are very excited about the new
project.
"With the prospect of having this re
search all in one place, we all expect won
derful work to come out of it — it will be a
great building with great scientists," Frei
denrich said.
The center will contain both research fa
cilities and clinical departments. It will be
located west of the Beckman Center for
Molecular and Genetic Medicine, near
Welch Road.
The plan for the center is part of the Med
ical Center's long-term project to fortify
clinical science research at Stanford. Bauer
said there will be three interdepartmental
areas within the new center: cancer biology
and therapy, immunology and transplanta
tion and applied human genetics.
"This is an extraordinarily exciting con
cept to bring these programs together."
Bauer said.
University President Gerhard Casper
endorsed the project, saying the center ex
emplifies Stanford's commitment to mod
ern laboratories and efforts to understand

life-threatening diseases. Faculty from 10
departments will participate in the new
center's research: pediatrics, medicine,
surgery, radiation oncology, dermatology,
anatomy, pathology, pediatric surgery, ge
netics and molecular pharmacology.
University Architect David Neuman is
scheduled to submit the specific plans for
the project next year. Funding for the cen
ter has come from gifts, including a large
anonymous donation.
New design elements have been included
in the building plan to encourage interac
tion and group discussion, including wide
stairways and a central courtyard. The ar
chitecture firm of Sir Norman Foster and
Partners was asked to design the facility.
In other business, the trustees passed a
procurement approval and a site clearance
approval on the new Sciences and Engi
neering Quad, as well as passing the contin
uing construction on the Schwab building
in Manzanita Park, which will house stu
dents in the Graduate School of Business.
The board approved both a 10-year cap
on tenure extensions and a change in the re
search professoriate. The change will make
the professoriate more like the non-re
search track: assistant research professors
can now be promoted to the position of as
sociate research professor and can then be
promoted to full research professor.
Freidenrich said another purpose of the
board's meeting was the trustee reunion.
One-third of all trustees who have served
on the board since its founding in 1885 at
tended.
Seventy-five trustees were present at the
reunion, which culminated with the ad
dress by Secretary of State and former
Board of Trustees Chairman Warren
Christopher, who spoke on U.S
environmental policy.
Freidenrich said he felt gather
ing all the former trustees was
beneficial to the meeting. "I was
thrilled to hear and see our for
mer colleague given major nation
al address," Freidenrich said.
"That was the highlight of our
meeting."
Trustee Susan Westerberg-

Prager agreed. "The reunion was
incredible," she said. "It was very
special to sec how people had been
involved here in different time pe
riods, and see them showing their
love of Stanford."
Provost Condoleezza Rice said
she thought the reunion was a
wonderful Stanford tradition. "It
is encouraging to see trustees
from different decades and eras
coming together and see that
they are still interested after all
the time they have invested — it
was a historical moment for
them."
