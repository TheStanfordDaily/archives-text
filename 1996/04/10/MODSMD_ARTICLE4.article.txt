## Senate will no longer purchase goods or services from companies that invest in the Asian country

The ASSU Senate voted last night to sus
pend its use of corporations which invest in
Myanmar.
Under the legislation, the senate will no
longer purchase goods or services from corpo
rations that invest in Myanmar, the country
in Southeast Asia formerly known as Burma,
and will urge the University to adopt a similar
policy.
"Stanford is on the cusp of something im
portant with regards to human rights and
corporate responsibility," said junior Nick
Thompson, the author of the hill sponsored
by Council of Presidents member Rich vStnl/.
"This bill is in large part a response to what is
goingon due to student activism in this coun
try. We have an enormous opportunity.' -
The resolution will affect four corpora
tions — Texaco, PepsiCo, Unocal and Mit
subishi — which have financial interests in
Myanmar.
Although the senate does not have any
specific financial agreements with any of the
companies, it occasionally purchases goods —
such as pizza from PepsiCo subsidiary Pizza
Hut for its meetings.
Myanmar is currently under the rule of a
military regime known as the SLORC, which
has refused to recognize a democratically
elected government and has reportedly sub

jocted many citizens to forced labor.
Several senators questioned the advisabil
ity of the senate milking a resolution on busi
ness outside the University.
"We are telling the University how to deal
with something which is outside our scope,"
said graduate senator Donald Aingworth.
"We are attempting to slip something
through that is wrong."
Ot her senators raised issues of practicali
ty-
"We don't know what the repercussions of
this are on the University and the ASSU,"
said graduate senator Sandeep Singhal. "I am
nervous to take a stance without knowing
what the issues are in terms of cost and con
venience."
Rut according to undergraduate senator
Armen Panossian, the ASSU should put
aside issues of practicality and recognize the
2,000 Stanford students who signed a peti
tion in support of the bill.
"Human rights is not a practicality. Advo
cacy is the main purpose of the ASSU," he
said. "If 2,000 students want us to do this,
then we should hear their voices and act ac
cordingly."
In other business, undergraduate senator
Steve Russell attempted unsuccessfully to re
move Senate Chair Alane Murdock.
Alt hough the motion won less than 30 per-
