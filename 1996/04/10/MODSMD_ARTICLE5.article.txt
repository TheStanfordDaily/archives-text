# New study considers value of immigrants

From the creation of new jobs
to increased diversity within soci
ety, legal Asian immigrants pro
vide far more benefit than harm to
the nation, according to a new
study headed by Assoc. Law Prof.
Bill Hing.
The report, titled "The State of
Asian Pacific America: Reframing
the Immigration Debate," was pri
marily sponsored by Leadership
Education for Asian Pacifics, a Los
Angeles-based non-profit organi
zation. It was published last week
in order to address current contro
versies over immigration.
Using census data, reports,

data from the Immigration Natu
ralization Service and interviews,
the 18-month project was started
"because there are a lot of gaps in
studies that are cited claiming
that immigrants hurt the econo
my," Hingsaid. "Secondly, there's
a lot of people who oppose immi
grants who rely on no data and on
wild beliefs."
Although Asian Americans cur
rently comprise only 3 percent of
the total U.S. population, their
numbers are rapidly rising, with a
growth rate of 385 percent from
1971 to 1990. They are now the
fastest growing racial group.
With the arrival of so many
newcomers, complaints about im
migrants stealing jobs and drain
ing welfare budgets have become
common, especially during peri
ods of economic hardship. The re
port questions the accuracy of
such views and the disregard of
possible beneficial effects of immi
gration.
"We decided to look at one as
pect : What do immigrant entrepre
neurs do?" Hing said. "Most stud
ies do not even try to calculate the
positive impact by immigrant en
trepreneurs, so we looked at, just
as an example, Asian-American en
trepreneurs, and found that in rev
enues alone they brought in $350
billion. Their total annual payroll
was $30 billion while they created
about a half a million jobs."
Asian immigrants are also a pro

ductive part of many industries,
such as in the Silicon Valley, where
an estimated 15,000 Asian immi
grants constitute a quarter of the
workforce in high technology com
panies, the report says.
While there are arguments that
immigrants burden social services,
(he report's authors respond that
public education, one of the prima
ry concerns of anti-immigrant ad
vocates, generates "long-term ben
efits, because schools prepare chil
dren to be productive adult work
ers. Census data show that chil
dren of Asian immigrants become
highly educated adults, thus
adding to the base of the U.S. labor
force."
Through schooling, immigrants
are also able to better participate in
the political system, another criti
cism by advocates for more restric
tive immigration policies. Instead
of focusing on immigrants' initial
political participation, the report
cites length of residence and accul

turation as the most important fac
tors. According to the report, with
in 15 years after immigrating to
America, Asian immigrants be
come accustomed to American cus
toms and institutions, and about
two-thirds become naturalized cit
izens.
Hing said Asian-American in
volvement in naturalization poli
cies was an important factor in the
creation of the report.
"Asian input is seldom very
sought when it comes to policy
matters," Hing said. "And immi
gration matters is a congressional
policy that definitely affects all
Asians."
While the report's primary
focus is on Asians, much of the in
formation relates to all immi
grants. "The findings dealing with
educational costs applied to immi
grants across the board," Hing
cited as an example. "Those find
ings are not just confined to Asian
Americans."
