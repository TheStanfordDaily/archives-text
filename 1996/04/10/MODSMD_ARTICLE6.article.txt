# Pursuing a dream
## Eastern European students take their Stanford education home 
### Jennifer Chang 
For centuries, the idea of the
"American Dream" has been syn
onymous with happiness, success
and an opportunity for a good edu
cation. According to admissions
officials, in the past five years,
more and more Eastern European
students have been applying to
and enrolling in Stanford, wishing
to take part in such a dream.
About 75 students from East
ern Europe applied this year, and
an average of 12 are admitted each
year. The recent upsurge of appli

cations from Eastern Europe is
due to both the collapse of com
munism in the late '80s, which fa
cilitated international travel, as
well as the easier application
process available to students.
According to Jon Reider, asso
ciate director of undergraduate
admissions, applying to an Ameri
can university was a long and ar
duous process for an Eastern Eu
ropean student, even as little as
four years ago.

of about 50 Eastern European students attending Stanford.
now given widely in Europe, were
previously given in very few loca
tions, and student were often forced
to travel long distances at great ex
pense simply to take the tests. The
SAT fees also presented a monetary
obstacle; due to the currency ex
change, they were often impossibly
high for a typical Eastern European
family.
"Such natural obstacles are now
slowly being eliminated," Reider
said.
The collapse of communism has
also inspired Eastern European stu
dents to educate themselves about
the workings of capitalist economics
and democracy in the United States,
and then take that knowledge back
home. Katya Drozdova, a senior ma
joring in international relations, said
she hopes to learn how American
laws and the market economy can be
assimilated in her homeland, Russia.
"I want to apply the knowledge
I'm gaining here at home and per
haps work for an international orga
nization, to help both Russia and the
U. 5.," Drozdova said.

Eastern European students
choose Stanford in particular be
cause of its high academic reputa
tion, its many resources and its rep
utation as a friendly campus.
"Stanford is perceived every
where in the world as a cordial, so
cial environment," Reider said.
Eor Tamara Sakovska, a fresh
man from Ukraine, the opportunity
to choose her future path was the ul
timate incentive for coming to Stan
ford. Coming from a high school spe
cializing in the natural sciences, she
said she was fated to become a math
ematician or physicist. In contrast,
as a freshman at an American uni
versity, she has two years to decide a
major.
"Education in Ukraine is not
bad, but it is very narrow," Sakovs
ka said. "There, you have to decide
by age 17 what you want to do.
Despite the new, easier applica
tion process, admission to Stanford
is difficult for foreign applicants,
due to high academic standards and
financial considerations. According
to Reider, admission is primarily
based on students' academic excel
lence, their ability to share some
thing about themselves and their
experiences and potential impact on
fellow students. Reider said admis

sions staff also gives special atten
tion to students from countries
which are not highly represented.
Students in Eastern Europe are
typically well-educated in English
during high school. For Drozdova,
her English education began in the
second grade, and she continued her
studies at a school that specialized in
English.
Drozdova participated in an ex
change program and attended five
months of high school in the United
States. She then took the route of
many foreign students — she at
tended a community college in the
town where her exchange family
lived and then transferred to Stan
ford after two years.
"I had heard of Stanford, Har
vard and Yale, and I knew I had
huge obstacles in applying," she
said. "However, I thought I was in
tellectually prepared. I had to try."
The hope of bringing cultural di
versity to Stanford is another factor
in determining whether to accept an
Eastern European student. Accord
ing to Reider, this is not a difficult
task, considering t he interest most
students have in their nation's poli
tics as well as their willingness to
share their views.
"It's impossible not to be a politi

cal person in Eastern Europe; poli
tics affect people's lives greatly,"
Reider said. "I once read an applica
tion from a Bosnian refugee in Ger
many who independently started a
$3 million fund-raiser to aid Bosnia,
and another application from a Pol
ish student who worked with (Czech
Republic President Vaclav) Havel.
We look for such foreign students
who can contribute to the academic
life of American students."
In turn, Eastern European stu
dents gain a heightened awareness
of their own culture from an Ameri
can education and their American
peers. "Now that I am here, my
country seems external but more
dear to me, and I value my culture
even more," Sakovska said.
Drozdova emphasized the value
of an overseas education to potential
applicants. Now living with Chinese
and Iraqi roommates, she said she
regards Stanford as a true cultural
microcosm of the world.
"You give the perspective you
bring from home, and you get an
American perspective in return,"
Drozdova said. "I learned that the
only difference between nations is
language. As people, we all have the
same worries, and we can relate and
live together."
