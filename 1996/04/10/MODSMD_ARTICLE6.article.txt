# Pursuing a dream
## Eastern European students take their Stanford education home 
### Jennifer Chang 
For centuries, the idea of the
"American Dream" has been syn
onymous with happiness, success
and an opportunity for a good edu
cation. According to admissions
officials, in the past five years,
more and more Eastern European
students have been applying to
and enrolling in Stanford, wishing
to take part in such a dream.
About 75 students from East
ern Europe applied this year, and
an average of 12 are admitted each
year. The recent upsurge of appli

cations from Eastern Europe is
due to both the collapse of com
munism in the late '80s, which fa
cilitated international travel, as
well as the easier application
process available to students.
According to Jon Reider, asso
ciate director of undergraduate
admissions, applying to an Ameri
can university was a long and ar
duous process for an Eastern Eu
ropean student, even as little as
four years ago.
