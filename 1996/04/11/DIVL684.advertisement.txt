Why are half of Scorel's
employees Stanford grads?
A) Stanford grads know a great opportunity when they see one.
B) Stanford grads want to stay in the Bay Area after graduation.
C) We couldn't grow over 1200% in 2 years with just anybody.
D) There aren't enough good Harvard grads to fill up half a company.
E) All of the above.
At Score, we take graduates from Stanford, the Ivy League, and other top universities and provide them
with first-rate educational and business experience. You need to have a heart for kids, a keen business mind, a
solid academic record, and the energy to hang with the nation's fastest-growing educational start-up.
It's not an easy job, but our employees know that it's a rewarding one.
Hey, twenty top Stanford grads couldn't be wrong.
