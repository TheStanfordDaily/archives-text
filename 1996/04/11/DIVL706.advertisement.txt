This guys got a lot on his mind
I could use some extra credit this summer, and I think
Northwestern's the place to go. Summertime means smaller
classes and better access to some of Northwestern's most popular
professors. They even have a course on the Beatles, and if I get
ambitious, I can earn a full-year of college credit with
Northwestern's eight-week intensive course sequences in physics,
chemistry, and nine languages, ltd be nice to go back to school
in the fall with a few extra credits on my transcript.
Summer in the Windy City
sounds like a hot time.
Chicago has jazzfests, blues
fests, and gospelfests, Cubs
and Sox games, some of the
best museums and art galleries
in the world, and ethnic festi
vals all summer 10ng... I'd
have plenty to do, and it's all
just minutes from the
Northwestern campus.

If 1 go off-campus this summer, Northwestern
has the programs. But how am I going to choose
between Chicago Field Studies, the
Archaeological Field School, and the
Ethnographic Field School? They're all great
opportunities and they all offer the chance to
earn college credit. Having fun and getting
ahead... Not a bad idea.
I never thought of Northwestern
as a summer hot spot, but the
campus is right on Lake
Michigan. They've got beaches,
intramural sports, arts and crafts
workshops, wine-tasting and pot
tery making minicourses, basket
ball and volleyball tournaments,
campus musicals and theatrical
performances, outdoor movies,
and hiking and canoeing trips in
Wisconsin. All with
Northwestern Summer Session
'96... Pretty cool.
He just received our summer catalog...
Northwestern University
Summer Session '96
...and you can too. Just call l-800-FINDS-NU
for a free Summer Session '96 catalog
or e-mail summer@nwu.edu
and get ahead this summer.
