It is the true story of seven fresh
men picked to live in an all-frosh
dorm, Junipero, and have their
lives challenged. Find out what
happens when the small talk ends
and people start getting real. The
Real World, Stanford.
After a hectic winter quarter,
the members of the Real World
were anxious for their well-de
served spring break. Some vaca
tioned with their college buddies,
while others opted for the relax
ing return home.
Chandra Christenson, the
only one who ventured off the
mainland, flew to Hawaii with
three of her male dormmates. It
was her first trip to the island
without parental supervision,
and they stayed in her grand

parents' condo.
"We lived off of Top Ramen for
the whole week," Chandra said. "I
never want to see that stuff
again."
During the week, Chandra
claims that her friends forced her
to throw a party, which turned
into a complete nightmare.
"I know a local girl there who
invited a few people to the party,
but all these locals showed up,"
she said. "So if you're going to
have a party there, don't tell any
one unless you want half the is
land to come."
Fortunately, nothing was bro-

ken or stolen, except a pair of Chan
dra's shoes. However, the neigh
bors were not pleased by the noise
disturbance and contacted the
manager, who called Chandra's
grandparents in Utah.
"I was in big trouble," she said.
"They were really disappointed in
me and basically told me not to do it
again."
Chandra's frustration grew
when her friends were unapprecia
tive of her sacrifice.
"My friends were kind of rude,"
she admitted. "Maybe it's just guy
mentality, but they didn't thank me
or my grandparents for letting
them stay in the condo."
Despite the added stress from
playing hostess to her guests, Chan
dra said she had a relaxing vacation
overall. The highlight was spending
time with her friends while playing
games like "Chutes and Ladders"
and "Sorry."
Kevin Chen, who traveled south
and "connected with (his) southern
roots," also encountered a few hap
less situations. Within a 24-hour
time period, he was pulled over
twice for speeding and received
three parking violations.
"I didn't notice how hard my foot
was pushing on the gas pedal, and
all of a sudden I saw these flashing
blue lights behind me," Kevin said.
"I put on a big show for the cop. I
pretended I was crying and gave
him a guilt trip from hell. I got off
with a warning."
But Kevin's luck ran out fast
when he was pulled over again a
half hour down the road. He at
tempted his "act" once more, this
time with greater pizzazz. Howev
er, kneeling down on one knee and
throwing off his hat only landed
him a speeding ticket.
The highlight of his southern ad
venture was visiting his twin broth
er at University of Virginia where
"they are well-endowed in the fe
male category."
Visiting college buddies was a
popular spring break event. Tasha
Dwamena, who spent a few days
visiting friends at Rutgers Univer
sity in New Jersey, decided that she

much prefers the West Coast col
lege atmosphere.
"Over there, people seem more
focused on staying on a specific
track," she said. "Even pre-meds
can shop around here. There's
greater flexibility at Stanford."
Grant Brown road-tripped with
two of his college buddies down to
Loyola Marymount University,
where they stayed with friends in
their college dorm.
"Loyola is really different be
cause it's right outside of L.A., so
there's always something to do,"
Grant said. "The dorms have very
strict policies so it's not conducive
to having fun."
Other Real World members de
cided to go home for the week. After
a rough quarter, Jean De La Torre
simply wanted to relax. She said it
was suprising to see the changes
her old friends had gone through
since her last visit.
"One of my high school friends
had a baby," she said. "We were re
ally similar in high school. It's
amazing to see the differences in
our lives now. She had moved in
with her boyfriend and got preg
nant, and I went to college. "
Joe Freund also spent the week
at home with friends and family,
concentrating on de-stressing from
an academically challenging winter
quarter.
"Considering the fact that I
don't remember most of (the
break), I'd have to say it was pretty
good," he said. "I like to think of it
as 'strategic stress removal.' But I
may have killed off too many brain
cells."
The highlight of Joe's trip home
was (he night he slept for 14 contin
uous hours, he said.
Although George Holbert had
originally wanted to return home,
he said his trip down to San Diego
with the men's crew team was
worthwhile. As a result of the trip,
his head is now half-shaved with an
uneven shag of hair hanging in the
back.
"The guys held a kind of initia
tion ceremony for the frosh / novice
team," he said. "We were presented
to the group by our big brothers
after we had our heads shaved. The
trip was a good bonding experi
ence."

But Kevin's luck ran out fast
when he was pulled over again a
half hour down the road. He at
tempted his "act" once more, this
time with greater pizzazz. Howev
er, kneeling down on one knee and
throwing off his hat only landed
him a speeding ticket.
The highlight of his southern ad
venture was visiting his twin broth
er at University of Virginia where
"they are well-endowed in the fe
male category."
Visiting college buddies was a
popular spring break event. Tasha
Dwamena, who spent a few days
visiting friends at Rutgers Univer
sity in New Jersey, decided that she

much prefers the West Coast col
lege atmosphere.
"Over there, people seem more
focused on staying on a specific
track," she said. "Even pre-meds
can shop around here. There's
greater flexibility at Stanford."
Grant Brown road-tripped with
two of his college buddies down to
Loyola Marymount University,
where they stayed with friends in
their college dorm.
"Loyola is really different be
cause it's right outside of L.A., so
there's always something to do,"
Grant said. "The dorms have very
strict policies so it's not conducive
to having fun."
Other Real World members de
cided to go home for the week. After
a rough quarter, Jean De La Torre
simply wanted to relax. She said it
was suprising to see the changes
her old friends had gone through
since her last visit.
"One of my high school friends
had a baby," she said. "We were re
ally similar in high school. It's
amazing to see the differences in
our lives now. She had moved in
with her boyfriend and got preg
nant, and I went to college. "
Joe Freund also spent the week
at home with friends and family,
concentrating on de-stressing from
an academically challenging winter
quarter.
"Considering the fact that I
don't remember most of (the
break), I'd have to say it was pretty
good," he said. "I like to think of it
as 'strategic stress removal.' But I
may have killed off too many brain
cells."
The highlight of Joe's trip home
was (he night he slept for 14 contin
uous hours, he said.
Although George Holbert had
originally wanted to return home,
he said his trip down to San Diego
with the men's crew team was
worthwhile. As a result of the trip,
his head is now half-shaved with an
uneven shag of hair hanging in the
back.
"The guys held a kind of initia
tion ceremony for the frosh / novice
team," he said. "We were presented
to the group by our big brothers
after we had our heads shaved. The
trip was a good bonding experi
ence."
