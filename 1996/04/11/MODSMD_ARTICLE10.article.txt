## A 						sad goodbye Commerce Secretary Brown laid to rest in grand funeral 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Ron
Brown was laid to rest yesterday
after President Clinton celebrated
his "truly American life" in a
funeral that reflected the com
merce secretary's upbeat style.
"He would have loved this deal
today," the president said.
The funeral produced an out
pouring of respect unusual even in
pomp-loving Washington. High
ranking bureaucrats and govern
ment clerks shared pews in the
stately National Cathedral, crowd
ed to capacity. Thousands filed by
his coffin overnight in the Com
merce Department lobby.
"Ron Brown's incredible life
force brought us all joy in the
morning," the president said. "No
dark night could ever defeat
him.... This man loved life and all
the things in it."
Brown, the first black com
merce secretary, was killed along
with 34 others a week ago in a
plane crash while on a trade mis
sion to Croatia. His son, Michael,
began by thanking the Croatians
who climbed the hillside to bring
down the bodies.
The son smiled during his trib
ute to a father so close that they
still kissed on the lins until last

week. He brought on laughter
when he told of hearing him
described as smooth as a swan, and
graceful under pressure.
"And then I said, 'Wait a
minute, these people have never
played golf with him before,' "
Michael said. "He has problems
with about 2 1/2-foot putts, and
grace under pressure I would not
call that."
After the service, Brown's
hearse wound through the streets
of the historic black Shaw neigh
borhood, past the Commerce
Department and across the
Potomac River to Arlington
National Cemetery.
There, Clinton took the flag
folded by Brown's military pall
bearers and presented it to
Brown's widow, Alma. Although
the day was sunny and bright, the
flag-draped coffin had a plastic
cover, too, because a few snow flur
ries were falling.
The 54-year-old Brown quali
fied for interment in the cemetery
of heroes because he was a Cabinet
official who had an honorable mili
tary background. He served in the
Army from 1963-67, including
tours in Germany and Korea, and
attained the rank of captain.
