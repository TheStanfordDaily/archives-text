# Clinton vetoes abortion bill

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Guaranteeing
a fierce election-year debate over abortion,
President Clinton vetoed a bill yesterday
that would outlaw a rarely used technique
to end pregnancies in their late stages.
Clinton struck down the bill in an emo
tional ceremony where five women who
have undergone such abortions spoke
tearfully about the experience and the
fetal disorders that led to their decisions.
Clinton said the procedure is a "poten
tially lifesaving, certainly health-saving"
measure for "a small but extremely vul
nerable group of women and families in
this country, just a few hundred a year."
"This is not about the pro-choice, pro
life debate," Clinton said. "This is not a
bill that should have ever been injected
into that."
Congress does not appear to have the
votes to override the president but the
issue is sure to spill over into the presi
dential campaign, where abortion oppo
nents vow they will make Clinton pay for
his veto.
Abortion opponents said the procedure,
dubbed a "partial birth" abortion, is par

ticularly gruesome, sometimes carried out
after the fetus is pulled by the legs from
the birth canal.
The technique "blurs the line between
abortion and infanticide," said Clinton's
Republican presidential rival, Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole. Ralph Reed of
the Christian Coalition said, "It will be
very hard, if not impossible, for Bill Clin
ton to look Roman Catholic and evangeli
cal voters in the eye and ask for their sup
port in November."
Standing by Clinton in the Roosevelt
Room, Vikki Stella of Naperville, 111., said
she had no other choice. "I didn't make
the decision for my child to die. God made
the decision for my child to die. I had to
make the decision to take him off life sup
port."
Doctors said her unborn son's cranium
was filled with fluid and no brain tissue.
Coreen Costello of Agoura, Calif., told
Clinton she had her unborn child baptized.
"There will always be someone missing in
our family — and that was Katherine
Grace," she said. "She was dying inside my
womb."
