# 211 Muslims return home
## Men enter Bosnian territory after eight months in camp 
### 
CHECKPOINT CHARLIE, Bosnia-
Herzegovina (AP) — By the busload they
came, across America's Checkpoint Char
lie, back home into the arms of their
loved ones.
For 211 Muslim men, most of them
soldiers, the war ended yesterday when
they crossed into Bosnian government
territory at this checkpoint after being
held for eight months in detention camps
in Serbia.
But the reunion was marred at the last
minute when officials in Serbia took away
13 Muslim men as they boarded the
buses, drawing an angry protest from the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
The refugee convoy was the first since
the Dayton peace accord to pass through
Bosnian Serb territory. It was also seen
as an important step towards resettling
Bosnians in their hometowns, which offi
cials say is a necessary condition for
peace to take hold in the region.
Five buses rolled about 75 miles from
Serbia through the Serb half of Bosnia
and to this checkpoint in the neutral

zone, watched over by 25 American sol
diers. They arrived in Muslim-controlled
towns just before noon.
Two American helicopters secured the
way for the refugees, flying over moun
tains and valleys dotted by roofless
homes destroyed in the war.
Less than a mile from Checkpoint
Charlie, named for the Charlie platoon
that operates it, the big buses were
unable to pass over a narrow wooden
bridge.
The refugees got off, walked over the
bridge and boarded other buses on the
other side that took them to the town of
Kalesija and, for some, long-overdue
reunions with their families.
Sakib Itizvic, a 41-year-old soldier
from Srebrenica, embraced his wife,
Suhra, 30, whom he hadn't seen for four
years. She wept. They kissed.
"I never, no single night, fell asleep
without praying for him," Suhra said. "I
wish all women who do not know where
their husbands are will experience such
happiness as I experienced today."
