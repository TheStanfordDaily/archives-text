# More unrest in Liberia
## U.S. citizens continue to flee from Monrovia 
### 
MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) — The stench
of rotting bodies filled the air yesterday as
bi\nds of armed thugs roamed the streets of
Monrovia looting homes and shops and
smashing cars and windows.
Hundreds of people lined up outside the
U.S. Embassy in hopes of joining more than
300 foreigners, many of them American,
evacuated to neighboring Sierra Leone amid
the worst unrest in Monrovia in three years.
"I didn't feel like there was anything more
I could do at the present time in Liberia,"
Tanya Bernath, a 29-year-old New Yorker
who works for the international relief agency
Lutheran World Service, said after U.S. heli
copters flow her two hours to safety.
"Everybody was trapped," Bernath said
from Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital. She
was waiting to continue on to Dakar, Senegal,
whore a large international airport provides
many flights to the United States and Europe.
Navy Cmdr. Bob Anderson, a spokesman
for the U.S. European Command who is in
Freetown, said about half of those evacuated
late Tuesday and yesterday were Americans.
An Egyptian official said only one-fourth of
the evacuees were Americans.
About 470 Americans live in Liberia,
mostly in Monrovia, including 48 employed
at the U.S. Embassy. American officials say
nobody has been ordered to leave but a team
of 18 Navy SEAL commandos was flown to
Liberia to reinforce security at the U.S.
Embassy.
The Pentagon also dispatched two war

planes to Sierra Leone to stand by in case of
trouble. But Liberia's only international air
port has been destroyed, the control tower
bombed, and U.N.-donated helicopters and a
commercial jet lie gutted on the tarmac.
The U.N. envoy to Liberia, Anthony
Nyakyi, said a cease-fire was reached
between government troops and rebels who
have been holding hundreds of Liberians,
Lebanese and other foreign civilians hostage
at a military base in the capital.
Frank Akinola, a spokesman for the
12,000-member African peacekeeping force
in the country, said some of their troops were
released yesterday along with some civilians.
But he said the cease-fire was holding only in
western parts of the city.
Paul Koulen, an official with the U.N.
Development Program, said that tanks from
the peacekeeping forces had moved into the
Mamba Point neighborhood, where foreign
embassies and U.N. offices are located, but
that troops were doing little to protect people
or property.
He said dozens of peacekeepers in front of
the U.N. offices just sat by and watched as
young men stripped and destroyed a half
dozen aid vehicles.
"We see two big trucks with (peacekeep
ers) and one tank comes up, looks at the
scene for two minutes and they drive off
again," Koulen said.
"This is the rebels' livelihood: to loot and
kill," said a Lebanese businessman, Peter
Barbar.
