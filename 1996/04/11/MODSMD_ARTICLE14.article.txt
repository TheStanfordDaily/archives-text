# FDA tries to curb use of 'natural high' stimulant
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The govern
ment moved yesterday to curb sales of an
herb offering Generation Xers a "natural
high," telling consumers not to buy such
dietary supplements as Herbal Ecstacy that
contain the stimulant ephedrine.
The supplements are advertised to young
people — sometimes as a "natural" alterna
tive to illegal drugs — promising euphoria,
heightened sexual awareness and enhanced
athletic performance. They're found every
where and in various forms — from tablets
in health-food stores to special fruit drinks
sold on the beaches of California and Florida.
The supplements are "aimed directly
toward youth for the express purpose of
catching a buzz," said FDA spokesman
Arthur Whitmore.
The FDA has learned of 15 people who
died after taking ephedrine-containing sup
plements and has received almost 400 other
reports of side effects, from heart attacks
and seizures to psychosis.
So the agency warned consumers not to
buy or use the supplements, and is collecting
coroners' reports and other evidence in an
effort to take regulatory action against man
ufacturers.

The products are "recreational, street
drug-like products that are masquerading as
dietary supplements," said FDA Commis
sioner David Kessler, who investigated when
the relatives of a 20-year-old who died ques
tioned him about ephedrine. "I believe
they're drugs and should be treated as
such."
Herbal Ecstacy manufacturer Global
World Media Corp. of Venice, Calif., denied
the herbal versions of ephedrine were harm
ful.
"It's pretty silly that the FDA is trying to
ban botanicals," said spokesman Sean
Shayan, who acknowledged his company's
product was developed as an alternative to
the illegal drug MDMA or "ecstasy."
"I'd rather my kid take Herbal Ecstacy
than the chemical 'ecstasy' off the street
where he has no idea what he's getting," said
Shayan. But he said his company has
stopped advertising its product as a natural
alternative to illegal drugs.
An industry trade group said not all
ephedrine was a problem, noting that the
FDA warning does not target ephedrine-con
taining supplements used to help people lose
weight.
