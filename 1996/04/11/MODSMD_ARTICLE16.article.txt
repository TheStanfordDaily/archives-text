# McDonald's, Disney negotiating deal

LOS ANGELES (AP) - Mickey
Mouse and Mickey D are making up.
After a prolonged chill with McDon
ald's Corp., Walt Disney Co. is negoti
ating a 10-year promotional alliance
with the top fast-food chain, part of
Disney's strategy to keep a lock on
American pop culture by teaming with
leaders in related industries.
Disney has mainly turned to the No.
2 hamburger chain, Burger King, to
help promote movies since 1991, with
tie-ins to films such as "Aladdin,"
"Lion King" and "Toy Story."

An executive said yesterday that the
deal would be broader.
In addition to 14 to 17 promotions a
year, McDonald's would sponsor Dis
ney's new Florida theme park, Animal
Kingdom, and pay $100 million in roy
alties, according to the executive,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
The deal was initially reported by
Daily Variety.
Spokespeople for Burbank-based
Disney and Oak Brook, 111.-based
McDonald's declined comment.
Such an alliance would revive a Dis

ney-McDonald's relationship that
largely soured during a 1990 dispute
over "Dick Tracy." It also would add to
the recent series of pacts between Dis
ney and other market leaders.
Disney is buying Capital Cities /
ABC for $19 billion. Last week it
struck a deal giving No. 1 toymaker
Mattel global toy rights to Disney
movie and TV properties. And when
Coca-Cola, a Disney theme park sup
plier, funded a new advertising ven
ture last year, Disney was a minority
owner. .â™¦*
