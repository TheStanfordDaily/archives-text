Stanford should expand
TV course offerings of
non-technical subjects

FOR YEARS, engineering stu
dents have had the opportu
nity to watch many of their
classes on television thanks to
Stanford Instructional Television
Network. Though the program
ming is produced by the Stanford
Center for Professional Develop
ment and meant for Silicon Valley
engineers, anyone with access to
Stanford's cable system can "sit in"
on these classes.
The Continuing Studies Pro
gram has begun to broadcast a
humanities lecture course as part of
its experiment in "distance learn
ing." The new program, "Gothic
Cathedrals and Great Churches of
England, 1150-1350," will air every
Thursday night at 7 p.m. on Chan
nel 51, and properly registered Con
tinuing Studies students will
receive full credit for the course.
This marks a new and promising
turn in the University's use of tech
nology in non-engineering courses.
It is good to see that the delibera
tions of the President's Commis
sion on Technology in Teaching and
Learning have produced such tangi
ble and beneficial results.
Now that the University recog
nizes the efficacy of televised lec
ture courses, it should take steps to
expand the use of television and
other technologies in the School of
Humanities and Sciences. Channel
51, the four SITN channels, the
three Meyer Library channels and
the two Stanford Programming
channels all appear to have plenty
of unused air time. A reasonable
investment in wiring a relatively
small number of large lecture halls
would enable the broadcast of
many introductory courses such as
Economics 1, Psychology 1, Biology
31 and Math 43. Those benefited by
televised courses would include not

only the students of the course, but
other students, interested mem
bers of the community and course
evaluators.
This is not to suggest that tele
vised courses can or ought to
replace the invaluable personal
relationships that characterize
most courses. Seminar courses are
obviously not candidates for broad
cast nor are intermediary courses
meant for majors in the depart
ment. While technology enthusi
asts may herald the day that the
University's physical campus is
replaced bv a cyber-campus via tele
vision and the Internet, that day is
far off and probably unrealizable.
However, the role of technology in
the educational process will
undoubtedly increase, and it is
imperative that the University
learn to utilize existent technology,
such as television, before making
radical changes in course structure.
Stanford students are fortunate
to have an administration commit
ted to studying the possibilities of
technology in and out of the class
room, as is evidenced by the Presi
dent's Commission on Technology
in Teaching and Learning. Surely,
the President's Commission ought
to have a leading role in determin
ing specific criteria for the broad
cast of courses.
The School of Engineering and
the Continuing Studies Program
have led the way in the implemen
tation of media technology for edu
cational purposes. From computer
science to Japanese, from electrical
engineering to medieval architec
ture, it has become clear that a
wide variety of lecture courses can
be successfully offered on televi
sion. Given the University's proven
ability to tape classes and the mul
tiple Stanford-affiliated channels
bereft of programming, the expan
sion of televised classes is some
thing of a no-brainer.
Channel 51 claims as its motto
"Bringing the Quad to the Commu
nity." It seems that there are few
better ways to do so than by mak
ing non-technical courses more eas
ily available.
