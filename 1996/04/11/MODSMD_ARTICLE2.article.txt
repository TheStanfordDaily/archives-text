# Researchers solve virus puzzle
## Focus on Science

A group of researchers at the Veterans Affairs
Palo Alto Health Care System led by a Stanford med
icine professor have discovered a new way to design
vaccines that fight deadly intestinal viruses.
Rotaviruses, which infect through the intestines,
cause the deaths of 800,000 to 1 million children
worldwide each year, usually in Third World na
tions. These viruses are also responsible for about
$1 billion in annual health care costs in the United
States.
"Rotavirus is the single most important cause of
dehydrating diarrhea in the world," according to

Harry Greenberg, a Stanford gastroenterologist who
headed the study. Children under the age of 3 are the
most severely affected by rotavirus infection, Green
berg said.
Greenberg and his team worked to identify pro
teins on the rotavirus that could be used to create an
tibodies which would attack and disable rotaviruses.
They developed an antibody called IgA, which they
delivered to mice through an IgA-producing tumor.
They then infected the mice with rotavirus to deter
mine the effectiveness of the antibody, Greenberg
said.
It turned out that antibodies were most effective
when they were delivered to mice through the lining
of the intestinal wall, instead of being delivered di
rectly into the intestine. Greenberg said he believes
that passing the antibody
through the cells of the intestinal
lining activates it, making it bet
ter able to attack and kill the ro
tavirus.
The lining of the intestine is
similar to other membranes
through which viruses infect the
body, such as the lungs. "This (re
search) is applicable to respirato
ry tract infections, such as the flu,
and any other virus that infects
through mucosal membranes,"
Greenberg said.
The research also explained a
confusing aspect of rotavirus in
fection, which is that children
who are infected with one ro

tavirus often appear to be im
mune to completely different ro
taviruses that they are exposed to
later in life.
Greenberg said he believes the
reason for this is a protein called
VP6, which is found on the out
side of all rotaviruses. According
to Greenberg, the VP6 protein ap
pears to be very similar among ro
taviruses. Because of this, vacci
nating people against one ro
tavirus VP6 protein may make
them immune to a host of other
rotaviruses as well.
A vaccine for rotaviruses which
Greenberg worked on 10 years
ago at the National Institutes of
Health demonstrates this proper
ty of multiple immunity, he said.
The vaccine was composed of an
animal rotavirus with human
genes for the VP7 protein — an

other protein on the virus — in
serted.
In widespread trials in the
United States, the vaccine ap
peared to be 80 percent effective
in treating rotavirus infection in
both chiidren and adults. Again,
the surprising fact was that peo
ple vaccinated for only one type of
rotavirus were immune to a vari
ety of rotaviruses, and Greenberg
attributed this to the VP6 protein
on the animal portion of the virus
in the vaccine.
Greenberg is hopeful that his
research will soon be put to good
use treating many of those with
rotavirus infection. "This vaccine
has been tested on thousands of
people, and it is possible that it
will be licensed and distributed in
the United States in one to two
years," Greenberg said.
