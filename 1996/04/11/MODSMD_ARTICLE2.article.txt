A group of researchers at the Veterans Affairs
Palo Alto Health Care System led by a Stanford med
icine professor have discovered a new way to design
vaccines that fight deadly intestinal viruses.
Rotaviruses, which infect through the intestines,
cause the deaths of 800,000 to 1 million children
worldwide each year, usually in Third World na
tions. These viruses are also responsible for about
$1 billion in annual health care costs in the United
States.
"Rotavirus is the single most important cause of
dehydrating diarrhea in the world," according to

Harry Greenberg, a Stanford gastroenterologist who
headed the study. Children under the age of 3 are the
most severely affected by rotavirus infection, Green
berg said.
Greenberg and his team worked to identify pro
teins on the rotavirus that could be used to create an
tibodies which would attack and disable rotaviruses.
They developed an antibody called IgA, which they
delivered to mice through an IgA-producing tumor.
They then infected the mice with rotavirus to deter
mine the effectiveness of the antibody, Greenberg
said.
It turned out that antibodies were most effective
when they were delivered to mice through the lining
of the intestinal wall, instead of being delivered di
rectly into the intestine. Greenberg said he believes
