## Rush questions answered 
### 
DOWN THE ROW and up on the
Knoll, the scent of Polo thickens
and sweetens the breeze. Stiff Wee
juns breathe their first air since senior
prom. Your Oxford is buttoned, khakis
creased, baseball cap on backwards. You
were excluded from those sexist debutante
balls, those chauvinist cotillions, but now
it's your turn to shine. Spring has sprung
and rush has begun!
This week I don my "Dear Abby" drag
and hark back to my own fraternity days
to shower pearls of wisdom on the weary
wags of the frosh class during this, the
most winsome of Stanford's seasons.
Fraternity rush is a topic too large to
cover in a single column — it took three
"Revenge of the Nerds" films to do the
subject justice. So, I'll devote my space to
a few of the most nagging questions trou
bling young Greeks-to-be:
Q: "I've got a good group of friends in
my dorm. Most of them are joining a fra
ternity, should I join too?"
A: Sometimes you'll see sad figures
scurrying through the stacks of Green or
enviously watching people having fun
behind the coffee house. These perennial
loners, these decrepit shells of ruined
humanity, these are the people who lost
their frosh dorm friends! Your frosh dorm
is basically your last chance to make
friends at Stanford. Blow it now and
you're a sure loner for the next three
years. Cling tight! If they rush, you rush!
Q "Isn't joining a fraternity a good

deal because you don't have to worry about
housing ever again at Stanford?"
A: Sure, just ask any Beta, Delt or KA.
There's probably one living in your dorm
lounge right now.
Q: "If I join, don't I have to sign away
my guaranteed housing?"
A: Well . . . yes, but don't worry. If you
quit the fraternity you can just sign anoth
er form and they'll give it all back to you.
Q: "There's no hazing, right?"
A: Oh, heavens no, dear! Stanford's
intellectual clime recognized the frivolity
of such barbarisms years ago and replaced
them with more constructive, healthful
activities. For example, in the fall you may
have seen packs of young men jogging au
naturel at 6 a.m. Other health nuts hoist
burlap sacks filled with bricks to all their
classes. One highly cultured house even
herds its new members into The Claw for
a synchronized swimming routine that I
must say gets funnier and funnier every
year. Most houses use a holistic approach
to pledge care; they don't neglect the inner
workings of the pledge and produce some
of the most solid livers on the West Coast!
Q: "I've heard that if 40 guys just sign
a list saying they want to re-start a frater
nity, the university will basically give them
a house, no questions asked?"
A: Probably. After all, they did it for the
Betas.
Q: "Will my academic work suffer?"
A: Hardly! Most houses have ways of
helping members recover study time lost

to socializing. Often a sort of "buddy sys
tem" is devised where brothers can collab
orate for mutual academic benefit — kind
of like if the ASSU offered a "lecture
notes, term papers and finals" service. Or,
sometimes houses create an "alumni
library" to store the coursework of past
fraternity members so that current frater
nity members won't repeat their silly mis
takes.
Q: "Isn't rush a great way to meet peo
ple?"
A: This is probably one of the best
things about rush. The process is designed
to minimize the many barriers that come
between people; like race, class and espe
cially gender. Now, your first rush party
will probably look something like Ellis
Island — a veritable bazaar of humanity, a
confused cacophony of races and types.
But over the three weeks of rush the right
house for you will winnow out these intol
erable distractions and tailor a social
group that meets your needs and expecta
tions.
Q: "Will I miss living with women'?"
A: Not at all. In fact, you'll find that not
having women around makes it much eas
ier to talk about them. You can be more
candid about sex, too.
