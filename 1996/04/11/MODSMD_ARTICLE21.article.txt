Gambling will help inform voters, law student says

AS FAR AS months go, March is no
slouch. There's the vernal equinox,
a week-long vacation and St.
Patrick's Day. Recently, two other events
have become March mainstays: The
NCAA basketball tournament and the
Academy Awards seem to engulf us all.
And this March Madness would be
incomplete without another American
tradition — gambling. Not long after the
various nominees and 64 lucky teams
have been selected, entry forms for bet
ting pools begin floating around offices
and campuses. For a few bucks, someone
can try to out-guess the Siskels, Eberts
and Vitales. And, if he does well, he
stands to win money and bragging
rights. But, if he has portrayed himself
at anytime during the year as someone
who knows sports or movies, failure
means shame.
The threat of disgrace and financial
loss, coupled with the potential for cash
and pride, lights a fire under people, and

they educate themselves. Before making
choices, pool participants read preview
articles and ask questions of their
friends in the know.
People who two weeks before did not
know the difference between a best boy
and a dolly grip begin to display their new
found understanding. "Sure the Academy
tends to link best picture with best direc
tor, but Robbins was snubbed on 'Dead
Man.' " "The category is best adaptation,
not best screenplay." "Who cares if the
tune hit the charts, that doesn't tell me
anything about the scoring."
Not to be outdone, basketball neo
phytes begin churning out facts as if
they had been watching ESPN2 all year.
"Drexel looked good in the early season,
but their offensive glass-wiping has been
non-existent lately." "My heart is with
my old school, but Florida International
is hot from the three-point stripe, and
they've beaten every zone they played."
So, as we can see, gambling, in a

bizarre sort of way, promotes education.
And thanks to a recent change in Cali
fornia's election law, March is now home
to something else — the statewide pri
mary election. This year, Californians
set a record for low turnout. Experts had
an easy explanation — apathetic and
uniformed voters stay at home.
Well, in case your vision is impaired
and you could not see this a mile away,
election gambling might solve this. If
people had to plop down money and pick
which candidates and initiatives they
thought would win, they would be forced
to educate themselves. Of course, these
pools would in no way be tied to a per
son's actual vote, but in figuring out
who they think will win, voters may also
discover who they want to win.
Voter pools would have added bonus
es as well. Some people felt that this
year's low turnout was attributable to
the fact that President Clinton and Sen
ator Bob Dole had locked up their

respective nominations. But if people
had money riding on the fate of the
mountain lions, they would not have
given up interest in the so-called lesser
items. And low and behold, they may
have discovered that the future of our
schools, infrastructure, legal system, and
primary elections themselves were all on
the March ballot. Furthermore, this
would force people who blather on as if
they know all about politics to put their
money where their mouth is.
Now, before I am accused of demean
ing the entire democratic process, let me
say that this is not a serious proposal (at
least not yet). But if you are one of the
majority of registered voters who did not
vote in the last election, you may want
to ask yourself who is demeaning the
process. Does it take a gambling pool or
some other crazy idea to get you
involved? It shouldn't.
