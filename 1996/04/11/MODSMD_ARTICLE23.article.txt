## Election time again: Steve Russell for President 
### 
STANFORD'S ELECTION season is
now at hand, and everyone knows
what that means — absolutely
nothing. If my own purpose is to answer
the questions foremost in the minds of
Stanford students, then I must respond
now to the most commonly expressed
election-time puzzler: "Does it matter at
all?"
Well, of course not. That is, as long as
you make one easy and obvious choice.
I'm talking about what everyone's been
talking about — one man, one decision,
one . . . Steve Russell.
There has been much discussion lately
over the possible institution of a single
student-body president. But the question
remains: Who would that president be? If
you ask me, there is only one man for the
job — my friend, my colleague, my future
president. . . Steve Russell.
I've been close friends with "Muscle,"
as I call him, for three years. Recently, I
had a chance to speak with him specifi
cally about some of his ideas for Stanford,
and I think they are quite extraordinary.
Steve plans to start at the beginning,

by making student government more
efficient and accountable to the people
it's meant to serve. "Cleaning up the
ASSU Senate will be my first order of
business," Steve told me in an informal
interview earlier this week. "And that
begins with the actual people that make
up that body.
"After all," he added, "who doesn't
find Alane Murdock extremely annoy
ing?"
Steve Russell — he understands poli
tics.
Steve also plans to work on the issues
that students really care about, such as
the possible Taco Bell franchise in
Tresidder.
"Screw Burma and give me my taco,"
Steve said. "Hell, I'd like to turn the
whole damn building into a mini-mall."
If his plan is unsuccessful, Steve
promises to personally make burrito runs
for students with late-night cravings.
Steve Russell — he has a car.
If elected, Steve will also address other
much-discussed campus culinary issues,
such as the consistently poor quality of

food service. If, one month into his term
as student body president, you remain
dissatisfied with your dining hall's offer
ings, Steve's own girlfriend will cook you
a decadent meal to your liking.
Steve Russell — his girlfriend loves to
cook.
Most students I know have had a bad
experience or two with "that big guy" at
the Stanford Post Office, but campus
politicians have continually failed to
address this problem — until now. If the
guy at the post office harangues you in
any way, Steve promises to sit him down,
have a long talk and ensure that you get
friendly postal service.
Steve Russell — he delivers foryo//.
And what about the debate over quar
ters versus semesters? For years, the
argument has been restricted to two pos
sibilities: two semesters or three quar
ters. But Steve has a whole new idea.
"It just dawned on me one sunny
afternoon," Steve said. "What about two
quarters? With the weather so nice,
everyone hates taking classes during
spring quarter, so I advocate that one

quarter each year be devoid of academic
hassles."
Steve Russell — he loves a good tari.
Of course, that leaves the problem of
final exams, one of the most painful
thorns in the sides of Stanford students.
But, if elected, Steve vows to work with
faculty and convince them that all Stan
ford students deserve A's simply by
virtue of being admitted to such a presti
gious school. That failing, he plans to
have all oppressive objective indicators,
including tests and grades, abolished.
Steve Russell — he gets you an A.
If you find Steve's ideas on academics
striking and innovative, you should hear
what he plans to do for Stanford social life.
"A lot of people complain about the
lack of dating at Stanford," Steve said.
"Under my administration, however,
even ugly students will have dates. I will
personally go out with any student
unable to find a partner. I'll wear a suit,
bring roses — the whole nine yards."
Steve Russell — he's not opposed to
sex on the first date.
In short, Steve has real solutions to

real problems. "Everyone knows Green
library is falling apart due to earthquake
damage," Steve said. "If elected, I promise
to stand at a key structural point in the
South Mezzanine and, with the strength
of my own body, act as a central pillar."
Steve Russell — he supports your edu
cation.
Finally, Steve will add a degree of
toughness to the campus unmatched by
the current administration or any before.
"Due to the misplaced compassion of
Bill Shen, only seven Stanford students
have been put to death this year," Steve
said. "And three of these sentences were
completely botched, leaving the students
mangled but alive! I promise to double
the number of mandated deaths while
I'm in office, and I promise furthermore
that I will not fuck up any executions."
Elect Steve Russell — he kills you
dead.
