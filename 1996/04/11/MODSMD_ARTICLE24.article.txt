# Overhauling the ASSU Constitution: A judicial branch
## We need a judicial branch

NEXT WEEK YOU will have the opportuni

This document proposes important and
significant changes in the relationship between
Stanford students and their student government.
Perhaps the most important proposal is the estab
lishment of a judicial branch in the ASSU. This
provision addresses a problem that many students
have long suspected: there currently exists no
recourse when ASSU politicians violate the Con
stitution and Bylaws.
Last November, the chair of the Student Nomi
nations Commission resigned, stating that he had
felt undue pressure from a Council of Presidents
member to appoint certain well-connected stu
dents to an important faculty committee. Members
of the senate and other campus organizations were
outraged. Yet, no actions were ever taken to reme
dy the matter. In December 1994, the senate
rejected a constitutional measure called the Bal
anced Eundintr Deal. The Senate

Chair then unilaterally canceled
the vote. He used his discretion
as chair to strip two senators of
their voting rights. One of those
senators was a widely respected
grfiduate representative from
the Graduate School of Busi
ness. He, as well as most stu
dents, were astounded that no
recourse was available once the
senate refused to challenge the

'There needs to
be a viable check
on what the
ASSU can and
cannot do.'

chair. Despite strident criticism
from campus leaders, no remedial actions were
taken.
Every so often the ASSU takes a stance on a
national political issue. Most students recognize
the dubious relevance of these resolutions. Worse,
serious doubts linger regarding the constitutional
permissibility of such activities; especially with
regard to political controversies that the student
body itself is divided on. Hut there is no authority
to tell the senate whether such stances are, in
fact, constitutional.
We need a judicial council.
The ASSU often lacks legitimacy in the eyes of
the students. A judicial branch is no panacea but it
would be an important step to restoring credibility
in the decision making process.
There seems to be a consensus on campus that it
is unfair to allow ASSU officials total power over

interpreting the constitu
tion. The idea of putting a
check on ASSU power is
nothing new. There have
been a flurry of proposals
in recent years. Constitu
tion '96 calls for the cre
ation of a hody with five
membe s> to be appointed
by the president and con
firmed by a two-thirds vote

of the senate. The selection and confirmation process
have been carefully designed to ensure that the judi
cial members are qualified and competent. The
super-majority vote requirement helps to insulate
the process from partisan shenanigans. The mem
bers would be charged with the responsibility of
adjudicating constitutional conflicts. Students would
finally have recourse to have their complaints heard
by an independent body, insulated from the perenni
al politics of the senate. The last two senate chairs
have opposed the formation of the judicial branch

because of fear that it would limit
their power. Their fear is well
placed. The overriding issue, how
ever, is that the judicial branch
would give voice to students con
cerned about ethics and fairness in
their student government.
There needs to be a viabie check
on what the ASSU can and cannot
do. Like any other organization, it
must obey its governing rules.
That is why it is critical that the
authority to resolve conflicts and

violations be vested in an independent body, not in
the body that caused the problem in the first place.
Finally, the formation of a judicial branch will
provide students with educational opportunities.
Being involved with the council will enable students
to gain valuable experience in ethics, procedure, due
process, law and democratic principles. Granted, it is
unlikely that the council will need to meet very
often. Serious problems typically arise only a few
times each year. Rut the mere presence of such a
council will force greater respect for the rights of
students and for the constitutional documents gov
erning the student body.
