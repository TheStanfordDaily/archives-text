# An undemocratic concept
## 
### Howard Loo 
IN ARGUING AGAINST the creation of an
ASSU judicial branch, I bear an enormous
burden: The judicial council is the one idea
that both proponents and opponents of Constitu
tion '96 support. However, I strongly believe that
the creation of an ASSU judicial council is one of
the gravest mistakes we can make as a student
body.
The current overwhelming support for a judi
cial council rests upon an archaic notion of the
judicial review. The process of judicial review is
not characterized by impartial and apolitical jus
tices interpreting a constitution. Rather, judicial
review is fundamentally a political process. Jus
tices of a court are political appointees, not impar
tial judges. They make policy just like elected offi
cials. Reasonable people disagree over constitu
tional interpretations. There is no absolute and
correct way to interpret the constitution. If there
isn't one correct interpretation, then who should

be given the great discretion
that goes along with having
interpretive power over our con
stitution? I posit that democrat
ic principles mandate constitu
tional interpretation lie in the
hands of those directly elected
by and accountable to students.
But the judicial council set up
by Constitution '96 is appointed
by the ASSU's executive branch,
not elected by the students. Pro
ponents support this by drawing

'The judicial council
is a Pandora's box
that could act
against the will
of the students.'

parallels to the United States Supreme Court. This
argument is unconvincing, for the Supreme Court
itself is a very undemocratic institution. This view
may take many people by surprise, but the concept
of nine justices roadblocking the will of a popularly
elected legislative body is contrary to core demo
cratic principles.
People look at me with surprise when I argue
that the judicial review is a very anti-democratic
process. In one of my favorite hooks, "Democracy
and Distrust: A Theory of Judicial Review," Stan
ford Law Prof. John Hart Ely argues that judicial
review, because it is an undemocratic process,
should be limited to only protecting rights explic
itly stated in the Constitution and should also
have a "representation-reinforcing" role. That is,
the role of judicial review is to protect fundamen
tal rights, ensure fair representation and ensure

fair electoral processes.
With all due respect, the
ASSU isn't powerful
enough to start subvert
ing individual rights, and
the current electoral pro
cess is very fair and open.
Thus we don't need to
create a judicial council.
We would only be creat
ing a council that could

subvert the will of the elected representatives of
the student body.
Theory aside, what will be the impact of an
ASSU judicial council? The branch will have a sub
stantial power: the power to declare an act of the
senate unconstitutional. The council will surely be
a partisan political body, filled with members sym
pathetic to the executive. Should the council make
a bad ruling, or act against the will of the stu
dents, nothing can be done.
Proponents are concerned with the lack of

checks on the ASSU. As it is
now, the Senate rules on the
constitutionality of its own
actions. At first this situation
offends our traditional beliefs in
checks and balances, but upon
closer examination this situa
tion does not seem that bad at
all. For if constitutional inter
pretation is a political process,
we should leave the job up to the
those who we as students elect-

ed. If a senator acts unconstitu
tionally, we can recall the senator from office. If
the judicial council acts unconstitutionally, we are
at its whim.
In sum, it is our responsibility as students to
make sure the ASSU acts constitutionally. Our
elected representatives should answer to us, not to
an elite handful of "impartial" members of a judi
cial council. The judicial council is a Pandora's box
that could act against the will of the students.
Constitutional interpretation is a fundamental
task, and I believe this task should be left to those
directly accountable the student body at large.
Instead of creating an anti-democratic institution,
the answer is for all of us to take a strong interest
in the workings of our student government.
