## Texas prep star signs national letter of intent 
### Hobby Cuza Editorial staff 
Ryan Mendez, a 6-foot-7, 195-pound for
ward / guard who led the state of Texas in both
scoring and rebounding last year, signed a na
tional letter of intent with the Stanford men's
basketball program yesterday.
Mendez averaged a phenomenal 38.2 points
and 18.3 rebounds per game during his senior
season at Burleson High School (just south of
Fort Worth, Tex.) while shooting 56 percent
from the floor, 54 percent from three-point range

and 85 percent from the free
throw line. In one game
against Mineral Wells High,
Mendez poured in 72 points
in Burleson's 101-96 victory.
"No doubt, he was the
best shooter in the state of
Texas," said high school
coach Phil Anderson. "He is
a pure shooter who under
stands the game and is a
great team player. He will be

a great addition to the Stanford basketball pro
gram."
At the conclusion of his senior campaign,
Mendez was named first team All-State MVP for
the second year in a row by the Ft. Worth Star-
Telegram and All Dallas-area by the Dallas
Morning News for the second straight season.
"Ryan really fits the need for the perimeter
shooter that we were looking for," said Cardinal
head coach Mike Montgomery. "He has a great
sense of the game, and he has a strong future in
the Stanford basketball program."
Mendez also carries his weight in the class
room, graduating 10th in a class of 350 seniors.
Mendez will be the fourth newcomer to the
men's basketball program next season. Mark
Madsen, a 6-9, 220-pound forward who original
ly committed to Stanford in November of 1993,
will complete his two-year Mormon mission in
July and join the team in the fall. Moselely is a 6-
4, 180-pound guard from Mayfield High School
in Las (Yuces, N.M., who can play both off-guard
and small forward. I Ie averaged 26 points his se
nior season, earning him state Player of the Year
honors from USA Today. Finally, Pete Van El
swyk is a 6-9,230-pound forward who redshirted
this past season after transferring from South
Carolina, where he was a two-year starter.
Baseball: Monday's (April 15) scheduled
non-conference baseball game between St.
Mary's and Stanford has been cancelled. The
game, which will not be made up, was scheduled
to be played at Sunken Diamond at 4 p.m.
