# It's do-or-die for women's gymnastics
## Cardinal heads to NCAA Regionals this Saturday 
### Keith Rabkin Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's gymnastics team has not
taken part in any head-to-head competition in al
most two weeks, but the Cardinal can't afford to
come out rusty this weekend.
That's because this Saturday the women travel to
Los Angeles for the NCAA West Regional, their most
important meet of the season to date. Despite sport
ing just a 2-6 regular-season mark, the Cardinal is
hoping to change its luck in the postseason.
"We're not going to do anything different — we
can hit our routines, and if we do, we can advance,"
said team co-captain Ariel Passanisi. "We will have
to stay really focused, but we have done it in the past.
We're very prepared for this meet."
The regional brings together the best teams in the
West. Oregon State, the Pacific 10 Conference cham
pion, will assume the top seed in the competition, fol
lowed by second-place Pac-10 finisher UCLA. Al
though Stanford finished the regular season with an
0-5 Pac-10 record, it still managed to eke out a third
seed, just ahead of the Washington Huskies. Califor
nia, Boise State and Cal-State Fullerton will round
out the field.
Prospects for a high finish look dim for the Cardi
nal if you look at the team's performance in head-to
liead competition. Oregon State, UCLA and Wash
ington have all beaten the Cardinal in previous
meetings, albeit by slim margins. The Beavers, Bru
ins, and Huskies also placed ahead of the Cardinal at
the Pac-10 championships on March 23. And while
the Cardinal was able to edge out Cal for sixth place
at Pac-lOs, the Golden Bears beat Stanford in the
last meet of the season the following weekend.
Despite the Cardinal's lackluster won-lost record,
though, this team has outperformed any squad in
Stanford's history. Sophomore Keri Monahan and
freshman Am}' Murakami have spent the entire sea
son shattering school records, and at the Chili's
"Red Hot" Invitational on March 1, the Cardinal
broke the record for best team performance in Stan
ford history.
The team will need all of that record-setting vigor
if it hopes to advance pass the regional. Only the
schools with the top 12 scores in the country will be
invited to the NCAA championships April 25-27 in
Tuscaloosa, Ala. And while Stanford has made it to
NCAAs in the past, many don't expect this Cardinal
team to be a threat.
"This will be the biggest challenge yet for the
young team," said head coach Lisa Izzi. "But if we
are confident going into the meet and 1 wel can hit all
of our routines like we did against Arizona State,
then we can secure our spot for NCAAs."
Oregon State will provide the most formidable
competition for the Cardinal. The Beavers have

best performance of the season

"It will take a total team ef
fort to beat out Oregon State,"
Izzi said. "We can't just rely on
the members of our squad who
have consistently performed

best. Everyone has to contribute
or we won't make it."
A strong performance at this
meet would go a long way to
wards making amends for the
Cardinal's anemic Pac-10
record. Only then can the Cardi
nal achieve its season-long goal
— taking part in NCAA national
competition.
