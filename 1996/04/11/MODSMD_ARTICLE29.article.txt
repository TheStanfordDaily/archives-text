# Softball gets a break from Pac-10 play
## Cardinal to battle against St. Mary's in non-conference matchup 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The Stanford softball team takes a break
from Pacific 10 Conference competition today
with a doubleheader against Saint Mary's.
The Cardinal (19-18 overall, 5-9 in the Pac
-10) has completed its first round of games
against conference teams and will have the
weekend off after facing the Gaels (15-13)
today at 2:30 p.m. Conference play picks up
again next weekend in Oregon .
Today's contest marks the third meeting
between the two teams this season. The Car
dinal faced Saint Mary's twice in the San Jose
State Tournament in February, winning the
first game 5-0 and dropping the second 4-3.
But that was two months ago, and the Cardi
nal has since gone on to defeat five nationally
ranked teams. As head coach Sandy Pearce
notes, however, the success of this Stanford

team is day-to-day.
"With our team, it's not who we play, but
how we play," said Pearce. "We lose to San
Diego State and then turn around and take
two from Arizona State."
Lackluster performances against weak
teams have been a problem all season for the
young Cardinal. Inexperience has led to losses
against teams that Stanford should have beat
en and has helped make this an up-and-down
season for the Cardinal.
Expect Stanford to be prepared today
against Saint Mary's. The Cardinal women
know what they're up against and Pearce feels
that her team's performance will be the ulti
mate determining factor in the game.
"They're a real scrappy team," Pearce said.
"They have pretty good hitting and pretty
good pitching. It's really how our team plays
[that will make the difference]."
Stanford's obvious advantage is its pitch

ing. Stanford freshman Becky Blevins has
been on fire lately, and fellow freshman Marcy
Crouch had strong performances last week
end in her first games back from injury. Inci
dentally, neither Blevins nor Crouch received
any time at the mound in the two previous
games against Saint Mary's. That should
make this pitching duo even more potent,
since no Gael will be familiar with either
pitcher before.
Defensively, the Cardinal will need to min
imize errors, but it may have to do that with
an integral piece of its lineup missing. Fresh
man Michelle Schneider is questionable for
today's game due to a wrist injury she sus
tained against Arizona, as is freshman second
baseman Jennie Foyle. Schneider, who is the
team's regular shortstop and leading hitter,
missed two games last weekend against ASU
and is still not back to full
strength.
Replacing Schneider is no easy
task. In the two previous games
against the Gaels, Schneider was
5-for-8 at the plate with two runs
and two RBIs. If Schneider is un
able to play, freshman Michelle
Acosta will most likely get the
starting nod. Pearce would then
have to move first baseman Sum
mer Lee to shortstop and play
Acosta at first base.
That substitution might prove
to be the wisest choice, even in the
event that Schneider feels well
enough to play. A rest in today's
games would give Schneider a two
week break before the team re
sumes Pac-10 play April 20 against
Oregon State. This weekend's pre
viously scheduled game against
San Jose State has been canceled,
giving the Cardinal over a week to
prepare for the Oregon trip.
"It really is a nice little break,"
Pearce said. "Any time you travel
it's tough. [The Arizona tripl was
tough. It's nice to be closer to
home."
Needless to say, a victory today
is essential for the Cardinal to
stay above .500 and could help
end the hex Stanford has encoun
tered against less-competitive
teams.
