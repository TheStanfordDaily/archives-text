# Chappie slate: dictators descending
## 
### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
Riding on a platform of free kegs at the ASSU of
fice, "The Dictators from Space" claim they've
adapted to new times.
Freshman Eugene Park, juniors Eric Saxon and
Chris Onstad and senior Sean Kennedy gave an in
terview to The Daily yesterday, only minutes after
arriving on campus from their respective planets to
campaign for Council of Presidents.
Each of the four previously was a dictator in his own
galaxy, but the group has now joined forces and is ready
to tackle the bureaucratic democracy of the ASSU.

"It needs to be revamped and purged," Onstad
said, "of its inefficiencies." Stalin-like purges are
not part of their platform, he said.
The four echoed common criticisms about the
ASSU and its legislative body: that they don't repre
sent the students, that they are not productive, and,
as Park said, that "a lot of people don't know what
COP stands for."
The slate is supported by the Hammer and Coffin
Party, and each of its four members works for the
Stanford Chaparral, the campus humor magazine.
Historically, the Hammer and Coffin Party has run
similarly extraordinary slates,
last year's being the "Very Seri
ous Clowns."
The totalitarian-turned demo
cratic rulers must win over three
other slates in the election, to be
held Wednesday and Thursday.
"We bring a new perspective on
things," Onstad said. "Students
want to let loose, party and get
their mind off politics."
To aid students in this quest,
the group plans to have a keg on
the ASSU porch 24 hours a day
while meeting students and hear
ing their concerns.
In addition, to make senators
more visible to the community,
each senator will be forced
"through violence" to wear an
anvil, hanging between his legs.
Saxon, in a violent demonstra
tion, said, "You see 'em all across
campus carrying their burden of
the students."
There are no plans for senators
to wear a scarlet letter, however.
In addition, using similar vio
lent tactics, the dictators will
force their competitors to fulfill
all of their campaign promises —
including, oddly enough, the slate
promising a single president.
The post office will be replaced
by a "porplex," an imported crea
ture which, Saxon said, can
process letters more quickly than
all the postal employees com
bined.

In a philanthropic move, the
slate announced it would donate
its salary to the Chaparral in
order to publish two extra is
sues.
But from headlines in The
I )aily, let alone those in the Chap
arral, the relationship between
the students and their govern
ment would be closer.
"If The Daily ran a headline
saying 'COP to have reforms' or a
headline saying, 'Dictators screw
ing.shit up and making things bet
ter for everyone,' which one do
you think the students would
read?" Kennedy asked.
But a Las Vegas oddsmaker

and high-ranking Daily official,
speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the probability
of the latter headline is quite
slim.
Using their space connection,
the dictators will use the Dish to
transmit intergalactic cable, not,
Onstad said, "as just a running
point."
To win the election, however,
the dictators will have to beat
three earthling slates. Members
hope voters will choose new blood
(to use the earth phrase) and not
"career" politicians.
"We're not resume packers,"
Kennedy said.
