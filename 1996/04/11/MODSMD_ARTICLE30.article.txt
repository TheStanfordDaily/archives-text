# Women's water polo revs up for MPSFs
## Stanford to face No. 1-ranked UCLA 
### Erin Bryla Contributing writer 
Members of the Stanford
women's water polo team will have
their work cut out for them this
weekend when the Cardinal heads
to Berkeley to compete in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Tournament. The women will
see many of the top teams in the
nation, but most importantly they
will play top-ranked UCLA.
The last time the Cardinal met
the Bruins, the game took place in
DeGuerre pool and Stanford fell 5-
1. But that was early in the season,
and Stanford is now poised to give
the Bruins a tough game.
"Our toughest game this week
end will be UCLA, which is No. 1 in
the nation," said head coach Ben
Quittner.
Stanford will meet UCLA on
Saturday at 12:30 p.m. Before that
match, the Cardinal will have a
game against UC-Santa Barbara.
Stanford has had no trouble with
UCSB in the past and is looking to
defeat the Gauchos once again.
"Maybe UCSB will be the easi
est game, but we have to focus on
all of them," Quittner said.
The other bracket will be a
tough battle between California
and San Diego St ate, both of whom

the Cardinal has never defeated.
SDSU and Cal split their two meet
ings earlier this year.
Stanford has come close to the
Golden Bears all season and would
welcome an opportunity to beat
them in their home pool. Mean
while, SDSU is a physical team that
beat up on the Cardinal in previous
games and the women would like a
chance to return the favor. Pacific,
San Diego State and USC round
out the bracket.
The winner of Stanford's
bracket will play the second-place
finisher in Cal's bracket on Sun
day morning in the semifinals. In
the other semifinal, the second
place finisher of Stanford's brack
et will face the winner of the Cal
bracket.
It's one of these semifinal
games that the Cardinal is shoot
ing for, but that will be no easy
task.
"Every game will be a tough
game. Three out of the four teams
are ranked above us," Quittner
said.
The winner of the two semifi
nals will collide in the MPSF cham
pionship game on Sunday after
noon.
"The team would like to be in
the championship game," Quit
tner said.

Quittner and the team will be
looking for the leadership of Alice
Cathcart and Heather Crary de
fensively. Crary has been almost
impenetrable in goal this season
and is a big reason the Cardinal has
attained its No. 5 ranking.
Hut if the team wants to be
successful against three of the
four top-ranked teams in the na

tion (Slippery Rock, the No. 2
team in the nation, will not be
there), the women will also have
to cut down on turnovers and,
more importantly, step it up on
offense.
"I am looking to Lindsay Tarn to
score a lot of goals, and I also would
like to get a lot of offense out of
Lindsay Welsh," Quittner said.
