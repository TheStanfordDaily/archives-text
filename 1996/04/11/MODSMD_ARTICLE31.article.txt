## Several top athletes to sit out this weekend's Golden Bear Challenge 
### Sam Wang Contributing writer 
Many key contributors for
the Stanford track and field
team will be working on their
tans and cheering on their
teammates from the sidelines
this weekend at the Pierce Gold
en Bear Challenge, held at Cali
fornia's Edward Stadium.
Coming off a tough meet
against Pacific 10 Conference
powerhouse Oregon and Wash
ington State — where the Cardi
nal men finished third and the
women took second — some
Stanford athletes are taking
this week off to rest some tired
legs and sore bodies.
"Anybody who has a little
nick or knack or anything that is
a little shaky will be held out,"
said head coach Vin Lananna.
Among the athletes who will
be rested are most of the dis
tance runners and the multi
event athletes. The Cardinal
has its eyes set on the Mt. San
Antonio College (Mt. SAC) Re
lays in Walnut, Calif., two
weeks from now, so Lananna
wants to be sure everyone will
be at their physical best then.
"This weekend, score-wise,
that's not really the big issue,"
said Lananna. "This is going to
be a weekend where we'll be
resting a lot of our athletes.
We're going to go after a big per
formance at Mt. SAC."
As for this weekend, when
Stanford will go up against
schools like Cal, USC, Texas and
Air Force, the Cardinal will be
shifting people around a little bit
— as it will be for the next three
weeks — to give athletes a
chance to qualify for Pac-lOs
and NCAAs. Stanford will turn
up the competitive fires again, at
least in terms of the team score,
when the Cardinal faces Cal on
May 4 in the annual Big Meet.
"We'll kind of pick and
choose our events this weekend

and that's what we'll do for the
next three weeks [in order to get
the best performances, though
not necessarily the best team
scorej," Lananna said.
"The meet that is really sig
nificant for us in a competitive
situation is the Cal-Stanford
dual meet and the Pac-lOs.
These are the two big competi
tion efforts we'll go after."
Stanford is hoping the injury
bug will also take a little time
off.
The Cardinal team was hit
with injuries to some very key
people last week, including ju
nior Jimmie Johnson, who
strained his groin during the 4 x
100 relay. Johnson's absence
meant the men lost points in the
200, 400, 4 x 400 and the 4 x
100.
The women also lost a impor
tant competitor in tri-captain
Tyra Holt. Holt strained her
hamstring the day before the
Oregon / Washington State
meet during warm-ups, costing
the women points in several
events, including the longjump,
the 400 and the 4 x 400.
However, Lananna was still
very proud of his athletes' per
formances and excited about
the possibilities with one month
left before the commencement
of championship competition at
the Pac-lOs and the NCAAs .
"On the men's side, we're just
a couple of weeks from having a
great, great year," said Lananna
of the men. "For the first time in
a long time, we really do have
very good short sprints and
jumps. Our throwers are always
great and the distance guys are
running spectacularly."
The women aren't bad. ei
ther. "Our women's team is re
ally strong," he said. "I'm very
excited about how our women's
team is shaping up in all events.
We have the most well-rounded,
well-balanced women's team
we've ever had."
