April is the Crudest Month . . .
Todny's birthday:
Your tarot card is the Woman of Cups. You
are serene and calm on the outside, but un
derneath the water your duck feet paddle like
crazy. Continue to take the moral high ground,
though your steadfast nature will be tested by
the one you love this spring. This winter,
though you may seem idle, you are working
things out in your mind. You have a strong
core that will help you emerge from a rocky
year unscathed.
Aries (March 21-April 19)
) Hang in there After all, tomorrow is
another day.
