# Born to Run run on

### Story graphic by Mike Noren 
Five minutes into our three-way
phone conversation, singer / gui
tarist Alan l.icht is talking about
the frequent travel-related themes on Run
Oil's debut I.P "Start Packing," while
singer / guitarist Sue Garner is bitter
about the troubles they're having with
their upcoming tour.
"We're a travelin' band," jokes l.icht.
. .that doesn't travel "concludes Ga
rner, disappointedly.
With an excellent new album just hit
ting stores, the time is right for touring,
but the loss of a band member and gener
al scheduling complications have limited
the group to infrequent gigs in their
hometown of New York, l.icht explains
the problem: "We don't have a manager or
someone breathing down someone's neck
all the time, trying to push us into some
kind of front-line position in the indie
rock battleground." And so it's up to the
band to work out the kinks in its own
touring schedule, which has proven to be
a significant task.
Hul even while they're stuck at home,
Run On are all about motion. Prom the
initial acceleration of "Tried" to the final
mutations of "Surprise," the new record
delivers song after song of smart lyrics anil
gripping melody, each track propelled
frontwards by odd rhythms and inspired
interplay. Tracks like "Go There'* and

"Surprise" are repetitive, but they fin
ish miles away from where they start
ed, always unfolding, developing and,
well, moving.
"A lot of the songs mention
movement or travel," I icht points out.
" 'Cause I want to travel," Garner

interjects with a laugh. "It was wishful
thinking."
Sue Garner, Alan l.icht, drummer
Rick Brown and recently departed
multi-instrumentalist David New
garden debuted as Run On last year with
their "On / Off" F.P, a tiny five-song gem
on Matador Records. The band had only
played together for a short time at that
point, yet they pulled off a pair of ambi
tious pop tracks, a stunning ballad and a
couple of atmospheric experiments with
remarkable cohesion. "Water" rumbled
with Brown's dense, innovative drum
work, while "Into the Attic" showed a
smart pop band making use of every mu
sical instrument they could get their
hands 011.
"On / Off" promised great things, and
"Start Packing" delivers. On "Start Pack
ing," Run Oil's soundscapes blur the line
between beauty and invention, making
experimental pop songs so catchy that
you barely notice that they're experimen
tal. Licht and Garner trade off vocal duties
over driving rhythms and rich guitar tex
tures, with occasional piano, accordion,
organ, synth or tuba thrown in for good
measure. Brown's drumming, lull with
odd meters and weird time signatures,
goes beyond keeping time — as Garner
points out, "He'll add a melody as much

as anything."
On "Miscalculation," the group whips
up a junkyard of razor-sharp guitar noise,
organ blasts and frenzied beats, with Gar
ner's smooth vocals somewhere above it
all, until the track self-destructs after an
all too-brief 91 seconds. Other highlights
include Garners "Tell Me" and Licht's
"Doesn't Anybody Love the Dark," but
Brown's "Xmas Trip" offers the biggest
jolt. Halfway through the record, follow
ing a mighty drum lead-in, Brown starts
spewing something about a cassette of
"Daydream Nation," a CBGB t-shirt, a
Christmas drive and Bernadette Peters, in
what ultimately amounts to one of the
most engaging bits of loudmouth pop in
memory. The track gains momentum
with each rowdy chorus, until a trumpet
comes in and makes everything seem so
regal.
As you'd expect from a group that cites
"each other" as their biggest musical in
fluence, the Run On approach to song
writing is an interactive one. One member
might come up with the skeleton for a
song, but everyone builds on it from
there, until they come up with a collective
rewrite that's usually vastly different from
the original. "I'm always happier with the
end result after everyone's worked on it
than at the beginning," Garner says."It
definitely changes."
"I think because there's not one prima
ry songwriter in the band, there's less of a
follow-the-leader-type idea," l.icht says.
"I think everyone kind of sticks their own
two cents in when we're writing songs."
A similar teamwork was involved in the
production of the new record. Whereas

for "On / Off" the group simply wrote
songs and recorded them in a 24-track
studio, Run On recorded "Start Packing
in different sessions with different engi
neers, tailoring recording methods to fit
individual songs: "We thought a lot more
about which (songs) we wanted to sound
more dense and lush, and which ones we
could get away with just recording in
eight-track studios," Licht explains. "We
customized the recording to the songs
more."
Still, despite the different sessions (in
cluding one in Chicago with John McEn
tire of Tortoise, Gastr del Sol and Sea and
Cake fame), "Start Packing" achieves re
markable consistency and a surprisingly
natural flow. Licht too seems amazed:
"Even sonically, especially on the vinyl
version, it's not apparent which ones were
recorded on eight-track and which ones
were recorded on 24."
Before Run On, Garner, l icht and
Brown put out loads of worthwhile
but underappreciated records with
groups like Love Child, Fish and Roses,
the Blue Humans, the Shams and others.
But with "Start Packing," it appears that
they've stumbled upon the right formula,
as the album has been consistently and
enthusiastically well-received. The group
has just finished making a video lor
"Xmas Trip," and Garner pleasingly re
ports that a friend told her that two tracks
— "Xmas Trip" and "Baap" — are getting
a good bit of commercial radio play.
"Go figure," Garner says with a happy
sort of shrug. "I certainly don't quite get
it, but I'm glad it's happening."

rock battleground." And so it's up to the
band to work out the kinks in its own
touring schedule, which has proven to be
a significant task.
Hul even while they're stuck at home,
Run On are all about motion. Prom the
initial acceleration of "Tried" to the final
mutations of "Surprise," the new record
delivers song after song of smart lyrics anil
gripping melody, each track propelled
frontwards by odd rhythms and inspired
interplay. Tracks like "Go There'* and

"Surprise" are repetitive, but they fin
ish miles away from where they start
ed, always unfolding, developing and,
well, moving.
"A lot of the songs mention
movement or travel," I icht points out.
" 'Cause I want to travel," Garner

interjects with a laugh. "It was wishful
thinking."
Sue Garner, Alan l.icht, drummer
Rick Brown and recently departed
multi-instrumentalist David New
garden debuted as Run On last year with
their "On / Off" F.P, a tiny five-song gem
on Matador Records. The band had only
played together for a short time at that
point, yet they pulled off a pair of ambi
tious pop tracks, a stunning ballad and a
couple of atmospheric experiments with
remarkable cohesion. "Water" rumbled
with Brown's dense, innovative drum
work, while "Into the Attic" showed a
smart pop band making use of every mu
sical instrument they could get their
hands 011.
"On / Off" promised great things, and
"Start Packing" delivers. On "Start Pack
ing," Run Oil's soundscapes blur the line
between beauty and invention, making
experimental pop songs so catchy that
you barely notice that they're experimen
tal. Licht and Garner trade off vocal duties
over driving rhythms and rich guitar tex
tures, with occasional piano, accordion,
organ, synth or tuba thrown in for good
measure. Brown's drumming, lull with
odd meters and weird time signatures,
goes beyond keeping time — as Garner
points out, "He'll add a melody as much

as anything."
On "Miscalculation," the group whips
up a junkyard of razor-sharp guitar noise,
organ blasts and frenzied beats, with Gar
ner's smooth vocals somewhere above it
all, until the track self-destructs after an
all too-brief 91 seconds. Other highlights
include Garners "Tell Me" and Licht's
"Doesn't Anybody Love the Dark," but
Brown's "Xmas Trip" offers the biggest
jolt. Halfway through the record, follow
ing a mighty drum lead-in, Brown starts
spewing something about a cassette of
"Daydream Nation," a CBGB t-shirt, a
Christmas drive and Bernadette Peters, in
what ultimately amounts to one of the
most engaging bits of loudmouth pop in
memory. The track gains momentum
with each rowdy chorus, until a trumpet
comes in and makes everything seem so
regal.
As you'd expect from a group that cites
"each other" as their biggest musical in
fluence, the Run On approach to song
writing is an interactive one. One member
might come up with the skeleton for a
song, but everyone builds on it from
there, until they come up with a collective
rewrite that's usually vastly different from
the original. "I'm always happier with the
end result after everyone's worked on it
than at the beginning," Garner says."It
definitely changes."
"I think because there's not one prima
ry songwriter in the band, there's less of a
follow-the-leader-type idea," l.icht says.
"I think everyone kind of sticks their own
two cents in when we're writing songs."
A similar teamwork was involved in the
production of the new record. Whereas

for "On / Off" the group simply wrote
songs and recorded them in a 24-track
studio, Run On recorded "Start Packing
in different sessions with different engi
neers, tailoring recording methods to fit
individual songs: "We thought a lot more
about which (songs) we wanted to sound
more dense and lush, and which ones we
could get away with just recording in
eight-track studios," Licht explains. "We
customized the recording to the songs
more."
Still, despite the different sessions (in
cluding one in Chicago with John McEn
tire of Tortoise, Gastr del Sol and Sea and
Cake fame), "Start Packing" achieves re
markable consistency and a surprisingly
natural flow. Licht too seems amazed:
"Even sonically, especially on the vinyl
version, it's not apparent which ones were
recorded on eight-track and which ones
were recorded on 24."
Before Run On, Garner, l icht and
Brown put out loads of worthwhile
but underappreciated records with
groups like Love Child, Fish and Roses,
the Blue Humans, the Shams and others.
But with "Start Packing," it appears that
they've stumbled upon the right formula,
as the album has been consistently and
enthusiastically well-received. The group
has just finished making a video lor
"Xmas Trip," and Garner pleasingly re
ports that a friend told her that two tracks
— "Xmas Trip" and "Baap" — are getting
a good bit of commercial radio play.
"Go figure," Garner says with a happy
sort of shrug. "I certainly don't quite get
it, but I'm glad it's happening."
