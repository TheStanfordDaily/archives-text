# Faculty search for sophomore solution
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The success of the University's Sopho
more College initiative has many faculty
members clamoring for similar teaching and
advising efforts directed at greater numbers
of undergraduates.
But while administrators acknowledge
the importance of such programs, they con
cede that a comprehensive system available
for all sophomores may still be a long way off.
Sophomore College, which premiered this
year, was an attempt to present advising in
formation at a different time, when students
might be more prepared to make use of it,
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
Ramon Saldi'var said.
While the program was successful and
many of the 50 students involved took ad
vantage of the information they were given,
more efforts should be made to get the mes
sage out to all students, some faculty mem
bers say.
Sophomore College meets for two weeks
in September, placing students in small
classes taught by senior faculty and offering
special programs each afternoon.
Students involved in the program gave
both the classes and the advising sessions an

overwhelmingly positive evaluation. Now
that a form of advising has been found to
work, faculty members say, it should be ex
panded.

The opportunities pro
vided by Sophomore Col
lege are "part of the defini
tion of what college is sup
posed to accomplish," said
Biology Prof. Robert Si
moni. Developing a men
toring relationship with
faculty, small class interac
tion and contact with pro
grams outside the academ
ic core should all be includ-

Ed in a general education, he said.
"All those things sounded great, but they
sounded to me like they were things that
should be available to all students," Simoni
said.
Although Sophomore College will expand
to eight classes for 80 students this fall, it
cannot cover the entire sophomore class,
Saldi'var said. Instead, other methods must
be developed to make students aware of their
opportunities.
