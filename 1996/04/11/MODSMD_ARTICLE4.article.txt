# Faculty search for sophomore solution
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The success of the University's Sopho
more College initiative has many faculty
members clamoring for similar teaching and
advising efforts directed at greater numbers
of undergraduates.
But while administrators acknowledge
the importance of such programs, they con
cede that a comprehensive system available
for all sophomores may still be a long way off.
Sophomore College, which premiered this
year, was an attempt to present advising in
formation at a different time, when students
might be more prepared to make use of it,
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
Ramon Saldi'var said.
While the program was successful and
many of the 50 students involved took ad
vantage of the information they were given,
more efforts should be made to get the mes
sage out to all students, some faculty mem
bers say.
Sophomore College meets for two weeks
in September, placing students in small
classes taught by senior faculty and offering
special programs each afternoon.
Students involved in the program gave
both the classes and the advising sessions an

overwhelmingly positive evaluation. Now
that a form of advising has been found to
work, faculty members say, it should be ex
panded.

The opportunities pro
vided by Sophomore Col
lege are "part of the defini
tion of what college is sup
posed to accomplish," said
Biology Prof. Robert Si
moni. Developing a men
toring relationship with
faculty, small class interac
tion and contact with pro
grams outside the academ
ic core should all be includ-

Ed in a general education, he said.
"All those things sounded great, but they
sounded to me like they were things that
should be available to all students," Simoni
said.
Although Sophomore College will expand
to eight classes for 80 students this fall, it
cannot cover the entire sophomore class,
Saldi'var said. Instead, other methods must
be developed to make students aware of their
opportunities.
"1 don't see Sophomore College as the so-


Saldi'var
lution to all the problems of advis
ing," Saldfvar said. "Once we have
Sophomore College really well in
hand ... we should be developing
ways of expanding those programs
in other forms."
He said next year the Under
graduate Advising Center may pro
vide some of the workshops offered
to Sophomore College students at
dorms, but no other ideas are in the
works yet.
Biology Prof. Pat Jones said she
suggests an event at the beginning
of sophomore year where various
offices on campus would hand out
information on opportunities avail
able to undergraduates. Simoni
said a "sophomore orientation" a
few days before classes begin could
be another solution.
The beginning of sophomore
year is a key time to advise stu
dents, Saldfvar said, although he
added that the best method is "to
get [the information out] at several
points."
"You should have those things
right ofT the bat," he said. "You
should also be hearing them during
the course of your freshman years.

But a really great time is before
sophomore year."
At that point, Saldfvar said,
"You've got some experience....
You probably have some questions,
but those questions are more so
phisticated."
Information provided by the Un
dergraduate Advising Center is
"not just abstract information for
sophomores who have a better idea
of what they might want to do," he
added. "It's information with a pur
pose."
Laura Selznick, director of Un
dergraduate Research Opportuni
ties, agreed. Students at Sopho
more College "are people who are
ready to apply some knowledge
they've learned," she said.
Regardless of how it is distrib
uted, the information needs to get
out, Jones said.
"Sophomore College is a won
derful program, but to limit that in
formation distribution to a small
number of students â€” that's won
derful for them, but if [the advising
center] thinks it's a need, they
should focus on how to get the in
formation to as many students as
possible," she said.
"It's not the sort of thing where
you can call a meeting because no
one ever shows up," Simoni said.
"You need to reach a lot of people."
