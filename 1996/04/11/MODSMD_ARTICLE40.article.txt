### Jen Graves 
The French Surrealist Salvador Dali
once said: "The first man to compare a
rose to a woman was surely a poet. The
tirst to repeat it was possibly an idiot." The
Surrealist project, in the '30s and '40s,
worked on a new appraisal of the visual land
scape, a way of interpreting the world instead
of simply seeing it. Therefore, what became
important for a painting was not a sense of
beauty in the traditional sense, hut the otter

ing of a fresh perspective, completely unique.
Alonso Smith, whose works are now on
exhibit at the Bechtel International Center,
made his first paintings in the early 19405.
His work is a perfect example of the out
growth of Surrealism that developed art as a
medium for political exposure and social
concern. As a Social Surrealist, Smith com
ments that, "The obligation of the artist is to
reflect reality," which he experiences as "the

apocalyptic madness of
nations, the destruction
of environment, the fran
tic pursuit of wealth or
pleasure, the flattening
effect of technology on
the human spirit."
In Surrealist tradition,
Smith portrays famous
political figures in terms
previously unseen, and
his depictions certainly
make a humorous depar
ture from the hland ac
ceptance these figures re
ceive on national televi
sion daily. A fire-red,
triple-headed Nixon with
green hair and footballs
for breasts; the most fa
mous Al/heimer s victim
and ex-president Ronald
Reagan, defecating
bombs with red peace
signs inscribed on them;
the powerful medical
malpractioner with red
fangs and .1 fork and
knife. These figures are
laughing demons,
perched atop piles of
golden coins.
Smith's father was a pro
fessor of Romance lan
guages and literature .it
Stanford, and was strict
about the singular lan
guage of French in the
home, as well as the daily
tutoring of French litera
ture. The use of allusions,
visual metaphors and the
rich fabric of symbolism
apparent in Smith's
paintings can be traced
back to these classical dis
ciplines.
The Latin inscription
'veritas' (truth) is satiri
cally printed in capital
letters between the but
tons 011 the front of a tele
vision set in his 1971
painting, "Cornucopia."
The grandeur of a dead
language and the degra
dation of this technologi-

cal cornucopia enhances his irony. Inside the
American nightmare of this red, white and
blue cornucopia is a grossly over-indulged
family of three and their belongings: "With
their supermacho car and the housewife's ul
timate appliance falling from the overloaded
carpet, they need not concern themselves
with the oil spills, rockets, Tinkertoy trees in
the stumps of denuded forests, nor with the
weapons that support the source of their

pleasures." Smith's mini texts, exhibited
alongside the paintings, are written with the
same light touch ol sardonic wit that infuses
his visual imagery.
I'he darkness of Smith's political and so
cial commentary is most often underscored
by a single image in the background ol the
painting that creates a sense of hope. In his
"Cornucopia," it is a beacon of relief: a marti
ni! In another painting, entitled "Vain his
course on Ecology," there is a lone star in the
otherwise pollution-clouded sky.
"Vain Discourse, made in 1%9, is.i mon
strous warning about the future of humanity
and reproduction. Two "self-inseminating,
nonmammalian mutants' dominate the
scene, the landscape a mixture of fire and
water. The horizon is inhabited by smoking
factories, the only human products apparent
in the picture except for a twisted red baby,
stuck in a web connected to two beasts. The
destruction ol this environment has taken its
toll on the reproductive nature of the popula
tion as well, and intercourse has been re
placed by auto intercourse, disallowing any
biological need for love, and soft nipples have
been converted into green horns, disconnect
ing the maternal instinct.
112 irst, the color ol Smith's paintings draws
the viewer in. Then, the endless detail he sup
plies keeps the eye occupied for hours. And
finally, the discussions these paintings engen
der are complex and relevant: nuclear war
fare, political corruption, malpractice of all
kinds and the problems at the heart of any
profit driven society.
In an especially pertinent painting of
1985, "Higher Education II: Pedagogical
Chaos," a massive professor rides his eye
glasses (in order to see where he's going) 011 a
road leading away from the university. An egg
with a peace sign is about to be smashed as he
is expunged from the institution, taking with
him the humanities and leaving only a mas
sive, calculating computer spitting out non
sensical "answers." Smith writes about this
painting: "Everywhere the liberal arts arc
being destroyed, despite pleading hands of
the tree of knowledge and pyres of burning
hooks."
A recurring message can be found in many
of Smith's paintings in the Latin phrase, "Fiat
Lux," meaning, "Let there be light." Perhaps
these paintings, too, are a source of light.
They shed a creative beam on the world we
only see in mass media, disclosing new points
of view in an all-too-familiar narrative.
Smith is a poet whose poetics are accessible to
all of us.

otherwise pollution-clouded sky.
"Vain Discourse, made in 1%9, is.i mon
strous warning about the future of humanity
and reproduction. Two "self-inseminating,
nonmammalian mutants' dominate the
scene, the landscape a mixture of fire and
water. The horizon is inhabited by smoking
factories, the only human products apparent
in the picture except for a twisted red baby,
stuck in a web connected to two beasts. The
destruction ol this environment has taken its
toll on the reproductive nature of the popula
tion as well, and intercourse has been re
placed by auto intercourse, disallowing any
biological need for love, and soft nipples have
been converted into green horns, disconnect
ing the maternal instinct.
112 irst, the color ol Smith's paintings draws
the viewer in. Then, the endless detail he sup
plies keeps the eye occupied for hours. And
finally, the discussions these paintings engen
der are complex and relevant: nuclear war
fare, political corruption, malpractice of all
kinds and the problems at the heart of any
profit driven society.
In an especially pertinent painting of
1985, "Higher Education II: Pedagogical
Chaos," a massive professor rides his eye
glasses (in order to see where he's going) 011 a
road leading away from the university. An egg
with a peace sign is about to be smashed as he
is expunged from the institution, taking with
him the humanities and leaving only a mas
sive, calculating computer spitting out non
sensical "answers." Smith writes about this
painting: "Everywhere the liberal arts arc
being destroyed, despite pleading hands of
the tree of knowledge and pyres of burning
hooks."
A recurring message can be found in many
of Smith's paintings in the Latin phrase, "Fiat
Lux," meaning, "Let there be light." Perhaps
these paintings, too, are a source of light.
They shed a creative beam on the world we
only see in mass media, disclosing new points
of view in an all-too-familiar narrative.
Smith is a poet whose poetics are accessible to
all of us.
