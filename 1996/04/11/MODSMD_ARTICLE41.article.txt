## 20-something Cyber-soap a waste 
### Liz Chien 
Although the In
ternet is probably
one of, if not the
most brilliant and
useful invention of
the 20th century,
there are certain
things on the World
Wide Web that sim
ply don't need to
exist. Example?
"The East Village,"

is a new cyber-soap opera about a "tastefully"
neurotic woman named Eve and her exploits
in the Big Apple. Besides the fact that this is
obviously another "Friends"-spawned-20-
something-group-of-incredibly-attractive
men-and-women-all-living-in-very-close-
quarters-and-hanging-out-in-coffee-shops

type of show, "The East Village" takes on the
format of a comic strip. However, the graph
ics aren't funny cartoons, but pictures of Eve
and her court of admirers.
The character "Eve" is from upstate New
York, but has the class and sophistication of a
Manhattan native. Her bio states that she has
"blue walls in her apartment," as if this tidbit
were to make the audience like her more, or
reaffirm her "tasteful" neurosis. In addition,
Eve doesn't enjoy sports — watching or play
ing — of any kind. Is this characteristic sup
posed to make her seem more feminine? In
any case, Eve has a grand social life that "most
people would envy," according to her biogra
phy. Well, of course, she has a great social life!
The producers must make it seem like Eve
has a lovely life so that all the women in the
world (who can access the World Wide Web)
would want to watch. Or else, who would fol
low the darn show?

"The East Village" is the first dramatic en
tertainment property to join the Time Warn
er Pathfinder site repertoire. By using a new
medium for soap operas that merges video,
audio, photography and text, this show is
unique in its format. However, the maxim,
don't judge a book by its cover, definitely
holds true here. Apart from the fabulous
technology that makes "The East Village"
possible, the content of the show is one step
above worthless. You can probably find a su
permarket romance novel with better writ
ing, creativity, description and action than
this D.O.A. idea. Just an example of the bril
liant inspiration and prose that makes this
cyber-soap famous: . .and she was named
Eve, because she was the mother of all living
things." This is how the first episode begins,
which is incredibly ironic because the behav
ior of the characters (Eve and Co.) is any
thing but Christian or even religious, for that

matter. Another instance of "The East Vil
lage's" facetiousness is seen in one scene
where Eve and her friend Duncan, the requisite
stud-muffin, are stagnating in a bar passing
judgment on people's clothes. Eve concludcs
with the demi-thought that "for a boy, [Dun
can] has incredible taste in clothes." Huh? In
terestingly enough, this paragraph has a link to
another page that lists all of Eve's "fashion
crimes," like a shirt tucked into pants without
wearing a belt or stockings darker than shoes.
This girl has way too much time on her hands.
"The East Village" provides a great source of
entertainment after you have finished studying
or writing a paper. In any case, the show is sim
ply so ridiculous that you just have to laugh,
even if mockingly. I would suggest that if you're
bored and need to find some source of
ha-ha, check out "The East Village" at
