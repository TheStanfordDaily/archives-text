entertain you, and he intends to
do it without magic tricks, clown
wigs, door prizes or nudity. The
Stanford junior, a native of San
Jose, has no formal acting expe
rience, but he has a lot of sto
ries to tell in his monologue,
"Magical Costa Rican Mints."

"I was feeling alienated from artistic
instincts," he says."I wanted to get things
going again." Getting things going meant
creating and rehearsing a two-hour per
formance from a sequence of stories, all
about adolescence, that kept popping up
like irascible acne. From "Boom Boom
Boom, Let's Go Back to my Room" to
breakfast at Denny's, the monologue is a
preview of reminiscence, a guide to the
resources of memory that writers and
performers of our generation will draw
on in 15 years.
"Magical Gosta Rican Mints,' named
for some loot Delson brought back from
the other San Jose, wins the Honesty in
Advertising award: it is about adoles
cence. Delson's adolescence, probably
not too much of a departure from any
one else's, meant a lot of thinking about
sex. From middle school to high school
he charts the (lux of his anxieties, from
fear of fat to fear of being excluded from

"the sexual cult."
Although a bespectacled, red-headed
Jewish man talking about sex might
sound a little less than novel to some,
Delson is not aping Woody Allen. "This
is a very individual piece," Delson says,
careful to distinguish his work from the
camp ground of self-styled ethnic
humor. In fact, if Delson has a conscious
precedent or model, it is not a comedian
but storyteller Spalding Gray. Gray's
monologues, "Sex and Death to the Age
14" and "Swimming to Gambodia" ex
posed Delson to the sound and syntax of
the spoken performance when he read
them last summer.
The kernel of the monologue is a story
Delson found himself telling to friends
over and over; other stories stuck to the
branch and he soon assembled them into
a comprehensible sequence. He has
never written the entire monologue
down, though he has a few pages of

notes. All of the diary entries are authen
tic, including a sixth-grade gem like,
"she's got a good bod and is trendy but I
don't think she likes me."
Delson first presented his monologue
in December for friends in Berkeley.
After a few more rehearsals, one in front
of San Jose friends (including some who
found their way into the narration) he
performed lor Synergy house. Fncour
aged to reach a larger audience, he decid
ed to perform for the general public at
Stanford. Without any connections to
the Drama Department, Delson rented
theater space and designed publicity
posters. Two friends will help take tick
ets and run the sound board, but oth
erwise Delson has been running his
own show from start to finish — with a
refreshing lack of professional creden
tials.
Delson admits some anxiety about
how listeners will respond to his one-

man show. "My friends already know my
personality and are interested in my
quirks." A less intimate audience might
also be less generous. "If I can keep some
one's mind away from their worries for a
few hours, that would be the highest
compliment," he says. "But I really have
no idea what kind of reception I'll get."
Audience participation and feedback are
an important part of the performance.
I le adds: "The audience has just listened
to me for two hours, and there's no rea
son I shouldn't listen to them if they have
something to tell me."

WHAT: "Magical Gosta Rican Mints"
WHEN: April 11,12, and 13 at 8 p.m.
