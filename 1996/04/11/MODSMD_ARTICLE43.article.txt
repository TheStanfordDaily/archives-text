The country's run amuck on a new drug,
and that new drug is happiness. Fol
lowing the trail to this dastardly deed
leads to Planet Hollywood in downtown San
Francisco, where "Kids in the 11all" star Scott
Thompson shares his insight on the new film
"Kids in the I fall Brain (Handy" which will he
in Bay Area theaters tomorrow, April 12.
Thompson is asked to explain the tremen
dous cult following behind the Kids: "Uhh,
because." I le pauses.
I le smiles and looks us in the eye, ready to
deliver a whammy. "We've replaced religion in
a godless society." A chorus of laughter natu
rally ensues, warming up his very receptive
press audience. When the Queen speaks, peo
ple listen.
OK, so you might have to be there. ()r all ot
you might not have to be there to get their
humor. It may be .1 sick sense of humor a lot of
the time, but it's hysterical to me and to many
people who follow the Kids. They're emulated
by many groups, such as MTV's the State, but
no one can capture what they have. If you're
the type ot person who finds suburban satire
and men cross-dressing to be funny, the Kids
are lor you. II von find gay lounge li/ards and
drag queens to be entertaining, Thompson is
for you. One of the most visible of the Kids
(comments like, "Oh, he's the gay one," or
"Oh, he's the smart blond," are common
when referring to him), he's the reason I
hauled ass to get here.
Walking into Planet I lollywood is always a
surreal experience. Paraphernalia from every
movie and TV show, massive and mediocre,
adorn the walls. I ike a Vegas casino, the rugs
are hideously patterned; in this case, a leop
aril skin design that begs the eye to move up
wards. Then the eye gets rammed by the pas
tel green and pink plastic tablecloth. Well, it />
Planet I lollywood. The kitsch is a fitting envi
ronment for our guest of honor.
The other college journalists and members
of the gay press .ire here buzzing with antici

pation, eagerly awaiting the entry of the
Queen himself.
I et me explain a little something lor those
of you who might not know what a gigantic
trip it is to be in the same room with Scott
Thompson. He's the man. And sometimes,
he's the woman. He is what makes watching
the Kids so much fun for me. He's the flamer
of the group, the spa rk of comic flair that con
sistently has me rolling 011 the floor of my
modest apartment.
While the other journalists are casting their
drink orders with the tropical shirt-wearing
waiter, I look about for signs that he's in the
building. Nothing seems to be happening. A
few minutes before he's due to address, I no
tice the lights turned on in the corner booth ol
the room.
Oh my (iod, it's him. Funny, he looks real
ly low key, not at all the flamboyant queen he
a*.ts like 011 the show, (latching glimpses ot
him from behind the various lights and cam
eras and not wanting to embarrass myself by
jumping up and scurrying to the set, I see he's
shaved oil most of his gorgeous blond locks,
leaving a kiddie crew-cut in the process. His
signature smile with his hawk-like nose is al
ways perked lor a Kodak moment. The cam
era loves him and he loves the camera.
Wearing a green crewneck sweater and
d.irk brown suede jeans, he comes over to talk
to us. He's not very tall, maybe 5-6 or 5-7.
They've set up a seat for him below the moni
tor set up in the room (they've got monitors
all over the place). The Planet I lollywood and
Paramount people want to show us a trailer of
the film, even though all of us had just
screened it the night before at the Variety club.
The monitor is stuck on a still of Forrest
(lump. Thompson, ever the improv comic, is
quick with commentary. "It's a lot like Forrest
(iump," he says, "Like it so far?" As if on cue,
the trailer begins with the dialogue already tar
behind. Again, 'Thompson is 011. " This is so
surreal. I like movies with dialogue. This looks

l.uropean." I think it's like those Asian kung
fu movies where the dubbing never quite
seems to match up, paving the way for ama
teur comics everywhere for a cheap act.
After some stopping and starting, the trail
er finally rolls. Funny thing is, about half the
scenes in the trailer have been cut by the time
the movie was finished. It's too bad. Some
choice scenes seem to have been cut. But what
remains is a surprisingly polished narrative
that tries to recapture the spirit of the long
running TV show. Generally, Thompson
seems pleased with it.
Thompson, acting modest, comes back to
his assigned seat below the monitor as the
journalists start firing away with their ques
tions. He's relaxed and very comfortable an
swering the questions. You'd think he'd done
this all his life. He definitely knows how to
work a room.
Like the rest of the Kids, he is a master of
disguise. Thompson plays a variety ot
roles in the film, which revolves around a
pretty simple narrative: a failing drug compa
ny, Roritor Pharmaceuticals, is looking for a
new drug to boost its sales. ()ne of their lab out
fits has been working on an anti-depressant in
pill form, and one of their subjects, Thomp
son's grandmotherly Mrs. Hurdicure, Patient
# 1 >57, shows the first positive signs of recovery.
The drug locks onto the happiest moment of
the taker's life and makes the taker re-experi
ence that moment for awhile. The remainder of
the film is filled with more Kids characters, old
and new, fighting corporate America, chronic
happiness and bad music videos.
The other Kids, Mark McKinney, Dave
Foley ("Newsradio"), Bruce McClulloch and
Kevin McDonald, play a variety of roles as
well. Flach ol them takes off on different tan
gents. McKinney's Dan Roritor is the chief ex
ecutive whose sock colors dictate what mood
he's in and what color carpet gets rolled out
for him. Folev's random guvs dot the land

scape while his smooth right hand man for
Roritor is a model for Smithers, Mr. Burn's
faithful assistant on "The Simpsons." McCul
lough's Alice is a role Thompson envies, wish
ing his Cathy could've accompanied such a
woman. Alice is forever pining away for Mac-
Donald's Dr. Cooper, the inventor of the drug.
Mac Donald falls from the grace of scientific
credibility, succumbing to fame and fortune
and forgetting the deadly consequences of his
experiments.
Thompson is very generous to his costars,
who have been such a tight ensemble the past
few years. Of Kevin Mac Donald, who play:,
the egomaniac Dr. Cooper who invents the
drug, he says, "He's purely hilarious. Kven his
sweat smells funny."
Thompson's Wally is a middle class dad
whose homosexuality is apparent to every
one, including his kids and wife, but him.
Wally masturbates in front ofgay porn videos,
gyrating to a soundtrack of techno beats.
Wally's caught with his pants down at dark or
gies where throngs of gay men tile out when
someone busts in. Wally's denial process is IT
nally released through the drug as it acceler
ates his coming out process. Soon he is pranc
ing about town in sailor outfits with his new
hunky lover.
Thompson's just as comfortable getting in
touch with his feminine side, basing many of
his female characters on the women in his life.
One of the staples of the Kids, Fran, is a
frumpy housewife who Thompson says is his
mother. Thompson's Baxter, a scientist in the
movie, is modeled on Fran Liebowitz. How
ever, Thompson doesn't want to get on her
bad side, so even if the look is all Fran, the
butchy behavior isn't. Yeah, right.
The Kids, infamous for their irreverent at
tacks on authority and suburbia, find no ex
ceptions in this film. Corporate America,
white trash, club kids, talk show hosts and
dysfunctional families are equally picked
apart and spat out with glee by the Kids.

Thompson explains how standards in
Canada differ from those of the U.S.
In Canada, where the Kids debuted
on (>BC (the Canadian Broadcasting (Corpo
ration) in 1989, their antics ranged from
practically spanking each others fannies to
dressing in leather S&M outfits. Tamer U.S.
standards kept most of the episodes, but
censored more controversial ones when the
Kids premiered on HBO in 1989.
"It's a lot freer in Canada," Thompson
says, then adds for comic affect, "I'm not
saying we're like the Dutch, we're not hang
ing out and smoking pot in cafes, but our
standards are very different. In television we
got away with a lot more. And we were on
regular TV at nine o'clock."
I le and I talk about how popular the show
is on the Internet, how all the offspring of the
Kids have used the Net to record such things
as every censored line on the show.
"American standards are so different. But
things are changing," he says, "You can say
ass' now." One of the Planet Hollywood
people comment, "But we don't get to see
cute asses like yours. We have to settle tor
Dennis Franz on NYPD Blue.''
Thompson quips, "You can't fantasize
about Dennis Franz's butt?"
lie is amazed at the zealousness of some
of his fans, and not a little impressed. He has
jumped on the Internet wave with the estab
lishment of his own web site, dubbed Scott
land. Found at http://www.scottland.com, it
is the brainchild of Thompson's character,
the Queen, and several other characters who
inhabit cyberspace as ministers of Thomp
son's make-believe government. He enters
the chat rooms often, as his characters. Be
coming a citizen allows access to these cen
ters of cyberconversation and privileged vot
ing rights, electing one of Thompson's many
characters to office.
Thompson is refreshingly candid and
honest about his aspirations toward star

dom. A longtime fan of celebrities, Thomp
son is out to decorate his own star, whether
it be with take furs or wigs or spandex hot
pants. He just wants this movie to break
even. And in his native Canada, this whole
self-promotion deal is very unseemly.
"Canadians don't mob," he says, "They're
not allowed to. They consider it embarrass
ing. I have to be a star here and then they'll
like me."
Since the film is about happiness, 1 ask
Thompson what his happiest moment was.
He says he's been asked this many times, but
he still seems uncertain as to which happy
moment he'd like to be locked into for eter
nity. Unlike his character, Wally, who gets
locked into a fuck-fest as a military man,
Thompson's happiest moment is something
much simpler and much more innocent.
"1 think our happiest moments are very,
very, very tiny things. I remember when I
was very small, we had this really big bay
window, we lived by the lake, and it over
looked the lake and the light would come in
to this one spot. I just remember as a child 1
would always go there when the light was
coming in and lie there. I would take all my
clothes off. I And I would be almost six or
seven. That was bliss, you know."
Thompson's candor infiltrates every
interaction, his silliness and sharp wit
punctuating his every answer. And yet
the serious side of him comes out as well de
fending his position as a gay performer.
Thompson is seriously outspoken when it
comes to this.
Thompson came out when he was 24, but
he knew early on he was attracted to boys
and then men.
As a teenager, he was obsessed with James
Dean, Montgomery Clitt and Francis
Farmer. Th<*n I realized they all died tragi
cally, and it was time

to choose new heroes.
The only gay mem
ber of the Kids, from
the beginning he's
taken roles that shoot
from the hip of gay
life.
He jabs at a re
porter from a national
quarterly gay and les
bian magazine. "You
mean you only have to
be a quarter gay? I'm
more than half, and 97
percent water."
When someone
asks him if he was
"kind of disappoint
ed" as to the lack of ex
posure gay actors get,
he answers, "A little?
and gestures his hands
for the more sign. The
journalist answers,
"Immen s c I y ? "
Thompson shakes his
head and says, "More
like ballistic."
"I think the so
called gay leaders arc
very insecure. I think
the gay community is
really fragile and can t
take a joke and is too
immature to be sati
rized.
"I think that the last

few years all people wanted was propaganda.
They wanted everything to be empowering
and positive. And I think 1 was considered
somebody who was telling bad secrets. 1 was
just doing my job, you know."
He tells those gay activists who attack his
so-called stereotypical portrayals, "Just get a
sense of humor. I don't understand why peo
ple refuse to admit that some ot these stereo
types are based in reality. I find it so surreal
to have a gay man who sounds incredibly gay
telling me that buddy Cole, there aren't peo
ple like that!"
"There's nothing wrong with being ef
feminate. I just think, you know, get a grip.
When did the gay community get so shrill? I
think these propaganda queens are the ones
who are really hurting us, these people that
put up this lie that we're exactly the same.
We're just straight people who tuck our own.
That is just not true."
About acting in 1 lollywood, ot which he's
had little luck, Thompson says, "It's a
strange idea that people are paid to be pro
fessional homosexuals. It's a purely Ameri
can phenomenon."
It's too bad we don't get to see one ot
Thompson's classic roles. One of his tavorite
characters is lounge li/ard and wise older
man, Buddy dole. Decked out in typically
flashv lounging robes, Buddy is the voice of
gay cveryman.
"Buddy Cole is a great outlet tor me.
When I first discovered Buddy Cole, he be
came my voice. I le took a lot ot things that 1
felt and what 1 thought and he made it all
funny." Thompson says that Buddy's gay ac
cent lulls viewers into a safety niche, until
the smarter audience realizes Buddy's mes
sages of gay pride. I ask Thompson what he
would contribute to Planet Hollywood. He
says either a stool leg from Buddy Cole's set
or Francesca Fiore's "Spy Model".

Things haven't always been smooth for
Thompson and the gay community. In fact,
things have been more or less rocky. When
he was asked to participate in the March on
Washington, he got booked at a place that
got very little business due to all the parties
that were happening that week. And then
when every other gay and lesbian performer
went on at the Mall, he was not asked to go
on.
"That's when I decided I did not want to
be labeled that way — I have no choice —
but you know what 1 mean? It's the last time
I allow myself to get hitched in a political
way," Thompson says, "I'm a comic."
He's confused on many of the issues
around gay relationships, but he is sure
about wanting gay men to "bond tighter."
"Gay men don't respect bonds, it's every
man for himself," Thompson says."II AIDS
can't make gay men bond, what will?"
No one can be happy all the time, right?
The Kids however, consistently make
us feel that way with their hi jinks and
light comic touches on about every aspect of
society. Happiness comes naturally for the
Kids, whose cra/iness is infectious. But
Thompson admits, even they have been
strained by the pressures of ensemble come
dy.
"Maintaining friendship and the quality
of our comedy are two things we've strug
gled with. We came close to breaking up
many, many times. We always seem to thrive
in that kind of chaos, but there's always a fine
line."
Their subject matter comes from their
surroundings. "Suburbia is so damn dull —
I think so much of suburbia is an attempt to
put a lid on passion," Thompson says."And
I think a lot of what our work is about is
punching holes into it and letting it out."

When I first discovered Buddy Cole, he be
came my voice. I le took a lot ot things that 1
felt and what 1 thought and he made it all
funny." Thompson says that Buddy's gay ac
cent lulls viewers into a safety niche, until
the smarter audience realizes Buddy's mes
sages of gay pride. I ask Thompson what he
would contribute to Planet Hollywood. He
says either a stool leg from Buddy Cole's set
or Francesca Fiore's "Spy Model".

Things haven't always been smooth for
Thompson and the gay community. In fact,
things have been more or less rocky. When
he was asked to participate in the March on
Washington, he got booked at a place that
got very little business due to all the parties
that were happening that week. And then
when every other gay and lesbian performer
went on at the Mall, he was not asked to go
on.
"That's when I decided I did not want to
be labeled that way — I have no choice —
but you know what 1 mean? It's the last time
I allow myself to get hitched in a political
way," Thompson says, "I'm a comic."
He's confused on many of the issues
around gay relationships, but he is sure
about wanting gay men to "bond tighter."
"Gay men don't respect bonds, it's every
man for himself," Thompson says."II AIDS
can't make gay men bond, what will?"
No one can be happy all the time, right?
The Kids however, consistently make
us feel that way with their hi jinks and
light comic touches on about every aspect of
society. Happiness comes naturally for the
Kids, whose cra/iness is infectious. But
Thompson admits, even they have been
strained by the pressures of ensemble come
dy.
"Maintaining friendship and the quality
of our comedy are two things we've strug
gled with. We came close to breaking up
many, many times. We always seem to thrive
in that kind of chaos, but there's always a fine
line."
Their subject matter comes from their
surroundings. "Suburbia is so damn dull —
I think so much of suburbia is an attempt to
put a lid on passion," Thompson says."And
I think a lot of what our work is about is
punching holes into it and letting it out."

The country's run amuck on a new drug,
and that new drug is happiness. Fol
lowing the trail to this dastardly deed
leads to Planet Hollywood in downtown San
Francisco, where "Kids in the 11all" star Scott
Thompson shares his insight on the new film
"Kids in the I fall Brain (Handy" which will he
in Bay Area theaters tomorrow, April 12.
Thompson is asked to explain the tremen
dous cult following behind the Kids: "Uhh,
because." I le pauses.
I le smiles and looks us in the eye, ready to
deliver a whammy. "We've replaced religion in
a godless society." A chorus of laughter natu
rally ensues, warming up his very receptive
press audience. When the Queen speaks, peo
ple listen.
OK, so you might have to be there. ()r all ot
you might not have to be there to get their
humor. It may be .1 sick sense of humor a lot of
the time, but it's hysterical to me and to many
people who follow the Kids. They're emulated
by many groups, such as MTV's the State, but
no one can capture what they have. If you're
the type ot person who finds suburban satire
and men cross-dressing to be funny, the Kids
are lor you. II von find gay lounge li/ards and
drag queens to be entertaining, Thompson is
for you. One of the most visible of the Kids
(comments like, "Oh, he's the gay one," or
"Oh, he's the smart blond," are common
when referring to him), he's the reason I
hauled ass to get here.
Walking into Planet I lollywood is always a
surreal experience. Paraphernalia from every
movie and TV show, massive and mediocre,
adorn the walls. I ike a Vegas casino, the rugs
are hideously patterned; in this case, a leop
aril skin design that begs the eye to move up
wards. Then the eye gets rammed by the pas
tel green and pink plastic tablecloth. Well, it />
Planet I lollywood. The kitsch is a fitting envi
ronment for our guest of honor.
The other college journalists and members
of the gay press .ire here buzzing with antici

pation, eagerly awaiting the entry of the
Queen himself.
I et me explain a little something lor those
of you who might not know what a gigantic
trip it is to be in the same room with Scott
Thompson. He's the man. And sometimes,
he's the woman. He is what makes watching
the Kids so much fun for me. He's the flamer
of the group, the spa rk of comic flair that con
sistently has me rolling 011 the floor of my
modest apartment.
While the other journalists are casting their
drink orders with the tropical shirt-wearing
waiter, I look about for signs that he's in the
building. Nothing seems to be happening. A
few minutes before he's due to address, I no
tice the lights turned on in the corner booth ol
the room.
Oh my (iod, it's him. Funny, he looks real
ly low key, not at all the flamboyant queen he
a*.ts like 011 the show, (latching glimpses ot
him from behind the various lights and cam
eras and not wanting to embarrass myself by
jumping up and scurrying to the set, I see he's
shaved oil most of his gorgeous blond locks,
leaving a kiddie crew-cut in the process. His
signature smile with his hawk-like nose is al
ways perked lor a Kodak moment. The cam
era loves him and he loves the camera.
Wearing a green crewneck sweater and
d.irk brown suede jeans, he comes over to talk
to us. He's not very tall, maybe 5-6 or 5-7.
They've set up a seat for him below the moni
tor set up in the room (they've got monitors
all over the place). The Planet I lollywood and
Paramount people want to show us a trailer of
the film, even though all of us had just
screened it the night before at the Variety club.
The monitor is stuck on a still of Forrest
(lump. Thompson, ever the improv comic, is
quick with commentary. "It's a lot like Forrest
(iump," he says, "Like it so far?" As if on cue,
the trailer begins with the dialogue already tar
behind. Again, 'Thompson is 011. " This is so
surreal. I like movies with dialogue. This looks

l.uropean." I think it's like those Asian kung
fu movies where the dubbing never quite
seems to match up, paving the way for ama
teur comics everywhere for a cheap act.
After some stopping and starting, the trail
er finally rolls. Funny thing is, about half the
scenes in the trailer have been cut by the time
the movie was finished. It's too bad. Some
choice scenes seem to have been cut. But what
remains is a surprisingly polished narrative
that tries to recapture the spirit of the long
running TV show. Generally, Thompson
seems pleased with it.
Thompson, acting modest, comes back to
his assigned seat below the monitor as the
journalists start firing away with their ques
tions. He's relaxed and very comfortable an
swering the questions. You'd think he'd done
this all his life. He definitely knows how to
work a room.
Like the rest of the Kids, he is a master of
disguise. Thompson plays a variety ot
roles in the film, which revolves around a
pretty simple narrative: a failing drug compa
ny, Roritor Pharmaceuticals, is looking for a
new drug to boost its sales. ()ne of their lab out
fits has been working on an anti-depressant in
pill form, and one of their subjects, Thomp
son's grandmotherly Mrs. Hurdicure, Patient
# 1 >57, shows the first positive signs of recovery.
The drug locks onto the happiest moment of
the taker's life and makes the taker re-experi
ence that moment for awhile. The remainder of
the film is filled with more Kids characters, old
and new, fighting corporate America, chronic
happiness and bad music videos.
The other Kids, Mark McKinney, Dave
Foley ("Newsradio"), Bruce McClulloch and
Kevin McDonald, play a variety of roles as
well. Flach ol them takes off on different tan
gents. McKinney's Dan Roritor is the chief ex
ecutive whose sock colors dictate what mood
he's in and what color carpet gets rolled out
for him. Folev's random guvs dot the land

scape while his smooth right hand man for
Roritor is a model for Smithers, Mr. Burn's
faithful assistant on "The Simpsons." McCul
lough's Alice is a role Thompson envies, wish
ing his Cathy could've accompanied such a
woman. Alice is forever pining away for Mac-
Donald's Dr. Cooper, the inventor of the drug.
Mac Donald falls from the grace of scientific
credibility, succumbing to fame and fortune
and forgetting the deadly consequences of his
experiments.
Thompson is very generous to his costars,
who have been such a tight ensemble the past
few years. Of Kevin Mac Donald, who play:,
the egomaniac Dr. Cooper who invents the
drug, he says, "He's purely hilarious. Kven his
sweat smells funny."
Thompson's Wally is a middle class dad
whose homosexuality is apparent to every
one, including his kids and wife, but him.
Wally masturbates in front ofgay porn videos,
gyrating to a soundtrack of techno beats.
Wally's caught with his pants down at dark or
gies where throngs of gay men tile out when
someone busts in. Wally's denial process is IT
nally released through the drug as it acceler
ates his coming out process. Soon he is pranc
ing about town in sailor outfits with his new
hunky lover.
Thompson's just as comfortable getting in
touch with his feminine side, basing many of
his female characters on the women in his life.
One of the staples of the Kids, Fran, is a
frumpy housewife who Thompson says is his
mother. Thompson's Baxter, a scientist in the
movie, is modeled on Fran Liebowitz. How
ever, Thompson doesn't want to get on her
bad side, so even if the look is all Fran, the
butchy behavior isn't. Yeah, right.
The Kids, infamous for their irreverent at
tacks on authority and suburbia, find no ex
ceptions in this film. Corporate America,
white trash, club kids, talk show hosts and
dysfunctional families are equally picked
apart and spat out with glee by the Kids.

Thompson explains how standards in
Canada differ from those of the U.S.
In Canada, where the Kids debuted
on (>BC (the Canadian Broadcasting (Corpo
ration) in 1989, their antics ranged from
practically spanking each others fannies to
dressing in leather S&M outfits. Tamer U.S.
standards kept most of the episodes, but
censored more controversial ones when the
Kids premiered on HBO in 1989.
"It's a lot freer in Canada," Thompson
says, then adds for comic affect, "I'm not
saying we're like the Dutch, we're not hang
ing out and smoking pot in cafes, but our
standards are very different. In television we
got away with a lot more. And we were on
regular TV at nine o'clock."
I le and I talk about how popular the show
is on the Internet, how all the offspring of the
Kids have used the Net to record such things
as every censored line on the show.
"American standards are so different. But
things are changing," he says, "You can say
ass' now." One of the Planet Hollywood
people comment, "But we don't get to see
cute asses like yours. We have to settle tor
Dennis Franz on NYPD Blue.''
Thompson quips, "You can't fantasize
about Dennis Franz's butt?"
lie is amazed at the zealousness of some
of his fans, and not a little impressed. He has
jumped on the Internet wave with the estab
lishment of his own web site, dubbed Scott
land. Found at http://www.scottland.com, it
is the brainchild of Thompson's character,
the Queen, and several other characters who
inhabit cyberspace as ministers of Thomp
son's make-believe government. He enters
the chat rooms often, as his characters. Be
coming a citizen allows access to these cen
ters of cyberconversation and privileged vot
ing rights, electing one of Thompson's many
characters to office.
Thompson is refreshingly candid and
honest about his aspirations toward star

dom. A longtime fan of celebrities, Thomp
son is out to decorate his own star, whether
it be with take furs or wigs or spandex hot
pants. He just wants this movie to break
even. And in his native Canada, this whole
self-promotion deal is very unseemly.
"Canadians don't mob," he says, "They're
not allowed to. They consider it embarrass
ing. I have to be a star here and then they'll
like me."
Since the film is about happiness, 1 ask
Thompson what his happiest moment was.
He says he's been asked this many times, but
he still seems uncertain as to which happy
moment he'd like to be locked into for eter
nity. Unlike his character, Wally, who gets
locked into a fuck-fest as a military man,
Thompson's happiest moment is something
much simpler and much more innocent.
"1 think our happiest moments are very,
very, very tiny things. I remember when I
was very small, we had this really big bay
window, we lived by the lake, and it over
looked the lake and the light would come in
to this one spot. I just remember as a child 1
would always go there when the light was
coming in and lie there. I would take all my
clothes off. I And I would be almost six or
seven. That was bliss, you know."
Thompson's candor infiltrates every
interaction, his silliness and sharp wit
punctuating his every answer. And yet
the serious side of him comes out as well de
fending his position as a gay performer.
Thompson is seriously outspoken when it
comes to this.
Thompson came out when he was 24, but
he knew early on he was attracted to boys
and then men.
As a teenager, he was obsessed with James
Dean, Montgomery Clitt and Francis
Farmer. Th<*n I realized they all died tragi
cally, and it was time

to choose new heroes.
The only gay mem
ber of the Kids, from
the beginning he's
taken roles that shoot
from the hip of gay
life.
He jabs at a re
porter from a national
quarterly gay and les
bian magazine. "You
mean you only have to
be a quarter gay? I'm
more than half, and 97
percent water."
When someone
asks him if he was
"kind of disappoint
ed" as to the lack of ex
posure gay actors get,
he answers, "A little?
and gestures his hands
for the more sign. The
journalist answers,
"Immen s c I y ? "
Thompson shakes his
head and says, "More
like ballistic."
"I think the so
called gay leaders arc
very insecure. I think
the gay community is
really fragile and can t
take a joke and is too
immature to be sati
rized.
"I think that the last

few years all people wanted was propaganda.
They wanted everything to be empowering
and positive. And I think 1 was considered
somebody who was telling bad secrets. 1 was
just doing my job, you know."
He tells those gay activists who attack his
so-called stereotypical portrayals, "Just get a
sense of humor. I don't understand why peo
ple refuse to admit that some ot these stereo
types are based in reality. I find it so surreal
to have a gay man who sounds incredibly gay
telling me that buddy Cole, there aren't peo
ple like that!"
"There's nothing wrong with being ef
feminate. I just think, you know, get a grip.
When did the gay community get so shrill? I
think these propaganda queens are the ones
who are really hurting us, these people that
put up this lie that we're exactly the same.
We're just straight people who tuck our own.
That is just not true."
About acting in 1 lollywood, ot which he's
had little luck, Thompson says, "It's a
strange idea that people are paid to be pro
fessional homosexuals. It's a purely Ameri
can phenomenon."
It's too bad we don't get to see one ot
Thompson's classic roles. One of his tavorite
characters is lounge li/ard and wise older
man, Buddy dole. Decked out in typically
flashv lounging robes, Buddy is the voice of
gay cveryman.
"Buddy Cole is a great outlet tor me.
When I first discovered Buddy Cole, he be
came my voice. I le took a lot ot things that 1
felt and what 1 thought and he made it all
funny." Thompson says that Buddy's gay ac
cent lulls viewers into a safety niche, until
the smarter audience realizes Buddy's mes
sages of gay pride. I ask Thompson what he
would contribute to Planet Hollywood. He
says either a stool leg from Buddy Cole's set
or Francesca Fiore's "Spy Model".

Things haven't always been smooth for
Thompson and the gay community. In fact,
things have been more or less rocky. When
he was asked to participate in the March on
Washington, he got booked at a place that
got very little business due to all the parties
that were happening that week. And then
when every other gay and lesbian performer
went on at the Mall, he was not asked to go
on.
"That's when I decided I did not want to
be labeled that way — I have no choice —
but you know what 1 mean? It's the last time
I allow myself to get hitched in a political
way," Thompson says, "I'm a comic."
He's confused on many of the issues
around gay relationships, but he is sure
about wanting gay men to "bond tighter."
"Gay men don't respect bonds, it's every

life.
He jabs at a re
porter from a national
quarterly gay and les
bian magazine. "You
mean you only have to
be a quarter gay? I'm
more than half, and 97
percent water."
When someone
asks him if he was
"kind of disappoint
ed" as to the lack of ex
posure gay actors get,
he answers, "A little?
and gestures his hands
for the more sign. The
journalist answers,
"Immen s c I y ? "
Thompson shakes his
head and says, "More
like ballistic."
"I think the so
called gay leaders arc
very insecure. I think
the gay community is
really fragile and can t
take a joke and is too
immature to be sati
rized.
"I think that the last

few years all people wanted was propaganda.
They wanted everything to be empowering
and positive. And I think 1 was considered
somebody who was telling bad secrets. 1 was
just doing my job, you know."
He tells those gay activists who attack his
so-called stereotypical portrayals, "Just get a
sense of humor. I don't understand why peo
ple refuse to admit that some ot these stereo
types are based in reality. I find it so surreal
to have a gay man who sounds incredibly gay
telling me that buddy Cole, there aren't peo
ple like that!"
"There's nothing wrong with being ef
feminate. I just think, you know, get a grip.
When did the gay community get so shrill? I
think these propaganda queens are the ones
who are really hurting us, these people that
put up this lie that we're exactly the same.
We're just straight people who tuck our own.
That is just not true."
About acting in 1 lollywood, ot which he's
had little luck, Thompson says, "It's a
strange idea that people are paid to be pro
fessional homosexuals. It's a purely Ameri
can phenomenon."
It's too bad we don't get to see one ot
Thompson's classic roles. One of his tavorite
characters is lounge li/ard and wise older
man, Buddy dole. Decked out in typically
flashv lounging robes, Buddy is the voice of
gay cveryman.
"Buddy Cole is a great outlet tor me.
When I first discovered Buddy Cole, he be
came my voice. I le took a lot ot things that 1
felt and what 1 thought and he made it all
funny." Thompson says that Buddy's gay ac
cent lulls viewers into a safety niche, until
the smarter audience realizes Buddy's mes
sages of gay pride. I ask Thompson what he
would contribute to Planet Hollywood. He
says either a stool leg from Buddy Cole's set
or Francesca Fiore's "Spy Model".

Things haven't always been smooth for
Thompson and the gay community. In fact,
things have been more or less rocky. When
he was asked to participate in the March on
Washington, he got booked at a place that
got very little business due to all the parties
that were happening that week. And then
when every other gay and lesbian performer
went on at the Mall, he was not asked to go
on.
"That's when I decided I did not want to
be labeled that way — I have no choice —
but you know what 1 mean? It's the last time
I allow myself to get hitched in a political
way," Thompson says, "I'm a comic."
He's confused on many of the issues
around gay relationships, but he is sure
about wanting gay men to "bond tighter."
"Gay men don't respect bonds, it's every
man for himself," Thompson says."II AIDS
can't make gay men bond, what will?"
No one can be happy all the time, right?
The Kids however, consistently make
us feel that way with their hi jinks and
light comic touches on about every aspect of
society. Happiness comes naturally for the
Kids, whose cra/iness is infectious. But
Thompson admits, even they have been
strained by the pressures of ensemble come
dy.
"Maintaining friendship and the quality
of our comedy are two things we've strug
gled with. We came close to breaking up
many, many times. We always seem to thrive
in that kind of chaos, but there's always a fine
line."
Their subject matter comes from their
surroundings. "Suburbia is so damn dull —
I think so much of suburbia is an attempt to
put a lid on passion," Thompson says."And
I think a lot of what our work is about is
punching holes into it and letting it out."

The country's run amuck on a new drug,
and that new drug is happiness. Fol
lowing the trail to this dastardly deed
leads to Planet Hollywood in downtown San
Francisco, where "Kids in the 11all" star Scott
Thompson shares his insight on the new film
"Kids in the I fall Brain (Handy" which will he
in Bay Area theaters tomorrow, April 12.
Thompson is asked to explain the tremen
dous cult following behind the Kids: "Uhh,
because." I le pauses.
I le smiles and looks us in the eye, ready to
deliver a whammy. "We've replaced religion in
a godless society." A chorus of laughter natu
rally ensues, warming up his very receptive
press audience. When the Queen speaks, peo
ple listen.
OK, so you might have to be there. ()r all ot
you might not have to be there to get their
humor. It may be .1 sick sense of humor a lot of
the time, but it's hysterical to me and to many
people who follow the Kids. They're emulated
by many groups, such as MTV's the State, but
no one can capture what they have. If you're
the type ot person who finds suburban satire
and men cross-dressing to be funny, the Kids
are lor you. II von find gay lounge li/ards and
drag queens to be entertaining, Thompson is
for you. One of the most visible of the Kids
(comments like, "Oh, he's the gay one," or
"Oh, he's the smart blond," are common
when referring to him), he's the reason I
hauled ass to get here.
Walking into Planet I lollywood is always a
surreal experience. Paraphernalia from every
movie and TV show, massive and mediocre,
adorn the walls. I ike a Vegas casino, the rugs
are hideously patterned; in this case, a leop
aril skin design that begs the eye to move up
wards. Then the eye gets rammed by the pas
tel green and pink plastic tablecloth. Well, it />
Planet I lollywood. The kitsch is a fitting envi
ronment for our guest of honor.
The other college journalists and members
of the gay press .ire here buzzing with antici

pation, eagerly awaiting the entry of the
Queen himself.
I et me explain a little something lor those
of you who might not know what a gigantic
trip it is to be in the same room with Scott
Thompson. He's the man. And sometimes,
he's the woman. He is what makes watching
the Kids so much fun for me. He's the flamer
of the group, the spa rk of comic flair that con
sistently has me rolling 011 the floor of my
modest apartment.
While the other journalists are casting their
drink orders with the tropical shirt-wearing
waiter, I look about for signs that he's in the
building. Nothing seems to be happening. A
few minutes before he's due to address, I no
tice the lights turned on in the corner booth ol
the room.
Oh my (iod, it's him. Funny, he looks real
ly low key, not at all the flamboyant queen he
a*.ts like 011 the show, (latching glimpses ot
him from behind the various lights and cam
eras and not wanting to embarrass myself by
jumping up and scurrying to the set, I see he's
shaved oil most of his gorgeous blond locks,
leaving a kiddie crew-cut in the process. His
signature smile with his hawk-like nose is al
ways perked lor a Kodak moment. The cam
era loves him and he loves the camera.
Wearing a green crewneck sweater and
d.irk brown suede jeans, he comes over to talk
to us. He's not very tall, maybe 5-6 or 5-7.
They've set up a seat for him below the moni
tor set up in the room (they've got monitors
all over the place). The Planet I lollywood and
Paramount people want to show us a trailer of
the film, even though all of us had just
screened it the night before at the Variety club.
The monitor is stuck on a still of Forrest
(lump. Thompson, ever the improv comic, is
quick with commentary. "It's a lot like Forrest
(iump," he says, "Like it so far?" As if on cue,
the trailer begins with the dialogue already tar
behind. Again, 'Thompson is 011. " This is so
surreal. I like movies with dialogue. This looks

l.uropean." I think it's like those Asian kung
fu movies where the dubbing never quite
seems to match up, paving the way for ama
teur comics everywhere for a cheap act.
After some stopping and starting, the trail
er finally rolls. Funny thing is, about half the
scenes in the trailer have been cut by the time
the movie was finished. It's too bad. Some
choice scenes seem to have been cut. But what
remains is a surprisingly polished narrative
that tries to recapture the spirit of the long
running TV show. Generally, Thompson
seems pleased with it.
Thompson, acting modest, comes back to
his assigned seat below the monitor as the
journalists start firing away with their ques
tions. He's relaxed and very comfortable an
swering the questions. You'd think he'd done
this all his life. He definitely knows how to
work a room.
Like the rest of the Kids, he is a master of
disguise. Thompson plays a variety ot
roles in the film, which revolves around a
pretty simple narrative: a failing drug compa
ny, Roritor Pharmaceuticals, is looking for a
new drug to boost its sales. ()ne of their lab out
fits has been working on an anti-depressant in
pill form, and one of their subjects, Thomp
son's grandmotherly Mrs. Hurdicure, Patient
# 1 >57, shows the first positive signs of recovery.
The drug locks onto the happiest moment of
the taker's life and makes the taker re-experi
ence that moment for awhile. The remainder of
the film is filled with more Kids characters, old
and new, fighting corporate America, chronic
happiness and bad music videos.
The other Kids, Mark McKinney, Dave
Foley ("Newsradio"), Bruce McClulloch and
Kevin McDonald, play a variety of roles as
well. Flach ol them takes off on different tan
gents. McKinney's Dan Roritor is the chief ex
ecutive whose sock colors dictate what mood
he's in and what color carpet gets rolled out
for him. Folev's random guvs dot the land

scape while his smooth right hand man for
Roritor is a model for Smithers, Mr. Burn's
faithful assistant on "The Simpsons." McCul
lough's Alice is a role Thompson envies, wish
ing his Cathy could've accompanied such a
woman. Alice is forever pining away for Mac-
Donald's Dr. Cooper, the inventor of the drug.
Mac Donald falls from the grace of scientific
credibility, succumbing to fame and fortune
and forgetting the deadly consequences of his
experiments.
Thompson is very generous to his costars,
who have been such a tight ensemble the past
few years. Of Kevin Mac Donald, who play:,
the egomaniac Dr. Cooper who invents the
drug, he says, "He's purely hilarious. Kven his
sweat smells funny."
Thompson's Wally is a middle class dad
whose homosexuality is apparent to every
one, including his kids and wife, but him.
Wally masturbates in front ofgay porn videos,
gyrating to a soundtrack of techno beats.
Wally's caught with his pants down at dark or
gies where throngs of gay men tile out when
someone busts in. Wally's denial process is IT
nally released through the drug as it acceler
ates his coming out process. Soon he is pranc
ing about town in sailor outfits with his new
hunky lover.
Thompson's just as comfortable getting in
touch with his feminine side, basing many of
his female characters on the women in his life.
One of the staples of the Kids, Fran, is a
frumpy housewife who Thompson says is his
mother. Thompson's Baxter, a scientist in the
movie, is modeled on Fran Liebowitz. How
ever, Thompson doesn't want to get on her
bad side, so even if the look is all Fran, the
butchy behavior isn't. Yeah, right.
The Kids, infamous for their irreverent at
tacks on authority and suburbia, find no ex
ceptions in this film. Corporate America,
white trash, club kids, talk show hosts and
dysfunctional families are equally picked
apart and spat out with glee by the Kids.

Thompson explains how standards in
Canada differ from those of the U.S.
In Canada, where the Kids debuted
on (>BC (the Canadian Broadcasting (Corpo
ration) in 1989, their antics ranged from
practically spanking each others fannies to
dressing in leather S&M outfits. Tamer U.S.
standards kept most of the episodes, but
censored more controversial ones when the
Kids premiered on HBO in 1989.
"It's a lot freer in Canada," Thompson
says, then adds for comic affect, "I'm not
saying we're like the Dutch, we're not hang
ing out and smoking pot in cafes, but our
standards are very different. In television we
got away with a lot more. And we were on
regular TV at nine o'clock."
I le and I talk about how popular the show
is on the Internet, how all the offspring of the
Kids have used the Net to record such things
as every censored line on the show.
"American standards are so different. But
things are changing," he says, "You can say
ass' now." One of the Planet Hollywood
people comment, "But we don't get to see
cute asses like yours. We have to settle tor
Dennis Franz on NYPD Blue.''
Thompson quips, "You can't fantasize
about Dennis Franz's butt?"
lie is amazed at the zealousness of some
of his fans, and not a little impressed. He has
jumped on the Internet wave with the estab
lishment of his own web site, dubbed Scott
land. Found at http://www.scottland.com, it
is the brainchild of Thompson's character,
the Queen, and several other characters who
inhabit cyberspace as ministers of Thomp
son's make-believe government. He enters
the chat rooms often, as his characters. Be
coming a citizen allows access to these cen
ters of cyberconversation and privileged vot
ing rights, electing one of Thompson's many
characters to office.
Thompson is refreshingly candid and
honest about his aspirations toward star

dom. A longtime fan of celebrities, Thomp
son is out to decorate his own star, whether
it be with take furs or wigs or spandex hot
pants. He just wants this movie to break
even. And in his native Canada, this whole
self-promotion deal is very unseemly.
"Canadians don't mob," he says, "They're
not allowed to. They consider it embarrass
ing. I have to be a star here and then they'll
like me."
Since the film is about happiness, 1 ask
Thompson what his happiest moment was.
He says he's been asked this many times, but
he still seems uncertain as to which happy
moment he'd like to be locked into for eter
nity. Unlike his character, Wally, who gets
locked into a fuck-fest as a military man,
Thompson's happiest moment is something
much simpler and much more innocent.
"1 think our happiest moments are very,
very, very tiny things. I remember when I
was very small, we had this really big bay
window, we lived by the lake, and it over
looked the lake and the light would come in
to this one spot. I just remember as a child 1
would always go there when the light was
coming in and lie there. I would take all my
clothes off. I And I would be almost six or
seven. That was bliss, you know."
Thompson's candor infiltrates every
interaction, his silliness and sharp wit
punctuating his every answer. And yet
the serious side of him comes out as well de
fending his position as a gay performer.
Thompson is seriously outspoken when it
comes to this.
Thompson came out when he was 24, but
he knew early on he was attracted to boys
and then men.
As a teenager, he was obsessed with James
Dean, Montgomery Clitt and Francis
Farmer. Th<*n I realized they all died tragi
cally, and it was time

to choose new heroes.
The only gay mem
ber of the Kids, from
the beginning he's
taken roles that shoot
from the hip of gay
life.
He jabs at a re
porter from a national
quarterly gay and les
bian magazine. "You
mean you only have to
be a quarter gay? I'm
more than half, and 97
percent water."
When someone
asks him if he was
"kind of disappoint
ed" as to the lack of ex
posure gay actors get,
he answers, "A little?
and gestures his hands
for the more sign. The
journalist answers,
"Immen s c I y ? "
Thompson shakes his
head and says, "More
like ballistic."
"I think the so
called gay leaders arc
very insecure. I think
the gay community is
really fragile and can t
take a joke and is too
immature to be sati
rized.
"I think that the last

few years all people wanted was propaganda.
They wanted everything to be empowering
and positive. And I think 1 was considered
somebody who was telling bad secrets. 1 was
just doing my job, you know."
He tells those gay activists who attack his
so-called stereotypical portrayals, "Just get a

ple refuse to admit that some ot these stereo
types are based in reality. I find it so surreal
to have a gay man who sounds incredibly gay
telling me that buddy Cole, there aren't peo
ple like that!"
"There's nothing wrong with being ef
feminate. I just think, you know, get a grip.
When did the gay community get so shrill? I
think these propaganda queens are the ones
who are really hurting us, these people that
put up this lie that we're exactly the same.
We're just straight people who tuck our own.
That is just not true."

the chat rooms often, as his characters. Be
coming a citizen allows access to these cen
ters of cyberconversation and privileged vot
ing rights, electing one of Thompson's many
characters to office.
Thompson is refreshingly candid and
honest about his aspirations toward star

dom. A longtime fan of celebrities, Thomp
son is out to decorate his own star, whether
it be with take furs or wigs or spandex hot
pants. He just wants this movie to break
even. And in his native Canada, this whole
self-promotion deal is very unseemly.
"Canadians don't mob," he says, "They're
not allowed to. They consider it embarrass
ing. I have to be a star here and then they'll
like me."
Since the film is about happiness, 1 ask
Thompson what his happiest moment was.
He says he's been asked this many times, but
he still seems uncertain as to which happy
moment he'd like to be locked into for eter
nity. Unlike his character, Wally, who gets
locked into a fuck-fest as a military man,
Thompson's happiest moment is something
much simpler and much more innocent.
"1 think our happiest moments are very,
very, very tiny things. I remember when I
was very small, we had this really big bay
window, we lived by the lake, and it over
looked the lake and the light would come in
to this one spot. I just remember as a child 1
would always go there when the light was
coming in and lie there. I would take all my
clothes off. I And I would be almost six or
seven. That was bliss, you know."
Thompson's candor infiltrates every
interaction, his silliness and sharp wit
punctuating his every answer. And yet
the serious side of him comes out as well de
fending his position as a gay performer.
Thompson is seriously outspoken when it
comes to this.
Thompson came out when he was 24, but
he knew early on he was attracted to boys
and then men.
As a teenager, he was obsessed with James
Dean, Montgomery Clitt and Francis
Farmer. Th<*n I realized they all died tragi
cally, and it was time

to choose new heroes.
The only gay mem
ber of the Kids, from
the beginning he's
taken roles that shoot
from the hip of gay
life.
He jabs at a re
porter from a national
quarterly gay and les
bian magazine. "You
mean you only have to
be a quarter gay? I'm
more than half, and 97
percent water."
When someone
asks him if he was
"kind of disappoint
ed" as to the lack of ex
posure gay actors get,
he answers, "A little?
and gestures his hands
for the more sign. The
journalist answers,
"Immen s c I y ? "
Thompson shakes his
head and says, "More
like ballistic."
"I think the so
called gay leaders arc
very insecure. I think
the gay community is
really fragile and can t
take a joke and is too
immature to be sati
rized.
"I think that the last

few years all people wanted was propaganda.
They wanted everything to be empowering
and positive. And I think 1 was considered
somebody who was telling bad secrets. 1 was
just doing my job, you know."
He tells those gay activists who attack his
so-called stereotypical portrayals, "Just get a
sense of humor. I don't understand why peo
ple refuse to admit that some ot these stereo
types are based in reality. I find it so surreal
to have a gay man who sounds incredibly gay
telling me that buddy Cole, there aren't peo
ple like that!"
"There's nothing wrong with being ef
feminate. I just think, you know, get a grip.
When did the gay community get so shrill? I
think these propaganda queens are the ones
who are really hurting us, these people that
put up this lie that we're exactly the same.
We're just straight people who tuck our own.
That is just not true."
About acting in 1 lollywood, ot which he's
had little luck, Thompson says, "It's a
strange idea that people are paid to be pro
fessional homosexuals. It's a purely Ameri
can phenomenon."
It's too bad we don't get to see one ot
Thompson's classic roles. One of his tavorite
characters is lounge li/ard and wise older
man, Buddy dole. Decked out in typically
flashv lounging robes, Buddy is the voice of
gay cveryman.
"Buddy Cole is a great outlet tor me.
When I first discovered Buddy Cole, he be
came my voice. I le took a lot ot things that 1
felt and what 1 thought and he made it all
funny." Thompson says that Buddy's gay ac
cent lulls viewers into a safety niche, until
the smarter audience realizes Buddy's mes
sages of gay pride. I ask Thompson what he
would contribute to Planet Hollywood. He
says either a stool leg from Buddy Cole's set
or Francesca Fiore's "Spy Model".

Things haven't always been smooth for
Thompson and the gay community. In fact,
things have been more or less rocky. When
he was asked to participate in the March on
Washington, he got booked at a place that
got very little business due to all the parties
that were happening that week. And then
when every other gay and lesbian performer
went on at the Mall, he was not asked to go
on.
"That's when I decided I did not want to
be labeled that way — I have no choice —
but you know what 1 mean? It's the last time
I allow myself to get hitched in a political
way," Thompson says, "I'm a comic."
He's confused on many of the issues
around gay relationships, but he is sure
about wanting gay men to "bond tighter."
"Gay men don't respect bonds, it's every
man for himself," Thompson says."II AIDS
can't make gay men bond, what will?"
No one can be happy all the time, right?
The Kids however, consistently make
us feel that way with their hi jinks and
light comic touches on about every aspect of
society. Happiness comes naturally for the
Kids, whose cra/iness is infectious. But
Thompson admits, even they have been
strained by the pressures of ensemble come
dy.
"Maintaining friendship and the quality
of our comedy are two things we've strug
gled with. We came close to breaking up
many, many times. We always seem to thrive
in that kind of chaos, but there's always a fine
line."
Their subject matter comes from their
surroundings. "Suburbia is so damn dull —
I think so much of suburbia is an attempt to
put a lid on passion," Thompson says."And
I think a lot of what our work is about is
punching holes into it and letting it out."
