## STEREOLAB Emperor Tomato Ketchup 
### 
Sometimes conflicts are hest left unre
solved: Indeed, Stereolab s eclectic, electric
mix is never one thing or the other, but so
much more. Nostalgic and futuristic,
thoughtful and sensual, the (Iroop makes the
most <>l such rich contradictions on "I inper
or Tomato Ketchup. Unresolved yet fully re
alized, the album is pop art th.it revels in that
status even while transcending it.
Dazzlingly complex and pop song acces
sible at once, "Fmperor Tomato Ketchup'
expands further on Stereolab's revolutionary
ideas because the sextet matches refinement
to excitement. Brimming with new ideas and
sounds, band leader Tim Ciane does a mas
terful job of following Ins imagination yet
shaping the sounds into coherent tunes.
More than ever, the 21st-century hits are
streamlined, so (lane's space age instrumen
talism and the subversive text of Marxist
crooner I aetitia Sadier's vocals emerge with
greater confidence and energy.
Anything but limiting its sound, Stereolab
hones and polishes its aesthetic to open up
the possibilities. While "Percolator'' is a
space-station redux of a Mission Impossible
spy thriller, "Spark Plug' gets its revolution
ary message across with a starry, buoyant
groove. The incendiary single " I he Noise of
Carpet' blows things up gracefully, where
Sadier's sneers against "fashionable cyni
cism, the poison they want you to drink'' are
complemented and offset by the soaring key
boards and ba-da-ba backing vocals. It's a
rousing yet comforting call to act, striking a
perfect note of recognition because it neither
preaches nor postures.
Both easy listening and urgent art, Stereo
lab works on many levels of expression.
"Slow Fast Hazel" expounds on the compo
nents of its title lucidly, a dusky ballad that
moves between drifting parts and hyped-up
ones. All the while, Sadier sings flowingly a
brief theory of history, linking the "discovery
of time" to "the Soviets and other events in
history of humanity at a certain given mo
ment in time." The lushly orchestrated "Cy
bele's Reverie" best exemplifies the band's ca
pacity to express itself in a variety of ways.
Soothing and sweeping at the surface, the
pretty instrumentation simmers and boils

underneath. Sadier's trotting vocals give the
same impression, even if the French content
is incomprehensible. But what words cannot
express, sound and form can. You get more
than you hear with Stereolab, and that's al
ready a world of sounds.
