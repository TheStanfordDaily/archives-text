# GIN BLOSSOMS
## Congratulations I'm Sorry 
### 
Though haunted by debilitating taunts of
inferiority and pallid music making, the (lin
Blossoms continue to overachieve. Their
sophomore newborn, "Congratulations I'm
Sorry," does what few had predicted this star
si ruck circle of bards could ever achieve: it re
news their presence on the charts. Also, their
current top-10 status on the national singles
pile-up can be attributed to more than just
bubble-popping mall rat s — the group's fan
base spans a healthy mix of experienced lis
teners as well,
Although muscling lor individuality from
the shadowing multi platinum successol the
group s first release, "New Miserable Hxperi
ence," "Congratulations I'm Sorry" treads
lightly on new terrain. Favoring familiar soils
to high risk foreign territory, the (lin Blos
soms rely more on past formulas than fron
tiersman aesthetics.
Bolstered by the stereophonic and saturat
ing vocal resonance of lead singer Robin Wil
son, the group has quite a knack tor generat
ing emotionally charged sing -alongs. "Fol
low You Down," the album's proud favorite,
does exactly that — and convincingly suc
ceeds yesterday's cadre of blockbuster sin
gles, including "Hey Jealousy" and "Found
Out About You." With driving energy remi
niscent of RFM and the Cars, the Gin Blos
soms create quite a caravan of musical elec
tricity.
Yet, in this seemingly safe realm of sopho
more independence, the Gin Blossoms are
still fighting accusations of wanton mass
production and syrupy sap. Safe, middle-of
the-road, bland, so the story goes. Perhaps a
second listening reveals more soulful layers:
"Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down / I'll
follow you down, but not that far", chants the
chorus of "Follow You Down."
A similar breadth arises in "Virginia," a
song that wrestles with the frustrations of re
lationships: "Slow down Virginia, but don't

make me wait". Such sobering lyrics may
seem at odds with the Blossom's high-spirit
ed, hard-driving rock excitement — yet they
provide such beautiful complexity and para
dox. This, in the end, may be the worst aspect
to misjudge.
