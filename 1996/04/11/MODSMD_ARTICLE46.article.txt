# SLEATER-KINNEY
## Call the Doctor 
### 
Sleater-Kinney's music is scary. It is the
sound of conventions being shattered. It is
the sound of revolution, and it sounds mag
nificent.
Like last year's self-titled EF, Sleater-Kin
ney's new LP, "Call the Doctor," is an attempt
to tear down the established gender hierar
chies in modern American society, especially
in rock and roll. The tools in this demolition
are two guitars, two voices and a drum set
(with hubcap). Rather than the din of crum
bling cement and tearing metal, though, it
consists of frighteningly graceful intertwin
ing guitar-lines and emotion-choked vocals,
all spinning and weaving but always steadily
moving forward to an insistent beat.
The two singers / guitarists, Carrie
Brownstein and Corin Tucker, bring their
distinct talents to the album, and this collab
oration makes a brilliant whole. It you listen
carefully you can pick out elements ot their
previous bands — Excuse 17 and 1 leavens to
Betsy, respectively — and realize that there is
even more here than the sum of those parts.
Most of my favorite songs on the album
are ones where both singers share vocal du
ties. In fact, Brownstein's voice is so com
pelling and adds so much to the songs she
sings, it's a shame she doesn't get more op

portunities to use it here. But Tucker man
ages the majority of the singing with Hair,
and her voice does a good job of conveying
the songs' unchecked emotion, emotion that
ranges from anger to pain to indignance. In
any case it is all real and, as a consequence, it
isn't always pretty. In fact, this degree of sin
cerity can be shocking.
Sleater-Kinney do not make perfect
music in the established, critical sense he
cause they are not as interested in master
ing the formal elements of their music as
they are in using it as a tool to communicate
this emotion to their audience. Still, "Call
the Doctor" is more polished, more musi
cally accomplished in the traditional sense
than either the last album or work the band
members have produced in other outfits. As
Tucker puts it, "We write complex music
