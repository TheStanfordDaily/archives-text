## WEIRD AL YANKOVIC Bad Hair Day 
### 
If you're looking for the king of cheese,
then you're looking for that pink-tailed, fun
loving fuzzball, Chuck E. Cheese. If you're
looking for the king of cheese in the music in
dustry, then you're looking for that eyeglass
es-wearing, mustache-sporting mastermind
of parodies, "Weird Al" Yankovic and his
newest album, "Bad Hair Day."
I ike his previous albums, Yankovic paro
dies current hit singles and showcases some
of his original works, all of which are pre
sented in a tongue-in-cheek manner. This
album focuses on Coolio's "Gangsta Par
adise." In his rendition, titled "Amish Par
adise," the instrumentation from the original
is kept but the lyrics are replaced with ones
focused around an Amish theme.
Hven though the Amish theme is unique, his
lyrics hardly sell the album. "Gangsta Paradise"
was already an annoying song and, thus, any
parody of it, good or bad, would have been a hit
with the irritated masses. And Yankovic's
Amish accent — if there really is a standard
Amish accent — is hardly convincing, as it
comes off as a broken Indian accent.
Cheap thrills may be all his album can
offer, considering that the lyrical creativity
lies at the third-grade level. Free from sexual
innuendoes and explicit words, his lyrics read
like a script for an upcoming Tom and Jerry
cartoon.
But then again, such careful humor maybe
a positive direction for the music industry. In
his original work "Everything You Know is
Wrong," Yankovic warns "Everything you
know is wrong / Black is white / up is
down / and short is long." Such childish
humor has a way of showing that the world is
not perfect without making overtures to sui
cide, spousal abuse or drugs.
Aside from his lyrics, Yankovic makes a few
stabs at some instrumental interpretation. In
"The Alternative Polka," he creates a polka
stvle medley consisting of 11 of the most pop
ular alternative songs including Smashing
Pumpkins' "Bullet with Butterfly Wings," Nine
Inch Nails' "Closer," and Alanis Morissette's
You Oughta Know." Even though Yankovic's
polka-style rendition of these songs is interest
ing, the novelty wears off quickly. In the end,
the medley simply shows Yankovic's blatant
waste of 11 songs which could have had some
interesting lyrical twists.
II you get thrills off of shallow humor, buy
this album. But if you're a true music buff,
don't touch this CD unless it's sitting in the.25
( I) bin. Remember those "Where's the beef?'
commercials? Well, there's no meat here.
Nothing here but a bunch of cheese.
