# WEAPON OF CHOICE
## HighperSpice 
### 
Straight-up funk. The groove that makes
your bootay move. That's what Weapon of
Choice are all about. "HighperSpice,"
which was largely produced by Pearl Jam's
Stone Cossard, contains the elements of a
good funk / disco-influenced album. Or as
the band prefers to say, "Nut'meg [the
singer goes under the name Mega*nut]
Music puts the balls in your court."
Weapon of Choice do a good job of
blending many musical styles into one, as a
good funk band should. Their songs con
tain good bass grooves, flowing drum beats,
hypnotic guitar riffs and horn licks that
highlight certain sections of the songs.
Some of the songs have the upbeat funk
style that George Clinton made so popular,
while others focus on slower grooves that
center around the vocals.
The vocals range from several people
harmonizing to the gangsta-rap style in
"Glo in da' Dark." Seemingly obsessed with
drug innuendoes, strange puns and the use
of the word "nut," the lyrics are often some
what bizarre. The title track illustrates their
lyrical style well: "The thrillsvery glow boy
is thrilled to breath to be rollin' in dough
with you, igloo in the snow with you, no
matter what we do, we're in the moment
with you."
Finn, the guitarist, shows a wide variety
of funk styles, ranging from the wah-wah
pedal, standard funk sound on "Let the Shit
Hit the Fan" to the distorted, more rock-in
fluenced "Spade. His solos blend in well
with the songs and are well executed.
The only thing that holds the album back
is the sometimes too absurd ideas that the
band creates. While the goal of a band like
this is to have a great time playing music,
sometimes it seems to go overboard, sacri
ficing musical integrity for silliness. At
times it works well, but at others, things like
the background vocals in"I Like Your

Body" get in the way of feeling the other
wise excellent groove.
Overall, Weapon of Choice have brought
forth an excellent funk album that may not
be as innovative as George Clinton but still
provides a great groove and showcases some
good musical talent. This album, along with
touring with the Red I lot Chili Peppers and
Primus, may bring Weapon of Choice out of
the clubs and into the mainstream.
