# VELOCITY GIRL
## Gilded Stars and Zealous Hearts 
### 
The names of Velocity Girl's three albums
describe the contents of each record better
than the sum of their reviews. The D.C. quin
tet's 1993 debut "Copacetic" is as cool and

haphazardly complete as the title suggests,
while the follow-up "jSimpatico!" is just that,
a nice, pleasant listen. And indeed, the pop
song smarts of "Gilded Stars and Zealous
Hearts" are summed up succinctly and ac
curately by its appellation: though the
hand's latest comes off somewhat over
wrought — gilded, if you will — it's diffi
cult not to give the zealous hearts credit for
their efforts.
As a result of overproduction, Velocity
Girl straddles the line between sounding
bored and boring. Where the band succeed
ed in venting suburban angst with the slop
py yet wrenching indie-pop stuff of the first
two albums, the five-some deals with its
simmering, post-grad frustration on "Gild
ed Stars and Zealous Hearts" by refining it
out of existence. The mix is sharper, but at
the expense of the balance between the
evocative guitar play of Archie Moore and
Brian Nelson and vocalist Sarah Shannon's
achingly pretty voice.
Without the bite of, say, Heavenly to
compensate for a clean production, the
album sounds blander than it actually is.
The group has it backwards, as the thin
beauty of Shannon's singing dominates the
overly understated instrumental work. The
textures of the songs are smoothed over,
and the rich ambiguity of the band's previ
ous efforts is transformed into a giddy mo
notone. The light tone seems noticeably
misplaced on the first single, "Nothing,"
where the upbeat mood of the music and
Shannon's one-note vocals fail to match the
regretful lyrics. "The Only Ones" is an un
bearably sappy piece, with its half-baked
meditations like, "I don't wanna be the only
one / Sittin' alone waitin' for the sun."
Still, when Velocity Girl hits the right
notes, the band's slacker sincerity shines en
dearingly. "Finest I lour" moves forward with
its buzzing guitars, as Shannon goes with the
How, floating somewhere between self-affir
mation and self-doubt. "Go Coastal" works
even better, an upbeat tune cheery in its love
sickness. It's the standout example that shows
the band can be as adept in writing happy
songs as it is in making mopey noise-pop. In
those cases. Velocity Girl comes out ahead
because it sticks to its zealous heart.
