# Spirit of '96
## New constitution would shrink size of COP; some say diversity might suffer 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
With less than a week
before the ASSU spring
general election, sup
porters and opponents of
"Constitution '96" are
making their case. At
issue iii the viability of

the ASSU as it exists today.
The ballot initiative would replace the
existing ASSU Constitution completely,
creating a single executive position and re
ducing the number of senators from 40 to
30, all of whom would have voting privi
leges. The legislation would also create a ju
dicial branch of the ASSU. Two-thirds of
voters must approve the bill in order for it
to take effect.
Senior Mike Slemmer, author of the new
constitution, said his plan would stream
line the ASSU and make it more account
able. Perhaps its most significant — and
controversial — provision is the creation of
a single presidency to replace the four
member Council of Presidents.
Opponents of the initiative, which in
clude two members of the current COP,
contend that the plan reduces diversity in
the ASSU and will not succeed in reducing

ASSU bureaucracy.
"This is the first time that students will
have the opportunity to vote for changing
the structure of the COP," said Slemmer.
According to Slemmer, these changes
will make for stronger leadership, less bu
reaucracy and greater accountability in the
ASSU.
Slemmer has proposed that a new five
member judicial branch be created to re
solve constitutional issues in the ASSU.
"Right now, there is really no mecha
nism for the senate to adjudicate violations
of constitutional law," said Slemmer. "All
the ASSU does now is interpret the consti
tution by itself, that can be problematic."
Slemmer cited the problems which arose
last year around the Balanced Funding
Deal, a plan to reform the special-fee sys
tem. Then-ASSU chair Nawwar Kasrawi
may have put the proposal on the ballot in
appropriately, Slemmer said. However,
there was no way to appeal the action? of
the chair except to the senate itself, arid
even then, the senate could only overrule
the chair — not claim his act was unconsti
tutional.
Rich Stolz, a current COP member, said
he opposes the new constitution, saying

that while it appears to streamline
the ASSU by shrinking the senate
and presidency, it does not address
the fundamental problems of the
ASSU, that of internal politicking
and bickering between factions.
Stolz opposes the idea of a judi
ciary, saying it would make parti
san politicking all the more acri
monious.
"The extra branch will, in the
long term, translate into more bu
reaucracy," said Stolz. "Every
time someone wants to stall legis
lation, they could appeal it to the
council. . . . It's not avoiding poli
tics, but just creating another
forum." Opponents also claim that
having an unaccountable judiciary

would strip students of some of
their electoral power.
Additionally, Stolz said the
idea of shrinking the senate and
giving everyone the vote will only
reduce diversity, and not bureau
cracy.
"If you look at the numbers of
voting and non-voting senators,
the attendance numbers are quite
similar. Graduate senators in par
ticular have class conflicts, so get
ting a quorum could be problemat
ic," said Stolz.
In the ASSU Elections Hand
book, current ASSU Senate Chair
Alane Murdock and COP member
Nicole Vazquez said the proposed
constitution "will threaten diver
sity by cutting the size of the
ASSU" and labeled it "one per
son's biased opinions."
The bill's author shrugs off
such criticism. "If you look at who

voted for this bill, basically there
was only one dissenting vote, from
Howard Loo, in the senate," said
Slemmer. "The people who have
the most to lose — the senate
chair, the COP — they are the ones
who are opposing it."
Slemmer pointed out that the
judiciary cannot thwart the ASSU
because all passed proposals re
main in effect during the appeals
process.
As for the arguments of shrink
ing diversity, Slemmer said, "Well,
it's one person, one vote. I always
thought that a vote meant a voice."
