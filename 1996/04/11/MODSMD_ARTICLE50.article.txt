## Chungking Express 
### 
Since "Chungking Express" is being re
leased by Quentin Tarantino et al., you
might figure that it's either ultra-violent or
has some snappy dialogue about last food
in Hong Kong. Actually, what Wong Kar
Wai's pair of alternately whimsical and
wistful romances has in common with
Tarantino's films is a visual style that is as
engaging as it is slick — sometimes so slick
you feel like you're watching an extended
music video. Most music videos, however,
don't have this film's unique take on the

profound effect chance encounters can
have on two people.
Lovelorn Policeman No. 223 (Takeshi
Kaneshiro), the protagonist of the first story,
has an unhealthy predilection for canned
pineapple. Every day he buys a can with an
expiration date of May 1, which is his 25th
birthday and the one-month anniversary of
his break-up. He figures that if his ex-girl
friend doesn't contact him by that time, she's
a lost cause. The night of April 30 finds him
drunk and alone in a bar. Enter a mysterious
woman (Brigitte I.in) who looks like a '50s
glamour queen in her blond wig and sun
glasses. In reality she's a drug smuggler, and
due to a botched delivery, has her own expi
ration date to consider. Still, she's amenable

to No. 223's pick-up line — asking her in
three different dialects whether she likes
pineapple.
The second story involves Policeman No.
633 (Tony Leung), who's carrying his own
torch for an airline stewardess. He's so lonely
that he talks to the objects in his house, par
ticularly his stuffed animals. Enter Faye, the
waifish young woman who works behind the
counter of a snack bar called Midnight Hx
press (Faye is played by 1 long Kong pop star
Faye Wong, who does a dead-on rendition of
the Cranberries' "Dreams" in Cantonese).
Too timid to flirt openly, Faye does the next
best thing: she obtains the key to No. 633's
apartment and sneaks in while he's at work.
She redecorates the cramped, gloomy place,

working to the tunc of her favorite song,
"California Dreamin'."
With its claustrophobic apartments,
crowded streets and bustling markets, Hong
Kong is visually the perfect setting for urban
alienation. Everyone in "Chungking Ex
press" seems to be dreaming of something or
someone else, whether it be lost loves or bet
ter lives. While the members of the mis
matched couples in this film never fully con
nect with each other, their quirky perspec
tives on their relationships do with us. In one
scene, Policeman No. 223 wonders if memo
ries have expiration dates. "Chungking Ex
press" s expiration date may be months from
now.
