Richard (lore fans may be awaiting the release of "Primal Fear" to combat the
actor's recent hit-movie slump. And with the respectable amounts of money
made from Grisham court room "dramas" such as "The Pelican Brief and " Fhe
Client," it's no wonder that Richard Gere jumped on the best-selling-novel-to
movie bandwagon.
Unfortunately, like most films based on popular thriller novels, it's average at
best.
Not that "Primal Fear" doesn't look great at first glance. II I follywood has .1
recipe for success, then "Primal l ear" has .ill the ingredients .1 "thriller" should
have. A catchy title, a "surprise" ending and a silvered-yet-sexy hero exuding dig
nity in his gray trench coat adds up on paper — just not on the screen.
But it is because the film follows a formula that it fails to pull (lore out of' First
Knight" mediocrity. The film suffers from too much glamour and too little re
search.
The I follywood glit/ begins before you even sit down with a title that's chill
ingbut has nothing to do with the movie. Its simply one more in the new "Stick
t he-word-Tear-in the-title" film genre.
The trial scenes suffer similarly. You don't have to be a Court TV fan to cringe
at the disregard for court room procedure. Too much of the plot hinges upon
contrived courtroom drama that would never happen in an actual trial.
The ending, also, was compromised by an attempt to make the movie shock
ing. I lad the movie ended five minutes earlier— minus the twist —it would have
made a credible finish.
Some good elements managed to escape the heavy-handed I lollywood veneer
ing. Id ward Norton's feature film debut as Adam Stampler — a troubled southern
youth accused of murder — marks him a talented, up-and-coming actor.
Fven Gore's performance as attorney Martin Vail was energetic and convinc
ing, especially considering the poor direction and scripting of the film. I lis trans
formation from the jaded, unethical lawyer to a hopeful Samaritan made for a
protagonist that maintained audience interest despite the trite storyline.
Despite these redeeming features, "Primal Fear" isn't a movie that's going to
break (lore's less-than-gleaming recent track record. 1 lis performance was cred
ible, but Hollywood sometimes just can't leave well enough alone.
