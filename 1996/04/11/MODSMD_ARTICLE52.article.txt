# The
						Flower of My Secret
## 
### 
It's about time Pedro Almodovar came out
with another of his darkly funny, sexually
laden comedies. The last really great film he
did was "Women on the Verge of a Nervous
Breakdown," and, thankfully, his latest, "The
Flower of My Secret," exhibits much of the
same brilliance.
The story centers around a Spanish
woman, Leo (Marisa I'a redes), whose life he
gins a slow disintegration after she is unable to
remove a pair of boots given to her by her hus
band, Paco (Imanol Arias). Her husband, in
fact, has been away in Brussels as a profes
sional strategist participating in the Spanish
contingent of the NATO peacekeeping forces

in Bosnia. Until his next visit home, Leo has to
postpone the resolution of what is, essentially,
a broken marriage.
I ler emotional turmoil has left her unable
to fulfill her publishing contract. Her friend
Betty (Carmen Elias) sends Leo to Angel (Juan
Echanove), the editor of the daily "HI Pais."
After some deliberation, Leo begins writing
scathing reviews of her own books under a
pseudonym. Almodovar manages to take all
the threads of Leo's story and interweave them
masterfully with a couple of hilarious and en
dearing subplots.
The first embraces the amusing fighting be
tween Leo's sister (played by the intriguingly
ugly Rossy de Palma) and her mother (Chus
Lampreave), who finally insists on returning to
her rural village. When lx*o goes with her, she is
subjected painfully but beautifully to a form of
provincial soul-healing. The second subplot
revolves around Leo's maid and the maid's in

credibly attractive and sexually enticing son,
Antonio (Joaquin Cortes). Antonio and his
mother put on a great flamenco show which is
attended by Leo and Angel, in a bittersweet
scene that leaves Angel sad and vulnerable.
However, the film's greatness relies mainly
on the great comic moments which are inter
spersed between powerful emotional se
quences. For fear of giving too much away, 1 re
linquish detailing those, lust be on the lookout
for the scene where Leo's publisher asks why
there is no love story in her latest novel, and
know that going to a funeral has never had such
a funny heaviness. The acting, too, is unparal
leled, with some of the best emerging from the
tangential characters such as Leo's mom or An
tonio. If you're in the mood for an intelligent
foreign film that's essentially about life in all its
intricacies, replete with laughs and bitterness,
Almodovar is waiting.
