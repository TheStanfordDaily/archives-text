# War stories sophocles' "Ajax" at the Nitery Theater
## 
### Zachary Thacher 
Sophocles is not a quiet writer. His plays
boom with eloquence and emotion as he
stages dramas of perversion, war and love.
But director Rush Rehm capitalizes on si
lence in his Drama Department adaptation
of "Ajax." The tragedy is neatly bookended
with moments of quiet in an otherwise
stormy play.
From Hades to Troy we see two heroic fig
ures, Odysseus and Ajax, standing alone,
with no words to express their sense of loss
or anger. The Stanford cast creates this
loaded silence with the same ease and excel
lence as they perform the play.
Sophocles' "Ajax" is now running at the
Nitery theater. The black, box-like space
presents a large, bare stage with fixed light
ing sequences and minimal props. A stylized
tent sits backstage and costume accessories
hang on stages right and left, where the cho
rus awaits. A few characters enter from off
stage, shouting lines from the lobby or back
row of chairs, but most remain before the
audience. They turn to the wall or kneel to
indicate that they aren't in a scene.
The clean stage and minimal costumes

(similar to martial arts uniforms) allow the
lines of Sophocles' play to flow through the
actors without interference. He is one of the
most eloquent, lasting and profound of the
Greek playwrights. This play, although
minor in his repertoire, speaks with incredi
ble language and feeling. It is as accessible to
modern viewers as it once was to an ancient
Greek audience. The direction in this con
temporary production, at times pretentious
and overdone, obscures the poetic dialogue
in only a few scenes.
Chorus members, who double as most of
the cast, float around the stage in haphazard,
modern dance-like movements while they
sing their lines, talk, chant or make weird
noises. The avant-garde direction of the
chorus is excellent when it is precise, but em
barrassing when it quickly becomes self
conscious and meaningless. However, the
direction and individual performances of
Ajax (Dan Hunt), Odysseus (Joaquin Tor
res) and Tecmessa (Caroline Bicks) are spec
tacular.
Ajax is a popular Greek warrior who fights
the Trojan war along side his old rival
Odysseus. But Ajax's prowess and skill as a
soldier arc lost to his obsessive doubts, hubris

and fears of failure. He tells us that everyone
is better than him: his father, the gods,
Odysseus, even his young son. He suffers
from an overwhelming inferiority complex
that is magnified when the arms of fallen
Achilles' are awarded to Odysseus. We learn
that the vote was fixed by the army's chiefs
of-staff. When the jealous loser vows to kill
Odysseus and Generals Agamemnon and
Menelaus, his military career slips out from
under him. This is where the play begins.
Ajax's war bride, Tecmessa, is a captured
wife, more like a slave, who soon falls in love
with her husband. She implores him to
come back to his senses after he begins to kill
sheep and cattle thinking they are his ene
mies. We arc told that Athena cast a spell on
Ajax because she could not bear to watch a
Greek shed Greek blood.
Ajax is humiliated by his deluded cattle
slaughter. Although Tecmessa begs him to
forgive himself, he says he is irredeemable..
We soon learn what makes for a good
tragedy. Ajax is mortified by his deeds, the
Greek army laughs at the once brave soldier
and his generals are furious that they were
almost murdered by one of their own.
While the drama builds into a storm of

accusations, family pride and murderous
vanity, the play doesn't lose focus. Rehm, a
drama professor, manages to keep the play in
a cool balance. The set is always staged with
simple, classical and effective direction.
Adaptations of the Greeks are difficult,
and Rehm infuses avant-garde projections
with classical sensibilities to create an inter
esting, provocative and emotive play. Be
yond a few spots of overdone direction, he
succeeds to make a tragedy written thou
sands of years ago to speak, if not shout, to
audiences today. When I left the Nitery the
ater, 1 had the sad nostalgia of catharsis
sweep over me and evaporate into the dark
ness outside the Old Union. Not many di
rectors and student actors can do that for an
audience.
