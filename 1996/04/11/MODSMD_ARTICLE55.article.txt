The first tunc on Blur's latest album "I he
Great I scape" is titled "Stereotypes."
Which is apt enough, because, .it first
glance, the record typifies all that is brushed
off as being "too British Vet when singer
Damon Albarn cackles in his best Cockney,
" There must be more to life than stereo
types," he shouts down any prejudices even
as he plays them up. While a cliche always
reveals some truth, its still a cliche, some
thing-trite and almost meaningless.
lor the past few years, the music-trend
cliche has been Brit pop. But all the harping
on whether American audiences "get" Pulp
and the soap-opera interest in second-hand
accounts of the Blur vs.-Oasis deal obscures
the impact the Brit frenzy has already made
on American rock culture. More than a fad
waiting to happen, Britpop has happened
and is happening.
Not only have stateside listeners taken to

more generic. Live- 105-ready sounds of
Oasis and Radiohead, but they have also
embraced, if only for the moment, the quin
tessential Britpop of Blur's "C iiris and Boys
and Pulp's "Common People." Of course,
the initial charm of both songs is that they
.ire "so British;" yet both songs go beyond
such a superficial description because the
vivid compositions are socially meaningful
and aspire to the universal, lust consider the
titles of the songs.
Obnoxiously omnipresent in its day,
"Ciirls and Boys was the out-of-nowhere
song of the summer a few years back, as hot
and bothered as a muggy lulv. A seemingly
brainless dance novelty when sandwiched
by Wee/er and the Stone Temple Pilots, the
new wave rave-up has stood the test of time,
preciously smug and seethingly subversive
in spite of its puzzling popularity. If any
thing, its wry sarcasm and smarmy wit come

through clearly out of context: As agitprop
that doesn't take itself too seriously, verses
like "Avoiding all work / Cause it's not avail
able" are underhanded slaps to the slackers
who made it a club hit worldwide, a kiss off
to Brit twits and American frat assholes
alike.
In contrast, Pulp takes itselt very serious
ly indeed. So is the American public, as evi
denced by Pulp's transatlantic one-ott on
Letterman last Friday. On the current Brit
pop lave "(Common People," conflict boils at
the surface in singer Jarvis Cocker's biting,
scathing words. While the early verses scowl
and tense up, the rest of the song is a desper
ate release, a platform for those who live a
life "with no meaning or control" to speak
up. Sincere energy and ulterior motive com
bine overwhelmingly, to the extent that de
tails and subtlety are all but inconsequen
tial. Where Blur's cheeky tune expresses its

social message subliminally, Pulp takes its
point over the top, stylizing its version of
class struggle in an epic pop song.
The comparison of "Girls and Boys and
"Common People renders "Britpop as an
irrelevant, empty term. Pigeonholing two
songs of such differing appeals and tone
under a stereotype only reveals the limita
tions of stereotypes. So while the Britpop
tag might apply to bland calculation ot
could-bes and has-beens like Supergrass
and Lush, it doesn't quite fit Blur and Pulp.
Even if their aspirations are no more than
the ego-stroke of making it big in America,
the two bands transcend commercialism
and categorization in their striking portraits
of everyday life. And no worries that superi
or songwriting won't get noticed, because it
already has.
Now if only an American audience was as
discerning about its homemade culture...
