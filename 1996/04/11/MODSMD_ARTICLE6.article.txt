# Sontag calls for novel connection
## 
### Amy Slucter Staff writer 
If reading is mental traveling, as author Susan
Sontag believes, then Sontag must be a world
traveler.
As an artist and intellectual, Sontag has had
ample space to view the world through the eyes of
the characters in her three novels and four fea
ture-length films and through those of the writ
ers and thinkers she admires, all of which were
topics in a Kresge Auditorium speech last night.
Her most recent novel, "The Volcano Lover,"
is an exploration of the world and culture
grounded in a historical context. The novel, ac
cording to Sontag, is about passions.
The novel tells the story of the passions be
tween Sir William Hamilton, the 18th-century
English minister to the Court of Naples, his wife
Emma and the naval hero Horatio Lord Nelson.
Writing it, Sontag said she experienced a trans
formation in her literary approach.
"I think the job of the writer is to acknowledge
the existence of the world and to redeem the
world. To give voice to emotions which are re
pressed. To enliven the world. To enliven against
conformity and sterility of imagination," she
said.
In her lecture, titled "Rethinking the Novel,"
Sontag offered prescriptive ethical advice on how
to approach writing and living. Although she

facetiously referred to her pre
sentation as a "sermon," she .did
take a moment to decry the
degradation of mass culture and
to encourage passionate engage
ment.
"I think we live in a culture
that encourages triviality, apa
thy, shallowness — all sorts of
terrible things," Sontag said.
"I'm rather concerned with the
normative role literature could
have. A more honorable rela
tionship to the event of being
alive is first of all a question of
imagination and empathy," she
said.
According to Susan Dunn,
associate director of the Hu

manities Center, the center has
long wanted to bring Sontag to
Stanford as a Rhoda and Elliott
Levinthal Distinguished Visi
tor. Sontag, however, was de
layed by her commitments in
Sarajevo. Since April 1993 Son
tag has spent her time between
New York and Sarajevo. In July
and August of 1993 she adapted
Samuel Beckett's production
"Waiting for Godot" for presen
tation in the besieged capital.
"The purpose of the Levinthal
Distinguished Visitor is to bring
a public intellectual to Stan
ford," said Dunn. "Susan Sontag
is a very unique. She is known
not only as a novelist but also
someone who thinks about the
world and culture."
Sontag will speak again on
"Cruelty and Apathy" Tuesday
at 8 p.m. in Kresge.
