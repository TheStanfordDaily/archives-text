# Just don't call it C-SPAN
## In a first, ASSU Senate to broadcast meetings live 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate's next meeting will be broad
cast live on the campus television station Stanford
Cardinal Broadcasting Network as part of a pilot
program designed to make student government
more open and accessible.
The April 23 meeting will be the first senate
meeting to be broadcast live. Gil Serrano, the sena
tor who fulfilled a campaign promise to televise
meetings, said he knows of no other university that
has previously tried to do live broadcasts of its stu
dent government.
To accommodate the introduction of new video
equipment into its sessions, the senate will change
its meeting place, from the Law School to the
Thornton annex near the Terman Engineering
Building.
The pilot program will televise all five senate
meetings remaining this year. Only the first two
hours of the meetings will be broadcast, from 7 p.m.
to 9 p.m., although meetings sometimes last longer.
In the past, senate meetings have occasionally
been taped and televised at a later time. A tape of
Tuesday night's meeting will be aired tonight at 6
p.m. on channel 5 for viewers with access to Stan
ford cable. The format of the coverage will include
no commentary.
Currently, the program is funded through the
Office of Dean of Students Marc Wais. Waissaid his
office has a budget designed to encourage student
initiatives, but that the ASSU will have to find
other funding sources if it wants the broadcasts to
continue next year.
Coverage costs about $180 per senate meeting,
according to Serrano, and is paid to the Stanford In
structional Television Network for the use of a
room and equipment. Serrano said SITN is provid-

ing a discounted rate for its facilities. He also said
Senate Chair Alane Murdock had agreed to change
the location of the senate's meetings to a room that
has the facilities necessary to broadcast meetings.
Serrano said he hopes the ASSU will eventually
fund broadcasts, but this will require a vote of stu
dents next April. In the meantime, Serrano and
SCBN station manager Eric Gavidia, who said he
has been working on getting the senate on the air
for over a year, are working to find sponsors.
Gavidia said he and Serrano are sending a letter
asking for sponsorship, endorsed by Wais and An
thony DiPaolo, director of SITN, to all the heads of
academic departments.
"It's a $1,000 investment for one quarter," Ga
vidia said, "but it's a good cause." Serrano ex
plained that the ASSU's tax status as a student or
ganization does not allow it to raise money through
advertising.
Both Serrano and Gavidia said they hope that
televising the meetings will lead to improvements in
the functioning of the senate.
Gavidia summed up his reasons for supporting a
televised senate as "two words: accountability and
accessibility." He explained that the first meeting
he had filmed featured such antics as "senators
bouncing off the walls," and that he looked forward
to "exposing the student body to what their elected
senators are doing."
Serrano agreed that televised meetings would
"cut down a lot on the unprofessionalism, and
maybe senators will take their jobs more seriously."
He also thought airing the senate meetings would
be helpful to students who are considering running
for ASSU office.
"They could find out what student government is
all about in college," he explained, adding that with
out broadcasting, "The only way people know about
meetings is by senators wearing sweatshirts."
