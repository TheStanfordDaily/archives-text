Special Fees
Stanford Jazz Orchestra: Fee Request $12,289.16
(Add $500 to Honoraria)
The Stanford Film Socicty (SFS) began this
year to foster the appreciation of film, and we stand as the
only campus group devoted to its meaningful study. By
offering film screenings, speakers, and production oppor
tunities for students, we seek to expose our student body
and educate them about this powerful medium. At the
same time, we wish to entertain the community as we
strive to make all of our events enjoyable, fulfilling, and
educational. We aim to offer alternatives to the main
stream hits often shown on campus and to provide free
outlets for approaching different aspects of film in a seri
ous, in-depth manner.
Functioning chiefly on a grant from the
Stanford Alumni Association and ASSU Program Board
funding, SFS has progressed toward reaching its goals in
its first year. We consider our three greatest accomplish
ments thus far to be co-sponsoring Oliver Stone's cam
pus appearance, screening KIDS for more than 1800
people, and producing two Bmm films, with two 16mm
being currently produced for premiere May 30.
Next year, SFS looks to accomplish much
more, highlighted by a major quarterly thematic series
featuring speakers and films on multiple evenings (Fall
'96's will be The Psychology of Violence). We also plan
to screcn more films, largely in our new Crossing Com
munities Through Film series. Our production endeav
ors, too, will be augmented and will each involve roughly
fifty people. A strong, active membership is also vital to
our success, and we will focus more on providing more
educational and social events that center around film. The
SFS board will be restructured as well to correct prob
lems that arose this year. And, as our group continues to
grow, we will gain leverage to advocate for enhanced aca
demic resources and classes through which to approach
film intelligently.
Our special fee request amounts to roughly $2
per student for the entire year. This amount would be
expected to fund 1/3 to 1/2 of our 1996-1997 operating
budget, and it would be earmarked to pay for events that
serve a great number and wide variety of students. As a
new, and admittedly somewhat unproven group, we do
not ask you to approve the majority of our budget, but
only events that seek to benefit a substantial portion of
our community. Please join with us to achieve our vision
for the coming year, and to establish a new tradition for
film at Stanford.
