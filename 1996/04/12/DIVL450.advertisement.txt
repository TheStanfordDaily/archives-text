The Future of China Relations
into the Next Century
Harry Wu
Join us for an evening with world
renowned human rights activist
Harry Wu. Nineteen years a
prisoner in the laogai/ China's
infamous forced labor prison
system, Harry Wu is now
Executive Director of the Laogai
Research Foundation and a
Visiting Scholar at Stanford
University's Hoover Institution. At
great personal risk, he has
returned repeatedly to China to
document and film human rights
abuses in the laogai. In 1995 he
was detained and imprisoned by
the Chinese. He continues to work
tirelessly for human rights in
China and for the Tibetans' right
to self-determination.
