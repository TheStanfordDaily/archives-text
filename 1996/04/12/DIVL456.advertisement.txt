Pi ENDORSEMENTS
Stanford North $150
Dakota League (1 c)
® YES O NO
There arc only eight of 'em and they're only
asking tor some cash to call home once a month.
And lor goodness' sakes. they're from North
Dakota. They don't even have Wall Drug, but
there is free ice water at every meeting!
Stanford Lactose $18,631
Awareness Committee (SLAC) ($1.33)
O VES ® NO
We hate to sa\ it. but at SIS.(S3I, the SLAC is
milking us for more than they're worth. Yes.
calcium is important. Sure, milk does a body
good. But the SLAC s fee request is self-defeating
if the Stanford student body spills eight grand
for milk awareness, they'll have barely enough
cash left for a half pint! Besides, the SLAC is a
University committee — if they need money, let
them skim it off the University's budget.
Def Leppard $11.99 (plus tax)
Appreciation Club (DLAC) (2 lira)
® YES O NO
You might want to pour some sugar on me. but
pour some funds into the DLAC's coffers as
well. They've completed their collection of bass
guitarist Rick "Sa\" Savage's hair picks from
the Seven l)a\ Weekend and Hysteria Tours, and
the\ '\c got the largest collection of Del I .eppard
45s in North America (including the ever-elusive
"Armageddon It" single with the London
supergroup's cover of "Copacabana" on the B
Side). Their "Pvromania" cassette, however, was
left in direct sunlight and the club needs a
replacement. The CD retails for SI 3.'99. but the
DLAC said they could haggle the guy at Tower
down to SI 1.99. Support the DLAC...and let's
get rocked!
Stanford Solar $6,400
Plexus Project ($0.46)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
This project, attempting to alleviate the
greenhouse problems of gas-gu/./.ling plexi
already in use. is asking for just too much funding.
$6,400 is too much to ask for their goal of
"Building a Better Plexus — for Stanford... and
America!"
My Tuition $26,000 or so
($1.85)
® YES O NO
("moil guys, that's $26,000 divided by. say.
13.0(H) of you... so that's only, what? Two bucks
a head? I'm worth it. I really am. I swear. I got
a B+ last quarter. And I can also do neat tricks
with a Zippo when I'm drunk!
