# Graffiti sparks concern

In response to recent vandal
ism of the Asian American Activi
ties Center, the University will
enforce stricter campus security
around the center, Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais said at an Asian
American Students Association
meeting last night.
In two incidents last week,
racial epithets were written on a
computer screen and on the re
frigerator in Room 14 of the cen
ter. During winter quarter, an un
known vandal wrote "Chinks
suck" on a table used by the Kore
an literary magazine Reflections.
These three incidents have dis
turbed both University officials
and the Asian community. In a
statement, Vice Provost and Dean
for Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds expressed the University's
concern about the vandalism.
"The Asian students are a very
strong, valued and vital part of
our university," Edmonds said.
"Such actions go against what
this university stands for. We will
do what we can to ensure that
such actions do not occur in the
future."
In order to prevent future acts
of vandalism, Stanford Police will
make the center more of a focwl
point during their night and early
morning rounds, according to
Rick Yuen, director of the center.
The center will also implement
tougher security measures.
"We're looking at bolstering
the locks," Yuen said. "I'm inter
ested in keeping this center as
open as possible, because I think
that's important, but at the same
time I want to avoid this situa
tion."
If the suspects are apprehend
ed, Wais said, the University's
stance will depend on whether the
vandals are students.
" There's a campus judicial sys
tem,'' Wais said, "which I believe
that those people would go
through concerning a violation of
tht' Fundamental Standard. If
they're outside the campus, Stan
ford will take full action as a uni
versity against these people."
Wais declined to comment on
what punishment would be appro
priate — citing the difficulties of
establishing motive, whether the
graffiti constitutes a hate crime
and if the three incidents are con
nected — until the perpetrators
are apprehended.
Members of the Asian-Ameri
can community expressed their
shock and dismay at the vandalism.
"Part of the reason it's really

disturbing," senior Kris Hayashi
said, "is remembering how hard
people have fought for this space.
Ethnic centers are an example of a
safe space for the community and
the fact that someone can come in
and destroy that safety is really
shocking."
Because of Stanford's role as a
leading research university, the
vandalism has received national
recognition, Yuen said.
"We've been getting calls from
Asian alumni who have been here
several years," Yuen said, "and
they've been calling in expressing
their concern. Many national orga
nizations have also called in ex
pressing their support."
Wais urged anyone who had
any information relating to the
vandalism to contact the campus
police.
"We take this very seriously,"
Wais said. "The incident really
does attack what Stanford stands
for. We're very concerned about
this and we want to work together
with the community in order toen
sure that this never happens
airain."
