# A 						chance to lead a year-long bash
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Some say it's a big popularity contest, but this

year's senior class presidents
slates would say winning next
week's election is not that sim
ple.
Though they all plan on
milking their senior year a
memorable, year-long bash,
the six slates say they are

poised to take on all the time-consuming work
that hosting that soiree will involve.
Charged with the fun but difficult task of or
ganizing parties, pub nights and fund-raisers, the
four to be crowned next year's senior class presi
dents will be expected — in the wise words of
Aaron Lehman, one of this year's presidents — to
" make senior year the best year."
Inviting classmates to "get plugged into" class
spirit and unity, Herman Agoyo, Cristale Brown,
Patty Ferguson and Julia Macias of the "Plugged
In" slate promise to add more on-campus activi
ties to the traditional lineup of Palo Alto pub
nights.
Possible events include a dinner with San
Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, a speaker series
of successful alumni, barbecues and a senior ver
sion of "MuFuUnSun" — a field games Olympics
during which teams consisting of friends from
freshman dorms compete for prizes.
One of the group's strengths, according to Ma
cias, is its diversity, both ethnic and extracurric
ular. "Between the four of us, we reach out to a lot
of aspects of campus life," Macias said.

Members of "Saturday Night Fever" — Nima
Farzan, Jason Herthel, Yu-Jin Kim and Sarah
Wolf — also highlight diversity as one of their
major assets.
Combining the boisterous school spirit of a
former Stanford dollie, the organizational know
how of a Kappa Kappa Gamma social chair and
the financial savvy of a Theta Delta Chi financial
manager and Stanford Fund representative,
"Saturday Night Fever" is a group that "knows
how to get things done," Farzan said.
One of the innovations the group hopes to in
troduce into next year's schedule of senior events
is a class-wide "philanthropy day," during which
the whole class would participate in a day of com
munity service in East Palo Alto.
Members of "Fantastic Voyage" — Christo
pher Gow, Grace Wang, David Wolitz and Jen
nifer Yu — have similar plans for hosting a day of
community service. Participating in a day of com
passionate volunteerism, Yu said, is a great way
to promote class unity.
In addition, Yu said the slate plans to organize
mixers between seniors and recent graduates in
an effort to make the search for job connections
less intimidating.
Yu said that although "Fantastic Voyage" ac
knowledges the importance of trying to find a
Stanford alumnus to speak at next year's Com
mencement, they are "open to all suggestions the
class might have." Members of other slates had
similar opinions on the Commencement speaker.
Catherine Beattie, Rodrigo Gutierrez, Robert
Hatta and Bryan Vaniman of "Celebration" al
ready have a famous icon of the entertainment
industry in mind for Commencement, though for

now they are keeping the name a secret.
"It's someone who would add a little spice and
excitement to Commencement," Hatta said. "It's
someone we could very possibly get, someone
who would fit into our whole fun, light-hearted
approach to senior year."
Calling her slate "spontaneous and silly" best
friends, Beattie said, "We've always heard a lot of
complaints about Stanford students being so dri
ven and career-oriented that they don't really
have fun. We hope to encourage everyone to ease
up for their last year and have a great time."
"PHAT" — composed of Hadley Abernathy,
Aymeric Fraise, Brant Richards and Bella Shen
— has visions of a more well-informed Class of
'97. Promising to create a senior Web page and
offer weekly Coffee House hours, Shen said keep
ing classmates up to date on programs and events
will make the class feel more like a family.
The slate also plans to set up a "big sib-little
sib" program between seniors and freshmen,
spinning off the success many of the ethnic cen
ters have had with similar mentoring programs.
"The Revolution" — composed of Carter Lip
ton, Ryan McCarthy, Hiten Patel and Eliel Swin
ton — are running on campaign promises to
make senior year one big party.
"People who know us know we know how to
have a great time," Lipton said. "That's redly the
most important thing about being class presi
dents."
"The Revolution" wants to revamp what they
see lis a general lack of class unity. Among possi
ble activities lire Friday afternoon parties, live
concerts and class trips to Lake Tahoe or Bay
Area beaches.
