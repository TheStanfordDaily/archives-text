# Trimmed-down Sorority Rush begins
## 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
In a new location, a day shorter
and with less fuss, Sorority Rush
begins today.
Gone are the tents filled with
elaborate decorations and sorority
women performing long skits. This
year greets a much simpler Rush
process, in which the focus is more
on Rushees getting the opportuni
ty to talk with various sorority
members.
"We wanted to make Rush more
low-key," Intersorority Council
Co-Rush Chair Jen Kersey said.
This year, more time during the
Rush parties is allotted for Rushees
to speak with sorority members, as
opposed to watching them perform
skits. The entire Rush process is
shorter, having gone from five to
four days. Kersey said the adjust

ment was made because a five-day
Rush is not necessary for only six
sororities.
Sorority Rush will be taking
place at Palo Alto High School
today through Sunday, and prefer
ence parties — which narrow the
pool of women who will be offered
bids from a sorority — will be held
Monday night at the Palo Alto Hol
iday Inn.
According to Director of Stu
dent Activities Nanci Howe, ISC
would like to get a space on campus
for Rush in the future, but this
often proves to be difficult.
Marguerite, the campus shuttle,
will provide buses for Rushees
from Tresidder Union to the off
campus Rush locations.
ISC does not current ly have the
numbers for how many women will
rush this year, but it estimates
around 250 Rushees, ISC Co-Rush

Chair Irene Yackovlev said. The
number of bids given out will de
pend on how many people rush, she
said.
"Our goal is to be flexible,"
Yackovlev said. "Our idea of Rush
is to accommodate as many women
as we can. We try to make it so that
every woman who makes it to the
end gets a bid."
Howe said she agrees with this
philosophy. She said Sorority Rush
differs from Fraternity Rush for
two reasons. One is that Sorority
Rush gives every Rushee the op
portunity to look at every sorority.
The second reason is that bids can
be provided for all women who are
interested but do not limit their op
tions.
Howe also cited the existence of
the Rush counselors, or Rho ('his,
in making Sorority Rush unique.
Rho Chis are sorority members se

lected by their chapters to disasso
ciate themselves from their sorori
ties during the Rush process, ac
cording to Howe. They are expect
ed to answer questions and give im
partial advice to help Rushees
make the best decisions.
"We're expecting a great Rush
this year," Yackovlev said. "We
have made some very positive
changes to make women feel more
comfortable, and to give them a
chance to see the positive aspects of
the sororities without the clutter."
Alpha Kappa Delta Phi, the
Asian-American interest sorority,
is also currently having its Rush.
This sorority is an affiliate member
of ISC, but runs its Rush process a
bit differently. According to Presi
dent Shanon Takaoka, the first
three days of Rush are informa
tional and only the last event is an
invitational.
