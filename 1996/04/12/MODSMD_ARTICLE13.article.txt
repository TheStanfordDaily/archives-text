## Young pilot dies in crash Small plane nose-dives to the ground 'like a dart' 
### 
CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) - A 7-
year-old girl who hoped to become
the youngest person to fly cross
country was killed yesterday when
her small plane nose-dived to the
ground "like a dart" soon after tak
ing off in driving rain and snow.
Her father and her flight instruc
tor also died.
Jessica Dubroff, who used a red
booster seat and extenders so her
legs could reach the control pedals,
spoke to her mother by telephone
even as she revved the engine on
the runway.
Lisa Blair Hathaway said she
heard no word of problems as the
three began to take off and ended
the communication.
"I beg people to let children fly if
they want to fly," a teary-eyed
Hathaway said before flying from
Boston to Wyoming to claim her
daughter's body. She had flown
ahead to Massachusetts to await
the arrival of Jessica and her ex
husband.
"Clearly I would want all my
children to die in a state of joy, but
not at age 7," Hathaway said.
Jessica, her father, Lloyd
Dubroff, and flight instructor Joe
Reid began their journey Wednes

day morning in Half Moon Bay,
Calif., and spent the night in
Cheyenne. They planned to arrive
today in Falmouth, Mass.
The Cessna 1778 owned by
Reid crashed about one mile north
of the Cheyenne Municipal Air
port, narrowly missing houses and
cars. Its tail section came to a rest
just 25 feet from one home's
garage.
"I kept thinking, 'Please! Please
get some altitude!"' said Tom
Johnson, a 15-year pilot who saw
the plane fall. "It just went right
into the ground. I knew no one sur
vived. It would have been impossi
ble."
Johnson, whose office is about a
half-block from the crash site, said
he spotted the plane shortly after
takeoff and it appeared the pilot
was trying to return to the airport.
He said the plane never got higher
than 400 feet.
"It stalled over my building,
winged over and went straight into
the ground like a dart," he said.
Hours after the crash, the Fed
eral Aviation Administration said
it would review rules that govern
when a pilot can allow an unli
censed passenger to fly the plane.

Youngsters have to be at least
16 to solo at the controls of an air
plane. But children of any age can
fly alongside a licensed pilot, who
may let them operate the controls
if he feels it is safe.
Shortly before takeoff, Jessica
told a reporter for Cheyenne televi
sion station KK'l'U she thought
about one thing when flying:
crashing. Hut she said she did not
worry about it.
Jessica lived with her mother, a
9-year-old brother, Joshua, and a
3-year-old sister, Jasmine, in
Pescadero, a rural community
about 40 miles south of San Fran
cisco. Lloyd Dubroff lived with his
second wife in San Mateo.
The children were schooled at
home, learning to read, write and
do arithmetic through such real
life activities as flying, riding hors
es and even helping rebuild a
house.
On Tuesday, Lloyd Dubroff said
he was inspired by another young
girl's cross-country flight several
years ago, and when Jessica
expressed an interest in flying, he
asked her if she would like to try
such a flight. She agreed. "I'm the
culprit," Dubroff said.
