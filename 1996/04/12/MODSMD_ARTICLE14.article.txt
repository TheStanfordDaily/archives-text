# Two Freemen surrender to FBI

JORDAN, Mont. (AP) - Two of the
Freemen sought on charges by (lu* FBI
surrendered yesterday, driving a pickup
t ruck out of the compound and turning
themselves in to the FBI.
U.S. Attorney Sherry Matteuci iden
tified them as Ebert W. Stanton, 2J,
and Agnes B. Stanton, 52, both of
Brusett.
News reporters saw them taken
away in handcuffs from a road outside
the Freemen's heavily armed com
pound, which they call "Justus Town
ship," and driven away in a government
truck.
Both Stantons are charged with con
spiracy, mail fraud and bank fraud in

connection with the writing of at least
$19.5 million in bogus checks and
money orders between August 1994
and December 1995.
Ebert Stanton is also charged with
armed robbery for taking $66,000 in
equipment from an ABC television crew
in October 1995. He also was charged
with threatening public officials.
About 10 others in the compound
face state or federal charges ranging
from writing bad checks and imperson
ating public officials to threatening to
kidnap and murder a U.S. district
judge.
The standoff began March 25 after
the FBI arrested two Freemen leaders

who had left the compound.
Local residents initially welcomed
the federal response to the anti-govern
ment group, which has tested their
patience by blocking their attempts to
buy land and begin spring planting.
Although the Freemen have
refrained from violence, rancher K.L.
Bliss says the group has "hurt me plen
ty, and a lot of other people, too."
Bliss and other ranchers last year
bought foreclosed property that had
been owned by the Freemen. The mili
tant group, however, does not recognize
state property laws, keeping the ranch
ers from getting the land or the financ
ing needed to pay for it.
