Plan to televise ASSU
meetings is a positive
move by Senate, SCBN

Most students know
that the ASSU Senate exists
— they might even know
the name of a senator or two — but
few have ever bothered to attend its
weekly Tuesday night meetings in
the Law School.
And for good reason: the meetings
are often long and boring. After all,
the ASSU Senate is notorious for
debating insignificant points for
hours on end. By any conventional
standards, such a subject — particu
larly because it lacks any significant
amount of violence, a noteworthy
sex-scandal plotline or even a stand
up comedian — should not make for
good television.
But one of the advantages of non
commercial television is that sta
tions unconcerned with maintaining
high ratings and advertising rev
enues can afford to do the right
thing, even if doing so doesn't quite
pull in Superbowl-sized ratings.
By announcing that it will begin
broadcasting ASSU Senate meetings
live, SCBN has demonstrated that it
is able and willing to do what's right.
The student-run station — car
ried on Stanford's cable system as
channel 5 — should be congratulated
for its efforts, as should the senate
itself and Dean of Students Marc
Wais, who has extended funding to
support the experiment through the
end of the school year.
Criticisms of the senate aside, stu
dents are entitled to know what their
elected representatives are doing.
Televising senate meetings is an easy
and relatively inexpensive way to
bring student government closer to
the electorate, and perhaps even
encourage students to get involved.
Often the senate complains that
its accomplishments aren't recog
nized; with television coverage of
what it does, the senate should be

able to directly communicate its
accomplishments to the electorate.
Also, students will be able to see
first-hand what the senate actually
does in its meetings.
There are a few problems with the
plan, however. The proposal calls for
moving senate meetings from the
Law School to a lecture hall in
Thornton Engineering Center. This
is necessary for technical reasons,
but the new room's small size and
design might hamper the way sena
tors communicate and do business.
Still, this is only an experiment, and
Thornton's drawbacks should not
keep it from moving on.
Another concern is the fact that
only the first two hours of each meet
ing will be televised. As any veteran
senate watcher knows, meetings can
drag on much longer; last quarter
one lasted until 2 a.m. Although
broadcasting such long meetings
would be more expensive, there's lit
tle point in recording the first two
hours of a meeting when equally, if
not more, important business will be
conducted later in the evening. In
the future, the senate should look
into the possibility of documenting
complete meetings on video, even if
they are not broadcast live.
Finally, the senate should be care
ful to keep members from letting the
cameras affect the way they act. For
all the good it has done for American
political participation, C-SPAN —
the cable network that covers
Congress — has also created a new
bully pulpit for U.S. politicians.
For all the drawbacks, however,
televising senate meetings is a good
idea. Accountability, the key to any
successful representative body,
would increase and could very well
keep the senate from debating some
of the more ridiculous topics it has
tackled this year. ll' the experiment
is successful, the senate should find
funding to support the project for
the next school year, and should take
steps to publicize their meetings so
students know they can tune in.
Then, perhaps, next year's sen
ate sweatshirts could read "ASSII
Senate meeting tonight — live on
channel 5."
