Students deserve input
on University's future
Although I was not privy to the dis
cussion, I found it regrettable that the
Faculty Senate voted last week to
exclude student membership on the con
tinuing Planning and Policy Board.
In my almost 25 years at Stanford, I
have served on and chaired many Uni
versity committees. Occasionally these
committees dealt with sensitive and con
troversial issues. Never have I found
student participation to be problematic.
To the contrary, student members have
usually brought valuable information
and fresh perspectives to our delibera
tions.
Stanford has had a proud tradition of
regular student participation in the gov
ernance of the University, and I think
that tradition has helped us deal with
many potentially explosive issues
through open, democratic, constructive
processes. Perhaps the board may
become engaged in some deliberations of
sensitive, confidential issues such as

appointments and promotions or depart
mental reviews. In such cases it would
be entirely appropriate to convene exec
utive sessions of members of the aca
demic council and senior administrators,
but to exclude student participation
from all of the work of the board is a
mistake in my view.
Today's students are tomorrow's
alumni, and we should encourage them
to take an active interest in the future of
the University. I hope that the new
board will co-opt student members to
assist it with its important work.

Daily columnist was
unfair in criticisms
of Fraternity Rush
Rush has begun, and once again
Daily columnists are using their pre
cious editorial space to ridicule the
Greek system. The most recent exam

pie appeared yesterday contending, as
they all do, that Rush is a mean,
superficial process, and that fraterni
ties are simply frivolous cliques offer
ing nothing more than beer and hous
ing. We realize that many of these
pieces are written as a joke, but they
are indicative of misperceptions con
cerning the value of Greek organiza
tions.
The Greek system is, and has been
since the founding of the University, a
vital component of student life at
Stanford. Historically — and in all
fairness — Greeks have been held to
higher standards because of their
selectivity as student organizations.
The process of Fraternity Rush is
one that has evolved over time to
remove barriers of superficial subjec
tivity. With the elimination of many of
these barriers, and especially with the
addition of unhoused groups and eth
nic-based groups, the composition of
the Greek population is much differ
ent today than it was in 1891 or even
1981.
At a university where academics can

be all-consuming, joining a fraternity
can a provide a new and enriching
aspect to an individual's college experi
ence. Greeks are some of the most
involved and spirited students on cam
pus and carry many of their friend
ships beyond Stanford. Developing
friendships is the reason for the cre
ation of fraternities and sororities, and
is the force behind their prosperity.
These friendships begin with Rush.
Spread over two weeks, it provides a
fun and laid-back environment
through which a rushee can meet a lot
of interesting and friendly individuals.
The major criterion on which a frater
nity evaluates a potential member is
that individual's interest in the orga
nization. Indeed, Rush is more about
an individual choosing a fraternity
rather than the fraternity choosing
him.
Rush, have fun and see for yourself,
