Friends and relatives yesterday
remembered Francesca Beard as
someone who loved life, was quick
to laugh and had a strong will.
About 200 people came to
Memorial Church for a memorial
service for Beard, a Stanford
freshman who died Sunday of
heart failure. Among the crowd

were most of Beard's dormmates
from Rinconada House, all of
whom were wearing blue ribbons
in her mcmoiy.
"Francesca saw beauty and she
was beautiful," said her room
mate, Jessie Dubreuil.
Another close friend, Becky
Shaftel, described the day of
Beard's death, when a group went

heart failure.

to the beach together.
Although Stanford was en
veloped in sun, the weather at the
beach was foggy. Still, Shaftel said,
Beard loved the fog and enjoyed
playing in the waves and lying on
the sand before the group headed
home, stopping on the way to in
dulge in Slurpees and Heard's fa
vorite, a marshmallow bunny, at a
7-11 convenience store.
"I'd like to think Frankie had a
perfect last day, full of indul
gences," Shaflel said.
Beard's older sister, Albertine, a
senior at Stanford, stretched back
further into her sister's life, recall
ing how they overcame an initial
jealousy to become friends.
"She began as my baby sister,
she became my companion and
archrival, and she ended up as my
best friend," Albertine Beard said.
Her sister was someone who
loved to learn, without ever asking
for praise after completing a task,
Albertine said. When Francesca
was 5 years old, she said, she taught
herself to read, but no one found
out about the success until
Francesca read a sign in a window
out loud.
Another time, when the family
was in Florence, Italy, for a year, Al
bertine came home complaining
about an essay she had to write in
Italian. Francesca got tired of lis
tening, grabbed the paper with the
assignment and left the room.

"Five minutes later, she re
turned with a finished essay in
hand, asking, 'Now can we go out
and play?' " Albertine remem
bered.
Several friends recalled how eas
ily their friendship with Francesca
Beard grew.
"It seemed to me we were al
ready best friends that first week
end," Shaftel said. "Frankie taught
me a lot about friendship and how
much we can learn from each
other."
Dormmate Rachel Mutton
praised Beard's ability to be open
with emotions.
"Frankie was one of the people
around here I felt comfortable
being vulnerable around," she said.
"Frankie took really good care of
me — she was always concerned
with what I was doing and how I
was doing."
Dubreuil said the two used to
talk every night, comparing notes
on the day and telling stories from
before they met. One time, she said,
they decided they didn't know each
other well enough and met at the
Coffee I louse to talk, soon discover
ing that they had been closer than
they imagined.
"She loved to look forward,"
Dubreuil said, "and we had a sense,
I think, that we were together
where and when it was most impor
tant to be."
In lieu of flowers, the family has
asked that donations be made to
