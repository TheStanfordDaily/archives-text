## Perceived as the problem 
### 
Though cornel west was
not the first to ask it, it was the
first time I'd heard the question
posed toward blacks: "What does it feel
like to be a problem?" When he said
that, I laughed, because for me it was
almost comical that such a concise
characterization could so accurately
describe situations I had encountered
all of my life. And it did. West
explained that blacks are not perceived
as people with problems but as a prob
lem.
From a personal perspective, being a
problem has led to many annoying,
frustrating and maddening incidents
in my life. West mentioned that blacks,
often the lone or sole representative of
their culture in a group, are often
asked to speak for all blacks in refer
ence to a particular issue. "So, what do
blacks think about 'X'?" This has hap
pened to me, and I always point out
what my particular view is, and then, if
I feel I have enough information to
reliably report on what other blacks
think, also give those views, still with
the caveat that I don't know all African
Americans, or even a significant por
tion.
Shopping can be an ordeal for black
people. I don't mean fighting crowds of
other shoppers, standing in long lines
and waiting for those in front of you
who went through the 9-items-or-less
line with 20 items. I mean not getting

service at all, while others around you
are served, having your signature
checked when others' are not, being
followed around by security guards,
being required to have a ticket for the
number of items you take into the
dressing room when no one else does
and other things like this.
These things happen to people I
know. A friend of mine went to buy a
ring for her mother's birthday. In New
York, many stores keep their doors
locked all the time and buzz customers
in when they see them at the door. My
friend was at the door of a store run in
this manner and the proprietor would
not let her in. In fact, he wouldn't even
let anyone out until she walked away
from the window.
When I lived in Pennsylvania, my
boyfriend and I would have an incident
with the police on a fairly regular
basis, considering that we are not crim
inals. We were followed when they
spotted our cars, and they would stay
behind us literally until we turned into
our driveway. One time a police car fol
lowed me for two miles. When I arrived
home, I put my head on the steering
wheel and cried, my anger and frustra
tion were so great. On several occa
sions when my friends came to visit,
they were stopped and questioned —
not for a traffic violation, but just to
find out "where they were going".
And there have been other things. I

have had little old ladies clutch their
purses passing me on the street. People
have locked their car doors as I pulled up
in my car or walked by. And on and on.
Any black person can tell you many sto
ries like that, or even worse. And the real
ly sad part is I've been lucky. I haven't
been injured or jailed, nor have any of my
family or friends. But it happens.
There are various reactions to these
events, ranging from blissful ignorance
to blistering defensiveness. In igno
rance, one convinces oneself this sort
of thing happens to everyone, in spite
of evidence to the contrary. In defen
siveness, one belligerently assaults
anyone who looks at you funny. An
acquaintance of mine once bowled over
a woman standing in her way as she
tried to go through a door, got outside
and said, "Did you see that woman?
She didn't even get out of my way."
So when West said black people were
a problem, I laughed because I under
stood. I understood the problem was
not me, but the perception others had
of me and that which I had of myself. I
had learned a while ago that my percep
tion of me didn't have to be their per
ception of me. I figured out the problem
is theirs, not mine. And I could laugh.
