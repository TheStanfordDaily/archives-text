# Allison Amend: The better part of valor
## Taking issue with problems, blame and honesty 
### 
ISSUES. EVERYONE'S GOT 'em.
Issues with food, issues with poli
tics, issues with other people. 1 can
take issue with you, I can bring an issue
to a head, I can buy an issue, I could
even issue you a ticket if I had the prop
er authority.
But what are issues? If you strip the
word down, determine what we really
mean, an issue is a problem. But what's
the problem with the word problem?
If you have intimacy issues, or alco
hol issues, the truth is that you have a
problem with intimacy or alcohol. Web
ster defines a problem as "a question or
situation that presents uncertainty, per
plexity or difficulty ... A source of trou
ble or annoyance." A problem is defined
by its precarious state between the
action that causes uncertainty and its
resolution. A problem is forever; once
it's solved, it ceases to be a problem.
An issue, on the other hand, he calls
"an act or instance of flowing, passing
or giving out. . . something produced . .
. the result of an action ... a point of
discussion . . . an outlet." Wow, an

issue is all that? The difference, then, is
that an issue has an ontology of its
own. That is to say that an issue
requires the agency of an act or
instance, whereas a problem has ori
gins as hazy as a morning by the bay.
"Issue" seems to be an end in itself.
The flowing, outlet imagery recalls a
dam, a wealth of emotions that are set
loose by the issue in a tirade leaving the
issuer spent and pleasantly empty.
Where have ulceric uncertainty and
painful perplexion gone?
Truth be told, we have replaced
"problem" with "issue" in our vocabu
lary. And issue is a euphemism. It
seems healthier to find the cause of our
malaise, identify it as an issue and
therefore assign it a cause and expiate
it through its appellation. Doesn't
"issue" provide a Freudian field-day of
realizing causes, ear-marking the indi
viduals or situations that are responsi
ble and effecting magical cures from
that knowledge? How can a word, a
name, perform that function, and why
is it comforting to name a disease, even

if we have no methods of treating it?
The issue (I'm using it here myself)
becomes symptomatic of a larger cul
tural phenomenon, that of blame. We
throw around blame like confetti on
New Year's, claiming our parents cul
pable, our genes, our friends, our
lovers, stress, jobs. By allowing our
selves to give the problem an agent, we
can remove the onus from ourselves.
Dealing with an issue is like dealing
with an old car whose insurance is
worth more than its chassis. You drive
into a collision, hoping to collect, pray
ing you won't get hurt in the process.
Honesty functions as the weapon, the
shield, as well as the flag under which
we march to battle. Honesty at all costs.
But honesty, while traditionally the
best policy, has also been given the epi
thet "brutal." Honesty can injure
(especially around draw time, trust
me). And yet honesty is what issues
forth when a problem becomes an
issue. The confronter is comforted by
the sensation that he she has "dealt
with the issue." But has he she

"resolved the problem?"
Conflict resolution requires the sat
isfied acquiescence of both parties
involved, whereas issues demand only
the release of pressure from one side.
The river only flows one way. An issue
is selfish, a problem is shared.
It's easy to see why we've taken to
calling a problem an issue these days. A
problem is so superficial, so mental. It's
uncertainty and discomfort, annoy
ance. An issue, even in its vague defini
tion, seems tied to the synthesis
between mind and body. It's visceral,
corporeal, pervasive. We think a prob
lem is weakness, mental laziness, intel
lectual inflation, but an issue is deep
rooted, interior and personal. We'll
excuse someone's issues, but sneer at
their problems.
This discrimination against prob
lems is also due to their confinement to
the realm of personal dialogue. A prob
lem begs resolution; you think about it,
you solve your own spiritual discomfort.
An issue, on the other hand, is defined
by action. You find the person or people

who are the source of your anxiety and
you vent. And this venting is taking
place entirely too often and is offered as
an excuse for impolite behavior.
There is often a fine line between
honesty and rudeness, and issues are
served up as the reason behind its blur
ring. I've heard myself explain away
blasting tirades with "weli, you know,
he has issues." We all nod knowingly.
Everyone has problems, but unvented
issues arc inexcusable in our society:
"She hasn't dealt with that issue."
It becomes, of course, an issue of
personal responsibility, for aren't
"issue-probs" (if I may coin the term)
yours, first of all? We need to use good
judgment, then, in finding the proper
balance between healing our own
uncertainty and blowing our tops. We
must search for the resolution to the
situation before digging for its cause,
and then empty ourselves of it slowly,
peacefully.
