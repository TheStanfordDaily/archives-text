# Overhauling the ASSU Constitution: Constitution '96
## We need a major reform 
### Michael Slemmer 
THE COUNCIL OF Presidents structure is not
what the authors of our ASSU Constitution
originally intended. It does not promote
accountability. It does not encourage responsibility.
It does not create diversity. It does not promote
leadership. It does not encourage hard work. It does
not work.
This mechanism was stumbled upon by a small
group of students less interested in getting things done
than they were in getting elected. In 1969, students
overwhelmingly approved a new constitution for the
ASSU — one which mandated a single president and
shrank the ASSU Senate from 100 to 40 members.
But in 1970, four students found a flaw in that
constitution. It did not explicitly prohibit a presiden
tial candidate from running with three vice-presi
dential candidates. With twice as many people run
ning together, they reasoned, more students would
know individual members of the slate and they
would be elected more easily.

They were right.
The"Council of Presidents"
slate swept into office, and in
1978, a special election was called
to write the COP structure into
our constitution..
Since then, the ASSU has
sunk into a morass of bureaucra
cy and political bickering. Ten
years ago, the University took
the Coffee House away from
ASSU because your leaders
bankrupted it. Five years ago,

students became so disgusted with the ASSU that
we elected a COP slate called "I Prefer Not To Have
a COP." This year, University President Gerhard
Casper told the ASSU Senate point blank that he
does not consider the ASSU to be a legitimate repre
sentative of the students. This month, ASSU leaders
had so much trouble administering their own elec
tion that they almost had to cancel it.
Clearly Stanford students are capable of solving
every one these problems. The problem with the
ASSU is not the people but the structure.
Last month, by a nearly unanimous vote, the
ASSU Senate approved legislation which will address
these structural problems. Constitution '96 marks
the first time in 25 years that students will have a
chance to vote on serious reforms like a single presi
dent, a smaller ASSU Senate and a judicial branch.
Why does t he ASSU take no decisive action on the
quality of food service, the post office and other cam
pus issues requiring student leadership? How did
the University pass a new restrictive grading policy
without so much as a peep from ASSU leaders? Why
has campus activism at Stanford all but died in the

last 10 years?
We have no leaders.
Constitution '96 returns
the ASSU to the single-pres
ident structure which the
authors of our current con
stitution originally intend
ed. This structure gives stu
dents a clear leader who is in
charge of representing them
to the University.

Opponents of the single president argue that it
eliminates the diversity and consensus-building
found in the COP. They argue that a single presi
dent would hold too much power.
This is empirically and patently false. It is the leg
islature's job to ensure diversity of viewpoints and
the executive's job to execute the will of the legisla
ture. What use is all the diversity in the world if
there is nobody to fulfill this essential executive role?
In fact, Constitution '96 actually increases diversi
ty of voices within the ASSU Senate. Currently, the
l 3__ • i.. r nrv ±: J nn

body consists of 20 voting and 20
non-voting senators. Under Con
stitution '96, the number of voting
senators would be increased to 30,
while eliminating non-voting sen
ators. After aU, what is thy point
of electing senators only to inform
them that they have no vote?
Constitution '96 maintains for
the single president the same
executive powers that the COP
now enjoys. If a single president
were too powerful, why then does

nearly every other university student government in
the nation use that structure?
To further protect students, Constitution '96
includes a Constitutional Council charged with
ensuring ASSU officers act within the constitution
— a provision which has enjoyed wide support
across campus for years.
Constitution '96 has been in the works for more
than a year now. Since 1 wrote the initial draft last
year, we have made more than 100 changes to the
text — some suggested by ASSU leaders, others by
ordinary students like you and me. More informa
tion can be found at http://c96.stanfbrd.edu.
The ASSU Senate passed Constitution '96 with
only one dissenting vote, 1,000 students signed pet i
tions to put it on the ballot and several major stu
dent groups and publications have voiced their sup
port for its provisions.
Now it's your turn.
Vote yes on Constitution '96.
