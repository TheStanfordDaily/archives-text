# It’s simply a bad proposal

THERE ARE TWO reasons to re-write a
constitution: to make a better structure, or
to make a better document. Constitution
'96 fails at both.
Constitution '96 was written by one student.
It represents Mike Slemmer's beliefs, opinions
and biases, but ignores the other 14,000 of us.
True, he asked for input post facto. But even
after that, he never really changed anything.
How can you improve the ASSU without talk
ing to its members? How can you increase gradu
ate student involvement when you never bother
to talk to graduate students? How can you
improve the special-fee process without talking
to student group treasurers? How can you
improve the nominations commission without
talking to its past chairs and members?
Only by involving a large and diverse group of
people from the outset can we create a constitu
tion that represents us all and that has any hope

of improving the ASSU.
One mind, one set of experi
ences, one set of beliefs can
never represent the diversity of
Stanford students. Proponents
cluun that, the ASSU Senate
endorsed Constitution '96
when it voted to put it on the
ballot. But, in truth, the debate
focused on whether students
should have the chance to
choose what they wanted, not
on whether Constitution '96

was a good idea or a good document.
This is not just a theoretical debate about
authorship and representation. Constitution '96
is riddled with shortcomings and mistakes.
The new single president is a dictator in
sheep's clothing. This one person would be able
to veto the actions of the 30-member senate. He
could "assign tasks" to senators. He would have
to approve the student representatives appointed
to University committees. He would appoint peo
ple to the new constitutional council — an ASSU
supreme court. All of the decision making and
power would be vested ultimately in one student.
Constitution '96 pretends to make the ASSU
more open, but simultaneously allows the senate
and the executive committee to close their meet
ings to students.
It institutionalizes an ASSU insider's club.
Picture this: You elect a senate by a democratic
process. Then, you undermine the election by
allowing the senate to expel its own members.
Finally, you undermine elected representation by
allowing the senate to select non-elected students

Council of Article IV violates the
"Rights of the Accused" in Arti
cle I. The author misworded the
section on fee refund buffers,
mistakenly preventing student
groups from accessing their
refund safety net. The entire spe
cial fee system and the right to a
fee refund depend on this buffer.

I'm sure that Mike Slemmer did not intend to
make these mistakes. But we are not voting on
his intent. We are voting on a constitution.
Constitution '96 was written in response to a
sense that the ASSU needs to be reformed.
Everyone agrees that reform needs to take place.
The question is how should we go about it.
Should it entail a public process that involves the
entire student body? Or should a single student
write it in privacy and secrecy without consulting
any of his fellow students?
Change for the sake of change is fun. But once
change is made, we're stuck with it for a long
time. And a few years down the road, we'll be ask
ing ourselves what process was used to write this
constitution anyway. If you believe there is any
student who can represent every experience, per
spective and belief of every Stanford student,
support it. But if you believe in your own voice,
vote no on Constitution '96.
