## Women head to 'Zona for key Pac-10 clashes 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
After a successful sweep of
USC and UCLA in Los Angeles,
the No. 2 Stanford women's ten
nis squad hits the road again this
weekend, this time to Arizona to
face the No. 4 Wildcats and the
No. 29 Sun Devils.
Without a blemish in its con
ference schedule as of yet, the
Cardinal (17-1 overall, 5-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion) may face its toughest Pac
-10 test of the season: the Wild
cats (17-2, 6-1) in Tucson on Sat
urday.
After years of relative obscuri
ty in the Pac-10 behind Stanford,
California and UCLA, Arizona
has found its way into the upper
echelon of the conference this
season. Ranked fourth in the
country, the Wildcats are cur
rently one game behind Stanford
in the race for the conference
crown and boast of victories over
Cal, UCLA and Tennessee.
"I think (they) realize, 'We
may be the University of Ari
zona, but we're better than some
of these teams," said Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan. "
'OK, so we've never beaten them

but, we are better than them,
clearly.' So then they go out and
they do it."
However, the only two losses
in an otherwise breakthrough
season for the Arizona program
have come at the hands of the
Cardinal. In February, Stanford
downed the Wildcats 6-3 at home
and less than one week later, de
feated them again at the Nation
al Team Indoor Championships
in an extremely tight 5-4 match.
Since that loss, Arizona has
strung together eight consecu
tive wins. The Cardinal has also
won eight straight since losing to
Florida in the Finals of the same
tournament.
"One of the reasons that I'm
confident is that we've been test
ed fairly well in the last couple of
weeks, and we've come through,"
Brennan said. "And we've had
good practices. So I feel like we
are hitting on all eight cylin
ders."
Sophomore Vicky Maes leads
the charge for Arizona, playing
in the top singles spot all season
long and posting an 18-1 dual
match record. Maes is the top
rated singles player in college
tennis, and despite her team's
struggles against the Cardinal,
Maes is 2-0 against sophomore
Ania Bleszynski in dual-match

play.
"Ania is going to have her
hands full with Maes," Brennan
said. "Maes has beaten her worse
than anybody else in the country
has beaten her. Maes just tor
mented her."
Yet Bleszynski (14-4) is play
ing the best tennis of her sopho

more season after beating de
fending NCAA singles champion
Keri Phebus last weekend in a
three-set comeback, and her
strengths may cause trouble for
Maes.
"Now that Ania is playing well
though, I think she can beat Maes
more easily than she can beat a
player like Phebus," Brennan
said. "They way to answer Maes's
game is with pure power. That's
what Ania has to do and that is
what she has been doing lately,
stepping up and really hitting the
ball hard. That will take Maes's
game away."
History is also on the side of
the Cardinal as Arizona has yet
to beat Stanford in this decade
and has yet to win a Pac-10 title.
The Cardinal is vying for its
ninth straight championship.
On the other hand, Arizona
State (9-8, 0-7), today's oppo
nent, has struggled this season,
especially in the Pac-10 Confer
ence. The Sun Devils have yet to
win a match in the conference,
and the prospect of grabbing one
seems dim with their remaining
matches coming against Stan
ford, Cal and Arizona.
Stanford defeated Arizona State
handily at home in February, run
ningaway with a 7-1 triumph.
The Sun Devils' problems may
beat the top of their lineup, where
Reka Cserenyes and Stephanie
Lansdorp are just a combined 19-
15 in the Nos. 1 and 2 positions.
Comparatively, Bleszynski and
Cardinal junior Katie Schlukebir
are 27-8 for Stanford.
The Sun Devils are more com
petitive at home, however, post
ing a 9-3 record.
