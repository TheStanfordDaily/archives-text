## Women head to 'Zona for key Pac-10 clashes 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
After a successful sweep of
USC and UCLA in Los Angeles,
the No. 2 Stanford women's ten
nis squad hits the road again this
weekend, this time to Arizona to
face the No. 4 Wildcats and the
No. 29 Sun Devils.
Without a blemish in its con
ference schedule as of yet, the
Cardinal (17-1 overall, 5-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion) may face its toughest Pac
-10 test of the season: the Wild
cats (17-2, 6-1) in Tucson on Sat
urday.
After years of relative obscuri
ty in the Pac-10 behind Stanford,
California and UCLA, Arizona
has found its way into the upper
echelon of the conference this
season. Ranked fourth in the
country, the Wildcats are cur
rently one game behind Stanford
in the race for the conference
crown and boast of victories over
Cal, UCLA and Tennessee.
"I think (they) realize, 'We
may be the University of Ari
zona, but we're better than some
of these teams," said Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan. "
'OK, so we've never beaten them

but, we are better than them,
clearly.' So then they go out and
they do it."
However, the only two losses
in an otherwise breakthrough
season for the Arizona program
have come at the hands of the
Cardinal. In February, Stanford
downed the Wildcats 6-3 at home
and less than one week later, de
feated them again at the Nation
al Team Indoor Championships
in an extremely tight 5-4 match.
Since that loss, Arizona has
strung together eight consecu
tive wins. The Cardinal has also
won eight straight since losing to
Florida in the Finals of the same
tournament.
"One of the reasons that I'm
confident is that we've been test
ed fairly well in the last couple of
weeks, and we've come through,"
Brennan said. "And we've had
good practices. So I feel like we
are hitting on all eight cylin
ders."
Sophomore Vicky Maes leads
the charge for Arizona, playing
in the top singles spot all season
long and posting an 18-1 dual
match record. Maes is the top
rated singles player in college
