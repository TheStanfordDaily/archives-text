# Volleyball to tangle with Aztecs, Tritons
## 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
The sixth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team concludes the
1996 regular season with two
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
home matches this weekend. Pacif
ic Division cellar-dweller UC-San
Diego will square ofT against the
Cardinal tonight, followed by a 3:00
p.m. showdown with San Diego
State on Saturday.
With a 10-7 league record, the
Cardinal has already clinched a spot
in the league's postseason tourna
ment | the top four teams in each di
vision have qualified|. All Stanford
needs to do is sweep this weekend in
order to maintain its hold of third
place in the division, ensuring itself
of a higher seed. Pacific, the squad
the Cardinal is competing with for
third place, will be facing the same
opponents.
"We'd like to finish as high as we
can," said Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves. "These will be two
more matches to test ourselves."
If Stanford's earlier meetings
with the Tritons and Aztecs are any
indication, the San Diego schools
will be welcome opponents after last
weekend's Hawaii debacle. Back on
Feb. 2, the Cardinal polished off the
SDSU in four games with junior op
posite Matt Fuerbringer leading the
way with 24 kills. The following
evening, Stanford swept UC-San
Diego as the squad hit consistently
while making few mistakes.
Since then, UCSD's season has
been a highway to disaster, as the
Tritons come into Burnham Pavil
ion as the only winless team in the
MPSF. Senior opposite Tom Black,
who has emerged as the offensive
leader for the Tritons, has been av

eraging nearly seven kills per game
in league play.
San Diego State has been able to
stay out of last place thanks to the
Tritons. However, with only a 4-13
league record, the Aztecs are also
playing out the string. San Diego
State is led by senior opposite Lars
Winter. The 6-foot-7 Winter put
down 24 kills in the last meeting
versus the Cardinal and is presently
hitting .390 in league play. Winter Ls
also ranked sixth nationally in kills
average at 6.24.
Stanford has spent recent prac
tices trying to recover from a poor
showing in Honolulu. "We've
looked OK," Nieves said. "Our con
centration and effort has been pret
ty good. I think we also benefited
from a day off [the team did not
practice on Tuesday]."
The Cardinal also welcomed the
return of junior middle blocker
Brian Moore from a foot injury. Al
though he still feels discomfort,
Moore has been able to complete
workouts with his teammates.
"We'll see how he does [Thurs
day]. He makes us so much better,"
Nieves said. "We'd like him to be
healthy enough. We still don't
know." Sophomore swing hitter
Devin Poolman, who suffered a
sprained ankle in Saturday's match
against Hawaii, is questionable for
this weekend as well.
With the season winding down,
all that is left for the Cardinal is to
maintain their third place standing
and prepare for a likely first round
matchup against UC-Santa Bar
bara in the MPSF tournament.
"We have a great opportunity to
get some good momentum going
into the playoffs," Nieves said.
"We're definitely going for the win
and third place."
