# Cardinal hosts final match of year
## Salzenstein, Thomas and Becker to end career on the Farm 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
This weekend marks the final time Stanford
fans will be able to see the Cardinal men (17-2, 5-1
in the Pacific 10 Southern Division) in action at
home. Seniors Jeff Salzenstein, Jim Thomas and
Ricky Becker will be competing on the courts of the
Stanford Tennis Stadium for the final time in their
collegiate careers. All three want to end on a high
note with two big wins over Six-Pac rivals Arizona
and Arizona State.
If all goes according to plan, there should be lit
tle to spoil the seniors' going-out party. Stanford
traveled to the land of desert and cacti over spring
break and whipped Arizona and ASU by scores of 7-
0 and 5-2, respectively.
While the second-ranked Cardinal boasts supe
rior talent in comparison to both the Wildcats and
the Sun Devils, the Arizona schools nevertheless
pose a significant threat. Both teams are ranked in
the top 40 (Arizona is No. 25, ASU is No. 38), and
both have beaten No. 15 California, a team which,
on Tuesday, Stanford defeated in a very close 5-2
match.
Head coach Dick Gould stressed the need for
focus during a possibly distracting final homes
tand. "These are not easy matches l'or us at all," he
said. "If we don't focus on the matter at hand, we
will lose. If we do concentrate, we will win."
But even Gould noted that these are not just two
more ordinary matches. "It's definitely special to
be playing in our last home matches," he said.
"This is the last time Ricky, Jim and Jeff are going
to play in 'their house.' Those guys have had quite
a run and each of them has really left a tremendous
mark on Stanford tennis. They're not the biggest
names ever to come through here, but they have
contributed to the tradition and heritage as much
as anyone."
Indeed, the trio of seniors have left an impres
sive mark by any standards. During their four
years as Cardinal netters, Stanford has accumulat
ed an astounding 89-10 record for a remarkable
.899 winning percentage. Over that stretch,
Salzenstein, Thomas and Becker, for their part,
have put up a combined 187-35 record in dual

mutch competition for a lofty .842
winning percentage.
"It has certainly been a great
four years," said Salzenstein, who
has won 120 matches in the Car
dinal uniform. "This is the elite
college tennis program in the
country. We've got the best fans
anywhere, and I've really appreci
ated playing in front of them in
the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Playing with Jim and Ricky at
Stanford for these four years has
been really special. I've enjoyed it,
and I'm going to miss it a lot."
In some ways it has been a sub

par year for Salzenstein, the
team's captain. After going 22-4
at first singles last year, his 10-7
mark thus far this season is disap
pointing. However, the Cardinal
star has been suffering through a
number of nagging injuries, and
stresses that the most important
part of the season, the NCAA
championships, is yet to come.
Thomas, on the other hand, is
enjoying the finest year of his colle
giate career, playing as high as sec
ond singles and running off 14 con
secutive dual match victories to
start the season. The tall senior has
also been invaluable as a doubles
competitor. He and sophomore
teammate Paul Goldstein have
moved up to the No. 6 spot in the
rankings, and will likely ascend

even higher after defeating the No.
1 team from UCLA last weekend.
"My senior season has been a
good one, a nice way to finish off
my years here," he said. "It has
been a fun, quick four years at
Stanford. I've really loved playing
with Ricky and Jeff and all my
teammates, and it's kind of sad to
be playing in my last home match.
It doesn't really feel like an ending
quite yet, though. We've still got
over a month to go, and we've got a
lot of business to take care of."
And so while this weekend will
mark the poignant end of an era, it
is still a crucial weekend of tennis.
These seniors know what it takes to
win — each wears a 1995 National
Championship ring, and they know
t hat losing focus is not an option.
