## Salzenstein, Thomas and Becker to end career on the Farm 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
This weekend marks the final time Stanford
fans will be able to see the Cardinal men (17-2, 5-1
in the Pacific 10 Southern Division) in action at
home. Seniors Jeff Salzenstein, Jim Thomas and
Ricky Becker will be competing on the courts of the
Stanford Tennis Stadium for the final time in their
collegiate careers. All three want to end on a high
note with two big wins over Six-Pac rivals Arizona
and Arizona State.
If all goes according to plan, there should be lit
tle to spoil the seniors' going-out party. Stanford
traveled to the land of desert and cacti over spring
break and whipped Arizona and ASU by scores of 7-
0 and 5-2, respectively.
While the second-ranked Cardinal boasts supe
rior talent in comparison to both the Wildcats and
the Sun Devils, the Arizona schools nevertheless
pose a significant threat. Both teams are ranked in
the top 40 (Arizona is No. 25, ASU is No. 38), and
both have beaten No. 15 California, a team which,
on Tuesday, Stanford defeated in a very close 5-2
match.
Head coach Dick Gould stressed the need for
focus during a possibly distracting final homes
tand. "These are not easy matches l'or us at all," he
said. "If we don't focus on the matter at hand, we
will lose. If we do concentrate, we will win."
But even Gould noted that these are not just two
more ordinary matches. "It's definitely special to
be playing in our last home matches," he said.
"This is the last time Ricky, Jim and Jeff are going
to play in 'their house.' Those guys have had quite
a run and each of them has really left a tremendous
mark on Stanford tennis. They're not the biggest
names ever to come through here, but they have
contributed to the tradition and heritage as much
as anyone."
Indeed, the trio of seniors have left an impres
sive mark by any standards. During their four
years as Cardinal netters, Stanford has accumulat
ed an astounding 89-10 record for a remarkable
.899 winning percentage. Over that stretch,
Salzenstein, Thomas and Becker, for their part,
have put up a combined 187-35 record in dual
