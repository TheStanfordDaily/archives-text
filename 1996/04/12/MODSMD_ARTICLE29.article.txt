# Stanford sluggers look for revenge against USC
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
After this weekend, there will be
three more Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division series for the
Stanford baseball team. But the
Cardinal's hopes for a league title
may hinge on its performance in I xjs
Angeles beginning tonight, as the
squad takes on the University of
Southern California in a three
game set.
The fifth-ranked Trojans are
currently leading the Six-Pac with a
record of 14-4 and boast a 28-8-1
overall mark. USC is coming off a
weekend sweep of last-place Ari
zona, while No. 13 Stanford recent
ly took two of three from Arizona
State. The Cardinal (2.3-14, 10-8 in
the Six-Pac) suffered an 8-6 loss
Tuesday night against San Jose
State.
In addition to trying to pick up
ground on the conference front
runners, Stanford will be looking
for a little revenge against the Tro
jans this weekend. Earlier this year,
USC swept three games from the
Cardinal at "Sunken Diamond by
scores of 8-0,9-3 and 10-7.
Since that series, Stanford has
posted a 7-2 record against Six-Pac
