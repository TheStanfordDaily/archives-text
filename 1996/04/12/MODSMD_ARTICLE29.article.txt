## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
After this weekend, there will be
three more Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division series for the
Stanford baseball team. But the
Cardinal's hopes for a league title
may hinge on its performance in I xjs
Angeles beginning tonight, as the
squad takes on the University of
Southern California in a three
game set.
The fifth-ranked Trojans are
currently leading the Six-Pac with a
record of 14-4 and boast a 28-8-1
overall mark. USC is coming off a
weekend sweep of last-place Ari
zona, while No. 13 Stanford recent
ly took two of three from Arizona
State. The Cardinal (2.3-14, 10-8 in
the Six-Pac) suffered an 8-6 loss
Tuesday night against San Jose
State.
In addition to trying to pick up
ground on the conference front
runners, Stanford will be looking
for a little revenge against the Tro
jans this weekend. Earlier this year,
USC swept three games from the
Cardinal at "Sunken Diamond by
scores of 8-0,9-3 and 10-7.
Since that series, Stanford has
posted a 7-2 record against Six-Pac

"It was a wake-up call for us,"
Sullivan said. "At the time, we
weren't playing great, but getting
swept at borne was really a wake-up.
We realized we can't take things for
granted."
After the USC series, Sullivan
and his teammates had a weekend

"We took the two weeks to refo

said.
If Stanford is to challenge the
Trojans' hold on the top spot in the
league standings, both the pitching
and the offense must be more pro
ductive than they were in the first
meetings between the two rivals.
The last time the teams met,
Stanford starting pitchers were
touched up for 18 runs in 18 2/3 in

sophomore Kyle Peterson (5-4) has
won three consecutive starts while
