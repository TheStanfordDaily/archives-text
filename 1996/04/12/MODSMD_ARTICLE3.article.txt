# 'One' issue: COP slate wants single president
## 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Characterizing them
selves as a "figurehead" for
ASSU reform, members of
the"I Prefer to Have a Sin
gle President" slate for
Council of Presidents pro
pose to solve student dissat-

isfaction with the ASSU through structural
change.
The slate's members, freshmen Dave
Guendelman, Joe Pawson and Pete Vlastelica
and sophomore Steve Liu, are running on a

single-issue platform — "Constitution '96."
"Constitution '96" is a proposed amendment
to the ASSU Constitution which recently won
approval from the ASSU Senate for placement
on the spring general election ballot. The elec
tion will be held Wednesday and Thursday.
"Our crux is that we are trying to make the
ASSU a legitimate body," Guendelman said.
"Wp w?mt students to understand that they
have the power to change and do things."
Originally planning to run for the COP for
fun, the slate members said they decided to
endorse a single issue after talking to senators
and visiting the senate meeting where "Con
stitution '96" was placed on the spring ballot.

"We knew that a lot of people wanted to re
form the ASSU through a single president,
and we felt that this was the best way to ap
proach it," Pawson said.
"Constitution '96" would replace the exist
ing ASSU Constitution by replacing the cur
rent four-member COP with a single presi
dent, reducing the number of senators from
40 to 30 and creating a judicial branch of the
ASSU. Two-thirds of voters must approve the
bill in order for it to take effect.
Members of the slate said they believe a
single president is particularly necessary if re-

form to the ASSU is to be accom
plished.
"The fact that we have four
presidents is ridiculous," Guen
delman said. "We might as well
have four Gerhards."
The Stanford tradition of four
presidents is unwieldy, according
to the slate members.
"If our system works so well,
why hasn't it happened in other
universities?" Vlastelica said.
If the slate is elected and "Con
stitution '96" passes, members of
the slate plan to resign immedi
ately and call for a special election
to elect a single president.
In the event that the slate is
elected and "Constitution '96"
does not pass, members of the
slate plan to collect the 2,000 sig
natures necessary to hold a con
stitutional convention to write
the bill into ASSU Bylaws.
Members of the slate do not be
lieve their political inexperience
will hamper them in any way.
"It is not important to people
that we don't know about the
ASSU," Vlastelica said. "It is not
the elected officials but the sys
tem that is important, so it might
as well be us who is running."
The slate plans to formulate
an advisory council of important
ASSU leaders to help familiarize
them with the workings of the
senate.

"We believe that there are
enough people in the ASSU who
believe in what we are doing that
they would be happy to help us in
our effort," Vlastelica said.
No slate member expressed an

interest in becoming the single
president which the slate advo
cates.
"None of us wants to be the
elected official," Guendelman
said. "We are just instruments

for this change."
If elected to the COP, mem
bers of the slate will return their
salaries to the reserve fund of the
ASSU, according to slate mem
bers
