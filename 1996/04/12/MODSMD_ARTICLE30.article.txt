# Men's golf enters weekend tournament without Woods
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
For a team headed into battle without its
biggest gun, the Stanford men's golf squad is
amazingly optimist ic.
Riding liigh from a strong finish at USC
and a spectacular win in Santa Cruz over the
past two weeks, the 17th-ranked Cardinal
looks to continue on its tear minus Tiger
Woods in this weekend's U.S. Intercollegiate
hereon the Farm.
"It's really going to be a good test for our
consistency," said head coach Wally Good
win. "I'm really excited about tliis.
"We really whipped some of these teams
[at Pasa Tiempo], and it'd be great to dupli
cate that and really strengthen our position
as the postseason gets closer and closer."
Despite the team's surging momentum, it
faces an uphill battle without AU-Arnerican
Woods. The sophomore finds himself instead
in Augusta, Ga., competing in what is ar
guably the most revered event in golf, the
Masters. Woods, the top amateur in the na
tion, is making his second run at the green
jacket after impressing nearly everybody en
"route to a 4 lst-place finish last year.
"We're going to miss him," said senior
captain Jerry Chang. "We can count on Tiger
for at least a 69 or a 70 every round.
"It's hard to lose a guy who can give you
the type of consistent production that he

does. It's also very motivating, however, and
it gives us that little bit of an extra incentive
to really perform well. It'll give us a bit of an
edge."
The field, while not the most competitive
faced by the squad, holds several solid teams
and more importantly, a number of district
rivals.
"This tournament is very important for
really establishing ourselves in the district,"
Goodwin said. "Southern Cal and Pepper
dine are both teams that are going to come
hard at us and UCLA and Fresno State are
starting to regain their early season form too.
"Overall, it should be a great opportunity
for us to show everyone where we're at."
Chang and freshman Joel Kribel will lead
the Stanford charge in Woods' absence. Both
are coming off brilliant performances last
week, having finished fourth and second, re
spectively. The return of their sparkling
games was especially welcome after a bit of a
winter slump.
"Winter quarter is always hard for the
team," Chang said. "Academically, we try to
load up on units to free up spring a little and
that leaves us a lot less time to practice.
"Lately though, we've gotten to spend a
lot more time on the course and just have
fewer extraneous distractions in general and
I think that's really start ing to show through
in our play."
As for the rest of the team, Good
win will continue with junior Conrad
Ray and Eric Crum and add senior
David Garcia to fill the spot vacated
by Woods. Ray has settled down con
siderably after a rocky first half of
the season and begun to make a solid
contribution.
"Conrad is really coming
around," Chang said. "He's really
stuck it out and worked hard
through all this and now it's paying
off."
Crum makes only his second ap
pearance on the starting varsity
squad after an impressive debut last
weekend. Garcia rejoins the starters
after struggling in a handful of
events to start the second half of the
season.
"Your top guys always get all the
attent ion, hut when it comes down to
it, how the four and five guys play is
probably the most important thing,"
Chang said. "You're only as strongas
your weakest link.
"No one person can carry us.
We've got a great opportunity to gain
a little experience this weekend and
come together to really gain a sense
of beinira team "
