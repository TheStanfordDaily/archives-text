# Gymnasts head to Nebraska for regionals
## Squad to get one last chance to qualify for NCAA finals 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
It's do-or-die time for the Stanford men's gymnas
tics team this weekend at the NCAA West Regionals.
The Cardinal must place third or higher in order toto
advance to the NCAA finals to be held at Stanford April
24-27.
Six teams will compete at the NCAA West Regionals
— California, Oklahoma, Stanford, Nebraska, New
Mexico and BYU. These same teams met up last week
end in Santa Barbara for the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Championships and placed in that same
order. Stanford finished third, edging Nebraska by .54,
not exactly the most comfortable of leads. Head coach
Sadao Hamada had commented that Nebraska's per
formances did not live up to his expectations.
"I thought they were a much better team," he said.
Nebraska probably realizes the weakness of its perfor
mance last week, and will not take getting edged out by
Stanford again lightly.
The final scoring for MPSFs was California
(228.97), Oklahoma (226.84), Stanford (224.75), Ne
braska (224.21), New Mexico (222.53) and BYU
(218.85). Unfortunately, as with other sports, the over
all performance of a team is subject to numerous vari
ables, not the least of which is luck.
Junior lan Bachrach attributed his consistently
strong performances to luck, saying that "a lot of it just
depends on luck and how the person before you did."
He cited the example of a strong lead performance by
freshman Scott Finkelstein in the high bar, which may
have contributed to the stellar performances of senior
Peter Hegi and junior Keith Wiley.
