# Gymnasts head to Nebraska for regionals
## Squad to get one last chance to qualify for NCAA finals 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
It's do-or-die time for the Stanford men's gymnas
tics team this weekend at the NCAA West Regionals.
The Cardinal must place third or higher in order toto
advance to the NCAA finals to be held at Stanford April
24-27.
Six teams will compete at the NCAA West Regionals
— California, Oklahoma, Stanford, Nebraska, New
Mexico and BYU. These same teams met up last week
end in Santa Barbara for the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Championships and placed in that same
order. Stanford finished third, edging Nebraska by .54,
not exactly the most comfortable of leads. Head coach
Sadao Hamada had commented that Nebraska's per
formances did not live up to his expectations.
"I thought they were a much better team," he said.
Nebraska probably realizes the weakness of its perfor
mance last week, and will not take getting edged out by
Stanford again lightly.
The final scoring for MPSFs was California
(228.97), Oklahoma (226.84), Stanford (224.75), Ne
braska (224.21), New Mexico (222.53) and BYU
(218.85). Unfortunately, as with other sports, the over
all performance of a team is subject to numerous vari
ables, not the least of which is luck.
Junior lan Bachrach attributed his consistently
strong performances to luck, saying that "a lot of it just
depends on luck and how the person before you did."
He cited the example of a strong lead performance by
freshman Scott Finkelstein in the high bar, which may
have contributed to the stellar performances of senior
Peter Hegi and junior Keith Wiley.

the advantage (if competing in its

enjoy only if it advances to the NCAA
championships
Stanford currently holds the
NCAA title, but has struggled to
maintain that level of excellence all
year due to the loss of sophomore
Tim Dalrymple. Dalryinple injured
his neck early on in the season and
redshirted this year.
In preparation for the upcoming
competition, the Cardinal has prac
ticed twice a day and is hoping to
bring in at least a third place finish.
The gymnasts are optimistic
about their chances for advancing to
the championships, although
Bachrach admitted to being a bit
scared.
"I'm scared to death, but we don't
think like that," he said. I le went on
to explain that the team had worked
hard all year in preparation for the
final stretch.
