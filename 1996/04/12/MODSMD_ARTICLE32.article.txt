# Stanley to leave Farm to coach Cal women
## 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
It just became a lot tougher to
hate Cal — at least in women's bas
ketball.
Stanford co-head coach Mari
anne Stanley was named Cal's first
new head coach in 17 years by Cali
fornia athletic director John Kass
er. The position at Cal is Stanley's
fifth as a head coach.
"We are committed to having
one of the top women's basketball
programs out there, and we be
lieve we have found the best coach
available," Kasser said.
Stanley was hired as co-head
coach at Stanford on May 5 of last
year after head coach Tara Van-
Derveer announced intentions to
head the U.S. Senior Women's
National Team, requiring her to
take a one-year leave of absence.
Stanley and former associate head
coach Amy Tucker guided the
Cardinal to its fifth Final Four

berth and a school-record 23-
game win streak, earning UPI
Coaches of the Year honors.
While Tucker indisputably ran
the show, Stanley provided much
needed experience from the bench
with the new coaching staff. She
concentrated mostly on defense,
and Stanford allowed 59.97 points
per game this season, its fewest
since the 1978-79 season. During
that year, Stanley won the first of
three national championships at
Old Dominion, where she is en
shrined in t he (MM' Hall of Fame.
Stanley does not inherit an im
mediate Final Four-caliber team
at Cal. The Golden Hears suffered
their worst season ever last year
at 7-20 overall and a cellar
dwelling 3-15 in the Pacific 10
Conference. Gooch Foster, the
former dean of Pac-10 coaches, re
signed after the season, opening
the door for Stanley, whose con
tract at Stanford expires at the
end of the month.
