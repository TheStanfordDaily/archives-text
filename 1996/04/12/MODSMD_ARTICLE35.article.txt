# Midnight madness

### 
Strange creatures come out at night < )nce a
year, when the children aiv nestled all snug
in their bods, these creatures sneak into
White Plaza and make their presence known.
Thev crawl out of the steam tunnels and gather
at the campus center. They are strange creatures,
with intense expressions and a -mall cour-eload.
They are hopeful members of the ASSI
As visions of sugar plums danced in the heads
of Stanford students Tuesday night, few realized
the makeover White Plaza would have by morn
ing. ASSI' bylaws state that the official campaign
for the 199f> election began Wednesday So. when
the clocks hit midnight, the mass fliering, ban
nering and staking of campus was to begin.
Naturally. I was curious A coordinated ASSI
event? This I had to see 1 showed up at about
11 :.'{<) P.M. Tuesday and by the time I arrived, the
crowds around the bandshell (those white pipes•
were huge When did all those people get there'.'
"We've been here about an hour Since about
10:30. said one group of dedicated guy.- Why so
early'* "(iotta get the best spot on the bandshell
I looked around in awe Like soldier- reach lot
war. small battalions of senate hopefuls, COP
slates, cla.-.- presidents and special-fee requestors
were reviewing their troop positioning and com
bat strategies for the upcoming midnight battle.
They had been preparing for this night for quite
some time.
"OK, team, huddle up!" said a guy with a clip
board. Curious. I huddled up. too. "Flier regula
tions. . ." he began. Regulations'.' "All right even
body: No trees, no light poles. No bollards, no
paved surfaces. No windows, no doors . .
"No shoes, no service" I piped in. Ha. ha? 1
heard a scream.
"The duct tape! Where's the duct tape? Did
somebody take our duct tape?!! Dammit!" She
ran off in search of reinforcements.
Midnight was approaching and tension was

building. I walked up to some guys guarding the
good spots on the bandshell.
"The bandshell is the prime location by far.
especially along the top part there He pointed.
"Hut, of course, you have to follow the flier eti
quette " Etiquette? "Well, you can't overlap
someone else's flier And if an event hasn't gone
up yet. you can't move their flier" So much to
think about "This is the best -pot Next best is
probably Old I nion Then I residder maybe'.'"
"No. I residder is off-limit-'" a voice called out
from the darkness I lie staircase is allocated by
OSA. And definitely not the Quad."
Mas.- terror. "Not the Quad! they screamed
"The first thing they told u- was: 'No Quad!'
Were kiosks OK? "Yeah, but you need to use
those really thick staples
Stakes'' "Not ver\ cost -effect ive for a senator
And no one could decide if bat brooms were fair
game or not.
I glanced at my watch It was almost midnight,
the moment of truth Who's watch was "oflicial"?
Wa.- there going to be an enormous countdown?
Was I )ick < 'lark going to show up with ;i foghorn
singing "Auld Lang Syne'"' I looked up into the
skv, half-expecting to -ee the Bat Signal there.
The anticipation was nerve-wracking. Heads
of sweat formed on many a-brow. Hearts beat
faster with anticipation Perfect and utter silence.
Suddenly, a chime was heard in the distance,
l he clock tower's music filled the air. The "offi
cial timekeeper had spoken. The race was on.
Adrenaline shot through bloodstreams and limbs
were torn from innocent bodies. A male voice
screamed, "Go! Go! Go!"
I think the voice was mine.
Large men vaulted themselves up onto the
white pipes like infantry scaling an enemy barri
cade. Soldiers darted along the sides of Old
I nion. catapulting banners off the edge and teth
ering with rapidity, efficiency and massive

amounts of duct tap'. The staple units flanked
p;ist the ( law with fliers in tow, hittingthe kiosks
with fierce accuracy and precision. Camouflaged
paratroopers fell from the sky with nylon rope
and banners under their arms shouting orders
across the radio lines "Not the Quad! 1 repeat,
not the Quad!!" Gunfire echoed in the distance.
A cop m a little bitty Daihatsu skittered by.
1 looked up and some of these die-hards were
dangling almost 15 feet in the air reaching for
ropes to straighten their banners. Cries for duct
tape lit up White Pkiza like bursts of machine gun
fire 1 heard a voice call out from the mayhem.
"Hey you! I whirled around. I'he voice was
aimed at me. "Do you think you could help'.'"
Could I help? What about a reporter's journal
istic integrity'.' What about .just reporting the
news'. 1 Reporters shouldn't get involved, right?
Moments later, I was clinging haphazardly to
the side rungs with rivkless abandon. Fear was
left wallowing on the pavement 10 feet below.
The mission was simple: Fasten the banner to
withstand rain, wind, hail and sleet. The execu
tion was treacherous: Twice I lost my footing and
it took 10 minutes to get the corners tied to the
cold and dirty metal 12 feet off the ground.
When all was said and done. I leapt down into
the safety of the bushes below. White Plaza cer
tainly looked different. Fliers covered every imag
inable. allowable surface and enough stakes stood
in the grass that it looked like a graveyard. For all
those whiny Stanford students who claim that the
ASSU never gets anything done, take a look at the
remains of last Tuesday night's war. While its
record on student issues may be shaky, no one can
doubt that the ASS Is effectiveness in fliering
White Pla/a is anything less than exceptional.
And, heck, they even got me involved. They've
got to be doing something right.
