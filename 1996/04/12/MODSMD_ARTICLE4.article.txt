Ira Friedman, director of Cowell Student
Health Center, joined a handful of students
at the Women's Center last night for a town
hall meeting to discuss issues relating to les
bian, gay and bisexual students and the ser
vice they receive at Cowell.
Students said they were most concerned
with the quality and sensitivity of the Cow
ell staff regarding lesbian, gay and bisexual
patients. They voiced such concerns as sen
sitivity training and Cowell staff members'
comfort level with lesbian, gay and bisexual
patients.
"We do a lot of internal education at Cow
ell to sensitize [the staff] to lesbian, gay and
bisexual issues," Friedman said. "The staff
also goes to continuing education programs
outside of Cowell dealing with anything
from the latest in HIV testing to cervical
cancer and Pap smear developments."
Sara Sperling, co-director of the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center,
asked if AIDS testing is available at Cowell.
Friedman responded that two kinds of free
anonymous testing are available: One in
which only the patient receives the results,
and one in which another student counselor
sees the results, but under a pseudonym
chosen by the patient.
Students were also concerned about

what information related to sexual orienta
tion is included in Cowell records.
"The questions we ask deal specifically
with sexual behavior, and only when it is
relevant to the medical services being pro
vided," Friedman said. "There is a general
concern at Cowell about the issue of records
and how to best serve patients' needs. We
tend to minimize the amount that is on the
record regarding sexual orientation."
Friedman added that the issue is compli
cated because some students do not feel
their sexual orientation should be recorded,
while others "get tired of saying the same
thing every time they come in, which some
times leads to defensive interaction."
Friedman said he must also consider the
concerns of Cowell staff members, who may
feel such information is relevant.
When asked what lesbian, gay and bisex
ual students should do when they have com
plaints or suggestions, Friedman said they
should make an appointment with him or at
least drop a note in the Cowell comment
box.
"I answer everything that goes into that
box personally," Friedman said. "Give me
specifics and I will act on it."
CowelPs women's health questionnaire,
given to patients before a Pap smear exami
nation, was recently revised to include ques-
tions which could be answered
generally by both heterosexual
and homosexual women.
Friedman also mentioned a
new brochure detailing resources

available to lesbian, gay and bisex
ual students at Cowell. The
brochure will be available in Sep
tember, he said.
"My goal is to make Cowell a
service everyone can use and feel
comfortable using," Friedman
said. "To reach that goal, we need
student input, and this meeting is
part of that process."
