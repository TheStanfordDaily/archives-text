Stanford has higher full pro
fessor salaries than all but one
other comparable university in
the United States, according to a
new study.
The average salary for full pro
fessors at Stanford, not counting
Medical Center faculty, passed
the $100,000 mark for the first
time this year.
The American Association of
University Professors, in a survey
of 1,800 institutions nationwide
published in today's issue of The
Chronicle of Higher Education,
found that the average full profes
sor at Stanford earns $103,300 in
a nine-month work year.
Only Harvard University's av
erage full professor salary of
$ 107,000 is higher among univer
sities granting graduate and un
dergraduate degrees, the study
said. Medical school salaries were
not included in the study.
Rockefeller University in New

York, which grants only doctoral
degrees, led the country in aver
age full professor salaries with
$109,000. In institutions compa
rable to Stanford, the University
of North Dakota pays its profes
sors the least with an average of
$47,900.
When associate professors'
and assistant professors' salaries
are included, however, Harvard
and Stanford both have faculty
salaries around $88,400.
Stanford administrators at
tributed the high salaries to com

and the high cost of living in the
Bay Area.
"Stanford competes very hard
at the national and international
levels for the very best faculty in
the world," said Assoc. I'rovost
Kathy Gillam. In the Law and
Business schools, she said, "We
compete in the professional world
as well as the academic world."
