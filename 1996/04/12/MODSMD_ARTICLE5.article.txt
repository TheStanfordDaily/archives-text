# Stanford second in professor pay
## Full professors earn $103,300 
### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
Stanford has higher full pro
fessor salaries than all but one
other comparable university in
the United States, according to a
new study.
The average salary for full pro
fessors at Stanford, not counting
Medical Center faculty, passed
the $100,000 mark for the first
time this year.
The American Association of
University Professors, in a survey
of 1,800 institutions nationwide
published in today's issue of The
Chronicle of Higher Education,
found that the average full profes
sor at Stanford earns $103,300 in
a nine-month work year.
Only Harvard University's av
erage full professor salary of
$ 107,000 is higher among univer
sities granting graduate and un
dergraduate degrees, the study
said. Medical school salaries were
not included in the study.
Rockefeller University in New

York, which grants only doctoral
degrees, led the country in aver
age full professor salaries with
$109,000. In institutions compa
rable to Stanford, the University
of North Dakota pays its profes
sors the least with an average of
$47,900.
When associate professors'
and assistant professors' salaries
are included, however, Harvard
and Stanford both have faculty
salaries around $88,400.
Stanford administrators at
tributed the high salaries to com
petition among top universities
and the high cost of living in the
Bay Area.
"Stanford competes very hard
at the national and international
levels for the very best faculty in
the world," said Assoc. I'rovost
Kathy Gillam. In the Law and
Business schools, she said, "We
compete in the professional world
as well as the academic world."
Rounding out the top five for
schools comparable to Stanford
are Caltech — where the average
salary for full professors is
$103,100, only $200 less than
Stanford's average — followed by
Princeton University and Yale
University.
The average full professor's
salary nationwide was $73,610.
Private institutions are paying

their professors $88,050 this
year, the study said.
The average faculty raise last
year was around 3 percent, about
0.5 percentage points above the
inflation rate of 2.5 percent, the
study said. At Stanford, faculty
received an average pay increase
of 3.4 percent.
Last year, Stanford's full pro
fessors received an average salary
of $99,900.
The actual competition,
Gillam said, is on a departmental
level, not a university level. If in

dividual departments notice
their salaries are lagging behind
those at other institutions, de
partment heads will ask the
deans of the schools for more
money. Deans can forward the
requests to the provost, who
every year gives each school a
lump sum of money to be used for
raises, Gillam said.
The survey results will not af
fect University decisions, she said.
"We would not do anything in a
general basis based on an overall
figure," she said. "Competition is

discipline-based, not university
based."
In addition to the $3,400 in
crease in the average full profes
sor salary this year, the average
associate professor salary in
creased by $1,100 and average as
sistant professor compensation
rose by $ 1,300.
Nationally, female faculty are
still paid less on average than
male faculty, the study said, al
though the figures are much more
even at the associate and assis
tant professor levels.
