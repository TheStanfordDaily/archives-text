# Study finds male, female salaries equal
## Gender gap smaller in doctors' earnings

A new Stanford study shows
that the salary gap between male
and female physicians is narrow
ing, although there is still room for
improvement.
The study's author, Health Re
search and Policy Prof. Laurence
Baker, found that young male doc
tors earned 41 percent more than
their female counterparts in 1990.
However, when this statistic is ad
justed for certain key factors, there
is no disparity between male and fe
male salaries.
The study was published yester
day i n The New England Journal of
Medicine.
"The disparity in salaries
among young doctors can be ac
counted for by differences in hours
worked per week, specialty areas of
practice and practice setting,"
Baker said. "Male doctors report
working longer — 62 hours a week,
47 weeks a year — compared to fe
males, who worked 51 hours a
week, 46 weeks a year. Also, men
are more likely to own their prac

tice, which leads to higher incomes,
while women work more in hospi
tal and HMO environments."
"Men are also over-represented
in high-paying specialty fields such
as internal medicine, neurology,
cardiology. Women are more abun
dant in less highly paid fields such
as pediatrics and general medi
cine," he added.
Baker said he finds it promising
that the discrepancies in pay be
tween the genders can be account
ed for among younger physicians.
For this study, young physicians
were defined as those with less
than 10 years practice experience
and under age 45.
However, the data was not so
encouraging for older physicians,
who have practiced for more than
10 years. Older male physicians
earned 17 percent more than fe
males after all the same factors
were accounted for.
Baker started this research
while still a graduate student at
Princeton University. After discov
