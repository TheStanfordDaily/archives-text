# Study finds male, female salaries equal
## Gender gap smaller in doctors' earnings 
### Yvette Delahoussaye Contributing writer 
A new Stanford study shows
that the salary gap between male
and female physicians is narrow
ing, although there is still room for
improvement.
The study's author, Health Re
search and Policy Prof. Laurence
Baker, found that young male doc
tors earned 41 percent more than
their female counterparts in 1990.
However, when this statistic is ad
justed for certain key factors, there
is no disparity between male and fe
male salaries.
The study was published yester
day i n The New England Journal of
Medicine.
"The disparity in salaries
among young doctors can be ac
counted for by differences in hours
worked per week, specialty areas of
practice and practice setting,"
Baker said. "Male doctors report
working longer — 62 hours a week,
47 weeks a year — compared to fe
males, who worked 51 hours a
week, 46 weeks a year. Also, men
are more likely to own their prac

tice, which leads to higher incomes,
while women work more in hospi
tal and HMO environments."
"Men are also over-represented
in high-paying specialty fields such
as internal medicine, neurology,
cardiology. Women are more abun
dant in less highly paid fields such
as pediatrics and general medi
cine," he added.
Baker said he finds it promising
that the discrepancies in pay be
tween the genders can be account
ed for among younger physicians.
For this study, young physicians
were defined as those with less
than 10 years practice experience
and under age 45.
However, the data was not so
encouraging for older physicians,
who have practiced for more than
10 years. Older male physicians
earned 17 percent more than fe
males after all the same factors
were accounted for.
Baker started this research
while still a graduate student at
Princeton University. After discov
ering the pay gap among older
physicians and its absence among
younger physicians, he said he de
cided to look through older data as a
reference point. From surveys
taken in 1986, he found that young
male physicians then earned 7 per
cent more than females after factor
ing in the differences in workload,
practice setting and specialty fields.
"This Ls both an expected and
unexpected result," Baker said.
"Women account for about half of
t he present medical students and as
more women go into practice and
into more specialized fields, the dif
ference in pay will decrease. Howev
er, the fact that the difference
changed so quickly, from 7 percent
to zero in four years, was unexpect
ed."
The study focused only on the
differences in salaries by gender

and offered no reason for the dis
crepancies.
"I'm not at all surprised," Marie
Reed Carlisle, a third-year medical
student, said about the study's
findings. "If I would have had to
guess at the results, I would have
said that a pay discrepancy still ex
ists among the older echelon but
t hat it is Retting better at the earlier
stages. I think that as medicine be
comes more business-oriented, the
bottom line will be more empha
sized.
"There are more standardized
reviews now in medicine and that is
having a big impact. Raises and ad
vancements are no longer as subjec
tive and productive women will con
tinue to advance," she added.
Sherilynn Cooke, also a third
year student, agreed, "When a com
pany has a limited budget, they will
hire the best doctor they can get.
This should help women in opening
up any doors that may still be closed
to them."
