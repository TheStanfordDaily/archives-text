### Kristie Lilje Smith Staff writer 
Kicking off this year's Herstory celebra
tion, the Stanford Women's Collective host
ed the fourth annual Women's Leadership
Conference on Friday and Saturday.
According to junior Rula Razek, one of the
conference organizers, the conference began
as part of a senior honors project. The pur
pose of the conference was to establish a
forum for the discussion of relevant issues to
women and to foster women's empower
ment, Razek said.
Speaking to a crowd of more than 40
women Friday night, keynote speaker Linda
Burnham facilitated discussion of pertinent
women's issues by contrasting the 1995
Women's Conference in Beijing with the one
she attended in 1985 in Nairobi, Kenya.
Burnham, co-founder and director of the
Women of Color Resource Center in San
Francisco, attended last year's world confer
ence with a group of more than 100 women
from around the country and found the con
ference to be a "transformative experience."
The 1995 conference was different than
the conference in Nairobi on several levels,
Burnham explained. Not only were the two
conferences set in different political con
texts, but over the past 10 years concern
about health care for women worldwide has
come to be a more pertinent issue, she said.
The political restructuring of South
Africa since 1985 also impacted the confer
ence in Beijing, Burnham said. "Democracy

came to South Africa," she said. In 1985,
many of the South African women attending
the conference were actually in exile from
their country, whereas in 1995, South
African women were able to play a more ac
tive and formal role at the conference, she
said.

The conference gave us the
opportunity to understand
the issues in a global con
text; it forced us to raise the
level of our organizational
skills.'

Much has improved for women through
out that 10-year period, Burnham said. How
ever. one of the most frightening statistics is
the sharp increase in the number of homeless
women and children since 1985, sne said.
"This is homelessness worldwide we're
talking about," she said.
One of the most important issues at the
1995 conference was global economic re
structuring, she explained. These discus
sions addressed the problems of transna
tional corporations as well as the problems
associated with the World Bank and the In
ternational Monetary Fund and their im

pact on women.
In her presentation, Burnham also ad
dressed what a grassroots organization such
as her center or an individual college student
could gain from attending a conference of the
magnitude of the one in Beijing.
"The conference gave us the opportunity
to understand the issues in a global context;
it forced us to raise the level of our organiza
tional skills, and it gave us the chance to be
inspired by other women," Burnham said.
The United States is on the insular side,
she said. In the United States, it is difficult to
know what is happening in other parts of the
world, especially when day-to-day activities
are so important, she said.
Burnham's speech was followed by a dance
performance Erk; >y evening by junior Sarah
Margolis who specializes in modern dance
and choreography. The conference continued
through Saturday afternoon, allowing the
women in attendance to explore a variety of
workshops ranging from "Health and Stress
Management" to issues associated with an
"All-Women's Education."
The conference also included a panel of
prominent women leaders in the community,
who addressed "Perspective in Leadership."
The Herstory opening ceremony will be
held today at noon in White Plaza. Several
student performance groups will provide en
tertainment, and Vice Provost and Dean for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds will join
other speakers in detailing the events of the
coming weeks. Herstory runs though April
28.
