# New options to customize e-mail
## 
### Marni Leff Contributing writer 
Starting today, students and
faculty with e-mail accounts
through Stanford can further
customize their e-mail names and
receive e-mail at the
"stanford.edu" domain rather
than through a specific host such
as "leland" or "forsythe."
Today marks the beginning of
a two-week trial period and stu
dents who want to activate either
feature on their e-mail accounts
can do so by visiting a set of Web
pages created bv the Distributed
Computing and Communication
Systems.
On April 29, all students with
e-mail addresses listed in "whois"
will automatically have their ac
count fixed so that a specific host

is no longer needed when receiv
ing e-mail from either within or
outside the University system.
"People will be able to send
mail from all kinds of computers
and hosts to '@stanford,' " said
Computer Systems Specialist
Lynn McÃŸae, "and not have to
worry about whether the person
is 'leland,' 'sierra,' 'cs' or any
other host. It's less of a conve
nience for the people receiving the
e-mail than for senders."
Users can modify their e-mail
names so that they resemble real
names more closely.
"A lot of people have e-mail
names that don't have any real re
lationship to their name," McÃŸae
said. "This will be a big service to
people sending e-mail."
McÃŸae explained that e-mail
users can select more desrrintive

variations of their e-mail user
name for an address.
"This is not the same as the 'le
land' alias," McÃŸae said. "The 'le
land' alias is not campus-wide so
it doesn't apply to hosts like 'cs'
and 'forsythe.' "
Students said expanded names
with simplified hosts will help
their friends at other schools be
better able to remember their e
mail addresses.
" 'Leland' may seem like a
pretty obvious host name to peo
ple who go here," said freshman
Jackie Shen. "But to people who
go to other schools and aren't fa
miliar with the University's full
name, it can be hard to remem
ber."
