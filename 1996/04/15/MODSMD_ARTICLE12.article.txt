## Israelis continue air attacks

BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) â€” Israeli aircraft bom
barded guerrilla strongholds in Beirut and southern
Lebanon yesterday, doubling the tide of refugees to
400,000 and provoking guerrilla vows to turn north
ern Israel into a "fiery hell."
Undaunted by Israel's four-day-old aerial barrage,
Hezbollah guerrillas hit northern Israel with rockets
that came crashing down every 20 minutes for seven
hours. One person was wounded and an empty school
and other property were damaged.
Three Lebanese civilians were killed and seven
were wounded in yesterday's raids, Lebanese security
sources said. All told, 28 people have been killed and
105 injured on both sides since the violence began last
week.
Israeli jet fighters knocked out a Beirut power
relay station, cutting electricity to many parts of the
capital and its suburbs. It was the first, deliberate
attack on an economic target since Israel launched its
offensive against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah on
Thursday.
The Shiite Muslim Hezbollah opposes Arab-Israeli
peacemaking and has been fighting for years to drive
Israeli troops from the buffer zone they occupy in
southern Lebanon. Daily skirmishes exploded last
week into a major Israeli offensive meant to halt a
recent wave of Hezbollah attacks on Israel.
About 190,000 panicked Lebanese residents fled
the southern port city of Tyre and 41 surrounding vil
lages yesterday after Israel warned it would attack
the area at sundown to drive out guerrillas.
"Whenever Israel and Hezbollah are mad at each
other, we pay the price," said Kassem Reda Ali, a 68-
year-old farmer fleeing his home for the second time
in three years.
"Why prolong our agony?" he asked. "Just throw
us in the sea."
