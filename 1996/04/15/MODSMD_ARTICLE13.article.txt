# Okinawa to get land back
## U.S. to return 20% of island; few troops will leave 
### 
TOKYO (AP) — The U.S. military will
give back to Okinawa about 20 percent of
the island property it uses for training, but
only a small number of American troops will
be withdrawn, Defense Secretary William J.
Perry said yesterday.
The land return is the biggest since the
United States relinquished control of the
island in 1972. Okinawa was captured by
U.S. forces during World War II and
remains a key to projecting U.S. air, sea and
land power in the Pacific.
"We have in no way backed off from our
view that the U.S. military presence ... in
Japan, in Okinawa, is critical to security in
the region," Perry said in an interview
aboard his plane en route to Tokyo from
Washington.
Later, in brief remarks before a meeting
yesterday at the official residence of Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Perry said the
United States was determined to make its
military presence on Okinawa less of a bur
den on local citizens.
"These actions taken on Okinawa are
important, but even more important, they
are the path to revitalizing the entire securi
ty relationship between the United States
and Japan," Perry said.
Hashimoto applauded the U.S. willing

ness to address Okinawans' concerns about
the intrusiveness of American military
activities. He also told Perry Japan was will
ing to study the touchy subject of whether
and how Japan could provide support for
U.S. forces in the event of an Asian conflict
outside of Japan.
Perry said President Clinton and
Hashimoto on Wednesday would issue a
joint security declaration reaffirming the
U.S.-Japan defense alliance and a commit
ment by both governments to keeping
47,000 American troops based in Japan.
In a comprehensive review of the alliance,
Okinawa was by far the toughest problem.
Many residents there resent the U.S. pres
ence and complain about noise and crime.
The discontent exploded in anger last fall
after a 12-year-old Okinawan girl was raped
by three U.S. servicemen. The decision to
return a large amount of land to Okinawan
control was aimed at quelling the rancor.
Only a few hundred of the approximately
28,000 U.S. troops on Okinawa will be shift
ed to other posts in Japan and elsewhere,
and about one dozen Harrier fighter jets will
be moved back to the United States from
mainland Japan, said a defense official trav
eling with Perry who spoke on condition he
not be identified.
