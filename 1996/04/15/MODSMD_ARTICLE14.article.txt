'Cometary knots' found
WASHINGTON (AP) — Floating in space, 450 light years away, are tadpole-shaped pods
with comet-likc heads twice the diameter of our solar system and tails 100 billion miles long.
And they may just be the first of trillions of such objects in the universe.
Astounding news? A sci-fi movie? Hardly. This is high-tech, state-of-the-art science. 1 he
Hubble Space Telescope has returned pictures of these wraithlike formations and it's on a
search for more. . j 4 -i
Astronomers call the images "cometary knots because their glowing heads and iumy tails
superficially resemble comets. They resemble giant tadpoles, too. And sperm.
Hubble astronomer C. Robert O'Dell and graduate student Kerry P. Handron of Rice Uni
versity in Houston found the knots while exploring the Helix nebula, a ring of glowing gases
in the constellation Aquarius.
They believe they are the result of a dying stir's final outbursts, when it ejects shells of
gas into space. .
Looking through ground-based telescopes, researchers had assumed such objects were
out there, but it took the Hubble, orbiting earth, to find them in such abundance.
