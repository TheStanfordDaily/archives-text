# Clinton begins state visits
## Security issues top priority on round-the-world trip 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Pres
ident Clinton traveled to Japan
three years ago as a tough-talk
ing trade warrior. He returns to
Asia this week in a markedly dif
ferent role: America's reassur
ing commander-in-chief.
Security problems — not
trade disputes — lead the presi
dent's agenda on his weeklong,
round-the-world journey.
Departing Washington late
yesterday, he will stop briefly in
South Korea before a three-day
state visit to Japan. Then he will
fly on to Russia for a summit
dealing with threats to nuclear
safety.
"The president will confront
some of the oldest and newest
challenges to the security of our
nation, from the last unresolved
problem of the Cold War — sta
bility on the Korean peninsula
— to one of the most urgent new
threats we face — nuclear smug
gling," Secretary of State War
ren Christopher said.
It is a trip designed to fill an

election-year scrapbook with
photos of Bill Clinton being
president, showing off his lead
ership skills.
The intended message is one
of Clinton skillfully dealing with
world leaders on vital security
issues, not squabbling over divi
sive trade matters.
Reinforcing the administra
tion's theme, the trip comes
amid troubling tensions on the
Korean peninsula and just
weeks after China's menacing
missile tests off the coast of Tai
wan.
"Americans will see him rep
resenting the United States in
important parts of the world,"
said Brookings Institution polit
ical scientist Thomas Mann.
"It's more a matter of them feel
ing more comfortable with him
as a foreign-policy president as
opposed to any specific diplo
matic achievements."
Many analysts say Clinton
has improved his foreign policy
performance after a shaky start

in the first two years of his pres
idency. Even now, however, his
foreign policy approval rating is
weaker than his overall ratings.
Battling for re-election, Clin
ton has to share the foreign pol
icy limelight with Senate Major
ity Leader Bob Dole, his Repub
lican rival.
"Dole has years of experience
in this area as well as his war
record," Mann said. "Americans
feel comfortable with Dole as a
foreign policy leader, perhaps
more so than with Clinton."
Clinton's failure to serve in
Vietnam created doubts about
his leadership. Dole, on the
other hand, would come to the
job with a resume noting that he
was grievously wounded as a
U.S. soldier in Italy exactly 51
years ago yesterday.
Highlighting the security
thrust of Clinton's trip, Christo
pher said the president already
has made strong headway on
trade and opening markets in
Japan.
