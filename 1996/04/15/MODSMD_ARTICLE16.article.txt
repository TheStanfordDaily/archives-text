MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) -
Through a week of slaughter
and chaos, Liberia's Roman
Catholic bishop had kept his
optimism, praying Monrovia
would stabilize and refusing to
abandon his people.
But after the main Catholic
church was looted and he him
self was robbed, even Archbish
op Michael Francis gave up and
fled the ruined city yesterday
with his mother.
"In the next two weeks, there
could be a mass starvation," he
said, before reluctantly board
ing one of the U.S. helicopters
that have now ferried 1,642 for
eigners out of the embattled
seaside capital.
Thousands of hungry, home
less people wandered the streets
of Monrovia yesterday, searching
for food and shelter while shelling
and small-arms fire threatened a
flimsy two-day-old truce.
All the shops and office
buildings in the capital have
been looted and most of them
destroyed since government
troops and rebels started fight
ing nine days ago.
While drugged-out gangs still
raced through the streets in
stolen vehicles, brandishing
AK-4 7 assault rifles, grenades
and machetes, at least they no
longer appeared to be menacing
civilians now that the shops

were picked clean.
But for the most part, terrified
Liberians have been left to fend
for themselves, as foreigners and
even the world's emergency aid
groups have abandoned the war
ring West African country.
"It has been a bloody night
mare," said Tsukasa Kimoto of
the U.N. World Food Program.
After 40 hours at sea, he arrived
in Freetown, Sierra Leone yes
terday morning with 161 other
U.N. workers and foreigners.
The United Nations and the
Red Cross were forced to with
draw when looters overran their
offices. Yesterday, a group of
young thieves left a U.N. office
carrying two mattresses and
computers on their heads; they
loaded so much loot into a car
that its belly scraped the ground.
"I pity the condition of you
Liberian civilians," Nigerian
peacekeeper Ola Sehinde told a
woman he protected as she
looked for powdered milk for
her baby. "The warlords will
never give you a chance to live a
normal life."
The recent fighting has left
60,000 Monrovians homeless.
No one knows how many people
have been killed, although
dozens of decaying bodies have
been seen on the streets. Local
Red Cross workers began to
clear awav some of the bodies

yesterday.
A U.S. military evacuation of
Americans and foreigners began
on the fourth day of the recent
violence. Pentagon spokesman
Lt. Col. Roger Kaplan estimated
that 500 Americans had been
evacuated so far, and said a
skeleton crew of 18 people
would remain at the U.S.
Embassy.
"It doesn't appear that
American citizens are being tar
geted by the rebels," he said.
"It's a fairly stable situation for
Americans. But I wouldn't want
to be a Liberian right now."
The U.S. military had ferried
out 1,642 people, including the
Americans, by yesterday. A U.S.
Marine amphibious group was
to arrive in a week to help with
further evacuations.
U.S. Ambassador William
Milan said the rescue operation
would continue, even after nil the
Americans who wanted to leave
were flown out. "Americans, of
course, are our first priority," he
said. "And of the Americans, we
believe there may be about 50 left
that we can't find."
John Frese, a U.S. security
officer from Kenosha, Wis., who
already has rescued nearly 200
civilians trapped in Monrovia,
was to make another sortie yes
terday in search of the missing
Americans.
