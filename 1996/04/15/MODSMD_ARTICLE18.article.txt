# New services to ease tax deadline
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Taxpayers
sweating out the final hours before
the midnight filing deadline will find
more high-tech assistance — but less
old-fashioned person-to-person help
— available this year.
Need a form at the last minute?
Try down-loading one from the Inter
nal Revenue Service home page on
the Internet. Or call on your fax
machine.
But an 11 th-hour search for forms

by taxpayers without access to a com
puter or fax machine may prove diffi
cult. The IRS has closed 93 walk-in
assistance centers and reduced hours
at 442 others. Also, it's stopped dis
tributing forms at banks.
Common forms still are available
at post offices and a wider selection at
libraries, as well as IRS offices that
survived the agency's belt-tightening.
The IRS home page also has tax
information on a wide range of topics.

Or taxpayers can listen to tapes on
about 150 subjects by calling 1-800-
829-4477. That's also the number to
check on the status of refunds.
Reaching an IRS employee by tele
phone just before the filing deadline
may be next to impossible. During
January, February and March, the
IRS answered about one in five calls
placed to its help line, 1-800-829-
1040. But that ratio is sure to be a lot
worse todav.
