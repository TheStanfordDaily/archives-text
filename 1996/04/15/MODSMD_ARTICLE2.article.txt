The Stanford Human Genome Center
has received a $2.5 million grant, and Ge
netics Prof. Stanley Cohen, who made one
of the first breakthroughs in the field, won
a separate $250,000 award.
The National Institutes of Health will
give the center $2.5 million as part of an ini
tiative to increase by a factor of 10 the pact'
of the nationwide Human Genome Project,
which is intended to map nut the genetic
structure of human beings.
Assoc. Genetics Prof. Richard Myers
said when the project is finished in what he

hopes will be the year 2005, scientists will
have a "map" that will tell researchers the
exact position of each individual gene with
in the overall structure, or genome.
Myers stressed that the project will not
tell scientists the function of any of these
genes, only their posit ion. But knowing the
positions of genes makes exploring their
fund it m much easier.
With current technology, Myers said,
"scientists can spend years trying to find
the position of just onegene.
'I'he new inon<-»v ; Myers said, will be used
to effect a major increase in the scale of
work He said the technology used to map
genes has been in use on a small scale for

about 18 months.
Stanford now has a contract to map,
over the next three years, 17 million of the
base pairs that make up genetic material.
Myers said this will mean about a tenfold
increase over the current rate.
Ile said (he Nil I grants — which in their
first y e;ir will give $18 million to six institu
tions, including (he $'2.5 million to Stan
ford are aimed at having about 5 percent
of the human genome mapped at the end o(
three years.
Not all of the center's work, Myers
added, is on mapping human genes. Ihe
center also studies genetic material from
