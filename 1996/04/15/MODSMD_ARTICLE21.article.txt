Constitution '96 means
real reform of problems
with ASSU institutions

Anyone who cares about
the topic enough to discuss it
agrees that the ASSU is in
chronic need of reform. No reforms
yet proposed have been anywhere
near as comprehensive or com
mendable as those outlined in Con
stitution '96. Students should vote
to pass this measure, thus replacing
the existing ASSU Constitution
with a far better document.
Constitution '96 would alter the
operations of the ASSU in three sig
nificant ways: by eliminating the
Council of Presidents structure and
replacing it with a single president
and vice president, by shrinking the
senate to 30 members, all voting, and
by creating an ASSU judicial branch.
All of these changes are beneficial
for a student body interested in effec
tive and honest student government.
The most widely discussed change
is the proposed elimination of the
COP structure. Under Constitution
'96, the council would be replaced by
one president — vested with the
same powers currently accorded to
the COP as a whole — and a vice
president.
As this year's members have
proven, far too much of a COP's time
and effort is expended on internecine
bickering. Little of the ASSU's exec
utive energies remain to be devoted
to the actual execution of duties and
responsibilities. A single president
would be unencumbered by these
concerns and thus free to do whatev
er it is the voters elect him to do.
A single president would also be a
recognizable figurehead of the ASSU
to students, to the administration
and to the outside world. The stu
dents who form the ASSU's elec
torate would have one recognizable
face to hold responsible for the body's
actions or lack thereof, and adminis
trators would have one clear contact
on issues of student concern. Such a
system allows for far greater consis
tency of opinion and action, and for
far less passing of the buck.
Some have criticized this proposal
because it will lead to a less "repre
sentative" executive branch. The
point these critics miss, however, is

that an executive is not intended to
be representative. The responsibility
of the executive — be it one person or
four — is to act on the will of the sen
ate, which is designed to be the
ASSU's representative body.
Under Constitution '96, in fact,
the senate is poised to become a more
effective body. Currently, there are 40
senators, evenly divided between
undergraduates and graduates.
Within each population, half of the
senators have the right to vote and
half do not. Under Constitution '96,
the size of the senate would be
reduced to 30, with all 15 members
from each population voting
The current senate is simply
unwieldy. There is no reason for
Stanford, with a student population
of roughly 14,000, to have a larger
legislative body than some states and
most cities. Reducing the senate's
size would allow meetings to run
more smoothly and effectively, and
would likely eliminate at least some
of the shenanigans which currently
transpire on the senate floor.
Some have argued that this small
er senate would be less representa
tive; in reality it would be more so.
Though the total number of senators
will shrink, the number of voting
senators will rise, thus allowing
diversity of opinion in actual votes.
The final major change contained
in Constitution '96 is the creation of
a judicial branch for the ASSU. Cur
rently, the senate has the power
decide the constitutionality of its own
actions, a power that many believe is
roundly abused. Constitution '96
would create a Constitutional Coun
cil, much like the U.S. Supreme
Court, with the power to deem acts
unconstitutional. Nearly everyone
involved with the ASSU agrees that
such a body would be beneficial, and
the few criticisms leveled against its
creation are insignificant.
It would not be unduly controlled
by the president, as some assert; a
two-thirds vote of the senate would
be required to approve nominations
to the council. The rules governing
the council's procedures are vague,
but they can be codified in the
ASSU's bylaws.
Constitution '96 is a excellent pro
posal, filled with positive and con
crete changes to the ASSU's struc
ture. It will do much to strengthen
the organization and streamline its
operations. The student body should
support it.
