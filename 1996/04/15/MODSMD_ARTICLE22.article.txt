Measure would ensure
timely University OK
of ASSU amendments

THE DEBATE OVER Consti
tution '96 has been the focus
of this campaign, but there is
another amendment to the ASSU
Constitution on the ballot this week.
This other amendment, "To facili
tate ratification of constitutional
amendments," is certainly less note
worthy, but is important nonetheless
and should be passed by students.
The rules for amending to the
ASSU Constitution specify that
the Board of Trustees or its
designee must approve all changes
before they can be enacted. The
last amendment to be approved by
the students, Common Sense Fee
Reform, was approved by Universi

ty President Gerhard Casper — the
designee of the board — in Jan
nary. The measure had been passed
by the students the previous April.
Among other changes, this mea
sure would stipulate that amend
ments not approved within 90 days
by the board or the president, should
he be designated by the trustees,
would be considered as uncondition
ally accepted by the University.
This procedural change is a posi
tive one both on theoretical and prac
tical grounds. The trustees should
have enough respect for the student
body to promptly review the consti
tutional changes it approves. Under
this amendment, they would be obli
gated to do so within 90 days. But the
board has displayed little interest in
dealing with student government.
Thus the measure is a practical one
which will allow the ASSU's amend
ment process to continue should the
trustees and president decide simply
not to get involved.
