## Rush — a necessary evil 
### 
RUSH HAS BEGUN. It's old news
by now. It still scares the Univer
sity, the LGBCC and at least one
Daily columnist. It's only a matter of
time, they maintain, before scores of
middle-class white conservatives ascend
from hell to overtake the school. Pillag
ing and plundering like crazed madmen,
these barbarians can't wait to ransack
the frosh dorms for all signs of morality
and decency. Fifty years of social
progress will be annihilated in one fell
swoop. Just for fun.
There would be less reaction if Barry
Goldwater and David Duke offered to
speak on multiculturalism.
Yet Fraternity Rush is already half
over, and Sorority Rush is nearly fin
ished. There have been few surprises -
which shouldn't come as a surprise to
anyone. Neo-nazis haven't set up head
quarters in Cedro, and the Montana
Freemen show no sign of leaving their
camp anytime soon.
Opponents of the Greek system abhor
its selectivity and the often superficial
basis on which bids are given. In truth, I
don't think many fraternity or sorority
members would disagree with at least
part of this claim. I certainly don't.
Rush is Rush, and it sucks. This much
is indisputable. For women, it's regulat
ed to a point of idiocy. Only in the last
few years have the events been moved
out of tents on Wilbur Field and into a
nursery school. That's class. The Office

of Student Activities monitors — literal
ly — every minute of the four-day
extravaganza. Participants leave emo
tionally and physically exhausted,
unable to utter another syllable or offer
even the meekest of smiles.
Fraternity Rush includes six events
per house over a two-week period. It's
commercialism gone awry, with expen
sive food, beach trips and enough gim
micks to give a socialist a heart attack.
Each house seeks to outdo the others in
hopes of reeling in large groups of
Rushees. Sometimes the investment
pays off, sometimes it doesn't.
In the midst of this circus, each fra
ternity member is asked to meet and
truthfully evaluate over 100 different
individuals. It's rare for a Stanford stu
dent to get to know 100 people in one
school year, let alone during a single two
week Rush period.
This is the inherent flaw of Rush.
People inadvertently turn to shortcuts
when faced with inadequate informa
tion. It's the same reason why a pretty
woman or a handsome man is more like
ly to be hired for a job than a less attrac
tive counterpart, or why tall people make
more money on average than short peo
ple. Personal appearance and height
have no direct correlation with a per
son's character, yet they are each traits
valued by our society.
Yes, Rush is imperfect, but it is better
manaced here than at most other uni

versities in the country. Stanford man
dates that frosh spend a year in the
dorms before joining a Greek organiza
tion, which establishes University Hous
ing as a realistic alternative to living in a
fraternity. And, surprisingly, the system
is effective. Rushees tend to gravitate
toward the houses that share a similar
value system, and vice versa.
Ironically, the Greek system at Stan
ford attracts so much controversy pri
marily because it is so closely tied to the
school. The University has a measure of
control over fraternities and sororities
uncommon at other colleges, including
direct say over who has a house and who
does not. The Greek system is the focus
of undergraduate social life, with most
parties open to all Stanford students.
This is unheard of at other schools.
It's easy to label fraternities and
sororities, and many have sought to do
so in the past few weeks. Yet, the Greek
system is much more diverse than these
people would have you believe. For
instance, few know that Stanford's
largest fraternity is community-service
based.
Rush, ultimately, is hell. But it plays a
vital role at Stanford which should not
discounted.

Ryan Craig knows all pledges love Rush.
