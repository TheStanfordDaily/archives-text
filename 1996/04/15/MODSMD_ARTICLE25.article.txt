Students must be involved

Failure is imminent. I'm not
talking about any of my classes.
Sadly, I'm talking about the very
system upon which this university was
founded. Our notions of holistic education
have been shot to hell by recent curiously
motivated shifts in administrative policy.
Why? So what?
To answer that question, we'll all have
to dig deep, back to a time when we were
budding students whose hopes included
making an academic mark while maintain
ing some degree of sanity. We came here
because something in us yearned for schol
arship.
The tragic result, however, is that most
of us have become cynics, criticizing those
who retain these "unrealistic" and "idealis
tic" goals. Now, most of us just want out,
so we can get a job somewhere doing some
thing. We have become disheartened and
disillusioned by the constant bombard
ment of "can't" and "don't" from the
administration. Their ivory tower attitude
toward student affairs has left a severe gap
between student and administrative inter
ests. Sadly, we have practically become two
separate bodies. (Namesake appearances in
Gaieties aside.)
Perhaps the most pronounced example
of this rift is the whole grading policy
affair. Of the three students who were on
the committee, two resigned in protest of
how little regard they were receiving as
members. So with a nine-to-one faculty-to
student ratio on the committee, this ill
conceived reform was passed and put into
full effect with only one year for grace. Stu
dents who once enjoyed the option of tak-

ing whatever classes they desired for as
long as they wished before finally making a
decision on whether it was worth a grade
iire now forced to do it in four weeks. I
doubt that many are happy with this
added pressure. One must also take into
consideration the profound effect this poli
cy has had on our image as a responsible
student body. If our administration can't
trust us, who will? Thus, the attitude of
"We're doing what's best for you" has
resulted in little more than abuse of the
trust with which we so naively endow
them.
Now, the latest turn toward complete
dictation by the administration is the
recent decision by the Planning and Policy
Board to exclude student voice entirely.
Without a &ay in our own future, how can
we possibly stake claim to anything in the
present? We are, in effect, rendered power
less. What will be next?
The question still remains as to why the
administration would want to exclude stu
dents from the University policy-making
process. What motivation they might have
for such an illogical and quite undemocrat
ic attitude is the greatest mystery of all.
Whatever that motivation may be, our
job as students and citizens of the Stanford
community is quite clear. We must protest
and change this trend, before it has a
chance to take root. We must reclaim this
university as a place for student and facul
ty alike to learn and explore together. We
must remember why we all came to Stan
ford in the first place.
