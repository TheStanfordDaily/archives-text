## Sorority suppositions: farcical feminism and Coors Lite 
### 
i\ataha and Lome are two gorgeous babes
wanted by all men."
— Note pinned up by an encouraging
sorority in a freshman dorm last spring, I
swear.
This weekend something funny hap
pened: Sorority Rush ran up against
the Women's Leadership Confer
ence.
Guess who won out in attendance.
up, while you, my fair femme frosh,
were being carted around Paly High from
classroom to classroom like the cattle t he
Sigma Chis are going to treat you like, the
truer Stanford sisterhood gathered for a
free exchange of ideas. While you were try
ing to be as pert as possible so those seem
ingly sweet sisters-to-be won't aire that
you've got a blackhead on your chin, those
at the leadership conference listened to
Linda Burnham lecture and discussed
women's issues such as health, gender
issues in the job market and education.
Two camps, one purpose: Where were
you?
That's right, you rushed — you and
some 300 others. Not that that's necessari
ly a bad thing, only that if you're joining
because you believe membership in a soror
ity will be a boon to your womanhood, that
embroidering physics symbols on a Champi
on will help vou alone the road to liberat ion.

you'll soon find you were mistaken.
That particular marketing tool of the
Greek system is an unfortunate sham, an
insulting, opportunistic rendition of femi
nism. And you'll hear it crowed time and
again from women who didn't read any
thing by Alice Walker until after they were
"active":
"I'm in it because I like I>eing a part of a
women's group."
A sublimation. A post-facto justification.
Hut they all say it. Though borne as mating
grounds, today sororities package them
selves to new prospects as bastions of eman
cipated feminine integrity.
The guys, on the other hand, rush right.
In a few, short, simple sentences they spell
out all t heir intentions: Here's a few parties.
This is what we do. do. Have fun. Whichev
er party you like best, join. You can go to that
party for the rest of your life.
(Don't get me wrong. I've got nothing
against fraternities or their members.
Because of them I haven't bought my own
Coors Lite in years. A fine bunch of boys.)
But sororities talk an insidious talk. Now
lx'fore you and the rest of the Intersorority
Council start writing me vicious letters
proffering how you and your sisters really
do en joy a sense of solidarity in your weekly
meetings and quarterly proms, let me ask
you something: How can you hold that lofty
ideological post when the current manifes

tations run so counter to what self-respect
mandates for a woman ?
Show me a fern studios major who's
drunkenly hooked up with some guy she
met at a Deke mixer and I'll show you a
hypocrite or contender for a breakdown.
Show me a veteran of the Theta naked river
run who's read "The Second Sex" cover to
cover and I'll show you someone who has to
justify her involvement to herself every time
she attends another meeting at Oak Room
West.
If you could tell me that, as a sorority
member, you've never once seen a case
where at some joint party some woman gets
too drunk, goes too far with some guy and
— in plain view of her "sisters" — does
something uniquely regrettable, bordering
on humiliating, then maybe you'd have a
shot.
But that's not what happens. The truth
is that sororities spend the majority of their
time as targets for belittling behavior.
(There — that's the line they'll quote in
their angry letters.) And feminism is not
"what you make of it" when it puts yourself
and others at risk.
So go ahead, write the nasty letters
telling me I just don't understand, letters
whose tenor of self-justification will only
prove my point. Use big words and laud
your group's history. Tell me, "But that's
when it goes bad." Argue, "That's not what

we're meant to bo about!"
Sure, and slavery was a fine institution
until a few bad bossmen started abusing the
system. Unfortunately, your best of inten
tions will never counter the current reality.
And the current reality is that sororities
are a social network, a fine institution for
attending parties and meeting guys.
If that was your intention all along, no
problem. If you fess up and say, "Well, I'm
really just in it to hook up," or, "We have a
good time throwing up together," or, "I heat-
Goldman Sachs has a really big Kappa con
tingency," well then that's just fine — I'm
looking for honesty, not virtue.
But if you say to yourself you're in it for
feminist purposes, because you want to
enjoy the bond of sisterhood, because you
wish to grow under the light of fine female
minds, because you want to further your
development as a free-thinking individual in
control of her own orgasm, then you're
laughing at your own joke.
Like an ASSU candidate who really
thinks he's going to make some kind of dif
ference around here, you're only jerking
yourself around. Like the community ser
vice front of the boys' side of the Greek sys
tem, the feminist ideation of the sorority set
is just something they force themselves to
do — a tenuous excuse to maintain an
arguably outdated social structure.
So what to do then?

My suggestion for the well-intentioned
would be to dump the sorority angle and
take a look at some of the outstanding fem
inist organizations housed in the Women's
Center right next to the sororities — orga
nizations that never require their members
to pay, to drink or to pull down anyone's
boxers with their teeth.
Take the Women's Collective, for exam
ple. That bunch of 20 or so is a wonderful,
open-minded group that meets weekly to
discuss issues and ideas, to plan events like
"Herstory" — all free of charge and full of
energy. In essence, they are what sororities
claim to bo.
Who knows? Maybe a combination of the
two camps could help bring some genuine
feminist values into the current sorority
system. Certain laudable individuals
(among them the president of the Inter
sorority Council) are already dedicated to
this end, being doubly involved in the
Women's Center activities and their sorori
ties.
But beyond them, it just doesn't happen.
So, my recent Rushee, my soon-to-be sopho
more, if you're thinking of joining a sorority
because you want to be a part of an active
women's group, it might not hurt to think
twice ... before having to pay your dues.

tions will never counter the current reality.
And the current reality is that sororities
are a social network, a fine institution for
attending parties and meeting guys.
If that was your intention all along, no
problem. If you fess up and say, "Well, I'm
really just in it to hook up," or, "We have a
good time throwing up together," or, "I heat-
Goldman Sachs has a really big Kappa con
tingency," well then that's just fine — I'm
looking for honesty, not virtue.
But if you say to yourself you're in it for
feminist purposes, because you want to
enjoy the bond of sisterhood, because you
wish to grow under the light of fine female
minds, because you want to further your
development as a free-thinking individual in
control of her own orgasm, then you're
laughing at your own joke.
Like an ASSU candidate who really
thinks he's going to make some kind of dif
ference around here, you're only jerking
yourself around. Like the community ser
vice front of the boys' side of the Greek sys
tem, the feminist ideation of the sorority set
is just something they force themselves to
do — a tenuous excuse to maintain an
arguably outdated social structure.
So what to do then?

My suggestion for the well-intentioned
would be to dump the sorority angle and
take a look at some of the outstanding fem
inist organizations housed in the Women's
Center right next to the sororities — orga
nizations that never require their members
to pay, to drink or to pull down anyone's
boxers with their teeth.
Take the Women's Collective, for exam
ple. That bunch of 20 or so is a wonderful,
open-minded group that meets weekly to
discuss issues and ideas, to plan events like
"Herstory" — all free of charge and full of
energy. In essence, they are what sororities
claim to bo.
Who knows? Maybe a combination of the
two camps could help bring some genuine
feminist values into the current sorority
system. Certain laudable individuals
(among them the president of the Inter
sorority Council) are already dedicated to
this end, being doubly involved in the
Women's Center activities and their sorori
ties.
But beyond them, it just doesn't happen.
So, my recent Rushee, my soon-to-be sopho
more, if you're thinking of joining a sorority
because you want to be a part of an active
women's group, it might not hurt to think
twice ... before having to pay your dues.
