### Keith Rabkin Contributing writer 
After a tough and challenging
season, the Stanford women's'
gymnastic team finally accom
plished its season goad, us the
squad qualifiedfor NCAAs for
the first time in five years.
After going 2-7 in the regular
season, the Cardinal managed to
capture the 11th spot at NCAAs
despite fierce competition from
Pacific 10 Conference rivals
UCLA and Oregon State. Fresh
man Amy Murakami attributes
the team's success at the region
als to its unwavering determina
tion.
"We motivated ourselves be
fore the meet. We weren't going
to be perfect, but we knew we
didn't have to be as long as we
were consistently powerful in
our routines," she said.
The Cardinal entered the
West regional seeded third bp
hind the Bruins and Beavers. Al
though it had lost to both teams
earlier in the season, the Cardi
nal gymnasts were confident
that they could place in the meet.
"Coach Izzi prepared us well
for all the pressure we had to
face," Murakami said. "We spoke
with coaches from other Stan

ford teams beforehand, and they
reassured us that we just needed
to believe in ourselves to win. We
started well and instead of get
ting overconfident just kept per
forming as best as we could. We
believed in ourselves and it paid
off!"
Stanford's score of 194.7 was
third best at the regional behind
UCLA's 195.45. In addition to
placing third in the meet, the
Cardinal placed first in bars and
on the floor exercise.
However, the outstanding
t earn performance was overshad
owed by the amazing individual
accomplishments of Murakami.
Only a freshman, Murakami was
able to beat out all competitors
and earn first place in t he region
al all-arounds. Murakami has
been outstanding all season,
smashing Stanford records on
the bar and floor, but she saved
her best performance for the re
gionals. Sophomore Ken Mona
han, who broke the team all
around three times this season,
placed second overall and cap
tured first place on the beam.
"Keri and I were so excited to
place so high in the all-around,"
Murakami said, "but the real ex
citement was in the team win â€”
that we made nationals!
"Although our record doesn't
show it, we are one of the best
teams in the nation. Our good team
effort and strong frame of mind
were the key to our success."
"We were really happy with our

consistency and mental attitude,"
added freshman Tracey Kohl.
"Our performances were among
the best of the whole year. We had
just two breaks, allowing us to
prove to everv one that we are a top
club."
The Cardinal will have to con
tinue its outstanding perfor
mances if it hopes to place well
April 25 at the national champi
onships in Alabama. The Cardinal
will match up against Pac-10 rivals

Arizona, Arizona State, UCLA,
Oregon State, as well as non-divi
sion rival Georgia.
"We plan to keep our spirits up,
remain focused, and perform to the
best of our abilities in Alabama,"
Kohl said. "We know we can place
among the nation's very elite if we
can do all these things. We plan to
go in there and perform just like we
did at regionals. We've performed
excellently this postseason and we
plan to continue the trend."
