Imagine an 8-year-old girl
with brown hair, brown eyes and
a blue armband, in the midst of
100,000 men and women rally
ing in support of the Equal
Rights Amendment.
"I remember it being so excit
ing and feeling how powerful
these women were," said Marya

Howell, coordinator of the
Women's Center. "I thought
there was no way it wasn't going
to pass. I was shocked when it
didn't."
Now a 26-year-old master's
student in the School of Educa
tion, Howell is still working for
women's rights. "I was raised

kept open and to make sure it's the
same way for others," she said.
Howell said both her parents
are feminists. "My father has two
daughters and has always fought
for women's rights, and I come
from a strong line of women."
Howell described her mother as
quiet but "strong and stubborn."
Howell's own strength and
stubbornness come in handy in co
ordinating the center, a position
which fulfills the required intern
ship for the higher education pro
gram within the School of Educa
tion. Howell spends about 60
hours a week in the Women's Cen
ter, which is located in the Fire
Truck House.
While Howell is happy with the
current state of the center, she said
she thinks there is still a long way
to go.
"There's a stigmatism with a
women's center," she said. "But I
want this to be a place where every
one can come. For things to hap
pen, men and women have to work
together. And I'd love to have a
pro-life group in here. The only
way we can work together as
women is to accept our differ
ences."
She said she wants the center to
be a place where women can learn
to trust themselves and be confi
dent about who they are.
"Women's self-esteem drops in col
lege and that's reflective of some
thing," she said. "I would like them
to be prepared for whatever they
want to do afterward. "
Howell said she is impressed by
the women's and ethnic groups on
campus, especially since her own
alma mater, Davidson College in
North Carolina, has no women's
groups. "I always felt I had to be
the voice for the women's move
ment," she said.
But Stanford has much
progress to make, according to
Howell. While the campus seems
safe and the rate of rape is relative
ly low, she said, rape still occurs. "I
wish women would use SURE Es
cort or walk with friends [at night]
even though I hate that it has to be
that way."
"Stanford started with the
premise that women are equal,"
she noted, and with that premise in
mind, Howell believes that the Uni
versity should be more committed
to its women. She pointed out that
sororities are not housed and that
the Women's Center coordinator is
only a part-time position.
"I'm not ungrateful for this op
portunity. I really appreciate it,
but we need a full-time coordinator
for programming development."

she said.
Howell said she is "passionate"
about education and believes that
it is one mechanism which can
ameliorate discrimination. "You
have to learn about different cul
tures, and a good way is to have
people be together. Ignorance
comes from separation, " she said.
"We're in a backlash after the
women's movement in the '705,"
she said, adding that people are
now afraid to call themselves femi
nist. "I'm a feminist and it's not a
bad word."
Howell wants women's issues to
be looked at in a different light.
The '70s movement was predomi
nantly a white women's move
ment, but Howell is interested in
encompassing all women —
"straight, lesbian, African ..."
As coordinator, Howell has
been trying to make the center
more diverse. This year, diversity
is the theme of Herstory, which be
gins today with an opening cere
mony at noon in White Plaza. The
two-week program includes fo
rums and presentations on Chi
cano art, Asian women and les
bians, as well as a panel on religion.
In addition to Ilerstorv, Howell
has been involved in making the
center's 40-person volunteer pro
gram more active this year. She is
planninga Big Sister / Little Sister
program for next year. Other activ
ities have included the Women's
Leadership Conference this past
weekend, a public safety forum
last quarter and Womenspeak
magazine, which has expanded
from a two-page newsletter.
Junior Hula Razek, editor of
Womenspeak, called Howell a
great motivator. "She's veiy ener
getic and I being the coordinator] is
not an easy job for a student,"
Razek said.
Howell has been applying for
jobs in anticipatio'. of completing
her program and position. She said
she would like to work with stu
dent activities on the college level,
but not necessarily at a women's
center.
Whatever job she lands, I lowell
wants to teach in some way, be it
working with advisory boards, res
idential education programming
or something else. "I like teaching
about real life, and I want to create
outside-of-class experiences in
which you can learn," she said.
Howell said she will take with
her what she has learned from her
experience at the center. In addi
tion to learning the importance of
letting people know they are ap
preciated, she said she has learned
how to delegate.
"I'm used to being in charge,
