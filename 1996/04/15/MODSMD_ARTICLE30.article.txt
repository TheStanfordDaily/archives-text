### Alda Leu Staff writer 
The Stanford men's gymnasts proved to them
selves and to the world this weekend at the NCAA
West regionals that they will be ready to defend their
1995 national championship. The Cardinal placed
second overall in the competition, earning a season
high combined score of 228.5.
California took first place with a 230.475 and
Stanford was followed by Oklahoma with a 227.375.
Those three teams will advance to the NCAA cham
pionships at Stanford April 24-27.
In addition to topping even its own expectations of
a third-place finish, the Stanford team also posted
the top all-around score. Junior Keith Wiley won the
individual title with a score of 57.75, taking the floor
event with a 9.825. In addition to his first-place score
in the floor exercise, Wiley scored a 9.6 on the pom
mel horse, a 9.6 on rings, a 9.35 on the vault, a 9.625
on the parallel bar and a 9.75 on the high bar.
In fact, the entire team performed well in this
competition, the squad's best performance of the
year. Junior Jaime Ellis racked up a total of 56.6
points, which was the seventh-highest individual
score of the meet. He took second in the high bar with
a 9.8.
After each of the men's performances, there were
cheers of joy as they nailed their routines and scored
their highest scores of the year. Both junior lan
Bachrach and sophomore Clarence Miao did well in
their events — Bachrach scored the second-highest
score in the fioor exercise with a 9.8, while Miao
scored a solid 9.6 on the fioor and 9.3 on the vault.
Head coach Sadao Hamada had said previously
that his top men, like Bachrach, Wiley and Ellis
should be scoring 9.8s by NCAAs — and he was right.
The younger gymnasts, Hamada predicted, would

be hitting the 9.5 mark. Redshirt
freshman Jeremy Herman fulfilled
and exceeded those expectations by
hitting his pommel horse routine
with a 9.65, good for fifth place in the
event.
Additionally, senior Oliver Dem
ree entered the race for the Cardi
nal this weekend, and should be all
set to go by NCAAs. Demree recent
ly came off of the ineligible list to
compete for Stanford.
Herman explained the differ
ence between this meet and the
other ones that the team has com
peted in all year. "We trained in
credibly hard and we were definite
ly more focused," he said. "It was a
huge team effort, we had never

been this tight as a team, at least
this year."
Hamada preached a new outlook
for the team before the meet — he
wanted his gymnasts to focus on
their own individual performances
rather than on those of the entire
team. He derailed the outlook of a
team effort in order to counteract
the tendency of the team in past
competitions to become shakier if
the lead performances went badly.
In other words, Hamada wanted to
undo the snowball effect of bad rou
tines.
"He told us to focus on your rou
tine as an individual routine rather
than as part of a team," Herman
said.
And as each routine did well, the
focus was not lost. "It psyched us up
when everybody else hit, but we still
were focusing on our own events —
doing our best individually," Miao

said.
These individual triumphs often
came despite the pain of injuries as
several of the gymnasts were hurt
for the meet. Miao had a back in
jury, Wiley hurt his heel during the
season, and both Hegi and Ellis had
sore shoulders.
"We learned to cope with them
(the injuries), and when we got into
Nebraska we were feeling pretty
confident," Miao said. "I was the
first performer for our school. The
Cornhuskers are very loud mid all I
could hear was them screaming, but
parallel bars I actually hit. I hit ba
sically eveiy event expect high bars.
"Even though we improved from
224.75 to 228.5, we still had some
mistakes. Having those mistakes is
really encouraging because it gives
us a little less that two weeks to go
into the gym and polish things up
and go into nationals and nail
