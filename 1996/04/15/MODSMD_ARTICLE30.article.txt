The Stanford men's gymnasts proved to them
selves and to the world this weekend at the NCAA
West regionals that they will be ready to defend their
1995 national championship. The Cardinal placed
second overall in the competition, earning a season
high combined score of 228.5.
California took first place with a 230.475 and
Stanford was followed by Oklahoma with a 227.375.
Those three teams will advance to the NCAA cham
pionships at Stanford April 24-27.
In addition to topping even its own expectations of
a third-place finish, the Stanford team also posted
the top all-around score. Junior Keith Wiley won the
individual title with a score of 57.75, taking the floor
event with a 9.825. In addition to his first-place score
in the floor exercise, Wiley scored a 9.6 on the pom
mel horse, a 9.6 on rings, a 9.35 on the vault, a 9.625
on the parallel bar and a 9.75 on the high bar.
In fact, the entire team performed well in this
competition, the squad's best performance of the
year. Junior Jaime Ellis racked up a total of 56.6
points, which was the seventh-highest individual
score of the meet. He took second in the high bar with
a 9.8.
After each of the men's performances, there were
cheers of joy as they nailed their routines and scored
their highest scores of the year. Both junior lan
Bachrach and sophomore Clarence Miao did well in
their events — Bachrach scored the second-highest
score in the fioor exercise with a 9.8, while Miao
scored a solid 9.6 on the fioor and 9.3 on the vault.
Head coach Sadao Hamada had said previously
that his top men, like Bachrach, Wiley and Ellis
should be scoring 9.8s by NCAAs — and he was right.
The younger gymnasts, Hamada predicted, would
