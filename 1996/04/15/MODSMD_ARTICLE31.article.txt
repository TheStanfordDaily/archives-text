The Stanford women's tennis
squad took a two-g;une lead in its
quest for its ninth-straight Pacific
10 Conference title, as the Cardinal
(19-1 overall, 7-0 Pac-10 Southern
Division) completed a sweep of the
Arizona schools this weekend.
On Friday in Tempe, the Cardi
nal demolished Arizona State for the
second time this season, 7-2, and fol
lowed that performance with a 7-2
drubbing of No. 4 Arizona on its
home court. The Wildcats (18-3, 7-
2), in second place in the conference,
dropped two behind the Cardinal in
the loss column, while the Cardinal
extended its winning streak to 10.
"I was pretty happy," said Stan
ford head coach Frank Brennan.
"We played a pretty solid team in
Arizona State and the No. 4 team in
the country in Arizona on their

home court, and we came out of it
real well. We handled ASU pretty
well and had our easiest match yet
against Arizona."
The Cardinal is now a combined
5-0 against their Pac-10 rivals from
the desert,, downing the Wildcats on
three occasions, two in Pac-10 meet
ings and once at the National Team
Indoor Championships.
Cardinal junior Katie Schlukebir
(15-4) led the way for Stanford's sin
gles players all weekend, having her
way especially in the No. 2 singles
match against Stephanie Sammari
tano, 6-3,6-0.
"That's how you get to beat
teams," said Brennan. "You control
the singles. I think we're hitting on
all our cylinders right now."
Arizona received its success from
a familiar face at the No. 1 position.
Sophomore Vicky Maes, the top sin
gles player in the country, denied
Ania Bleszynski's (14-6) upset bid
after the Cardinal sophomore took
an early one-set lead. Despite play

ingsome of her best tennis of the sea
son, Bleszynski fell just short, losing
6-2,4-6,4-6.
"I think Ania's still playing well,"
Brennan said. "It's just tough at No.
1. Everybody's good, and there's not
much rest between players."
The Wildcats also got a point off
of an upset in the No. 4 match.
Karen Goldstein shocked redshirt
senior Kim Shasby (10-6) in straight
sets, 7-5,6-3.
With a 4-2 advantage, the Cardi
nal needed just one doubles match to
clinch the victory, but swept the re
maining three for the final margin.
Shasby and Bleszynski, the only two
Cardinal competitors to lose in the
match, both bounced back in their
respective doubles matches to notch
a victory.
The third-ranked tandem in the
country, Bleszysnki and Schlukebir
(9-3), continued their recent hot
streak as they defeated Maes and
Olivia Gravereaux, 6-3, 6-4. The
match was Gravereaux's first of the
season for Arizona after recovering
from a wrist injury.
"First doubles is really doing a
great job," Brennan said. "They re
ally have found themselves. They've

knocked off a couple good teams and
demoralized some other teams."
In the No. 2 doubles match, Scott
and Shasby (5-4) also earned a
straight-set win versus Goldstein
and Sammaritano, 6-4,6-3.
In a warm-up for the Pac-10 title
bout between Arizona State and
Stanford, the Cardinal dismantled
the Sun Devils (10-9, 1-8) by the
same score, 7-2, behind five singles
victories.
Stanford captured wins at posi
tions two through six, with Schluke
bir, De Silva, Shasby and Scott all
cruising in straight sets. Chiminello
beat ASU'sTorey Pratt in three sets,
while only Reka Cseresnyes could
muster a singles point for the Sun

Devils with a 7-6, 6-2 upset of
Bleszynski.
In doubles, Bleszynski and
Schlukebir clinched the win for
Stanford with a 6-2, 6-3 win over
Katy Propstra and Stephanie Lans
dorp. The teams split the remaining
matches, with ASU winning at No. 2
and Stanford at No. 3.
"I don't think we were real sharp
against ASU," said Brennan. "The
ball really flies down there, and it
was a little bit hard to get used to. I
thought we were just a little bit off
our game, but played pretty well."
With the two wins, the Cardinal
finished the road portion of the Pac
-10 schedule, winning all five of the
matches.
