# Trojans complete season sweep
## USC takes three more from Stanford in key series 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
The games were played in a dif
ferent location, but the result was
exactly the same.
Traveling south to USC's
Dedeaux Field, looking to avenge a
Trojan sweep of the Cardinal earli
er this year, the Stanford baseball
team once again got the broom
treatment from No. 5 USC, drop
ping three consecutive contests.
The No. 12 Cardinal (23-17, 10-
11 in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion) could not top the Trojans (39-
9-1, 17-4), falling 6-3 Friday night,
9-8 Saturday and 5-2 yesterday.
USC completed the season sweep of
Stanford and has defeated the Car
dinal in nine straight going back to
last year.
In yesterday's series finale,
Stanford got on the board first in
the second inning when senior Cale
Carter doubled and came around to
score on a fielding error by USC
shortstop Marc Mirizzi.
Two innings later, the Trojans
posted a pair of runs to take a 2-1
lead. Stanford starter Chad
Hutchinson, who was battling sick
ness, left the game in the fourth in
ning. Hutchinson looked sharp,
fanning five straight USC batters
at one point, but lacked the energy
to remain on the hill.
"It was a gutsy effort by Chad,"
said teammate Brendan Sullivan.
"He was in there lying on his back
in the locker room between in
nings. He's been really under the
weather, but he came out and had
very good stuff, all things consid
ered."

After Stanford tied the score at
2-2 in the top of the fifth, Trojan
third baseman Morgan Ensbergre
gained the lead for USC, blasting a
solo home run off Cardinal reliever
Tom Reimers (3-4). The round
tripper was Ensberg's sixth of the
year.
The slim 3-2 lead was all pitcher
Scott Henderson (6-0) needed, as
he retired 14 Cardinal batters in a
row before Brian Dallimore
reached base on an infield error
with two outs in the ninth. To the
disappointment of the home crowd,
Henderson gave way to Trojan clos
er Jack Krawczyk, who struck out
Carter to end the game. Krawczyk
saved all three contests to raise his

conference leading total to 10.
In Saturday's thriller, the Tro
jans desperately needed Krawczyk
to put the Stanford bats to rest, as
the Cardinal rallied from a five-run
deficit to pull to within the final
score of 9-8. USC jumped to an
early 3-0 lead on Stanford starter
Jeff Austin (3-3), who took the loss.
Each time the Cardinal closed the
gap by scoring runs, the Trojans
answered back in their half of the
inning, keeping Stanford at bay.
Especially frustrating for coach
Mark Marquess and his pitching
staff was the fact that USC scored
five runs after the first two outs of

an inning were recorded.
"We got down early, and just
didn't do some things well at first,"
said first baseman Luke Quaccia.
"We played well at the end, but it
wasn't enough."
Quaccia, who rapped out four
hits and drove in a run, was one of
several Stanford batters who had
success at the plate Saturday, but
the Trojans managed to stay one
step ahead throughout the entire

game. Designated hitter Jon Scha
effer flexed his muscles, driving two
doubles and belting his sixth home
run of the season, a three-run blast.
The weekend began for Stanford
with a heartbreaking 6-3 loss. De
spite a fine outing by sophomore
Kyle Peterson, USC's JacqueJones
drove in the game-winning run as
the Trojans struck for three runs in
the eighth inning to break a 3-3 tie.
"They're a very good team, one
of the best in the country, no doubt
about it," said Sullivan, who
pitched well in Saturday's loss.
"We don't think they're any more
talented than we are, but they're

playing with a lot more confidence.
It's frustrating, because we came
in here with a chance to get up near
first place and now we may be tied
for third again."
The Cardinal plays at home
Tuesday night against Sacramento
State then visits Arizona in Tucson
next weekend. The squad will be
looking to get back into the win col
umn as the Six-Pac season contin
ues.
"We have a long road ahead as
far as the NCA\ regional is con
cerned," Sullivan said. "It's all
there, we've just got to put it to
gether."
