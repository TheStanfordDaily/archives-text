SDSU 1 set

The sixth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team concluded
the 1996 regular season in ho
hum fashion this weekend,
knocking off UC-San Diego 15-9,
15-7, 15-11 on Friday night and
San Diego State 15-9, 15-6,8-15,
15-11 on Saturday afternoon in
two Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation matches at Burnham
Pavilion. With the Cardinal (15-
7, 12-7 Pacific Division) assured
of a postseason berth in the
MPSF tournament and the two
last place teams in town, it was a
very underwhelming affair.
"Our concentration was not
that good |this weekend]," said
Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves. "We didn't build the mo
mentum we were hoping for
I heading into postseason |."
Friday's match saw the return
of junior middle blocker Brian
Moore to the starting lineup. Un
fortunately, junior opposite Matt
Fuerbringer was sitting out the
match due to a groin injury suf
fered in Thursday's practice. The
Cardinal needed all the help it

could get, as the Tritons jumped out
to a surprising 6-3 lead in game one.
However, after a timeout by Nieves,
Stanford came out roaring and took
the first two games in convincing
fashion.
The third game, however, was
probably the poorest of the night for
the Cardinal. "It was by far our
worst sideout game of the match,"
Nieves said. Stanford shot out to an
early 7-2 advantage, but with an 8-7
advantage, UCSD showed why it is
the worst team in the league, forcing
balls out of bounds on three straight
points, and ultimately letting Stan
ford steal the game and complete the
three-game sweep.

"For the most part, we sided out
very well," Nieves said. "It was nice
to see us win one without Matt in
there. [The coaching staff] was also
very pleased with the nice job we did
on [opposite) Tom Black." The Tri
ton senior ended up with 18 kills, 15
errors mid a lowly .063 hitting per
centage.
With UCSD out of the way, Stan
ford set its sights on the Aztecs in a
Saturday matinee showdown in
Burnham. Bolstered by the return
of both Moore and Fuerbringer, the
Cardinal spikers took an early 8-4
lead in the first game and would
never look back, despite some mid
game errors.
While game two saw another
dominating performance from Stan
ford, game three was not a cakewalk
for the Cardinal squad.
Moore's presence was sorely

missed in game three (he left with a
sore foot), as SDSU took a shocking
6-0 lead. Two aces by Whitehurst fi
nally broke the shutout, but the
Aztecs still won game three convinc
ingly, 15-8.
The fourth game was very similar
to game three from the previous
evening in that it provided large
shifts in momentum. After another
mid-game lapse, the Cardinal even
tually pulled away to win 15-11.
"It was kind of ugly," Nieves said.
"We really should've won in three.
We just didn't play at a high level.
(The team! will have to play at a
higher level next weekend."
Where the team will be next
weekend is yet to be determined.
Barring a major upset by 7-15 UC-
Irvine of Mountain Division leader
UCLA on Tuesday night, Stanford
will be facing UC-Santa Barbara.
