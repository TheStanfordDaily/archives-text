The sixth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team concluded
the 1996 regular season in ho
hum fashion this weekend,
knocking off UC-San Diego 15-9,
15-7, 15-11 on Friday night and
San Diego State 15-9, 15-6,8-15,
15-11 on Saturday afternoon in
two Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation matches at Burnham
Pavilion. With the Cardinal (15-
7, 12-7 Pacific Division) assured
of a postseason berth in the
MPSF tournament and the two
last place teams in town, it was a
very underwhelming affair.
"Our concentration was not
that good |this weekend]," said
Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves. "We didn't build the mo
mentum we were hoping for
I heading into postseason |."
Friday's match saw the return
of junior middle blocker Brian
Moore to the starting lineup. Un
fortunately, junior opposite Matt
Fuerbringer was sitting out the
match due to a groin injury suf
fered in Thursday's practice. The
Cardinal needed all the help it
