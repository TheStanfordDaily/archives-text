After competing in two extraor
dinary nail-biters against No. 1
UCLA and No. 9 USC in front of
rambunctious sell-out crowds one
week ago, this Friday and Satur
day seemed conspicuously dull for
the men's tennis team as the Car
dinal (19-2 overall, 7-1 in the Pa
cific 10 Southern Division) blew
its opponents off the court, defeat
ing No. 25 Arizona 6-1 and No. 38
Arizona St. 7-0.
"This weekend we showed that
we still have one goal, and that's to
win the NCAAs," said freshman
Ryan Wolters. "We could have lost
focus or been worried about hav
ing lost to UCLA last week, but we
came out strong and took care of

business."
Indeed they did. In the 18
matches played (six singles and
three doubles against each team),
Cardinal netters dropped only
four sets. "I knew we'd be fine and
ready to play," said senior Ricky
Becker. "We're too experienced to
let a loss, even to UCLA, affect
us."
Stanford's three doubles teams
were in top form again. The sixth
ranked duo of sophomore Paul
Goldstein and senior Jim Thomas
came out in full force against Ari
zona, winning 8-2. Stanford's
standout combination came out
flat on Saturday, however, losing
to ASU's Sergio Elias and Oscar
Bustos, 8-3. It was only the second
loss for the Card partners — their
first in a dual match.
"We really stunk it up out there
today," Thomas said. "I don't
know what happened, we've been
playing so well."
Stanford's second doubles team
of Wolters and senior captain Jeff
Salzenstein, now ranked 19th,
won both its matches easily, as did
the third doubles team of Becker
and junior Grant Elliott.
In singles play, winning easy re
mained the central theme. Salzen

stein, the country's No. 5 player,
handled Arizona's Norwegian
star, Jan Anderson, and ASU's
Bustos, a member of the Chilean
Davis Cup team, with little diffi
culty, defeating both in straight
sets. Salzenstein lost both his
matches against UCLA and USC
last weekend, but seems to have
bounced back from those disap
pointing setbacks; he has now won
his last three matches convincing
ly-
Goldstein and Thomas flip
flopped positions in the singles
lineup, and both responded well.
Goldstein, ranked 27th, was never
in danger during his second sin
gles matches, and 53rd-ranked
Thomas didn't drop a set either at
third.
Not to be outdone by his team
mates, Wolters, who played fourth
singles, also won both his matches
in straight sets. On Saturday, he
looked particularly solid on his
way to knocking off Sun Devil
Tsloak Gervorkian. The freshman
is on his way back to the top form
that won him two tournaments
earlier this year.
Wolters, ranked No. 4 national
ly, suffered a stress fracture in his
left foot which kept him off the
courts for nearly three weeks.
"I've been hitting the ball as well
these past few matches as I did be
fore I was injured. It really feels
good to be playing as well as I
think I should be," he said.
The fifth singles matches were
the most exciting this weekend.
Against Arizona, Elliott lost a
marathon three-setter, 6-4, 3-6, 6-
4. It was to be the only match the
Cardinal would lose all weekend.
The next day, Elliott, No. 78
nationally, found himself locked
in another tight battle. After split
ting the first two sets, the Stan
ford junior was broken to begin
the third and went down 0-2. El
liott fought back to win the next
four games, though, and eventual
ly took the match, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.
Becker continued the Cardinal
trend, winning both his matches
in straight sets. He looked to have
run into a little trouble on Satur
day against ASU's Hiroshi Na
gashima, going down 0-3 to begin
the match. But the "Doctor," as
fans call him, quickly eliminated

any thoughts of upset that Na
gashima may have had, winning
12 straight games for a 6-3, 6-0
victory.

The ASU match was the last
home match of the year, the final
one in the careers of Thomas,
Becker and Salzenstein.
