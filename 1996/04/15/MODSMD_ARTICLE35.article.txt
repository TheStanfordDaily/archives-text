# Tough weekend for water polo
## Women beat Santa Barbara, but fall to UCLA, SDSU and Cal, 
### Erin Bryla Contributing writer 
The cards fell as they should
have this weekend at the Moun
tain Pacific water polo tourna
ment. It was just too bad that the
fifth-ranked Stanford Cardinal
was at the bottom of the deck.
The Cardinal lost three contests
and won one game this weekend as
it fought for the MPSF title. The
outcome was no surprise — the
three teams ranked above Stan
ford defeated the squad, while the
one team ranked below Stanford
suffered a loss at the Cardinal's
hands.
The Cardinal's solo victory
came on Friday against UC-Santa
Barbara. Stanford could do no
wrong in its 7-2 victory, as the
team played well all over the pool.
At the forefront was the freshman
trio of Lindsay Tam, Lindsay
Welsh, and Heather Crary.
"We played good defense and of

fense. We did everything we want
ed," said head coach Ben Quittner.
The Cardinal's winning ways
failed it on Saturday, however, as
the team was nearly shut out by
the top-ranked team in the nation,
UCLA. Stanford played well defen
sively, but did not have enough
firepower to knock off the Bruins.
"The story of our season is that
we were playing good defense,"
Quittner said.
Stanford fell once again in the
afternoon session, this time at the
hands of third-ranked San Diego
State. The Cardinal fared well in
the first half and managed to pull
within one goal of the Aztecs at 6-5.
"The first half against San
Diego State was probably the lx'.st
offensive and defensive half that
we have ever played," Quittner
said.
Stanford's youth showed in the
second half. The Cardinal tired in
the second half against the much
bigger San Diego State squad, and

was not to score again. SDSU went
on a rampage, scoring five goals in
the second half.
"We were tired and made a few
rookie and mental mistakes, which
they capitalized on," Quittnersaid.
Despite the two losses, the Car
di rial's most disappointing loss was
probably to its nemesis, UC-Berke
ley. Once again, the Cardinal re
mained competitive until halftime.
Then the Bears scored four
straight third-quarter goals to go
up 5-1. Cal would score two more
goals in the third quarter to the
Cardinal's one, sealingthe 7-2 win.
Despite the team's losses, the
efforts put forth by some Cardinal
athletes played well enough this
season to place on the MPSF All-
Ijeague team. Welsh and Crary
were placed on the 112 rst team, while
Cat heart, Tam and Olivia White
earned spots on the second team.
The remainder of the team was
made up of players from Cal and
the University of Pacific.
