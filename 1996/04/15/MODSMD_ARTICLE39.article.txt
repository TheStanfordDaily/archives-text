## 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
While the "Party of Four" doesn't promise
dating at Stanford if elected, they do guaran
tee a fun-filled junior year.
The members of this year's slate for junior
class presidents — sophomores Andrew Black
burn, Laudan Nabizadeh, Ramesh Srinivasan
and Shannon Waggoner — hope to create an
atmosphere of communication and lighthead
edness.
"We want to organize fun, laid-back things
without a huge time commitment," said Black
burn, who along with Srinivasan was a mem
ber of this year's sophomore class presidents.
If elected, Balckburn and Srinivasan plan
to use their experiences this year to improve
upon the activities.

"We're going to try to repeat and improve
upon what we did last year," said Srinivasan.
"We know what people like and enjoy so we
will try and gear the activities in that direc
tion."
The slate proposes to organize a range of ac
tivities such as a junior formal, an internship
fair and community service events.
In addition, the slate hopes to encourage
students to take advantage of such places as
the Overseas Studies center and the Career
Planning and Placement Center, according to
Srinivasan.
If elected, the slate will concentrate on
planning fewer events for the class in the
hopes of making these events more successful,
according to Blackburn.
"After you leave your freshman year and
your dorm, events really aren't organized as

much, which makes interaction hard," he
said.
The slate also intends to represent the class
to the University administration.
"We'd like to increase communication be
tween the University and the class," said
Blackburn. "Students have tended not to hear
what is going on."
Blackburn added that he was surprised and
disappointed that no other slates are running
for junior class presidents.
And as for other popular campaign promis
es, the slate has this to say in the elections
handbook:
"We'd like to also promise dating, but let's
all be serious. All we can say is that we'll do our
best to incorporate every member of our class
and make our experience at Stanford the best
it can be."
