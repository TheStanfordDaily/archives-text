Bucking a trend of decreasing interest, the
number of applications for resident assis
tants — surrogate parents, organizers of
dorm frivolity and room lock-out specialists
— has risen by 16 percent to 314 for the 1996-
97 school year, according to Ann Porteus, as
sociate director of Residential Education.
After last year's paltry 270 applications,
the figures have returned to normal, closer to
the high number of applications — 319 in
1993 and 320 in 1994 — received in years
past.
Of this year's 314 applications, however,
22 were withdrawn, Porteus said. No figures
were available for applications withdrawn in
past years.
The applicant pool also reflects Stanford's
diverse communities, Porteus added. Of the
applicants, she said, 52 percent are "people of
color" and 48 percent are female. The catego
ry "people of color" was not broken down into
any separate ethnic or racial groups.

"I'm really happy about {the diversity],"
Porteus said. "We want the RAs to be role
models for diversity in t he dorms, and the ap
plicant pool reflects those desires."
Consistent with past years, most applica
tions were from students who will be seniors,
although junior applicants rose for the third
consecutive year.
"I have no real theory about that," Por
teus said. She did add, however, that fewer
seniors may have applied because they "are
trying to get their act together" with an in
creased focus on job searches and graduat ion.
With all of the applications now in.the se
lection process will be long and tedious, Por
teus said.
After reading applications for their re
spective houses, resident fellows and current
RAs invite prospective RAs for interviews.
Those who are found to be most qualified and
suitable for the house are asked to interview
a second time. Most applicants are given at
least one interview, Porteus said.
