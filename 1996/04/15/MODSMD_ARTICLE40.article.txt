# Eshoo looks at environmental issues
## Town hall meeting encourages constituents to communicate concerns 
### Victoria Foster Contributing writer 
U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo, I)-Atherton, paid a
visit to Stanford on Friday to speak to a gather
ingof about 50 peopleon issues rangingfrom the
environment to defense spending.
The event, which took place at the Law School
in a town ball format, was one of several she con
ducted over t he course of the weekend in order to
better communicate with her constituents.
The main topic of Eshoo's address was theen
vironment, since, as she stilted, "The environ
mental issue will be very important as people
make their decision about the direction of the
country in 1996."
Echoing Secretary of State Warren Christo
pher's Tuesday address, Eshoo pointed out links
between the environment and other issues, such
as the economy and international relations.
"One has to move along with the other," she
said. "In the '70s we realized we should invest in
the economy, in the '80s everybody said invest
ing in t he environment cost too much, and now
we are realizing the costliness of not investing in
it."
She lauded Christopher's recent integration
of environmental issues into foreign policy. "I
welcome it," she said. "The environment is not a
stand-alone issue. It has to be integrated into
whatever we do."
Eshoo expressed her discontent with recent
trends in environmental policy in the country,
sayingthat "the environment shouldn't be a par
t isan issue." She criticized the current Congress
for weakening environmental protection legisla
tion originally supported by both Democrats and
Republicans. I lowever, she said, environmental
ists have scored "some unexpected victories con

sidering who holds the majority in the Con
gress."
Congress has stalled research on ozone deple
tion, undermined the California Clean Air Act
and opened national wildlife preserves to oil min
ing, she said. Among other things, it banned any
new listings for habitat protection and endan
gered species, she said.

'There are some times when
the damage is done, it can
indeed be permanent. We
don't own this planet, we are
trustees. We have to use it
wisely, live rather gently on
the land.'

She pointed out that the Desert Protection
Act had been funded with $1 this year by Con
gress. According to Eshoo, elected officials can
often do more damage to the environment by
eliminating funding for protection laws and at
tacking (heir implementation, than they can by
obliterating the laws themselves.
"I think the country's being run likeabanana
republic," she said emphatically with regard to
government shutdowns and budget problems.
The budget debate has affected the environ
ment, she stated, since "people did go back to
work after the shutdown, but the rangers didn't
have the dollars to get in their trucks to go

through the parks and do what they have to do as
their jobs."
In her analysis of the status of environmental
legislation in the current Congress, Eshoo noted
that despite some setbacks, environmentalism
has also won some victories. Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole's risk assessment regulatory reform bill
was stalled in the Senate, an unsatisfactory En
vironmental Protection Agency funding bill was
rejected in the House in July and again in No
vember, and"for the fourth time we were able to
obliterate the riders attached to that bill," she
said
Eshoo said that while many Republicans
supported the EPA funding bill, the Democrats
were still able to "peel off a handful of Republi
cans to turn that back." In addition, she said a
damaging Clean Water Act rewrite was turned
back last July. "I've never had a constituent
who said, 'We demand that the regulations on
arsenic in drinking water be lifted,' " Eshoo re
marked.
"There are some times when the damage is
done, it can indeed be permanent," Eshoo said.
"We don't own this planet, we are trustees. We
have to use it wisely, live rather gently on the
land."
Eshoo fielded questions for most of the meet
ing. They covered a wide range of topics, includ
ing such issues as defense spending, immigra
tion and entitlement spending.
Summingup her feelings on the environment
in the Bay Area, Eshoo said, "This area has an
unusually high environmental consciousness
. . . The values are so strong here and the roots
are so deep.
"I'm the eternal optimist," she said. "I really
believe democracy can work if there's participa
tion."
