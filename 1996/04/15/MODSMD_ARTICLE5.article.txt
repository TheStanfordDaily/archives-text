# Hillel rabbi to retire
## Cartun leaves legacy of strong leadership 
### Joyce Koo 
A significant era in the Stanford Jewish
community will close July 1 when Hillel
Rabbi Ari Cartun retires after 21 years as
executive director of the Hillel Founda
tion.
Directing the Stanford Hillel Foundation,
the umbrella organization for all Jewish
campus organizations, Cartun has carved a
place for the Jewish community at Stanford.
"The only thing I'll really miss is not the
daily grind, but the daily interaction with
great people," said Cartun, who announced
his retirement Friday.
In his two-decade career, two historical
landmarks herald the first and last year of
his Stanford tenure.
From 1975 when Jewish stude.ivtK.
marched from Stanford to the J J aJo AJto City
Hall to protest the United Nations resolu
tion against Zionism to 1996 when students

again marched to the Palo Alto City Hall to
mourn the victims of Israel violence and the
death of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Car
tun has worked to bring the Jewish commu
nity together in times of sorrow and celebra
tion.
"Everyone who knows An loves him,"
said Nicole Marmon, president of the Jewish
Student Association. "In that respect, every
one who knows him will be sad to see him
leave."
In the midst of political and emotional
tension, Cartun has made daily decisions to
build the Stanford Jewish community from
the ground up. His most treasured invest
ment, he said, is in the lives of others.
Hillel affiliates who don't know Cartun
personally recognize how the Stanford
-brand"! has grown frojn a small organization
nerving a handlul o/ Stanford student# to an
umbrella organization serving 14
Jewish groups and 1,100 participat
ing students under his direction.
"He has a million things to do
every day," said Stephanie Sherni
coff, administrative manager of the
Hillel Foundation. "But he has en
ergy for every one of his activities
and for everyone."
"I'm always awe-struck that
even after 21 years, Ari still gets ex
cited and also comes up with innov
ative creative ideas and programs,"
said Hillel Program Director
Corinne Medovoy.
Cartun's joy for what he does
drives his work. He has expanded
the Stanford Hillel library from
three shelves to one of the most
comprehensive Hillel Jewish stud
ies libraries, Shernicoff said. He
has led a Bible study, counseled
students, organized campus pro
grams and brought students, facul
ty and members of the community
toget her each year at the High Holy
Day celebrations.
"The best part of being Hillel di
rector is having the opportunity
and privilegeof making a difference
in the lives of students," Cartun
said. "That's why I've done it for so
long.
"I've been paid to think of fun
things to do with tremendously in
novative, energetic and upbeat stu
dents," headdcxl.

After retiring, Cartun plans to
write a book, teach, do speaking en
- gagements and participate in other
Jewish projects. Currently, the Hil
lel executive board, composed of 25
students and faculty, is searching
for a replacement.
"This moment should not pass
without thanking him for 21 years
of good work," said Dean of Memo
rial Church Robert Gregg.
"Sometimes religious profes
sionals are exclusively focused on
tending their own group," Gregg
said. "Ari has consistently been in
terested in dialogue between reli
gious groups at Stanford in a way
that is consistent with the Uni
veristy's interest in multiple points
of view."
The future of Hillel, Cartun
said, depends a lot on obtaining
new facilities. The Old Union Club
house basement, where Hillel cur
rently has its offices, is too small
and is "bursting from its seams, no
ifs, ands or huts," he said.
Because of Cartun's direction,
1 lillel will be able to carry on even in
his absence, said Seth Yoskowit?,,
president of lli 1 lei's synagogue
board. "Ari in his two decades has
laid not only a solid foundation but
also built a strong organization
with strong leadership due to his
teaching, enthusiasm and energy,"
he said.
"In the future, the organization
has a sense of where it's headed,"
Yoskowitz added. "Students are
committed to the great work that's
been started."
