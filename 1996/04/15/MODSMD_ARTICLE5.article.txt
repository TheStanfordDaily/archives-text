# Hillel rabbi to retire
## Cartun leaves legacy of strong leadership 
### Joyce Koo 
A significant era in the Stanford Jewish
community will close July 1 when Hillel
Rabbi Ari Cartun retires after 21 years as
executive director of the Hillel Founda
tion.
Directing the Stanford Hillel Foundation,
the umbrella organization for all Jewish
campus organizations, Cartun has carved a
place for the Jewish community at Stanford.
"The only thing I'll really miss is not the
daily grind, but the daily interaction with
great people," said Cartun, who announced
his retirement Friday.
In his two-decade career, two historical
landmarks herald the first and last year of
his Stanford tenure.
From 1975 when Jewish stude.ivtK.
marched from Stanford to the J J aJo AJto City
Hall to protest the United Nations resolu
tion against Zionism to 1996 when students

again marched to the Palo Alto City Hall to
mourn the victims of Israel violence and the
death of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Car
tun has worked to bring the Jewish commu
nity together in times of sorrow and celebra
tion.
"Everyone who knows An loves him,"
said Nicole Marmon, president of the Jewish
Student Association. "In that respect, every
one who knows him will be sad to see him
leave."
In the midst of political and emotional
tension, Cartun has made daily decisions to
build the Stanford Jewish community from
the ground up. His most treasured invest
ment, he said, is in the lives of others.
Hillel affiliates who don't know Cartun
