### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
At a Friday afternoon speech,
Los Angeles County District At
torney Gil Garcetti described his
role in the prevention and prose
cution of crime and addressed
other events that have attracted
attention to his office.
Introduced by Law Prof. Bob
Weisberg as "one of America's
most eminent prosecutors,"
Garcetti has a force of 1,000 attor
neys who prosecute almost
100,000 felonies each year.
Los Angeles drew the world's
attention to its criminal justice
system last year with the O.J.
Simpson trial. Garcetti, running
for re-election in a November
runoff, focused on the less well
known aspects of criminal justice

in the largest municipality in the
United States.
The job of the district attorney,
elected every four years, involves
"more than just reacting to yester
day's crime," said Garcetti. It also
involves "try[ing! to get the com
munity ... focused on our tomor
rows."
Garcetti pointed to the role of
family in the community and
noted that many criminal offend
ers come from abusive families.
"If we can break that cycle of vi
olence, we can prevent crime," he
said.
Garcetti noted that juveniles
are involved in many crimes and
as their percentage in the county's
population rises, there is a poten
tial for greater problems. He

pointed to the 41 percent high
school dropout rate in the county
as a major cause for the high num
ber of juvenile crimes.
Recognizing the lack of involve
ment by many parents, Garcetti's
office has established a "chronic tru
ancy program" which aims to prose
cute parents if they don't do more to
keep their children in school. The
program also attempts to provide
them with skills to be more effective
parents. The threat of prosecution
lias helped make the results of this
program very successful, he said.
(larcetti said he also tries to take
a preventive approach to gang vio
lence. "I'll try anything to get gang
members to straighten out," he
said. "The goal is to try to help
I them] lead productive lives."
At the same time, Garcetti
stressed that he is not weak on
crime, noting his support for the
death penalty. "My responsibility is
to protect the community," he said.
While he tries to help people be
fore they become criminal offend
ers, once they commit a crime, he
will go after them wholeheartedly,
he explained.
In summing up his vision of his
job, Garcetti said, "1 try to operate
within my sphere of influence and
my sphere of authority." That also
includes writing editorials, appear
ing on TV and radio and trying to
gain support from private and gov
ernment sources.
Although critics have accused
Garcetti of sounding more like a so
cial worker than a district attorney,
he stands by a more comprehensive
and preventive criminal just ice sys
tem.
"Most people share a broader vi
sion," he added.
When asked about the problems

of the IjOs Angeles Police Depart
ment, Garcetti responded that he
has virtually no control over its ac
t ivit ies besides that which can be ac
complished with his "political
skills."
However, Garcetti added that
"there has to be some change [in
the LAPDI," especially in light of
the Simpson trial. The police de
partment should have brought in
its most experienced and most ar
ticulate people for the trial, he said.
Nevertheless, "the I API) did a
good job overall," and it gathered
more than sufficient evidence to
convict, he added.
As for his own prosecutors,
Garcetti said he considers Marcia
Clark, Christopher Harden and the
others involved in the case among
the best in his office.
Despite the verdict, Garcetti
said he maintains faith in the jury
system, but recognizes that juries
seem to have a much more difficult
time with celebrity defendants.
In retrospect, Garcetti said he
would also prefer to keep cameras
out of the courtroom in these high
profile cases.
He also noted that making jury
service mandatory might help as
semble a more representative
cross-section of the community.
Garcetti's efforts in assembling
such diversity in his own office
have been successful, especially in
attracting women and Latinos, he
said. Currently about 20 percent of
the attorneys are minorities, and
50 percent of the new hires are
women.
"It's richer for us to have this
type of mix," said Garcett i. In light
of the distrust of' the government
among some groups in the county,
"It's vitally important to the com
munity," he added.

Service," was sponsored by the
Latino Law Students Association.
