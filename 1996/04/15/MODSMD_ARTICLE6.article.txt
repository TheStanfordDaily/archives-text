## 
### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
At a Friday afternoon speech,
Los Angeles County District At
torney Gil Garcetti described his
role in the prevention and prose
cution of crime and addressed
other events that have attracted
attention to his office.
Introduced by Law Prof. Bob
Weisberg as "one of America's
most eminent prosecutors,"
Garcetti has a force of 1,000 attor
neys who prosecute almost
100,000 felonies each year.
Los Angeles drew the world's
attention to its criminal justice
system last year with the O.J.
Simpson trial. Garcetti, running
for re-election in a November
runoff, focused on the less well
known aspects of criminal justice

in the largest municipality in the
United States.
The job of the district attorney,
elected every four years, involves
"more than just reacting to yester
day's crime," said Garcetti. It also
involves "try[ing! to get the com
munity ... focused on our tomor
rows."
Garcetti pointed to the role of
family in the community and
noted that many criminal offend
ers come from abusive families.
"If we can break that cycle of vi
olence, we can prevent crime," he
said.
Garcetti noted that juveniles
are involved in many crimes and
as their percentage in the county's
population rises, there is a poten
tial for greater problems. He
