# COP slate: ASSU respectability 'For Real'
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
For the members of the
"For Real" Council of Presi
dents slate, it's all about re
gaining students' respect for
the ASSU.
"Nothing and no one de
serves respect," said Deputy

Senate Chair Bill Shen, one of the slate's mem
bers. "You have to earn respect."
"For Real," one of the four slates running for
Council of Presidents in this week's spring gen
eral election, is using the ASSU's current ill re
pute as a springboard for their campaign promis
es to regain respect for student government, es
tablish closer relationships between the ASSU
and students and inform the campus on a regu
lar basis what the senate and COP are doing.
Sophomores Ben Decker, Angela Parker,
Shen and junior Jason Stephenson said they are

ready to start from scratch and tackle the chal
lenge of convincing students that the ASSU can
and will be fixed with leadership that puts a pri
ority on keeping students aware of what goes on
inside and outside the ASSU.
"The COP is privy to a lot of information
about the administration, how student services
are funded and run and in general how the vari
ous bureaucracies on campus operate," Shen
said. "What is so important is that we pass that
information on to students. We need to get them
interested in what goes on here on campus."
To improve communication between the
ASSU and the student body, "For Real" plans to
create a biweekly newsletter explaining issues
the ASSU addresses, historical background on
how those issues evolved, the meaning of bills
passed and actions the senate and COP take to
implement them.
"At this point, there is no real communication
between the ASSU and the student body," Deck
er said. "On a basic level, students need to know

what the ASSU is and what it does ]112 they un
derstand what it is we say we're going to do, then
they can see whether or not those things are hap
pening."
I n addition to the newslet tor, they plan to pre
sent a "State of the Association Address" on a
regular basis â€” something that has not been
done in recent years even though the ASSU By
laws mandate them as one of the COP's duties.
"For Ileal" also said making the COP more
visible and conversant with students will be one
of their priorities. By attending more dorm meet
ings and asking students more questions about
how well they think t he COP is doing its job, (hey
hope to make ASSU business seem more rele
vant to the student body.
Because an effective COP acts like an arm be
tween students and the administration,
Stephenson stressed the importance of making
students aware of t heir role as advocates.
