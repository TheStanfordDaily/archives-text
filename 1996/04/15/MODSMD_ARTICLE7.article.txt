# COP slate: ASSU respectability 'For Real'
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
For the members of the
"For Real" Council of Presi
dents slate, it's all about re
gaining students' respect for
the ASSU.
"Nothing and no one de
serves respect," said Deputy

Senate Chair Bill Shen, one of the slate's mem
bers. "You have to earn respect."
"For Real," one of the four slates running for
Council of Presidents in this week's spring gen
eral election, is using the ASSU's current ill re
pute as a springboard for their campaign promis
es to regain respect for student government, es
tablish closer relationships between the ASSU
and students and inform the campus on a regu
lar basis what the senate and COP are doing.
Sophomores Ben Decker, Angela Parker,
Shen and junior Jason Stephenson said they are

ready to start from scratch and tackle the chal
lenge of convincing students that the ASSU can
and will be fixed with leadership that puts a pri
ority on keeping students aware of what goes on
inside and outside the ASSU.
"The COP is privy to a lot of information
about the administration, how student services
are funded and run and in general how the vari
ous bureaucracies on campus operate," Shen
said. "What is so important is that we pass that
information on to students. We need to get them
interested in what goes on here on campus."
To improve communication between the
ASSU and the student body, "For Real" plans to
create a biweekly newsletter explaining issues
the ASSU addresses, historical background on
how those issues evolved, the meaning of bills
passed and actions the senate and COP take to
implement them.
"At this point, there is no real communication
between the ASSU and the student body," Deck
er said. "On a basic level, students need to know

what the ASSU is and what it does ]112 they un
derstand what it is we say we're going to do, then
they can see whether or not those things are hap
pening."
I n addition to the newslet tor, they plan to pre
sent a "State of the Association Address" on a
regular basis — something that has not been
done in recent years even though the ASSU By
laws mandate them as one of the COP's duties.
"For Ileal" also said making the COP more
visible and conversant with students will be one
of their priorities. By attending more dorm meet
ings and asking students more questions about
how well they think t he COP is doing its job, (hey
hope to make ASSU business seem more rele
vant to the student body.
Because an effective COP acts like an arm be
tween students and the administration,
Stephenson stressed the importance of making
students aware of t heir role as advocates.

"A lot of people see things they
don't like," Stephenson said, "but
then who do you go to? That's what
the COP is for. We want to let people
know what resources they have.
People should know that one of the
best places to go when there's a prob
lem they see is the COP."
Emphasizing the need to
"change the atmosphere of the sen
ate," Parker proposed the idea of
holding regular meetings between
the COP and senators to discuss
each senator's goals and how the
COP can help the senator in carry
ing out those goals.
"Anything we do as the COP will
have to involve the senate," Parker
said. "By encouraging goal-setting,
sitting down with senators, asking
them what they've done to reach
those goals and how we can help
them accomplish them, we will make
teamwork a priority in the ASSU."
The only of this year's four COP
slates with members who are cur
rent ASSU senators, "For Real" said
one of its strengths is a balance be
tween in-depth knowledge of how
the ASSU works which Shen and
Parker provide and the common
sense outsider perspectives of Deck
er and Stephenson.
"1 Jason and II lend the perspec
tive of students who don't under

stand everything about the inner
workings of the ASSU," Decker said.
"With this kind of perspective, we
will be able to question how things
are done on a much morefundamen

till level. At t he same time, having ac
cess to people like Bill and Angie who
have a lot of experience with the
ASSU is definitely an asset."
Shen added that the insider / out

sider balance will allow half of the
COP to focus inward on "patching
the holes in the ASSU," while the
other half can concentrate more on
student outreach.
