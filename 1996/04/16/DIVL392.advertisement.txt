Queer Health ... What
are the risks? no, this is
not just an article about AIDS.
The highly publicized issue of
HIV/AIDS is important and very
relevant to the GL&B community,
but many other health issues are
swept under the rug as HIV ent
ers the arena. Of course, GL&Bs
have no differing rates of sus
ceptibility to health problems,
(That 24 hr. bug cares not a whit
about sexual orientation) but
being GL or B may increase
some health risks.
Mental Health: Issues of
homophobia, denial, oppression,
and ostracism in society can
lead to lowered self-esteem
which may manifest itself
through depression and /or sui
cide thoughts or attempts.
Academic problems, dropping
out of school, alcohol and other
drug abuse or becoming
involved in "risky" behaviors are
also ways low self-esteem can
rear its head. The added stress
of coming out, in all its phases,
takes a toll on young adults.
Creating support networks is
one of the first steps of combat
ting mental health problems.
The LGBCC here at Stanford is a
an excellent place to begin (other
resources available there).
Alcohol and Other Dmgs:
Substance abuse rates are high
er in the GLB population than
other young adults their same
age. Bars have been u nation ally
one of the public places where
the GLB community can meet
openly and this can perpetuate
the problem. To cope, to add
"liquid confidence", to feel
sexy...there's a long list of why
people whether or not you used
a condom or dental dam is one
good reason to keep drinking
and drug use under control.
Cowell's Health Promotion
Services provides alcohol and
other drug awareness programs.
Also, many chapters of A.A. and
Alanon have GLB-focused
meetings.
Homophobic treatment:
Students may be deterred from
seeing a doctor because they
fear homophobic treatment. Past
uncomfortable situations where
the health provider tries to pre
scribe birth control or asks inr -
propriate questions may lead io
someone dismissing all health
care. Early warning signs of
STDs, disease, and cancer can
be missed without a yearly
check-up. Without the early
detection systems (e.g. pap
smears, mammograms, or her
nia-checks) GLB may be at high
er risk for health problems.
Your health care a
growing number of health care
providers are sensitive to GLB
concerns. You should expect
your health care provider to be
well-informed in regard to GLB
health issues, such as risk fac
tors of STDs and AIDS. Not
being frank about sexual orienta
tion can be a health risk since
the provider may misread your
health profile, causes, and
needs. If you feel uncomfortable
being direct with your provider,
you can request a new provider
or you can word you questions
carefully. For instance, if your
practioner says, "Don't have sex
for a month," you can ask
whether he/she means penetra
tion or any type of stimulation.
In every instance, stay informed!
