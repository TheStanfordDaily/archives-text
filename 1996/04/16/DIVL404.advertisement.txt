Today's birthday:
Today's birthday: Your tarot card is "Mom"
from the Major Arcana. This card reveals your
maternal side, the part of you that feels sorry
for road kill and babies those Frosh in your
dorm. You need to be careful, though, in the
next few months, that you don't forget to nur
ture number one. This self-indulgence should
last you through this summer, though this fall a
love interest will again make you address your
gaze elsewhere.

Your relationship reaches a new
level of intimacy.

keys again today, clip them to your
bag. And don't leave your ID card at the
library again.

here, Libra. Put your personal trau
mas behind you and look forward to the more
positive aspects life offers.
