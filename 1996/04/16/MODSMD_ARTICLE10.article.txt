## 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
Organizers of this year's Earth Week celebra
tion, which kicks ofF today, say the seven-day
event will do more than ever before to increase
environmental awareness on campus.
Earth Week 1996 "is designed to interest
and educate as wide a variety of people as possi
ble, no matter what their interests in environ
mentalism," said senior Deron Sedy, co-coordi
nator of Earth Week and a member of Students
for Environmental Action at Stanford. The cel
ebration is a joint effort by SEAS, the Environ
mental Representative Network and the Stan
ford Student Environmental Action Coalition.
Earth Week begins with a workshop at noon
today on business environmentalism, address
ing the scientific reasons behind environmen
tally responsible business decisions.
The week will culminate on Monday, Earth
Day, with an environmental information fair in
White Plaza from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The fair will
include presentations by representatives from
local and campus environmental groups, as
well as information on summer internships and
ways to get involved in environmental issues.
Bay Area musicians will also perform.
Keynote speaker Judi Bari, leader of Earth

First!, will discuss eco-feminism and the femi
nization of her environmental organization at
the closing Earth Day symposium on Monday.
"In the past [Earth events] have been less
campus-focused," said senior Diana Popek, co
coordinator of Earth Week. "This year we
wanted to focus on education and really get
some discussions going and attract a variety of
people outside of the traditional environmen
talists."
Popek said the University has been very re
ceptive in working with student organizers to
promote the educational aspect of the events.
University-run dining services will serve vege
tarian meals all day Wednesday, as well offer
ing fliers at tables with information about veg
etarianism. The Coffee House will give out cof
fee at the lower price of a refill to any student
who brings in a mug instead of asking for a
cup.
In addition, the Stanford Bookstore is begin
ning a new recycling program. Some course
readers for this quarter have been printed on
recycled paper, and by fall 1996 course readers
will no longer be printed on non-recycled paper.
"This is a forward-looking, cost-effective,
common-sense measure. I applaud the Book
store for taking a leadership role in the conver
sion to recycled paper," said law student Marie

Kirk in a statement. Kirk is co-chair of the
Stanford Environmental Law Society, a group
of law students that has been working on recy
cling issues on campus.
Other events for Earth Week include lec
tures and panels on recycling, environmental
ism in South Asia, population, conservation of
Stanford wildlife and toxic dumping in commu
nities of color.
"We want Stanford to be aware of the envi
ronmental issues going on, on campus as well
as globally," said Amanda Lowrey, a sopho
more who is involved in the Environmental
Representative Network. Lowrey said she
hopes other events happening at the same
time, such as Admit Weekend and Herstory,
will further increase environmental awareness
on campus.
Freshman Leslie Hummel, also a member of
the Environmental Representative Network,
said this year's celebration will be different
from past years. Previously, student leaders
have organized Earth Day or Earth Month
events, with varying degrees of success.
"I think this year, by targeting just seven
straight days, the group organizing [Earth
Week) has been able to focus its efforts better,
and hopefully it will focus the Stanford com
munity better," she said.
