HELENA, Mont. (AP) - FBI agents
searching Unabomber suspect Theodore
Kaczynski's cabin found addresses of corpo
rate executives, maps of San Francisco, bus
schedules, guns and a bottle of anti-depres
sant medicine, according to an inventory
released yesterday.
In a filing released in federal court, the FBI
also confirmed published reports of three
typewriters found in the cabin, as well as sev
eral unspecified documents and notes.
However, none of the documents were iden
tified as the original text of the Unabomber
manifesto, the 35,000-word tract published in
The Washington Post last year. A source told
The Associated Press last week that agents
found what appeared to be the original of the
diatribe against modern technology.
Kaczynski, 53, was arrested at the cabin
near Lincoln two weeks ago and is being held
on charges of possessing bomb components.
He has not been charged with any of the

Unabomber attacks, which killed three people
and injured '23.
In its list, the FBI did not specifically link
any of the more than 600 items to the
Unabomber or his crimes and did not even use
the word "Unabomber."
One item simply read: "One 'Calumet Bak
ing Powder' can containing soldering wire."
Another specified a pair of brown and green
hiking boots with a brand name, Northwest
Territory. One entry said "letters"; another
read simply "documents."
Dozens of the entries were for chemicals. A
pipe bomb was found, as was an "improvised
explosive device" in a cardboard box, and five
guns. Among the weapons were a ,25-caliber
gun, bolt-action .22-caliber rifle, Remington
model .30-06, .22 caliber black-handle
revolver and a handmade gun.
The list doesn't identify the corporate exec
utives or list the addresses.
A bottle of Trazadone, a prescription anti

depressant drug, was found.
The list also described a hooded jacket, a
blue zippered sweatshirt and hood and two
pairs of plastic glasses. A witness who saw the
Unabomber plant one bomb described him as
wearing a hooded sweatshirt and aviator
glasses, resulting in the widely circulated com
posite sketch.
The references to San Francisco and to cor
porate executives were cryptic. The item was
listed as: "One 'Aldrich' box containing misc.
papers, newspaper clippings, bus schedule,
addresses of corporate officials and maps of
San Francisco."
However, the references may be significant
because the Unabomber, who raged against
modern technology, targeted executives.
Three of the bombings occurred in the San
Francisco Bay Area and two in Sacramento.
Five of the bombs were mailed from Northern
California, including two from Oakland and
one from San Francisco.
