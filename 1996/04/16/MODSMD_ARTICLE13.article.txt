BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP)
Israeli aircraft and artillery bom
barded Hezbollah targets in
Beirut and southern Lebanon
yesterday in an effort to ratchet
up pressure on Lebanon and
Syria to cripple the guerrillas.
Israel said it was ready to nego
tiate an end to its five-day-old
offensive, but would not initiate
talks. Hezbollah, however, sent
more rockets crashing down on
northern Israel and claimed to
have dozens of suicide bombers
ready to attack.
"Our human bomb brigade is
going to concentrate vengeance
on Israel. We'll strike at the Unit
ed States when it directly inter
venes against us," said Hezbol

lah's second-in-command, Sheik
Nairn Qassem.
"We have deployed a shield of
suicide bombers in the south
ready to devastate any enemy
ground force that dares to
attempt a thrust into south
Lebanon. We'll have them annihi
lated," Qassem told the Lebanese
Broadcasting Corp. in a televised
interview.
Hamas, the Palestinian group
whose suicide bombings have
Israel reeling, said it has joined
the rocketing of northern Israel
from Lebanon. A spokesman
called on Hamas activists in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip "to
carry out their assigned mis
sions."
