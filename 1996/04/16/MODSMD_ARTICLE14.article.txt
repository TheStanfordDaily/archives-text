CHEJU-DO, South Korea (AP) - President Clin
ton is expected to announce a proposal for uncondi
tional peace talks between North and South Korea
with the United States and China as direct partici
pants, U.S. officials said.
The unexpected the centerpiece of
discussions oetween tClinton .and South Korean
President Kim Young-sam on this resort island. It
has been in the works quietly for about two months
after being raised by South Korea, officials said.
Clinton and Kim were to announce the proposal
for four-way talks at a news conference this morn
ing, Korean time.
China and North Korea are reviewing the idea
but have not given a formal response, an official
said, adding, "They certainly didn't reject it categor

ically." North Korea accepted a letter recently out
lining the proposal, the official said.
The goal is a dialogue to lead to a reconciliation
between North and South Korea, replacing the 43-
year-old armistice to the long-settled war with a per
manent peace settlement. In the short term, tku>
United States ti gufrboth sides to take "confi
dence-building" measures to reduce tensions along
the border."
Until now, the United States has insisted that
North and South Korea negotiate directly with each
other on a permanent peace accord.
North Korea has tried to force the United States
into direct negotiations, which would put South
Korea into a secondary role. Clinton's initiative is a
new diplomatic formula for a peace process.
