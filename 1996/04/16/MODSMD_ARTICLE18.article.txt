## ENDORSEMENTS A

### 
Although inexperienced,
'Prefer' has a compelling
message — ax the COP

WHEN STUDENTS vote for
Council of Presidents this
week, they will choose
among four distinct slates, each with
a different solution to the leadership
problems that plague the ASSU.
But only one slate focuses on the
real culprit — the structure of stu
dent government itself.
The members of "I Prefer to
Have a Single President" aren't
ASSU insiders, but they do know
that four co-presidents are no sub
stitute for a strong executive. Their
one campaign promise: to do what
ever it takes to eliminate the COP
For an organization that has con
sistently opposed reform, such a
change would be revolutionary.
It didn't have to come to this. Stu
dents have long complained about
the COP's ineffectiveness, but the
ASSU has done nothing to reform
itself, even after voters four years
ago elected a slate that promised to
do — and indeed did — nothing at
all. Since then, its leaders have
stymied attempts at executive
reform, convinced that four leaders
are always better than one.
Starting tomorrow, Stanford stu
dents will have a unique opportuni
ty to repudiate that notion. By elect
ing "I Prefer to Have a Single Presi
dent," voters would give the ASSU
its best shot at revamping an execu
tive branch that is so fundamentally
flawed that the very legitimacy of
Stanford student government has
been brought into question.
"Prefer" slate members David
Guendelman, Steven Liu, Joseph
Pawson and Peter Vlastelica may
lack name recognition, but they
deserve credit for addressing this
fundamental problem.

If elected, the slate would focus
on giving Stanford students what
their counterparts elsewhere
already have — a single, accountable
leader. If Constitution '96 passes,
their job will he easy (a single presi
dent is among its reforms); if it fails,
the members of "Prefer" would
immediately start to collect signa
tures needed to call a special refer
endum on the single president issue.
Once the constitution is amended,
the slate's members — who promise
to return their salaries — would
resign and call a new presidential
election; none of the four would run
for the single presidency. By fall, the
ASSU could have a single leader.
"Prefer's" dedication to reform is
refreshing compared to its unin
spired competition, namely the inde
pendent slate "For Real." Led by
Deputy Senate Chair Bill Shen, the
slate offers the same old vague
rhetoric of past COPs. More worri
some, however, is the slate's failure
to directly address the vital reform
issues embodied in Constitution '96.
We wonder what happened to the
reform-minded Shen of two months
ago who wrote on this page in
strong support of change: "You
deserve better than a nebulous
'COR' Students should be able to
hold someone — and only one per
son — accountable." It's too bad
that Shen has chosen to jettison his
beliefs for political expediency.
As for the rest of the field, Ham
mer and Coffin's "Dictators from
Space" would do little to improve
the association, and independent all
graduate slate "If I Ran the Zoo" —
although an intriguing concept —
seems to only want to point out the
ASSU's consistent failure to address
graduate issues.
The only way all Stanford stu
dents can be competently represent
ed is if they are allowed to elect a sin
gle, accountable president.
They may be campaigning on
only one issue, but it's the right one.
"I Prefer to Have a Single Presi
dent" deserves your vote.
