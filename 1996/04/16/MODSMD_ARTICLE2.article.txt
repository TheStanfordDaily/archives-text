# Stanford law students No. 1 in zzz's
## Farm named tops in student sleep, second-to-last in studying time

The Stanford Law School has topped
the rankings once again â€” this time for
sleeping.
In the category of "schools where stu
dents sleep the most," Stanford ranked
No. 1, according to a recent study by Na
tional Jurist magazine. Stanford law stu
dents average 6.33 hours ofsleep per night,
according to the study.

1 he Law School ranked No. 2 in the cat
egory of "schools where students study the
least." Stanford students work an average
of 2.87 hours each clay, a little more than
half of the 5.23 hours at the last-ranked
University of Idaho. Stanford law students
were only marginally less lazy than top
ranked Cleveland-Marshall College of
Law, where students study just 2.7 hours a
night.
Cleveland-Marshal 1 was also the school
where students sleep the least, with stu

dents averaging just 3.9 hours of shut-eye
a night. The curious juxtaposition led the
magazine's staff to name Cleveland-Mar
shall the "most questionable school," ask
ing, "If students sleep 3.9 hours a night
and study for 2.7, what are they doing with
the rest of their time?"
Hitting the hay instead of the books
may actually be a mark of distinction for a
law school, according to the study.
