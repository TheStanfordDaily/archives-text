# Stanford law students No. 1 in zzz's
## Farm named tops in student sleep, second-to-last in studying time 
### Timothy Kiefer Contributing writer 
The Stanford Law School has topped
the rankings once again — this time for
sleeping.
In the category of "schools where stu
dents sleep the most," Stanford ranked
No. 1, according to a recent study by Na
tional Jurist magazine. Stanford law stu
dents average 6.33 hours ofsleep per night,
according to the study.

1 he Law School ranked No. 2 in the cat
egory of "schools where students study the
least." Stanford students work an average
of 2.87 hours each clay, a little more than
half of the 5.23 hours at the last-ranked
University of Idaho. Stanford law students
were only marginally less lazy than top
ranked Cleveland-Marshall College of
Law, where students study just 2.7 hours a
night.
Cleveland-Marshal 1 was also the school
where students sleep the least, with stu

dents averaging just 3.9 hours of shut-eye
a night. The curious juxtaposition led the
magazine's staff to name Cleveland-Mar
shall the "most questionable school," ask
ing, "If students sleep 3.9 hours a night
and study for 2.7, what are they doing with
the rest of their time?"
Hitting the hay instead of the books
may actually be a mark of distinction for a
law school, according to the study.
"On the whole, students at pres
tigious law schools sleep more and
study less than ot her students," the
report said.
The sleep rankings may also re
late to the cultural differences be
tween laid-back California and in
somniac New York City. Three of
the top five schools for sleeping
were in California — Stanford, the
University of San Diego and UC-
Berkeley — while two of the bottom
five were in New York City — New
York University and the City Uni
versity of New York-Queens — per
haps giving new meaning to the
phrase "thecity that never sleeps."
Despite attending the most
sleep-friendly law school in the na
tion, law student Josh Wagner said
law school has forced him to cut
back on his pillow time.
"I didn't go to sleep last night,"
said Wagner, who was awakened by
a reporter's phone call at 4:30 p.m.
The still-groggy Wagner cited a
moot-court deadline as the reason
for his all-nighter.
The National Jurist also pub
lished an overall ranking of law
schools based on student satisfac
tion. The results were based on stu
dent happiness with the faculty, fa
cilities and quality of life.
The top four schools were Wash
ington and Lee University, Wash
burn University of Topeka, West

ern New England College and Col
lege of William and Mary, prompt
ing Law School wags to note a con
nection between student happiness
and the letter "W." Some law stu
dents facetiously urged Stanford to
change its name.
"Wendell Holmes would be my
vote," said law student Aaron
O'Toole, citing the middle and last
names of a famed Supreme Court
justice.
However, Law School Director
of Admissions and Financial Aids
Faye Deal denied that the school
was planning to get a more W
friendly name.
Stanford ranked 30th out of 170
schools in the overall ratings. Yale
University ranked 16th and Har
vard University ranked 158 th. Har
vard ranked last in three categories:
student-faculty relations, faculty
diversity and sense of community
among students.
The U.S. News and World Re
port list, the best-known law school
rankings, this year ranked Yale
first, Harvard second and Stanford
third. The U.S. News rankings are
based on factors including student
selectivity, faculty resources, job
placement and reputation among
academics and attorneys.
The results of the National Ju
rist study were reported in the mag
azine's April / May issue. The mag
azine based its results on a survey
conducted by The Princeton Re
view of more than 28,000 law stu
dents at 170 law schools.
