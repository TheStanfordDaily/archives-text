## Scarfing: culinary faux pas 
### 
MY FAMILY DIDN'T go to the
Reno for the excitement of craps
tables or the slot machines. We
didn't see Siegfried and Roy or David
Copperfield. We went for the buffet.
Conversation ceased once we picked
up the trays. Vats and trays of steaming
food awaited plundering. We dove into
plates of crab legs, prime rib. eclairs and
other dainties. A towering stack of dirty
plates wobbled at the center of the table
as we raced back for more. We ate until
we ached. In the fourth grade. I was
crowned with laurels at Caesar's Palace
buffet. Careful maneuvering and sheer
gluttony brought me ahead at the finish
ing line â€” I beat out my father. I swore
to live forever by the Olympic creed:
Faster, Higher, Stronger.
Recently, I went to quite a different
sort of dinner. I knew in what order to
use the silverware, but not much else.
Watch fobs and pearls, flowers and can
dles created a socialite paradise. Glass of
mineral water in hand, 1 chatted polite
ly. Then the meal was served. Hours
later, I leaned back in contentment and
exhaustion.
A strapping young man was staring at
me. Or rather, at the bones and scraps in
front of me. I had committed the great
est faux pas of all.
"You really cleaned your plate, didn't
you?" he observed.
1 tried to giggle delicately. "Oh, I
haven't eaten anything all day. I missed

brunch." In truth, I had consumed a
huge quesadilla and a doughnut a few
hours earlier. For the rest of the
evening, I drank hot water slowly.
My mighty appetite had embarrassed
me again. People were constantly
amazed that I was such a petite power
house. In this corner, at 5-foot-1. weigh
ing in at 100 pounds. Hungry Hua. I had
trained long and hard, only to discover
that I wasn't allowed in the ring.
In our society, consuming is an act of
masculine power. After all, you eat to
grow up and big and strong. "Scarfing"
and "gnawing" are both verbs imbued
with a Y-chromosomal finesse. Wielding
the knife over a steak is the ultimate in
phallic power. For a true test of will,
men sit down to do battle with the Big
foot, or take on the Dominator. Men
have dining hall contests test of
strength: there's always room for jello.
Like lysosomes, guys engulf dish after
dish of gelatin.
In contrast, a ravenous woman is a
bit threatening. Eating gives individuals
the strength to conquer the mountain or
the boardroom. Powerful women are
"man caters." The female praying man
tis eats her mate for breakfast, the
supreme upset of gender roles. Hearty
appetites belie the delicacy myth. The
fainting feminine subsists upon lettuce
and yogurt, and qualifies larger
amounts of food with "I aerobicized
today" or "I missed lunch."

Instead of Hungry Hunter, the tradi
tional female role is as provider of the
meal, from the breast-feeding to cooking
for the family. Barefoot and in the
kitchen, women are supposed to serve
others. These days, the majority of
women prepare food, even if that means
simply heating up the Salisbury Steak in
the microwave.
Even a female lion hunts for her mate
and allows him to gobble down the
choicest cuts. Yet I find arguments
based upon animal behavior too glib, too
easy. These explanations don't take into
account the human neurosis, the atti
tudes which consumes us.
You are what you eat. People have
such an intimate relationship with food.
"Calcium builds strong bones" and also
constructs the self. It's difficult to erase
inscribed notions of gender. The shifting
roles of men and women bring no guar
antee of change. Etiquette continues to
surround and complicate eating, the
most natural act of all.
For once, experience those culinary
pleasures for their sensual worth. The
whisper of cream, the flair of curry, the
tender green of asparagus, the savory
side of beef, the tang of Tang. Enjoy a
moment at the lips.

Vanessa Hua really, really likes hot water.
