# ENDORSEMENTS
## Special-fee requests 
### 
To make informed special-fee
endorsements, members of The Daily's
Editorial Board met with representa
tives of each fee-seeking group. The
board reviewed the budgets that each
group submitted to the ASSU and
asked the representatives questions
about their group's goals, membership
and outside funding, as well as ques
tions about specific budget line items.
After these meetings, the Editorial
Board discussed tbe fee requests and
reached a majority decision on each. The
board has tried to include as much infor
mation as possible on each group in the
endorsement explanations. The Daily
encourages all students to obtain a copy
of the ASSU Elections Handbook and
read over the budgets for themselves.
THERE IS NO doubt that each
and every group requesting a
special fee provides a worthwhile
service which is valuable to some group
of people. Nonetheless, the fee system
is designed to provide funding for
groups which serve a significant seg
ment of the Stanford community.
Thus, while all groups requesting fees
would spend their money on good caus
es, The Daily felt that it could not
endorse those groups which do not
serve a large segment of the student
body, or which are designed with the
intent of serving people other than
Stanford students.
In making its endorsements on spe
cial-fee requests, the Editorial Board
used five guiding criteria, which The
Daily published in an editorial on April 2:
• Does the group provide good value
for the dollar?
• Does the group make a conscien

tious and reasonably successful effort
to involve and serve a significant por
tion of the student body population
that funds it?
• Does the group demonstrate initia
tive in self-funding; that is, does its
budget indicate that the group is
actively seeking revenue sources other
than the special fee?
• Has the group responded to its
refund rate and the results of last
year's elections?
• Should the student body popula
tion targeted to fund the group's spe
cial fee - and not the University, a dif
ferent population or other parties — be
financing the group?
Groups that met some of these criteria
well but fulled others received a "with
out recommendation," meaning that
the Editorial Board could not confidently
endorse the group either way.
The term "no recommendation"
means that the Editorial Board did not
meet with representatives of that group.
The annual costs per student are indi
cated in parentheses; they were calculat
ed using the number of registration com
mitments filed for the current quarter:
13,549 total students, of whom 6,348 are
undergraduates and 7,201 ;ire graduate
students. A "B" prior to that amount
indicates that the fee will be assessed to
both undergraduates and graduate stu
dents; a "UO" indicates that the fee will
Ik' assessed to undergraduates Only.
The Daily will welcome responses to
its endorsements from groups or stu
dents; they will published tomorrow or
Thursday on a space-available basis.
Please submit letters as early as pos
sible today via e-mail to endorse

Alternative $9,208.38
Spring Break (UO $1.45)
• YES NO
Alternative Spring Break is, in many regards,
the model of a fee-seeking community-service
group Participants pay roughly $40 for a week
of food and housing while participating in inten
sive community service projects. The group
raises more than half of its money from outside
sources and requires everyone who participates
in the program to do fundraising work through
the Stanford Fund. And, most importantly, it
does good work. In fact, some of its participants
have gone on to create other community-ser
vice organiztions at Stanford, such as SHAC.
Asian American $29,158.36
Students (UO $4.59)
Association
(DYES O NO
AASA is a major group on campus, boasting
a membership of nearly 1,000 students in the
31 groups under its umbrella — groups like the
Korean-American Students Association and
Sanskriti. It and its related groups put on many
programs throughout the year, including annu
al programs such as Extravaganza and
Bhangra By the Bay. This year, the group has
taken on the added responsibilities of funding
those functions associated with the Asian
American New Student Orientation Committee
— such as the Big Sib / Little Sib program —
which were formerly funded by the Dean of Stu
dents' Office. The group has raised more out
side revenue this year than in the past and,
impressively, it has managed to keep its fee
request from rising significantly while absorbing
the cost of AANSOC.
For an organization which claims to be "fac
ing the challenge of truly serving the entire
Stanford community," according to its election
handbook statement, it is troublesome that
AASA has elected to request its fee from only
undergraduates. Having made that decision,
the organization must recognize that it can no
longer claim to represent the entire Asian-
American population at Stanford in any forums
— political, academic or otherwise.
ASSU Legal $83,150.00
Counseling (B $6.14)
(DYES O NO
ASSU Legal Counseling, which has one of
the largest fee requests on the ballot, is also
consistently the least-refunded fee group. Stu
dents are well aware of the importance of main
taining this program as an insurance plan.
The Legal Counseling Office offers free and
confidential legal advice to students and their
spouses. Most of its budget covers fees for a
San Jose-based law firm and pays the salary of
an office coordinator.
In an ideal world, students would never need
this group's services. But this is not an ideal
world, and the special fee ensures that the Legal
Counseling Office will be there when you need it.
ASSU $103,287.36
Speakers Bureau (B $7.62)
(DYES ONO
This year, the ASSU Speakers Bureau has
brought Oliver Stone, Ann Richards, P.J.
O'Rourke and Ken Burns to the Stanford campus.
The group co-sponsors many other speechs,
ranging from big names like Jesse Jackson to the
lesser-known orators who often speak on campus.
Speakers Bureau request is a large one, but
nearly the entire amount goes to pay honoraria,
travel and lodging costs for invited speakers —
the necessary costs of providing this service.
That its fee is among the least-refunded speaks
to the group's popularity with students, all of
whom are admitted free to its events as long as
they have not refunded their Speakers Bureau
fee. The group also requires its members to
work for the Stanford Fund in an effort to keep
its fee request lower.
Barrio $23,315.48
Assistance (851.72)
(DYES ONO
Barrio Assistance brings 50 or so disadvan
taged students from area grade schools to Stan
ford eight Saturdays each quarter for tutoring,
arts and crafts and breakfast. About 60 Stanford

students are accepted into the tutor program;
the program is led by six coordinators who
receive small salaries. Barrio Assistance also
coordinates Halloween and Christmas activities
for the kids in conjunction with Stanford dorms.
Although its fee might seem expensive for the
number of children and Stanford students
involved, much of it is consumed by costly — and
largely unavoidable — van rentals. To its credit,
Barrio Assistance has been working with the Haas
Center and other groups in similar situations to find
alternatives to renting vans. In addition, the group
does some fund-raising; this year it received a
$3,000 grant from First Interstate Bank.
Black $24,747.06
Student Union (UO $3.90)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
The Black Student Union funds a number of
cultural events that are open to the community,
such as Martin Luther King Week and a Kwanzaa
celebration; it also helps bring special speakers
to campus, like last fall's Jesse Jackson.
However, its budget contains some fat. A sig
nificant amount of the special fee — $5,600 — is
allocated for "Refreshments," with the majority of
that funding the BSU's annual Soul Food Dinner.
Although the group charges attendees, that
money is given to charities, meaning that the
BSU uses the special fee as an indirect way to
raise money for unspecified causes. In the future,
the group ought to include this on their budget so
students know where their money is really going.
In addition, the BSU plans to do much less
fund-raising next year; its budget projects only
$1,000 in outside revenue, compared with
$2,900 this year.
Club Sports $147,798.78
(B $10.91)
(DYES ONO
Traditionally one of the most popular spe
cial-fee groups, Club Sports serves nearly
1,000 students, about half of them graduate
students. The group provides funding to 12 dif
ferent non-varsity athletic teams, including the
hockey, rugby and cycling teams.
Anyone can participate in any sport, and
team members pay dues to their clubs. The
athletes demonstrate initiative in finding non
special-fee money, for example by cleaning up
after football games.
International $8,743.65
Undergraduate (UO $1.38)
Community
OYES d> NO
The International Undergraduate Communi
ty has a laudable goal: providing the services
necessary to integrate students from foreign
countries into the Stanford community by help
ing them became familiar with the basics of life
in the United States. It also aims to create a
sense of community among these students and
to celebrate the different cultures represented.
All of this is good, but none of it should be paid
for by the student body. The founders of the group
— which was created this year — say that they
started the group because the Bechtel Interna
tional Center seemed unconcerned with issues
affecting undergraduates. If that is the case, then
these dedicated people should lobby the center
and the University's administration to provide the
necessary information and resources to meet the
needs of international undergraduates.
The group would use some of its fee for an
"International Week" targeting the entire Stan
ford population; this worthwhile project can be
funded with Program Board money.
KZSU $94,252.44
(B $6.96)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
KZSU, Stanford's radio station, provides
several valuable services to the community.
The coverage of Stanford sports, particularly
football, is very popular and informative. The
station provides the only radio broadcast train
ing available on campus. Perhaps most impor
tantly, the station will broadcast emergency
information during earthquakes and other
crises.
Nonetheless, few students listen to KZSU
programming other than sports. And while it is
important to have opportunities available for stu
dents to learn about radio, only 60 percent of

KZSU's staff is actually made up of students.
Stanford should have a campus radio sta
tion, but it seems excessive to ask the student
body to pay nearly $100,000 for one they nei
ther listen to regularly nor work for en masse.
The sports department funds itself through
underwriting, KZSU's equivalent of advertising.
The station should look to fund more of its oper
ations in that manner, and should seek more
University funding.
MEChA $31,942.28
(B $2.36)
(DYES ONO
The work of MEChA benefits more than just
the 90 people on its membership roster. The
organization serves a resource for Stanford's
sizable Chicano / Latino community and orga
nizes events targeting the entire campus com
munity, like its Cesar Chavez Commemoration,
which drew more than 700 people this year.
The group has also demonstrated signifi
cant strength in outside fund-raising; its mem
bers say that only two-thirds of their program
ming is supported with special-fee funds.
However, students should be aware of
MEChA's political inclinations when voting on
their fee request. While the group's members
say that none of their special-fee money goes
to supporting political causes, some of the
national organization's political stances can be
considered radical.
The Mind's Eye $10,920.45
(UO $1.72)
• YES NO
The Mind's Eye, as Stanford's only active
publication featuring student writing and art, fills
a huge void on campus. It's clear that there is
demand for a venue to publish students' work;
the editors receive dozens of submissions for
just a few slots in the quarterly publication.
The group does some outside fund-raising,
and was one of the first student groups to take
advantage of the Stanford Fund Partnership One
of the main challenges the publication faces is dis
tribution; if it receives the special-fee it should
make sure that everyone who wants a copy of the
publication can get their hands on one.
Project $9,486.63
Motivation (B $0.70)
YES • NO
Project Motivation has an unassailable mission
it brings 1,400 disadvantaged high school stu
dents to campus each year to encourage them to
go to college. Pro Mo runs motivation and self
esteem workshops, college application and finan
cial aid presentations, and informal "rap" sessions.
Still, it's unclear how this really benefits Stan
ford students other than giving the group's 30 or
so members a project to coordinate. Nearly
$5,000, or over 50 percent, of Pro Mo's budget
falls under a "Meetings, Parties, Etc." line item,
meaning that the group uses the special fee
largely to feed students that come to campus.
Increasing the self-esteem of high school stu
dents is valuable, but it's not something that the
Stanford student body should be asked to fund.
SCBN $52,645.12
(B $3.89)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
A strong student television station can provide
a tremendous benefit to a campus. Such a sta
tion harnesses the powerful medium of television
to provide information and entertainment to the
student body, and also provides invaluable
opportunities to learn about television production.
Unfortunately, SCBN is not currently that
type of station. A total of eight students work
regularly for the organization, and virtually no
one on campus watches it, except to see the
ASSU-sponsored "Teleflicks."
Television is an inherently capital-intensive
business; the necessary technology is not cheap
and SCBN's large fee request is therefore some
what understandable, particularly because it has
not received a fee in recent years. But precisely
for that reason — students have not seen fit to
fund SCBN — it is curious that the group would
nearly quadruple its fee request since last year.
SPOON Hunger $5,321.84
Relief Network (B $0.39)
(DYES ONO
SPOON, the Stanford Project on Nutrition,
works with Dining Services to collect unused
food from campus residences; members then
distribute the food to local food pantries.
SPOON is an efficient organization with about
100 members who are almost all undergradu
ates; their request is very small — and a
decrease from last year's. However, voters
should be aware that $1,000 of their budget is
allocated to subsidize a trip for two or three
members to a nutrition conference in Boston.
Stanford $33,923.86
American Indian (B $2.50)
Organization
(DYES ONO
SAIO does a very effective job of serving
both the 180-member Native American popula
tion on campus as well as the rest of Stanford.
The group's annual banner event, Stanford
Powwow, brings 30,000 people to campus and
is a valuable experience for every Stanford stu
dent who attends. Stanford Powwow is the
largest event of its kind on the West Coast.
The organization also runs its own Alterna
tive Spring Break program and supports vari
ous sub-groups targeted to specific Native
American communities on campus such as
graduate students and medical students.
Stanford Axe $10,079.00
Committee (U051.59)
(DYES ONO
An organization such as the Axe Committee,
devoted solely to builing school spirit, is precisely
the type of organization which should be support
ed by students through the special-fee process.
The group puts on the annual Big Game Rally,
creates a handbook on Stanford traditions for
freshmen and runs an annual Frisbee golf tourna
ment. It is also charged with protecting the Axe
when it resides — as it does now — at Stanford.
The group has been forced to cut its budget
markedly after failing to receive a special fee for
two years and promises to put on a particularly
impressive rally next year should they receive it.
The group should also make more of an effort to
carry on its good work throughout the school
year if it has the funding to do so.
Stanford Band $59,512.20
(LSJUMB) (B $4.39)
® YES ONO
The irreverent and laid-back atmosphere of
Stanford is truly embodied by one of its most
visible groups: the Leland Stanford Junior
(pause) University Marching Band. Without any

funding from the Music Department, and with
the Athletics Department only chipping in to
cover some travel expenses, the Band still puts
on an entertaining show and manages to bring
out school spirit in a campus that often seems
overwhelmingly apathetic. Anyone who wants
to join the Band can, and the group provides
instruments for people who don't already own
them. Much of the group's special fee money
will go toward equipment.
Although some of the Band's costs are ques
tionable — $1,600 for drum major uniforms, for
example, seems steep — the group does main
tains a significant presence at a small cost. And,
after all, what would Stanford be without the Tree?
Stanford $9,561.80
Chapparal (UO $1.51)
• YES NO
The Chappie may not always be very funny,
but it is an institution almost as old as the Uni
versity itself. Its staff has worked to increase
advertising revenue; they anticipate earning
$11,000 that way next year, more than half their
total budget. Because the Chappie is distributed
in only undergraduate residences, its request for
for fees from that population only is appropriate.
However, undergraduates can rightly ques
tion whether they are getting their money's
worth considering the Chappie's hit-and-miss
humor content. Staff members do work for the
Stanford Fund to raise money, but they should
strive to further increase their advertising base
and eventually look toward weaning them
selves from the special fee.
Stanford $55,546.43
Concert Network (B $4.10)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
The Stanford Concert Network has the
admirable goal of bringing big-name musical
entertainment to campus. However, it is clear
that the organization often fails in its attempts.
Because agents look to concert promoters for
cc stency (something which Stanford's room
'ing system cannot allow) and traditional
ly vu .v college concerts as something of a cash
cow, the Concert Network operates around a
break-even point and looks to the special fee as
insurance against potential losses.
For providing special-fee funding, students are
given roughly $2.50 off regular ticket prices to the
major concerts put on by the network — which are
attended by a large number of non students. With
the wide variety of major concert venues through
out the Bay Area there is no reason for students
to have their special-fee money spent to bring
obscure but high-priced bands to Stanford.
The Concert Network helps fund smaller
free shows at venues like the Coffee House
and also co-sponsors Rinc-A Delt. It should
focus its efforts on the important role it plays in
those type of productions and leave the big
shows to the professionals.

Stanford Film $14,743.18
Society (UO $2.32)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
Now at the close of its debut year, the Stan
ford Film Society has set ambitious goals for
itself. In the budget for what they hope will be
the society's first special-fee-funded year, its
leaders have scheduled a number of film series
that aim to bring major speakers to campus.
The great success of the society's "Kids"
screening earlier this year coupled with the
tremendous interest expressed in the organiza
tion portend well for its future. Yet the internal
problems the group encountered when applying
for its special fee — which nearly didn't make it
onto the ballot — raises serious doubts as to
whether it is organizationally capable of carrying
out its grand plans. Still, a viable film society
would be a welcome addition to Stanford.
Stanford $6,872.95
Homelessness (B $0.51)
Action Coalition
NO RECOMMENDATION
SHAC, a group dedicated to ending poverty
and homelessness through community organiz
ing, advocacy and education, declined to meet
with The Daily's Editorial Board.
Stanford $30,009.09
in Government (UO $4.73)
• YES O NO
Through its many internship resources, SIG
provides a valuable service to any student look
ing to work in Washington, D.C., Sacramento or
in public-policy fields elsewhere. The group rais
es a sizable amount of outside funds from its
alumni; that money is used to fund 27 fellow
ships, for which more than 250 people applied.
Because their programs are geared toward
undergraduates — graduate students tend not to
have unpaid internships and therefore do not
need SlG's fellowships — the group is rightly
asking for a fee from only that population. At the
same time, efforts are being made to broaden
the scope of SlG's activites in an effort to serve
students who are not political science or public
policy majors; new programs in health policy aim
to attract Stanford's plentiful pre-med population.
Stanford $12,289.16
Jazz Orchestra (B $0.86)
OYES (§) NO
The Jazz Orchestra provides a valuable cul
tural resource for Stanford; a wide variety of per
forming goups is key to maintaining a vibrant arts
community. Nonetheless, nearly $8,000 of the
group's fee goes toward paying for guest musi
cians to play at the group's events. Laudable
though it is for the Jazz Orchestra to expose the
Stanford population to these professional per
formers, it is unfair to ask for a fee to do so while
also charging admission to its shows.
The group should work to fund its big per
formances through tickets sales and with the
money it charges for playing at campus parties.
Its smaller, free shows — such as its traditional
performances on the Tresidder patio — could
be funded with Program Board money.
Stanford Model $9,771.95
United Nations (B $0.72)
OYES d) NO
Stanford Model United Nations is a group
with a good cause. The only student group on
campus concerned with issues of international
relations, SMUN was revived this year after an
absence of several years.
The group has been trying to target its pro
grams to the Stanford community at large, but
has also budgeted money for sending its own
members to national Model UN conferences. It
planned an invitational Model UN conference
for high school students this spring, but had to
cancel the program when it was discovered that
another, more-established conference was
schedule for the same date. SMUN took a
$2,000 loss on that mistake.
The group's members should fund their own

excursions to national conferences, either through
their own pockets or through fund-raising — par
ticularly working at the Stanford Fund. Their panel
discussions — certainly worthy events — could
be funded with Program Board money.
Stanford Solar $29,268.29
Car Project (UO $4.61)
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION
The students working on the Stanford Solar
Car Project are a talented and dedicated bunch.
The group's car competes successfully with
those created by college students with far more
funding, as well as with those created by auto
mobile companies. Members also show dili
gence in keeping costs low; they collect a large
amount of cash donations as well as donations
of needed parts by companies like Boeing.
Nonetheless, although the project also ben
efits Stanford as a whole by burnishing the Uni
versity's image, the student body should not be
asked to pay for a project on which a core
group of only 15 work. Their work is valuable
and valid, but it could be funded by the School
of Engineering or some other source.
Stanford $2,664.84
Volunteer Network (UO $0.42)
• YES NO
The Stanford Volunteer Network is request
ing about half as much as it did last year. This
fact represents its members' committment to
ending the group's reliance on the special fee
next year.
SVN performs a necessary function: It points
students interested in doing community service
work to the appropriate venue, be it another
Stanford group or an off-campus organization,
and it also helps groups like dorms and fraterni
ties set up their own community service pro
jects. However, important though that work is, it
seems like something that should be done by
the Haas Center, not a student funded group.
Stanford $18,754.16
Women's Collective (B $1.38)
• YES O NO
The Women's Collective acts as an umbrel
la organization, educating about and advocat
ing for women's issues in both the undergradu
ate and graduate communities. In addition to
running the Women's Center, the group works
closely with other organizations such as the
Graduate Women's Network and the African-
American women's group Sisters at Stanford.
The Collective also provides a dissertation sup
port group and coordinates Body Image Aware
ness Week, among other programs. Its pro
grams attempt to serve nearly half the student
population at a reasonable cost.

Students $15,871.95
Against Genocide (B $1.17)
OYES <§ NO
It is difficult not to support a group with a
name like Students Against Genocide. Here,
however, that is not the case; in evaluating the
group's fee request, it is necessary to seperate
its name from its work.
Never before in SAGE's existance — all years
during which the war in Bosnia raged on — did
the group request a special fee. Now that the
fighting has stopped and the International Tri
bunal in The Hague is searching for war criminals,
the group is asking for money. Interestingly,
almost none of that money is budgeted to help the
victims of genocide; rather it is to be spent on
somewhat grandiose plans for on-campus
activism. Considering their cause, it is curious that
SAGE budgets $1,000 to fly in a speaker from
Europe. A speaker from History Comer could suf
fice, at a much lower cost. It would seem that the
group's members could do far more to advance
their stated goals by helping to support other non-
Stanford groups actually providing assistance to
those in the former Yugoslavia; the group's pro
grams aimed for the Stanford community can be
funded with Program Board money.
Students for $7,758.24
Environmental (U051.22)
Action at Stanford
(§) YES ONO
SEAS aims to increase environmental aware
ness on a generally apathetic campus. The group
coordinates Stanford's dorm-based network of
environmental representatives and brings some
well-known speakers to campus. The group's
leaders have trimmed its budget; students cer
tainly get their money's worth with SEAS.
Voters should be aware that over half of the
SEAS budget pays for speaker transportation
costs and honoraria. The group does some out
side fund-raising, including working for the
Stanford Fund.
You Can Make
A Difference
Conference
$10,513.64
(UO $1.66)
OYES (D NO
In the 1980s, the You Can Make a Differ
ence Conference enjoyed substantial support
from the University. With budget cuts and a
change in administration, however, YCMAD
has suffered. Only 150 to 200 attendees are
expected at this year's conference (which once
again focuses on children's issues); only half of
those are expected to be Stanford students.
Although it's hard to question the mission of
YCMAD, this is not something that students
should fund. Special fees are better spent making
a difference with hands-on community service
groups.
