## Track captures third at Golden Bear Challenge 
### Sam Wang Contributing writer 
Many members of the Stanford
track and field team took last
weekend for some much needed R
& R to heal weary bones and bat
tered bodies.
In the meantime, their team
mates traveled north to Berkeley
to participate in the Pierce Gold
en Bear Challenge, hosted by the
University of California.
Stanford's purpose coming
into this meet was to keep people
fresh for the upcoming stretch
drive of the season. As a result,
the coaching staff kept a large
contingent of key contributors
out of the competition, such as
many of the regular sprinters and
distance runners.
"It's tough when you take
eight or nine impact people from
the same areas," said head coach
Vin Lananna. "It makes it a little
difficult to do something. You're
taking away one-third of the
team."
However, no one seemed to
have told the Cardinal women
they were suppose to be taking
the week off. The squad held its
ground and finished an impres
sive third to Cal, which barely
edged USC 157-154.
On the men's side, Stanford
finished fifth, with Texas finish
ing first.
Due to the number of people
sitting out, some of the lesser
known athletes received a chance
to stand in the spotlight.
Among the men who seized
this opportunity was freshman
Jason Balkman. He raced to sec
ond place in the 5,000 with a time
of 14:34.86.
Jose Fierro was another ath
lete who stepped up to the occa
sion. The junior ran a 9:20.62 in
the 3,000-meter steeplechase,
also good enough for a second
place finish.
Sophomore Jason Lunn, an
NCAA qualifier in the 1,500,

shifted over to the 800 and mile,
where he finished second and
third, respectively.
"We had a great meet," Lanan
na said. "For the athletes that we
actually brought to the meet, both
teams did a great job. Those ath
letes were just phenomenal. It
was very encouraging."
The throwers for both sides
also had a solid weekend.
With his effort of 52 feet-1 3/4
inches in the shot put, redshirt ju
nior Pete Swanson won his first
event since his return from a foot
injury a month ago.
Swanson's steady progress
since his return bodes well for the
Cardinal men, who will be count
ing on Swanson for a bountiful re
turn of points.
Sami Jo Small, the sophomore
thrower from Canada, performed
double duties by first capturing
top honors in thejavelins with her
effort of 139-7 then coining in sec
ond with her discus toss of 165-3.
Also throwing well were senior
Sue Demars (third in the discus)
and sophomore Katrinka Jackson
(third in the shot put).
As for the runners, the regu
lars who did compete stayed in
charge.
Senior Dena Dey ran a NCAA
provisional qualifying time of
2:09.11 in the 800, despite coming
in third. Sophomores Monal
Chokshi and Sara Moore finished
one-two in the mile.
Freshman sensation Tracye
Lawyer won the high jump for the
second week in a row and the
third time in the last four meets.
Her leap of 5-8 1/2 will catapult
her into her first collegiate hep
tathlon competition ever next
week with plenty of momentum.
"On the women's side, we are
really strong," Lananna said. "I
think we could have won the meet
if we doubled up everybody, which
we said back in January we
weren't going to do.
"Had we run everybody where
we needed to and gone after it, we
would have had a good shot at
winning the meet."
However, Lananna wants to

keep the big picture in mind,
which meant, as tempting as it
may have been to do otherwise,
keeping some of his big guns out
until next week for the Mount San
Antonio College Relays at Wal
nut, Calif.
"We really downplayed it [last
weekend's meet] to take a break
for Mount Sac," he said.

Mount Sac is one of the biggest
track meets in the nation and is
an event where athletes from
hundreds of universities converge
to try to post qualification times.
This should be a major opportuni
ty for the Stanford athletes to
qualify for both the Pacific 10
Conference championships and
theNCAAs.
