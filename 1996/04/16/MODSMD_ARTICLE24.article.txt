# Card sweeps Gaels in dramatic fashion
## Crouch's late-inning heroics end softball series finale 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The Stanford softball team polished off a clean
sweep of the St. Mary's Gaels in dramatic fashion
last Thursday to improve to 21-18 on the season.
After defeating the Gaels 3-0 in Thursday's opener,
the Cardinal was forced into extra innings in the
second game before winning 7-5 in the ninth.
Extra inning heroics on the part of freshman
Marcy Crouch lifted the Cardinal to its third victo
ry over St. Mary's in four tries this season. Crouch,
who scored a run and earned an RBI in the first
game, launched Stanford's first homer of the sea
son with a rocket that gave the Cardinal a three
run lead in the top of the ninth.
"I thought it was going to hit the fence," Crouch
said. "I wasn't thinking about hitting a home run,
just getting a hit to score the run. I was thinking
that it would be better to go into the next inning
with a two-run lead instead of one."
Crouch's thought proved to be accurate. Due to
impending darkness, the game was being played ac
cording to International Tiebreak Rules, which
puts a runner on second base at the start of each in
ning. The Gaels were able to score that runner in
the bottom of the ninth, but the effort would not be
enough as Crouch's two-run blast proved the dif
ference in the game.
The game, however, is representative of the
troubles the Cardinal has faced all year against less
er competition. Stanford manages to put its best ef
forts forward against tougher teams (defeating five
nationally ranked teams this season) but seems to
struggle against unranked, nonconference teams.
"I think it's hard to come from Arizona State,
where we had two really intense wins," head coach
Sandy Pearce said. "It's hard to go from that to this.
The first game was fine; we came out and played
hard. [As for the second |, that's not going to win a
[Pacific 10 Conference] game."
The Cardinal opened the second game with a
two-run first inningon a fieldingerror by theGaels
and an RBI single by freshman Kelly Yablonski and
then extended the lead to three following another
St. Mary's error in the top of the fourth.
St. Mary's would not remain quiet for long. In
the bottom of the fourth, the Gael offense got its
first run of the day to cut the Cardinal lead down to
two. St. Mary's Trisha Dean and Katrina Chan led
off the fourth inning with back-to-back singles, and
after a sacrifice bunt to move the runners into scor-

ing position, Molly McClenahan
singled to score a run. Stanford
managed to escape the inning with
out further damage, but the Gaels
jumped right back at the Cardinal
with a two-run fifth inning to tie
the game.
Crouch stepped up in the sev
enth inning with an RBI single, but
then allowed a run in the bottom of
the seventh on two walks and two
hits. Finally, after a scoreless
eighth inning, Stanford put three

runs on the board thanks to a Gael
error and Crouch's two-run
homer. St. Mary's was only able to
score one run in the bottom of the
ninth and the Cardinal pulled away
with a 7-5 victory.
The first game was less dra
matic and very typical of a game
with freshman Becky Blevins on
the mound. Blevins has demol
ished opponents of late, winning
10 of her last 15 games. Against
the Gaels Blevins allowed just
three hits and no runs to com
plete her eighth shutout of the
season.
Offensively, the Cardinal bats
were quiet until the fourth inning.

In the top of the fourth, an RBI sin
gle by Crouch was followed by a
triple from Yablonski, scoring
Crouch from first. Stanford added
one more in the top of the fifth
when sophomore Dawn Kobata
singled to score junior Amanda
Renteria from second base for a 3-0
lead that would hold for the final.
Up next for the Cardinal are the
San Jose State Spartans. The game
is scheduled for tomorrow at 2 p.m.
and marks Stanford's last noncon
ference game of the season. The
Cardinal split with the Spartans in
the San Jose State Tournament in
February, losing the first game <1-2
and winning the second 4-1.
