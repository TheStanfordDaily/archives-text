# Freshman phenom Kribel wins U.S. Collegiate
## Stanford stumbles into fifth-place finish despite frosh's victory 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
With teammate Tiger Woods off
at the Masters, freshman Joel Kri
bel stepped up in a major way, com
ing from behind on the final day

last weekend to take the individual
title at the United States Intercol
legiate.
Building on what has already
been an impressive rookie cam
paign, Kribel was the lone bright
spot as the 17th-ranked Cardinal

struggled to a fifth-place finish on
its home course, 12 strokes behind
champion Fresno State.
"It wasn't a great tournament
for us," said assistant coach Matt
Thompson. "Most of the guys
didn't have their 'A' games going

for them.
"Still though, it was encourag
ing that we were able to be compet
itive regardless. I think that gives
us a lot of confidence."
Kribel, who shot a 2-under-par
211, finished as the only Stanford
golfer in the top 25, winning the
first tournament of his collegiate
career. Close on several occasions
with a handful of second- and
third-place finishes, Kribel seemed
mainly relieved.
"It's great to finally get a win
under my belt," Kribel said. "I had
hoped to get one earlier in the year,
but I'm just glad to have it out of
the way now so I can just get on
with playing better golf.
"It was kind of always just lin
gering in the back of my mind."
Like his teammates, Kribel had
his fair share of trouble, even if his
scores didn't indicate it. The Bran
nerite fired three consecutive
below-par rounds, yet never really
felt as if he was hitting the ball well.
"I wasn't striking the ball solid
ly," Kribel said, "so it's great that I
was able to just grind out some
solid scores."
Clutch play, more than any
thing, dominated Kribel's game.
For every poor shot, he had an an
swering recovery. A key stretch in
the final round from the 13th hole
to the 17th proved to be the differ
ence in the tournament as he hit
two important par putts and extri
cated himself from a jam on 17
with a brilliant short game. Fresno
State's Matt Christensen and
UCLA's Mike Miller, up by three
and two respectively as late as the
15th hole, were unable to match
Kribel's consistency as he charged
into the lead.
"Those last few holes was what
it came down to," Kribel said. "I
didn't play spectacularly, but I
made the shots that I needed to."
As for the rest of the team, se
nior captain Jerry Chang finished
a distant second on the squad,
placing 26th overall. Fellow senior
David Garcia returned to the start
ing varsity lineup to finish in a tie
for 44th. Junior Conrad Ray had
difficulty finding his stroke, tying
for 54th. Sophomore Eri Crum
rounded out his second varsity ap
pearance in a tie for 65th, but did
manage to post a one-over 73 in the
final round to finish strong.
"In general, everything was just
a little off," Thompson said.
"Given some time to sharpen up
our short game, we should be in
good shape come regionals.
"We know we are capable of
beating these teams."
