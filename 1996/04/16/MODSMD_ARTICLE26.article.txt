# California avenges early loss to women's lacrosse

Those pesky Golden Bears
caused major problems for the
Stanford women's lacrosse
team Saturday and Sunday,
forcing the Cardinal into a
second-place finish at the
Western States tournament at
UC-Davis.
Stanford (8-11 overall, 2-6
NCAA Division I) dropped
only two contests in the five
game tournament. But both
losses were to California. The
Bears avenged their 18-10 loss
against Stanford last weekend
by nabbing first place.
"We didn't do the things we
needed to do to beat them, and
when we didn't, Cal picked the
ball up and scored," said coach
Kay Cowperthwait.
The Cardinal has improved

immensely since its initial
games this season at the Santa
Barbara Shootout, where it
placed fourth and lost a game
to UOSanta Barbara. This
weekend Stanford beat UCSB
by a two-goal margin in the
second game Saturday.
Stanford has consistently
triumphed over Colorado,
which it demolished 10-5 in
the third Saturday contest. In
addition, the Cardinal soundly
routed UC-Davis 6-2 in Sun
day's semifinal. Previously,
games with Davis had been
close, decided by one goal and
sometimes going into over
time.
"Consistency has been a
problem all season, just get
ting the lead and maintaining
it," junior Hope Holiday said.
