## 
### Solveig Pederson Staff writer 
Those pesky Golden Bears
caused major problems for the
Stanford women's lacrosse
team Saturday and Sunday,
forcing the Cardinal into a
second-place finish at the
Western States tournament at
UC-Davis.
Stanford (8-11 overall, 2-6
NCAA Division I) dropped
only two contests in the five
game tournament. But both
losses were to California. The
Bears avenged their 18-10 loss
against Stanford last weekend
by nabbing first place.
"We didn't do the things we
needed to do to beat them, and
when we didn't, Cal picked the
ball up and scored," said coach
Kay Cowperthwait.
The Cardinal has improved

immensely since its initial
games this season at the Santa
Barbara Shootout, where it
placed fourth and lost a game
to UOSanta Barbara. This
weekend Stanford beat UCSB
by a two-goal margin in the
second game Saturday.
Stanford has consistently
triumphed over Colorado,
which it demolished 10-5 in
the third Saturday contest. In
addition, the Cardinal soundly
routed UC-Davis 6-2 in Sun
day's semifinal. Previously,
games with Davis had been
close, decided by one goal and
sometimes going into over
time.
"Consistency has been a
problem all season, just get
ting the lead and maintaining
it," junior Hope Holiday said.
"We did that well against Davis
— we kept the lead and just
steamrolled them."
The Cardinal lost Saturday's
first game to Cal 9-7. Co-captain
Peppie Stephenson attributed
part of this loss to lack of alert
ness in the morning game.
On Sunday, after beating
Davis in the semifinals, the Car
dinal faced the Bears once more.
After a long weekend of travel
and stress, Stanford had a hard
time concentrating on its devel
oped skills.
"We had midfield problems,
the offense wasn't being run
well," Stephenson said. "We
weren't figuring out what we
needed to score. We just weren't
playing as a team."
California managed to capi
talize on many of the Stanford
errors, resulting in a final tally
of 10-3.
"Dropped balls and ground
balls are very important against
Cal because Cal is scrappy and
will capitalize on them," Cow
perthwait said.
She credited the defense with
a strong performance in the
tournament, especially sopho
more Daria Kramer, senior Han
nah Flatau and Stephenson. In
addition, she cited freshman
Carey Jones, in her first year of
lacrosse play, as a major asset in
the final Cal game.
After a break this weekend,
Stanford travels to Maryland
April 26-28, where the squad
will challenge Shippensburg,
Mt. St. Mary'sit and Ohio State
in their final games of the regu
lar season.
