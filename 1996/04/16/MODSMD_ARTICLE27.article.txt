# Have the NBA's stars been drained of all their magic?
## 
### 
I've always felt that profession
al athletes' egos were a little
too big for their own good, but
nothing drove that point home
like the episode I saw unfold Sun
day on TV during the Lakers-Suns
game.
I saw something I never
thought I'd see in all my years of
following Southern California
sports — I saw Magic Johnson lose
his cool.
Just days after publicly criticiz
ing Laker guard Nick Van Kxel for
losing his temper and shoving an
official onto the scorer's table,
Magic Johnson got in referee
Steve Foster's face after a missed
lay-up and earned himself an ejec
tion (and a probable suspension)
by bumping him with his chest.
Now, when Dennis Rodman
head-butts a ref, racking up a six
game suspension and a $20,000
fine in the process, 1 hardly bat an
eye. And when I read about Van
Exel's childish tirade (seven
games, $25,000) last week, my
first reaction was "Damn, I
thought he was smarter than
that," but I told myself it was just
a temper flare-up, a mistake that
wouldn't happen again.
But Magic?
This is one's of the game's most
popular, most amicable, most
well-loved players. An ambas

sador for the game of basketball. A
veteran, a leader, a floor general, a
guy who's supposed to keep the
kids in line. So what's going on
here?
Could it be that Magic is simply

succumbing to the greedy, selfish,
egotistical attitude that seems to
pervade the mindset of NBA play
ers? Is he beginning to take on the
same player mentality that he
cited as a reason for his stepping
down as head coach of the Lakers
two years ago?
To Johnson's credit, he did ac
knowledge his mistake and accept
responsibility.
"After looking at the replay, I
realize it was my fault; I got in his
way," he was quoted as saying.
"Although it wasn't intentional, I
should have gotten kicked out."

was probably no more than an un
intentional, momentary lapse of
reason by a super-competitive ath
lete in the midst of a playoff race,
it nonetheless served as an ugly re
minder of what's wrong with the
NBA today.
It's been said that there simply
aren't any superstars out there
today, enough guys with the tal
ent and charisma to carry the
league on their backs, the way

Magic, Michael and Larry did in
the '80s.
That theory holds up to some
extent. The league just doesn't
have any young, rising stars with
the commercial appeal of a Jordan
or a Johnson. Much of the talent
out there is still young and raw and
underdeveloped, many potential
stars are mired in losing franchises
and there aren't the consistently
dominant. teams and fierce rival
ries that existed ten years ago.
But the talent is there.
Shaquille O'Neal, Penny Hard
away, Jason Kidd, Alonzo Mourn
ing, Grant Hill, Joe Smith, Jerry

Stackhouse . . . the list goes on
and on. Problem is, most young
stars coming out of college forget
about things like teamwork, work
ethic and humility when they .sud
denly find themselves playing for
pay.
The problem is there in other
sports, of course, but it's not as ev
ident as in basketball, where col
lege hoops has all but surpassed
the NBA in mass appeal. And no
one seems to know who or what
can turn things around.
Funny, but I thought Magic's
return to the Lakers could do the
trick.
