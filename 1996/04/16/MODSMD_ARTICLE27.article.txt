# Have the NBA's stars been drained of all their magic?
## 
### 
I've always felt that profession
al athletes' egos were a little
too big for their own good, but
nothing drove that point home
like the episode I saw unfold Sun
day on TV during the Lakers-Suns
game.
I saw something I never
thought I'd see in all my years of
following Southern California
sports â€” I saw Magic Johnson lose
his cool.
Just days after publicly criticiz
ing Laker guard Nick Van Kxel for
losing his temper and shoving an
official onto the scorer's table,
Magic Johnson got in referee
Steve Foster's face after a missed
lay-up and earned himself an ejec
tion (and a probable suspension)
by bumping him with his chest.
Now, when Dennis Rodman
head-butts a ref, racking up a six
game suspension and a $20,000
fine in the process, 1 hardly bat an
eye. And when I read about Van
Exel's childish tirade (seven
games, $25,000) last week, my
first reaction was "Damn, I
thought he was smarter than
that," but I told myself it was just
a temper flare-up, a mistake that
wouldn't happen again.
But Magic?
This is one's of the game's most
popular, most amicable, most
well-loved players. An ambas

sador for the game of basketball. A
veteran, a leader, a floor general, a
guy who's supposed to keep the
kids in line. So what's going on
here?
Could it be that Magic is simply

succumbing to the greedy, selfish,
egotistical attitude that seems to
pervade the mindset of NBA play
ers? Is he beginning to take on the
same player mentality that he
cited as a reason for his stepping
down as head coach of the Lakers
two years ago?
To Johnson's credit, he did ac
knowledge his mistake and accept
responsibility.
"After looking at the replay, I
realize it was my fault; I got in his
way," he was quoted as saying.
"Although it wasn't intentional, I
should have gotten kicked out."
