# Varsity crew has perfect weekend
## Both the men and women run away with easy home victories 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The Stanford men's and
women's crew teams cruised to
victory during their first home
inect of the season. The men dom
inated their dual-meet opponents,
defeating Washington State and
UC-Irvine by convincing margins.
During the first race, Washing
ton State gained a slight advan
tage on the Cardinal. But by the
500-meter mark Stanford began
to move, taking the lead from the
Cougars by about half of a boat
length. At 1 200 meters, the Cardi
nal began a power 20, significant
ly increasing their stroke rate for
the next 20 strokes. Stanford con
tinued to distance itself from its
opponent, finishing well ahead of
the overpowered Cougars. The
following race against UC-Irvine
proved uneventful, as the Cardi
nal handily defeated the
Anteaters.
The junior varsity and novice
teams also performed well,
recording victories over both
Washington State and UC-Irvine.
"We progressed beyond what
we have been performing," said
men's captain Rob Bigler. "But
we know there is more we can do.

We are going to be fighting to
reach our full potential."
The women's team not only
beat UCLA, but also avenged an
earlier defeat to Washington
State by pulling out a three-sec -
ond victory over the Cougars. The
Cardinal took an early lead, gain
ing about a boat length on Wash
ington State after the first 500
meters. Stanford maintained that
advantage throughout the next
500 meters, at which time the
Cougars made their move, pulling
within half a boat length. The two
teams raced closely until
coxswain Nancy Bergtinsson de
cided to start the Cardinal sprint
early, regaining a boat length lead
and winning by that margin.
"I was very happy with the out
come," said coach Amy Baker.
"She [Bergtinsson] made a wise
choice to start the sprint early."
A crew boat consists of eight
rowers and a coxswain, who basi
cally acts as a coach on the water,
keeping the rowers in rhythm and
making sure the team maintains
proper technique. The crew must
act as a unit in order to quickly
complete the 2000-meter course,
and failure to do so may cost a
team several precious seconds.
The coxswain steers the 65-foot

boat from the rear, and is the only
member of the crew who actually
faces the finish line.
"We are like a coach on the
water because we see the blades of
all eight people," Bergtinsson
said. "I can see specifically what
each person is doing."
Through the first three weeks
of the season, both the men's and
women's teams have consistently
improved. Both Cardinal squads
opened the season by defeating
UC-Santa Barbara. The following
week, Stanford competed in the
San Diego Classic, featuring top
schools from across the nation.
Once again both teams performed
admirably, with the men finishing
ninth while the women placed
sixth. The women's novice team,
consisting of up-and-coming stars,
finished third in their division.
Last weekend both Stanford
crews easily overcame UC-Davis,
setting the stage for their pivotal
home meet last Saturday.
The teams will travel north
this weekend to challenge Oregon
State, and each squad will look to
continue the success they have
currently enjoyed.
"We have to make sure we are
up for this weekend," Baker said.
"We need to maintain our speed."
