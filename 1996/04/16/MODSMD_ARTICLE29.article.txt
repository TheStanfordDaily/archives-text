# Institute gets $100,000 grant
## Money will be used to establish medical research center 
### Amy Slucter Staff writer 
The Institute for Research on
Women and Gender recently re
ceived a $100,000 grant to establish
a new gender-based medical re
search center.
According to Iris F. Litt, director
of the Center on Gender-Based
Medical Research, the grant will
allow people from different disci
plines to work together on issues of
women's health. The need for a
multi-disciplinary approach, she
said, reflects the fact that women
have a diverse range of health
needs.
"There Ls a major deficit in our
knowledge about women and the
physiological needs of women," Litt
said. "It is going to be critically im
portant to look at women's health
across the life span."
The center could contribute to
major research on mapping the dif
ferent physiological changes that
occur in women during the course of
the menstrual cycle and on the in
teraction between women and drug
dosage, said Litt.
In addition, the center could be

responsible for destroying com
mon myths. According to Litt,
since 1986 medical professionals
have known that more women die
from lung cancer than from breast
cancer. In order to address this
issue the center could use a variety
of approaches.
"We need to study health behav
ior and help women identify with
the importance of not smoking.
This could involve education and
psychology," Litt said explaining
that the center will try to utilize all
of the University's resources.
"We hope to bring together peo
ple around the campus who have
different resources to bring to bear
in filling our gap on the health needs
of women," she said.
The location of the center, Litt
explained, has become a symbolic
issue. She said while it might be lo
cated at the institute or at the
School of Medicine, it will most like
ly be located somewhere in between.
This year Litt and her colleagues
plan to meet with various people
around campus to discover the in
terests of different communities
and to establish goals and objec
tives.

"The first step is to find out who
is doing what out there," Litt said.
"We must find out what's happen
ing at the government level, in acad
emia and in industry so that we do
not duplicate."
According to Litt, there is a need
for ongoing collaboration at the
local and the national level. She
said it is often difficult to get an ad
equate number of research subjects
from one sight. Collaboration al
lows researchers to have ethnic and
socio-economic diversity.
"Although we know very little
about women's health, the very lit
tle we do know is biased on middle
class white women who are more
likely to volunteer for such studies,"
Litt said. "How we stimulate minor
ity women to participate is mi im
portant challenge."
Litt expects that the center will
provide research and learning op
portunities for students and that
grants for junior faculty-researcher
positions will be established. By in
volving a larger community, Litt
said she hopes the center will be able
to fulfill its mission to address
women's health in a broader and
ongoing way.
