# Fac Sen will consider new computer policy

### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
In a step to end Funda
mental Standard viola
tions in Stanford's elec
tronic media, the Faculty
Senate will examine a new
University computer
usage policy Thursday.
The policy outlines the
responsibility of Stanford
computer users "not to

abuse the network and resources and to re
spect the privacy and intellectual property
rights of others."
Assoc. Biochemistry Prof. Douglas Brut
lag, chair of the Distributed Information and
Computer Environment Committee, said
with so many more people using Stanford's
computer system and the ease in copying doc
uments and programs, it is easy for individu
als to lose sight of property rights.
"People who are managing need to have
defined sets of rules so when they see people

doing unusual things, they know what is
proper and improper," Brutlag said.
"People think twice about walking into an
office and tiiking files or papers. We need to
equate taking papers electronically with that
kind of misbehavior," he added.
The policy outlines who the new policy ap
plies to, how Stanford users should deal with
copyrights, licensing and information re
sources, as well as with issues of privacy and
the consequences of misuse of the policy.
Computer Security Officer Stephen
Hansen originally chaired an ad hoc commit
tee of system administrators trying to outline
an acceptable use policy about four years ago.
Since then, he said, the policy has undergone
several changes to deal with the problems.
"There was no policy we could follow â€” we
either had to use load policies, but from the
standpoint of the users it was not often clear
there was an Honor Code violation," Hansen
said.
Brutlag said, "Most people know whether

they are doing the right thing or
not. We just need to be clear that
improper behavior will be treated
the same as in other media."
The policy includes "policy viola
tion scenarios" and alternatives
that do not violate the policy. Brut
lag said he will go through the poli
cy in the senate meeting and he
hopes the scenarios will spark dis
cussion.
One example of a violation sce
nario includes a faculty member
leaving a copy of individually li
censed software on a public folder
so colleagues can use it to read doc
uments in the same folder. Brutlag
suggested that to avoid a violation,

the documents can instead be post
ed on the World Wide Web or dis
tributed through another freely
available program.
Brutlag added that the policy is
very general because Stanford is
susceptible to changing state and
local laws. He said students will be
informed of the policies and asked
to abide by them when they open le
land accounts.
Enforcement of the policy falls
under the Honor Code and the Fun
damental Standard, the rules gov
erning conduct at Stanford.
Brutlag said that until now, vio
lations of the policy have been dealt
with by system administrators,
who did not have documented poli
cies and had to bring cases to the at
tention of the University judicial
system.
