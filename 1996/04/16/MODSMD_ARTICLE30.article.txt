## Sorry...it stands for 'Sophomores and Merrymaking' 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Mad, maniacal merrymaking will be the spirit of
next year's sophomore class if "S&M" has anything to
do with it.
As the only slate running for sophomore class pres
idents this year, freshmen Mina Bak, Mike Martinez,
Courtney Schroeder and Tom Terbell are planning
for a fun-filled sophomore year.
"S&M," which stands for "Sophomores and Mer
rymaking," plans to work on increasing class unity if
elected in the spring general election, held tomorrow
and Thursday.
"Our main theme will be class unity," Schroeder
said. "We want to get everyone involved and establish
some class traditions."
This year is the first year that class presidents for
classes other than the senior class have existed. The
current sophomore class presidents instituted a
sophomore newsletter and held events in White
Plaza.
This year's slate plans to build on those founda

tions to make several activities — a class formal,
study breaks in White Plaza, a picnic at the Oval and
community service projects — into traditions.
"We are into our class having fun and really getting
to know each other," Martinez said.
In addition, the slate plans to hold sophomore
movie nights, study breaks and spirit events.
Ifelected, members ofthe slate plan to use their ex
perience as dorm government leaders toward serving
their class better.
"We'd like to use our creativity and leadership
skills to strengthen and unify the sophomore class,"
Martinez said.
Martinez added that the slate is still campaigning
vigorously even though it is running unopposed.
"We have campaigned gung-ho for the position,"
he said. "We really want it although we are unop
posed."
Slate members also expressed an interest in
hearing every student's input on possible class
events.
Accordingto their statement in theASSU elections
handbook, "The more the merrier."
