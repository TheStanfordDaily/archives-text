# Charter under exam
## Committee of 15 to complete review by fall 
### Paul Bodnar Staff writer 
The Committee of 15 has begun
redrafting the University's leg-

islative and Judicial Charter by soliciting input from
the Stanford community about the current Judicial
Affairs process.
Charged by University President Gerhard Casper
with creating a new, less bureaucratic and time-con
suming charter, the committee hopes to draft a new
judicial charter by fall quarter, according to commit
tee coordinator Laurette Bceson.
The committee sent e-mail letters to faculty and
students last weekend requesting feedback on the ef
fectiveness, fairness and visibility of the current pol
icy.
The letters emphasize the committee's focus on
educational issues, asking students and faculty if
they feel adequately informed about the "content
and significance" of the Honor Code and Fundamen
tal Standard and whether they are aware of what
constitutes a violation of either.
In addition, the committee is seeking opinions on
the comprehensibility and fairness of the current ju
dicial charter and suggestions for ways the Universi
ty can "discourage academic dishonesty."
Junior Howard Loo, one of six students serving on
the committee, explained that both Casper and t he
committee are concerned that the 28-year-old docu
ment is too cumbersome.
"The charter in its current form is very hard to un
derstand," he said. "It is overly legalistic and wordy.
One of our major goals is to get students involved in
the process of adjudicating these matters."
Instead of automatically revising the disciplinary
processes of the Judicial Council, the committee is in
vestigating the causes of Honor Code and Funda

mental Standard violations.
Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback, the chair of the
committee, said "the Honor Code ought to be a part
of an educational process. If we are failing to educate
students and faculty about the contents [of the
Honor Code], then we should be seeking an educa
tional remedy rather than a disciplinary one."
Zoback added that feedback from students and
faculty is essential to producing an effective docu
ment that will serve the community well. "Before we
go trying to reinvent the system, we have a lot of fact
finding to do," he said.
Beeson, who is staffing the Committee of 15, said,
"We are trying to find a way to make the process more
visible. We wanted to hear from as many people as
possible regarding their perceptions of the process
and their suggestions for change."
Members of the community have until April 30 to
respond to the query.
The committee will hold weekly conferences with
administrators currently involved in the Judicial Af
fairs process. Casper, Dean of Students Marc Wais
and Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds are all scheduled to testify before the com
mittee later this quarter.
Beeson said t he committee also hopes to "examine
t he judicial systems of comparable universities" later
t his quarter. When the draft is completed in the fall,
t he new document will be presented to the communi
ty for evaluation. The final draft must be ratified by
the ASSU Senate, the Faculty Senate and Casper.
The six students originally appointed to the com
mittee in November by the ASSU Nominat ions Com
mission resigned due to time conflicts and were re
placed by Loo, sophomores Danny Bramzon and
Brian Lee, freshman Katherine Loo and Robert Liv
ingston, a graduate student in chemistry. The sixth
student member has vet to be named.
