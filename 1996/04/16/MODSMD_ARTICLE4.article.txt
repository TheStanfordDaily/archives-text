nouncing a long-awaited initiative which
will bring self-defense classes back to cam
pus.
The classes will be offered to both men

Women's Center, said thecenter is thrilled
the University is supporting the initiative.
"They are providing a very needed ser
vice," Howell said.
Howell said the center is not disap

ways we could keep the classes for all
women, but we realize the need is great for
men â€” women can use these classes as a
way of regaining their voices."
In the fall of 1993, Title IX charges were
brought against the women-only self-de
fense class offered on campus by the
Women Defending Ourselves Collective.
