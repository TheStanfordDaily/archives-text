# University to support self-defense initiative
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
Vice Provost and Dean for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds helped kick off the
Herstory celebration yesterday by an
nouncing a long-awaited initiative which
will bring self-defense classes back to cam
pus.
The classes will be offered to both men
and women through Cowell Student
Health Center.
Marya Howell, coordinator for the
Women's Center, said thecenter is thrilled
the University is supporting the initiative.
"They are providing a very needed ser
vice," Howell said.
Howell said the center is not disap
pointed that the classes will be coeduca
tional. "We have tried many options of
ways we could keep the classes for all
women, but we realize the need is great for
men — women can use these classes as a
way of regaining their voices."
In the fall of 1993, Title IX charges were
brought against the women-only self-de
fense class offered on campus by the
Women Defending Ourselves Collective.
Title IX of the Education Amend
ments of 1972 prohibits gender
discrimination by schools receiv
ing federal funding.
As a result, the popular class
was forced off campus after much
controversy. It is now offered out
side the University.
"We didn't want these classes
to take the place of the Women
Defending Ourselves — those
classes will still be offered, and
they serve an important need,"
Howell said.
Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe said there are two
major parts to the program — the
creation of student-led workshops
and the "rethinking of the printed
pieces we hand out."
Howe said two- to three-hour
workshops involving hands-on
training will be offered through
out the year, but most of the class
es will be offered at the beginning
of the school vear during Orienta

tion activities. There will also be
programs for entering graduate
students.
"We are hoping to recruit stu
dents to lead the classes and get
them professional training from
experienced trainers," Howe said.
"This core group of students will
go through intensive training,
then they can go into other
venues, do programs in a resi
dence or in the Women's Center."
Howe said the program will
also revamp the way self-defense
information is disseminated. "We
want to provide one coordinated
place where we can give real tips
about how to be safe on campus,"
Howe said.
Funding will come from the Of
fice of the Vice Provost and Dean
for Student Affairs. "I am very
glad to support this," Edmonds
said. "We hope to begin to imple
ment our programs this quarter."
She said her office will contribute
about $5,000 to the initiative.
Director of Health Promotion
Services Carole Pertofsky said she
felt the program would be a real
asset to student life.

"Since we lost Women Defend
ing Ourselves, we have been try
ing to put together a patchwork so
that some self-defense could be of
fered — now we have one that is
University-funded," Pertofsky
said.
Sally Baird, manager of Sexual
Assault Prevention Services at
Cowell, said organizers want to
meet tne needs of both men and
women. "This is a good, basic self
defense class. There are options
for same-sex training off cam
pus," Baird said. "We couldn't dis
criminate, so we looked to see
what we could do with a coed
model."
Baird added that the develop
ment of the student trainer group
is part of Cowell's long-range
goals.
"We are trying to increase stu
dent involvement at Cowell," she
said. "A core group of students
doing peer education will accom
plish this."
Baird said the new initiative is
a pilot program, and Cowell will
examine the program to identify
problems and strengths.
