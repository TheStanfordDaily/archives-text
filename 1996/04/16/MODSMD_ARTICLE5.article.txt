## 
### Therese Lee 
A ceremony of music, dancing and
personal narrative hailed the beginning
of Herstory 1996 at noon yesterday in
White Plaza.
The annual event, put on by a com
mittee under the guidance of the
Women's Collective, aims to facilitate
discourse on issues relevant to women
in the Stanford community and in the
world.
After a performance by tne ail-female
a cappella group Counterpoint, Cathy
Rion, one of the event coordinators, in
troduced Herstory as a "challenge to the
universal .story of history."
"This is a celebration of women rind
ing our voices," Rion said. "This is a
striving to create a space for women to
tell t heir stories."
Vice Provost and Dean for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
was the keynote speaker. Ed
monds began by announcing a
new women's self-defense initia
tive to be funded by her office.
She then spoke about the pivotal
moments in her life that had
brought her to Stanford and fos
tered her attachment to the Her
story celebration.
Edmonds told of ridingon a seg
regated train to Georgia under Jim
Crow laws, describing it as "humil
iating, uncomfortable, demeaning
and ego-shattering."

"That was my introduction to
segregation," Edmonds said. "But
it sensitized me to the issues of race
and unequal treatment of people of
color in our country."
As "one who has been there and
done that," Edmonds traced her
career in higher education from
being a student at Spelman College
in Montgomery, Ala., to her deci
sion to assume the position of vice
president of student resources at
Stanford despite the "earth
quakes, mud slides, fires and on
and on."
The ceremonies closed with a
performance by Los Decanos, a
student Brazilian-dance group.
Herstory runs through April 28.
Upcoming events include an ap
pearance by keynote speaker An
gela Davis, a longtime political ac

tivist for prisoners' rights. Davis
was recently elected to the board of
directors of the National Black
Women's Health Project. She will
deliver an address titled "Embrac
ing Diversity" in Tresidder Union
on April 26.
Everyone is welcome to con
tribute to a Herstory expression
board on display throughout the
events. A photography exhibit, ti
tled "Celebrating Stanford
Women: Perspectives from Stu
dent Artists," will be on display on
the second floor of Tresidder and in
the Women's Center.
"I hope the college campus as a
whole will learn to embrace
women's issues as well as those
concerning gender," said Christina
Velasco, a staff member of the Her
story committee.
