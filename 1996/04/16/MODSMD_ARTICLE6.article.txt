# Slate of grad students wants to 'run the zoo'
## 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
A wild jungle
of exotic crea
tures and
strange beings,
the ASSU needs
to venture into
new lands and L
explore new ideas.

This is the vision of "If I Ran the
Zoo," a Council of Presidents slate
running in this week's spring gen
eral election composed of graduate
students Chris Hoffman, Amit
Mehta, Emily Osborn and Trisha
Tang.
The slate takes its name and in
spiration from the popular Dr.
Seuss book, "If I Ran the Zoo."
"The poem embodies many of the
goals we'd like to reach," Mehta said.
"We'd like to repopulate the zcxi wit h
exotic creatures (graduate students).
The ASSU gui afford to take new
risks and explore new ideas."
This goal and the slate's unique
position as the only slate composed
of graduate students create a
tremendous opportunity for gradu
ate studenss and undergraduate
students alike, according to slate
members.
"We ar the undergraduates' fu
ture," Mehta said. "We are not run
ning on behalf of the graduate stu
dents; we are running on behalf of
all."
Slate members stressed that
undergraduates should see the
potential benefits of an all-gradu

ate-st udent COP.
"We have been undergradu
ates," said Hoffman, a graduate
student in mathematics. "We know
their concerns. But undergradu
ates have never been graduate stu
dents. Since we've lived through
their experience, we are in a better
position to represent them."
The slate aims "to shatter the
aura of undergraduate exclusive
ness at Stanford," Mehta said,
claiming that many issues, such as
food service, TV charges and Honor
Code reform, cross the border be
tween graduates and undergradu
ates.

'We are not running
on behalf of the
graduate students;
we are running on
behalf of all.'

"We'd like to work with the ad
ministration to take a long-term
view," Mehta said. "It's not good to
make students feel slighted or
pinched for funds."
The slate aims to restore the
watchdog role of the COP, provid
ing better communication between
students and the administration,
according to Mehta.
