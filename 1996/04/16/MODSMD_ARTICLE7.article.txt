Their motto reads, "Neighbor helping
neighbor, people helping people."
Through the Stanford branch of the
national organization, Christmas in
April, students are hoping to bring this
motto to life in their upcoming renova
tion of East Palo Alto's Green Oaks
Academy. The renovations of Green
Oaks, a kindergarten-to-third grade
magnet school for minorities, will take
place April 27.
Christmas in April began in 1973 in
Midland, Texas, but it didn't hit the na
tional scene until 1988, according to
sophomore Rachel Acuna, coordinator of
the Stanford branch of Christmas in
April.
Northern California picked up the
program in 1990. Christmas in April's
purpose, said Acuna, is to provide low-in
come, disabled and elderly people with a
safe, warm and comfortable existence by
renovating owner-occupied homes and
non-profit facilities such as schools.
Last year, in the first year at Stan
ford, the Christmas in April team reno
vated Garfield Elementary School in
Redwood City one Saturday. The head
advising associate of Arroyo House initi
ated the program and brought most of
Arroyo with him on the day of the reno
vation. About 200 people arrived and
were assigned to tasks of painting and
landscaping.
This year, said Acuna, there will be
less painting and more construction.
Green Oaks needs picnic tables, benches,
basketball courts, tether ball courts and
doors between classrooms.
In deciding what site to renovate,

Christmas in April board members sort
through applications received from the
various locations. Contractors thorough
ly examine each site. Need and availabili
ty of resources are also considered. Usu
ally, a company sponsors a house. A
house captain is appointed and becomes
the liaison between the contractors and
volunteers.
"Every site they pick is in sore need of
renovation. Most of the buildings and
homes are pretty old too, which con
tributes to their shabby condition," said
Acuna.
Student coordinators such as Acuna
take over after the appointment of the
house captain. Acuna said she began her
work in January by meeting with Christ
inas in April board members. Then, she,
along with 10 other University students
who are members of the core team, re
cruited volunteers and solicited dona
tions. They visited Green Oaks to figure
out what could be done with the re
sources available.
Acuna claimed that the members of
the core team do more than their share of
work.
"I can take hardly any of the credit.
They'll have an equal responsibility of
being team leaders when it gets to Christ
mas in April day," said Acuna.
Community members also participate
in the effort. Last year, local residents
showed up in full force to support the ren
ovation of Garfield Elementary. They
worked alongside students and contrac
tors.

school, said the metamorphosis of
a site can be amazing.
"I remember this grandmoth
er. They took her away for the day
because of all of the people run
ning through her house. When
they brought her back, she was so
shocked. It was so different."
During a break last year, the
volunteers enjoyed authentic
Mexican lunches prepared by par
ents and community members. A
local singer also entertained them
while they ate.
"I hope the parents do some

thing again this year to show their
support. I know it's a low-income
area so many of them have Satur
day jobs, but I know everybody
will try to make the best effort,"
said Acuna.
This year, the Christmas in
April team is hoping to find 100
volunteers in addition to raising
$2,500 to help cover expenses.
Christmas in April coordinators
are currently providing all dorms
with registration information.
Students now have the option of
working a full or half day at the
site because the leaders realize
that some people do not have time
to sacrifice a full day.
"We won't tLirn down any vol
unteers," said Tseng.
