The clearest road to ASSU re
form remained a topic of dis
agreement at a televised debate
last night between the four slates
running for the Council of Presi
dents.
The debate — a discussion be-

tween the slates "If I Ran the Zoo," "For Heal,""I
Prefer To Have a Single President" and"The Dicta
tors from Space" — highlighted the issues of struc
tural change and the leadership qualifications nec
essary to achieve t hat change.
At the forefront of the evening was the issue of
"Constitution '96."


Lunnon Miles — Daily
Members of the"I Prefer to Have a Single President" Council of Presidents slate — from left to right,
freshmen Joe Pawson and David Guendelman, sophomore Steve Liu and freshman Peter Vlastelica
— share their views in last night's televised COP debate as SCBN camerawoman Amina Gautier
records their every move.

"Stanford needs one president,
one voice, one leader," said David
Guendelman, a member of the"I
Prefer To Have a Single President"
slate. The slate endorses "Consti
tution '96" and is running on the
platform of a single president.
"Constitution '96" is a pro
posed amendment to the ASSU
Constitution which recently won
approval from the ASSU Senate
for placement on the spring gen
eral election ballot. The election
runs today and tomorrow.
The amendment would create a
new ASSU Constitution by re
placing the current four-member
COP with a single president, re
ducing the number of senators
from 40 to 30 and creating a judi
cial branch of the ASSU. Two
thirds of voters must approve the
bill in order for it to take effect.
"We are at a tremendous cross
roads in the future of the COP,"
said current ASSU Deputy Senate
Chair Bill Shen, a member of the
"For Real" slate. "We are commit
ted to whatever reforms students
want."
Members of the"I Prefer To

Have a Single President" slate list
ed several problems — structural
inefficiency, a lack of accountabili
ty and disagreement between the
presidents — which they believe a
four-person COP creates.
"Stanford is the only major uni
versity to have a council of presi
dents rather than a single presi
dent," Guendelman said. "A single
president would restore credibility
and legitimacy to the ASSU."
The students elected to carry
out the reforms — not reform it
self — should be at the heart of
the issue, according to members
of the"For Real" slate.
"Whether it is one idiot, four
idiots or 44 idiots it doesn't really
matter how many people [make
up the COPI, it is who you elect,"
said Shen.
Shen said he is confident his
slate is best positioned to carry
out students' wishes for reform
and questioned whether the"I
Prefer To Have a Single Presi
dent" slate has enough leadership
experience.
"You say that you will not re
sign until a single president is
elected. What happens in the in
terim? What happens when the
COP is called upon to serve?"
asked Shen.
If elected, members of the"I

Prefer To Have a Single Presi
dent" slate said they will formu
late an advisory council of ASSU
leaders to aid them in their lead
ership and move to implement a
single president system as quickly
as possible.
Debate also centered on what
benefits each slate's members
would bring to the COP.
Members of "If I Ran the Zoo,"
a slate composed of graduate stu
dents, said their slate would best
represent both graduates and un
dergraduates.
"We are your future; you are
our past," said Amit Mehta, a
graduate student in biophysics.
"There has been a major miscom
munication between graduates
and undergraduates. We would
like to shatter the aura of under
graduate exclusiveness."
A fresh approach is the best
way to achieve change, according
to members of the"I Prefer To
Have a Single President" slate,
three of whom are in their first
year at Stanford.
"We honestly believe that we
need a single president," said
freshman Pete Vlastelica. "The
fact that we've seen that in our
first year means we believe in
what we are doing."
But members of the"For Real"

slate said they believe that a bal
ance of ASSU experience and in
experience would best expedite re
form.
"I don't think that being a part
of the ASSU as it is now means
that we are numb to getting
things done," said Angela Parker,
who, along with Shen, is one of
the two members of the slate with
ASSU experience. "Our ASSU ex
perience helps us to understand it
in a way that outsiders cannot
comprehend."
Members of the"The Dictators
from Space" slate argued that an
extraterrestrial perspective
would lend the golden touch to
ASSU reform.
"Our best quality is that we
have no experience with the
ASSU Senate," said senior Sean
Kennedy. "We have your inter
ests, not ours in mind. Our inter
ests are on another goddamn
planet."
The debate, held at the studios
of the Stanford Cardinal Broad
casting Network, consisted of
opening statement s by each slate, a
question-and-answer period and a
period of free debate by slate mem
bers. The debate was moderated by
Tudor Havriliuc, SCBN executive
director, and Liz Murtaugh, an
ASSU beat writer for The Daily.
