## 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
The clearest road to ASSU re
form remained a topic of dis
agreement at a televised debate
last night between the four slates
running for the Council of Presi
dents.
The debate — a discussion be-

tween the slates "If I Ran the Zoo," "For Heal,""I
Prefer To Have a Single President" and"The Dicta
tors from Space" — highlighted the issues of struc
tural change and the leadership qualifications nec
essary to achieve t hat change.
At the forefront of the evening was the issue of
"Constitution '96."
