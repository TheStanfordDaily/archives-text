Kaczynski's lawyer requests delay
HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Theodore Kaczynski's lawyer asked a judge to block the
prosecution of the Unabomber suspect, saying yesterday that government leaks have
jeopardized his chances for a fair trial.
Michael Donahoe said the release of information from unidentified federal
sources demonstrates a "lynch-mob mentality" on thi' part of federal investigators.
The result was a "lethal media blitz" that "poisoned the entire population of grand
jurors within the United States against Mr. Kaczynski," he wrote in his motion.
Donahue, one of two court-appointed attorneys for Kaczynski, said the prosecu
tion should be halted until the court can decide whether the leaks will prevent a fair
trial.
"The government should not be allowed to proceed before various grand juries
throughout the country that have been permanently poisoned by the government's
outrageous conduct in disclosing to the media the highly incriminating nature of evi
dence taken from Kaczynski's cabin," Donahoe said.
"In Mr. Kaczynski's case, the possibility that he could ever be afforded anything
that might remotely resemble that (fair trial) process has been forever lost."
U.S. District Judge Charles Lovell did not immediately rule on Donahoe's peti
tion, which sought a delay in any grand jury proceedings against Kaczynski.
