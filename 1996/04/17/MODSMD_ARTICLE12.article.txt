BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli heli
copter gunships targeted Lebanon's
largest Palestinian refugee camp yester
day, widening their six-day-old onslaught
against Iranian-backed guerrillas. Israeli
aircralt also bombarded Beirut, killing a 2-
year-old girl, after a rocket attack on
northern Israel.
Despite a flurry of diplomatic activity
involving the United Suites, France find
other countries, there was no sign of a
letup in Israel's offensive aimed at stop
ping the attacks by I lezbollah guerrillas.
From hideouts in the valleys of south
Lebanon, the guerrillas fired more volleys
of Katyusha rockets into northern Israel,
drawing more Israeli airstrikes.
Five civilians, including the 2-year-old
girl, were killed and 20 wounded yester
day. All told, 46 people have been killed —

including three Hezbollah guerrillas —
and 166 wounded on both sides since the
hostilities began Thursday.
Most of the dead have been Lebanese
civilians.
Among the wounded was a Fijian cap
tain with the U.N. peacekeeping force in
south Lebanon, who was shot Monday
when he challenged guerrillas preparing to
fire rockets on Israel, the U.N. force said.
The attack yesterday on the Ein el-
Hilweh refugee camp near the port of
Sidon was the first on a Palestinian target
since Israel began the offensive.
The three Cobra gunships fired six
rockets, gutting the house of Palestinian
guerrilla leader Col. Munir Makdah, who
escaped unhurt, police said. Two of his
bodyguards and one of their wives was
wounded.

Makdah opposed the 1993 peace accord
between the Palestine Liberation Organi
zation and Israel, and broke from the
group to form his own militia. He later
allied with Hezbollah.
Israel hopes its raids, which have forced
400,000 refugees — 10 percent of
Lebanon's population — to flee north
toward Beirut, will pressure Lebanon and
Syria, the dominant power in the country,
to disarm Hezbollah.
For years, Hezbollah has attacked
Israeli troops and fired rockets at northern
Israel to drive Israeli troops from a zone in
southern they control to curb
cross-border attacks.
The guerrillas fired a barrage of
Katyusha rockets on Israel's northern
Galilee panhandle again yesterday morn
ing.
