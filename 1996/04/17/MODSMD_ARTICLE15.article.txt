## ENDORSEMENTS A 						single president 
### 
THIS WEEK students will
choose among four distinct
Council of President slates,
each with a different solution to the
ASSU's leadership problems.
But only one slate focuses on the
real culprit — the structure of stu
dent government itself.
The members of "I Prefer to
Have a Single President" aren't
ASSU insiders, but they do know
four co-presidents are no substitute
for a strong executive. Their one
campaign promise: to eliminate the
COP
For an organization that has con
sistently opposed reform, such a
change would be revolutionary.
If elected, "Prefer" would focus
on giving Stanford students a sin
gle, accountable leader. If Consti
tution '96 fails, the members of
"Prefer" would immediately start
collecting signatures needed to
call a special referendum on the

single president issue.
It didn't have to come to this. Stu
dents have long complained about
the COP's ineffectiveness, but the
ASSU has done nothing to reform
itself, even after voters four years
ago elected a slate that promised to
do — and indeed did — nothing.
Since then, its leaders have stymied
attempts at executive reform, con
vinced that four leaders are always
better than one.
By electing "I Prefer to Have a
Single President," voters would give
the ASSU its best shot at revamping
an executive branch that is so fun
damentally flawed that the very
legitimacy of Stanford student gov
ernment has been questioned.
"Prefer" slate members David
Guendelman, Steven Liu, Joseph
Pawson and Peter Vlastelica may be
campaigning on only one issue, but
it's the right one. They deserve your
vote.

A single president would elimi

ering, while a smaller senate —
though some argue would be less
representative — would allow for
demonstrated diversity in actual
votes. And a judicial branch would
keep abuses of power in check.
These changes would strength
en the ASSU and streamline its
operations. Students should sup
port it.

Those interested in
the ASSU know it is in
chronic need of reform. No
changes yet proposed have been as
comprehensive as those outlined in
Constitution '96.
The amendment would alter
the operations of the ASSU in
three ways: by eliminating the
Council of Presidents, replacing
it with a single president and vice
president, shrinking the senate
to 30 voting members and creat-
