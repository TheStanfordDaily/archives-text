## Parable of a nuclear dump 
### 
WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I spent
summer afternoons heaping
snakes, salamanders and frogs
into boxes filled with rocks, insects and
slime. Every time I returned from an
afternoon hunt in the Maine woods, over
flowing with black snakes, I'd find my
mother and ask for permission to store
my new catch in the house.
My mother originally made me store
them in my room. However, she soon
realized that allowing a small, ferment
ing child (who liked to run from wall to
wall swatting tennis balls with a hockey
stick) to coexist in small quarters with a
bucket of mud and reptiles was as good
for general serenity as allowing the Stan
ford Band to practice in the corner of
your eardrum.
Within a few weeks, we had a bucket of
garter snakes in the kitchen, ajar of frogs
in the dining room, a few salamanders in
my sister's bathtub and a herd of meal
worms in the fridge to feed to lizards
imported by a friend from Florida.
For a while, the new system worked.
However, as time passed, the law of aver
ages worked its wonders and catastrophes
struck. A bucket of slime ended on top of
the telephone, a garter snake took a nap in
my sister's shoe and a frog found a home in
the oven. Still, every time 1 returned from
the woods with a new catch, I'd tell my
mother there was nothing else we could do
but store them in the house. I couldn't
return them to the woods richt then

because 1 had to play soccer in five min
utes. I couldn't return them the next day
because they'd be confused. I couldn't just
let them loose in the backyard because
they'd crawl into our hermit neighbor's
cabin and frighten him out of his Niet
zsche. They simply had to live with us.
Each time, she caved in and worked with
me to find a new "least bad" place for
them.
Finally, my mother decided to take a
stand. One day after I returned from the
woods with a farrago of toads, she stood
in the doorway and told me enough was
enough. I pleaded with her and explained
that I simply had to put them some
where, reeling off the usual excuses to no
avail. She refused, my soccer game
approached and I grew flustered as I
imagined the impending travesty.
Finally, we made a deal: I could store
one last canteen of toads on the television
if I promised to stop collecting the damn
things and bringing them into the house.
Think about nuclear waste; it's the
same situation. The nuclear industry is
the fermenting young boy with the toads.
We need to play the role of my mother.
No one has any idea what to do with
nuclear waste and every time we create
more of it we end up having to stick it in
the ground somewhere potentially per
ilous because we can't just store it at the
facility where it's created.
There are differences of course. My
snake hunting wasn't given massive sub

sidies by the Department of Energy at the
expense of more astute options like solar
power. I didn't have billions of dollars in
lawyers, Congressmen and statistics to
sway my mother with. I wasn't dumping
the slime on Native American sacred
sites.
Today, Governor Pete Wilson wants to
build a nuclear waste dump in Ward Val
ley — a beautiful portion of the Mojave
Desert, land sacred to five Native Ameri
can Tribes, near an aquifer that leads to
the Colorado river and home to an endan
gered desert tortoise that is the last
remaining species from the dinosaur era.
The dump will be run by US Ecology — a
corporation with a history Senator Bar
bara Boxer has compared to the Ebola
Virus.
Instead of asking ourselves where else
we can put the waste, we need to stand in
the doorway in front of Governor Wilson
and his toads. We need to tell him, and
everyone else who wins elections with
funding from these dumps, that enough
is enough. We won't work to help find a
solution to our current waste until a rea
sonable method of disposal is discovered
or a deal is made to stop creating the
stuff.
