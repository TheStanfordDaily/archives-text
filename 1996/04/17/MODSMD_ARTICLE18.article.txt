# Special- and general-fee endorsements
## 
### 
TO MAKE INFORMED special-fee endorsements, members of The Daily's Ecii
torial Board met with representatives of each fee-seeking group. In making its
endorsements, the board used five guiding criteria:
• Does the group provide good value for the dollar?
• Does the group make a conscientious and reasonably successful effort to involve
and serve a significant portion of the student body population that funds it?
• Does the group demonstrate initiative in self-funding; that is, does its budget indi
cate that the group is actively seeking revenue sources other than the special fee?
• Has the group responded to its refund rate and the results of last year's elections?
• Should the student body population targeted to fund the group's special fee — and
not the University, a different population or other parties — be financing the group?
Groups that met only some criteria received a "without recommendation."
Groups with which The Daily did not meet received a "no recommendation."
The annual costs per student are indicated in parentheses; they were calculated
using the number of registration commitments filed for the current quarter: 13,549
total students, of whom 6,348 are undergraduates and 7,201 are graduate students. A
"B" prior to that amount indicates that the fee will be assessed to both undergradu
ates and graduate students; a "UO" indicates that the fee will be assessed to under
graduates only. For more information on The Daily's endorsements, point your web
