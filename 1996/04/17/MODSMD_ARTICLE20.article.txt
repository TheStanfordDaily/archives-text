### 
AS A GRADUATING SENIOR, I can
say honestly I've had a delightful
Stanford experience. I've been rea
sonably satisfied with my courses, my fellow
students, my life while I 've been here. Every
winter break, I go back to my high school
and give a very sincere and positive review
of Stanford. I wholeheartedly support the
I niversity's efforts to incorporate a multi
plicity of viewpoints into its liberal arts cur
riculum Hell, I even liked CIV. And come
August, I have a job.
In short, I fit the profile of a good solid
alumni donor perfectly.
Except I will not donate money to Stan
ford. Period.
"Hut surely you have just $19.96?" cries
the unsuspecting sophomore caller from the
Stanford Fund with the bad fortune to get
stuck with my name.
"But you love Stanford!" cry my unsus
pecting friends on the terribly tenacious
Senior (!ifl committee.
"You wouldn't feel so strongly alx>ut this
that you would, say, write a column?" wor
ries my all-too-suspecting friend Susan,
once a big-time student executive with the

Stanford Fund.
Yes, yes mid yes, respectively. But no on
the Senior Gift. For the simple reason that I
feel I've already given large sums of money
to the University, above and beyond tuition.
The University has a captive audience,
virtually required to pay any little charge it
demands. And, in my experience, most
Stanford departments are not at all reluc
tant to exploit this, to bleed dry the ultimate
financiers of the University — undergradu
ates. Not only are students required to pay
fees and service charges on top of their
$25,000 each year, but the prevailing pre
sumption among University bureaucracy
seems to t>e that undergraduates have piles
of money to spare.
Quite frankly, I've already donated my
Senior Gift.
I've donated $'25 each time I took a ten
nis class. And then I've turned around
donated to the Department of Athletics for
student football and basketball tickets. Not
to mention those $30 Big Game tickets.
I've donated $ 1.30 to the University each
time I buy 16 ounces of iced tea at Food Ser
vice. According to a February Daily survey,

each ve;ir I've donated $800 more than stu
dents at Harvard for a food plan from which
I virtually cannot be released. Even if I'm a
third vt ir student with a job that forces to
me t<' miss lunch and dinner virtually every
day.
I've donated to the Bookstore. Plenty.
As financial manager of 353 Campus
Drive — the former Delt house — I have, in
fact, forced my residents to donate ridicu
lous sums of their own money to furnish the
house with basic living amenities: plates, sil
verware, glasses, garbage cans, cutting
boards and everything else the University
did not think it should have to provide for
the new house. Never mind that we'll only
be using the equipment for 20 weeks. Never
mind that we can't take it when we leave.
I've donated various late fees each time I
am an hour or a day or a week late handing
in a check, registering for classes or per
forming any other Stanford task with a
deadline. Late fees are fair enough. Hut late
fees that start in the range of $25 and climb
into triple digits make "real world" finance
charges, like Visa's, seem charitable.
Deserving of special mention: Meyer

Library Media Center's policy of assessing a
$15 fine for the first day an audio tape is
late, $30 for the second day and a $500
replacement fee for the third day. What
kind of audio tape costs $500 to replace?
Would a fine of, maybe, $100 be that much
less of a deterrent?
I've also been given the special chance to
donate at least $300 to join the Stanford
Alumni Association. Simply spending four
years and well over $100,000 at the Univer
sity isn't enough to merit inclusion in offi
cial Alumni Association activities or use of
the library system lifter I've graduated; it
takes more money.
And I'm not alone. The fines and charges
are symptomatic of a much greater deter
rent to undergraduate alumni donations at
Stanford: people just don't feel respected.
Maybe another student doesn't get annoyed
at hidden charges, but is driven insane by
her inability to find two thesis readers or get
even two departments to standardize class
sign-ups. While individual professors and
administrators may develop a personal
interest in a student, the vast majority of
Stanford students — I submit — spend

their time here feeling like a meal ticket for
the "important" work of the University:
research, professorial salaries, and tuition
and stipends for doctoral students.
A friend of mine contends that the last
good word he heard from Stanford was his
acceptance letter three years ago. "It's like
they forget you're here for four years," he
said, "but the minute you graduate, they're
back, welcoming you and your donations
into the family of alumni." You can't treat
someone like they don't matter for four
years, and then expect to patch things up
with a few flattering mailings.
University President Gerhard Casper
and Provost Condoleezza Rice have worked
very hard to combat the University's low
alumni donation rates. If they were to take
all the time and energy they pour into such
efforts and really concentrate of providing
efficiency, respect and economic value for
undergraduates — I wonder if those droopy
alumni donation numbers might take a
turn for the better.
