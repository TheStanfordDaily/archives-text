Assessment of Project
Motivation was unfair
The Daily has no right to say what
Stanford students should or should not
fund. At Project Motivation, we serve the
entire Stanford community in innumerable
ways. It provides organization for those
students with interests in education and
who truly care about the welfare of our
nation's youth — if this is not a valuable
mission for Stanford students, as The Daily
claims, then this is a sad day. Not only do
our members benefit from reaching out to,
teaching and keeping in contact with hun
dreds and hundreds of kids, they are also
given a valuable head start in assessing the
state of education and meeting with teach
ers and counselors.
The Daily also fails to realize the service
Project Motivation does for the Stanford
community in being a large part of Admit
Weekend, a tradition Project Motivation
has been involved with since the group's
inception in the early 19705. By working
closely with such campus organizations as
Project Ay me, Barrio Assistance, MECIiA,
SSCLES and SBSE, as well as Admissions,
El Centro Chicano and various dorms
throughout campus, Project Motivation
has more than shown its commitment to
serving the Stanford community as well as
the real world. We feel The Daily's so-called
"recommendation" is completely unfound
(xl and shortsighted.
Lastly, the budget line item classified as
"Meetings, parties, etc." as reported by the
I )aily, is incorrect. That we allocate money
to feed the youth is correct, but The Daily
editors fail to realize that is an essential
part of our program. Because of this impor
tance we allocate money specifically to feed
the visiting students. We do not place it
under a "meetings" line item. The high
schools which visit our campus do not have
hundreds of dollars to pay for all of their
trip. Helping these underprivileged youth
pay for one meal or two is an essential part
of our program.
We ask t he students to reassess Project
Motivation. Is 70 cents too much to spend
on our nation's youth?

S.JO provides good value
for dollar and campus
Somehow we were not surprised at The
Daily's "NO" vote for the Stanford Jazz
Orchestra's special fee. Although this is
our third year on the special fee ballot,
each year The Daily has given us the same
"NO" endorsement, with a different excuse

each year. The students, thankfully, have
disregarded The Daily's advice, as we
obtained our special fee last year despite
the negative endorsement.
Here is the excuse for this year: "... it
Ls unfair to ask for a fee to (bring profes
sional performers to campus) while also
charging admission to its shows." Wait just
a minute. The SJO has charged admission
at a total of two concerts this year. The
Senate cut funding for one of our three
guest performers, and so this year, one of
the three concerts where we bring in a
guest performer had a student admission
of $4, as compared to $8 for the general
population. The other two concerts, with
guest artists Eddie Henderson and I/wie
Bellson, are provided free to Stanford stu
dents, with a charge of $8 and $12 to non
students. Our other concert with an admis
sion fee, the televised Faculty Showcase in
Dinkelspiel, was $8 for students and $12
for others — this concert, with guest per
former Tee Carson — had $0 allocated to it
from our special fee budget.
We went over these items in our inter
view with the editorial staff.
The endorsement criteria include "good
value for the dollar." The SJO provides
many additional concerts to students free
of charge, from CoHo and Tresidder patio,
to Jammix and Big Dance, not to mention
the educational clinics with our guest per
formers. Our gross fee request for next
year totals 84 cents per student per year.
Compared with the Speakers Bureau,
whose fee request of $103,287.36 ($7.62
per student) is largely directed toward hon
oraria for its guests, similar to the SJO, we
believe that we provide at least equivalent,
if not better, value for the dollar.
There has always seemed to be an ethi
cal problem with the Stanford communi
ty's only daily publication giving these kind
of endorsements. The misrepresentation of
our group in Tuesday's Daily, as well as in
previous years, has shown us that our par
ticipation is for naught — and we have
decided that in the future we will no longer
take part in The Daily's endorsement pro
cess. We encourage other special fee groups
to do the same.

Make a difference by
supporting special fee
As members of the You Can Make a Dif
ference staff and concerned Stanford stu
dents, we were very disap|>ointed to find
that The Daily chose not to endorse the You

Can Make a Difference (YCMAD) specuil
fee. As we read the description and explana
tion, we realized that the reason was based
on misunderstandings rather than truths.
YCMAD has traditionally Ixvn a conference
which invites community members to Stan
ford to discuss pertinent Issues. This year,
in response to criticisms about the struc
ture and focus of YCMAD, we have shifted
the focus of the conference to educating and
motivating Stanford students. We have also
added to the conference to spread knowl
edge about community issues and motivate
students to act upon the problems brought
up by these Issues.
We expect 150-200 attendees at this
year's conference on April 27 here at Stan
ford. We actually estimate 60 to 70 jx-rcent
of these attendees will be Stanford stu
dents. We believe that these estimates are
positive qualities of the conference. We
believe that having community involve
ment is a key ingredient of the conference.
Community involvement is the only way
that students can learn about the types of
issues our society is struggling against and
be motivated to do something about these
issues. For example, we will have an
Avenues to Action program at this year's
conference. At this event, students will Ik l
able to meet representatives of various
community organizations to learn about
the type of community service being done
and how they can get involved. In addition,
we are in no way limiting the student
attendance to the conference — Stanford
students are admitted free of charge.
The Daily also explains that "special
fees are better spent making a difference
with hands-on community service groups."
We agree with The Daily, and believe that,
yet again, it provides reasons to vote for,
rather than against, YCMAI). YCMAI) is
more than just a conference. This year for
example we also have sponsored a stall
series (five of which have already been dis
tributed) and programs throughout the
year (such as the V-chip program with I)on
Roberts last Wednesday). Community ser
vice by Stanford students requires that the
students know about the needs of the com
munity. Veiy rarely do students just come
to the Ilaas Center looking to volunteer;
they are usually brought there by issues
which interest them. Organizations such as
YCMAD help publicize these issues and
spur "hands-on" community service.
YCMAD is unique in that it both edu
cates students about community issues and
motivates them to get involved in address
ing those issues. The YCMAD conference
brings students together with community
members who know about community
needs. The dialogue between these two
groups is fundamental to student aware
ness and involvement in community ser
vice. The YCMAD programs and stall

series raise issues which interest Stanford
students and lead them to community ser
vice. YCMAD did suffer with budget cuts
and changes in the administration. It was
coordinated by Ilaas Center staff until four
years ago, and was thus able to use the
resources available to staff members. It is
now run solely by student volunteers. As a
student-run organization which educates
Stanford students and motivates them to
participate in hands-on community service,
YCMAD needs the support of special fees.

SAGE takes offense at
endorsement attitude
The views expressed in the endorse
ment section concerning SAGE presented
a shortsighted and inaccurate picture. We
feel that this must be addressed. Contrary
to the arguments made in yesterday's
Daily, the present time calls for an even
greater effort on the part of Students
Against Genocide.
The Daily's argument that the "fighting
has stopped and the International War
Crimes Tribunal is searching for war crimi
nals" implies that there is somehow less
need for activism. We do not share The
I Daily's optimism in the course of automat
ic justice. The limited time during which
NATO troops are to be stationed in Bosnia
and t he continued presence of indicted war
criminals leaves us skeptical of the long
term prospects for peace. Pressure must
still lx> applied.
Our Bosnian Student Empowerment
1 'reject is aimed at linking students at
schools throughout Bosnia with students
all over America — including Stanford.
The benefit concert that we planned for
next year is entirely devoted to helping the
victims of genocide — contrary to The
Daily's claims.
For the past three years we have
worked with refugees, themselves victims
of Serbian aggression and are currently
involved in a national project mined at
making sure that all the indicted war crim
inals are sent to the Hague.
SAGE is in fact involved in assisting the
Miles To Go Project which delivers crucial
medical supplies to the victims of the ward
with the active participation of Stanford

students on the ground in Bosnia.
SAGE members take great offense at
the attitude of The Daily's Editorial Board
expressed in the special fee endorsement
section. We feel that SAGE can contribute
to the ideal of a multiethnic Bosnia in
sever concrete ways. These should be rec
ognized and supported.

SCBN's special fee to
go only to equipment
In yesterday's analysis of the SCBN
special fee, the line reading "a total of
eight students work regularly for the
organization" was a misquote by The
Daily's editorial staff. The fact is that
over 40 students (undergraduates and
graduates) currently work at SCBN-TV.
The "eight members" the Daily's editorial
staff refers to are those members who
function as the core crew, the "die-hards"
who work day and night to ensure quality
product. They have had their hands tied,
however, by antiquated equipment and
insufficient funding resources.
It is true that television is a capital
intensive business. This year's special fee
request is what SCBN is needs to launch
the many projects we have planned for the
future of Stanford television. Subsequent
fee requests will be substantially reduced.
If students look at the SCBN budget
in the Elections Handbook, they will find
that the money requested goes strictly to
equipment needs. This is a one-time
investment in Stanford's future and,
given The Daily's positive language and
historic support, is definitely worthwhile.
The benefits of investing in SCBN by
supporting this year's special fee will be
reflected in more programming, quality
productions and a powerful career venue
for students interested in television.
Should SCBN fail to receive this special
fee, Stanford will be doomed to another
year of mediocre television.
