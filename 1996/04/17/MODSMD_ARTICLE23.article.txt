## Women's tennis hosts struggling Golden Bears 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
After completing an undefeated Pa
cific 10 Conference road schedule, the
No. 2 Stanford women's tennis team
returns home this week with a three
match homestand.
With three wins, the Cardinal (19-1
overall, 7-0 Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) can duplicate last
season's unblemished 10-0 conference
record, and with just two victories, it
can collect its ninth-straight Pac-10
crown.
Stanford opens the homestand
against No. 31 California this after
noon at the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Despite the tradition and history of the
Rears-Cardinal matchup, the Bears (8-
11, 1-6) have not lived up to their pre
season expectations or their traditional
success. Ranked No. 6 in the preseason
polls, Cal has fallen all the way to No.
31.
"They lost some good players," said
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan.
"It's sort of a double whammy. They
lost some players and their No. 1 fresh
man who was looking pretty good
leaves to go pro. So it's like 'What can
happen next?' They have some talented
players, but I think they're trying to
find themselves. Unfortunately, this is
a bad time to do that because this is the
prime season."
Losers of its last five dual matches,
Cal is in danger of dropping its final
three matches and not qualifying for
the NCAA tournament. Forty-eight
teams not in the topi 0, such as Cal, will
fight for six bids to the NCAA tourna
ment.
Not receiving an invitation to the
championship tournament would cer
tainly be a new experience for the
Bears, who have qualified for it every
year since its inception in 1982 and
have reached the quarterfinals 11
times.
"That would be very strange," Bren
nan said. "Rut they are truly having a
very tough year."
The Rears began the season on the
right foot, taking their first six con
tests, most of them outside of the con
ference. With the onset of the Pac-10
schedule, however, the Bears have
struggled, winning only their home
match against Arizona State and losing
11 of their last 13. The Sun Devils got
their revenge last weekend though,
capturing their only conference match
of the season over Cal in Tempe, 5-1.
"You can't really build up a solid
record in this conference if you're
struggling," Brennan said. "In the Pac
-10, you can go 0-for-10 and your record
really looks bad."
In its first matchup in Berkeley,
Stanford came away with a 6-3 win over
the Golden Bears. Cal made it a match,
however, entering doubles play in a 3-3
deadlock. The Cardinal went on to
sweep the doubles competition for the
final margin of victory.
The beginning of that match was
marred by controversy, though, as all
of Cal's singles players were awarded
one game each, due to an Intercolle

giate Tennis Association rule that re
quires the team's scorebook to be pre
sent at each match.
"We did a pretty good job on them
last time," Brennan said. "It's always
going to be tough, but we've got some
momentum going right now. We feel
pretty good."
That momentum shows up in the
form of a 10-match winning streak
overall and a conference winning
streak of 21 that dates back to the 1994
season.
The Cardinal may be on par to win in
even more convincing fashion than in
that March matchup. The Bears re
ceived two points from surprise upsets
of Cardinal singles players Katie
Schlukebir and Julie Scott. In addition,
Stanford will have 10 straight victories
and a home-court advantage behind
them.
