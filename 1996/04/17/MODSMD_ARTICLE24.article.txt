# Salzenstein to go out a winner
## 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
Jeff Salzenstein was living a dream on
Friday, April 5. There he was, playing first
singles for the defending national champi
on Cardinal against archrival and No. 1-
ranked UCLA in front of 1,700 fans at the
SUmford Tennis Stadium. To top it all off,
with the dual match score knotted at 3-3,
the whole match came down to the third set
tie-breaker of his match. If he could pull
through, the Cardinal would avenge its
only loss of the season and re-assume its
spot as the best team in the nation. If he
failed, Stanford would suffer its second loss
of the year and its first at home in over two
years.
"I definitely wanted the ball in my hands
at that point," said the 22-year-old captain.
"I was really relishing the whole situation.
It was like a dream come true."
But while the situation was ideal, the re
sult was not. UCI.A's star sophomore,
Justin Gimelstob, proved to be a little too
much for Salzenstein, and after pulling
ahead 6-4 in that crucial tie-breaker,
Gimelstob finished off Stanford's hero with
a hard ace up the middle. All Salzenstein
could do was let out a groan of frustration
and head to the locker room.
"When you lose an important deciding
match like that, you feel like you lost not
just for yourself, but for the whole team.
I/)sing always hurts, and losing a match
like that is devastating," he said.
But nobody would have known that
Salzenstein had lost from the ovation he re
ceived as he trudged off the first court.
Against a veiy loud and flamboyant oppo
nent, Salzenstein handled himself with
class and poise. In one particularly telling
moment at the conclusion of the second set,
Salzenstein hit a gorgeous backhand which
clearly clipped the line for what should have
ended the set and tied the match at one set
apiece. Gimelstob called the ball out. Al
most all of the fans in attendance erupted,
letting the sophomore know their disap
proval and calling him everything from a
cheater to an outright jerk. Salzenstein
seemed to be the only person in the house
able to maintain his calm. He quietly ap
pealed the call to the chair umpire and (he
ensuing overrule gave him t he set.
"I'm not the loudest or most exciting
guv in the court," Salzenstein said. "I

would want someone who watches me to
say, 'That guy handles himself with a lot of
class out there. He scraps hard, always
fighting for every point. He gives it his all
every timeout.'"
His teammates have elected him as their
captain the past two years because of the

excellent example he has set. "1 don't want
to be a rah, rah leader. I don't need the most
attention and I'm not going to tell the fun
niest joke. I guess I try to lead by example;
but I also understand that not everyone is

going to be the same way I am. I let
the guys do what they need to do to
make themselves better."
Head coach Dick Gould agrees
that his captain is not the most vocal
leader, but stresses that Sal/en
stein's leadership is nonetheless ef
fective. "Jeffs work ethic and his de
sire to improve along with his skill as
a player are what make him a good
captain for us," he said.
It Ls rare for a player of Salzen
stein's caliber to remain in college all
four years. So how has Gould been
lucky enough to hang onto bus star
for all these years?
"I love Stanford," Salzenstein
replies simply enough. "Getting my
degree has always been important to
me and my family, and I never saw
any major advantages to leaving
early."
There were other, more obvious
reasons for SaLzenstein to stay in
school as well. He was simply too
small coming out of high school.
Since his graduation four years ago,
he has grown three inches, mid put
on quite a few pounds. Once he had

enrolled at Stanford, he did not
think it made any sense for him to go
pro until he had at least made it to
the top of the Cardinal lineup, a feat
he accomplished only last year.
Bv that point he had fallen in love
with the school and especially his
team, and saw no real reason to take
off. "One more year of college wasn't
going to seriously hurt my develop
ment as a player," he said. "I've had
groat coaching here, and my game
has improved a whole lot."
Of that coaching, Salzenstein
cannot seem to say enough. He cred
its Gould and assistant coach Jean
Whitlinger with making him the
player he is today.
"Coach Gould has given me my
aggressiveness. Before Stanford, I
was content to hit from the baseline,
but coach has taught me to get into
net and that has made me a much
tougher player. I have matured im
measurably as lxjth a player and per
son during my years here, and I give
our coaches a lot of credit and respect
for helping me do that."
But developing his tennis is not
the real reason Salzenstein has cho
sen to stay at Stanford rather than
pursuing the cash that awaits him in
the professional arena. "I have some
really close friends out here, and you

can't measure with money how
great it is to be with them for one
more year," he said.
"Part of me would love to stay at
Stanford forever. Playing for a team,
being in a fraternity, it is great. IJv
ing with 50 guys during the year and
playing with my teammates has re
ally made for four wonderful years of
college. Put there is another part of
me that says it is time to move on. I
think four years is the perfect
amount of time to go to school, and it
is time for some new guys to take
over."
Playing on the tour is something
that Salzenstein knows will not be
easy and might be full of frustra
tions. "I'm probably worrying about
the tour more than I should lx> right
now," he said. "It is going to be tough
for sure, and a lot of hard work. Hut
I've got friends interviewing for jobs
with business firms, and I know I'm
not ready to be working behind a
desk from nine to five. My situation
isn't that bad at all."
Indeed, Gould sees in Salzenstein
the possibility for a very good profes
sional career.
"I don't say this about a whole lot
of guys, but Jeff definitely has jxiten
tial to go on to a good future in ten
nis. His tennis has improved dra

matically over the past few years,
and now he's a great all-around play
er," Gould said. "I wouldn't trade
Jeff for any other player in the coun
try. Period."
And so, despite losing in front of
1,700 fans on his home court in the
rubber match of a crucial battle with
UCIiA, Jeff Salzenstein Ls doing just
fine. "I've taken a lot away from
matches like that one. I've learned a
lot about myself as a person through
tennis wins, and especially tough
losses. I'll be motivated that much
harder fort he rest of the season," he
said.
Each year at Stanford, Salzen
stein has set firm and realistic goals.
Freshman year it was to crack the
starting lineup. He did, playing No.
5. Sophomore year, it was to start in
the top three. Again he did, playing
No. 2. Junior year he set out to play
No. 1 singles and to win the NCAA
team title. Once again he succeeded.
In this, his senior year, he set his
sights on three goals. The first, to
play No. 1 again, he has already ac
complished. The second is to win the
NCAA team title, and the third is to
win the individual NCAA singles
title. Stanford fans can only hope
that Salzenstein once again accom
plishes what ht 1 sets out to do.
