# Salzenstein to go out a winner
## 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
Jeff Salzenstein was living a dream on
Friday, April 5. There he was, playing first
singles for the defending national champi
on Cardinal against archrival and No. 1-
ranked UCLA in front of 1,700 fans at the
SUmford Tennis Stadium. To top it all off,
with the dual match score knotted at 3-3,
the whole match came down to the third set
tie-breaker of his match. If he could pull
through, the Cardinal would avenge its
only loss of the season and re-assume its
spot as the best team in the nation. If he
failed, Stanford would suffer its second loss
of the year and its first at home in over two
years.
"I definitely wanted the ball in my hands
at that point," said the 22-year-old captain.
"I was really relishing the whole situation.
It was like a dream come true."
But while the situation was ideal, the re
sult was not. UCI.A's star sophomore,
Justin Gimelstob, proved to be a little too
much for Salzenstein, and after pulling
ahead 6-4 in that crucial tie-breaker,
Gimelstob finished off Stanford's hero with
a hard ace up the middle. All Salzenstein
could do was let out a groan of frustration
and head to the locker room.
"When you lose an important deciding
match like that, you feel like you lost not
just for yourself, but for the whole team.
I/)sing always hurts, and losing a match
like that is devastating," he said.
But nobody would have known that
Salzenstein had lost from the ovation he re
ceived as he trudged off the first court.
Against a veiy loud and flamboyant oppo
nent, Salzenstein handled himself with
class and poise. In one particularly telling
moment at the conclusion of the second set,
Salzenstein hit a gorgeous backhand which
clearly clipped the line for what should have
ended the set and tied the match at one set
apiece. Gimelstob called the ball out. Al
most all of the fans in attendance erupted,
letting the sophomore know their disap
proval and calling him everything from a
cheater to an outright jerk. Salzenstein
seemed to be the only person in the house
able to maintain his calm. He quietly ap
pealed the call to the chair umpire and (he
ensuing overrule gave him t he set.
"I'm not the loudest or most exciting
guv in the court," Salzenstein said. "I

would want someone who watches me to
say, 'That guy handles himself with a lot of
class out there. He scraps hard, always
fighting for every point. He gives it his all
every timeout.'"
His teammates have elected him as their
captain the past two years because of the

excellent example he has set. "1 don't want
to be a rah, rah leader. I don't need the most
attention and I'm not going to tell the fun
niest joke. I guess I try to lead by example;
but I also understand that not everyone is
