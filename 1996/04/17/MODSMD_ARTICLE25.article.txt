Judge it by the victory and starting
pitching, and you might think the Stan
ford baseball squad broke out of its four
game slide last night during its 4-3 win
over Sacramento State.
Judge it by the competence of the op
ponent and the margin of victory, and
you might want to think again.
The 18th-ranked Cardinal (24-17)
jumped out to a 4-0 lead on hapless Sac
State (9-32) before surviving a late buzz
by the Hornets, snapping Stanford's
four-game losing streak.
Cardinal pitcher Mario Iglesias threw
four quality innings, giving up only one

hit and fanning four Hornets. Freshman
reliever Tony Cogan snagged his first col
legiate victory on three scoreless innings
of work.
"I was very pleased with Iglesias," said
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess fol
lowing his squad's first win since April 6.
"He had a great fastball tonight, and
that's a good indication."
The scoreboard showed nothing but
goose eggs until the bottom of the fifth
frame, when right fielder Joe Kilburg's
single and center fielder Jody Gerut's
RBI triple down the right field line blem
ished the runless pitchers' duel. Senior
catcher A.J. Hindi's suicide squeeze play
brought Gerut home from third, and the
Cardinal had a two-run lead after five in
nings.
"I was very glad to have a good outing
tonight," Iglesias said of his four nearly
perfect innings of work. "I felt very re
laxed. Not too up or down, but very level
headed."
The law of gravity seemed to have

been repealed in Sunken Diamond, as th<j
Cardinal hit the ball in the air all night
and hit into only three ground-ball outs
the entire game. However the thick, wet
air above the stadium gave most fly ball*
only a snowball's chance in the Stanford
spring sun of leaving the ballpark.

seventh inning. Former Cardinal and

and took home on one of the I lornets'
three fielding errors of the night. Gerut

runs and two RBIs.
The 4-0 lead lasted until the eighth
