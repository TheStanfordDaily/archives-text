# It's much easier to forgive when money's on the line

This weekend's NFL draft is most likely
going to mark the dawn of new era in
sports, one in which I am ashamed to
be a fan of.
I am not referring to the fact that some
body like Mel Kiper Jr. has a job at ESPN and
I don't — I am talking about the reality of life
and, ultimately, the spoils world's refusal to
acknowledge it.
Come Saturday, former Nebraska run
ning back Lawrence Phillips will become a
professional football player. He will most
likely be one of the top five draft picks (possi
bly the first pick in the draft) and will subse
quently sign a multi-million dollar contract.
In case you can't remember, or choose to
forget (as the NFL has), this is the same
Phillips that, according to police reports, last
September grabbed his girlfriend by the hair
and dragged her down three flights of stairs
as she screamed for help. Phillips then
capped off his tirade by repeatedly banging
the woman's head on a mailbox.
Phillips pleaded no contest to assault and
trespassing, and in December, the court put
him on ayear's probation and ordered him to
undergo counseling to learn how to control
his anger. Philips was temporarily suspended
by Nebraska head coach Tom Osborne, but
was reinstated in time to play in the (>)rn
huskers' last three games and to gain 165
yards in the Fiesta Bowl.
Since the Fiesta Bowl, Phillips has been
attending workouts, where he
has not only displayed his physical abilities,
but also endured numerous interviews by
coaches and team psychologists who are
weary of drafting a player with a history of vi
olence.
I'll bet all of you could stop reading this
column right now and figure out, on your
own, what the majority of the coaches con

eluded about Phillips. "He's a changed man/'
many say. "He's environmentally handi
capped, but this is not a bad kid," said omi
team's personnel director in a Sports Illus-;
trated interview. *«
What a bunch of crap.
These coaches believe Phillips has
changed because they want to believe i t — be-*
cause they see in Phillips potential doling
signs and possible Super Bowl trips. •
Not that it is a surprise to anyone, btrti
once again, we see an example of the morality
of sports being dictated by money. While t.lifr
Phillips case stands alone in my mind as an
example of the moral bankruptcy in spoils*
its magnitude is exacerbated by what hap
pened to Richie Parker just over a year ago.
Richie Parker was one of the most highly
recruited high school basketball players in

the country. He was offered scholarships to
Seton Hall, Utah, and George Washington
University, and was still being heavily re
cruited into January, when he pleaded guilty
to sexual assault.
Parker forced a 15-year-old woman into a
side stairwell in his school and made tin*
woman have oral sex with him. Parker w.ij
sentenced to five years probation and a ye.'vr
