# It's much easier to forgive when money's on the line

This weekend's NFL draft is most likely
going to mark the dawn of new era in
sports, one in which I am ashamed to
be a fan of.
I am not referring to the fact that some
body like Mel Kiper Jr. has a job at ESPN and
I don't — I am talking about the reality of life
and, ultimately, the spoils world's refusal to
acknowledge it.
Come Saturday, former Nebraska run
ning back Lawrence Phillips will become a
professional football player. He will most
likely be one of the top five draft picks (possi
bly the first pick in the draft) and will subse
quently sign a multi-million dollar contract.
In case you can't remember, or choose to
forget (as the NFL has), this is the same
Phillips that, according to police reports, last
September grabbed his girlfriend by the hair
and dragged her down three flights of stairs
as she screamed for help. Phillips then
capped off his tirade by repeatedly banging
the woman's head on a mailbox.
Phillips pleaded no contest to assault and
trespassing, and in December, the court put
him on ayear's probation and ordered him to
undergo counseling to learn how to control
his anger. Philips was temporarily suspended
by Nebraska head coach Tom Osborne, but
was reinstated in time to play in the (>)rn
huskers' last three games and to gain 165
yards in the Fiesta Bowl.
Since the Fiesta Bowl, Phillips has been
attending workouts, where he
has not only displayed his physical abilities,
but also endured numerous interviews by
coaches and team psychologists who are
weary of drafting a player with a history of vi
olence.
I'll bet all of you could stop reading this
column right now and figure out, on your
own, what the majority of the coaches con

eluded about Phillips. "He's a changed man/'
many say. "He's environmentally handi
capped, but this is not a bad kid," said omi
team's personnel director in a Sports Illus-;
trated interview. *«
What a bunch of crap.
These coaches believe Phillips has
changed because they want to believe i t — be-*
cause they see in Phillips potential doling
signs and possible Super Bowl trips. •
Not that it is a surprise to anyone, btrti
once again, we see an example of the morality
of sports being dictated by money. While t.lifr
Phillips case stands alone in my mind as an
example of the moral bankruptcy in spoils*
its magnitude is exacerbated by what hap
pened to Richie Parker just over a year ago.
Richie Parker was one of the most highly
recruited high school basketball players in

the country. He was offered scholarships to
Seton Hall, Utah, and George Washington
University, and was still being heavily re
cruited into January, when he pleaded guilty
to sexual assault.
Parker forced a 15-year-old woman into a
side stairwell in his school and made tin*
woman have oral sex with him. Parker w.ij
sentenced to five years probation and a ye.'vr

of counseling. In addition, 011 his
own, he made public apologies and
reconciled with his victim privately.
He also agreed to give the woman a
portion of any money he would ever
make from basketball.
Following the incident, all throe
schools retracted their scholarship
offers. Parker was left, with no place
to play basketball, and more tragical
ly, no place to continue his educa
tion. Eventually, Parker was admit
ted to Mesa Community College,
where he could attend classes, but
could not play basketball.
Despite all of Parker's apologies
and his apparent contrition, 110
school would give him a second
chance.

Phillips, conversely, admitted no
guilt, made no apologies and still has
many NFL executives drooling over
the chance to sign him. And it all
makes me sick. I am not saying
Parker's actions were any more ex
cusable than Phillips'. However, no
one gave Parker a second chance be
cause lie wasn't going to bring Seton
1 hill, Ut<ih or George Washington an
NCAA championship. He wasn't
going to bring more revenue to
whichever school he was to attend.
Lawrence Phillips, however,
could mean a championship to a
mediocre NFL team without a
running game. He could mean
higher attendance at games next
year.
Big deal — what his presence in
the NFL really means is that coach
es, managers and executives have
made winning more important than
integrity.
