# Three former Bookstore employees head to court
## Trio faces charges of grand theft and tax evasion 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
A former Stanford Bookstore
bookkeeper was the first witness
in a preliminary hearing yesterday
for three former Bookstore execu
tives who allegedly used Bookstore
money to fund extraordinary
perquisites and expenses for top
level employees.
Santa Clara County prosecu
tors last spring charged ex-Book
store General Manager Eldon

Speed with five counts of grand theft and two
counts of tax evasion. Former Asst. General Man
ager Philip Chiaramonte also faces six counts of
grand theft and two counts of tax evasion. Patrick
McDonald, a former Bookstore controller, is
charged with two counts of grand theft and two
counts of tax evasion.

The three have pleaded not guilty. If convicted,
Speed and Chiaramonte could receive a maximum
sentence of eight years in prison. McDonald could
serve five years if convicted.
In a Feb. 5, 1992 story, The Daily reported that
senior Bookstore managers were receiving use of a
vacation home in central California, a motor home
and several luxury cars. The story prompted inves
tigations by California Attorney General Dan Lun
gren and the California State Franchise Tax Board.
The only witness called to testify yesterday was
former Bookstore Accounting Supervisor Mary
Law, who worked under McDonald.
Law, who received check-writing instructions
from both McDonald and Chiaramonte, testified
that McDonald asked her to write checks to Col
leagues Management Services. CMS was incorpo
rated in 1984 as a separate company under the
management of Chiaramonte and Speed. The com-


Speed
pany took out loans from the
Commercial Bank of Fremont to
build a vacation home in Twain
Harte, Calif.
Law said she received in
structions for her accounting
duties, which included "check
writing and checking invoices,"
directly from McDonald until he
left the Bookstore in the early
19905. Afterward, she said she
received her orders from Chiara
monte.
McDonald asked her to write
Bookstore checks for the lease of
the cabin from CMS, she said. In
addition, Jack Friedenthal,
then-president of the board of di
rectors of the Bookstore, autho
rized the lease, Law testified.
The checks were hand-typed,
Law said. Of the two types of
checks written for invoices to the
Bookstore — hand-typed checks

and printed system checks — re
quests for the former were ex
tremely uncommon, she said.
Law will be back on the wit
ness stand today when the hear
ing resumes.
Because a preliminary hear
ing is held only for the judge to
ascertain whether there is suffi
cient evidence for the case to pro
ceed to a trial, it is still undecid
ed whether the case will be tried
in superior court.
Both Speed and Chiaramonte
were present at the hearing;
however, their attorneys had ob
tained waivers permitting their
absence.
Kenneth Robinson, Chiara
monte's attorney, added he was
hoping not to "hold over to
trial," or appear before superior
court.
"My expectation is that at the
conclusion of the preliminary
hearing, the judge will make a
decision that there is no evidence
and will exonerate them factual
ly and legally," Robinson said.
