# Board to address LGB issues
## Wais says new group will evaluate needs of community 
### Victoria Foster Contributing writer 
A new student advisory board
representing the interests of les
bian, gay and bisexual students
will start holding regular meet
ings with Dean of Students Marc
Wais. The formation of the board
this week is the result of an open
forum held in January.
Although Wais said his office is
trying to deal with the issues and
needs discussed in a report of the
lesbian, gay and bisexual commu
nity in a "timely and responsive
way," he predicted that the board
is the first step in a "long, ongoing
process" of work and evaluation.
Last spring, the Working
Group on Lesbian, Gay and Bisex

ual Student Needs issued a report
calling for, among other things,
more academic role models for les
bian, gay and bisexual students
and a full-time director of the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Communi
ty Center. It also called for im
proved disabled access to the
LGBCC.
After the January forum, Wais
this month wrote a letter to the
LGBCC formalizing his commit
ment to working with community
members. It was then that he sug
gested the formation of an adviso
ry board to monitor the progress
being made.
Wais said he also wrote letters
on behalf of the lesbian, gay and
bisexual community to other de
partments of the University, mak

ing the departments aware that
they had not responded to the re
port or had provided what the
community considered "vague,
generalized responses." Those
contacted included Provost Con
doleezza Rice and Athletics Direc
tor Ted Leland, since the report
emphasized a need for improve
ment in the classroom and in ath
letic arenas.
In addition, Wais said he has re
ceived a letter he requested from
the LGBCC which reviews depart
mental responses and lists specific
instances where unsatisfactory re
sponses were found. The advisory
board will monitor progress in
these areas of the University.
According to LGBCC Adviser
Troy Gilbert, the advisory panel is
only one of several positive results
of the report.
"The first year of having the
graduate assistant at the LGBCC
worked out really well," Gilbert
said. "We're very excited about it.
I LGBCC graduate intern Sara
Sperling] assists a lot of day-to
day work at the LGBCC." Gilbert
said the continuation of this posi
tion is "largely a result of the re
port."

As promised, Rice has designat
ed the Fire Truck House as the
first place to be inspected by an ar
chitect hired to plan renovations
for all the campus community
centers.
"The University values the
LGB community, students, facul
ty and staff and wants to foster an
environment which is supportive,
nurturing and respectful, and this
process is going on in the interests
of furthering that environment,"
Wais said.
Gilbert lauded Wais for his re
sponsiveness, but said effective
communication to solicit student
input takes time. "It's unfortu
nate, but it's reality," Gilbert said.
