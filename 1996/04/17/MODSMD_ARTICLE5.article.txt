## Scientists find gene for epilepsy 
### Wai Fung Kwok Contributing writer 
A team of researchers including
a Stanford professor has identified
a gene that is responsible for a rare
form of epilepsy.
The gene, which codes for a pro
tease inhibitor, causes epilepsy
when a defective copy is inherited
from both parents. Discoveiy of
this gene makes precise diagnosis
of the disease possible, according to
Richard Myers, associate professor
of genetics at the School of Medi
cine and the study's senior re
searcher.
"The evidence is very strong
that this is the gene," Myers said.
The functional gene normally
codes for cystatin B, a member of a
class of proteins called protease in
hibitors which are responsible for
blocking the action of enzymes
that degrade other cell proteins.
The researchers found that in peo
ple with a form of epilepsy allied
progressive myoclonus epilepsy,
this gene is defective and their bod
ies fail to produce cystatin B.
The finding of this gene will
help doctors diagnose patients
with progressive myoclonus
epilepsy, Myers said. It should
allow scientists to develop a diag
nostic test that allows for the pre
cise identification of the disease.
This is especially crucial because
phenytoin, a drug commonly used
to treat epilepsy, can cause fatal re
actions in people with progressive
myoclonus epilepsy.
According to Len Pennacchio, a
graduate student in biology who
worked on the project, the finding
is surprising because this is the
first time that a protease inhibitor
