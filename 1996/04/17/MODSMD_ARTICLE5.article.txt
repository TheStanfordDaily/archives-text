## Scientists find gene for epilepsy 
### Wai Fung Kwok Contributing writer 
A team of researchers including
a Stanford professor has identified
a gene that is responsible for a rare
form of epilepsy.
The gene, which codes for a pro
tease inhibitor, causes epilepsy
when a defective copy is inherited
from both parents. Discoveiy of
this gene makes precise diagnosis
of the disease possible, according to
Richard Myers, associate professor
of genetics at the School of Medi
cine and the study's senior re
searcher.
"The evidence is very strong
that this is the gene," Myers said.
The functional gene normally
codes for cystatin B, a member of a
class of proteins called protease in
hibitors which are responsible for
blocking the action of enzymes
that degrade other cell proteins.
The researchers found that in peo
ple with a form of epilepsy allied
progressive myoclonus epilepsy,
this gene is defective and their bod
ies fail to produce cystatin B.
The finding of this gene will
help doctors diagnose patients
with progressive myoclonus
epilepsy, Myers said. It should
allow scientists to develop a diag
nostic test that allows for the pre
cise identification of the disease.
This is especially crucial because
phenytoin, a drug commonly used
to treat epilepsy, can cause fatal re
actions in people with progressive
myoclonus epilepsy.
According to Len Pennacchio, a
graduate student in biology who
worked on the project, the finding
is surprising because this is the
first time that a protease inhibitor
has been linked to epilepsy. The
finding will likely lead to further re
search to determine whether other
forms of epilepsy are linked to de
fective genes coding for protease in
hibitors.
"This raises the possibility that
other forms of epilepsy may be re
lated to protease inhibitors or some
kind of protease pathways and this
is something entirely new involving
epilepsy. It opens up a whole new
area of research," Myers said.
Progressive myoclonus epilepsy
accounts for about 1 percent of all
cases of epilepsy worldv/ide. Al
though the disease is rare in the
United States, it has a high inci
dence in Finland, where one in
20,000 people are afflicted. Symp
toms of the disease include muscle
seizures and brain deterioration,
which can lead to senility.
Finnish researchers began

studying progressive myoclonus
epilepsy six years ago using blood
samples and medical histories from
30 families. They subsequently lo
cated the gene to be on chromosome
21, one of the 23 pairs of chromo
somes that all humans have.
In 1991, Stanford researchers
joined the Finns in an effort to pin
point the exact location of the gene
on chromosome 21. Usingdatagath
ered through the Human Genome
Project, an international effort to
identify all human genes, the re
searchers were able to narrow the lo
cation of the gene to a region shared
only by people with the disease.
The gene was later identified to
be a gene that was previously
known to be associated with the
production of cystatin B.
Identifying the function of cys
tatin B is likely to be the next step to
ward the treatment of epilepsy. "Now
what's important is to figure out the
function of the protein this gene
makes," said Myers. "We need to un
derstand why a deficiency in this pro
tein, cystatin B, causes disease."
