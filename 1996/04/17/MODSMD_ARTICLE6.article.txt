Participants in this year's Sorority Rush
met with better results than they have in the
past five years, according to Rush organiz
ers.
Including continuous open bids, at least
75 percent of the 214 women who rushed
this year received bids yesterday, Inter
sorority Council Co-Rush Chair Irene Yack

ovlev said. A bid is an offer of membership
from a sorority.
Every Rushee who went to a preference
party and followed ISC rules received a bid
from one of the six ISC sororities. The pref
erence party is the final event during Rush,
and no Rushee may attend more than two.
All of the women who preferenced a
sorority and were willing to accept bids
from each of their preferences received
bids from their first- or second-choice

sorority, Yackovlev said.
The majority of women received bids
from their first-choice sorority.
"This is our best record in the last five
years," Yackovlev said. "We are veiy happy
with the results."
This year, no Rushees were "cross-cut,"
which occurs when a Rushee goes to two
preference parties and does not receive a bid
from either of the two sororities. Because
there were no cross-cut Rushees, "snap"

bids will be unnecessary, Yackovlev said.
Snap bids are late bids offered to cross-cut
Rushees in order to fill the spaces left by
women who declined bids.
According to Yackovlev, the changes
made to Sorority Rush this year were well
received. She said she thought Rushees ap
preciated the focus on conversations and
getting to know sorority members, instead
