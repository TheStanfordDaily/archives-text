# Rabbi warns against Internet hate speech
## 
### Marcella Bernhard 
The associate dean of the
Simon Wiesenthal Center encour
aged a small audience last night to
confront the "challenge of the In
ternet" and protest hate speech
found on the World Wide Web.
Rabbi Abraham Cooper, in an
address honoring Yom Hashoah or
Holocaust Remembrance Day,
spoke of the dangers of hate speech
and its relation to the Holocaust.
"Jews know that hate speech
has consequence," he said.
Cooper referred to the Internet
as the "soapbox of the 20th centu
ry," an unregulated forum for any
people wanting to promote their
ideas. The hate movement, he
said, was first computerized in the
1980s. Hate groups, which had
previously been marginalized,
were suddenly able to use the In
ternet to "market their ideas in a
fashion that is unassailable."
Cooper cited estimates of ap
proximately 250 hate groups, with
25,000 to 100,000 members, in the
United States today. In the face of
Internet technology, Cooper
asked, "How do we marginalize
bigotry?"
As well as the dangers of Inter
net usage to promote hate speech,
dangers also exist in the informa
tion which can be downloaded
from the Internet, Cooper said. He
gave examples of information

being downloaded to build bombs
and create lethal gas, most recent
ly used in civilian gas attacks in a
Tokyo subway.
When asked about the some
times fine distinction between
containing hate speech and pro
moting censorship, Cooper said
the danger contained in informa
tion available on the Internet is
greater than the harmful effects of
censorship.

'Respect technology,
use technology.
It's a tool. But never
worship technology.'
— Abraham Cooper

Cooper told students not to ac
cept Internet material as fact or
truth and to acknowledge the po
tential dangers of technological
advances.
"Respect technology, use tech
nology," Cooper concluded. "It's a
tool. But never worship technolo
gy"
He spoke of the Internet as "a
new battlefield" in which hate
speech must be combated and told
the audience to "use your eyes,
your ears, your fingers and espe
cially your brains to help in the
battle."
In 1977, Cooper helped estab
lish the Simon Wiesenthal Center,
a Jewish human rights group
based in Los Angeles. Cooper also
is the editor of Response magazine
and of "Page One," a weekly radio
show. His work includes research

on anti-Semitism, weapons of
mass destruction and the denial of
the Holocaust.
A memorial service was held
before Cooper's speech. It includ
ed the lighting of memorial can
dles, a recitation of a mourner's
kaddish and readings of the words
of Holocaust survivors by mem
bers of the audience. The service
was organized by the Ilillel Foun
dation.
