THE HONOR CODE
The standard for academic conduct for Stanford students is as follows:
A. The Honor Code is an undertaking of the students, individually and collectively:
1) that they will not give or receive aid in examinations; that they will not give or receive
unpermitted aid in class work, in the preparation of reports, or in any other work that is to be
used by the instructor as the basis of grading;
2) that they will do their share and take an active part in seeing to it that others as well as
themselves uphold the spirit and letter of the Honor Code.
B. The faculty on its part manifests its confidence in the honor of its students by refraining
from proctoring examinations and from taking unusual and unreasonable precautions to
prevent the forms of dishonesty mentioned above. The faculty will also avoid, as far as
practicable, academic procedures that create temptations to violate the Honor Code.
C. While the faculty alone has the right and obligation to set academic requirements, the
students and faculty will work together to establish optimal conditions for honorable
academic work.
OPEN LETTER TO STANFORD STUDENTS
REGARDING JUDICIAL AFFAIRS
Dear Undergraduate and Graduate Students:
President Casper has commissioned the 'Committee of Fifteen' (C-15) to review the current Judicial Affairs process. C-15 is made up
of six faculty members, 6 students and 3 university staff members. The Office of Judicial Affairs is responsible for reviewing reported
violations of the Honor Code and the Fundamental Standard. A copy of each is attached as well as a roster of C-15 members.
In 1994-95 there were 9 cases of Fundamental Standard violations and 42 cases of Honor Code violations, in which the student
involved either admitted guilt or was found "guilty beyond a reasonable doubt". Common penalties included a 1 or 2 quarter
suspension, a 1 to 3 quarter delay in degree conferral, 40-80 hours of community service, required restitution and a $100 penalty.
We are very interested in hearing from students how they feel and what they know about the current Judicial Affairs process.
• One of the principal goals of C-15 is to make judicial affairs an educational process. What steps would you recommend to educate
students and faculty about the content and significance of the Honor Code and Fundamental Standard?
• As a student do you feel as if you have enough information on what constitutes a violation of the Honor Code or Fundamental
Standard?
• Do you think that students and faculty should be involved in reviewing cases of judicial misconduct and assessment of penalties?
• Do you feel that cheating is on the rise? What could the University do to discourage academic dishonesty?
• In your opinion is the Judicial Affairs process open and easy to understand? Is it fair? Is it confidential? Do resolutions occur
quickly?
• Have you or someone you know been suspected of a violation of the Honor Code or Fundamental Standard? What were your/their
experiences with the faculty/department raising the question? What were your/their experiences with the Office of Judicial Affairs?
The Committee of Fifteen is very interested in your responses to these questions as well as any comments you have about judicial
affairs at Stanford. We understand that you may wish to have your responses remain confidential. You may respond in the following
ways:
You may send email to Laurette Beeson (lbeeson@forsythe) who is staffing the committee and she will remove your email header
from the responses before forwarding them to the committee if you wish to remain anonymous.
You may contact Laurette at 5-2968 (private voice mail number) and arrange for a private, confidential one-on-one interview with a C
15 committee member
Your responses will be considered carefully by the committee and are essential to understanding the impact of potential changes to the
judicial process. Please respond by April 30th.
Thank you,
The Committee of Fifteen

THE
FUNDAMENTAL
STANDARD
Students at Stanford are
expected to show both within
and without the University such
respect for order, morality,
personal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to do this will
be sufficient cause for removal
from the University.
