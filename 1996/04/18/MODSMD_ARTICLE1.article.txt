# Weisberg testifies in Bookstore case
## Board member says he was unaware of top managers' alleged improprieties 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Law Prof.
Robert Weisberg
testified yester
day that as a
member of the
Stanford Book
store board of di
rectors, he was
unaware of the
alleged fiscal im
proprieties of the
Bookstore's gen-

eral manager and assistant gener
al manager.
Weisberg, who still sits on the
board, was called as a witness in
the preliminary hearing for for
mer Bookstore General Manager
Eldon Speed, former Asst. General
Manager Philip Chiaramonte and
former Controller Patrick McDon
ald, who have been charged with

grand theft and tax evasion in con
nection with an investigation into
extraordinary perquisites top
Bookstore employees were receiv
ing. The charges were brought last
spring by the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's Office.
The judge officiating the pre
liminary hearing will decide
whether the three men must go
through a full trial on the first
criminal charges to be brought in
the case, which resulted from an
investigation into the alleged
wrongdoings after they were re
ported in a Daily article in Febru
ary 1992.
The second witness called,
Weisberg, who has served on the
board since 1989, described the
board's discussions of salary and
benefits for the Bookstore man
agers and its policy on approving


Weisberg
spending by the managers.
According to one charge,
Chiaramonte spent $200,000 of
Bookstore funds to remodel his
personal residence in San Jose. He
then allegedly asked the board for
a loan of $200,000, without admit
ting that the money had already
been spent.
When Speed and Chiaramonte
approached the board regarding
the loan, Speed at no time suggest
ed the funds had already been
used, Weisberg said.
Consequently, the board voted
to approve the loan. Had he known
the loan was retroactive, Weisberg
said, "I would not have voted to
approve it."
The board had no specific set of
guidelines for its responsibilities,
he said, and it was unclear what
actions taken by the managers
had to be approved by the board.
When he was approached by
former board president Jack

Friedenthal to take a board posi
tion, Weisberg said, he was given
no specific instructions as to his
responsibilities as a board mem
ber.
At the time, Weisberg said, he
had no problem with the ambigui
ty of the position. But after the
story ran in The Daily, he said he
became concerned that the board
did not have a "good systematic
procedure" outlining board mem
ber responsibility in approving
Bookstore decisions.
He said he was concerned that
the Bookstore was making expen
ditures which might not have been
authorized by the board, and that
the board might have been ap
proving expenditures that were
inappropriate.
He stressed that he was un
aware of most of the expenditures
made by Speed and Chiaramonte,
including purchasing several vehi
cles for top executives, leasing a
motor home and a vacation home
in Twain Harte, Calif., and reim
bursing themselves for personal
travel expenses.
The Daily article "raised ques

tions in my mind about a lot of ex
penses I hadn't known about be
fore," Weisbergsaid.
After the article was published,
the board held a special meeting.
But no one directly questioned
Speed about his activities at the
meeting, Weisbergsaid.
"Slowly but surely I learned
from various sources that certain
decisions had been made at the
Bookstore which should have been
subject to formal board discussion
and careful legal scrutiny" and
were not, Weisberg said.
But, he added, he made sure
not to discuss the specific issues
with other board members be
cause of what he felt was the
"complicated and volatile" nature
of the matter.
Instead, he and other board
members pushed for a formal in
vestigation, Weisberg said. The
board voted to commission an
audit report, to hire professional
outside counsel and to form an
audit committee consisting of
board members. "The audit itself
raised questions about whether
those expenses had been autho

rized," Weisberg said.
Until The Daily published its
story, nothing seemed amiss,
Weisberg testified. He said he
trusted other members of the
board and Speed and Chiara
monte to make reasonable deci
sions.
Although he did not look in de
tail at the salary or benefits Book
store managers were receiving,
Weisberg said, he had no reason to
assume they were inappropriate.
"It was my general impression .
. . that the salary for Mr. Speed
was roughly consistent with his
duties," Weisberg said, adding,
"My assumption was it was a fair
ly conventional benefits package."
When details of the expendi
tures were released, however, he
said, it was obvious that "the com
pensation for the managers took a
form which I thought was embar
rassing and inappropriate."
Deputy District Attorney Linda
Condron said other members of
the Bookstore board will be called
on to testify when the hearing con
tinues Monday.
