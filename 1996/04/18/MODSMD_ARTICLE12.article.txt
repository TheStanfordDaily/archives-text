# Greeks come together for blood drive

### Jenna Land Contributing writer 
The first ever Greek-sponsored blood drive on
campus drew members of 10 fraternities and three
sororities to White Plaza yesterday.
The drive represents an important new way for the
Greek community to cooperate in coordinating one
public service activity, said sophomore Eric Demmitt,
the community service representative for Kappa
Sigma fraternity, a sponsor of the drive.
According to Demmitt, 60 or 70 fraternity and
sorority members pre-registered to donate blood, and
many more dropped in throughout the day. "I'm real
ly excited about the turnout," he said.
He did not know yet how much blood had been do
nated altogether.
Junior Rodrigo Gutierrez, also a Kappa Sig, agreed
that the drive was a success.
"It's usually two houses or one house that partici
pate," he said. "This is huge compared to normal."
Gutierrez said he hopes similar blood drives will be
held often on campus; ideally, he said, a drive will be
held each quarter.
Jeanne Larkin, who coordinates mobile blood dri

ves for the Medical Center, said she appreciated the
students' support.
"This is the first time the Greeks have gotten to
gether to organize a blood drive, and as far as I know
they've been very well-supported," she said.
According to Larkin, the blood drive could not have
occurred at a better time.
"We are short of A-positive and A-negative types,"
she said. "We've been short all week of one type or the
other, so this comes at a good time for us."
The Medical Center always relies heavily on dona
tions from Stanford students, who offer the benefits
of youth and good health. "We depend a lot on student
donors," she said.
Other participating fraternities were Alpha Ep
silon Pi, Alpha Phi Alpha, Lambda Phi Epsilon, Phi
Delta Theta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi,
Sigma Nu, Sigma Phi Epsilon and Zeta Psi. Mem
bers of Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta and
Kappa Kappa Gamma sororities also were at the
drive.
In addition to the blood drive, other Greek com
munity service activities include Stanford Service
Day, I labitat for Humanity and various other projects
in East Palo Alto, Gutierrez said.
