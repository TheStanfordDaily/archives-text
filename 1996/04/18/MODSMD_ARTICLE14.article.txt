Alledged battery at Women's Center
Stanford Police are investigating an alleged as
sault and battery which occurred at 11 a.m. on
April 5 between two women at the Women's Cen
ter. The battery, which involved only hands, was
apparently the result of a disagreement which
then escalated. Stanford Police Sgt. John Mc-
Mullen said that because the incident is still under
investigation, he could not comment.
Four juveniles sneak into pool
The new hot spot for Palo Alto youngsters has
apparently become apartment swimming pools.
Four juveniles were detained by Stanford Police
on April 7 and cited for trespassing in an apart
ment swimming pool on the corner of Page Mill
and Peter Coutts Itoad.
According to Stanford Police Sgt. John Mc-
Mullen, this type of trespassing has been a com
mon problem for the apartment complexes. "They
have a problem with kids climbing over the fence
and swimming in the pool and sitting in the hot
tub," he said.
Although the apartment management did not
press charges, "they are worried about the kids
climbing in and drowning or getting hurt," Mc-
Mullen said.
The trespassers are generally noisy and have
left beer bottles and trash behind after their ex
cursions, he said.
