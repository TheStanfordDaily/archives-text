# Fighting still rages on in Lebanon
## Beirut objects to cease-fire plan, says it violates Mideast peace settlement 
### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Even as Israel
raked Lebanon with new air attacks, the
I Lebanese government demanded changes yester
day in a U.S. plan to stop the fighting. Beirut said
the proposal would perpetuate Israel's control of
its southern region and violate the basic tenets of
a Mideast peace settlement.
Israel bombarded Hezbollah targets across
southern Lebanon for the seventh straight day,
and the guerrillas sent rockets crashing down on
northern Israel. Two people were killed and 17
were wounded in Lebanon, police reported.
Some 400,000 Lebanese have streamed out of
southern communities to escape the fighting,
and they are squeezed into relatives' houses,
airs, and crowded school classrooms. At least
17,000 people have been evacuated from north
ern Israel.
The United States, Israel's main ally, and
France, Lebanon's former colonial ruler, have
been trying separately to broker an armistice.
Neither proposal has been officially disclosed.
Lebanon's prime minister, liafik Hariri, and
foreign minister, Paris Bweiz, criticized the U.S.
plan because it doesn't demand an immediate
Israeli withdrawal from the enclave it controls in
southern Lebanon.
Bweiz, in Cairo, Egypt, for an emergency
meeting of Arab league foreign ministers, said
he had demanded basic changes in the proposals
and was waiting to hear from Washington.
The U.S. plan, he said, would undermine a
1978 U.N. Security Council resolution that
demands an unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from the 440-square-mile buffer zone Israel
carved out of southern Ijobanon in 1985 to block
cross-border attacks. Hezbollah has been fight

ing for more than a decade to drive Israeli troops
from the border zone.
Bweiz also said it contradicts the land-for
peace principle of the pence process launched in
1991.
Fighting raged yesterday, with fighter
bomhers, helicopter gunships and artillery based
in the Israeli-held enclave attacking guerrilla
rocket launchers and hide-outs near the port city
of Tyre and the market town of Nabatiyeh.
Two people were killed and 17 were wounded,
including two U.N. peacekeepers caught in the
cross fire in southern Lebanon, police reported.
Also, two Nepalese soldiers were wounded in a
guerrilla grenade attack.
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah fired three
salvos of Katyusha rockets into northern Israel,
wounding one person and damaging houses and
cars.
In all, 48 people have been killed and 187
wounded in the fighting.
Civilians have been hit hardest: Thirty-nine of
the dead were Ijebanese civilians.
The Israelis launched their recent campaign
to stop a series of recent Hezbollah attacks on
northern Israel. Hut the offensive has only
intensified the attacks, with the Israelis report
ing more than 200 Katyushas fired in the past
week.
Hezbollah says there are more to come.
Its Al-Manar television station broadcast
warnings in Hebrew, Arabic and English telling
Israelis to abandon homes in northern regions
targeted for attack.
The only way for Israeli settlements to be
secure "is for our civilians — children, women,
farmers — and villages to be safe from aggres-

sion," Hezbollah's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasral
lah, declared.
Meanwhile, Arab states at the United Nations
in New York formally asked the Security Council
yesterday to condemn Israel's bombardment and
demand its withdrawal from Lebanese territory.
The United States does not support the draft,
which does not mention the attacks on Israeli
territory.
As one of the five permanent members, the
United States could veto the resolution. No
immediate vote was expected.
Israeli officials said yesterday that the U.S.
proposals include placing international monitors
in the field and getting Syria, the dominant
power in Lebanon, to guarantee any agreement
to halt the fighting.
Israel would also be required to declare that it
has no claims on any Lebanese territory and
would be willing to withdraw its troops from the
buffer zone on condition Hezbollah is disarmed
and doesn't attack Israel for a fixed period.
Like the American proposal, the French plan
reportedly is based on a 1993 verbal agreement
under which both sides agreed to stop attacking
civilians.
Still, Prime Minister Hariri noted, Beirut
hasn't rejected either plan.
"We hope to see America and France cooper
ate together to make a joint proposal," he told a
news conference after meeting in London with
British Prime Minister John Major.
Two senior Israeli officials said Syria has been
cool to the idea of a broad, new agreement and
wants to restore the U.S.-brokered verbal under
standing reached after a similar Israeli offensive
against Hezbollah in -July 1993.
