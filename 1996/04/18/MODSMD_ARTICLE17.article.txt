## Democrats and Republicans both call for increase 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) Moderate House
Republicans broke ranks and joined
Democrats calling for an increase in the mini
mum wage, a vote Sen. Rob Dole and other
GOP leaders have tried to prevent.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey said
through an aide that he had no plans to sched
ule the bill for the floor. But with Democrats
also clamoring for a vote on a daily basis, other
lawmakers and aides in the GOP leadership
said the issue was virtually certain to reach
the floor of the House.
"All of us believe that people who work a

40-hour work week ought to earn a wage they
ran live on," said Rep. Jack Quinn, R-N.Y., as
he and 13 fellow Republicans unveiled their
bill yesterday.
The proposal would provide for two sepa
rate increases of 50 cents an hour, one to take
effect 90 days after the bill is signed by Presi
dent Clinton, and the second boost a year
after that.
Clinton and congressional Democrats sup
port a 90-cent-an-hour increase over two
years in the current federal minimum of $4.25
an hour.
