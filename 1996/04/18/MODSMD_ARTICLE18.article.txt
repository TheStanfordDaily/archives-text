Cholera kills in Monrovia
MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) - Tears
streaming into her wounds, 21-year
old Mianna Moor writhed in pain as a
doctor bandaged what was left of her
face after her chin was blown off. On a
piece of paper, she managed to scribble
that she was injured on Easter Sun
day.
Down the hospital hall, three more
people died of cholera yesterday in this

rebel-held compound, where about 200
others have the disease. All the safe
drinking water was gone. Food and
medical supplies were dwindling fast.
Some 10,000 refugees fled to the
seaside army training complex a week
ago, seeking shelter from a resurgence
in a 0-year-old civil war. Now they're
trapped there, caught in the middle of
a standoff between enemy factions,
another power struggle among war
lords.

Chrysler buys dealerships
TOKYO (AP) — Realizing it was hav
ing trouble getting Japanese dealerships
to stock its cars, Chrysler took matters
into its own hands: It spent $100 million
to buy its own chain of dealerships.
The result is a success story r.nd an
illustration of the difficulties of doing busi
ness in Japan. The purchase allows
Chrysler to run outlets directly and
ensures their models aren't shortchanged.
