# Medical merger?
## Faculty, staff raise concerns about combining Stanford, UCSF facilities 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Medical faculty and staff
voiced concerns and asked ques
tions about a proposed merger of
Stanford and UC-San Francisco
facilities at a town hall meeting
yesterday.
Dean of the School of Medicine
Eugene Bauer and Stanford
Health Services President Peter
Van Etten explained that the
merger would create an entity
with the combined clinical re
sources of the two medical centers
while maintaining separate med
ical schools.
Speaking to about 150 people
in Fairchild Auditorium yester
day, Bauer said this separation of
schools is necessary because of
the "different cultures" of the two

institutions, including the status
of UCSF as a public institution
working under rules and limita
tions that do not apply to Stan
ford.
Van Etten explained that the
merged company, which would be
a private, non-profit corporation,
would look to become the provider
of choice for highly specialized
care in the entire Bay Area while
still maintaining a role as a prima
ry-care provider in the immediate
locality.
"I think it's a significant op
portunity to take advantage of the
marketplace," Van Etten said.
An audience member suggest
ed UCSF's government-subsi
dized budget might lead to an un
balanced partnership in which
UCSF would dominate Stanford.
Van Etten denied this, saying
UCSF's status "doesn't mean
they're stronger or weaker, just a
different structure." He said the
schools and their budgets were
comparable in size.
Bauer and Van Etten said the
motivation for the merger was the
desire to promote university hos
pitals as alternatives to communi
ty hospitals.
Proving university hospitals'
worth is necessary, Bauer said,
because major insurance organi
zations often prefer the structure
of community hospitals.
"What we want to do," Van
Etten said, "is establish a brand
name identity for academic medi
cine as synonymous with special
ized care in this area."
Bauer stressed cancer care and
pediatrics as areas of specialized
care on which to concentrate. Both
Stanford and UCSF are construct
ing major new cancer facilities.

The combination of the Stan
ford expansions with new projects
at UCSF would allow for designa
tion as a comprehensive cancer

center by the National Cancer In
stitute, Bauer said, which could
lead to major new sources of gov
ernment funding.
The ability to combine special
ized programs was one of two
major advantages Bauer said the
schools would sustain from the
merger. The other was halting an
increasing lack of flexibility for
teaching caused by lack of re

sources.
The specifics of integration,
such as which departments are to
be combined, have yet to be
worked out, and Bauer stressed
that heads of individual depart
ments would be largely responsi
ble for details at their level.
Audience members also ex
pressed concern that the new com
pany would not have proper over
sight from the universities. Van
Etten insisted that there was little
danger in this area.
"There will be trustee and re
gent oversight of this," Van Etten
said. Stanford's Board of Trustees
and UCSF's Regents would retain
"certain reserve powers," he said,
ultimately including the authority
to "pull the plug."
Bauer also explained that the
merger "is not a done deal," and
that he, SHS management and
their UCSF counterparts are still
in intensive negotiations, with a
"self-imposed goal to reach an end
point by July 1."
Whatever agreement Bauer,
SHS and UCSF reach will have to
be ratified by the Stanford trustees
and UC Regents.
