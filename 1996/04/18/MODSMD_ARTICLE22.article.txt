## Theses and friendships 
### 
MY SISTER GRADUATED from
Stanford two years ago. Like me,
she majored in religious studies
and wrote an honors thesis. Hers was
titled "The Ethics of Friendship;" I re
read it this week.
My sister is a good person. She has a
brilliant, inquisitive mind that persistent
ly interrogates the world in a manner all
its own. Sometimes this has a downside â€”
she's prone to relentlessly over-analyzing
her life. But she's also healthily irrever
ent, and in the end can usually say "what
the hell." She may ask too many ques
tions, but she's rarely neurotic because
the questions are her own, both to ask and
answer. Fortunately, she's also a great
writer, so most of what goes on upstairs
usually makes its way to paper and
becomes enjoyable reading.
Reading her thesis I remembered the
friendships of her senior year which pro
vided the backdrop to her writing. Some of
the friendships from her first three years
at Stanford seriously deteriorated during
that year. Other friendships that had been
dormant for nearly two years rekindled
during spring quarter and provided her
with some very good times. A high school
boyfriend resurfaced and hasn't really left
the picture since. And there was our
friendship, constant as ever, if maybe a lit
tle strained by my sophomore slump. At
the center of it all was a woman whose
friendship would dominate my sister's
senior year. Their friendship I never com

pletely understood or appreciated; maybe
retarded a little bit by my jealousy. But
these stories constitute my memory of that
year, and I'm sure hers as well.
I'm suffering through my own honors
thesis right now. In it's own way, it is
about friendships too. I'm writing about a
bunch of sermons written by a monk in
the 12th century. Monasteries are quite
unusual places, cut off from the world and
run under very specific codes of conduct.
Life in them is heavily regimented, often
in order to suppress friendships in favor
of community strength and turn the
entire community's attentions to God.
Studying this strict and intentional
lifestyle provides a nice foil to the chaotic
milieu in which my own friendships form,
flourish and fail.
It was no coincidence that my sister
wrote an honors thesis on friendship, or
that I am doing the same. Theses are typi
cally written in the shadow of graduation,
a great arbiter of friendships. Graduation
turns tight friendships into relations of
commitment. Casual good times are
replaced by promises to call one another on
weekends or to visit on birthdays. Gradua
tion also snuffs out the loose friendships
which the convenience and proximity of a
college campus had allowed. Worst of all, it
permanently expires the potential friend
ships that were always around us but sim
ply weren't found.
College graduation is particularly sig
nificant in this regard because it ends of

a whole genre of friendships in our lives.
It forecloses the vast reserves of free
time and some measure of the spontane
ity which made our friendships up to
this point so intense. Friendships
formed under these heady conditions
become deeply saturated with emotion.
They are encapsulated in memories of
places and times. Mixed with the short
sightedness of youth they ferment into
nostalgia, which, like a good pop song,
will be pleasantly retrievable for the
remainder of our lives.
I'm not at all good with graduations
and endings. I let their inevitable pain
seep in prematurely; dragging it out, mak
ing myself miserable with anticipation.
Having some vague notion of the climax
and resolution that lay ahead, I try to dis
solve them into today's plot and ruin all
three in the process.
But it would be nice this time to be a lit
tle more irreverent, to defy graduation's
retroactive damper and amble towards the
end, blinded by cheer and driven by exu
berance. From here we move on to a stage
in life which favors couplings of unending
commitment, but perhaps in the meantime
we can honor our current friendships,
whose brevity is, in part, their brilliance.

Drew liapp smells like flowers, or so he
insists.
