# Josh Gohlke: Laughing leads to crying
## Rushers and Rushees really do like Rush, honest 
### 
IF TOPICALITY IS the refuge of the
topic-deficient, the recent deluge of
print and prattle about Fraternity
and Sorority Rush is no more surprising
than it is every year. And if perceived
popularity is the first consideration in
the formation of opinions, we need not
ask why everyone finds it necessary to
say, essentially, "Gee whiz, Rush sure is
bad!"
Popularity aside, as always, the
marginalized must have a voice. If you
and all your friends agree that hemor
rhoids really hurt, I suppose the only
worthwhile opinion available to me is
that they actually feel pretty good.
My point, of course, is that Rush, like
hemorrhoids, is actually pretty good.
Great, even. And if you don't believe me,
just ask some of the numerous aspiring
and active Greeks who agree. I did.
"1 think Rush is cool because, like,
anything could happen," one Pi Phi
active told me. "I mean, like, three years
ago, we got a smart, quiet girl. She must
have de-pledged. Hut, like, that could
happen again. You never know."

The greatest charm of the rushing
process does indeed lie in its unpre
dictability. The possibility of Rush viola
tions lends an element of danger to the
lackluster life of any freshman.
"A couple of guys gave me a beer at one
event," said one Rushee who preferred
that his name not be used. "Before I knew
it, an hour had passed and I had con
sumed the whole thing. I went back to my
dorm and called home. I was, like, 'Hey,
Mom, I'm drunk!' It was awesome."
Most active fraternity members said
they generally obey t he rules of Rush, but
still find ways to have fun.
"The Rush code says we can't get guys
drunk, but it doesn't say anything about
beating the hell out of them," said
"Mitch," a junior.
Hut Rush isn't just beating the hell
out of people; it's a positive experience for
many other reasons. In fact, Stanford's
largest fraternity focuses on community
service, so for many freshman Rush is
just the beginning of a life of political
activism.
"I remember the first Sig Fp event I

went to," one freshman said. "I show up
at 553 Mayfield, and next thing I know
I'm as high as a kite and serving food at a
soup kitchen! This active comes up to me
and says, 'Come on, you shitty maggot,
get some muscle into those mashed pota
toes!' I couldn't quite handle the whole
scene, so I never pledged."
Rush may have an ominous cast to it
for many non-Greeks, simply because
they don't know what goes on behind
closed doors or tent-flaps. But most
would be pleasantly surprised by the
innocuous proceedings.
"It's really not bad at all," one sorori
ty Kushee explained. "I mean, I was a lit
tle scared about the full pelvic exam, but
luckily a bike accident deprived me of my
hymen a few days before Rush. You
know, virgins just don't get into the Top
Three."
Many students have criticized the
inherently exclusive nature of the rush
ing process, but some participants have
noted that selectivity is not intrinsically
undesirable.
"Everyone complains about sororities

excluding people," one freshman girl
said. "But I think that's the whole point.
I don't want to hang out with annoying
fat girls my whole life. I want to hang out
with annoying skinny girls."
A freshman on the boys' side agreed.
"Not everyone enjoys all-nude, all
dude activities, and that's OK," he said.
"But the Chi house is for me because I do
enjoy such activities."
For many freshmen, Rush represents
an otherwise unmatched opportunity
learn about their own values as much as
the values of others.
"The Pi Phis told me I wasn't pretty
enough," one Arroyo resident said. "At
first I was upset, but then I decided it was
fair, because I realized I'm not very pret
ty. So, in the end, I think I learned a lot
about myself."
Rush is also a chance to learn about
others. Some of the most influential peo
ple on campus are members of the Greek
system, and Rush gives newcomers a
chance to meet those people on a person
al level.
"At one of the events I met this guy

who writes a column for The Daily," said
"Johnny," a freshman. "I told him I
thought he was 'funny as shit.' He
punched me in the face, but I think he
liked me."
Finally, many critics of Rush forget
that it's a win-win situation that ends
with every individual freely choosing
the best path for him, whether Greek or
not.
"I opted not to join a fraternity house,
and I'm glad," one sophomore said. "I
live in Roble now, and it's great. The din
ing hall has free soda all night, and we
have these hall meetings with food and
stuff, and my RA's just the coolest guy.
He draws these funny pictures on the
dry-erase board. It's a lot of fun. It's
great."
