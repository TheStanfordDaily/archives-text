Bosnian ambassador
supports funding for
Stanford's SAGE
It is with great disappointment and
sadness that Students Against Geno
cide may not be receiving the financial
assistance it so richly deserves.
The situation in Bosnia and Herze
govina requires as much attention as
ever before. Bosnian Serb war crimi
nals have not been removed from
power, and reconstruction efforts for
rebuilding our war-ravaged country
are only beginning. The tasks before
us are daunting.
SAGE at Stanford has been at the
center of the American effort to assist
Bosnia and Herzegovina throughout
the four years of war. Now that the war
is over, Stanford students are in an
ideal position to host intellectuals and
willing sponsors and organize a vital
conference on reconstruction. The lat
ter would open up a link with the Sili
con Valley community, while strength
ening ties with American universities.
These are just a few examples of the
critical role that SAGE should contin
ue to play. I commend their noble and
tireless efforts in assisting the popula
tion of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

lUC misrepresented
in Daily, leader says
As co-chair of the International
Undergraduate Community, I feel that
The Daily misrepresented the facts in
its election endorsement comment. The
ILK' is not "just another special-inter
est" group. Although international stu
dents constitute a significant portion of
the Stanford student population (5 per
cent of the undergraduates), the orga
nization was deliberately called the
"International Community" and not an
"International Student Club." This
stemmed from our belief that Stanford
has many students who have had
transforming international experiences
and even more students who are gen
uinely interested in international
affairs, people and cultures. Our goal is
to provide a forum for members of the
Stanford community who have an

international interest and to facilitate
their interaction with the Stanford
community at large. The lUC therefore
is not an organization of "foreign" stu
dents but of international people,
whatever their citizenship may be.
The Daily not only misunderstood the
purpose of our organization, but also
seems to be equally misinformed about
the functions of various arms of the Stan
ford administration. The Bechtel Interna
tional Center's primary purpose is to look
after the administrative needs of interna
tional students and scholars, a job it does
extremely well. Asking the center to be
our primary fund-raiser would bo unfea
sible and impossible. The Daily's argu
ment is analogous to saying: sL.-e the
Asian American Activities Center exists,
why should you fund AASA? Or even bet
ter, since we have Residential Education
and the Dean of Students' Office, why
fund student organizations at all? In fact,
the international center has been
extremely generous and has helped us out
throughout, even with an extremely lim
ited source of funds and with the very
large student body it supports (35 nation
al student organizations with a popula
tion of around 3,000).
It's ironic that The Daily advised
lUC to set up an International Week
which supposedly benefits the whole of
Stanford, as if this was a novel idea and
The Daily's brainchild. In fact, we had
organized an International Week last
quarter without any institutional ASSU
funding. It is insulting to the numerous
members of our organization that
solicited dorm funds to suggest that we
have not explored other avenues. Dur
ing the International Week, we had an
informal chat session with University
President Gerhard Casper that was
broadcast over SCBN, talks by the
director of the international center and
the director of international undergrad
uate admissions about immigration
issues, an international movie night, a
talk about Japanese education by the
Director of the U.S.-Japan Technology
Management Center and a subsidized
international dinner. In fact, in spite of
our efforts, we were hamstrung by lack
of funds and it is because of this reason
that we are on the ballot.
This is a time of nativist anti-for
eign backlash in this country. It is
unfortunate that at a time of increas
ing global interdependence, even at
bastions of enlightenment like Stan
ford, the spirit of internationalism is
considered irrelevant and outside the
purview of mainstream student life.

Stanford has a history of educating
business and political leaders from
around the world, and it is our under
graduate colleagues who will become
the movers and shakers in their coun
tries. Ignoring the world and its people
can only be done at one's own peril.

Film Society deserves
support of students
The Daily was justified in withhold
ing a recommendation on the Stanford
Film Society's special-fee request. As
members of a new organization that is
less than one year old, it would be
unreasonable for us to assert that we
have proven ourselves and the success
of the society to the Stanford commu
nity. Recognizing this consideration,
we streamlined our budget to only
include funding for types of events
which we know that we have success
fully held thus far. Further, if we
obtain our request, which amounts to
$2.32 per student for the entire year,
it is only expected to fund one-third to
a half of our operations for 1996-1997.
For these reasons, we ask you to
support us in the general election. This
year, functioning chiefly on a grant
from the Stanford Alumni Association
and ASSU Program Board funding, the
society has progressed toward reaching
its goals already. We consider our three
greatest accomplishments thus far to
be co-sponsoring Oliver Stone's campus
appearance, screening "Kids" for more
than 1,800 people and producing two
Bmm films, with two 16mm produc
tions in the works. More than a dozen
film screenings are scheduled for this
quarter alone.
Next year, the society looks to
accomplish much more, highlighted by
a major quarterly thematic series fea
turing speakers and films on multiple
evenings (Fall 1996's will be "The Psy
chology of Violence.") We also plan to
screen more films, largely in our new
"Crossing Communities Through
Film" series. Our production endeav
ors, too, will be augmented and will
each involve roughly 50 people. A
strong, active membership is also vital
to our success, and we will focus more
on providing educational and social
events that center around film. The
society's board will be restructured to

correct problems that arose this year.
And, as our group continues to grow,
we will gain leverage to advocate for
enhanced academic resources and
classes through which to approach film
intelligently.
In creating the "viable film society"
that the Daily says would be a "wel
come addition to Stanford," a vicious
cycle exists. To generate legitimacy,
membership and interest, and to be
successful in outside fund-raising, we
must hold exciting events for a large
portion of the community. But to hold
these events, we need a substantial
amount of money (which, as a result of
mandatory technician and mainte
nance fees, in addition to film rental
costs, amounts to roughly $1,000 per
film on the Stanford campus).
We ask you to fund our foundation
events for next year so that we can
more easily strive to obtain the ambi
tious goals that The Daily and we
know that we hold. Please vote "yes"
for the Stanford Film Society's special
fee request. Help us to establish the
new tradition for meaningful film
study at Stanford that we all desire.

plans programs with
all students in mind
What The Daily did not tell you
when it chose not to endorse the Stan
ford Model United Nations special fee
is that our group is planning several
innovative projects for the coming
year. These include a class on the Unit
ed Nations and a conference for Stan
ford Students only — based on very
successful conferences held at Oxford
University for the past two years.
This Stanford Model United
Nations conference, to be held October
11-13, takes up more than 31 percent
of our special-fee budget. Stanford
undergraduates and graduate students
will come and debate issues currently

before the United Nations, including
war crimes in former Yugoslavia,
international immigration and inter
national environmental agreements.
This project is being planned in con
junction with the California Institute
of International Studies, which has
already invited speakers including
Secretary of State Warren Christopher
to the conference. This type of in
depth discussion on international
issues among all Stanford students is
urgently needed.
In contrast, the sum total of our
expenses in sending delegates to other
conferences is just over 16 percent of
our budget. Students already pay a
majority of their flight and hotel
expenses for these conferences, while
the club only gives a small subsidy to
those in need — to open this opportu
nity to students who would not other
wise be able to go.
And where does the rest of the
money go? Seventeen percent goes to
panel discussions and receptions with
our renowned faculty advisory board.
We presented panels on war crimes in
former Yugoslavia and nuclear prolifer
ation last quarter, and have panels this
quarter on the recent wave of terrorism
in Israel and on the role of the United
States in the United Nations. Surely
keeping informed debate 011 these
issues available to the Stanford campus
is worth $0.72 a student, not quite a
food service Snapple at last count.
The remainder of our budget, just
under 30 percent of it, goes to holding
a Model United Nations, conference
for high school students. Again, The
Daily failed to inform you that this
conference is almost entirely self
financed. This project is being planned
in conjunction with the Mid-Peninsula
Chapter of the United Nations Associ
ation and with the World Forum of
San Jose, and seeks to bring students
from every high school in Santa Clara
county to the conference, their fees
paid by scholarship money raised by
the World Forum.
As the only registered undergradu
ate group at Stanford concerned with
international relations, and as one
devoted to bringing awareness, educa
tion and communication about these
important issues to campus and the
community at large, we ask that you
vote yes 011 the Stanford Model United
Nations special fee.

is over, Stanford students are in an
ideal position to host intellectuals and
willing sponsors and organize a vital
conference on reconstruction. The lat
ter would open up a link with the Sili
con Valley community, while strength
ening ties with American universities.
These are just a few examples of the
critical role that SAGE should contin
ue to play. I commend their noble and
tireless efforts in assisting the popula
tion of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

lUC misrepresented
in Daily, leader says
As co-chair of the International
Undergraduate Community, I feel that
The Daily misrepresented the facts in
its election endorsement comment. The
ILK' is not "just another special-inter
est" group. Although international stu
dents constitute a significant portion of
the Stanford student population (5 per
cent of the undergraduates), the orga
nization was deliberately called the
"International Community" and not an
"International Student Club." This
stemmed from our belief that Stanford
has many students who have had
transforming international experiences
and even more students who are gen
uinely interested in international
affairs, people and cultures. Our goal is
to provide a forum for members of the
Stanford community who have an

international interest and to facilitate
their interaction with the Stanford
community at large. The lUC therefore
is not an organization of "foreign" stu
dents but of international people,
whatever their citizenship may be.
The Daily not only misunderstood the
purpose of our organization, but also
seems to be equally misinformed about
the functions of various arms of the Stan
ford administration. The Bechtel Interna
tional Center's primary purpose is to look
after the administrative needs of interna
tional students and scholars, a job it does
extremely well. Asking the center to be
our primary fund-raiser would bo unfea
sible and impossible. The Daily's argu
ment is analogous to saying: sL.-e the
Asian American Activities Center exists,
why should you fund AASA? Or even bet
ter, since we have Residential Education
and the Dean of Students' Office, why
fund student organizations at all? In fact,
the international center has been
extremely generous and has helped us out
throughout, even with an extremely lim
ited source of funds and with the very
large student body it supports (35 nation
al student organizations with a popula
tion of around 3,000).
It's ironic that The Daily advised
lUC to set up an International Week
which supposedly benefits the whole of
Stanford, as if this was a novel idea and
The Daily's brainchild. In fact, we had
organized an International Week last
quarter without any institutional ASSU
funding. It is insulting to the numerous
members of our organization that
solicited dorm funds to suggest that we
have not explored other avenues. Dur
ing the International Week, we had an
informal chat session with University
President Gerhard Casper that was
broadcast over SCBN, talks by the
director of the international center and
the director of international undergrad
uate admissions about immigration
issues, an international movie night, a
talk about Japanese education by the
Director of the U.S.-Japan Technology
Management Center and a subsidized
international dinner. In fact, in spite of
our efforts, we were hamstrung by lack
of funds and it is because of this reason
that we are on the ballot.
This is a time of nativist anti-for
eign backlash in this country. It is
unfortunate that at a time of increas
ing global interdependence, even at
bastions of enlightenment like Stan
ford, the spirit of internationalism is
considered irrelevant and outside the
purview of mainstream student life.

Stanford has a history of educating
business and political leaders from
around the world, and it is our under
graduate colleagues who will become
the movers and shakers in their coun
tries. Ignoring the world and its people
can only be done at one's own peril.

Film Society deserves
support of students
The Daily was justified in withhold
ing a recommendation on the Stanford
Film Society's special-fee request. As
members of a new organization that is
less than one year old, it would be
unreasonable for us to assert that we
have proven ourselves and the success
of the society to the Stanford commu
nity. Recognizing this consideration,
we streamlined our budget to only
include funding for types of events
which we know that we have success
fully held thus far. Further, if we
obtain our request, which amounts to
$2.32 per student for the entire year,
it is only expected to fund one-third to
a half of our operations for 1996-1997.
For these reasons, we ask you to
support us in the general election. This
year, functioning chiefly on a grant
from the Stanford Alumni Association
and ASSU Program Board funding, the
society has progressed toward reaching
its goals already. We consider our three
greatest accomplishments thus far to
be co-sponsoring Oliver Stone's campus
appearance, screening "Kids" for more
than 1,800 people and producing two
Bmm films, with two 16mm produc
tions in the works. More than a dozen
film screenings are scheduled for this
quarter alone.
Next year, the society looks to
accomplish much more, highlighted by
a major quarterly thematic series fea
turing speakers and films on multiple
evenings (Fall 1996's will be "The Psy
chology of Violence.") We also plan to
screen more films, largely in our new
"Crossing Communities Through
Film" series. Our production endeav
ors, too, will be augmented and will
each involve roughly 50 people. A
strong, active membership is also vital
to our success, and we will focus more
on providing educational and social
events that center around film. The
society's board will be restructured to

correct problems that arose this year.
And, as our group continues to grow,
we will gain leverage to advocate for
enhanced academic resources and
classes through which to approach film
intelligently.
In creating the "viable film society"
that the Daily says would be a "wel
come addition to Stanford," a vicious
cycle exists. To generate legitimacy,
membership and interest, and to be
successful in outside fund-raising, we
must hold exciting events for a large
portion of the community. But to hold
these events, we need a substantial
amount of money (which, as a result of
mandatory technician and mainte
nance fees, in addition to film rental
costs, amounts to roughly $1,000 per
film on the Stanford campus).
We ask you to fund our foundation
events for next year so that we can
more easily strive to obtain the ambi
tious goals that The Daily and we
know that we hold. Please vote "yes"
for the Stanford Film Society's special
fee request. Help us to establish the
new tradition for meaningful film
study at Stanford that we all desire.

plans programs with
all students in mind
What The Daily did not tell you
when it chose not to endorse the Stan
ford Model United Nations special fee
is that our group is planning several
innovative projects for the coming
year. These include a class on the Unit
ed Nations and a conference for Stan
ford Students only — based on very
successful conferences held at Oxford
University for the past two years.
This Stanford Model United
Nations conference, to be held October
11-13, takes up more than 31 percent
of our special-fee budget. Stanford
undergraduates and graduate students
will come and debate issues currently

before the United Nations, including
war crimes in former Yugoslavia,
international immigration and inter
national environmental agreements.
This project is being planned in con
junction with the California Institute
of International Studies, which has
already invited speakers including
Secretary of State Warren Christopher
to the conference. This type of in
depth discussion on international
issues among all Stanford students is
urgently needed.
In contrast, the sum total of our
expenses in sending delegates to other
conferences is just over 16 percent of
our budget. Students already pay a
majority of their flight and hotel
expenses for these conferences, while
the club only gives a small subsidy to
those in need — to open this opportu
nity to students who would not other
wise be able to go.
And where does the rest of the
money go? Seventeen percent goes to
panel discussions and receptions with
our renowned faculty advisory board.
We presented panels on war crimes in
former Yugoslavia and nuclear prolifer
ation last quarter, and have panels this
quarter on the recent wave of terrorism
in Israel and on the role of the United
States in the United Nations. Surely
keeping informed debate 011 these
issues available to the Stanford campus
is worth $0.72 a student, not quite a
food service Snapple at last count.
The remainder of our budget, just
under 30 percent of it, goes to holding
a Model United Nations, conference
for high school students. Again, The
Daily failed to inform you that this
conference is almost entirely self
financed. This project is being planned
in conjunction with the Mid-Peninsula
Chapter of the United Nations Associ
ation and with the World Forum of
San Jose, and seeks to bring students
from every high school in Santa Clara
county to the conference, their fees
paid by scholarship money raised by
the World Forum.
As the only registered undergradu
ate group at Stanford concerned with
international relations, and as one
devoted to bringing awareness, educa
tion and communication about these
important issues to campus and the
community at large, we ask that you
vote yes 011 the Stanford Model United
Nations special fee.

supports funding for
Stanford's SAGE
It is with great disappointment and
sadness that Students Against Geno
cide may not be receiving the financial
assistance it so richly deserves.
The situation in Bosnia and Herze
govina requires as much attention as
ever before. Bosnian Serb war crimi
nals have not been removed from
power, and reconstruction efforts for
rebuilding our war-ravaged country
are only beginning. The tasks before
us are daunting.
SAGE at Stanford has been at the
center of the American effort to assist
Bosnia and Herzegovina throughout
the four years of war. Now that the war
is over, Stanford students are in an
ideal position to host intellectuals and
willing sponsors and organize a vital
conference on reconstruction. The lat
ter would open up a link with the Sili
con Valley community, while strength
ening ties with American universities.
These are just a few examples of the
