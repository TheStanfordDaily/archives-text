## Softball splits two with San Jose State 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The Stanford softball team
took the field yesterday against
San Jose State without the pres
ence of its most lethal weapon,
freshman pitcher Becky Blevins,
and managed to split with the
Spartans in cold, rainy weather.
The Cardinal (22-19 overall, 5-9 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) won
the first game 5-4 in eight innings
before dropping the nightcap 7-5.
In the first game, Stanford was
forced into extra innings for the
second game in a row. Freshman
Marcy Crouch, who hit the game
winning home run in the ninth in

fifth innings. The Cardinal's one
run in the fourth made the score
4-4 and carried the game into
extra innings. Crouch held the
Spartans in the top of the eighth
to give Stanford the chance to go
for the win.
"Marcy did a nice job," head
coach Sandy Pearce said. "She
struggled at the beginning but
came around and did what she
needed to do. The [entire] team
played well in the first game and
did what we needed to do."
Scoring a run was what the
Cardinal needed to do in the bot
tom of the eighth, and they man
aged just that. Senior Lynn An
derson led oft the inning with a
walk and was bunted over to sec
ond by junior Amanda Renteria.
After a force out at first and a field
ingerrorby the Spartans, runners
were on first and third with one
out for freshman Michelle Schnei
der, who ripped a game-winning
RBI single to right field to end the
game at 5-4.
In the closer, however, run pro
