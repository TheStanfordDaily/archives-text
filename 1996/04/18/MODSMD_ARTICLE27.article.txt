## Softball splits two with San Jose State 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The Stanford softball team
took the field yesterday against
San Jose State without the pres
ence of its most lethal weapon,
freshman pitcher Becky Blevins,
and managed to split with the
Spartans in cold, rainy weather.
The Cardinal (22-19 overall, 5-9 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) won
the first game 5-4 in eight innings
before dropping the nightcap 7-5.
In the first game, Stanford was
forced into extra innings for the
second game in a row. Freshman
Marcy Crouch, who hit the game
winning home run in the ninth in
ning of the Cardinal's last game,
pitched game one in Blevins' ab
sence. Blevins, who is ranked
among the Pac-10's leaders in
ERA, recently sustained an ankle
injury and is questionable for this
weekend's conference trip to Ore
gon.
Stanford jumped to an early
lead due to a three-run first in
ning, but the Spartans fought
back, scoring two runs in the sec
ond and addintr two more on solo

home runs in the third and the
fifth innings. The Cardinal's one
run in the fourth made the score
4-4 and carried the game into
extra innings. Crouch held the
Spartans in the top of the eighth
to give Stanford the chance to go
for the win.
"Marcy did a nice job," head
coach Sandy Pearce said. "She
struggled at the beginning but
came around and did what she
needed to do. The [entire] team
played well in the first game and
did what we needed to do."
Scoring a run was what the
Cardinal needed to do in the bot
tom of the eighth, and they man
aged just that. Senior Lynn An
derson led oft the inning with a
walk and was bunted over to sec
ond by junior Amanda Renteria.
After a force out at first and a field
ingerrorby the Spartans, runners
were on first and third with one
out for freshman Michelle Schnei
der, who ripped a game-winning
RBI single to right field to end the
game at 5-4.
In the closer, however, run pro
duction did not come so easily for
Stanford. The Spartans took an
early lead, scoring two runs in each
of the first two innings. The Cardi
nal threatened to cut into the lead
with a quick score in the bottom of
the first but had their offensive ef
forts thwarted by San Jose until the
fifth inning.
Down 6-0 after one-run third and
fourth innings by the Spartans, the
Stanford bats finally made a little
noise. Crouch led off with a walk and
was followed by freshman Kelly
Yablonski's single. Freshman Shane

Anderson then ripped a two-tun
triple to cut the lead to four. Ander
son's blast was followed by an RBI
ground rule double from sophomore
Becky Unruh, and after another
walk and a two-run double from ju
nior Summer Lee, the Spartan lead
was one.
Stanford managed to put the
tying run on base in the bottom of
the seventh but was unable to capi
talize, giving SJSU a 7-5 victory.
"I think playing our local rival is
always a good game," Pearce said.
"But it's tough because it's not a
Pac-10 game and it's not at that
level. [In the second game] we only
scored in that one inning, and some
games come down to [who capital
izes the most |. We had chances."
