### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
The college tennis titans will
clash again this weekend in Ix>s An
geles. The No. 2 Stanford Cardinal
(19-2 overall, 7-1 in the Pacific 10
Southern Division) headed south
this morning in preparation for its
match tomorrow afternoon against
No. 7 USC, and its match Saturday
against top-ranked UCLA.
If the tennis this weekend is any
thing like that witnessed earlier this
month when Stanford played host to
the southern rivals, fans in Los An
geles will not disappointed. On
April 5, in one of the most exciting
matches anyone can remember,
Stanford lost to UCIA 4-3 when the
Bruins star sophomore, Justin
Gimelstob, defeated Cardinal cap
tain Jeff Salzenstein in a third set
tie breaker.
While t lie USC match did not fea
ture quite the same theatrics, it was
nonetheless a nail-biter. Stanford
was leading 3-2, with only the second
and third singles matches left to
play. At that point, both senior Jim
Thomas and sophomore Paul Gold
stein, playing second and third sin
gles, respectively, were down a break
in the third set. All USC had to do

was hold serve to win the match. But
Thomas and Goldstein had other
ideas.
Goldstein drew first blo<xl for the
Card, breaking back and then win
ning his match to clinch the victory.
Thomas also came through, and the
end result was a 5-2 Stanford win.
Stanford's only two losses have
come at the hands of the Bruins; the
first ended the Cardinal's 37-match
winning streak and the second
marked the first time Stanford had
lostat home in over two years. While
avenging those defeat s weighs 1 leavy
on the team's heart, Cardinal play
ers are quick to point out that the
USC match is the more important of
the two.
"Sure, we would love to beat
IJCliAdown south, but wecan'tlook
past our match against USC. A win
over USC should lock us into no
worse than a two seed at t he NCAAs,
and that's what we ne<xl right now,"
Salzenstein said.
Salzenstein, ranked fifth in the
most recent college polls, will have
his hands full nil weekend. 1 le faces

country in the third-ranked Gimel
