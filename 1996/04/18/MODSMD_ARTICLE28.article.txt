# Men head to L.A for crucial Pac-10 clash
## 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
The college tennis titans will
clash again this weekend in Ix>s An
geles. The No. 2 Stanford Cardinal
(19-2 overall, 7-1 in the Pacific 10
Southern Division) headed south
this morning in preparation for its
match tomorrow afternoon against
No. 7 USC, and its match Saturday
against top-ranked UCLA.
If the tennis this weekend is any
thing like that witnessed earlier this
month when Stanford played host to
the southern rivals, fans in Los An
geles will not disappointed. On
April 5, in one of the most exciting
matches anyone can remember,
Stanford lost to UCIA 4-3 when the
Bruins star sophomore, Justin
Gimelstob, defeated Cardinal cap
tain Jeff Salzenstein in a third set
tie breaker.
While t lie USC match did not fea
ture quite the same theatrics, it was
nonetheless a nail-biter. Stanford
was leading 3-2, with only the second
and third singles matches left to
play. At that point, both senior Jim
Thomas and sophomore Paul Gold
stein, playing second and third sin
gles, respectively, were down a break
in the third set. All USC had to do

was hold serve to win the match. But
Thomas and Goldstein had other
ideas.
Goldstein drew first blo<xl for the
Card, breaking back and then win
ning his match to clinch the victory.
Thomas also came through, and the
end result was a 5-2 Stanford win.
Stanford's only two losses have
come at the hands of the Bruins; the
first ended the Cardinal's 37-match
winning streak and the second
marked the first time Stanford had
lostat home in over two years. While
avenging those defeat s weighs 1 leavy
on the team's heart, Cardinal play
ers are quick to point out that the
USC match is the more important of
the two.
"Sure, we would love to beat
IJCliAdown south, but wecan'tlook
past our match against USC. A win
over USC should lock us into no
worse than a two seed at t he NCAAs,
and that's what we ne<xl right now,"
Salzenstein said.
Salzenstein, ranked fifth in the
most recent college polls, will have
his hands full nil weekend. 1 le faces
two of the premier players in the
country in the third-ranked Gimel
stob and the Trojan's freshman
standout, No. 2 C,ecil Mamiit.
Mamiit and Salzenstein have
faced -off twice already this year. The
Stanford senior won the first en
counter in the finals of the Rolex In
door Championships, but Mamiit
struck back at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium, winning in consecutive tie
breakers, 7-6, 7-6.
Salzenstein has also run into
Gimelstob twice this season. I le lost
b(jth times, most recently in the
above mentioned tie-breaker. He
called that match "one of the most
disappointing results in his career."
"I don't feel like I played all that
bad bust time I played those guys. I
put myself in a position where I
could win both matches, I just didn't
come through on some of the big
points," he said. "Because I played
them so close, there's not a lot I'm
going to change in terms of strategy,
hut hopefully 1 can execute a little
better, especially on the big points."
Singles will only be part of this
weekend's show, however. The
UCLA match will pit the top two
doubles teams in the country
against one another. Stanford's
Thomas and (ioldstein, who moved
up from the sixth position all the
way to No. 2, will try to duplicate
their performance earlier this
month when they knocked off

UCLA's then-and-current No. 1
duo of Srdjan Muskatirovic and
Gimelstob.
Even with two wins this weekend,
it may be impossible for the Cardinal
to regain the top spot in the rankings.
The Bruins are still undefeated and
would boast the best record in college
tennis win or lose. Nevertheless, the
match is decidedly important. A
third-straight loss to their in-state ri
vals could instill some doubt into the
traditionally confident Card.
"UCLA has beaten us twice now,
and it would really be a big emotion
al boost for us to beat them down
there. We will have cleared a big hur
dle if we win," said senior Ricky
Becker. "Then we'd know for sure
that we can beat them when the
NC'AAs come around."
The key to the No. 1 vs. No. 2 bat
tle may actually lie in positions four
through six. Stanford players believe
they may have the edge at the lower
end of the line-up. At fourth, fifth
and sixth singles resjiectively, No. 9
freshman Ryan Wolters, No. 86 ju
nior Grant Elliott and No. 52 Becker
have all won at least one match
against their Bruin counterparts
this year.
"UCLA is very good at the top of
their lineup. Their first three guys
are all ranked in the top 30," said
Wolters. "I think we're a deeper
team, though. We've already swept
them at doubles, and I think Grant,
Ricky and I lire all very capable of
beating the bottom of their lineup."
