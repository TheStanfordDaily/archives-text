For a struggling team with five straight loss
es and only one Pacific 10 Conference victory,
Stanford Tennis Stadium proved to be the last
place for a visit.
The No. 2 Stanford women's tennis team,
back at home after four straight road wins, ex
tended its home winning streak to 13, its Pac-10
winning streak to 22 and its overall winning
streak to 11 with a 6-0 whitewashing of archri
val No. 31 California.
"This is another notch in our belts, so to
speak," Stanford head coach Frank Brennan
said. "I'm really starting to believe in the girls
and their ability to compete.
"This is what I hoped for. We finally inter
cepted a team like this and had a nice blowout.
They've had a tough year and I understand
that."
The Cardinal (20-1 overall, 8-0 Pac-10 Con
ference Southern Division) sent the Bears even
further into their tailspin. Cal (8-12, 1-7) has
now dropped 12 of its last 14 contests and has
only one conference win.
Despite a one-hour rain delay and rainy and
windy conditions throughout the match, Stan
ford jumped all over the Bears immediately,
winning the first set in each singles match and
pulling all six of them out, making doubles play
unnecessary.
"The biggest thing I was worried about was
the rain," Brennan said. "With it being on and
off like that, it can lx> a nightmare."
On the No. 1 court, Cal's Pam Enkoji, who
upset junior Kat ie Schlukebir in the first Stan
ford-( 'al matchup, began to climb back into the
match after Stanford sophomore Ania Bleszyn
ski (15-6)jumpedouttoas-01ead in the first set.
Yet Bleszynski broke serve to take the set 6-
2, and despite a slow start in the second set,
pulled out the match as the rain began to fall by
breaking Enkoji twice for a 6-2,6-3 win.
"I thought I played well in the first set,"
Bleszynski said. "But 1 had a little lapse in the
second set, in the beginning, but I think when
the rain started, it motivated me to get the
match over with."
I?rennan agreed that Ania lost concentration
a bit in the second set.
"Ania stepped up nicely," Brennan said.
"She didn't fall asleep in the second set. She
took a little nap, but she didn't doze off com
pletely."
Bleszynski utilized an overpowering serve to
put Enkoji on her heels throughout the match
and tried to be even more aggressive in return
ing Enkoji's weaker serve.
Schlukebir (16-4) avenged a March loss by
downing Cal's Amanda Augustus in the No. 2
match, 6-2,6-3.
Cardinal junior Sandra De Silva (15-4) took
care of business quickly on the No. 3 court,
shaking off Cal's Stephanie Tibbits in straight
sets. 6-3. 6-0.
