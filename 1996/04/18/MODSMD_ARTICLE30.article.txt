# Stanford track gears up for Cal, postseason
## 
### Sam Wang Contributing writer 
It is getting close to do-or-die
time for the Stanford track ath
letes who want to be invited to the
Pacific 10 Conference champi

onships next month.
The next two weekends present a
major opportunity for Cardinal ath
letes — at least those who haven't
yet done so — to qualify for the
championships.
The upcoming series of invita

tionals and relay events may be the
last chance for the Cardinal. Start
ing on May 4, when Stanford runs in
the Big Meet against the University
of California, the Cardinal will no
longer be concerned about individ
ual performances. Instead, Stanford

will be concentrating solely on scor
ing points and winning the team
competition. Runners will be run
ning strategically, with their focus
being on scoring points with high
finishes as opposed to getting a cer
tain time.
However, this weekend at the
Mount San Antonio College (Mt.
SAC) Ilelays in Walnut, Calif., Stan
ford's attention will be centered on
posting the possible marks.
"This weekend should be good
weather conditions and it will give us
a good opportunity to get some good
performances," said head coach Vin
Lananna. "On May 4, when we mn
Big Meet against Cal, we're not
going to worry about performance,
we'll just be worried about points."
Mt. SAC is one of the largest track
and field events in the nation. Hun
dreds of colleges and universities will
be sending representatives to Wal
nut to try to hit qualification marks
for their respective conferences.
"The whole country converges on
Mt. SAC to run good times." lianan
na said.
Ijimanna hopes to qualify 24 men
and 24 women for the Pac-lOs by the
end of the season. Lananna tried to
bolster the chance of fulfilling this
goal by resting numerous athletes,
especially the distance runners and
the sprinters, last weekend when
Stanford traveled to Berkeley to par
ticipate in the Pierce Golden Bear
Challenge.
The women put in a workman
like performance and placed third in
the competition. Meanwhile, the
men finished a solid fifth. Both
teams had people stepping up to fill
the voids created by the absence of
some of the stars.
"We looked good. We'll be bring
ing most of the kids we rested last
weekend, and once we put all the
people back in the lineup, it's actual
ly very, very exciting," said.
Among three athletes who will

not be making the trip are sopho
mores Josh Gleason and Katrinka
Jackson and freshman Tracye
Lawyer. The trio will be heading
south to compete in the Azusa-Pa
cific Decathlon / Heptathlon, which
will be the only opportunity for the
three to participate in a full multi
event competition in the regular
season.
Gleason faces the daunting chal
lenge of following in the footsteps of
former Cardinal Travis Clark, the
Pac-10 champion in the decathlon

last year. I lowever, it is unfair to ask
Gleason to duplicate's ('lark's per
formance.
"Will he win the Pac-lOs? I don't
think he wi 11," Lanan na said of G lea
son. "I think he will hopefully quali
fy forthePac-lOs and I think he can
score in the Pac-lOs."
As for the hcptathletes, it will be
difficult to predict what will happen
this weekend because neither Jack
son nor Lawyer have ever done a
complete heptathlon.
"They lx)th look great and they
both project to do very well (on
paper,]" Lananna said. "But it
doesn't always go like that. You al
ways have one event where some
thing doesn't go right."
