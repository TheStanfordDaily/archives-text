# All-American wrestlers leave the Farm winners

Jimmy Aguirre and Tod Sur
mon are, no matter who you ask,
leaders by example. The senior co
captains, who ended their Stan
ford wrestling careers on March
23 in Minneapolis at the NCAA
championships, will be greatly
missed by all their teammates
and Stanford wrestling fans.
To say that their records are
impressive would be a gross un
derstatement by any measure. As
a freshman wrestling in the 150-
pound weight class, Surmon went
13-11, had t wo pins, was third on
the team in point total and placed
fifth in the Pacific 10 Conference
championships, in which he
would eventually be a four-time
place-winner.
As a sophomore, he was second
on the team in point total, finish
ing with a record of 14-6. He
placed fourth in the 150-pound
weight class of the Pac-10 and
qualified for tho NCAA tourna
ment.
The next year, his record again
improved, as he finished the sea
son at 17-6. That year, he was sec
ond in the Pac-10 and again qual
ified for the NCAA tournament.
With five pins and 77.5 points,
Su rmon was second on the team's
point total list.
finally, this past year, Surmon
led the team with a remarkable
113.5 total points. He garnered
six pins, was a perfect 8-0 in dual
competition, and did not lose his
first match until the quarterfi
nals of the NCAA tournament,
finishing with a 25-2 record. His
23-0 record, prior to his loss, is a
Stanford record. He won titles in
the California Open, the AU-Cal
(California state championships),

and the Pac-10 tourney. When he
finally bowed out of the national
championships he had earned
seventh place. In addition, Sur
mon earned All-American hon
ors.
If you're not impressed, recall
that Surmon missed one third of
every season, a serious set-back to
any wrestler, yet he always re
turned prepared to claim victory.
"Tod is always willing to do what
ever he can to achieve his goals,"
said 17th-year head coach Chris
Horpel. "It really shows his deter
mination."
Perhaps more impressive is
the fact that Surmon compiled his
record in three different weight
classes (158,150,142). "Tod epit
omizes the utility athlete," Hor
pel said. "He was able to go wher
ever he was needed by the team."
Co-captain Aguirre had an im
pressive record at Stanford as
well. In his freshman year, he
went 16-6, leading the team in
point total, winning the Pac-10
championship and being honored
Outstanding Wrestler of the Pac
-10, quite a feat for an athlete, es
pecially a freshman. Aguirre's
sophomore season ended prema
turely when he ruptured a disc in
his neck. Despite the injury,
Aguirre went 19-11 in the 142-
pound class. In his junior year, as
team captain, Aguirre again wres
tled at 134 pounds, as he had done
freshman year. He finished the
season fourth on the team in
point total with a record of 15-4.
Aguirre qualified for the NCAA
tournament by placing fourth in
the Pac-10 tourney. Unfortunate
ly, due to nagging knee and neck
problems, he did not perform as
well as he would have liked.
This past season, again at 134
pounds, Aguirre ended up third on
the team in point total. He qualified
for nationals by placing third in the
Pac-10 tournament. At the NCAA
tourney, Aguirre was troubled by
neck troubles; despite this setback,
he received honorable mention Ail-
American honors, finishing ninth at
nationals. At season's end, he had
compiled a 21-9 record.
"Jimmy is a leader by example,"
Horpel said. "He is a good commu
nicator, and at times, acted as an as
sistant coach."
Teammates of Aguirre and Sur
mon poured similar compliments on

their leaders. "They are both very
disciplined guys," said Jason Glad
den. "They have great integrity,
they work harder than anybody I've
ever seen â€” that's a great part of
their success. Both have a tremen
dous work ethic."
Without a doubt, the example
which the two seniors set meant
more to their teammates than any
words they could have ever said.
Bryan Vaniman echoed his team
mates' remarks. "[Surmon and
Aguirre] are two strong, motivated
individuals. They motivate others
by their hard work," he said. "They
really set the tone for this team and
served as role models. They are two
very dedicated athletes who put in a
lot of work to get where they are.
"They truly love wrestling. Their
love for the sport kept them going."
