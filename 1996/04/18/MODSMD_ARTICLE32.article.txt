# Men's rugby to host Regional Finals
## 
### Neal Sweeney 
Following a convincing 45-0 vic
tory over Oregon State in a regional
preliminary game, the Stanford
men's rugby team now sets its
sights on the West USA Rugby Re
gional Championship and a berth in
the Final Four.
Saturday in Corvallis, Ore.,
Stanford faced the Beavers in a do
or die game to determine the final
participant in the West Regional.
The Cardinal started off strong,
scoring four tries in the first 20 min
utes, led by Joe Clayton, who scored
two tries and Bruce Kirsch, who
stepped in for the injured starting
scrum half. This quick start allowed
Stanford to rest its starters and
gave its backups key playing time
experience in anticipation of the Re
gional Finals, which consists of two
tough games in two days.
"We were able to get all we need
ed in the first half so we could rest
up and prepare for this weekend"
said senior captain Jeff Siemon.
This weekend the Cardinal will
host the Regional Finals at Maloney
Field, a competition which includes
the defending and 12-time national
champion University of California,
and former national champions Air
Force Academy and SDSU. The
schools are divided into two pools of
four teams each, with the winner of
each pool advancing to the Final
Four May 5-6 at the Air Force Acad
emy in Colorado Springs.
In Pool B, Stanford faces UCSB
in the semifinal game. Two weeks
ago, UCSB defeated a squad com
prised mostly of Stanford's second
team 24-11. UCSB features good
backs and an All-American wing,
but Stanford plans to rely on its
scrums and line-outs to power its
way down the field.
"Our loss gave us a preview of
UCSB and now we can focus on our
strengths of our forwards like we
tried to do against Oregon State"
Siemon said. Stanford hopes it can
build a lead like it was able to
against OSU to keep its starters
healthy and rested for the Regional
Final game.
If Stanford wins, the Cardinal

would most likely face UC-Davis,
which is favored over NE Missouri
State, in the semifinal round. The
Cardinal will look for revenge
against Davis, which defeated Stan
ford in 13-5 Jan. 27, in Stanford's
only intercollegiate loss this season.
Saturday's winners will meet Sun
day, with the Pool A final at 1 p.m.
followed by the Pool B final at 3 p.m.
"In the first game (the Aggies)
had much more intensity and out-

played us. There is definitely a big
revenge factor and we will have to
step it up. It will be a brawl" Siemon
said.
Unlike the muck of January
when the teams played in Davis,
Stanford will face Davis on its home
field with a partisan crowd and
looks to move to the next level with
a victory. A win over Davis would
give the Cardinal a berth in the
Final Four, where Stanford most

likely would face Cal, which is fa
vored to win Pool A.
This rematch of Big Game would
be an emotionally charged fight, but
the team is focusing on this week
end at the present time. With only
one national championship so far
under Stanford's belt, the Stanford
men's rugby team looks to take the
next step this weekend toward win
ning a national championship of its
own.
