# Islas' legacy remembered
## English prof to be inducted into AIDS Memorial Grove 
### Patrick Bernhardt 
Two dozen members of the Stanford communi
ty gathered in El Centro Chicano yesterday
evening to celebrate the life of Arfuro Islas, the
Stanford English profV >i and av. nd winning
novelist who died of AIDS related complicat ions in
1991.
Diane Middlebrook, English professor and ex
ecutor of Islas' literary estate, opened tin l event by
announcing that his third novel, "The King of
Tears," will be presented at the American Book As
sociation meeting in June. Although unfinished in
his lifetime, t he novel remained one of his favorite
projects.
"It is the other side of t he nice guy that he was,
liberated as a story of its own, Middlebrook said.
Islas, she recalled, would often play-act the per
sona of his alter ego to become the main character
of his final book.
Islas' two previous novels received nationwide
critical acclaim. "The Rain God" received the Bor
der Regional Library ('onference' 1983 award for
best fiction. His second work, "Migrant Souls," be
came the first Chicano-authored novel printed by a
New York publishing house.
The evening also focused on Islas' induction
into the Circle of Friends at the AIDS Memorial
Grove in Golden Gate Park.
When completed, the circle will contain the
names of about 2,200 victims of AIDS. Family and
friends can include a loved one's name by making a
$1,000 tax-deductible conti ihution to the project.

1 slas name was added to the circle by the Stanford
Department of English.
"The Circle of Friends will serve as a poignant
reminder not only of the toll that AIDS has taken,
hiit also of the courage, hope, love and community
it has inspired," said Kerry Enright, executive di
rector of the AIDS Memorial Grove. "The funds
raised through this and other sponsorship initia
tives will secure the grove as a permanent living
memorial where the losses of this terrible pandem
ic are never forgotten."
Legislation is pending before Congress to make
the San Francisco project the nation's AIDS
memorial.
"Most monuments are inanimate, stern and
cold," Enright said. "But out of the AIDS pandem
ic is emerging a new sort of monument, one that
helps heal the pain of loss."
Islas, his friends said, is not gone. Before his
death, he had been an almost constant fixture on
campus since his undergraduate matriculation in
1950. Islas first enrolled with an academic scholar
- hip as a pre medical student. But after becoming
dif satisfied with his grades in chemistry and biolo
gy, the future professor chose to pursue an educa
tion degree.
Islas joined the faculty in 1971 after receivinga
Stanford doctorate in English, the first Chicano in
the United States to attain that academic rank.
As they celebrated his life, Islas' friends pro
claimed that such a connection to the University
could not fade away. "lie is still very much alive,"
Middlebrook said, "in his work and in his name."
