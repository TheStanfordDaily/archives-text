## Seven lauded by Dean Shoven for being 'producers of scholarship' 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Seven extraordinary undergraduates got to
take a bow yesterday when they received the
Deans Award for Academic Achievement.
Seniors Rishi Dave, Chiyuma Elliott, Nicole
Krauss, Farhad Imam and Robert Yeh, sopho
more Sanjiv Harpavat and 1995 graduate Sarah
Horsely each received a certificate and a book se
lected by the professor who nominated him or
her for the award.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven said the recipients were "already far
along in the transition from consumers of schol
arship to producers of scholarship "
"You're doing at Stanford what we think
we're about," Shoven told the students.
This is the eighth set of undergraduates to re
ceive the award, which was started in 1988.
Nominations are solicited from professors, and
the deans of the three schools which give under
graduate degrees — Humanities and Sciences,
Earth Sciences and Engineering — choose com
mittees that make the final decision.
Horsely is a feminist studies major who com
pleted classes last year and recently finished an
honors thesis on the role of singing in the black
Civil Rights movement in the South.
" It came out of music being a really vital part
of African and African-American culture....

The singing was just as important as the preach
ing, the marches or the civil disobedience in keep
ing people's spirits up," she said.
Horsely now lives in San Francisco and works
for an organization in Oakland that works to
gain economic rights for poor women. She is also
an accomplished pianist.
Yeh is a human biology major and pro-medical
student who hopes to specialize in infectious dis
eases. He wrote a thesis on tuberculosis among
Mexican immigrants to determine what percent
age of sufferers were infected due to poor public
health conditions in the United States.
Yeh has done field research in Honduras and
will return to America to work after gradu
ation.
Assoc. Microbiology and Immunology Prof.
Robert Siegel, who nominated Yeh, said he was
"dazzlingly bright, the highest GPA I've ever
seen."
Harpavat is a sophomore biology major who
already works in the lab of Asst. Biology Prof.
Michael Simon. Simon said Harpavat's excel
lence had "humiliated" the upperclassmen with
whom he takes advanced science courses.
Simon said Harpavat "helped make the lab a
much more fun place to be" and noted that he
was the only one of the professors presenting
who would still have his recipient working with
him next year.
Elliott is an English major who wrote an hon-

ore thesis on roles of Chicana women. She also
co-authored a paper on black women abolition
ists with Asst. English Prof. Lora Romero.
Elliott was perhaps the most touched of the
recipients by the book she was given. Asst. Eng
lish Prof. Sharon Holland presented her with a
first edition of "The First Cities," the 112 rst book of
poems written by Audre Lorde, a contemporary
black woman poet.
The other English major to be honored was
Nicole Krauss, whose poetry has been published
both in this country and in Great Britain, where
she studied at Oxford University. She plans to re
turn to Oxford after graduation. She wrote an
honors thesis on the effect of radio on modernist
literature.
Dave, an economics and chemical engineering
double major, was nominated by Assoc. Econom
ics Prof. Frank Wolak, who praised his honors
thesis on the Indian software industry and his
"extremely ambitious leadership" of the Stan
ford Economics Journal. Dave's innovations as
editor, Wolak said, included publishing a review
of economics courses at Stanford.
Developmental Biology Prof. David Hogness
presented the award and an enormous Webster's
dictionary to Imam, a human biology major and
pre-medical student. Imam has done two years of
research on how the genes of fruit fly larvae are
affected by the hormone that triggers metamor
phosis.
