Prof. Milbrey McLaughlin might be sur
prised by what they see — the class in
progress could be run by not one but six
professors, none of whom are old enough
to vote.
As part of a new effort to make the sub
jects of her class, "Urban Youth and
Their Institutions," seem more real and
immediate to her Stanford students,
McLaughlin has begun recruiting San
Francisco school children to help "teach"
it. While she is not currently teaching the
class, McLaughlin said she anticipates
that it will continue next year. McLaugh
lin first offered the class fall quarter,
using students from San Francisco's
North Mission neighborhood.
"They were middle school kids —
everything from this little 4-foot-10-inch
kid to a young woman who was clearly on
her way to being a young woman," said
McLaughlin.
For McLaughlin, the decision to use
the North Mission students seemed obvi
ous. "How can you have a course on urban
youth and not have urban youth in it?"
she asked.
According to McLaughlin, the course is
built on the idea that many institutions,
such as family, school and community or
ganizations, affect how urban children
grow up. "The class looked at assump
tions about institutions that are central
to mainstream policy and contrasted that
with youth experience," McLaughlin
said.
McLaughlin asked the inner-city chil
dren to teach a segment of her class after

seeing a booklet documenting their work.
Last summer, the students had taken
part in a program through St. John's Ed
ucational Thresholds, a community
youth center. Their project consisted of
assessing existing resources in the North
Mission neighborhood and then lobbying
for the resources they found lacking, said
McLaughlin.
"Often neighborhoods are designed
and developed without regard to what
youth need," said McLaughlin. When the
North Mission children assessed their
neighborhood, she said, they found that
"there was no green space." Through the
children's efforts, "They have gotten the
city to build them a little park,"
McLaughlin said.
According to Betty Achinstein, a doc
toral student in the School of Education
and a teaching assistant for McLaugh
lin's class, the children's presentation in
cluded "a demonstration of the types of
change-oriented practices engaged by the
youth and then a modeling of the com
munity mapping for the Stanford stu
dents."
McLaughlin said the North Mission
students were struck by the differences
between their ideal community maps and
the Stanford students' maps. For the
North Mission youth, safety was the No.
1 concern, said McLaughlin. The Stan
ford students' maps were quite different.
"There was a lot of fast food," said
McLaughlin. "Stanford students wanted
a place to sit, a cafe. A lot of very different
concerns."
"Our class learned that some of the
things that were most important to youth
and their communities were spaces in

their neighborhoods where they could
congregate as communities and engage in
recreational activity, such as parks and
plaza areas," said senior Nicole Vazquez.
According to McLaughlin, student re
action to the North Mission children's
presentation was overwhelmingly posi
tive.
"They saw the youth as authentic.
They saw the youth as hopeful," said
McLaughlin. "The youth were articulate.
It gave the class an energy it wouldn't
have had without them."
Achinstein agreed, "These youth
demonstrated an expert understanding of
the benefits and shortcomings of their

community, as well as a vision for change.
. . . It reminded us of how articulate
youth can be and how visionary they are
about change."
"I thought the presentation brought
to life what we had been talking about
ourselves in class," said Paula Girouard,
a graduate student in education. "It was
evident that the youth were personally
connected to the material they were pre
senting. They had ownership of it."
As for the future, McLaughlin said she
plans to use the children again. "I can't
imagine teaching this course without
having them there, without having the
experts come in," she said.
