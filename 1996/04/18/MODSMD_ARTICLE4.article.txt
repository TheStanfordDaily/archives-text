### Jenna Land Contributing writer 
Nearly 1,000 high school seniors are expect
ed to arrive on campus today to take part in a
weekend of activities designed to introduce
them to Stanford â€” and convince them that
the Farm is the place to be.
Activities for Admit Weekend, which contin
ues through Sunday, include among other

things an open house at the Haas Center for
Public Service and late-night basketball at
Roble Gym.
Although the total number of students
scheduled to visit the University this weekend
is down by a few hundred from last year, hosts
and resident assistants are still enthusiastic
about the prospects for recruiting a new class
of freshmen.
Approximately 950 admits and 700 parents

will visit the Farm over the weekend, according
to coordinator Elise Maar. Last year 1,200 stu
dents participated.
Stanford students will host the prospective
freshmen, and various residences are planning
activities to entertain the visitors and show
them Stanford's Residential Education pro
gram.
Junior Molly Capron, a resi
dent assistant in Larkin House,
said dorm activities this weekend
will offer a glimpse of what fresh
men will experience next year.
"We're having a dorm program
to give pro fros a taste of what Res
Ed is like," she said.
According to Capron, a majori
ty of Larkin residents will be host
ing prospective freshmen.
"We have a lot of participation
within the dorm because Larkin
is all frosh and they remember
how much fun they had last
year," she said.
Other organized activities in
clude a "Fun in the Sun" lunch at
Canfield Courtyard in front of the
Law School, an official welcome
by Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions and Financial Aids
James Montoya in Memorial Au
ditorium and a panel of alumni
discussing life after Stanford in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. In addi
tion, academic advising tips, fi
nancial aid information and cam
pus tours will be available for the
benefit of the visitors.
Capron said she believes Admit
Weekend plays an important role
in the decision-making process of
high school seniors.
"Many (current) residents said
that Admit Weekend was a lot of
fun and a key factor in their deci
sion to choose Stanford," she said.
Students who decide to attend
Stanford must notify the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions by
Mav 1.
