### Jenna Land Contributing writer 
Nearly 1,000 high school seniors are expect
ed to arrive on campus today to take part in a
weekend of activities designed to introduce
them to Stanford â€” and convince them that
the Farm is the place to be.
Activities for Admit Weekend, which contin
ues through Sunday, include among other

things an open house at the Haas Center for
Public Service and late-night basketball at
Roble Gym.
Although the total number of students
scheduled to visit the University this weekend
is down by a few hundred from last year, hosts
and resident assistants are still enthusiastic
about the prospects for recruiting a new class
of freshmen.
Approximately 950 admits and 700 parents

will visit the Farm over the weekend, according
to coordinator Elise Maar. Last year 1,200 stu
dents participated.
Stanford students will host the prospective
freshmen, and various residences are planning
activities to entertain the visitors and show
them Stanford's Residential Education pro
gram.
