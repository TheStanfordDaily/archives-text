# Chekhov
## Would hide in shame 
### Gabriela Teodorescu 
A A aybe it was the script. But I doubt it.
IVI Unfortunately, the performance of
I Anton ( hekhov's " The Cherry Or
cnard" I saw on April 10 simply did not res
onate the way it should have. If I did not know
( hekhov at least somewhat or it I hadn't seen
great Chekhov done in Moscow, then I would
certainly have said the script was dated. That,
however, was not the case. The fact was that,
contrasting severely with some brilliant shows
given earlier this season, American (lonserva
tory Theater's presentation of Chekhov's last
play was just not up to par. It was partially the
acting and partially the directing, but mainly
the show just did not seem to emanate a feel
ing of relevance or intensity.
Historical Russia
The tale ('hekhov tells is certainly a histor
ical one, though this doesn't have to be dis
tancing when done right. The story is set on a
large Russian estate very late in the 19th cen
tury. The estate, which has been noticeably
unoccupied lor some time, belongs to I iubov
Kanyevskaya (played by (iordana Rashovich,
who looked every inch the aristocratic Russ
ian mistress). I he estate is also famous for its
cherry orchard, which is so large that, .is l.i
-übov's brother once brags, "That cherry or
chard is in the encyclopedia."
During her lengthy absence, the estate's
servants have kept the house in shape and in
the lust few moments of the play are very ob
viously preparing for her return. Yet her re
turn is not to be as joyous as one would ex
pect. The whole place is about to be [nit on the
auction block unless someone can find the

cash to pay the mortgage. Although aristo
cratic, I iubov has dissipated most of her
wealth on a disgraceful lover in Paris who left
her for another woman. In the meantime,
l.opakhin, the son of a former peasant, has
become a businessman and wishes to instruct
Ranyevskaya on how to keep her house.
I iubov's brother, Cayev (charmingly
played by Ken Ruta, with just the right
amount of bluster and loquaciousness) en
thusiastically greets his sister and her 17-year
old daughter, Anya (misdirectedly played by
an insipid and giggly Tina (ones) in the nurs
ery. This room, with an oversi/ed rocking
horse and huge bookcase, which tellingly was
once I iubov and Ciayev's nursery, serves as
the set for the first act (set by Kate Kdmunds).
The bookcase serves as the object of one of the
funniest speeches in an otherwise bland play:
(iayev offers an absurdly eloquent ode to the
bookcase, remarking that it has now turned
100 years old.
Human foible
This speech serves as a paradigm for the
tragic flaw of all the characters: the fact that
no matter what they do or what they are told,
they cannot break out of their elemental help
lessness. (iayev can't help but be incapable of
anything but talk; I iubov simply must have
her lover; and I opakhin must keep working
from day to night.
Amid all of the philosophical subtext is the
continual sexual tension floating in theair be
tween many of the characters: Varya
(Michelle Morain), who has run the house
hold in I.iubov's absence and is the only one

who works as much as Lopakhin does, loves
the workaholic; while he loves Liubov; Anya is
wooed by the overaged, socialist grad student,
Trofimov (Jack Wehterall); Yepikhodov, the
accountant overly prone to disaster, loves the
foolish maid Dunyasha (Adria Woomer-
Stewart); and she talis ridiculously for the se
lectively obsequious valet Yasha (wonderfully
played by Daniel Cantor). The overabun
dance of love triangles adds some spice to the
story, not to mention hilarity. Yet, the excess
of unrequited love also underscores the futil
ity of human action.
Lopakhin is the only one who has his feet
011 the ground and is able to take action to
ward some goal. He remembers how his
grandparents and father worked the land as
miserable serfs, and in a way he feels obligat
ed to vindicate that former position, even
though his lather was a drunk who beat him.
In one of the most moving speeches,
Lopakhin says: "1 get up at five and work from
morning to night, and you know, my business
involves a lot of money, my own and other
people's, so I see lots of people, see what
they're like. And you just try to get something
accomplished, you'll see how few decent,
honest people there really are. Sometimes at
night I can't sleep and I think, Dear God, you
gave us this beautiful earth to live on, these
great forests, these broad horizons, by rights
we should be giants."
Inevitable failures
Despite Lopakhin's suggestion that
Ranyevskaya should cut down the cherry or
chard and sell the plots in pieces as vacation

homes, Liubov and her brother seem too dis
tant to realize the severity of their situation
To them, having been aristocrats all theii
lives, they seem to believe something wil
come up — or maybe they don't even think
that far. Even their ancient butler Firs (playei
extremely well by Gerald Hiken), hard 01
hearing and unable to grasp modern society
sometimes seems more insightful than they.
As it becomes clear that the estate will bt
lost, on the day of the auction Liubov throw*
a party (with another wonderful set for the
second act), seemingly trying to fling hei
cares away through alcohol and dance. But
invariably she is obsessed with the sale of tht
house and wonders if Gayev lias somehow
found a way to save the beloved cherry or
chard at the last moment.
But he hasn't. And in the last scene, a>
everyone packs up and leaves, Chekhov's bril
liance does manage to come through. Ik
shows how sometimes, despite trauma and
seemingly unendurable hardship, not learn
ingyour lesson might do more to allow you tc
move on. In this case, Liubov is ready to re
turn to Paris, where her lover awaits, and
Anya leaves with Trofimov, hoping to start .1
new life. The less astute characters take lite
more in stride.
While the lesson learned from the cherry
orchard is meaningful, the play still seemed
misdirected by Barbara Damashek. The ac
tors laughed a little too often after their lines,
and the audience near the end just didn't
seem to care that the estate would be sold.
Something, unfortunately, must have gotten
lost in the translation.
