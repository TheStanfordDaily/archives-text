# So sit right back and enjoy a tale...
## The
						Stanford Chamber Chorale's Broadway Cafe 
### Akin Salawu 
\\ 1 m I even in that scene?" Screams one ac-
II tress as she drags a train of chairs away
II from the stage in Ricker Dining Hall.
"Are any of you guys in Le Jazz Hott?"
Screams another performer on the costume
crew as she approaches a trio of young men
seated around a table.
"Please don't make me scream!" Screams
the director as her actors scurry to their places.
These are the sounds ot the Stanford Cham
ber Chorale's Spring Broadway Cate Monday
night dress rehearsal. The Stanford Chamber
Chorale is a group of 22 students ranging from
freshmen to third-year doctoral students who
usually perform classical chamber music.
Broadway Cafe opens in three days. Everyone
is in a frenzy of excitement, energy and pas
sion.
At first glance everything seems very loose
— although it is the group's first opportunity
to perform in Ricker. Then the run through
starts, the adrenaline kicks in and the magic
materializes.
The Chorale's Fourth Broadway Cafe: Ad
ventures on Chorale Reef, opens I hursday,
April 18 at 8:30 p.m. in Ricker Dining Hall. The
show is a musical review containing a slew of
Broadway favorites which challenges the
Chorale's flexibility.
"The vast majority ot what we do is classical
music," said co-producer Kathleen Gregory,
"this was a style we really weren't familiar

with."
B u t
one taste of

Chorale member
Luke Powery's sul
try rich baritone
voice breathing

life into "Le Jazz
Hott" from Vic
tor /
and it becomes

clear that they are well
equipped to mount
this show.
"At the auditions
we were rea Ily astou nd -
ed at how versatile peo
ple were," Gregory
added, "We knew we
had a lot of classically
trained singers, but we
didn't realize the spec
trum of talent."
This spectrum not
only encompasses
singing, hut acting,
dancing and even writ-

p
ing.
"Everything has been done completely
within the group," said co-producer Akiko Fu
jimoto, "we wrote it, we sing, we act, we dance,
we produce it and publicize it. Everything!"
Co-director, co-writer Michelle Geoffrion-
Vinci has been in the Chorale for three years
and lists with ease the differences between this
year's Cafe and past Cafes.
"The songs — we have an entirely new se
ries of show tunes. Every year what makes the
show is the folks in the company and this year
we are fortunate to have a tremendous ensem
ble. And we have several ensemble numbers
with intricate choreography, thanks to Chris
Nichols."
The impact the choreography has had on the
energy of the show is especially evident
when a good half of the Chorale moves to
"Anything Goes" with the energy of a typhoon.
Typhoon is a particularly appropriate
metaphor for the energy of the show since it is
a spoofon (iilligan's Island.
"We had such enormous success with a
spoof on a well known comedy last year (The
Love Boat), that we've decided to do it again."
Geoffrion-Vinci said.
Geoffrion-Vinci and co-director, co-writer
Mark Tendall play the Howells and infuse the
show with a strong dose of sentimentality nec
essary to any musical review with their rendi
tion of "I Remember It Well" from Gigi.

But ot
c ourse,
the show stealer promises to be the
evil villainess, (linger - played by
Koeun Rha. Her wicked, cackled
and divine performance of "Dia
monds Are a Girl's Host friend"
from Gentlemen Prefer blondes
should remind us of all those
times we wished (linger would just
<ill Mary Anne and Mrs. Ilowcll oil

and jump Mr. I fowell's bones in his hut.
The company cheers as Rha's Ginger sets
her devilish plot in motion and an almost
corny warmth (ills Ricker as the company .ill
realize they've got a show.
This energy seems to be a result of the
group's spring break tour through Washington
State. The tour is part of why Cafe happens in
the first place.
"Cafe is sort ol a retroactive, fund-raiser to
pay for the tour we just took, explained (Jeof
frion-Vinci. "And because of it the group is re
ally tight. In lots of ways, we're definitely
tighter musically than we've been in years."
" This group is the easiest to get along with
ever," chimed Melissa Abola, who controls the
stage with the energy of a raging hull.
Ginger kicks back off stage while Chris late
and pianist Ryo Sohohara work a particular
moment over and over until it's just right. The
Chorale is determined to outshine last year's
show and dazzle yet another audience.
"Its exciting to be dealing with these other
elements," remarked I ujimoto. "Our focus is the
singing — but that's been our smallest concern

because singing comes more natural to us than
acting or dancing."
The company is enjoying conquering the
challenges this production presents.
"This is the most fun we have all year," said
Liura Chummers, who's solo, "As Long as He

Needs Me," from Oliver promises to yank at
i your heartstrings.

The show was written and cast last
quarter hut they've only had 2 1/2 weeks
to get the show together.

"I think its going well," nod
ded Abola. 'Tor ('ale where we have
1 to do it overnight its definitely going
I well. This year everything's been
going smoothly."

Ireshman Martin Reyes, who is juggling
three productions this quarter, is pleased with
how things are progressing. "One thing that's
really cool is that everybody here is extremely
talented."
And the group can't wait to showcase their
talent this weekend. Kvervone hopes this
show is as well attended as the previous
Cafes.
"l-.ven with our normal shows, I feel like the
level that we sing— the type of stuff we sing
doesn't get .1 big audience," said Abola.
"But," added ("hummers, "Broadway Cafe
always gets a big audience and so for one glim
merweget .til this glory and fame."
I he Broadway Cafe is a bit of a novelty on
Stanford campus, particularly this year.
"Well, Rams I lead usually does .1 big spring
musical," said C ieoffrion-Vinci, "but unfortu
nately this year they are unable to, so except for
dorm shows... we're it."
They're right here on campus, and it's half
as long as a three-hour tour. You can't go
wrong.
