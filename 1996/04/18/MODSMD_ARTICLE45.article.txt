Indie film festivals are to the mid-'9os
what colonic camps and new age spas
were to the late-'8()s: the perfect Cali
fornia getaway. Who cares that they're not all
in California? Sundance is but a hop, skip and
a jump, a resort owned by a Hollywood Gold
en Boy, and Cannes is so LA. people can be
heard exclaiming, "Wow, am I home? Where's
Spago?"
The San Francisco International Film fes
tival tries to be different. It is the oldest show
case for independent and feature films in the
Western Hemisphere. It screens real indepen
dent films, and lots of them. In the 39 years
since its inception, the film festival has
launched directors, directed a second (or
third) glance .it already established filmmak
ers and recognized lifetime achievements.
If you're on the indie film circuit, you may
recognize such titles as "Ulysses' (laze," "Dead
Man" or "Welcome to the Dollhouse." II
you're not, you'll still have heard of "A Close
Shave" (an Oscar-winning Nick Park classic).
You may even be introduced to some new
films.
Flipping through the festival's program,
the films look like a bad game of Risk, where
countries are jumbled together to form suspi
cious alliances. What must a film such
lestial Clockwork" from Venezuela, France,
Belgium and Spain look like? What language
do they speak in "Cod's Comedy" (a joint
Portugal-France-Italy-1 )enmark creation)?
Can you even imagine "Ciuimba â€” a Tyrant
and his Time" from Mali/Burkina I a so, or the
haunting "The Time of Yellow Crass" from
Tajikistan?
The festival claims to have something for
everyone, screening 168 films from 46 coun
tries, including four international premieres.

Some will go on to be released in American
theaters, some will die in the bowels of a ware
house, but the festival is not concerned with
the future. For two brief weeks, April 18- May
5, 1996, all films are projected onto the same
screen, all held in similar regard.
But some, of course, will stand out. Asia is
particularly well-represented this year, with a
new crime drama, "Kamikaze Taxi", from di
rector Masato Harada and prize winner Hi
rokazu Kore-eda's "Maborosi." Arab films
also take center stage with "Bye Bye" from di
rector Karim Dridi, and "Douce France"

A commitment to showing great film, a
venue for Boy-Area filmmaking and a
confidence in young directors is what
sets the San Francisco International Film
Festival apart from others of its ilk.

which treats Arab immigration to Irancewith
surprising comedic wit. Films by women, in
cluding " The World of Jacques Demy" by
Agnes Varda and "Cutting Loose" show
promise.
European and American films are promi
nent as well. "One I kindred and One Nights"
from Agnes Varda contains cameos by Jean-
Paul Belmundo, Jeanne Moreau, Alain Delon,
Catherine Deneuve, that King o' French film
Cierard Depardieu, Robert DeNiro, Harrison
lord and Marcello Mastroianni. "Ordinary
Ilero'chronicles the events surrounding
Italy's recent banking scandal. "Walking and
Talking" explores 20-something life in New
York and showcases young actress Anne
Heche, whose portrayals won her a nod at

Sundance last month.
Beyond the major films the festival tries to
recognize smaller efforts with its categorical
prizes. The Golden Gate Awards honor inno
vation in short, documentary and television
production. Past winners have included
"Hoop Dreams" and "A Close Shave." A new
category celebrates cinema produced by high
school film -and-video makers.
Other awards include a special Akira Kuro
sawa Lifetime Achievement Award to Arthur
Penn, director of such classics as "Bonnie and
Clyde" (1967) and "Little Big Man" (1970).

Harvey Keitel will be on hand to receive his
IVtcr |. Owens Award. He promises to be
clothed.
The festival will open with a string of
comedies. "Cold Comfort Farm," "Dream for
an Insomniac," "The Monster" and
"Palookaville" will sot the ball rolling tonight,
with a gala event following. Closing the festi
val is the premiere of Josephine Baker's first
film "The Siren of the Tropics," rarely
screened and newly restored. I ler son Jean-
Claude Baker will introduce the film, which
will be accompanied by live jazz.
But just when you think movies are about
couch potato entertainment, the festival pro
vides a venue for audience-feedback. The
Starbucks Audience Awards encourages

movie-goers to stuff the ballot box for their fa
vorite film of the festival. Past winners have
gone on to gross millions in ticket sales, as "11
Postino" and "Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"
were counted as audience favorites.
Festival films are screened in the monolith
ic Kabuki 8 Theatres, as well as the Pacific
Film Archive in Berkeley. The Castro Theatre
plays host to archival presentations and the
closing night gala. The opportunity to view its
old-world 1920s movie palace decor should
not be missed. Screenings will also be held at
the Lark Theatre in Larkspur, a festival first.
The San Francisco International Film Fes
tival is in transition. Having lost its founder,
Irving Levin, who died last year, and gearing
up for its 40th anniversary next year, the festi
val is riding strong on its reputation and look
ing ahead to determine its place in a Western
world littered with such events.
What the festival attempts to do, and suc
ceeds brilliantly in doing, is keeping its focus
on the films and bringing the films to the pub
lic. There is no wheeling and dealing (most of
the films already have distribution agree
ments) and events are relatively cheap and
open to the public (compare with Cannes'
penitentiary-strict entrance requirements). A
commitment to showing great film, a venue
for Bay-Area filmmaking and a confidence in
young directors is what sets the San Francisco
International Film Festival apart from others
of its ilk. It rises head and shoulders above the
rest, and is a lot more fun than a colonic.
