### 
//n ead Man" recounts the slow, painful and excruciating
U death of William Blake. Watching it, in no small part
due to Johnny Depp's inferior acting abilities, is like dying a
slow, painful and excruciating death.
Spaced-out director lim Jarmusch has asked us to swallow
a mouthful this time. William Blake, recently orphaned, trav
els west in the mid-19th century to claim his job as an ac
countant. He arrives to find the job's been filled and ends up
in the middle of a lover's quarrel that ends in death. Blake be
comes a nomadic outlaw and meets up with Nobody (Gary
Farmer) who nurses him with Native American platitudes a

la Tonto until Depp's character finally...
This film is so boring, that 1 looked at my watch four times
during the 2 hours and 14 minutes it ran. Filmed in black and
white so that "even the colors won't be familiar," the opening
sequences are a series of fades in and out of Johnny Depp
being bored on the train. Hey! I'm bored too.
Farmer plays into all the stereotypes of the Native Ameri
can as the noble savage, who knows all, speaks in tongues and
takes peyote. Oh yeah, he also quotes William Blake.
Neil Young's heavy guitar music is used as a ruse to create
suspense in a film which utterly lacks it. He claims he watched
the movie on monitors in the studio and played straight
through the film, improvising as he went along. 1 wish I had

had something to play with during the screening.
Depp tries to escape the father of the killed daughter and
his hired guns through the American West. As the bodies pile
up, the surrealism mounts. Johnny Depp as a Natural Born
Killer? What is this film about anyway? The only possible
depth is achieved when the film is seen as an allegory to the
journey to the afterlife, a suggestion which Jarmusch shrugs
off. The closest the film gets to a philosophy is summed up by
Johnny Depp, "the only certainty we have in life is that we're
going to croak." Deep.
Jarmusch quotes Blake as saying that death is merely get
ting up and going into a different room. I just know that I was
dying to get out of there.
