# Ulysses' Gaze

### 
// T° Vlemma Tou Odyssea" better known in
I English as "Ulysses' Gaze" is epic. Epic in the
captivating and overly long sense of the word. A film
about a cinematographer who returns to his native
Greece, it lasts upwards of three hours.
However, it is extremely interesting, and with
some sharp scissors could be a great film.
Harvey Keitel plays an immigrant to America re
turning to his native Greece to disspell some of the
controversy over his latest film. But this is not his
true motive. He is looking for the three undeveloped
reels of the pioneer filmmakers known as the Man
akis brothers, lost in the series of Balkan wars. The
brothers documented an earlier Greece, and Keitel's
journey takes him back into the deepest Balkan
states, including war-torn Sarajevo.
Yes, he's naked very often in the movie.
Keitel takes on various roles in the movie as it as
sumes a dream-like quality. He is alternately the
Manakis brother sentenced to death for treason;
himself as a boy as well as the dead husband of a
grief-torn woman. He travels by canoe, taxi, freight
boat (along a Statue-of-Liberty-sized statue of Stal
in) and meets and makes friends with many along
the way.
Most notably he meets (and sleeps with) the same
woman three times in different incarnations. Here
director Theo Angelopoulous lost me. Is this a sym
bol for Keitel rediscovering his roots?
The otherwise captivating film was encumbered
by endless landscape shots where we watch a boat
drift for 15 minutes. Hopefully, a shortened version
will appear in the U.S. theaters. II not, rent it and
keep the remote handy to fast forward. It's worth it
just to see Harvey speak in Balkan.
