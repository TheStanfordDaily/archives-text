## BUTTERGLORY Are you building a temple in heaven? 
### 
hollowing a slew of great singles and a
solid (if slightly derivative) debut album, this
Visalia, Calif., duo has just recently devel
oped into a full band. For a few years now,
Matt Suggs and I )ebby Vander Wall have cre
ated awkwardly pleasing guitar-pop shuffles,
where their rookie wit compensated lor their
lack of instrumental complexity. But with a
bunch of new musician helpers, Butterglory
have taken a huge leap forward and released
one of the liveliest pop records of the year.
"Are you building a temple in heaven?"
marks the beginning of a new era for Butter
glory, and it's clear from the very start. "She
Clicks the Sticks" has all the jittery charm of
1994's "Crumble," except that the guitars
soar rather than stutter, and the feel is one of
confidence rather than edginess. The new
batch of songs showcases saxophone, electric
piano, clarinet, cello and more, but never at
the expense of the essentials: Even in the
lushest tracks, Suggs and Vander Wall's
melodic modesty is at the core of it all.
"You'll Never Be (As Cood As That),"
"She's Cot the Akshun!" and "Edward
Brown" are as catchy as anything you'll hear
all year, while "When I ler Brow (lurls," " The
Captain Stood Sturdy" and"The Halo Over
Your Head" provide the pretty, restful mo
ments such great pop tracks demand. But
"Sit in the Car" stands as the best thing But
terglory have done, a perfect piece of guitar
bounce where Vander Wall's vocals power
through meaty rifts and rhythms reminis
cent of l.iz Phair's "Supernova."
While Butterglory's early work echoed in
fluences like Pavement and the Vaselines,
"Are you building a temple in heaven?" shows
a sound that's completely unique — one that
makes their hooky indie stuff every bit as
great as it's always been fun.
