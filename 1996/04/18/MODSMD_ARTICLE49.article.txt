# VARIOUS ARTISTS
## Songs in the key of X 
### 
The true worth of compilations is a very
debatable issue.

Since the early '60s, the essential musical
statement for rock and roll has become the
full length album. Thus, compilations suffer
greatly from their lack of cohesion resulting
from too many artists, too many genres and
too many themes. Only rarely will a compila
tion be an endurable, listenablc album.
("The Harder They Come" soundtrack, tor
example, is a notable exception, serving as an
excellent introduction into the reggae
world.)
On the other hand, compilations are also
great ways for relatively unknown groups to
get their music to a wide audience. Riding on
the backs of more famous artists, these bands
might just get their chance at fame by up
staging the other artists.
"Songs In The Key Of X" is an excellent
example of such a situation. A "soundtrack"
for the hit TV series "The X-Files," the album
is a collection of "music inspired by the show
as inspiration tor the show." In general, the
well-known artists disappoint and, the more
obscure groups provide the album's most in
teresting moments.
Sheryl Crow, Foo Fighters and Elvis
Costello all contribute disappointing tracks,
remarkable only for their mediocrity. Danzig
does offer some very surprising rhythmic
complexity on the track "Deep," but unfortu
nately, Clenn Danzig, the group's lead singer,
has nowhere near the vocal strength he needs
to fulfill the song's potential.
On the other hand, more obscure artists,
such as Soul Coughing, Frank Black and
Meat Puppets contribute some very interest
ing material.
Rob Zombie and Alice ("ooper provide the
bruising, but powerful, "Hands Of Death
(Burn Baby Burn)," a triumphant synthesis
of heavy metal and techno-rock.
I lowever, the album's greatest moment is
provided by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds
with "Red Right Hand." Indeed, the track is
enough to make the album worth the price. A
melodramatic masterpiece, the song creates
an apocalyptic atmosphere capable of inspir
ing actual fear. Itchy guitar, cryptic vocals
and a punishing bass drum build upon each
other to create one of popular music's great
est embodiments of paranoia.
Unfortunately, this visionary track over
shadows the rest of the album, which makes
its true worth questionable. Perhaps pur
chasing something by Nick Cave and the Bad
Seeds with "Red Right Hand" would be the
best idea.
