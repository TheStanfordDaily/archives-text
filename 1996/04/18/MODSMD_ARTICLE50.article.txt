# PENELOPE HOUSTON
## Cut You 
### 
A long time ago, way back
in 1978, there was a punk band
called the Avengers, and the lead
singer was Penelope Houston.
Today Houston is making music
with her own band, but when you
hear her new music you'll have to
fight the urge to compare the pho
tos on the new CD against those on
the Avengers albums — yes, it's her
... I think.
You have to understand my

skepticism. "Cut You," with its country-folk
sound, mandolins and steel guitar, has "adult
contemporary" written all over it. The
Avengers, on the other hand, were all about
youth and rebellion. They were among the
first punks, and they played youth anthems
with titles like "Fuck You." When listening to
this new album, try imagining Houston
shouting before a song, "This one you all
know, it's called 'Fuck You!' " Impossible.
Apparently, 1 louston has "grown as a mu
sician," but she seems to have left behind
every facet of the music of her youth, to the
point where she seems hardly the same per
son. 1 ler name, however, will forever identify
her as a monument of early punk, someone
who helped shape the genre in a time before
punk was a guys-only pit of moshing and
spitting.
On the cover of "Cut You," Houston ap
pears holding a switchblade knife and flash
ing a mischievous smile. Have no fear,
though: this album will not harm you. In
fact, anyone hardened enough to enjoy punk
music a la the Avengers will find that this
album bounces right off of them and falls
harmlessly to the floor.
"Cut You" is the perfect album for closet
fans of bittersweet, acoustic, country-folk
music. Houston's name brings with it a sub
versive, punk aura which will satisfy those lis
teners who want to think of themselves as
young, hip and a tad underground. But the
music is better suited to those people who
harbor a secret affinity for singers like Shawn
Colvin.
In this sense, Houston's new music is per
fect crossover fare. For 20-something music
listeners it provides a bridge between adoles
cent angst and middle-aged complacency.
They can go out and buy this album without
feeling like they are betraying the beliefs of
their youth, but while listening to it they can
prepare for the comfort-music of their adult
hood. Old punks never die (well, sometimes
they OD on heroin), they just start listening
to Enya.
