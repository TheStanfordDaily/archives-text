# MARTHA ARGERICH
## Debut Recital 
### 
Three decades after its initial detonation,
this DG reissue remains a bombshell. One
can't help but marvel at such colossal virtu
osity and intense musicality all fused in an
Argentinean girl then barely 19. It was a per
fect blast that set the stage for Martha Arg
erich, one of today's reigning keyboard ti
tans.
The repertoire chosen consists of mostly
miniature gems by Chopin, Brahms, I.iszt,
Ravel and Prokofiev, coupled with Liszt's
monumental "Sonata in B minor." Arg
erich's playing is instinctively mercurial,
volatile yet exquisitely sensitive. Flanked by
mammoth technique, she projects a mo
mentum utterly beyond description and
one is often left vertiginous and out of
breath, constantly riding on unexpected


twists and monumental climaxes.
A veteran Chopin interpreter, Argerich
probes the poetic and demonic sides of the
"Scherzo N0.3" with remarkable aplomb.
The coda seethes with a daredevil abandon
almost on the verge of collapse. While no less
passionate, her Brahms "Rhapsodies" are ap
propriately somber and brood with an id
iomatically Germanic heaviness. The
Prokofiev Toccata, tossed off as if a mere
child's play, is a tour de force propelled by a
relentless drive, a performance which al
legedly elicited a laudatory letter from no less
than Vladimir Horowitz himself.
Argerich's rich palette of tonal shadings
finds an ideal match in Ravel's "Jeux d'eau," a
sheer delight with a dazzling array of nuances
and colors utterly suggestive of the trans
parency and fluidity of a waterfall. To top it
off, she zips through the Liszt "Hungarian
Rhapsody" with blinding bravura and elan.
The engulfing intensity she generates in the
octave coda is a phenomenon in a class by it
sell. Indeed, these short masterpieces serve
her well in showcasing her formidable com
mand in all aspects, whether musical or tech
nical.
She fares no less brilliantly in the Liszt
"Sonata," in which Argerich scales an
Olympian height. The sheer largess of her
conception easily puts her in the same league
with Horowitz, Richter and Gilels. There is
not a single cold moment in this piece lasting
2(i minutes. Every note and every phrase is
imbued with a strong intent and a firm con
viction. While her overzealous stamina at
times threatens to melt the contour of the
musical architecture, her forceful rhetoric
leaves no room for ambiguity. She unbash
fully lays out everything under the sun, re
vealing all the nooks and crannies of the in
tricate "Sonata." Yet one sometimes wishes
she could take time to relish the quieter mo
ments of the piece and explore the mysteri
ous, Faustian side of the "Sonata." Still, this
heaven-storming rendition will leave no one
unstirred, for better or worse.
This recording, however, is not for every
body. Puritans will surely have their share of
diatribes while the academics will decry her
lack of "discipline." Hut if you are looking for

a starkly original and a tlesh-and-blood vivid
playing of these well-trodden war-horses,
Argerich will definitely do more than whet
your appetite.
