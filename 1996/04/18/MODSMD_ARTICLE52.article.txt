## VARIOUS ARTISTS Go BIG. 
### 
What do you get when you cross punk
rock, rap, thrash, funk, snowboarding, skate
boarding and magazines? You get "Go BIG."
This unique ( 1) combines some of better up
and-coming punk groups with 23 minutes ot
CD-ROM video footage ot snowboarding
and skateboarding.
The first thing that's different about this
CI) is its CD-ROM portion. It can run on ei
ther a P( or a Mac, and provides the user
with a chance to watch video footage of
snowboarders on a half pipe or skateboarders
"eating shit' while the songs on the CD play
in the background. It also has information on
how to subscribe to such skateboarding mag
azines as Thrasher. Front End Loader, 311
and Sublime also have their own section on
the CD-ROM featuring concert and inter
view footage.
However, that part of the CD is merely
novelty. You might look through it once or
twice, but what really matters on an audio
CD is whether the music can hold its own.
Overall, the music on this CD accomplishes
this challenge.
The audio portion opens with a short,
punk-rock song from Sublime. It is probably
the most traditional sounding song on the
album, and brings to mind a bunch of young
skateboarders hanging around a garage
watching their friends play. From there the
album branches out into less traditional
sounds.
The best discovery for me on the album
was M.l.R.V.'s "Shave My Face." Overlaying
the slow, repeating guitar-and-bass riff, the
heavily-echoed vocals come in short, choppy
bursts throughout the song, it's not as up
beat as most of the songs are, but its unique

sound brings it to the forefront on this
albu m.
Also worth notice is 311. Imagine a sound
like Rage Against the Machine, except replace
the anger with funk and positive energy, and
you have 311. Their song "Nutsymtom" fea
tures an excellent groove and a great guitar
solo.
Of course, it would be a shame to end this
review without mentioning Sausage, Les
Claypool's recently reunited pre-Primus
band. As wacky as always, Claypool's bass
riffs on "Riddles Are Abound Tonight" will
simply blow your mind, and the guitar and
drum parts are equally as impressive.
Other artists on the CI) worth mentioning
are Shelter, Front End Loader and Food
Stamp. Even though many of the songs might
not be considered excellent on their own,
combined they provide a good album and
good introduction to the skate / snowboard
ing culture.
