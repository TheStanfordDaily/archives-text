# VARIOUS ARTISTS
## Home Alive: The Art of Self Defense 
### 
Featuring a lineup of Seattle based (i.e.
"alternative") rockers and spoken word
artists that ranges from the likes of Pearl
Jam and Soundgarden to the essentially un
known Catfood, "Home Alive: the Art ol
Self I )efense" is a double disc benefit album
for anti-violence (particularly violence
against women) inspired by the murder of
the Git's lead singer, Mia Zapata. It is a
noble cause that is unfortunately under
mined by the superficial treatment it gets
throughout the bulk of Home Alive's 45 (!)
songs and spoken word pieces, as well as in
the CD's annoyingly gung-ho artwork. Disc
two, for example, features a picture of four
women, each dressed to convey a frustrat
ingly stereotypical image (the freak, the

flower child, the intellectual, the rock
babe), circled by the slogan "which one de
serves it?"
Then there's the spoken word pieces, of
which Jim Carroll's "Nightclubbing" stands
out simply because the rest are so unbeliev
ably awful. Particularly heinous is Lydia
Lunch's "Why We Murder." "Time ... stops
.. . dead," she melodramatically chirps dur
ing a break between bouts of unintentional
ly hilarious rage. Even worse are the efforts
by men, whose vitriol seems a tad too re
hearsed, too eager to be "down" with the
cause. All of the spoken word pieces are
marked by an affection for the M f" word that
would make one think the artists (1 use the
term loosely, here) were in first grade and
their older brothers had just taught them
how to swear.
Home Alive's musical selections, most of
which explicitly address the issue of violence
against women, do little to win listeners
over. The number of musical artists who
have been able to successfully incorporate
overt political messages into their work can
be counted on one hand. None of them are
found on this album.
The songs that are successful, then, are
those that have nothing to do with the issue
that fuels I lome Alive. The l ; ast back's "Time
and Matter" puts a Journey-esque guitar riff
to infectious use, while Soundgarden's "Kyle
Petty (Son of Richard)," with its revving en
gine sounds and tinny, exasperated vocals,
seethes with the only legitimate sounding
rage on the album.
Beyond that, too much of Home Alive's
music is, well, boring. There's that Pearl Jam
song, a regular doo-wop ditty about being
nice to women, and the buzz-bin fuzz of The
President's of the United States of America's
"Confusion," both fair enough tracks, but
neither of which inspire repeated listenings.
The length, repetition and look-at-me-
I'm-pissed tone of Home Alive are more
than enough to drive anyone mad. Cood in
tentions alone don't make good albums, and
Home Alive is a real stinker.
