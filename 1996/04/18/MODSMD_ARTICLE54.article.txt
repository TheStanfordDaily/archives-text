## Fear 
### 
Sometimes fear is the catalyst tor desper
ate behavior. [.specially if it's the fear of losing
the one you love.
In December, during an interview, Direc
tor James Foley ("Glengarry (ilen Ross") had
told me about Mark Wahlberg's (formerly
Marky Mark) character in his new film,
"I ear."
"Mark does nothing unnatural,'' Foley
said. "I le simply has no conscience.
Wahlberg stops at nothing to be with
Reese Witherspoon's Nicole, the vestal virgin

who is the object of a tug-of-war between his
David and Nicole's father (William Pe
tersen). It's Wahlberg's intensity matched
with Petersen's paternal instincts that make
the film a worthwhile 97 minutes to sit
through.
Wahlberg comes across as a guardian with
an agenda: an overriding drive to be with
Nicole and to knock down any obstacles that
try to keep them apart. I lis sinister underside
is skillfully conveyed in scenes that exemplify
his innocent facade and illuminate what
lurks underneath, lie's very convincing as a
sociopath.
"Mark is a revelation," Foley said. I saw it
for myself. Marky Mark can act. lie tioes

from Mr. Too Ciood To Ik' True, polite and
helpful boyfriend, to possessed lunatic in the
next frame. In his eyes is the menace ot .1
killer. Wahlbergs obvious physical bulk is
also intimidating,although several women in
the audience had problems restraining their
gasps when he unveiled his formidable pecs.
Petersen delivers a stellar performance as .1
father threatened by his daughter's emerging
sexuality and doing what he can to keep the
lovers apart.
No longer I )addv"s girl, Witherspoon goes
out of her way to be with Wahlberg, excited to
come out into the big bad world. In this
world, her I )avid is her ultimate protector.
I ike ,1 deer 111 headliehts, Witherspoon

comes onto this scene with total innocence.
Going into a club, her eyes are wide, smiling
and staring at pierced bodies, gay couples
and grunge galore. Having lived a sheltered
life, her naivete makes her susceptible to
David's plays. Soon David reveals his lethal
side, 112 rom here on out it becomes a suspense
thriller with the predictable explosion of vio
lence in the end.
Until then, very little is gratuitous. We ride
along on the deftly treaded path Foley has
created. He shows us how real fear can be,
and what people are willing to do when faced
with losing everything.
