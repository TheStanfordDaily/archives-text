# James and the Giant Peach
## 
### 
This movie is about lames (Paul
Terry)... and a giant peach.
The movie based on Roald
I )ahl'sclassic children'sstor\ centers
around James, a boy who lives a Utopi
an life near a beach with his mother and
father. I hey are planning a fantastic
voyage to New York C 'ity to see "the
tallest building in the world. I his all
ends, of course, when his parents are
eaten by a giant rhinoceros, lames is
forced to go and live with two relatives.
Aunt Spiker (Joanna I.umley) and
Aunt Sponge (Miriam Margoyles). In
his new home, James is treated like a
servant, beaten and humiliated.
This is where the magic begins. A
mysterious old man (Pete Post let h
waite) gives James a bag full of magical
crocodile tongues with a guarantee that
they will take away his suffering. James
drops the bagat the base of a peach tree,
releasing the tongues, and the "giant
peach" begins to grow.
Upon accidentally swallowing the
last magic crocodile tongue, lames
climbs up inside the peach and is trans
| formed into an animated figure
(hmm). Here he meets his animated
insect friends Grasshopper (Simon
i Callow), Centipede (Richard Drey
fuss), Spider (Susan Sarandon) and

Earthworm (1 )avid Ihewelis). Ihe rest
of the film chronicles this hand of
merry figurines and their adventures as
they travel in their peach to New York
City.
There's a lot of singing and danc
ing, too.
While the story is sweet ind en
gaging (lames stands up to his evil
aunts in the last scene), I am not sure
it the movie is appropriate for the
young audience for which it is in
tended. I he animated figures (pro
duced hv I iin Burton of "Nightmare
before Christmas") are brilliantly
and meticulously done. Some ot the
choreography and movements ot the
characters are down-right amazing.
However, the animated insects and
even lames are a bit too surreal and
freaky to be considered "cute or en
dearing. In fact some ot the scenes
approach disturbing.
Even more disturbing are the
scenes where human characters are
used. Although these scenes were
meant to present a fairy-tale type at
mosphere, there is something just a
little off that makes the Utopian seem
just a little creepy.
Roald had stated that this story
would be too difficult to translate to
film and perhaps he was right. I low
ever, the animation and story are
both wonderfully done. So if you
don't get the shivers easily then by all
means this is the film for you.
