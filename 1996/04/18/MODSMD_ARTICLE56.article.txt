# The 						Last Supper
## 
### 
The hosts at the table of "The Last Supper"
don't say grace, they talk politics during the
meal, and they eat their salad after the main
course — Kuropean style.
No, this is not a religious movie about
Jesus and his twelve disciples, but instead an
intriguing dark comedy about five oh-so-lib
eral graduate students in lowa on a quest to
purge the world of conservatism.
The housemates (Courtney B. Vance, Ron
Eldard, Cameron Diaz, Annabeth Cish and
Johnathan Penner) start off being mild intel
lectual left-wingers, believing in the power of
discourse and protest, until one rainy evening
their table is disturbed by a racist, neo-na/i,
ex-marine red-neck.
Their guest challenges the ineffectiveness

ot liberalism and convinces them that life is
only meaningful it you can "take a stand lor
somethin' you can kill tor.'
Using the hypothetical idea of time travel
as the perfect justification, they decide to
eliminate from the world those who they
deem (in their finite wisdom) the Hitlers of
tomorrow, to make the world a better place.
And so they open the foot of their table a
long string of victim-guests: from the horrif
ic homophobic, sexist, anti-abortion, anti
earth "these are not people, they're people
who hate", to the more mildly offensive pro
censorship and anti-sex education characters
— all who must be annihilated.
However, there remains a small amount of
unresolved guilt which doesn't sit too well
with these wine-drinking, cashmere sweater
wearing, Mercedes-driving-with -a- DAR
WIN-fish-sticker do-gooders. Their sedate
dinners turn wild and their passive lives turn

aggressive and full of strife.
Like a good meal, the sweetest part of this
movie comes at the end, when the hosts are
forced to question their own premises. It cul
minates in strange twist of fate, a subtly iron
ic anti-climax that leaves the viewer mesmer
ized.
This film has every ingredient of good
quality: unusual characters, creative cine
matography, a suspenseful story line, mean
ingful imagery and excellent acting. Rut best
of all is the script: conversation that is at once
clever, witty and very provoking.
This film has a message too: it is a critique
of intolerance on both sides of the political
spectrum. But it is wrapped up so well into
such a good story that its not preachy at all —
very effective.
And so I'd like to propose a toast, to a
movie worth your time.
