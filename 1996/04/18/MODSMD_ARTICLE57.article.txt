## Ghost in the Shell 
### 
Just becausea film containssome
neat element not seen often in
movies — Patrick Swayze and Wes
ley Snipes in drag, four black
women in leading roles, superb
computer animation — doesn't
mean it shouldn't be held to the
same standards as other movies.
Mamoru Oshi's "Ghost in the
Shell," based on an acclaimed series
of comic books by the artist
Masamune Shiro, was produced by
the people who brought us "Akira,"
so of course the animation is phe
nomenal. It all looks very cool but
the film falls short when it comes to
the basics of film storytelling. The
audience is kept completely in the
dark for more than half of the film.
I suspect that even if you are a big
science fiction buff, you'd still find
yourself focusing more on the
unanswered questions than the pic
tures on the screen.
The basic story: the world has
become "borderless" because of the
Net. Augmented humans live in
virtual environments, watched
over by law enforcement agents
that can download themselves into
"super-powered, crime-busting
mecha." The ultimate secret agent
of the future, Project 2501, is not
human and has no physical body so

it can travel freely through the in
formation highways of the world.
Project 2501 decides it wants a
physical existence and chaos ensues
as the race begins to capture Project
2501 before it finds a host body and
escapes for good. Simple, right?
This film has a very complicated
story-line, very complex anima
tion, but very simplistic characters.
The most predominant character is
Major Motoko Kusanagh. She is the
animator's wet dream — always
taking time off her search for Pro
ject 2501 to flaunt and caress her
double 1) breasts. The animators
manage to portray drops of water
rolling off her nipples perfectly, but
her mouth doesn't seem capable of
moving correctly when she speaks.
This is true for all of the characters.
Their mouths just open and close.
The Smurfs had more dimen
sion than the characters in this film.
Everyone speaks in cliches. Grant
ed, this type of film is not concerned
with character development or
human experience, but why not?
At $7 a seat and 82 minutes of my
time, this film owes me and every
one else just a little more than it de
livers. Growing up with computers,
I've never been that mesmerized by
computerized animation. II you go
ga-ga over this stuff or would enjoy
indulging in the novelty of it, you
should go check out this movie, but
I, on the other hand, was bored.
Very bored.
