# Jane Eyre
## 
### 
As another literary drama hits the big
screen, you might be a little wary (although
Emma Thompson's name is not on the mar
quee and the credits do not list Jane Austen).
But have faith, Franco Zeffirelli does a nice
job with Charlotte Bronte's gothic romance
"lane Eyre."
The film remains faithful to the book
whose memory occupies a special spot in my
mind (Best Romance Read During Adoles
cence), but you don't even have to be on such

intimate terms with this book to appreciate
the movie.
Jane Eyre, a love-deprived orphan, sur
vives too many years at an abusive girls'
home, then becomes the governess for a
mysterious master, Mr. Rochester. Once they
do meet however, they take a liking to each
other which neither are willing to admit. To
complicate things, Mr. Rochester gets en
gaged to a pretty pointless upper class
woman (played by a pointless and pretty Elle
MacPherson), and keeps a strange secret in
his attic.
The Shirley Temple of art house film,
Anna Paquin (Oscar winner for the lane Eyre

rip-off, "The Piano"), plays the young Jane
with a spoiled brat spirit that could be mis
taken for pride and a strong will. An unfa
miliar Charlotte Gainsbourg plays the
grown-up Jane perfectly. Somehow, she
mixes docility with spirit and intelligence to
create a Jane whose feelings you do not want
to hurt.
William Hurt does not exactly have the
darkly handsome look of the Mr. Rochester
ot my youth but he does create the mystery,
sardonic wit and angry soul of the character.
I iurt makes this confusing character likable.
The look of the film is nice — the camera
captures misty English landscapes and man

sions without overdoing it. The film moves
well, although sometimes a little too well: to
wards the end, the editing is hastily done.
The only thing that really bothered me
about this film was the music — it was ob
noxious. My ears were constantly bombard
ed with sweeping and swelling melodies,
music that was trying hard to create passion
when not much was going on except for a
scenery change.
Despite the music, I really enjoyed "Jane
Eyre." It's nice to remember one of my fa
vorite books with such a faithful screen
adaptation.
