# Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy
## 
### 
The world is a pretty sad place. War,
poverty, death — it's enough to make one
down-right miserable.
Well, why be miserable when you can be
happy? If they sold happiness in a bottle,
would you buy it?
That's the general plot behind "Kids in the
1 fall: Brain Candy." A story about corporate
greed and how the world found happiness in
a convenient little pill. It's better than Prozac.
There are five actors and comedians in the
group, but each one can quickly change their
appearance to fit the scene so that it seems

that there is a cast of over 20 characters. Scott
Thompson, one of the five, switches between
being a stodgy female scientist, to a loving
grandmother and even to the Queen of Eng
land in the course of ten minutes.
This is the first big-screen debut for "Kids
in the Hall," a comedy troupe from yonder
north — Canada. Their versatile antics, from
dressing in drag to mutating into greedy cor
porate slugs, parody a wide range of social
ills.
While down-right hilarious in some parts,
the film suffers from a schizophrenic struc
ture, often jumping nonsensically from one
scene to another, the plot tenuously sewn to
gether by the happy drug, Gleemonex, and
those who develop and sell it.
But the film is funny overall, and for you
social pundits, there is a bit of serious social

commentary hidden beneath all that sub
terfuge. From Dr. Cooper, who is pressured
into making the drug available before proper
testing to corporate managers who can see
nothing but dollars even though the drug is
later found to have one serious side effect (it
puts people into a "happy coma" after ex
tended use), the film puts a silly spin on a
chilling question.
In one scene, Don Roritor, the CEO, sug
gests putting all the ghetto children on
CJleemoncx to solve the problem of despair
and inner-city crime. And why don't we just
put the sad people of the world on drugs.
"Apparently, their lives are horrible," he
says. And of course, the profits of increased
sales of the drug won't hurt either.
And so we are left asking why not hook
the world on anti-depressants, then we

would all be able to live life like some cheesy
90210 episode. Being sad is, like so passe.
Well, like the irascible taxi driver who
gives the intro to the film said, "life is short,
life is shit, and soon, it will be over." Yeah,
bad things happen and we hurt now and
then, otherwise, there we would never ap
preciate the good things: the quiet walks,
sunny days and silly movies like this. Dr.
Cooper himself begs on TV that his drug
was meant for really depressed people, not
for those who forget to make reservation
for dinner or if the drapes clash with your
outfit.
It was a pretty funny movie, and I enjoyed
a lot of it, but I would say that unless you've
seen or know the style of "Kids in the Hall,"
it may end up being wasted effort.
