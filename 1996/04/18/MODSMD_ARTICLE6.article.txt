# Pollo's to lease Tresidder spot
## Local chain wins bid over Taco Bell 
### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
University officials will an
nounce today that Polio's, a local
Mexican restaurant chain, in
tends to lease space in Tresidder
Union and will begin serving
what its owner calls "the best
burrito in Palo Alto" this fall.
Present at the 2 p.m. confer
ence — which is open to the pub
lic — will be the chain's owner
Ray Klein, Dean of Students
Marc Wais and members of a 12-
person advisory board which
spent three months deciding
Tresidder's reorganization.
The board, which includes
four students, unanimously ap
proved Polio's lease, Wais said.
The announcement ends four
years of negotiations over
Tresidder expansion, which
began in 1992 when the Univer
sity announced its intention to
seek a Taco Bell franchise for the
union. Talks subsequently
stalled, and when the discussions
began again this school year,
Taco Bell became the subject of
student protests.
A written statement address
ing the decision to stop negotia
tions with Taco Bell will be re

leased at the conference, which
will occur in Tresidder's Sequoia
Room, Wais said. He would not
comment further.
Polio's, which has restaurants
in Palo Alto and Menlo Park, has
received awards from local media
