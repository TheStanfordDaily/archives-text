# Pollo's to lease Tresidder spot
## Local chain wins bid over Taco Bell 
### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
University officials will an
nounce today that Polio's, a local
Mexican restaurant chain, in
tends to lease space in Tresidder
Union and will begin serving
what its owner calls "the best
burrito in Palo Alto" this fall.
Present at the 2 p.m. confer
ence — which is open to the pub
lic — will be the chain's owner
Ray Klein, Dean of Students
Marc Wais and members of a 12-
person advisory board which
spent three months deciding
Tresidder's reorganization.
The board, which includes
four students, unanimously ap
proved Polio's lease, Wais said.
The announcement ends four
years of negotiations over
Tresidder expansion, which
began in 1992 when the Univer
sity announced its intention to
seek a Taco Bell franchise for the
union. Talks subsequently
stalled, and when the discussions
began again this school year,
Taco Bell became the subject of
student protests.
A written statement address
ing the decision to stop negotia
tions with Taco Bell will be re

leased at the conference, which
will occur in Tresidder's Sequoia
Room, Wais said. He would not
comment further.
Polio's, which has restaurants
in Palo Alto and Menlo Park, has
received awards from local media
for the best meal under $5,
among other honors.
"They responded to our crite
ria in terms of quality food and
reasonable prices and late hours
which we think students will find
appealing," Wais said. "There
was a strong commitment that
they're going to work and cater to
students."
Hon Appetit, which currently
runs Tresidder's eating estab
lishments, will continue service.
This is part of the new competi
tive environment Wais and the
committee are trying to create at
Tresidder.
Klein said he is excited to open
the restaurant and hopes the
food, the prices and the centrali
ty will be a draw for students.
"Most of the kids really stay
on campus except for the week
ends," he said. "We felt this is a
great opportunity to be right on
campus."
Klein said he plans to use
Stanford students as employees
at the Polio's, which will likely
remain open until 1 a.m. on
weekends.
The menu at Polio's contains
a plethora of burrito options, a
vegetarian menu, rotisserie
chicken and 99 cent quesadillas,
among other choices. Klein said
the prices at the Tresidder site

will not differ from his other lo
cations, despite having to give
Tresidder a percentage of the
profits each month.
"We're three clicks up from
fast food," Klein said. "That was
the big attraction for the people
at Stanford. Our decor and our
food is much healthier and fresh
ly prepared."
A currently unused area in
Tresidder — the site of the for
mer bowling alley, which was re
moved in 1981 — will be reopened
to house the restaurant, which
will anchor one corner of the
union. Diners will receive a num
ber upon ordering to pick up their
food.
The site has been planned to
house an eatery for more than
seven years. A "food service mas
ter plan" was postponed by the
University after the 1989 earth
quake. In 1992, University offi
cials announced a $2 million ex
pansion plan, which called for
moving the Corner Pocket to the
space occupied by Tresidder Ex
press and expanding the Coffee
House into the arcade and game
room. Negotiations to house a
Taco Bell soon began.
Although plans for the Taco
Bell were finalized in 1993, con
struction on the restaurant was
repeatedly postponed. It origi
nally was scheduled to open in
January 1994, but the opening
was delayed due to planning
problems, asbestos and new
ma naeement.

Provost Condoleezza Rice put
the project on hold indefinitely
later that year. The University
still owns Taco Bell equipment,
Wais said.
Since then, Taco Hell and its
parent company PepsiCo, have
been the subjects of vigorous
protest by members of Students
for Environmental Action at
Stanford.
"We're very glad to hear about
it," said Tim Knight, a SEAS
member. "Polio's is much better
than Taco Hell."
The issue was taken up again
when the advisory board was cre
ated earlier this year, and Klein
was soon contacted as a prospec
tive vendor.
Polio's is not a newcomer to
Stanford, Klein said. The chain
currently supports Stanford's
volleyball teams.
At the announcement today,
University officials will reveal
specific floor plans for the
restaurant and announce fur
ther reorganization of Tresidder
vendors.
The seating arrangement and
lighting on the first floor will be
enhanced to create an environ
ment more conducive to studying
and mingling, Wais said.
"Our intent is to review the
entire floor plan of Tresidder and
to lease out as much of the space
as we can to vendors and agencies
that can provide programs and
services ... to faculty and stu
dents." Wais said.
