I just watched "Frankie and Johnny" this
weekend. It's a wonderful movie with both
Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer giving
strong performances. However, I thought it
was odd that Pacino received top hilling
when the film is completely Pfeiffer's story.
I was driving down Van Ness in San Fran
cisco and I saw the marquee for "Up Close
and Personal" read: Robert Redford in "Up
Close and Personal" with Michelle Pfeiffer.
Now that film, no matter how crappy it is, is
again Completely Pfeiffer's story. And yet
Robert Redford gets top billing.
Perhaps I'm strange. But I don't know
anyone who went to see that film lor Robert
Redford or who refers to it as that "Robert
Redford film." Maybe it's because Redford
gives his audience nothing to respond to.
I'm not on some committee to investigate
crimes against Michelle Pfeiffer, but I do feel
that this billing of the male over the female
actor is clearly indicative of the ridiculous

sexism in Flollvwood.
People say things like top billing and
salary are just a function of which actors can
draw in the greatest audience. Hut Michelle
Pfeiffer (with a $ l ) million per movie price
tag) has had far more box office draws in re
cent years than Robert Redford million
per flick) and Al Pacino ($7.4).
Kevin Costner (SK.6) was just given the
award for biggest blockbuster flop, while
Meryl Streep ($7) still holds the scepter of
power over discriminating audiences. Per
haps the problem is that discriminatingaudi
ences are choosing to go to the theater or the
opera instead. And as far as talent is con
cerned — who would argue that Meryl
Streep is not a far more capable actor than
Kevin Costncr?
It is no secret that the big actresses in Hol
lywood are far superior in ability to the big
actors. If Susan Sarandon ($7.8) and Tom
Hanks ($2O) went to the mat, who do you

think would prevail? Tom Cruise (512.8)
(a.k.a. Mr. Nicole Kidman) hasn't had a good
film since "Rain Man."
This power dynamic is also odd because
most of the big actors are rather dated. lom
Cruise peaked in the 80s. Mel (iibson, hav
ing been humped by Brad I'itt and Antonio
Banderas, is no longer one ot Hollywood's
sexiest. Kven Den/.el Washington ($8.6) can't
seem to drum up an audience or choose a
good film lately (i.e. "Virtuosity," "Devil in a
Blue Dress").
Mel Gibson, who's fairy godmother
blessed him with two Oscars this year for the
over-hyped "Braveheart," has a $12.8 million
price tag. And yet someone like Emma
Thompson ($6.2), who not only gave a di
vine performance in "Sense and Sensibility"
but wrote the equally divine screenplay, gets
less than Mel and half what Demi Moore
($12.8) makes.
Demi Moore can be considered the first

woman to break into the Hollywood Pac-10
of Big Salaries. And how did she do it? She
dropped a tear from her right eye in "Ghost."
Oh — and she took off her clothes in every
thing else. So this is what it takes for Holly
wood actresses to make it big.
Demi crouched between Michael Dou
glas' legs in yet another Douglas-wet-dream
tan tasywhere-a-desperate-woman-won't
settle-for-any-man-other-than-him (see:
Disclosure"). Julie Roberts spread her legs
on a piano for Richard Gere ("Pretty
Woman"). 1 ook what it took for people to
notice Elizabeth Shue. She played a hooker.
And Mia Sorvino's on-screen prostitution
got her an Oscar.
So that's it. That's the secret to success for
actresses in Hollywood — have a hot sex
scene with a famous aging white man.
Maybe that's why Pfeiffer agreed to do "Up
Close and Personal" with Redford — she
wanted a raise.
