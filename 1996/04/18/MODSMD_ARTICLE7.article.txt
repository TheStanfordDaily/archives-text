### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff with AP wire reports 
Pressure generated by stu
dents nationwide may cause
PepsiCo to reconsider its invest
ments in Myanmar, the nation
in Southeast Asian formerly
known as Burma, a company ex
ecutive said yesterday.
If student protest continues
to grow, the company could end
its investments in the country,
which is run by a military dicta
torship and has a poor human
rights record.
