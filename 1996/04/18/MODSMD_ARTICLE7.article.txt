# PepsiCo may pull Burma investments
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff with AP wire reports 
Pressure generated by stu
dents nationwide may cause
PepsiCo to reconsider its invest
ments in Myanmar, the nation
in Southeast Asian formerly
known as Burma, a company ex
ecutive said yesterday.
If student protest continues
to grow, the company could end
its investments in the country,
which is run by a military dicta
torship and has a poor human
rights record.
"We are absolutely elated," said
Students for Environmental Ac
tion at Stanford member Nick
Thompson, a junior.
SEAS has led student protests
against PepsiCo, including one at
a nearby Taco Bell — a company
which is a subsidiary of PepsiCo —
and has collected more than 2,000
signatures to block Taco Bell from
becoming a vendor on campus.
PepsiCo is "encouraging us to
do as much as we can" to continue
the student movement, said SEAS
activist Tim Knight, a junior.
"This is really gathering momen
tum."
Activists at several other Amer
ican universities have also started
boycotting such PepsiCo products
as Pepsi Cola, Piz/.a Hut and Taco
Bell, saying the company con
tributes to human rights abuses in
Myanmar by investing there. Pep
siCo had sales of $8 million in
Myanmar in 1995.
The country's current leader
ship came to power in 1988 after

gunning down thousands of pro
democracy demonstrators. It re
fused to honor a 1990 election it
lost by a landslide and has de
clined to negotiate a political set
tlement with 1991 Nobel Prize
winner Aung San Suu Kyi, who
has called for a halt to investment
in Myanmar.
Christopher Sinclair, the chief
executive of PepsiCo Poods and
Beverages International, told a
news conference that "there must
be 10 other countries with records
as bad" as Myanmar but no one was
protesting PepsiCo's or other com
panies' involvement in those coun
tries. He did not specify the 10.
By the standards used today to
judge Myanmar, Sinclair said, one
could make the case that "in the
1960s we shouldn't have been
doing business in the United
States."
He did, however, say PepsiCo
could change its mind if protests
increased significantly.
"Obviously pressure from con
sumers and shareholders is what
we'll respond to," Sinclair said.
Both Knight and Thompson
said while it is a positive step for
PepsiCo to reconsider its invest

ments, student groups still need to
focus on the investments compa
nies like Unocal have in Myanmar.
Texaco Oil also has invest
ments in Myanmar and company
officials say that by being there,
the company provides a good ex
ample to the government and good
working conditions for the natives
they employ.
Sinclair explained PepsiCo's
company philosophy: "We believe
in building bridges and opening up
societies. . . . Isolating economies
doesn't work. We've isolated
North Korea and Cuba and
they're probably the two most re
pressive societies on earth."
PepsiCo sells its drinks in
Myanmar through a joint venture
with a local partner, Thein Tun,
which is also involved in separate
joint ventures with the military
government.
Myanmar's government rarely
comments on human rights alle
gations against it; when it does, it
denies them.
Thompson said SEAS activists
are planning a demonstration at
the Unocal shareholders meeting
in early June as part of the protest
against investors in such countries.
