# Harry Wu's wife gives Kresge address
## Speech focuses on Chinese violations 
### Dana Hangai Contributing writer 
Addressing the controversial
topic of the Chinese government's
human rights abuses, Ching-lee
Wu, wife of human rights activist
and Hoover Institution Research
Fellow Harry Wu, spoke on her hus
band's behalf before an impas
sioned audience of 300 at Kresge
Auditorium last night.
Harry Wu, who served 19 years
as a political prisoner and has made
many trips back to China to docu
ment and film human rights abus
es, was originally scheduled as
speaker. Due to a last minute re
quest to testify before the United
Nations Human Rights Commis
sion in Geneva, he was unable to
make his presentation.
His wife, who has accompanied
Wu on his trips to China and fre
quently served as his photographer
and camera woman, instead made
the presentation. After showing a
film the Wus made, Ching-lee Wu

accepted a number of questions
from the audience, many of which
challenged her position in opposi
tion to the Chinese government.
The speech was sponsored by
Amnesty International, Stanford
Friends of Tibet and Committee of
100 for Tibet.
Ching-lee Wu opened with a ref
erence to her husband's absence.
"Here I am once again," she said,
"speaking on behalf of my absent
husband. Thankfully, this time I
know where he is and when he will
be home."
Wu then read her husband's in
troductory speech to their film,
"Undisguised Killing: Public Exe
cution in China," which highlighted
the Chinese government's use of
public execution as a tool of the
state.
"Executions in China," Harry
Wu wrote in the speech, "are com
monly used by the government as a
kind of political education. F rom the
very beginning, Mao (Tse-tung)
needed to show the Chinese that dis
sent would end in death."
In China, according to Harry Wu,
children are excused from class in
order to witness the executions. In
his film, in front of thousands of cit
izens, two political prisoners were
shot at close range by police officers
with automatic rifles.
Victims' families are charged for
the price of the bullet and the crema
tion, according to Chinese political
tradition. If the family refuses or is
unable to pay, they will not receive
their family member's ashes. Exe
cuted prisoners' organs are also re
moved and used in up to 90 percent of
transplants in China, Harry Wu said.
During the question period after
the film, several audience members
attacked Harry Wu's accusations,
sparking a heated debate.
"Why should you believe that
they were transplanting organs?"
audience member Helen Lee asked.
"We didn't see it. We only saw them
put into the white ambulance. Why

should we believe this film?"
Other audience members said
Americans have no right to criticize
the Chinese government's execu
tions, as the practice also exists in
the United States.
In response, Ching-lee Wu an
swered, "You can't make a simple
comparison with the United States.
I think there's a whole system of due
process that you should look at that
will tell you volumes about the na
ture of public execution in China.
"Of course you might not believe
these executions because you
haven't seen it, but if you had a fami
ly member executed or fellow Chi
nese executed or a family member
missing for 30 years, you would not
be standing up trying to make a
mockery of this presentation," she
said.
Program organizers said despite
the open hostility, the forum served
a need for debate.
"It's definitely a dialogue that
needs to be heard," said sophomore
Mark Bell, president of Friends of
Tibet. "It's obviously a very touchy
subject. Hopefully, this will prove ef
fective but there were definitely peo
ple in the audience who have very
firm opinions on the matter."
