						life of a law student
## Phipps reflects on traveling, physics books

Editor's note: In 1968, Andy Warhol
made the oft-quoted (and misquoted)
statement, "In the future, everyone will
be famous for 15 minutes." With that in
mind, in addition to the idea that every
one has a story to tell, this article marks
the debut of a series about various mem
bers of the Stanford community. Inter
view subjects are picked entirely at ran
dom, from the Stanford Directory.
When Peter Phipps was a 6-year-old
living in Ramstein, Germany, the Ger
man kids threw snowballs at him at the
bus stop. "It doesn't do much for diplo
matic relations," Phipps said. Luckily,
life has only gotten better since then.
Now a 22-year-old in his first year at
the Law School, Phipps spent his child
hood moving from place to place due to

his father's position as an officer in the
U.S. Air Force. Phipps was born in Abi
lene, Texas, moved to Germany at the
age of 3, moved to Montgomery, Ala., in
time to start first grade, moved to
northern Virginia for second grade,
moved to Denver for seventh through
ninth grade and finally settled in Day
ton, Ohio, for the duration of high
school and college.
About the many places he has called
home, Phipps said, "It's sort of boring
to me. It's all the same." He did admit,
however, that Alabama left a notable in
fluence on him. Even after moving, "I
had a horrible Southern accent," he
said.
His favorite locale, Phipps said, was
Virginia. "Once a week, we'd take a field
trip to a park or museum in D.C."
Phipps is the oldest of four children.
His siblings are Jim, 20, Cindy, 18, and
Bob, 16. In response to the question of
whether Phipps' parents purposely had
their children at two-year intervals,
Phipps said, "I don't know. I don't ask.

Hoping to keep his life "multidimensional," first-year law student Peter Phipps regularly
travels to Honduras, plays basketball — and re-reads his old physics textbooks.
