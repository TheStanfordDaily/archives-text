# The 						life of a law student
## Phipps reflects on traveling, physics books

Editor's note: In 1968, Andy Warhol
made the oft-quoted (and misquoted)
statement, "In the future, everyone will
be famous for 15 minutes." With that in
mind, in addition to the idea that every
one has a story to tell, this article marks
the debut of a series about various mem
bers of the Stanford community. Inter
view subjects are picked entirely at ran
dom, from the Stanford Directory.
When Peter Phipps was a 6-year-old
living in Ramstein, Germany, the Ger
man kids threw snowballs at him at the
bus stop. "It doesn't do much for diplo
matic relations," Phipps said. Luckily,
life has only gotten better since then.
Now a 22-year-old in his first year at
the Law School, Phipps spent his child
hood moving from place to place due to

his father's position as an officer in the
U.S. Air Force. Phipps was born in Abi
lene, Texas, moved to Germany at the
age of 3, moved to Montgomery, Ala., in
time to start first grade, moved to
northern Virginia for second grade,
moved to Denver for seventh through
ninth grade and finally settled in Day
ton, Ohio, for the duration of high
school and college.
About the many places he has called
home, Phipps said, "It's sort of boring
to me. It's all the same." He did admit,
however, that Alabama left a notable in
fluence on him. Even after moving, "I
had a horrible Southern accent," he
said.
His favorite locale, Phipps said, was
Virginia. "Once a week, we'd take a field
trip to a park or museum in D.C."
Phipps is the oldest of four children.
His siblings are Jim, 20, Cindy, 18, and
Bob, 16. In response to the question of
whether Phipps' parents purposely had
their children at two-year intervals,
Phipps said, "I don't know. I don't ask.

Hoping to keep his life "multidimensional," first-year law student Peter Phipps regularly
travels to Honduras, plays basketball — and re-reads his old physics textbooks.
It doesn't bother me. I came
first."
Phipps' mother, Donna, is an
advocate for disability rights in
school systems. Phipps said his
mother became involved with is
sues of disability in part because
of his brothers: Jim has a neuro
logical disorder, and Rob has cere
bral palsy. However, Phipps was
quick to point out, "Bob is a much
better golfer than me. The doctor
said he would never walk, and he
just smokes me on the golf course.
I used to play two things with
him, golf and chess, and I've given
up playing both with him because
he beats me really bad."
Phipps said he still finds non
humiliating ways to spend time
with his brother. During the sum
mer after Phipps graduated from
the University of Dayton, he, Bob
and two friends traveled to Hon
duras together. Phipps had visit
ed Honduras two years before and
worked as an English teacher at a
rural mission school. The second
time he visited, he and his com
panions "worked in fields with
machetes, taking care of banana
and mango trees," he said.
His experiences in Honduras
have been some of the most bene
ficial of his life, Phipps said. "I
loved it. You sort of learn what's

important. You don't get bogged
down in daily concerns. I'd see
people who had hideous things
happen to them and dealt with life
so much better than people here
do. They were still nice, cheerful,
good people."
Phipps said maintaining a bal
anced perspective after returning
to the United States was not easy
either time. "That's why I seem to
be going back 1 to Honduras] every
two years," he said.
A level of balance was part of
what drew Phipps to Stanford. "It
seemed like a school that was con
sistent with who I am," he said.
"It emphasized balance. When I
visited, I saw people who had mul
tidimensional lives."
To keep his own life multidi
mensional, Phipps said, "I pre
tend that I can play guitar and
basketball. I've never taken gui
tar lessons. I bought a guitar in
January. I figured I'd have a
[summer] job in a remote city
where I wouldn't know anyone. I
would have to have something to
do before I fell asleep."
As it turns out, Phipps will be
working as a "summer associate"
in Columbus, Ohio, where "half of
everyone I know went to grad
school." The vision of himself
spending nights strumming on a
guitar in solitude, he said, "has
changed slightly."
In addition to playing the gui
tar and basketball, Phipps has a
hobby which is a bit more unusu

al: "I like to read my old physics
textbooks."
A physics and history major in
college, Phipps said he worries
that he has lost the knowledge he
acquired as an undergraduate. He
said he has always found physics
interesting. "It seems like an ex
tension of everybody's curiosity
about nature." Phipps said he
does not read books other than his
physics textbook.
About his days in college,
Phipps said, "I loved the Universi
ty of Dayton. There were really
good people there. You weren't
forced into being overly academic
or overly social. I got two majors."
Phipps said he was unaware at
the time that double majoring is a
fairly widespread phenomenon.
"I had never heard of that before.
I was like, 'Man, this school lets
me have two majors. This is in
sane.' I thought I was charting
crazy ground."
As for the crazy ground he'll
chart next, Phipps is unsure what
the future holds for him. He said
he does not know which area of
law most interests him and has
"no idea" where he'll be 10 years
from now. The only given about
Phipps' future is that, like his
past, it will be filled with travel.
"There are a lot of places I'd
like to visit," he said. "I don't
know how to say this without
sounding sacrilegious, but my top
three are Rome, Jerusalem and
Graceland."
