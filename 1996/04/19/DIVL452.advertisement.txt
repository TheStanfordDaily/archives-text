Work at a weekly newspaper in California this summer and earn a reporter's salary!
Students can write and report the news, or work in advertising, circulation, or production.
Internships generally last about 12 weeks. Here are some comments from past interns:
Intern for the Pacifica Tribune
"The Rebele internship exceeded my expectations. / encountered enormous opportunity to
ivritefor whichever beat I wanted and generate my own stories ... What was truly
unforgettable was the tremendous response I ivould get from Pacificans. People would stop
me to tell me they had enjoyed my story."
Intern for the Sonoma Index-Tribune
"I've done features, covered two fatal car crashes and interviewed local officials on a wide
range of subjects. There's nothing like the experience of working at a community-oriented
weekly newspaper, and 1 love it... I've been hired as a reporter."
Intern for WAVE Newspapers
"It exposed me to more facets of journalism than I had known about."
