This guy can't stop thinking about summer.
I never thought of Northwestern as
a summer hoc spot, but the campus
is right on Lake Michigan. They've
got beaches, intramural sports, arts
and crafts workshops, wine-tasting
and pottery making minicourses,
basketball and volleyball tourna
ments, campus musicals and the
atrical performances, outdoor
movies, and hiking and canoeing
trips in Wisconsin. All with
Northwestern Summer
Session '96... Prettv cool.
Summer in the Windy City
sounds like a great time.
Chicago has jazzfests, blues
fests, and gospelfests, Cubs and
Sox games, some of the best
museums and art galleries in
the world, and ethnic festivals
all summer 10ng... I d have
plenty to do, and its all just
minutes from the
Northwestern campus.
Northwesterns study abroad programs sound great. Prague, Czech
Republic; Alexandria, Egypt; and South Africa... They'd all be great oppor
tunities to earn college credit, and they're all places I'd like to visit. I hey've
changed so much in recent years. With the three- or six-week program in
Prague, I could learn about Czech politics from the inside, visit parts of
Bohemia and Moravia, enjoy Czech pubs and restaurants, and experience the
renaissance city's world-renowned architecture. I hen again, six weeks in
Alexandria, Egypt has its advantages. A five-day Nile cruise, a visit to Cairo's
Creat Pyramids, and all the festivals, beaches, and bazaars. Can't forget
South Africa. The wildlife viewing in Durban is supposed to be incredible,
and the program also includes the Kalahari dessert, Cape I own, and
Johannesburg. 1996 will be a hot summer!
I could use some extra credit
this summer, and I think
Northwesterns the place to go.
Summertime means smaller
classes and better access to some
of Northwesterns most popular
professors. They even have a
course on the Beatles, and if I
get ambitious, 1 can earn a full
year of college credit wi th
Northwesterns eight-week
intensive course sequences in
physics, chemistry, and nine lan
guages. ltd be nice to go back to
school in the fall with a few
extra credits on my transcript.
