### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The deans of three of Stanford's
schools reflected on their visions of
the University's future at the an
nual Academic Council meeting
yesterday in Kresge Auditorium.
Dean of the School of Engineer
ing James Gibbons, Dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences
John Shoven and Dean of the
School of Medicine Eugene Bauer
shared their insights on where
Stanford stands now and what
challenges it is likely to face in the
future.
The panel replaced the tradi
tional format for Academic Council
meetings, during which University
President Gerhard Casper has
given his State of the University
address in past years. This year's
address will be presented next fall.
Gibbons, Shoven and Bauer
made frequent reference to the
growing competition Stanford
faces and the need to support facul
ty, staff and students to keep the
University at the top.
"We face severe competition in
almost all areas in which we oper
ate," Shoven said.
At the same time, however,
"Stanford is a stronger and
stronger competitor in the academ
ic market," he added.
Staying on top when compared
with other institutions presents
the University a greater challenge
than ever, Gibbons said.
"Our basic objectives do not
seem to have changed too much in
the nearly 40 years I have been on
the faculty," he said. "What has
changed is the increasingly com
petitive environment."
Of primary concern when look
ing at such an environment is
maintaining quality of faculty in
both teaching and research, Gib
bons said.
"The problem is," he said,
"these characteristics are in high
demand everywhere, both in uni
versities and in industry."
Maintaining a stellar reputation
is becoming more and more impor
tant as research funding disap
pears, Gibbons said. But research
structures may also need to be
changed to attract grants.
Monetary support for research
is more and more frequently going
to interdisciplinary collaborative
efforts. However, such funding
"comes increasingly at the expense
of funding for research by a single
primary investigator," he added.
Gibbons suggested that the
most important move the Univer
sity should take during the next
several years is to raise an endow
ment to support basic research and
scholarship.
Bauer also recognized the value
of researchers working together.

"Faculty productivity in today's
science world is measured on col
laborative efforts and interdepart
mental approaches," he said.
From the perspective of stu
dents, Stanford cannot compete by
having an especially well-known
strength in just one department.
Because of that, Gibbons said, the
University must emphasize that it
is strong in all areas.
Shoven agreed that broad-based
excellence and the ease with which
faculty and students can work to
gether across departments makes
Stanford stand out.
"One hallmark of Stanford is
that administrative and discipli
nary boundaries are permeable,"
he said, adding that "Stanford is
much more than the sum of its
parts."
In order to make Stanford's
overall strength even more obvi
ous, the University needs to "em
phasize what differentiates us
from other great academic institu
tions," Shoven said.

"I think we are one of the few
universities that has the full array
of professional schools represent
ed, and each one is near the top," he
said. "It's clearly in our interest
and it's our intent to maintain
these distinguishing features."
Bauer relayed the six goals Med
ical School faculty and staff formu
lated during a retreat in Novem
ber.
The goals were to continue to
make discoveries in biology and
biomedical sciences, to transfer
such discoveries to diagnostic and
therapeutic uses, to retain faculty,
to create medical opportunities for
students, to reflect diversity and to
contribute to the University as a
whole.
The Medical School has enjoyed
significant success in part because
the school was moved from San
Francisco to the main campus
about 30 years ago, Bauer said. Stu
dents and faculty alike are attracted
to the location, he said, along with
the facilities and opportunities.
