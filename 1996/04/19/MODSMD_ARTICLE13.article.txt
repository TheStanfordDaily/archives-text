## Smoker's gum now available 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Smokers can now chew their
way to quitting — without a prescription.
Nicorette, the nicotine-dispensing gum that has been
sold only under a doctor's supervision for 12 years, was
introduced yesterday as an over-the-counter medicine.
The price is high — about $350 for a 12-week pro
gram. The marketer, SmithKline Beecham PLC, says
that's about the same as a 1 1/2-pack-a-day cigarette
habit.
Yesterday's introduction symbolizes the renewed
interest on the part of drug companies in what has been
a dormant market for anti-smoking products.
Sales of prescription Nicorette gum and nicotine-dis
pensing arm patches have stagnated in recent years as
side effects and the psychological frustrations of quitting
have held the success rate to about 25 percent.
Nicorette has a peppery taste some smokers find dis
tasteful. The patches have been known to cause skin
rashes and nightmares.
Drug makers are hoping that switching the products
to non-prescription status will revive the market.
Nicorette, originally sold in the United States by Mar
ion Merrell Dow Inc., of Kansas City, Mo., was approved
for non-prescription sales by the Food and Drug Admin
istration in February.
Marion, which has since been taken over by the Ger
man drug company Hoechst AG and is now called
Hoechst Marion Roussel, partnered with SmithKline to
sell Nicorette over the counter.
On Friday, an advisory committee to the FDA will
consider applications from Hoechst Marion Roussel and
Pharmacia & Upjohn to sell their Nicoderm and
Nicotrol patches without a prescription.
In the meantime, several companies are experiment
ing with more powerful nicotine patches as the next gen
eration of prescription products.
And last month, the FDA approved Nicotrol NS, the
first nicotine nasal spray, a prescription-only product
sold by McNeil Consumer Products, a division of John
son & Johnson.
