# Deadliest attack yet
## Israeli shells kill at least 75 in U.N. camp 
### 
QANA, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli shells
killed at least 75 Lebanese refugees yester
day, filling a U.N. camp with blood, horror
and survivors' cries for revenge. Israel admit
ted an "unfortunate mistake" in the attack,
which seemed certain to deepen further the
hatreds of the Middle East.
The carnage, which left bodies torn apart,
was the worst since Israel began its
onslaught against Hezbollah guerrillas in
south Lebanon eight days ago. While
expressing regret for the civilians' deaths,
Israel fiercely defended its Lebanon cam
paign and said the shells that hit the civilians
had been aimed at Hezbollah rocket launch
ers.
President Clinton called for a cease-fire by
all parties to the fighting and ordered Secre
tary of State Warren Christopher to the
region to mediate. Israel said it would accept
a cease-fire if others agreed to it, a move that
would leave Israel short of its goal of shutting
down the Hezbollah war machine.
The IsraeU attack left the U.N. base lit
tered with butchered and headless bodies,
shredded clothing and scraps of building
materials. Badly wounded people were
rushed to a hospital, where angry civilians
attacked three Hezbollah members, beating
them with sticks and chairs and accusing
them of being the source of Lebanon's mis
ery.
Timur Goksel, spokesman for the 4,500-
strong U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon,
confirmed that 75 people perished in the
Qana attack.
Lebanese leaders called the Israeli
shelling "the mother of all atrocities" and a
new page in"the annals of terror."
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said,
"I'm pained by every person, every woman,

every child, who is being killed," But he said
Israel had "no choice but to defend its citi
zens," and he accused the Iranian-backed
guerrillas of Hezbollah of hiding behind civil
ians.
The United Nations said that shortly
before the Israeli shells landed, Hezbollah
guerrillas about 300 yards from the U.N.
compound had fired two Katyusha rockets
and eight mortar rounds at the Israelis. The
Israeli shells apparently were in retaliation
for that fire, but missed their target.
Unlike the hundreds of thousands of
Lebanese who fled north when Israel warned
it would attack their villages, the 6,000
refugees at U.N. bases had elected to stay in
the south, believing they were safe among
the peacekeepers. About 500 refugees were
at the U.N. base in Qana.
Refugee children were playing outside,
watched by their parents from a grass hut —
a traditional bouri that the 70 Fijian soldiers
at the base had built to remind themselves of
their Pacific Island home — when the first of
five 155-mm howitzer shells slammed into
the U.N. base at 3 p.m. It was just after
lunch.
As the smoke cleared from the compound,
dozens of victims lay on the ground in pools
of blood, their bodies cut to pieces by shrap
nel. Some bodies were headless. Peacekeep
ers broke down in tears as they covered the
dead with blankets.
Women wailed and beat their chests as
they stood over the bodies. Men slapped their
palms to their foreheads in disbelief, and
some shouted: "Death to Israel! Death to
America!"
More than a hundred people were wound
ed, including four soldiers from the Fijian
force at Qana.
