# Congress approves terrorism legislation

WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress passed
long-awaited legislation yesterday that would
give federal law officers new powers to use
against terrorism, sending the bill to President
Clinton on the eve of the first anniversary of
the Oklahoma City bombing.
The bill — which also would limit federal
appeals by prisoners, including death-row
inmates — was passed by the House 293-133. It
had been approved by the Senate a day earlier,
91-8.
Clinton was expected to sign the measure
next week, after he returns from overseas, even
though it lacks numerous other law enforce
ment powers he had sought.
"Today, Congress took an important step in
making our country more safe and secure from

the violent cowards who would tear at the fabric
of civilized order," House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde said after the vote.
Attorney General Janet Reno said the legis
lation — a compromise between separate Sen
ate and House bills — contains "some very
effective tools that we can use in our efforts to
combat terrorism."
Specifically, she cited provisions that would
allow deportation of alien terrorists without
disclosing classified evidence against them, pre
vent fund raising in the United States for ter
rorists, and require taggants, or chemical
labels, in plastic explosives so they can be
traced.
To Republican supporters, the bill's key pro
vision is its limit on so-called habeas corpus

appeals by prisoners, primarily because it is
expected to end delays in executions.
"There is no clearer link, no stronger link,
between effective anti-terrorism legislation and
deterring criminal acts of violence in this coun
try than habeas and death-penalty reform,"
said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.
The change would tell those considering a
terrorist act that they can no longer "come into
our country and kill our citizens, and destroy
our government institutions and know that
they will be able to spend the next 25 years
laughing at us, thumbing their nose at the fam
ilies of victims," he said.
On the other side, Rep. Barney Frank, D-
Mass., noted that the only people eligible for
such appeals are already incarcerated.
