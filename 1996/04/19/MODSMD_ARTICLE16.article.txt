# 18 people die in Egypt

CAIRO, Egypt (AP) — In an
attack that may have been a case of
mistaken identity, three men
opened fire with submachine guns
yesterday at a hotel near the pyra
mids, killing 18 Greeks on a pil
grimage to Christian holy sites. Sev
enteen people were wounded.
Police blamed Muslim insur
gents for the attack, the deadliest in
their four-year campaign to over
throw the largely secular govern
ment and install strict Islamic rule.
There was no immediate claim of
responsibility, but the insurgents
have targeted tourists in the past to
cripple Egypt's vital tourism indus
try.
Police officials said they were
investigating whether the gunmen
mistook the Greeks for Israelis,
who are known to frequent the
hotel. Israel's bombardment of
Lebanon this week has outraged

much of the Muslim world.
As with the dead, all but one of
the 17 wounded — an Egyptian
parking attendant — were Greek
tourists, most of them elderly.
Three of them were hospitalized in
critical condition.
The attack began at about 7 a.m.
as the tourists, part of an 88-mem
ber group traveling from Athens,
were about to board a bus outside
the Europa Hotel on Pyramids
Road.
Shouting "God Ls Great!" — the
war cry of Muslim militants around
the world — the attackers sprayed
gunfire for five frenzied minutes,
then escaped with a driver in a van,
witnesses and police said.
"They knocked us all down.
They were firing. It was chaos. I fell
down. I lost my teeth. I lost my
glasses," loannis Manolakakis told
Athens' Skai radio station.
