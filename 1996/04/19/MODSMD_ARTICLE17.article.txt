Government admits leaks in Unabomber case
HELENA, Mont. (AP) — The government admitted yesterday
that some of its agents have leaked confidential information about
the Unabomber case, but argued that the misbehavior was not
significant enough to let suspect Theodore Kaczynski go free.
Meanwhile, in Chicago, a woman who worked with Kaczynski
almost 20 years ago said yesterday that they dated only twice —
and she rejected any suggestion that the abortive romance some
how sparked the Unabomber attacks.
Ellen Tarmichael also confirmed reports that after she broke
off the relationship, Kaczynski harassed her by posting limericks
about her at the packing material plant, prompting his younger
brother, David Kaczynski, to fire him on Aug. 23, 1978.
"Further speculation that my limited involvement with Ted
Kaczynski somehow resulted in the acts of terrorism attributed to
him would be grossly unfair," she said, adding that the first bomb
from the Unabomber was sent "almost a month before I ever met
Ted Kaczynski."
Kaczynski, 53, was arrested April 3 at his Montana mountain
cabin. He is jailed in Helena, charged only with possession of
bomb components and not with any of the Unabomber attacks,
which killed three people and injured 23 in nine states.
Kaczynski's court-appointed lawyer, Michael Donahoe,
claimed that a flood of leaks from unnamed federal sources has
"poisoned the entire population of grand juries within the United
States against Mr. Kaczynski."
New planet discovered?
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — For the fourth time in six months,
a team of astronomers has found a planet orbiting a star about 30
light-years from Earth.
The San Francisco State University astronomers found the
planet after surveying about 100 stars. The planet has a mass
about 80 percent that of Jupiter. It is 9 million miles from its star
and travels around it every 14.76 days.
The discovery was the fourth time in six months that Geoffrey
Marcy, Paul Butler and a group of San Francisco State students
have found a planet-and-star combination.
David Black, director of Houston's Lunar and Planetary Insti
tute, said he isn't convinced that the latest find is a planet. He
said the astronomers are basing their find on old calculation stan
dards that many scientists now feel are questionable.
