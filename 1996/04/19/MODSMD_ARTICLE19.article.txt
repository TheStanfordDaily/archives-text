## Welcome to the Farm 
### 
Here's why this year's
admits should join the
Stanford Class of 2000

FIRST OF ALL, congratula
tions. Only 15.8 percent of
applicants to Stanford were
mailed that magic package this
year — and those 2,580 prospec
tive freshmen from all over the
country and the world have a won
derful opportunity in front of
them.
Of course, you have to make the
big decision first. That's why, we
assume, many of you came to visit
the Farm this weekend. We know
you are going to have a great time
as pro fros (please do not use the
title "Stanford Admit Week
ender") but we also know that
some of you are still weighing
your options.
Here's why you should go to
Stanford:
• The weather: Don't say you
haven't noticed. It's beautiful
here. Sure, there's always the pos
sibility of some rain and the tem
perature sometimes falls into the
50s — but at least we can guaran
tee that you will never have to
trudge to class in snow. (Try to get
that kind of promise from the
Harvard Crimson).
And for those of you who appre
ciate the occasional snow flake, no
worries — Tahoe and all the snow
you could want are just a few
hours away. And the beach is just
a short trip in the other direction.
Start thinking about those dorm
trips next year.
• The people: They're nice.
Stanford students are all extreme
ly intelligent, but most of us are
also down-to-earth and relaxed.
We like to work, but we like to
have fun, too. It's all part of the
Stanford experience. Although we
study hard, Stanford doesn't suf
fer from the cutthroat competitive
environment that you find at

some other schools.
• The location: We're in Califor
nia, for pete's sake. Okay, some of
you East Coasters might be a bit
skittish about things like earth
quakes, floods and fires, but you
can't argue with the statement
that it's the most exciting state in
the Union.
Stanford is less than an hour
away from San Francisco, a city
that everyone should at least
agree is . . . interesting. Don't for
get you can catch a train up to the
City at a station right near cam
pus. Plus, we're far enough away
from Berkeley to be safe from
catching that Weenie disease.
More generally, Stanford's Cali
fornia location places it on the
edge of the most dynamic area in
the world — the Pacific Rim.
Believe us, the world is changing
fast, and Stanford is poised to
right move along with it. Don't
even try to argue that New Jersey
is where the action is nowadays.
• Campus life: To provide a
common freshman experience
you'll spend your first year in a
dorm, but after that you'll have
lots of options — the Greek sys
tem, small houses and co-ops,
suites and, of course, more dorms.
There's always something to do
on the Farm, ranging from sport
ing events to all-campus parties to
hanging out at the CoHo (ask a
student about what that means).
Plus, Stanford's campus is very
safe — at what other school is
bicycle theft the most common
crime?
The only thing East Coast
schools have on us is age and tra
dition. If you want to live in dilap
idated dorms at a school that
brags about the fact that it pro
duced 10 presidents, go for it. But
if you want to be a part of a tradi
tion of great academics combined
with stellar athletic and extracur
ricular activities, check yes and
mail in that letter to Dean Mon
toya today. Better yet, go to Old
Union right now and tell him in
person.
You won't regret it.
