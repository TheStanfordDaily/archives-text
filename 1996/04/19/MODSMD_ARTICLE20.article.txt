Sorority members do not embody 'farcical feminism 9

IN MICHAEL GREEN'S column ear
lier this week, he charged that there
are "two camps" of women on cam
pus — pitting the Women's Center
against sororities which he says falsely
claim to uphold feminist principles. He
found the ultimate illustration in the
fact that the women's leadership confer
ence coincided with Sorority Rush.
"Where were you?" he asks Stanford
women. Since one of us organized last
year's leadership conference and the
other is a member of the Feminist Stud
ies Program Board, we found the ques
tion particularly ironic. Are we part of
Green's "truer Stanford sisterhood" for
our involvement? Or are we in the camp
of those "farcical feminists" because we
proudly wear our Greek letters?
Last weekend's leadership conference
was a success, a tradition continued this
year by the hard work of two dedicated
women. The fact that the conference
and Rush dates coincided was unfortu
nate, a sentiment shared both by this
year's organizers and sorority members
alike. One of the organizers herself
expressed regret because the dates could

not be changed, and the weekend choice
would see decreased attendance at the
conference (because so many involved
women are in sororities — or would be
Rushing), including the fact that some
of her best friends would not be able to
attend.
Yet rather than illustrating the divid
ing lines of feminists and non-feminists,
the conference-Rush conflict does point
out a shortfall in women's organizing on
campus: a lack of communication and
coordination. Women are working on a
flurry of different activities; this
month's Herstory is a prime example.
Unfortunately as organizers we don't
always communicate, both in terms of
supporting each other's projects and
coordinating our efforts.
Yet are sororities by definition anti
feminist orgar. izations? Sororities, like
numerous other women's organizations,
are undergoing a process of self-evalua
tion, changing in response to women's
needs, desires and self-awareness. Just
as Daily columnists and others challenge
us to defend our "real" actions, so do we
continue to question and redefine the

interests and goals of our organizations.
I know that my chapter has struggled to
incorporate issues of religious tolerance
into traditional ceremonies, something
unheard of 20 years ago. And we are
changing and redefining our community
service project to create one addressing
women's issues, because that's where
our chapter wants to focus its attention
and energy.
Perhaps Green is right on target —
sororities for us are a social network:
one of incredible women. Our chapter
includes organizers of the Body Image
and Awareness Group, the president of
the Jewish Student Association, Coun
terpoint singers and the editor of Worn
enspeak. Involved women coming
together, offering each other opportuni
ties for activism. Both sorority members
and non-members alike are beginning to
recognize and take advantage of the
incredible mobilizing potential of sorori
ties, for women's health day or funding
self-defense workshops.
We as sororities still face the continu
ing need to question and overhaul struc
tures and prejudices we have inherited.

Yet ultimately we, like all women, strug
gle with expressing sexuality and ideas
about women and power and overcoming
obstacles. Unfortunately Rush and the
women's leadership conference over
lapped last weekend. Yet why do we
have to justify a scheduling mistake?
Perhaps the real problem with femi
nism here at Stanford is not that there
exists a dichotomy between sororities
and organizations housed at the
Women's Center, but that many people,
men and women included, are engaged
in the destructive categorization of who
and what a feminist can and cannot be.
Feminism exists in many forms, and
while sometimes we might lack needed
communication, women on campus are
not divided into "two camps," but rather
are busily working toward a better com
mon future, a Stanford sisterhood which
includes sorority and non-sorority mem
bers alike.
