## Is colorblindness possible ? 
### 
CAN WE HAVE a colorblind soci
ety? Sometimes I wonder. There is
so much inflammatory rhetoric
which forces us to look at each other in
terms of skin color and view each other as
soldiers from different armed camps that
it doesn't seem colorblindness will hap
pen anytime soon.
I try to be colorblind. In fact, it isn't so
much an effort I must make as a compo
nent of my thought process — or perhaps
it would be better to say a missing com
ponent of my thought process. For the
most part, I do not think of people I know
in terms of their color. After all, how
much sense would that make?
I hadn't realized my colorblindness
until one Thanksgiving when I invited a
friend to share dinner. Beth dined with
the family, and we all had a wonderful
time. After she left, my mother com
mented to me, "You didn't tell me Beth
was white." This was not an accusation,
though clearly it indicated my mother's
surprise. I paused before answering, "It
never occurred to me."
And it hadn't. That made me consider
how I thought about my friends. Their
race was never the first characteristic
that popped into my head, if I considered
it at all.
Eventually I got to wondering about
other people's capacity for colorblind
ness. We all hear stories about people
who say my Black friend, my Puerto
Rican friend, my Chinese friend. Are they

true? Do people define people they know
by race?
I questioned mostly non-minorities I
knew in an effort to find a personal
answer. What I found was there weren't
many people who had thought about it
much. Most assumed they were already
colorblind. My informal survey consisted
of two questions: how would you describe
me to someone who was probably never
going to meet me, and when you think
about me, what are the first things that
come to mind?
Answers to the first question invari
ably began with a designation of my race.
I had to ask why, as it would not occur to
me to describe a friend as "white female"
or "Chinese male" unless it were impor
tant contextually or for visual identifica
tion. Most people were unable to reason
more than it was just the first thing they
thought about me — it's what stands out,
it was what they thought others should
know, so others could get a mental pic
ture.
The second question took the external
element out, removed the excuse of hav
ing to create an image for someone else.
So I thought the answers might be differ
ent, but they weren't. It surprised me,
because these were people who knew me
fairly well. I didn't spring these questions
on near strangers. Why should the over
riding image these people have of me be
my race, and what did it mean about our
interactions?

Fortunately, there were encouraging
responses. One friend went on at length,
and at the end of his descriptions, I asked
if he realized what he'd left out. He was
unable to figure it out; I had to point out
that he didn't mention that I was black.
(He is not black.)
Another friend whom I hadn't asked
the questions remarked on a ski trip that
if I didn't want to get on the ski lift (I'm
afraid of heights) that I could sit some
where and work on my tan since the
weather was so warm. I laughed as I point
ed out I've been working on my tan for
years, but a little more sunshine wouldn't
hurt. I was pleased he was able to make
that comment because it didn't occur to
him that he needed to run it through the
race filter. Race wasn't the primary char
acteristic he associated with me.
Will we ever reach a colorblind society?
Not as long as we keep stuffing people
into boxes and pasting labels on them. If
I have to be boxed and labeled, I want my
label to read, "Caution: contents of this
box are not necessarily accurately repre
sented by the labels on the outside. No
liability lies within for any assumptions,
which are the sole responsibility of the
person making the assumption. Open at
your own risk."

Pamela has never been stuffed into a box.
