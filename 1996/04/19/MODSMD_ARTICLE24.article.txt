# Allison Amend: The better part of valor
## The
						bittersweet celebrity of a Daily columnist 
### 
DON'T LOOK AT me like that.
Don't smile like I've told you a
secret or you've read my mail or
slept with me. Because you haven't.
You've read me, maybe. Seen my pic
ture grace this page (if I may be so bold,
so congratulatory) on Fridays. Seen me
linger on your kitchen table, in your
lounge, on the floor next to your desk
until Monday's paper replaces me as a
child's forgotten toy.
What do you know about me? I meet
you now, at the Coffee House or at the
movies in Mountain View or at Arrillaga,
and you say, "You look familiar" or "I
think we've already met." Some of you
who are more in tune with your feelings,
who have better memories say, "Hey,
don't you write for The Daily?"
And then I shrug, or I'm supposed to,
and smile with my lips pursed and look
around for eavesdroppers and blush, just
slightly, and say "Yes, actually, I do."
"Oh," you nod and tell me that you're
sorry about my grandmother or that you
hate bureaucracy as well or that Chili's
drives you crazy. And I say thank you if
I'm feeling arrogant or dismissive and I
drink my beer or lift my barbell or go in
to see the movie.

Or you seek me out. You phone me
with marriage proposals, praise and
complaints. You e-mail me call numbers
of books you think I should read, invite
me to your birthday party, warn me that
smoking is bad for my health. Thank you
for your input.
I can talk about you this way, and I
can poke fun and lump you into cate
gories because it is not me you meet. I
don't read your e-mail messages. It is not
I who calls you back at the number
you've left on my voice mail.
It may be my likeness and my name
that hover above this page, but please
don't think it's me. Do you believe every
thing you read?
After all, this column is nothing but
words. I have lots of them; I choose some
to appear in ink on this page. There are
many left over. Some of them are mine
and mine alone ("post-coitusly" and
"issue-probs" spring to mind as unique
creations) but most of them are public
property — you can use them too; in fact,
you're welcome to 'em.
The events they relate are fiction, and
are as public as the letters Big Bird
hawks on Sesame Street. I hate to break
it to you all, but I don't own any Parker

pens. I don't really need those four units
to graduate. I don't have an aunt named
Sadie. I'm fond of Palo Alto. And,(I know
this will come as a shock to all of those
puffers I see huddled around smoke
proofed buildings) / don't even smoke.
You're shocked. You feel betrayed.
You're angry at me now and throw the
paper down in disgust. You think I lied to
you.
But don't we all misrepresent our
selves a little every day? Are you the
same person to your parents that you are
to your friends, your employers, your
lovers? We adjust, we morph, we change,
ever so slightly, to encounter different
elements. We create different masks to
survive the day.
This metamorphosis is especially
applicable to writing. Don't try to tell me
St. Augustine didn't leave anything out
of his autobiography. Saint or no saint,
his pear tree is as much as literary device
as my use of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Rousseau's "Confessions" left out the
intermediary steps, the logical leaps that
lead to philosophical dead ends. Can we
say with any confidence that Rimbaud's
poetic "I" is really him? His "Je est un
autre" hints at the disparity between

written representation and a shifting
and shifty reality.
Literature, even criticism or history,
is entertainment. It's fabrication, exag
geration, falsification. Writers fudge
details for symmetry or parallelism. We
invent to capture interest. We sacrifice
meaning for alliteration or wit. I'm as
guilty as Montaigne, as Locke or Lao
Tsu. We are subjective, selective. You all
went through CIV; you know what I'm
talking about.
So this Allison Amend you feel per
mitted to attack or compliment or scoff
at or ignore, is this really me? I certainly
hope not. Cynical, dispassionate,
despairing, snobby, self-acclaiming, pre
tentious, self-involved, pedantic, ver
bose, inflated . . . this is not who I see
when I look in the mirror. This is the
meta-me, the flip-side of my existence,
my evil twin from daytime television.
The "writing me" is another level of my
existence, related to, but distant from,
the quotidian me.
On the other hand, I'd like to be this
person — witty, with the gift of the gab,
easily turning traumatic experiences
into funny anecdotes, confident enough
to share personal dilemmas and existen

tial angst with 25,000 people. My envy
notwithstanding, I am not she.
However, I do sign my name to this
space on Fridays. I pretend I am Allison,
I profess a viewpoint, share it, expunge it,
spew it at you, and you as a reader ingest
or reject it. In some small way I am visi
ble through the ink, peeking out between
the lines, if only because I am the one
who chose this particular combination of
letters. The mystery, not the challenge, is
where I end and the writing me begins.
Please don't try to figure it out, it's
not a whodunit. Don't pee in public
places to "get into" my column. Don't
analyze the prose for signs of recent
influences. Don't think it's you when I
address you. And please, above all, don't
think it's me when I say it's me. Just read
it through, cut it out if you like it, laugh
if it's funny, pass it on if you think some
one else might like to read it, even give
me PVF (positive verbal feedback) if you
run into me. I'll pass it on to the writing
me, who likes to hear compliments. But
please, I beg you, don't believe everything
you read. It's a dangerous habit.
