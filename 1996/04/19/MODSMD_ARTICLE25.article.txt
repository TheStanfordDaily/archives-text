# Profs win Guggenheim awards

Two Stanford professors cap
tured the prestigious Guggenheim
Fellowships last week in honor of
their contributions to academia.
Physics Prof. Steve Chu and
Mathematics Prof. Richard Schoen
each won one of 158 fellowships
awarded nationally. Every fellow
ship carries a $28,000 stipend to
honor past achievements and fund
further research.
Chu was recognized for his stud
ies of atomic-force microscopy of en
zyme motion, a method for deter
mining the atomic shape of mole
cules.
Described by Chu as a form of ad
vanced Braille, atomic force mi
croscopy uses lasers to trace the
"bumps" of a molecule, such as the
biological enzymes found on DNA
compounds.
With the award, Chu plans to fur
ther develop this process to be able to
scan the biological "motors" of work
ing enzymes.
"In the two quarters of sabbati
cal I plan to take next year, I want to

discover some clever ways of using
these lasers in water to observe the
molecules in action." Chu said.

Stanford faculty
members have gar
nered 12 fellowships
in the past four
years.

Chu has not decided if he will use
the money for part of his sabbatical
salary or for materials and supplies
for his research.
Upon receiving the reward, the
modest Chu "did not have much of a
reaction," he said.
"It would not have been heart
breaking if I didn't get it," Chu
said.
However, when asked if he ex
pected to receive the fellowship, Chu
joked, "Yes â€” is that a wrong thing
to say?"
Schoen was honored for his
work in geometric analysis, a field
incorporating different aspects of

differential geometry.
"My work generally involves con
structing optimal geometric shapes
for use in such fields as general rela
tivity," Schoen said.
Schoen plans to use the stipend to
supplement his sabbatical salary
when he temporarily leaves the Uni
versity next year.
"The money will help out for trips
I plan to take next year to Hong
Kong, Boston to visit Harvard and
Salt Lake City," Schoen said.
All these trips will be research-re
lated, Schoen added.
The Guggenheim Fellows in
clude poets, painters, choreogra
phers, physical and biological sci
entists, social scientists and
scholars in the humanities. Most
recipients have appointments at
American universities, although
some have no academic affilia
tion.
These recipients were selected
from an applicant pool of 2,791 to
share awards totaling $4.5 mil
lion.
Sta iford 112: culty members have
garnered 12 fellowships in the past
four years.
