# 10 poets and fiction writers chosen for two-year program
## Stegner Fellows announced 
### Angel Flores 
Ten poets and fiction writers
have been awarded Stegner Fellow
ships for 1996 by the Stanford Cre
ative Writing Program.
The writers selected are poets
Susan Phillips Hutton, Joy Katz,
Davis McCombs, Leigh Palmer and
Katherine Whitcomb-Nelson. The
five selected fiction writers are
Jason Brown, Michael Byers, Eddie
Chuculate, Goldberry Long and
Ryan Harty.
The winners were selected from
pools of 650 for fiction writing and
400 for poetry.
"These writers are granted two
serious years of concentration on
their art," said English Prof. Eliza
beth Tallent, the program's direc
tor.
The two-year fellowships,
awarded only to five poets and five
fiction writers, offer tuition and a
living stipend of $15,000 annually.
They also provide the structure and
support of writing workshops

which meet twice a week.
Each year one or two of the Steg
ner Fellows are chosen to be one of
the six Jones Lecturers, a position
which requires staying at Stanford
to teach classes for three years.
"The 10 selected writers are
working artists who can also teach
undergraduates," said Gay Pierce,
the program administrator for the
English Department.
The writers selected for the fel
lowship are what the program con
siders to be the best writers in the
world. Prominent writers who have
spent time at Stanford through the
fellowship include fiction writers
Raymond Carver, Ken Kesey, Scott
Turow, Larry McMurtry, Tillie
Olsen and Tobias Wolff and poets
Donald Hall, Donald Justice and
Robert Pinsky.
"I applied for this fellowship be
cause it has a strong reputation,
and it is a great opportunity to work
with first-rate writers," said Katz,
who is currently at Washington
University in St. Louis finishing

her master of fine arts degree.
In applying for the fellowship,
applicants said they also felt it was
important that the program lasts
two years.
"Two years to have great teach
ers and spend time writing is a
chance that you don't get much,"
said Byers, who plans to write a
novel and finish a book of essays
during his stay at Stanford.
To apply for the fellowship, a col
lege degree is not necessary. Selec
tions are based on the quality of the
applicant's manuscript. Two mzy'or
features that are desired from the
applicant are the ability to commit
to the workshop process and to con
tribute to it.
This year more than 1,000 writ
ers from the United States, Cana
da, Europe, India, Korea and West
Africa applied for the fellowship.
"This is the most wonderful
thing that could happen to a writer
at the most crucial moment in their
career," said Tallent. "There is noth
ing like this program in the world."
