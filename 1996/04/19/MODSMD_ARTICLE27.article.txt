## Baseball heads to Tucson for a three-game set 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
After the Stanford baseball team was
swept at home by USC in March, the team
proceeded to win eight of its next nine con
tests and nine of its next 12.
Riding that success, the Cardinal arrived in
Los Angeles last weekend and got swept aside
once again by the Trojans, who have risen to
No. 2 in the nation.
Head coach Mark Marquess and his No. 18-
ranked Stanford baseball team hope to em
bark upon another winning streak this week
end following the disappointment of last
week. On Tuesday night at Sunken Diamond,
Marquess' club took a step in the right direc
tion, defeating Sacramento State by a score of
4-3.
Stanford (24-17, 10-11 in the Pacific 10
Southern Division) will travel to Arizona (22-
24, 6-15) today through Sunday and will be
looking to collect three conference wins at the
expense of the cellar-dwelling Wildcats. Earli
er this season, the Cardinal earned its only se
ries sweep of the year against Arizona, win
ning 14-2, 7- 6 and 16-3 at Sunken Diamond.
In that series, Stanford enjoyed timely hit
ting and strong pitching from its starting ro
tation. Senior A.J. Hinch scorched the Wild
cats' pitching, going 9-for-14 (.643) with two
doubles, two home runs and six RBIs. Fresh
man center fielder Jody Gerut was also im
pressive with the stick, blasting two home
runs and tallying nine RBIs on seven hits.
First baseman Luke Quaccia and right fielder
Joe Kilburg pitched in six hits apiece, as the
Cardinal offense exploded for 37 runs in three
games.
While the batsmen put the runs on the
board, the pitchers also did their part in keep
ing Arizona out of the win column. Coach
Marquess got strong outings from his rota
tion as Kyle Peterson (7 1/3 innings), Jeff
Austin (7 innings) and Chad Hutchinson
(complete game) gave the bullpen a chance to
rest.
In one of his best outings of the year, Pe
terson punched out 11 Wildcats via the strike
out and allowed eight hits and no earned runs
while walking only three. Hutchinson kept
the Arizona lineup off-balance all afternoon,
striking out eight en route to wrapping up the
series sweep.
Despite the troubles experienced by the
Wildcats this year, Hinch and his teammates
are wary of Arizona, which took two of three
from second-place UCLA last weekend.
"They are obviously a good team," Hinch
said, referring to Arizona's recent success
against the Bruins. "They are playing a spoil
er role now, as they face the better teams in
the [Six-Pac]."
With nine games left on the conference
schedule, the Cardinal finds itself in third
place, four games behind second-place UCLA
and just one game ahead of Arizona State.
"This series is huge," said Peterson, who will
start in tonight's contest. "After last weekend,
they will be confident. We know the importance
of this series, and in all honesty, if we don't sweep
them, we'll be disappointed."

After being named last year's
National Freshman of the Year,
Peterson (5-5) struggled a bit
early this season, but has come
on strong as of late, winning
three of his last four decisions.

Peterson attributes some of the
success to the addition of a slider
to his pitch repertoire.
"I feel good again and my arm
is live," Peterson said. "I haven't
been throwing the curve for
strikes, but I've been throwing a
slider and I'm trying to get it to
be a successful pitch for me."
Catching Peterson's pitches
will be Hinch, an All-American
backstop who was forced into a
designated hitter role while he
recovered from a shoulder injury
that limited his throwing ability.
Hinch returned to the defensive
lineup last Tuesday against San
Jose State and has been feeling
good behind the plate.
"Everything is back to normal
and it feels real good to be back in
there," Hinch said. "My arm
feels good and I've been throwing
well in practice."
While it feels good to have
Hinch back on the field, the Car
dinal knows that picking up some
wins would feel even better.
"We've got to get back on the
winning track in the Pac," Hinch
said. "We need to take control of
the rest of the season by playing
better baseball. We want to get
on a hot streak going into the
postseason."
If the Cardinal's going to get
hot, the Tucson desert is as good
a place as any to get started.
