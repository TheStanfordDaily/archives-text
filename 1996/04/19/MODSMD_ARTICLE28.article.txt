# Cardinal spikers have eyes on the prize
## Volleyball opens MPSF playoffs tomorrow versus UC-Santa Barbara 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
Having survived an adverse season filied with in
juries, inconsistent play and one long losing streak, the
fifth-ranked Stanford men's volleyball team has itself a
clean slate once again.
After finishing third in the Pacific Division of the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation with a 12-7 record,
the Cardinal spikers start anew tomorrow night in the
league's postseason tournament, squaring off against
the fourth-ranked Gauchos of UC-Santa Barbara in a
first-round road game.
This weekend marks the start of the eight-team
Powerßar MPSF Championship tournament, which de
termines the West Coast representative in the Final
Four. There will also be an automatic qualifier from both
the Midwest and the East. That leaves just one at-large
bid, which the NCAA selection committee will award to
the most deserving non-qualifier.
Stanford feels it needs to win this tournament be
cause its chances for the at-large bid are slim at best. With
top-ranked Hawaii also in the tournament, it would ap
pear that the Rainbows will make their way into the
NCAA championships regardless of how far they ad
vance in the tournament. Still, Stanford feels it has as
good a chance as anyone.
"That's the beauty of the playoffs," said Stanford
head coach Ruben Nieves. "Once you get in, it means
we're only three wins away from the Final Four. We're
underdogs, but we can do it."
Stanford heads into the tournament as one of the
more experienced teams in the field. It is also looking to
improve on last year's first-round collapse against BYU,
in which the Cardinal held a two-game lead on its home
floor, only to see the Cougars storm back.
"Ijast season was veiy disappointing," Nieves said.
The team has been more focused this week in practice,
as well as more healthy. Junior middle blocker Brian
Moore has gotten through practice in good shape, and ju
nior Matt Fuerbringer's groin injury is a thing of the
past. Meanwhile, sophomore swing hitter Devin Pool
man has recovered from his ankle sprain and will be
ready to contribute on Saturday.
"(The team has] been practicing well, and playing
well. We're in a real good position to play this playoff
match," Nieves said.
Riding the momentum of a seven-match winning
streak, the Gauchos are tiying to qualify for the Final
Four for the first time in eight seasons. After several suc
cessive mediocre seasons, UCSB bounced back this sea
son with a 14-5 league mark and a No. 4 ranking in the
national polls. Among their victories is a three-game
sweep of the Cardinal on Feb. 25, a game Moore sat out.
"A lot has happened since then," Nieves said. "I
wouldn't put too much weight on that game."
UCSB is one of the better ball-control teams in the
country, ranking sixth in hitting percentage at .337. The
Gauchos are led by sophomore opposite hitter Jeremy
Darner, who had 20 kills in the previous meeting, while
senior setter Todd Rodgers averages nearly 17 assists per
game — good for third in the countiy.
"They've shown [themselves] to be one of the best dig
ging teams and one of the better defensive teams in the
league," Nieves said. "We'll probably try to counter that
with our strong hitting and net play."
Strategy aside, the showdown with the Gauchos is
probably the most up-for-grabs matchup of the weekend.
"It's just a matter of who seizes the opportunity. There
will be pressure on both teams," Nieves said. "We're just
tryingto be as good as we can be and put together a strong
performance for Saturday."
Nieves also likes the idea of placing UCSB under pres
sure. "With Santa Barbara, the closer the games, the
more to our advantage. We are also undefeated in fifth
pime situations, while they're only 1-3.1 like our chances
if we get there, knowing we have the knowledge and con
fidence to come through in tough situations."
