# Women looking to repeat success
## Cardinal will try to duplicate sweep of USC, UCLA this weekend 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Fresh off of a 6-0 sweep of Cali
fornia on Wednesday, the No. 2-

ranked Stanford women's tennis
squad takes to the courts at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium twice this
weekend for Pacific 10 Conference
clashes against No. 19 USC and

No. 5 UCLA.
The Cardinal (20-1 overall, 8-0
Pac-10) has won 11 straight
matches. With a victory today,
Stanford will clinch its ninth con
secutive Pac-10 crown.
But the Cardinal is not looking
to split this weekend. Head coach
Frank Brennan and Co. have not
dropped a conference match in 22
attempts. With a sweep this week
end, Stanford would match last
year's perfect 10-0 conference
record.
It was just two weeks ago that
the Cardinal took Los Angeles by
storm, beating the Bruins and
Trojans by identical 6-2 scores.
Since then, the Cardinal has won
three additional dual matches,
highlighted by a tough road win at
No. 4 Arizona.
The Cardinal shook off an ex
tremely slow start in its match
against UCLA on April 5. The
Bruins (16-4, 5-3) took a one-set
lead in all but one of the first six
singles matches, but the experi
enced Cardinal clawed its way
back into each of those matches
and took a 4-2 lead into doubles
competition.
"[UCLA was] pretty demoral
ized by the end," said Brennan of
the match in Los Angeles. "They'll
either say, 'We lost to these guys
three times last year and lost it
again just now. We just can't get
it.' Or they can come up here and
say, 'We were right there.' "
Singles play was highlighted by
a three-set comeback win by
sophomore Ania Bleszynski (15-6)
who notched the biggest victory of
her young career over defending
NCAA singles champion and
Southern California rival Keri
Phebus.
