# Women looking to repeat success
## Cardinal will try to duplicate sweep of USC, UCLA this weekend 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Fresh off of a 6-0 sweep of Cali
fornia on Wednesday, the No. 2-

ranked Stanford women's tennis
squad takes to the courts at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium twice this
weekend for Pacific 10 Conference
clashes against No. 19 USC and

No. 5 UCLA.
The Cardinal (20-1 overall, 8-0
Pac-10) has won 11 straight
matches. With a victory today,
Stanford will clinch its ninth con
secutive Pac-10 crown.
But the Cardinal is not looking
to split this weekend. Head coach
Frank Brennan and Co. have not
dropped a conference match in 22
attempts. With a sweep this week
end, Stanford would match last
year's perfect 10-0 conference
record.
It was just two weeks ago that
the Cardinal took Los Angeles by
storm, beating the Bruins and
Trojans by identical 6-2 scores.
Since then, the Cardinal has won
three additional dual matches,
highlighted by a tough road win at
No. 4 Arizona.
The Cardinal shook off an ex
tremely slow start in its match
against UCLA on April 5. The
Bruins (16-4, 5-3) took a one-set
lead in all but one of the first six
singles matches, but the experi
enced Cardinal clawed its way
back into each of those matches
and took a 4-2 lead into doubles
competition.
"[UCLA was] pretty demoral
ized by the end," said Brennan of
the match in Los Angeles. "They'll
either say, 'We lost to these guys
three times last year and lost it
again just now. We just can't get
it.' Or they can come up here and
say, 'We were right there.' "
Singles play was highlighted by
a three-set comeback win by
sophomore Ania Bleszynski (15-6)
who notched the biggest victory of
her young career over defending
NCAA singles champion and
Southern California rival Keri
Phebus.

Junior Sandra De Silva gets low for a forehand during her 6-3,6-0 win
over Cal's Stephanie Tibbits on Wednesday.
Also in singles, redshirt senior
Amy Chiminello (18-1) fought off
two match points in the third set
to come back and win her match at
the No. 6 position.
Seeking revenge on Saturday
against the Bruins will be Cardi
naljunior Katie Schlukebir (16-4),
who dropped her match at the No.
2 position to Bruin Paige
Yaroshuk.
Schlukebir and Bleszynski (9-
3) clinched the victory for Stan
ford in doubles play. The No. 2-
ranked doubles pair in the nation
defeated Phebus and Yaroshuk
convincingly in straight sets.
"I think our doubles looks real
good," Brennan said. "I feel good

going into doubles, even if we're at
3-3."
The Bruins' four losses have all
come at the hands of teams ranked
in the nation's top four. No. 1
Florida defeated them at the Na
tional Team Indoor Champi
onships, Arizona beat them twice
in Pac-10 competition and Stan
ford handed UCLA its fourth loss.
"They're a very scary team,"
Brennan. "They're real scary.
They have probably the best play
er in the country in Phebus and a
great No. 3 in [Stephanie] Chi.
Sandra's going to have her hands
full."
Brennan also cited an addition
al psychological advantage since
the Cardinal victory was just two
weeks ago.
"It's not like anything has
changed," Brennan said. "If the
matches had been earlier, they

might have new players returning
from injury or something, but we
just saw them."
Meanwhile, today's opponent
— 19th-ranked USC (12-7,3-5) —
has beaten just Cal (8-12, 1-7) and
Arizona State (10-9, 1-9) in the
conference. In their match against
the Cardinal on April 6 in Los An
geles, the Trojans were virtually
out of the match before they knew
what hit them.
Cardinal singles competitors
jumped out to a 5-1 lead, winning
all five of those matches in
straight sets. Bleszynski and
Schlukebir again clinched the
match at the No. 1 doubles spot.
Most recently, the Trojans and
Bruins squared off against each
other in a cross-town duel, with
the Bruins winning for the second
time this season, 6-3.
