### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
In a dramatic sweep of re
form that will drastically change
the way the ASSU operates, vot
ers scrapped the ASSU's 27-
year-old constitution for a new
one and tossed out its four-per
son Council of Presidents in
favor of a single president.
"Constitution '96" passed
last night by an overwhelming
margin and the COP slate "I
Prefer To Have a Single Presi
dent" emerged victorious by 43
votes.
"This election proves that
students want a single presi
dent," said senior Michael Slem
mer, the author of the new con
stitution. "Beyond a doubt, a
single president is what stu
dents want and that's what they
got."
"Constitution '96" will put a
single president in charge of the

ASSU's executive arm, create a
judicial branch, reduce the size
of the senate from 40 to 30 and
grant all senators voting power.
The new constitution will go
into effect as soon as University
President Gerhard Casper rati
fies it, Slemmer said.
Defeating three other COP
slates, sophomore Steven Liu
and freshmen David Guendel
man, Joe Pawson and Peter
Vlastelica of "I Prefer To Have a
Single President" said they are
poised to pressure the adminis
tration to ratify "Constitution
'96" as quickly as possible so
they can proceed with the spe
cial election they said they will
hold in order to name next
year's ASSU president. Once
the students elect a president,
members of the slate said they
will step down.
"This election is not an end,"
