# 'Constitution '96' overwhelmingly passes; 'I Prefer' COP slate wins by 43 votes
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
In a dramatic sweep of re
form that will drastically change
the way the ASSU operates, vot
ers scrapped the ASSU's 27-
year-old constitution for a new
one and tossed out its four-per
son Council of Presidents in
favor of a single president.
"Constitution '96" passed
last night by an overwhelming
margin and the COP slate "I
Prefer To Have a Single Presi
dent" emerged victorious by 43
votes.
"This election proves that
students want a single presi
dent," said senior Michael Slem
mer, the author of the new con
stitution. "Beyond a doubt, a
single president is what stu
dents want and that's what they
got."
"Constitution '96" will put a
single president in charge of the

ASSU's executive arm, create a
judicial branch, reduce the size
of the senate from 40 to 30 and
grant all senators voting power.
The new constitution will go
into effect as soon as University
President Gerhard Casper rati
fies it, Slemmer said.
Defeating three other COP
slates, sophomore Steven Liu
and freshmen David Guendel
man, Joe Pawson and Peter
Vlastelica of "I Prefer To Have a
Single President" said they are
poised to pressure the adminis
tration to ratify "Constitution
'96" as quickly as possible so
they can proceed with the spe
cial election they said they will
hold in order to name next
year's ASSU president. Once
the students elect a president,
members of the slate said they
will step down.
"This election is not an end,"

voting system, students rank their
choices for COP with the least vote
getting slate thrown out each
round and its votes redistributed.

Pawson said. "It's only the begin

Thanking voters for "bringing
Stanford's student government up
to par with all other major Ameri
can universities," Liu said he and
his fellow slate members are com
mitted to putting their plans into
effect as soon as possible.
Slate members and Students'
Alliance party members said their
top choice for a single president
candidate is sophomore Ben Deck
er, who ran on the independent
slate "For Real" which won the
most first place votes in the first
round, but not the majority.
Decker, who did not join fellow
"For Real" members Angela Park
er, Bill Shen and Jason Stephenson
at the ASSU office while votes were
being tallied last night, said, "At
this point, I am happy for 'I Prefer
a Single President.' From the be
ginning, this election has been
about ASSU reform. I think stu
dents have spoken with a clear
voice."
Decker did not say definitively
whether or not he will run for
ASSU president in the special elec
tion that must take place.
"For Real" held the lead until
the 614 votes for the"The Dicta
tors From Space" were redistrib
uted in the third round of preferen

from the victors' election night
party at Kimball Hall, current un
dergraduate senator and graduate
senator-elect Steve Russell said,
"We are making Stanford history.
This started with the founding one
year ago of Students' Alliance to
combat the corruption in the
ASSU."
"Its rise to power is nothing
short of a student revolt against a
myopic and unconcerned student
government. Tonight, it was re
placed by real students, real con
cerns, real leadership. This is a new
era for Stanford students — a new
era for Stanford University," Rus
sell said.
"What this campus needs now is
a healing figure," said undergradu
ate senator and former Students'

Alliance party chair Andr§ Vanier.
"Students need a leader who can
bring Stanford's diverse communi
ties together. I believe the best per
son to be that leader is Ben Deck
er."

'Its rise to power is nothing short of a student

real students, real concerns, real leadership.

Immediately after learning that
his slate, "For Real" had lost by less
than 50 votes, Stephenson said,
"We're proud of our effort. I hope 'I
Prefer to Have a Single President'
can implement all the changes it
has proposed .... I wish them
well."
Members of the graduate slate,
"If I Ran the Zoo" also expressed
concern about the importance of "I
Prefer To Have a Single President"
commitment to following through
with the remaining reforms. "I
hope whoever becomes the single
president takes the job as seriously
as it needs to be taken," Amit
Mehta said.
