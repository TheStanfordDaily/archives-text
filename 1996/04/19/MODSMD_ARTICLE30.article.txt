# Beavers, Ducks up next for softball
## Women hope to reverse their road woes this weekend in Oregon 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
Stanford softball will pack
its bags and head north for the
weekend when it resumes Pa
cific 10 Conference play tomor
row and Sunday with two dou
bleheaders against the Oregon
schools. The Cardinal (22-19
overall, 5-9 Pac-10) will play
two against Oregon State to
morrow at 1 p.m. and another
pair at Oregon on Sunday af
ternoon.
This weekend's games give
Stanford a golden opportunity
to break even at 9-9 in the Pac
-10 with just five more confer
ence teams on the regular-sea
son schedule. In order to do
that, though, the team will
have to put up a 4-0 perfor
mance on the road, something
that hasn't been easy for the
Cardinal thus far this season.

Stanford is well below the .500
mark away from home this sea
son, with a paltry 2-6 road

record in the Pac-10.
