# Beavers, Ducks up next for softball
## Women hope to reverse their road woes this weekend in Oregon 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
Stanford softball will pack
its bags and head north for the
weekend when it resumes Pa
cific 10 Conference play tomor
row and Sunday with two dou
bleheaders against the Oregon
schools. The Cardinal (22-19
overall, 5-9 Pac-10) will play
two against Oregon State to
morrow at 1 p.m. and another
pair at Oregon on Sunday af
ternoon.
This weekend's games give
Stanford a golden opportunity
to break even at 9-9 in the Pac
-10 with just five more confer
ence teams on the regular-sea
son schedule. In order to do
that, though, the team will
have to put up a 4-0 perfor
mance on the road, something
that hasn't been easy for the
Cardinal thus far this season.

Stanford is well below the .500
mark away from home this sea
son, with a paltry 2-6 road

record in the Pac-10.

"We need to take the positive
stuff (from the San Jose State
games] and get it going towards
Oregon," said head coach Sandy
Pearce. "We're looking for four
wins, but we've got to be at the
top of our game."
Keeping the opposition at bay
will be even more difficult if
Stanford freshman Becky
Blevins is unable to play.
Blevins, who recently sustained
an ankle injury, boasts a team
leading 1.29 ERA (which also
ranks her among Pac-10 leaders)
and has started 20 of the Cardi
nal's 41 games this season, rack
ing up eight shutouts, 16 com
plete games and 98 strikeouts.
Illness and injury, however,
have become a major problem
for the Cardinal in recent weeks.
Five regular starters have been
sidelined at some point in the

past month with problems rang
ing from back injuries to strep
throat. And while Stanford's re
serves have been up to the task,
the number of available players
seems to be declining with each
game.
Versatility among the re
maining healthy players has
solved the problem thus far, as
several key players in the lineup
have shifted positions with rela
tive ease in an effort to fill the
void left by missing personnel.
But Blevins' absence may prove
to be the biggest loss for the Car
dinal yet.
In the last meetings between
these teams, Blevins pitched
two one-hitters, losing to Ore
gon 1-0 and defeating Oregon
State by the same score. Blevins'
one-hit loss to the Ducks was the
result of a Stanford error that
allowed an early run in that
game, but the Cardinal defense
is much improved since that se
ries.
"You have to focus on every

play," said sophomore Jessica
Schulman. "I think we've done a
better job of doing that lately."
Driving the Cardinal offense
is freshman Michelle Schneider.
Schneider, who recently missed
three games due to a wrist in
jury, earned the game-winning
RBI single in Stanford's 5-4 vic
tory over San Jose State on
Wednesday and currently has a
team-high .320 batting average.
Effective run production will
be an important factor this
weekend. In their first four
meetings this season, the Cardi
nal managed a total of just five
runs against the Ducks and the
Heavers. But the Stanford bats
have performed significantly
better as of late, averaging more
than five runs a game in the
team's last four outings.
"This weekend is very impor
tant," Schulman said. "Every
game is important. These two
teams are the ones we need to
beat in order to stay in con
tention for a spot at regionals."
