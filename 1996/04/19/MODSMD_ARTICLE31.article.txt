The No. 6-ranked Stanford
women's golf team is gearing up
for the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, to be held in
Tucson, Ariz., beginning Mon

Stanford will take to the
greens for the first time since its
solid showing in the 32nd annual
California Collegiate, a 36-hole
tournament held last weekend on
the friendly fairways of the Stan
ford Golf Course.
The Cardinal shot a combined

600 on its home course, good for a
third-place finish, seven strokes
behind No. 3-ranked Arizona
State and ten strokes off the pace
set by tournament champion and
No. 1-ranked San Jose State.
The Cardinal trailed by just
five strokes after one round of
play, and though it shot four
strokes better in the second
round, the Spartans also im
proved their score by four strokes
on the tourney's final day.
Stanford was led by junior All-
American Mhairi McKay, who
tied for second with a 145, includ
ing a 70 on the last day of play.

McKay's two-day total left her
seven stokes behind the blister
ing 8-under par 138 shot by first
place finisher Vibeke Stensrud of
the Spartans.
A pleasant surprise for the
Cardinal came from theclubhead
of senior Julie Bowen, who fin
ished in fourth place by shooting
a 76 and a 70 for a total score of
146.
Bowen, who plays in the No. 4
spot, said she "knew something
was up" when she was 3-under
par after five holes of play on the
final day. She finished with five
birdies and two bogeys.
"I'm so thrilled for Julie Bowen,"
said Stanford interim head coach
Caroline O'Connor. "The low round
of her life was a phenomenal way to
end her collegiate career on her
