# Using the Web for political power
## 
### Dale Margolin Contributing writer 
Not all Stanford students are using the World
Wide Web to create home pages with family pic
tures and miscellaneous personal information.
Some students are using the Web to increase po
litical awareness.
Last fall, sophomore Jason Burnett, a mem
ber of Students for Environmental Action at
Stanford, created a Web page that seeks to in
volve people in environmental issues. He said he
wants to educate Web users about global, nation
al and local problems and to make it easy for
them to affect legislation.
"The number of e-mail messages is incredible
and has the potential to be highly effective," said
Burnett.
The Web page, called the Environmental E
mailer and located at http://cedar.stanford.edu,
presents users with brief summaries of environ
mental issues, written by Burnett and other
members of SEAS. Users can then fill in their
names and home addresses and whether they
support, oppose or do not have opinions about
each issue. If the users would like to forward
their opinions, they can send them via e-mail to
their state legislators.
According to Burnett, about 24 people read
the page, and 500 to 1,000 messages are sent each
day. Burnett said both Stanford and non-Stan
ford Web users take advantage of the site.
Burnett said he wanted to create the page be

cause he feels that most people don't have time to
research environmental issues and write to legis
lators. "In about 10 to 15 minutes, the Web page
gives users the chance to educate themselves and
send approximately 60 messages to their legisla
tors," Burnett said.
Burnett said grassroots participation is cru
cial because "part of the problem with politics is
that a small group of people have most of the
say."
Burnett said he believes that all the various
ways of contacting legislators are treated equal
ly, and e-mail is taken as seriously as other forms
of communication. He said most representatives
and senators receive only a handful of letters
each day.
"In my opinion, there is no reason to waste
time writing a long letter when in a few minutes
you can send an e-mail message that is just as in
fluential," Burnett said.
In terms of influencing politicians, Burnett
said he has been pleased with the Environmental
E-mailer so far but has one philosophical prob
lem with it: He does not feel that it reaches peo
ple who have the fewest opportunities to affect
legislation.
"The page gets middle-class people who have
computers involved, but they already have a sig
nificant say in government. It is really the people
in East Palo Alto, for example, that I would like
to see writing their opinions," Burnett said.
Eventually, Burnett hopes to figure out a way
of reaching these people. "But right now this is

all we can do," he added.
Burnett's roommate, sophomore Matt Ginz
ton, has played an important role in the project
because he is the computer whiz who helped get
the whole thing started.
"It was originally Jason's idea, but he did not
have that much experience with computers,"
said Ginzton. "Last fall I helped him create the
page, but it has pretty much been running on its
own ever since."
The Environmental E-mailer may function
well on its own, but Burnett is currently updat
ing it to clean out old legislative bills and add new
ones. This summer, Burnett and his collabora
tors hope to stay in the area and work extensive
ly on the page.
Sophomore Adam York, also a member of
SEAS, said he is interested in contacting various
environmental groups to try to get them to work
with the page.
"We would like to network with other organi
zations so we can use their resources," York said.
Already, the Environmental E-mailer has col
laborated with a number of organizations, in
cluding Free the Planet in Washington, D.C.
As Burnett looks toward the future, other
participants in the project praise what the Envi
ronmental E-mailer has accomplished already.
"I think it is pretty amazing that these two
guys have shown such commitment to getting
people involved in environmental issues. It
shows what an effect the World Wide Web can
have," said York.
