# Editor ponders new political landscape

In a speech at the Hoover In
stitution yesterday, William
Kristol, editor and publisher of
the conservative magazine Week
ly Standard, spoke about the his
toric nature of the 1994 Congres
sional elections and the potential
for a realignment of the Ameri
can political landscape.
"An era ended in November
1994," Kristol said. Prior to that,
he said, there was a "general
dominance by the Democratic
Party" for 62 years, going back to
the election of Franklin Roo
sevelt in 1932. During that time
span, the Democrats dominated
legislation and the Republicans
basically reacted, he said.
Despite popular talk of throw
ing the incumbents of both par
ties out, Kristol said, it was an
"extremely partisan election,"
with voters dismissing many De
mocratic incumbents and re
electing virtually all the Republi
can ones.
Before the election Democrats
controlled both houses of Con
gress and the majority of gover
nors' offices and state legisla
tures; Republicans were in that
position after the election, Kris
tol said.
According to Kristol, the exit
polls showed that ideology was
the dominant force in moving
electors to vote conservative. He
said this was due to a conscious
effort by Speaker of the House
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and oth
ers to make ideology central to
the race.
During the election, there was
less crossover voting than usual,
with liberals voting overwhelm
ingly for Democrats and conserv
atives doing likewise for Republi
cans. More conservatives voted,
so the Republicans won, Kristol
said.
Nevertheless, this was a nega
tive vote, "not a great endorse
ment of Republicans" or even
conservatives, Kristol noted. Yet
this was a "potentially realigning
election," Kristol added, explain
ing that all major political shifts
begin with a rejection of the sta
tus quo.
So far, "the verdict is mixed"
with regard to the potential re
alignment, Kristol said. A large
number of Democratic members
of Congress have switched to the
Republican party, and many

have chosen to retire, he noted.
Furthermore, the terms of the
debate have changed, Kristol
said. The Democrats were once
proudly the party in favor of
greater government involve
ment, but now President Clinton
has stated his opposition to big
government and is even consider
ing tax cuts, Kristol said.
Congress' performance in fur
thering the realignment has been
mixed as well, he said. It is not
possible to fundamentally
change public policy from Con
gress alone. Two election victo
ries, one congressional and one
presidential, are needed to do
that, Kristol said.
Understandably Gingrich and
others tried to do what they were
elected for, but they probably
"overreached," he said.
"Letting everything get swal
lowed up by balancing the budget
was a mistake," Kristol said.
Meanwhile, Kristol said, Pres
ident Clinton has been using his
presidency more effectively and
has "thoroughly outclassed his
opponents in Congress" in the
political arena.
"The realignment has stalled
on the Congressional front," he
concluded.
On the presidential front,
Kristol said, "It is not clear that
[presidential candidate Bob Dole]
is able to make a case for himself
as President."
While he said the conventional
view among Washington insiders
is that Dole's support will in
crease and converge towards
Clinton's level, he added that "it
is not obvious to me that this race
will tighten."
"Clinton's really beginning to
solidify his position," Kristol
said.
Dole's choice of a running
mate probably won't make a sig
nificant difference, but if he
chooses Colin Powell and Powell
accepts, it could have a substan
tial impact, Kristol said.
To strengthen their chances
at the polls, Republicans in gen
eral must "inoculate" themselves
against attacks on entitlement is
sues, Kristol said. They must
focus on issues Republicans like
to talk about, such as crime, wel
fare reform and tax cuts, he
added.
Kristol's speech, held in Stauf
fer Auditorium, was the keynote
address at the day-long "Election
'96" conference at Hoover.
