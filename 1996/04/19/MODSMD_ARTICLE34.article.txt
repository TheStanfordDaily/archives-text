# Fac Sen discusses new computer policy
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
Worried about issues of privacy and per
sonal use of University computers, the Fac
ulty Senate discussed the proposed policy on
computer and network usage yesterday.
The policy warns University computer
users "not to abuse the network and re
sources and to respect the privacy and intel
lectual property rights of others" and out
lines acceptable computer uses and the con
sequences of misuse.
Assoc. Biochemistry Prof. Douglas Brut
lag presented the policy to the senate along
with examples of common violations. Discus
sion of the infractions raised questions about
how well any policy can be defined while na
tional and local laws are still in a state of flux.
Some senators and others present at the
meeting expressed concern that several of
the terms in the proposal, such as "privacy"
and "respect," were not better defined. Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper said it may
be necessary to "find our way in practice" be
cause of the increasing uncertainty sur

rounding computer policies.
"We may have to accept that, for a while,
these policies must remain ambiguous,"
Casper said.
Senators questioned the policy's restric
tion on personal use of computer resources,
which currently reads, "University resources
should not be used for personal activities not
related to appropriate University functions,
except in a purely incidental manner."
As a guideline, Brutlag said, faculty
should consider whether a given activity is
part of the University's primary goals of re
search and teaching.
English Prof. John Bender said that at
least in the humanities, faculty members
"who are working on their own time" com
municate with their publishers and deal with
copyrights on personal work when using
Stanford computers and resources.
Brutlag responded that Bender's example
would not be a violation of the policy because
serving as a "creative force as an individual"
contributes to a faculty member's efforts in
research and teaching.
Bender added that using University com

puters for individual work was also an issue
of personal privacy.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said the Univer
sity has been having continuing privacy
problems with e-mail, especially regarding
evaluations of faculty and students.
"We cannot guarantee that their letters
can be kept secret," Rice said. "E-mail cannot
protect a person's confidentiality."
Brutlag said he recommended that the
University install a mechanized system
which would encrypt information, ensuring
that only the intended recipient could read it,
but nothing has been accomplished yet.
In other business, Casper addressed the
recent vandalism in the Asian American Ac
tivities Center. Casper reminded the senate
of a statement issued by Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
condemning the vandalism, and said campus
police have taken measures to secure the cen
ter.
"We want the center to remain as open
and as inviting as possible," Casper said. "It
is the responsibility of a university to educate
in a multiethnic, multiracial manner."
