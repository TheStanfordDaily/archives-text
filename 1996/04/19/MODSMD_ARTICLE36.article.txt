# Approaching Stanford
## 
### 
As the weekend approaches, Spring unfurls
its magnificent munificence in a sweet cel
ebration of life and youth. The sun shines
proudly down on the red and white balloons
swaying gently in the April breeze, and every
seismically reconstructed brown arch and red
roof tile smiles snugly at the pitter-patter of little
unmatriculated feet. And this one is going out to
all you Pro Fro* guys and gals out there.
" Yes — Pro Fro. The use of the official name of
this event (believe me, the worst acronym v 'ever
S.A.W.) will not be Admitted here. In the worst
promotional move since New Coke, our fine Uni
versity has tried to boost its "scholarly" image b\
talcing a vapid verb and making it a noun, which
it is not (check the dictionary).
And so, my prospective brethren and sistern,
let me be the Nth person to welcome you to our
beautiful and bucolic campus, as you retrace the
footsteps we left so many sun-filled days ago.
That's right. Don't let the 153 units and the
fact that I ve kinda sorta declared a major fool
you: I was a Pro Fro once. Oh sure, times were
different back then. In my day, it took us a whole
week to visit campus. And I stayed in a hall called
Stern, at a time when that name still meant
something, and w.is always sure to evoke a
response ("Stern? Damn — I hope you still come
here.' or "Hey, at least you're not in Wilbur!").
Now I realize that some things don't change,
and I don't mean to discount the importance of
the present moment in your lives and the
questions it might raise. After all, maybe you
aren't here just as a formality. Maybe Dean Mon
toya won't personally buy you a special Pro Fro
Fro Yo at the CoPo. Maybe you didn't get a Pres
idential Scholarship and the free BMW and
condo in the Caymans that goes with it ("And
we'll pay off all your student loans, Mitch. The

Farm is like a tight-knit family... ") Maybe you
have issues.
Yes. if in fact you weren't accepted under one of
the seven new Early Admission Decision Contri
tion plans, then this weekend is a time to choose
and these next few hours and days will be
critical.
You see, for every Prospective Frosh, there's
prospective Concern — for every Pro, a Con.
Stanford is a set of situations, and your potential
for success or failure, for fulfillment or disap
pointment, can well be gauged by the way you
approach and react to those you'll encounter this
weekend. Here, very quickly then, are some real
situations reported by real past Pro Fros, with
some potential Pros and Cons. Which one are
you?
1) You are sitting in front of Dormer, waiting to
be picked up by your Pro Fro host. Someone walks
up and asks who you are looking for. You tell
him. "Oh, you're Dave's pro frof" he responds.
"Nice guy. Drinks a lot of beer."
PRO FRO: "Wow, he's a nice guy. And he
drinks a lot of beer!"
CON FRO: "Wait. Is he a nice guy because he
drinks a lot of beer? This just isn't right."
2) So you take the tour. It's 10:49 a.m. as you
approach the clock tower. Two minutes later, a
wave of bikers tears through your group.
PRO FRO "Whoa! I'm, like, totally getting a
hike next year!"
CON FRO: "Hello? I'm walking here! This just
isn't right."
3) You return to your dorm, and your Pro Fro
host has disappeared. No, really. Like, he's gone.
PRO FRO: "Well, well, well. I'll just make
myself comfortable. After all, 1 won't have a Pro
Fro host next year, vou know."

CON FRO: "What the .. .? This just isn't right.'
4) It's after lunch, and you arc sitting in Poli Set
155 C — History of Political Thought IV: You
Kant Always Get What You Want, when you real
ize that you are, in fact, the only person awake —
except, of course, for the professor. Maybe.
PRO FRO: "Wow, a Stanford education is so
personalized!"
CON FRO: lin the only one awake — except
for the prof. This just isn't right."
5) As- you cross White Plaza on the way to an
impromptu barbecue, an impassioned young man
accosts you and asks you to sign a petition protest
ing some subsidiary of some company that incests
somewhere where someone oppresses somebody
else.
PRO FRO "I should do something. Social
activism is a good thing. It can't hurt just to
sign."
CON FRO: "This just isn't right."
Is Stanford right for you? As you can see, it's
all a matter of prospective perspective — does
Stanford seem right for you?
Within a few days, it will all be clear. Take
your time. Ijook around. Soak in the attention, as
every student and faculty member implores you
to join the Stanford "family," wooing and cooing
like an overly grateful flight attendant upon
landing ("Thank you so much for choosing us
. .."). If you like what you see and hear, take it
easy and enjoy.
Because Spring doesn't last forever, if you
know what 1 mean.
