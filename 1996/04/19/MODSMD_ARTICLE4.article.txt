# 11 groups lose special-fee vote
## 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
An indecisive student body
denied special fees to more than
one third of groups requesting
them, although only two organi
zations did not receive a majori
ty of votes.
The number of groups receiv
ing special fees dropped this
year, as students voted to give
only 19 of the 30 special-fee
groups the amount requested.
Eleven groups failed to re
ceive their fees — an increase
from last year when only six
groups lost funding.
Groups who had special fees this
year but lost their fee for next year
included KZSU, MEChA, Project
Motivation, Stanford American In
dian Organization, Stanford Con
cert Network, Stanford Jazz Or
chestra and the Stanford Women's
Collective.
Each of these groups received a
majority of votes, but did not re
ceive enough "yes" votes to win the
fee.
This year, special-fee groups
could apply to graduate students
only, undergraduates only or both
populations. In addition to winning
a majority of their population's vot
ers, at least 15 percent of the
group's total population must have
voted "yes" on the fee in order for
the fee to be approved.
In many of the groups which
failed due to the 15 percent rule, the
number of abstentions exceeded
the number of "no" votes. Each of
these groups requested their fee
from both the graduate and under
graduate populations.
KZSU this year requested
$94,252.44, the third largest re
quest among the 30 groups. The
radio station has never before lost
its special fee.
"Yes it was a surprise," said An
drew Iladin, who was KZSU's DJ
when the results were announced.

"We'll have to cut back a lot. We're
not sure how we'll make up the lost
funds."
Other groups failing to receive
their special fees included the
Stanford Cardinal Broadcasting
Network, the Stanford Solar Car
Project, Students against Geno
cide and Stanford Model United
Nations.
"This is the fifth year in a row
that we have failed to receive our
special fee," said Tudor Havriliuc,
executive director of SCBN. "We
want to look at it more in terms of
getting the majority of the vote. We
are very passionate about televi
sion."
The population group options
— which students last year voted
into the ASSU Constitution — cre
ated difficulties, according to one
group that failed to receive its spe
cial fee.
"Our main problem was that we
applied to both graduate and un
dergraduate populations," said
sophomore Angela Parker, an
SAIO member. "We took a chance.
I don't think it will hurt us.
MEChA has proved that student
groups am survive without special
fees. We'll just have to work even
harder next year."
In the senate elections, diversity
of parties characterized the senate
races — as no party emerged with a
clear majority of voting undergrad
uate senators.
Out of the top 10 vote-getting

senators, the Students' Alliance
and People's Platform captured
four senate seats each, while an in
dependent senator and a senator
with no affiliation captured the
other two voting slots.
Steve Yoda, the top vote-getting
senator and a member of the Stu
dents' Alliance, is excited about his
party's prospects for next year.
"The Students' Alliance is a real
strong party with great ideas," he
said. "We have a great bunch of sen
ators and I am looking forward to
working with them."
The voting senators in this
year's senate are comprised of
seven Platform members, two Al
liance representatives and an inde
pendent.
The diversity of next year's sen
ate will not present a problem, ac
cording to Joe Freund, the No. 3
vote-getting senator and a mem
ber of the People's Platform.
"One of the things I'm looking
forward to the most is working
with independent, Students' Al
liance and People's Platform sen
ate members," he said. "I think
people will be a lot more willing to
compromise and cooperate next
year."
Many newly elected senators ex
pressed a willingness to work for re
form.
"The Students' Alliance ran a lot
of really qualified people this year,"
said Emily Andrus, the No. 4 vote
getting senator and a member of

the Students' Alliance. "The party
has finally got its roots in. Now we
can finally do a lot with making
needed changes in the ASSU."
In a hotly contested election for
senior class presidents, "Saturday
Night Fever" won by 37 votes over
"Plugged In."
"We are absolutely thrilled,"
said junior Jason Herthel. "We look
forward to starting off the year
with a bang."
Slates for junior class presidents
and sophomore class presidents —
"Party of Four" and "S&M" respec
tively — which ran unopposed were
elected.
Each candidate who ran for
graduate senate won election, al
though three did not receive votes.
Winning votes were Alane Mur
dock, Steve Russell, Don Aing
worth, Michael Colon, Sherman Lo
and Nital Patel. Non-voting sena
tors are Mike Peterson, Diogo Rau
and Henry Wu.
In other election results, an
amendment to facilitate the ratifi
cation of constitutional amend
ments passed.
Elections Commissioner Ryan
Medders stressed that all elections
results are not final until absentee
ballots have been counted, a task
which will be completed within a
week.
However, he said that he did not
expect the absentee ballots to make
a significant difference to the elec
tion results.
