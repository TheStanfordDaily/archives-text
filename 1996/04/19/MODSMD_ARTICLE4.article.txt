### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
An indecisive student body
denied special fees to more than
one third of groups requesting
them, although only two organi
zations did not receive a majori
ty of votes.
The number of groups receiv
ing special fees dropped this
year, as students voted to give
only 19 of the 30 special-fee
groups the amount requested.
Eleven groups failed to re
ceive their fees â€” an increase
from last year when only six
groups lost funding.
