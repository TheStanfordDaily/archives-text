## Students reflect on Oklahoma City bombing 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
One year ago, Carey Jones and
Hiral Parekh were sitting in calcu
lus class when an explosion shook
the school building.
"We didn't really know what it
was," said Jones, now a Stanford
freshman. "I've never been in an
earthquake, but that's what it felt
like."
As the two students would soon
find out, the tremor was the result
of a massive bomb destroying most
of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building not far from the school in
downtown Oklahoma City.
The next several hours were
filled with uncertainty and unease
as facts about the bombing slowly
came to light. The next few weeks
were taken up with nonstop TV re
ports.
Now, a year later, Stanford stu
dents from Oklahoma City say the
memory of the events of April 19,
1995, remains strong.
Freshman Hemanth Parasur
am would have been able to see the
bomb crumble the federal building
from his high school. As it was, he
was on an airplane from Texas to
California to visit colleges, when
the explosion hit.
Upon his return two days later,
however, Parasuram witnessed
the full effect of the incident.
"I remember a week afterward
when I walked by the building," he
