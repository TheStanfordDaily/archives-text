# Remembering a year later
## Students reflect on Oklahoma City bombing 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
One year ago, Carey Jones and
Hiral Parekh were sitting in calcu
lus class when an explosion shook
the school building.
"We didn't really know what it
was," said Jones, now a Stanford
freshman. "I've never been in an
earthquake, but that's what it felt
like."
As the two students would soon
find out, the tremor was the result
of a massive bomb destroying most
of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building not far from the school in
downtown Oklahoma City.
The next several hours were
filled with uncertainty and unease
as facts about the bombing slowly
came to light. The next few weeks
were taken up with nonstop TV re
ports.
Now, a year later, Stanford stu
dents from Oklahoma City say the
memory of the events of April 19,
1995, remains strong.
Freshman Hemanth Parasur
am would have been able to see the
bomb crumble the federal building
from his high school. As it was, he
was on an airplane from Texas to
California to visit colleges, when
the explosion hit.
Upon his return two days later,
however, Parasuram witnessed
the full effect of the incident.
"I remember a week afterward
when I walked by the building," he

Reflecting back exactly one year later, Stanford students from Oklahoma City said the bombing of the Al
fred P. Murrah Federal Building was an unforgettable experience.
said. "The picture is still so fresh in
my mind."
For most people, the drama
began immediately.
Jones' father worked down
town. Phone lines were jammed,
and getting information was near
ly impossible.
"I was really worried about
that," she said. "It was mass chaos.
I finally talked to my mom. She had
talked to my dad, and he was dri
ving to work at the time."
All of the other students were
looking for similar confirmation.
"Everyone in my class had some
one working downtown," Jones
said.
The father of a friend of Para
suram escaped disaster by only a
few feet.
The huge portion of the build
ing that caved in after the explo
sion stopped just 2 feet in front of
his desk. When telling the story of
how his father carried a woman in
the office down to safety, "my
friend was shaken up," Parasuram
said. "I never expected him to be
shaken up."
Although speculation as to the
bomber's identity immediately
opened up in the media, residents
of the city were too numb to con
sider that aspect, Parekh said.
"It just seemed like such a
senseless act," she said. "It was re
ally upsetting, the whole thing
about the children, people who
were still stuck. For so long, they
were still digging for people."
"I remember the IT showing
crazy, graphic pictures — arms and
legs in the street," Jones said. "For
hours and hours, they showed a
continuing broadcast. They kept
the camera running, and whatever
happened happened."
Soon enough, talk moved to
who could have committed the
crime. Before suspect Timothy
McVeigh was arrested, suspicion
surrounded the Muslim communi
ty — creating tension at Jones and

Parekh's ethnically diverse school.
"Initially, everyone's first reac
tion was that it was a Muslim ter
rorist group," Jones said. "To find
out that it was someone not Mus
lim was a huge shock to the whole
state — to find out that it was
someone so close to home."
Parekh said she had a Muslim
friend who was harassed in a local
supermarket.
A year later, attention remains
focused on the midwestern city
where everyone least expected a
terrorist attack.
"It certainly put my city on the
map," Parekh said.
She and Jones both mentioned
that questions about the bombing
often come up when they are intro
duced to someone.
"People look at me for a while
and wonder if they should ask,"
Jones said. "Then they say, 'Did
you know anybody who died?' "
Discussion during the weeks
after the bombing and now, as the
first anniversary comes and goes,
often focuses on the heroics of Ok
lahoma City citizens who helped
ease the tragedy. That discussion is
valuable but it should dig deeper,
Parekh said.
"I don't believe in glorifying
how Oklahoma City came togeth
er," she said. "I think it takes away
from the question: Why the hell did
it have to happen?"
The bombing made it clear that
nowhere is completely safe, Para
suram said.
"Oklahoma has always been a
safe place," he said. "You always
hear about New York, but that's
like another country. This is really
my back yard."
The difference is obvious now,
as attention focuses once again on
the city.
"From the outer world's per
spective, it's the one-year anniver
sary," Parasuram said. "But
when you're there, every day you
hear a story, every day it's talked
about."
Even without the public expres
sion, the memories wouldn't fade.
"In my mind," Jones said, "it's
always going to be there."
