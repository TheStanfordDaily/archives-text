# Pollo's decision not political, Wais says
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Dean of Students Marc Wais
said yesterday the decision to
award space in Tresidder Union to
Polio's was a business decision, not
a political one.
In the end, the committee
charged with selecting Stanford's
newest and most talked-about ad
dition to Tresidder looked at what
each bidding company had to offer
in improving the student commu
nity, he said.
At a press conference, Wais an

nounced that Polio's will begin
serving its Mexican menu at
Tresidder this fall. However, he re
fused to comment on whether stu
dent pressure against Taco Bell's
parent company, PepsiCo, for its
investment in Myanmar, the
Southeast Asian country formerly
known as Burma, would have been
considered had Taco Bell's offer
been more competitive.
According to senior Michael
Meyer, chair of the advisory com
mittee which selected the new
restaurant to occupy Tresidder,
Polio's best satisfied the criteria
the committee considered.
"We looked at many factors," he
said. "It was a difficult choice, be
cause Tresidder only has one
kitchen.
"Polio's is willing to make a sig
nificant capital investment in
Tresidder by building a separate
kitchen," he added.
Council of Presidents member
Mike Choo, also a member of the
committee, said Polio's had "by far
submitted the best bid."
Choo said the final decision was
not directly affected by student ob
jections against bringing Taco Bell
to campus. More than 2,000 stu
dents signed a petition last quarter
protesting PepsiCo's cooperation
with the government of Myanmar.
"It was not in the jurisdiction of
the committee to decide if Taco
Bell was an appropriate choice due
to the actions of its parent compa
ny," Choo said. "We only had to
look at which bidder submitted the
most competitive bid."
But not having to deal with

Taco Bell as a choice might have
helped ease the decision-making
process. According to Mary Jean
Duran, a Taco Bell spokeswoman
out of Irvine, Calif., their group
had not consulted with the Stan
ford Management Company,
which manages Tresidder, for at
least a year and could not fully
comment on yesterday's an
nouncement.
Even so, Choo said the 2,000
students who signed the petition
opposing Taco Bell "were of course
considered," as were the students
who expressed support for Taco
Bell coming to campus.
"Would we have put in a Taco
Bell anyway? We don't know,"
Meyer said. "We looked at the mas
ter plan — I Polio's] offered superi
or service, the financial invest
ment, the type of menu and the
hours we wanted."
According to Meyer, a complete
floor plan should be available with
in a few weeks. The new restau
rant is set to occupy the area di
rectly under the Tresidder Lalß.
An additional bonus offered by
choosing Polio's is that it offers a
menu that will increase the dining
options at Tresidder, Wais said.
"They are not going to be a
restaurant in lieu of Bon Appetit;

they looked for competition. We
hope that Bon Appetit will upgrade
and modify its selection, especially
regarding its Asian food menu,"
Wais said.
Currently, Bon Appetit is the
only food service provider in
Tresidder. The Coffee House and
the Corner Pocket are among its
operations.
Rey Hernandez, general man
ager of Bon Appetit, said Universi
ty administrators had been keep
ing him informed about the pro
ject. He said he does not expect to
make many menu changes once
Polio's moves in.
"We do not intend to closedown
our taqueria; in fact we offer some
items they do not, such as the en
chiladas," Hernandez said.
"Overall we think it's a good
move; it's best for the communi
ty," he added.
"Our main concern is to provide
a greater variety of services for stu
dents; as well, we need to reduce
the financial contribution of the
University to Tresidder," Wais
said.
Wais declined to comment on
competing bids, saying only that it
was inappropriate to say anything
about them at the moment.
Gwen Maxfield, the project

manager for Polio's, said the com
pany, which is based in Mountain
View and operates 15 restaurants
in the Bay Area, will try to bring a
unique atmosphere to campus.
"One of the major features we
will want to have in the restaurant
is a 600-foot events room equipped
with a large-screen TV where stu
dents can come eat and have meet
ings or just socialize," Maxfield
said.
Ray Klein, the owner and presi
dent of Polio Rey, the official name
of the chain, was also on hand to
thank the committee and the Uni
versity for granting them the op
portunity to open a restaurant on
campus. In addition, he said
Polio's "does not serve Pepsi prod
ucts."
Wais and Klein also mentioned
the commitment Polio's has
shown to Stanford in the past,
from donating food at University
events to conducting promotional
campaigns with Stanford athletic
teams.
Polio's menu consists mainly of
Mexican fare: tacos, burritos and
quesadillas. Prices range from 99
cents to $3.49. Polio's also bills it
self as a restaurant committed to
"reducing the fat and cholesterol"
in its customers' diets.
