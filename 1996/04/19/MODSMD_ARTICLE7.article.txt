## In witty speech, Coupland talks about his life

Best-selling author Douglas
Coupland, who coined the term
"Generation X," regaled a Memor
ial Auditorium audience last night
with stories from his life.
Coupland is the author of such
bestsellers as "Generation X,"
"Shampoo Planet," "Life After
God" and "Microserfs."
Coupland began his 90-minute
speech by explaining how he
began writing. Describing the
round-about way he got into writ
ing, Coupland said his work was
first noticed by a magazine editor
who saw a postcard he had sent to
a friend. Coupland was at that

time in his 20s and was working as
an artist. He said his parents were
worried the switch would put him
on "q downward career trajecto
ry."
Coupland, who was born in
1961 and grew up in Vancouver,
British Columbia, said his writing
is entirely autobiographical.
Reading from three of his narra
tives, he shared with the audience
some defining events in his life.
The first event, he said, oc
curred in 1982 when he witnessed
a suicidal jumper coaxed down
from a bridge in Vancouver — a
bridge which he said was an "in
tricate part of his life."
In the second narrative, Coup
land described his youthful inter
est in his local cemetery, which he
said was "buried on the edge of
nowhere." He said he sees ceme
teries as a culture's expression of
its relationship with death.
In the final narrative, titled
"Postcard from Palo Alto," Coup
land remembered his 1994 visit to
Palo Alto and Stanford, an area
which he said had "no caveats of
enjoyment."
Coupland said he was struck by
the contrast between Palo Alto's
beautiful trees and the neighbor

ing Silicon Valley. He compared
the museum in Hoover Tower,
which memorializes Herbert
Hoover, to a "museum of walnuts
one would expect to find in a
strange town."
He also reminded the audience
that the environment in Palo Alto
is idyllic, and that there is always a
sense of "quietly knowing peace is
not the natural state of the world."
Coupland then showed the au
dience a 20-minute documentary,
which was titled "Close Personal
Friend." He produced it with a
television station in Britain.
The documentary featured an
interview of Coupland during
which he answered a broad array
of questions, ranging from "What
have our lives become?" to "What
is this obsession we have with

super models?"
The documentary included an
eclectic collage of popular food
items and spliced phrases over the
screen, including Jell-0 packages,
cartoon characters and words like
"mind, body, soul."
The style of the documentary
and Coupland's manner of presen
tation amused the audience, draw
ing chuckles throughout the
evening. His artistic mind was ap
parent through his witty humor
and original comparisons.
After the documentary, Coup
land spent about 15 minutes field
ing questions from the audience.
In response to one question, he
said that despite new information
technologies, interpersonal rela
tionships will stay the same.
"There's nothing to worry about."

He also urged listeners not to
think of history as a cycle which
repeats. Rather, he said, with new
information technologies, the fu
ture is unpredictable.
One student asked Coupland
what his dream "Jeopardy" cate
gories would be. The author listed
some possibilities — including pop
culture of the 19605, the cultiva
tion of bamboo, V6 and V8 en
gines, his "psychotic family," li
cense plate mottos, facts of the
Antarctic and synthesizer bands
of the late '70s and early '80s.
Coupland finished his speech
by thanking audience members
for coming out to see him instead
of watching Thursday night fa
vorites, "Seinfeld" and "Friends."
The speech was sponsored by
the ASSU Speakers Bureau.
