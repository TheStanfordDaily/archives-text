BACK PAIN
RESEARCH STUDY: EARN $25.
Volunteers who frequently use medication for low back pain (either
prescription or over the counter), but are otherwise in generally good
health, are sought for a study of a holistic treatment using the human
biofield, at the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology in Palo Alto. Prior
research with this technique has shown highly consistent improvements
in back pain, with no negative effects. For info, call 415-938-361^.
