April is the Crudest Month...
Today's birthday;
The tarot card for today's birthday is the Ace
of Cups. This card is for rejoicing, a symbol of
the good times that are ahead. The cup is a
drinking vessel, clueing you into wine,
women/men and song that lies ahead this
summer. Be careful, though, that the drunken
debauchery on which you will embark doesn't
leave you with a spiritual hangover. In love,
you feel especially flirtatious and outgoing,
your audacity surprises even you. This love
may be unrequited, though, so don't fall too
hard.
