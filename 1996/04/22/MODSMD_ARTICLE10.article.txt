Too many peacemakers?
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres criticized yesterday the mushroom
ing number of would-be Middle East peacemakers
and said only the United States was capable of
working out a cease-fire in southern Lebanon.
"It cannot be done from many channels," Peres
said as American, Russian and European diplo
mats crisscrossed the region pursuing their own
proposals to end the fighting between Israel and
Shiite Hezbollah extremists.
Clearly preferring American mediation over
the others, Peres said, "If there will be more than
one channel there will be total confusion."
The Israeli leader, the target of rising world
criticism for the Israeli bombardment of southern
Lebanon — but supported unwaveringly by the
Clinton administration — met twice with Secre
tary of State Warren Christopher.

lowing the Bell Atlantic board's approval Saturday,

dition of anonymity. Spokesmen for both companies

position to confront increasingcompetition and enter
new businesses from a bigger customer base. It could
also be the second-biggest merger in U.S. history.
