MOSCOW (AP) - With hugs
and handshakes, President
Clinton and Boris Yeltsin trad
ed warm compliments and
played down nagging differ
ences yesterday, insisting that
their election-year summit was
not influenced by presidential
politics.
Both leaders facing re-election
battles, Clinton and Yeltsin
would not even entertain the
possibility of a Communist come
back in Russia. "I am sure that I
will be victorious," Yeltsin
boomed at a Kremlin news con
ference with Clinton.
"That makes my answer irrel
evant, doesn't it," Clinton said
with a smile.
With Yeltsin under fire for the
bloody fighting in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya, Clinton

expressed sympathy with Rus
sia's position and compared the
situation with America's Civil
War.
Clinton said Abraham Lincoln
gave his life for the proposition
"that no state had a right to
withdraw from our union. And
so, the United States has taken
the position that Chechnya is a
part of Russia."
As to whether the summit
would help politically, Clinton
said, "It's a great mistake to put
too much of a political spin on
this since typically foreign policy
does not play that big a role in
voting patterns."
After five hours of talks, Clin
ton and Yeltsin reported progress
in resolving a dispute over the
deployment of Russian troops
under a 30-nation treaty on con

ventional forces in Europe.
They also said they set the
stage to clear up Russia's objec
tions to development of Ameri
can theater missile defenses
under the 1972 Antiballistic Mis
sile Treaty. Formal negotiations
resume in Geneva in June.
While the presidents met,
about 300 Communists protest
ed on Red Square, laying flowers
at Lenin's tomb. One of their
banners read, "Lenin lives and
will be victorious."
It was Clinton's third trip to
Moscow in three years and his
10th meeting with Yeltsin, the
final stop on a trip that began
with visits to South Korea and
Japan. The trip came at a time of
doubt about Russia's continued
transition from communism to
democracy.
