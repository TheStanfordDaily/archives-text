## Price discrimination 
### 
Bookstore should make
known price differences
for the same materials

AS THE ONLY comprehen
sive bookseller on campus,
the Bookstore looks very
much like a monopoly and thus is
an easy target for student com
plaints. The preliminary hearing
against the Bookstore's former
managers who are accused of
serious fiscal improprieties does
not help the Bookstore's image
either. Nor does its policy of price
discrimination.
The exact same book may cost
significantly more in the text
book division than on the main
level. For instance, the required
text for Philosophy 194 C: "The
Philosophy of Social Science,"
sells for $34.95 downstairs in the
textbook division. The same edi
tion of the book is priced at
$29.95 in the Philosophy section
on the main level, a $5 price dif
ferential. Far from being an
anomaly, this kind of in-store
price discrimination is systematic
at the Bookstore.
A Bookstore representative
explained that these in-store price
differentials are the result of the
store's book-ordering policy. Each
Bookstore division orders books
independently, and each sets its
prices based on the particular
deal it gets with the publisher. So
if one division orders a certain
book in large numbers, it is likely
to price that book at a lower cost
than another division that orders
the same book at a smaller quan
tity. One would think, then, that
the textbook division would be
able to offer the lowest prices
since it tends to order books in
very substantial quantities. How
ever, no such logic appears in
actual retail prices.
The Bookstore representative
pointed out there may be occa

sions when the textbook division
price is cheaper than the main
level price, and students are wel
come to purchase the book from
whichever division they please.
In other words, the Bookstore's
position is students ought to run
around the store, checking
whether another division might
be selling a certain book at a
lower price than another divi
sion. This is patently absurd.
The Bookstore directs students
to its lower level for required
course materials, and nowhere
does it suggest that some text
books may be found upstairs at a
cheaper price. It is indefensible to
charge students more for certain
books than it charges the general
public who would likely look on
the main-level shelves. This is
nothing less than price discrimi
nation directed against students.
To maintain that students some
times get the better price is no
defense at all, for this is to admit
that the Bookstore policy is incon
sistent and arbitrary with respect
to textbook prices. Like all cus
tomers, students expect that
prices are uniform throughout
the store, and failure to tell them
that book prices may differ
depending on the division is disin
genuous at best.
With its sophisticated comput
er inventory catalog, the Book
store could easily insure that
prices are uniform throughout
the store. On the other hand, if it
insists on maintaining its current
ordering and pricing system, it
ought to make it clear to cus
tomers, by way of posters or peri
odic announcements, that the
price of an identical item may dif
fer depending on the area in
which it is selected.
The Bookstore is an institution
students love to hate, and while
the Bookstore does not always
deserve the criticism it receives,
it engages in a pernicious kind of
price discrimination. It is unfor
tunate this institution continues
to sully its name with indefensi
ble pricing policies.
