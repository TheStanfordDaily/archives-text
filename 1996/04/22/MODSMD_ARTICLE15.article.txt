## Admit Weekend: a great show 
### 
4 "X TOW BE HONEST with me. My
Ifamily would have to spend a
X lot of money to send me here,
so I've got to know. How do you like Stan
ford?"
"Aw, shucks. It's great!"
"Really?"
"Really."
"Good. I think I really like it here,
too."
"I thought you would. You know,
you're the best pro fro a guy could ask
for. Let me buy you some fro yo at the
CoPo."
Admit Weekend: The Greatest Show
on Earth. Three days when the freshmen
in Lagunita Court pretend they enjoy
being doubled up in a single the size of a
Volkswagen bus, so far removed from
campus they haven't actually seen Bran
ner yet. ("Well, sure I have friends.
There's my RA, my RCC ...")
They do it as a favor to the University,
which seeks to lure more than 1,000 high
school seniors away from Harvard, Yale
and Princeton. Everything must be per
fect from the administration's perspec
tive, because the stakes are so high. If the
weekend is a bust and these prospects
shun Stanford for other colleges, then
yield rates fall and President Casper
watches his school hit double digits in the
U.S. News and World Report rankings.
At the same time, our stake in the
weekend is just as large as Casper's.

Despite the subtle alliteration, few of us
relish the phrase "state school." It's what
many of us have to look forward to, how
ever, if Stanford's prestige diminishes.
The implications of an Admit Week
end disaster are enormous, so our actions
follow accordingly. When a pro fro and
his family ask about all the construction,
we say we haven't noticed that half the
Quad is closed. We don't reveal it has
been for several years, along with much
of the rest of campus. When they ask if
we've been dating much, we feign aston
ishment and reply, "Academics are
always first. Midterms are coming up —
there's no time!" Then we close the dress
er drawer a little tighter to ensure they
don't find the condoms hidden below the
socks. It isn't a lie — we're still not dat
ing. The prospect of explaining a "hook
up" to these people is a daunting one, so
we simply avoid it altogether.
We're also careful to move the fake ID
— the one we bought for 50 bucks in Los
Angeles — from the front of our wallet to
the back, lest our innocent high school stu
dent discover the real reason his host
didn't come home until 3:30 a.m. last
night. After all, we were such good kids in
high school; Stanford couldn't change that.
This romanticized, idealized notion of
the "Stanford Experience" permeates
every facet of the campus during Admit
Weekend. Strangers say hi to each ether,
post office workers smile as they welcome
patrons to the counter and people in

every dorm play the name game. "Do you
know Sarah? I think she went to your
high school."
"Yeah, she's so cool. How about Jen
nifer, Sarah's friend. Did you meet her,
too?"
The frat boys are off on their weekend
trips and alcohol is nowhere to be found.
Lawns have been mowed, flowers have
bloomed and Lake Lag is completely full.
Even the clock tower strikes at the cor
rect time. One by one, the riff-rafT have
been swept to the side, so all that remains
is first-class academia and the glory of
Residential Education.
Yep, it should be perfect. To those in
charge, it may be. Yet, something seems
sorely wrong. Isn't this false advertising?
It seems as if we're trying to sell what our
school is not. Furthermore, is anyone
sure this artificial Stanford is more
attractive to the pro fros than reality? Do
they really want a cappella concerts and
Econ 1 classes, or do they want something
less contrived? Perhaps we should try a
symposium entitled, "Stanford's Child
Stars: Past, Present and Future." While
the Mendicants are interesting, I suspect
I'd be much more inclined to choose Stan
ford if I knew I had a shot — however
minute — at rooming next to Alicia.

Or next to Dan Pintauro.
