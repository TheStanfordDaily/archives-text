University should take a stance against racist graffiti

THE RECENT WAVE of racist graffi
ti mmed at the Asian-American com
munity here at Stanford has been
especially disturbing. Indeed, we, as stu
dents who are active in our ethnic centers,
feel a strong sense of violation, for this safe
space for students and members of the
community has been attacked. However,
even more disturbing is the inadequate
response given by the senior administra
tion in addressing this incident of racism at
our university. This is not the first time
that a racial incident of this magnitude has
occurred on campus. Indeed, there are a
plethora of incidents which occur daily yet
remain unreported. Some past incidents
include: 1) The 1994 Flicks incident in
which moviegoers screamed, "Go home,
beaners!" after a showing of "No Grapes,"
a film which documents the plight of
migrant farm workers, 2) The infamous
"Beethoven" incident in which a picture of
Beethoven in blackface with the word
"Nigger" scrawled on it was posted on a
black student's door in Ujamaa, and 3) The
recent drive on the part of conservative
students and alumni to resurrect the racist
Stanford Indian caricature as the Universi

ty mascot. We could list a host of others,
but you see our point. Last quarter,
"Chinks Suck" was written repeatedly on a
desk in a meeting room of the Asian Amer
ican Activities Center. On April 1, the word
"Chinks" was scrawled across a computer
screen with a red permanent marker. And
four days later, "Fuck you, Chinks" was
written inside a refrigerator with mustard.
Wlnle these incidents have had the center's
phones ringing with news reporters, vari
ous community organizations, alumni and
staff expressing concern and interest, we
are outraged by the lack of attention grant
ed by the Stanford senior administration.
Only after a whirlwind of attention and 10
days had passed since the April 1 act did
the senior administration mobilize to issue
a statement. Does the administration real
ize that this is a problem that affects not
just the Asian-American community but
the entire Stanford community? How
much more hate must members of our eth
nic communities experience before Stan
ford will take a moral and ethical stance?
We believe the University should take the
steps to deal with hate crimes on campus.
The University has a policy on sexual

harassment, but to our knowledge there is
no policy on how to handle hate crimes. It
would seem that in the wake of the May
1994 desecration of the "Gay Liberation"
statue, that the University would have cre
ated such a policy. We recommend that the
University take proactive steps in address
ing these acts on campus by arming itself
with a procedure which anticipates future
incidents and one that helps ease the ten
sion, frustration and emotion which arises
from acts of hate and ignorance. Moreover,
we hope the University will take a stand
against any future racial incidents, making
it clear that such activity is unacceptable.
The following are recommendations which
the University should incorporate into a
hate crime policy: 1) The University should
issue a statement within seven days to The
Stanford Daily and Stanford Report stating
what concrete actions it is taking (or will
take) to resolve the issue. 2) The Universi
ty should launch a thorough investigation
into the hate crime and keep the ethnic
centers up to date on its progress. 3) The
University should work with the ethnic
centers and community to develop ways of
handling the current situation as well as

ways to cope with hate crimes and protect
itself from future attacks.
Especially because this is an institution
that prides itself on its diversity, Honor
Code and Fundamental Standard, we find
this lack of concern particularly insulting
and disrespectful. Racism anywhere is a
threat and problem everywhere and, at the
very least, should merit the attention of
the greater Stanford community. It is not
the responsibility of one particular depart
ment, group or person to respond or care,
but rather is a concern we should all share.
We would like to think that Stanford is a
place where discussion is encouraged
rather than ignored. We look forward to
seeing a senior administration at Stanford
University which takes a leadership role in
battling racism.
