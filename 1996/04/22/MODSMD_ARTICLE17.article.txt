# Admits should consider more than just weather
## 
### 
This is a letter to all admits. Hope
fully, your host gave you something
better to do than read page four of The
Daily. This letter is mainly directed to
those who had the misfortune of read
ing The Daily's editorial Friday on why
you should come to Stanford, summed
up, basically, as "the weather, the peo
ple, the location and campus life."
I want you to know not everyone

here is as patronizing as whoever wrote
that editorial. Yeah, all of those things
are true, and they're part of what
makes this school so great. Still, most
people who go here decided to do so for
far more significant reasons, and most
of us aren't quite that shallow.
Know this: the best reason to come
here is it's a first-rate school. Yes, it
has flaws. Some classes are too big.
Some teachers don't seem to care as
much about teaching as they perhaps
should. The administration often
seems distant and uncaring about
what students think. There's even a

fairly notable rift between undergrad
uates and graduates. But Stanford is a
damn good school in virtually every
department. And beyond academics,
the greatest thing about Stanford (not
the weather!) is that if you want, you
can be involved in something, some
how.
Don't come here because the weath
er is better than New England or
because San Francisco is prettier than
New Haven. Don't come here because
"we're not competitive" (ask your hosts
if they've taken Chem 33). And don't
come here because of the wild campus

life; Stanford is in Palo Alto, and
frankly, it's not all that wild.
Stanford isn't "the Harvard of the
West." The students, faculty and staff
work far too hard and have accom
plished far too much to be just an imita
tion of another school. Come here for
one reason: Stanford will challenge you,
intimidate you and give you the chance
to do more than you ever thought possi
ble. If that is what you want, come here.
If that's true, and only if that's true,
you'll come here and never regret it.
