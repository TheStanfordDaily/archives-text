## Solutions for the stressed: an amalgam of advice 
### 
YbU'D BE SHOCKED at what people
tell me. It's true, give someyutz a col
umn and, so long as he isn't a com
plete blatherskite (which is actually the
case three out of five times), he gets a bar
rage of e-mail bearing people's most ulti
mate secrets, asking all sorts of advice as if
he were an undergraduate guru, a therapist
for an aching Stanford sensibility, an omni
scient answerer of all questions — all from
people he's never met.
My usual response is to ignore every
thing people write me — RAs get too much
e-mail as it is. But today I finally make
amends. Today I respond. Today I make
like the Science Bug of life and love, the
Dear Abby of antipathy and answer a por
tion from the pile of "Dear Michaels."
Dear Michael,
I've been dating this girl for almost a
year and a half now and everything's been
going great except that we're both graduat
ing. How can 1 tell if the relationship is
worth continuing once we leave ?
This is a tough one. Couples with half or
both of its members taking the "Pomp and
Circumstance" plunge this June have been
mulling it over ever since spring hit.
"Should we stay together?" "Do I mold my
plans just to stay together with this goofus
with the cute legs?" "Is a bird in hand
worth relocating to North Jersey?"

Figure your basic barometer in this
respect is sex. If you're getting down to
brass tacks fewer than four times a week
why kid yourself? You'll always have those
nice memories of going to the movies
together and shaking hands in the hiillway.
But past that what have you got worth
keeping?
Urn, I really blew the MCATs. What
method of suicide do you recommend?
Take them again.
Why is there anger in the world?
Low serotonin.
For the past few weeks my boyfriend
talks about nothing but his thesis. He's bor
ing the hell out of me — what do I do?
To begin with, know it's not your fault
that the relationship probably won't make
it. This self-absorbed, self-pitying fixation
on undergraduate research happens to a
good 78 percent of honors students — you,
dear, are only a victim.
As for what to do, go with the basic neg
ative operant conditioning approach: Every
time he mentions the big T, just flick him in
the wiener. He'll learn. Otherwise, see if
you can stick out the three more weeks till
the May 15 deadline. If at that point you
find you're still having sex fewer than four
times a week, dump his sorry ass.

Why do people like fried food so much ?
liOw serotonin.
So I've been dating this Inon-Jewish
girl]. She's a total bal>e and all, but my par
ents are gonna crap their pants if they find
out she's Catholic. Help!
First off, realize that since she's Catholic
you're half way there to conversion already
— Catholics and Jews have tons in com
mon. Both have that whole guilt thing
going, the chief difference being that in
Catholicism you're meant to feel bad about
what you do, but in Judaism you're made to
feel bad about what you do to your parents.
So how to finish the job?
Here's what you do: Pick a cool sound
ing European country that your honey's
never visited and whose language she
knows nothing of — say France for exam
ple — and make plans to travel together
this summer to that country to study its
culture. Now she's all excited.
Assuming she doesn't speak any
Hebrew either, you just surreptitiously
swap your tix for a TWA non-stop to
Charles DeGaulle for two spots on an El-Al
overnight to Ben-Gurion. When you arrive
in Israel plop your honey down in
Jerusalem, tell her it's Paris and watch her
assimilate. She'll never know the differ
ence. Sure she'll embarrass you for the first
few weeks, ordering ham on her falafel.

talking about hiking and mayonnaise and
auto repair and such, but within two
months that babe of yours'll be ready for
her Bat Mitzvah.
This one was left on my answering
machine: "When people win those radio
contests where the prize is to go hang out on
tour with cool bands like Aerosmith or
something, do they, like, really hang out
with them or does Steve Tyler just say 'hi'
and shake their hand and get all bitter at
his publicist for making him chill with fan
boys?"
Truth is no one ever really wins those
contests. It's all a publicity stunt. Steve
Tyler is an animatron.
Recently, I've found that when I sneeze
really hard my soul leaves my body. How
should I take advantage of the advanced
spiritual state?
Actually, I've had that very experience
three times myself. (The first time was
afler a bad vegi-Mu Shu at a vegan Chinese
restaurant — I'm pretty sure those mush
rooms weren't Shiitake). Each time I've
found my soul freed of its earthy anchor,
adrift, intangible, invisible, I handled it the
same way: headed straight to the women's
shower. Give it a shot.
Condom etiquette: Who takes it off,

me or him?
The onerous task of prophylactic
removal is not actually determined by any
gender or giver / receiver basis. It is, rather,
a matter of whose trash bin it will be
deposited into and whether or not it has a
lining.
Ixitely, I've been having an exorbitant
amount of sex. Should 1 make any changes
in my diet to compensate ?
Caffeine is good, as are all your basic
stimulants. Men have a tendency to donate
about .6 mg of zinc with each orgasm, so
you might consider going back on the Flint
stones. Women should keep up a steady
intake of fluids and Lubriderm. Try to
avoid fried foods.
1 've liked this girl for the whole year and
when I finally asked her out she said no.
How can I change her mind?
Start dating one of her closest friends
and she'll be all over you like a bad case of
eczema. Also, if you start being really insen
sitive and thoughtless, you could have her
whole draw group after you.

Note: Many of the questions quoted above
are genuine.
