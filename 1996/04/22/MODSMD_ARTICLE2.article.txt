# ASSU looks ahead to implementing 'C '96'
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
The ASSU spring gener
al election may be over, but
the enormous task of insti
tuting the reforms stu
dents voted for has just
begun.
In an attempt to make
the ASSU's metamorpho
sis from its current struc
ture to the one outlined in

"Constitution '96" as smooth as possible,
current Council of Presidents member Jon
Oram has delegated the task to a Constitu
tional Transition Committee, which will be
responsible for "implementing the new
ASSU Constitution in a timely and effective
manner," he said.
The committee will also make sure "the
ASSU does not suffer either institutionally or
through its dealings with the administration
either due to the transition or the time in
volved," Oram added.
Oram, who will serve as chair of the com
mittee, has thus far nominated "Constitu
tion '96" author Michael Slemmer, ASSU un
dergraduate senator and "Constitution *96"
sponsor Andre Vanier, undergraduate sena
tor and graduate senator-elect Steve Russell,
ASSU Financial Manager John Hall, ASSU
Parliamentarian Solomon Lefler and the
four members of the COP-elect, sophomore
Steve Liu and freshmen Dave Guendelman,
Joe Pawson and Pete Vlastelica.
"More committee members may or may
not be appointed in the future as the need
arises," Oram said.

"Constitution '96" puts a single president
in charge of the ASSU's executive branch,
creates a five-person Constitutional Council
appointed by the president to carry out judi
cial review, reduces the size of the senate
from 40 to 30 and grants all senators voting
power.
If approved by the Board of Trustees or its
designee — which in the past has been either
the University president or the dean of stu
dents — "Constitution '96" would immedi
ately nullify the current ASSU Constitution.
Slemmer said "huge problems" might ensue
if the senate does not legislate provisions to
facilitate the transition to the new ASSU
structure mandated by "Constitution '96."
For example, because the existing four
person COP is invalid according to "Consti
tution '96," the senate must decide how to
maintain its executive leadership for the re
mainder of the senate's term, which con
cludes in late May.
In addition, because the current senate
has five more undergraduate senators and
five fewer graduate senators than "Constitu
tion '96" would require, a measure must be
proposed to keep the senate's current mem
bership valid until the end of its term.
The current ASSU Constitution was ap
proved in 1969 after University President
Kenneth Pitzer, appointed by the Board of
Trustees, was charged to authorize the new
constitution. Pitzer took more than five
months to finalize his approval.
In a letter written in late September 1969,
Pitzer's approval was accompanied by a
lengthy list of "items and interpretations . . .
