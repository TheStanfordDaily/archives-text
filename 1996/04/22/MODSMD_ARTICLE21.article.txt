## Baseball takes three straight from Arizona 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Heading into the series finale at Arizona
yesterday, Stanford second baseman Brian
Dallimore told his teammates he was going for
10 hits in the series.
"They asked me how many 1 needed, and I
said, 'I just need six today,' and everyone
started laughing," Dallimore said.
By the end of the day, it was Dallimore who
was laughing after going 6-for-6 with six runs
batted in and two runs scored in Stanford's
22-4 romp. The six hits and six RBIs are ca
reer bests for Dallimore, who drove in five
runs earlier this year against Hawaii. In the
first three years of his Stanford career, Dal
limore had more trouble with Wildcat pitch
ing than any other team in the Pacific 10
Southern Division, hitting .253 against Ari
zona.
But no one dressed in cardinal and white
had trouble hitting the ball yesterday, as the
No. 18 Cardinal completed a season sweep of
the Wildcats. With a 6-5 win Friday night, a 9-
3 triumph Saturday and Sunday's 18-run
laugher, Stanford improved its record to 27-
17 overall and 13-11 in the Six Pac. The Car
dinal now stands in third place behind USC
and UCLA, while Arizona (22-27, 6-18 in the
Six Pac) resides in the conference cellar.
"I put some good swings on some balls
today," Dallimore said. "I got real lucky with
a couple of balls — this field is really hard in
front of home plate, so it gave me a couple of
hits, but I'll take them any way I can get
them."
Freshman Jeff Austin (4-3) tossed seven
strong innings to pick up the win, his first
since a Feb. 24 gem against UCLA. Stanford
jumped out to a 5-0 lead in the second inning
and stretched the advantage to 9-3 at the end
of six. In the seventh, the Cardinal exploded
for 11 runs, its highest single-inning offensive
output of the year. Austin held Arizona score
less from the fourth through the seventh in
nings before leaving the game with Stanford
ahead 20-3.
Nine Cardinal batters collected RBIs and
seven had at least two hits. Right fielder Joe
Kilburg was 3-for-3 with four RBIs, two runs
scored and two stolen bases, catcher A.J.
Hinch was 2-for-3 with two RBIs and three
runs scored, first baseman Luke Quaccia had
two hits, two RBIs and three runs scored and
designated hitter Jon Schaeffer had two hits,
four RBIs and scored twice.
Stanford also piled up eight extra-base
hits, including home runs by Dallimore (2),
Schaeffer (7) and Kilburg (5).
Dallimore said a key to the rout was Stan
ford's ability to get runs on the board early in
the game.
"It's hard to come back after losing the
first two [games of a series]," he said. "Once
you put up a couple of runs in the first two in
nings, it's easy for them to fold. It took any bit
of confidence they had out of them. Once we
get a couple of runs, the momentum carries
over and like everyone says, hitting is conta
gious — once we get a couple hits, everyone
wants to hit."
