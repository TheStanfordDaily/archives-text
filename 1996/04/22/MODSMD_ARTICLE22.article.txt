# Women's tennis clinches Pac-10 title
## Cardinal downs UCLA, USC to complete undefeated conference season 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The No. 2-ranked Stanford women's tennis squad
clinched its ninth straight Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionship and its second consecutive undefeated confer
ence season thus weekend by feasting on both No. 5
UCLA and No. 19USC.
In its final dual matches of the season, the Cardinal
(22-1 overall, 10-0 Pac-10 Southern Division) braved
inclement weather both Friday and Saturday after
noon to defeat the Trojans, 5-1, and the Bruins, 7-2.
The wins brought Stanford's overall winning streak
to 12 matches, while the team's conference winning
streak will stand at 24 until next season.
"I would like to start the NCAAs starting Monday,"
said Stanford head coach Frank Brennan. "That's how
well we're playing. Everybody's healthy, eveiybody's
playing well, everybody's happy. Things are going well.
"We're playing much better than we were at the be
ginning of the season, which is what is supposed to hap
pen with a good team."
On Saturday, the Cardinal stomped all over the
fifth-ranked Bruins, winning the first five singles
matches — all in straight sets.
Redshirt senior Amy Chiminello and junior Sandra
De Silva wrapped up their UCLA opponents almost im
mediately. Chiminello (20-1) bulldozed Alyson Gray, 6-
1, 6-0 on the No. 6 court, while De Silva (17-4) found
similar success on the No. 3 court against Kelly
Rudolph.
Stanford victories on the No. 2, No. 4 and No. 5 court
were soon to follow. Cardinal junior Katie Schlukebir
(18-4) avenged a recent loss to UCLA's Paige Yaroshuk
by winning in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3. Yaroshuk, infa
mous for an incident last season in which she hit Stan
ford head coach Frank Brennan with a ball, was a tar
get for the Stanford faithful all afternoon.
Redshirt senior Kim Shasby bounced back from a
loss Friday against USC to roll over Brandi Freuden
bergin the No. 4 match, 6-1,6-3.
Sophomore Julie Scott continued to tear through
opponents on the No. 5 court. With a 6-2, 6-1 win over
Anicia Mendez, Scott has now taken 12 consecutive sin
gles matches. She last lost at the National Team Indoor
Championships two months ago in the Cardinal's only
loss of the season, a defeat at the hands of No. 1 Florida.
The only singles loss came in the No. 1 match, where
sophomore Ania Bleszynski (16-7) met defending
NCAA singles champion Keri Phebus, whom she upset
two weeks ago in Los Angeles. Phebus tied up the dual
match series at one with a 6-4,6-4 win.
Despite clinching the match with Schlukebir's victo
ry, doubles were contested, with the Cardinal taking
two of the three matches. Bleszysnki and Schlukebir
(10-3), currently ranked No. 2 in the nation, beat the
sixth-ranked tandem of Phebus and Yaroshuk for the
second time in three weeks, 6-3,6-4.
Sliding up into the No. 2 doubles spot for the after
noon were junior Emily Burt and senior Beth Berris.
Burt and Berris (7-0) stepped up accordingly, beating
Mendez and Rudolph, 6-4,6-4.
Just two weeks ago at UCLA, the Cardinal needed
dramatic comebacks from the No. 5 singles player to
avoid going into doubles down 4-2.
"I think we're more confident than we were in that
match, and I think we're playing better," said Brennan.
"But certainly, UCLA did not play as well."
Stanford has now won five straight matches over
UCLA, a statistic that sits quite well with Brennan.
"They are certainly a team we like to beat," he said.
"Of all the teams in the Pac-10, we like to beat UCLA
the best. So that's gratifying to know that you're han
dling good teams and rivals with ease and sending them
home."
Seniors Berris, Chiminello and Shasby each won
their final matches at the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
