# Men's tennis gets tripped up in L.A.
## 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
To ensure a seeding no worse
than second in the NCAA tourna
ment, men's tennis coach Dick
Gould said his team needed to win at
least one match over the weekend.
Unfortunately for Stanford fans,
No. 7 USC (16-6) and No. 1 UCLA
(24-0) prevented the No. 2 Cardinal
(19-4) from locking up the sought
after second slot.
In Los Angeles on Friday, Stan
ford suffered a terribly close defeat to

the Trojans, 4-3. The next after
noon, the Bruins outplayed the Car
dinal on their way to a 5-2 victory.
Particularly frustrating for Stan
ford was the manner in which it lost
to USC. The Cardinal's biggest
strengths have traditionally been its
depth and its doubles. Yet, in falling
to the Trojans, Stanford players
failed to take the doubles point and
dropped the fourth, fifth and sixth
singles matches.
The Cardinal's top doubles team
of senior Jim Thomas and sopho
more Paul Goldstein, currently

ranked No. 2 nationally, eked out a
9-7 victory, but neither of Stanford's
second or third duos could pull out a
win. The 16th-ranked tandem of se
nior Jeff Salzenstein and freshman
Ryan Wolters lost 8-4, and senior
Ricky Becker and junior Grant El
liott suffered their worst defeat of
the season, 8-1.
Down one point heading into sin
gles play, the Cardinal battled back.
At first singles, the No. 5-ranked
Salzenstein avenged his loss to USC
freshman Cecil Mamiit earlier this
month at Stanford Tennis Stadium.

Salzenstein lost the initial set, but
rallied in the second and pulled the
match out in a third-set tie-breaker,
4-6,6-4,7-6.
At second singles, No. 24-ranked
Goldstein also won in a third-set tie
breaker, winning 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 over
Adam Peterson. No. 51-ranked
Thomas avoided the tie-break an
tics, but couldn't get away from the
three-set trend. He ousted Lukas
Hovorka 6-4,4-6,6-3.
At fourth and fifth singles, both
Wolters and Elliott lost to their Tro
jan counterparts. With only the
sixth singles unfinished, the match
score was knotted at 3-3. Because
USC has only five principle courts,
the sixth singles match could not
begin until one of the first five
matches had concluded. As a result,
No. 52 Becker's match against Fer
nando Sarnayoa began late.
With all players from both teams
watching, Sarnayoa battled Becker
through three sets before finally tak
ing the match, 7-5,5-7,6-2.
"I knew it was the deciding
match, hut I wasn't nervous at all,"
Becker said. "I was just happy to be
out there. I said to (assistant coach
John] Whitlinger, 'Can you believe
how lucky I am to have it all come
down to my match? I get to be the big

hero.
But with the opportunity to be a
hero comes the risk of being the vil
lain. The loss left the team, and espe
cially Becker, very disappointed. "I
feel like I let the team down, and I
hate that," he said. "We had a really
tough weekend, and I, personally,
feel really bad."
Saturday morning, a frustrated
Stanford team woke up to face unde
feated and top-ranked UCLA.
Matching up against the Bruins is
not the easiest way for a team to
break out of a slump, and the Cardi
nal wasn't up to the task.
Again Stanford failed to take the
doubles point. UCTjVsNo. 1 team of
Justin Gimelstob and Srdjan
Muskatirovic proved too much for
No. 2 Goldstein and Thomas, win
ning 8-5. Wolters and Salzenstein
won 8-4, but when Elliott and Beck
er dropped their second straight
doubles effort by a lopsided margin,
8-3, UCLA took the important point.

UCLA quickly ended any Stiin
ford hopes for a come-from-behind
upset. The Bruins won at second,
third and fifth singles in straight sets
to clinch the match.
In the feature match of the day,
No. 3 Gimelstob beat Salzenstein at
first singles, 5-7,6-4,6-2. The sopho
more standout from New Jersey ap
pears to have Salzenstein's number;
lie has won all three of their encoun
ters this year.
In its three matches against
UCIA this season, the Cardinal is a
combined 0-9 in the first-through
third singles matches. If the team is
to have any real chance at knocking
off the Bruins in the NCAAs, that
statistic will have to change.
The Cardinal ended the regular
season with a second place finish in
the Pac-10. The men will now most
likely be seeded third or fourth in the
NCAA tournament, depending on
how other top schools wrap up their
seasons.
