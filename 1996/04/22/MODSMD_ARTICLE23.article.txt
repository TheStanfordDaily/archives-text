# Men's tennis gets tripped up in L.A.
## 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
To ensure a seeding no worse
than second in the NCAA tourna
ment, men's tennis coach Dick
Gould said his team needed to win at
least one match over the weekend.
Unfortunately for Stanford fans,
No. 7 USC (16-6) and No. 1 UCLA
(24-0) prevented the No. 2 Cardinal
(19-4) from locking up the sought
after second slot.
In Los Angeles on Friday, Stan
ford suffered a terribly close defeat to

the Trojans, 4-3. The next after
noon, the Bruins outplayed the Car
dinal on their way to a 5-2 victory.
Particularly frustrating for Stan
ford was the manner in which it lost
to USC. The Cardinal's biggest
strengths have traditionally been its
depth and its doubles. Yet, in falling
to the Trojans, Stanford players
failed to take the doubles point and
dropped the fourth, fifth and sixth
singles matches.
The Cardinal's top doubles team
of senior Jim Thomas and sopho
more Paul Goldstein, currently

ranked No. 2 nationally, eked out a
9-7 victory, but neither of Stanford's
second or third duos could pull out a
win. The 16th-ranked tandem of se
nior Jeff Salzenstein and freshman
Ryan Wolters lost 8-4, and senior
Ricky Becker and junior Grant El
liott suffered their worst defeat of
the season, 8-1.
Down one point heading into sin
gles play, the Cardinal battled back.
At first singles, the No. 5-ranked
Salzenstein avenged his loss to USC
freshman Cecil Mamiit earlier this
month at Stanford Tennis Stadium.

Salzenstein lost the initial set, but
rallied in the second and pulled the
match out in a third-set tie-breaker,
4-6,6-4,7-6.
At second singles, No. 24-ranked
Goldstein also won in a third-set tie
breaker, winning 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 over
Adam Peterson. No. 51-ranked
Thomas avoided the tie-break an
tics, but couldn't get away from the
three-set trend. He ousted Lukas
Hovorka 6-4,4-6,6-3.
At fourth and fifth singles, both
