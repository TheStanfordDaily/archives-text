# Rugby beats Davis to advance to Final Four
## 
### Neal Sweeney 
Continuing a string of break
through games, the Stanford
men's rugby team moved one step
closer towards an elusive national
championship by beating UC-
Davis yesterday, 37-18, to win the
West USA Regional and advance to
the Final Four.
Heading into yesterday's con
test against DavLs — the only col
lege team to beat Stanford this sea
son — the Cardinal realized that it
needed to maintain intensity and
effort through both halves and cut
down on sloppy play if it hoped to
earn a spot in the Final Four.
"We really wanted to avenge
that [DavisJ loss, especially the se
niors," said Bruce Kirsch, who
stepped in for injured starting
scrum half Shin Inoue. "We had to
play 80 whole minutes, stay hum

ble and focus on the basics."
Before a partisan crowd that in
cluded a small but vocal Davis con
tingent, the Aggies struck first
with a penalty kick to take a quick
3-0 lead. Stanford came back with a
try to take its first lead, 5-3.
Afler both teams traded missed
penalty kicks, Davis — helped by
poor Stanford tackling — broke
through the Cardinal defense and
scored a tiy but missed the conver
sion kick to go up 8-5. Stanford
came right back and was knocking
on Davis' doorstep, but the Cardi
nal men could not push the ball
over the goal line. They finally set
tled for a long penalty kick bv Dave
Warter as time expired in the first
half to knot the game at 8-8.
A determined Davis squad came
out fired up in the second half and

pushed the ball downfield, control
ling the scrum for the first time. The
Aggies scored but again missed the
conversion kick, settling for a 13-8
lead, as the see-saw battle continued.
At this crucial point in the game,
Stanford responded with 20 unan
swered points to put the game out of
reach. After another goal-line stand
by Davis, senior Jared 1 lopkins mus
cled the ball into the goal and, with
the conversion kick, Stanford took
the lead for good, 15-13. The Cardi
nal kept the momentum going and
stretched its lead to 28-13 with two
more tries and a penalty kick. The
Aggies added a late try, but it was too
little, too late as Stanford moved on
to the Final Four with a 35-18 victo
ry.
"Rugby comes down to who
wants it more, and in the first game
Davis just put forth more effort.
We're not used to being pushed
around and today we stepped up to
the physical challenge," Hopkins
said.

To get to Sunday's final, the team
first had to get by a tough UC-Santa
Barbara team on Saturday after
noon. The Cardinal started quickly,
converting on two quick tries and a
free kick to race out to a 17-0 lead be
fore a capacity crowd at Maloney
Field. Near the end of the first half,
Stanford took advantage of a fum
bled pass mid relied on its powerful
forwards to bully its way across the
goal line. The Cardinal added anoth
er try, and Warter hit all five conver
sion kicks and a penalty kick from a
tough angle to stretch the Stanford
lead to 31-0 at the half.
After a strong, aggressive first
half, Stanford seemed to relax and
lose some of its edge, as the Cardinal
let UCSB back in the game in the
second half.
"In the first half, we kept the ball
in forwards to drive down the field,
but in the second half we were look
ing forward to Davis and lost our
concentration," Kirsch said. "We
weren't hungry and it showed
through [on I dropjxKl passes, which
broke our momentum."
The Gauchos put up 19 unan
swered points in the second half,
consisting of four tries and two con

version kicks. The Cardinal was
plagued by sloppy play, fumbled
passes and a general lack of intensi
ty, but Sum ford pulled together and
managed to hold on for the 31-19
win.
"We tried to save our energies for
Sunday and were able to do just
enough to win," Hopkins said. "Our
play in the second half wasn't really
a concern because we knew we'd lx>
ready for Davis."
year in the Regional Finals,
SUmford lost to Cal in a hard-fought
match. This year, the playoffs were
reconfigured to allow two teams
from the West to advance to the
Final Four. With its win over Air
Force, Cal will join SUmford in the
Final Four May 5-6 in Colorado
Springs, Colo. The Golden Bears will
most likely enter as the No. 1 seed in
the West and will play the No. 2 seed
from the East, while SUmford will
face the top seed from the East.
If Stanford am get by the East's
top team, a possible rematch of Big
Game looms. Considering that
SUmford recorded its first victory
over Cal in 14 years this season,
the Bears will definitely have re
venge on their minds if that sce-
