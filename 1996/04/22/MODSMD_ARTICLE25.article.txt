# Men's volleyball sent home early
## UCSB ends Cardinal season in first round of MPSF tourney 
### Ed Guzman Staff writer 
For the second year in a row,
the sixth-ranked Stanford men's
volleyball team suffered a first
round exit in the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation tournament.
This time, UC-Santa Barbara did
the honors, polishing off the Car
dinal in four games, 10-15, 15-9,
15-13,15-6.
The Gauchos will advance to
Hawaii to face UCLA in the
MPSF semifinals next weekend,
while the Cardinal's season comes
to a close.
"After the first game, we found
it difficult to maintain our enthu
siasm," said freshman swing hit
ter Patrick Klein.
Before 1,255 home fans, Santa
Barbara got off to an early advan
tage in the first game, but the Car
dinal (15-8 overall, 12-8 in the
MPSF Pacific Division) soon
found its groove and dominated
the rest of the way. Led by an out
standing performance from Klein
and inspired play from junior mid
dle blocker Brian Moore, the Car
dinal spikers rained 27 kills on the
Gauchos.
"We sided out very well," said
Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves. "We got a few blocks and
disrupted their offense enough to
take control."

Suddenly faced with a one
game deficit, the Gauchos re
sponded with a methodically ef
fective attack in game two. Led by
senior middle hitter Amaury Ve
lasco and junior outside hitter
Donny Harris, Santa Barbara
committed only two errors on its
way to a sizzling .567 game-two
hitting percentage.
"It was our worst sideout game
of the match," Nieves said. "We
just gave up points in bunches."
The third game provided the
momentum swing that the Cardi
nal could ill afford to lose, espe
cially in a road playoff game.
"Up to that point, we had won
a game and they had won a game,"
Klein said. "If we had closed them
out in game three, we might have
seen a different result." Indeed,
the Cardinal regained the in
spired edge from game one,
putting down 46 kills, more than
the first two games combined. But
after staking a 13-8 lead, ill-timed
Cardinal hitting errors began tak
ing their toll, as the Gauchos over
came the deficit and stole a game
three victory.
The shock from the third
game debacle was telling in Stan
ford's play during game four. The
men made just 22 kills in 52 hit
ting attempts while committing
