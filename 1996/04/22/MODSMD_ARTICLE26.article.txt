# Africa Week to focus on 'Africa 2020'
## Keynote speaker Ras-Work will address tradition, women's issues and human rights

The 17th annual Africa Week commences
today, featuring speeches, panel discussions,
traditional music and dancing and authentic
East and West African cuisine.
The week's events explore the theme, "Africa
2020." The topic was chosen because the orga
nization felt there is a "crisis of vision in Africa,"
said graduate student Eleni Gabre-Madhin,
president of the Stanford African Students As
sociation, which is the sponsoring the week.
A campus organization since 1979, the asso
ciation continues to work to effect increased
awareness of African issues and the African
presence on the Stanford campus.
Although the leaders of the 1960s indepen
dence struggles throughout the continent were
youths, today Africa is lacking such leaders,
Gabre-Madhin said. "We want to challenge
students with envisioning a new Africa," she
said.
The association hopes the week will stimu
late discourse on the Stanford campus so that
students will begin discussing and debating
current issues facing Africa. Gabre-Madhin
said she hopes the increased awareness will
foster a need for a manifesto or statement by

African-American Stanford students detailing
what they learned this week.

'We've gotten a lot of support
from various offices and de
partments on campus. They've
contributed funds to help
make this week possible.'

Africa Week is just one way the association
tries to involve Stanford students in African is
sues, said Gabre-Madhin. "A world-class uni
versity like Stanford needs a program like
this," she said.
A keynote speech delivered in Building 160
tonight by President of the Inter-African Com
mittee Berhane Ras-Work will address tradi
tional practices, women and human rights.
Graduate student Eric Phelts of the Africa
Week publicity committee said this week's
events are trying to project new positive im

ages of Africa rather than repeating the old
problems. "We hope to integrate solutions to
the things Ras-Work brings up — issues con
cerning women, children and health," he
said.
Phelts said the week is targeting anybody
who is interested in Africa — not just African-
Americans. "We want to learn about Africa and
Africans," he said, adding the week will be "a
celebration of Africa."
The Diamano Coura dance company, which
is performing Thursday at the Elliott Program
Center, is an example of the kind of cultural
celebration for which Africa Week stands. Also,
Phelts said the Saturday evening Traditional
Africa Night in Tresidder Union's Oak Lounge
should be an exciting culmination of a week of
learning and exploration.
"Hopefully Saturday night will wrap up the
ideas of Africa Week, " said Gabre-Madhin,
who hopes all will share in the excitement of
the week. She is excited to see the turnout of
Stanford students and Bay Area citizens
throughout the week.
"We've gotten a lot of support from various
offices and departments on campus," she said.
"They've contributed funds to help make this
week possible."
