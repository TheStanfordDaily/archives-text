## Grad student Stein receives honorable mention 
### Swaroop Mishra 
Asst. Physics Prof. Charles Marcus has been se
lected aa the first recipient of the ASSU Teaching
Award by a five-student committee which lauded both
his "enthusiasm" and his "excellent communication
style." Teaching assistant and School of Education
graduate student Sandra Stein received an honorable
mention.
Marcus is the professor for Physics 61, 63 and 65,
the advanced freshman physics series. Marcus was se
lected from about 25 nominations submitted on an
ASSU World Wide Web page in the fall, according to
senior Julian Castro, an ASSU undergraduate sena
tor and the chair of the five-person selection commit
tee that reviewed the nominations.
"If I know anything about teaching, I learned it
from the people around me," Marcus said.
Marcus arrived at teaching in a somewhat round
about fashion, he said. His love for research original
ly drove him to study physics. He received his bache
lor's degree in physics from Stanford in 1984 before
studying as a graduate student and postdoctoral fel
low at Harvard University.
He returned to Stanford as a faculty member in
1992, having settled on working as a professor be
cause it included the opportunity to perform basic re
search. "I'm a professor," he said, "and teaching is a
part of that."
Teaching, however, "has turned out to be one of
the pleasures" of Marcus* occupation, he said. He
stressed that "it's a really hard job," as professors
may spend six or eight hours preparing a single lec
ture.
Despite the heavy work schedule, Marcus truly en
joys leaching, in part because of its theatrical nature.
"It's like being an actor, but you get to make up
your own lines," lie said.
Marcus also credited a hardworking faculty and
highly motivated students for the joy he finds in
teaching. Among those are "the students who have re
ally worked diligently in my lab," he said.
Marcus said listening — to students as well as to
himself — is an important facet of good teaching.
While lecturing, he said, it is important to pause and
think, "Could a person understand that sentence?"
He said the way in which material is presented will

have a impact on how well it Lb understood.
Sophomore A.J. Simon said Marcus treats every
one with respect and is an excellent choice for the
award
"He didn't seem to talk down to us," he said. "He
was on the same level."
A teacher who was "responsive to questions" and
used "apt analogies to everyday stuff," Marcus "un
derstood how hard the material was for students and
was able to tailor the course so we could learn the ma
terial," Simon said.
Freshman Brent Greenfield said Marcus "has a re
ally dynamic personality, and he's a really interesting
person."
"I'm really proud to have gotten this award," Mar
cus said. "But I have this funny feeling that comes
from being surrounded by great teachers. I really
think there are great teachers at Stanford and I wish
I could share the award with them."
Awarding School of Education student Sandra
Stein an honorable mention, the selection committee
noted her passion, open mindedness, accessibility and
efficient work as a TAin the school's "American Edu
cation and Public Policy" class.
Teaching, she said, involved "the most joyous mo
ments of my graduate student experience. My sec
tions were full of brilliant minds and diverse opin
ions."
Stein believes that good teachers are passionate
about what they are teaching and attempt to show
how the material is relevant. To her, teaching re
quires "really caring" about people and their learning,
development and growth.
Currently, Stein is performing research in elemen
tary schools for her dissertation.
Marcus will be formally recognized and will receive
a $500 award at the June 16 Commencement ceremo
ny, according to Castro. Castro said the award is es
pecially significant because "it was student-based."
"The AJSSU wanted to give the students a chance to
decide who should receive a teaching award," he said,
adding that the ASSU plans to continue giving the
award in the future.
The selection committee for the award included
one graduate senator, one undergraduate senator and
three students from the ASSU's Committee on Acad
emic Research and Evaluation.
