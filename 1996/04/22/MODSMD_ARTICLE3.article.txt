Stanford researchers are using toads to
learn more about how animals turn light
into electrical signals their brains can un
derstand.
Fred Rieke, a postdoctoral fellow in neu
robiology, is studying the first steps of light
detection by using toad photoreceptors to
model the process. Photoreceptors line the
retina of the eye and are activated in re
sponse to light.
"Both human eyes and toad eyes are very
sensitive photodetectors. In a dark room, a
person can distinguish between a flash of
light that contains two photons and a flash
of light that contains three. Our brains per
ceive the difference," Rieke said.
Photoreceptors from toads are good to
study, he said, because each time the pho
toreceptors detect light, they respond in ex
actly the same way. The electrical response

of the receptor reaches the same amplitude
and that amplitude correlates with the
number of photons in the flash of light.
"Thus, activation of a single photorecep
tor has a predictable consequence. The
toad's behavior toward light is similarly
predictable," Rieke said. "If a toad detects
as little as a single photon from something,
like a worm or a bug, he will try to eat it."
"This is one of the few instances in biolo
gy where we can trace the activity of a single
molecule and relate it directly to the behav
ior of the organism," he said. "The light ac
tivates the photoreceptor in a predictable
way, ultimately leading to the predictable
behavior of the toad, namely that it is going
to try to eat whatever emitted that light."
For these experiments, the toad's retina
is removed and kept in a special solution.
Then a chunk of the tissue is taken and,
using very fine needles, carefully teased
apart until the photoreceptors literally
jump out. The complexes can then be isolat
ed and sucked into a glass electrode. By
