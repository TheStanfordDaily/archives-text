# In the eye of the toad

Stanford researchers are using toads to
learn more about how animals turn light
into electrical signals their brains can un
derstand.
Fred Rieke, a postdoctoral fellow in neu
robiology, is studying the first steps of light
detection by using toad photoreceptors to
model the process. Photoreceptors line the
retina of the eye and are activated in re
sponse to light.
"Both human eyes and toad eyes are very
sensitive photodetectors. In a dark room, a
person can distinguish between a flash of
light that contains two photons and a flash
of light that contains three. Our brains per
ceive the difference," Rieke said.
Photoreceptors from toads are good to
study, he said, because each time the pho
toreceptors detect light, they respond in ex
actly the same way. The electrical response

of the receptor reaches the same amplitude
and that amplitude correlates with the
number of photons in the flash of light.
"Thus, activation of a single photorecep
tor has a predictable consequence. The
toad's behavior toward light is similarly
predictable," Rieke said. "If a toad detects
as little as a single photon from something,
like a worm or a bug, he will try to eat it."
"This is one of the few instances in biolo
gy where we can trace the activity of a single
molecule and relate it directly to the behav
ior of the organism," he said. "The light ac
tivates the photoreceptor in a predictable
way, ultimately leading to the predictable
behavior of the toad, namely that it is going
to try to eat whatever emitted that light."
For these experiments, the toad's retina
is removed and kept in a special solution.
Then a chunk of the tissue is taken and,
using very fine needles, carefully teased
apart until the photoreceptors literally
jump out. The complexes can then be isolat
ed and sucked into a glass electrode. By
shining different intensities of
light on the photoreceptor, the re
searchers can measure its electri
cal response.
A single photoreceptor is about
one-hundredth of a millimeter
across, which is large for a protein
complex. Each photoreceptor con
tains several billion proteins. The
most abundant protein in the pho
toreceptor is rhodopsin, and there
are 3 billion rhodopsins per pho
toreceptor, so the organism puts
much effort and material into vi

sion, Rieke said.
Rieke and others in Neurobiol
ogy Prof. Denis Baylor's research
group are studying other facets of
vision, such as phototransduc
tion. This includes the entire
pathway where light is detected
by a photoreceptor, converted to
an electrical signal and then trav
els through the optic nerve to the
brain. The optic nerve needs a
pattern in order to transmit in
formation to the brain, and scien
tists are looking at how the optic
nerve gets that transduced pat
tern.
Rieke works on the detection of
light, the input of the visual
process. E.J. Chichilinsky, anoth

er postdoctoral fellow in Baylor's
lab, works on the output step of
the process.
Chichilinsky studies 30 to 40
photoreceptors simultaneously,
looking at the pattern the optic
nerve actually encodes. More
specifically, he examines how
color signals are encoded in the
optic nerve by flashing different
colors and intensities of light on
bundles of photoreceptors and an
alyzing their response. The data
can be hard to interpret and many
questions are still unanswered,
such as whether the receptors act
independently when transmiting
the color pattern or if they some
how cooperate.
