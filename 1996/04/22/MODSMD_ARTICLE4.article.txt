# Activist pushes for change
## Corona urges grassroots organizations to bolster Latino power 
### Perry Chen 
Legendary union organizer
and civil rights activist Bert Coro
na spoke on the upcoming politi
cal and social struggles facing the
Latino community at Friday's
11th Annual Ernesto Galarza
Lecture.
Corona's speech, titled
"Preparing for the Challenges to
Latinos in the 21st Century,"

dealt with a host of contemporary
issues including politics, affirma
tive action, immigration law and
police brutality. In all these top
ics, Corona stressed the need for
Chicano / Latinos to organize and
act on the community level.
"We're trying very intensely to
understand our social system and
all its inequities, but that's not
enough. What's got to happen is
that we've got to change the sys

tem. What good is understanding
the system if we are not going to
change it?" Corona asked.
The essential question for the
Chicano / Latino community is,
"What can we hope to do in view
and in light of the terrible situa
tion our people are facing?" said
Corona, who currently serves as
national director of the immi
grant advocacy group La Her
mandad Nacional Mexicana.
Citing recent legislative and
judicial attacks on immigration
regulations and affirmative ac
tion, Corona said Chicano / Lati
no political participation is more
crurial than ever.
We're going to have to get into
policy determination more than
anything else we've done before,"
he said. "If politics is dirty, then
we have to get our hands dirty and
our feet dirty. We have to go in
there and try to clean it up."
Corona's prescription for cre
ating such a heightened political
involvement was two-fold. Citing
his own experience in the "Viva
Kennedy" campaign, he said
younger students in particular
"must work to get the vote out

and build organizations," adding
that "the only way to wage poli
tics is to involve the grassroots."
Corona also urged the facilita
tion of the citizenship process for
the more than 4 million immi
grants who currently lack citizen
status. "This stands in front of us
as the greatest opportunity for us
to increase our voting strength,"
he said.
With these mechanisms in
place, Corona predicted a good
chance for a Chicano / Latino
candidate to become either the
speaker of the assembly or gover
nor in California by the year
2000.
Regarding recent beatings in
Riverside County, Calif., Corona
remarked that the incident is just
the latest in that county's long
history of mistreatment of Chi
cano / Latinos. In hisopinion, the
heatings illustrate "another rea
son why we want to take some
control over our own fate by seiz

ing political power."
Held this year at the Center
for Educational Research at
Stanford, the annual lecture
hosted by the Stanford Center for
Chicano Research commemo
rates Ernesto Galarza, a Stanford
alumnus whose efforts as an edu
cator, writer and civil rights ac
tivist inspired many people to
fight for social justice.
Using the example of Galarza,
Corona reminded the students in
attendance that in addition to
being scholars who "try to get the
truth out and try to get the facts,"
they must also interpret and
practice the concepts they learn.
Corona said he was very hope
ful that "things can be changed,
even in moments such as this
when we appear to be set back
and attacked." He credited this
faith to the younger generation of
students and activists, whom he
feels "are ready for what the next
century calls for."
