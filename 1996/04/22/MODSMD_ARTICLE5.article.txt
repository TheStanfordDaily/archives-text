# Gardner Fellows announced

### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
The Haas Center for Public Service last week an
nounced the three Stanford students who will serve
as the 1996-97 John Gardner Fellows.
Graduating seniors Solomon Greene, Lisa Galle
gos and Nicole Vazquez will participate in the 10-
month public service leadership program jointly ad
ministered by Stanford and UC-Berkeley.
The fellowship, now in its 11th year, places out
standing undergraduates in public or independent
sector agencies. Each fellow will have a mentor who
helps guide their professional growth and develop
ment.
"There tends to be very little support, particular
ly for graduating students, for pursuing work in the
public service sector," said Greene. "The Gardner
Fellowship links up enthusiastic, energetic young
people to community-based work, which tends to be

underfunded in the face of increased demand."
Greene, who is writing a thesis on poverty and
homelessness in Atlanta, said he plans to use the fel
lowship to work on "changing models of community
development."
Greene said he is particularly interested in two
aspects of the study — namely "ways in which af
fordable housing can be integrated with the need for
economic development, rather than being at odds
with it, and ways to empower low-income communi
ties to have a greater voice in planning decisions."
After doing homeless advocacy work in San Fran
cisco, Greene said he realized that the conditions for
what is defined as "basic safe and clean housing" are
"pretty meager." His experiences working with
homelessness as well as his academic research led
Greene to begin looking into the roots of homeless
ness.
In 1994, Greene co-founded
Students Together Opposing
Proposition 187 with Lisa Galle
gos, also a Gardner Fellow.
Gallegos, who specializes in the
interdisciplinary study of race
and ethnicity in the American
.Studios major, said she plans to
use the fellowship to work at the
grassroots level with a multira
cial, multi-issue organization.
"So often students coming out
of an institution like Stanford
who plan on doing public service
work are expected to follow the
typical career track, working at
the federal level in Washington,
D.G. Unfortunately, that's the
only type of work that receives re
spect and support," Gallegos
gaid.
"I feel that resource allocation
and strategy for socio-political
and economic change are shifting
to the local level, and we need to
start working with communities
not for them but with them,
empowering them," she said.
Galleges was one of 1,500 vol
unteers in the 1993 National
Summer of Service, which she
said was a turning point in the

way she viewed her role in the
Chicano community.
Gallegos, who was awarded the
Ernesto Galarza Prize for Excel
lence in Undergraduate Research,
has been actively involved in com
munity and public service oppor
tunities at Stanford. She said two
things she found attractive about
the Gardner Fellowship program
were the mentorship aspect and
the flexibility,
"When people ask me where
I'm going to work for the fellow
ship, my answer is basically, 'Any
where I want,' " Gallegos said.
Vazquez has also been an ac
tive member in a number of com
munity service organizations, as
well as the ASSU Senate, where
she currently serves as a member
of the Council of Presidents.
Vazquez plans on using her fel
lowship to go to Los Angeles to
work on both youth development
and education in the inner city.
Her focus will be "building part
nerships between schools and
communities [with] schools tak
ing a more holistic approach to
ward serving children," she said.
Raised in urban Los Angeles,
Vazquez recognized the inequali
ty of educat ion in her community
at a young age. Because the local
school in her district was full,
Vazquez was bussed from her

inner-city neighborhood to a sub
urban school for six years and was
disappointed by "the disparity be
tween those two schools in the
same school district." Vazquez
said she was lucky to have escaped
the problems of inner-city
schools, but many others are not
so lucky,
"I realized that whore you lived
and your social class dictated
where you were educated,"
Vazquez said. "It's one of the re
sponsibilities for the government
in general to bridge the education
gap between children who come
from poorer areas and [those
from] upper-class areas. The dis
parity is unacceptable to me, for
people who live in a common re
gion to have completely different
educational experiences.
"Some say it's a natural com
ponent of capitalism, but I think
it's antithetical to the basic foun
dation of equal opportunity that
is a part of the American contract
with society," Vazquez said.
She said she looks forward to
the Gardner Fellowship as a
"hands-on experience of being out
in the world for a year, supported
by this network of Gardner Fel
lows."
"It's a great feeling to know
that someone is behind you in
your ideas," she said.
