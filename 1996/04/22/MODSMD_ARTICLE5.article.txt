The Haas Center for Public Service last week an
nounced the three Stanford students who will serve
as the 1996-97 John Gardner Fellows.
Graduating seniors Solomon Greene, Lisa Galle
gos and Nicole Vazquez will participate in the 10-
month public service leadership program jointly ad
ministered by Stanford and UC-Berkeley.
The fellowship, now in its 11th year, places out
standing undergraduates in public or independent
sector agencies. Each fellow will have a mentor who
helps guide their professional growth and develop
ment.
"There tends to be very little support, particular
ly for graduating students, for pursuing work in the
public service sector," said Greene. "The Gardner
Fellowship links up enthusiastic, energetic young
people to community-based work, which tends to be

underfunded in the face of increased demand."
Greene, who is writing a thesis on poverty and
homelessness in Atlanta, said he plans to use the fel
lowship to work on "changing models of community
development."
Greene said he is particularly interested in two
aspects of the study â€” namely "ways in which af
fordable housing can be integrated with the need for
economic development, rather than being at odds
with it, and ways to empower low-income communi
ties to have a greater voice in planning decisions."
After doing homeless advocacy work in San Fran
cisco, Greene said he realized that the conditions for
what is defined as "basic safe and clean housing" are
"pretty meager." His experiences working with
homelessness as well as his academic research led
Greene to begin looking into the roots of homeless
ness.
