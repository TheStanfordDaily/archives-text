# Stanford start-ups
## Stanford grads are contributing to the computer revolution 
### Mary Megan Peer Contributing writer 
With all the attention that's been given re
cently to Yahoo!, it can be easy to forget that
many other Stanford graduates are changing the
computer market.
At companies such as Immersion Corp. in San
Jose, and KartofTelSoft and Release Software
Corp., both in Menlo Park, Stanford graduates
are directly profiting from the work they did as
students.
Justin Kitch, who graduated from Stanford in
1994, was still a student when he established
KartoffelSoft. Kitch said he wanted to "make the
program I wrote for my honors thesis into a com
mercial product."
The building of KartoffelSoft with his class
mate Matt Harad was, Kitch said, "the most
challenging experience of my life. We started in
our houses, in our own rooms."
Now KartoffelSoft has 15 full-time employees
and spends more money in a month than it did in
its first year. Kitch described the company's
progress as "a controlled avalanche, snowballing
but also incredibly fun."
Fun is important to the atmosphere at Kartof
felSoft. In their cheery, colorful new office, staff
members can be found hard at work amid a bas-

ketball hoop and the red and blue
window frames.
Kartoffelsofl's primary project
right now is FUNdaMENTAL, a
programming language for chil
dren. The program is revolutionary
because it allows children to create
with multimedia on a large scale,
Harad said.
FUNdaMENTAL has been test
ed in 40 schools throughout the
country. Currently, the program
mers are working on revisions to
make it more accessible to teachers.
While FUNdaMENTAL has not
yet been introduced to the public,
the positive feedback from the stu
dents who have tried it excites the
programmers.
Such enthusiasm makes run
ning the company "a blast," accord
ing to Harad.
"While management does have
its chidlenges, we have hired great
people," said Harad. "All of the de
velopers here have degrees from
Stanford."
At Immersion Corp., Louis
Rosenberg, who earned both a
bachelor's and doctoral degree
from Stanford, also works with a
team that includes many Stanford
graduates.
Rosenberg said the concept for
Immersion's first product came out
of work he did for his doctorate.
The product, which will be released
to the public in December, is the
Force Feedback joystick.
The joystick allows users to ex
perience the physical sensations of
whatever they encounter on the
computer screen, said Rosenberg.
In a game, when users hit a wall,
they can feel the slamming sensa
tion of their rocket's impact with
the wall. Upon encountering
enemy fire, they not only hear the
shots but feel the jolts as they hit
the users' ship.
Rosenberg first worked with
Force Feedback technology while
doing work for his doctorate, which
focused on virtual reality, at the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. Force Feedback
technology was being used success

fully at NASA in flight simulators,
but the $100,000 price tag and a
machine the size of a dishwasher
kept it from being adapted for
everyday use.
Rosenberg said he realized there
would be a market if he could take
Force Feedback and "make it
cheap, run it off a PC and shrink it
down." In June 1993, while still
working on his thesis, Rosenberg
started Immersion to create this
technology, working with three
other recent Stanford graduates.
Almost three years later, Im
mersion has a staff'of 18 people and
has licensed Force Feedback to CH
Products, a major joystick manu
facturer. CH Products has incorpo
rated Force Feedback into its popu
lar line of joysticks and plans to
market them next Christmas for
about $140.
Force Feedback can also be used
in medical simulations. "Medical
simulation is used to simulate
surgeries, to teach surgeons on
computers rather than on cadavers
or animals," said Rosenberg. "The
problem with cadavers is that the
tissue is different and not all surg
eries can be practiced effectively on
animals."
Though Force Feedback is still
Immersion's project, the
company is also marketing the Mi
croScribe-3D. The Micro Scribe al
lows designers to digitalize an ob
ject by tracing around it with a spe
cial type of pen attached to the
computer. The image then appears
on the screen and can be adapted
and animated.
Game designers can make a
foam image of a monster and then,
in minutes, have a 3-D picture of
the object on the screen in front of
them. Micro Scribe has "jeen used
for games, TV commercials and
movies, including "Jurassic Park
II."
A third start-up company, Re
lease Software Corp., has already
established its name in software
sales across the globe, as shown by
the map on the company's wall,
showing sales from New Zealand to
Istanbul, Turkey.
The company's first product is
Auto Pay, which is software that al
lows game developers to release
their software over the Internet

and shut down after a specified
number of trial hours. The user
must pay to have further access to
the program.
Matthew Klein, the company's
president, is currently on leave
from the Graduate School of Busi
ness. Klein said he has been devel
oping software since he was 11
years old. One of his more recent
developments is a shareware pro
gram called Guy Friday. Klein
started tracking its use and real
ized no one was paying to use it. He
wrote Auto Pay to be a built-in
salesperson for products.
Auto Pay is part of a new move
ment of super distribution in soft
ware sales, said Klein. Currently,
most sales are made through cen
tralized sources, such as software
stores, which have a limited
amount of space and force con
sumers to come to them to make a
purchase. Super distribution will
make software available from
many different sources includinge
mail, direct mail and World Wide
Web sites.
Chip Hall, a 1992 graduate of
Stanford and a vice president at Re
lease, said there are many benefits
of Autopay for the software devel
oper.
"If a company such as Egghead
makes a software sale, they receive
50 percent of the price. If Auto Pay
makes a sale, we only take 15 per
cent of the price. It is virtually risk
free for the developers because we
only get money if Auto Pay makes a
sale," said Hall.
Auto Pay benefits the developer
in other ways, said Hall. Software
can be distributed inexpensively
through the Internet, and develop
ers do not have to worry about pira
cy. In addition, Auto Pay advertises
that it "captures impulse buyers"
because of the ease of the transac
tion for the buyers. The purchase
can be made from the buyers' home
computer or phone.
Now in its third year, Release
has a full-time staff of 10 working
in its office. The company's sec
ond product on the market is Au
to√üeg, a program similar to Auto-
Pay that allows users to register
software so developers am track
its use and provide assistance and
upgrades.

Stanford."
At Immersion Corp., Louis
Rosenberg, who earned both a
bachelor's and doctoral degree
from Stanford, also works with a
team that includes many Stanford
graduates.
Rosenberg said the concept for
Immersion's first product came out
of work he did for his doctorate.
The product, which will be released
to the public in December, is the
Force Feedback joystick.
The joystick allows users to ex
perience the physical sensations of
whatever they encounter on the
computer screen, said Rosenberg.
In a game, when users hit a wall,
they can feel the slamming sensa
tion of their rocket's impact with
the wall. Upon encountering
enemy fire, they not only hear the
shots but feel the jolts as they hit
the users' ship.
Rosenberg first worked with
Force Feedback technology while
doing work for his doctorate, which
focused on virtual reality, at the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. Force Feedback
technology was being used success

fully at NASA in flight simulators,
but the $100,000 price tag and a
machine the size of a dishwasher
kept it from being adapted for
everyday use.
Rosenberg said he realized there
would be a market if he could take
Force Feedback and "make it
cheap, run it off a PC and shrink it
down." In June 1993, while still
working on his thesis, Rosenberg
started Immersion to create this
technology, working with three
other recent Stanford graduates.
Almost three years later, Im
mersion has a staff'of 18 people and
has licensed Force Feedback to CH
Products, a major joystick manu
facturer. CH Products has incorpo
rated Force Feedback into its popu
lar line of joysticks and plans to
market them next Christmas for
about $140.
Force Feedback can also be used
in medical simulations. "Medical
simulation is used to simulate
surgeries, to teach surgeons on
computers rather than on cadavers
or animals," said Rosenberg. "The
problem with cadavers is that the
tissue is different and not all surg
eries can be practiced effectively on
animals."
Though Force Feedback is still
Immersion's project, the
company is also marketing the Mi
croScribe-3D. The Micro Scribe al
lows designers to digitalize an ob
ject by tracing around it with a spe
cial type of pen attached to the
computer. The image then appears
on the screen and can be adapted
and animated.
Game designers can make a
foam image of a monster and then,
in minutes, have a 3-D picture of
the object on the screen in front of
them. Micro Scribe has "jeen used
for games, TV commercials and
movies, including "Jurassic Park
II."
A third start-up company, Re
lease Software Corp., has already
established its name in software
sales across the globe, as shown by
the map on the company's wall,
showing sales from New Zealand to
Istanbul, Turkey.
The company's first product is
Auto Pay, which is software that al
lows game developers to release
their software over the Internet

and shut down after a specified
number of trial hours. The user
must pay to have further access to
the program.
Matthew Klein, the company's
president, is currently on leave
from the Graduate School of Busi
ness. Klein said he has been devel
oping software since he was 11
years old. One of his more recent
developments is a shareware pro
gram called Guy Friday. Klein
started tracking its use and real
ized no one was paying to use it. He
wrote Auto Pay to be a built-in
salesperson for products.
Auto Pay is part of a new move
ment of super distribution in soft
ware sales, said Klein. Currently,
most sales are made through cen
tralized sources, such as software
stores, which have a limited
amount of space and force con
sumers to come to them to make a
purchase. Super distribution will
make software available from
many different sources includinge
mail, direct mail and World Wide
Web sites.
Chip Hall, a 1992 graduate of
Stanford and a vice president at Re
lease, said there are many benefits
of Autopay for the software devel
oper.
"If a company such as Egghead
makes a software sale, they receive
50 percent of the price. If Auto Pay
makes a sale, we only take 15 per
cent of the price. It is virtually risk
free for the developers because we
only get money if Auto Pay makes a
sale," said Hall.
Auto Pay benefits the developer
in other ways, said Hall. Software
can be distributed inexpensively
through the Internet, and develop
ers do not have to worry about pira
cy. In addition, Auto Pay advertises
that it "captures impulse buyers"
because of the ease of the transac
tion for the buyers. The purchase
can be made from the buyers' home
computer or phone.
Now in its third year, Release
has a full-time staff of 10 working
in its office. The company's sec
ond product on the market is Au
to√üeg, a program similar to Auto-
Pay that allows users to register
software so developers am track
its use and provide assistance and
upgrades.
