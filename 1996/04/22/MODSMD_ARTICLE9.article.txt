## 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
For fourth-grader Nirav
Prasad, the Community Carnival
Saturday could be summed up in
three words: "Fun, happy day."
The annual carnival run by
Stanford students brought more
than 100 elementary school chil
dren from East Palo Alto together
for an afternoon of game booths,
food, music, prize raffles and over
all fun.
This year'B theme for the carni
val was "Travel Through Time —
Look to the Past, Blast to the Fu
ture." The event, which ran from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m., provided the
children with free admission, free
lunch and free transportation.
"It's basically a day for kids to
come out and have fun with their
families," said junior Linda Pri
eto, who worked on the entertain
ment and booths committee. "For
me, it's a lot of fun just seeing the
kids have fun as well."
Dorms, fraternities, sororities
and other student organizations
sponsored an array of game
booths, as well as a variety of en
tertainment. Among them, 808
house sponsored a "Fun with
Food" booth, holding marshmal
low and sundae-eating contests;
Mirlo House ran a dunk tank;
Faisan provided a steady supply of

human-sized bubbles; Twain as
sembled an obstacle course called
"Travel Through Time"; and Uja
maa held a bean bag toss. Per
formers included dances by Ballet
Folkl6rico de Stanford and Jam
Pac'd, a cappella singing by Coun
terpoint and magic shows by
Bouncy the Clown.

Besides being a fun event, the
carnival was also an important
way to reach out to children in a
positive way, according to sopho
more Joseph Hsieh, carnival co-di
rector.
"We have East Palo Alto kids,
and for a long time East Palo Alto
has had one of the highest homi
cide rates in the nation. Children,
especially elementary children,
are going to be the most easily in-

fluenced, and the carnival offers a
chance to have fun — a safe, clean
fun. It's an event that the commu
nity holds for its children, which is
very important," Hsieh said.
"I think it's a good thing for the
kids to have fun," said Alejandro
Soto, an eighth-grader at James
Flood School in East Menlo Park,
who hopes to study at Stanford
someday.
Jaime Chang, the other co-di
rector, said she felt fortunate this
year to have "a great group of com
mittees."
"Everyone did more than was
required of them. They helped out
other committees when they were
having problems ... (and] took
their own initiative," even impro
vising different activities on stage
to entertaih the kids, Chang said.
Chang also said that although
fewer kids came than had been ex
pected, the smaller number en
abled the children to have closer
interaction with student volun
teers.
"I think the idea of a carnival
was probably one of the most in
teresting events I've participated
in," said freshman Rahwa Ghe
bremichael, chairwoman for the
entertainment and booths com
mittee.
"It was a learning experience,"
she said. "I hope I get a chance to
do it again."
