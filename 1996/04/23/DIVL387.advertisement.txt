April is the Crudest Month ...
Today's birthday:
You're everywhere this year, if your tarot card,
"Prince of Wands" means anything. You have
communication bliss. Words seem to flow off
your tongue and people are swayed by your
charms. This fall, be careful not to stick your
nose too far into the realm it doesn't belong,
others might declare you a peeping Tom (or
Tina). Your internship this summer blossoms
into full-time employment, if you let it. But
don't neglect the ones closest to you while you
chat it up with others.
Taurus (April 20-May 20)
It is not in your nature to express
yourself, but your partner may be
wondering what you're thinking, so tell him/her.
Gemini (May 21-June 20)
Don't make long term plans today.
You're not thinking straight.
Cancer (June 21-July 22)
112 J You have imaginative ideas spring-
N>s »— from your mind. Ignore those who
don't appreciate them.
Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)
Be careful not to brag today, Leo.
■Others will cut you down to size.
\ Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)
'You have a tendency to think that
"your crushes are "out of your league"
but it's your self-deprecation that's unattractive,
not you.
Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)
J Whatever libra wants Libra gets.
But be careful what you wish for. ..
Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)
's important to eat well today. Your
mediocre health is due to improper
*J>
nutrition.
a * v Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)
J Wriie down the witty aphonsms you
hear today. You'll want to reuse
them later.
Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)
( )
, 112 J Don't let the change in weather
you from your studies. You
need to get a lot done today.
Aquarius (Jan 20-Feb. 18)
If things seem strained between
''you and your friends, it's because
Saturn is crossing your moon-sign. Ride out the
roughness and things'll snap back to normal.
Pisces (Feb. 19-March2o)
'You are especially primed for a
"test/quiz today. Take it in pen, without
fear of mistake,
\ Aries (March 21-April 19)
You need another lover like you
a hole in your head, so keep
those eyes in your socket and stray not from
the one you know.
