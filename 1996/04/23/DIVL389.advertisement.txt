THE HONOR CODE
The standard for academic conduct for Stanford students is as follows:
A. The Honor Code is an undertaking of the students, individually and collectively:
1) that they will not give or receive aid in examinations; that they will not give or receive
unpermitted aid in class work, in the preparation of reports, or in any other work that is to be
used by the instructor as the basis of grading;
2) that they will do their share and take an active part in seeing to it that others as well as
themselves uphold the spirit and letter of the Honor Code.
B. The faculty on its part manifests its confidence in the honor of its students by refraining
from proctoring examinations and from taking unusual and unreasonable precautions to
prevent the forms of dishonesty mentioned above. The faculty will also avoid, as far as
practicable, academic procedures that create temptations to violate the Honor Code.
C. While the faculty alone has the right and obligation to set academic requirements, the
students and faculty will work together to establish optimal conditions for honorable
academic work.
