OPEN LETTER TO STANFORD STUDENTS
REGARDING JUDICIAL AFFAIRS
Dear Undergraduate and Graduate Students:
President Casper has commissioned the 'Committee of Fifteen' (C-15) to review the current Judicial Affairs process. C-15 is made up
of six faculty members, 6 students and 3 university staff members. The Office of Judicial Affairs is responsible for reviewing reported
violations of the Honor Code and the Fundamental Standard. A copy of each is attached as well as a roster of C-15 members.
In 1994-95 there were 9 cases of Fundamental Standard violations and 42 cases of Honor Code violations, in which the student
involved either admitted guilt or was found "guilty beyond a reasonable doubt". Common penalties included a 1 or 2 quarter
suspension, a 1 to 3 quarter delay in degree conferral, 40-80 hours of community service, required restitution and a $100 penalty.
We are very interested in hearing from students how they feel and what they know about the current Judicial Affairs process.
• One of the principal goals of C-15 is to make judicial affairs an educational process. What steps would you recommend to educate
students and faculty about the content and significance of the Honor Code and Fundamental Standard?
• As a student do you feel as if you have enough information on what constitutes a violation of the Honor Code or Fundamental
Standard?
• Do you think that students and faculty should be involved in reviewing cases of judicial misconduct and assessment of penalties?
• Do you feel that cheating is on the rise? What could the University do to discourage academic dishonesty?
• In your opinion is the Judicial Affairs process open and easy to understand? Is it fair? Is it confidential? Do resolutions occur
quickly?
• Have you or someone you know been suspected of a violation of the Honor Code or Fundamental Standard? What were your/their
experiences with the faculty/dcpartment raising the question? What were your/their experiences with the Office of Judicial Affairs?
The Committee of Fifteen is very interested in your responses to these questions as well as any comments you have about judicial
affairs at Stanford. We understand that you may wish to have your responses remain confidential. You may respond in the following
ways:
You may send email to Laurette Beeson (lbeeson@forsythe) who is staffing the committee and she will remove your email header
from the responses before forwarding them to the committee if you wish to remain anonymous.
You may contact Laurette at 5-2968 (private voice mail number) and arrange for a private, confidential one-on-one interview with a C
-15 committee member
Your responses will be considered carefully by the committee and are essential to understanding the impact of potential changes to the
judicial process. Please respond by April 30th.
Thank you,
The Committee of Fifteen
