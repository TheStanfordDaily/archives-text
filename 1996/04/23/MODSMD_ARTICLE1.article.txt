## Senior Janice Strong balances schoolwork, raising children 
### Jessica Lehman 
According to Janice Strong, if she
could put her opportunity to go to Stan
ford in a bottle and sell it, she would be
a rich woman. She never had any idea
that by her mid-30s, she would have
been married and divorced twice, have
gone on and off welfare and be taking
care of three kids while attending col
lege.

While she sometimes finds it hard to
fit in with the undergraduate communi
ty, Strong said she values her education
above all else. She will graduate in June
with a political science degree and then
go on to Stanford Law School.
"This has just been so beautiful for
me — being able to go to school," Strong
said. Education has enabled her to come
out of poverty and leave her role as a
homemaker, she said.

Strong said she sees education as the
key to freedom, acceptance and oppor
tunity for all people. As a woman and
mother, as an African-American, as
someone who has been through povertj
and welfare andes a future lawyer, sht
said she hopes to educate all people "bj
being an example."

Janice Strong, shown here with two of her children, Ashley, 9, and Joi, 14, will graduate in June with a degree in politi
cal science and then go on to Stanford Law School. Strong, who is in her mid-30s, did not enter college until about 10
years after high school. In the interim, she married and divorced twice, went on and off welfare and gave birth to three
children.
isn't Disneyland," said Strong.
"There are real people here."
Strong did not enter college di
rectly after high school because
she felt she could not handle it, in
terms of both academics and
racism. Before high school, Strong
lived outside the United States be
cause of her father's work. When
Strong enrolled in high school in
Boston, her classmates threw
racial slurs at her, and someone
once chased her down the street
with a bat.
"To have someone literally hate
you puts the fear of God in you,"
Strong said, "because you're
guilty of what they're accusingyou
of."
At the age of 18, Strong said she
did not think she could handle
more education, if it meant endur
ing racial torments. She also

thought she was not smart enough
to try to create a career and a life of
her own. She married a year after
she graduated from high school.
"That's the thing about
women," she said. "We're almost
taught that if nothing else, you're
going to have a kid. We need to get
that out of our heads. Women
aren't just baby-makers.
"I want to be an education and
a help to women because I felt like
my only out was to get married
and have kids, and that's what I
did," Strong said. Strong married
and divorced twice and gave birth
to three children, a boy and two
girls, who are now 16, 14 and 9
years old.
She spent several years manag
ing a preschool, which was attend
ed by many children who were
born addicted to drugs and many
children of battered women.
Strong said she helped these
women get an education and get
out of their situations before she
helped herself.

In 1992, after her second di
vorce, Strong became sick and had
to close the preschool. She re
ceived child support only occa
sionally, and she had to pay for
child care and rent. She said she
found herself "in the same boat as
the women [at the preschooll I'd
tried to help." She now envied
them, as she had always envied
educated people, lawyers in par
ticular.
The decision to change her life
was sudden, Strong said. "I woke
up one day in January '93 and I
said, 'I'm going to college.' " It
was the last day to register at a
community college, and so she did.
Strong earned her associate of
arts degree at Las Pasitas College
in Livermore, where she served as
student body president and did a
variety of political work.
Six months after Strong started
community college, she had to
choose whether to go on welfare or
not continue her education. She
went on welfare, despite the stig

ma attached to it.
Strong explained that with a
high school diploma, she could
earn about $220 per week, $175
after taxes. A baby sitter would
cost about $150 per week, and she
would need several hundred dol
lars for rent, plus she would need
money for food and clothes. "It's
impossible," she stated. "You
can't do it."
"You get static from society for
not being able to provide for [your
kids], yet you're doing everything
you can," Strong said. She recalled
using food stamps at the grocery
store. "You're glared at if you buy
Dreyers' ice cream. You don't de
serve ice cream at all. You're al
most less than human."
Strong said she believes welfare
should be changed but not elimi
nated. "The idea of welfare is not
the problem. The way that it debil
itates people is the problem. It
needs to be reformed, not eradicat
ed."
By continuing her education

and transferring to Stanford,
Strong was able to get off welfare.
"Hopefully, I'll be able to show
people that there is life after wel
fare," she said. She now divides
her time between schoolwork, tak
ing care of her children and man
aging the Cardinal Collection.
She said her children are very
"typical." The oldest wants to go to
UC-Berkeley, the middle to Stan
ford and the youngest wants to be
a movie star.
This spring, Strong was decid
ing between enrolling at Stanford
or UC-Berkeley for law school.
Unlike the decisions of most se
niors, hers depended a great deal
on what her children want and on
how much change her teen-agers
could handle.
"I'm not the only one in control
of my destiny," Strong said. "My
children are in control as well."
Strong said if she could go to
Stanford all over again, she would
get more help to learn how to sur
vive here and to become a part of

the undergraduate community. In
classes, she sometimes feels that
she has more in common with her
professors than with other stu
dents. "I love to talk," she said.
She said her complex life experi
ence makes it hard not to say
things in class.
Strong said when she first
transferred to Stanford, she did
not know about activities such as
participating in dorm programs or
becoming an eating associate. She
said she wishes she had asked for
help sooner. Her one wish left be
fore she graduates is to have lunch
with University President Ger
hard Casper, whom she said she
became pen pals with after she ap
plauded him for his support of af
firmative action.
In the future, Strong may
choose to go into child advocacy.
Hut for now, she's just concentrat
ing on graduating. "I'm crawling
to the finish line," Strong said.
"Sometimes I lie there in bed and
say, 'I won't make it,' but I will."

to try to create a career and a life of
her own. She married a year after
she graduated from high school.
"That's the thing about
women," she said. "We're almost
taught that if nothing else, you're
going to have a kid. We need to get
that out of our heads. Women
aren't just baby-makers.
"I want to be an education and
a help to women because I felt like
my only out was to get married
and have kids, and that's what I
did," Strong said. Strong married
and divorced twice and gave birth
to three children, a boy and two
girls, who are now 16, 14 and 9
years old.
She spent several years manag
ing a preschool, which was attend
ed by many children who were
born addicted to drugs and many
children of battered women.
Strong said she helped these
women get an education and get
out of their situations before she
helped herself.

In 1992, after her second di
vorce, Strong became sick and had
to close the preschool. She re
ceived child support only occa
sionally, and she had to pay for
child care and rent. She said she
found herself "in the same boat as
the women [at the preschooll I'd
tried to help." She now envied
them, as she had always envied
educated people, lawyers in par
ticular.
The decision to change her life
was sudden, Strong said. "I woke
up one day in January '93 and I
said, 'I'm going to college.' " It
was the last day to register at a
community college, and so she did.
Strong earned her associate of
arts degree at Las Pasitas College
in Livermore, where she served as
student body president and did a
variety of political work.
Six months after Strong started
community college, she had to
choose whether to go on welfare or
not continue her education. She
went on welfare, despite the stig

ma attached to it.
Strong explained that with a
high school diploma, she could
earn about $220 per week, $175
after taxes. A baby sitter would
cost about $150 per week, and she
would need several hundred dol
lars for rent, plus she would need
money for food and clothes. "It's
impossible," she stated. "You
can't do it."
"You get static from society for
not being able to provide for [your
kids], yet you're doing everything
you can," Strong said. She recalled
using food stamps at the grocery
store. "You're glared at if you buy
Dreyers' ice cream. You don't de
serve ice cream at all. You're al
most less than human."
Strong said she believes welfare
should be changed but not elimi
nated. "The idea of welfare is not
the problem. The way that it debil
itates people is the problem. It
needs to be reformed, not eradicat
ed."
By continuing her education

and transferring to Stanford,
Strong was able to get off welfare.
"Hopefully, I'll be able to show
people that there is life after wel
fare," she said. She now divides
her time between schoolwork, tak
ing care of her children and man
aging the Cardinal Collection.
She said her children are very
"typical." The oldest wants to go to
UC-Berkeley, the middle to Stan
ford and the youngest wants to be
a movie star.
This spring, Strong was decid
ing between enrolling at Stanford
or UC-Berkeley for law school.
Unlike the decisions of most se
niors, hers depended a great deal
on what her children want and on
how much change her teen-agers
could handle.
"I'm not the only one in control
of my destiny," Strong said. "My
children are in control as well."
Strong said if she could go to
Stanford all over again, she would
get more help to learn how to sur
vive here and to become a part of

the undergraduate community. In
classes, she sometimes feels that
she has more in common with her
professors than with other stu
dents. "I love to talk," she said.
She said her complex life experi
ence makes it hard not to say
things in class.
Strong said when she first
transferred to Stanford, she did
not know about activities such as
participating in dorm programs or
becoming an eating associate. She
said she wishes she had asked for
help sooner. Her one wish left be
fore she graduates is to have lunch
with University President Ger
hard Casper, whom she said she
became pen pals with after she ap
plauded him for his support of af
firmative action.
In the future, Strong may
choose to go into child advocacy.
Hut for now, she's just concentrat
ing on graduating. "I'm crawling
to the finish line," Strong said.
"Sometimes I lie there in bed and
say, 'I won't make it,' but I will."
