# Internet changes scientific research
## Stanford researchers develop chemical probe in an international project 
### Nancy Farghalli Contributing writer 
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare knows from
first-hand experience that the days of labora
tory research conducted in an enclosed space
are disappearing. With new technologies
such as the Internet, a different picture of sci
entific research is emerging.
For Zare, the Internet transformed a lab
project into an international affair that pro
duced a chemical probe with the potential to
lead to a low-cost test for genetic diseases.
This collaboration has advanced scientific
research into a new realm — the use of the In
ternet to conduct research on a worldwide
scale.
Stanford researchers joined the team last
June without ever meeting or seeing most of
the other scientists from around the world
working on the project. With e-mail, Zare and
chemistry postdoctoral student Maria Dulay
embarked on a project with scientists from
the United States, Denmark, Canada and
Sweden to develop a chemical probe that may
lead to the creation of this economical proce
dure that tests for genetic diseases.
"Through networking with this computer,
we did this project. We (the scientists) have
never all been in the same room together.
None of us would recognize all the people,"
said Zare. The team of scientists has just re
ported their method of scientific correspon
dence in the March 21 issue of Nature.
The brainstorm
The intellectual brainstorm that catalyzed
the research originated with Jaan Noolandi,
a theoretical polymer physicist at the Xerox
Research Center in Canada. While on sabbat
ical at Stanford in 1993, Noolandi worked
with Dulay to create a speedier manner to iso
late DNA, using a method called free-solution
capillary electrophoresis.

Noolandi traveled to Sweden and met with
researchers, Mats Jonsson and Bengt
Norden, who were studying capillary elec
trophoresis. Duringthe visit, Noolandi decid
ed to add another variable to the DNA isola
tion project: PNA, an imitation model of
DNA, created by Peter Nielsen, a biochemist
in Denmark.
PNA, or peptide nucleic acid, is a laborato
ry-created model of DNA. Containing the
same four amino acid bases that compose a
strand in the DNA double helix, PNA can
bind to DNA. Due to the nature of the PNA's
neutrally charged backbone, it can form a
tighter cohesive bond than a normal strand of
DNA.

The science behind the probe
Canadian researchers Lap-Chee Tsui anc
Julian Zielenski joined the project by donat
ing samples of DNA from people with knowr
cystic fibrosis mutations as well as contro
samples known to have no mutations on the
gene.
"The [cystic fibrosis] scenario is that some
people are more seriously sick, some arc
less," Zare said.
With the help of the cystic fibrosis gene
scientists at Stanford replicated a copy of the
single-stranded PNA molecule to match up
with the cystic fibrosis gene that has the
