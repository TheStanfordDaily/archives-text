This figure illustrates how the bases of a DNA mimic (which is called
PNA) bind to a single strand of DNA to form a PNA-DNA hybrid. This
hybrid led to an Internet collaboration between scientists from five
institutions, including Stanford, in four countries. The end result was
the development of a chemical probe which could lead to a practical
low-cost method to screen for genetic diseases. The DNA sequence
portrayed is complementary to the PNA sequence. This particular
DNA sequence represents a normal gene.
