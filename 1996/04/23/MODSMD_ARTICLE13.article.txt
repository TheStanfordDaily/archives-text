Judi Bari, a feminist who spearheaded the effort to
redefine environmentalism as a movement for cul
tural change, recounted last night her experiences as
a leader in the feminization of the organization,
Earth First!
The speech, given in the Psychology Building to a
crowd of about 50, was part of Earth Week and Her
story.
The reason she chose to become a part of Earth
First!, Bari said, was the group's philosophy.
"Earth First! was the only group willing to put
their bodies between the saws and the trees," she
said. "They believe in biocentrism, which means that
nature does not exist to serve humans as a little smor
gasbord for us to eat off of."
Bari said Earth First! began as a decent ralized or
ganization, but later opened to anyone who agreed
with biocentrism.
"The minute we combined the outspokenness of
Earth First! with feminist values, little did I know we
would spark a mass movement, or that I would be at
tacked and maimed and become a target of misogy
ny," she said.
Bari spent the bulk of her speech describing the ex
periences which she said resulted in her becoming a
target for misogynististic terrorists and the FBI.
As the movement of nonviolent biocentric protest
developed, violence against protesters escalated as
well, Bari said, describing an incident which occurred
while she was driving one day.

"I was hit by a logging truck that we had blockad
ed several hours earlier," she said. "Me and my friend
and my kids ended up in the hospital. We realized that
they would kill us, they would stop at nothing. I won
dered if it was fair to my children to go on with this."

'The minute we combined the
outspokenness of Earth First!
with feminist values, little did I
know we would spark a mass
movement.'

Later, she said, "I met people from Appalachia
who faced this kind of life-and-death struggle for en
vironmental organizing. And I realized we were pret
ty protected out here."
The violence against her movement increased, she
said, in 1990 while she was organizing Redwood Sum
mer, a nonviolent protest camp which was attracting
large numbers of participants.
"We called people in from all over the country to
engage in nonviolent protest to break the pattern of
violence they were using both against us and against
the forests," she said. "We allied with other organiza
tions, and it began to become clear that not only were
a lot of people coming, but we were developing the in
frastructure to handle them."
