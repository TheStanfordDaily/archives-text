# Bell Atlantic, Nynex defend deal
## Companies say $23 billion merger will help customers, employees 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Executives of
Bell Atlantic and Nynex said yesterday
that their $23 billion merger will benefit
both customers and employees by creat
ing more jobs than layoffs and providing
better, simpler service.
But opponents fear the industry is
undoing the 1984 breakup of the old Bell
System, which was meant to encourage
competition.
Some consumer advocacy groups
objected on the grounds that the deal
violated the spirit of the telecommunica
tions deregulation law passed two
months ago.
"The public was told the new law
would lead to new entrants in every
market and instead we are seeing the
same old monopolies banding together
to prevent competition from develop
ing," said Bradley Stillman, telecommu
nications policy director at the Con
sumer Federation of America.
New York State Attorney General
Dennis Vacco said yesterday his office
already had begun to review the deal.
"I find it somewhat ironic that sev
eral years ago there was a breakup of
AT&T, Ma Bell as it was called, and

now the Baby Bells are coming back
together," Vacco said. "We have to take
a veiy careful and close look at it to
make sure it's not going to diminish
competitiveness, especially for tele
phone rates."
However, Sen. Larry Pressler, R-
S.D., a primary author of the deregula
tion law, was optimistic the proposed
union would not discourage new local
phone competitors.
"I think that it will probably be good
in the long run," Pressler said yesterday.
"I think it may well prove to benefit cus
tomers."
The new Bell Atlantic, serving 13
states and the District of Columbia, will
have revenue of $27.8 billion, 37 million
lines and 133,000 employees.
Before its breakup, AT&T Corp. had
annual revenue of about $60 billion, 110
million phone lines and 1 million
employees. It's making even more
money today, with annual revenue of
$80 billion, 80 million longdistance cus
tomers and 300,000 employees.
But AT&T is shrinking with the
spinoff of its communications equip
ment and computer manufacturing

businesses. By the end of the year, it will
employ 200,000 and have revenue of
around $55 billion.
It had been clear well before passage
of the telecommunications reform that
Bell Atlantic and Nynex would merge.
They united their cellular operations
last summer and their discussions of an
outright merger became public in
December.
Investors had a mixed response to
news of the deal: Bell Atlantic rose $2.25
to close at $67.25 a share but Nynex fell
$2.50 to $50.50 in trading yesterday on
the New York Stock Exchange.
For now, for most residential users,
the deal will have no obvious impact;
most people will continue to have just
one choice for local phone service —
their existing Baby Bell carrier. The only
difference will be that Nynex will change
its name to Bell Atlantic.
Neither company now is seeking any
rate changes, nor would they until after
the deal is closed, a year from now or so.
And it will be several years before
AT&T, MCI, Sprint, cable or cellular
companies provide adequate competi
tion to the local carriers.
