# Israelis find new Lebanese target

BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli
warplanes turned to a new target in
Lebanon yesterday, attacking the heav
ily fortified base of a Palestinian group
in hills outside Beirut after 11 days of
focusing on Hezbollah guerrillas.
Secretary of State Warren Christo
pher, meanwhile, pressed ahead with
efforts to broker a cease-fire, meeting
again with Syrian President Hafez
Assad to present a peace proposal.
But, as Lebanon's Muslims memori
alized victims of last week's Israeli
bombing raid on a U.N. base in south
Lebanon that killed scores of refugees,
peace remained elusive.
On the 12th day of fighting, Israeli
air force jets hit a fresh target — a com
mand base for the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine. Like
Hezbollah, the Popular Front opposes
the Middle East peace process. The

Syria-based group has frequently
attacked Israel over the years but has
not been directly involved in the recent
fighting.
The choice of targets suggested
growing Israeli frustration over efforts
to pin down the elusive Hezbollah guer
rillas, who are largely invisible in the
valleys of south Lebanon.
The raid was the first in or near
Beirut since Israeli warplanes rocketed
Hezbollah strongholds in the southern
suburbs last Tuesday.
Fighter bombers fired at least eight
rockets into the well-fortified Popular
Front base in the coastal hills of
Naameh, just south of the capital, send
ing pillars of smoke into the sky. There
was no immediate word on casualties.
The Palestinian radicals are well
protected in Naameh by a concrete tun
nel network that periodic Israeli

airstrikes over the years have failed to
destroy.
Hezbollah said it fired 30 Katyusha
rockets — five rounds — into northern
Israel yesterday, and the group threat
ened to introduce new weaponry into
the conflict.
"Hezbollah possesses weapons which
it has not used yet," said Sheik Nabil
Kaouk, the group's southern comman
der. He did not elaborate.
On the diplomatic front, Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi was en route to
New York to address a special session of
the U.N. General Assembly today, while
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
traveled to Damascus, Syria.
"These negotiations will definitely go
on tomorrow and probably the next
day," State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns said after Christopher
met with Assad in Damascus.
