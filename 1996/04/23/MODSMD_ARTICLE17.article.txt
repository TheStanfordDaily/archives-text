Mitsubishi shuts down only U.S. plant
CHICAGO (AP) — Mitsubishi Motors shut down its sole U.S. assembly plant yes
terday and brought more than 2,000 workers to Chicago on buses to demonstrate
outside a federal agency that accuses the automaker of sexual harassment.
Blue-collar workers joined managers on the company-financed trip to picket the
offices of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Dozens of buses brought
the workers, who were paid for the day.
"Two, four, six, eight! We're here to set the record straight!" protesters chanted as
they walked down Madison Street. Police closed the downtown street for several
blocks during the 1 1/2-hour demonstration.
The EEOC filed a class-action lawsuit against Mitsubishi two weeks ago after
investigating complaints by 29 women who brought their own federal lawsuit in
1994. The EEOC said Mitsubishi management turned a blind eye to "gross and
shocking sexual discrimination" at its plant in Normal.
Business experts said Mitsubishi's hardball tactics are almost unprecedented and
may generate public sympathy for the company but probably won't affect the lawsuit.
"It's very unusual," said Professor Myron Iloomkin, a labor expert at Northwest
ern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management. But he added, "You can't
intimidate the federal government."
