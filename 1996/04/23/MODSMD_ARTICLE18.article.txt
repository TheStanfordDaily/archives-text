Casper must promptly
review and approve new
constitution for ASSU

LAST WEEK, Stanford stu
dents voiced a demand for fun
damental change in the
ASSU's structure by embracing
Constitution '96. Three-quarters of
those voting cast their ballots in
favor of the new constitution.
Still, Constitution '96 is not yet in
effect, and it may be months before it
actually replaces the current ASSU
Constitution. The passage of Consti
tution '96 was simply the first step
toward its implementation: It still
needs official University approval,
which will probably come from Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper.
Casper has often shown a laissez
faire attitude toward Stanford's stu
dent government. Such an attitude
is rarely harmful, but in this case, he
must act promptly and responsibly
to ensure that the business of imple
menting Constitution '96 can con
tinue as speedily as possible.
Constitution '96 is technically an
amendment to the existing constitu
tion; it must follow the process set up
for approval of constitutional
amendments. The current constitu
tion says that "A proposed amend
ment shall be adopted upon its
approval by two-thirds of the mem
bers of the Association voting on the
amendment and its acceptance by
the Board of Trustees." Trustee
approval is as important as voter
approval in the amendment process.
The same clause goes on to say
that "the Board of Trustees may des
ignate the President of the Universi
ty or other University officer to act
on their behalf in accepting such
amendments." In 1969, the trustees
passed a resolution specifically
authorizing then-University Presi
dent Kenneth Pitzer to approve the
current constitution, "with the
understanding that the President
will introduce a suitable preamble or

include other statements of interpre
tations or reservations as may be
appropriate." Pitzer took more than
five months to draft his letter, which
included a lengthy list of interpreta
tions and reservations.
In this case, it seems clear that
the trustees, even less concerned
with the temporal issues of student
governance than is Casper, will not
bother to formally vest him with
the authority to approve Constitu
tion '96. Rather, it will be assumed
that the trustees have permanently
delegated to him the authority to
approve amendments.
It is thus imperative that Casper
begin his part of the process immedi
ately. Constitution '96 calls for fun
damental change to the ASSU's
structure; in all likelihood, new elec
tions will be required to select a sin
gle president and, possibly, a new
senate. ASSU leaders — both cur
rent and newly-elected — must start
the transition to a new constitution.
This can only be done to a limited
extent before Casper formally issues
his approval. It is highly unlikely
that his approval will be uncondi
tional, and the ASSU's leaders need
to know what conditions and inter
pretations he will impose on the new
document before they begin setting
up a government under it.
At the same time, it would be
inappropriate for Casper to give his
approval too hastily. In 1969, Pitzer
listed 13 items in his letter of
approval. Casper is known for
lengthy and comprehensive analyses
prior to his public statements; to give
merely a cursory examination to
what will become the chief governing
document for the ASSU would be
disrespectful to the student body.
Casper must take enough time to
be thorough in his examination and
acceptance of Constitution '96, but
he must not take any more time than
is necessary to do so. Conveniently,
Casper is scheduled to meet with the
senate tonight; he should use that
opportunity to lay out a timeline for
his approval of Constitution '96. The
ASSU has a right to expect Casper to
be responsible in his handling of this
important matter.
