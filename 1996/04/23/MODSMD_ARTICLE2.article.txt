# Fee outcome shaped by population choice
## Request for grad student funds caused election loss for ten of 11 organizations 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Ten of the 11 special-fee
groups that lost their spe
cial fees during the recent
ASSU spring general elec
tion would have received
the money if they had cho
sen to solicit funding from
undergraduates only, a
breakdown of voting
shows.

Only two of the 30
groups which applied for special fees lost be
cause a majority of voters elected not to give
the groups their money. The other nine
groups lost because they failed to win ap
proval from 15 percent of the student popula
tion.
For the first time, student groups this year
had a choice to ask for a special fee from either
the undergraduate or graduate population, or
from both populations. The change was a re

suit of the passage in last year's general elec
tion of the Common Sense Fee Reform, de
signed to help more groups win special fees by
allowing them to target a specific population
of students.
Eleven groups this year elected to solicit
funding from undergraduates only, with 19
opening voting to both populations. All of the
groups that failed to win funding applied to
both populations.
In order to pass the 15 percent require
ment for undergraduate vote only, groups
need a minimum of 922 "yes" votes. For both
populations, the minimum number of "yes"
votes came to 1977.
