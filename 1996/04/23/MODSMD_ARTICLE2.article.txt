# Fee outcome shaped by population choice
## Request for grad student funds caused election loss for ten of 11 organizations 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Ten of the 11 special-fee
groups that lost their spe
cial fees during the recent
ASSU spring general elec
tion would have received
the money if they had cho
sen to solicit funding from
undergraduates only, a
breakdown of voting
shows.

Only two of the 30
groups which applied for special fees lost be
cause a majority of voters elected not to give
the groups their money. The other nine
groups lost because they failed to win ap
proval from 15 percent of the student popula
tion.
For the first time, student groups this year
had a choice to ask for a special fee from either
the undergraduate or graduate population, or
from both populations. The change was a re

suit of the passage in last year's general elec
tion of the Common Sense Fee Reform, de
signed to help more groups win special fees by
allowing them to target a specific population
of students.
Eleven groups this year elected to solicit
funding from undergraduates only, with 19
opening voting to both populations. All of the
groups that failed to win funding applied to
both populations.
In order to pass the 15 percent require
ment for undergraduate vote only, groups
need a minimum of 922 "yes" votes. For both
populations, the minimum number of "yes"
votes came to 1977.
A breakdown for voting for the 11 groups
that lost — KZSU, MEChA, Project Motiva
tion, Stanford Cardinal Broadcasting Net
work, the Stanford Solar Car Project, Stu
dents Against Genocide, the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization, Stanford Concert
Network, the Stanford Jazz Orchestra, the

Stanford Women's Collective and
Stanford Model United Nations —
shows that only Model United Na
tions would have gone without its
special fee if undergraduate votes
alone counted.
SAGE and Model United Na
tions were the only two groups to
lose by getting a majority of "no"
votes. Model United Nations actual
ly received just more than the re
quired 922 "yes" votes from under
graduates but still not enough to
overcome the 1,045 undergraduate
votes against the group's special fee.
The other nine groups received
more votes in favor than votes in op
position, but taking into account ab
stentions, they failed to garner the
support of more than 15 percent of
the total student population.
Current tallies show a total of
3,971 students voted, Elections
Commission Ryan Medders said. Of
that, 3,044 undergraduates, or 49.5
percent of the population, voted
while 927 graduates, or 13.2 percent
of the population, participated.
Members of groups denied their
special fee most often blamed the
loss on the small number of gradu
ate students voting.
"Graduate students seem apa
thetic," said Eric Gavidia, station
manager of SCBN. "It was very ob
vious that the groups that did not
get special fees had applied to both
the undergraduate and graduate
population."
Solar Car Project Financial Offi
cer Jeff Irwin said his group has
come to the same conclusion. "We
believe [the loss is] primarily due to
the lack of graduate students vot
ing," he said.
Ultimately the challenge is not
simply to win a special fee but to en
gage more graduate students in
ASSU politics, students said. But
with this year's election results,
graduate students are likely to slide
further out of the picture next year.
"There is a definite possibility
that groups will apply more to un
dergraduates next year," Medders
said. "They've learned the absolute
lesson, which is to win.
"It's kind of unfortunate because
graduate students are going to be

left out of this process more and
more," he said. "But then again
these students do want their fund
ing, and this may be the surest way
to get it."
The Senate Appropriations
Committee has the power to reject a
group's decision on which popula
tion from which to solicit a special
fee, said committee member and
Deputy Senate Chair Bill Shen.
A group such as the Stanford
Band, which clearly serves the entire
student body, would probably not be
allowed to appeal to only undergrad
uates for its fee, Shen said. And if all
special-fee groups next year decide
against soliciting funding from both
populations, some could be asked to
rethink the process.
Michael Clarke, financial manag
er of the Stanford Jazz Orchestra,
said his group will continue to askfor
a fee from the entire student body.
"We were like a lot of groups in
that deciding to go for both under
graduate and graduate votes hurt
our chances," he said. "But we felt
that we really served both popula
tions. We couldn't in good con
science go for just undergraduates."
One-quarter of the jazz band's
membership is made up of graduate
students, Clarke said. Because of
that and the variety of listeners the
group attracts, he said, asking for a
special fee from undergraduates
only doesn't make sense.
The problem may be in a failure
to draw graduate students into the
ASSU, Clarke said. "Generally, the
graduate students feel less a part of
the ASSU," he said. "They're more
resistant to getting extra fees for a
lot of student groups which they
may not take part in directly. ... We
hoped to be one of the groups that
could bridge the gap."
Michael Putnam of Model Unit
ed Nations said his group — in its
first year — has similar motivation
for applying to both populations.
Next year, however, will be differ
ent, he said.
"The reason we applied to both
populations is that we benefit both
populations," Putnam said. "We
know now that graduate students
don't vote, and next time we won't
make that mistake."
He predicted, "Any group that
wants to get a special fee next year
will apply only to undergraduates."
