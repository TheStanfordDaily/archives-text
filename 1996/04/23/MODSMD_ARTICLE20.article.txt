## Freedom for exploration 
### 
THE SUN WAS out for a moment
to greet the pro fros. The light
glinted off their hopeful and excit
ed faces. Then the rains came. Seeing
them persevere through the mist set me
reflecting. I thought about the many
paths that all led to the Farm.
My story begins with a conversation.
"How much does a reporter make?"
my father asked.
"Well, a starting reporter — if you're
lucky enough to get a job — maybe makes
$18,000 a year," I said. "You don't go into
journalism to be rich."
He was thinking that if he spent
$25,000 a year at Stanford, I should get a
job that at least earned as much. When I
came home, I found newspaper clippings
on my desk about rising tuition costs at
Stanford. My father asked how my
friends at UC-Bcrkeley, a public universi
ty at half the price, were faring.
Implicit was the question whether
they were getting more for less, more
bang for the buck, a bargain, a set of free
Ginsu knives, for their education. I tried
to judge on the basis of opportunity costs:
What were my parents were sacrificing —
financial security in retirement and a
mortgage-free home, in return for
how do you do a cost-benefit analysis on
intangibles? Was the true worth of educa
tion based on future wealth? I tried to
understand my parents' perspective.
"You can be anything you want, as long
as vou are successful," my mother said.

Comiortable.
Their story begins 30 years ago.
My father came by sea. My mother
came by air. They studied in the Midwest,
moved to golden California and sent their
three children to college. My parents
believed that education facilitated their
goals. As a scientist and as an engineer
respectively, my mother and father only
studied subjects which applied to their
profession. To get past language and cul
tural barriers, they needed to concentrate
solely upon their jobs.
As part of their success, my parents
gave me a choice. Hence, my anomalous
status as both an Knglish major and an
Asian. Inherent in that freedom is the
belief that I share the same goal of mate
rial success. They want me to take advan
tage of every benefit denied them. I'm not
sure if they realize yet that my English
degree does not automatically translate
into a lucrative profession. They have
faith in me to carry on their dreams.
Last summer, my mother led me into a
cramped Chinatown bookstore. She
walked past the poetry of Tu Fu, past the
stories of P'u Sun Li, and ran her fingers
over a series of brightly colored spines.
"My classmate, he wrote all these books.
He's very rich. They make screenplays
from his novels." She looked at me expec
tantly. I nodded to myself, and hoped she
wouldn't be too disappointed if my stories
— written for myself — had no guarantee
of commercial success.

The story begins long ago.
Maybe in the mists of time, wise sages
and scholars could contemplate, with no
cares except for the metaphysical. Even
then, Confucius had to worry about pay
ing for the tea. Though he struggled for a
government career, he valued pure
thought. Today, many undergraduates
perceive college as a stepping stone to
financial success. With that "pre"-view,
an education from a prestigious institu
tion is a worthy investment — money in,
money multiplied out. And yes, money
makes life sweeter. However, concentrat
ing on making big bucks invalidates all
that does not contribute to that goal. I
disagree with the perspective that always
looks forward, making the present mere
ly a means to an end.
A college education is unique from
other experiences in its focus on the indi
vidual. In contrast, the outside world
demands conformity. I am grateful to my
parents, and I want them to understand.
What I value most from my education is
being able to define my fulfillment.
Someday, I want to be able to send my
kids to the college, so they may create
their own traditions.
