## Failure of Collective's fee request is an affront to women 
### 
ALTHOUGH I AM a member of
the Women's Collective, I am not
writing this letter in that capaci
ty. Instead, I am speaking out as a Stan
ford woman who is deeply angered and
hurt by the actions of other Stanford
students, men and women alike. In
other words, my patience with the
"politically unconscious" on this cam
pus has been tested and defeated by stu
dents' decisions not to support the
Women's Collective special fee.
This is not the first time I have been
angered by the way women and women's
causes are treated on this campus. I
have been infuriated because most of the
professors in the Feminist Studies Pro
gram will never receive tenure and I

have been horrified by the fact that
whenever I have been taught by a
female, her name is preceded by the
words "Assistant Professor." However, I
can accept (though not willingly) that
this type of discrimination will occur in
what is still a relatively male-dominated
institution. But I had deluded myself
into thinking that women's issues were
finally being taken seriously by the Uni
versity when many different academic
departments volunteered to contribute
funds and resources to Herstory 1996.
I was ashamed when I realized that
this open-mindedness did not extend to
the students of Stanford University,
who are supposedly so well-educated
about human rights. I am dismayed

that men and women on this campus do
not feel that the Women's Collective's
contribution to the education and
awareness of Stanford students is an
important one. And I think we all real
ize what a sad commentary it is that
students are willing to fund school spir
it and not women spirit.
I have heard many students say that
we did not receive our special fee
because our activities are too specialized
and are not publicized enough. This
claim is oddly humorous to me, consid
ering that the Women's Center is direct
ed toward roughly half of the campus
population. And I refuse to believe that
most of you have not seen the large yel
low Herstory posters that have invaded

this campus. The fact that this is has
been called the most diverse, representa
tive and educational Herstory celebra
tion in years certainly could not have
worked against us.
The denial of our special fee is an
affront to the Women's Collective, the
Women's Center and all women on this
campus. I consider this act to be an
indirect and cowardly warning that
women are under siege at Stanford. But
I hate to disappoint all of you who
believe that you can subjugate us into
silence. No matter how much you ignore
us, insult us or refuse to fund us, we are
not going anywhere.
