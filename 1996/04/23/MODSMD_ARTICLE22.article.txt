# Withholding senior gift harms students, not the University
## 
### 
We would like to address some of the
issues brought up by Colleen Krueger in
her Wednesday column. Krueger says
that she will not give a senior gift
because she has already "donated" to
Stanford in the form of her payments
for tuition, books, athletic tickets, etc.
First, we would like to point out that
when you receive a good or service for
money, it's not a donation — even if the
good or service is overpriced. If this was
the only criterion, we would all be hon
ored as citizens of the year for our four
years of dedicated "donations" to local
bars, coffee shops and restaurants.
Nevertheless, Krueger brings up an

excellent point about the frustrating
costs of a Stanford education. Amazingly,
tuition only covers 60 percent of our edu
cation. Meals, tickets and books all pro
vide additional costs that are tough to
bear. Adding to the frustration, students
must pay for these goods, or they don't
receive an education. A senior gift, how
ever, does not have to be given. It repre
sents the one chance for a senior to turn
down the University's request for money
without any personal consequences. But
what exactly is accomplished by refusing
to donate a senior gift?
Does refusing to give a senior gift
make all the things we have paid for any
cheaper? Of course not: We don't receive
a Bookstore rebate upon proof of not
giving to the University.
Does refusing to give a senior gift
force the University to lower future stu
dents' costs? No — in fact, it worsens
the situation. Without our donations,

future students will face financial diffi
culties like above-normal tuition hikes
and program cuts. All the money raised
by senior gift goes directly to next year's
undergraduates; 65 percent of senior gift
revenue goes to undergraduate financial
aid. Without that revenue, financial aid
packages would be less generous.
Refusing to give a gift does not hurt
the faceless "University." Instead, it
hurts people who you see walking
around every day — underclassmen
and, this weekend, the admits checking
out Stanford.
Krueger starts out her column by
stating that she has had a "delightful
Stanford experience." That experience
would not have been possible without
the donations of past alumni; for cur
rent and future alumni not to donate is
to deny the same delight to future Stan
ford students. Krueger's refusal to give a
senior gift allows her to keep $20, but

more importantly, it gives her the satis
faction of turning the University down.
But it accomplishes nothing else, and
actually hurts future students.
If you don't give a senior gift because
you can't afford it, we understand. But
if you don't give a senior gift because
you want to spite the University, we
remind you that you are really hurting
future students, not the University, and
we ask you to reconsider. Rising academ
ic costs are a legitimate concern, but
don't pretend that the answers lie in
refusing to make a senior gift.
