Q m How does glow-in-the-dark stuff
work ?
A First, a little bit of trivia. Many
• detergent manufacturers add flu
• orescent substances to their prod
ucts to make things look extra bright and
white. The fluorescent material that they
add takes ultraviolet light and emits blue
light. The blue light counteracts the yellow
color of dirty old clothes so they look
brighter. This is also why your clothes glow
blue in the presence of ultraviolet lights. So
your clothes might not be that clean after
all.
Anyway, the scientific term for the pro
cess which causes things to glow in the
dark is phosphorescence. You've probably
noticed that fluorescence and phosphores
cence look quite similar. Stuff that glows in
the dark and things that are fluorescent all
have that eerie, glowing color under ultra
violet lights. This light which both fluores
cent and phosphorescent materials emit is
called luminescent light.
A long time ago, before scientists really
understood fluorescence and phosphores
cence, they thought they were pretty much
the same thing. They thought that fluores

cence was when stuff glowed only while
light was being shined on it, wh Teas phos
phorescence was when a substance
retained its glow for a while, even after the
light was turned off. Now we know that it's
a teeny bit more complicated than that.
To understand, you'll have to think
back to the time in high school chemistry
when you were studying electron orbitals
and energy' levels. Yeah, I know, some of
you have probably repressed memories
from that time in your life. That's all right,
if you just sit there and nod, no one will
notice.
If you recall, whenever an electron is
bound to an atom, it can only exist in cer
tain orbitals, which correspond to different
energy levels. Also, each orbital can only
hold a certain number of electrons, so as
electrons are added to an atom, they start
filling up higher and higher energy orbitals.
The same thing applies to molecules.
Molecules are much more complicated
than atoms, so there are many more ener
gy levels in a molecule than there are in an
atom, but the energy levels are still quan
tized. This means that electrons can still
only take on discrete energies when they
are bound to a molecule.
Let's first try to imagine the general
process of luminescence. We start off with
a molecule in its ground state. This just
means that all of the electrons are in the

lowest possible energy orbitals.
When a molecule absorbs light, it gains
energy. This change in the energy of the
molecule results in one of the electrons
being excited to a higher energy level. The
molecule is then said to be in an excited
state. Since the electrons would much
rather lie in a not-so-excited state, the
molecule needs to get rid of some of that
extra energy.
One way it can do this is by bumping
into other molecules and giving off energy
that way. Another way the molecule can
give off a lot of energy is for it to release
the energy in the form of a photon of light.
Usually, both processes occur, so some
energy is lost through bumping into other
molecules, and then a large chunk of it is
released as a photon. This is the lumines
cent radiation.
Since some of the energy is lost before
the molecule releases energy, the energy
of the luminesced light is lower than the
energy of the light absorbed by the
molecule. This is why fluorescent and
glow-in-the-dark stuff glows under ultra
violet lights. Ultraviolet light is slightly
higher in energy than normal visible light,
but when it is absorbed by the lumines
cent materials, the re-emitted light is
lower in energy so it falls within the visible
light range. Hence, eerie glow.
The difference between fluorescence

and phosphorescence is what happens in
between the absorption of light and the
emission of light. In fluorescence, nothing
really spectacular happens. The light is
absorbed and then the molecule pretty
quickly spits it right back out as lower
energy light.
In phosphorescent materials, though,
something else happens. As the molecule is
trying to relax by releasing energy, it falls
into something called a metastable state. A
metastable state is a slightly stable excited
state; it still has a higher energy than the
ground state, but is more stable than other
excited states. What makes a metastable
state special is that transitions from the
metastable state back down to the ground
state (the light-releasing transitions) are
"forbidden."
In this context, "forbidden" doesn't
mean totally impermissible. It actually
means, "very, very improbable," which
also means, "It might happen every once in
a while." And you thought science was an
exact science.
Instead of the molecule immediately
jumping back down to its ground state
when it is excited, it hangs around in the
metastable state for a while. This can last
from seconds to hours, or even days. The
molecule remains in the metastable state
until a forbidden transition occurs, and the
molecule jumps back down to the ground

state, emitting light. Hence, delayed, eerie
glow.
Q 0 Where do the holes in Swiss
cheese come from ?
A Since I don't have that much
• room, I won't get into the gross
• details of making cheese. Basical
ly, cheese is made by coagulating milk with
a collection of enzymes called rennet,
derived from the fourth stomach of calves.
The milk turns into curds and whey, and
the curds are taken and processed into
cheese.
Of course, this processing is where the
cheese gets all its characteristic flavors and
textures. There are many different steps
involved in processing the curds into
cheese, but at one stage, the cheese is
allowed to sit for a while to "cure."
Swiss cheese contains a kind of bacteria
railed propionic acid bacteria, which pro
duce carbon dioxide. During the curing
process, which can take three to six
months, the propionic bacteria produce
carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide
forms bubbles inside the cheese and give it
the holes. Hence, eerie holes.
