The Stanford women's water
polo squad showed that there really
is no "1" in "team" this weekend as
five different people scored in its
victory over UC-Davis.
"I thought we played one of the
best games of our season by fa,"
Nicole Glazer said.."We played well
all four quarters."
The Cardinal won 5-3 this week
end to hold on to its sixth-place
ranking and gain momentum going
into postseason play.
The teams held each other
scoreless in the first quarter. But
the second quarter was all Stan
ford, as the Cardinal defense did
not allow Davis to find the net.
The case was just the opposite for
Stanford, as it opened the scoring
with a goal from freshman Rachel
Best at the four-meter mark. The
Cardinal scored again just a few
minutes later. This time Julia
Baker came through on the coun
terattack. At the break the Cardi
nal held a 2-0 lead.
Stanford earned the lead it
would never relinquish in the sec
ond period, as the teams scored
evenly over the next two quarters.
The third period was highlighted
by two Stanford goals. Junior
Olivia Welsh took advantage (if the
counterattack and found the back
of the net for Stanford's third score.
Freshman Lindsay Tarn also
scored with a turn around shot
from the center. But the Aggies
matched these two goals.
The fourth quarter went much
like the third, but the only Cardinal
goal came from junior Alice Cath
cart on a player-advantage situa
tion. Davis again matched Stan
ford's scorinc efforts but could

manage no more.
The team provided just what
head coach Ben Quittner has been
asking them for all season — a game
with balanced scoringand tough de
fense. Quittner also received key
contributions off the bench from
Amy Hideson and Best.
"I think this is probably the best
overall game we have played all sea

son," Quittner said. "I had no
doubts from the beginning that we
were going to win. The team came
out with the attitude that we would
not be denied."
The Cardinal now just has to see
if it can keep this momentum going
into the national qualifier next
weekend.
"Our postseason play depended
on how we played in this game,"
Glazer said. "We really got our stuff
together. This will be an indicator
of how we will play in the postsea
son."

Adding to the importance of
the discovery, Zare said, "People
are dying of (cystic fibrosis] and
there are people who may or may
not be transmitters. We don't
know. The people don't know if
they are sick. Depending on what
we learn drugs can repair the ge
netic bases."
The next step
Genetic probes can be used to
discover if a person has a mutation
on a known gene. "What's exciting
to me is that there appears to be a
cheap means to test whether a per
son has a genetic defect, if you
know the person has the potential
to be sick," Zare said.
The potential of this project is
not for discovering a genetic probe
but for transforming the way re
searchers look at genetic disease.
"We have been playing Russian
roulette with our genes. Can we do
better?" Zare asked.
Zare said he thinks we can:
"Just getting a probe is not the an
swer. We need other medical inter
ventions."
As for the other workers in
Zare's lab, they said they are
hooked on the project. Dulay is
continuing research on the probe
technique. Currently, the probe's
main use is to test any genetic dis
eases where the mutations and the
causes are known.
