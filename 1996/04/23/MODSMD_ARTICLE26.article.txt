# Women row to win, men lose to Beavers
## 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
Under rough weather conditions, the
Stanford women's crew team squeezed out
a victory over Oregon State, earning the
Cardinal a second seed at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships in May. The
men's team rowed valiantly, but fell short
to the Beavers.
The Stanford women came into Oregon
State after a hard-fought victory over
Washington State last Saturday. After last
week's race, coach Aimee Baker expressed
concern that her crew might lose its inten
sity when the team traveled to Oregon. The
Cardinal suffered no such letdown as they
crossed the finish line at six minutes, 31
seconds — five seconds ahead of the
Beavers.
"I was happy that our team kept our
heads together and were ready to race,"
Baker said.
The women won despite rocky waters,
which caused the races to be postponed for
three hours following the women's novice
race.
"It wasn't our best row of the season,"
said junior Maria Klemperer-Johnson. "It

was a little distracting with all the delays."
The choppy waves caused the Oregon
State women's novice boat to fill with
water, eventually sinking the boat. The
Beaver crew forfeited and rowed their par
tially submerged boat back to shore. The ju
nior varsity performed admirably despite
losing by two seconds. However, the team
has improved dramatically since the start of
the season and has now become a more co
hesive unit.
The Cardinal men's team finished its
race in 5:57, just three seconds shy of Ore
gon State. The Beavers pulled out to an
early lead, which they extended during the
second 500 meters. Stanford could not re
cover, eventually losing by eight seats.
"I didn't see the fire there," said Stan
ford men's coach Wieslaw Kujda. "They
were very hungry, and we were not."
Stanford rowed in basically the same
fashion that earned them a victory last
week against Washington State but could
not conquer the Beavers.
"We established our rhythm too soon,"
Kujda said. "Tactically, they were a little
better."
The men's junior varsity also finished
behind their Oregon State opponents,

clocking in at 6:12, four seconds after the
Beavers came in.
The eight rowers on a crew boat must act
in perfect harmony to maximize their
speed. The rowers in the back of the boat,
called the stern pair, set rhythm for the oth
ers to follow. The four rowers in the middle
constitute the engine room, named for the
power they supply to the boat. The two row
ers in the front, known as the bow pair, set
balance for the boat and try to keep it stabi
lized.
"Crew is awesome because there are no
stars," varsity captain Rob Bigler said.
Both the men's and women's Cardinal
squads will prepare for Big Row against
California in three weeks. The women also
race this Saturday in the Miller Cup at
UCLA. Both teams have their eyes on the
Pac-10 Championships, which will separate
the closely matched schools in the league.
With the talent so evenly spread across the
board, the Cardinal squads will focus on
mental preparation to give them a chance to
distance themselves from the conference
pack.
"We've got a long way to go," Bigler said.
"We can get there, but we've got a long way
to go."
