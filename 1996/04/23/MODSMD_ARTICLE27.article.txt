# Ducking the drops
## Rain spoils softball trip

Stanford 4 0
Oregon St. 0 1

The Stanford softball team returned from
Oregon yesterday without the four Pacific 10
Conference wins they were hoping for over Ore
gon and Oregon State. Instead they brought
home one victory, one loss and two more rained
out games. The Cardinal (23-20 overall, 6-10 in
the Pac-10) split with Oregon State (14-23,2-10)
— winning the opener 4-1 and losing the second
1-0 — on Saturday but were unable to face the
Ducks of Oregon on Sunday due to rain.
Stanford remained in Eugene, Ore. until yes
terday in the hopes that the game would be
played then, but the weather was not accommo
dating. Following Pac-10 rules concerning can
cellations, the game will not be made up. This
marks the fourth time this season that a Cardi
nal doubleheader has been canceled, postponed
or moved to a different field because of the
weather.
The weather was not very obliging in Satur
day's game against the Beavers, either. Both
games were played in and out of scattered show
ers making playing conditions almost unbear
able for both teams.
"It was a very hard game," said head coach
Sandy Pearce. "We played through the rain. [In
the first game], Marcy Crouch did a good job
pitching | in those conditions 1, and Jessica Schul
man had a nice [second] game."
Pitching was a key factor in both contests for
the Cardinal, but perhaps more important was
the lack of offense. Stanford scored just four
runs in both games (all four in the first inning of
game one) and even outhit the Beavers 6-5 in
the 1-0 loss, stranding 11 baserunners in seven
innings.
"In the first game we put up four runs in the
second inning and got some big
hits," Pearce said. "But we only did
it in one inning. [In the second
game] we had bases loaded, no outs
and we hit two grounders to third
and popped out."
In the big inning, freshman
Michelle Acosta led off with a single
and was followed by Crouch. Crouch
hit a grounder but Acosta beat out
the throw to second. After a Cardi
nal out, freshman Shane Anderson
ripped a two-run double to put Stan
ford on the board.
Senior Lynn Anderson success
fully advanced the runner to third
and afterwards a Beaver fielding
error allowed junior Amanda Rente
ria to reach base. Freshman Jennie
Foyle and junior Summer Lee added
to the Cardinal lead with back-to
back RBI singles to score Anderson
and Renteria respectively.
Unfortunately for Stanford, that
was to be the end of the offensive
drive as Oregon State held the Car
dinal scoreless for the next 12 in
nings. The Beavers did not fare
much better at the plate but man
aged to put one run on the board in
the seventh inning of both games.
However, the loneOSU tally proved
to be enough for the win in the fi
nale.
" I n the second game we didn't get
our hits at the right time," Renteria
said. "Defensively we played well
and our pitching was really good.
The difference in the first and sec
ond games was that [in the second)
we didn't put our hits together at the
right time."
Stanford managed just three
extra base hits in both games (An
derson, Renteria and freshman
Kelly Yablonski each doubled in
game one), no player had more than
two hits for the day.
"In the Pac-10 it always comes
down to hitting," Pearce said. "It's
disappointing because the whole
team knew that we were a better
team than [Oregon State]. We felt
we should have taken both
games."
