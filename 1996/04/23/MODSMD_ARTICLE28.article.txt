# Spring fever?
## Cuza dwells on draft, Dawes and doldrums 
### 
It's springtime. The sun is
shining, birds are singing, the
season is winding down for
most spring sports — and I'm
starting to run low on column
ideas.
Thus, with no burning issue to
proselytize about this week, I'll
take this opportunity to catch you
up on what's been happening in
the great world of sports — both
on campus and beyond:
NCAA championship up
date: Okay, okay — I know the
end of the school year is looming
just around the corner and you're
getting antsy about the conspicu
ous absence of NCAA trophies in
Arrillaga. Thus far, only the
women's swimming squad has
brought home a title, but you can
do something to change that this
week. The NCAA men's gymnas
tics championships run Thursday
through Saturday in Maples
Pavilion, so get out there and sup
port the defending champs.
Meanwhile, the women kick off
the NCAA championships this
Thursday at Alabama.
Stanford-bound: Nineteen
year-old Dominique Dawes, who
will attend Stanford in the fall
after deferring enrollment for two
years, won a bronze medal on the
balance beam on Saturday in the
World Gymnastics Champi
onships in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Dawes will compete in the
Olympic trials this June in
Boston.
NFL draft: Good luck to Stan
ford offensive lineman Jeff Buck
ey, who was selected in the sev
enth round of Sunday's NFL draft
by the Miami Dolphins. . . .Mean
while, condolences to quarterback
Mark Butterfield, who celebrated
his selection in the draft after see
ing his name on an ESPN2
"crawl" graphic that listed him as
the Green Bay Packers' third
round draft pick. Only problem
was, the graphic listed Nebraska
cornerback Tyrone Williams the
next time around. Fortunately,
Butterfield was picked up by the
Arizona Cardinals after going un
chosen through seven rounds.
NCAA championship up
date, Part II: Both men's and
women's tennis looked like front
runners for the national title at
the beginning of the year. But the
men have fallen to UCLA three
times and were upset this past
weekend at USC. Nonetheless,
don't count them out yet — the

Cardinal can beat any team (in
cluding the Bruins) on any given
day. They'll get a chance to prove
themselves at NCAAs next month
in Athens, Ga.
Meanwhile, the Stanford
women continue to steamroll
their opposition. Their only loss of
the season came at the hands of
No. 1 Florida two months ago at
the Rolex Indoors. A possible re
match looms at NCAAs in Talla
hassee from May 10-19.

And while we're on the topic,
good luck to the Stanford men's
rugby team, which heads to Col
orado Springs, Colo, next month
for the Final Four. The Cardinal
has a realistic shot at the title this
year after beating five-time de
fending national champion Cal
this season for the first time in 14
years.
NBA beat: And now on to the
world of professional sports ...
No. 1 reason the Chicago Bulls will
cruise to an NBA title next month
— Michael, Scottie, Dennis and
Co. lost just two games at home
this season. With home-court ad
vantage throughout the playoffs,
the Bulls should have no problem
capturing their fourth title in six
years.
Relocation update: It looks
like the Seattle Seahawks might
not be headed to sunny Southern
California after all. Owner Ken
Behring and Microsoft co-founder
Paul Allen have reached an agree
ment in principle for Allen to take
an option to buy the team. Mean
while, Los Angeles Dodger owner
Peter O'Malley will announce in
June that he will proceed with
plans to build a new football stadi
um adjacent to Dodger Stadium
and lobby for an expansion team if
all goes well with a feasibility
study.... Did someone say pro
football? The World League of
American Football opened the
1996 season last week. And hey,
less than four months until the
