# Rush deemed success despite low numbers

Despite a perceived low turnout for this
year's Fraternity Rush, most fraternities said
they were satisfied with the size of their pledge
classes.
Some fraternities saw a decrease in Rush
participation, but others said they had more
Rushees this year than in previous years.
"Across the board, it seems there was a
smaller Rush this year," said Chris Serjak, a
member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. "Per
haps this is due to recent problems fraterni
ties have been having with the University, and
how fraternities have come under fire from
the University."

In the past year three of 10 housed frater
nities have lost their houses.
According to Serjak, the Delts, who lost
their house in January due to financial mis
management, had difficulty getting organized
this year without having the benefit of a
house. Nevertheless, the Delts passed out bids
to 20 Rushees and are estimating a pledge
class of between 10 and 15 members.
Theta Delta Chi also noticed a lower num
ber of Rushees this year, but according to
Theta Delt Rush Co-Chair lan Rhodes, the
men who were rushing seemed more serious
about joining a fraternity than usual. The
Theta Delts offered 27 bids and are anticipat-
ing about 22 to 25 pledges.
Kappa Sigma offered 20 bids and
has 18 new pledges. "It seemed
liked the numbers were decreased,
but in the end, it was fine," said
Adam Gopin, a Kappa Sig. Gopin
said he was not sure why fewer peo
ple went through Rush. Lagging
student interest might be one rea
son, he said.
Kappa Alpha also experienced
lower numbers and will be unable to
regain its house next year. KA
members, who handed out 13 bids,

are still happy with the results and
think they are gaining momentum,
according to KA Rush Co-Chair Joe
Chang.
"We didn't want to compromise
the integrity of the chapter just to
get the house," Chang said.
In contrast, some fraternities ex
perienced the same or higher num
bers of Rushees this year. Sigma
Alpha Epsilon anticipates 25
pledges, Phi Delta Theta expects 15
new members, and Sigma Chi has
16 new pledges.
Sigma Phi Epsilon, an unhoused
fraternity, had its most successful
Rush in three years, according to
Sig Ep President Matt Parsons. Sig
Ep handed out 22 bids and is hoping

for around 20 new pledges.
Sigma Nu, which is also un
housed, anticipates a larger-than
usual pledge class as well, according
to Sigma Nu President Ryan Craig.
The Sigma Nus gave out 19 bids.
" Rush was successful for us and
definitely what we were hoping
for," Craig said. "A lot of our se
niors are graduating, and we need
ed to replenish our numbers."
Rush in general ran smoothly
this year, according to Phil McClen
don, a member of Phi Kappa Psi.
The Interfraternity Council"was
more together and more unified on
running Rush together as a whole,"
McClendon said. "Things were
more organized."
