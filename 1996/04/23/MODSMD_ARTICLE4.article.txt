### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
The University Board of Trustees re
cently announced the election of Mari
Baker to fill a vacant position.
The position was left vacant last Feb
ruary when Mariann Byerwalter resigned
to become the University's chief financial
officer.
Baker, Class of '85, will serve as one of

eight trustees nominated by Stanford
alumni.
Baker said she is looking forward to
giving something back to her alma mater
at her first board meeting in June.
"Attending Stanford was a pivotal mo
ment in my life," she explained. "The
growth that Stanford offered me was key
in shaping my future. Now I'm trying to
provide a way, using my talents, to con
tribute back to Stanford."

Earlier this month, Baker became the
vice president and general manger of the
financial supplies group at Intuit, Inc., in
Mountain View. Her past positions in
clude vice president of the international
division for Intuit from 1994 to 1996 and
director of product management for per
sonal products from 1989 to 1993.
Through an application and interview
process the board selected Baker because
of the experience she can bring to the job,

according to Jane Lane, special assistant
to the board.
"She is very good at strategic planning,
product definition and promotion," Lane
said. Baker developed the uses of Quicken
financial management software so effec
tively that Intuit's sales soared from $5
million to $70 million in just two years,
Lane added.
"I'm very pleased she is avail
able and eager to serve," Alumni
Association President Bill Stone
said. "I'm confident she'll bean ef
fective trustee."
Drawing from Baker's experi
ences, Stone said she won the nom
ination due to three main factors.
"First, she is informed about
technology issues of today and can
apply them in an academic and
computer context," he said. "Sec
ond, she is experienced in market -

ing and can offer advice to fund
raising programs. Third, she is
close by so she can get oriented
quickly."
Majoring in economics and soci
ology, Baker was active in dorm
government positions and intra
mural sports while a student at
Stanford. She also helped lead a
Catholic organization at the New
man Center, was a peer counselor
at The Bridge and managed the
ASSU T-shirt shop.
Pointing to Baker's Stanford ca
reer, Lane added that she has a
"good background for understand
ing student experiences. She is
very interested in giving back to

Stanford because of all she gained
as a student here."
Baker has already implemented
a summer internship program at
Intuit specifically for students in
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business.
"I'm so excited to have the op
portunity to be closely involved
with the University again," Baker
said. "I want to encourage students
at Stanford to make the most of
their time at the University and
look for ways to get involved in
keeping the University great."
