The University Board of Trustees re
cently announced the election of Mari
Baker to fill a vacant position.
The position was left vacant last Feb
ruary when Mariann Byerwalter resigned
to become the University's chief financial
officer.
Baker, Class of '85, will serve as one of

eight trustees nominated by Stanford
alumni.
Baker said she is looking forward to
giving something back to her alma mater
at her first board meeting in June.
"Attending Stanford was a pivotal mo
ment in my life," she explained. "The
growth that Stanford offered me was key
in shaping my future. Now I'm trying to
provide a way, using my talents, to con
tribute back to Stanford."

Earlier this month, Baker became the
vice president and general manger of the
financial supplies group at Intuit, Inc., in
Mountain View. Her past positions in
clude vice president of the international
division for Intuit from 1994 to 1996 and
director of product management for per
sonal products from 1989 to 1993.
Through an application and interview
process the board selected Baker because
of the experience she can bring to the job,

according to Jane Lane, special assistant
to the board.
"She is very good at strategic planning,
product definition and promotion," Lane
said. Baker developed the uses of Quicken
financial management software so effec
tively that Intuit's sales soared from $5
million to $70 million in just two years,
Lane added.
