## Election tampering under investigation 
### Kristie Lilje Smith Staff writer 
Officials from both the ASSU
Elections Commission and Resi
dential Computing are investigat
ing alleged attempts to tamper
with the results of last week's
ASSU spring general election.
Residential Computing officials
caught sophomore Chris Peiffer
allegedly attempting to corrupt
the World Wide Web file used for
voting, Peiffer said. Peiffer told
The Daily the incident was a
prank.
Elections Commissioner Ryan
Medders would only say that there
have been suspicions about
whether someone tried to affect
the elections. "Residential Com
puting is looking into the issue and
gathering information about it,"
he said.
Dane Spearing, assistant direc
tor of systems support and devel
opment for Residential Comput
ing and the person in charge of the
investigation, confirmed that the
department is investigating indi

viduals who may have tried to
tamper with the computer system.
Students could vote in last
week's general election by calling
up a Web file that had been in
stalled on all dorm-based comput
ers. Peiffer said last night that he
created an alternate Web file, but
said it did not leave the confines of
his room.
Disgruntled with the ASSU,
Peiffer said he knew that his fake
file would be detected but hoped to
"make [the election] look silly."
Only an hour into the file's test
ing, an individual representing the
ASSU came to his room and asked
him to stop, Peiffer said.
"It was an attempt as a prank
against the ASSU to have election
night be spoiled," he said.
Medders said the alleged tam
pering did not affect election re
sults. "The election was never
compromised during this process;
our security was very tight and we
are confident that the results are
untampered," he said.
