# Out of the Bookstore loop
## Board kept in dark, former members say 
### Elizabeth Goldman Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
Two Stanford Bookstore employees testi
fied yesterday that as members of the Book
store Board of Directors, they were not told
about the extravagant perquisites given to its
top executives.
Agnes Peterson, a Hoover Institution li
brarian and former Bookstore board member,
and Nancy Padgett, director of finance for the
School of Humanities and Sciences, took the
stand in the preliminary hearing for the crim
inal case against former Bookstore officials.
The hearing started last Tuesday.
Defense lawyers said they were attempting
to prove that former Law Prof. Jack Frieden
thal, a former Bookstore board president, ap
proved the perquisites in order to keep the
three defendants from leaving Stanford for
another bookstore.
Former Bookstore Manager Eldon Speed,
former Bookstore Asst. Manager Philip
Chiaramonte and former Bookstore Con
troller Patrick McDonald are each charged
with grand theft and tax evasion. They have
pleaded not guilty.
The charges include the use of Bookstore
money to fund loans on a vacation home in
Twain Harte, Calif., and to acquire a motor
home. The managers also allegedly used
Bookstore funds to lease seven cars for com
pany employees.
The board was responsible for determining
Speed and Chiaramonte's salary and benefits,
including retirement pay and plans to reim
burse college education for their children, Pe
terson said. Many benefits were approved be
cause the board did not want the managers'
salaries to be greatly different from the
salaries of top Stanford professors, she said.
Padgett said board members
trusted Friedenthal and "were
happy to give him the authority to
act on behalf of the board." As
president of the board, Frieden
thal was in charge of guiding
Speed and Chiaramonte's strate
gic "day-to-day operations," Pad
gett said.
Friedenthal had expressed the
sentiment that the managers
"ought to be recompensed fairly,
but there was a difficulty about

their salary being more than that
of a tenured professor," Peterson
said.
Peterson testified that Frieden
thal was the person who first pre
sented the issue of leasing the
Twain Harte home — a 3,100-
square-foot residence available for
use by all Bookstore employees —
to the board.
Board members had no reason
to suspect Speed and Chiaramonte
of wrongdoing, she added.
The vacation home and other
benefits can be considered reason
able because there may have been
no other way to compensate the
managers, Peterson said.

The home was built by Col
leagues Management Services, an
independent consulting company
owned by Speed and Chiaramonte.
The Bookstore then leased the
home, helping to pay off debts in
curred by Colleagues Manage
ment Services during construc
tion of the house.
The home was described as a
"vacation cabin," Peterson said.
"It was designed to be made avail
able to Bookstore staff members."
However, Peterson added that
she did not recall whether discus
sions over the cost of the home and
the payments occurred during a
formal board meeting.

Peterson also discussed her re
sponse to two audits of the Book
store conducted in 1992 — one by
an audit committee of the board
and one by the attorney general's
office. The first found no evidence
of wrongdoing, but the second de
termined some areas of concern.
"I remember being relieved
with the first audit report and
upset by the second audit report,"
she said. "The first audit report
seemed to exonerate both Mr.
Speed and Mr. Chiaramonte. The
second one pointed out areas of
difficulty that 1 hadn't expected
and I hadn't known about."
Peterson said Speed had never

discouraged anyone from asking
questions about the financial
statements or reading tax infor
mation.
Taking the stand after Peter
son had finished, Padgett testified
that she had no prior knowledge of
the house or the motor home be
fore the Feb. 5,1992, article ill The
Daily reported the unusual bene
fits.
She did say, however, that she
believed board member and Histo
ry Prof. Peter Stansky knew about
the house. "He said it was part of
their retirement package, and it
was to supplement their pension
plans. It was open to all of the Book

store staff for recreational pur
pose," Padgett said. "Stansky said
that Friedenthal had set it up."
Padgett was also asked to com
pare the compensations the Book
store managers received with the
fringe benefits of University facul
ty.
"As a board member, I assumed
paychecks and benefits were simi
lar to the Stanford University ben
efits — salary, life insurance,
health insurance and tuition bene
fits," Padgett said. "When
Friedenthal presented the bene
fits to the board, I thought the
salary amount was their total
compensation."
