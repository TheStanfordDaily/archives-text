# Out of the Bookstore loop
## Board kept in dark, former members say 
### Elizabeth Goldman Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
Two Stanford Bookstore employees testi
fied yesterday that as members of the Book
store Board of Directors, they were not told
about the extravagant perquisites given to its
top executives.
Agnes Peterson, a Hoover Institution li
brarian and former Bookstore board member,
and Nancy Padgett, director of finance for the
School of Humanities and Sciences, took the
stand in the preliminary hearing for the crim
inal case against former Bookstore officials.
The hearing started last Tuesday.
Defense lawyers said they were attempting
to prove that former Law Prof. Jack Frieden
thal, a former Bookstore board president, ap
proved the perquisites in order to keep the
three defendants from leaving Stanford for
another bookstore.
Former Bookstore Manager Eldon Speed,
former Bookstore Asst. Manager Philip
Chiaramonte and former Bookstore Con
troller Patrick McDonald are each charged
with grand theft and tax evasion. They have
pleaded not guilty.
The charges include the use of Bookstore
money to fund loans on a vacation home in
Twain Harte, Calif., and to acquire a motor
home. The managers also allegedly used
Bookstore funds to lease seven cars for com
pany employees.
The board was responsible for determining
Speed and Chiaramonte's salary and benefits,
including retirement pay and plans to reim
burse college education for their children, Pe
terson said. Many benefits were approved be
cause the board did not want the managers'
salaries to be greatly different from the
salaries of top Stanford professors, she said.
