April is the Crudest Month ...
Todny's birthday:
Your tarot card is the "Six of Cups." This card
prophesies travel, with an emphasis on exotic
locales. Can you picture yourself in Rio or
Maui? Make plans, even if they seem far in the
future. As the weather turns colder this fall,
paradise may seem to be lost. You will floun
der, depressed with the sense that you can t
go home again. But instead of wallowing in
solipsism, make a new home for yourself else
where.
Taurus (April 20-May 20)
J You are looking forward to your
''birthday. Be careful not to over-plan
that special day.
Gemini (May 21-Junc 20)
) If you haven't yet made plans for
the summer, hurry up. Time's a
wastin'
