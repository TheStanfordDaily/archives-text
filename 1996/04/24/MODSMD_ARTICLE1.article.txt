## Casper discusses steps necessary for approving 'Constitution '96' 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
At last night's ASSU Senate
meeting, University President
Gerhard Casper discussed the
timetable for approval of "Consti
tution '96" and the issue of stu
dent involvement in University
decision-making.
In his quarterly appearance be
fore the senate, Casper began with
a brief statement of his intent to
work on analyzing "Constitution
'96" for University approval as
swiftly as possible.
"I believe that students should
have a lot of leeway in organizing
themselves," Casper said. "I
should not intervene just because
there is a better solution to a prob
lem. I will approach this with some
attitude of deference to what stu
dents want to do."
"Constitution '96," which was
recently approved by the student
body in this spring's general elec
tion, cannot be finalized until the
ASSU certifies the election and
the Board of Trustees or its agent
ratifies the document. Upon re
ceiving the finalized text, Casper
said he will have only two weeks to
approve the constitution until the
last possible date for a special elec
tion to vote in a single president.
"This is quite a challenge for all
of us to come at the end of the
year," Casper said. "This is tight. I
will do the best I can. If it fails to
pass this year, given the lateness
of the elections, I hope we will not
assign blame for this."
Another issue of debate is
which arm of the University will
be charged with approving the
new constitution. Past issues —
such as the approval of the cur
rent ASSU Constitution in 1969
— have been delegated to the
Universitv president bv the

Board of Trustees.
If Casper does not have the au
thority to approve the new consti
tution, then approval would have
to be delayed until after the meet
ing of the trustees in June.
"We have not undertaken that
legal analysis yet," Casper said.
"The current constitution says the
University may designate the
president Ito sign constitutional
amendments!. The question is:
'Have they done so?' That isn't
clear yet."
"Constitution '96" puts a single
president in charge of the ASSU's
executive branch, creates a five
person Constitutional Council ap
pointed by the president to carry
out judicial review, reduces the size
of the senate from 40 to 30 and
grants all senators voting power.
After a discussion of "Constitu
tion '96," the bulk of senators'
questions were in regard to a re
cent decision by the Faculty Senate

to eliminate student representa
tion from the University's Plan
ning and Policy Board, which is
charged with strategic planning.
In response to several senators'
questions, Casper stressed the im
portance of student input in Uni
versity decision-making.
"The Faculty Senate and I dis
agree on a whole range of issues,"
he said. "They did not mean to
send an opinion on the value of stu
dent opinion. However, in this
case, they felt that student input
might chill their deliberations on
these matters."
But one senator said the deci
sion did send a message about stu

dent representation.
"I think that neglecting student
thought at this point is somewhat
condescending," graduate senator
Jessica Koran said. "If students do
not feel that they are welcome in
the decision-making, then why
should they be very excited about
giving back to the University if the
University doesn't respect them?"
Casper encouraged students to
give back to the University and
said he found the current state of
alumni giving very discouraging at
times.
"I hope that (potential donors]
will not be holding me hostage on a
single issue," he said.
