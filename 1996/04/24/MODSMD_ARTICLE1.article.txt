## Casper discusses steps necessary for approving 'Constitution '96' 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
At last night's ASSU Senate
meeting, University President
Gerhard Casper discussed the
timetable for approval of "Consti
tution '96" and the issue of stu
dent involvement in University
decision-making.
In his quarterly appearance be
fore the senate, Casper began with
a brief statement of his intent to
work on analyzing "Constitution
'96" for University approval as
swiftly as possible.
"I believe that students should
have a lot of leeway in organizing
themselves," Casper said. "I
should not intervene just because
there is a better solution to a prob
lem. I will approach this with some
attitude of deference to what stu
dents want to do."
"Constitution '96," which was
recently approved by the student
body in this spring's general elec
tion, cannot be finalized until the
ASSU certifies the election and
the Board of Trustees or its agent
ratifies the document. Upon re
ceiving the finalized text, Casper
said he will have only two weeks to
approve the constitution until the
last possible date for a special elec
tion to vote in a single president.
"This is quite a challenge for all
of us to come at the end of the
year," Casper said. "This is tight. I
will do the best I can. If it fails to
pass this year, given the lateness
of the elections, I hope we will not
assign blame for this."
Another issue of debate is
which arm of the University will
be charged with approving the
new constitution. Past issues —
such as the approval of the cur
rent ASSU Constitution in 1969
— have been delegated to the
Universitv president bv the

Board of Trustees.
If Casper does not have the au
thority to approve the new consti
tution, then approval would have
to be delayed until after the meet
ing of the trustees in June.
"We have not undertaken that
legal analysis yet," Casper said.
"The current constitution says the
University may designate the
president Ito sign constitutional
amendments!. The question is:
'Have they done so?' That isn't
