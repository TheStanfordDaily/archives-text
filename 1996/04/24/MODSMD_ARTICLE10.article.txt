# Stock losses focus of hearing
## Former board member says managers' response worried him 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Testimony at a preliminary hearing yesterday for
three former Stanford Bookstore managers accused
of theft and tax evasion focused on stock losses sus
tained by the Bookstore.
Former Bookstore Controller Patrick McDonald
is charged with two counts of grand theft and two
counts of tax evasion in connection to an investiga
tion of alleged fiscal improprieties at the Bookstore.
Also facing charges in the case are former Bookstore
General Manager Eldon Speed and former Asst.
General Manager Philip Chiaramonte.
Members of the Bookstore's Board of Directors
have been testifying in a preliminary hearing during
the past two weeks. After the preliminary hearing
concludes in June, a judge will decide whether the
case should go to full trial.
Former Bookstore board member and Sociology
Prof. Emeritus Sanford Dornbusch said yesterday
he was concerned with top managers' response to the
information that the Bookstore lost money when
stock McDonald had invested in took a downturn.
Speed, Chiaramonte and McDonald were not au
thorized to purchase stock without the board's ap
proval, Dornbusch said. In addition, he said, stock
was not supposed to be bought on margin.
Dornbusch said Speed and Chiaramonte told Mc-
Donald to sell the stock immediately after they
learned the Bookstore had sustained large losses on
it. After McDonald failed to do so, Dornbusch sought
punishment for the controller, he said.
"A direct order to sell that stock immediately was
given," Dornbusch said. "A big mistake was made by
Mr. Speed and Mr. Chiaramonte in that they did not

follow through to see those steps were taken."
Dornbusch also testified that he was bothered
that Speed and Chiaramonte did not bring the issue
directly to the board for discussion.
"I was very upset that upon learning of the stock
purchase Mr. Speed and Mr. Chiaramonte told Mr.
McDonald to sell the stock but did not report to the
board," Dornbusch said.
"I was for stronger sanctions than the board voted
for and stronger than Mr. Speed and Mr. Chiara
monte recommended," he said. "I would have argued
for criminal sanctions."
McDonald also allegedly kept several thousand
dollars of Bookstore money in a personal account.
After the money moved to the personal account
and the stock losses were discovered, McDonald lost
his job at the Bookstore.
In cross examination, lawyers encouraged Dorn
busch to speculate on why no criminal charges were
filed against McDonald.
They suggested McDonald might have avoided
the charges because of his 10 years of service at the
Bookstore and the fact that he was the highest-rank
ing black official at the Bookstore.
Dornbusch resigned from the Bookstore board
shortly after investigations into the alleged wrong
doing by the managers began. A Feb. 5, 1992, article
in The Daily revealed that top executives at the
Bookstore were receiving perquisites unheard of at
other university bookstores. Two audits and investi
gations by the state attorney general's office and the
Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office fol
lowed.
When the board failed to take swift enough action
to counter the report in The Daily, Dornbusch said
he decided to resign.
