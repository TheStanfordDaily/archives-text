# Panel examines legalization of marijuana

A panel of experts debated the contentious
issue of decriminalizing marijuana last night,
with Hoover Institution Research Fellow
Joseph McNamara denouncing the govern
ment's current policy.
"There are no smart bombs that will solve
[the drug problem]," said McNamara, criticiz
ing the present popularity of simple solutions,
such as locking up drug users.
McNamara reflected on his years as a police
officer in New York and said throwing users in
prison did not accomplish anything.
However, Thomas Gorman, the current
deputy chief of the state's Bureau of Narcotics
Enforcement, sharply disagreed.
"Most people still have a healthy respect for
the law," which is one reason most Americans
do not use drugs, he said. He pointed to a 50 per
cent reduction in the number of marijuana

users between 1979 and 1992 as proof that
tough laws do work.
Gorman advocated a multi-faceted policy
which would also include educational efforts
aimed at prevention.
Panelists also discussed the level of harm
done by marijuana. Although he agreed there is
a drug problem in this country, Craig Reinar
man, a sociology professor at UC-Santa Cruz,
said there is still no research showing that mar
ijuana is more dangerous than alcohol and to
bacco.
Nevertheless, Reinarman said authorities
criminalized marijuana in the 1930s because
political entrepreneurs made it a "scapegoat for
many pre-existing conditions" in the country.
Additionally, some agencies had to "justify their
existence and their budget increases," he said.
It was also a moralistic issue, added McNa
mara. "Certain groups got their version of sin"
criminalized, he said. While he said the war on
drugs had been a failure, the government still

lias a role in solving the problem, such as pro
moting educational efforts.
Selma Suzuki, a licensed family counselor,
said educational efforts directed toward chil
dren are important. When adults use marijua
na, their children are the ones who are most
hurt, Suzuki said. They often grow up emotion
ally disturbed, and some have "no skill in re
sponding to life situations," Suzuki added.
The issue of decriminalizing marijuana for
medicinal purposes brought a mixed response.
Gorman said he would have no problem with
such use if it were supported by the medical es
tablishment and went through proper govern
ment channels.
Reinarman noted, however, that the govern
ment would not allow any research involving
the drug, which precludes a conclusion from sci
entific authorities.
Adams House and the Program in Human
Biology sponsored the panel, which was held in
Ricker Dining Hall.
