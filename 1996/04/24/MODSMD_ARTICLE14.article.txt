Jury rules on Goetz trial
NEW YORK (AP) — Twelve years after he shot
four black youths on a subway train, Bernhard
Goetz was ordered yesterday to pay $43 million to
the one left paralyzed by his final bullet, the one
he told: "You don't look so bad, here's another."
The Bronx jury of four blacks and two Hispan
ics deliberated four hours before ruling unani
mously that the white subway gunman, who was
portrayed as a murderous racist during the trial,
had acted recklessly and without justification in
shooting Darrell Cabey, now 30.
The jury awarded Cabey $18 million in com
pensatory damages and $25 million in punitive
damages. Cabey had sought $50 million.
The chances of Cabey ever collecting are slight.
Goetz's notoriety and legal bills have left the 48-
year-old self-employed electronics expert with lit
tle money.
But Cabey's lawyer, Ronald Kubv, said the
jury's decision "sends a message to all racists with
guns who think young black lives are worth noth
ing — they're worth a lot."
The verdict came nine years after a criminal
trial Ln which a mostly white jury acquitted Goetz
of attempted murder and convicted him of illegal

ly possessing a gun. He served almost nine
months.
Fires erupt at Chernobyl
KIEV, Ukraine (AP) — Fire raced through
deserted villages around the Chernobyl nuclear
plant yesterday, sending wind-whipped radioac
tive particles skyward 10 years to the week after
the world's worst nuclear accident.
Monitors flown in helicopters over the area of
the fire recorded only a slight radiation increase,
said Nikolai Komshensky, a spokesman for
Ukraine's nuclear regulatory agency.
"We see no reason to be concerned now," he
said.
Plant officials said the fire posed no danger to
the Chernobyl plant, still in operation a decade
after a reactor exploded, killing at least 30 people
outright. Another 5 million people were exposed
to radioactive fallout, mostly in Ukraine, Belarus
and Russia.
No injuries were reported in the fire, which
burned several acres before being put out after
almost eight hours. It was not clear how much
damage was done to the villages, officially off lim
its since the plant disaster.
