# Cease-fire plans delayed
## President Assad cancels meeting with Christopher 
### 
DAMASCUS, Syria IAP)
Complicating peace efforts as fight
ing raged on, Syrian President
Hafez Assad made himself "not
available" yesterday to meet with
Secretary of State Warren Christo
pher on the latest U.S. cease-fire
plan for Lebanon.
The U.S. shuttle diplomacy was
stalled further when security con
cerns forced Christopher to cancel a
trip to Beirut.
With the Lebanon trip off and no
reason to remain in Damascus,
Christopher returned to Jerusalem
for more discussions today with
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres.
Christopher has been shuttling
between Jerusalem and Damascus
since Saturday, hoping to obtain a
cease-fire between Israel and
Hezbollah guerrillas in southern
Lebanon.
The fighting continued unabat
ed, with Israeli jets striking a reser
voir and Hezbollah guerrillas firing

rockets into northern Israel.
Both Israel and Syria are push
ing for changes in the one-page U.S.
plan to end the fighting. France has
offered a competing plan for a cease
fire, and French Foreign Minister
Herve de Charette is engaging in his
own version of shuttle diplomacy.
After a brief stop in Jerusalem,
de Charette returned to Damascus
late yesterday. He said France was
willing to participate in an interna
tional peacekeeping force in south
ern Lebanon if Israel agrees to with
draw.
After two meetings Monday with
Peres, Christopher had hoped to
meet yesterday with Assad. But
upon his return to Damascus from
Jerusalem, he was told by Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa
that Assad was "not available," a
State Department official said.
State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns called Assad's can
cellation disappointing. He said the
Syrian leader apparently did not

have enough time for the lengthy
meeting that Christopher pre
ferred. Burns said Christopher
would try to see Assad after today's
meeting with Peres.
Assad has consistently delayec
meetings with U.S. secretaries ol
state, but this was the first time
that a scheduled session did not
come off.
Even so, the White House
declined to call Assad's refusal i
snub. "We regard it as one othei
development that we have to con
tend with in the very painstaking
process of bringing peace and recon
eiliation to the people of the Middh
East," White House press secrotap
Mike McCurry said in Washington.
A U.S. official said the Syrian:
had encouraged Christopher to g<
to Lebanon.
"The reason to go to Ijebanon i;
because the object of all thus diplo
matic activity is Lebanon," Burn;
said. "If there is going to lx> a cease
fire, Lebanon must be part of it."
