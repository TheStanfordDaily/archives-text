Board must keep
student concerns in
mind for next year

Finally, after more
than four years of commit
tee meetings, negotiations
and promises to students, the
administration has finalized
plans to install a cheap student
eatery in Tresidder. Slated to
arrive next fall, Polio's will be a
welcome addition to the Farm.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
and the Tresidder advisory board
should be commended in their
choice of Polio's to occupy the
area left empty from the removal
of the bowling alley in 1981.
Rather than supporting a large
conglomerate, such as Taco Bell,
they have chosen to support a
local business — Polio's has
restaurants in Palo Alto and
Menlo Park. In addition, the
University will be reciprocating
the support Polio's has provided
Stanford through its sponsorship
of the Cardinal men's and
women's volleyball teams. To top
it all off, the food is both inex
pensive and a healthy alternative
to what most fast food chains
sell.
The decision demonstrates
Wais' commitment to creating a
student union that actually
caters to student wants and
needs. Opening Tresidder to a
competitive market allows stu
dents cheaper and better-quality
food, as well as an alternative to
food service, especially for those
students who do not have cars to
go in search for the occasional
off-campus meal. When oversee
ing the installment of the restau
rant, Wais should make sure
plans remain as committed to
students as they are now.
Polio's has already expressed a
willingness to accommodate the
unique lifestyle of college stu

dents. The seating and lighting
on the first floor, for example,
will be conducive to social study
ing, and the prices will be the
same as in Polio's other restau
rants, despite the fact that it will
have to give a portion of its prof
its to Tresidder. Polio's must,
however, tailor their hours for
students as well.
The Polio's in Palo Alto and
Menlo Park close at an average
time for the suburbs — 9:30 p.m.
As part of a campus filled with
students that stay up well past
midnight, Tresidder's Polio's
must take into account when
students make their food runs.
Although it has suggested
remaining open until 1 a.m. on
the weekends, the restaurant
should acknowledge that stu
dents are more likely to go to
Polio's for a late-night study
break than a meal.
Other eateries on campus
already take this into account.
The Coffee House, for example,
closes at midnight on weekends
but remains open until 2 a.m.
Monday through Friday. Late
Night, offered until 1 a.m. at
Stern and Florence Moore, is
only open on weeknights. In
order to accommodate students,
Polio's should remain open later
on weekdays — until 1 or 2 a.m.
—■ and can close earlier on the
weekends. If necessary, Polio's
could open later than 11 a.m. —
which is when it opens in Palo
Alto and Menlo Park — in order
to alter its operating hours for
Stanford students.
In addition to the Mexican
eatery, the advisory board is
planning on opening another site
in Tresidder to vendors. Sugges
tions include anything from an
optometrist to a video store. The
board also plans to rewire the
lighting on the first floor in order
to improve the conditions under
which many students study. It
appears that Stanford students
may finally get what their peers
at other universities already
have: a real student union.
