Dean says University is taking steps to combat graffiti

I AM WRITING TO express my con
cern about the recent acts of van
dalism in the Asian American
Activities Center (A3C) as well as to
inform the community of the actions
taken to date. I hope readers will not
interpret the timing of this notice to be
a reaction to other public discussions.
This would not be a fair characteriza
tion of the work and the discussions
that my staff and I and other adminis
trators have conducted over the past
two weeks.
By now most people in the Stanford
community have learned that racist
graffiti appeared three times inside the
center. Such targeted, Asian-specific
vandalism inside a community center
where people expect to be secure is
unacceptable. We cannot tolerate these
types of activities if we are to preserve
the sense of safety, belonging and good

will we have worked so hard to estab
lish at Stanford. Even though we have
made meaningful progress in creating a
respectful and supportive campus envi
ronment, events such as these painfully
remind us that we are not immune
from acts of bigotry that unfortunately
persist in our current world.
I want the Stanford community to
know that we have taken this matter
very seriously. Our actions have
included, but are not limited to: direct
follow-up and reporting of the inci
dents by the Assistant Dean and Direc
tor of the A3C, Rick Yuen, and the
Assistant Director of the A3C, Cindy
Ng; a visit to the A3C and a personal
statement of concern by the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs, Mary
Edmonds, on behalf of the President
and Provost; a visit to the A3C to meet
with student staff by Provost Con-

doleezza Rice; and a statement to the
Faculty Senate and a letter of concern
and condemnation regarding these
incidents to the Asian-American com
munity by President Gerhard Casper.
As Dean, I have met with students, fac
ulty and staff to coordinate the Univer
sity's response. Moreover, all of the
above administrators have been engaged
with concerned alumni.
These actions demonstrate this Uni
versity's overall dismay, concern and
condemnation regarding activities such
as these which violate Stanford's sense
of values and principles.
In addition to these actions, my staff
and I wish to reiterate the need to take
a proactive approach to responding to
this anonymous bigotry. To be sure, we
will work to review and strengthen our
protocol so our responses will be effec
tive when these events occur. However,

we believe it is equally important to
focus on the unfinished business of
building a stronger overall campus
community, in addition to strengthen
ing our vital community centers. We
need to continue to focus our energy on
providing institutional validation of
the A3C and other community centers,
increasing their use and accessibility,
securing staff and program budgets,
continuing our educational programs
and coordinating publicity and commu
nication about events.
We believe these continuing initia
tives, as well as others that will surely
emerge, will prove to be useful in creat
ing the most supportive and respectful
campus environment possible at Stan
ford. I invite the entire Stanford com
munity to join in this worthy endeavor.
