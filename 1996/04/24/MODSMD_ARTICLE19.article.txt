# A 						day of remembrance for every Armenian
## 
### 
We are quite fortunate to be at
Stanford University — a place dedicat
ed to education and research which
prides itself on diversity. Our student
body is so mixed and unique that it
supports numerous ethnic voluntary
student organizations.
As the president of one such organi
zation, the Armenian Students' Asso
ciation, I feel compelled, as does the
rest of our union, to educate and
inform the Stanford community about
our culture and history.
Armenia is a small country in the
former Soviet Union. It is one of a few
Christian countries in Eastern Europe.
In fact, Armenia's Mount Ararat is the
biblical landing site of Noah's Ark.
Although its ancestral lands have
spanned far greater areas than the
map reveals, Armenia today is con-

fined between the Caspian and Black
Seas, just north of Iran and east of
Turkey.
Today is a day of remembrance for
all Armenians, as it must be for all
humanity. It is the 81st Commemora
tion of the Armenian Genocide and
this is why our association has chosen
to submit a letter to The Daily today.
In 1915, under the guise and global
confusion of World War I, the Armeni
an people were decimated by the
expanding rule of the Ottoman Turk
ish Empire. Historians have shown
that over 1.5 million Armenians were
murdered throughout the country.
Numerous atrocities have been docu
mented by historical records and
accounts from survivors which are too
heinous to recount and too painful to
mention. The goal of that Turkish
regime was to erase the Armenian peo
ple from history and assume control of
their lands. Today, a large part of
ancient Armenia still lies in eastern
Turkey.

The reasons for writing this letter
are not to blame the Turks of today.
They are not the misguided leaders
who once perpetuated such bar
barism. However, we continue our
plea for the acknowledgment of these
truths by both the Turkish and the
United States governments. We, as all
educated people, feel that history
should not be repeated. People can
learn from the mistakes of the past.
We all learned the price of such igno
rance during World War II: in many
historical chronicles, Hitler is quoted
as saying "Who remembers the Arme
nians?" as he rationalized the Jewish
Holocaust.
The sadness today brings lies with
many. It rests within the Turkish gov
ernment for not acknowledging this
mass murder of millions. It is found in
the eyes of bystanders, such as the cit
izens and government of the United
States, who refuse to act against
crimes against huir»anity around the
world today. It is unfortunate that

such pain can arise from neglect and
can be so easily remedied through
understanding. It remains within the
survivors of the Genocide in saying
good-bye to loved ones once again. And
of course it stays in the hearts of each
and every Armenian today.
A pastor named Niemoller once said,
First they came for the Jews
And I did not speak out —
Because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for the Communists
And I did not speak out —
Because I was not a Communist.
Then they came for the trade
unionists and I did not speak out —
Because I was not a trade unionist.
Then they came for me —
And there was no one left
To speak out for me.
All that we ask today is for an oath
to remember and learn from the Arme
nian Genocide, and to speak out before
you become the last.
