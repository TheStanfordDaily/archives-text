# ASSU considers special election
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
The ASSU
Senate last
night blocked
an attempt
made to in
troduce a bill
that would
have called a
special elec
tion for an

ASSU president and vice
president in the event that
the University administra
tion approves "Constitution
'96."
The senate also struck
down a motion to call for an
extra meeting next week.
Deputy Senate Chair Bill
Shen, who proposed the mo
tion toward the end of the
meeting, said his intention

was to expedite the certification of
election results, which must be
done before "Constitution '96" is
presented to the Board of
Trustees for approval.
After officially validating last
week's general election, Elections
Commissioner Ryan Medders —
who has been working on a time
line for the special election which
must take place in order to name
an ASSU president and vice presi
dent — said that because the next
senate meeing will not take place
for two weeks, the likelihood of

holding the necessary special elec
tion is slim.
"It's still possible," Medders
said. "It's never impossible, but its
chances are hurting the longer we
wait."
Senate Chair Alane Murdock
announced that she will be form
ing an official ASSU committee
"to address issues of transition"
related to "Constitution '96."
Murdock said the group must
be "large enough so that student
voices are heard and small enough
so that things get done," adding
that her search for committee
members will begin with the
ASSU executive committee, which
consists of Murdock, Shen, Finan
cial Manager John Hall and Coun

cil of Presidents members Mike
Choo, Jon Oram, Rich Stolz and
Nicole Vazquez.
Late last week, COP member
Jon Oram announced his inten
tion to form a committee to carry
out the same task.
However, Oram said his com
mittee is unofficial, "more of a
caucus of concerned students who
want to make sure that 'Constitu
tion '96' gets passed" in a timely
fashion — an objective which
Oram said he feels is not Mur
dochs chief goal.
In other business, the senate
passed bills Stolz proposed to
adopt bylaws for the ASSU Finan
cial Aids Awareness Office and the
ASSU Course Guide.
