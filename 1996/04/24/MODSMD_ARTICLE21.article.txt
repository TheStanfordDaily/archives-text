## Doublespeak, Stanford-style 
### 
STANFORD DOESN'T CARE about
you. While your teachers and
friends may care about you, the
trustees of Stanford, the regulations that
run this place and the generally moral
people working as puppets on strings con
trolled by these regulations don't care
about you. They only care about your
impact on what Dean John Shoven called
in Friday's Daily "the University's com
petitiveness in the academic market."
While I've often thought this as I fol
lowed Stanford's infatuation with U.S.
News & World Report, the new grading
policy, the preposterous DR system and
Stanford's reluctance to listen to stu
dents unless they sour and embarrass the
University (and hence decrease its aca
demic market competitiveness) bv strik
ing in the Quad, I became irrefutably
jaded last Thursday at the Polio's / Taco
Bell press conference.
In March, immediately after Dean of
Students Marc Wais was quoted in The
Daily as saying that Taco Bell was "defi
nitely on the table" for a spot in Tresid
der, a campaign began to illuminate Taco
Bell's corporate irresponsibility. Surpris
ingly and suddenly, the campaign was
pushed into the spotlight and extensive
articles appeared in The Washington
Post, Business Week and The Interna
tional Herald Tribune.
The campaign was potentially embar
rassing to the decision-milking body of
Stanford: the trustees (individuals whose

values are, for the most part, inconsistent
with those of the students, faculty and
even Jane Stanford). Subsequently, all
who carry Stanford's glorious torch
danced around the delicate issue.
The dancing culminated at the press
conference. Dean Wais, with the Tresid
der student advisory board, announced
they had chosen Polio's — Mr. Chicken
— over Taco Bell — Mr. Slave Labor —
because Polio's "had the best space allo
cation plan for Tresidder." They also
explained that the issue of PepsiCo's
corporate responsibility was not within
"their purview" and they had consid
ered the 2,000 petitions exactly as they
would have if the 2,000 petitions had
protested Taco Bell's silly advertising
jingles.
If its not in the purview of the adviso
ry board to consider non-economic fac
tors, whose purview is it in? Supposedly
it's in the purview of the Advisory Panel
on Investment Responsibility (APIR) — a
committee comprised of faculty, stu
dents, alumni, etc. — that makes recom
mendations regarding investment
responsibility. Yet as a student commit
tee member, I know the APIR has the
power of a small mole trying to limp
across a highway.
The APIR can make no decisions; it can
only make recommendations to a higher
committee — a committee known as the
Special Committee on Investment Respon
sibility (SCIR) — which has no students.

Not surprisingly, like everyone else who
wants to make a recommendation to these
higher-ups, we are ignored. The SCIR
won't meet with the APIR, it didn't listen
to the APIR regarding tobacco and it has
shown no sign of listening with regard to
Burma. As far as I can tell, the SCIR hasn't
even met since September.
Investment responsibility is a serious
moral issue and it's an issue on which
most of the students and faculty disagree
with the trustees. As such, a structure
has been created that gives students and
faculty the facade of power but actually
just gives us false hope and wastes our
time. I'd much rather have a system
where one could be defeated because
one's arguments were inferior than a sys
tem where a year of effort is as useful as
spitting against a brick wall.
Most importantly, investment respon
sibility isn't an isolated issue; it's one
example in a sea of examples of how little
we, and our values, matter to serious
decision-making at Stanford. As former
student body president David Harris
said, the crucial question is whether we
"want students for a university or a uni
versity for students." Sadly, we are much
too close to the former.
