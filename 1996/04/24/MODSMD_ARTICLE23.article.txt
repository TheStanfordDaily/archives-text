## Spring for a senior: a columnist's list of disconnected ideas 
### 
IT'S SPRING QUARTER. I have 30
pages of my thesis left to finish by the
middle of next month. I do not have
time to write this column.
You don't read the whole things any
way. Are columnists so pompous that they
think readers actually want to muddle
through a whole 30 inches of nonsense on
newsprint? Of course we are. But, in the
spirit of cooperative, reader-friendly jour
nalism — and because I simply don't have
that much to say — I offer this week a few
bite-sized, fairly digestible harangues
about some of the matters that of late have
kept me muttering incoherently, running
for IVs of Starbucks, and whiling away
hours eating Oreos, watching reruns of
DifTrent Strokes and wondering where in
the world we lost our way.
Polio's
Last week, the University announced
that the new Tresidder Union eatery
promised to students three years ago
will, as promised, serve cheap Mexican
food. But in a triumph for local small
business and Jack in the Box, Stanford
chose to award the plum space not to the
previous front-runner Taco Bell, but to
Polio's, a charming little Palo Alto
taqueria that greets its patrons with the
sight of whole chickens enjoying their
afterlife on something resembling a red

hot iron ferris wheel.
Now, I enjoy Polio's burritos and its
one-dollar beers as much as the next co-op
resident, and I'm certain the restaurant
owner put up a very attractive offer to
sway the board adjudicating offers. But I
have a hard time believing that the deci
sion to drop Taco Bell had nothing to do
with PepsiCo's investments in Burma.
Until Stanford activists began raising eye
brows and then bloody hell about the
Burmese government's human rights
abuses, Taco Bell's arrival in Tresidder
seemed as inevitable as George Bush's re
election after the Gulf War. So why won't
anyone give credit where it appears due?
Well, can you imagine any Stanford
decision-maker telling a captive media,
"Hell yes, we rejected a major corpora
tion's presence on campus because a cou
ple thousand liberal students objected to
it!" Within seconds, wealthy alumni would
be dialing up their banks' 1-800 numbers
to cancel that check they just sent west.
Given that, liberals should be careful not to
make Generous Donor Inc.'s seven shares
in Tool of Imperialism Co., which owns a
basket-weaving boutique in war-torn
Liberia, their next subject of attack. Let's
not get too excited that the University
decided, however reluctantly, to part with
the international prestige attendant with
double-decker taco supremes served on

demand 50 feet from the Faculty Club.
The ASSU Elections
Ding-dong, the wicked COP is dead. But
might 85 percent of registered Stanford
voters — or at least, those students with
enough time on their hands to give a damn
— be wrong? The arguments for the pack
age of amendments called Constitution '96
have a good deal of persuasive merit: the
plan will streamline the COP and the Sen
ate, create a judicial branch and pretty
much make the ASSU look less like a
uniquely inefficient institution of gover
nance and more like, well, a run-of-the-mill
inefficient institution of governance. Sure,
with a single president, The Daily and the
Review will more easily be able to resort to
ad hominem editorials. But the logic of the
new constitution seems to consume itself:
if four resume-packers can't accomplish
anything worth keeping them around for,
how much can we expect from one of
them?
By the way, is anyone troubled by the
rightward iurch of the "electorate" this
spring? Not only did voters shrink the size
of student government, they also lowered
their taxes by denying funds to heretofore
worthy groups like the Stanford Jazz
Orchestra, the Women's Center Collective
and Students Against Genocide. (Who isn't
against genocide? Who doesn't like

women?) And then there was Steve Russell,
proclaiming a "new era for Stanford stu
dents" and modestly telling a Daily reporter
that the "rise to power" of his party was
"nothing short of a student revolt against a
myopic and unconcerned student govern
ment." What's next — a televised ASSU
town hall meeting with the Tofflers?
Pro Fros
Given that two columnists in two days
have already referenced the weekend past
and our fresh-faced visitors, I'll keep most
of my wrath concerning Stanford's ritual
springtime whoring for kids still worried
about how to sneak a few Miller Genuine
Drafts into the prom. I successfully avoided
the "admits" and their Visa-flashing pro
genitors for most of the weekend, but I did
have two memorable brushes with the class
of '00. (The Empty Set?) I popped into
President Casper's speech to the gathered
on Friday morning, and I admit that if the
unapologetic candor of a school's president
were a substantive variable in my choice of
colleges, I'd be plunking down $54 for that
embroidered Champion heavyweight right
now. Casper talked eloquently about the
financial pressures on students and the
importance of studying the arts, but most
of the students around me flipped through
their slender Admit Weekend itineraries,
scanning for the nearest free barbecue. As

the audience got up to leave, a woman walk
ing up the aisle spotted her son, walking
out of my row. "Hi, honey!" she exclaimed,
and stared at me hard. "Hi. Oh, are you
guys together?" I was a little startled. "No,
we're not," I said. "Well, you will be!" she
said, putting her arm around her Stanford
bound boy and walking away. Wait, I want
ed to say. How do you know I won't choose
Princeton?
My parents
None of their parents went to the wed
ding. My mother happened upon her hus
band's father in an airport. They crossed
three continents before starting a family in
lily-white upstate New York; they then
journeyed, like countless Americans before
them, across the expanse of the country
and settled near the Golden Gate. They
both held down professional careers and
prospered in them, and raised three rea
sonably well-adjusted children. Next year
the last one leaves the nest. They celebrat
ed their 25th year of happy union last
weekend at home, with 80 or so of their
closest friends, including me, and we
watched as they renewed their vows and
sent this love story hurtling into its next,
wondrous, blissful act.
