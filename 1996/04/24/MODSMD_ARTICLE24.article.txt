## Cardinal wins lopsided affair over Spartans 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
San Jose State 0

Two weeks ago, on the Tuesday before the Stanford
baseball team was swept by USC, the San Jose Spartans
notched an 8-6 non-conference victory over the Cardinal.
Last night, in another Tuesday night affair, Stanford
(28-17 overall, 13-11 in the Pacific-10 Southern Division)
got a little revenge, cruising to its first win over the Spar
tans in the hist six meetings between the two South Bay
schools. Senior Mario Iglesias (7-1) picked up his team
leading seventh win as the Cardinal triumphed by a final
of 11-0.
Iglesias tossed four innings, allowing two hits and one
base on balls before giving way to freshman left-hander
Tony Cogan. Cogan went three innings and junior Pom
Reimers finished San Jose State off by working the final
two frames.
"(The Spartans) have done a job on us the last couple
of years and really played very well," said Stanford skip
per Mark Marquess. "It's nice to get this win against
them. Mario and all our pitchers pitched well and we
swung the bat well. It was a good game all the way around
for us."
Several Cardinal hatters enjoyed success against San
Jose State pitching, as Stanford knocked out 16 hits.
Spartan starter Rich Ixxleit kept the Cardinal off the
scoreboard for the first two innings, but Stanford struck
in the third, scoring three times off Israel Long (4-4), who
lasted just one-third of an inning.
The Cardinal posted three more runs in the fourth,
added two each in the fifth and sixth and tallied number
11 in the seventh on a solo home run by third baseman
Trov Kent.
"I got all of it," said Kent of his fourth long-ball of the
year. "It was a fastball in, and I was up there looking fast
ball first pitch. I was just going to swing as hard as I could
and see what happened."
Kent started the year at first base before being side
lined with a knee injury. In his place, Luke Quaccia has
posted a .377 batting average in 17 starts. In order to keep
both bats in the lineup, Kent has made the move across
the diamond to the hot corner.
"It's not that big of an adjustment because they're
both reaction positions," Kent said. "It's good to be back
in the lineup. Luke (Quaccia) came in and played so well
that it was tough to take him out of the Uneup, so I'm just
happy to get back in and contribute."
Other Stanford bats contributing last night were Joe
Kilburg (3-for-4, three RBIs, three runs scored), Jody
Gerut (two hits including a home run, three RBIs) and
Brian Dallimore, the team's hottest hitter.
Coming off a career day in which he went 6-for-6 with
six RBIs Sunday against Arizona, Dallimore collected
three more hits last night to raise his average to .341.
"I've been feeling pretty good since we made a few ad
justments in my swing," Dallimore said. "I've been soup
tight at the plate, I've just tried to relax and stay as loose
as I can, just keep my hands relaxed and see the ball. It
sounds so simple to see the ball, but before I was kind of
reacting without seeing the ball."
The fans at Sunken Diamond almost saw a ball off
Dallimore's bat get out of the park in his last at-bat of the
night, but his long fly was caught at the warning track.
" It felt pretty good," said Dallimore, of his near round
tripper. "I knew I was a little out front and caught it good
on the barrel. I just missed it, but I can't complain. I've
been hitting the ball well and getting a few breaks."
Marquess hopes Dallimore and the rest of the lineup
continue to be hot at the plate this weekend, as the Car
dinal hosts No. 13 UCLA in a crucial Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division series. The two teams will meet
Friday night at 7 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday at 1 p.m.
