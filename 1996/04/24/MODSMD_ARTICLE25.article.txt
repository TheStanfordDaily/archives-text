# There's no stopping the Road Warriors
## Becker, Elliot shine for the Cardinal despite playing at bottom of the lineup 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
Just when you thought pro
fessional wrestling had finally
disappeared, it emerges at the
forefront of Stanford athletics.
The Road Warriors are back, and
this time, the hitting isn't fake.
Ax, Smash and their cape-clad
coach have invaded Cardinal ter
ritory, and they are slugging with
as much force as ever — only this
time it's with tennis racquets.
No, the World Wrestling Fed
eration greats have not added
Wilson Pro-Staffs to their supply
of illegal weaponry. Rather, a
new generation of Road Warriors
has emerged, and they are play
ing tennis for the defending na
tional champions.
John Whitlinger, Ricky Beck
er and Grant Elliott are carrying
a meaner demeanor to the courts
with them these days, and with a
toughness only before seen in the
rings of the WWF, they are blow
ing through opponents. But of all
WWF heroes, why the Road War
riors?
Whitlinger, who as assistant
coach oversees the fourth
through sixth singles players
during Cardinal matches, offi
cially coined the name back in
February at the Rolex National
Indoor Championships.
"I actually picked it up at a
Stanford basketball game," he
said. "There were a couple of
guys in wheelchairs, and I guess
they called themselves the Road
Warriors. I like the name, and it

seemed to fit our guys."
It fits so very well because of
the way most collegiate tennis
matches are set up geographical
ly. "It seems like everywhere we
play, there tire three main courts,
and three outer courts," Becker
said. "Grant and I always have to
travel out to the boondocks to
play our matches. That's where
the 'road' part comes in. We've
always been warriors."
Elliott and Becker are Stan
ford's fifth and sixth singles
starters, respectively, and they
are bringing a new sense of pres
tige to the bottom of the lineup.
Over the past two years, they
have compiled a combined dual
match record of 74-14. For those
who don't want to do the math,
that's a whopping .841 winning
percentage.
"People talk about Stanford's
depth. Well, we are that depth,"
said a beaming Becker. "By nam
ing ourselves the Road Warriors,
as whacked-out as it may seem, it
gave us an extra dose of pride
about playing down at five and
six.
Stanford's fourth singles play
er is also plagued with having to
hike to his undoubtedly distant
court site. Recently, freshman
Ryan Wolters — ranked No. 9 na
tionally — has been the starter at
No. 4. But, according to Elliott
and Becker, Wolters just doesn't
have what it takes to be a real
warrior. "Wolters is technically a
road warrior, but he's kind of a

tainted warrior," Becker said.
"I le's played on the main courts in
the top three, and he's ranked way
too high."
As if that weren't enough for
the poor freshman, there is anoth
er strike against Wolters. "His
game is too pretty," Elliott said.
"We're blue-collar tennis players,
and Wolly's strokes are way too
nice. Ricky and I win a lot of
matches, but it isn't always with
the prettiest tennis in the world."
Senior Jim Thomas has also
played at No. 4 for the Card, but he
is severely lacking in 'warrior
style.' "We don't count Jim
Thomas as a road warrior because
he goes too slowly. To be a true
road warrior, you've got to be
'crash and burn.' Jim's more
touch-and-wait," said a very criti
cal Becker. "Grant and I are the
only die-hard warriors on this
team."
Whitlinger agrees that his fifth
and sixth singles starters are not
the most graceful players he has

ever coached. "They aren't pretty
players," he said. "But those guys
scrap and fight for every single
point. It has been a lot of fun
coaching those two."
The Road Warriors may joke
about their less-than-elegant
style, but each has a more-than
respectable game. Both have been
ranked in the top 50 this year; cur
rently Becker is No. 5*2, Elliott No.
86. Players of that caliber play as
high as first or second singles for
other colleges.
When Becker and Elliott elect
ed to come to Stanford, they knew
they were sacrificing the opportu
nity to play in a more glamorous
position on another team.
"Sure, we could have played
higher somewhere else, but it
wouldn't have been worth it," El
liott said. "I'd much rather have a
shot at winning the national
championship than compete on a
marginal team."
Becker, a communication
major, chose Stanford partly for
its academic repute. He makes
sure to note, however, that he
could have received a similar edu
cation in the Northeast; tennis
was the deciding factor in his deci

sion.
"At Stanford, you're playing
with five or six guys who have
good pro potential," he said. "If
you go to an East Coast school
with good academics, you're play
ing with five or six guys that will
one day make great doctors and
lawyers, but aren't in tennis for
the long haul."
Indeed, this year's Cardinal
squad does possess five or six play
ers with professional potential.
Becker, for his part, is going to
spend at least five months on the
ATP tour after graduation. "I'm
definitely going to give myself a
chance," he said. "If after a while I
don't like it, or I'm not doing very
well, I'll move on."
Elliott plans to travel with
Becker during the summer, but
admits that he doesn't have "any
big pro aspirations."
Both Elliott, ajunior, and Beck
er, a senior, have seen plenty of
younger players join the team and
jump ahead of them in the lineup,
but they insist that they have no ill
feelings for those players.
"Last year Paul Goldstein and
Scott Humphries were the new
freshmen, and they played ahead

of us. This year it's Wolly. But that
doesn't bother us at all," Elliott
said. "They deserve to be playing
up there. Whenever I feel like I
played really well in a match, I
come right down the next day in
practice when our top guys hasi
cally kick my butt. But they're
such great guys about being better
than us. Everyone knows it's not
about position on this team, it's
about winning matches."
So where exactly does Whitlinger

play into the equation? When Stan
ford's assistant coach played in a
Cardinal uniform over 20 years ago,
he was hardly one of the lineup's bot -
torn dwellers. In 1974, Whitlinger
led the Cardinal to the NCAA team

championship and then went on to
win the individual and doubles tour
naments as well. But, two years be
fore winning the collegiate tennis
triple crown, Whitlinger, too, was a
warrior. In 1972, he played sixth sin
gles as a freshman.
Perhaps it was that year which
gave Whitlinger his uncanny un
derstanding about what being a
Road Warrior is all about. "Whit
gave us the name," Elliott said.
"He's as much a warrior as any
one now. It was Whit who brought
our attention to this feeling of
pride about playing on the back
courts."
Becker, never afraid to ex
pound on the wrestling metaphor,
offered the following analysis of
his coach. "I don't know if you've
ever seen pro wrestling, but Ax
and Smash come out during the
match and fight, and their manag
er goes crazy, right there beside
them with a big cape and his face
all painted. That manager guy —
that's Whit. I mean, Whit is a leg
end. Half the people that go out to
the bleachers to watch us go just to
watch him coach."
While that may be a bit of a
stretch, to say that the Warriors

are the key to winning this year's
NCAA crown is not. UCLA, the
current No. 1 team, is extremely
strong at one through three (all
are ranked in the top 30, and Stan
ford is 0-9 against them in their
three encounters this season), and
tennis insiders are saying that the
Cardinal will need to rely on its
depth if it is to repeat as NCAA
champions.
That, after all, is the chief aim
of the Warriors, and of the entire
team. Last year, Becker won the
deciding match of the NCAA finals
to clinch the title. Above his bed
hangs a photo immortalizing the
event. In it, Becker is leapingwith
excitement — although his two
inch vertical leaves much to be de
sired.
"That was far and away the
greatest moment in my tennis ca
reer," he says. "1 want that feeling
again."
There you have it: Stanford's
Road Warriors. Ax, Smash and
their caped coach certainly are not
the most glamorous trio around —
they do not have the highest rank
ings, the most fans or the best
form — but these guys just might
have the most fun.

Ryan Wolters — ranked No. 9 na
tionally — has been the starter at
No. 4. But, according to Elliott
and Becker, Wolters just doesn't
have what it takes to be a real
warrior. "Wolters is technically a
road warrior, but he's kind of a

tainted warrior," Becker said.
"I le's played on the main courts in
the top three, and he's ranked way
too high."
As if that weren't enough for
the poor freshman, there is anoth
er strike against Wolters. "His
game is too pretty," Elliott said.
"We're blue-collar tennis players,
and Wolly's strokes are way too
nice. Ricky and I win a lot of
matches, but it isn't always with
the prettiest tennis in the world."
Senior Jim Thomas has also
played at No. 4 for the Card, but he
is severely lacking in 'warrior
style.' "We don't count Jim
Thomas as a road warrior because
he goes too slowly. To be a true
road warrior, you've got to be
'crash and burn.' Jim's more
touch-and-wait," said a very criti
cal Becker. "Grant and I are the
only die-hard warriors on this
team."
Whitlinger agrees that his fifth
and sixth singles starters are not
the most graceful players he has

ever coached. "They aren't pretty
players," he said. "But those guys
scrap and fight for every single
point. It has been a lot of fun
coaching those two."
The Road Warriors may joke
about their less-than-elegant
style, but each has a more-than
respectable game. Both have been
ranked in the top 50 this year; cur
rently Becker is No. 5*2, Elliott No.
86. Players of that caliber play as
high as first or second singles for
other colleges.
When Becker and Elliott elect
ed to come to Stanford, they knew
they were sacrificing the opportu
nity to play in a more glamorous
position on another team.
"Sure, we could have played
higher somewhere else, but it
wouldn't have been worth it," El
liott said. "I'd much rather have a
shot at winning the national
championship than compete on a
marginal team."
Becker, a communication
major, chose Stanford partly for
its academic repute. He makes
sure to note, however, that he
could have received a similar edu
cation in the Northeast; tennis
was the deciding factor in his deci

sion.
"At Stanford, you're playing
with five or six guys who have
good pro potential," he said. "If
you go to an East Coast school
with good academics, you're play
ing with five or six guys that will
one day make great doctors and
lawyers, but aren't in tennis for
the long haul."
Indeed, this year's Cardinal
squad does possess five or six play
ers with professional potential.
Becker, for his part, is going to
spend at least five months on the
ATP tour after graduation. "I'm
definitely going to give myself a
chance," he said. "If after a while I
don't like it, or I'm not doing very
well, I'll move on."
Elliott plans to travel with
Becker during the summer, but
admits that he doesn't have "any
big pro aspirations."
Both Elliott, ajunior, and Beck
er, a senior, have seen plenty of
younger players join the team and
jump ahead of them in the lineup,
but they insist that they have no ill
feelings for those players.
"Last year Paul Goldstein and
Scott Humphries were the new
freshmen, and they played ahead

of us. This year it's Wolly. But that
doesn't bother us at all," Elliott
said. "They deserve to be playing
up there. Whenever I feel like I
played really well in a match, I
come right down the next day in
practice when our top guys hasi
cally kick my butt. But they're
such great guys about being better
than us. Everyone knows it's not
about position on this team, it's
about winning matches."
So where exactly does Whitlinger

about playing.'

play into the equation? When Stan
ford's assistant coach played in a
Cardinal uniform over 20 years ago,
he was hardly one of the lineup's bot -
torn dwellers. In 1974, Whitlinger
led the Cardinal to the NCAA team

championship and then went on to
win the individual and doubles tour
naments as well. But, two years be
fore winning the collegiate tennis
triple crown, Whitlinger, too, was a
warrior. In 1972, he played sixth sin
gles as a freshman.
Perhaps it was that year which
gave Whitlinger his uncanny un
derstanding about what being a
Road Warrior is all about. "Whit
gave us the name," Elliott said.
"He's as much a warrior as any
one now. It was Whit who brought
our attention to this feeling of
pride about playing on the back
courts."
Becker, never afraid to ex
pound on the wrestling metaphor,
offered the following analysis of
his coach. "I don't know if you've
ever seen pro wrestling, but Ax
and Smash come out during the
match and fight, and their manag
er goes crazy, right there beside
them with a big cape and his face
all painted. That manager guy —
that's Whit. I mean, Whit is a leg
end. Half the people that go out to
the bleachers to watch us go just to
watch him coach."
While that may be a bit of a
stretch, to say that the Warriors

are the key to winning this year's
NCAA crown is not. UCLA, the
current No. 1 team, is extremely
strong at one through three (all
are ranked in the top 30, and Stan
ford is 0-9 against them in their
three encounters this season), and
tennis insiders are saying that the
Cardinal will need to rely on its
depth if it is to repeat as NCAA
champions.
That, after all, is the chief aim
of the Warriors, and of the entire
team. Last year, Becker won the
deciding match of the NCAA finals
to clinch the title. Above his bed
hangs a photo immortalizing the
event. In it, Becker is leapingwith
excitement — although his two
inch vertical leaves much to be de
sired.
"That was far and away the
greatest moment in my tennis ca
reer," he says. "1 want that feeling
again."
There you have it: Stanford's
Road Warriors. Ax, Smash and
their caped coach certainly are not
the most glamorous trio around —
they do not have the highest rank
ings, the most fans or the best
form — but these guys just might
have the most fun.
Just when you thought pro
fessional wrestling had finally
disappeared, it emerges at the
forefront of Stanford athletics.
The Road Warriors are back, and
this time, the hitting isn't fake.
Ax, Smash and their cape-clad
coach have invaded Cardinal ter
ritory, and they are slugging with
as much force as ever — only this
time it's with tennis racquets.
No, the World Wrestling Fed
eration greats have not added
Wilson Pro-Staffs to their supply
of illegal weaponry. Rather, a
new generation of Road Warriors
has emerged, and they are play
ing tennis for the defending na
tional champions.
John Whitlinger, Ricky Beck
er and Grant Elliott are carrying
a meaner demeanor to the courts
with them these days, and with a
toughness only before seen in the
rings of the WWF, they are blow
ing through opponents. But of all
WWF heroes, why the Road War
riors?
Whitlinger, who as assistant
coach oversees the fourth
through sixth singles players
during Cardinal matches, offi
cially coined the name back in
February at the Rolex National
Indoor Championships.
"I actually picked it up at a
Stanford basketball game," he
said. "There were a couple of
guys in wheelchairs, and I guess
they called themselves the Road
Warriors. I like the name, and it

seemed to fit our guys."
It fits so very well because of
the way most collegiate tennis
matches are set up geographical
ly. "It seems like everywhere we
play, there tire three main courts,
and three outer courts," Becker
said. "Grant and I always have to
travel out to the boondocks to
play our matches. That's where
the 'road' part comes in. We've
always been warriors."
Elliott and Becker are Stan
ford's fifth and sixth singles
starters, respectively, and they
are bringing a new sense of pres
tige to the bottom of the lineup.
Over the past two years, they
have compiled a combined dual
match record of 74-14. For those
who don't want to do the math,
that's a whopping .841 winning
percentage.
"People talk about Stanford's
depth. Well, we are that depth,"
said a beaming Becker. "By nam
ing ourselves the Road Warriors,
as whacked-out as it may seem, it
gave us an extra dose of pride
about playing down at five and
six.
Stanford's fourth singles play
er is also plagued with having to
hike to his undoubtedly distant
court site. Recently, freshman
Ryan Wolters — ranked No. 9 na
tionally — has been the starter at
No. 4. But, according to Elliott
and Becker, Wolters just doesn't
