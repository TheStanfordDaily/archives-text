# There's no stopping the Road Warriors
## Becker, Elliot shine for the Cardinal despite playing at bottom of the lineup

Just when you thought pro
fessional wrestling had finally
disappeared, it emerges at the
forefront of Stanford athletics.
The Road Warriors are back, and
this time, the hitting isn't fake.
Ax, Smash and their cape-clad
coach have invaded Cardinal ter
ritory, and they are slugging with
as much force as ever — only this
time it's with tennis racquets.
No, the World Wrestling Fed
eration greats have not added
Wilson Pro-Staffs to their supply
of illegal weaponry. Rather, a
new generation of Road Warriors
has emerged, and they are play
ing tennis for the defending na
tional champions.
John Whitlinger, Ricky Beck
er and Grant Elliott are carrying
a meaner demeanor to the courts
with them these days, and with a
toughness only before seen in the
rings of the WWF, they are blow
ing through opponents. But of all
WWF heroes, why the Road War
riors?
Whitlinger, who as assistant
coach oversees the fourth
through sixth singles players
during Cardinal matches, offi
cially coined the name back in
February at the Rolex National
Indoor Championships.
"I actually picked it up at a
Stanford basketball game," he
said. "There were a couple of
guys in wheelchairs, and I guess
they called themselves the Road
Warriors. I like the name, and it

seemed to fit our guys."
It fits so very well because of
the way most collegiate tennis
matches are set up geographical
ly. "It seems like everywhere we
play, there tire three main courts,
and three outer courts," Becker
said. "Grant and I always have to
travel out to the boondocks to
play our matches. That's where
the 'road' part comes in. We've
always been warriors."
Elliott and Becker are Stan
ford's fifth and sixth singles
starters, respectively, and they
are bringing a new sense of pres
tige to the bottom of the lineup.
Over the past two years, they
have compiled a combined dual
match record of 74-14. For those
who don't want to do the math,
that's a whopping .841 winning
percentage.
"People talk about Stanford's
depth. Well, we are that depth,"
said a beaming Becker. "By nam
ing ourselves the Road Warriors,
as whacked-out as it may seem, it
gave us an extra dose of pride
about playing down at five and
six.
Stanford's fourth singles play
er is also plagued with having to
hike to his undoubtedly distant
court site. Recently, freshman
Ryan Wolters — ranked No. 9 na
tionally — has been the starter at
No. 4. But, according to Elliott
and Becker, Wolters just doesn't
have what it takes to be a real
warrior. "Wolters is technically a
road warrior, but he's kind of a
