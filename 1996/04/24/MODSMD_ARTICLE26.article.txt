# Women's tennis poised for another title run
## Cardinal begins the road to NCAAs at this week's Pac-10 Championships 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The No. 2-ranked Stanford women's
tennis team has concluded the dual
match season and is headed for the
NCAA championships in Tallahassee,
Fla., in May. But what lies in its imme
diate future is the Pacific 10 Confer
ence championships.
The Pac-10 championships, located
annually in Ojai, Calif., is not team-ori
ented, but instead consists of individual
singles and doubles championships.
In addition to vying for Pac-10 hon
ors, the conference championship tour
naments traditionally allow players
who might not qualify for NCAA sin
gles and doubles championships an op
portunity to turn some heads.
"It's a good chance to get some qual
ity wins over other teams' No. 1 or No.
2 players, so that you can get into
NCAAs," said Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan.
The Cardinal will send its No. 3
through No. 6 singles players into the
singles draw and two doubles teams
into the 16-team doubles field.

Stanford Ail-Americans Ania
Bleszynski and Katie Schlukebir, who
will make the NCAA draw regardless,
will not be making the trip to Ojai.
"Katie felt like she was a little
burned out at the end of last year,"
Brennan said. "So we decided she
would skip Ojai this year and see if she
arrives at NCAAs in a better state of
mind. Ania just needs to be here for aca
demic reasons, and since it is for her
and not the team, she thought she
should stay home."
Bleszynski and Schlukebir teamed
up a year ago to take the Pac-10 doubles
title at Ojai.
The Stanford roster boasts yet an
other former Pac-10 champion in San
dra De Silva. The Cardinal junior, cur
rently ranked No. 20 in collegiate sin
gles, made a name for herself as a 112 resh
man when she stunned the conference
by winning the Pac-10 singles title.
The path to a second crown for De
Silva begins with Washington's Kori
Sosnowy, who lost in her only match
against the Cardinal this season.
De Silva most likely would not have
made the NCAA singles tournament

two years ago without that impressive
showing at Ojai.

tournament, will have her hands full in
the first round. Scott will find herself
across the net from USC's Karolina
Baklarova, a Cardinal killer in the last
three weeks.
In two dual matches against Stan
ford, Baklarova defeated both Sandra
De Silva at No. 3 singles and senior Kim
Shasby at the No. 4 position. Baklarova
is ranked No. 77 in the nation, and
Scott is No. 99 with an 20-1 dual-match
record this season. Scott has won her
last 12 matches.

No. 64 Shasby will meet Oregon'sAli
Napier. Stanford has not seen Napier
or the Oregon Ducks this season.
Stanford's final competitor with an
automatic bid in the singles draw is
Amy Chiminello, no stranger to Ojai as
a redshirt senior. Chiminello will col
lide with California's Amanda Augus
tus, who is 0-2 against the Cardinal this
season. Both Schlukebir and De Silva
defeated Augustus in straight sets in
dual-match competition. The Golden
Bear freshman is rated No. 45 in the na
tion, while Chiminello is unranked.
With a record of 20-1 this season and
a 85-7 career record, Chiminello has
moved into fourth place in the Stanford
record books for career dual-match vic
tories, behind only Teri Whitlinger,
Lisa Green and Heather Willens.
The top four seeds in the singles field
are Arizona's Vicky Maes, UCLA's Keri
Phebus, Arizona State's Reka Cseres
nyes and UCLA's Paige Yaroshuk.
Maes is the top-rated singles player in
the country.
In doubles, the Cardinal will enter
its No. 2 and No. 3 doubles teams
into the field. Shasby and Scott did
not receive the most favorable of
draw positions, meeting second
seeded Phebus and Yaroshuk in
the first round. Bleszynski and
Schlukebir have defeated the
sixth-ranked UCLA tandem twice
in straight sets.
"That \sill be tough," Brennan

said. "Hut that is the kind of match
you want. You want to win some
quality matches like that so that
you can get into the tournament."
Cardinal junior Emily Burt and
senior Beth Berris will represent
the Cardinal in the other side of
(he bracket. They will meet Cal's
Augustus and Francesca La'O in
the opening round. Augustus and
La'O compete at the No. 1 position
for the Golden Bears and lost in a
three-set match to Stanford's
Bleszynski and Schlukebir in
March.

In addition to the singles and
doubles draws, the conference pro
vides invitational singles and dou
bles tournaments for players who
did not make the primary fields.
In singles, Burt, Berris, Heidi
Stalla and Sophy Woodhouse will
compete for the Cardinal. Stalla
and Woodhouse, both walk-ons,
will also see action in the invita
tional doubles draw. The tandem,
which lost a tight three-set match
to UCLA last weekend, will meet
USC's Baklarova and Aysha
Zaman.
