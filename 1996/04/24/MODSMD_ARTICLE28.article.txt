# Big league baseball could use another Kirby Puckett
## 
### 
Major league baseball executives may
be pleased with the start of this
year's season, the first normal 162-
game season baseball fans have seen in three
years.
But I'm not happy — one of the main rea
sons I follow baseball is missing. The missing
link probably went unnoticed by you, and by
many others, given the fact that only five
feet, nine inches and 223 pounds are absent
from this season.
I am talking about Kirby Puckett, my fa
vorite baseball player of all time, who em
bodies everything that is right in sports
today. Puckett, a lifetime outfielder for the
Minnesota Twins, is currently on the dis
abled list due to an eye problem caused by the
early stages of glaucoma. While "Puck" in
tends to be back before the season is over,
many believe he might not get to play base
ball again.
Say it ain't so, Puck.
It is important to realize that the reasons
Puckett remains one of the most popular
baseball players in the league do not solely
revolve around his accomplishments on the
field, though they are impressive. Rather,
what makes Puck such a solid individual and
ball player is that he is a good person off the
field.
Puckett boasts statistics that rival any
player in the game today. During his 12-year
career Puckett has maintained a .318 bat
ting average, while amassing 2,304 hits, 207
home runs and 1,085 RBIs. He has been
named to the All-Star team 10 times (he was
MVP in 1993), and carried the Twins to vic
tories in two World Series, in which he batted
.308 and knocked in seven runs. In addition,
Puck has won six Golden Gloves for his ex
cellent play in the field.
Barrv Bonds has these kinds of numbers,

as do many other current MLB stars. But
what sets Kirby apart from the superstars of
today is that he remains down-to earth. He
has a sense of team loyalty — he opted to stay
with the Twins when he could have signed
for more money elsewhere. He plays the
game with confidence, humor and class. He
does not argue with umpires, taunt his oppo
nents or ignore his fans.

Puckett also appreciates and honors his
responsibility as a major public figure and
serves as a positive role model for baseball
fans everywhere. In 1993, he won the
Branch Rickey Award for service to his com
munity in Minneapolis. In 1995, he added
the Carl R. Pohland award for community
service as well. He spends his off-season vis
iting hospitals, helping at shelters and par
ticipating in celebrity sports tournaments to
help raise money for charity.
Throughout the 11 years I have spent fol
lowing Kirby, I have never heard a player,
coach or fan say something bad about him.
Puckett was named the ninth-best outfield
er ever by Baseball Digest, and repeatedly
has pnrnod the titles of "Best Role Model"
and "Friendliest Player" in Baseball Ameri-
