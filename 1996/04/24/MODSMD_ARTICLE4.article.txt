# Dudley says environment and business can coexist
## 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Echoing the words of Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, Barbara Dud
ley, the executive director of Greenpeace
U.S.A., told an audience of about 150 that
smart environmental thinking is also
smart business thinking.
"We've done a very good job of separat
ing ourselves from the planet," she said,

pointing out that Bishop Auditorium,
where she spoke, is climate-controlled,
has no windows and is largely made out of
synthetic materials that do not resemble
anything in nature.
But she spent the rest of her speech
pointing out how impossible it is to sepa
rate people and their business activities
from the outside world, noting that "there

is no other source of resources and
no other place to put our waste."
Greenpeace, Dudley said, has
been trying to "appeal to those in
dustries where self-interest would
be most directly threatened" by en
vironmental problems. She said
this included the insurance indus
try, explaining that the climate
changes brought about by the
greenhouse effect are causing nat
ural disasters such as large storms
to become more frequent and se
vere.
Dudley said she hoped the bank
ing and insurance industries would
act as a counterweight to the oil,
coal and natural gas companies
that she said oppose measures to
end climate change.
While many bankers and insur
ers have signed statements endors
ing such measures, "what we want
is for them to take their trillions of
dollars of investment funds and
put their money where their mouth
is," she said, meaning withdrawing
investments from the fossil fuel in
dustry.
"We need the money invested in
renewables, in energy efficiency, in
solutions," Dudley said.
For the United States, the solu
tions she had in mind included end
ing government subsidies to the oil,
gas and coal industries.
Much of her speech, however,
focused on the problems of other
countries. She praised Christopher
for his recent speech at Stanford
which outlined the role of environ
mental concerns in U.S. foreign
policy, but criticized him for giving
aid to Ukraine in order to keep the
remaining nuclear reactors at
Chernobyl operating.
Dudley suggested an "environ
mental Marshall plan" that would
pursue efficiency and alternative
fuels, rather than spending
money to maintain the conven
tional and nuclear power plants of
the world.

The $3 billion set aside to keep
the Chernobyl reactors active could
instead be used to fund energy effi
ciency programs, hire "energy en
gineers" from the West to refit
homes and factories so that they
use less power and import gas tur
bines from the United States that
are no longer needed by the defense
industry.
Dudley said the energy Cher
nobyl now generates could be gen
erated by natural gas for a year,
and after that point by biomass.
In addition to their environmen
tal benefits, gas turbines would cre
ate 12,000 jobs in the United States
and 61,000 in Ukraine, according
to a Greenpeace study which Dud
ley cited.
Dudley said the opposition
sometimes assumed to exist be
tween environmental concerns and
the need to create jobs was "always
a false issue." If there is an envi
ronmentally sound way to do some
thing and an environmentally un
sound way to do it, the former is
generally "more labor-intensive
and less capital-intensive," Dudley
said.
For the jobs to be created in this
country and for the "environmen
tal Marshall plan" to go into action,
"all it takes is for our government
to make a commitment," Dudley
said.
However, she said that such
commitments are more the excep
tion than the rule in this county.
Solar power would be competitive
now if it had the same level of in
vestment from the financial com
munity that conventional methods
do, she said.
Continuing to invest in the fossil
fuel industry with its limited fu
ture, she said, "just isn't right from
a business point of view."
Yesterday's speech was the sev
enth Von Gugelberg Memorial Lec
ture. This annual series of lectures
by prominent figures in the envi
ronmental community was estab
lished in memory of Conradin Von
Gugelberg, who died in 1987, hav
ing only recently received his MBA
from Stanford.
