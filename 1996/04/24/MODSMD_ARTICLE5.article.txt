# EV begins $9M project
## Escondido undergoes seismic construction 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Construction on a $9 million project to make
Escondido Village more seismically safe will
begin next month, Housing officials announced
in a letter sent out to effected Escondido resi
dents yesterday.
The changes, finalized after years of plan
ning, will begin May 8 and occur simultaneous
ly with the renovation which is part of the Uni
versity's Capital Improvement Plan, Director of
Housing and Dining Services Keith Guy said.
"Instead of doing piecemeal work, we will do
it all at once," said Rodger Whitney, assistant di
rector of Housing and Dining Services for Hous
ing Facilities. "This will mean less disruption
over time for the students."
Guy said the budget is debt-funded, which
means the money is borrowed from the Univer
sity. The project will be financed by money from
students who live on campus during the year
and from conferences which use University
housing during the summer.
In coordination with Facilities Project Man
agement, Housing and Dining Services is in
charge of this two-phased project to strengthen
five Escondido apartment buildings.
There are 1,300 apartments in Escondido, di
vided into low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise build
ings. Ijow-rise buildings — which families with
children occupy — have one to two stories, mid
rise buildings have eight stories, and the two
high-rise buildings have 12 stories.
The seismic strengthening project involves
construction of only the five mid-rise buildings.
The other buildings were built in a different
time period and do not require any seismic work.
During the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the
mid-rise buildings suffered more visible damage
while the others were relatively unscathed.
Currently, the Escondido mid-rise buildings
are safe to live in, Whitney said. The project
was not mandated by a code; rather, the Uni
versity is making efforts to make all buildings
on campus as strong and resilient to seismic ac-
tivity as possible.
"No one is saying we have to do
this," Whitney said. "We are just
trying to keep up with the technolo
gy on these types of buildings."
Phase one of the two-phased seis
mic retrofitting project will begin in
Abrams, one of the five mid-rise
apartments. This phase will consist
of a series of steel collars being af
fixed at specific column locations in
the basement and first-floor apart
ments. Since these areas in Abrams
are currently unoccupied, residents
will not have to relocate when con
struction begins this spring.
However, residents living in
first-floor apartments of any of the
five mid-rise buildings will have to
relocate this June for the summer.
These buildings include Barne,
Hulme, Hoskins and McFarland, in
addition to Abrams.
Every effort will be made to relo

cate these residents to an upper
floor apartment in the same build
ing, according to Whitney. In all
cases, residents are guaranteed
housing somewhere in Escondido
and will be provided moving boxes.
The cost for transferring telephones
will be paid by Housing Services.
The segments of construction work
that will produce intense noise will
be limited to the hours of 10 a.m. to
2 p.m. for a two-week period only,
which will not correspond to Dead
or Finals Weeks.
The completion date of phase one
is estimated to be Aug. 31.
After completion of phase one,
the next five summers will be devot
ed to phase two. Phase two will
begin in the summer of 1997 and
will consist of the renovation of the
other floors of the five mid-rise
buildings. Each of the five summers
will be devoted to one of the five
buildings, beginning again with
Abrams. The building under reno
vation will be completely vacated for
the summer.
"We wish we did not have to move

people," Whitney said. "We will try
to assign students who will be grad
uating in June to the buildings
scheduled for work the following
summer." Thus, the number of nec
essary relocations will be decreased,
since many of the residents would
naturally leave afler graduation.
Renovation of University hous
ing is generally done during the
summer, when most students are
gone and houses and dorms are va
cant. Because graduate students
often live in their Escondido apart
ments year-round, maintenance
and renovation are also ongoing
throughout the year.
Capital Improvement Plan reno
vations will include new painting,
vinyl flooring in the kitchen and
bathroom, new carpeting, window
coverings and new furniture. The
project also consists of installing
new hallway carpet, new paint, im
proved lighting, refurbishing of ex
isting elevators and newly designed
and furnished lounges.
The total cost for renovating Es
condido, including the seismic retro

fitting, is estimated at $40 million.
Total renovation of Escondido is ex
pected to be completed by the sum
mer of 2001. Of the 1,300 Escondido
apartment units, 570 units will be
renovated by the end of summer.
The Capital Improvement Plan,
which began in the summer of
1993, has funded all recent renova
tions of campus housing, such as
Wilbur, Florence Moore and Stern
Halls and a number of Row houses.
Construction will also be done this
summer in Lagunita Court, and
the French, Delta Kappa Epsilon
and Kairos Houses on the Row,
Guv said.
When any building on campus is
renovated, attention is paid to what
can be done to make the building
more resilient in the event of seismic
activity. Yet, according to Whitney,
many buildings that are part of Uni
versity housing are already above
the satisfactory level of safety.
The Capital Improvement Plan,
originally set to be a 10-year project,
is now on a 12-year plan. Estimated
cost is $170 million, Guy said.
