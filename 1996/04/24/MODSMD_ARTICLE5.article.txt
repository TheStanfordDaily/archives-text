# EV begins $9M project
## Escondido undergoes seismic construction 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Construction on a $9 million project to make
Escondido Village more seismically safe will
begin next month, Housing officials announced
in a letter sent out to effected Escondido resi
dents yesterday.
The changes, finalized after years of plan
ning, will begin May 8 and occur simultaneous
ly with the renovation which is part of the Uni
versity's Capital Improvement Plan, Director of
Housing and Dining Services Keith Guy said.
"Instead of doing piecemeal work, we will do
it all at once," said Rodger Whitney, assistant di
rector of Housing and Dining Services for Hous
ing Facilities. "This will mean less disruption
over time for the students."
Guy said the budget is debt-funded, which
means the money is borrowed from the Univer
sity. The project will be financed by money from
students who live on campus during the year
and from conferences which use University
housing during the summer.
In coordination with Facilities Project Man
agement, Housing and Dining Services is in
charge of this two-phased project to strengthen
five Escondido apartment buildings.
There are 1,300 apartments in Escondido, di
vided into low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise build
ings. Ijow-rise buildings — which families with
children occupy — have one to two stories, mid
rise buildings have eight stories, and the two
high-rise buildings have 12 stories.
The seismic strengthening project involves
construction of only the five mid-rise buildings.
The other buildings were built in a different
time period and do not require any seismic work.
During the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the
mid-rise buildings suffered more visible damage
while the others were relatively unscathed.
Currently, the Escondido mid-rise buildings
are safe to live in, Whitney said. The project
was not mandated by a code; rather, the Uni
versity is making efforts to make all buildings
on campus as strong and resilient to seismic ac-
