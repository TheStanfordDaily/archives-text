## 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Dean of Students Marc Wais an
nounced yesterday the appointment of
Jennifer Perkins to fill the spot of judi
cial affairs officer until a permanent re
placement can be found.
Perkins, a recent graduate of the
Stanford School of Education, replaces
Sally Cole, who worked more than '20
years at Stanford.
The judicial officer's duties include,
among other things, investigating al
leged infractions of the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code, educating
students on the judicial system and over
seeing the judgments of judicial commit
tees.
Perkins said she was "delighted and
happy" to be assuming the post, al
though it is a temporary assignment.

"Currently, the Committee of 15 de
cides how to proceed with selecting a re
placement," said Perkins. "I should be
here until the summer of 1997, when a
permanent replacement will be in
place."
The Committee of 15, consisting of
students, faculty members and adminis
trators, is charged with reforming the
current judicial process.
Wais said he was extremely pleased
with the appointment of Perkins.
"Jennifer's past professional experi
ence in student and judicial affairs, cou
pled with her familiarity with the Stan
ford community, uniquely prepares her
for this challenging position," Wais said.
Wais added that the University is for
tunate to have someone of Perkins'
background and expertise.
Perkins graduated with a bachelor's
degree in psychology from Pomona Col

lege and earned a master's degree in ed
ucation from Stanford. She then went
on to serve as recruiting coordinator for
the University of Arizona and as assis
tant dean of campus life at Pomona.
After arriving at Stanford in 1994, she
worked closely with Multicultural Edu
cator Tommy Lee Woon and the Office of
Student Affairs, assisting in strategic re
search projects to the faculty fellows
program.
Perkins said she was looking forward
to taking over the job of judicial affairs
officer but doesn't expect much of a
"honeymoon period."
"No, I will hit the ground running,
there are a number of cases that require
our immediate attention," Perkins said.
Perkins said she could not comment
on any of the cases she would soon be
working on due to rules of confiden
tiality.
