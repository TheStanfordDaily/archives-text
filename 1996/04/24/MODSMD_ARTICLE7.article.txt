# Medicine prof testifies in DNA case
## Billings says mandatory contribution violates individual's privacy Focus on Science 
### Therese Lee 
Assoc. Internal Medicine Prof. Paul
Billings testified in a military court-mar
tial last week that compulsory contribu
tion to the Pentagon's DNA Repository
violated an individual's privacy and
proved an inappropriate use of genetic
technology.
A leader in research on genetic dis
crimination, Billings offered his expertise
on the problems of civil rights that ac
company the so-called "genetic revolu
tion."
Billings testified in the trial of two
Marines, Cpl. John Mayfield and Cpl.
Joseph Vlacovsky, who refused to give
blood for the Pentagon DNA Repository.
He criticized the Pentagon program for
its lack of safeguards to protect individual
privacy.
"The DNA bank was unlimited in its
use," Billings said. "It was going to have
DNA samples of 15 to 20 million Ameri
cans â€” mostly civilians."
The Pentagon has been routinely col

lecting DNA samples from all enlisted
men and women and civil servants since
1993. The two Marines, who are based in
Honolulu, narrowly escaped going to jail
for their refusal to contribute their DNA.
"The Mayfield case was an absolutely
historic case," Billings said. "The fact
that they brought this case to public at
tention has not only raised the issues of
involuntary DNA banks; it also caused a
very substantial reform of the Depart
ment of the Defense."
Originally, the specimens were to be
stored for 75 years. But due to a legal
challenge and a study done by Billings,
the Pentagon revised its DNA policy two
weeks ago. Samples will now be stored for
only 50 years and will be destroyed with
in 180 days upon the request of the donor
after completion of military service.
"This is a major victory for the devel
opment of appropriate genetic technology
in the American society," Billings said.
As knowledge of the human genome
steadily increases, the discovery of genes
that cause problems ranging from heart
disorders to cancer becomes easier and
easier. However, these discoveries also
can allow discrimination against people

because of their genetic makeup, Billings
said.
Billings co-authored a case study on
the individual, family and societal dimen
sions of genetic discrimination. Printed a
month ago in the British journal, Science
and Engineering Ethics, the study found
that 50 percent of respondents said they
had been discriminated against despite
being asymptomatic.
All participants in the study were de
finitive carriers of a gene for some dis
ease, Billings said. Of the 27,790 screen
ing questionnaires mailed out, 917 were
returned. Four-hundred-fifty-five people
reported experiences of genetic discrimi
nation. Ramifications included exclusion
from insurance benefits and contracts,
the loss of jobs and promotions and severe
drawbacks with adoption agencies and
blood banks.
However, Billings said there is fctill a
long way to go to rid DNA banks of their
substantial threat to individual privacy
and high potential for genetic discrimina
tion. According to Billings, all contribu
tors should be thoroughly informed of the
limits of the use of their DNA and
all the risks and benefits of the
storage material.
The Human Genome Project is
currently busy sequencing all the
DNA in the human body. Geneti
cists involved with the project hope

to have accomplished their goal by
2005.
"The issues of health insurance
and privacy that genetics highlight
so starkly will increasingly be seen
as broader problems that will need
broad solutions far beyond just ge
netics," said Law Prof. Henry
Greely, chair of the steering com
mittee of the Stanford Program in
Genomics, Ethics and Society.
As the controversy continues,

the project quietly plods on in its
quest to sequence the entire
human genetic makeup.
"The final impact of the
I Human] Genome Project will be
highly dependent on the society in
which that information is accumu
lated," Billings said. "If we become
a more inclusive society, where
more people have access to health
aire, where more people are em
ployed and have more access to fi

naricial security, then the benefits
of the Genome Project will be like
ly to be substantially for the good.
"We have to have a general con
sensus in our society that genetic
diversity and differences, like
racial, ethnic, religious and sexual
orientation differences, will not
become a ticket to becoming a
member of the underclass or a
marginalized class in the coming
days," Billings said.
