Some people think this guy knows it all
I didn't know Northwestern had such terrific field studies programs: Chicago
Field Studies, the Archaeological Field School, and the Field
School. With the Ethnographic Field School, I could help solve social, educa
tional, and economic problems on a Navajo reservation or in a Spanish-speaking
community in northern New Mexico. There's also the Archaeological Field
School. I've always wanted to take part in an archaeological dig. This year, the
Archaeological Field School is doing fieldwork in the Middle Rio Grande
Valley. Then again,the Chicago Field Studies program offers an inside look at
the economic, political, and social forces in city life through a summer-long
internship in one of Chicago's many agencies, organizations, and movements.
Whatever 1 choose, all three offer the chance to earn college credit this summer.
1 never thought of
Northwestern as a summer
hot spot, but the campus is
right on Lake Michigan.
They've got beaches, intra
mural sports, arts and crafts
workshops, wine-tasting and
pottery making minicourses,
basketball and volleyball
tournaments, campus musi
cals and theatrical perfor
mances, outdoor movies, and
hiking and canoeing trips in
Wisconsin. All with
Northwestern Summer
Session '96... Pretty cool.

1 could tise some extra credit
this summer, and I think
Northwestern's the place to go.
Summertime means smaller
classes and better access to some
of Northwestern's most popular
professors. They even have a
course on the Beatles, and if I
get ambitious, I can earn a full
year of college credit with
Northwestern's eight-week
intensive course sequences in
physics, chemistry, and nine lan
guages. ltd be nice to go back to
school in the fall with a few
extra credits on my transcript.
Summer in the Windy City
sounds like a hot time.
Chicago has jazzfests, blues
fests, and gospelfests, Cubs
and Sox games, some of the
best museums and art galleries
in the world, and ethnic festi
vals all summer 10ng... I'd
have plenty to do, and it's all
just minutes from the
Northwestern campus.
Actually, he just knows about our catalog...
Northwestern University
Summer Session '96
...and you can too. Just call l-800-FINDS-NU
for a free Summer Session '96 catalog
or e-mail summer@nwu.edu
and get ahead this summer.
