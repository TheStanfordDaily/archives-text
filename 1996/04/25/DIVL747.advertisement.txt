DRUNK DRIVING DOESN'T
JUSTKILL DRUNK DRIVERS.
Alonzo Drake, killed 3/17/91 at
10:53pm on Robbins lid.. Harvest, AL.
Next time your friend insists on
driving drunk, do whatever it takes to
stop him. Because if he kills innocent
people, how will you live with yourself?
FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS DRIVE DRUNK.
