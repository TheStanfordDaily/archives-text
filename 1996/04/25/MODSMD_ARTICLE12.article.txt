## Officials say they no longer seek Israel's destruction 
### 
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) —
Closing a bloody chapter in history,
the Palestinians' parliament-in
exile declared yesterday that it no
longer sought Israel's destruction
and had abandoned armed strug
gle.
With the vote, the Palestine
National Council moved peacemak
ing with Israel back on track even
as Israeli warplanes bombed fellow
Arabs in Lebanon. It gave a boost to
both Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who
had threatened to suspend peace
talks if the PLO leader missed his
promise to remove the offending
charter sections by May 7.
The historic import of the action
was clear to the Palestinian leaders,
many of them former guerrillas.
"I voted for this position to give
peace a chance," said Mohammed
Abbas — also known by his nom
de-guerre Abul Abbas — master
mind of the 1985 Achille Lauro
hijacking in which a disabled Amer
ican cruise passenger was shot and
killed. "This is a message from the
fighters to the world and the Israeli
people that we can take a step for
ward toward peace."
In a show of hands, the council
voted 504-54 with 14 abstentions to

revoke all clauses in the 1964 PLO
founding charter that call for the
elimination of Israel. The council
decided all articles of the PLO char
ter that contradict letters of mutu
al recognition exchanged by Israel
and the PLO in 1993 would be abol
ished, and that work should begin
on writing a new charter.
The vote was held behind closed
doors and there was no debate. Sev
eral PNC members ran up to the
podium afterward and hugged and
kissed a haggard-looking Arafat.
Peres — running neck and neck
with hard-line challenger Benjamin
Netanyahu in the campaign for the
May 29 presidential election —
needed a clear Palestinian stand
against violence to help persuade
an increasingly skeptical Israeli
electorate that Arafat is serious
about reconciliation.
An elated Peres said the vote
proved Arafat was a partner for
peace.
"People always asked, 'Can you
trust Arafat?' It emerges that he
can be trusted," Peres said. "We are
not iii a perfect world, but he is bat
tling terrorism, he changed the
charter, exactly as he set out to do."
Trust between the two sides was
deeply shaken by four suicide

attacks by Palestinian militants in
Israel in February and March. The
bombings killed 63 people, includ
ing four assailants.
Israeli government spokesman
Uri Dromi said he hoped Arafat
would now apply the same resolve
to crushing the Islamic militant
groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
During the three-day PNC
meeting that began Monday, Arafat
cajoled, threatened and maneu
vered to get the necessary majority
of 446, or two-thirds of total PNC
membership, to vote for amending
the charter.
On Tuesday, he threatened
hard-liners that it would be on their
conscience if the Palestinians lost
their last shot at statehood. In a
move that apparently clinched his
victory, he appointed 98 new PNC
members, most of them Arafat loy
alists.
Arafat called the vote "positive
and constructive." He said it was
now Israel's turn to honor its com
mitments.
Arafat rammed the decision
through the council at a time when
even Arab moderates, including
Egypt imd Jordan, were blasting
Israel for its two-week bombing
and artillery blitz in Lebanon.
