# Congress, White House agree on bill

WASHINGTON (AP) - Congression
al leaders and White House officials
announced agreement yesterday on a
huge bill financing dozens of federal
agencies for the rest of the fiscal year,
solving a months-long standoff that had
become a political embarrassment for
both parties.
Nearly seven months after fiscal 1996
began, the two sides resolved a handful
of stubborn environmental disputes and
prepared to push the $160 billion mea
sure through Congress tomorrow.
"I believe the president will find it
acceptable," White House chief of staff
Leon Panetta told reporters after the two
sides ended yet another day of closed
door bargaining.
"We believe we have agreement oil
remaining issues," said Senate Appropri
ations Committee Chairman Mark Hat
field, R-Ore.
About an hour later, presidential

press secretary Mike McCurry told
reporters Clinton would sign the legisla
tion as soon as it reaches his desk.
"The administration is satisfied that
the president's priorities have been
addressed as well as they can be
addressed," McCurry said.
The wide-ranging agreement is likely
to alienate some conservatives unhappy
that its spending cuts are not deep
enough and some liberals upset that pro
grams are slashed too steeply. But top
House Republicans and Democrats pre
dicted passage with support from both
parties.
"I think what we have is a consensus
that most members in the House,
Republican and Democrat. . . will ulti
mately vote for," said House Appropria
tions Committee Chairman Bob Liv
ingston, R-La.
The bargainers announced no details
of their plan, saying they still had to dis

cuss the package with President Clinton
and congressional leaders.
One of the final major impediments
was cleared when bargainers solved a
dispute over logging in the Tongass
national forest. According to participants
from both parties who spoke on condi
tion of anonymity, negotiators agreed to
create a buyout program for timber
industry workers who might lose their
jobs from reduced logging. The buyouts
could cost $100 million and would be
paid for by reducing other programs, the
officials said.
Money for agencies covered by the bill
was due to run out at midnight, since
they have been financed all fiscal year by
a series of temporary stopgap bills. So to
head off a third federal shutdown since
autumn, the House voted 400-14 to keep
programs running for 24 more hours,
and the Senate, by voice vote, shipped it
to Clinton for his expected signature.
