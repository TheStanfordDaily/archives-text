Firefighter kills wife, supervisors
JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A firefighter killed his wife at
home, then went to a firehouse and opened fire on his
supervisors yesterday, killing four department officials
before being wounded in a shootout, police said.
Kenneth Tornes, a eight-year veteran, led police on a
high speed chase from the downtown fire department to
the parking lot of a busy suburban shopping center, caus
ing several wrecks, one involving an ambulance.
At the North Park Mall in Ridgeland, a suburban com
munity that borders Jackson, Tornes wounded one officer
before being shot in the left eye.
Tornes was in serious but stable condition yesterday
after surgery.
Tornes had apparently made threatening statements
long before the shootings, another firefighter said.
"He was a perfect gentlemen except when you got him
talking about the chiefs," 14-year firefighter Tim Dukes
said. "Apparently he was upset about his wife and he came
here and did this. But he's been talking about this for
years."

ATM fees too high, politician says
WASHINGTON (AP) — Customers' anger over rising
ATM fees is so high that even a key banking industry ally,
House Banking Chairman Jim Leach, suggested yesterday
that bankers ought to hold off on any new increases.
"I think it would be wise for the industry to take a step
back and put a voluntary freeze on any surcharges," Leach,
R-lowa, said as a House Banking subcommittee opened two
days of hearings.
Bankers and ATM network operators strongly defended
their actions at the hearings, which were prompted by
actions earlier this month that could result in people being
charged twice for using cash machines owned by another
bank.
But inside the hearing room — and at ATMs on Wash
ington's streets — consumer anger was obvious.
"Why are we paying banks to make a profit on our
money when they're paying such low interest rates?" asked
Randy Capps of Washington after using a downtown ATM.
"I just feel like I'm spending more and more and getting
less and less for having my money in the bank."
