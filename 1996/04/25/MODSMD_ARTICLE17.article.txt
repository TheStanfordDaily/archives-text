Those opposed to new
constitution should not
lead its implementation

STUDENTS overwhelmingly
passed Constitution '96 last
week, and now the ASSU is
faced with the formidable task of
determining exactly how the new
constitution will be implemented.
To do so requires rewriting many
of the ASSU Bylaws to comply with
the new document, deciding how
and when to elect executives to
serve under the new single presi
dent system, setting up bylaws to
govern the judicial branch and
determining who will comprise the
30-member senate.
This work will require consider
able attention; the ASSU must
establish a committee to examine
the above questions, and others.
Unfortunately, neither of the two
committees yet proposed is fully
equal to the task, and one will quite
possibly hinder it.
At Tuesday's senate meeting,
Senate Chair Alane Murdock
announced the creation of a commit
tee to deal with issues of constitu
tional transition. Murdock said Con
stitution '96 author Michael Slem
mer, the members of the COP and
ASSU Financial Manager John Hall
will be invited to join her on the
committee, and that other interest
ed students may ask to join.
There is some question as to
whether Murdock has the authority
to create such a committee; it seems
that the bylaws delegate authority
over elections and bylaw modifac
tion to the senate's Administration
and Rules Committee. Regardless
of that issue, there are real ethical
concerns about her action.
Murdock was one of the chief
opponents of Constitution '96; along
with COP members Rich Stolz and
Nicole Vazquez — who will both be
on this new committee — she wrote
the official anti-Constitution '96

statement in the Elections Hand
book.
While Murdock is entitled to her
personal opinions and has the
right to find fault with Constitu
tion '96, it is entirely inappropri
ate that one of the document's
most vocal opponents place herself
in charge of its implementation.
Slemmer has refused to join Mur
dock's committee; anti-Constitution
'96 senators Angela Parker and
Christy Ramon will be members.
Quite clearly, and quite paradoxical
ly, Murdock is creating a panel to
implement Constitution '96 made up
of people who oppose the document.
Council of Presidents member
Jon Oram, a Constitution '96
sponsor, has proposed "a select
committee on Constitutional Tran
sition," consisting of himself, the
COP-elect, Slemmer, Hall, ASSU
Senate Parliamentarian Solomon
Lefler and ASSU senators Andre
Vanier and Steve Russell.
Oram's committee is even more
one-sided than Murdock's: excepting
the impartial Lefler, it is entirely
comprised of Constitution '96 sup
porters. Still, these people — precise
ly because they are supporters —
deserve a large role in this process.
This committee currently has an
"unofficial" status; the other COP
members have charged that Oram
lacks the authority to create a com
mittee unilaterally. In actuality —
and, apparently, unknown to Oram
— the current constitution guaran
tees that "any member of the [COP]
shall have the power ... to establish
committees," making his action
entirely acceptable. Furthermore, as
an avowed supporter of Constitution
'96, Oram has far more credibility to
chair a committee on constitutional
transition than does Murdock.
Oram should seek greater diversi
ty of opinion on his committee —
perhaps Murdock should be invited
to join — but his is the group to han
dle this job. Murdock should recog
nize that reality and retract the
wrongheaded proposal for her own
committee. Only by acting responsi
bly can the ASSU follow through on
the students' demand for change.
