# Drew Rapp
## Seeking companionship 
### 
THIS IS FOR readers who, like
myself, find themselves to be
pathologically pathetic. Fragile
creatures we are, taut little webs of nerves
barely stretched over swollen, tender
insecurities, straining to contain them
and trembling at each careless brush of
the cruel world. Shivering like Chi
huahuas we curl around our soft under
bellies and twitch through the gauntlet of
daily existence, or like tiny water balloons
we blobber through the rose garden of
life, praying each snag won't be our last.
Our friends are fairly accommodating
to our natures. They nudge us back into
the surf each time we beach ourselves.
They attend to us, grooming our wiry
coats, recognizing each little whimper for
help, propping up each wobble towards
disaster and scooping up the baggage at
the inevitable unraveling. It is our own
peculiar form of love — needy and nur
turing, pathetic and benevolent. The
pathology is a cruel mix, simultaneous
terror of others and need of their care,
reaching out and recoiling.
But friends can only pacify us. We
know the true panacea for our ails and
seek it desperately. We need romance. We
need a special someone; someone to love,
latch on to and smother.
But our co-dependence is not confined
to romance. It bleeds across the relation
ship spectrum. My own is borne of a
small-town upbringing, a well-known
spawning ground for idiosyncrasies (the

Coen brothers have become movie
moguls off this topic alone). In Pueblo,
Colorado, I became reliant on the comfort
of constant familiarity. Life there is a
never-ending "Cheers" episode. I can go
to the grocery store and never see a
stranger. The local mall is like a high
school reunion. I can name everyone on
the school board, and their pets. My
postal carrier's name is Robert. He
knows my birthday.
In Pueblo I became addicted to social
contact. Now I crave smiles of acknowl
edgment from cars stopped next to me at
intersections, the sound of my first name
at the counter of 7-Eleven. And these are
the things I miss here.
Familiarity crests sometime during
your sophomore year at Stanford. Before
that point you still see and meet new peo
ple most every day. After that point grad
uations and new classes cull your pool of
acquaintances and expand the pool of
people to whom you are irrelevant.
This problem is only magnified off
campus. California is simply too large
and too filled with people to feel other
wise. I live off campus, in the suburbs,
where lawns and fences have made isola
tion the norm. So I often go to San Fran
cisco, but like all cities, it intensifies iso
lation by surrounding you with people to
remind you that you are alone. I recently
visited Los Angeles, where city and sub
urb have been mixed to horrific effect.
L.A. is probably the first city to institu

tionalize the horrors of suburbia into a
form of city planning, sprawling its resi
dents across a desert and calling the
resulting diaspora a city.
My own defense against this anonymi
ty has always been a strong nesting urge:
find someone nice and cling tight. At least
you know you'll never be completely
alone, and your only real sacrifice is offer
ing someone else the same consolation —
hardly a sacrifice at all.
I've always argued inductively for this
defense before my incredulous friends
with something I call the "widow phe
nomena." There's something compelling
about the concept of a widow, the "star"
of the funeral, someone whose loss is
unique and profound. It implies that her
relationship with the deceased was the
most important story of both lives, and
something we should all aspire to have
before our own passing.
Then again, perhaps it is not coinciden
tal that widows are usually dressed like
tombstones — functionally they're not
dissimilar. Their meaning is, in part, orna
mental, as all lives lived for others must
eventually be. They exist to mark the pass
ing of another. A noble purpose perhaps,
but somehow darkly unfortunate too.
