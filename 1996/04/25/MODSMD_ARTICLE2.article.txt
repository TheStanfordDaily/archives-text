# New women's clinic launched
## 
### Nadia Elghobashi 
A new student-organized clinic located in the Med
ical Center will soon provide women with affordable
preventive health care and services not usually avail
able in other medical settings.
Opened in March, the Women's Health Promotion
Unit offers one-on-one counseling, support groups
and educational workshops on health issues for
women. The unit will begin receiving patients in a

couple of weeks and focus on preventing illness and
reducing health risks.
Because the clinic is run entirely by volunteers, it
will be able to offer services to women regardless of
their ability to pay. In addition to student volunteers,
the staff includes physicians, nurse practitioners, so
cial workers and health educators. Many of the unit's
services, which would typically cost up to $150 an
hour, are offered to patients for as
little as $5.
Senior Nisha Acharya, one of
the founders of the clinic, said stu
dents have been trying for the last
three years to get the project off
the ground. Earlier this year, the
Medical Center donated space and
malpractice insurance to the pro
ject, enabling students to estab
lish the clinic.
Still, organizing the project has
not been easy. "It's really hard
right now because there's no fund
ing at all," Acharya said.
The idea of offering women an
alternative approach to health
care was originated in the early
1980s by Richard Blum and Leroy
Heinrichs, both physicians at the
Medical Center.
Bureaucratic problems pre
vented Blum and Heinrichs from
forming a clinic similar to the new
one. But the opening of space in
the Department of Gynecology

and Obstetrics and the growing
appeal of HMOs allowed the unit
to get started.

women to look at
health as a combina
tion of social and bi
ological factors.'

The clinic wanted to offer
women a resource center that they
could not find at other clinics. "We
want to offer things that aren't
out there," Acharya said. "We will
out-refer people to places for ser
vices that are already offered."
Co-founder Charmian Lewis, a
senior, said she would like the clin
ic to emphasize a holistic approach
to health care. "We're trying to get
women to look at health as a com
bination of social and biological
factors." She said she wants to

help women become more as
sertive so they can make better
use of the resources available to
them.
Student volunteer Ingrid
Hemela, a sophomore, said she
likes the preventive approach the
unit takes to health care. "I'd like
to see increased primary care
treatment so that cuts in expendi
tures can he made later down the
line," she said.
Currently, clinic organizers are
focusing on advertising in hospi
tals, newspapers and other clinics.
Since space is limited, the clinic
expects a clientele of about 15 to
20 women per night.
Acharya said it is exciting to see
the number of professional;
health-care providers who are
willing to work without monetary
compensation. She added that the
amount of student support has
also been encouraging. "We all
work together and we all have
multiple roles," she said. "Still,
there's a million things that come
up when you're opening a clinic
that you wouldn't think of until
you actually do it."
