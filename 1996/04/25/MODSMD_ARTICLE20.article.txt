Deans' focus should be education, not 'competition 9

Q DEANS." "Three Blind
Mice." Dean of Engineering
JL James Gibbons offered this
comparison in jest at last Thursday's
panel. Ironically, this quip may be a lit
tle more accurate than he intended.
At this panel, three of Stanford's
academic deans (from the schools of
Medicine, Engineering and Humani
ties and Sciences) discussed the pre
sent state and future direction of the
University. They delved into topics
ranging from interdepartmental disci
plines to "appropriate" corporate
funded research. Surprisingly, howev
er, for a panel of university deans,
very little attention was given to edu
cation. Instead, the focus was turned
to competition and how Stanford could
remain competitive in today's educa
tional market. To emphasize this
point, Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven himself described
his gradual revelation that the Univer
sity was not immune to competition.

Some might say that competition is
a good thing; it keeps you on your
toes. Regrettably, in the case of this
university, it is also causing the severe
neglect of the primary function of its
staff: to educate the students. The
competition that Stanford is faced
with isn't concerned with improving
the quality of education for its stu
dents. It is, instead, more interested in
earning grants and gifts for research,
not only from the government, but
from private corporations as well. It is
this influence that has caused us to
lose sight of our ultimate goals.
I do not blame the deans for this
myopia. This situation has risen out of
the simple laws of economics. The mar
ket demands discovery and innovation.
Although we can provide that, we must
differentiate ourselves by improving
our capacity to do research. This, how
ever, comes at a cost; a cost paid by
huge grants and donations from corpo
rations and government programs.

We as students also provide a mar
ket demand; however, our purchasing
power is limited by the annual income
of our hard-working parents, or in
some cases our own hard work. Also,
because the demand for a Stanford
education is extremely high, there is
no pressure for the University to con
sider student concerns with great
regard. In essence, individual student
voices do not have the financial clout
of individual corporate influences. It is
these factors in combination that are
causing the degradation and devalua
tion of our education.
Although we cannot provide the
same quantity of funding that these
grants can, if the University continues
on its current track, education will fall
to a level that will negate any benefit
improved research technique and facili
ties can offer.
The good news, however, is that
this is not a zero-sum game we are
playing. Students, as we all know, pro

vide a wealth of resources. Their input
in creating future reform and improve
ment is imperative to the development
of quality education. The sooner we
can reverse the trend of student (as
well as faculty) disenfranchisement
the better our Stanford community
will be able to cope with the threats of
competition. An integrated university
will create an environment far more
conducive to efficient progress than
the current coagulum of marginalized
factions. We cannot hope to sustain
growth with such lopsided develop
ment. We must, therefore, unite our
individual goals to propel our school
toward a viable future. Thus, I ask the
deans of this school, as responsible
administrators, to turn their focus
again toward education, and call to
arms the students of this campus, as
citizens of this university, to demand
that their voice be heard.
