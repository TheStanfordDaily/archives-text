# Columnists should base work in fact, not fiction
## 
### 
Allison Amend admits that much of
what she has told us isn't true. She
defends herself by arguing that "we
all misrepresent ourselves a little
every day." That may be true in some
abstract sense, but the columnists I
respect use fact and opinion without
resorting to undisclosed fiction.
I do feel I've been duped â€” and her
excuses are lame. Would she rational
ize this the same way if she had pre
tended to be a doctor or a rabbi or a
person of another sex on the Internet?
As part of our education each of us
is redefining who we are: it's part of
acquiring new knowledge and a new
degree. And it's normal to try on new

attitudes and ways of relating to oth
ers; that is part of exploring and
defining our sexual and family identi
fies. But Amend is ignoring the differ
ence between private exploration and
public deception.
Truth has enduring value for our
daily lives. This point has been made
many times; I learned it best from F.
Scott Peck's "The Road Less Trav
eled."
