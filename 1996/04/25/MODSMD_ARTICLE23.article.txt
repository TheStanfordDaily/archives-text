# AASA's fliers depict inappropriate images of Asian identity
## 
### 
The last few AASA fliers have
shown us images of tall, white, anorex
ic models. Think hack to the turn
about dance and to the upcoming fash
ion show. When was the last time an
AASA flier showed someone Asian?

I don't think I'm engaging in
reverse discrimination by bringing this
up. I've always hoped that the point of
AASA is to help Asians understand and
enjoy what it means to be part of an
ethnic minority within a mainstream
majority. So when I see hopelessly
mainstream images on our fliers, I
wonder what the point really is.
Would MEChA or the Black Student
Union advertise their functions with
photos of Asians? Probably not. It just
wouldn't make sense. So why can't we
start making sense, too? Right now our
fliers tell us and the rest of Stanford
that all Asian identity amounts to is
wanting to be white. I hope that's not
what we want.
Let's change what we're doing so
that it reflects what we really want.
