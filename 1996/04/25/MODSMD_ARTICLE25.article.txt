## Lacking style: Why Stanford students have no class 
### 
"We don't have to be violent or ugly or
arrogant — just be charming, and what
a pleasant world that would be."
— Morrissey
AS LONG AS I have been blessed
enough to be known to the world
as a student at Stanford, I have
been burdened with a distinct awareness
of what a truly awful place this universi
ty is.
If the question, then, is, "What's so
bad about Stanford?" it would be easy
for me to answer, "The students." Hut
since I demand more from myself, the
dilemma becomes, "What's so bad about
the students?"
For over half a year now, I have hap
hazardly directed my rants at what I
thought might be the sources of the
problem. I have often erred. I must say
that although the Sigma Chis, the Pi
Phis, the Texas Club, freshmen and Res
idential Education are all integral parts
of the malady, none of them can bear the
entire blame for what I can only term a
general lack of style.
Most Stanford students are sure

they've got class. "I can't go out
tonight," they say. "I've got class." Or,
"I have no time to develop a personality.
I've got class." Ironically, I must point
out here that this is exactly the problem
— you have 18 units, but no class.
When I talk about class or style or
charm, by the way, I'm not referring to
blowing a couple hundred at Urban Out
fitters. It doesn't happen just by wear
ing black and asking that weird guy at
the party to teach you how to smoke a
cigarette.
Style is extremely elusive. It consists
of about equal parts conviction and sin
cerity, which is clearly why it eludes
most Stanford people. I can't explain
style to you in the same way that I can't
give you a soul, but I can certainly
approach it by the process of elimina
tion, i.e., by enumerating the most bla
tantly urc-stylish practices of Stanford
students.
The obvious starting point would be
the typical Stanford uniform. It is the
first indication that people here are
floating along on a tepid, gray current of
mass-consciousness, wallowing in a

comfortable sense that they need not
deviate from generally low standards of
style in any attempt to appear self
aware.
First of all, the Tevas have to go.
These ugly, rubberized excuses for
footwear were invented for river-raft
ing, not going out to dinner. Have you
ever seen a river guide? If you want to
take white water chic all the way, lose
the shirt, put some yellow zinc oxide on
your nose and start using words like
"wicked."
And then there are the shorts — oh,
the eternal shorts. Listen, I know you
came here because the kids in Approach
ing Stanford looked so sunny and warm,
but don't try to bend the elements to
your will by sporting your favorite
Bermuda jams when it's 40 degrees and
raining. Jeans shorts, on the other
hand, are inexcusable in any conditions.
I suppose I should also mention
Bookstore clothing. McDonald's employ
ees are forced to walk around with the
brand name pasted all over their outfit,
but we need not follow suit.
As I said, style cannot be achieved by

the addition of a single, supposedly
"cool" accessory. Don't walk into class
with your sunglasses still on. I know you
think it would be a shame if everyone
inside didn't get to see your suave
shades, but I'm on to you.
Tackiness at Stanford is much deeper
than apparel, however; it manifests
itself even in the way students travel.
Rollerblading, for instance, is perhaps
the most intrinsically lame form of
transportation ever invented. Just walk.
Please.
Bicycles are tolerable, as long as you
don't make the mistake of wearing a
bike helmet. I know you've been known
to get the thing up to 20 miles an hour,
but live a little dangerously.
Even the way Stanford students talk
to each other saps the English language
of all its charm: "I was all psyched to be
at this sweet party, and then this ran
dom guy shows up. It was sketchy."
Worse yet, in terms of utterly grace
less forms of communication, is e-mail.
This is writing with no punctuation, no
content and no style: "whats up. thanks
for your mail, wel i gotta go. see ya :)"

Listen, I don't aire how many different
kinds of sideways happy-faees you can
make, they are only going to make me
very, very sad.
Perhaps the ultimate indication of
Stanford students' style failings can be
found in their musical taste. Rock music
can be divided into two categories: clas
sic rock (no class) and punk rock. In this
case, Stanford is a classic rock school.
Classic rock can be loosely defined as
music I don't like. Red Hot Chili Pep
pers? Green Day? Both classic rock.
Pizzicato Five? Punk rock.
By the way, Billy Joel is normally
classic rock. But you certainly have a
certain style — that is, conviction and
sincerity — if you own every single one
of his albums and have seen him live
several times.
Finally, since style is a very personal
issue, please don't take all of this per
sonally. Take it very personally.
Josh Gohlke has no style.
