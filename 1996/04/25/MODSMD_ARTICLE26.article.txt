## Stanford gymnasts will strut their stuff at NCAAs Women head to Alabama for their second NCAA championship appearance 
### Keith Rabkin Contributing writer 
For only the second time in Stanford's history, the
women's gymnastics team has qualified for the NCAA
championships.
After going through a disappointing season in
which the Cardinal went 2-8 overall and 0-6 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, the women managed to put up
the llth-best score in the country at NCAA regionals
two weeks ago, securing for themselves an invitation
to compete for the NCAA title beginning today in
Tuscaloosa, Ala.
The last time Stanford made it to NCAAs was in
1992, when the team placed 10th in competition. This
year the Cardinal hopes to do better. "We are going in
ranked 11th," said sophomore Keri Monahan, "but
anything can happen. We hope to step up our routines
and make it into the Super Six for further competi
tion." The Super Six is comprised of the six teams
which advance to the competitions second day.
The Cardinal will go up against top-seeded Ceorgia,
Michigan, Penn State and conference rivals Arizona,
UCLA and Oregon State. Stanford is 0-4 against those
teams this year, having suffered losses to Ceorgia, Ari
zona, UCLA and Oregon State, though the Cardinal
almost managed to upset the Pac-10 champion
Beavers.
The Stanford women have practiced hard this week
in order to minimize errors going into the match.
Head coach Lisa Izzi has designed the women's train
ing program so that the athletes peak at the end of the
year.
"Coach Izzi has us ready to peak now," Monahan
said. "We are right on schedule."
Given the caliber of the competition, the Cardinal
will have to be at its best to climb into the Super Six.
But nobody on the team doubts that they can make
that elite group.
"We have a chance to make the Super Six for the
first time in history," said sophomore Christie Jones.
"We will have to hit all our routines and make no mis
takes like 3 did in our record setting meets."
The Cardinal delivered outstanding scores toward
the end of the year, shattering individual records and
team all-around scores.
"If we can keep our minds clear while still main
taining our excitement, we can break even our new
records," said Monahan, the all-around record holder.
"But our goal is not to break records — we plan to ad
vance to the Super Six. It. wiU take all the mental
toughness we can muster. We'll have to block 1 out all
distractions and keep focused instead of being psyched
out by the other teams' fans."

"We're so excited," Jones added. "We have been
training so hard, perfecting all the minor mistakes
that we made at regianals and mentally preparing by
picturing our routines in our heads."
The Cardinal will be relyingon a total team effort to
carry it past the preliminary round, as the nature of

the competition will make it impossible for record
holders Monahan and freshman Amy Murakami to
carry the team.
"We need a strong effort from every member of the
squad if we want to improve over our performance at
regionals," Monahan said.
