The Stanford men's gymnastics team has
reached its last atop on the road to victory —
the NCAA championships. The trip has been
long and hard, but the defending national
champion has emerged stronger and better
prepared for the event than they have been
all year.
The tournament begins tonight in Maples
Pavilion and continues through Saturday.
The competitors will be Stanford, California,
Ohio State, lowa, Oklahoma and Penn State.
Additionally, a group of individual gymnasts
whose teams failed to qualify for the event
will compete in the individual all-around.
Stanford (11-3) saw its chances to repeat
as NCAA champions fade earlier this year
when sophomore Tim Dairymple injured his
neck before the second meet of the season.
One of the team's strongest gymnasts, Dal
rymple racked up the top score in the San
Jose Open, his only competition of the sea
son.
Ever since that setback, the Cardinal has
been set on rebuilding the team and regain
ing its chances for a title. And while the re
building process was often a bit bumpy, the
Stanford gymnasts have managed within the
last few weeks to bring it all together and
emerge as contenders. Two weeks ago, the
Cardinal posted its highest score of the year,
230.3 points, and expects to build on that this
weekend.
Tonight's competition will narrow the
field, as only three teams will advance to the
next round of competition. Individuals will
compete for the all-around title.
Friday night, the three finalists will battle
for the team title. The weekend will conclude
with the individual events competition on
Saturday night.
Cal (i6-l) and Ohio State (13-0) will pose
the biggest threats to the Cardinal. The Gold
en Bears scored higher than Stanford in each
of their head-to-head competitions this year.
Ohio State has also posted some big scores,
although scores from the East have histori
cal iy proved lower in NCAA competition.
"The East typftll/fcwnfcs m wiih 'high^r
scores that are like two points
higher than what they score in
competition," said junior co-cap
tain Keith Wiley. "I don't know
what the reason is for that —
maybe judging."
Wiley won the all-around com
petition at the NCAA West Re
gionals and will provide a boost to
the team's score if he remains con
sistent. The Cardinal's other co
captain, Peter Hegi, has been
mentioned for the Nissen award
— collegiate gymnastics' version
of the Heisman Trophy.
Other notable gymnasts in the
competition include Ohio State ju
nior Blaine Wilson (who, like
Wiley and Stanford junior Josh
Stein, is an Olympic hopeful), Cal
sophomore Josh Birkelbaw and
Cal junior David Krusel. All have
been strong performers this year.
"I just want to hit all six rou
tines Thursday and Friday night,
and hopefully they will be my sea
son-high scores and that will help
the team," Wiley said. "I'm not
looking to win the all-around or
anything like that — that is not
my goal, just as long as I hit all my
routines and help the team."

The team has been training
hard for these competitions, doing
double duty each day. Head coach
Sadao Hamada said early on that
his primary goal was to win the
NCAA tournament, and that the
bumps along the road would only
prepare his men for this competi
tion.
They have been working to
peak at the NCAAs, and tonight
and tomorrow night should be the

culmination of that work. But the
Cardinal will have to pull all its
skills together and focus on per
forming at its best.
"We're really excited that the
NCAAs are here at Stanford for
the first time ever," Wiley said.
"We've been training hard to win,
which is what we plan on doing
Friday night. We've trained all
year with this goal in mind, and we
plan on making it come through."
