The Stanford men's gymnastics team has
reached its last atop on the road to victory â€”
the NCAA championships. The trip has been
long and hard, but the defending national
champion has emerged stronger and better
prepared for the event than they have been
all year.
The tournament begins tonight in Maples
Pavilion and continues through Saturday.
The competitors will be Stanford, California,
Ohio State, lowa, Oklahoma and Penn State.
Additionally, a group of individual gymnasts
whose teams failed to qualify for the event
will compete in the individual all-around.
Stanford (11-3) saw its chances to repeat
as NCAA champions fade earlier this year
when sophomore Tim Dairymple injured his
neck before the second meet of the season.
One of the team's strongest gymnasts, Dal
rymple racked up the top score in the San
Jose Open, his only competition of the sea
son.
Ever since that setback, the Cardinal has
been set on rebuilding the team and regain
ing its chances for a title. And while the re
building process was often a bit bumpy, the
Stanford gymnasts have managed within the
last few weeks to bring it all together and
emerge as contenders. Two weeks ago, the
Cardinal posted its highest score of the year,
230.3 points, and expects to build on that this
weekend.
Tonight's competition will narrow the
field, as only three teams will advance to the
next round of competition. Individuals will
compete for the all-around title.
Friday night, the three finalists will battle
for the team title. The weekend will conclude
with the individual events competition on
Saturday night.
Cal (i6-l) and Ohio State (13-0) will pose
the biggest threats to the Cardinal. The Gold
en Bears scored higher than Stanford in each
of their head-to-head competitions this year.
Ohio State has also posted some big scores,
although scores from the East have histori
cal iy proved lower in NCAA competition.
