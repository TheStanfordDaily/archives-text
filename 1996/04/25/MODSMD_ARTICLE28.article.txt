# Comeback attempt falls short for women's golf
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
The University of Arizona women's golf
team did a pretty decent job of emulating
Greg Norman at this week's Pacific 10
Conference Championships, but Stanford
failed in its attempt to impersonate Nick
Faldo.
Going into the third and final round of
play yesterday at the 6,002-yard, par-72
Raven Golf Club in Tucson, Ariz., the Wild
cats held a somewhat-comfortable 11-
stroke lead over second-place Stanford.
But in a collapse almost as tragic as the
Great White Shark's at the 1996 Masters,
Arizona withered in the 92-degree heat,
finishing in a tie for third with Stanford,
four strokes off the pace set by champion
Arizona State and three strokes behind
runner-up UCLA.

The Sun Devils made up a 14-stroke
deficit to snatch victory from the jaws of
the No. 5-ranked Wildcats, and establish
themselves as the reigning Faldo-like
comeback kids of collegiate women's golf.
But it was Stanford who was better-po
sitioned to play Faldo to Arizona's Nor
man. Despite erasing Arizona's 11-stroke
lead, however, the Cardinal could not keep
pace with the red-hot Sun Devils and Bru
ins.
After one day of play, Stanford was in
third place with a 297, 10 strokes behind
leader Arizona and four behind Arizona
State.
Stanford was led by junior Ail-American
Mhairi McKay, who shot a 70-72-75â€”217
to finish in sixth place, three strokes off the
winning pace set by Arizona's Maria Baena.
