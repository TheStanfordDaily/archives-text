# Men's hoops could see its best season ever in '96-97
## But let's not forget the Hank Luisetti years 
### 
The college basketball season may have
ended three weeks ago, but a feeling fa
miliar to the past three summers twin
kles in the backs of the minds of Stanford
fans.
For the third time in three years, Mike
Montgomery and his staff have brought to
gether a group of incoming players that
comes with the spotlight already on it. For
the third time in three years, Stanford ex
pects to be better than it was the year before.
For the third time in three years, people
aren't crazy to suggest that this might be the
best season in Stanford history.
And if your memory only stretches back to
the 1992-93 season when the Cardinal stum
bled and bumbled to a 7-23 record, then these
past three years have provided plenty of hope
for the future.
Who wouldn't drool over a front line of
Tim Young, Mark Seaton, Peter Sauer, Rich
Jackson, Peter Van Elswyk, Andy McClel
land, Mark Madsen and Ryan Mendez? The
smallest of those eight, the 6-6 Jackson, is a
weightlifting fanatic who, if he recovers from
a knee injury, will make up for any lost floor
burns due to the graduation of Andy Poppink
and David Harbour.
In a conference which fell in love with the
three-guard rotation last year, Stanford
should dominate under the boards and have
the toughest interior defense in the league.

Even if McClelland and Jackson don't recov
er from knee injuries, there's still a starter
and a potent backup at each position.
As for the guards, Arthur Lee and Kris
Weems both had strong seasons apprenticing
under Brevin Knight and Dion Cross, and in
coming freshman David Moseley moves back
to the backcourt full-time with the signing of
Mendez.

With those 11 players, you have a team
that would make the NCAA tournament nine
out of 10 years. When you add Knight, you get
something very special. Let him run and he's
got Sauer, Weems and Seaton on the wings,
running and dunking on the hreak. Let him
set up half court, and his quickness nets him
trips to the free-throw line or easy dishes to
