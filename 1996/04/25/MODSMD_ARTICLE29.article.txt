# Men's hoops could see its best season ever in '96-97
## But let's not forget the Hank Luisetti years 
### 
The college basketball season may have
ended three weeks ago, but a feeling fa
miliar to the past three summers twin
kles in the backs of the minds of Stanford
fans.
For the third time in three years, Mike
Montgomery and his staff have brought to
gether a group of incoming players that
comes with the spotlight already on it. For
the third time in three years, Stanford ex
pects to be better than it was the year before.
For the third time in three years, people
aren't crazy to suggest that this might be the
best season in Stanford history.
And if your memory only stretches back to
the 1992-93 season when the Cardinal stum
bled and bumbled to a 7-23 record, then these
past three years have provided plenty of hope
for the future.
Who wouldn't drool over a front line of
Tim Young, Mark Seaton, Peter Sauer, Rich
Jackson, Peter Van Elswyk, Andy McClel
land, Mark Madsen and Ryan Mendez? The
smallest of those eight, the 6-6 Jackson, is a
weightlifting fanatic who, if he recovers from
a knee injury, will make up for any lost floor
burns due to the graduation of Andy Poppink
and David Harbour.
In a conference which fell in love with the
three-guard rotation last year, Stanford
should dominate under the boards and have
the toughest interior defense in the league.

Even if McClelland and Jackson don't recov
er from knee injuries, there's still a starter
and a potent backup at each position.
As for the guards, Arthur Lee and Kris
Weems both had strong seasons apprenticing
under Brevin Knight and Dion Cross, and in
coming freshman David Moseley moves back
to the backcourt full-time with the signing of
Mendez.

With those 11 players, you have a team
that would make the NCAA tournament nine
out of 10 years. When you add Knight, you get
something very special. Let him run and he's
got Sauer, Weems and Seaton on the wings,
running and dunking on the hreak. Let him
set up half court, and his quickness nets him
trips to the free-throw line or easy dishes to


Greg
Collins
Young and Co. down low.
So it's obvious then. This is
going to be the best Stanford team
ever. No longer will Stanford be
looked at as a bunch of guys who
play well as a team but aren't su
perior individual talents.
These guys can all play —
Mendez caught the eye of a lot of
big time programs with his 38-
point and 18-rebound averages;
Sauer was recruited by Villanova,
Seaton by UCLA, just to name a
few. No previous Cardinal squad
compares to this collection of tal
ent. Knight may show up on sever
al preseason All-America lists,
garnering more national attention
than former Stanford greats Todd
Lichti and Adam Keefe.
With all that, it's hard not to
say this team will make the biggest
national impact of any Stanford
team.
But you are forgetting one
thing. It's a sight you have seen
every time you set foot into Maples
Pavilion.
You are forgetting Angelo
"Hank" Luisetti.
A three-time AIl-American,
Luisetti was a man among boys
during his four-year Stanford ca
reer that began 60 years ago.
There are not very many athletes
who can say they forever revolu
tionized their game. Luisetti did,
and not just with his one-handed
shot that permanently holds court
over the Maples floor.
In an age when teams were
lucky to score 40 points in a game,
Luisetti averaged 16.1 a contest.
That's like a player today averag
ing over 30 per game. When
Luisetti hit for 50 in a 92-27 drub
bing of Duquesne in 1938, he es
tablished a Stanford scoring
record that no one has come close
to breaking.
But it wasn't only his scoring
that put him ahead of the rest. He
could execute the cross-over drib
ble but didn't need to because he
was already quicker than every

one else. He dribbled and passed
behind his back 20 years before
Bob Cousy. He played passing
lanes in Stanford's combination
man-to-man zone defense like
Larry Bird.
But still that wasn't enough.
Not until New Year's Eve 1937,
when Luisetti and Stanford trav
eled to Madison Square Garden to
play Long Island University, win
ners of 43 straight games. The
Blackbirds were the reigning
kings of East Coast basketball, a
decidedly less exciting version
than the brand Luisetti and Stan
ford played.
Stanford won handily, 49-35.
Luisetti scored 15 and was later
named the outstanding athlete to
perform in the Garden that year.
That game introduced a nation
to the modern form of basketball
that would begin to grow following
World War 11. Luisetti's style was
the forerunner to the fast break
and Stanford's defensive scheme
was the beginning of the replace
ment of man-to-man defenses
combinations and straight zones.
It wasn't just Luisetti. The en
tire Stanford team played like
him, shooting in a style that he
adopted because he wasn't strong
enough as a kid to get the ball to
the basket with a conventional
two-handed set shot. Back then,
he put the ball up like a shot put.
But Luisetti always performed
in unorthodox ways — that's
what made him so distinct. It
wasn't just that he was the best at
what everyone was doing at the
time. He was the best player and
did things that no one else could
do.
Ask anyone who saw Luisetti
play, and they will tell you he did
things then that would still seem
cutting-edge today. They will also
tell you, no matter how much you
protest about seeing a better play
er, that nobody played like Hank.
So before you go proclaiming
that next year's team is the great
est ever, or that no single Stanford
player has as much effect on the
team as Knight, pay the respect to
a man and an age that is seldom re
membered by today's fans.
