## Eyeing June, students meet to mull over hotel boycott 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
Students from a range of campus groups
met last night to discuss plans for the contin
uation of a year-old local boycott of the Stan
ford Park Hotel, aiming to put a dent into the
hotel's expected revenues during one of its
busiest times — graduation.
For over a year, students, community
members and activists have been protesting
the treatment of immigrant workers at the
hotel and the chain it belongs to, the non
union Western Lodging Group.
"I think it's really important that people
on this campus recognize how we, our fami
lies and surrounding communities are con

tributing to the kind of situations occurring
in the Stanford Park Hotel, and that we take
action to oppose it," said freshman Deborah
Orosz, who is active in Resistance Action or-
Ganizing Education.
At the meeting, students discussed their
two main focus areas for the rest of the quar
ter: preventing parents and others from stay
ing at the hotel during graduation and tar
geting departments which use the hotel for
lunch meetings, conferences and booking
out-of-town guests.
Among the possible plans of action are
having those graduating seniors who are in
volved in the boycott wear stickers, pins, ban-
ners and other things on gradua
tion day to show their concern.
The students also discussed
ways to publicize and promote the
boycott on campus, which may in
clude sending letters to depart
ments, posting fliers, speaking at
dorms and contacting the gradua
tion keynote speaker.
According to Elaine Peterson, a
representative of the Hotel and
Restaurant Workers Union, Stan
ford Park is the "flagship hotel of
the chain" and also the biggest
moneymaker.
Workers at the six Western

Lodging Group hotels — particu
larly Latinos — feel that they are
being treated unfairly by the man
agement because of the color of
their skin, Peterson said. But
when they began organizing a
union in February of last year,
hotel management acted swiftly to
end the effort.
Several workers were fired that
month, and the management em
ployed various tactics to intimi
date workers who supported the
union, Peterson said. "Supporting
the Stanford Park Hotel boycott is
acting in solidarity with workers
from Lafayette to Monterey," she
said.
Peterson said the group would
continue the boycott "until the
company agrees to stop breaking

the law and actually does stop
breaking the law."
Freshman Crystal Zermeno
who is involved in MEChA, attend
ed last night's meeting. "I don't
think we're doing enough as Stan
ford students as far as seeing what
our university has invested in ant
standing up for the rights of people
in our community," she said.
Sophomore Abigail Kramer, i
member of Stvidents for Environ
mental Action at Stanford/ said i
is important that the Stanforc
community in particular suppon
this cause.
"Stanford is an institution tha
has a lot of power, and it's impor
tant (hat we as students and facul
ty are aware of that and use tha
power responsibly," Kramer said.
