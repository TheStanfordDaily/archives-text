# Men's tennis tunes up for NCAAs
## Cardinal will head south for Pac-10 championships 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
The second-ranked Stanford men's tennis
team concluded its regular season on a down
note last weekend, losing to No. 7 USC and No.
1 UCLA in Los Angeles. With a 7-3 record in Pa
cific 10 Conference play (19-4 overall), the Car
dinal finished second in the conference behind
the undefeated Bruins.
But while the Cardinal would have liked to
have come out on top of the Pac-10, the team re
alizes that it is the postseason that really mat
ters. Stanford performed well enough in 1996 to
guarantee itself a slot in the NCAA tournament,
where the men will be probably be seeded some
where between second and fourth. Winning that
tournament has been the team's goal since the
beginning of the season.
But before they get on the plane and head to
Athens, Ga., for next month's NCAA champi
onships, the Cardinal netters will have to make
a stop in Ojai, Calif. That's where Pac-10 indi
vidual championships take place this weekend,
and Stanford's top eight singles players will be
in action, as will the top four doubles teams.
Stanford has enjoyed enormous success in
tournaments so far this season, and hopes to
continue its excellent run in Ojai. Competing in
the top flight of the singles are No. 5-ranked se
nior Jeff Salzenstein, No. 9 freshman Ryan
