# Men's tennis tunes up for NCAAs
## Cardinal will head south for Pac-10 championships 
### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
The second-ranked Stanford men's tennis
team concluded its regular season on a down
note last weekend, losing to No. 7 USC and No.
1 UCLA in Los Angeles. With a 7-3 record in Pa
cific 10 Conference play (19-4 overall), the Car
dinal finished second in the conference behind
the undefeated Bruins.
But while the Cardinal would have liked to
have come out on top of the Pac-10, the team re
alizes that it is the postseason that really mat
ters. Stanford performed well enough in 1996 to
guarantee itself a slot in the NCAA tournament,
where the men will be probably be seeded some
where between second and fourth. Winning that
tournament has been the team's goal since the
beginning of the season.
But before they get on the plane and head to
Athens, Ga., for next month's NCAA champi
onships, the Cardinal netters will have to make
a stop in Ojai, Calif. That's where Pac-10 indi
vidual championships take place this weekend,
and Stanford's top eight singles players will be
in action, as will the top four doubles teams.
Stanford has enjoyed enormous success in
tournaments so far this season, and hopes to
continue its excellent run in Ojai. Competing in
the top flight of the singles are No. 5-ranked se
nior Jeff Salzenstein, No. 9 freshman Ryan

Senior captain Jeff Salzenstein and his Cardinal teammates travel to
Ojai, Calif., this weekend for the Pac-10 championships.
Wolters, No. 24 sophomore Paul
Goldstein and No. 51 senior Jim
Thomas.
Each Pac-10 team sends its
top) four players to battle for the
first flight title. The exception
this year is UCLA, which has
chosen to withhold its top two
players from the competition.
Sophomore Justin Gimelstob
and senior Srdjan Muskatirovic,
ranked No. 3 and No. 19, respec
tively, will not be participating.
Most say that Bruins coach
Billy Martin is keeping his stars
out so they can get some needed
rest before the NCAAs. Some
more skeptical critics have sug
gested that the players are avoid
ing possible damage to their
rankings. A third theory hints
that Muskatirovic will be visiting
Vanna White in hopes of pur
chasing a vowel for his first
name.

Whatever the case may be, the
field is slightly weakened by their
absence. Gimelstob would have
been one of the favorites to win
the event. But even without the
Bruins' top dogs, the field is still
impressive. Pac-10 tennis has
dominated the national spec
trum for as long as collegiate ten
nis has been played, and many of
the country's best amateur play
ers will be competing.
At the head of the field are
Salzenstein and USC's Cecil
Mamiit. Mamiit — a freshman
who has worked his way up to the
second position in the national
rankings — and Salzenstein will
probably be seeded No. 1 and No.
2, but it is uncertain who will re
ceive which seed. If the tourna
ment seedings hold form, and the
Trojan star meets Stanford's
captain in the final, it will be the
fourth time that the stars have
met this year.
In their first match-up,
Salzenstein severely outplayed
Mamiit in the finals of the Rolex
National Indoor Championships,

6-4, 6-2 to take one leg of the col
legiate Grand Slam. In their
other two encounters, Salzen
stein lost a hearthreaker at
home, 7-6, 7-6, and then avenged
the defeat in Los Angeles, 4-6, 6-
4, 7-6.
Wolters, who will probably re
ceive the third seed, will also
have a good shot at the Ojai
crown. The 19-year-old earned
the title of "freshman phenom"
after capturing championships
in his first two collegiate tourna
ments (the ITA All-American
Championship and the Milwau
kee Classic), charging all the way
to the top of the collegiate polls in
the process.
Wolters' play and his ranking
have dropped slightly over the
past few months in conjunction
with a stress fracture discovered
in his left foot. He was forced to
take three weeks off, and is only
now coming back into top form.
Wolters, who is a streaky player,
is prone to the early upset if he
goes cold. But if he can heat up,
he is more than capable of win

ning any college tournament.
In the doubles portion of the
event, Goldstein and Thomas
will be favored to win it all. The
Cardinal duo is ranked No. 2 na
tionally behind Gimelstob and
Muskatirovic, who won't be play
ing doubles, either. Thomas and
Goldstein have hit a skid of late,
losing two of their last three, but
have proven throughout the year
their ability to win big matches.
They advanced to the semifinals
of the National Indoor Champi
onships and won the Pacific
Coast doubles tourney.
Salzenstein and Wolters,
ranked 16th, will also have a le
gitimate shot at the title. They
could receive a seed as high as
No. 2.
Obviously, Stanford players
would like to win this weekend's
tournament, but right now the
team has Ojai in perspective.
Winning the NCAAs in May is
the team's ultimate goal, and the
Pac-10 individual champi
onships are little more than a
tune-up.
