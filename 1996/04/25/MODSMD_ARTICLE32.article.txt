# Debate team captures Best School Award at tournament
## 
### Paul Bodnar Staff writer 
Shattering all preconceived notions of East Coast
superiority in the art of public speaking, Stanford's
parliamentary debate team continued its record
breaking season last weekend by winning the Best
School Award at the Yale National Debate tourna
ment.
The Stanford A-team of senior Matthew Meskell
and junior Brendan Maher also clinched the Ameri
can Parliamentary Debate Association's prestigious
Team of the Year Award.
Although Stanford did not win the team competi
tion at Yale, three teams placed in the top 10 and
Meskell captured the first-place speaker award.
After defeating the Stanford B-team of seniors
Patrick Shields and Matthew Rabinowitz in the
quarterfinals, the A-team lost to the top team from
the University of Pennsylvania in the semifinals.
However, they gained enough points to win the sea
son-long team competition.
Shields and Rabinowitz, meanwhile, finished
third in the Team of the Year standings. With two
unusually strong teams, Stanford became the domi
nant force on the national debate scene even though

it was not able to attend as many of the tournaments
on the East Coast-centered circuit as its Ivy League
rivals.
The two lead Stanford teams won a total of four
tournaments this year, including Harvard, Prince
ton, Fordham and Fairfield Universities, in addition
to second-place finishes at Vassar College, Amherst
College and the University of Chicago.
"It's the first time a non-East Coast school has
won Team of the Year," Maher said. "[Other
schools] learned that Stanford is a force to be reck
oned with."
Rabinowitz added that the debate team's success
came only after a laborious reorganization. "Meskell
and I went through a lot of effort to restructure the
team," he said. "We found that the talent was avail
able and there was a tremendous amount of un
tapped skill. We focused on actualizing that poten
tial."
This weekend, Stanford will send three teams to
the national championships at Swarthmore College
in Pennsylvania. Maher said he hopes to carry the
momentum gained at Yale into the tournament:
"We're very excited about winning Team of the Year,
and it should give us an excellent chance to do well at
nationals."
