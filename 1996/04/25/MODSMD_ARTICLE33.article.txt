# Music tour something
## Rolling Stone concert arrives today; didn't you hear?

A nationally-publicized traveling concert ar
rives at Stanford today, and it appears students
are the last to know.
Rolling Stone's third annual New Music Tour
makes a stop in White Plaza from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
and will conclude with a free concert at Cubberley
Community Center in Palo Alto. The concert will
feature Deep Blue Something, the proud parents
of hit single "Breakfast at Tiffany's," and Marry
Me Jane, a band featured on the "If Lucy Fell"
soundtrack.
The event is organized by the Stanford Concert
Network and Earthwise Productions. Nationally
co-sponsored by Sony, DavidofT Cold Water, Air
walk, Ray-Ban and Volkswagen, the daytime por
tion of the event in White Plaza will have a festival
type format complete with booths, displays, con
tests and games.
Also involved in the tour is LlFEbeat, a music
industry organization fighting AIDS.
The participating sponsors will exhibit their
products through samples and coupons, and
students will have the chance to win lots of
goodies, including music paraphernalia and T
shirts.

Among the treats to sample will be the latest
music releases at the interactive Sony Mini Disc lis
tening station, new video game technology at the
Sony Play Station tent and a rock and roll trivia
game.
Tickets for the evening concert in Palo Alto
can be obtained at the Rolling Stone tent in
White Plaza during the daytime event. Admis
sion to both the concert and the daytime festivi
ties are free and open to all students with a valid
Stanford ID.
"Since the Cubberley Community Center is a
relatively small venue that has about a 300-person
seating capacity, this concert will be a great show
for those who know about it and can get off cam
pus," said Mark Weiss, director of Earthwise Pro
ductions.
Stanford is one of many stops for the tour,
which hits college campuses nationwide. The pur
pose of this tour is to "get students to see Rolling
Stone around . . . and to do something outdoors in
the spirit of spring," said Rolling Stone publicist
Katie Schroeder. She added that "there has been
an awesome response from the other campuses
we've been to." The tour is headed to UC-Berkeley
next week.
The Cubberley Community Center is located at
4000 Middlefield Road in Palo Alto.
