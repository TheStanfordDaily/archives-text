# Mexican Renaissance, Uprooted
## 
### Kristie Lü Stout 
Through Sept. 8, visitors to the San Fran
cisco Museum of Modern Art will de
vour the eye candy on display on the
fourth floor: a sampling of 20th-century Mexi
can art in "Frida Kahlo, 1 )iego Rivera and Mex
ican Modernism from the jacquesand Natasha
Gelman Collection" and "Diego Rivera: Mural
Studies for San Francisco and Mexico City."
The first collection — showcasing the
painters of the so-called Mexican Renaissance
including Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, lose
(.lementeOro/coand RufinoTamayo— is the
result of Jacques and Natasha Gelman's half
century of avid art collecting.
lacques Gelman (1909-1986) was horn in
St. Petersburg. Between the two world wars,
the budding movie mogul emigrated to Berlin
and later to Paris where he founded a film dis
tribution company. After opening a branch of
his film distribution company in Mexico,
lacques settled there with his wife, (vech emi
grant (and blonde bombshell) Natasha Zahal
ka. There, Gelman made his fortune in the
production of populist flicks starring the fa
mous comic, Mario Moreno Contiflas. His
success enabled him and his wife to amass an
impressive collection of Mexican Modernist
work.
Spanning the years 1915 to 1989, the Gel

man collection loosely traces the evolution of
modern Mexican art. It includes I )iego Rivera's
1915 "Ultima Hora," a Braque-inspired early
cubist work that would lend to the solid forms
of the Huropean-trained artist's later paintings
and mural works. The collection also includes
three aggressively approached, mask-like por
traits by David Alfaro Siquiero, and several
sharply expressionistic paintings on paper by
Jose Clemente Orozco.
The Gelman collection also holds a gener
ous array of Frida Kahlo's paintings. According
to museum director Jack Lane, "The collection
is the largest in private hands of Frida Kahlo."
The collection's 10 Kahlo works include six ol
the artist's idiosyncratic and well-recognized
self-portraits, and a relatively unreproduced
still-life of hyper-sensualized fruit titled "The
Bride Who Became Frightened When She Saw
l ife Opened," an oil work that provides a re
freshing reassessment of Kahlo's artcraft and
visual wit. The Gelman collection also bran
dishes a Kahlo portrait of her husband — artist
1 )icgo Rivera — and a rather austere portrait of
her female benefactor, Natasha Gelman.
Portraits of Ms. Gelman were also painted
by Angel Zarraga, Tamayo and Siqueiros. An
additional Diego Rivera portrait of the Czech
ex-patriot is the centerpiece of the show.
Rivera's 1943 portrait is an air-brushed and
Max Factored image of Natasha as a Holly

wood studio starlet, complete with an extrava
gant white lily backdrop that echoes the folds
of the sitter's extravagant white gown.
Describing the Gelman collection, curator
Janet Bishop admits: "The exhibit is not a
comprehensive survey of 20th-century Mexi
can art, but nevertheless provides tremendous
insight into the Mexican Renaissance."
Although the Gelman collection provides
an adequate introduction to those artists in
volved in the Mexican Renaissance, it fails to
document events such as the Mexican Revolu
tion of 1910-1920 that affected their artist ic ex
pression. Nor does the collection give adequate
attention to the socialist implications of
Rivera's work, or the tempestuous relationship
between Rivera and Kahlo that fueled Frida's
passionate oils.
Perhaps these major omissions are due to
the collection's limitations; the Gelmans, a
couple steeped in the political numbness of
leisure life, had no desire to supplement their
art-collecting hobby with politically laden and
bluntly grotesque canvases. Perhaps that is why
there are no apparent socialist texts in the col
lection's assortment of Rivera paintings, and
few examples ot selt-loathingor masochism in
the collection's limited assemblage of Kahlo
self-portraits.
Instead, the Jacques and Natasha Gelman col
lection reeks of a safe Mexican Modernist aes-

thetic, an aesthetic neutered o!
nationalist politics and gross
interpersonal abuses.
Whereas the Gelman col
lection is an exhibit of a col
lector's amassed trophies, the
neighboring exhibit is one of
an artist's amassed thoughts
on paper. "Diego Rivera:
Mural Studies for San I ran
cisco and Mexico City" is an
introduction to mural-mak

The drawings are preparato

One of the most exquisite
works in the mural exhibit is
a red charcoal drawing of a
nude woman's back. With
complete economy of line

masterfully recreates the sup
pleness of the woman's bod\

Modotti, the Italian photog
rapher who documented

Riveras Mexican murals in the 19205).
Like the comfortably numb Gelman collec
tion, "Diego Rivera: Mural Studies tor San
Francisco and Mexico City" strays from politi
cized texts. Although the Muralist Movement
originally functioned to engender nationalist
pride in post-revolutionary Mexico, its expres
sive offspring have been peeled oft the politi
cally charged mural walls and attached to the
whitewashed walls of the museum.
Uprooted from Mexican history, the works
of Rivera and his fellow Mexican Modernists at
the SFMOMA may have retained their aesthet
ic appeal, but have sadly lost their social ur
gency.

tightening into a clenched
list. The drawings are also
sketches of the artist thinking
in different planes.
One of the most exquisite
works in the mural exhibit is
a red charcoal drawing of a
nude woman's back. With
complete economy of line
and color, Rivera's drawing
masterfully recreates the sup
pleness of the woman's bod\
(the woman is in fact Tina
Modotti, the Italian photog
rapher who documented

Riveras Mexican murals in the 19205).
Like the comfortably numb Gelman collec
tion, "Diego Rivera: Mural Studies tor San
Francisco and Mexico City" strays from politi
cized texts. Although the Muralist Movement
originally functioned to engender nationalist
pride in post-revolutionary Mexico, its expres
sive offspring have been peeled oft the politi
cally charged mural walls and attached to the
whitewashed walls of the museum.
Uprooted from Mexican history, the works
of Rivera and his fellow Mexican Modernists at
the SFMOMA may have retained their aesthet
ic appeal, but have sadly lost their social ur
gency.
