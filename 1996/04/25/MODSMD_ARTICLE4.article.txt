# Hoover Fellow discusses 'new politics of education'

Before a small audience at Tresidder Union
yesterday, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow
and Political Science Prof. Terry Moe offered
his views on what he termed the "new politics
of education," proclaiming that the current
public school system is failing in its mission to
educate.
Moe, one of the nation's leading proponents
of school vouchers, told a group of Stanford
College Republicans and members of the Palo
Alto Republican Women's Federation that the
loss of schools' autonomy threatens their via
bility.
"If we continue like this, we'll lose a whole
generation of kids," Moe said. "Schools are at
the bottom of a big hierarchy. They fall be
neath school boards, superintendents, local
government, state school boards, state legisla

tures, governors, the Department of Educa
tion, Congress and the President. All have the
authority to control schools."
It is this oversight umbrella, Moe contend
ed, that causes breakdown. "Bureaucracy un
dermines the ability to have an effective orga
nization," Moe said. "Education is like any
other area of public policy. There are well-or
ganized, vesttkl interests that derive their life
blood from the existing system."
These interests, according to Moe, are con
centrated in the California Teacher's Union,
which he called a "500-pound gorilla" which
consistently opposes voucher initiatives.
Moe's solution is to devolve power from
politicians to parents by giving parents the
"revolutionary" power to choose the schools to
which they send their children and the fman-
cial means — in tho form of vouch
ers — to do it.
Moe cited a battle waged four
years ago in Wisconsin as evidence
of institutional opposition to school
choice.
"Milwaukee, a mostly black city,
demanded not to he bused to the
suburbs, 'l'hey mobilized to demand

greater access to private schools in
the city. They were immediately op
posed by the Democrats, the unions,
the ACLU and the NAACP," said
Moe. "It was Governor Tommy
Thompson and the Republicans
who came to their aid. In the end,
they won a pilot program and Mil
waukee now has the only voucher
system in the United States."
Moe argued that by opposing
what he regards as the political
power of unions — wielded through
contributions to the Democratic

Party — citizens can effect far
reaching change in the structure of
education in the United States.
"The people who will gain the
most from the v< juchers are the peo
ple who don't have a voice now.. .
But when Republicans take over
inner-city districts this is what we
can expect representatives and
constituents working together to
solve their problems," Moe said.
"This is a major opportunity to
change the coalitional basis of the
politics of education."
