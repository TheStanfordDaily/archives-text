# "Denise Calls Up"
## Stanford alumni span long-distance and reconnect with this comedy 
### Athima Chansanchai 
Have you ever spent some days and
nights, maybe many, when the only
thread to the outside world is that
trusty phone by your side?
With fingers relentlessly pounding away
on a laptop keyboard, eyes gla/ed over more
than once, their heads at a most unnatural
angle and cigarettes dangling in their mouths,
the characters of "Denise Up are prime
examples of why people should get out and
smell the roses before drowning in a sea of
work and isolation.
A new comedy from Stanford-bred pro
ducer Todd Harris, and starring his good
friend and fellow Stanford alumnus, Dan
Gunther, "Denise Calls Up is a story about
the lives of seven friends in New York City.
The film, which won a Special Mention for
the Camera d'Or (an award for first-time
filmmakers) at the 1995 (Cannes Film Festival,
is done entirely through a series ol phone
conversations. It's a rambling domino effect
that starts out with two friends trying to set
their best friends up with one another.
Stretching for comfort in the arms of
strangers, they choose to stay behind the safe
ty ol physical anonymity while divulging the
deepest of emotions.
An interview with I larris reveals insights
(via phone, of course) about the film .is well
as I larris' journey to independent film pro -
duction.
I larris life took a critical turn at Stanford,
where as an undergraduate he produced
"Hair," the infamous nudie theater produc
tion. Gunther co-starred in the play and in
another 1 larris production, "lesus ( hrist Su
perstar.' After graduating in 19,51, Harris
went on to serve as managing director lor the
l'alo Alto-based Theatre Works before com
ing back to Stanford to work on his MBA,
which he received in 1986.
I larris talks about "1 lair" and how it was
received.
"It was a big scandal," he says, "We got
naked. People went ballistic. People were
hanging from ropes, eating acid, mushrooms.
It was the total end of the summer ol love."
Despite, or possibly because of, the enthusias
tic reception the production got, Harris knew
this was what he wanted to do.
"It was a phenomenon. It was quite a
high," Harris says. From there, it was natural
to take his love ol drama to the next level. At
Theatre Works, he found out what its like,
"achieving it on your own, without corporate
propping up," he says."I got to be the boss at
22," he says. Wanting to regain that control
led him out of Hollywood's grind.
"At TriStar I was a slave," Harris says. After
a year he left to form Skyline Entertainment
Partners, a film development partnership,
which served as a springboard for financing
"Denise Calls Up."
Dipping back into the well of Stanford
MBAs he went to school with, Harris was able
to gather approximately $250,000 worth of
investments for the film. Among the 35

friends and classmates who invested in
his film was Gunther, who had since
gone on to medical school but was really
interested in acting.
Recalling their days at Stanford, (iun
ther and Harris collaborated again in
"Denise Calls Up," in which Gunther's
undeniably sincere Martin frets and
fawns over Denise, the mother of his
sperm-donated baby-to-be. This
stranger shakes his and his friends' world
upside down. The only character filmed
outdoors, sometimes babbling with her
cellular phone attached to her ear, Allana
Übach's Denise is a refreshing break for

the films crew ol phone
talk addicts whose stale
lives open up when cele
brating the birth of her
baby.
Also starring in the
film are Tim Daly
("Wings"), Dana Wheel
er-Nicholson ("Tomb
stone"), Aida lurturro
("The Money Train"),
I iev Schreiber ("Party
Ciirl") and Carolyn
I eeney ("Another
World"). Schreiber's Jerry
is a petrified slob whose
bachelor existence is
practically falling on top
of him, with papers and
cigarette butts strewn all
over his tiny apartment.
Set up by mutual friends
with Fecney's Barbara,
the two become close and
end up engaging in a
more or less healthy
monogamous relation
ship laden with multiple
doses of phone sex.
Filmed entirely in

snort segments with the
actors talking into telephones and having di
alogue read to them by sometimes tired script
readers, the actors got a feel for the roles de
spite never having seen each other, and bare
ly rehearsing beforehand. All of the scenes
were shut in the same building on the upper
Hast Side of New York city, with much ol the
shooting done in a matter of weeks.
For such a wordy film, some ol the banter
isn't at the level of sophistication these friends
seem capable of. Sometimes it seems as if the
script pushes too hard in its satire and grinds
its point. That point, according to director
and writer I lal Salwen is, "Technology is rob
bing us of a certain part of our lives. Technol
ogy eliminates the need for real human con
tact."
Like the characters in the film, it seems as
though we've all adapted to lives connected
tenuously by the phone. It doesn't stop a full
range of emotions from coming through, as I
found out with Harris. A native New Yorker,
he's watching the Rangers-Montreal NHL
playoff game while we talk.

"Can
you wait
iu st a
minute? I'm
watching
this hockey
game," he
says in al
mo s t
hush e d
tones, then
continues,
"12, 11, 10,
nine, the
last few sec
onds of the
game." He

gets louder, "three, two, one! Yes! Rangers win!"
Harris' relief and joy is palpable, even from
across the country. He's at a good place in his
life where he says he "can create his own situ
ation." He's teamed up with John Davis (pro
ducer of "The Firm" and "Predator" and son
of former 20th Century Fox owner Martin

Davis) to set up Davis Entertainment Clas
sics, a fund for aspiring writers, directors and
screenwriters expected to yield anywhere
from $10 to 20 million.
But it's not all money with Harris.
"We do movies. It's more for the love of
movies than for the money," he says.
