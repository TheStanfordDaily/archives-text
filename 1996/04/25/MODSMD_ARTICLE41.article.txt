## (n the latest Savoyards production) 
### Kerry Rodgers 
M e excited about the things that
* L< aren't so exciting," instructed
| J stage director I 1/ Palfreyman to
the cast ol "Ruddigore."
Not that there isn't plenty to be excited
about in this (• i I her t and Sullivan play being
performed by the Stanford Savoyards this
weekend. In fact, after watching the three
hour run-through, I felt quite giddy from the
exaggerateel expressions, sexually-impiicit
humor, melodic singing, exuberant hand
clapping and all-around jollity exhibited by
the performers.
But two weeks before the show opens, Li/
is still trying to perfect every scene in the play.
At this point in the rehearsals there were still
a few rough spots: some confusion about
props, some forgotten lines and someone
waving their arms "to" when they should
have been going "fro."
Most of these "imperfections" only make
it better — with quick improvisations the
cast managed to elicit even more hearty
laughs.
Jokes aside, the play is, in all seriousness,
excellent. The principal roles are especially
well cast; they are able to make their eccentric
characters almost believable, and make their
tongue-twisting lines almost understand
able. The best part, though, is their voices;
they have strong, beautiful voices which
sound wonderfully harmonious in the many
duets and trios throughout the play— my fa
vorite part.
In addition to the trios, the script of "Rud
digore" has all the expected characteristics of
a good Gilbert and Sullivan musical: /any
story, jolly music, clever lines and a satirical
tone.

At the time it was written in 1887, it was an
intended parody of a popular genre known as
the domestic melodrama. ()ne hundred years
latei, it still works as a cornedic critique of
love and of law.
The actual plot is too intricate to explain ( I
highly recommend the plot summary) but is
basically about a farmer, Robin, who loves a
woman named Rose. His step-brother,
Richard, falls in loves with her as well and
ends up revealing to everyone that Robin is
actually the Baronet of Ruddigore. Since an
earlier baronet had tortured a witch, and she
cursed him and his descendants to have to
commit a crime per day lest suffer painful
death, this is a dreaded position. Thus ex
posed, Robin resumes his position, and is pa
tronized by his ancestors in the portrait
gallery. Then, in a twist of semantics, he man
ages to nullify the curse and rest assured,
everyone ends up with a lover and lives hap
pily ever after.
This show is being put on by the Stanford
Savoyards, our university's very own and very
old (lilbert and Sullivan company. They have
been around since 1973, and their name is a
common one for (i&S aficionados. The word
"Savoyard" comes from "Savoy" — the the
ater in London in which the original G&S
company, the D'Oyly Cart first performed
the plays.
The Stanford Savoyards is a unique group
because of its interesting members who range
in age from about 1 8 to 60. Although it is of
ficially a "student-affiliated group" and its
board of directors is entirely student-run,
there are only a small number of students
and many more alumni, faculty, staff and
community members in the cast.
One of the prime attractions of this par
ticular production is the cast of ancestors —
the Stanford Savoyards have a long standing

tradition of filling these roles with prominent
members of the faculty and staff. The tradi
tion will be upheld in this performance
thanks to the efforts of production assistant
Rita Taylor, the arm-twisting "mistress of
persuasion" who managed to recruit an all
star group.
Some of the play's gallery of ancestors
such as Vince D'Andrea, a psychiatrist at
Cowell, Roger Romani, a physics professor,
and Bill Sharpe, a finance professor in the
Graduate School of Business — have had ex
tensive experience in the music world,
singing in different groups throughout their
I ives.
But for some, such as Mark Wais, the 1 )ean
of Students, lean Fetter, the assistant to the
President, and Doug Osheroff, the chairman
of the Physics Department, this is entirely
new ground. Wais says this is his "adult the
atrical debut;" his only previous experience
being a "fifth-grade production of' Babes in
Toyland.' " Fetter has worked with Savoyards
before but claims to be one of the sole excep
tions to the rule that Welsh people have great
voices and Osheroff is a self-professed tone
deal performer. In fact, when Osheroff told
his mother he was going to be in a musical,
she responded, "Have they listened to you
yet?"
Nevertheless, they have managed to invent
coping techniques. Wais plans to blend in
with the chorus, Fetter thinks she'll mouth
the words and Osheroff says that if his musi
cally gifted colleague Romani sings loudly
enough into his ear he can manage to stay in
tune.
Though the cameo performers may not
necessarily be chosen for their musical talent,
the rest of the cast most certainly are. They are
an extremely gifted bunch, both musically
and theatrically. Many of the leads have stud

ied music and theater, and many of them have
been performing with the Savoyards lor years.
The student cast members, though few,
find it quite enjoyable to work with such a di
verse group. "It was kind of weird at first,'
said Elizabeth Horn, a freshman who plays
Zorah. 1 lorn also said the Savoyards produc
tion has been a valuable experience for her to
work with people who have "such a wealth ol
talent."
So, why are all these intelligent, gifted and
skilled people making all this hoopla about
this non-sensical, crazy, archaic musical
written by a lawyer-turned-playwright
(Gilbert) and his musical friend (Sullivan)?
"Besides being good music and all that,'
responds Neil Midkiff, a member of the cho
rus who has been working with the group
when he was an electrical engineering gradu
ate student in 1981, "it is just a lot of fun to be
in and sing."
As the play came to a close, I watched 30-
some people on stage dance and sing, open
ing their mouths to fill the room with a full
bodied sound.
A smile crosses my face and I think, "Yes
they look like they're having fun." It's so gen
uine and irresistibly contagious, the audience
can't help joining in with the merriment.

tradition of filling these roles with prominent
members of the faculty and staff. The tradi
tion will be upheld in this performance
thanks to the efforts of production assistant
Rita Taylor, the arm-twisting "mistress of
persuasion" who managed to recruit an all
star group.
Some of the play's gallery of ancestors
such as Vince D'Andrea, a psychiatrist at
Cowell, Roger Romani, a physics professor,
and Bill Sharpe, a finance professor in the
Graduate School of Business — have had ex
tensive experience in the music world,
singing in different groups throughout their
I ives.
But for some, such as Mark Wais, the 1 )ean
of Students, lean Fetter, the assistant to the
President, and Doug Osheroff, the chairman
of the Physics Department, this is entirely
new ground. Wais says this is his "adult the
atrical debut;" his only previous experience
being a "fifth-grade production of' Babes in
Toyland.' " Fetter has worked with Savoyards
before but claims to be one of the sole excep
tions to the rule that Welsh people have great
voices and Osheroff is a self-professed tone
deal performer. In fact, when Osheroff told
his mother he was going to be in a musical,
she responded, "Have they listened to you
yet?"
Nevertheless, they have managed to invent
coping techniques. Wais plans to blend in
with the chorus, Fetter thinks she'll mouth
the words and Osheroff says that if his musi
cally gifted colleague Romani sings loudly
enough into his ear he can manage to stay in
tune.
Though the cameo performers may not
necessarily be chosen for their musical talent,
the rest of the cast most certainly are. They are
an extremely gifted bunch, both musically
and theatrically. Many of the leads have stud

ied music and theater, and many of them have
been performing with the Savoyards lor years.
The student cast members, though few,
find it quite enjoyable to work with such a di
verse group. "It was kind of weird at first,'
said Elizabeth Horn, a freshman who plays
Zorah. 1 lorn also said the Savoyards produc
tion has been a valuable experience for her to
work with people who have "such a wealth ol
talent."
So, why are all these intelligent, gifted and
skilled people making all this hoopla about
this non-sensical, crazy, archaic musical
written by a lawyer-turned-playwright
(Gilbert) and his musical friend (Sullivan)?
"Besides being good music and all that,'
responds Neil Midkiff, a member of the cho
rus who has been working with the group
when he was an electrical engineering gradu
ate student in 1981, "it is just a lot of fun to be
in and sing."
As the play came to a close, I watched 30-
some people on stage dance and sing, open
ing their mouths to fill the room with a full
bodied sound.
A smile crosses my face and I think, "Yes
they look like they're having fun." It's so gen
uine and irresistibly contagious, the audience
can't help joining in with the merriment.
