## Virtually Wired 
### 
By Sam Park
Wired maga
zine has al
ways had
sort of an identity
crisis. The month
ly, geared towards
the compu-chic
and the Net-liter
ate, looks and feels
like a magazine,
but Wired has al
ways looked a little

uncomfortable next to PC World or even
Harper's Bazaar in the periodicals racks.
With its wild graphics, multi-dimensional
backgrounds and colorful lay-outs, Wired is
unusual in style. For although it has the tex
tual content of a magazine, the rebellious use
of bright colors, among other things, suggest
the designs of a computer screen.
Call it a virtual magazine.
For that reason, it's nice to see that Wired
has finally found the place where it belonged
to all along: a web site. Wired, the magazine
that makes computer nerdiness seem like
total cybersexiness, unveiled this spring a
web site that is to die for. Or at least, click to.
1 lot Wired, the online offspring of Wired,
is not being advertised as an "electronic ver
sion" of the publication, and that's truth in
advertising. The main focus of Hot Wired

seems to connect Wired readers to one an
other and to people who like Silicontalk.
When you click into the site, you are invited
to join in as a member. The process is quick
and painless. You just need to make up a
member name for yourself.
Once you're a member, you can read and
post messages in HotWired's "Piazza" talk
section. In "Rants and Raves," Wired readers
get to vent on the media, cyber-art and films
like the stop-motion animated film "James
and the Giant Peach." ("1 take small solace
from the possibility that Randy Newman will
rot in some Stygian pit for his crimes against
humanity," wrote one reader about the film's
composer.) Another interactive option,
"Threads," is a more conventional bulletin
board, where readers post lettcrs-to-the-edi
tor-type responses to articles. Finally,"Club
Wired" is a chat room where celebs like Sher
ry Turkic (the programming man's sex sym
bol, on the cover of April's Wired) discuss cy
berspace and etcetera.
This hyperinteractivc activity is the crown
jewel of Wired online. According to Wired's
statement of intent, it's a chance for readers,
editors and contributors to talk, argue and
brainstorm about the issues and ideas in the
magazine. Mazel tov! A magazine that talks.
But like mother, like daughter â€”
I lot Wired shares with Wired the same tem
perament and interest in articles about all
things plugged-in. In its debut web appear

ance, Hot Wired features articles on Internet
censorship and the dangerous media-Un
abomber dance. Hot Wired also shares with
the mother-space a taste for color and order
ly lay-outs (everything is perfect squares and
all the fonts sans sherif).
Wired's arrival into the online scene feels
very natural, like Elle opening its own shop in
Paris. Magazine lay-outs are, of course, made
up through computers, and Wired just hap
pens to exploit computer designs more freely.
It likes to do wild things. For instance, to have
a gorgeous, multi-dimensional-looking spi
ral image spread over two pages with a single
line of text running through the spiral. You
almost expect the page to morph into some
thing else. It's less journalism than computer
exploration, and so the web site seems ap
propriate. The site doesn't have the desperate
air of a traditional paper publication trying
(unsuccessfully) to appear trendy and "with
the times," like a dinosaur trying on dog col
lars.
Hot Wired is a good prototype for future
publication web sites. It doesn't simply
replicate the original publication for an on
line audience. Hot Wired docs have teasers
on Wired's features of the month, offering
attractive glimpses into the issue's content
(talking about Jim Cameron's Silicon Cine
ma, for example), but it never prints the text
itself. Hot Wired has its own articles, some
of which are just as informative and enter

taining as those published in the magazine.
The only weak section in the editorial part
of Hot Wired are the reviews in its Arts &
Entertainment section, most of which are
amateurish and pointless. They're bad
enough to make Pauline Kael curse the In
ternet.
Visually, Hot Wired is a real treat. The
index page makes it easy to go into a story,
with each link standing out, followed by a
one-sentence tease. But instead of flipping
through pages to find a story, all you need to
do is click. And to find out more about any
subject, another click. The set-up is designed
so that readers can navigate freely through
the different sections of the site, and yet easi
ly come back to any of the indexes and start a
new article.
Finally, the biggest satisfaction of all is to
know that Hot Wired complements, rather
than replaces, Wired. Wired's web entry does
not mean the end of the paper publication.
Wired is still a magazine that you can curl up
in bed with and read until the wee hours.
Hot Wired is where you go when you're in
Netscape anyway and feel like getting in
touch with other Wired readers. They fill dif
ferent needs and play different roles. For
those terrified that the Net will mean the end
of paper publications, rest assured. If Wired's
on-line version is any indication, everyone
will keep their day job and have a smile on
their faces at the end of the day.
