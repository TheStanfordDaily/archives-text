# UFCs, MARTIAN COLONIES, SALAD A CONVERSATION WITH
## Frank Black 
### 
Story by Taylor Antrim; Graphics by Mike Noren

WjfM rank Black sounds like a comedian doing a
Wi mock-up of the evening news. A screwy cut
wm and-paste job with all the right inflections.
Except he almost never deadpans; his humor is all
bluster and bombast. He speaks in capital letters.
"Are you in Davis?" he asks me before 1 can get a
word in.
"No. Palo Alto.
"That's right," he says, almost shout-

ing. "Palo Alto. And we're playing in
Palo Alto. That's right. I'm confusing
my college towns. Anyway, you're at
Stanford in Palo Alto."
This last statement comes out with
an emphatic news-anchor punch. Like
there's something really big about to
happen.
"We've played at the Edge before. A pr

Tv good show, actually. An off-season show."
His voice goes up another notch in volume: "We
were just warming up for 'The Cult of Ray 1 record
ing sessions!"
1 wait to see if he'll go on.
"1 like that little row," he says, referring to
California Street. "It's perfect for the rock band on
tour. You got your coffee shop, you got your news
stand, you got your burrito place. Everything you
need, basically. It's all right there."
After this last bit of commentary, Black lapses
into silence, as though he's through with off-the
cuff histrionics. He settles into a post-evangelical
irony that he won't shake tor the rest of the inter
view. His monologue on Palo Alto was pure
improvisation, an example u! the trange a.. !
unpremeditated collage his music tends to be. 1
should have foreseen the change in demeanor. Now
that 1 get to ask some questions, Frank Black mel
lows out. It's a lesson one learns quickly: he's best
when he's running his own show.
Mb y one of this will come as a surprise to those
familiar with Black and his nearly 10-year
fk Wi old career in alternative music. The Pixies
have become the ultimate name-check, with every
one from Gavin Rossdale to Butch Yig recalling
their unforgettable place in the sun. Frank Black,
then named Black Francis, penned some ot the
most irreverent and startlinglv articulate songs in
the history of the genre. Black lett the Pixies in 1992,
changed his name and began to chase down a solo
career. Three oddly vapid yet nonetheless appealing
albums later, he's still the big man of quirk, a legend,
if you will, in his own time.

However hallowed those Pixies-years are to

some of us, Black gives the impression that to

him they are over — a distant and unspec

tacular episode from his past. He refus

es to reminisce. His tone, when he

talks about them, is all obliging
weariness. I ask him how his
solo career differs from the

Pixies' material?
"I do not know,"

he says. "I do
not know.

1 am the
same per
son who

wrote
those songs

for those albums as the person
who wrote the Frank Black

albums. Sure there are some differ

ences; sure there are moves. 1 don't know.

1 suppose I have become stylized in some
way, but what is that? If I can't fucking
explain it, i guess 1 can't really expect every

one else to cither. I don't know. 1 write a
bunch of songs, and they come out the
way they do."
In other words, strange, stirring rock

sounds just flow through him like water
His nonchalance, while slightly self-sat
isfied, is kind of cool because true

skill should be innate, right? Fiis, it
seems, is an ettortless, sponta
neous innovation.

till, he does mention style.
Since the break with the Pixies, the persona
of Frank Black began to take on unprece
dented dimensions. What had been introverted
enigma in Black Francis, became grandstanding
hype in Frank Black. The liner notes ot his first
solo album, "Frank Black," feature picture after
picture of costumed idiosyncrasy. From green
suited lizard lover, to heavy-set farmer man, to Fu
Manchu look-alike, Black seemed unwilling to be

pinned down to any one disguise.
That album, a satisfying assembly of bent pop
rock, nailed down a evolving trend in Black s mate
rial: the surf-rock song.
He comments on this stage in his career: Well
you know, the thing is I discovered surt music
when I was touring around with the Pixies or
something, and while I'm sure I'd heard it before,
you know, I decided to listen to a lot of it. So much
so that it started to creep in on my records a lit

tle bit. Not necessarily a beautiful delivery or
anyihing, but it was my own naive attempts at
imitating the music that 1 was enjoying at that
time. I got a lot of credit for being this like 'oh,
he's a surf dude,' to the point where I got Ray
Gun magazine asking me to write pieces on
surf music, like I'm some kind of expert.
Which is fine. It's all innocent. I'm not com
plaining, and certainlv this was well before the

popularity of surf music made its debut in "Pulp
Fiction" and went on from there to occupying half
the TV commercials that are out there. So, you
know? while I have many precious things to say
about my enjoyment of surf music, I probably have
more negative things to say about people's percep
tion of me and my connection to surf music and
the over-use of it as a kind of advertising phenom
enon."

He pauses for a moment; then: "It's a tag. It's
like the UFO tag, that's like 'SURF UFO

WEIRDO FRANK BLACK: You know,
it's sound-bite city. Even in mv

small wee little world. I've got
as many sound bites and tags
attached to me as Bob Dole.

It's ridiculous.
He takes so much
delight in his sarcasm, the
self-attributed headline
huge in the middle of
his sentence, I wonder
how hard any of this
labeling really is on
him.
"It must be tough," I
say, trying a little sar
casm of my own.
"It's not tough. It's just
all kind of lame," he says.

His laugh is a deep,
delighted Frank
Black giggle.

slapdash label fixed

upon Black. I he last

two Pixies albums,

"Bossanova" and "Trompe Le

Monde," feature visions of rocket ships, flying discs
and enough alien eyeballs to lend both an aura ot
general other-worldly spookiness. His most recent
solo album, "The Cult ot Ray, revisits this territo
ry with such songs as the wonderfully reeling Men
in Black" and the kooky opener " The Marsist. I he

title of the album alludes to that most credible of
science fiction writers, Ray Bradbury. Reportedly,
Black's new label head, Rick Rubin, convinced him
to sign by taking him to a meeting of I FO
abductees.
When asked whether he believes in extraterres
trial life, he takes a long pause which could either
be genuine consideration or exasperation before
saying, simply, "I don't know.
"Do vou watch the'X-Files? I ask.
"No. A couple of times."
Inspired by the subject matter, he launches into a
description of "Punk Rock City" from " i he Cult of
Ray": "It's about genetically engineered people that
work in the lunar mines. It's kind of a science fiction
plot; of course, I'm simplifying things in an Omni
magazine kind of way, but we have been to the
moon, and assuming some members of the species
continue to pursue some of those goals, I imagine
that one day there'll be some kind of a lunar base. I
think, obviously if something like that's going to
turn into a successful industrial enterprise, it's going
to involve a lot of mining. I have made the plot a bit
more dramatic by having our genetically engineered
people grown in tanks, simply to
work the mines of the moon."

The song is infectious
rock-and-roll, with lyrics
which now begin to make
more sense: "Were brother
sister and we are doing
fine / spend our whole life
working in the mine / we get
the train and we get our
selves to work, and then

we have a little party,
then we have a little

party, baby!
Unlike
Agent Mulder
who always
"wants the
truth," Black
seems content
serving up his
strange version
of it.
He continues. "I
don't know if that

song is on an impor
tant topic or anything.

but 1 like the idea of it.
Certainly there are obvi
ous parallels to life in our

own industrial age. '16
times, and what do you
get? Another dav older

and deeper in debt.'
You know what 1
mean? '1 know a

mule
and
A

h i s

name was Sal,

r
15 miles on the"

Erie Canal.' 1 don't

know. It's all connected."

I'm not sure what he's

talking about. He sounds so

sure of himself — the newsman

voice is almost back — I decide to leave

it alone and move on.
Frank Black's second solo release, "Teenager of
the Year," was a loose, sprawling work. While many

of the tracks were brilliant, riveting pop-rock, there
were simply too many of them, and the wheat often
got lost in the chaff. Accordingly, the album did not
sell terribly well.
"Was 1 disappointed?" Black says. "Yes. Is my
heart broken? My heart is always broken, no matter
how many records we sell because of people's mis
understanding, overly cruel over-analysis of all this
stuff."
"Teenager" was the last LP to be released on the
well-known indie label 4AD. Black is now on Rick
Rubin's American Records and happy to be there.
1 ask about the end of his work at 4AD, and his
tone, more than his words, communicates some bit
terness.
"As you can imagine, 1 had a contract with them,
and the contract was coming to a finish. 1 had no
interest in staying. 1 went on to where 1 was want
ed.
Apart from being on a new label, another devel
opment is the absence of ex-Pixies guitarist Joey
Santiago on the new album. As with any question
about the Pixies, Black refuses to sentimentalize.
"Working with him wasn't the same as on the
Pixies albums because he was being brought in as
opposed to being the only lead guitar player around
for the whole session. Different for him. Different
for me. I don't know what I can tell you about it.
The guy comes down to the studio, brings his guitar
and he plays. That's what happens. Nothing else to
it."
He's equally matter-of-fact when it comes to
questions about recording I he ( nit ol Ray.
1 here was nothing really interesting. I wasn't like

on this album, I really got into primal
scream therapy, you know? I'm not a
real vibe man. When it comes time to
go to the studio, we like working under
fluorescent lights, in the morning, you
know? With coffee, like everybody
else."

Kut then he amends his own so
what?" attitude. "You know, it gets a little
rock-and-roll sometimes, 1 suppose. You

stay up late, you know, get drunk once in a
while, you know what 1 mean? Look at the lava
lamps while you're playing your mix. It's not exact
ly like working at an office job."
Black's no frills demeanor most likely comes
from his 10-year-old career in the business. In his
own words he's "a little cynical," reminding me that
there are some pitfalls to longevity. As good as
much of his solo career is, many of us cannot tor
get the days of "Doolittle" and "Surfer Rosa." He's
had to fight the image of a has-been. "Once you're
around for a while," he says, "people get tired of
celebrating you so they pick you apart.
I ask him what he sees in the future.
"It all seems to point to the same old cycle, mak
ing records, going out and touring them, and going
home and making more records. What else is
there? It's as basic as that.

"Do you still enjoy it?" I ask, thinking of the ear
lier, spontaneous Black, someone who reads tacts

hack with his own irreverent tlair.

"Sure, it doesn't get old,'' he says, bright
ening, revving up, for what I hope will be

an ending flourish. "I mean it does get

old, but it doesn't have anything

to do with me. It's this luck

ing Holiday Inn, you
know what 1 mean?
Blanding me out.
4 BJ Honeybutt

Chicken Caesar Salad.' I hat's what s
blanding me out."
If it were all stage, all perfor

mance, Black would have no complaints. As it

is, he's a mixture of weary cynicism and imagina
tive unpredictability. Still, live he's an invigorating
sight. Hung with multiple guitars which he slings
into his hands one-bv-one, his enthusiasm tor his
brief blips of rocking strangeness belie his occa
sional negativity.
All contradictions aside, whether hes inspired
or dreary, he is one of the most rare breed in alter
native: a true original.
