## RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE Evil Empire 
### 
1 low can one hand possess so much anger
lor such .1 long time and never run out ol
steam?
"1 vil I mpire,' the long awaited sopho
more album from Rage Against The Machine
is finally available. And while it may not have
what it takes to top their first album, it still
comes through with the high level ol energy
that listeners should expect from the band.
dthough some people might he quick to
state that T\ili mpire is nothing more than
a remake of the first album, I would disagree.
The band seems to have taken a step back to
wards their roots to come forth with an even
rawer sound. \nd while many of the riffs may
sound similai to riffs on the first album, gui
tarist Tom Morello's solos .ire even more
bi/arre than ever, ranging from solos that
sound like a record scratching to completely
oft the wall synthesizer sounds. And finally,
even it the songs are similar to each other,
let's face it: this shit rocks.
Vocalist Zack De la Rocha continues to
bring forth his anger filled, political mes
sages on this album. In his slightly distorted
rapping, 1 )e I a Roc ha is not afraid to take on
am political injustice. I lis attacks range from
the obscure "Is all the world jails and
churches?"' to the brutallv honest "So now
I'm rollin down Rodeo wit a shotgun I I liese
people ain't seen a brown skin man since
their grandparents bought one"
I he opening song "People of the Sun'
represents some ol the best aspects of Rage
Against the Machine: a catchy, repeating gui
tar riff a rhythmic, head bobbing drum beat
and angr\ vocals. I roni there the album leads
into the first single, "Hulls on Parade." I have
to admit when I first heard this song on the
radio I wasn't too impressed, but if quickly
grew on me. It's the kind of song that makes
you want to turn up your stereo all the way,
annoy your neighbors and destroy your
room as you absorb the energy that the band
gives off.
The rest of the album maintains this high

level of energy. If takes a few breaks and slows
down at times, but always returns to the dri
ving beat that makes Rage Against the Ma
chine so unique. Particularly pleasing songs
on the album include "Revolver," "Down
Rodeo" and "Vietnow."
"I .vil F.mpire" might not be is big a main
stream hit as the band's first album was, but
it is definitely just as powerful. It successfully
proves that Rage Against I lie Machine arc
not a one-hit wonder.
