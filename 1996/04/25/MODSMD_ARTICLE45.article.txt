# TO THE FAITHFUL DEPARTED
## The 						Cranberries

Dolores O'Riordan is not cool. Which
was, of course*, hall the charm of the ( .ran
berries' first two albums — listening to them
was like reading the teenage journal of some
one just as pathetic and geeky as yourself. Hut
on To the faithful Departed, O'Riordan
seems to fancy herself all grown up, tackling
issues like war, death and drug abuse, and
shying away 112 rom the cheesy unrequited love
stuff she and her band have so successfully
mined.
Sadly, the results are often laughable.
Whether unwittingly trivializing drug addic
lion ("Don't do it, O'Riordan advises "all
those kids with heroin arms' in "Salvation,"
a track that could have been ghost written by
Nanc\ Reagan) or barking out righteous self
helpisms (as in Tree lb Decide," which
sounds like a lost I rack from I )ebbie (libson s
"1 lectric Youth' sessions), O'Riordan isn't
above being blatant. Which would be fine,
perhaps even welcome, if what she was saying
wasn't so completely, utterh stupid.
Hut it is, and nowhere is this stupidity
more evident than in the album's more ele
giac moments. I he ( ranberries manage to
invoke (and milk?) the memory of John
Lennon with touching lyrics like "With a
Smith and Wesson .38 / John l.ennon's life
was no longer a debate." The victims of
Hosnia are tactfully remembered by O'Rior
dan warbling "Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Sara —
Hosnia!!" in "tastes great / less filling fash
ion. Hell, O'Riordan and company get so

death-happy that they manage to drop
the names Kurt Cobain and JFK in the
same couplet.
That said, "To The Faithful Depart
ed" isn't really all that bad." Many ofthe
tracks with overwrought lyrics are lev
eled out by catchy chord changes, and
the album is almost entirely saved by
tracks like "Hollywood," which musi
cally picks up where the hit single
"Zombie" left oil and lyrically writhes
with disturbed sexuality ("I've got a
picture in my head / it's me and you,
we are in bed").
The ( ranberries even successfully
risk getting retro with .1 virtual slew of
nerdy early '60s doo-wop songs, com
plete with linger snaps and trembling.

It would he unfair of ine to completely dis
miss an album that, almost against my will, 1
enjoyed quite a hit of. Much of "To The 112 aith
ful Departed" is horrendouslv trite and, even
worse, commercially calculated. Hut I en
joyed parts of it nonetheless
