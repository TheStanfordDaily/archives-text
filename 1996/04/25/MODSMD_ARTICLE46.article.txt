# AMMONIA
## Mint 400 
### 
Hailing from"The Land Down Under,"
most would expect this Australian hand,
Ammonia, to he patterned after their hugely
successful countrymen Silverchair. Hut in
"Mint 400, the band's debut release, whose
title is taken from an auto race described in
Hunter S. Ihompson's Fear and Loathing in
Las Vegas,' Ammonia's ever-changing niusi
cal style is a tar crv from Silverchair's proven
rock formulas.
"Drugs," its first single, combines simple
guitar rifls with vocalist Dave Johnstone's
slow, nostalgic voice. Johnstone slowly
laments, "Drugs and guns, but there's noth
ing I'm going to do about it / You're right,
and I'm crazy, hut there's nothing I'm going
to do about it.' With a song called "Drugs,"
one would expect some inspirational mes
sage either condoning or condemning drug
use. Instead, what we have is almost mean
ingless lyrics discussing apathy towards
drugs.
Many of the other songs plod along, de
void of inspirational messages. Hut neverthe
less, Johnstone has great range on his vocals.
For example, in "Face 1 )own," he caresses the
song with his sweet, reflective vocals and then
bursts forth with a "no holds barred" chorus
rant.
The gem on this album is "I ittle Death."
With a woman moaning in the background,
the eerie, sparse bass lines walk softly in the
background as Johnstone muses over isola
tion, depression and the need for sexual grat
ification. His drawn-out, contemplative vo
cals have an ethereal quality of slinking the
listener into the heavens. Much like Bush's
"Come Down," "Little Death" has the quality
of leaving the listener in everlasting reflec
tion.
Ammonia's music encompasses an entire
spectrum of music. They feel just as home
ranting a driving punk tune as they are
singing a sweet ballad. Ammonia can awe the
listener with a particularly dexterous instru
mental-only song like "Burning Plant Smell,"

or they can preach about sexual gratification
on "Little Death. With their repertoire of
musical skills, Ammonia has an auspicious
future ahead — in any genre.
