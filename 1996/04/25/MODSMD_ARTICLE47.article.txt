# GIL SHAHAM
## Prokofiev Album 
### 
Gil Shaham has been aggressively broad
ening his discography on DG. This new
Prokofiev album is certainly a strong con
tender in a venue previously dominated by
Oistrakh, I leifetzand Stern.
Prokofiev's Violin Goncerto No. 1 is an
early work noted for its ardent lyricism and
youthful fantasy. Shaham unveils the main
theme with a misty murmur and tackles the
shifts between arco and pizzicato passages in
the Scherzo movement with impeccable in
tonation. In this brief movement resembling
a circus stunt show, he teases with juicy slides
and wild leaps, capturing the essence of
"Scherzo" without soundingglib. Prokofiev's
uncanny design is manifest in the final pages,
where harp, muted strings and the solo \ iolin
join forces to create a magic spell. Shaham's
tone projects a Siren-like seductiveness as the
musical texture thins out and shimmers into
silence.
The Violin Goncerto No. 2 is a more aus
tere piece in line with Prokofiev's mature
style. Shaham buffs up his tone in the coarse,
somber opening theme that soon dissolves
