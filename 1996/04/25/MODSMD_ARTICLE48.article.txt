## GETO BOYS Resurrection 
### 
It seems that tlie Cieto Hoys have always at
tracted the motley elements of lite: dirty
women, bad press and controversial albums.
Their most recent TP, "Resurrection," suiters
from the egregious by-products ot
overblown solo careers, shameless self-ag
grandizement and unsavory lyrical content.
Yet the spotlight, so devious in its attractions,
continues to shine on these rap-makers,
proving that old formulas may be the most
lucrative.
Laced with conspiratorial political senti
ment, "Resurrection" opens with a divided
we-fall monologue whose sentiment loosely
straggles its way through the rest of the
album. With drawled-out funk instrumen
tals and haunting sound effects, the (ieto
Hoys attempt to detail Houston inner-city lite
in all of its grimness. "The World is a C ihetto,"
a raw breakdown of the Geto Boys' roots, is
opened by rap don Scarface: "Took on the
muthafuckin' map and find where Houston's
at / It's on the borderline of hard times .. ."
Seedier elements are quite easy to find.
"Open Mind," a homicidal anthem that basks
in the devilish play on words, is quite
macabre: "It's the return of the maniac / And
I'm residing on the outskirts of black, some
body take me back / I'm going crazy in this
muthafucka ..." And touts Bushwick Hill,
"And that ain't even the half... I laugh at the
thought of a body bag."
Six years after being released by Geffen
Records for their abominable lyrics, the Geto
Boys have done little soul searching. With a
moneymaking formula, "Resurrection" pro
ceeds like clockwork. "Niggas and Flies," a
limited take-off of the P-Funk classic,
"Rhythm and Rhymes," reeks of this atten

tion-getting strategy: "Niggas ignore me like
flies / It it was up to me, I'd burn a gang of
you hoes alive."
Perhaps "Resurrection" only succeeds in
resuscitating bad memories. A reunion that
may have been better left unorganized, the
album does little to excite. It's possible that
the trio of Scarface, Bushwick Bill and Willv
D lies on an unsavory plateau of sorts — one
that has continuously landed them in the
hot-seat of the press.
