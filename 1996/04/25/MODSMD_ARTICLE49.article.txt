Canadian rock groups usually have a diffi
cult time reaching the American market, often
tor no apparent reason. The band Barenaked
Ladies is a classic example of such a group..
Although their debut album, "Gordon,"
sold over 800,000 copies, the group is almost
entirely unknown in the U.S., with the major
it\ of these sales coming in either Canada or
the U.K.
The group s third album, "Born On A Pi
rate Ship,' onlv helps to emphasize how un
fortunate it is that \mericans aren't paying at
tention to the music of the Great North.
A surging blend of rock, pop and jazz, the
group's music mixes eclecticism with sharp
wit to create an utterly unique style. Intelligent
songwriting and allusions to the world of pop
culture ensure that the Barenaked Ladies pro
duce more than enjoyable jingles.
Essentially, they sound like They Might Be
(iiants with an attention span.
Their shot at the American charts, "Shoe
Box," has everything it needs to have: churning
rhythms, energetic guitars and an unforget
table chorus. Recalling The Rolling Stones'
classic "Under My Thumb," the track is even
underscored by a marimba harmony, a perfect
touch.
The rest of the album is equally compelling.
One truly original song, "Spider In My
Room," uses Native American chanting, but in
a very unexpected way. Instead ofemphasizing
the elegance and grace of the chant, the group
matches it with the crunchy percussion of a

rock band, weaving to
gether a seamless
whole.
Another excellent
track, "The Old Apart
ment," works as both
an organic rocker and a
yearning lament for the
past, avoiding all
cliches normally asso
ciated with songs of
loss.
However, the
album's greatest tri
umph is the gorgeous
ballad "Break Your
Heart." Taking .1 novel
approach to an ancient
theme, vocalist Steven
Page sings "I couldn't
tell you I was happy you
were gone / So I lied
and said that I missed
you when we were
apart / I couldn't tell
you, so I had to lead you
on / But I didn't mean
to break your heart."

Mixing shimmering guitar and flowing lyrics,
the hand slow builds to the brilliant climax,
which features vocal heroics so strong they are
literally blood-curdling.
Barenaked l adies may or may not become a
household name in the U.S., but "Born On A Pi
rate Ship" will be worth the money regardless.
