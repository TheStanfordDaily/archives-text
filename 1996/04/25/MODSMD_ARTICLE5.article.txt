# STS major to end in '98; students decry decision
## Too few faculty cited as reason for discontinuation 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Stanford's Program in Science,
Technology and Society will cease to
offer degrees beginning in 1998.
The program's director, STS
Prof. Robert McGinn, and Assoc.
Materials Science Engineering Prof.
John Bravman, senior associate
dean for student affairs in the
School of Engineering, announced
the change yesterday in a letter sent
to all students in the program.
"The decision not to seek renew
al of STS's degree-granting authori
ty is based on the fact that there are
too few senior faculty sufficiently
engaged in the undergraduate pro
gram on a day-to-day basis to make
support of the increasing number of
STS majors and honors students
sustainable at an acceptable level,"
the letter said.
As an interdisciplinary program,
STS must regularly seek authority

from the Faculty Senate to renew its
degree-granting authority. The pro
gram combines studies in humani
ties, social sciences, natural sciences
and engineering to explore the rela
tionship among science, technology
and society.
Bravman confirmed yesterday
that the action had been taken. "As
a result of retirements and people
going back to their departments, de
spite our best efforts to find some
minimum number of senior faculty
to be involved in the program, we
couldn't do that," he said. "We knew
... that we couldn't meet with a sup
ply of ready, willing and able facul
ty-"
McGinn stressed that the pro
gram is not disappearing altogether.
Although this year's sophomore
class will be the last class to earn
bachelor's degrees in STS, McGinn
said he hopes to establish a minor
and continue an honors program so
students will still be able to do in

depth work in the field.
STS is the third Stanford pro
gram to undergo significant changes
this year. In February, the Board of
Trustees approved the closure of the
Food Research Institute, and earlier
this year, the Operations Research
and Engineering-Economic Sys
tems Departments merged.
The number of majors in STS
has grown significantly since the
program began in 1971 and marked
ly just this year. Only 20 students
were registered as majors in STS at
the beginning of this year, but
McGinn said more than 50 students
have now declared.
Students said they were upset
both because the announcement
was so sudden and because they do
not understand why a program with
growing popularity must be cut.
"The first thing that struck me..
