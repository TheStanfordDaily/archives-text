# STS major to end in '98; students decry decision
## Too few faculty cited as reason for discontinuation 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Stanford's Program in Science,
Technology and Society will cease to
offer degrees beginning in 1998.
The program's director, STS
Prof. Robert McGinn, and Assoc.
Materials Science Engineering Prof.
John Bravman, senior associate
dean for student affairs in the
School of Engineering, announced
the change yesterday in a letter sent
to all students in the program.
"The decision not to seek renew
al of STS's degree-granting authori
ty is based on the fact that there are
too few senior faculty sufficiently
engaged in the undergraduate pro
gram on a day-to-day basis to make
support of the increasing number of
STS majors and honors students
sustainable at an acceptable level,"
the letter said.
As an interdisciplinary program,
STS must regularly seek authority

from the Faculty Senate to renew its
degree-granting authority. The pro
gram combines studies in humani
ties, social sciences, natural sciences
and engineering to explore the rela
tionship among science, technology
and society.
Bravman confirmed yesterday
that the action had been taken. "As
a result of retirements and people
going back to their departments, de
spite our best efforts to find some
minimum number of senior faculty
to be involved in the program, we
couldn't do that," he said. "We knew
... that we couldn't meet with a sup
ply of ready, willing and able facul
ty-"
McGinn stressed that the pro
gram is not disappearing altogether.
Although this year's sophomore
class will be the last class to earn
bachelor's degrees in STS, McGinn
said he hopes to establish a minor
and continue an honors program so
students will still be able to do in

depth work in the field.
STS is the third Stanford pro
gram to undergo significant changes
this year. In February, the Board of
Trustees approved the closure of the
Food Research Institute, and earlier
this year, the Operations Research
and Engineering-Economic Sys
tems Departments merged.
The number of majors in STS
has grown significantly since the
program began in 1971 and marked
ly just this year. Only 20 students
were registered as majors in STS at
the beginning of this year, but
McGinn said more than 50 students
have now declared.
Students said they were upset
both because the announcement
was so sudden and because they do
not understand why a program with
growing popularity must be cut.
"The first thing that struck me..
. is that the letter said the [program]
is ceasing to offer majors because of
increasing student interest," said
junior Jon Logan.
The reasons for ending the de
gree-granting program are paradox
ical, McGinn said, but a number of
changes left administrators with no
other choice.
Several faculty active in the STS
program have retired or left Stan
ford in recent years. Coupled with
increasing pressure on faculty to
win tenure and research money, the
STS program was left without
enough faculty support for the
growing number of students,
McGinn said.
"It's extremely difficult to nin an
expanding program with a declining
number of members of the professo
riate," McGinn said. "In 1996, it is a
time in which resources are ex
tremely scarce."
"We were rapidly approaching a
situation in which the program was
getting bigger and the number of
faculty involved was getting small
er," he said.
Faculty working in the STS pro
gram are appointed in another de
partment. Getting faculty to com
mit to spend a significant amount of
time working with the STS program
is not easv, McGinn said.

Computer Science Prof. Terry
Winograd added that programs like
STS, which do not do mainstream
research consequently fail to win as
much research funding.
"Work about (technology] in the
social context is rewarded different
ly," Winograd said. "The fact is the
budget doesn't flow to those things
that are important to teach but not
central to a research program."
Sophomore Monikka Mann said
she wished the Sclkxjl of Engineer
ing had considered other solutions
to the problem of shrinking faculty.
She said establishing a graduate
program could have been one way to
save the program. Students with a
doctoral degree in STS could then
return to Stanford to teach, she sug
gested.
Professors involved with the pro
gram, too, were unhappy to hear the
news.
"I think it's very sad," said Eng
lish Prof. Paul Seaver. "That was a
very important program here, and it
seems to me that a university like
Stanford with a strong engineering
tradition is exactly the kind of place
that ought to have an STS pro
gram."
Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy said he is not convinced
that the program couldn't be saved.
"If they wanted the program, it
does seem to me t hey could get more
faculty," he said. "I'm surprised it's
being dropped, and I don't think it's

a good idea."
But what STS faced as an inter
disciplinary' program is a fairly
widespread phenomenon, Wino
grad said.
"I think [STS] has had a lot of
trouble trying to find the right
home in the structure of the Uni
versity," he said. "I think there are
a lot of other interdisciplinary pro
grams at Stanford that have had
that same problem. Because the
whole faculty structure is so driven
by departments, it's hard to create
solid programs and maintain the
structure."
The program was running well,
though, students said. Although in
the letter Bravman discussed his
concern that there are too few facul
ty to sufficiently support STS ma
jors, students said they are happy
with the attention they receive from
faculty.
"Every STS major is concerned
about this," said Logan. "Even
though they said the change is not
going to affect us... it will affect us
for the rest of our lives. To have a
whole department where we created
our whole academic experience dis
appear â€” that's just sad."
Students said they are discussing
what course of action to take in re
sponding to the announcement.
James Gibbons, dean of the
School of Engineering, was out of
town yesterday and could not be
reached for comment.
