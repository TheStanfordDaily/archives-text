## Nothing Sacred 
### 
i vervone in the music industry is so gung
ho about finding the next Pearl Jam or
Soundgarden that bands like I log tend to be
overlooked. The simple vet original chords,
the folkish tunes and the down-to-earth, Bo\ -
Scout appeal is not onh rare, but soothing.
On 1 log's debut album, "Nothing Sacred,"
they start the first song, "Shut Down," with
earth-shaking instrumental. Like most of the
songs on the album, the song is based on a
simple three-chord riff, but its execution is
clean and (lawless, tree from unearthlv guitar
distortion and other assorted instrumental
garbage. And iust when the basic rhythms
start to become contrite, lead guitarist and vo
calist Kirk Miller shows oft his amazing fret
work with «i blistering instrumental solo.
However, the vocals hardly have the inspi
rational appeal of the instrumentals. In "Shut
Down," there is an obvious discrepancy be
tween the vocals and instrumentation, as
Miller's strained, weak vocals are easily
drowned out by the unrelenting, invigorating
drums and guitar.
Even though they're a punk band at heart,
throughout the album, the band covers a few
folk-like songs. Backed by two acoustic guitars,
Miller croons out a happy folk tune, character
ized by catchy, repetitive lyrics, dry, monoto
nous voice and choral refrain on "You & Me."
But then again, this happy folk tune is only
an extension of their cheerful, laid-back atti
tude. Even though the topics of their songs
range from love to societal injustices, every
thing about Hog — the tone of vocals, backing
music, etc. — simply quivers with perpetual
joy. If Metallica's songs are characterized by

depression and apathy, then Hog's songs
would stand at the other end of the spectrum
characterized by love and happiness.
Hog is a good example of a band that's
making their way in the world with clean, sim
ple guitar riffs and folk-like tunes. They're not
trying to please the corporate executives.
They're doing music because it's fun, and
that's the way it should be.
