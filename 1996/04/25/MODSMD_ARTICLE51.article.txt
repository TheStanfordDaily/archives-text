# LOVE AND ROCKETS
## Sweet F.A. 
### 
Alter laving low for about lour years, 1 ove
and Rockets came back on the
alternative / rock scene in 1994 with "I lot Trip
to 1 leaven, an album that didn't do so well on
the market. With the new release "Sweet I .A.,"
the group hopes to recapture the glory that
was theirs in the late '80s. Or perhaps they just
don't care either way. After all, the name of the
album means "sweet fuck all," a British slang
word lor "nothing.'
Although the lyrics of the album may re
flect this attitude, the music itself is anything
but ' nothing.' I he group of David Ash (vo
cals, guitar, organ), David 1 Haskins (vocals,
bass, piano, organ), and Kevin Haskins
(drums, vocals, sound effects) perpetuate a
dark, mellow sound that is slightly representa
tive of their '80s got hie sound. But in this
album, I.ove and Rockets have a grittier rock
sound as seen in "Sweet Lover Hangover."
However, there are several sweet ballads
such as "Pearl" who is "no ordinary girl / ain't
got no jaded feelings." There is hard electric
guitar work in the background — a strong
forcein the entire album — that isat odds with
the soft, lulling vocals. The intense lyrics ex
plore themes of life, relationships and personal
pain and suffering which is complimented by
the melancholy atmosphere in the songs.
There is a desolate catch in Ash's voice's as he
asks "what about love?" in "Sad and Beautiful
World."
But Love and Rockets'angst-filled mood is
not a Nine Inch Nails-esque-no-hope-in
sight-we-are-all-going-to-die sort of atmos-

phere. In "Natacha,"
Ash sings that "the
future may be rosy."
But more than this,
the general attitude,
as supported hy the
surrealistic sound ef
fects, is that there is
indeed hope in the
world.
If Love and Rockets
are looking to make a
big comeback, then
"Sweet F. A.," may just
give them what
they're looking for.
Overall, its an excel
lent album, with
some memorable
songs like "Sweet
Lover Hangover"
and "Sweet F.A." Un
fortunately, like
many other albums
out on the market,
there are some tracks
that just sound alike.
