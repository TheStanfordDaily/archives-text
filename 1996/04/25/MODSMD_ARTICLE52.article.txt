## The 						Substitute 
### 
"The Substitute" is nothing like "Danger
ous Minds," "Lean on Me" or the countless
other good-teacher-in-a-bad-environment
tearjerkers. It's an action movie that uses this
premise to set the scene tor explosions and
lots of gunplay, and it is when director Robert
Mandel tries to bring the two themes togeth
er that the movie fails. "The Substitute" is a
lively, fast-paced flick but the story is so im
plausible that by the end you have to roll your
eves back and smile.

Shale (Tom Berenger) is a Vietnam veter
an who has just returned from a covert oper
ation in Cuba to his Miami home. When his
girlfriend, a high school teacher, has her
kneecaps busted by student thugs, Shale de
cides to infiltrate the school as a substitute
teacher to seek revenge.
Shale enforces his own brand of discipline
in the classroom and makes no apologies, at
one point throwing four kids from a second
story window. Then Shale calms down and
gives the students an "anti-gang violence"
speech. What is so ironic is that Shale himself
is a road-weary mercenary who is trained to
kill, and is later responsible for the movie fi

nale's over-the-top violence extravaganza.
What Shale really seems to be saying is that it
is OK to kill people if you have a really good
reason. The movie loses much of its appeal
because it doesn't know exactly what it wants
to be — an all-out action movie or a moralis
tic story about fighting corruption.
Berenger brings a sort of ruggedness and
authority to his role, although at times he
seems bored. Ernie Hudson plays the school's
corrupt principal, a man with a beautiful of
fice who wears gold watches and fancy suits
in the middle of what looks like the poorest
high school in America. After playing so
many good-guy roles ("Ghostbusters,"

"Speechless," "The Hand that Rocks the Cra
dle") he is not convincing as a morally am
bivalent character. One of the better elements
of the movie is the excellent performance by
Latin music recording star Mark Anthony as
the ruthless gang leader Juan Lacas.
"The Substitute" is an entertaining flick,
despite the numerous plot holes and the high
level of "creative liberties" used to create an
unrealistic picture of the typical inner city
American high school. This is the kind of
movie you don't mind watching for free, but
that you wouldn't want to pay for.
