# Celtic Pride
## 
### 
For the Boston (Celtics, it's been downhill since their loss to
the I akers in the '87 NBA Championships.
I en Bias, their quick tlx for a failing dynasty, died of a
crack overdose before the first-round draft pick could even
play his first game in green. Then team captain and All-Star
Reggie 1 ewis collapsed of a heart arrhythmia on the court.
I .ist year the Boston Garden saw its last Celtic game. And
now, add one more item to the dynasty's growing list of
tragedies: "Celtic Bride."
lust take one glimpse at the movie s cast — David Stern
'Home Alone"), Dan Akroyd and Damon Wayans ("Major
Payne, "In Living Color") — and you'll know something's
wrong. It's as if the producer just decided to throw together a
bunch of misplaced has-beens, stick on a glossy NBA seal and
hope for the best. The result is a glorified sports comedy with
elementary school humor.
Jimmy Flaherty (Akroyd) and Mike O'Hara (Stern) are
two die-hard working class Celtic fans whose lives revolve
around Beantown sports. Mike — whose fanaticism for the
Celts is but a substitution for his high school glory days and
whose mood swings relative to the team's success have caused
his wife to file for divorce — tells his son that there is some
thing wrong with America's value system when sports come
after family. All humor in the movie plays off Jimmy and
Mike's over-the-edge devotion to pro sports and how tar they
would go for the team. The exaggerated humor didn't strike
the funny bone the first minute of the movie and, by the end,
all the hard-core fan antics were just annoying. Seeing grown
men shamelessly throwing away their lives for pro sports is
not funny.
The two fans' blind devotion culminates when they trick
arrogant Utah Jazz star Lewis Scott (Wayans), who just
burned the Celts in Game 6 of the NBA Championships (an
other example of an unlikely scenario), into getting plastered
at a local night club and kidnap him so the Celts can take the

rubber game.
The tnovie continues to plummet deeper by showing what
truly sad, spineless and generally unlikeable characters the
two sports nuts really are. Even Wayans' sense of caustic
humor, patented in"In Living Color," is emasculated by the
script's annoying tendency to depend on cliche; his character
constantly wavers between the badass dick and the normal
guy to the extent that Wayans' character becomes unpre
dictable and unbelievable.
With as much potential as the concept behind "Celtic
Pride" had, it was disappointing to see the script fail to at
tempt to hit a deeper level of humor. Hailing from Boston
myself, I had high expectations for a film that mocks Boston

ian sports tradition. All the movie had to offer in that respect
was four white Celtics on the parquet.
Even the final sports scenes weren't involving because ei
ther the Celtics will fail to grab that all important "the first
championship of the 90s" or the now-escaped Scott will turn
his two kidnappers over to the police if the Jazz lose. By the
end, the characters are so unidentifiable, inconsistent and
trite that you just don't care anymore. And any movie about
the Celtics in which a Bostonian just doesn't care about the
ending and is waiting for it to finally end just has not done its
job properly.
