# Mrs. Winterbourne
## 
### 
With all the hypo over television's trashy
talk shows, it is easy to forget that daytime diva
Ricki Lake was originally a big-screen actress.
"Mrs. Winterbourne" proves why: Ricki
simply doesn't have the ability to carry off a
starring role on the big screen. She's cute, she's
endearing, she's even funny to a point. The
problem is that she simply isn't talented
enough to be believable as the fish-out-of
water Connie Doyle, who through various
twists of fate is absorbed into the incredibly
wealthy Winterbourne family after a train
wreck kills young Hugh Winterbourne, his
wife Patricia and their unborn child. The
twist" is that the Winterbournes believe that
Connie is Patricia, and the movie's main joke
is how out of place the Jersey-bred (Bonnie is in

the well-mannered Winterbourne home. Not
a friend of subtlety, Ricki plays the whole
movie as if she's a trashy guest on her own talk
show: all exaggerated gestures and overdone
brassiness.
It's too bad, though, because "Mrs. Winter
bourne" is actually a good movie. Sure, the
whole "poor-girl-mistaken-to-be-a-rich-girl"
plot line is cliched, but "Mrs. Winterbourne"
puts enough spins on that formula to keep the
movie interesting. One such spin is the fate of
the real father of Connie's child; the mix-up
that ensues is not only one of the films hu
morous high points, but also the catalyst for a
pretty unpredictable ending (which is all you
can ask for in a movie like this).
And if all else fails, the movie can still ex
tract more than enough laughs from the hilar
ious Shirley Maclaine as the indomitably
spunky (when was the last time Shirley
Maclaine wasn't spunky?) Mother Winter

bourne. In fact, pretty much all the perfor
mances other than Ricki's are interesting and
high-quality. Brendan Fraser, who stars as
twins I high / Bill Winterbourne,deservesa lot
of credit for managing to make the idea of
falling in love with Ricki's idiotic Connie be
lievable.
Unfortunately, the supporting perfor
mances and cute subplots aren't quite enough
to make "Mrs. Winterbourne" a really good
movie. Ricki is expected to carry this film, and
she just doesn't cut it as a big-time actress.
I.very time she opens her mouth you expect
her to say "You go, girl!" or ask some quasi
empathetic talk show question. Too many sea
sonsas a daytime talk show host have rendered
her personality and what little acting ability
she once had pretty much void. It's a shame,
because "Mrs. Winterbourne" has the one
thing Ricki doesn't: charm.
