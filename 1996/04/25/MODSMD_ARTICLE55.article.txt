## Mike Noren Engineer Vigil unfit for Intermission editing job 
### 
Boy, Daily editor-in-chief Burl Her
man really blew it when he chose
Travis Vigil to he his Intermission ed
itor. lust because Travis happens to he the
former editor's roommate does not mean
that he is even the least bit qualified tor the
job. A senior majoring in mechanical engi
neering, Travis has had his world shaped by
numbers, equations and graph paper, leav
ing his brain so crusty and rigid that any
halfway flexible-minded entertainment-re
lated thought confuses him to no end. And
if that weren't enough, the hoy is freakishly
tense, wound tight like an angry rodent.! le
hasn't the patience for any sort of abstract
language, and the mere presence of some
thing tricky like a semicolon makes him ex
tremely edgy. You can tell by the way he hits
the keys on his keyboard — it's always pow
pow-pow instead of tap-tap-tap.

Recently I had the misfortune of having
a music review copy-edited by Travis. My
review contained a somewhat unconven
tional sentence structure (one that didn't fit
Travis' subject-predicate-period mold),
and Travis just flipped. "It doesn't make
sense," he bitched. I tried to explain the ba
sics of modifying phrases and sentence
structure, but he wouldn't listen. So after a
few minutes ol debate, he mounted his edi
torial high horse and changed my review so
that it now reads like a children's book. And
so if anyone bothered to read the review 1
wrote for the April 18 issue, keep in mind
that it was tainted, watered-down and
made much less good by this unhappy little
man, Intermission's engineer-editor.
All this is not say that Travis is a bad per
son or a had engineer. Indeed, I know many
people who like him, and I do believe he

will have a job after graduation. It's just that
he's not cut out for this sort of thing. Travis
was made to fix toasters, to do problem sets
and to make funny foam-core structures
(though judging from the severe glue-gun
burns on his hands, he can't even do this
very well), not to edit a magazine. Ideally,
Intermission-editing should involve a cer
tain degree of creativity, ©pen-mindedness
and comfort with words. Travis has none of
this. He sees the world like a Rubik's Cube,
a big gridded thing that he can wrestle with
'til it's uniform and plain. This is reflected
in his sou I - less Intermission: Structure over
style, that's his thing. So if a reviewer uses
some crazy hyphen or metaphor or quote
within-a-quote, Travis won't stand for it,
because that's just more colors on his cube,
and that contuses things. Perhaps Chris
Ramsborg, a longtime friend of Travis, says

it best: "He's boring as shit. He produces In
termission as if he has a pole up his ass.
Having just rushed into the computer
cluster where I'm writing this, a frenzied
Travis reads over my shoulder and replies,
"It's not that I'm edgy or tense, it's just that
things piss me off." But, Travis, you must
realize that by wrenching every little bit of
soul from people's articles, by viewing the
entertainment world through your tight
and colorless goggles, by stomping around
I'he Daily office like an angry little rhino,
you are pissing people oft. So please, Travis,
you're not fooling anyone anymore. You
may look like John Cougar Mellencamp,
and you may own a couple guitars, but your
heart and brain are 100-percent number
plugging engineer. So go back to your toast
ers, and leave the magazine stuff to other
people.
