# 10 Stanford profs named to Arts and Sciences academy

### Amy Slucter Staff writer 
Ten Stanford faculty members have been elected to
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the 200-
year-old organization committed to the development
of knowledge across the entire range of intellectual
disciplines.
Stanford's 10 inductees reflect the broad spectrum
of inquiry promoted by the academy. Among this
year's fellows are Political Science Prof. Barry Wein
gast, Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan, Social Psychology
Prof. Claude Steele, Civil Engineering Prof. Perry Mc-
Car+v, Historv Prof. Pnvid Kennedv. Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Joseph Goodman and Thomas Ehrlich,
a visiting professor of international law.
In addition, three scholars from the Medical Center
were elected: Molecular Pharmacology Prof. Helen
Blau, Neurobiology Prof. Eric Knudsen and Develop

mental Biology and Genetics Prof. Matthew Scott.
The new Stanford inductees are among this year's
159 newly elected members. The academy consists of
3,300 fellows and 550 foreign honorary members, in
cluding 168 Nobel Prize laureates and 58 Pulitzer
Prize winners.
The honor of being elected has given Knudsen a
heightened sense of his intellectual responsibilities,
he said.
"In a certain respect, recognition like this may in
crease my credibility in some people's eyes," he said.
Knudsen, whose work focuses on demonstrating
the role of experience in shaping the functional prop
ert.ios of the brain, said his research has shown that
experience is much more important to a young animal
than it is to an adult animal.
Knudsen's work on both hearing and vision has al-
lowed him to analyze how the
brain interprets information it re
ceives from the eyes and the ears.
According to Knudsen, this re
search has demonstrated the
tremendous importance that early
experience plays in forming the
neuro-pathways of the brain.
"It is early experience that al
lows us to make sense of our envi
ronment," he said. "I think it's im
portant for both people and clini
cians to recognize how important
early experience is and to recog
nize the importance of an enriched
environment for growing chil
dren."
Biologist and geneticist Scott
emphasized the importance of
communicating discoveries like
Knudsen's to the general public.
"Election to the academy is def
initely an incentive to take a
greater role in trying to communi
cate the meaning of new biological
discoveries to people who aren't
specialists in the field," he said.

His work with homeotic muta
tions has led him to the discovery
that all proteins share a common
domain called the homeodomain.
"The recognition that there is
much more in common in ani
mals, including humans, than
anyone had ever expected is im
portant because you can relate
animal research to humans much
more than anyone had anticipat
ed," he said.
Steele said he felt grateful for
his election to the academy.
"When one feels fortunate, you
feel a renewed interest and com
mitment to your work," he said,
explaining that his election has
provided added inspiration to con
tinue with his work on how self-es
teem is constructed and decon
structed.
"My aim has been to under
stand basic psychological process
es that affect everyone and to see
how those processes bear on im
portant social issues," he said.
"There is a tension between work
ing on the basic nature of human
psychology and seeing how psy
chology bears on important social
issues."

Blau said belonging to the acad
emy will make it easier for her to
have an effect on policy.
"I would like to play a role in
how genetic information is used,"
she said. Blau, whose research cen
ters on how cells specialize, said it
is very important to regulate how
genetic information is used.
Blau suspects that she was rec
ognized for her work on a new ap
proach to gene therapy for treat
ing diseases. Her research, done
using muscle cells, showed that
muscle cells could be engineered
to produce proteins that would as
sist in delivering clotting factors
for treating hemophilia and pro
teins that alter cholesterol levels.
"This is a novel form of drug de
livery," she said. "It is important
because it gets the body to fight its
own disease."
Blau said she enjoys her work
because it challenges long-stand
ing orthodoxy. Her view largely re
flects the original goal of the acad
emy, which was to develop knowl
edge as a means of promoting both
public interest and social progress.
"Challenging dogma is the hall
mark of my work," she said.
