### Heather Knight Staff writer 
Most Stanford students lead hectic
lives — challenging classes, extracur
ricular clubs, varsity sports .. . and
filming movies?
Freshman Reese Witherspoon, first
seen in her role in"The Man in the

Moon" at age 14, has not let college life
slow down her budding film career.
In the middle of winter quarter, she
received an offer she could not refuse.'
"Somebody called and said they'd
give me money if I came to Minnesota,"
Witherspoon said.
So she stopped out, and, accompa
nied by fellow Cedro House resident

and friend-turned-personal-assistant,
freshman Liz McDade-Montez, relo
cated to begin filming her newest pro
ject, "Overnight Delivery."
The movie, in which she co-stars
with Paul Rudd of "Clueless," is a ro
mantic comedy about a University of

Minnesota student who thinks his
long-term girlfriend back home is
cheating on him. After writing a
"Dear John" letter to her, he dis
covers that his intuitions were
wrong. So, with the help of his U of
M friend, Witherspoon, he must
intercept the letter in 24 hours.
Witherspoon is not the only
Stanford student who will be seen
in "Overnight Delivery." As one of
the perks of personal-assistant
hood, McDade-Montez, will be an
extra on the set.
McDade-Montez said the choice
to travel with Witherspoon was
not difficult.
"I I wanted] to take advantage of
this opportunity. It's a one-time
thing. I don't plan on being a per
sonal assistant forever," she said.
Though McDade-Montez said
her parents were surprisingly sup
portive of the move, she met with
mixed reactions from her friends.
"Some of my friends back home
were really excited for me. Some at
Stanford were kind of skeptical

about stopping out," she said.
Perhaps Witherspoon is the
happiest with McDade-Montez's
decision.
"I knew I wanted a friend to be
with me — someone who's ex
tremely intelligent . . . and really
gorgeous. I'm just kidding," With
erspoon said. Having a friend
along has made the transition
from full-time student to full-time
actress a little easier.
Balancing her film career with
her education proved difficult even
while still at Stanford, according to
Witherspoon. She was not able to
participate in many extracurricu
lar activities during the fall be
cause she spent her weekends (ly
ing around the country for promo
tions and other work.
"It's hard because am I going to
have a high-paying career or go to
school and do the right thing?" she
said.
Witherspoon does plan to "do
the right thing," though, by re
turning to Stanford in the fall,
with the help of revenue from her
films, which she is using for tu
ition.
Witherspoon even admits to en
joying classes and said college

work is not as hard as she thought
it would be. She plans to major in
communication, but is still consid
ering the possibility of going pre
med.
Witherspoon did not meet with
too many awe-struck fans at Stan
ford, she said, although some peo
ple still call her by her characters'
names.
"Everybody got used to my
lifestyle. Stanford is good for ac
tors because it's big enough for you
to have your own life," she said.
Both fans and friends can see
her now onscreen in "Fear," star
ring Mark Wahlberg, the artist for
merly known as Marky Mark.
Rumor has it that the two are ro
mantically involved, but Wither
spoon said she has no boyfriend at
the moment. Regardless of their
relationship status, the film has
done very well.
"We were the highest average
per screen. We opened really well,"
said Witherspoon, who said she
had never done such a commercial
film before.
Her movie "Freeway" is also
due out soon and fans can see her
on the cover of this month's Sassy
magazine.
