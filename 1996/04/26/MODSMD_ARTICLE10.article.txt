### Richard Engel Contributing writer 
Even the most educated students of Ameri
can history probably have never heard of the
name Ebenezer Macintosh. He is one of the
many poor or minority figures UCLA History
Prof. Gary Nash believes have been excluded
from American history.
In last night's symposium, hosted by the
President's Committee of Culture and Cul
tures, professors from Stanford, UCI.A and
Princeton discussed the limitations of Ameri
ca's current understanding of its history. Stan
ford Prof. Clay Carson, director of the Martin
Luther King Papers Project, moderated the
discussion entitled, "Inclusive Narratives of
American History."
According to Carson, the sparsely attended
event"was sponsored by the president of the
University in his goal to explore multicultural
ism."
We need to add to our treasury of narra-

tives," Nash said.
Princeton Prof. Nell Painter, who teaches
about southern history, black radicalism and is
the author of "The History of the American
Self," began the evening by discussing how
American history is too often understood in
terms of both its literal and symbolic "black
and white struggles."
"We need to resist tropes," Painter said.
"There is an assumption that all groups have
the same experience. We have a narrative of
the gay and lesbian experience and assume
that all their histories are the same; it doesn't
work that way."
In a discussion that touched on topics as di
verse as the settlement of California and the
appointment of Clarence Thomas, Painter
urged students and professors of history to
"recognize power relations, not only between
blacks and whites, but within and around
groups."
Nash, who helped pioneer UCIA's African
American studies department and is author of

numerous books on American history, relayed
the stories of "unsung" American figures.
Nash explained that the Bostonian shoemaker,
Macintosh, was, in fact, highly influential in
organizing revolts in 1765 that sparked the
American revolution.
Nash is also a co-chair of the controversial
Standards Committee, designed to re-examine
how American history is taught in this coun
try. "For a democratic society, we have created
a remarkably undemocratic history," he said,
indicating a lack of diversity in the narratives
presented in American classrooms
Nash and his committee have been criti
cized for trying to push major political figures
like George Washington and Benjamin
Franklin off center stage and replace them
with lesser known poor and underprivileged in
dividuals.
Responding to critics, Nash said, "My argu
ment is not that we need to knock the large fig
ures off their pedestals, but we need to create
room in the Pantheon for the large and small."
