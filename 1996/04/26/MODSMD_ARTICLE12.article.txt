Raising minimum wage debated
(AP) â€” The debate about raising the minimum wage is under way.
For some, the hourly increase proposed in Congress would be welcome, whether it's the
Democratic 90 cents over two years or the $1 over 15 months proposed by a breakaway
group of House Republicans.
But the National Restaurant Association, a trade group representing McDonald's and
other eateries, says raising the minimum would be a big mistake. In its view, an increase
could wind up costing many minimum-wage earners the jobs they hold now.
Ijow-wage businesses, with backing from most Republican legislators, strongly oppose
the idea they should pay employees more. They cite economists who fear a higher minimum
wage would be inflationary.
