# Labor Party decides to end opposition to Palestinians
## Israeli-Palestinian peace process boosted by gesture 
### 
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) - Swiftly
answering the PLO's decision to end its
call for Israel's destruction, the governing
Labor Party on Thursday abandoned its
long-standing opposition to a Palestinian
state.
With its landmark vote, Labor discard
ed what was once a bedrock tenet and
became the first major party in Israel to at
least tacitly accept the idea of an indepen
dent Palestinian state, once unthinkable
for most Israelis.
The move came a day after the Pales
tine National Council annulled clauses in
the PLO charter that called for Israel's
destruction.
The momentous exchange of gestures
is expected to bolster the Israeli-Palestini
an peace process, frozen since a series of
suicide bombings by Islamic militants in
February and March killed 59 victims in
Israel.
Yet Israel still faces the threat of attack
from Muslim extremist groups such as
Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and Hamas.
Prime Minister Shimon Peres told
about 1,000 Labor Party delegates who
had assembled in Tel Aviv to vote on the
new platform that it would help him
"achieve a comprehensive peace in the
Middle East" if he is re-elected in May 29
balloting.
The new platform also abandons anoth

er major Labor Party position: that the
Golan Heights, captured from Syria in
1967 and annexed in 1981, are essential to
Israel's security. It says only that the
strategic plateau, which Syria wants in
exchange for peace, "has political impor
tance."
Israel-Syria peace talks have been
snagged for years over the Golan Heights
issue.
Peres said the new platform "gives the
government a free hand to negotiate."
While Peres did not explicitly say he
now accepted the Palestinians' goal of
statehood, he stressed that the current
autonomy arrangement in the West Bank
and Gaza "cannot remain."
"With the Palestinians, we wish to
arrive not at yet another interim settle
ment but a permanent settlement, a fun
damental solution ... total elimination of
the conflict between us and the Palestini
an people," he said emphatically.
In Gaza, Yasser Arafat praised Labor's
move. "It will help a lot in the negotia
tions for the final status," the PLO chief
said.
Talks on a final Israel-Palestinian set
tlement, to begin May 4, are to address the
most difficult issues dividing the sides: the
PLO's demand for statehood, final bor
ders, and the future of Israeli settlements
and the disputed holv citv of Jerusalem.
