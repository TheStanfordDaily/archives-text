WASHINGTON (AP) - Ford Motor
Co. is recalling about 7.9 million airs,
minivans and pickups in the United
States with the same type of ignition
switch that has caught fire in hundreds of
vehicles. It is the second-largest recall in
U.S. history.
The No. 2 automaker also is expand
ing its Canadian recall of vehicles with
the switches from the 248,000
announced late last year to a total of
859,000 to match the makes and models
being fixed in the United States.
That brings the total recall number to
about 8.7 million vehicles — the largest

recall by a single automaker. The largest
recall was last year when 10 automakers
had to fix seat belts on 8.8 million cars
because of concerns the buckles some
times failed to latch or unlatch.
The total cost of the recall was expect
ed to exceed $200 million, Ford sources
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The ignition-switch problem was
under intense scrutiny from the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration
because consumers had reported about
820 fires from the switches.
Some of the cases included reports of
fire even when the vehicle was parked

and shut off, according to documents on
file at the highway safety administration.
No injuries have been reported in the
United States.
The first Canada recall followed 260
reports of fire or smoke from ignition
switches, causing minor injuries to three
people.
The NIITSA had been investigating
23.5 million Ford vehicles in the United
States with the same type of ignition
switch. However, some cars with the
switch had no or few reports of fires — for
instance, the 1984-87 Lincoln Continen
tal and Lynx.
