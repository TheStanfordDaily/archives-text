University should
provide funding
for Women's Center

IT'S TIME FOR the administra
tion to make a change that's
long overdue. Since its inception
over ten years ago, the Women's
Center has never received program
funding from the University.
The University provides only the
building, its basic upkeep, and a
part-time coordinator.
Unlike many of the University's
other ethnic and cultural centers
such as the Asian American Activi
ties Center, El Centro Chicano, the
Native American Cultural Center
and Bechtel international Center,
the Women's Center is forced to
seek funding for programming from
the Stanford students and other
outside sources.
The Women's Collective is the
primary mechanism by which the
Center receives this additional
funding.
In addition to running the
Women's Center, the Women's Col
lective acts as an umbrella organiza
tion, educating about and advocat
ing for women's issues in both the
undergraduate and graduate com
munities.
By a small margin of about 60
votes in this spring's Special Fee
vote, the Women's Collective lost its
funding for next year. Losing the fee
means that there is still a Center, 1 its
furniture and some undergraduate
and graduate part-time coordina
tors, but no programming budget.
In the past, the administration
has been able to shift the responsi
bility for creating a safe space for
women onto the shoulders of stu
dents. Now it's time for the Univer
sity to provide an adequate and con
sistently available source of funds.
This issue goes far beyond just
providing funding for the mainte
nence of the building. The Uni
verisity financial support reflects its

support for the women students on
campus. The Women's Center fills a
crucial niche in the Stanford com
munity, particularly since studies
have shown that women on campus
are more likely to have health and
psychological problems than men
on campus.
The Women's Collective works
closely with other organizations
such as the Graduate Women's Net
work and the African-American
women's group, Sisters at Stanford.
They also provide a dissertation
support group and coordinate Body
Image Awareness W r eek, among
other programs.
Without funding, these programs
will also face financial difficulties.
In order to grow and to continue
to have programming development
from year to year, the Women's
Center needs a full-time, paid coor
dinator. In the past, the money from
the special fee has been used to sup
plement the funds that the Univer
sity provides for a part-time coordi
nator. Now, however, this money is
lost.
Currently, the Women's Collec
tive is looking toward the ASSU
Program Board for short-term
funding to keep the Center run
ning. However, this funding will not
sustain them for long.
The Women's Collective's contri
bution to the education and aware
ness of Stanford students is an
important one, and one that should
not go unnoticed next year simply
from the lack of a mere 60 votes in
the Special Fee election.
The urgency of the Women's Col
lective funding problem shoui<3 rally
the University to provide the same
funding resources to the Women's
Center as it provides to the other
community centers on campus.
The programming at the
Women's Center is directed toward
over half of the student body and
can hardly be considered insignifi
cant.
It's time that the University
financially recognizes the invalu
able service that the Women's Col
lective provides to the student com
munity.
