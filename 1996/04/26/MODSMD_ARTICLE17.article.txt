Students concerned over University's STS decision

ONCE AGAIN, THE University
has yanked the rug out from
under the feet of its students.
Despite acknowledging in a public state
ment that the Program in Science, Tech
nology and Society has "a reputation for
excellent undergraduate teaching, dili
gent advising and unusually active
involvement of its majors, " the Univer
sity has decided to axe the program. It
seems that Engineering Dean James
Gibbons, Humanities and Sciences Dean
John Shoven and School of Medicine
Dean Eugene Bauer were all just dou
bletalking when they spoke, only last
week, about how important teaching and
interdisciplinary programs are.
Negotiating the future of STS over
the past year or so, the University waited
until just yesterday to notify students via
email. And, once again, the University
chose to keep students in the dark about
another policy change which will affect
us all. This act represents another exam
ple of the University's irresponsible lead
ership — remember the closure of FRI?
The new grading policy? The attempt to
remove the wacky walk? The recent
removal of student participation on the
Faculty Senate's Planning and Policy
Board? We do not want STS to become a
casualty of a clandestine process.
The removal of the STS major is like
a slap in the face to all current and past
majors and honors students. How can
President Casper honestly maintain that
alumni have a moral obligation to give

money to this University in order to
ensure that those who follow will have
the same opportunities? The University
is trying very hard to eliminate these
very same opportunities.
We would like to remind the Universi
ty, its administration and the entire cam
pus that having a degree-granting pro
gram in Science, Technology and Society
is an asset not only to the students who
major in it, but also to those who don't,
and to the University as a whole.
STS represents the best parts of a
Stanford education. Combining science,
technology and society, STS addresses
questions about how the things we build
shape our society and vice-versa, in a
unique and important way. As a pioneer
ing/western University, Stanford
should be proud of focusing on such
important issues — issues that do not
bring in the big bucks, but are impor
tant nonetheless.
Killing STS directly harms students
and undergraduate education. Over the
past five years, the number of STS
majors has grown from 20 to 50 and
should hit 70 next year. Put simply, STS
majors value this program. The ground
ing STS majors receive in technical and
social studies gives them a solid founda
tion to build upon — many go on to
study law, business, medicine, engineer
ing, education, public policy, etc.
Additionally, STS classes are always
brimming with non-majors. For example,
STSIIO, Ethics and Public Policy, one of

the most popular and rigorous classes at
Stanford, attracts more students than it
can hold every year. How many students
have looked at contemporary technologi
cal issues differently after taking this
and similar STS classes?
STS is a major that students, faculty
and alumni care passionately about.
Within 6 hours of hearing about the
demise of STS, one alumnus pledged a
$1000 donation to Stanford towards
keeping STS alive.
As students, we all put a lot on the
line financially to be here, and we
deserve a quality education. STS should
be part of that education. Cutting a
growing program which displays such
growth and popularity seems fairly con
trary to the University's commitment to
undergraduate education. How can
Stanford face its alumni, its donors, its
incoming freshman class and (probably
most importantly in its eyes) other uni
versities, and talk about its commitment
to educating and serving the needs of
students, to supporting teaching as
being just as important as research,
while cutting popular and academically
rigorous programs like STS?
If the fact that it is valuable to Stan
ford students is not a convincing reason
to keep STS, the fact that having a pro
gram in Science, Technology and Society
boosts this school's reputation (and
national ranking) should be. All of the
top engineering schools have similar
programs; MIT, RPI, Virginia Polytech-

Nic, Cornell are just a few. If nothing
else, this administration believes in
making Stanford competitive with other
schools on their own terms — STS does
just this.
If the University really wanted to
save this program they could find the
resources!
As students, we care passionately
about the future of STS and have mobi
lized because we feel a moral obligation
to ensure that those who come after us
have the same opportunities that we
have had.
We think that studying how we use
technology and how it affects us is just
as important as studying how to make
better technologies. We think that this
program is of great value and that it
should be expanded to meet growing
demand, not killed off. We think that
the University is making a tragic mis
take. We do not intend to let this issue
be swept under the rug. In recent years,
the University has unveiled and
attempted to sneak too many issues by
its students. This trend must be
stopped.
We ask for the support of the Stan
ford community as we work to ensure
that the Program in Science, Technology
and Society is not eliminated, but
expanded.
