## Homelessness: thinking twice 
### 
"Oh, think twice, it's just another day for
you and me in paradise. . ."
— Phil Collins,
"Another Day in Paradise"
SOONER OR LATER, if you leave
the pristine palace that is the
Farm, you are faced with the ques
tion of what to do when approached by a
homeless person. I have to admit I was
surprised at the number of people ask
ing for money in downtown Palo Alto
when I first saw them but decided it
probably made sense. After all, they
should probably go where the money is.
Here the homeless people seem to
have a fairly standard routine. Some
have a piece . of cardboard which
announces their plight. Other? hnvn a
speech or phrase which they repeat over
and over. They are all polite. You might
think they have to be, but I've seen rude
homeless people in New York.
In New York, necessity gave birth to
invention by the homeless in the form of
little "services" which they provide for
you. There are some who sell homeless
publications on the subway. If you are
driving a car in NYC, they clean your
windshield (often after spitting on it
first.) If you are on foot, they open doors
for you, usually doors leading to and from
banks and supermarkets. Hint, hint.
The most common response is to
ignore their existence. Another line in the
song goes . . he walks on, doesn't look

back/ he pretends he can't hear her . .
and you can watch people continuing in
their conversations, finding something
fascinating to look at in a store window,
gazing intently at their own shoes. In a
television program about the homeless, I
heard that what they feel is the worst
part of their existence is that they are
invisible, that no one talks to them.
So what do you do? After all, being
asked for money by a homeless person
(would the PC term be "lodging
impaired?") is an uncomfortable
reminder that all is not right with the
world; here is evidence you can't turn
the page on or change the channel to
view something less disturbing.
When I was living in New York, I
developed a relationship of sorts with a
few regulars. I saw two or three on
almost a daily basis. Since I've always
had problems ignoring people who speak
politely to me in the street, in spite of
the fact that I'm a native New Yorker, I
spoke to them every day. Occasionally, if
I had change rattling in my pocket, I
would give that to them, but they were
friendly even if I didn't, and I didn't
have to listen to the guilt trips they
assaulted my fellow commuters with
when they didn't fork over some money.
There was one guy who used to sit by
the on-ramp to a highway. I imagine that
he did rather well. He was cheerful and
friendly, rather articulate, always man
aged to look mostly clean, and was not

really insistent. He just sat there, had a
sign, would often be reading a book. He
had all the qualities we like to see in our
homeless — quiet, cheerful in the face of
adversity, destitute but not desperate.
I harbored the common thought that
food was better than money; they might
be inclined to buy alcohol with money.
So for the most part, when I could, I'd
bring them food. A friend used to give
them money — explaining that he'd had
days when he's felt he could use a good
drink, so he can imagine that they prob
ably need one even more.
One day, there was a young man say
ing good morning to everyone. Ho
wasn't even asking for money, just
greeting everyone cheerfully as they
walked by. No one replied. When I
answered his greeting, he told me that I
was the first person to respond to him
that morning. This upset him, and I
wanted to stop and talk to him, but I was
late for a class which I imagined was
more important than interacting with
this human being. I still wish I'd taken
the time to talk.
I don't have any answers to the question
"What do you do?' All I can do is repeat the
words from the song: 'Think twice."

Pamela Giucns won't be homeless; she's
found an apartment.
