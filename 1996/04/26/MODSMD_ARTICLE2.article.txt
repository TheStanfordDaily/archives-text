# Faculty to examine TA efficiency
## Subcommittee anticipates reviewing multiple issues this summer 
### Tomoeh Murakami 
For the first time in nine years, the
performance of teaching assistants will be
evaluated by a faculty subcommittee, be
ginning summer quarter.
The Committee of Academic Achieve
ment and Appraisal agreed at its last
regular meeting on April 12 to form a
sub-committee to review the "status, ef
fectiveness and training of teaching as
sistants."
This action was proposed by the ASSU

senate at the suggestion of graduate sen
ator Doug Natelson, a former TAin
physics, who felt that TA review was long
overdue.
"The reviewing of TAs is necessary be
cause every department has several TAs
for most of its classes," Natelson said.
The faculty committee is still work
ing on the exact instructions it plans to
give to a subcommittee and will meet
today to discuss the nature of the re
view. The committee will report the re
sults of this meeting to the Academic

Senate on May 16.
"The evaluation process will deal with
comparing the effectiveness of TA train
ing by examining various setups in which
teaching assistants perform," Physics
Prof, and committee chair Mason Yearian
said.
The subcommittee is expected to gath
er data during summer and autumn
quarters, analyze the data, form recom
mendations and report to the full com-
