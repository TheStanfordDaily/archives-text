# Faculty to examine TA efficiency
## Subcommittee anticipates reviewing multiple issues this summer 
### Tomoeh Murakami 
For the first time in nine years, the
performance of teaching assistants will be
evaluated by a faculty subcommittee, be
ginning summer quarter.
The Committee of Academic Achieve
ment and Appraisal agreed at its last
regular meeting on April 12 to form a
sub-committee to review the "status, ef
fectiveness and training of teaching as
sistants."
This action was proposed by the ASSU

senate at the suggestion of graduate sen
ator Doug Natelson, a former TAin
physics, who felt that TA review was long
overdue.
"The reviewing of TAs is necessary be
cause every department has several TAs
for most of its classes," Natelson said.
The faculty committee is still work
ing on the exact instructions it plans to
give to a subcommittee and will meet
today to discuss the nature of the re
view. The committee will report the re
sults of this meeting to the Academic

Senate on May 16.
"The evaluation process will deal with
comparing the effectiveness of TA train
ing by examining various setups in which
teaching assistants perform," Physics
Prof, and committee chair Mason Yearian
said.
The subcommittee is expected to gath
er data during summer and autumn
quarters, analyze the data, form recom
mendations and report to the full com-
mittee by the beginning of spring
quarter 1997. The committee
plans to meet by the middle of the
quarter to discuss the results and
present them tc the Faculty Senate
for action.
On Feb. 20, the ASSU Senate
passed their resolution —CARE-
-2— which urges the faculty to un
dertake a comprehensive review on
the current conditions of TAs.
They presented this bill to the Fac
ulty Senate two days later.
Such a study has not taken place
for nine years and the ASSU senate
thought action was needed to en

sure that the quality and training
of TAs would be discussed and re
viewed regularly.
CARE-2 called for the commit
tee to consider evaluation and re
view regarding TAs, as well as re
porting the result of this initial de
termination by the end of Spring
Quarter 1996. If the committee
agrees to the review, the bill
charges the committee or its sub
committee to undertake the study
and report the results by the end of
Spring Quarter 1997.
The Steering Committee, which
is in charge of assigning the job to
the proper committee, ;ilso believes
that it is the role of the Committee
on Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment or its subcommittee to con
duct this studv, Natelson said.
