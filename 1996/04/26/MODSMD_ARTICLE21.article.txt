# Allison Amend: The better part of valor
## Free to be you and g: an alphabetic celebration 
### 
ABCDEF. . . G. Today's column will
be brought to you by the letter "g."
You've gotta admit, g is pretty
important. You've been using it without
realizing it for years, and I feel that some
thanks ought to go to g for its decades of
service.
G is a part of our history. It was there
when Rome fell, it was watching from the
deck when Darwin beached the BeaGle, it
applauded the siGninG of the Declaration
of Independence. Do you know g's etymol
ogy? It's "a differentiated form of [the let
ter] G."
What other letter can be an exclama
tion? "L-whiz!"? I don't think so. OK,
maybe I, maybe G, definitely O. But still,
g rules.
G is steadfast and true. It was right
there for LeninGrad, and it's still there
for St. PetersburG. Yes, in fact, g is essen
tial to Geography.
I am writing this tome on gin its
defense. It's been getting a bum rap
recently. You, I, we've all been leaving it
off the ends of words. It's fine if you're
gettin' something or goin' somewhere,
but have a little pity, please, on jumpin' or

smashin'; these words have too few g's to
just drop them like hard DRs.
G can be beautiful. It germinates gor
geous and great and good.
G is also expressive, first on your tongue
when things turn sour. It garners garish or
gossamer gists. Garrulous grousers grum
ble at its gushing gentility, for we all
understand and respect the power of g.
G is versatile. It is one of the few letters
that changes form when capitalized. It
swells with pride at its place first in line.
It changes sound, it adapts to new situa
tions; g can be "guh" or "juh" or silent.
With the increased noise level of our
cacophonous world, I appreciate g's taci
turn support of such words as "gnome" or
"night."
G is holy, or haven't you heard? It
occupies the privileged space of seventh
letter in the English alphabet. Basically,
whoever created the alphabet struggled
through two vowels and a mouth full of
consonants. G came to him / her in a
dream of tranquility; she/he curled up
into it like it was a cradle and rested.
Some may call g ungainly or gratuitous.
I've heard it criticized for being obese or

confused — that whole straight / curved
dichotomy can be a little shocking, admit
tedly— but isn't that part of g's charm?
G is a movie everyone loves. G is a pow
erful unit of force equal to the gravity
exerted on a body at rest. G is the reason
your feet touch the ground. What's more
important than that?
I sing the praises of g. G is the fifth
note of the diatonic scale of C major. It
has an entire clef named after it. It is the
inspiration for countless compositions,
including the title role of "Minuet in G."
It is the key of Mozart's "Symphony
Number 40" — you know, the one that
goes buh-duh-duh-buh-duh-dum. Grover
of "Sesame Street" once composed a
whole song that took as its theme the let
ter g. I really dig g.
I heard a radio commercial the other
day, campaigning for the removal of g
from the word "light." The announcer
couldn't face the prospect of a superfluous
letter. What has happened to our toler
ance in this country? It is a dangerous pas
time to remove letters from words. Why
are certain letters ghettoized and picked
on? Who is to judge where we stop? I am

see the removal of letters from words
turning into the destruction of entire sen
tences that "aren't up to snuff." And why
stop there? Our society might become
entirely aphasic in less time than it takes
to log onto PINE. OK, bad analogy. .. in
less time than it takes to play a Nirvana
song on a modern rock radio station.
Nor should we, (as the radio commer
cial suggested, before launching into the
acoustic version of "All Apologies")
emphasize those letters. "Light" should
not be pronounced "lie-guh-hut." We
should treasure and respect g's silent
capabilities; we should learn from its qui
escent wisdom. (The copious amounts of
negative mail I receive seems to suggest
that I, too, should follow g's example). By
drawing attention to g, we embarrass it.
I'll stop here, before embarking on the
larger point of the column, because the
point may indeed be that there is no larg
er point. The gestalt of g's genius is that it
is just g, no more, no less. I could ramble
on about how we need to pay more atten
tion to detail. I could provide the Marxist
reading of the alphabet and talk about g
as the proletariat and the formation of

words and narrative as the fetishism of
commodities.
I could regale you with more allitera
tion, obscure references to past authors
obsessed with certain letters (e.g. Kurt
Schwitters, whose anthem: "i: up, down,
up, little dot on top" became the slogan
for the Alphabetics, a heretical revolu
tionary movement in post-war Ger
many— just kidding). I could make paral
lels with g as a special interest gl*oup, or a
minority section of our society, and trace
the history of that minority group
through g's usage.
I could even make references to
other uses of g, most specifically as a pre
fix to certain words which you are all
thinking, even though this is a family
newspaper.
But I won't. G wouldn't want me to. I've
called your attention to g now, and that's
all I want to do. Like g, I am humble; I will
make only a small difference. I hope we can
all agree that g is a necessary, important
letter. Almost as important as 112. ..
