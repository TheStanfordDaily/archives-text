## On the brink Water polo eyes postseason invite 
### Erin Bryla Contributing writer 
As the inaugural season of
women's water polo enters post
season play, Stanford is right
where it wants to be. The squad
is ranked No. 4 in the nation and
has a chance to gain a berth in
the national tournament this
weekend in the West Coast qual
ifier.
Stanford will open the tourna
ment today against UC-Davis, a
team that it has beaten six times
already this season including a
dominant 5-3 win last weekend.
This means little though, as the
games between the Aggies and
the Cardinal are always close and
never lack excitement. Davis has
also beaten California six times,
a team Stanford has struggled
against all season.
The Cardinal will then face
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, which
should not give the Cardinal
trouble, as the Mustangs have
not been ranked in the top five all
season.
Stanford, Cal and Cal Poly-
SLO make up one of the four
brackets in the tournament. A
total of 12 teams will participate,
and the top six finishers, besides
UCD, will advance to the nation
al tournament (Davis receives an
automatic bid because it is host
ing the qualifier). These squads
will be joined at nationals by two
teams from the Midwestern
qualifier and three teams from
the Eastern qualifier.
Women's water polo, al
though a varsity sport at Stan
ford, is yet to have enough teams
to be an NCAA-sanctioned sport.
A new sport needs 20 teams to vie
for an NCAA crown, and
women's water polo falls two

short. Despite this, there is still a
national title to be won, NCAA
sanctioned or not.
"We need to step up to the
teams that have beaten us all
season and beat them for a
change," said freshman Lindsay
Welsh. "We are definitely capa
ble of beating them."
If the Cardinal wins its brack
et or places second, Stanford will
advance to the round of eight on
Saturday morning. The semifi
nals follow in the afternoon, and
the finals occur the following
morning. The Cardinal will most
likely meet USC in the quarterfi
nals and No. 1 UCLA in the semi
finals.
It is the bears from across the
bay, though, that the cardinal
would like to meet. Stanford has
yet to beat them this season, and
nothing would be better for the
cardinal than to top them in post
season play. This enthusiasm ex
ists even though both teams will
likely advance regardless of the
outcome.
"We would like to meet Cal to
have a chance to beat them," said
head coach Ben Quittner.
The Cardinal will be counting
on the people that have produced
for the team all season.
"I am looking to Alice Cath
cart's shooting," Quittner said.
"I am looking to Olivia White and
Lindsay Welsh on the counters
and to Lindsay Tarn."
The Cardinal will also be ex
pecting strong play out of fresh
man goalkeeper Heather Crary,
who has been outstanding all
year. Stanford knows the season
could end without success this
weekend.
"If we don't do well, we don't
go to collegiate nationals," Welsh
said.
