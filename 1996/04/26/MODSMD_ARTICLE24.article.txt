## Gymnasts advance to team finals as Wiley finishes second in all-around 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
Stanford men's gymnastics pulled
out a first-place finish last night in the
qualifying round of the NCAA champi
onships, racking up its best score ever, a
231.150. The performance allowed
them to narrowly defeat second-place
California (231.000) for the first time
this year.
The margin between second and
third place was even closer than the gap
separating first and second. Ohio State
came in third with a combined team
score of 230.875. Following OSU was
lowa with a 230.525, Oklahoma with
228.200 and Penn State with a 224.600.
The top three of the six teams advance
to the NCAA Championships, to be held
tonight at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
"A month or two ago no one thought
Stanford would even qualify for the
NCAA championships, and here we are
standing in the top spot," said Stanford
head coach Sadao Hamada.
Stanford outdid itself, excelling in al
most every event. Junior Keith Wiley
took second place in the all-around com
petition with a 57.850, despite his lack
of focus on attaining that goal; Ohio
State's Blaine Wilson finished first with
a 58.625. The strong showing earned
Wiley the rank of All-American. Wiley
had said previously that he was primar
ily concerned about performing well to
help the team, not to garner individual
honors.
"There are still some mistakes I have
to clean up for tomorrow, because we're
really close to Berkeley and I think it's
going to be close tomorrow," Wiley said.
Additionally, junior lan Bachrach
scored the top mark in two events, the
floor exercise (9.875) and the vault
(9.700). Bachrach is the defending
NCAA champion on the vault.
The gymnasts began the night on the
parallel bars, previously a weak event,
and performed well — junior Jaime Ellis

hit a solid routine good for a 9.700.
"We started on the parallel bars and
didn't look back," said sophomore
Clarence Miao.
From the parallel bars, the Cardinal
moved on to the high bar, their best
event of the night. The team averaged
9.712 on that event. Both junior lan
Bachrach and senior Peter Hegi
matched their top scores of the year —
9.800.
In the third event, the floor exercise,
Bachrach tied with Oklahoma junior
Casey Bryan for the highest score,
9.875. The floor exercise is Bachrach's
self-proclaimed best event and his previ
ous high in the floor was a mere 9.800.
Wiley scored a season-high 9.850 in
the fourth event for the Cardinal, the
pommel horse. Sophomore Jeremy Her
man also nailed his pommel horse rou
tine for a 9.775.
The final two events were lower scor
ing events, but Stanford still managed
to hold on to their lead. The team aver
aged a 9.275 in the event. And in the
final event, the vault, Stanford received
a stellar performance from Bachrach.
His score of 9.700 tied Ohio State's
Blaine Wilson for the highest score.
"I'm very proud of how I did and how
we did as a team," Bachrach said. "I'm
absolutely on a high. I am really excited
to be able to compete against the home
crowd."
The home crowd included the entire
Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, which came
to cheer Bachrach on. Ironically, Cali
fornia also regarded Maples as their
"home."
The Golden Bears brought a large
and loud entourage to the competition
and California gymnast junior David
Kruse said that he was able to "feed off
the home crowd." California is appear
ing in the final round for the first time
since 1982. Additionally, according to
Hamada, this is the first year that two
