# Baseball to greet UCLA
## Beans, suspensions disrupt Bruins 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
When the lights were installed at Stan
ford's Sunken Diamond, the baseball pro
gram hoped to draw more local fans to
night games and boost student attendance
as well. The lights also made Sunken Dia
mond a possible host site for the NCAA
Regional Tournament.
The chance to host the West Regional is
partially at stake this weekend as the No.
15 Cardinal (28-17, 13-11 in the Paciflc
-10 Southern Division) heads into a critical
series with No. 13 UCLA (25-17, 16-8 in
the Six-Pac). Stanford trails the second
place Bruins by three games in the confer
ence standings.
"This is our biggest series to date," said
sophomore right fielder Joe Kilburg. "A
sweep puts us tied for second, and actual
ly a half-game up since we (will) have won
4-of-6 against them."
Tonight's opener will be played under
the lights at 7 p.m., with matinees the
next two days beginning at 1 p.m.
While USC stands a comfortable four
games ahead of UCLA in the Six-Pac and
looks to wrap up the league title, the Car
dinal still covets the second-place spot.
"There is a tremendous difference be
tween second and third place," Kilburg

said. "If we're second, we will have a
chance to host a regional, but if we're
third, it will he a lot harder to have the re
gional here."
In the conference opener for both
teams earlier this year, the Bruins took
the series from Stanford, two games to
one. UCLA ace Jim Parque (8-0) threw
eight innings and struck out nine Cardi
nal batters in UCLA's series-opening 6-5
win. The Cardinal triumphed 9-1 in the
next contest, behind freshman Jeff
Austin, who struck out 13 Bruins in a
complete-game performance. Sunday's
rubber game was won by UCLA 7-5, as
Pete Zamora picked up the victory.
This weekend, Stanford will not have to
face Zamora (5-0), who has been penal
ized, along with Bruins coach Gary
Adams, for their roles in an incident dur
ing the Arizona State-UCLA game last
Sunday.
In that contest, Adams directed Zamo
ra to intentionally pitch at an opposing
batter. Adams then imposed on himself a
suspension which Pac-10 Commissioner
Tom Hansen accepted. The suspension
will last through this weekend and keep
Adams from being present at Sunken Dia
mond for any of this weekend's contests.

hottest Cardinal hitter, scoops up a grounder.
Zamora will serve a four
game, conference-imposed sus
pension which will keep him off
the mound this weekend.
"Not having their coach will
not make a big difference," Kil
burg said. "It may affect a few
managerial decisions, but not
having one of their starting
pitchers may have more of an
impact. Zamora is another left
handed arm they won't have this
weekend."
Stanford enters the series
with a five-game winning streak
after a narrow victory over
Sacramento State, a series
sweep of Arizona and Tuesday
night's 11-0 triumph over San
Jose State.
Consistent pitching and hot
hitting have been strengths for
the Cardinal throughout its re
cent success. Tonight's starter,
sophomore Kyle Peterson (6-5,

4.44 ERA), has won four of his
last five starts with the lone loss
coming against USC. Senior
Brian Dallimore (13 hits in last
four games), junior Luke
Quaccia (.383) and Kilburg
(.371, career-high 34 RBI) have
swung the bat well recently, as
has senior All-American catcher
A.J. Hinch, the Six-Pac's
fourth-best hitter at .386. Hinch
leads Stanford in home runs
(nine) and RBI (40) and will rep
resent the United States at the
Olympic Games this summer in
Atlanta.
Since being swept by USC for
the third consecutive time (and
second this season) two weeks
ago, the team feels confident
about its 12 remaining games,
especially with 11 at home.
"We're starting to play well
again," Kilburg said. "Wo need
to continue to play well and take
some momentum into the re
gionals. UCLA is definitely a
team we don't like losing to -
we're going to come out this
weekend with guns blazing."
