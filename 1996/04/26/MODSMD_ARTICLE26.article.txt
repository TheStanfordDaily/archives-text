With next week's Pacific 10 Conference
Championships looming large, the Stanford
men's golfers make one last regular season stop
at the Cougar Classic in Provo, Utah this week
end. For the 17th-ranked Cardinal, the tourna
ment should provide an opportunity for any
last-minute fine-tuning needed to make a run
at repeating the postseason success of years
past.
"It's a great warm-up for the Pac-lOs," said
head coach Wally Goodwin. "I brought another
squad here five or six years ago and it proved to
be a good experience."
While the team won't see any conference ri
vals at Provo, the field will be heavy with dis
trict rivals. New Mexico, Fresno State and host
school Brigham Young, all opponents that will
be faced again at Regionals in mid-May, top the
field.
"It's good to get a look at these teams again,"
Goodwin said. "We've played them several
times this year and I think we've shown our
selves capable of beating any of them.
"We will be fighting to win, but I think the
main focus will be on just playing under control
and playing every round to prep for the next,
just trying to really set our game."
One settling factor should be the return of
sophomore All-American Tiger Woods to the

starting lineup after a brief
leave of absence to compete in
the Masters.
"Everybody plays as well as
they can, so really, whether
Tiger is here shouldn't affect
anyone's individual play," Good
win said. "But as far as the team
goes, you can always use the
kind of contribution he brings to
the table."
Another major step towards
the goal of stability has been the
solidification of a starting line
up for the Cardinal. After a year
of tinkering with the lineup at
the four and five spots, Goodwin
seems to finally have settled on
junior Conrad Ray and sopho
more Eri Crum to round out the
starting quintet. Because of the
six-count-four format at the
Pac-lOs, with the four best
scores out of six rounds going to
wards the final tally, senior

David Garcia will also join the
squad for the trip to Provo after
emerging last week in team
qualifiers.
"I'm really pleased with the
way these guys have come
along," Goodwin said. "If one of
the three can shoot in the low- to
mid-70s in a given round, we
should be really tough."
With the second half of the
squad finally falling into line
with a solid top three featuring
Woods, freshman sensation Joel
Kribel and senior captain Jerry
Chang, this Cardinal team fea
tures an arsenal which should
make many top programs ner
vous.
"I feel better about the team
at this point than I have all
year," Goodwin said. "We are in
our best position to play compet
itively. Our attitude and concen
tration, our approach to the
game, it's all falling into place.
"We've worked hard and pre
pared a lot mentally, and hope
fully it will pay off and we can be
productive."
