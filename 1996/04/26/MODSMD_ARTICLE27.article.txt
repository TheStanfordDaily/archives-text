# Stanford journeys to 'lacrosse capital'
## 
### Solveig Pederson Staff writer 
This weekend the Stanford
women's lacrosse team tops off
its first season in NCAA Divi
sion I with a trip east to Mary
land, one of the nation's fore
most lacrosse states.
The Cardinal (8-11 overall, 2-
6 Division I) play Shippensburg,
Mount St. Mary's and Ohio
State over the weekend in Em
mitsburg.
In previous action, Stanford
took second place in the Western
States tournament two week
ends ago. With the intervening
practice time to enhance its
strengths, the team is ready to
improve its record to a .500 per
centage.
"We're going to practice hard
and hope to finish on a positive
note," head coach Kay Cow
perthwait said.
First up is Shippensburg, a
Pennsylvania team which will
be Stanford's toughest competi
tor of the group, according to
Cowperthwait.
While Shippensburg is an es
tablished Division II team, both
Mount St. Mary's and Ohio

State are new Division I pro
grams, like Stanford. But in past
years, Stanford has not had the
competition against Eastern
teams which these squads have
enjoyed.
In only its second year of var
sity play, the Cardinal is break
ing ground as the first varsity
Division I school on the West
Coast. Last season, the Cardinal
nabbed first place in the West
ern Women's Lacrosse League
Final Four.
Fluctuating levels of intensi
ty have proven to be an Achilles'
heel for the young Cardinal
team over this season. But Stan
ford can continue the progress
made during the five games of
its previous Eastern trip over
spring break.
"I think this team needs to
pull together," said co-captain
Peppie Stephenson. "We can win
our next few games.
"It's great to be ending in
Maryland. It shows us where we
came from. [We have gone] from
playing on Roble Field and prac
ticing three times a week to
playing three games in Mary
land, which is virtually the
lacrosse capital of the country."
