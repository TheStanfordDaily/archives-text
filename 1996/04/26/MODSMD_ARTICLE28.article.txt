# Softball hopes 'Zonas desert winning ways
## 
### Robin Davidson Staff writer 
The Stanford softball team is
set to take on the Arizona
schools in Pacific 10 Conference
competition this weekend. The
Cardinal (23-20 overall, 6-10 in
the Pac-10) will face the Sun
Devils of Arizona State tomor
row and then meet the Arizona
Wildcats on Sunday. Both games
are scheduled to begin at 1 p.m.
at Twin Creeks in Sunnyvale.
This marks the second meet
ing between Stanford and the
Arizonas and is a great opportu
nity for the Cardinal to move to
.500 in the Pac-10. Earlier this
season Stanford defeated the
Sun Devils in a doubleheader 3-1
and 1-0 but lost two games to the
Wildcats 10-3 and 5-0.
"These are huge games for
us," said head coach Sandy
Pearce. "We swept ASU down
there and we're capable of [win
ning], but we need to put more

runs up fthan in our last few
games]."
Run production has been a
problem for the Cardinal recent
ly. Stanford scored just four
runs in their last two contests.
The Cardinal split with Oregon
State last weekend, winning
game one 4-0 and losing game
two 1-0.
"In the Pac-10 it always
comes down to hitting," Pearce
said. "We have to put more than
four runs on the board."
Stanford needs to win at least
three of the four games this
weekend to remain in contention
for a postseason berth, and the
team feels confident that it can
do just that.
"We've already beaten Ari
zona State twice," said sopho
more outfielder Becky Unruh.
"We know we can beat them
again. Arizona is beatable too.
We just have to be at the top of
our game.
In the last matchup between
the Cardinal and the Wildcats,
Stanford made six errors in two
games and only managed three
runs in the contests. Injuries
have plagued the Cardinal lately,
but freshman hurler Becky
Blevins will likely make her first
appearance at the mound in two
weeks. Blevins, who recently
suffered a sprained ankle and
has missed four games, is the
Cardinal's leading pitcher and is
expected to make at least one
start in this weekend's four
games.
Stanford fared much better
against the Sun Devils when it
journeyed to the desert. The
Cardinal defeated ASU in both
games of a doubleheader late last
month, but once again had diffi
culty scoring runs. The Cardinal
managed 14 hits in the two
games but only crossed home
four times in winning the two
games.
Freshman outfielder Kelly
Yablonski led the way at the
plate in those games. She was 3-
for-6 against the Sun Devils with
the Cardinal's only RBI in the 1-

0 victory. Junior third baseman
Amanda Renteria also powered
Stanford's drive. Renteria
scored two runs and an RBI in
the opener.
Pitching will be another im
portant aspect for the Cardinal.
In order to defeat former-No. 1
Arizona, Stanford will have to
focus on keeping the Wildcat of
fense off its game. Arizona
racked up 21 hits against the
Cardinal in their last matchup,
but the Stanford pitching staff is
prepared for the task at hand.
"We've worked really hard on
working different batters at
practice," said sophomore pitch
er Jessica Schulman. "We just
need to outsmart them and hit
our spots with different pitch
es."
This weekend's games may be
the most important the Cardinal
has yet faced. With the season
winding down, each game be
comes more pivotal. Stanford is
hoping to gain the first postsea
son berth in the program's four
year history, and ASU may be
the easiest opponent left on the
Cardinal's schedule.
"Since we lost one game last
weekend, this weekend's games
are even more important,"
Schulman said. "We need to win
in order to stay alive in our hopes
for the postseason."
