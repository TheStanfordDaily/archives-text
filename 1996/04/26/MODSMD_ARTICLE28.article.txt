The Stanford softball team is
set to take on the Arizona
schools in Pacific 10 Conference
competition this weekend. The
Cardinal (23-20 overall, 6-10 in
the Pac-10) will face the Sun

runs in their last two contests.
The Cardinal split with Oregon
State last weekend, winning
game one 4-0 and losing game
two 1-0.
"In the Pac-10 it always

said. "We have to put more than
four runs on the board."
Stanford needs to win at least
three of the four games this
weekend to remain in contention
for a postseason berth, and the
team feels confident that it can
do just that.
"We've already beaten Ari
zona State twice," said sopho
more outfielder Becky Unruh.
"We know we can beat them
again. Arizona is beatable too.
We just have to be at the top of
