# Professor talks population on TV
## 
### Alex Scherbakovsky Contributing writer 
Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich, author of
the controversial book, "The Population
Bomb," will once again find himself in
the national spotlight when a PBS televi
sion special, "Paul Ehrlich and the Popu
lation Bomb," airs tomorrow night.
The program will concentrate on
Ehrlich's first book, "The Population
Bomb," which came out in 1968 and pre
dicted grave consequences of humanity's

high birth rates and environmental
abuse.
In a recent article in The New York
Times, Ehrlich said, "I do believe doom is
coming," a statement he made to Johnny
Carson on "The Tonight Show" two
decades ago.
Although Ehrlich remains steadfast
in his beliefs that urgent action is neces
sary to prevent the doubling of the
earth's population by the year 2050, he
has conceded the results cannot be
achieved by coercion or legally mandated

birth limits.
As expressed in his new book, "The
Stork and the Plow," Ehrlich now sup
ports devoting more resources to educat
ing people about family planning and
birth control.
Anne Ehrlich, senior research associ
ate and Ehrlich's wife, said she agrees
with voluntary measures of birth control.
"We support government-subsidized
sterilization for people who do not want
to have any more children," Anne
Ehrlich said.
While stressing the necessity of

sex education programs and family
planning programs to fight popu
lation growth, Anne Ehrlich em
phasized that population growth is
"a global problem."
According to Ehrlich, the
overpopulation problem will be
solved if couples have an average

of 1.5 children. Such results are
difficult to achieve in developing
countries, where high infant
mortality rates encourage fami
lies to have many children, Anne
Ehrlich said.
"Making available contracep
tives and medical advice for people

will limit the size of families," she
said.
Ehrlich also said U.S.-funded
programs that supply underdevel
oped countries with birth control
are vital and must be continued if
population growth is to be con
trolled.
