Authentic Italian pizzas and candlelit
rooms will grace the campus again when the
Italian theme house Casa Italiana re-opens its
long-absent pizzeria on May 11.
1 he pizzeria, which has been closed this
year due to a lack of management, will resume
business and continue throughout the rest of
spring quarter.
Sophomore Tiffany Griego, who recently
assumed the role of pizzeria manager, said she
is looking forward to the re-opening. "It has
been a long-standing tradition," she said.
The pizzeria will be open Saturday
evenings, from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Ten to 12 stu
dents will work per shift, either setting up for
service, cooking, serving food or hosting.
Griego said that organizing the pizzeria has
been a "pretty laborious job."

According to Griego, the pizzeria will be a
place to enjoy a full dining experience.
"Students can have something to drink,
maybe have some salad and bread sticks and
then order whatever kind of pizza they like,"
Griego said.
Senior Lynn McPhee, Casa Italiana's
theme assistant, said customers can choose
from a selection of authentic Italian pizzas,
with specials such as the 4-cheese pizza and
the Napolitano pizza, an artichoke-covered
pizza. Prices will range from $5 to $8.
The pizzeria would be the perfect place to
take a date, McPhee said. "There is great at
mosphere in the pizzeria. There are candles on
the tables, and we dim the lights," she said.
The pizzeria was started seven years ago by
the Italian department faculty. They created it
because they wanted to promote Italian cul
tural awareness and earn money for the

house.
For three years, Italian transfer students
ran the pizzeria, McPhee said. McPhee ex
plained that the eatery gave the transfers an
opportunity to "show off their skills and meet
other people." However, for the past four
years, the pizzeria has been run by students
who live in the house.
This year the pizzeria was left without a
manager when former manager, John Silva, a
fifth-year senior, graduated early and left
Stanford during winter quarter. After Griego
volunteered to be the manager, it could re
open.
When Griego became manager, she already
had trained student workers. The re-opening
has involved the help of many Casa Italiana
residents. "It's been a huge combined effort,"
Griego said.
"It's like a familv restaurant," McPhee said.
