A group of kid writers and
editors from The Daily almost
led today's issue with a story
claiming Polio's had pulled out
of its deal to open in Tresidder
Union.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
called News Editors-for-a-day
Sarah Cameron and Adam Ke
mezis, telling them that the
Polio's bargain was scrapped.
Cameron and Kemezis some
how believed him.
"You won't believe the story
that just came in," an excited
Cameron told a group of Daily
editors vacationing at current
Editor in Chief Burt Herman's
Santa Cruz dacha.
But, as with the rest of the
annual New Staffers' Night an
tics, Wais' claims were a hoax.
"I can't believe they're so
fuckin' gullible," Herman said.
"They thought they were in

control, but in reality they
couldn't control shit."
In addition to the Wais call,
so beautifully engineered by
Jesse Oxfeld, The Daily's resi
dence dean and also an opinions
editor, the kids coped with a fax
from Bursar Jon Erickson
about lost records of student
payments and a mysterious fax
claiming the Food Research In
stitute had been revived.
To complicate it all, the chil
dren were treated to continuous
repeat performances of Alanis
Morrisette's "You Oughtta
Know" blaring through a speak
er and The Daily's phone sys
tem ad nauseam.
The Daily's phone lines were
switched, its computers frozen
and the chairless office reorga
nized beyond recognition.
Calling the above antics "ha
rassment," Kemezis tried to do
something with shaving cream.
No one, however, could confirm
exactlv what the hell it was.
