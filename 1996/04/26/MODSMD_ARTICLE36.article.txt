"I'm in the mood for a good protest. "
— Gandhi
Burma's over. Been there, done that. The
grape thing's gone. Been there, done
that. And the thought-provoking, intel
lectually stimulating ASSU debate over that
Constipation '96 thingy is over and done with.
So now what do we do?
I say we get together and have ourselves a
protest.
It doesn't really matter what we decide
to protest about, as long as we do it loudly.
We could protest against something that
everyone is against (genocide, perhaps), or
we could protest for something that every
one wants (say, happiness and true love).
We could protest against something we like,
or for something we hate. We could protest
in White Plaza, in the Quad, at Congress,
on my parents' front lawn. We could protest
protesters.
Protesting is our right as Stanford students
to tell the Powers That Be that we are just not
going to take it anymore.
Let's protest Polio's, shall we?
The first thing we need to do on our Anti-
Polio campaign is to brainstorm a few cool
acronyms for our group. How about SNAP
i Students Negative About Polio's)? Or
GROPE (Get Rid Of Polio's. Everyone!)?
What about PAPSMEAR (People Against
Polio's: Stanford Masses Everywhere Against
Restaurants)? It doesn't really matter what
we call ourselves — if it's a catchy name, peo
ple will pay attention to our pleas.
Next, we (as PAPSMEAR) have to get
together and make "petitions." Petitions are
long pieces of paper that any idiot will sign if
you accost them as they are on their way into
Flicks. The purpose of a petition is to get a
million billion names onto pieces of paper and

then pile them up on the President's desk.
This way, he can't get anything done because
of all the pieces of paper in his office. Eventu
ally, he will give in to our demands if we
promise to go back to his office to pick up all
the petitions and recycle them.
The next thing for PAPSMEAR to remem
ber to do is to make lots and lots of signs. If we
don 't make signs, no one will know what we
are protesting about. And that would make
the whole process much more difficult. Signs
should be painted on cardboard and stapled to
long pieces of wood that look like they are
pickets from fences. That's why they call it
"protesting."
PAPSMEAR also needs to make up a few
snazzy chants that rhyme. Studies show that
rhyming makes protesting 35 percent more
effective than free-verse protests. It's the
same reason that the youth of America today
would rather listen to L.L. Cool J than Gand
hi. It's all in the rhyming. A few suggestions:
"I'd rather eat a Fro Vo, then eat at Polio's!"
or "Polio's sucks, 1 like to drive trucks!"
Either of these will suffice.
We then must come up with a list of
demands. I ve started a list. Here goes: No
Polio's in Tresidder; the formation of a Polio's
Action Committee; $10 million in unmarked
hills; the release of political prisoners held in
the jungle republic of Lugar; a loaf of bread, a
container of milk and a stick of butter; a heli
copter; all six Constructions (in order to make
Devastator); world peace; and absolutely no
more Bruce Willis movies at Flicks.
I suppose that the last thing that
PAPSMEAR might want to do is find a pur
pose. Although not compulsory, it is often a
good idea to have a few answers floating
around in the noggin when non-believers ask.
"Why?" I've compiled a few of my own per
sonal gripes with Polio's below. If you have

more, and I'm sure you do, bring 'em up at
the first PAPSMEAR organizational meeting
next Monday night. My reasons are:
• I don't really like Polio's that much. It's
OK, I guess, hut not great.
• Polio's is just too Stanford ("Let's go to
the Co Ho or Co Po or Po Yo's.")
• Polio's doesn't have a drive-thru What's
Sure Escort gonna do?
• Other restaurants read like they're
spelled. Where the hell is the "y" in Polio's?
• Polio's doesn't invest that much, and
when they do. they invest in sissy countries
like the Ifnited States.
• 1 once had a hurrito at Polio's, and the
next day I got a cold.
• "Polio's" is a Spanish word. This is Amer
ica. buddy. We speak English here. I'd rather
have an American name like "Taco Bell." Sure,
"taco" is Spanish, but "bell" certainly ain't
and there's nothing you can say about that!
So, troops, are you ready to go? Stanford
hasn't had itself a protest in weeks and
PAPSMEAR has the passion to pull it off.
Petitions, signs, chants, demands — you
name it, PAPSMEAR is prepared. We can't
let the Man tell us who we are or who we're
going to be! We can't sit back and watch our
world destroyed bv burritos in Tresidder!
Fight! Fight with everything you've got!
These are the days to remember! Death
before Polio's!
Vive hi resistance!
