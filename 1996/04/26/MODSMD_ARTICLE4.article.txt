Children will be in the spotlight
tomorrow at the You Can Make A
Difference Conference, held annu
ally by the Haas Center for Public
Service.
The conference, titled "Whole
Children, Broken Lives: Piecing
Together a Better Future for Our
Kids," will be held from 9 a.m. to 4
p.m. at Campbell Recital Hall in
Braun Music Center and at the
Law School.
Organizers of the conference
hope it will not only provide an ed
ucational forum for discussion, but
also offer a more comprehensive
approach to children's issues.
"The vision for this year's con
ference is to view children as
whole children instead of viewing
each separate part of their lives in
isolation," said sophomore Biren
Modi, co-director of the YCMAD
conference planning committee.
"Often we look at children based
on academic, extracurricular, med
ical, educational [issues]," Modi
said. "We want to look at that all to
gether and how the separate as
pects of their lives are interrelat
ed."
Emily Behr, co-chair of the
event, said the trend among service
industries today is to approach
children's issues from a more com

prehensive standpoint.
"People realize now that you
can't just work with one aspect of a
child's life and expect everything
else to take care of itself," Behr
said.
The two speakers this year are
Bill Abrams, a child advocacy
lawyer in San Francisco and in
structor in the Children and Soci
ety curriculum at Stanford, and
Tony Massengale, who works with
community organization and child
development in Los Angeles.
The conference will also in
clude two workshop sessions, and
an activity called "Conceptualiz
ing the Child." The workshop ses
sions, which will be held in the
morningand in the afternoon, will
include topics such as child cul
ture, children and the law, media
conceptions, multicultural and
bilingual education and careers
with kids.
"We've really tailored it a lot to
the students coming to the confer
ence this year," said Behr, adding
that the workshops have been
planned with a student audience in
mind.
The event is free to Stanford
students. Lunch will be provided
upon pre-registration with the
YCMAD office. Registration and
check-in on Saturday begins at 9
a.m. at the Haas Center for Public
Service.
