Delivering his third annual State of the
School address yesterday afternoon, Dean of
the School of 1 lumanities and Sciences John
Shoven discussed the school's personnel
changes, financial situation and major initia
tives.
Unexpectedly, Shoven announced that a
new, endowed professorship will soon grace
the school through fund money solicited by
University President Gerhard Casper and
Provost Condoleezza Rice.
Shoven said it was his intention that the
chair initially reside in the Philosophy De
partment.
He also took the opportunity to bid
farewell to those leaving positions of acade
mic leadership within the school, including
Assoc. Dean for Natural Sciences David Sieg
mund. Chemistry Prof. Hans Andersen was
named to replace Siegmund.
Shoven also detailed the financial trou
bles the school faces.
"Last year when faced with a large bud
getary gap, we had no choice but to make dif
ficult cuts in the support of staff', graduate
students and faculty," Shoven said. Nearly

90 percent of the school's
annual budget is allocated
to human resources.
Shoven came under Fire
this year when, in response
to budgetary shortfalls, he
decided to cut back on the
number of teaching assist
antships offered to fifth
and sixth-year graduate
students.

Although he defended the choice, which
resulted in a 10 percent increase in the
school's average section size, Shoven
promised to avoid further TA cutbacks in
next year's fiscal planning.
"I would emphasize two points," Shoven
said. "First, there were no painless remedies
to last year's budget dilemma and second,
this year's cuts will be substantially small
erâ€”and we will exempt the teaching assis
tant money from any cuts that are neces
sary."
The promise, however, was accompanied
by a stern reminder that the school's fiscal
worries were not over.
