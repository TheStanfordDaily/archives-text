# Dean looks at future of H&S departments
## Shoven names faculty and committee members 
### Patrick Bernhardt 
Delivering his third annual State of the
School address yesterday afternoon, Dean of
the School of 1 lumanities and Sciences John
Shoven discussed the school's personnel
changes, financial situation and major initia
tives.
Unexpectedly, Shoven announced that a
new, endowed professorship will soon grace
the school through fund money solicited by
University President Gerhard Casper and
Provost Condoleezza Rice.
Shoven said it was his intention that the
chair initially reside in the Philosophy De
partment.
He also took the opportunity to bid
farewell to those leaving positions of acade
mic leadership within the school, including
Assoc. Dean for Natural Sciences David Sieg
mund. Chemistry Prof. Hans Andersen was
named to replace Siegmund.
Shoven also detailed the financial trou
bles the school faces.
"Last year when faced with a large bud
getary gap, we had no choice but to make dif
ficult cuts in the support of staff', graduate
students and faculty," Shoven said. Nearly

90 percent of the school's
annual budget is allocated
to human resources.
Shoven came under Fire
this year when, in response
to budgetary shortfalls, he
decided to cut back on the
number of teaching assist
antships offered to fifth
and sixth-year graduate
students.

Although he defended the choice, which
resulted in a 10 percent increase in the
school's average section size, Shoven
promised to avoid further TA cutbacks in
next year's fiscal planning.
"I would emphasize two points," Shoven
said. "First, there were no painless remedies
to last year's budget dilemma and second,
this year's cuts will be substantially small
er—and we will exempt the teaching assis
tant money from any cuts that are neces
sary."
The promise, however, was accompanied
by a stern reminder that the school's fiscal
worries were not over.


Shoven
"There is tremendous competi
tion for the best students, the
strongest faculty and research sup
port," Shoven said. "This clearly
has major implications for our
long-run budgetary situation. If we
are going to maintain and
strengthen our position as a leader
in the world of higher education,
we have no choice but to continual
ly improve the quality of our educa
tion, to offer highly competitive
packages, and to seek efficiencies in
everything we do," Shoven said.
Shoven highlighted the upcom
ing facility improvements.
"After six longyears [the foreign
language departments] will vacate
the Wilbur Trailers and Encina
Hall this summer and reclaim the
Language Corner," Shoven said.
"During the summer we'll see the
demolition of Sequoia Hall, AEL,
and ERL and groundbreaking for
the new Statistics Building and Re
gional Teaching Facility."
"In June, general construction

will begin on the $32 million reno
vation and expansion of the Stan
ford Museum of Art.. .which will
be completed in the fall of 1998," he
added.
Shoven also addressed a compo
sitional change in the school's Ap
pointment and Promotions Com
mittee. Economics Prof. Timothy
Bresnahan, English Prof. Terry
Castle and Physics Prof. Steve Chu
will step down from the six person
panel, having completed their re
quired terms.
They will be replaced by Cer
man Studies Prof. Russell Berman,
Economics Prof. Cavin Wright and
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare.
The new Appointment and Pro
motions Committee will have to
deal with declining yields for mi
nority faculty.
"Early projections indicate that
new appointments of women facul
ty will be nearly comparable to that
of the last two years," Shoven said.
"Unfortunately, it looks as though
we'll be losing some ground in the
appointment of minority faculty."
Shoven also unveiled plans to
submit the school to review by ex
ternal visiting committees.
