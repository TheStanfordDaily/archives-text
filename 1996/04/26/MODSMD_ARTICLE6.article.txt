## Call for new machines draws co-op complaints 
### Therese Lee 
An administrative decision calling for the
replacement of Hainmarskjold House's
washer and dryer with coin-operated ma
chines has become a source of conflict for the
international theme co-op.
In an effort to adhere to a current con
tract the University has with Reliable Laun
dry, the Office of Housing and Dining passed
th is decision down earlier this year. The con
tract calls for every student residence to
have Reliable machines, according to Man
ager of Undergraduate Residence Facilities
Diana Conklin.
The laundry machines in the house suf
fered many problems last summer. Repeat
ed complaints and service calls made by con
ferees staying there brought the issue of un
reliable, non-standard laundry facilities to
the attention of the Housing facilities.
"As with any system-like service, we get
the best possible price based on volume in
the business," said Conklin. "As we speak,
Reliable is in fact working on a card-reading
system, where students can just use their ID
card. Reliable is developing that system for

us as part of the deal."
In protest, residents of Hammarskjold
cite possible detrimental effects to their res
idential education programs.
"What we have witnessed at this house is
an increased move towards homogeniza
tion," resident assistant David Smolen said.
"That seems to be the main driving force be
hind this."
In a statement addressed to several top
housing administrators, Hammarskjold res
idents also cited other recent changes in pol
icy and charged that they were all part of a
larger "University-sponsored erosion" of
the house's community.
In the past, Hammarskjold used to con
duct its own housing draw, maintain a guest
room for out-of-town visitors of residents
and stay open during the summer months.
None of these practices continue today.
"This is a real stripping away of what
Hammarskjold used to be," Smolen said.
"We'd hate for every house on campus to be
looking and acting like Stern."
In the same statement, residents pro-
posed two solutions to the prob
lem. The first was to allow the
house to maintain tradition and
keep their non-coin-operated ma
chines.
"This system has been in place
since the University founded co

ops in the 19705," Smolen said. If
the proposed policy is implement
ed, the house has pledged to pur
chase washers and dryers with
long-term service warranties and
has promised to post repair service
telephone numbers right next to
them.
That solution, however,
"doesn't address the fact that the
University is in violation of its con
tract," Conklin said. "It also

doesn't address the volume-pur
chasing power that comes with it.
It's simply not fair to be reneging
just for some houses."
Alternatively, a second pro
posed solution is to have the Reli
able machines simply added to the
ones already there.
From the existing contract, Re
liable Machines makes a projection
of profit and sets their prices for
service and repair accordingly.

Prices rise as a result of unmet
profit projections.
"Now these concerns get
pushed farther and farther away
from students' concerns," Smolen
said, "and more and more towards
'how can we turn this into a profit
center.' "
As of now, the machines in
Hammarskjold are to be replaced
in time for the 1996 summer con
ferees to use them.
