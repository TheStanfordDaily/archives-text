# Laundrygate?
## Call for new machines draws co-op complaints 
### Therese Lee 
An administrative decision calling for the
replacement of Hainmarskjold House's
washer and dryer with coin-operated ma
chines has become a source of conflict for the
international theme co-op.
In an effort to adhere to a current con
tract the University has with Reliable Laun
dry, the Office of Housing and Dining passed
th is decision down earlier this year. The con
tract calls for every student residence to
have Reliable machines, according to Man
ager of Undergraduate Residence Facilities
Diana Conklin.
The laundry machines in the house suf
fered many problems last summer. Repeat
ed complaints and service calls made by con
ferees staying there brought the issue of un
reliable, non-standard laundry facilities to
the attention of the Housing facilities.
"As with any system-like service, we get
the best possible price based on volume in
the business," said Conklin. "As we speak,
Reliable is in fact working on a card-reading
system, where students can just use their ID
card. Reliable is developing that system for

us as part of the deal."
In protest, residents of Hammarskjold
cite possible detrimental effects to their res
idential education programs.
"What we have witnessed at this house is
an increased move towards homogeniza
tion," resident assistant David Smolen said.
"That seems to be the main driving force be
hind this."
In a statement addressed to several top
housing administrators, Hammarskjold res
idents also cited other recent changes in pol
icy and charged that they were all part of a
larger "University-sponsored erosion" of
the house's community.
In the past, Hammarskjold used to con
duct its own housing draw, maintain a guest
room for out-of-town visitors of residents
and stay open during the summer months.
None of these practices continue today.
"This is a real stripping away of what
Hammarskjold used to be," Smolen said.
"We'd hate for every house on campus to be
looking and acting like Stern."
In the same statement, residents pro-
