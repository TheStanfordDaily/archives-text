# AASA fashion world: shaken, not stirred

Amidst smoke and strobe lights, a handsome
Asian James Bond strolls onto the stage in a tuxe
do, with a gun in one hand and a cellular phone in
the other. A beautiful temptress saunters in wear
ing a slinky white dress and caresses him on the
cheek.
The opening scene of the annual Asian Ameri
can Student Association fashion show sets the
mood for the evening, one of mystery and excite
ment, with the James Bond theme of "For Your
Eyes Only." The purpose: to display some of the
latest creations of the fashion industry.
The AASA fashion show has been a staple for
the past four years. The intent is to feature Asian-
American designers, to show trends in main
stream clothing and to feature Asian models.
Senior Julia Lee, an organizer of the show, said
the show tries to promote Asian-American aware
ness in a nontraditional way.
"There are several different angles to our pur
pose — we try to feature designs that reflect Asian-
American trends or designer lines that employ
many Asian designers," Lee said. "The use of
Asian models also breaks traditional images, and
lets the public see that Asian Americans can be
very dynamic as models."
The theme this year differs from those of previ
ous years in that it subtly tries to incorporate
Asian-American issues. According to sophomore
Karine Choi, model committee head, the use of
Asian models in the role of James Bond and his
femme fa tales show that Asian Americans can
take on such characters with finesse.

Students strut their stuff at the Asian American Fashion Show.
"AASA is usually expected to do
something political to promote
Asian-American awareness," Choi
said. "We wanted to show that
AASA is capable of producing

something that is not activist or po
litical — just fun in an informative
way. We are trying to break the
stereotype of Asian Americans as a
modeling and design minority."
"For Your Eyes Only" is also
unique because it incorporates
dancing and acting.
About 300 people are expected
to see the show. Organizers antic

ipate that the style of the clothing
will be a big lure for audiences; ac
cording to model junior Jane Wu,
they are simple and casual, yet so
phisticated.
"There are many rehearsals, so
when I'm not in class or eating,
I'm probably at practice," Wu
said. "The show is hard in terms of
completing homework, but the

friendships I've made and the
memories I'll have will be more
important to me than a few nights
of not studying.

"For Your Eyes Only" will take
place tomorrow at 7 p.m. and 9
p.m. in Toyon Hall. Tickets are
available for $5 beforehand or $7
at the door.
