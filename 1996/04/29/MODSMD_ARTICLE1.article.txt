# Commission looks at how to alter CIV
## 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
Cutting CIV from three to two quarters and
adding a freshman seminar are among changes sug
gested by a commission charged with reforming the
Program in Cultures, Ideas and Values.
English Prof. Robert Polhemus, chair of the CIV
Commission, said while "we haven't made any deci
sions," he and the other faculty members who make
up the panel are seeking ways to restructure CIV into
a more streamlined, effective program of undergrad
uate education.
"We think that the aims [of CIV] can be put more
succinctly than they are in current legislation," Pol
hemus said.
The commission must present its recommenda
tions in spring 1997. It was formed fall quarter as a
result of the work of the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education, a committee created three years ago
by University President Gerhard Casper to examine
all aspects of undergraduate education.
CIV, the backbone of the freshman humanities
curriculum, has elicited responses over the span of
its seven-year livelihood ranging from protests to
high praise. Yet the commission decided early on
that, though in need of revision, CIV is here to stay,
according to Polhemus.
Polhemus said the commission is trying to consid
er "what kinds of emphasis could or should be placed
on first-year undergraduate education." The way to
do this, Polhemus said, is to find "innovative new
programs."
"We're discussing the very nature of what the CIV
program is supposed to do," said Materials Science
and Engineering Prof. John Bravman, a member of
the commission. "There are a number of programs
being reviewed, so it's natural for this one to be re
viewed as well."
One change the commission is considering in
volves smaller discussion sections.
In addition, the commission has raised the issue of
whether CIV should continue in its three-quarter
format or switch to two quarters, in which case a
third-quarter seminar would be required, Polhemus
said.
Whether or not this new structure would preclude
a freshman writing course, or whether the commis-
sion will recommend incorporat
ing the writing requirement into
all the CIV tracks — as is now the
case with Structured Liberal Edu
cation and Literature and the
Arts — is something that remains

to be debated, Polheinus said.
Polhemus also said one way to
improve the CIV program might
be to include more faculty mem
bers in teaching the courses.
The commission will meet May
13 and then again later in the
quarter to continue its discus
sions. It must report to both the
Faculty Senate and John Shoven,
dean of the School of Humanities

and Sciences, by next spring.
Overall, Polhemus said, CIV is
a strong program that could ben
efit from restructuring. Future
freshmen may be pleased to learn
that Polhemus echoed many stu
dents' woes by saying, "I'm in
favor of cutting the number of
texts."
"Five to six texts, and no snip
pets," Polhemus said.
