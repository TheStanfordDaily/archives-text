This year's Bisexual, Gay and
Lesbian Awareness Days celebra
tion honors the 25th anniversary of
the founding of the first gay peo
ple's union at Stanford. Before the
establishment of the union, the les
bian, gay and bisexual community
was not recognized on campus.
The annual celebration kicks off
tonight with a speech by noted
African-American activist Mandy
Carter at 7 p.m. in Tresidder
Union's Oak East Lounge.
This year's theme, "Still Out On
The Farm," recognizes the commu
nity's history on campus, said grad
uate student Sara Sperling, co-co
ordinator of the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center.
The center has worked on this
week's events since the beginning
of winter quarter, Sperling said.
"We're really trying to get fac
ulty, alumni and staff — in addi
tion to students — involved this

year," Sperling said.
Tomorrow, Stanford alumnus
Gerard Koskovich will give a
speech, titled "Private Lives, Public
Struggles."
Asst. English Prof. Sharon Hol
land, is scheduled to participate in a
poetry reading Thursday night.
Also, there will be a comedy perfor
mance on Thursday, titled "Queer
Lively Arts." The event will be held
in the Coffee House from 8 p.m. to
11 p.m.
Sperling said organizers tried to
concentrate on fewer BGLAD
events this year so that people
would be able to spend more time at
each one. All events are open to the
public.
"Throughout all the events, we
want to attract all different types of
students on campus," Sperling
said.
Although the BGLAD events
emphasize awareness, Sperling
said the week is more of a celebra
tion of the community.
"This week helps our communi-

ty feel more of a sense of unity and
support," she said.
'Ilie center's adviser, Troy Gilbert,
said he hopes students realize the
events are for everyone — not just
gay, lesbian and bisexual students.
"Stanford values openness and
non-discrimination. I want the
whole campus to feel welcome,"
Gilbert said.
Other events include Thurs
day's "Queer Carnival" in White
Plaza, which will be featuring drag
racing, and Friday's "It Will Suck
You In" dance in the Elliott Pro
gram Center. The celebration ends
Frid; with the dance.
"'1 he students did an excellent
joh planning the BGLAD," Gilbert
said. "I think this is going to be a
great week."
The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center is co-sponsor
ing the event with the Black Com
munity Services Center, the
Women's Center, the Office of Stu
dent Activities and the Haas Center
for Public Service.
