## Clinton tapes his testimony 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” From the confines of the
White House, President Clinton gave 4 1/2 hours of video
taped testimony yesterday as a defense witness in the
criminal trial of his former Whitewater business partners.
After months of seeking to stay in the background of
the Whitewater case, the president took center stage as
prosecutors and defense lawyers questioned him behind
closed doors throughout the afternoon.
After testifying for the defense for 45 minutes and a
brief break, the president faced more than three hours of
cross-examination by the prosecution. No details of his tes
timony could be learned as participants were under a
court-imposed gag order.
The White House emphasized that Clinton is not a
defendant in the case and has not been accused of any
criminal wrongdoing.
"The president has consistently stated that he will pro
vide the court whatever information he can offer, and
today's deposition fulfills that promise," a White House
statement said. It noted that other presidents, including
Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan, have provided testimony
in criminal trials.
The taped deposition has been sealed by the court pend
ing its showing to the jury hearing the case in Little Rock,
Ark.
Clinton's testimony had been sought by defendants
James and Susan McDougal, the president's two partners
in the Whitewater land deal in the 1980s, to rebut claims
by a key prosecution witness about allegedly improper gov
ernment-secured loans.
The questioning unfolded in the ground floor area of
the president's residence in a room once used for top
secret briefings during World War 11. Clinton entered at
1:12 p.m. EDT. He emerged at 5:38 p.m., according to his
attorneys.
McDougal, his former wife, Susan, and Arkansas Gov.
Jim Guy Tucker are charged in a 21-count indictment that
accuses them of misusing nearly $3 million in govern
ment-backed loans in the mid-1980s. The trial is being
conducted in Little Rock, Ark.
Clinton was subpoenaed by the McDougals' lawyers to
rebut the testimony of former municipal judge David I lale,
the prosecution's key witness. Hale alleged that Clinton,
then Arkansas governor, was involved in arranging an
improper $300,000 loan from Hale's federally backed lend
ing company to Susan McDougal in 1986.
Clinton repeatedly has dismissed Hale's allegations and
called them a "bunch of bull." Hale was sentenced to jail in
March on separate fraud charges.
While Clinton has said he was anxious to cooperate
fully, the taping and lengthy cross-examination prompted
an uneasy mood at the White House on a day when the
president would have preferred to focus his attention on
the visit of Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who was
staying at Blair House just across the street.
