PORT ARTHUR, Australia (AP) — A gun
man who slaughtered 32 people at a popular
tourist site and nearby pub was captured yes
terday by police, after he set fire to a guest cot
tage where he held three hostages.
The gunman, whom police identified as a 29
year old with a history of psychological prob
lems, had opened fire with an semiautomatic
rifle Saturday afternoon on tourists at an colo
nial prison site on the island of Tasmania.
It was the worst shooting massacre in Aus
tralia this century.
"Various massacres would pale into insignif
icance when you look at what has happened in
Tasmania," said Tasmanian Police Commis
sioner John Johnson.
The arrest ended a some 12-hour stand-off
at the bed and breakfast, where the gunman
had barricaded himself with the cottage's two
owners and a guest. The hostages' fate was not
immediately known, but police said the gun
man was the only person they saw inside the
house after it was set ablaze.
Among those killed at the Port Arthur his
toric prison complex were two Canadian
tourists and 30 Australians, including several
children and a baby, witnesses and police said.
One American was among 18 people injured;
police said only that the man, from Washington
state, was not badly hurt.
Witnesses said the man, a blond surfer-type,
had mingled casually in the crowd at the prison
complex before pulling a rifle from a tennis bag
and shooting methodically at visitors.
He moved on to a local pub, shooting and

killing more people, before fleeing to the nearby
Seascape bed-and-breakfast cottage at about 5
p.m. Saturday. By early yesterday, more than
200 local and special police units had surround
ed the guest house.
Police had tried to negotiate by phone with
the gunman, who fired at them with two heavy
caliber military-type rifles, Deputy Police Com
missioner Richard McCreadie said.
The top and bottom floors of the cottage
were burning when police arrested the gunman
outside. He had suffered burns. Witnesses said
a helicopter landed nearby and an ambulance
headed toward the blazing cottage. Other
details of the arrest weren't immediately avail
able.
About 500 tourists were milling about the
prison compound at about 1:30 p.m. Saturday
when a young blond man drove up in a Volk
swagen with a surfboard strapped to the roof, a
witness said. He carried a tennis bag.
He had been chatting to people calmly when
he went into the cafe, pulled a rifle from his bag
and started shooting.
An unidentified Melbourne woman told
Australian Associated Press that she hid under
a table. Afterward, she told AAP, "There were
people just sitting there in their chairs where
they'd been eating — dead.... There was a
weird sort of calm, as if no one could believe
what they were seeing."
Wendy Scurr, who was working at the front
desk of the historic site, said the gunman left
"shooting as he went, shooting everybody he
could see."
