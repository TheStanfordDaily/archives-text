New Mexico fire spreading fast
BANDELIER NATIONAL MONUMENT, N.M. (AP) â€” A fierce, four
day forest fire whipped by unpredictable winds had blackened more than
11,000 acres yesterday as it crept toward a nuclear weapons laboratory.
"The state's ready to go up in flames," said Gov. Gary Johnson, who took
a helicopter tour of the area yesterday. "This is the driest it's ever been."
No injuries were reported. Sixteen backpackers who were in the area had
all been accounted for Saturday afternoon, hours after park managers
closed the monument.
About 800 firefighters were battling the blaze, which began Thursday.
The fire had reached about 3,000 acres of the 32,000-acre Bandelier Nation
al Monument, 40 miles northwest of Santa Fe. Only 10 percent of the fire

was contained, and it was spreading to the north, south and west.
Steep hills and canyons, combined with winds of up to 30 mph, were mak
ing it difficult for firefighters to walk in the area, and for air tankers and
helicopters to spread fire retardant and water.
"The fire is skipping down canyons, the smoke is all over the place," park
ranger Kristi Drexler said. "It's totally unpredictable."
Smoke could be seen for miles in every direction and the fire department
and Red Cross were operating shelters for people who were having trouble
breathing.
Experts say bone-dry conditions have fueled the blaze.
The fire was burning about six miles away from the Los Alamos Nation
al Laboratory, the nation's only operating nuclear weapons laboratory. The
first atomic bomb was created at the lab in 1952.
