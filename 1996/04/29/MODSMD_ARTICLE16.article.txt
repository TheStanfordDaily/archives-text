## Bachrach, Ellis take home NCAA championships 
### Aida Leu Staff writer 
The Stanford men's gymnastics
team had come so far. Despite a
number of injuries and setbacks,
the team persevered and headed
into the NCAA championships Fri
day night at Maples Pavilion with a
No. 1 ranking. However, the Cardi
nal simply could not leap over the
very last hurdle in order to bring
the title home for the second con
secutive year.
The highly anticipated Bay Area
battle between Stanford and Cali

fornia came to an anticlimactic end
as Blaine Wilson led Ohio State
from third place to take the title.
The Cardinal (229.925) settled for
third behind the Buckeyes (232.15)
and the Golden Bears (231.775).
However, Stanford did bring home
five All-American honors, includ
ing individual event titles in the
floor exercise and the parallel bars
on Saturday night.
Junior lan Bachrach accom
plished his year-long goal, winning
the individual championship in the
floor exercise with a season high of
9.913. Junior Jamie Ellis tied with

Wilson for the top honors on the
parallel bars with a 9.75. However,
these individual accomplishments
were overshadowed by the team's
overall mediocre performance the
night before.
On Friday night, Stanford
began the match with a outstand
ing showing on the floor exercise.
Stanford tallied a 9.7 from sopho
more Clarence Miao, a 9.75 from
Ellis, a stellar 9.9 from junior Keith
Wiley and a 9.8 from Bachrach.
These scores eclipsed those in the
qualifying round the night before
and gave the Cardinal reason to be
optimistic going into the following
events.
Those plans quickly fell apart as
Stanford performed adequately,
but not superlatively, in the next
two events. In the second event for
the Cardinal, the pommel horse,
the gymnasts failed to beat their
score from the previous night, a
38.850, and instead scored a com
bined 38.5 on the event. On the
rings, however, Stanford scored
slightly better than in the prelimi
nary round with a 38.375.
Meanwhile, Ohio State and Cal
ifornia were steadily improving on
their preliminary round scores.
After the first three rotations,
Stanford was in third place, but it
wasn't until after the fourth rota
tion that first place seemed out of
reach.
In the vault, Stanford failed to
solidly land any of its six routines.
Freshman Scott Finklestein was
the first up, and fell during the
landing. Head coach Sadao Hama
da revealed that the team's weak
ness in the event forced him to
change the rotation. He placed
Ellis, the squad's best vaulter, last
— if necessary, the junior would at
tempt a more difficult vault to give
the team score a boost.
Although Ellis had been consis
tently hitting the more difficult
vault in practice, he failed to land it
during the competition and scored
a 9.150.
Hamada, who also is a golf in
structor, explained the tactical de
cision. "It's like going for eagle;

even though there is a lake to the
right and a bunker to front, you go
for it. We put it in the pond."
The Cardinal gymnasts' only
hope to regain the lead was to hit
every event from then on, and have
both California and Ohio miss

theirs. Unfortunately, although
Stanford's performance was not
bad, it was not enough. On the par
allel bar, the top four scores were all
in the mid-9s.
The last event was the high bar,
which the Cardinal hit the night be

fore. In the last team performance
of his Stanford career, senior Peter
Hegi scored a solid 9.7 on the hori
zontal bar. Bachrach uncharacter
istically broke during his routine

and scored a 9.25. Nonetheless,
Stanford's final two performances
gave the crowd something to cheer
about. Both Wiley and Ellis scored
a 9.825, their highest scores of the
season.
"The positive thing is that we
never gave up — always keep your
head up," Ellis said. Both he and
Hamada confessed to rooting for
rival Cal to overtake Ohio State for
the win.
But, in the end, California could
not shake Wilson, who was a rock
throughout the whole competition.
Wilson scored an average of 9.81 on
all six events.
"It's nice to go out of a team com
petition with your friends and fami
ly around and to be at home on the
Stanford campus — I couldn't ask

for anything more." said Hegi, the
team co-captain. "We've had an
amazing ride. We've overcome so
many obstacles. Wejust had the best
meet of our lives one day too soon.
"There was Tim [Dalrymple]'s
injury, and David |Ludlow]'s
surgery, and Scott IFinklestein]
broke his hand — all those things
brought out the best in us."
Hard work from the younger
gymnasts allowed many to take
home individual honors. In addi
tion to the two individual champi
onships earned by Bachrach and
Ellis, sophomore Clarence Miao
claimed fourth place on the vault
with a 9.525 and sophomore Jere
my Herman took fifth on the pom
mel horse with a 9.713.
"Obviously, our number one
goal was the team championship,"
Herman said. "We really wanted to
take it, but we had a mediocre meet
on Friday and we didn't achieve our
number one goal. But this was defi

nitely one of my goals, I guess my
number two goal, to be an Ail-
American and I achieved that goal."
Bachrach's routines in the indi
vidual finals were spectacular. In
addition to the championship on
the floor, he earned Ail-American
honors with second-place finishes
on the high bar and the vault,
which he won last year.
"I always knew that floor was
my best event — but I'm never that
'on.' I'm sure it was the crowd, my
friends and coaches that really
helped me out. I had fun and I
think that's the most important
thing," Bachrach said.
Bachrach, Ellis, Miao and Her
man joined Wiley as All-Americans
— Wiley took second place in the
all-around on Thursday night.
The Cardinal season was filled
with adversity and triumph, but
Hamada said in sum of the season,
"I have no regrets, no disappoint
ments."
