# Card sweeps Bruins to win eighth straight
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
As the springtime weather heated up
this weekend at Sunken Diamond, the
No. 15 Stanford baseball team remained
on fire.

The Cardinal completed a three-game
sweep of No. 13 UCLA yesterday with a 6-
4 victory, extending its winning streak to
a season-high eight games. Stanford (31-
17,16-11 in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion) picked up three games on the Bruins
(28-20,16-11 in the Six-Pac) in the league

standings. The two teams stand tied for
second place in the Six-Pac with one series
remaining for each squad.
Head coach Mark Marquess' team
took advantage of outstanding efforts
from all three of its starting pitchers and
got on the scoreboard early to keep the
Bruins at bay.
Yesterday's starter, freshman Jeff
Austin (5-3), worked six innings in his sec
ond consecutive strong outing. Austin
struck out seven and only walked one, al
lowing one earned run while scattering
eight hits.
"He pitched great against Arizona last
week and I was pleased with his pitching
today," Marquess said. "In the first in
ning or two I didn't think he had great
stuff, but then he settled down and gave
us four real good innings after that. He
did a good job in real hitter's conditions
with the wind blowing out."
The win was Austin's second in a row
after a tough stretch in the middle of the
season.
"Before last weekend I had a couple of
rough outings," said Austin, who notched
a complete-game victory against UCLA
on Feb. 24. "I made a mechanical change
and things have come around for me. I
was thinking about today's game, not
February. The past couple of weeks, I was
frustrated because I wasn't throwing as
well as I knew I could, so I came out today
and tried to have a good time."
Bruins starter Dan Keller (5-3) was
not having a good time, as the right-han-

der allowed four home runs which
accounted for all of Stanford's scor
ing.
Leading 1-0 in the bottom of the
first, Keller served up a long-ball to
catcher A.J. Hinch, who put Stan
ford ahead 2-1. Two innings later,
Hinch struck again, sending a two
run shot way out of the park to ex
tend the Cardinal lead to 4-1. The
blasts were Hinch's 10th and 11th
of the season and marked the first
time the All-Ameriain has hit two
home runs in a game for Stanford.
"I put some good swings on the
ball and this ball [Kirk becomes a hit
ter's park in the springtime," Hinch
said.
Third baseman Troy Kent stung
Keller with a long drive over the left
field fence in the fourth inning and
designated hitter Jon Schaeffer
chased the UCLA pitcher with a
long-ball in the sixth. Kent's home
run was his sixth of the year while
Schaeffer tallied his ninth.
The Bruins showed some power
of their own in the eighth inning
when Tim Deduces and Eric Valent
hit back-to-back solo homers off
Cardinal reliever Mario Iglesias, but
it was not enough to avoid the series
sweep. Stanford's Tom Reimers
shut the door on UCI.A to pick up
his third save of the campaign.
In Saturday's contest, a 10-8 win
for the home team, the Cardinal
jumped all over Bruins starter Rick

Heineman (1-5), touching him up
for seven runs in 2 1/3 innings. The
Stanford bats did not treat Reliever
Matt Klien much better as they hit
him for three runs in 1 2/3 innings
while the Cardinal built up a 10-1
lead.
Schaeffer and Kent both hit
home runs and six Stanford hitters
had runs batted in to support
starter Chad Hutchinson (6-1).
Hutchinson, a hard-throwing right
hander, has picked up wins in his
last sLx decisions and has provided
Marquess with good innings since
entering the starting rotation.
Against UCLA, Hutchinson
scattered seven hits in six innings,
allowing three runs. The freshman
had problems with his control at
times, walking five batters, but
managed to work out of several jams
during his outing.
The Bruins cut the deficit to 10-3
with two runs in the fifth and did
not go quietly. A three-run home
run by Chad Matoian in the top of
the ninth keyed a five-run outburst
that left UCIA just short.
Friday night, the Bruins could
not touch Stanford's Kyle Peterson
(7-5), who threw a complete-game
shutout, his first of the year. Peter
son allowed just four hits, struck out
Six and walked one in a 4-0 Cardinal
win. The big right-hander out-du
eled UCI.A's ace, Jim Parque (8-1),
who went the distance for the Bru
ins.
Marquess is pleased to see Peter
son, who won three games in the
postseason last year, regaining the
form that carried him to a 14-1

record in his freshman campaign.
"Friday was one of his better
games of the year," Marquess said.
"I compared it to his game against
Fullerton at the beginning of the
season. He hooked up against (Par
que) who was undefeated and he
shut them down with a great ef
fort."
The win was Peterson's fifth in
his past six decisions and the
shutout lowered his ERA to 3.99.
First baseman Luke Quaccia con
tinued his hot hitting, going 2-for-4
with a solo home run, his second, in
support of Peterson.
"This is as consistent as we've
been all season so I'm really pleased
with it," Marquess said yesterday of
the weekend sweep. "We got some
timely hitting — today we only had
nine hits but scored six runs — we
did a good job of getting some key
hits with runners on base."
Its position in the Six-Pac stand
ings also gives Stanford an excellent
chance for a post-season invitation.
"Our outlook is good, being tied
for second place," Marquess said.
"We're going to get second or third
and I think the first three teams in
our conference will be in postseason
play. We put ourselves in a good spot
by winning these games."
Hinch is also pleased with the re
cent play of the team, as he looks to
return to the College World Series
in Omaha, Neb., before leaving the
Farm.
"It's coming together," Hinch
said. "As a team we're playing out
standing baseball both offensively
and defensively."

hander, has picked up wins in his
last sLx decisions and has provided
Marquess with good innings since
entering the starting rotation.
Against UCLA, Hutchinson
scattered seven hits in six innings,
allowing three runs. The freshman
had problems with his control at
times, walking five batters, but
managed to work out of several jams
during his outing.
The Bruins cut the deficit to 10-3
with two runs in the fifth and did
not go quietly. A three-run home
run by Chad Matoian in the top of
the ninth keyed a five-run outburst
that left UCIA just short.
Friday night, the Bruins could
not touch Stanford's Kyle Peterson
(7-5), who threw a complete-game
shutout, his first of the year. Peter
son allowed just four hits, struck out
Six and walked one in a 4-0 Cardinal
win. The big right-hander out-du
eled UCI.A's ace, Jim Parque (8-1),
who went the distance for the Bru
ins.
Marquess is pleased to see Peter
son, who won three games in the
postseason last year, regaining the
form that carried him to a 14-1

record in his freshman campaign.
"Friday was one of his better
games of the year," Marquess said.
"I compared it to his game against
Fullerton at the beginning of the
season. He hooked up against (Par
que) who was undefeated and he
shut them down with a great ef
fort."
The win was Peterson's fifth in
his past six decisions and the
shutout lowered his ERA to 3.99.
First baseman Luke Quaccia con
tinued his hot hitting, going 2-for-4
with a solo home run, his second, in
support of Peterson.
"This is as consistent as we've
been all season so I'm really pleased
with it," Marquess said yesterday of
the weekend sweep. "We got some
timely hitting — today we only had
nine hits but scored six runs — we
did a good job of getting some key
hits with runners on base."
Its position in the Six-Pac stand
ings also gives Stanford an excellent
chance for a post-season invitation.
"Our outlook is good, being tied
for second place," Marquess said.
"We're going to get second or third
and I think the first three teams in
our conference will be in postseason
play. We put ourselves in a good spot
by winning these games."
Hinch is also pleased with the re
cent play of the team, as he looks to
return to the College World Series
in Omaha, Neb., before leaving the
Farm.
"It's coming together," Hinch
said. "As a team we're playing out
standing baseball both offensively
and defensively."
