### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
As the springtime weather heated up
this weekend at Sunken Diamond, the
No. 15 Stanford baseball team remained
on fire.

The Cardinal completed a three-game
sweep of No. 13 UCLA yesterday with a 6-
4 victory, extending its winning streak to
a season-high eight games. Stanford (31-
17,16-11 in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion) picked up three games on the Bruins
(28-20,16-11 in the Six-Pac) in the league

standings. The two teams stand tied for
second place in the Six-Pac with one series
remaining for each squad.
Head coach Mark Marquess' team
took advantage of outstanding efforts
from all three of its starting pitchers and
got on the scoreboard early to keep the
Bruins at bay.
Yesterday's starter, freshman Jeff
Austin (5-3), worked six innings in his sec
ond consecutive strong outing. Austin
struck out seven and only walked one, al
lowing one earned run while scattering
eight hits.
"He pitched great against Arizona last
week and I was pleased with his pitching
today," Marquess said. "In the first in
ning or two I didn't think he had great
stuff, but then he settled down and gave
us four real good innings after that. He
did a good job in real hitter's conditions
with the wind blowing out."
The win was Austin's second in a row
after a tough stretch in the middle of the
season.
"Before last weekend I had a couple of
rough outings," said Austin, who notched
a complete-game victory against UCLA
on Feb. 24. "I made a mechanical change
and things have come around for me. I
was thinking about today's game, not
February. The past couple of weeks, I was
frustrated because I wasn't throwing as
well as I knew I could, so I came out today
and tried to have a good time."
