# Women's gym takes eighth at nationals
## 
### Keith Rabkin Contributing writer 
Competing in only its second NCAA
championship in team history, the Stan
ford women's gymnastics squad (2-7) cap
tured eighth place in Thursday night's
preliminary rounds. This placed the squad
higher than its 11th seed, but was not good
enough to advance the Cardinal into Fri
day's championship round of competition.
Only the teams with the top six scores —
the Super Six — move onward.
The eighth-place finish last Thursday
at the University of Alabama was the
highest spot the Cardinal has ever earned
at the national competition. In its first ap
pearance, back in 1992, the team garnered
a 10th- place score of 189.100.
The University of Georgia, which
crushed the Cardinal early in the year,
placed first in the preliminary round with
a total score of 196.400. Stanford finished
ahead of BYU, Michigan, Nebraska and
Penn State with its score of 194.025, but
was unable to beat Pacific 10 Conference
rivals UCLA and Oregon State, which fin
ished fourth and fifth, respectively.
The Cardinal gymnasts' best showing
came on the beam, an event that they
struggled with earlier in the season. Their
team score 0f48.475 allowed them to cap

ture sixth in that event, which alone could
not qualify the team for the final day of
competition.
While the team excelled on the beam,
the Cardinal gymnasts could not edge
their way into the upper echelon of the
tough overall competition. Although
sophomore Keri Monahan and freshman
Amy Murakami put up strong scores in
multiple events, they could not compete
against the likes of Alabama's Kim Kelly,
who earned a perfect 10 on tne floor, or
Georgia's Leah Brown, who helped put
away the Cardinal with her 9.95 on the
vault. Alabama's Stephanie Woods, who
topped Brown with a 9.975 vault, and
Utah's Summer Reid, who took beam
with a 9.925, also helped close any doors of
opportunity for Stanford.
After great success at regionals — fin
ishing third in the West and getting the
top two individual scores — the eighth
place finish was dissapointing. After striv
ing all season to get to nationals, the Car
dinal was sorely defeated by the formida
ble opposition.
Head coach Lisa Izzi turned a group of
talented individual gymnasts into a com
petitive team. With her mental training
program and rigorous physical practices
she forced many of the gymnasts to im
prove drastically. As the season pro

gressed, team scores went up and the Car
dinal gymnasts shattered virtually every
record in their book.
Monahan was the team's top performer
this season, breaking all her previous bests
and setting the all-time Stanford records in
the all-around, beam, bars, and vault.
Monahan was named to the Pac-10 All-
Conference team as an all-arounder, after
finishing with the fifth-best all around av
erage score in Pac-10 competition (39.475).
Monahan was also named to the Pac-10
second team for All-Academic honors.
In her first season at Stanford, Mu
rakami rebounded from a serious back in
jury to tie the Stanford record for bars, to
set the record for floor, and to capture the
second best all-around score in Stanford
history. Additionally, Murakami earned
conference honors on the floor exercise.
Sophomore Amy Neil also eiirned a post
season award by earning honorable men
tion to the Pac-10 All-Academic Team.
With such a skilled, young team in her
hands, Izzi will have plenty of time to mold
it into a national competitor. Next season
will see the return of all the gymnasts,
with the exception of senior captain Linda
Chun. Hopefully, the squad will improve
on their poor Pac-10 record (0-6) and a
earn a berth into the championship round
at nationals.
