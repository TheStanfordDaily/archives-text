# Sophomore Crum shines in Cougar Classic tourney
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
A month ago, sophomore Eri Crum was
just one of several junior varsity golfers
vying for a spot on the starting squad. How
things can change in just a few short
weeks.
In his third career varsity start, Crum
made a run at the individual title, finishing
in a tie for second place and helping the
17th-ranked Cardinal earn a victory at the
Cougar Classic last weekend in Provo,
Utah.
"We're really getting into a rhythm,"
said head coach Wally Goodwin. "We came
in hoping to get settled into our game and

prepare for Pacific 10 championships and I
think we accomplished all that."
The squad destroyed the 16-team field,
finishing 12 strokes ahead of its nearest
challenger with a three-round score 0f872.
Its domination of the competition was re
lentless, as the Cardinal led from start to
finish, posting the low team rounds
throughout the tournament. District ri
vals Fresno State and Brigham Young,
which hosted the meet, provided little
challenge, placing a distant third and
fourth, respectively.
"A lot of people have doubted our abili
ties this year," Goodwin said, "so it's always
great to play against some teams
that we'll see in the postseason and
to do well against them."

Sophomore Ail-American
Tiger Woods, coming off a one
tournament hiatus to compete in
the Masters, picked up right
where he left off, taking his famil
iar spot at the top of the leader
board by pacing all individuals
with a 217. The win was Woods'

fourth of the season. In 10 ap
pearances, he has finished out of
the top three only twice.
"When we played at home last
weekend, Tiger looked just fine,"
Goodwin said. "He was playing
typical Tiger golf, shooting right
around his average."
The other starters found simi
lar success as senior captain Jerry
Chang finished in eighth place,
with freshman Joel Kribel and ju
nior Conrad Ray falling one
stroke behind in a tie for ninth.
Scores on the final day skyrocket
ed due to extreme winds, but the
squad managed to hold it togeth
er, even extending its lead.
"I was really impressed with
the way everybody handled them
selves," Goodwin said. "The wind
threw us all off a bit, but we were
able to stay focused and poised.
"I am especially pleased to see
that Conrad has become much
better at handling the good and
the bad."
The key remained Crum, whose
second-round 68 was the low round
of the tournament. While ('rum's
performance was surprising, it was
by no means unthinkable. In his
first two starts, he posted several
respectable rounds and displayed a
consistency which had been woe
fully lacking at the No. 5 slot.
"Eri has really stepped it up in
the last few weeks," Goodwin
said. "He's really come in and
given us everything we've asked
for and for now, it looks like he's
going to be a force over the next
couple of years.
"To win, we needed any one of
our second three [Crum, liay, and
senior David Garcia] to post a de
cent score and we showed how
dangerous we can be if that hap
pens."
The Cardinal will have very lit -
tle time to rest on its laurels with
the Tuesday start of the Pac-10
championships in Newport Beach
looming large.
It will be the first time this sea
son that the team will play back
to-back tournaments in such a
short period of time.
