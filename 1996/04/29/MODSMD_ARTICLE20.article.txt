### Brian Auld Contributing writer 
After the first day of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Men's Tennis Individual Championships,
things were going very well for the Cardinal. All

four Stanford players invited to the tourney
emerged victorious from their first and second
round matches. Of the eight players to make it
to the quarterfinals, four of them belonged to
Stanford.
But the singles took a turn for the worse on
day two. Only senior Jim Thomas was able to
make it to the semis, defeating Washington's
Eric Drew 6-7, 6-4, 2-1. Ln the seniifinals,
Thomas ran into No. 2 Cecil Mamiit, a freshman
from USC. Mamiit proved too much for
Thomas, winning easily, 6-3,6-1.
Those Stanford players who suffered day
two defeats included sophomore Paul Goldstein,
freshman Ryan Wolters and senior JefT Salzen
stein.
SaLzenstein, ranked fifth nationally, entered
the tournament as the top seed and looked veiy
good in his first two matches, cruising to consec
utive straight set wins. Unfortunately for the
Cardinal captain, he ran into a very hot Adam
Peterson in the quarters. Peterson, a senior
from USC and the No. 97 player in the country,
outplayed Salzenstein on the way to a 6-4, 6-2
victory.
Spurred on by his impressive victory over the
tournament favorite, Peterson continued to
play inspired tennis for the rest of the weekend,
dropping only one set en route to the title.
Wolters, ranked ninth in the latest polls, also
breezed to two straight set wins in his first two
matches. In a battle between the top two fresh
men in the country, Wolters matched up with
Mamiit in the quarters. Wolters won the first
set, but could not hold on, losing 3-6,6-3,7-5.
No. 24 Goldstein followed suit in the first two
rounds, winning both his matches in straight
sets. He lost to UCI A's Eric Taino in the quar
terfinals, 6-3,6-1. Taino, ranked 27t.h, has been
a nemesis to Stanford all year long — he is 3-0
against the Cardinal in dual match bouts.
The doubles campaign turned out to be a

much more successful venture for
Stanford. The Cardinal entered two
teams in the tournament, both of
which advanced to the finals. Stan
ford's top doubles team, the nation
ally second-ranked combo of Gold

stein and Thomas, outlasted the
Card's second doubles duo, 19th
ranked Salzenstein and Wolters, in a
marathon match, 7-6,6-7,7-5.
In other action, Stanford tennis'
"Road Warriors," senior Ilicky Beck
er and junior Grant Elliott, thrashed
their competition this weekend at
the 10th annual Collegiate Invita
tional in Ojai. Both players dominat
ed their halves of the draw, and met

one another in the finals of the sin
gles.
In that finals match, which both
players admitted was a little sloppy,
Becker defeated Elliott 6-3,6-4.
To top it all off, Becker and Elliott
teamed up to win the doubles por
tion of the event as well. In the fuiiils
of that event, the "warriors" sound
ly polished off Cal-Poly's Chris Mag
yary and Casey Wood 6-4,6-4.
