# Conference urges improving kid's lives
## Speaker tells audience to 'think globally and act locally on behalf of children' 
### Andrea Chartock Staff writer 
The 13th annual You Can Make a Difference
Conference urged participants to offer their
time and energy to help improve the lives of
children.
"The world doesn't need more investment
bankers, venture capitalists and corporate
lawyers. What it needs is people with brains

and education to go out and help children by
thinking globally and acting locally on behalf of
children," said alumnus William Abrams, the
keynote speaker at Saturday's conference.
"Even if one is a venture capitalist, there are
ways to help and get involved ... all the way
down to volunteering as a Little League coach
and being a good parent," he added.
More than 150 people attended the confer
ence, which was titled, "Whole Children, Bro

ken Lives: Piecing Together a Better Future
For Our Kids."
In his keynote address, Abrams said the
public has become numb to statistics about the
problems facing today's youth. Abrams, who
teaches a course on children and law at Stan
ford, practices large business law in San Fran
cisco and frequently takes on children's advo-
cacy cases on a pro bono basis.
For example, a recent Los Ange
les police report showed that only
12 children were killed in house
hold violence. He expressed his
disbelief that the word, "only,"
was used in this context.
On the other hand, some cases
haven't lost their "shock value,"
Abrams said. He said he once rep
resented a 6-year-old boy whose
middle-class father had stuck nee
dles in his private parts.
According to Abrams, structur
al problems facing children in
clude the fact that they have no
voice or vote as a constituency and
little organization as an interest
group.

He pointed out that politicians
often feel free to use children for
their own agenda by giving and
taking away programs and fund
ing at their convenience. Abrams
urged the crowd to research politi
cians' track records on children's
issues and hold them accountable
at the ballot box.
For some of the participants,
the most valuable aspect of the
conference was the small work
shops.
According to junior Heidi
Mihm, a human biology major,
"The workshops were especially
informative. They were run by
people who really work in these
fields. I found that the workshops
were great because they empow
ered us by giving us ideas of what's
going on and what we can do to
help."
The conference promoted vol

unteer activities such as visiting a
pediatric ward with Stanford's
Project SMILES, writing a letter,
coaching a sports team and tutor
ing at an elementary school.
The conference's closing ad
dress was given my Tony Massen
gale, a community leader on chil
dren's issues from South Central
Los Angeles. Massengale reiterat
ed one of the main ideas of the con
ference — that children as a whole
have to been seen as a worthwhile
entity instead of being split up into
"problem" groups such as gang
members and teen-age mothers.
He also stressed the need for pre
ventative rather than punitive ac
tion.
Conference organizers said
they were pleased with the event's
success.
"We received a lot of positive
feedback," said sophomore Brian

Babcock, co-chair of the confer
ence. "We started planning the
conference at the beginning of the
school year and in the past few
weeks we've been at the Haas Cen
ter all the time — we weren't in
our classes or sleeping." Along
with co-chair Emily Behr, Babcock
coordinated the efforts of nearly
100 student and staff conference
volunteers.
Programming Director Monica
Klement, a sophomore, summed
up the conference: "I think the
campus is moving away from apa
thy and into service. The confer
ence and the Haas Center organi
zations in general are an anchor on
campus that are cultivating en
thusiasm, reaching out to others
and reminding people through ex
ample of their obligation to set
aside time to serve the larger com
munity."
