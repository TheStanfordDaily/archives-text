# Students vow to keep STS major
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Although high-ranking ad
ministrators have announced
that Stanford's Program in Sci
ence, Technology and Society will
no longer offer degrees after
1998, students in the program
say the fight to keep the major is
far from over.
The nearly 50 students major
ing in STS have met several times
since receiving notice of the
change to the program Wednes
day. On Friday, about 30 stu
dents met with Materials Science
and Engineering Prof. John
Bravman, senior associate dean
for student affairs in the School
of Engineering, and Acting STS
Chair Robert McGinn to discuss
routes they could take to ensure
their major will be available in the
future.
Students have already come up
with a simple mission statement:
To save STS as a major, at least in
its current form, said STS major
Colleen Chien, a senior.
"Our approach has been to do
that at any cost," Chien said.

More than anything else, she
said, students want to be part of a
process they have been left out of
from the beginning. Students
found out about the change to the
program only after receiving let
ters and e-mail from Bravman
and McGinn Wednesday.
"We want to be part of the dis
cussion," Chien said. While this
will include working together
with faculty to find options other
than ending the major, students
will not hesitate to put pressure
on faculty and the administra
tion, she said.
Bravman said at the meeting
Friday that students were never
consulted simply because no one
suggested it.
Chien and junior Michael Sil
verton, another STS major, both
said they accepted the explana
tion.
"These two guys are really ad
vocates," Silverton said.
Chien said students felt the
meeting was very positive overall.
"There was a lot of effort put in by
faculty and administration" to
save the program, she said. "It
was definitely not a lack of effort
on their part."
Some of the efforts faculty and
administrators have taken to
maintain parts of the program in
clude developing a minor and
planning to continue an already
existing honors program.
Still, students said they hope to
have the chance to work on a solu
tion to the problems themselves.
They will seek to have the ending
date of the program's degree
granting authority extended by
another year, Chien said.
During that time, she said,
they may look for faculty and
monetary support. Last night,
they began collecting signatures
on a petition in support of the pro
gram.
Students are welcome to try to
reverse the decision, Bravman
said Friday, offering more back
ground on how it was reached in
the first place.
Many of the problems the STS
program faces stem from the fact
that it is an interdisciplinary pro
gram that stretches across two
schools â€” the School of Engineer
ing and the School of Humanities
and Sciences.
When the former dean of the

School of Humanities and Sci
ences decided against running
part of the STS program several
years ago, the sole responsibility
was left to the School of Engineer
ing.
That change "is the first of sev
eral events that I'm sure has led
us to this day," Bravman said.
Several attempts were made to
find a way to continue the pro
gram.
A group made up of McGinn,
two professors affiliated with the
STS program and a potential per
manent program chair wrote a
plan that called for expanding
STS to include faculty research,
graduate education and commu
nity service and educational out
reach.
Acting Assoc. STS Prof. Paul
Edwards, who co-authored the
document, said it was written in
response to demands set forth by
the candidate for director of the
STS program. Although the plan
was considered "outstanding" by
almost everyone who read it, Ed
wards said, it could not pass the
highest levels of the administra
tion for three reasons.
"First, the administration was
unconvinced that the program
plan would be backed by serious
commitments of time and energy
from senior faculty," Edwards
said in a letter to STS students.
"Second, the Engineering School
proved extremely unwilling to

commit permanent faculty lines
to STS.
"Finally, since the proposed
program would have been split be
tween [humanities and sciences)
and engineering, each side want
ed the other to bear more of the fi
nancial and administrative bur
den."
Professors cannot be appoint
ed to an interdisciplinary pro
gram and must instead work for
the program in conjunction with
work done through a department.
Students asked Friday if the
rules might be changed to allow
tenure-line professors to be hired
for STS or other interdisciplinary
programs. Bravman said a change
would be highly unlikely, al
though anyone with $3.5 million
could establish an endowed chair
in STS.
While students remain far
from that goal, one STS alumnus
has already donated to the cause.
Jeff Benesch, currently a mas
ter's student in industrial engi
neering at Stanford, said he will
present University President
Gerhard Casper with a $1,000
check made out to the STS bache
lor's degrees program, payable
Oct. 1, 1998.
In the meantime, students con
tinue to work out strategies.
"People are committed to
sticking this out and are not at all
disheartened by what we've
heard," Chien said.
