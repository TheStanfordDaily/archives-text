Although high-ranking ad
ministrators have announced
that Stanford's Program in Sci
ence, Technology and Society will
no longer offer degrees after
1998, students in the program
say the fight to keep the major is
far from over.
The nearly 50 students major
ing in STS have met several times
since receiving notice of the
change to the program Wednes
day. On Friday, about 30 stu

future.
Students have already come up

said, students want to be part of a
process they have been left out of

found out about the change to the
program only after receiving let
ters and e-mail from Bravman
and McGinn Wednesday.
"We want to be part of the dis
cussion," Chien said. While this
will include working together
with faculty to find options other
than ending the major, students
will not hesitate to put pressure
on faculty and the administra
tion, she said.
Bravman said at the meeting
Friday that students were never
consulted simply because no one
suggested it.
Chien and junior Michael Sil
verton, another STS major, both
said they accepted the explana
tion.
"These two guys are really ad
vocates," Silverton said.
Chien said students felt the
meeting was very positive overall.
"There was a lot of effort put in by
faculty and administration" to
