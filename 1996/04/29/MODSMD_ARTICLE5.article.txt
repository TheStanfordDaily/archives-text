Fourteen professors were recog

graduate teaching.
In a speech Thursday, dean of
the School of Humanities and Sci

recipients of the Dean's Award for
Distinguished Teaching, the Bing

donors, we've been able to create a
series of honors to celebrate the

Shoven said.

Others receiving the Dean's
Award for Distinguished Teaching
were: French and Italian Prof.

Albert Gelpi and French and Italian
Prof. Sepp Gumbrecht, who were
both praised for their graduate
teaching.
"To be acknowledged and recog
