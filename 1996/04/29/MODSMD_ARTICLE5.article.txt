### Kelly E. Young 
Fourteen professors were recog
nized last week for their outstand
ing efforts in undergraduate and
graduate teaching.
In a speech Thursday, dean of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven announced the
recipients of the Dean's Award for
Distinguished Teaching, the Bing
Fellowship, the Terman Fellowship
and the Dean's Fellowship.
"Through the generosity of
donors, we've been able to create a
series of honors to celebrate the
wonderful teaching that takes place
throughout [the School of Humani
ties and Sciences] at both the under
graduate and graduate levels,"
Shoven said.
Recipients of the awards were
notified earlier in the week. Reli
gious Studies Prof. Van Harvey said
he learned that he won the Dean's
Award for Distinguished Teaching
on Tuesday, his birthday.
"I was overjoyed [with the

award| because I'm going to retire
this year. Naturally, it's nice to
think that older teachers can still be
recognized for their work," said
Harvey, who was recognized for his
excellence in graduate teaching.
Others receiving the Dean's
Award for Distinguished Teaching
were: French and Italian Prof.
Brigitte Cazelles, who was com
mended for special achievements
such as curriculum reform in teach
ing; Asst. Economics Prof. Thomas
Nechyba, who was recognized for
his accomplishments in his first
year of teaching; and English Prof.
Albert Gelpi and French and Italian
Prof. Sepp Gumbrecht, who were
both praised for their graduate
teaching.
"To be acknowledged and recog
nized by one's colleagues is one of
the greatest honors one could re
ceive. I've been teaching here since
1968, so I've been here a long time.
This kind of recognition for distin
guished teaching is a very satisfying
event," said Gelpi.
The Bing Fellowship honors fac
ulty from the Schools of Earth Sci
ences, Engineering and Humanities
and Sciences for energy, innovation
and initiative directed toward un
dergraduates through the class
room, advising and curriculum, said
Shoven. The fellowship was award
ed to Psychology Prof. Russell Fer
nald, Chemistry Profs. James Coll
man and Richard Zare and Chemical
Engineering Prof. George Homsy.
Fernald, who teaches "Brain
and Behavior" among other classes,
was named chair of the Human Bi
ology Program last quarter. He ex
pressed his gratitude at receiving
the award but also said he is uncer
tain how he will use the award
money next year. The fellows re

ceive $ 10,000 a year for three years.
The Bing Fellowship is "intend
ed to give winners some money to
try to innovate in the way they
teach. I've been thinking and imag
ining ways I could improve an idea,
but I don't really know yet how to
use those funds," said Fernald.
Junior faculty members were
also honored with Terman Fellow
ships and Dean's Fellowships.
"One of our highest priorities in
recent years has been to continually
develop the next generation of im
portant scholars by hiring talented
junior faculty and providing them
with an outstanding environment
in which to launch their careers,"
Shoven said.
A $25 million donation in 1993
from Stanford alumni William
Hewlett and David Packard estab
lished the Terman Fellowship pro
gram. The Terman Fellows for
1995-96 are Asst. Hopkins Marine
Station Prof. Barbara Block, Asst.
Chemistry Prof. John Griffin and

Asst. Statistics Prof. Jun Liu. The
fellows will receive up to $100,000
for three years.
Griffin, who researched how to
make antibiotics work more effi
ciently and how oxidosqualene cy
clase enzymes catalyze a principal
step in sterole synthesis, said the fel
lowship came at a critical time in his
career. The fellowship helps fund
"all the nutty ideas one might want
to try," he said.
Asst. English Prof. Sharon Hol
land and Asst. History Prof.
Gabrielle Hecht were named Dean's
Fellows in the Humanities. This
program will provide Holland and
Hecht with a research account and
one year of paid leave so they may
prepare for their tenure reviews.
Next year, the Dean's Office
plans to make the first Dean's
Awards available to junior faculty in
the social sciences, Shoven said.
A formal awards ceremony for
(he 14 recipients is scheduled for the
week of May 20.
