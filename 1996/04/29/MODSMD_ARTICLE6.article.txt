In a Friday night speech, An
gela Davis urged members of the
younger generation to make their
voices heard in social move
ments.
Davis, who drew national at
tention in the early 1970s after
she was fired from her professor
ial position at UCLA for being a
member of the Communist
Party, emphasized the impor
tance of supporting affirmative
action and "radical politics."
"Many years ago Ronald Rea
gan made a public announcement
that I would never teach at the
University of California ever
again," said Davis, who now is
the UC presidential chair in
African-American and Feminist
Studies.
Davis was the keynote speaker
for Stanford's Herstory celebra
tion.
Before Davis delivered her
speech on diversity, radical ac
tivism and affirmative action,
she told the Annenberg Auditori
um audience: "Talk to me."
"One problem today is that
radical action is associated with a

particular generation, the gener
ation your mothers and fathers
belonged to," she said. "I want to
suggest that in order to move in a
forward direction, each genera
tion has to take up its own strug
gles. This is the challenge today."
Davis stressed the importance
of thinking critically about lead
ers. She said she was disappoint
ed with the Million Man March
because women were initially
told to stay home and take care of
the children. "I listened for
strategies to counter racism,
misogyny, homophobia, and I
don't know that I really heard
many," she said.
Davis called on the audience to
question her authority as the
leader of an older generation, and
students responded assertively.
One student questioned
Davis' objections to chauvinistic
attitudes reflected in the Million
Man March. "You deconstructed
the march, but you didn't say
what men could do to learn ... to
protect women rather than just
paying lip service [to the idea of
equality for women]," the female
student said.
