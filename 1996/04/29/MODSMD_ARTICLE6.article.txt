# Davis tells students to raise their voices

### Victoria Foster Contributing writer 
In a Friday night speech, An
gela Davis urged members of the
younger generation to make their
voices heard in social move
ments.
Davis, who drew national at
tention in the early 1970s after
she was fired from her professor
ial position at UCLA for being a
member of the Communist
Party, emphasized the impor
tance of supporting affirmative
action and "radical politics."
"Many years ago Ronald Rea
gan made a public announcement
that I would never teach at the
University of California ever
again," said Davis, who now is
the UC presidential chair in
African-American and Feminist
Studies.
Davis was the keynote speaker
for Stanford's Herstory celebra
tion.
Before Davis delivered her
speech on diversity, radical ac
tivism and affirmative action,
she told the Annenberg Auditori
um audience: "Talk to me."
"One problem today is that
radical action is associated with a

particular generation, the gener
ation your mothers and fathers
belonged to," she said. "I want to
suggest that in order to move in a
forward direction, each genera
tion has to take up its own strug
gles. This is the challenge today."
Davis stressed the importance
of thinking critically about lead
ers. She said she was disappoint
ed with the Million Man March
because women were initially
told to stay home and take care of
the children. "I listened for
strategies to counter racism,
misogyny, homophobia, and I
don't know that I really heard
many," she said.
Davis called on the audience to
question her authority as the
leader of an older generation, and
students responded assertively.
One student questioned
Davis' objections to chauvinistic
attitudes reflected in the Million
Man March. "You deconstructed
the march, but you didn't say
what men could do to learn ... to
protect women rather than just
paying lip service [to the idea of
equality for women]," the female
student said.
She then yelled at Davis that
people need to be able to find a
space within themselves where
they could feel their convictions,
rather than just saying them.
Davis commended Stanford for
keeping its affirmative action pro
grams, but warned that without
student involvement the policy
would not remain secure. "I hope
that [Stanford's preservation of
affirmative action) has something
to do with the work that you've
done on this campus. If it doesn't,
tomorrow it may be dismantled."
She likened the backlash
against affirmative action to the

conservatism of the early 1970s by
drawing parallels between her
own present and past experiences
with the UC Regents.
Davis said she recently received
a letter from UC Regent Ward
Connerly concerning the Califor
nia Civil Rights Initiative. "The
tone of letter bore a resemblance
to the anti-communism of the late
'60s. He said since I organized
class warfare in the past, 4 Now I
might be doing same with race
warfare.' "
Davis said the letter reminded
her of "the lengths people are will
ing to go to push the country back
into a horrendous era of conser
vatism." She said this conser
vatism has influenced a variety of
crucial issues, from the building of
expensive new prisons to immi

gration and race relations.
The letter, however, gave Davis
a new idea. "He accused me of par
ticipating in an organized effort to
convince students to vote against
CCRI, and when I read that I said,
'Hmm, that's a good idea. I would
very much like to see students or
ganize.' "
"I see older people who think
they have all the answers, and I
think you kind of accept that," she
added.
Finally, she encouraged people
to question what she had said. "I
don't expect you to totally accept
I my ideas]. I expect you to come up
with far more radical ideas.
Women and men. And men need
to play a much more visible and
much more dramatic role in the ef
fort to end misogyny."
