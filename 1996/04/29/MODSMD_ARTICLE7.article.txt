## LGBCC proves a safe haven for students 
### Chad Bennett Contributing writer 
For most Stanford students, winter break is a
time to relax and catch up with friends. For fresh
man Alex Sepiol, the break was a bit more life
changing. Inspired by the support and acceptance
he received as a new member of Stanford's lesbian,
gay and bisexual community, Sepiol came out to
his parents over break.
"I felt so empowered by the whole year here that
I had to tell them. It really accelerated the whole
process," said Sepiol.
Like Sepiol, freshman Esther Mecking's experi
ences as a part of Stanford's gay community have
been positive. "I have friends from other schools I
talk to. I'm like 'We're having another gay dance,'
and they're like, 'We don't have homo-hops here.
We have homo-hunts.' And that's really scary be
cause I might have ended up somewhere else. The
Stanford environment has been really support
ive."
At the center of this supportive environment is
the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
ter. According to co-coordinator Sara Sperling, the
center aims to provide a focal point for the gay com
munity, a safe place for students to hang out. Sper
ling said she sees her role as that of a mother figure
of sorts, and indeed, those who frequent the center
have dubbed Sperling, "Mama."
"It's really nice to learn from someone like
Mama who's been out and been active a little

ive environment within the gay community at Stanford.
longer than me and who has sort
of moved beyond some of those ini
tial struggles that we're all dealing
with," Meckingsaid.
A.J. Villa, a junior majoring in
economics, agreed. "I just came
out this year, so a lot of the gay life
scene is new to me. So far, it has
been pretty supportive. If you
have problems, you have ques
tions, you ask (Sperling!."
"Very few schools can say that
they have a gay and lesbian and bi
sexual community center," said
Sperling, adding, "We're really
fortunate to have this space and
also to have as much program
ming as we do."
In addition to this week's Bi
sexual, Gay, and Lesbian Aware
ness Days which include a series of
speakers and events, some of the
more regular programming in
cludes a weekly movie night.
Every Monday night at the
Women's Center, freshman
Patrick Dominguez runs a show
ing of movies dealing with gay is
sues. Past showings have included
"Go Fish" and "Fried Green
Tomatoes."
"In years past I knew that a
movie night similar to what I'm
doing existed, but this year there
wasn't one," said Dominguez. "No
one took it up. It was something I
was looking forward to when I
came to Stanford and when I
learned that it wasn't implement
ed, I decided to go ahead and take
it on myself."
Dominguez — who has hosted
as many as 45 people per showing
and as few as a handful — sees
movie night as a way to take a
break from Stanford's hectic
lifestyle. "I think a lot of times
people are so caught up in the
Stanford life, and they have a
midterm tomorrow, or they have
problems with their boyfriend or
girlfriend, and the movie night is a
time to really relax. Come down
for an hour and a half, two hours,
meet some people, sit down on the
couch and learn about the queer
community at Stanford."
Dominguez, who was quick to
point out that movie night is not
exclusively for the gay communi
ty, said the screenings often lead
to discussion. "Sometimes people
stick around and I talk to them
about the movie, what they think
about it," said Dominguez. "It
brings up a lot of issues. That can
facilitate somebody coming out or
help with problems that come up
with family. I think it's very im
portant.
"I know there's another popu
lation that's not out or that is out

but doesn't choose to participate
in the queer community, with the
center," added Dominguez. "What
I would like to do (through movie
nightl is reach out to them and
help them become a part of the
queer community — or at least
understand the reasons why
they're not a part of it."
Through programming such as
movie night, the center tries to de
construct the stereotypes sur
rounding the gay community. Ac
cording to Sperling, some people
have the mistaken notion that
those at the center just sit around
and talk about sex. "That's a big
myth," said Sperling. "That's not
what we're all about."

Very few schools can
say that they have a
gay and lesbian and
bisexual community
center. We're really
fortunate to have this
space and also to
have as much pro
gramming as we do.'

Dominguez agreed, "Some peo
ple think homosexuals are just
sexual beings, that they exist only
for sex and they're devoid of any
other feelings like compassion, de
votion, commitment, monogamy.
It's just not true."
Despite these myths, Mecking
said she feels that the perception
of Stanford's gay community is
mostly accurate.
"I haven't really come across
many misperceptions and I think
to some degree that's sort of to the
center's credit, because a lot of ac
tivities end up attracting not just
people who arc homosexual or just
people who are really, really
friendly, but just sort of anybody.
Our activities are for straight peo
ple, too, really. That's what pre
vents myths from being formed,"
said Mecking.
According to Sepiol, interaction
with Stanford's straight popula
tion has been marked by a sense of
"bemusement — not disapproval,
but not really feeling a part of it,
obviously."
"People have been really
friendly," said Sepiol. "They're
curious about gay issues and stuff
like that. I'm happy to answer any
questions they have because, for a
lot of them, I imagine I'm the first
person they've met that is gay."
Mecking's experience has been

similar. "My roommate [who is
straight] is pretty cool about it,"
said Mecking. "It's kind of funny
because she'll ask me these ques
tions — she grew up in a pretty
conservative environment, too,
and she'll ask me things like, 'Es
ther, what does 'butch' mean?' So
I end up explaining a lot. She's re
ally cool about it."
According to Villa, "In my dorm
I was in the restroom with people,
brushing our teeth, and another
guy was there and he came up and
said, 'Hey, I have a question. Are
you gay?' I said, 'Yeah,' and we were
in there for probably 10 to 15 min
utes just talkingabout mebeinggay
at like 2 in the morning."
One thing Stanford's gay com
munity has in common with the
straight community is dating —
not much of it takes place. "For a
single lesbian it's even harder, be
cause there are fewer people to
choose from," said Mecking. "And,
of course, at Stanford, every
body's busy."
Sperling cited the tight-knit na
ture of the community as one de
terrent against dating. "A lot of
people say they don't want to date
j within the community] because
everyone will talk. So people go up
to the city and meet people there
and at dances. Everybody's sort of
friends here — just not dating."
How does the current state of
gay life at Stanford compare to the
past? According to Steve Mims
and Jon Osborne, one of the first
same-sex couples to live together
in Stanford graduate student
housing, the environment is mure
open now.
"From time to time you see at
least female couples holding
hands on campus. Maybe not in
the middle of the day but, you
know, sometimes," said Mims,
who met with hostility when he
and Osborne moved into Escondi
do Village in 1990.
Osborne added that the envi
ronment seems, in general, to be
better. "When we moved in, it was
fairly hostile, and now it's just
blown over because everyone was
expecting something to happen —
the queers were there and some
thing was going to happen. Peo
ple's kids were going to disappear,
or something like that. By now,
they've figured out that nothing
has happened."
While pleased with the quality
of gay life at Stanford, Sepiol is
wary of painting a picture that is
entirely positive. "I overheard |a
friend of a hallmate] saying, 'I
guess you live in the fag hall.' It
wasn't the guy who actually lived
there who was saying things, but
he didn't stick up for me, which
sort of pissed me off. I can't expect
everyone to pick up my fight, but it
was disappointing."
