Is that a good thing? Maybe we ought to rephrase
the question: What do yon use to launch your
online adventures? If you had MSN's Custom Start
Page, all the stuff you like best and all the things
\you need most would be right there, right in front
of you. Web links and search engines, headline
news, movie previews — even comic strips.
You pick what you want and forget the rest.
www.msn.com. It's all that and, uh...more.

Our cool site is your Custom Start Page.
