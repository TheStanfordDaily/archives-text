## Stanford professor provides medical assistance in embattled country 
### Rachel Mays 
David Mohler is a man with a
mission. Since 1985, he has been
part of a special organization
that, unbeknown to the govern
ment of Myanmar, works with
the Myanmar people in medical
training and assistance. The ulti
mate goal of his work, Mohler
said, is to make the Myanmar
people self-sufficient.
"The greatest thing you can
leave is a good impression and
knowledge," said Mohler, who is
currently a surgeon at the Med
ical Center and acting assist ant
professor in the School of Medi
cine's Department of Functional
Restoration.
Mohler said the education he
received as an undergraduate at
Stanford instilled his humani
tarian interests. After graduat
ing in 1979, Mohler went on to
work in the Army Reserve as a
military surgeon. He interned at

UCLA and began working with
the International Medical Core,
a military-like organization that
worked in Afghanistan during
intense fighting in the late
1980s.
Before settling into his cur
rent job at Stanford, he became
involved with Refugee Relief In
ternational. Mohler is still in
volved with this organization,
which provides relief missions to
areas of the world involved in
armed conflict.
Mohler said he goes to Myan
mar, the Southeast Asian coun
try formerly known as Burma,
every year for two to six weeks.
He said he works primarily with
the Karen people in Myanmar.
The Karen have been under a
dictatorship for many years,
even though an overwhelming
election for democracy took place
in 1989, said Mohler. The Coun
cil of Generals believed the peo

pie weren't ready for a civilian
government and still continue to
force them into required labor.
"The government of [Myan
mar] is trying to destroy its own
people," Mohler said.
For Mohler and his colleagues,
working with the people from the
Karen region is not an easy thing
to do. "These are good people who
are having bad things done to
them," Mohler said. In order to
provide the medical care needed,
Mohler's team must sneak across
the Myanmar border into areas
controlled by guerrilla soldiers.
Mohler said that in such situa
tions, military training is a must.
Few people are qualified and pos
sess the military skills needed to
survive the arduous and clandes
tine operation.
Most Americans are unaware

that such operations even
Mohler said, because they choose
to ignore the situation. The main
problem is one of communica
tion, Mohler said. No members of
the media travel to Myanmar, so
the plight of the local people is
not reported.
The Karen people realize the
world doesn't know about them,
said Mohler. They see television
and realize they aren't on it.
Mohler acknowledged that for
American students like those at
Stanford, the deplorable condi
tions in Myanmar have no direct
impact on them. However, the
situation is still relevant, Mohler
said.
In terms of the on-campus con
troversy over supporting PepsiCo
products, junior Nick Thompson
of Stanford's Free Burma Coali
tion said PepsiCo is believed to
buy farm products made by slave
labor. Additionally, children as
young as 8 years old are forced to
work under the supervision of

armed guards.
Although PepsiCo announced
last week that it is pulling out of
Myanmar, members of the Free
Burma Coalition said PepsiCo
will continue to supply syrup to
make the drink within the coun
try.
"It's not an abstract argument
or victimless crime — for me it's
very real," said Mohler.
Mohler suggested that stu
dents educate themselves about
Myanmar through reading news
papers and watching the movie
"Beyond Rangoon." The movie
"is a fairly accurate account of
what is going on over there," said
Mohler. "There is great suffering
at the hands of the government
that is not being revealed."
In spite of such suffering,
Mohler said he is hopeful about
the future. "In the last 20 years,
there's been a general trend to
ward goodness. [There are only a
few remaining] pockets operating
in darkness and doing their evil."
