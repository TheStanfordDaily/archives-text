David Mohler is a man with a
mission. Since 1985, he has been
part of a special organization
that, unbeknown to the govern
ment of Myanmar, works with
the Myanmar people in medical
training and assistance. The ulti

said, is to make the Myanmar
people self-sufficient.

currently a surgeon at the Med

professor in the School of Medi

worked in Afghanistan during
intense fighting in the late
1980s.

which provides relief missions to
areas of the world involved in
armed conflict.

dictatorship for many years,
