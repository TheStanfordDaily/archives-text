# Court says parental notice not necessary for abortions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - As
three justices fumed over a "stealth
ful" abortion agenda, the Supreme
Court refused yesterday to revive a
South Dakota law that required
young girls to notify a parent before
ending a pregnancy.
The state law had been invalidat
ed because it did not allow most girls
to avoid telling a parent by getting a
judge's permission instead. And the
court voted 6-3 to leave those rul
ings intact.
The action was yet another sig
nal that the court, which in 1992
reaffirmed its landmark Roe vs.
Wade decision legalizing abortion, is
not eager to plunge again into that
divisive debate. The votes of four
justices are needed to grant such
review.
Sharp disagreement resurfaced
yesterday as Justices John Paul
Stevens and Antonin Scalia
exchanged statements accompany
ing the court's rejection of South
Dakota's appeal.
At issue was the standard of
review judges should use in deciding
whether an abortion law is constitu

tional before it has been enforced.
Writing for himself, Chief Jus
tice William H. Rehnquist and Jus
tice Clarence Thomas, Scalia said
the issue "virtually cries out for our
review" because of confusion in
lower courts.
He added: "Today's denial serves
only one rational purpose: It makes
our abortion ad hoc nullification
machine as stealthful as possible."
But Stevens said any asserted
confusion was based on "rigid and
unwise" and "properly ignored" lan
guage contained in an opinion
Rehnquist previously had written
for the court.
A riding on parental-notice laws
could have had substantial practical
impact. Of the more than one mil
lion legal abortions performed
annually in the United States since
1973, about 12 percent — some
100,000 a year — are for minors.
"We are pleased that the best
interests of South Dakota minors
will be protected," said Colleen Con
nell of the American Civil Liberties
Union.
But South Dakota Gov. Bill Jan

klow called the court's action
"crazy."
He said state law now requires
girls to get a parent's permission
before getting their ears pierced but
not before getting an abortion.
"That makes no sense to me at all,"
Janklow said.
And a state legislator who led the
fight for the invalidated 1993 law
promised to "go back to the drawing
board" to come up with a new
parental-notice law.
Two issues loomed in the South
Dakota case. One was whether a
state can kin abortions for unmar
ried girls under 18 — who are not
economically independent — unless
a parent is notified.
South Dakota was the only state
in the union with a one-parent noti
fication law that limited its judicial
bypass option to cases in which a
girl showed she had been abused or
neglected.
The court has not said definitive
ly whether an abortion law requir
ing notification of just one parent
needs a judicial bypass option to be
constitutional.
