# Colby dead?
## Former CIA director presumed drowned 
### 
ROCK POINT, Md. (AP) - For
mer CIA Director William Colby
was missing and presumed
drowned yesterday after what the
sheriff said was an apparent boating
accident near Colby's vacation
home.
Colby's canoe was found on a
sandbar Sunday a quarter-mile
from his home on the Wicomico
River, and divers searched the
rough and murky water for the 76-
year-old former spy master.
"Right now, we are viewing it as
an accident," Sheriff Fred Davis
said. "We're not ruling out foul
play, but we never rule out foul
play."
Colby, who headed the CIA from
1973 to 1976 under Presidents
Nixon and Ford, apparently went
canoeing late Saturday, but his
absence wasn't noticed until Sun
day night, when neighbors became
suspicious because his car was still
in the driveway. Colby usually has
returned to Washington by then.
Neighbors also said Colby, who
was not receiving any personal
security protection from the agency,
did not raise his flag on Sunday as
he had every other day.
A neighbor who checked his
home found his radio and computer
still on. Investigators found dinner
dishes on a table and clam shells in
the kitchen sink.
Davis said Colby's wife, Sally

Shelton-Colby, was out of town but
had spoken to him during the week
end. He told her he didn't feel well
but was going canoeing anyway.
Neighbors said the water was
rough Saturday and not good for
canoeing.
"I don't see why a man his age
would be out there," said neighbor
Joseph Hervey. "If I went out there
it would be in a 16- to 20-foot boat
— not canoe."
The sheriff ruled out the possi
bility of suicide.
Coast Guard crews searched the
river for more than five hours late
Sunday and most of the day yester
day before suspending their effort.
Authorities didn't know if Colby
was wearing a life-preserver.
Colby is the second high-level
CIA official to disappear in Mary
land waters.
In September 1978, a 31-foot
sloop belonging to John A. Paisley,
who had retired four years before as
deputy director of the ClA's Office
of Strategic Research, was found
unoccupied near Point Lookout,
where the Potomac River and
Chesapeake Bay meet.
Paisley's decomposed body was
found in the bay a week later,
weighted down by two diving belts
and containing a gunshot wound to
the head. Authorities said it wasn't
clear if he was murdered or commit
ted suicide.
