# Gunman had history of mental illness

PORT ARTHUR, Australia (AP) — He slept
by day, prowled by night, threatened visitors with
his beloved guns and nonchalantly cut the grass
minutes after being told of his father's drowning.
The blond man cruised Tasmania's towns in a
mustard-yellow Volvo hatchback with a surf
board strapped on top. He shared his bed with a
pet pig. He once threatened to shoot two neigh
bors who dropped by his farm and offered to buy
raspberries.
On Sunday, muttering to himself about
"WASPs" and".Japs," he rolled in to one of the
area's most popular tourist sites, unpacked auto
matic rifles from a tennis bag and started shoot
ing.
By the time he was done, at least 34 people
were dead: Some were shot down in their seats at
a tourist cafe, their forks still raised to their
mouths; others sat slumped in their cars. One lit
tle girl died struggling to hide behind a tree.
Police sources and the Australian Broadcast

ing Corp. identified the gunman as Martin
Bryant, 28, who had no criminal record but a his
tory of mental problems. He was hospitalized,
sedated and put under police guard yesterday in
the same hospital where 18 of his victims were
treated for gunshot wounds.
In the aftermath of Australia's worst modern
day massacre, workers carried the dead to a
morgue, citizens gathered for evening prayer vig
ils and police puzzled over why someone would
use assault rifles to methodically pick off victims
ranging from 3 to 72 years old.
Local media reported that Bryant had suf
fered mental problems and mood swings after a
car accident three years ago that killed the
woman with whom he was living.
But people who identified themselves as his
neighbors said his threatening behavior was
apparent since his arrival four years ago in the
farming community of Copping, outside the
southeastern Tasmanian town of Hobart.

Veina Featherstone, 41, whose property abut
ted the man's farm, said that when her husband
first went over to introduce himself, "he had a go
at my husband and told him to keep off his prop
erty or he would shoot him."
"He used to sleep all day, and walk around his
property and other people's properties at night,"
she said. "He was pretty scaiy. He fired a gun off
at night."
The man, whom neighbors called only "Mar
tin," told two women who wanted to buy rasp
berries from him as they had from the previous
owner "to get off his property and not to come
back or he would shoot them," said a local
woman.
"1 was terrified of him," said the woman, who
did not want her name used. She said that "one
minute he would be all right, and then he
wouldn't be.
"He would go off — he would be a totally dif
ferent person."
