Eating less may slow aging
WASHINGTON (AP) — Reducing calories by 30 percent appears
to slow the rate of aging in monkeys, providing new evidence that
primates, such as humans, could live longer by eating less.
A National Institutes of Health study using about 200 monkeys has
shown that a well-balanced diet that includes a sharp reduction in
calories caused the animals to have a lower body temperature, a slow
er metabolism and fewer changes in biochemical markers for aging.
"This shows that what has been demonstrated in mice also can
apply in primates," said Dr. George Roth, a scientist at the gerontol
ogy research center of the National Institute on Aging.
Roth is coauthor of a study to be published today in the Proceed

ings of the National Academy of Sciences.
