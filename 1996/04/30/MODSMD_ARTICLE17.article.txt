## Editorial Reforming elections 
### 
ASSU election rules
should be changed to
increase represention

WITH THE ASSU Spring
General Election behind
us, it's worthwhile to take
a closer look at what happened —
and perhaps propose some reforms
to ensure that the process runs
more fairly in the future.
Certainly the most noteworthy
trend is that of apathy: Many spe
cial-fee groups failed not because a
majority of voters said "no" to
their request, but because not
enough students cast votes on the
fees in the first place.
The ASSU Constitution stipu
lates that at least 15 percent of the
student body must approve any spe
cial fee for it to receive funding.
Although some have argued that
the level is arbitrary, it's a reason
able requirement — and one that
should not be changed. However,
the ASSU Senate should look into
ways to increase voter turnout.
Until three years ago, there was a
significant financial incentive to
vote: If a student wanted the right
to a special-fee refund the next year,
he had to cast a ballot. Some gradu
ate senators spearheaded a drive to
eliminate this provision with an
amendment that passed in the
spring of 1993. Even then, there
was some concern that turnout
might fall, but the proponents'
argument — that taxation without
representation was blatantly unfair
— was a compelling one.
Still, there is an important dis
tinction between a lack of represen
tation because it is simply not per
mitted and a lack of representation
because people choose not to exer
cise their right to vote. In Stan
ford's student government those
who are without representation
(excepting freshmen) are only that
way because they opt not to vote.
Fair representation is not a valid

argument for continuing to allow
anyone — regardless of whether he
or she voted — to receive a fee
refund. Rather, re-linking voting to
refunding will strongly encourage
students to vote.
This is particularly true in light
of this month's election. It now
seems likely that only a few spe
cial-fee groups will bother to ask
for funding from the graduate
population next year because of
the perception that graduate-stu
dent apathy doomed many groups
in the recent election.
Furthermore, underclassmen
can justifiably question why seniors
are permitted to vote on fees those
students will not have to pay It sim
ply doesn't seem fair for graduating
seniors to vote on those questions
while new freshmen will have to pay
fees that they never voted on. The
ASSU should look into changing
voter eligibility guidelines so that
seniors don't have the right to vote,
especially since few of them bother
to cast ballots anyway.
Problems do arise, however:
How would the ASSU know if a
student is coterming or staying an
extra quarter? Although the Uni
versity knows who plans to gradu
ate in June, determining who has
the right to vote and who doesn't
could be a nightmare.
And, if the right to a refund is
linked to voting, will freshmen —
who will inherently be unable to
vote in elections held the spring
prior to their matriculation — be
permitted to refund?
These two questions lead to
what is perhaps the most logical
reform of all — moving elections, at
least in part, to the fail. That way,
incoming freshmen, who have long
been left out of the process, would
immediately have a voice on cam
pus and the concern of senior eligi
bility would be moot.
Although Constitution '96
passed, the ASSU is still far from
perfect. When it begins meeting
next month, the new senate should
start investigating reforms such as
these in an effort to make ASSU
elections more fair.
