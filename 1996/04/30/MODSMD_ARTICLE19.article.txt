## Seeking scripted sights 
### 
c A NY RESEMBLANCE TO people
AA or events, real or imagined, is
JL jL purely coincidental." Hut often,
fiction starts with an overheard, with a bit
of conversation. Anyone and everything is
pounced upon. This quarter, some of my
friends are off on the European adventure
known as Oxford. Here's a short-short that
began from a snatch of their experiences. ..
but remember the disclaimer.
The Arc de Triomphe lay lx>yond the
Golden Arches.
The sidewalk began to clear as soon as
the rain started. Traffic down the Champs-
Ely see continued unabated, the minis
throwing up exhaust into the mist. The
couple sat in the window seat and watched
people disappear down in the Metro.
"I don't see why John Travolta com
plained about a five-dollar shake if he's
been to Paris," Andy said. "Everything's so
fucking expensive here. A shake woulda
cost 15 dollars."
He tried to settle comfortably into the
yellow plastic seat and then gave up.
Impressionist paintings and Roman tile
replaced the usual orange blandness of the
walls. A trompc I 'ocil raptured a skyscape of
clouds drilling across the blue. The hard
molded benches were the only trace of
American innovation.
"The only cool thing about McDonald's
here are the fried apple pies — none of that
baked shit from back home," Andy said. He
wiped his hand across glistening lips.
Ragged scruff spread out over his chin.

"I don't think the French are too con
cerned about their health," Kris said.
"Everyone here smokes. Except in here."
She glared up at the "pas de fumer" signs
discreetly appointed on brass placards. Kris
rolled her eyes in classic continental style.
She had come to Europe to acquire culture
and a few sophisticated bad habits.
"Yeah, well, vive la France." Andy swal
lowed the rest of the water from his polar
ized Nalgene bottle. "So, where do want to
go after lunch?"
"Let's go to the Hotel de Ville," Kris
said. She pulled out a guide to Paris, filched
from the train station. The map would
become a web of wrinkles by evening.
His fingers brushed across his orange
nylon backpack. "Why? We can't check into
hostels until afler 3 p.m.," Andy said. "We
have to carry our packs around until then."
"It's not a youth hostel." She paused,
wanting a cigarette to wave. "That's not
why I want to go there."
Andy refused to pick upon her excite
ment, leaving her poised on tilting breath.
Kris exhaled slowly, "Haveyou seen that
photo, that black-and-white one, with the
two people kissing?"
"Oh yeah, it's supposed to show how
they don't notice the whole world passing
them by." Andy smirked, his lips canting to
one side. "How deep."
"Well, there's a man in the corner of the
picture," she said.
"I don't remember him," he said.
"That's because no one does. He's wear

ing a beret and glasses." Kris wafted the
image toward herself with her right hand,
trying to remember.
"You mean, he looks like a generic
Frenchmen. Maybe that's why one notices
him. Nothing worth noticing." Andy start
ed playing pick-up sticks with the fries.
Kris looked past him, out at the crum
pled wrapper in the street. "He's not Mr.
Generic, he's a person. He doesn't notice
the camera. Suddenly, he sees himself in a
photo that's printed up everywhere, on
posters, in calendars, on cards. But no one
sees him; everyone who looks only sees the
couple."
"So why do you want to go there?" Andy
said.
"I just wanted to stand there, where he
was standing," Kris said.
"What's the point?" he said. His eyes
widened, his pupils the fat dot beneath a
question mark.
At Canterbury, they had watched ani
matronic wax figures from Chaucer's
Tales. At Stonehenge, they had looked at
the short stone monoliths from the side of
the road. At the Marienplatz, bells had
chimed as the wooden figures jerked
around in circles. These were her pursuits;
the script was always already written out
for them by someone else.

Vanessa Hua wishes you a happy May Day.
