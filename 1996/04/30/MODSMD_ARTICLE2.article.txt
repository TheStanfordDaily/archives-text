# Children's Hospital, SHS plan to merge
## Decision called favorable to both parties 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Officials at Stanford Health Services
and the Lucile Salter Packard Children's
Hospital are close to reaching an agree
ment that will combine the children's hos
pital with the Medical Center's other oper
ations.
Stuart Turgel, senior vice president for
external affairs and marketing at the hos
pital, said the two organizations "have an
agreement in principle" to merge and that
the two sides are "very encouraged that the
merger will take place."
SHS Chief Operating Officer Malinda
Mitchell stressed that the merger should
not be seen as SHS taking over the hospital,
but rather as a joint decision that both sides
consider to be favorable.
Although the hospital made the decision
to join the rest of the Medical Center,
Turgel characterized that decision as part
of the overall Stanford plan to combine
SHS, including the hospital, with the med
ical center at UC-San Francisco. Turgel
said the consolidation within Stanford was
designed to ease the way for the UCSF
merger, a move he sees as very beneficial to
the hospital.
"We like to think of [the SHS-hospital
merger] as an interim," Turgel said, ex
plaining that the parties see the Stanford
combination as part of the planned consoli

dation with UCSF.
Turgel said he does not anticipate any
major changes in the operation of the hos
pital until Stanford joins with UCSF.
"Our intention is to keep Packard intact
during the transition," Turgel explained.
"The Children's Hospital would retain its
identity and continue to operate in sub
stantially the same way."
He said there will not be major person
nel changes in the transition period and the
hospital will "continue to operate within its
own budget structure."
"We have no reason to assume [the in
ternal Stanford consolidation! will have
any effect on Packard employees" during
the transition period, Turgel said. Howev
er, restructuring of the hospital and the
rest of the Medical Center will probably
take place after the UCSF merger.
Turgel said the plan to merge SHS and
the hospital was first talked about at the
beginning of this year, when it came up in
the context of talks with UCSF. The inter
nal Stanford consolidation never came up
before the UCSF talks, he said.
Peter Van Etten, chief executive officer
of SHS, was out of town and unavailable for
comment.
Turgel said hospital officials hope that
bringing the hospital under the SHS umbrel
la "will make the discussions [with UCSF]
more efficient" by reducing the
three parties to two. SHS officials
have said in the past that they
hope for the current stage of the

UCSF negotiations to wind up this
summer.
Children's medicine is one of
the areas in which both Stanford
and UCSF are hoping their com
bined medical center will excel.
Turgel said he is looking for a
"wonderful coming together" be
tween his hospital, a state-of-the

art facility that opened in 1991,
and what he called "a very good
and solid pediatric program" at
UCSF. He said the collaboration
will "give some real focus to pedi
atrics."
"We think it's in the best inter
ests of all the patients we serve,"
Turgel added.
