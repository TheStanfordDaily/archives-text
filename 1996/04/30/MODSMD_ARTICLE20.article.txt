STS undergraduates deserve support of University

AS A JUNIOR MAJORING in Sci
ence, Technology and Society, I
was more than a little upset when
Thursday's Daily arrived at the Stanford
in Oxford house relating the news about
the end of the STS degree. The Daily arti
cle focused on a "lack of faculty support"
for the program. This issue is more com
plex than what may be a lack of interest
in the academy for this subject. Quite t he
contrary, programs emulating STS are
cropping up all over the country, and the
program is well-known for being on the
cutting edge of scholarship pertinent to
public policy in the next century.
Perhaps the real issue is one of the
University supporting the faculty in the
program. We all know how important it is
for the University to become more effi
cient with its shrinking pool of resources.
This has led to cutbacks across campus.
The STS program may be unique in that
it is an amazing program, but is very new

and lacks research support. The program
only offers undergraduate degrees, and
therefore lends itself to little or no gradu
ate research. Further, a new discipline
such as this will have few resources out
side of the Schools that support it to fund
faculty research, though research perti
nent to the program is being produced by
faculty from many different departments.
The STS program, therefore is a won
derful opportunity for undergraduate
teaching and learning. The number of
students taking STS courses, including
nearly every engineer, is enormous, and
the number of majors is growing. In fact,
at 50 undergraduates, it is a medium
sized major, particularly when compared
to several small departments in the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
STS is a hybrid, like all interdisci
plinary programs, and synthesizes a
wealth of knowledge for a challenging
and innovative course of study. But it

does not, and in the near future will not,
bring in big research bucks for the Uni
versity. In order for a program such as
this to survive, the University must
therefore maintain a commitment to
teaching the discipline. This commit
ment comes from supporting the faculty.
Faculty from several of Stanford's
schools may seek to teach for STS, and
from many perspectives. But they cannot
do so when the University does not
reward undergraduate teaching for
teaching's sake.
Ours is a relatively new university
modeled after several types of institu
tions, among them are research univer
sities and teaching colleges. The mission
of Stanford is not limited to research; it
is bound to teaching. And not just for
teaching's sake, but for preparing stu
dents to become leaders in their fields.
The STS program is a remarkable state
ment of that commitment. Because of

its timing and position at Stanford, it
could grow and become a leader in
research and scholarship in its impor
tant and new field.
Ironically, because of its timing and
position at Stanford, it could disappear. I
urge the faculty to consider the position
of students and fellow members of the
Academic Council in reconsidering this
decision. Admittedly, I am ignorant
(other than what was printed in The
Daily) as to how this decision was made.
The University should be more open with
how decisions like this are made, and as
with the Food Research Institute, solicit
input from the entire Stanford communi
ty before important decisions are final.
The Faculty Senate and the Dean of the
School of Engineering could save this
program. A commitment of funds for
teaching would have to be made.
