# Daily was correct in accepting pro-life ad

Oh dear lord! Someone at The Daily
allowed politically incorrect material to be
published. What a horrible display of free
markets, free thought and free speech.
Apparently, some at Stanford don't believe
people with dissenting opinions should be
allowed to buy ad space. Perhaps we could
simply say "piss on the Constitution" and
pass a law to limit "misleading anti-choice
propaganda"speech. People who are so
afraid of dissenting opinions are nothing
more than cowards â€” and cowards whose
political and ideological beliefs are so weak
that others' opinions scare them. I'm not a
full-blown pro-lifer, but it sickens me to see
people try to limit the speech of those they
disagree with. Such attempts are examples
of political correctness at its worst.
