Q # Does hot water freeze faster than
cold water ?
A Yeah, sometimes. In most cases,
•hot water takes longer to freeze
• than cold water. However, in some
cases, when you try to freeze equal amounts
of water that start at different tempera
tures, the hotter one will freeze first.
You'd think that the hot water should
take longer to freeze because, well, it's hot

ter than cold water. At some point during
the freezing process of hot water, it should
pass through the same temperature that
the colder water started out from. So, if it
takes 10 minutes for the hot water to cool
down to the temperature the cold water
started at, then shouldn't it take 10 minutes
longer for the hot water to freeze? All those
physicists and chemists say that you can't
skip temperatures, so the cold water should
freeze first, right?
If it really is possible to get hot water to
freeze before cold water under the same
conditions, then the physicists and chemists
of the world would be pretty screwed.
They'd all have to quit their jobs and go
back to school to study something a little
more consistent — something like philoso
phy or Constitutional law.
Well, lucky for them, there is an explana
tion that may save their aireers. The basic
reasoning lies in the fact that the freezing
process depends on more than just temper
ature. Two other factors have major effects
on the way the water will freeze — evapora
tion and the amount of water.

liet's consider how the amount of water
affects the rate at which it freezes. Imagine
you have a small drop of water and a gallon
of water at the same temperature. Which
one freezes first? Obviously the drop of
water will freeze a long time before the gal
lon does. But why?
First, you have to understand the differ
ence between temperature and heat. I leat is
a form of energy that is transferred between
two objects. Temperature is an indicator of
which direction this type of energy will flow
when two objects arc brought together. As
you probably know, heat spontaneously
flows from the object with the higher tem
perature to the object with the lower tem
perature.
The relation between the change in tem
perature and the amount of heat trans
ferred to or from an object depends on mul
tiple factors. The one we want to consider is
the mass of the object. The more mass an
object has, the more heat needs to be trans
ferred to change its temperature.
Consider the drop of water again.
There's definitely a lot less water in a drop

than there is in a gallon. To lower the tem
perature of the drop to its freezing point,
only a little bit of heat needs to be taken
away from it. However, if the same amount
of heat were taken away from the gallon of
water, the temperature wouldn't drop near
ly as much.
What happens when you freeze hot
water is that a lot of the water evaporates.
Not only does evaporation carry off the hot
ter molecules of water, but it also reduces
the amount of water present. The higher
the temperature of the water, the more
water evaporates.
The way hot water can freeze faster than
cold water is by evaporating off a lot of the
water while it is hot. By doing so, there is
less hot water to freeze, so the water doesn't
have to lose as much heat to freeze. If you
set it up just right, you can get the hot water
to lose enough mass to make up for its high
er temperature and get it to freeze first.
However, although hot water may freeze
first, you get less ice than from freezing the
same amount of cold water.
The cateh, though, is that the cold water

can't be that cold. A more accurate way of
answering this question would be to say
that hot water freezes faster than warm
water. As an activity, you can go back
through this article and cross out the word
"cold" each time it appears and replace it
with "warm." Don't do it on this paragraph,
though. If you do, it probably won't make
any sense.
One other factor which plays a smaller
role in the freezing process is that more air
is dissolved in the cold water than in the hot
water. Cold water am hold more gas than
warmer water can. The dissolved air lowers
the freezing point of the cold water past 0
degrees Celsius. It's a lot like how anti
freeze lowers the freezing point of the water
in your air radiator and how salt lowers the
freezing point of water on the roads.
So, not only does the hot water need to
freeze less water, but it also doesn't have to
get as cold.
Now, that was a good question.
