## Gender and equity: What's fair today? 
### 
News of Marianne Stan
ley's departure to coach
the women's basketball
team at Cal met with mixed re
actions here at Stanford last
week.
Though it was sad to see
Stanley go — while serving as
co-head coach for the Stanford
women in Tara VanDerveer's
absence, she helped guide the
Cardinal to a 29-3 record and a

Final Four appearance — all
those associated with the
women's basketball program
were happy to witness the reju
venation of her career.
Moreover, Cal's hiring of
Stanley was universally ac
claimed in the media as a great
act of courage. Writers such as
the San Jose Mercury-News'
Ann Killion praised Cal for tak
ing a bold step, for being a
leader, for doing the "right
thing."
So what's all the fuss about?
Well, if you haven't been keep
ing up with her saga, you might
be surprised to learn that Stan
ley — an 18-year veteran of
coaching who has been to 10
women's Final Fours and won

three national championships
— elicited virtually no interest
after sending out 100-plus re
sumes to colleges in the past 2
1/2 years.
That's because Stanley has
been black-listed since 1993,
when she was dismissed from
her post as USC's women's head
coach after demanding equal
pay to that of the school's men's
coach. To add to the controver
sy, Stanley filed an $8 million
lawsuit against the school, a
case which is still pending.
Now, there's no question
that both Cal and Stanford took
risks in hiring Stanley. But
through this entire story, the
one question that has been re
peatedly ignored by the media is
perhaps the one question that
matters most.
Does Stanley really deserve
equal pay?
The answer is anything but
easy, but I think it's one that
needs to be explored. At Cal,
Stanley will be making the same
base pay — $110,000 — as
men's head coach Todd Boze
man (though reportedly Boze
man pulls down a tidv sum from
summer basketball camps,
sponsorships, etc.). But all that
means is that the issue of gen
der equity will continue to be ig
nored.
The closest thing to an even
handed solution to this dilemma
might be one that I heard from
my dad: women deserve to be
paid the same as men for doing
