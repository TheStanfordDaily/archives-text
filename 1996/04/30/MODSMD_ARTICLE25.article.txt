## Gender and equity: What's fair today? 
### 
News of Marianne Stan
ley's departure to coach
the women's basketball
team at Cal met with mixed re
actions here at Stanford last
week.
Though it was sad to see
Stanley go — while serving as
co-head coach for the Stanford
women in Tara VanDerveer's
absence, she helped guide the
Cardinal to a 29-3 record and a

Final Four appearance — all
those associated with the
women's basketball program
were happy to witness the reju
venation of her career.
Moreover, Cal's hiring of
Stanley was universally ac
claimed in the media as a great
act of courage. Writers such as
the San Jose Mercury-News'
Ann Killion praised Cal for tak
ing a bold step, for being a
leader, for doing the "right
thing."
So what's all the fuss about?
Well, if you haven't been keep
ing up with her saga, you might
be surprised to learn that Stan
ley — an 18-year veteran of
coaching who has been to 10
women's Final Fours and won

three national championships
— elicited virtually no interest
after sending out 100-plus re
sumes to colleges in the past 2
1/2 years.
That's because Stanley has
been black-listed since 1993,
when she was dismissed from
her post as USC's women's head
coach after demanding equal
pay to that of the school's men's
coach. To add to the controver
sy, Stanley filed an $8 million
lawsuit against the school, a
case which is still pending.
Now, there's no question
that both Cal and Stanford took
risks in hiring Stanley. But
through this entire story, the
one question that has been re
peatedly ignored by the media is
perhaps the one question that
matters most.
Does Stanley really deserve
equal pay?
The answer is anything but
easy, but I think it's one that
needs to be explored. At Cal,
Stanley will be making the same
base pay — $110,000 — as
men's head coach Todd Boze
man (though reportedly Boze
man pulls down a tidv sum from
summer basketball camps,
sponsorships, etc.). But all that
means is that the issue of gen
der equity will continue to be ig
nored.
The closest thing to an even
handed solution to this dilemma
might be one that I heard from
my dad: women deserve to be
paid the same as men for doing

the same job. By that logic, Stan
ley should receive equal pay if she
is judged to be doing the same job
or one of equal value — as the
men's coach, in this case Boze
man.
So are they doing the same job?
Pew will argue against the state
ment that the men's game and the
women's game are a world apart
when it comes to college hoops. The
men are bigger, stronger, faster,
quicker. They leap higher and far
ther than the women. In most
cases, the men's game is also more
up-tempo. And there is the obvious
point that the men's game attracts
more fans, generates more revenue
and produces more media interest.
With that line of reasoning, it's
easy to build a case that the coach
es of men's teams should be paid
more than those of women's
teams. After all, these coaches
deal with greater pressure from
fans and media alike, they must
often recruit more intensely for
blue-chip prospects and they sim
ply hold a higher-profile position
on campus.
But that doesn't always have to
be case. Women's basketball is
growing at a tremendous rate, as
are most collegiate women's
sports. And even with the imple
mentation of Title IX, most
women's sports and the individual
female athletes that play them
simply don't receive enough recog
nition. Not only is this lack of re
spect unfair to female athletes, it
has deprived generations of young
girls from having female role mod
els to emulate in the world of
sports.
Just look right here on campus

— until just recently, the women's
team consistently drew larger
crowds to Maples Pavilion than
the men's squad. Even now, the
women produce almost as much
newspaper ink as the men. So
who's not to make the case that
the women's head coach should be
paid more than that of the men's
team?
There's really no simple an
swer. But I think it comes down
to a case-by-case basis. If the head
coach of the women's team is just
as talented, and judged to be
doing a job just as important and
just as valuable as that of the
men's head coach, then he or she
should be paid equally. Other
wise, that individual should be
paid accordingly. To say that men
and women should be paid equal
ly under all circumstances is un
reasonable.
Is that fair? In a country where
women's basketball hasn't yet
achieved the recognition that per
haps it deserves, maybe it's not.
Maybe that's only to punish
women's coaches for being in
volved in a field that is already
handicapped.
At Cal, Marianne Stanley will
work towards reviving a sagging
women's program and turning it
into a national contender. If any
one can do it, Stanley certainly
can. But does that mean Stanley
deserves equal pay to t hat of Todd
Bozeman, who has helped elevate
the men's program to national
prominence over the past few
years?
1 don't know. Maybe she de
serves less, maybe she deserves
the same. Maybe based on her cre
dentials and the task at hand, she
deserves more.
Like I said, there's no simple
solution. But let's at least talk
about it.
