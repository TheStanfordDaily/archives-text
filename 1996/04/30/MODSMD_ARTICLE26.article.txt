# Sophomore Scott shines in Ojai
## No. 3 singles player pulls off string of upsets to win tourney 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
At the Pacific 10 Conference championships in
Ojai, Calif, this weekend, Stanford sophomore
Julie Scott found exactly what she was looking for
— a Pac-10 singles title and an almost certain berth
in the NCAA singles tournament in May.
Scott, the No. 5 player in the Cardinal women's
tennis lineup, downed USC's Karolina Baklarova
yesterday to capture the Pac-10 singles champi
onship in a three-set final, 6-7, 6-1, 6-2.
Scott's crown will most likely translate into a
spot in the NCAA singles draw next month in Tala
hassee, Fla. The Pac-10 championships serve as an
opportunity for players to make a final argument
for a spot in the draw, and Scott's performance will
be difficult to ignore.
"My intentions were just to make it into individ
uals, into NCAAs," Scott said. "My ranking wasn't
high enough to get me in, so I just wanted to get a
chance to play some of the No. Is, No. 2s and No. 3s
from other schools, so I could get some decent wins.
"I definitely exceeded that. I wasn't really ex
pecting to go in and win it."
Previous to the final against Scott, Baklarova
was having her way with Stanford. In dual-match
competition, the 77th-ranked Trojan had beaten
both junior Sandra De Silva and senior Kim Shas
by, the two players who play directly in front of
Scott in the Stanford lineup at the No. 3 and 4 po
sitions.
In the semifinals, Scott ironically collided with
De Silva, last year's singles champion, to vie for the
right to play for the title. Scott, 20-1 in dual-match
play this season, took De Silva in a three-set
thriller, 4-6, 6-1, 7-5.
Scott earned perhaps her most impressive win in
the quarterfinals against Arizona State's No. 1
player, Reka Cseresnyes. Scott rolled over the
third-seeded Sun Devil in straight sets, 6-4, 6-1.
In the first two rounds, Scott defeated both Kori
Sosnowy from Washington and Ditta Huber from
USC in straight sets. The Cardinal sophomore has
