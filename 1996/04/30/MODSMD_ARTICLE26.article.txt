# Sophomore Scott shines in Ojai
## No. 3 singles player pulls off string of upsets to win tourney 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
At the Pacific 10 Conference championships in
Ojai, Calif, this weekend, Stanford sophomore
Julie Scott found exactly what she was looking for
— a Pac-10 singles title and an almost certain berth
in the NCAA singles tournament in May.
Scott, the No. 5 player in the Cardinal women's
tennis lineup, downed USC's Karolina Baklarova
yesterday to capture the Pac-10 singles champi
onship in a three-set final, 6-7, 6-1, 6-2.
Scott's crown will most likely translate into a
spot in the NCAA singles draw next month in Tala
hassee, Fla. The Pac-10 championships serve as an
opportunity for players to make a final argument
for a spot in the draw, and Scott's performance will
be difficult to ignore.
"My intentions were just to make it into individ
uals, into NCAAs," Scott said. "My ranking wasn't
high enough to get me in, so I just wanted to get a
chance to play some of the No. Is, No. 2s and No. 3s
from other schools, so I could get some decent wins.
"I definitely exceeded that. I wasn't really ex
pecting to go in and win it."
Previous to the final against Scott, Baklarova
was having her way with Stanford. In dual-match
competition, the 77th-ranked Trojan had beaten
both junior Sandra De Silva and senior Kim Shas
by, the two players who play directly in front of
Scott in the Stanford lineup at the No. 3 and 4 po
sitions.
In the semifinals, Scott ironically collided with
De Silva, last year's singles champion, to vie for the
right to play for the title. Scott, 20-1 in dual-match
play this season, took De Silva in a three-set
thriller, 4-6, 6-1, 7-5.
Scott earned perhaps her most impressive win in
the quarterfinals against Arizona State's No. 1
player, Reka Cseresnyes. Scott rolled over the
third-seeded Sun Devil in straight sets, 6-4, 6-1.
In the first two rounds, Scott defeated both Kori
Sosnowy from Washington and Ditta Huber from
USC in straight sets. The Cardinal sophomore has

now strung together 16 straight
singles victories. Iler last loss
came at California in early
March.
"I think I'm at the top of my
game t bis year," Scott said. "I've
been playing a lot better than
last season. The perfect time to
be doing that is in about two
weeks [at NCAAs|, but it's a
good start. Since 1 have been
here, this is the most confident
I've been in my game."
Despite the hot streak, Scott
welcomes the hiatus before the
NCAA tournament.
"I think it will be good to have
a break emotionally," said the
Cardinal sophomore. "Also,
there are a few things in my
game that I want to work on. I'm
glad we have a couple of weeks

off."
Despite her success against
some of the top Pac-10 players,
Scott knows better than to un
derestimate her competition at
the No. 5 position.
"It does give me confidence in
a way," she said. "But you have
to take it with a grain of salt. 1
just have to focus on the match
es that I have at No. 5.
De Silva brought some mo
mentum of her own into the
match with Scott. Her three
wins all came in straight sets,
highlighted by a quarterfinal
triumph over USC's Nicole Lon
don, 6-1, 6-1. De Silva and Lon
don met just last week at Stan
ford in a tight three-set match
which De Silva also won.
De Silva also defeated Ore
gon's Allison Sosnow and Ari
zona's Karen Goldstein.
Shasby cruised in her first -
round matchup with Oregon's
Caryn Coyle, only to meet Wild

cat Betsy Miringhoff in the sec
ond round. Miringhoff had
taken two of three from De Silva
this season in dual-match com
petition, and continued to have
success against the Cardinal,
i>< ;it iii); Shasby, 2-6, 7-6,6-1.
Stanford's final representa
tive in the draw did not receive
the most 112 avorable of matchups.
Senior Amy Chiminello found
herself opposite the net from the
top-ranked and top-seeded
Vicky Maes from Arizona. Maes
advance with a 6-3, 6-2 win.
Hot li Stanford doubles teams
made strong pushes for NCAA
tournament consideration as
well. The No. 2 and No. 3 Cardi
nal tandems reached the semifi
nals in their respective brack
ets.
The second doubles squad,
Scott and Shasby, upset the top
seeded doubles team in the
draw, USC's London and Suzie
Italiano, in the quarterfinals, 6-

4, 6-2. However, in the semis,
California's No. I duo of Aman
da Augustus and Francesca
La'O proved to be too much for
the Cardinal, 6-3, 6-4.
On the other side of the draw,
the third doubles team of junior
Emily Burt and senior Beth
Berris defeated squads from
USC and Arizona on their way to
a battle with the sixth-ranked
doubles team in the nation,
UCLA's Keri Phebus and Paige
Yaroshuk. Burt and Berris hung
tough with the Bruins but even
tually fell, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2.
The No. 2 Cardinal (22-1
overall, 10-0 Pac-10 Southern
Division) now have three weeks
to prepare for the NCAA cham
pionships held in Talahassee,
Fla., the week of May 18. The
squad brings a 12-match win
streak into the tournament. The
only Cardinal loss of the season
came at the hands of the No. 1
Florida Gators.
