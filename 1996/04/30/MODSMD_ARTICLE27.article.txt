# Cardinal sluggers endure winless weekend
## 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The Stanford softball team will
spend the greater part of this week
trying to recuperate from the
wounds it sustained in battle last
weekend against the Arizona
schools. The Cardinal suffered four
losses this weekend to drop to 23-
24 overall, 6-14 in the Pacific 10
Conference. Arizona State took
two games from Stanford on Satur
day (winning 2-1 and 7-1), and the
Wildcats of Arizona added two
more losses to the Cardinal's
record on Sunday with 6-3 and 9-0
victories.
The Cardinal's best showing on
the weekend was its first game
against the Wildcats. Arizona, cur
rently No. 2 in the nation, had de
feated Stanford twice before and
was looking to continue its winning
ways against the Cardinal.
"Arizona came out kind of flat,"
said head coach Sandy Pearce. "It
was good for us because it gave us a
chance to get into the game. We
fought really well and played
hard."
Even fiat, the Wildcats jumped
out to a 5-0 lead after three innings
on two walks, six hits, a sacrifice
and one Stanford error. The Cardi
nal bats pounded back in the bot
tom of the fourth, however, to score
one and cut the lead to four.
Freshman Michelle Acosta got
the offensive drive underway with
a one-out single. The next batter,
freshman Michelle Schneider,
reached base on when a pitch that

struck her squarely in the elbow,
and another wild pitch from pitch
er Carrie Dolan moved the runners
into scoring position for junior

Summer Lee. Lee successfully
scored Acosta from third on a deep
sacrifice flv to give the Cardinal its
first run.

Arizona put one more run on the
board in the top of the sixth, but

games to both Arizona and Arizona State last weekend.
