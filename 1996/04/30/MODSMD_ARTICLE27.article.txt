# Cardinal sluggers endure winless weekend
## 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The Stanford softball team will
spend the greater part of this week
trying to recuperate from the
wounds it sustained in battle last
weekend against the Arizona
schools. The Cardinal suffered four
losses this weekend to drop to 23-
24 overall, 6-14 in the Pacific 10
Conference. Arizona State took
two games from Stanford on Satur
day (winning 2-1 and 7-1), and the
Wildcats of Arizona added two
more losses to the Cardinal's
record on Sunday with 6-3 and 9-0
victories.
The Cardinal's best showing on
the weekend was its first game
against the Wildcats. Arizona, cur
rently No. 2 in the nation, had de
feated Stanford twice before and
was looking to continue its winning
ways against the Cardinal.
"Arizona came out kind of flat,"
said head coach Sandy Pearce. "It
was good for us because it gave us a
chance to get into the game. We
fought really well and played
hard."
Even fiat, the Wildcats jumped
out to a 5-0 lead after three innings
on two walks, six hits, a sacrifice
and one Stanford error. The Cardi
nal bats pounded back in the bot
tom of the fourth, however, to score
one and cut the lead to four.
Freshman Michelle Acosta got
the offensive drive underway with
a one-out single. The next batter,
freshman Michelle Schneider,
reached base on when a pitch that

struck her squarely in the elbow,
and another wild pitch from pitch
er Carrie Dolan moved the runners
into scoring position for junior

Summer Lee. Lee successfully
scored Acosta from third on a deep
sacrifice flv to give the Cardinal its
first run.

Arizona put one more run on the
board in the top of the sixth, but

games to both Arizona and Arizona State last weekend.
Stanford roared back in the bottom
of the inning. Freshman Marcy
Crouch got things underway with a
leadoff walk. Acosta followed
Crouch with her third hit of the
day, and then Schneider scored
Crouch on an RBI single.
Lee drew a walk to load the bases
for freshman Shane Anderson. An
derson, who earlier in the game
saved a Wildcat grand slam by mak
ing a fantastic catch as she crashed
through the centerfield fence, sin
gled to score one more for the Car
dinal. Stanford managed to bring
the winning run to the plate in the
seventh, but was unable to capital
ize on the position, giving Arizona
the fi-3 victory.
The second game was a night
mare for the Cardinal. Stanford lost
the game 9-0, managed only one hit
and committed four errors. In that
contest, injury and sickness forced
the Cardinal to use three pitchers,
three second basemen and three
right fielders. If Stanford had lost
one more player, the coaching staff
might have been compelled to
search the stands for a replacement.
"Arizona is just a really good
team," Fearce said. "They make
you make errors because they come
right at you. (Against Arizona
State] we weren't able to capitalize.
We beat [the Sun Devils] in Ari
zona, so it was frustrating."
In Stanford's two games against
the Sun Devils, the Cardinal outhit
ASU 14-11, butcommittedeighter
rors to ASU's one. In the first con
test, the Sun Devils scored two un
earned runs off Crouch in the first
inning. Stanford's defense settled
down and played solidly for the re
mainder of the game, but the Cardi
nal only managed one run in the 2-
1 loss. In the second game Stan
ford's defense was even more atro
cious, as the squad committed
seven errors in the 7-1 beating.
