# Women's water polo qualifies for nationals
## 
### Erin Bryla Contributing writer 
The west coast qualification
tournament for the women's
water polo national champi
onships provided the stage not
only for Stanford to earn a berth
In the national tournament, but
also to see undefeated UCIA fall
at the hands of Cal.
Stanford won three out of five
games this weekend, only losing
to No. 1 UCTiA and No. 3 San
Diego State.
Stanford's first game against
UC-Davis proved to be a competi
tive match for the Cardinal. Stan
ford struggled to keep Davis at bay
throughout the first half, but
came out in the second half and
put the game away. The Cardinal
outscored the Aggies 5-3, dupli
cating the score from the team's
last game against Davis.
The Cardinal next faced Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo and had a

little trouble with a team that
should have been a pushover.
Stanford scored only three goals
by half time before bombarding
San Luis with IS second-half
goals. The Cardinal may have
stumbled in the early going, but
did not fall as it pulled off the 16-5
victory.
Having defeated all the teams
in its bracket, the Cardinal en
sured itself a spot in the quarterfi
nals against USC, which finished
second in its bracket.
The Cardinal went in against
USC as a heavy favorite in the
game that would guarantee them
a place in the national tourna
ment — the top flix finishers from
the qualifier advance. The Cardi
nal dominated the Trojans, but
would still like to improve on the
victory.
<f We played pretty well. Overall
I was happy with the team but I
am always looking for ways to im
prove," said head coach Ben Quit
tner.
The 12-2 win over USC was
enough to put the Cardinal in the
semifinals against top-ranked
UCLA.
However, the Bruins ended the
Cardinal's winning ways, showing
the young Cardinal team just why
they were the No. 1 team in the na
tion. Stanford attempted to hang
with UCI.A, but the Bruins seemed
to capitalize on all of the mistakes
that the Cardinal made. The Cardi
nal fell 7-1, with the lone goal coming
from the outstanding play of fresh
man Lindsay Welsh.
Stanford's loss dropped them into
the consolation match against San
Diego State, which had been upset by
Cal in the other semifinal game. The
teams traded goals for the early parts
of the first half. The Cardinal had to
go to its bench in the second half, but
came through to tie the game at the
end of regulation. The 6-6 game went
into two overtimes as the squad con
tinued to answer each of Sim Diego's
goals. I lowever, the Cardinal fell just
short of pulling the upset and lost 8-
7.
"This w;is probably the most ex
citing game I have seen 112 rom us. The
Stanford team played its guts out,"
said Quittner.
