tournament for the women's
water polo national champi

Stanford won three out of five
games this weekend, only losing
to No. 1 UCTiA and No. 3 San

Stanford scored only three goals
by half time before bombarding
San Luis with IS second-half
goals. The Cardinal may have
stumbled in the early going, but
did not fall as it pulled off the 16-5
victory.
Having defeated all the teams
in its bracket, the Cardinal en
sured itself a spot in the quarterfi
nals against USC, which finished
second in its bracket.

USC as a heavy favorite in the
game that would guarantee them
a place in the national tourna

the qualifier advance. The Cardi

would still like to improve on the
victory.
