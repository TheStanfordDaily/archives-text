After checking each of their re
spective itineraries, members of
the Stanford track and field team
saw that they were to be split up
and sent to different parts of the
country last weekend to partici
pate in a series of invitational re
lays.
The Cardinal flight plan includ
ed the Penn Relays at the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, the Drake
Relays at the University of lowa
and the California / Nevada State
Championships at the University
of California at Davis.
With qualifications for the Pa
cific 10 Conference champi
onships mostly wrapped up at the
Mount San Antonio College Re
lays, there was littlepressure on
the Stanford athletes. The Cardi
nal is only one man and four
women away from qualifyinga full
complement of 24 men and 24
women for the Pac-lOs.
"Last week at the Mt. SAC, we
got all our qualifying that we had
to get done. Everybody we needed
to qualify is pretty much set," said
head coach Vin Lananna. "We felt
this [weekend] would be a good di
version."
The Cardinal athletes, there
fore, ran for glory, which they cer
tainly got.
Running in front 0f40,000 fans
at the 102 nd Penn Relays, the
Stanford women's 4 x 1,500 relay
team, composed of senior Dena
Dey, junior Monal Chokshi,

sophomore Sarna Renfro and
freshman Mary Cobb, blazed into
second place, just a step behind

The second-place finish was the
best showing in any event ever for
Stanford at the prestigious Penn
Relays, where the most talented
track and field schools across the
country participate in the festivi
ties.
The women's distance medley
team also shone in Philadelphia.
Senior Monica Hoggat ran with
Dey, Chokshi and Cobb to capture
fourth place in the finals.
In the individual perfor

in fifth place in the open 10,000,
with a NCAA provisional-qualify

Meanwhile, at the Drake Re
lays in Des Moines, lowa, a second
women's distance medley relay
team was also making a name for
itself. Junior Leila Burr and
sophomores Heather Miller, Kort
ney Dunscombe and Sara Moore
finished in a solid fifth place.
Their male counterparts —
sophomore Jonathan Weldon,
freshman Jake Maas and juniors
Jason Lunn and Tad Heath —
came in fourth.
Pete Swanson showed he is
close to 100 percent when he
threw the discus 177 feet, just 1
foot and 10 inches shy of the
NCAA automatic-qualifying
mark. Lananna is not too con
