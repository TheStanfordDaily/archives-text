# Physicist Cox dead at 58

### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
Radiological physicist Richard Severin Cox died
of a heart attack April 20, ending his 18-year ca
reer in the Department of Radiation Oncology at
the School of Medicine.
Cox, 58, was internationally known for his ad
vanced work in stereotactic radiotherapy.
He worked to expand the uses of a linear accel
erator — which produces a beam of electrons that,
when projected onto a stationary target, allows
study of the structure of the target's matter — to
treat brain tumors. During his tenure at Stanford,
he adapted the accelerator process at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center to be used in a medical
setting.
"His concern for others motivated him to use
his immense knowledge of physics in actual pa
tient care," said Radiation Oncology Prof. Emeri
tus Malcolm Bagshaw, former chair of the de
partment. "He was the man behind the scenes
that allowed the doctors to do what they needed
to do."
Cox extended his role at Stanford beyond
physics. Combining his interests in computer sci
ence and statistics, he developed a computer sys
tem to follow patients' progress before such soft
ware was available to the public.
Despite his accomplishments, people close to
Cox said he had a down-to-earth personality.
"He was brilliant," longtime companion Patsy
Cox said, "but chose to make everyone his equal.

He made friends with people from all walks of life."
Cox was always willing to speak with friends
and colleagues, rarely closing the door to his office
while he worked. "No one I know is that accessi
ble," Bagshaw said. "He interrupts what he is
doing to share knowledge with doctors and resi
dents."
At the time of his death, Cox was in the process
of being promoted to associate professor at the
Medical School. He taught residents at Stanford
Hospital, published 97 articles for medicine jour
nals and often lectured at national and interna
tional meetings. Cox was also a member of the
American Physical Society, the American Associa
tion of Physicists in Medicine and the Radiation
Research Society.
According to his eldest son Randall, he was
"somebody who had the answer to everything and
was usually right. He was good at giving me a di
rection through school and through life. He was
not only my father but really my mentor."
Cox was born and raised in the Chicago area and
earned a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth Col
lege and master's and doctorate degrees in nuclear
physics from Northwestern University. Before
joining Stanford's faculty, Cox worked at the Uni
versity of Kansas, William Marsh Rice University
and the University of Texas.
To Patsy Cox, Richard Cox was an ordinary per
son with extraordinary qualities. "There are few
people I've ever met who loved people and loved to
make people happy," she added. "The glass was al
ways half full to him. He loved life."
