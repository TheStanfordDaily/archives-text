# URO grant applications increase

### Angel Flores 
Applications for undergradu
ate research grants this year in
creased by 9 percent from last
year, reaching a total of 460.
The increase from last year's
422 applications can be explained
partially because more depart
ments are encouraging students
to do honors theses, according to
Laura Selznick, director of Under
graduate Research Opportunities.
"More students are also more
aware of the grants," Selznick
said. "If a student knows someone
who has been through the appli
cation process, they are more
comfortable applying."
The number of fall- and win
ter-quarter applications amount
ed to 330, and the spring-quarter
requests numbered 130, for a
total of 460 applications this year.

Of those turned in during the
spring, 100 came from students
who wished to use their funds on
biology laboratory work. This
year, more small grants were
awarded than ever before,
Selznick said.
The program saw fewer applica
tions in winter quarter.
Applicants from the fall quar
ter usually use their funds for the
whole year, Selznick said. Those
from the spring usually make use
of the funds during the summer
and the following year. Those who
apply in winter quarter are many
times students who have missed
the process during the fall or
somehow unexpectedly came up
short with their own funds,
Selznick said. Having a low num
ber in the winter means that stu
dents are starting their research
work earlier in the year.

"The small number of appli
cants for the winter is a good indi
cation," Selznick said. "The pur
pose of these grants is for students
to begin their entrepreneurial skills
and make contact with the faculty."
The amounts of small grants
can vary between $50 and $500,
while the large grants can reach a
maximum of $2,500. The larger
grants are unique in that they
allow for summer living expenses.
They are also screened and ranked
by the individual departments,
while the smaller ones are re
viewed administratively.
"Every year since spring of
1985 when the program started
funding, we have had a slow but
steady increase" in the number of
applicants, Selznick said.
Applicants will receive e-mail
regarding their awards on May
24.
