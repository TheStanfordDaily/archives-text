# PepsiCo pulls out of Myanmar
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
In an apparent about-face, PepsiCo, responding to
nationwide boycotts and protests over its investments
in Myanmar, confirmed late last week that it will no
longer invest in its Myanmar bottling operation.
But students warn that this move is meant to con
trol the bad publicity that PepsiCo has received over its
investments. They say that while PepsiCo has pulled
out of its most visible investment in Myanmar — the
country in Southeast Asia formerly known as Burma
— it still maintains close economic links with the mili
tary dictatorship there.
Junior Nick Thompson, a member of Students for
Environmental Action at Stanford, said PepsiCo's

strategy is "cynical" and "is trying to trick activists by
meeting only one of four demands."
"Pepsi will continue to license its trademark name
and products in Burma and will continue to sponsor
SLORC events, and they may promote the SLORC at
trade shows," Thompson said, referring to the military
regime in Myanmar which has refused to recognize the
democratically-elected government and has reportedly
subjected many of its citizens to forced labor.
"Pepsi will still be making money in Burma, and it
will necessarily be connected with slave labor," he
added.
At Stanford, PepsiCo's announcement is of particu
lar concern to students who fought to keep Taco Bell, a
PepsiCo subsidiary, out of Tresid
der Union. The action nullifies a re
cently passed ASSU bill that sus
pended ASSU patronage of corpo
rations with direct investments in
Myanmar.
Council of Presidents member
Nicole Vazquez said the ASSU boy
cott, as it is currently worded,
would end with PepsiCo's decision

to pull out of its bottling operation.
As a result, SEAS and the cam
pus group Students Against Geno
cide hope to petition the ASSU to
strengthen the language of the res
olution.
'The original language in the
boycott was weak, so now PepsiCo
has gotten around it," Vazquez
said.
"That's because the bill was
based on the original language of
the petition that we circulated,"
Thompson said.
But while there might be some

procedural hurdles to passing a
stricter boycott like those passed
by the cities of San Francisco,
Oakland and Berkeley, Thomp
son said he is confident that a new
resolution could be introduced
quickly, perhaps by the end of the
quarter.
Thompson said he is pleased
with what student action has ac
complished on the issue.
"We accomplished much of what
we wanted — we put lots of pres
sure on PepsiCo, whose sharehold
ers' meeting is in two days."
