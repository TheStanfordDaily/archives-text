Keynote speaker Mandy Carter
addressed the rise of the radical
right, society's pervading sense of
homophobia and a campaign to end
Jesse Helms' days in the U.S. Sen
ate in a speech last night kicking off
Stanford's Bisexual, Gay and Les
bian Awareness Days celebration.
"Who knew that in the '90s we
would see an onslaught of such
magnitude of the radical right,"
Carter said.
Carter, a longtime grassroots
political activist for black and les
bian, gny and bisexual issues, fo
cused her speech on politics and the

mobilization of the gay vote in this
year's election.
Carter was the director of a joint
project between the Human Rights
Campaign Fund and the Black Gay
and Lesbian Leadership Forum.
She is currently heading North
Carolina's Mobilization '96, a
grassroots campaign to defeat Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
"We have to get Jesse Helms
out; there are no ifs, ands or buts
about it," Carter said.
"The only way to get rid of
Jesse Helms is through the ballot
box," Carter said. "To get rid of
him would be the greatest gift we
could give to this country — in

fact, to this world."
Prior to the November 1994 gu
bernatorial elections, Carter said,
the amount of visibility of the gay
community was rising exponential
ly-
"Then November 1994 came,
and what I was struck by was that
the right now also had control of
Congress," Carter said. "I thought,
and a lot of people thought, that
this was going to have to be the nail
in the coffin of the gay and lesbian
liberation movement in this coun
try."
Carter cited examples such as
Proposition 187 and the California
Civil Rights Initiative as manifes
tations of the right's strategy of
"divide and conquer."
"When you get the right emo
tional climate, you can pit people
against each other all the time,"
she said.

According to Carter, the right
has been working to engender divi
siveness along racial and gender
lines in its endeavors to "legalize
bigotry and legalize hatred."
"It's like walking down a road
together, on the road of struggle,"
Carter said. "The struggle for
equality goes beyond just our ori
entation."
Carter asserted the power of the
individual to effect change in current
public policy and society. Activism,

she said, am often be undertaken by
simply saying, "I don't want to hear
that around me anymore."
Carter continually sounded
notes of optimism throughout her
speech.
"The radical right underesti
mates the common decency of the
people," she said. "Everyone, gay
or straight, no matter, has a role in
terms of what we look forward to in
the future. I'm very hopeful and
very optimistic."
