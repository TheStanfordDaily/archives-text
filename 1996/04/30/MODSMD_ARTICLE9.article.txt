Assault and battery reported
An assault and battery was reported immediately
following the Stanford men's baseball game at Sunken
Diamond Friday.
The 17-year-old victim was a resident of a youth
home in San Jose who came to see the game.
"He was severely, and I underline that, beaten by a
rather large, 6-foot-1,200-pound man between 18 and
20 years old with a muscular build. The man had a
shaved head and was wearing a T-shirt with Shaquille
O'Neal on it and a leather sun visor," said Stanford Po
lice Capt. Raoul Niemeyer. The assailant, who appar
ently had friends with him, fled the scene of the crime,
Niemeyer said.
The victim had his lips torn and his teeth loosened,
both eyes blackened and swollen shut, according to t he
police report. The victim was uncooperative in giving
details of the crime and was taken to the Medical Cen
ter and treated in the emergency room, Niemeyer said.
Fraternity member attacked
Three individuals, assumed by police to be members
of a rival Stanford fraternity, allegedly attacked a 19-
year-old member of Phi Delta Theta at approximately
12:30 a.m. Sunday.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer,
the incident occurred outside Marx House in Gover

nor's Corner. The victim, who was leaving a party, was
apparently heckled by the three suspects for wearing a
T-shirt that read on the front, "If your RA said it, it
must be true," and on the back, "Rush '95 Phi Delta
Theta."
The assailants then poured beer onto the victim
from an upper floor, Niemeyer said. The victim tossed
some beer over his shoulder in retaliation, but not onto
the hecklers, he said.
"They rushed down, and one of them hit him over
the head with his fist," Niemeyer said. The victim
threw some blows back, and "they rushed him and beat
him severely around the face and kicked him when he
was down on the ground," Niemeyer said. The victim
has since decided to press charges.
"We're in the process of getting more supplemental
information from witnesses and anticipate being able
to identify 1 the assailants] in the near future," Niemey
er said.
Alleged fight, vandalism reported
Two related incidents resulted in an assault and bat
tery and a vandalism in Ujamaa House April 20 at
about 1 p.m.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer,
two males allegedly entered a dormitory room in Uja
maa, and one of them assaulted the three individuals in
t he room — two males and one female. The alleged as

sailant was not a Stanford student, but is apparently the
brother of the other suspect, who is an Ujamaa resident.
After the fight ended, the two male victims of the as
sault "left to get another friend," Niemeyer said.
"After the alleged assault they go and try to locate
the guy that beat them up and were seen kicking his
door panel in," Niemeyer said. "At first, the people
kicking the door in denied it, but they were out of
breath and seen leaving the scene, and later on a wit
ness identified them."
Two victims of the alleged assault, students Shan
non Prograis and Diarra McKinney, were charged with
vandalism, and the third was released. Police are now
working to locate the original assailant.
Senator-elect cited
Stanford freshman Joseph Freund was cited and re
leased for being a minor in possession of alcohol April
19 at 2:15 a.m.
Freund was apparently celebrating his recent elec
tion to the ASSU Senate as the second-highest vote
getter. The results had been released earlier that
evening at Tresidder Union, where he was cited.
Hate mail incidents occur
A Hoover Institution fellow has been receiving race
related hate mail, according to Stanford Police Capt.
Rnnnl Niomovpr

One piece of hate mail was in response to an article
he wrote for a Los Angeles consortium about Presi
dent Clinton and Whitewater. Niemeyer refused to
disclose the name of the recipient of the hate mail,
saying only that the victim was a "person of color."
The hate mail contained obscenities referring to the
victim's race and quotes from the Bible, Niemeyer said.
One note had the words, "Fuck them — fuck you,"
scrawled over a copy of one of the articles. It is unclear
whether all the mail came from the same source.
Cushman vehicle stolen
A student broke into a shed by the Elliott Program
Center and stole a Cushman electric vehicle over the
weekend, according to Stanford Police. The 19-year
old student then picked up his girlfriend at her dormi
tory, police said.
"So he picked her up in style and took her to this
party and went back to his dormitory," Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said. A Stanford community
service officer discovered the vehicle parked outside
the dormitory.
Officers entered the building and located the perpe
trator, Niemeyer said. "He then was cooperative and
admitted to taking this vehicle," Niemeyer said.
"There have boon reports of significant damage to the
cart and door."
