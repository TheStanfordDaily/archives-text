Urban ministers will hold a remembrance service for people
who have died and are dying on the streets.
7:00 Teach-in
These are workshops on poverty and homelessness co
taught by homeless and poor people themselves. Balancing
the knowledge that these people are learning and creating
by being on the street with the knowledge that is created in
the university, we will examine how both sources of
knowledge are informing, complementing, and oftentimes
challenging each other. We will find the connections
between racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, etc. and
explore how those issues operate to put people on the
street and how they operate within the street community as
well.
&QQ Music/ Poetry Jam
We will integrate people on the street, campus groups and
individuals who utilize their music and poetry as agents of
expression, education, and change.

band-aid solutions.
We believe that
change proceeds
from the bottom up,
and that it is only
through the real
empowerment of
the oppressed that
we can ever
achieve justice,
liberty, and equality
for all.
