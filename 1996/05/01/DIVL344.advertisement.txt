BACK PAIN
RESEARCH STUDY: EARN $25.
Volunteers with low back pain severe enough to make normal activities
more difficult, but otherwise in generally good health, are sought for a
study of a holistic treatment using the human biofield, at the Institute of
Transpersonal Psychology in Palo Alto. Prior research with this technique
has shown highly consistent improvements in back pain, with no negative
effects. For info, call 415-938-3619.
