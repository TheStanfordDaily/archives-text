Tattooing
&
Piercing
You're doing what
to where?
So you've decided you're
going to do it. You're going to
take the plunge and get your
belly-button pierced. It's
spring, your stomach is tan
from Mexico, your R.A. has hers
pierced, and your nipple pierc
ings are getting lonely....what
more reason do you need?
Before you drive off to Haight
and give up your navel to some
lattooed, "I have 59 unnatural
holes in my body," piercing
consultant, here are a few tips
to keep in mind.
When choosing a tattooist
or piercer, he/she should...
• have taken the Alliance of
Professional Tattooist (APT)
course and have the certificate
to prove it.
• be comfortable talking about
their safety procedures.
• Use an autoclave (heat sterili
zation) to sterilize equipment
and use a disinfectant solution
on all external surfaces (tables,
countertops). He/she should
also be wearing latex gloves.
Hepatitis B, C and HIV can all
be contracted through piercing
and tattooing.
• Throw all used needles in a
container labelled "Sharps."
• Use a new needle for every
piercing. Also, avoid any pierc
er who uses ear piercing guns.
The guns can not be sterilized
adequately and may cause per
manent damage if used any
where other than your earlobe.
• Give you a thorough instruc
tion sheet of how to care and
clean your tattoo/piercing. It's
tough to show off a grossly
infected piercing, and chances
are high that it will get infected
at least once.
• Use high quality stainless
steel, solid gold (14k or 18k),
niobium, titanium, or platinum
jewelery of the proper size (too
thin can lead to tearing, too
thick may cause keloid; keloid
is an enlarged scar, more fre
quent in African-Americans).
Ask your friends for recom
mendations and visit the tat
too/piercing "parlor" before
you decide where to get your
tattoo / piercing. The parlor
should be able to show you pic
tures of their work.
Of course, keep in mind that
tattoos and piercings are not
short-term changes. Picture
yourself in 20 years with a
Snoopy tattoo on your hip at the
company beach party.
According to Newsweek, half of
the people who currently have
tattoos want them removed. If
you decide to get a tattoo, doc
tors suggest recording the type
of dye and lot number of each
pigment used in each tattoo.
That information is important if
you ever decide to have the tat
too removed. "Re-stitching" is
available for pierced body parts,
but it's not a fun procedure.
So when your parents ask
you "You're doing What to
Where?" you can tell them
you're at least being safe
about it. They still may not
speak to you, but your R.A.
will think it's cool.
