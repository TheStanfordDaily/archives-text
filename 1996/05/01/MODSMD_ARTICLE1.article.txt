In an attempt to draw attention to the
plight of janitors, almost 400 janitors and
church, community and labor leaders
participated yesterday afternoon in a sit
in at Stanford's Embarcadero Road en
trance, ending in the arrest of 12 partici

Local 1877 of the Service Employees
International Union, a bargaining unit
for Bay Area janitors, is currently negoti
ating with janitorial contractors for high
er wages, health insurance and more ben
efits. These companies currently hold
contracts with many Bay Area corpora
tions and buildings, including Stanford.
Negotiations began April 3 and are
scheduled to end by May 31.

During the busy lunchtime hour, the
protesters marched from the Palo Alto
City Hall down University Avenue to El
Camino Real, blocking rush-hour traf
fic. Twelve marchers — including Stan
ford senior Vanessa Alvarado — re
mained after police ordered all protest
ers out of the Embarcadero / El Camino
