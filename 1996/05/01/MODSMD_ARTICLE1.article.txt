## 12 participants arrested during sit-in, including one Stanford student 
### Dana Hangai Contributing writer 
In an attempt to draw attention to the
plight of janitors, almost 400 janitors and
church, community and labor leaders
participated yesterday afternoon in a sit
in at Stanford's Embarcadero Road en
trance, ending in the arrest of 12 partici
pants, including one Stanford student.

Local 1877 of the Service Employees
International Union, a bargaining unit
for Bay Area janitors, is currently negoti
ating with janitorial contractors for high
er wages, health insurance and more ben
efits. These companies currently hold
contracts with many Bay Area corpora
tions and buildings, including Stanford.
Negotiations began April 3 and are
scheduled to end by May 31.

During the busy lunchtime hour, the
protesters marched from the Palo Alto
City Hall down University Avenue to El
Camino Real, blocking rush-hour traf
fic. Twelve marchers — including Stan
ford senior Vanessa Alvarado — re
mained after police ordered all protest
ers out of the Embarcadero / El Camino

Real intersection.
The protesters were arrested by
Palo Alto Police and issued a cita
tion for blocking the roadway, ac
cording to Palo Alto Police Officer
Jason Bos worth. They were later
released.
"I'm here because these are the
people who make things easier for
us so that we don't have to think
about it," Alvarado said. "Why are
they being paid below the poverty
level?"
A key complaint of the union is
the disparity between janitors' in
come and that of the CEOs of many
of the companies that hire contrac
tors. While most companies do not
personally hire janitors, the clients
are even more responsible than the
contractors, Local 1877 research
analyst Mark Gomez said.
"Stanford hires contractors to
clean the buildings," union orga
nizer Antonio Abarca said. "Stan
ford is just as guilty as the contrac
tor it hires."
Stanford officials have previous
ly said they are not responsible for
the actions of the contractors.
According to Gomez, 95 percent
of the union's membership are mi
norities, with a substantia popula
tion of Latino immigrants. Many of
these janitors are currently living
below the poverty level, based on
Local 1877 data.
"The contractors, along with the
clients, feel the janitors should be
happy with what they have," Abar
ca said. "But how can you compare
a CEO's salaiy of, say, $12,000 a
day to a janitor's of $52.35 a day?"
Union members are concerned
about heavy workloads. Many
workers are given more tasks
than is possible to complete in an
eight-hour workday, Abarca said.
Some janitors clean the equiva
lent of 24 to 35 one-family homes
per night.
Both police officials and union
organizers felt the march went
smoothly and achieved its purpose.
Police were previously informed of
both the march and the sit-in.
"I think it went smoothly, and I
think it was a fine job done by the
police department," Bosworth said.
"The marchers and demonstrators
did a good job. We had an open dia
logue concerning what we would
like to give up and they were very
helpful in listening to us."
