Marines shoot, kill three Liberians
MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) — American
Marines shot and killed three Liberians firing
toward the U.S. Embassy yesterday as fierce bat
tles engulfed the capital, littering its streets with
bodies a day after a cease-fire collapsed.
The shootings, the first exchange of gunfire
involving U.S. troops since Liberia's civil war reignit
ed in early April, came as new factional fighting left
the 10-day-old, U.S.-brokered truce in tatters.
One U.S. Marine was grazed — possibly by a car
tridge from his own weapon — but required no med
ical attention, said two senior defense officials in
Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity.
At an army barracks a few blocks from the
embassy, the floor of a clinic was awash in blood
as scores of victims were carried in or dragged
themselves through the door. Doctors said at least
three people had died and 60 were wounded, many
civilians.
Fire from mortars, machine guns and rocket
propelled grenades echoed through the city, forc
ing George Moose, the U.S. assistant secretary of
state for African affairs, to cancel talks at the
embassy with government, peacekeepers and fac
tional leaders.
Moose, in a telephone interview from the
embassy, warned of a "major catastrophe" if the
fighting continued. He blamed warlord-turned
politician Charles Taylor, whose standoff with a
rival April 6 provoked two weeks of warfare cul
minating in the cease-fire.
"Taylor will be held responsible," Moose said.

"If he persists in taking power, he should expect a
strong international reaction."
In Monrovia's Mamba Point diplomatic sec
tion, where the embassy is located, rival factions
battled for control through the afternoon. At least
nine bodies were scattered on the streets of the
beachfront neighborhood. It was unclear whether
those killed died while fighting or were caught in
crossfire.
GOP congressman accused of lying
PRINEVILLE, Ore. (AP) - Rep. Wes Cooley
had a habit of stretching the truth even before he
was elected to Congress, falsely claiming to be a
Phi Beta Kappa and moving his trailer less than a
mile inside his district just long enough to estab
lish residency.
Now the freshman Republican is accused of
falsely claiming to have fought in Korea and lying
about when he got married so his wife could
fraudulently continue to collect benefits as the
widow of a Marine.
The latest allegations are raising doubts about
Cooley's political future in this conservative, rural
district that encompasses all of Oregon east of the
Cascade Range and part of the southwestern cor
ner of the state. The congressman is up for re
election in November.
"In our office, we used to do a lot of Wes Cooley
jokes. But now I think he's a dishonest person. He
shouldn't be a congressman anymore," says Bren
da Daly, 31, whose family runs an excursion train
in this hierh desert town.
