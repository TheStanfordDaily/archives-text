# Congress to vote on gas taxes
## Justice Department opens investigation into rising prices 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Con
gressional leaders promised a vote
by Memorial Day to roll back gaso
line taxes as the Justice Department
opened an investigation yesterday
into the causes of the recent surge
in prices at the pump.
"We believe with the skyrocket
ing prices of gasoline, jet fuel and
other fuels that the most certain
way to give consumers relief is to
repeal the gas tax ... and do it as
quickly as we can before the sum
mer driving season starts in
earnest," said Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole, President Clin
ton's GOP challenger in the fall
election.
In a contest to win votes by low
ering prices, Republicans have
called for a repeal of the 4.3-cent-a
-gallon gasoline tax increase that
Clinton won in 1993 as part of a
deficit-reduction package. Dole and
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said
Congress would vote quickly for a
repeal through the end of this year.
And (hey said a permanent repeal
would be included in their fiscal
1997 budget package.
The Clinton administration has
said it is willing to discuss repeal. At
the same time, it has moved to drive
prices down by increasing supplies.
And ve.sterdav. Assistant Attor

ney General Anne Bin gam an, head
of the Justice Department's
antitrust division, named a five-per
son task force of lawyers and
economists to conduct the investiga
tion of price increases.
She acted at the request of Asso
ciate Attorney General John
Schmidt and in response to
inquiries by three members of
Congress, department spokesman
Carl Stern said.
Two Senate Democrats from
Connecticut, Christopher Dodd and
Joseph Lieberman, and Ilep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote
Attorney General Janet Reno
requesting an investigation.
The task force, whose members
were not identified, "will first study
whether market forces account for
the increase in prices," Stern said.
"If not, then they will determine
whether there is evidence of collu
sion, which Ls illegal under antitrust
laws."
Reno told reporters yesterday
afternoon that she was not aware of
anyone in the Justice Department
discussing the probe with the White
House before the decision yesterday
morning to open the investigation.
As inquiries from Capitol Hill
mounted, Reno said, "We asked
Anne (Bingaman) to look into it to

see if there's any new information."
Schmidt said, "There was
enough unusual activity that Anne
thought, and I agreed, this was
something the antitrust division
should look into, to see if there was
evidence of collusion as opposed to
market forces at work."
During gasoline shortages in
past years, the antitrust division
has found no basis for taking action
against oil companies. In those
instances, either market forces were
responsible for price increases or
the companies raised prices inde
pendently of each other, thereby
avoiding violations of antitrust laws
that prohibit competing businesses
from agreeing on price actions and
strategies.
The Justice investigation is the
third move by the Clinton adminis
tration in two days to respond to the
price surge, which has become an
election-year issue.
On Monday, Clinton authorized
the orderly sales of about 12 million
barrels of oil from the nation's
strategic petroleum reserves, a
move that, by increasing supplies,
might drive down prices. He also
asked Energy Secretary Hazel
O'Leary to report within 45 days
"about the factors that led to the
run-up in prices."
