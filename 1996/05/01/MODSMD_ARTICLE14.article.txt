## Editorial Maintaining a major 
### 
The University must take
steps to secure necessary
resources for STS major

STANFORD IS a popular
place. The Office of Under
graduate Admissions
received more than 16,000 applica
tions this year alone. Unfortunate
ly, because of limited funding and
faculty, the University turned
away more than 80 percent of
those seeking a spot at the Farm.
If Stanford can't meet every
one's desires, why should it bother
to meet anyone's? Maybe the
Board of Trustees should just shut
the whole place down.
Unfortunately, this type of
warped logic permeates the recent
decision to eliminate the Science,
Technology and Society major, a
decision "based on the fact that
there are too few senior faculty suf
ficiently engaged in the undergrad
uate program on a day-to-day basis
to make support of the increasing
number of STS majors and honors
students sustainable at an accept
able level." In other words, the pro
gram's popularity caused its doom.
No one claims STS is a low-cal
iber program deserving its fate.
This would be a valid, if disputed,
reason to end the major. However,
it has received nothing but rave
reviews from students, alumni,
faculty and administrators.
Something must be done to save
this valuable program. If the prob
lem truly is a lack of resources, the
University should examine ways to
increase these resources or ways to
alleviate the current strain upon
them.
The STS program could develop
a procedure much like the one used
by the Admissions Office. An appli
cation process would allow STS to
accept those most interested and
best suited to the program, keeping
the total number of students down
to a more easily managed level.

However, such a solution is only
short-term. STS's long-term prob
lem is its organizational niche —
the program stretches across the
School of Engineering and the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences. Although each school has
touted the major's value, neither
side has devoted the time, money
or energy necessary to keep it alive.
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences significantly reduced its com
mitment a few years ago, leaving
the entire burden squarely on the
shoulders of the School of Engi
neering — a burden the school is
apparently no longer willing to
bear alone.
The program's interdisciplinary
nature prevents it from hiring
tenure-line professors. Instead,
faculty work through other depart
ments. However, because there is
so much pressure on professors to
win tenure and research money —
which STS can't offer — they
understandably prefer to devote
their time to other departments
and more tangible pursuits.
Any solution must give profes
sors incentives to expend the nec
essary energy. The most obvious
ways to do so — expanding STS to
include graduate education and
faculty research and granting the
program the authority to hire
tenure-line professors — are also
the most expensive. However,
unless either the School of Engi
neering or the School of Humani
ties and Sciences has a change of
heart concerning the program's
management, these drastic struc
tural changes may be the only way
to ensure the major's existence."
It is disturbing that such a pop
ular and acclaimed major was elim
inated with so little warning and so
little student input. The Universi
ty is supposedly committed to
teaching and undergraduate edu
cation. This is the perfect opportu
nity for it to show how much. The
School of Engineering and the
School of Humanities and Sciences
should continue funding STS while
the University searches for a way
to keep STS alive.
