## Stanford-in-Rangoon 
### 
OUR POOR UNIVERSITY has
been having some trouble lately.
Student discontent with the
administration is up, alumni donations
are down and Dean John "academic mar
ket" Shoven has decided we need to suck
down a hearty antidote of downsizing.
I suggest that instead of trying to
improve our current mousetrap, we should
build a better one. We shouldn't make
small cosmetic changes — such as by elimi
nating departments that try to educate stu
dents and help society but aren't funded by
large corporations. We need revolution.
Let's move the campus to Rangoon,
Burma. All our problems would be solved
if we got in good with the state. Labor
would be cheap (often free), regulations
would be negotiable and the weather
(which, according to a recent Daily edito
rial, is the number one reason to go to
Stanford) is great. Plus, with monsoon
season, Lake Lag would fill every year.
Instead of frantically eliminating
departments to save a buck on our $4 bil
lion endowment, we could save millions
instantly just by conscripting a few hun
dred peasants to reconstruct our embit
tered Quad. As I've learned while earning
an econ degree, people, like cinder blocks
and rain forests, are resources. And in
Rangoon, resources are cheap.
Moreover, we wouldn't have to keep a
few artsy creative departments — like
Art and English — or thoughtful, cre
ative and critically original departments

— like STS. Those departments only
exist so prospective freshman aren't
scared by a school that appears to be try
ing to become a hamburger factory spit
ting out econ and computer science
majors and a few catatonic pre-meds. In
Rangoon, we could simply eliminate all
the majors we don't like and not tell any
one. No one would know because the
state controls the press, the press con
trols knowledge and Stanford could be
the state. The Daily would print whatev
er we wanted the freshmen to re?d. We
could even print our own version of U.S.
News and World Report and change the
percentage of living alumni who give
money to 100 percent. Of course, with a
carefully groomed militia, we could do
that other ways, too.
While concerned that we might lose
some faculty, I'm confident we could keep
the Hoover Institution happy by simply
letting them print endless pamphlets
about how socialism failed the local econ
omy. The Stanford Review would be like
a fly in feces — frolicking in Burma's eco
nomic failure (it's because they were
socialist, you know. Just like Stanford
and its Marxist-based multiculturalism!
Kill those ethnic centers or we'll end up
with insufficient rice rations, too!). Per
haps we could even coax another article
espousing the importance of "The Diver
sity Myth" from the staff.
The ASSU could be more efficient
because we could simply shoot people

who try to turn meetings into bureau
cratic rounds of never-ending pin-the
tail-on-the-donkey. Anyone for Steve
Russell?
Housing would be the same — if peo
ple can live in Stern, they'd be able to
cope with a bomb shelter. Food service
would be at home with a monopolistic
dictatorship.
We'd keep the co-op and fraternity
scenes alive because there are a lot of
poppies near Rangoon.
Diversions, The Review, Gerhard
Casper and everyone else who prefers
campus activism to be merely a few hedo
nists rallying around the Sixth Man Club
would be happy because in Rangoon dis
senters are treated worse than harmony
in a Stanford Band solo.
Sadly, in the end, my plan will never
become a reality. No matter how much
our deans are excited about this, the
Department of Athletics would exercise
its veto power and castrate my creative
solution. No other Pac-10 schools would
want to fly to play us and the University
of Mandalay has too much barbed wire in
it to provide space to nourish a competi
tive basketball team.
Too bad. SLORC could really help us
out.
