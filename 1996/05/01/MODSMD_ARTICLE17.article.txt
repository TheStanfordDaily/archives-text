Pro-life insert contained errors and propagandist methods

Last Wednesday, The Daily
included a 12-page compilation of
distortion and propaganda that was
entitled, "She's a Child, not a Choice,"
hereafter called "Child-Choice."
Surely the editor should have made
certain the reader was presented with
some balance, a reasonable analysis of the
claims and the rhetoric of the inclusion.
Sooner or later, when someone makes the
difficult decision to terminate pregnancy,
her fears and anxieties will be far greater
for the echoes of "nightmares," "crazi
ness" and lies about a "four times higher
risk of developing breast cancer."
The remarkable aspect of "Child-
Choice" is that it is permeated through
out by the issue of unplanned pregnancy,
without a single statement as to how the
sexually active reader can prevent it.
Birth control is not totally ignored; the
Pill and lUD are described as "abortifa
cients," and two items on a densely
packed page of resources allude to the
rhythm method.
If Right-to-Lifers really want to cut
down the number of abortions, the best
way is to prevent unplanned pregnancy. If
we agree that sexual activity will continue
to occur in the young and the vulnerable
regardless of exhortations to delay, their
chances of impregnation (and hence of
abortion) are sharply diminished by care
ful use of birth control. When I called a
number of the listed resources and asked
them for birth control information, I was
informed that they opposed all forms of
birth control except for "natural family

planning," the rhythm method. Let me
deal with a number of issues that the pub
lication raises.
Protected human life — the "baby" —
begins at conception, it claims. Abortion
is said to be "killing babies." The concept
of a fertilized egg as a human being is a
belief sharply at variance with mine and
that of many Americans. It echoes a sin
gle strain of religious doctrine in this
country, engaged in an effort to impose
its belief on the nation through a consti
tutional amendment redefining intrauter
ine "life." An egg is not a chicken; a seed
is not an apple; a fertilized egg is not a
baby; a sperm or an ovum is not half a
baby.
The banning of legal abortion, accord
ing to "Child-Choice," must be supported
because there is no Constitutional "right"
for women to request that medical proce
dure. In fact, what "Child-Choice" asks
for is a "Federal Compulsory Gestation
Law," whereby the coercive nation-state
insists that the woman's uterus be occu
pied for nine months against her will.
They would like a constitutional amend
ment to that effect. In their view, the vic
tim of rape must confront the product of
rape for her lifetime, lest she "murder"
the fertilized egg.
They list the dangers of abortion with
out any documentation. The fact is that
the mortality rate with pregnancy and
childbirth is five times as great as that of
legal abortions at all ages (New England
Journal of Medicine, June 29,1978:
1474-1477). There is a high incidence of

toxemia, prolonged and precipitate to
labor, postpartum infection and hemor
rhage among teenagers who carry to
term. There is an excess of prenatal
deaths and of developmentally impaired
children. As compared to legal abortion,
those who carry to term have a higher
incidence of pulmonary embolism in the
last trimester and in the postpartum peri
od.
The article quotes the "post-abortion
syndrome" with a host of behavioral prob
lems, inability to become pregnant again,
miscarriage and stillbirths, and excess
pelvic inflammatory disease. But a careful
study published in the New England
Journal of Medicine (December 1977:
1241-1245) found that a history of prior
induced abortion was not related to low
birth weight, premature delivery, still
birth, neonatal death, miscarriage or con
genital malformations in subsequent
pregnancies. The Institute of Medicine of
the National Academy of Sciences, in a
review of the subject, concluded that "the
feelings of guilt, regret or loss elicited by
illegal abortion in some women are gener
ally temporary and appeared to be out
weighed by positive life changes and feel
ings of relief." Post-abortion psychosis has
been found to occur six times more com
monly after term delivery than after legal
abortion.
Nowhere in "Child-Choice" was it
pointed out that young women who
become pregnant and who desire an abor
tion will surely obtain one regardless of
the obstacles. If abortion is made illegal,

or if individuals denied funds for legal
abortion choose a back-alley abortion, the
risk is a 100 times greater than with legal
abortion. Yet the authors of "Child-
Choice" demand that the impoverished
pregnant 13-year-old be forced into moth
erhood when adolescence has barely
begun.
When legal abortion became available,
the mortality dropped nearly fivefold
between 1972, the year before abortion
rights became constitutionally guaran
teed, and 1982. In 1987, there were 1.3
million legal abortions, with six deaths, as
compared to 1,000 women per year dying
from abortion in the 19405. Since then
the mortality rate has decreased even
more sharply.
"Morbidity and mortality from septic
abortion are infrequent in countries
where induced abortion is legal but are
widespread in the many developing coun
tries where it is either illegal or inaccessi
ble" (New England Journal of Medicine,
Aug. 4, 1994, p. 310). In Romania, when
abortion was outlawed in the 19605, the
rate of abortion-related mortality rose
tenfold (American Journal of Public
Health, 1992,1328-31).
The decision for abortion is a difficult
one and never lightly made, but its use
when necessary has cut down the number
of abused children, battered babies and
desolate, poverty-stricken mothers in our
society.
