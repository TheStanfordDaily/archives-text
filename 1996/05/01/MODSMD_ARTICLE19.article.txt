# Colleen Krueger: Left of center
## Passive activism: feminism from the inside out 
### 
I DON'T KNOW about you, but when I
picked up the paper and realized that
the Stanford Women's Collective lost
its special fee, it seemed pretty clear to
me who was responsible: men.
Although the collective's fee was
approved by a majority — about 65 percent
of the more than 3,500 students who voted
— that number constituted less than 15
percent of the total student body. And 35
percent voted against the Women's Center.
If you figure that most women voted for
the collective, then a ridiculously high
number of men must have consciously
voted against it, I reasoned aloud. How
could that possibly happen?
"Backlash, the undeclared war against
American women?" offered my male
friend.
"Men," I sneered, disgusted.
The same men who shared a lunch
table in my freshman dorm, making
snide comments about lesbians being too
ugly to get a man. The men who — the
morning after a party — laugh over the
ugly, drunk girls their fraternity broth
ers bagged and will never, ever call. The
men who would never dream of asking a

girl out because she talks a lot in section,
or who treat girls badly because their
friends think it's cool. The guys who sit
at Lake Lag on their fat, white asses and
critique every girl who walks by, search
ing for that unattainable physical blend
of a 13-year-old's figure with Victoria's
Secret breasts.
Okay, maybe it's not just men who
masterminded this, I conceded. The Uni
versity is also responsible! The Universi
ty, which has sent such a clear message
— with its sluggish, grudging financial
support of efforts against sexual assault
on campus — that women's safety is low
on its agenda. The University, which con
tributes only a part-time coordinator and
the use of a campus building to the
Women's Collective. Men and the Uni
versity — two classic oppressors teaming
up to strike a fatal blow to the Women's
Center . . it was too good.
Or too easy, as the case may be. As
easy as it would be to blame what I see as
a real crisis of conscience on my equiva
lent of a band of roving athlete-vandals,
the truth is much harder to face. The
sobering truth is that, ultimately, I am

responsible for letting this happen.
I've never been an active member of
the Women's Collective. I've never con
tributed to Womanspeak. I've never vol
unteered to help out with Herstory or
Take Back the Night. I didn't even
remind my friends to vote for the special
fee. I've been a free-rider, a silent mem
ber of the Stanford women's community,
reaping the benefits of a few devoted
women's efforts without doing my share.
And I suspect I'm not alone.
I remember being horrified at our
freshman "Crossing the Line" identity
discussion, when only a handful of
women stepped across the duct-tape line
at a question something like "Do you
work to advance the rights of women?"
Had the question been, "Do you work to
advance the rights of African Ameri
cans?" or "Latinos?" or "Native Ameri
cans?" or "Asian Americans?" something
tells me that the only faces behind the
line would be those of my white brothers
and sisters. Why are we women so loath
to complete the work that has brought us
here and enables us to be doctors and
engineers and writers and artists?

Many of us arc concerned about the
negative connotations associated with
feminism. Granted, feminists have made
mistakes over the years, alienating our
sisters with strict, bra-burning ortho
doxy. But feminism now, on its best day,
is truly the Big Tent that even the
Republican Party of Christie Todd Whit
man will never be. Nothing is more sub
versive to the feminist agenda of 1996
than Rush Limbaugh's "feminazi." Fem
inism is about savoring, cherishing, hon
oring the authentic experiences of
women — our distinctive gifts and our
struggles. Yes, it's about fighting, too.
Fighting the obstacles women face to fol
lowing their dreams and to being who
they are, whether that woman is a parent
or a truck driver or a politician or all
three. It's not about being pro-choice or
anti-male; it's about being pro-women.
It's appropriate, therefore, that the
Women's Center be just that. Not a cen
ter for radical feminists or for sorority
women, but for all women here at Stan
ford. The collective is entirely member
driven. If you don't think there's a group
there that fits your needs, start one up.

Unless your particular niche is promot
ing damaging female stereotypes or
domestic violence, it will fly. But com
plaining that the collective doesn't repre
sent you when you're not there is putting
the cart before the horse.
Today has been designated as a day for
all of us — women and men — to voice
our support for the Women's Center in
the hopes of securing University funding
to ensure its survival. I encourage anyone
who feels like I do to make it a sort of per
sonal Million Man March, if you will. A
day of atonement, of regret for the times
when we have tacitly let women's issues
fall by the wayside. But also a day of hope
for the future. Stop by the Women's Cen
ter anytime after noon to get involved in
the day's events. Pick up a pin to show
your support. Give the folks there input
on their proposal to seek funding from
the University. Sign a petition or take
one home. Talk to other pro-women stu
dents, male and female. Maybe I'll see
you there.
