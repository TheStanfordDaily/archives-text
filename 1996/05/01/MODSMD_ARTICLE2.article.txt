# Study rates accuracy of AIDS tests

A new study by two Stanford re
searchers suggests that the most com
monly used AIDS test is in fact more ac
curate than a newer, more expensive test
now used chiefly to diagnose infants born
to HIV-positive mothers.
The study, headed by Asst. Medicine
Prof. Douglas Owens and published in
today's Annals of Internal Medicine, de
termined that although Polymerase

antibodies, it often gives false results.
Owens and his partner Mark Holod
niy, director of the AIDS Research Cen
ter at Stanford Hospital, analyzed 96
studies on PGR testing in adults and 32
studies on PCR diagnosis of infants for
the study.
The problem with antibody testing is
that tests will not come back positive
until about six months after infection,
because it takes the body six months to
produce enough antibodies for a test to
detect anything. PCR can be done imme

diately after infection since it looks for
the virus itself. However, it is not always
accurate.
PCR is a technique developed about
10 years ago which looks directly for the
presence of the HIV virus in the blood
stream. It amplifies a segment of viral
DNA, if any is found in the individual,
which indicates infection. In contrast,
antibody tests look for antibodies which
the body develops in an effort to fight off
the virus as it infects more and more
cells.
