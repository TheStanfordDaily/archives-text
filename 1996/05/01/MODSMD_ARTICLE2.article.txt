# Study rates accuracy of AIDS tests

A new study by two Stanford re
searchers suggests that the most com
monly used AIDS test is in fact more ac
curate than a newer, more expensive test
now used chiefly to diagnose infants born
to HIV-positive mothers.
The study, headed by Asst. Medicine
Prof. Douglas Owens and published in
today's Annals of Internal Medicine, de

antibodies, it often gives false results.
Owens and his partner Mark Holod
niy, director of the AIDS Research Cen
ter at Stanford Hospital, analyzed 96
studies on PGR testing in adults and 32
studies on PCR diagnosis of infants for
the study.
The problem with antibody testing is
that tests will not come back positive
until about six months after infection,
because it takes the body six months to
produce enough antibodies for a test to
detect anything. PCR can be done imme

diately after infection since it looks for
the virus itself. However, it is not always
accurate.
PCR is a technique developed about
10 years ago which looks directly for the
presence of the HIV virus in the blood
stream. It amplifies a segment of viral
DNA, if any is found in the individual,
which indicates infection. In contrast,
antibody tests look for antibodies which
the body develops in an effort to fight off
the virus as it infects more and more
cells.
"The main problem with PCR
is false positives," Owens said.
"PCR is a complicated procedure
with many parts to it. You use
such tiny little pieces of DNA that
it's easy for the test to be contam
inated. To prevent that, now each
step is done in a different room."
However, Owens said even
with precautions, PCR results
typically return more than five
times as many false results as an
tibody tests. PCR is also a more

expensive technique, costing any
where from $150 to $200 per test,
compared to antibody testing,
which costs from $5 to $50.
While the test is valuable for
testing infants who are born to
HIV-infected mothers, Owens
pointed out that the test does not
work any better for infants. The
test is simply an early way to find
out if the child is infected.
Even infants who are not HlV
positive have antibodies to HIV in
their bloodstream for up to 18
months after birth because of the
antibodies which their mothers
passed to them in the womb. For
this reason, PCR is often used to

determine if the child is infected.
Owens said there is a debate
over when children should be test
ed. "Some think it should wait,
others say do it right away when
the mother is there because some
times people won't come back for
testing."
Owens suggested that testing
should either wait because anti
body testing is more accurate, or if
the child is PCR tested early, he or
she should be tested again later.
"You have to follow these kids,"
Owens said. "With PCR, we are
concerned that people will think
the test is so good you can do it
once and then forget about it."
