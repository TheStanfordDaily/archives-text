## Cardinal puts hurt on USF in 10-1 victory 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Last night, the No. 12-ranked Stanford baseball
team won its ninth straight game and avenged one of
its early-season losses by thumping the University of
San Francisco, 10-1.
The Dons defeated head coach Mark Marquess'
squad by a 6-3 score Feb. 13. The loss dropped Stan
ford to 7-4, while USF improved to 7-0 on the year.
With the win last night, the Cardinal upped its
record to 32-17, while the Dons fell to 24-23.
As it did Saturday and Sunday in victories over
UCLA, Stanford scored early, posting three runs in
the opening frame. The Cardinal plated three more
in the second inning and tacked on four runs in the
third for a 10-0 lead.
USF starter Trevor Schaffer (1-7) was roughed up
by Stanford, allowing nine runs, including seven
earned, in just two innings of work. Schaffer did not
help his own cause; his wildness led to five walks to
go along with seven hits.
Ail-American catcher A.J. Hinch led the Cardinal
attack, going 2-for-2 with four runs batted in and
two runs scored. First baseman Luke Quaccia and
second baseman Brian Dallimore also chipped in two
hits and two RBIs apiece.
Marquess, who picked up career win No. 799 as
the Cardinal skipper, was pleased with his team's
overall performance.
"They gave us a lot by walking a lot of batters
early and then we got a couple of hits," Marquess
said. "We were fortunate they gave us a lot of walks
and we took advantage of it. We pitched well, so it
was good, we got a lot of guys some work."
Cardinal starter Mario Iglesias picked up his
team-leading eighth win. Iglesias threw three in
nings of scoreless baseball, giving up four hits. In the
first inning, he kept the Dons off the board after giv-
ing up a leadoff double to second
baseman Jermaine Clark.
"Tonight, I mainly just bat
tled," Iglesias said. "Its tough
when the leadoff hitter in the
game gets on second base. I was
pitching defensively, thinking 'I
can't give up that first run
early.' They were swinging real
ly early in the count, so I bene
fited from them hitting it to peo
ple."
Iglesias pitches in a starting
role — mainly on Tuesday
nights — and is also a valuable
reliever on the weekends in con
ference play. The senior said he

has become accustomed to the
dual role and said he does not
have a preference for one over
the other.
"Being a senior now, the
transition is a little easier," Igle
sias said. "Almost everybody [on
the team was] a starter in high
school, so you come in wonder
ing what your role is. Now I ac
cept both roles and I'm comfort
able with both roles."
Iglesias and his Cardinal
teammates will look to continue
rolling as they hook up with
rival California this weekend in
the final Pacific 10 Southern Di
vision series of the season. Stan
ford enters the weekend tied
with UCLA (which plays Six-Pac
champion USC) for second place
in the league. Cal stands in fifth

place in the Six-Pac.
"We knew what we had to do
after we got swept by USC,"
Iglesias said. "We knew that to
get a good seeding in the region
als, we'd have to run off a big
number of wins in a row and
we've really played well. We're
feeling confident heading into
the series with Berkeley."
