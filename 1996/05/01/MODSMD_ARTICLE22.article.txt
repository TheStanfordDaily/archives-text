### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
After two days and three rounds of play at the
1996 Pacific 10 Conference Championships, the
Stanford men's golf team finds itself in fourth
place, 31 strokes behind leader Arizona State.
The men shot a disappointing 380 today at Big
Canyon Country Club in Newport Beach, Calif.,
dropping them from second to fourth place in team
play. With a score of 1,112, the Cardinal is now five
strokes behind USC and California (1,107). ASU is
the leader at 1,081.
Tiger Woods followed up Monday's record-set
ting rounds of 61 and 65 by shooting a 1-over-par
73, as the sophomore phenom saw his 14-stroke
lead reduced to 12. Chris Hannell of Arizona State
remained in second place.
Barring injury, natural catastrophe or the sud
den onset of blindness, Woods should today become
Stanford's first Pac-10 golf champion since Christ
ian Cevaer in 1992.
Unfortunately, Tiger's teammates have not
fared quite so well. Freshman Joel Kribel is tied for
20th with a score of 224, senior David Garcia is tied
for 38th, sophomore Eri Crum is tied for 44th, se
nior Jerry Chang is 54th and junior Conrad Ray is
58th.
