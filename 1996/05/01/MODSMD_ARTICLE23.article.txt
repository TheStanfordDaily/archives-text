# Tim Dalrymple: A lesson in determination
## Gymnast learns to deal with adversity after season-ending back injury 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
Tim Dalrymple will strike you as a very de
termined man. After all, anyone that has won a
state championship and a national champi

onship by the age of 10, and has succeeded at
every level of his sport except one — the
Olympics — has got to be determined.
However, the true test of character is not
how well one responds to triumphs, but how
well one deals with adversity.

Earlier this year Dalrymple suffered a sea
son-ending and possibly career-ending injury
when he fell off the high bar in warm-ups before
a meet at San Jose State. Dalrymple fractured
two vertebrae at the base of his neck, shattered
a disc and tore connective tissue and ligaments.
An unknowing Dalrymple went ahead and
competed in the pommel horse that night and
then drove himself to his home in Tracy, Calif.,
to spend time with his family. The doctors told
him it was a miracle that he was not paralyzed.
"I went home for the weekend, and over the
weekend the pain level jumped from very
painful to excruciating," he said. "The first
thing the doctor said to me was that you are a
very lucky man."
Dalrymple's longjourney began over 10 years
ago. After the 1984 Olympics, thousands of
young kids suddenly became budding gymnasts.
That was the year that the United States gym
nastics team took home the gold and Mary Lou
Retton became a star.
Dalrymple was one of those budding gym
nasts. He decided gymnastics was his calling
after watching the Los Angeles games on TV
(and after missing soccer sign-ups for that
year).
Just watching the games on TV, he had no
idea about the sacrifices he would have to make
— school, family, friends and church. He had no
idea about the physical obstacles he would face
— two torn pectorals, three cracked sternums,
fractured vertebrae, torn cartilage, tendonitis,
bursitis, sprained ankles, shin splints and a bro
ken neck.
But he would soon learn.
"Honestly, I don't know whether it's worth
it, but it's addictive," he said. "I keep doing it
because I love the competition and the way it
challenges me. Gymnastics pushes you to be
more than you thought you could be."
Dalrymple's determination is evident in the
manner in which he dealt with his most recent
injury.
"Tim is definitely one of the most headstrong
people I've ever known," said teammate, room
mate and good friend, sophomore Jeremy Her
man. "I was very impressed by how quickly he
bounced back [from the injury]. He was riding
his bike and driving his car within two weeks."
At the age of 10, Dalrymple won the state and
national championships. When he was 15 he
won the national Class II competition and fin
ished sixth at the Pan Am Games. At 16 he was
competing against 18-year-olds, and he won the
