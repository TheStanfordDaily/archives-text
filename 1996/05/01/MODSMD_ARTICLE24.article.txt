# Women's crew breezes through Miller Cup
## 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The Stanford women's crew team
didn't beat around the bush last week
end, routing the opposition and finish
ing first in the 18th annual Miller Cup
last Saturday in Bollana Creek, Calif.
The Cardinal traveled to UCLA for the
day's races and performed magnifi
cently, winning the final by almost 30
seconds over UC-Davis.
Stanford qualified for the final
after winning its first heat over Or
ange Coast College, San Diego State
and UC-San Diego. The women then
went on to the final, where they faced
UCLA, UC-Davis and Orange Coast
and dominated the three schools de
spite a strong headwind.

"It was a good weekend all around,"
said senior Leah Meagher. "Things
went as expected."
The Cardinal women trained right
up until they left for Los Angeles,
choosing to forego the typical rest pe
riod that usually precedes a race. The
Miller Cup practically served as a part
of the squad's training program, as
the Cardinal fully expected to win big.
The team viewed this weekend basi
cally as a tune-up to keep it sharp for
the Pacific 10 Conference champi
onships later next month.
Perhaps the most exciting race of
the afternoon occurred in the junior
varsity bracket, where the Cardinal
women avenged an earlier loss to UC-
Davis by defeating the Aggies in the
final. After racing even with Davis for

the first 700 meters, Stanford pulled
away, eventually winning by six sec
onds.
"They had a great middle thou
sand," coach Aimee Baker said of her
rowers. "Even after they got a lead,
they just kept on moving, and I was
happy to see that."
The team also earned first place
honors, beating USC, UC-San Diego
and Orange Coast, giving Stanford a
clean sweep in the eight-person cate
gory. The Cardinal squad found itself
in dead last at the start of the race, but
began to move after about 15 strokes.
Stanford raced neck and neck with
USC until the 1000-meter mark,
where the women finally pulled away
from the Trojans en route to a com
fortable victory. The Cardinal also

raced a four-person boat, which fin
ished second.
"They came off a pretty hard week
of training," coach Kristine Franson
said. "I was pleased to see that they
went out and had an aggressive race. I
thought they did well."
The Stanford women now have two
weeks to prepare for Big Row, the an
nual race against arch-rival Califor
nia. The race will be of special impor
tance for the novice squad, which will
challenge the Golden Bears for a sec
ond seed in the Pac-10 championships
held May 25 at Redwood Shores. The
Stanford varsity has already earned a
second seed in the conference tourna
ment, but is still looking to end the
season with a Big Row victory over
Cal.
