# An inside look at NCAA drug-testing procedures
## 
### 
It is often said that the road to hell is
paved with good intentions. I am not sure
if this saying is an official creed of the
NCAA, or if it is just a coincidence that the
organization abides by it. Either way, the
NCAA always seems to find a way to screw
up even the noblest of causes, such as ran
dom drug testing at NCAA events.
Don't get me wrong — I think that drug
testing in college athletics is a good idea. Ath
letes can easily fall victim to the allure of per
formance-enhancing drugs or to the anal
gesic benefits rendered from smoking mari
juana. It is naive to simply say that all ath
letes are smart enough to avoid these drugs,
just as it is ludicrous to insist that they all in
dulge in them.
So I applaud the NCAA for developing a
system of random drug testing in college ath
letics. However, after learning about the
manner in which these tests are adminis
tered, I can stop nothing short of condemn
ing the NCAA for yet another flawed solu
tion to a potentially dangerous problem.
I learned of the NCAA's ridiculous drug
testing program last weekend, when I at
tended the 1996 NCAA Men's Gymnastics
Championships held at Maples Pavilion. I
had a press pass for the competition and thus
witnessed the "behind-the-scenes" activities
of the event.
On Thursday night, I watched as my
roommate, junior lan Bachrach, had one of
the best meets of his college career. What
caught my eye, however, was not lan's mag
nificent performance, but the fact that fol
lowing the high bar competition, he was ap
proached by a man with a clipboard, who
made lan sign a small piece of paper — I later
learned that lan had been "snagged."
lan was told that he had been randomly

selected to participate in the NCAA's drug
testing program, and that he had the option
of taking the test immediately or waiting
until the end of the entire competition. Lan
chose to wait, so that he could focus solely on
the competition, rather than having to take
the time away from his team (which, for lan,
took over three hours).
lan's "snagging" highlights the first fun-

damental problem with the NCAA's pro
gram — why is there a need to disrupt an
athlete's competition, when he or she has the
option of waiting until the end of the cham
pionship to complete the test? As any athlete
will tell you, the pressure during an NCAA
championship is at times almost unbearable.
Is it really necessary to break an athlete's
concentration during one of the most crucial
athletic events of his life, when that athlete
doesn't even have to take the test until the
event is over?
The answer is no. I know many people
claim that if the athlete has not taken any
drugs, he has nothing to worry about. Obvi
ously that is true, but to me, that is not the
issue. At the very least, an athlete who is cho-
