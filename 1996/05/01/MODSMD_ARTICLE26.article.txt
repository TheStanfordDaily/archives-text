# An inside look at NCAA drug-testing procedures
## 
### 
It is often said that the road to hell is
paved with good intentions. I am not sure
if this saying is an official creed of the
NCAA, or if it is just a coincidence that the
organization abides by it. Either way, the
NCAA always seems to find a way to screw
up even the noblest of causes, such as ran
dom drug testing at NCAA events.
Don't get me wrong — I think that drug
testing in college athletics is a good idea. Ath
letes can easily fall victim to the allure of per
formance-enhancing drugs or to the anal
gesic benefits rendered from smoking mari
juana. It is naive to simply say that all ath
letes are smart enough to avoid these drugs,
just as it is ludicrous to insist that they all in
dulge in them.
So I applaud the NCAA for developing a
system of random drug testing in college ath
letics. However, after learning about the
manner in which these tests are adminis
tered, I can stop nothing short of condemn
ing the NCAA for yet another flawed solu
tion to a potentially dangerous problem.
I learned of the NCAA's ridiculous drug
testing program last weekend, when I at
tended the 1996 NCAA Men's Gymnastics
Championships held at Maples Pavilion. I
had a press pass for the competition and thus
witnessed the "behind-the-scenes" activities
of the event.
On Thursday night, I watched as my
roommate, junior lan Bachrach, had one of
the best meets of his college career. What
caught my eye, however, was not lan's mag
nificent performance, but the fact that fol
lowing the high bar competition, he was ap
proached by a man with a clipboard, who
made lan sign a small piece of paper — I later
learned that lan had been "snagged."
lan was told that he had been randomly

selected to participate in the NCAA's drug
testing program, and that he had the option
of taking the test immediately or waiting
until the end of the entire competition. Lan
chose to wait, so that he could focus solely on
the competition, rather than having to take
the time away from his team (which, for lan,
took over three hours).
lan's "snagging" highlights the first fun-

damental problem with the NCAA's pro
gram — why is there a need to disrupt an
athlete's competition, when he or she has the
option of waiting until the end of the cham
pionship to complete the test? As any athlete
will tell you, the pressure during an NCAA
championship is at times almost unbearable.
Is it really necessary to break an athlete's
concentration during one of the most crucial
athletic events of his life, when that athlete
doesn't even have to take the test until the
event is over?
The answer is no. I know many people
claim that if the athlete has not taken any
drugs, he has nothing to worry about. Obvi
ously that is true, but to me, that is not the
issue. At the very least, an athlete who is cho-


Todd
Bernstein
sen for testing has to separate from
his team for no less than an hour,
strip in front of strangers and uri
nate while an administrator watch
es. Such a procedure is nerve-rack
ing in any case, but especially when
an athlete is already burdened with
the pressure of competition.
There is no reason why the couri
er could not have waited until Sat
urday to confront lan. The NCAA
has a history of rigidness, often
being unable to exercise common
sense or to adapt to the changing cli
mate in college athletics. What I wit
nessed was just another case of the
organization's implacability.

Of even greater significance is
the process that was undertaken to
select the gymnasts for testing. All
of the gymnasts chosen for testing
were supposedly selected at ran
dom. However, six out of the 14
gymnasts chosen won at least one
event. Furthermore, there was only
one 1996 national champion that
avoided being selected for testing.
I refuse to believe that the testing
was actually done randomly. When
almost half of the test-group con
sists of champions, I have trouble
accepting the veracity of the ran
domness of the test.
It is time for the NCAA to make a
choice. Drug testing should either
be done before or after NCAA
events, and should either be con
ducted on all athletes or none at all.
It is unfair to scrutinize certain ath

letes because of their success, just as
it is wrong to let less successful ath
letes go untested. While compre
hensive drug testing is expensive
and sometimes inefficient, it creates
an even playing field for all athletes.
For far too long, the NCAA has
approached problems from the pe
riphery, basing its practices solely
on finances and the ease with which
measures can be taken. While
money dictates most things in
sports, it should not be allowed to in
terfere in the lives of young athletes.
The uncompromising, save-your
ass-at-all-costs entity that is the
NCAA must now start to think
about the athletes whom they gov
ern and focus on what it means to be
an athlete.
For the road to hell is shorter
than you think.
