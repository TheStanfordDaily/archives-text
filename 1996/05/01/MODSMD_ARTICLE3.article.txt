# Rice to trim budget by only $3.1 million
## Cuts fall short of original target 
### David Stein Contributing writer 
Veering away from its three-year initiative
to reduce expenses by $18 million, the Uni
versity will cut $3.1 million rather than the
planned $7 million from its budget next year.

According to Provost
Condoleezza Rice, a surplus
in unrestricted funds of just
under $15 million has al
lowed the University to
reach budget stability and
avoid the planned cuts.
"Although our initial
target was $18 million, we
have done much better in
cutting costs and in cost
control, so making the

added cuts was not necessary at this time,"
Rice said.
The budget plan reveals that the $3.9 mil
lion not directed toward the original $18 mil
lion reduction goal will be selectively reallo
cated to new programs and incremental infra
structure costs. An additional $8.4 million in
base general funds will also be allocated for
these purposes.
Rice added that the surplus will be placed

into the University Reserve — referred to in
budget documents obtained by The Daily as
the Provost's Reserve — to be used against in
come shortfalls in the future. The reserve is a
new feature of this year's budget plan.
"We've taken this $14 to $15 million re
serve at the beginning because there are 18
months between the time we calculate rev
enues and expenditures, and you always un
derestimate the amount of expenditures and
overestimate the amount of revenues," Rice
said. "This helps us from scrambling at the
end of the year."
Certain regulatory measures involving
new governmental costs and environmental
and health measures will be some of the first
projects funded through this increased re
serve, Rice said.
Two years ago, $6.1 million of unrestricted
funds were cut, while $4.8 million was cut in
1995-96. Rice said the University will fall just
short of its original target.
In the past, severe budget cuts have result
ed in financial losses for the Office of Student
Affairs and ethnic centers and decreased the
teaching assistant-to-student ratio.
Although cuts were avoided this year, Vice


Rice
Provost for Institutional Planning
Geoff Cox warned that the Universi
ty is not home free.
"We can't say that there are
going to be big cuts in the future nor
can we say that we're in the clear,"
Cox said. "Neither is a viable op
tion."
Cox summed up the University's
budget strategy as protection
"against a changing revenue fore
cast."
Budget figures predict revenues
of $1.41 billion — a 5.6 percent
growth from this year — and expen
ditures of $1.38 billion — a 4 percent
increase over the estimated year
end results for 1995-96.
Similar to previous years, the
majority of expenditures, 51 per
cent, will be devoted to salaries and
benefits. Faculty can expect salary
increases of 3 percent while staff will
receive a 2.5 percent increase.
In total, the budget plan projects
a bottom-line surplus of close to $21
million, largely due to the transfer of
unrestricted to unrestricted desig
nated funds — general University
money dedicated to specific purpos
es by the Board of Trustees or the
administration.
The unrestricted surplus is de
signed to protect the University
from possible cuts in federal re
search funding and the impact of the
loss of graduate student tuition re
mission beginning in 1997-98, the
budget plan reports.
Cox added that with another fed
eral budget battle ready to begin in

the fall, the University is "nervous"
about its share of funding.
In addition, the budget plan pre
dicts that unrestricted funds will be
helped by substantial increases in
endowment income and further
money pooled from restricted funds,
for a total of an additional $11 mil
lion.
The endowment income, which
will contribute $5 million to the bot
tom line, was nearly 14 percent
higher than its projected value.
Although the University will run
a surplus, it plans to cut more than
$1.6 million from its academic units,
a 1.2 percent decrease from 1995-96
figures.
The brunt of this financial bur
den will be felt by the Hoover Insti
tution, the dean of research and the
Law School with decreases of 4 per
cent, 2.8 percent and 2.4 percent, re
spectively.
The School of Humanities and
Sciences will sustain a reduction of
close to $600,000, although the
Provost will make a one-time alloca
tion of $500,000 in 1996-97 to give
the school time to readjust its fi
nances. As part of this agreement,
the school will develop a strategy for
the use of its resources on depart
mental and faculty levels.
"We decided to allocate this
money to [the School of Humanities
and Sciences] so it could meet the
budget gap based on its resources,"
Rice said. "In this case, we did not
want the school to have to cut its
programs."
With these reductions, howev
er, the School of Humanities and
Sciences and the School of Educa
tion will receive additional funding
to encourage the appointments of

minority faculty.
In the School of Engineering, de
partmental reductions will be han
dled by the school's own allocation
process. According to the budget
plan, graduate student financial aid
and precollegiate community pro
grams will be likely targets of reduc
tions.
The budget plan reports that the
school will recover some of its lost
funding from the Stanford Instruc
tional Television Network. In addi
tion, funding will be provided for
local health and safety costs and for
two faculty positions, one in systems
engineering and one in computa
tional prototyping.
Moreover, the school plans to
spend $2.5 million for construction
costs related to the Gates Computer
Sciences Building and for furnish
ing the Center for Integrated Sys
tems extension. These costs, which
are expected to continue for the next
couple of years, will result in de
creases in the 1996-97 balances of
$1.8 million.
Aside from these academic cuts,
administrative units will face more
than $1.5 million in reductions.
The Office of Development —
which handles fund raising for the
University and will suffer a $132,000
loss — will continue to streamline its
operations, consolidating Humani
ties and Sciences Development with
University Development and elimi
nating un needed positions.
Vice President of the Office of De
velopment John Ford said the con
solidation was due to strategic,
rather than financial, concerns.
The School of Humanities and
Sciences "just doesn't have the same
identity as some of the other schools

at the University," Ford said. "But
because a lot of the University's
agendas blend nicely with [the
school'si agenda, consolidation of
the two was the best move. (The
School of Humanities and Sciences]
will now receive just as much, if not
more."
Ford added that the shift result
ed in three layoffs in Humanities
and Sciences Development.
The Office of Student Affairs will
incur a reduction of $150,000, but
the budget plan reports that it
should meet the majority of its bud
get cuts by withholding inflationary
increases from most line items.
Among the administrative units,
infrastructure will receive the most
in newly allocated funds. The bud
get plans allots $2 million for
planned maintenance, $ 1 million for
upkeep and remodeling of the Gates
Computer Sciences Building and
the Stanford Art Museum and $3.4
million for seismic strengthening
and building additions.
The budget plan assumes the in
crease will be approved again, allow
ing $7.5 million in unrestricted
funds relief.
Based on its policy of providingfi
nancial aid for all who demonstrate
need, the University has committed
$119 million to help support both
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents.
However, the budget plan re
ports that planning efforts are un
derway to accommodate the strain
on the financial aid system when tu
ition grants will not be given to grad
uate students starting in 1997-98.
According to Dean of Graduate
Policy George Dekker, the Universi
ty itself, rather than the graduate

students, will directly feel this cut.
"As far as I can tell, we're in good
shape to deal with the tuition remis
sion, and the graduate students, for
the most part, will not be aware of
any changes," Dekker said. "But,
the tuition remission is forcing us to
revamp our internal budgeting."
At present, Dekker said, tuition
is paid as part of the staff benefits
package, a percentage of the wages
allotted to each faculty member. As
this process will be discontinued in
1997, the tuition will then come out
of the grants and research contracts
awarded to the University. Dekker
put the cost to the University at ap
proximately $2 million.
Dekker said the salaries for
teaching and research will not di
minish, but will merely come from a
different part of the University's fi
nances.
There may be fewer graduate
students due to the loss of tuition re
mission, Rice said. "But the gradu
ate students that are admitted
won't see any difference," she said.
Rice added that the staff benefits
rate will increase to 29.7 percent
this year, an increase of 3.5 percent
from last year.
In addition, additional income
for next year will be provided by 4
percent increases in both tuition
and room and board, a figure 1 per
cent over inflation.
"We are very pleased that we will
be able to maintain our reserve with
only a moderate growth of tuition,"
Rice said.
Rice will present these figures to
morrow at the Faculty Senate meet
ing. The 1996-97 budget will be pre
sented to the Board of Trustees for
approval in the second week of June.
