# Rice to trim budget by only $3.1 million
## Cuts fall short of original target 
### David Stein Contributing writer 
Veering away from its three-year initiative
to reduce expenses by $18 million, the Uni
versity will cut $3.1 million rather than the
planned $7 million from its budget next year.

According to Provost
Condoleezza Rice, a surplus
in unrestricted funds of just
under $15 million has al
lowed the University to
reach budget stability and
avoid the planned cuts.
"Although our initial
target was $18 million, we
have done much better in
cutting costs and in cost
control, so making the

added cuts was not necessary at this time,"
Rice said.
The budget plan reveals that the $3.9 mil
lion not directed toward the original $18 mil
lion reduction goal will be selectively reallo
cated to new programs and incremental infra
structure costs. An additional $8.4 million in
base general funds will also be allocated for
these purposes.
Rice added that the surplus will be placed

into the University Reserve — referred to in
budget documents obtained by The Daily as
the Provost's Reserve — to be used against in
come shortfalls in the future. The reserve is a
new feature of this year's budget plan.
"We've taken this $14 to $15 million re
serve at the beginning because there are 18
months between the time we calculate rev
enues and expenditures, and you always un
derestimate the amount of expenditures and
overestimate the amount of revenues," Rice
said. "This helps us from scrambling at the
end of the year."
Certain regulatory measures involving
new governmental costs and environmental
and health measures will be some of the first
projects funded through this increased re
serve, Rice said.
Two years ago, $6.1 million of unrestricted
funds were cut, while $4.8 million was cut in
1995-96. Rice said the University will fall just
short of its original target.
In the past, severe budget cuts have result
ed in financial losses for the Office of Student
Affairs and ethnic centers and decreased the
teaching assistant-to-student ratio.
