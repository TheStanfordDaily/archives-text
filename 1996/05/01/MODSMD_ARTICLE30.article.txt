### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
Twelve U.S. journalists with a variety of
interests were awarded Knight Fellowships
for the 1996-97 school year yesterday.
"We are pleased to get another group of
outstanding journalists," said Communica
tion Prof. James Risser, director of the
Knight Fellowships program.
Each member of the elite group will take a
leave of absence from his or her current job to
study at Stanford. During the year, the fel
lows will take classes from a number of de
partments and research journalism topics of
their choice.
"Many professors say that they like having

Knight Fellows in their classes because they
bring an older voice and experience to class dis
cussion," Risser said. "Many are also asked to
give guest lectures and talks at dormitories."
Knight Fellow candidates undergo a
tough application process, Risser said. They
must submit an essay about their careers
and an essay outlining their study plans, as
well as letters of recommendation and sam
ples of their work.
"It's a wonderful opportunity," said Joan
Laatz Jewett, an environmental writer for
the Portland Oregonian, who all last week
prepared herself for rejection until she re
ceived word of her acceptance Monday morn
ing. "I can't think of a better opportunity."
In addition to the U.S. fellows, six or seven

international Knight Fellows will be named
within the next two weeks, Risser said.
Susan Caba, a staff writer at the Philadel
phia Inquirer interested in the role of houses
and their relation to individuals and commu
nities, said she hopes to contribute to the
University as a Knight Fellow next year.
"I will bring a willingness to participate in
whatever seminars, classes and individual
level interactions," said Caba. "I imagine
Stanford as a place that is not just intellectu
ally alive, but alive in opportunity."
Caba added that she is incredibly excited
about the fellowship.
"When people ask me when I am leaving,
I tell them I am already there mentally," she
said.

In addition to Jewett and Caba, the
Knight Fellows for 1996-97 include Alex
Beam, Boston Globe columnist; John Fen
sterwald, editorial page editor for the Con
cord Monitor; Michael Fields, deputy senior
editor for National Public Radio; Bill Gan
non, staff writer for the Newark Star-
Ledger; Marcia Kramer, assistant news edi
tor for the Washington Post; Meg Laughlin,
staff writer for the Miami Herald's Tropic
magazine; Rob Taylor, environmental writer
for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer; Maureen
West, opinions page editor for the Phoenix
Gazette; Kathy Wilhelm, Hanoi bureau chief
for the Associated Press; and Andrew Zajac,
statehouse reporter for the Akron Beacon
Journal.
