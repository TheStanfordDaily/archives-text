### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The ASSU Senate yesterday passed a res
olution supporting the University's Pro
gram in Science, Technology and Society,
which will no longer offer degrees after 1998.
The "Save STS!" resolution, which
passed unanimously, places the support of
the senate behind the nearly 50 STS majors
who are working to maintain the program in
its current state.
Materials Science and Engineering Prof.
John Bravman, senior association dean for
student affairs in the School of Engineering,
and STS Prof. Robert McGinn, acting chair
of the program, announced last Wednesday
the program will relinquish its degree-grant
ing authority but continue an honors pro
gram and establish an undergraduate minor
in 1998.
The senate resolution, along with the
names of about 1,300 students who have
signed a petition in favor of the STS pro
gram, will be taken to a meeting of the Fac
ulty Senate's Committee on Undergraduate

Studies today, ASSU Senate Chair Alane
Murdock said. Murdock is a student repre
sentative to the committee.
The senate vote "gives a powerful signal
to faculty and the University administration
that when they make decisions that involve
undergraduates, they need to involve them,"
junior Michael Putnam said, one of a hand
ful of STS majors to attend the senate meet
ing.
The resolution requests that the Univer
sity involve students in similar decisions
that may be made in the future. Students
have complained that they knew nothing of
the impending changes to the STS program
until receiving a letter and e-mail message
last week. They are now seeking extra time
to search for options to retain the program
in its current state.
"We're trying to work with the adminis
tration to overcome the barriers that led to
this decision in the first place," Putnam said.
Bravman cited lack of strong faculty com
mitment, coupled with a sharp rise in the
