## Stanford's Web page gets an updated look 
### Marni Leff Contributing writer 
The first question which will
likely come to most users' minds
when accessing Stanford's new
World Wide Web page is, "But why
is it blue?"
Though the color scheme might
seem more fitting for Stanford's
rival across the Bay, Christine
Quinn, who oversaw the new page,
explained the color scheme: "The
blue is supposed to represent the
sky.
"The designer was struck by the
contrast between the sandstone
buildings, the red roofs and the
bright blue of the sky," she said.
"One of Stanford's greatest appeals
is the weather, and so he incorpo
rated that element."
Haywood and Sullivan, a graph
ic design company based in Boston
specializing in multi-media pro
jects, developed the new site for
$15,000. Quinn and JefT Lewis, a
systems software developer, oper
ated the project under Terry Shep
ard, director of University commu
nications.
Students accessing the page will
be greeted with a new, more spa
cious look and easier ways to find
information about course offerings,
the academic calendar and other

materials, Quinn said.
The home page is designed to
serve as a brochure to welcome
users from outside Stanford, and it
includes pictures of the campus and
quotations about Stanford. Fur
ther down the page, direct links
allow users to access more specific
information about Stanford. These
links take users to more functional
pages intended for users from with
in the University community.
The project began last year when
University President Gerhard
Casper asked Shepard to consider
redesigning the Web space. Casper
felt Stanford's home page needed a
new look, Quinn explained.
"I think there has been a change
in the Web over time," Quinn said.
"In the early days, the idea was to
show a lot of content. Universities
and big companies focused on get
ting as much material as possible
into their sites.
"Now the paradigm has shift
ed," Quinn continued. "Organiza
tions and, in some cases, universi
ties want the pages to reflect who
they are, as well as presenting in
formation. The old page didn't real
ly speak to what Stanford is."
Organizing information to cater
to the different users of Stanford's
Web site was a major goal for their
project, Quinn said.
"We wanted to re-engineer space
in the best possible way for people
both inside and outside of Stan
ford," Quinn said. "We wanted to
combine real graphic design with
Web work and to really architect the
space. We did a search on the Web
for designers and we sent out 10 to
12 requests for proposals."
Of the six or seven companies
who responded to the requests,
Quinn said the task force to re

design the Web site chose Haywood
and Sullivan because the compa
ny's proposal represented strong
navigational ability and careful
thought.
Part of the reason for redesign
ing the site for the first time in two
years, Quinn said, was to make it as
appending as possible for incoming
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents, alumni and others.
"Increasingly, students, espe
cially graduate students, have ac
cess to the Web," Quinn said. "We
want prospective students who ac
cess the home page to want to stay
and look around. We want alumni
who look at the page to have a good
feeling about it, and for the press,

we want it to be elegant, with a di
rect link into news information for
them. Also, it's important that the
site is appealing to potential visiting
scholars."
Although the new site is open,
Quinn said many additions are
being considered for the future.
These changes, she added, will be
done mostly internally for now,
without hiring other consulting
firms.
"Nothing about the Web is stag
nant so I am sure there will be
changes over time," Quinn said.
"One of the things we are consider
ing is interactive chat rooms where
incoming students can chat with
on-campus students."
