## Stanford's Web page gets an updated look 
### Marni Leff Contributing writer 
The first question which will
likely come to most users' minds
when accessing Stanford's new
World Wide Web page is, "But why
is it blue?"
Though the color scheme might
seem more fitting for Stanford's
rival across the Bay, Christine
Quinn, who oversaw the new page,
explained the color scheme: "The
blue is supposed to represent the
sky.
"The designer was struck by the
contrast between the sandstone
buildings, the red roofs and the
bright blue of the sky," she said.
"One of Stanford's greatest appeals
is the weather, and so he incorpo
rated that element."
Haywood and Sullivan, a graph
ic design company based in Boston
specializing in multi-media pro
jects, developed the new site for
$15,000. Quinn and JefT Lewis, a
systems software developer, oper
ated the project under Terry Shep
ard, director of University commu
nications.
Students accessing the page will
be greeted with a new, more spa
cious look and easier ways to find
information about course offerings,
the academic calendar and other

materials, Quinn said.
The home page is designed to
serve as a brochure to welcome
users from outside Stanford, and it
includes pictures of the campus and
quotations about Stanford. Fur
ther down the page, direct links
allow users to access more specific
information about Stanford. These
links take users to more functional
pages intended for users from with
in the University community.
The project began last year when
University President Gerhard
Casper asked Shepard to consider
redesigning the Web space. Casper
felt Stanford's home page needed a
new look, Quinn explained.
"I think there has been a change
in the Web over time," Quinn said.
"In the early days, the idea was to
show a lot of content. Universities
and big companies focused on get
ting as much material as possible
into their sites.
"Now the paradigm has shift
ed," Quinn continued. "Organiza
tions and, in some cases, universi
ties want the pages to reflect who
they are, as well as presenting in
formation. The old page didn't real
ly speak to what Stanford is."
