## Zaz Harris: As unique as her name 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Editorial staff 
Editor's note: In 1968, Andy
Warhol made the oft-quoted (and
misquoted) statement, "In the fu
ture, everyone will be famous for 15
minutes." With that in mind, in
addition to the idea that everyone
has a story to tell, this article is the
second in a series about various
members of the Stanford commu
nity. Interview subjects are picked
entirely at random from the Stan
ford Directory.

The things in Zaz Harris' life
that are or have been "great" or
"awesome" include, in no particu
lar order, her former tae kwon do
instructor, her mother's horse, her
roommate Tanja, her boyfriend
Michael, the Stanford Band, "The
X Files" and the party she threw
for her high school classmates
after they graduated.
A freshman living in Twain,
Harris is as active as she is enthu
siastic. "There are a lot of people
fat Stanfordl who study a lot more
than I do," Harris admitted. "But
I'm not real concerned. I don't
have to be perfect. I'm smelling the

roses or whatever."
Harris has been doing things
her own way since early childhood;
hence, her unique name. "When I
was 2,1 was in the backseat of my
mom's car, and she said, 'How are
you doing back there, Alexandra?'
I said, 'I am Zazer.' I wouldn't an
swer to anything else."
Harris' family, none of whom
have names quite as unusual as
hers, includes her mother, Jo Ann,
who is the director of business and
finance at the private school that
Harris attended for 12 years in
Nashville, Tenn.; her father, Ran
dall, who is a divorce lawyer but
spends most of his time taking care
of the family farmlands; and her
15-year-old brother, Emerson,
who goes to boarding school in
Tennessee.
Han-is said she has lived in Ten
nessee all her life. However, she
does not have an accent. "My mom
is from Connecticut, and my dad is
from L.A. I can fake an accent, but
I don't have one."
Harris said her father and
mother divorced when she was in
eighth grade, which was one of the
few low points of her life. Harris
went to live with her mother, and
her brother went to live with her
father.
It was through a friend of her

mother's that Harris became in
volved in tae kwon do, she said.
Katherine Wieczerza was a col
league of Harris' mother, as well as
a martial arts instructor, and Harris
enrolled in Wieczerza's class during
the fall of her senior year. Wieczerza
soon became a role model and men
tor, Harris said.
"The class was really awesome.
It was really supportive and con
ducive to learning. The teaching
philosophy is so all-encompassing.
Once you learn to become a good
martial artist, you can apply it to the
rest of your life.
"One of the big themes is having
respect for senior belts and belts
below you. If a senior belt is talking,
you can't fidget. You call everyone
ma'am or sir."
Tae kwon do has also offered her
a sense of personal security, Harris
said. "It's a good way to get strong
and flexible. You kick ass. That's
what you're learning. You feel more
secure knowing if something hap
pened to you, you'd have a strategy
of defending yourself."
Harris, who is currently enrolled

in a tae kwon do class at Stanford, is
a blue belt, meaning she has reached
the sixth of the eight levels which
culminate in a black belt. She said
people who know her are rarely sur
prised by her interest in tae kwon
do. "I'm pretty aggressive. I don't let
people push me around."
Harris has experimented with
several other means of venting her
aggression: She played soccer for
eight years and was captain of her
high school team when she was a se
nior. "I just love soccer so much,"
said Harris. "It's the greatest sport
in the world. It's got finesse. It re
quires skill and endurance." Harris
currently plays on an intramural
soccer team.
According to Harris, another of
the greatest sports in the world is
horseback riding, which she and her
mother took up when Harris was in
eighth grade. "We have a horse at
home named Brooks," Harris said.
"He's so cool. He was a little spooky
at first, but we've worked him out of
that."
Harris is a member of Stanford's
equestrian team. However, because
she joined only this year, she is not
able to participate in shows. "Even
tually, I want to be able to jump at
shows and competitions," she said.
Harris' extracurricular interests

are not entirely athletic. Afler play
ing the piano for seven years, she
picked up the trumpet this quarter
and joined the Band. "I'm really
horrible now. [But] you fake it. You
just dance around and look happy."
Harris and a friend decided to
join the Band during Big Game last
November. "It seemed like a whole
lot of fun. How can you not like peo
ple who run around in drag, playing
music trashed?"
As for the small matter of acade
mics, Harris said she is "definitely a
techie. I'll probably major in engi
neering or CS."
So far, classes have gone relative
ly smoothly, with only one excep
tion. During fall quarter, Harris was
enrolled in Math 43 and misunder
stood the P / NC system. "The com
puter said, 'Do you want the option
of P / NC?' I thought, 'Well, I want
all the options I can have,' " Harris
said. However, she unknowingly
opted not to receive a grade in a class
in which she was almost guaranteed
to do well, and she did not discover
her mistake until late in the quar
ter.
"I wrote this beautiful plea to
(the Office of Academic Standing],"
Harris said. "They almost never
change it, but they changed it for
me."
