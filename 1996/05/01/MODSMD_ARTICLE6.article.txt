## Zaz Harris: As unique as her name 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Editorial staff 
Editor's note: In 1968, Andy
Warhol made the oft-quoted (and
misquoted) statement, "In the fu
ture, everyone will be famous for 15
minutes." With that in mind, in
addition to the idea that everyone
has a story to tell, this article is the
second in a series about various
members of the Stanford commu
nity. Interview subjects are picked
entirely at random from the Stan
ford Directory.

The things in Zaz Harris' life
that are or have been "great" or
"awesome" include, in no particu
lar order, her former tae kwon do
instructor, her mother's horse, her
roommate Tanja, her boyfriend
Michael, the Stanford Band, "The
X Files" and the party she threw
for her high school classmates
after they graduated.
A freshman living in Twain,
Harris is as active as she is enthu
siastic. "There are a lot of people
fat Stanfordl who study a lot more
than I do," Harris admitted. "But
I'm not real concerned. I don't
have to be perfect. I'm smelling the

roses or whatever."
Harris has been doing things
her own way since early childhood;
hence, her unique name. "When I
was 2,1 was in the backseat of my
mom's car, and she said, 'How are
you doing back there, Alexandra?'
I said, 'I am Zazer.' I wouldn't an
swer to anything else."
Harris' family, none of whom
have names quite as unusual as
hers, includes her mother, Jo Ann,
who is the director of business and
finance at the private school that
Harris attended for 12 years in
Nashville, Tenn.; her father, Ran
dall, who is a divorce lawyer but
spends most of his time taking care
of the family farmlands; and her
15-year-old brother, Emerson,
who goes to boarding school in
Tennessee.
Han-is said she has lived in Ten
nessee all her life. However, she
does not have an accent. "My mom
is from Connecticut, and my dad is
from L.A. I can fake an accent, but
I don't have one."
Harris said her father and
mother divorced when she was in
eighth grade, which was one of the
few low points of her life. Harris
went to live with her mother, and
her brother went to live with her
father.
