# ASSU solves senate situation
## Senate follows committee's advice for no special election 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
In a special meeting last night,
the ASSU Senate voted to adopt
the recommendations of its Con
stitutional Transitional Commit
tee, eliminating the possibility of
a special senate election.
The committee requested that
the 15 graduate and 15 under
graduate students who received
the highest number of votes in

the spring general election become members of the
new senate, while the remaining 10 members of the
senate-elect will be ex officio, losing their voting
power as alternates.
"This is the most fair way to bypass having to do
a whole new election and to go along with the intent
of 'Constitution '96,' " said graduate senator Jessi
ca Koran, the chair of the committee.
The recommendations of the committee also in
cluded a provision for an initiative question on the
presidential ballot that would allow voters to call a
new senate election in the third week of fall quarter,
if they feel it is necessary.

The senate called for a special election, to be held
May 22 and 23, for a graduate student council.
Graduate senator Sandeep Singhal said the exis
tence of a graduate student council, to be elected in
the spring general election, was specified in ASSU
Bylaws.
"The existence of a graduate student council was
never advertised," he said.
Singhal, however, acknowledged that the exis
tence of such a council was contingent upon certifi
cation and ratification of "Constitution '96."
The senate also gave previous notice to a bill that
will pave the way to the adoption of the bylaws in ac
cordance with "Constitution '96."
In other action, ASSU Financial Manager John
Hall reported that the Stanford Management Com
pany has given Cardinal Collection and ASSU Lec
ture Notes 30 days notice to leave their current
places in Tresidder Union, in preparation for the ar
rival of Polio's this fall.
Hall assured the senate that the fate of these or
ganizations was secure and that space in Tresidder
would be found to house them.
Senate Chair Alane Murdock also reported that
Solomon Ijefler has resigned as parliamentarian.
Lefler said he resigned due to time constraints.
