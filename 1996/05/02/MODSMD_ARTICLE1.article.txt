## New phones will mitigate emergencies 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Seventy-five emergency phones will be installed on
campus over the next three years as part of an effort to
improve campus safety.
Recommendations for the location and type of emer

The first 19 phones will be installed this summer in
locations along Palm and Campus Drives at the front of
campus and near athletics facilities. The remaining

one in need of emergency help still has to dial the 911

The system includes a speaker for a victim to speak
