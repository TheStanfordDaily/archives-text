## New phones will mitigate emergencies 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Seventy-five emergency phones will be installed on
campus over the next three years as part of an effort to
improve campus safety.
Recommendations for the location and type of emer
gency phone were released in a report Tuesday by the
Stanford Department of Public Safety.
The first 19 phones will be installed this summer in
locations along Palm and Campus Drives at the front of
campus and near athletics facilities. The remaining
phones will be installed near residences on the east and
west parts of campus.
University President Gerhard Casper announced at
a town hall meeting yesterday that the University had
allocated $300,000 for the purchase and installation of
the phones.
The recommendations come in response to a pro
posal for student safety and campus security prepared
by members of the ASSU last year, although the
phones have been an issue for several years, Stanford
Police Lt. Del Bandy said.
Police alarms with blue lights were attached to sev
eral fire alarm boxes on campus until the late 1980s, ac
cording to the report on phone recommendations.
When the alarm system was changed, police alarms
were removed.
The proposed new alarms represent a significant
improvement to currently available options for con
tacting police in an emergency, Bandy said. Although
the number of public and campus phones at the Uni
versity has increased over the past several years, any
one in need of emergency help still has to dial the 911
emergency number.
The new alarms — 9-foot-tall units with flashing
blue lights — require only the push of a button to alert
police to the situation.
"We wanted something that was not going to re
quire a lot of manual dexterity to operate," Bandy said.
"It might be a case where someone is running from an
attacker, and they can't really stop and pick up a tele
phone handset or dial."
The system includes a speaker for a victim to speak
with a police dispatcher, Bandy said, but if the victim is
unable to do so, the location of the alarm will be report
ed and the speaker will pick up any conversation or
noise from the site.
Discussions on the akirm system
have been ongoing since September,
Bandy said, remarking that a deci
sion was made unusually quickly.
With plans to have 19 phones in
stalled by next September, the first
phase of the project will have been
completed in just one year. "That's
an unbelievably short amount of
time," Bandy said.
ASSU Senate Deputy Chair Bill
Shen, who helped author the stu
dent safety and campus security re
port, agreed that the scope of co
operation was remarkable.
"All the different bureaucracies
and departments and the ASSU in
unprecedented fashion were able to
work so quickly to produce some
thing so tangible for the students'
benefit," he said.
The locations of the phones are
designed to promote the Depart
ment of Public Safety's suggested
travel routes through better-lighted
areas of campus, Bandy said.
Placed strategically and in a sig
nificant number, the phones act as a
deterrent to crime, he said.
"If someone comes out and sees
all those phones all over the place,
they're going to know safety is a

high priority," he said. "The way
we've laid out the phones routes are
along the suggested travel routes.
We really want to channel them into
certain areas, which makes those
areas seem even safer with more
people traveling on them."

Campus safety is an issue some
times overlooked by administrators
who leave before dark, Shen said.
"Campuses operate 24 hours a day,
seven days a week," he said.
Funding from the Provost's Of
fice and the cooperation of the De
partment of Public Safety, Planning
Office and other groups shows a
commitment to safety, Shen said.
"We're encouraged and really ec
static that the administration has
shown a commitment to bring safe
ty at Stanford up to the standard of
other campuses," he said.
Shen said a second report on
campus safety — this time focusing
on lighting — will be released soon.
