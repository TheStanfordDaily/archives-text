The Stanford Homelessness Ac
tion Coalition gathered in White
Plaza yesterday evening to raise
concerns about the plight of the
poor and homeless in the local
community.
The coalition — a campus group
consisting of students, homeless
people and community members
— organized the "Night of Resis
tance" to address several actions
proposed by local businesses and
supported by the Palo Alto City
Council which they claim will ag
gressively remove the homeless
from public places.
These actions include ticketing
people who give money to panhan
dlers, buying homeless people a
one-way ticket out of town to a des
tination of choice and educating cit
izens to not give money to beggars.
The program last night was at
tended by about 40 people and in
cluded workshops led by the home
less on such topics as criminaliza
tion of the poor and how the home

less community deals with racism,
sexism, classism and homophobia.
John H., a former homeless per
son who participated in the rally,
said most people do not under
stand the reasons behind his plight
and that of his friends.
"Homelessness goes a lot deep
er than the view of people beg
ging," he said. "Unemployment,
divorces, relocation and layoffs all
contribute."
Later on in the night there was
a music session and candlelight
vigil in honor of people who have
died or are dying on the streets.
Members of the coalition said at
the demonstration that the home
less are viewed as a monolithic en
tity by society, and the govern
ment and general public fail to see
them as individuals.
John, a Virgin Islands native
who came to the United States
when he was a teen-ager, worked
for the government for six years
and then went on to secure a job
as a repair man. He soon resigned
after what he called "discrimina-

Tory practices."
John decided to enlist in the
army but was injured on the job
and as a result still suffers from os
teoarthritis.
Currently, he attends De Anza
College and plans to major in busi
ness administration. Of his home
less days, he said, "I had to beg, but
I don't feel guilty. I would rather
beg for food than steal from Safe
way."
Margaret Ash, a member of the
coalition and former homeless per
son, said she was "frustrated by
the minimum amount of services
available for poor people" in local
ministries. The coalition, she said,
is one of the few local organiza
tions advocating for the poor.
She stressed that its main goal
was giving hope to people who oth
erwise would have none.
John summed up the senti
ments of the evening: "As long as
we've got agencies like [the coali
tion], someday we'll find a golden
stair back to being accepted into
society as a someone."
