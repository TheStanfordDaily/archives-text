# Arafat speaks against Israelis
## PLO leader granted $20 million loan by World Bank

WASHINGTON (AP) - Accorded a
statesman's welcome by President
Clinton, Yasser Arafat lashed out at
Israel yesterday for keeping its borders
closed to Palestinian workers, then
picked up a $20 million World Bank
loan to help them.
The PLO leader accused Israel of
applying "collective guilt" for a series
of suicide bombings. The effect of the
travel restrictions, he said, has been to
deprive 120,000 Palestinians of their
jobs and to prevent export of their
goods.
"We are losing about $6 million a
day from this closure," he complained
during a speech to the National Press
Club.
By day's end, Arafat had arranged a
$20 million emergency rehabilitation
loan from the World Bank to help fund
40 projects. "I am very grateful,"
Arafat told the bank's president,
James Wolfensohn.
Arafat also affirmed his confidence
the Palestinians will have a state by
2000. "Yes, yes, yes," he said in
response to a question at the National
Press Club. "No doubt it is coming. No
one can hide the sun with his fingers."

Long despised in the West as a ter
rorist, Arafat advanced his transition
to statesman with a call at the White
House. In 45-minute private talks,
President Clinton agreed to establish a
joint commission for studying econom
ic problems of the West Bank and Gaza
and promised to step up efforts to per
suade donor countries to make good on
promises of almost $2 billion in aid.
"Our Palestinian people are facing a
very serious economic siege," Arafat
said in his speech. "Israel's military
occupation destroyed the infrastruc
ture of Palestine."
The spokesman for the Israeli
Embassy, Gadi Baltiansky, said later
his government has no intention of
damaging the livelihood of Palestini
ans.
"The closure was a measure we had
to take in order to prevent more ter
rorist attacks of the kind we suffered
only a few weeks ago," he said. "Since
then, we eased the closure and we will
continue to do so, according to our
security needs."
Earlier in the Oval Office, Clinton
praised Arafat for acting "under diffi
cult circumstances" to persuade the

Palestine Liberation Organization's
policy-making body to remove clauses
in its 32-year-old charter that mandat
ed an armed struggle to destroy Israel.
Asked yesterday whether the PLO
has given up its dream of taking all of
Palestine, Arafat, suddenly angry,
retorted: "This is an unfair question."
He refused to reply.
Generally, Arafat spoke warmly of
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
and of his peacemaking partner, Peres'
predecessor Yitzhak Rabin. He called
the assassinated prime minister a
cousin.
But Arafat several times deplored
steps taken by Peres to try to screen
out infiltrators, principally sealing of
the borders with territory controlled
by Arafat's Palestinian Authority. "I
hope Israel will reduce its collective
punishment against our people," he
said.
Arafat said Israel should combat
terror by complying with U.N. resolu
tions that demanded its withdrawal
from land the Arabs lost in the 1967
and 1973 Middle East wars.
"We are not looking for the moon-,"
he said.
