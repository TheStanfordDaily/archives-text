# Castro leads huge May Day parade

HAVANA (AP) — In a flamboyant cele
bration of communism designee! to defy the
United States, Fidel Castro presided over a
May Day parade yesterday with hundreds
of thousands of marchers waving Cuban
flags and carrying anti-American banners.
Cuba's first full-blown May Day celebra
tion in three years also was meant to show
renewed confidence and resources as the
country recovers from a disastrous econom
ic crisis caused by the collapse of its socialist
allies in Europe.
Patriotic music blasted from loudspeak
ers across the Plaza of the Revolution as
Castro stood on a marble platform and
peered through binoculars at the river of
marchers. Above him was a 450-foot tower
honoring Cuba's independence hero Jose
Marti.
For the past two years, only small neigh

borhood gatherings marked the traditional
socialist and communist workers holiday,
with officials saying there wasn't enough
fuel or transportation for a big celebration.
Cuban officials billed thus year's march
as a rejection of the Helms-Burton Act that
tightens the U.S. embargo of Cuba, and as a
reaffirmation of Cuba's communist princi
ples.
Pedro Ross, the head of the Cuban labor
movement, opened the march with the tra
ditional cry of "Socialism or death! Father
land or death! We will be victorious!"
Among the guests in the reviewing area
were two figures from the Black Power
movement of the 1960s and 70s: Kwame
Ture — the former Stokely Carinichael —
and Assata Shakur, the former Joanne
Chesimard.
Shakur, a former member of the Black

Liberation Army, was convicted of killing a
New Jersey state trooper in 1973. She
escaped from prison in 1979 and went to
Cuba.
Organizers claimed nearly 1 million peo
ple took part in the three-hour parade. With
ranks sometimes 50 to 60 across, the num
ber of people was clearly in the hundreds of
thousands.
Signs — many of them printed — bore
slogans such as "Down with Helms-Bur
ton" and "U.S.A.: Use Your Head!" Some
marchers danced to drummers beating out
Afro-Caribbean rhythms in a cacophony of
sound.
Cuban leaders, bolstered by signs of an
economic recovery, have grown more vehe
ment about their socialist principles since
the Helms-Burton Act passed the U.S.
Congress in March.
