Dole's staff dwindles to G7
WASHINGTON (AP) — Squeezed for cash, Bob Dole's campaign has shifted
dozens of staffers to Republican Party payrolls and let dozens more go, paring
his staff from a peak of 230 down to 67.
Moving campaign workers to the party payroll, common between primary and
general elections, allows the candidate to keep valuable staffers working for the
cause — getting Dole elected — without costing his campaign precious dollars.
The lion's share of the staff cuts and transfers to the Republican National
Committee were made about a month ago as the primaries wound down, Dole
spokeswoman Christina Martin said.
Half of the remaining staffers are in legal and accounting jobs. The rest are a
skeleton crew of administration, communications, scheduling and political
staffers. Those who were let go were involved in fund raising, event planning and
other campaign work. Some were state campaign workers whose jobs were elim
inated after the primaries.
"Once you get past the primaries you scale back," Martin said.
She declined to say how many people were let go.
