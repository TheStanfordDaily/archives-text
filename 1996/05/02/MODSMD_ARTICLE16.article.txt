## Good work on C '96 
### 
Casper, ASSU Senate
making the right moves
on approving new plan

IN A SURPRISING display of
decisiveness and cooperation, the
ASSU Senate unanimously voted
Tuesday night to accept the recom
mendations of its Constitutional
Transition Committee and proceed
accordingly with the work of imple
menting Constitution '96.
Additionally, at yesterday's "Tea
and More Cookies" forum, Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper, in
response to a question from COP
member Rich Stolz, said that he is
prepared to submit his formal accep
tance of Constitution '96 to the
ASSU Senate as soon as he procedu
rally able to do so.
These are two important and pos
itive steps in the path to Constitu
tion '96's implementation, and all
parties involved deserve credit.
After some initial problems,
ASSU leaders formed a committee
charged with drafting recommenda
tions on constitutional transition
which was both fair and competent.
The committee, which included both
supporters and opponents of the new
constitution, worked quickly to
develop a comprehensive set of
guidelines for the senate to follow in
implementing Constitution '96.
The committee's recommenda
tions call for the new single president
and vice president to be elected in a
special election held on May 22-23,
for the new senate to be comprised of
the top 15 undergraduate and gradu
ate vote-getters in the recent election
and for the bottom five senators
from each community — who would
have been non-voting senators
under the old constitution — to be
ex-of(icio members of the senate.
However, these plans are all con
tingent upon Casper's prompt accep
tance of Constitution '96. In order
for an election to be held May 22, the
senate must ratify Casper's condi

tions and interpretations of the new
constitution by May 16. Casper will
not formally receive the document
until after the senate's May 7 meet
ing, at which time the results of this
month's election will be official.
Fortunately, the administration
seems just as eager to keep Constitu
tion '96's implementation on track
as does the ASSU. At Casper's
request, Dean of Students Marc Wais
and Office of Student Activities
Director Nanci Howe have been
examining Constitution '96 and are
preparing recommendations for the
president's letter of acceptance.
Casper has also directed the Univer
sity's Ivegal Office to begin its exami
nation of the document.
Casper is apparently well ahead of
the gome, ready to tike up his part of
the approval process as soon as the
senate turn Constitution '96 over to
him. At yesterday's "Tea and More
Cookies," in fact, he said that he
anticipates presenting his letter of
acceptance — with conditions and
interpretations, of course — to the
senate on May 8, the day after he will
first receive the document.
Casper should be applauded for
his firm commitment to a timely
implementation of Constitution '96.
Students voted for its passage over
whelmingly; it is to be assumed that
those students wish to see the
changes for which their ballots were
cast as soon as possible. Casper's
actions will help ensure that occurs.
At the same time, that both the
dean of students and the Legal Office
are already examining the document
demonstrates that appropriate pres
idential attention is being paid to this
milestone for the ASSU. What is par
ticularly impressive is that Casper is
not abandoning his responsibility to
review changes to the ASSU Consti
tution in an undue haste to approve
Constitution '96.
Both the senate and the adminis
tration, have been making all the
right moves in working to ensure
Constitution '96's prompt imple
mentation. It's nice to see the stu
dent government and the University
administration working together for
a chantre.
