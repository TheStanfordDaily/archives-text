Students should consider Citibank's involvement in Burma

MOST OF YOU know about
Burma and SEAS's campaign to
stop Taco Bell from coming to
campus and to encourage Stanford to
reconsider its corporate investments in
companies in Burma such as PepsiCo,
Texaco and Unocal. After hearing Zar
Ni's speech on Monday night, many of
you may have wondered what you could
do beyond signing a petition or simply
sympathizing with the cause.
Look no further than the entrance to
the Stanford Bookstore. An enticing dis
play of free t-shirts and stuffed animals
will lure you to sign an application for a
Citibank and Unocal credit card. Before
you mindlessly sign away and garner the
prize, consider what your dollars may be
supporting as you pay off the future bal
ances on that credit card.
UNOCAL (Union 76) is one of the
U.S. corporations bankrolling Burma's

brutal military regime, the SLORC. This
California-based multinational is cur
rently a partner with French govern
ment-owned Total in a natural gas
pipeline project that will cut through the
rain forest in southern Burma in order
to bring natural gas to neighboring Thai
land. Ethnic cleansing and forced reloca
tion of indigenous communities have
been SLORC's methods for securing the
route for UNOCAL over the opposition
of ethnic groups in the area. Putting
those same oppressed indigenous people
to work through slave labor has been the
SLORC's method for constructing a rail
road in southern Burma that will con
nect with the pipeline and for clearing
the ground of the pipeline itself.
Upon completion, this project will
generate hundreds of millions of dollars
for SLORC. In the last five years
SLORC has spent over $1.5 billion on

arms, doubled the size of its army, and
allocated more than 50 percent of the
national budget for arms expenditures.
The project provides no benefit to U.S.
consumers and certainly won't help the
hundreds of UNOCAL employees laid off
due to "corporate downsizing" in Los
Angeles.
Joining the fight for social justice as
we have with this long-running campaign
at Stanford is often no more than inform
ing yourself about what is happening in
the greater world around you. Often, the
connections find their way back to your
immediate environment. The "Think
Globally, Act Locally" mantra has never
been more relevant than in the intercon
nected world we inhabit. Please do not
leave your academic inquiry and tough
natured critical thinking in the class
room. Think twice about signing yourself
away to UNOCAL.

Corporations are now beginning to
feel the student-led squeeze on the
Burma issue. Witness PepsiCo's recent
partial pull-out. UNOCAL will hold a
shareholders meeting in early June
when a resolution will come to the table
about human rights violations in Burma
and UNOCAL'S complicity in SLORC's
well-documented atrocities against 45
million Burmese. As shareholders in
UNOCAL, Stanford Trustees must also
take into consideration ethical and
moral implications of its tacit invest
ment support and vote our proxies
accordingly. Our institution should not
be partners in unethical business prac
tices. Collectively, let's put our money
where our hearts lie, with the struggle
of the Burmese people and with our own
fight for corporate responsibility.
