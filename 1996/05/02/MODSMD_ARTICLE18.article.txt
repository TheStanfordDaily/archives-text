# ASSU committee upset by decision on STS
## 
### 
- "Three aspects of the University's
decision to drop STS are particularly
Worrisome to us. Our first concern is for
underclassmen who have chosen to
mtgor in STS with the full expectation
that the program would receive long
tefm support by either the School of
.Engineering, the School of Humanities
and Sciences or both. The decision to cut
SfS has been made without adequate
planning regarding options that each

school should make available to these
students in t he absence of an STS mtyor
We question why it is not possible to
continue the STS major until 1999,
when this year's freshmen will graduate.
Second, the lack of administrative
interest in STS is one more signal that
Stanford's appreciation for fields of study
which do not draw big research dollars to
the University is deteriorating. Does any
body care about teaching anymore? STS
offers a terrific opportunity for students
to realize the significance, not just the
facts, of science and technology, and to
learn from some of the Stanford's top pro
fessors in a multitude of fields. No univer

sity, however research-oriented it may be,
can afford to produce scientists and schol
ars who lack the sense of professional
responsibility that only an understanding
of technology's societal impact can impart.
Doing away with the STS major may
nudge Stanford down that path.
Third, it is disconcerting that stu
dents were not consulted before the deci
sion to drop STS was made. The meet
ings between administrators and STS
majors this week were sensible, but as
usual students were only consulted after
the fact. At last week's ASSU Senate
meeting. President Casper asserted that
student opinion is valued by University

faculty and staff. We wonder why Presi
dent Casper's subordinates have not also
taken this philosophy to heart. Every
Stanford student should be concerned
about the fate of the STS major. The
University's commitment to teaching
and its respect for us, its students, are
the real issues behind the University's
decision. We are convinced that the deci
sion to drop STS was made without ade
quate input or explanation, and we hope
the decision will be reconsidered.
