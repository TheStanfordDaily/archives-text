# Tea, cookies and signs of relief
## Casper agrees to consider University funding of Women's Center 
### Nadia Elghobashi Contributing writer 
In an informal open meeting
with students yesterday, Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
gave "somewhat of a promise"
that the administration would
help fund the Women's Collective.
Continuing a series of dia
logues known as "Tea and More
Cookies with Gerhard Casper,"
the president addressed about 100
students in Tresidder Union's
Oak Lounge on issues ranging
from the Women's Collective's
loss of its special fee to the lack of
tenured female professors.
Casper began the meeting by
immediately addressing the issue
of the financial future of the
Women's Center. Students had
laid a trail of fliers throughout
campus leading up to the podium
calling for University support of
the center.
"I certainly hope we will work
out these problems in a spirit you
all will approve of," he said.
Casper said "the present mess"
of the center's lack of funding was
a complicated issue due to the his
tory of the complex ASSU voting
process. "The traditions of voting
are hard to explain and even hard
er to penetrate," he said.
Casper said because students
are delegated the responsibility of
allocating money, they are the
ones who ultimately decide what
is important to them.
He pledged to consider provid
ing University assistance for the
center, suggesting that students
submit a proposal, including a
line-item budget, which spells out
what the money would be used for.
Casper emphasized that the pro
posal should focus primarily on
the academic nature of the center.
Although Casper recognized
that it was easy for people to raise
expectations which cannot be met,

University President Gerhard Casper addresses students at Tresidder Union at the occasional get-together known as
"Tea and More Cookies." Although concerned delegations from the Women's Center and the STS program ate their
share of cookies, yesterday's 90-degree temperatures meant that very little tea was ultimately consumed.
