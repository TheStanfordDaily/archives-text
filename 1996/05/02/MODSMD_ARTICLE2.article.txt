# Tea, cookies and signs of relief
## Casper agrees to consider University funding of Women's Center 
### Nadia Elghobashi Contributing writer 
In an informal open meeting
with students yesterday, Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper
gave "somewhat of a promise"
that the administration would
help fund the Women's Collective.
Continuing a series of dia
logues known as "Tea and More
Cookies with Gerhard Casper,"
the president addressed about 100
students in Tresidder Union's
Oak Lounge on issues ranging
from the Women's Collective's
loss of its special fee to the lack of
tenured female professors.
Casper began the meeting by
immediately addressing the issue
of the financial future of the
Women's Center. Students had
laid a trail of fliers throughout
campus leading up to the podium
calling for University support of
the center.
"I certainly hope we will work
out these problems in a spirit you
all will approve of," he said.
Casper said "the present mess"
of the center's lack of funding was
a complicated issue due to the his
tory of the complex ASSU voting
process. "The traditions of voting
are hard to explain and even hard
er to penetrate," he said.
Casper said because students
are delegated the responsibility of
allocating money, they are the
ones who ultimately decide what
is important to them.
He pledged to consider provid
ing University assistance for the
center, suggesting that students
submit a proposal, including a
line-item budget, which spells out
what the money would be used for.
Casper emphasized that the pro
posal should focus primarily on
the academic nature of the center.
Although Casper recognized
that it was easy for people to raise
expectations which cannot be met,

University President Gerhard Casper addresses students at Tresidder Union at the occasional get-together known as
"Tea and More Cookies." Although concerned delegations from the Women's Center and the STS program ate their
share of cookies, yesterday's 90-degree temperatures meant that very little tea was ultimately consumed.
he agreed to be faithful to his ten
tative pledge. "I don't make
promises I cannot keep," he said.
Junior Rula Razek, an active
member of the Women's Collec
tive, the organization which runs
the Women's Center, said the col
lective was satisfied with Casper's
response to their concerns.
"The Women's Collective was
pleased with what Casper said,"
Razek said.
Razek said the center's request
for funding has been a long-term
issue. Unlike other administration
funded organizations — such as the
campus ethnic centers, which re
ceive some money from the Univer
sity — the Women's Collective relies
almost entirely on revenue from the
special fee. Because the center's
part-time coordinator changes
every year, it is always in transition,
looking for money, Razek said.
"The special fee is more of a call
to action than a response to the

outcome of the special-fee vote.
We're asking for long-term fund
ing," Razek said.
in the session, Council of
Presidents member Rich Stolz in
formed Casper that the recently
approved ASSU constitution,
"Constitution '96," is ready for
Casper's approval. Casper agreed
to offer his interpretation of the
document by May 8 and jokingly
added he would approve it quickly
on the condition that Stolz protect
Casper from criticisms for approv
ing it too "speedily."
Casper said he is reading
through the current constitution
for the first time, calling it a "truly
wondrous document."
In response to a question ask
ing why Stanford does not have
more tenured female professors,
Casper cited figures to be present
ed at today's Faculty Senate meet
ing indicating a 61 percent in
crease in women faculty in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences in the last 10 years.
"We have a long way to go, but
we've made a fair amount of
progress," he said.
