## The
						paradox of the pastoral 
### 
TIIIS WEEK I was told that an
infrequently seen but important
friend considers homosexuality a
sin — and presumably me a sinner. But
there's nothing for my anger to take
hold of. Her distaste for me is lost
behind a facade of goodwill, maybe
transformed into something like pity.
If I yell at her, I'll feel like a heel. Say
ing nothing is unsatisfying, humiliat
ing and deceitful. So I thought maybe a
column would be best.
Her view and its elusiveness are not
uncommon. And many, like my friend,
consider it a part of their Christian
faith. In its Christian form my friend's
view is usually called "the pastoral
response," and is generally summa
rized as "love the sinnner, hate the
sin." In its secular formulation the lan
guage is different but the sentiment
identical: people attracted to their own
gender are not inherently bad, but
their attraction and any resulting
behaviors are. I am dubious on prag
matic grounds that such distinctions
are significant; people generally don't
live up to the promise to love someone
they consider unrepentantly sinful.
But this isn't my primary objection to
the pastoral position. I object because I
feel no one has the right to such a posi
tion. No one should presume to judge
which aspects of a person will be con
sidered their "being" and which to
bracket for reproval or damnation.

Those who feel as my friend does
can keep stick with the pastoral posi
tion if they wish. But understand that
I will consider you insignificantly dis
tinguishable from "pure" homophobes
who espouse unadulterated hatred. I'll
hold you to the same standard that I've
accepted for myself and refuse to sever
your beliefs from your being. For me,
bigotry makes a bigot. And you can
keep on "loving" me, but you will only
be met with indifference. I have no
time to nurse what's become primarily
an exercise for your own conscience.
Otherwise, you can accept my standard
and stop trying to hack apart my per
sonality just as I've refused to do with
yours. You'll probably have to square
your behavior toward me to match
your underlying opinions. I'm not
eager to see more vocal homophobes,
but I'd take hatred over pity any day.
Either way you may want to consid
er how comfortable you are with a
belief so hurtful and angering to others
they have no choice but to reject or
hate you. Is this the kind of person you
want to be? Or could you have lost
sight of something very fundamental
to empathy and understanding?
My only demand is that you adopt
more honest and enlightened protocols
for managing your belief. First, don't
expect yourself to be considered mod
erate or high-minded, less disliked or
more respected by me. The political

and social climate is too dark for me to
hand out kudos to the faintest allies.
Besides, I think this expectation is pre
sumptuous, naive and condescending.
Don't expect gratitude from me for the
slim distinctions you draw between
yourself and "true" purveyors of hate,
especially when you generated these
distinctions by ignoring my basic
understandings of my being and tried
to force upon me your own.
Second, don't attempt to conceal
your views from me, especially if
you're trying to be a friend to me. You
may feel these secrets are "for the
best," but you shouldn't try to have
your cake and eat it too — enjoying my
friendship and your own bigotry,
Secrets are an ugly business, inflamed
by denial and with no real purpose but
separating people. My experience has
been largely a story of secrets; finding
identity in them, struggling to emerge
from under them and finally building
new identities free of them. I have no
sentiment for secrets and I'm wearily
enraged each time I uncover another.
If you can't be honest, have the dignity
to not be deceitful and stay out of my
life.
