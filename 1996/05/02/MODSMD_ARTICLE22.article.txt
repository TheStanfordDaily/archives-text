# Josh Gohlke: Laughing leads to crying
## Confessions of a plagiarist: I hang my head in shame 
### 
WITH ALL THE meta-journalistic
egotism going on in the inner
pages of The Daily right now, I
must say that the trend has its tempta
tions. In short, I was forced to ask myself,
"Why can't 1 write a column all about
me? Why ain't I suddenly begin to con
sider myself the best subject currently
available?"
Unfortunately, that was exactly when
I lost all resolve. That was when the
ancient guilt finally overwhelmed me.
What guilt, you ask? The guilt of being a
complete sham. A face-man.
Seven months of well-received
columns have garnered me all kinds of
undeserved attention — oh, how unde
served! The fervor of my followers has
approached paramilitary proportions.
People I hate have loved me. And, yes, I
have basked in the blessings.
But, alack, I cannot join The Daily
columnist tradition of blatantly bragging
about my real or perceived fame, accom
plishments and literary prowess. My con
science has so far borne implicit decep
tion, but it halts at the possibility of
explicitly taking credit for the empire
wrought by these words — these words of

another man.
Curse you, Donald "Bud" Vigil! O,
Cyrano to my Christian, I wish I had
never traded my soul for your costly
ideas!
I will start this confession now as all
confessions start, at the seemingly inno
cent beginning. On a quiet September
night, I sat down to write my first column
and quickly realized that I was an aver
age Stanford student, a sheltered and
uneventful life behind and ahead of me,
no insight or angst to speak of.
The article I wrote that night, which
the pages of The Stanford Daily have
never seen, was entitled, "Dating at Stan
ford Sure Does Suck!" The funniest joke
was about masturbation, which I ram
bunctiously referred to as "slapping the
salami."
Needless to say, I was worried. The only
light in the house was coming from Bud's
window, so, column in hand, I trekked
down the hall to Room 209 — the first of
many such shameful journeys! — with the
perfectly pristine intention of having my
long-time friend proofread the piece.
"Gohlke," Bud said with a wince when
he had finished reading it, "I'm sure

you're good at all your communication
classes where you sit around and talk
about TV. But this is the sorriest hack
job I've ever read!"
Perhaps because I knew this to be the
awful truth, I could do nothing but burst
into hysterical sobs.
"Bud, what am I going to do?" I plead
ed. "This thing's due in 12 hours. You've
got to help me, man!"
"There, there," Bud said, reassuringly
touching my shoulder. "We'll see what
we can do."
He started by changing a few words,
rearranging a couple paragraphs, and
then, before I knew it, he was sitting in
front of my computer, typing out an
entirely new column.
"This is kind of harsh on the fresh
men," I feebly complained as I read it.
"And you make fun of Branner. I mean, I
liked I3ranner."
Then Bud's calm, unassuming
demeanor disappeared, and for the first
time I saw the powerful, evil genius who
would eventually consume me.
"Gohlke, do you want to be one more
insipid Daily columnist?" he demanded.
"Or do you want to fucking be some

body)r
Like everything, it got worse. Bud did
a similar rewrite of my second column,
which was originally titled, "Man, Food
Service Is So Bad!" By my third column,
we had entirely done away with the pre
tense that I had any creative input.
"Are you ready to get famous?" Bud
asked me.
"Yeah!"
"Are you ready to get girls?"
"Yeah!"
"Well, I — uh, I mean 'you' ~~ are
going to write a column about fraterni
ties, and this campus will never be the
same!"
Weeks turned into months, and every
deadline night would find me pacing the
hallway outside Bud's room.
"Is 'my' column ready yet?" I would
ask anxiously. "It's got to be funny, Bud.
Everyone thinks I'm funny."
"Don't pressure me, you little twit! My
creative process cannot be rushed!"
At length, he would finish. He would
hold out the lloppy disk, then retract it as
I grabbed in panic.
"Give it to me!"
"First sav I'm the man."

"All right, all right. You're the man,
Bud."
"And who's the whore?"
"I'm the whore, Bud. I am."
In recent months, Bud — or "His
Darkness," as he forces me to address
him — has grown even more malicious.
He allows me the public recognition, but
privately ruins it for me. Every time a
reader compliments me, I can only see
Bud's taunting smirk. When I show up at
the house with a new Pi Phi on my arm,
Bud leans over to whisper in my ear, "It's
me she loves. Without my words, you're
nothing."
It has become too much for me, this
psychological oppression, and I hereby
divest myself of the miserable lie.
Finally, I apologize if this column is
not as "funny" as you've come to expect.
The only excuse I can offer is that it's the
first one I've written.

Tunc in next Thursday for Josh Gohlke's
second column, "Jeez, the Stanford Post
Office Is Slow!"
