## How to keep more athletes in school 
### 
Allen Iverson leaves
Georgetown after his
second year. Stephon
Marbury jumps to the NBA
after just one year at Georgia
Tech. Kobe Bryant follows last
year's high school player-of
the-year Kevin Garnett by
skipping college entirely.
If you think these early
exits are the main problem
with big-time revenue sports,
you are staring at a splinter in
a finger when you should be
concerned with the stake
sticking out of the chest of col
lege athletics.
Just the fact that you think
the chasing and realizing of
childhood dreams, coupled
with the payoff of millions of
dollars, should be seen in a
negative light suggests an an
tiquated view of "amateur"
athletics.
With billions of dollars on

the line, we all know college
football and basketball are not
amateur sports. Those ath
letes who decide to end their
college careers early are trying
to do what coaches and admin
istrators have been doing for
years — reap some benefits
from their labor.
Why can a coach pick up
hundreds of thousands of dol
lars outside of his contract
through special appearances
and shoe contracts but an ath
lete can't even work during
the school year?
The blatant reason why
student-athletes cannot work
during the school year is be
cause colleges simply do not
trust one another to find legit
imate jobs. State U. worries
that its rival will give all its
football players phantom jobs,
gaining a recruiting advan
tage.
If you want to keep more
underclassmen in school, a
massive restructuring of the
grant-in-aid process must

occur. Here are a few alterna
tives to today's system, using a
men's basketball player as an
example.
• Pay athletes an hourly wage
for their supervised practice
time — 20 hours a week during
the season. The season
stretches from the middle of
October to the end of March,
about 24 weeks. At a competi
tive student wage of $7.50 an
hour, that comes out to
$3,600.
• Don't pay during the season
(that "payment" is assumed in
the full-ride scholarship), but
allow for jobs outside the sea
son. Let's take one quarter as
a conservative estimate for
off-time, working 15 hours a
week at the same wage. The
student would make $1,125.
• Eliminate athletic scholar
ships entirely, open athletes
up to the same type of finan
cial aid other students receive,
pay them for their playing
time ($3,600, as in the first ex
ample) and let them borrow
money against their projected
future earnings.
Of these three, the second
option seems to be both the
most easily instituted and the
least "professional." But prob
lems still exist.
If the NCAA does eventual
ly loosen the restrictions on
holding a job, the problems
won't be instantaneously
erased. The danger of corrup
tion, from inside a school's
athletic department and from
its more emphatic boosters,
lurks around the corner like a
middle linebacker eager to de
liver his payload.
The solution? Have the
NCAA establish an indepen
dent department with two
functions aimed at meeting
the student-athlete's needs.
The main goal of this "Em
ployment Supervisory Coun
cil" would be to monitor the
student-athletes' in-school
jobs.
As a group independent
from the individual colleges,
this would eliminate conflicts
of interest within athletic de
partments. Working hand-in
hand with the NCAA's Com
mittee on Infractions, this di
