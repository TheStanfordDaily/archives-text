## How to keep more athletes in school 
### 
Allen Iverson leaves
Georgetown after his
second year. Stephon
Marbury jumps to the NBA
after just one year at Georgia
Tech. Kobe Bryant follows last
year's high school player-of
the-year Kevin Garnett by
skipping college entirely.
If you think these early
exits are the main problem
with big-time revenue sports,
you are staring at a splinter in
a finger when you should be
concerned with the stake
sticking out of the chest of col
lege athletics.
Just the fact that you think
the chasing and realizing of
childhood dreams, coupled
with the payoff of millions of
dollars, should be seen in a
negative light suggests an an
tiquated view of "amateur"
athletics.
With billions of dollars on

the line, we all know college
football and basketball are not
amateur sports. Those ath
letes who decide to end their
college careers early are trying
to do what coaches and admin
istrators have been doing for
years — reap some benefits
from their labor.
Why can a coach pick up
hundreds of thousands of dol
lars outside of his contract
through special appearances
and shoe contracts but an ath
lete can't even work during
the school year?
The blatant reason why
student-athletes cannot work
during the school year is be
cause colleges simply do not
trust one another to find legit
imate jobs. State U. worries
that its rival will give all its
football players phantom jobs,
gaining a recruiting advan
tage.
If you want to keep more
underclassmen in school, a
massive restructuring of the
grant-in-aid process must

occur. Here are a few alterna
tives to today's system, using a
men's basketball player as an
example.
• Pay athletes an hourly wage
for their supervised practice
time — 20 hours a week during
the season. The season
stretches from the middle of
October to the end of March,
about 24 weeks. At a competi
tive student wage of $7.50 an
hour, that comes out to
$3,600.
• Don't pay during the season
(that "payment" is assumed in
the full-ride scholarship), but
allow for jobs outside the sea
son. Let's take one quarter as
a conservative estimate for
off-time, working 15 hours a
week at the same wage. The
student would make $1,125.
• Eliminate athletic scholar
ships entirely, open athletes
up to the same type of finan
cial aid other students receive,
pay them for their playing
time ($3,600, as in the first ex
ample) and let them borrow
money against their projected
future earnings.
Of these three, the second
option seems to be both the
most easily instituted and the
least "professional." But prob
lems still exist.
If the NCAA does eventual
ly loosen the restrictions on
holding a job, the problems
won't be instantaneously
erased. The danger of corrup
tion, from inside a school's
athletic department and from
its more emphatic boosters,
lurks around the corner like a
middle linebacker eager to de
liver his payload.
The solution? Have the
NCAA establish an indepen
dent department with two
functions aimed at meeting
the student-athlete's needs.
The main goal of this "Em
ployment Supervisory Coun
cil" would be to monitor the
student-athletes' in-school
jobs.
As a group independent
from the individual colleges,
this would eliminate conflicts
of interest within athletic de
partments. Working hand-in
hand with the NCAA's Com
mittee on Infractions, this di


Greg
Collins
vision would attempt to make
student-athletes aware of rules
and regulations while keeping an
eye on illegal payments.
This first function helps the
student-athlete while he is still
in school. The other side of the
equation deals with an advisory
board for student-athletes to ap
proach when questions of turn
ing pro arise.
As it stands now, if a student
athlete consults a lawyer about
his draft status, he is jeopardiz
ing his eligibility. Want to keep

more borderline prospects in
school for another year? Cive
them impartial advice, as op
posed to some from a coach who
wants to keep his star player
around to help get his team to
the Final Four next year or some
from an agent looking for his cut
from the potential contract.
About the only thing players,
coaches, administrators and fans
agree on is that the system as it
stands now is a farce. Student
athletes make millions of dollars
for colleges and the NCAA; in re
turn, they receive an education if
they want it. But that education
comes with a price — the athletes
are treated like property (look at
Tremaine Fowlkes' problems

getting released from his schol
arship at Cal) and exploited by
coaches and programs that care
little for them once they score
their last basket.
But the student-athlete
strikes back, "exploiting" the
school for a year or two to get his
name in lights and then goes pro.
Fans jeer him for leaving "their"
school and people cry out in the
name of education.
Unfortunately, this focuses
the spotlight on the most inno
cent of actors in this grand play,
the individual student-athlete,
when it should be working to ex
pose the ugliness of the industry
as a whole.
