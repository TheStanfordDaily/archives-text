# Woods cruises to 14-stroke victory
## Tiger runs away with Pac-10 title; team finishes fourth 
### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
Most athletes strive to break records. The very
best athletes aim to shatter them. And then there's
Tiger Woods.
At the Pacific 10 championships in Newport
Beach this week, the sophomore Ail-American
topped the course's previous single-round low not
once, but twice en route to running away with the
individual title and leading the 17th-ranked Cardi
nal to a fourth-place finish.
"Tiger played great, even for him," said head
coach Wally Goodwin. "Everybody says it, but he
really is just a tremendous golfer."
Woods jumped out of the gate with about as hot
a start as one can imagine, blazing through the first
round with an 11-under-par 61, shattering the pre
vious Pac-10 championship low by five strokes.
Cooling off only slightly, he promptly provided an
encore performance, firing a 7-under-par 65 in the
second round. Cruising through the final two
rounds, Woods became the first Stanford Pac-10
men's golf champion since Christian Cevaer in
1992.
Despite a double dose of Tiger, the Cardinal was
playing for second from the start as No. 2-ranked
Arizona State put a hammerlock on the lead imme
diately. The Cardinal posted impressive rounds the
first day, shooting 367 and 365, but the Sun Devils'
attack was relentless, leaving Stanford 12 strokes
back after two rounds.
"We had a spectacular first day," Goodwin said,
"but ASU was just too good. We couldn't expect to
challenge with them playing so well."
While the team was in a tight battle with USC
and arch-rival California, an off-round to start play
on the second day knocked the Cardinal out of con
tention. At the end of three rounds, the men found
themselves 31 strokes back in a very distant fourth
place. The squad recovered nicely, however, to close
out the tournament on a positive note.
"We were really just exhausted on the second
day," Goodwin said. "We spent so much mentally
trying to stay with ASU and it really showed in that
third round."
Apart from Woods, the team struggled individu
ally, failing to repeat its showing at BYU a week and
a half ago, when five Stanford golfers finished in
the top nine. Freshman Joel Kribel was the only
other Cardinal player to place in the top 20, shoot
ing 298 to finish 19th. Senior David Garcia was a
pleasant surprise, firing a 303 to place 30th. Sopho
more Eri Crum and senior captain Jerry Chang
trailed by five and six strokes to finish 42nd and
44th, respectively.
"For the most part, I was happy with the mental
toughness the team displayed," Goodwin said.
"David, especially — he really hung in there and
fought it out.
"This team is really inexperienced and for them
to handle a course as difficult as this really showed
a lot."
While the tournament had no direct bearing on
Stanford's postseason run at the NCAAs, Goodwin
stressed the importance of the meet as both a pre
poratory tool and as a gauge of progress.
"I can't stress enough how positive I am about
this team right now," Goodwin said. "Without ac-
