# Lacrosse closes '96 campaign
## Women put the wraps on their first season in Division I 
### Solveig Pederson Staff writer 
Usually at this time of year, the
Stanford women's lacrosse team is
gearing up for the final stages of the
Western States Women's Lacrosse
League playoffs. This spring, the
women are staying home.
That's because the Cardinal
chose to leave the Western States
League behind this season in order
to make the jump to NCAA Division
I, becoming the first team on the
West Coast to do so. But because the
women did not play the minimum 10
games necessary to be eligible for
NCAA postseason play, they won't
be participating in playoffs of any
kind.
However, Stanford ended its in
augural season in Division I tri
umphantly last weekend, winning
two out of its last three games during
a trip to Maryland.
Against Shippensburg in Penn
sylvania last Thursday, the Cardinal
was only down by one goal at half

time, 8-7, after the score see-sawed
all through the half. But Shippens
burg, an established Division II
team, capitalized on Stanford errors
to speed ahead in the second half,
holding Stanford to one goal. The
final tally was 18-8.
"Shippensburg was a disappoint
ment," said senior co-captain Wendy
Kula, "but it was a problem that's
plagued us all season, and that's con
sistency."
Head coach Kay Cowperthwait
isolated poor shot conversion and ac
curacy, as well as poor passing, as
contributing to Stanford's second
half performance.
The Cardinal had Friday to prac
tice before tackling Mount St.
Mary's and Ohio State on Saturday
and Sunday. Cowperthwait cited
Friday's practice, which focused on
pressure situations and shooting, as
the key to the weekend's victories.
Junior Liz Shinkman lit up the
goal against Mount St. Mary's, scor
ing four goals in the 14-5 win.
"She was open [in the middle] all

day, so they kept finding her," Cow
perthwait said.
Captains Peppie Stephenson and
Kula and freshman Nicole Whelan
tossed in two goals each. The contest
opened with the two teams trading
goals, but the Cardinal soon took
control, extending its lead to 7-4 by
halflime. Stanford then pulled away
from Mount St. Mary's, another new
Division I program, in the second
half.
Stanford followed up with anoth
er win against Ohio State on Sun
day. After leading by two at the half,
Stanford pulled together to triumph
by a 13-8 score.
"Defense was excellent," Cow
perthwait said. "We were double
teaming the ball all over the field."
New to the position this year,
goalie Elizabeth Franklin has shown
great progress all season, and this
weekend proved to be a resounding
finale to her 1996 campaign, as she
stopped seven Shippensburg shots,
six against Mount St. Mary's and 14
during the Ohio State game.
