# Kilburg coming into his own
## Sophomore outfielder is living out his childhood dream 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
In his second year as the leadoff
man in Stanford's baseball lineup,
sophomore Joe Kilburg has often
made things look very easy.
His play reflects his attitude to
ward the game, which he tries to
simplify as much as he can. Simpli
fy the stance. Simplify the swing.
What opposing pitchers are finding
out this season is that it is no sim
ple feat to get Joe Kilburg out.
Through 49 games this year,
Kilburg is hitting at a .365 clip, well
above his 1995 mark of .296. The
right fielder has reeled off hitting
streaks of seven, nine and 10
games (twice) so far and has gone
hitless in only seven games. Tues
day night's victory over the Uni
versity of San Francisco marked
the first time Kilburg has gone hit
less in two consecutive games in
1996, although he did score three
runs in the contest.
Head coach Mark Marquess
and Kilburg's teammates describe
the 5-foot-11, 185-pound outfield
er as simply an amazing athlete.
While baseball has always been his
first love, Kilburg also starred on
his high school hockey and soccer
teams. His success m those sports
led to scholarship offers.
"I got some partial and some
full-scholarship offers, but nothing
quite as big as Stanford baseball,"
Kilburg said. "I couldn't have
played hockey at Michigan or soc
cer at Duke. Baseball has always
been my sport — it's what I enjoy
the most."
The Bay Village, Ohio, native
said his baseball talent was made
more noticeable because it was not
the most popular sport in the area.
"Where I'm from, if you have
baseball talent, it puts you ahead of
others," Kilburgsaid. "Icouldhave
continued to play hockey, but I
would not have been much of a
stand-out because so many people
play. The biggest factor has always

been that baseball is the most en
joyable for me."
Kilburg said his decision to at
tend Stanford was an easy one to
make.
"With two teachers as parents,
and with the program Stanford
had — this was the one place I
wanted to go," he said. "I remem
ber watching the College World Se
ries on TV with my dad when Stan
ford won and I told him, 'I want to
go to Stanford and play in the Col
lege World Series.'
"My dad laughed a little — he's
a high school baseball coach, so he
knows what it takes to be at the col
lege level," Kilburg continued.
"But he didn't want to crush my
dream."
That dream became a possibili
ty when Kilburg was invited to
Stanford's prospect camp between
his junior and senior years of high
school.
"I wanted to go to the camp, but
I didn't have the money," Kilburg

recalled. "My grandmother
stepped up and gave me the money
to go on the trip and that started
the whole recruiting process."
Marquess recalls the athletic
prowess Kilburg showed that sum
mer.
"We saw him when he came out
to our camp and he really im
presvsed us with his athletic abili
ty," Marquess said. "We really
liked him — we didn't know what
his position would be, but we knew
he was an athlete and he would
play somewhere."
Stanford turned out to be the
only place Kilburg visited on a re
cruiting trip and the only place he
submitted an application. Little
more than a year after he first vis
ited the Farm, he was the starting
center fielder for the Cardinal. Kil
burg said last year was an excellent
chance to improve and gain valu
able experience.

Sophomore Joe Kilburg gets down and dirty during the Cardinal's
10-1 win over USF on Tuesday.
"Anytime you play as a fresh
man, you have to see it as an oppor
tunity more than anything," Kil
burg said. "It was my chance to con
tribute to the team. I wanted to do
the things the team needed from me
as best as I could."
One veteran teammate who Kil
burg said helped him make the tran
sition into the Cardinal program was
outfielder Sean Flikke, a senior this
year %
"Flikke helped me in a lot of
ways," KiJburg said. "He told me to
relax, play the game and use the tal
ent I had.'"
Flikke calls Kilburg a perfection
ist whose talent is limitless on the
baseball field.
"For Joey, first he was moved to a
new position from the infield to cen
ter, then he's flung into the top of
our lineup as our leadoff guy," he
said. "We hadn't had a true leadoff
guy in a while, so 1 think he felt a lot
of pressure. I think he felt like the
older guys were looking at him and
saying 'Joe, we need you to be great
for us to win.' What I told him was,

'You're one in nine — when you play
well that's great for us and there are
eight other guys out there trying to
doit too.'
"Now that he's been in there al
most two full seasons and he's re
laxed, he's really starting to mature
lis a player and his performance has
been outstanding."
Kilburg looks to set career highs
in almost every offensive category
this year. In 1996, Kilburg has tal
lied 73 hits, eight doubles, two
triples, five home runs and 35 runs
batted in. He has served his lead-off
role well, scoring 51 runs and steal
ing 17 bases.
"He's very versatile, he's got good
speed and he's really made himself a
solid hitter," Marquess said. "We're
really pleased with him — he's got a
chance to be (in all-league player thus
year."
Down the road, Kilburg would
like to have the chance to play pro
fessional baseball, although it is not
something he lets occupy his mind
too oflen.
"I think about it,"he said. "But I
always think of something A.J.
[HinchJ told me. He said, 'You can't
get drafted on one game, you can't
get drafted in a day.' I know it's not
what you do now, you just need to go

out and play. If you're good enough,
you'll get drafted. There's nothing
you can do other than play well.
"If I'm thinking, 'What do the
scouts want to see?,' then I won't
play good ball," Kilburg continued.
"I need to take the game for what it
is and help the team reach the team
goals we have this year."
Individual honors and the even
tual possibility of a professional ca
reer are at the back of Kilburg's
mind for now. What would make the
year successful for the Stanford star
is a return trip to the College World
Series in Omaha, Neb., where his
long-time dream came true last sea
son.
"Playing in the College World Se
ries was great," Kilburg said. "It was
pure excitement and adrenaline. It's
hard not to get caught up in the ex
perience, playing in front of 20,000
people — it was definitely a dream
come true."
While the experience will last Kil
burg a lifetime, he and his Cardinal
teammates know there is a happier
ending.
"It was great last year, but it can
be better," Kilburg said. "Hopefully,
we can go back this year and come
home with a national championship
— this year we'd like to win it."

right fielder has reeled off hitting
streaks of seven, nine and 10
games (twice) so far and has gone
hitless in only seven games. Tues
day night's victory over the Uni
versity of San Francisco marked
the first time Kilburg has gone hit
less in two consecutive games in
1996, although he did score three
runs in the contest.
Head coach Mark Marquess
and Kilburg's teammates describe
the 5-foot-11, 185-pound outfield
er as simply an amazing athlete.
While baseball has always been his
first love, Kilburg also starred on
his high school hockey and soccer
teams. His success m those sports
led to scholarship offers.
"I got some partial and some
full-scholarship offers, but nothing
quite as big as Stanford baseball,"
Kilburg said. "I couldn't have
played hockey at Michigan or soc
cer at Duke. Baseball has always
been my sport — it's what I enjoy
the most."
The Bay Village, Ohio, native
said his baseball talent was made
more noticeable because it was not
the most popular sport in the area.
"Where I'm from, if you have
baseball talent, it puts you ahead of
others," Kilburgsaid. "Icouldhave
continued to play hockey, but I
would not have been much of a
stand-out because so many people
play. The biggest factor has always

been that baseball is the most en
joyable for me."
Kilburg said his decision to at
tend Stanford was an easy one to
make.
"With two teachers as parents,
and with the program Stanford
had — this was the one place I
wanted to go," he said. "I remem
ber watching the College World Se
ries on TV with my dad when Stan
ford won and I told him, 'I want to
go to Stanford and play in the Col
lege World Series.'
"My dad laughed a little — he's
a high school baseball coach, so he
knows what it takes to be at the col
lege level," Kilburg continued.
"But he didn't want to crush my
dream."
That dream became a possibili
ty when Kilburg was invited to
Stanford's prospect camp between
his junior and senior years of high
school.
"I wanted to go to the camp, but
I didn't have the money," Kilburg

recalled. "My grandmother
stepped up and gave me the money
to go on the trip and that started
the whole recruiting process."
Marquess recalls the athletic
prowess Kilburg showed that sum
mer.
"We saw him when he came out
to our camp and he really im
presvsed us with his athletic abili
ty," Marquess said. "We really
liked him — we didn't know what
his position would be, but we knew
he was an athlete and he would
play somewhere."
Stanford turned out to be the
only place Kilburg visited on a re
cruiting trip and the only place he
submitted an application. Little
more than a year after he first vis
ited the Farm, he was the starting
center fielder for the Cardinal. Kil
burg said last year was an excellent
chance to improve and gain valu
able experience.

Sophomore Joe Kilburg gets down and dirty during the Cardinal's
10-1 win over USF on Tuesday.
"Anytime you play as a fresh
man, you have to see it as an oppor
tunity more than anything," Kil
burg said. "It was my chance to con
tribute to the team. I wanted to do
the things the team needed from me
as best as I could."
One veteran teammate who Kil
burg said helped him make the tran
sition into the Cardinal program was
outfielder Sean Flikke, a senior this
year %
"Flikke helped me in a lot of
ways," KiJburg said. "He told me to
relax, play the game and use the tal
ent I had.'"
Flikke calls Kilburg a perfection
ist whose talent is limitless on the
baseball field.
"For Joey, first he was moved to a
new position from the infield to cen
ter, then he's flung into the top of
our lineup as our leadoff guy," he
said. "We hadn't had a true leadoff
guy in a while, so 1 think he felt a lot
of pressure. I think he felt like the
older guys were looking at him and
saying 'Joe, we need you to be great
for us to win.' What I told him was,

'You're one in nine — when you play
well that's great for us and there are
eight other guys out there trying to
doit too.'
"Now that he's been in there al
most two full seasons and he's re
laxed, he's really starting to mature
lis a player and his performance has
been outstanding."
Kilburg looks to set career highs
in almost every offensive category
this year. In 1996, Kilburg has tal
lied 73 hits, eight doubles, two
triples, five home runs and 35 runs
batted in. He has served his lead-off
role well, scoring 51 runs and steal
ing 17 bases.
"He's very versatile, he's got good
speed and he's really made himself a
solid hitter," Marquess said. "We're
really pleased with him — he's got a
chance to be (in all-league player thus
year."
Down the road, Kilburg would
like to have the chance to play pro
fessional baseball, although it is not
something he lets occupy his mind
too oflen.
"I think about it,"he said. "But I
always think of something A.J.
[HinchJ told me. He said, 'You can't
get drafted on one game, you can't
get drafted in a day.' I know it's not
what you do now, you just need to go

out and play. If you're good enough,
you'll get drafted. There's nothing
you can do other than play well.
"If I'm thinking, 'What do the
scouts want to see?,' then I won't
play good ball," Kilburg continued.
"I need to take the game for what it
is and help the team reach the team
goals we have this year."
Individual honors and the even
tual possibility of a professional ca
reer are at the back of Kilburg's
mind for now. What would make the
year successful for the Stanford star
is a return trip to the College World
Series in Omaha, Neb., where his
long-time dream came true last sea
son.
"Playing in the College World Se
ries was great," Kilburg said. "It was
pure excitement and adrenaline. It's
hard not to get caught up in the ex
perience, playing in front of 20,000
people — it was definitely a dream
come true."
While the experience will last Kil
burg a lifetime, he and his Cardinal
teammates know there is a happier
ending.
"It was great last year, but it can
be better," Kilburg said. "Hopefully,
we can go back this year and come
home with a national championship
— this year we'd like to win it."
