# STS program not doomed yet
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The fate of Stanford's Program in
Science, Technology and Society is not
yet decided, University President Ger
hard Casper said yesterday.
"While I would not now commit my
self to the perpetuation of r. mcyor ... it
is my understanding that the issue is

generally an open issue right now,"
Casper told a group of about 100 at his
"Tea and More Cookies" town hall
meeting.
Earlier yesterday, in response to
student outcry about the proposed dis
continuation of the STS major, the Fac
ulty Senate's Committee on Under
graduate Studies postponed its final de
cision on the program's future until its

next meeting at the end of May.
The handful of STS majors gathered
at the meeting with Casper were happy
to hear his affirmation.
"It's very encouraging," junior
Michael Putnam said. "We're halfway
there."
Casper told students yesterday he
was not involved with the decision
to alter the program. Students
were informed in a letter last week
that STS administrators would
not seek to renew degree-granting
authority, which all interdiscipli
nary programs are required to do
regularly.
Faculty and administrators in
volved with the decision have cited
a growing student interest, cou
pled with a lack of serious commit
ment from senior tenure-line fac
ulty to teach in STS, as the prima
ry reason to stop awarding degrees
as of 1998. Program administra
tors plan to continue to offer an
honors program in STS and to add
an undergraduate minor.
Casper explained that some of
the obstacles that mny prevent the
STS program from continuing in
its present form are due to the
structure of universities.
"While all universities are com
mitted to interdisciplinary pro
grams .. . the fact of the matter is
all universities remain fiercely dis
ciplinary," he said. "The first pri
orities are to serve the core sub
jects in the school."
"It's not a particular weakness
of Stanford," Casper added. "Stan
ford is actually more favorable to
ward interdisciplinary programs

than many universities I know."
Materials Science and Engi
neering Prof. John Bravman, se
nior associate dean for student af
fairs in the School of Engineering,
yesterday approached the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies
for permission to continue STS's
degree-granting authority one
year past its current allowance —
enabling students now declared in
the major to complete their de
grees. The extension was ap
proved.
The committee's planned vote
on the final fate of the degree
granting capacity of the STS pro
gram was postponed until the
committee's next meeting, in
order to give students time to find
other possible solutions, said
Alane Murdock, one of the com
mittee's three student members.
Casper's announcement and
the committee's decision are a
welcome relief to students who are
busily looking for a way to save
their major.
"This gives us a window to ad
dress the problems that led to the
situation in the first place," Put
nam said.
Both Casper and the committee
were presented with petitions in
favor of the STS program, signed
by 1,700 students. Putnam said
students hoped to have 2,000 sig
natures by today, which will allow
the issue to be put to the student
body in a special ASSU election.
