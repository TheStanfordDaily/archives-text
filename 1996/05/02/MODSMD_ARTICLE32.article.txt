# Biologist searches for order in ant world
## Focus on Science

For Asst. Biology Prof. Deborah Gordon, the
absence of a defined structure in a society such
as that portrayed in "Apocalypse Now" does not
elicit panic. Instead, it raises questions about
why certain societies without these structures
can still function efficiently.
The answer to that question may reside in
the behavior displayed in an ant colony, accord
ing to a new study done by Gordon.
Gordon became interested in the behavior of
ants while pursuing her graduate degree at
Duke University. "When I was a graduate stu
dent I became interested in systems where you
have to think about all levels of organization,"
Gordon said. The emblem of such a system, an
ant colony, presents the researcher with a
daunting task â€” to examine the role of an indi
vidual ant and the overall structure of a colony
simultaneously, she said.
In her lab, Gordon runs experiments focused
on understanding ant colonies. In one experi
ment she studies the tasks that each individual
ant undertakes by looking at the interactions
between ants. Another experiment is geared to
ward understanding the invasion of the Argen
tine ant species. Gordon is trying to assess how
the Argentine ant species has managed to wipe
out other ant species during their invasions.
"They (Argentine ants) are about halfway
through Jasper Ridge. We are trying to figure
out what do they do to wipe out other ant
species. Is it a factor of aggression or better for
aging skills?" Gordon asked.
Since Gordon has devoted much of her re-

search to insects that others find a nuisance,
one may wonder if a bond between a researcher
and social insects can develop? Answering that
question, Gordon refers to the differences that
originate from studying social primates and so
cial insects. "Ants are different from monkeys
in the sense that a person is not part of an ant's
perceptual sphere," said Gordon.
"The alien thing about ants is that they
never get discouraged. Something can happen
to an ant colony but you never see them stop
ping and saying, 'I can't take it anymore.' "
Understanding the ecological functioning of
ant colonies takes Gordon away from Stanford
during the summer to conduct research in
southeastern Arizona. Focusing her attention
on the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus,
Gordon is working to understand the dynamics
of colony behavior.
Harvester ant colonies are comprised of a
queen ant and her sterile female daughters. One
dose of sperm from a male ant will allow the fe
male queen to produce ants for 15 years. Male
ants are only generated when the need to start a
new colony develops. After interacting with a
virgin queen, male ants perish.
Many researchers, including Gordon, liken
the functioning of an ant colony to the workings
of the brain. "A brain does not have a hierarchi
cal organizational structure. A brain is made up
with neurons that do simple things but the pat
tern of connection allows them to do complex
things," said Gordon.
"The pattern of connection of ants, even
though they are not connected by axons and
dendrites, allows them to do complex things,"
she said.
Stemming from this fact is a series of dilem
mas: How is it that an organization composed of
inept individual ants can function efficiently as

a whole? More importantly, what are the simple
rules or connecting patterns that produce be
havior in an ant colony?
In a colony composed of harvester ants, a
worker can execute four tasks outside of the
nest, some of which include foraging, patrolling
and nest maintenance. However, missing from
the colony is a boss ant that dictates what the
other ants should do. So, how do the right num
ber of ants get to the right task at the right time?
From previous research, it is known that the
number of ants doing a certain task depends on
how many ants are doing another job. Each indi
vidual ant has the ability to switch from tasks eas
ily. Gordon said she believes task allocation may
originate from the interaction rates between ants.
"If the numbers change, the rate of interac
tion may change. Maybe an ant is bumping into
another ant more often in a certain time period.
How often does it expect to bump into another
ant may signal a change," Gordon asked.
In an American Scientist article, Gordon
wrote: "If an event takes place in the environ
ment that causes a change in the numbers en
gaged in some task then other workers may ex
perience a change in the rate of encounters with
workers performing task."
An ant does not need to know about the func
tioning of the whole colony to engage in a task,
she said. Therefore, the distribution of tasks
does not stem from an ant's understanding of
the big colony picture.
Generalizing the issues present in an ant
colony, biologists like Gordon, are working to
understand the phenomena of how individual
units with simple localized information can gen
erate the global behavior displayed by the whole
system. To comprehend this may shed light on
the functioning of non-human societies once
deemed alien and pesky.
