# Teaming Up
## with Fredro Starr and Talent Harris from "Sunset Park" 
### Athima Chansanchai 
M horty Doo-Wop" and "Butter"
arc grumpy young men in the
il middle of a public relations or
deal: the publicity tour. Today that means
being interviewed in the hospitality suite
Tristar Pictures has decked out for them at
San Francisco's posh Ritz-Carlton. Street
meets starch-collared swank in this tastefully
decorated room, with its oak dining table,
striped upholstered chair and silver urns of
coffee contrasted with a prominent rap star
and a rising comedian seated at the table. Af
ternoon interviews are always a bit difficult,
especially if you've been up since 5:30 a.m,
like these guys have. But they're professionals
and we roll right along.
You know them as Fredro Starr, frontman
for the rap group Onyx ("Slam"), and Talent
Harris, better known on the comedy circuit
but fast emerging as an acting talent, to suit
his name.
Becoming a team on the screen as well as
off, Starr and 1 larris — leading actors in the
recently released "Sunset Park" — found it
easy to work with Rhea Periman (the acerbic
barmaid from "Cheers"). Periman plays the
film's inexperienced white female coach who
joins the team for wh.it she thinks is an easy,
bigger paycheck.
"She wasn't that tough (to work with), hut
she was curious. Real curious," Starr says of
Periman. "She's real cool, she looked at us like
real people."
Her character, Phyllis or "Phil," soon finds
out that it's not going to be as easy as she

thinks. She has to lose their respect before she
can show them what winning is about. They
go from being low self esteem losers to win
ners willing to stand up for one another.
There's something suspiciously like "Dan
gerous Minds" about this set-up. Great white
hype saves the day again? Both films send two
white women into underprivileged neigh
borhoods; the women show the kids how to
believe in themselves, are made to feel guilty
when they wanted to leave so they choose to
stay and everything ends on a positive note
for the kids and for her. Starr and Harris
strongly disagree with my comparison of the
two films, and explain why.
" 'Dangerous Minds' was very far from re
ality," Harris says, shaking his head, "If those
kids were so disrespectful to their teacher,
why they even in school? 'Sunset Park' is its
own category. We ain't over the top, like
'Dangerous Minds' was."
This team might have had some problems,
hut they weren't the hopeless cases "Danger
ous Minds" threw out.
Starr and I larris both speak with a certain
restlessness that goes against the relaxed
slickness of Hollywood. They are, after all,
from the 'hood, and they carry around where
they come from like a shelter during an im
pending storm. Starr finds comfort in his
music, where he can release the stress he and
other young black men feel on street.
Starr's previous acting credits include a
brief role in Abel Ferrara's "The Addiction."
He was the man on the street chosen by I.ilv
Taylor's vicious vampiress as a meal for the
evening. Starr recreates that moment before

my eyes, writhing in mock pain, contorting
his body and filling the room with his
screams. He can't do much more without
convulsing into laughter.
"It was right in the Village, right outside,"
Starr says, "People were walking by going,
'What kind of movie is this?'" He keeps
laughing before settling back into his chair.
In "Sunset Park" Starr is called "Shorty"
for a reason, but his compact size emanates
energy and a willingness to be candid. He gets
up periodically, impatient, hungry and tired.
Harris sits across from me, head down most
of the time, doodling on white sheets of
paper. 1 le's a bigger man who played center in
the film, occasionally missing easy shots, dis
tracted by the "honeys" in the audience. De
spite his general reticence, Harris comes to
life when he reacts to his co-star. He likes that
the film casts him as a ladies man, something
Starr starts joking about.
"He was having mad skins all the time, day
and night," Starr says, pointing at him and
laughing. Harris grins a little sheepishly while
doodling on a white sheet of paper. Harris
shows off his masterpiece. It says, "Sunset
Park #33, Gotta Represent," in big block let
ters. This is the team slogan, and a song off the
soundtrack done by Starr and Onyx.
"Butter" received much of his style from
Harris' material. "It was their name, but I
thought of all the phrasing, the slang, 'It's like
butter, baby,' you know, all that 'Sunset Park
Represent' stuff."
"We rewrote a lot of stuff, because you
know, the slang was kind of outdated." Starr
spews off some of the antiquated language in

disbelief. "Fresh, dope, etc.," shaking his head
and leaning back in his chair.
"Me and [Harris], we were the only kids
from New York, everyone else was from L.A.,
says Starr. Basically, they had to change it or
they would not be able to hold their heads up
in their hometown anymore.
"You wouldn't say dog, you'd say 'son' or
something like that, that's how New York
talks," Starr says.
Harris was a comedian on the set as well as
off, taking off his pants at one point to get th<
rest of the cast to laugh during a take, which
they did.
Starr, the talker, is more familiar with th<
press than his co-star. That doesn't mean
Harris, or "Butter," as Starr keeps calling him,
is a wallflower. He's got smooth lines — you
never know if he's yanking you around or
whether he's for real. Until you see that smile
light up and he knows he's got you.
Street-smart, they never let down their
guard all the way, but brief glimpses into their
non-Hollywood souls reveal hearts lull ol
hope for something better than what the\
started out with. The film sends out a positive
message to black men that they can get out
from under, that the 'hood can be more than
the popular media images of dead-end traps.
Harris thinks young people place too
much pressure on athletes and entertainers
to be role models. Both he and Starr look to
their family and their close friends as their
role models, and think kids should look to
more variety, but admit that the pressure to
own the material things in life is always there.
They admit thev felt the same way.

something like that, that's how New York
talks," Starr says.
Harris was a comedian on the set as well as
off, taking off his pants at one point to get th<
rest of the cast to laugh during a take, which
they did.
Starr, the talker, is more familiar with th<
press than his co-star. That doesn't mean
Harris, or "Butter," as Starr keeps calling him,
is a wallflower. He's got smooth lines — you
never know if he's yanking you around or
whether he's for real. Until you see that smile
light up and he knows he's got you.
Street-smart, they never let down their
guard all the way, but brief glimpses into their
non-Hollywood souls reveal hearts lull ol
hope for something better than what the\
started out with. The film sends out a positive
message to black men that they can get out
from under, that the 'hood can be more than
the popular media images of dead-end traps.
Harris thinks young people place too
much pressure on athletes and entertainers
to be role models. Both he and Starr look to
their family and their close friends as their
role models, and think kids should look to
more variety, but admit that the pressure to
own the material things in life is always there.
They admit thev felt the same way.
