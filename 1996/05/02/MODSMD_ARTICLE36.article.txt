# "The Workman's Wife"
## more than just another senior project 
### Jen Graves 
I he moan of an ostracized gypsy
woman remains on-stage long after
she departs: "This song is so tiny, just
y as me... you sing it too."
The gypsy (masterfully played by fresh
man Colleen McGarry) and her song open
Elina Compton's version of Minna Canth's
"The Workman's Wife," an interpretation of
the original that weaves in and out of
modernity.
Written and set in 1884, the show deals
with the interplay of males and females who
operate within the tight corset of societal
structure. "The Workman's Wife" also ex
poses the immense sexism and classism of
late 19th-century Finland. The small num
ber of well-educated women at this time
comprised the tiny and impassioned begin
nings of a feminist movement which has
grown much the same way in Finland as in
the United States. Minna Canth was one of
these women, and she writes in her letters
that she "lashed out boldly" against an un
fair legal system that decreed all property
under male ownership and "preposterous
religious notions" that demanded ultimate
obedience of wife to husband.
With some alterations from the original
translation from Finnish, director Elina
Compton presents Canth's work as her se
nior project for the drama major. Originally
from Finland herself, Compton shares the
values of the well-educated and progressive
ly-minded author. Her fable summary of the
story begins as follows: "Once upon a time
in Finland there lived a sweet young woman
named Johanna." Things begin to unravel
from there.
Compton directs her actors in rehearsal:
"In this scene, when the men talk, the
women freeze. When the women talk, the
men freeze." The visual contrast she creates
is an example of her utilization of the medi

um. The division between sexes is evident,
but of course, they are still on the same stage,
trying to figure out how to share the same
space.
Compton's adaptation is formally inter
esting as she incorporates what she calls a
"Brechtian way of making social commen
tary" with the use of slides. The production
— which takes place in the black-box format
of Eleanor Prosser Studio — becomes multi
dimensional as text and picture slides cover
the back wall and morph with the move
ment of the story. Each scene is accompa
nied by two picture slides: first, a modern
one (a modern wedding, for example) and
second, one from the period (a late 19th
century Finnish wedding). The viewer's
thoughts arc transported in and out of
Canth's time, and the lineage of discrimina
tion passed down through the years is com-

Furthermore, Compton achieves a
feeling of intimacy: one can sense
that the production is peppered
with remnants of the director's own
personal history as a Finn and as a
woman.

pressed into a visual sequence.
Furthermore, Compton achieves a feeling
of intimacy: one can sense that the produc
tion is peppered with remnants of the direc
tor's own personal history as a Finn and as a
woman. The border for the text slides, in
both English and Finnish, is a crocheted
fringe border that her own grandmother
made, while inside these lines are lines from
Canth's letters. The visual metaphor is
made: white words of expression and free
dom by the author are projected within the
white of her grandmother's crocheted cre
ation, against the darkness of the wall.
The action in the play begins when Jo
hanna marries the self-centered Risto, who
has dumped Homsantuu (the gypsy) in
order to be with Johanna, who is much more
affluent. Under the law, all assets of a woman
are lost to her husband when she marries,

and thus is Risto's ecstasy.
Risto's friend, Toppo, remarks at the wed
ding, "The man is to the wife as the cat is to
the mouse; it's too late for the mouse to com
plain when she's in the jaws of the cat." Risto
repeats this, delighted at the analogy, and the
repercussions of this horrific and true state
ment are yet to come.
Homsantuu visits the wedding and re
veals to everyone that Risto had proposed to
her and betrayed her, leaving her because of
her race and her poverty. The people are, of
course, in disbelief, and one of the women
speaks plainly: "You can't make a decent per
son from a gypsy." The world in which these
characters reside measures decency in
strange ways, as the rest of the play demon
strates.
Throughout the show the mad eyes of
Homsantuu dart and stare at the other ac
tors as well as at the audience. She is power
ful, she is fascinating, she is Other. Yet, she is
so close to us as an audience, and in this in
timate space we are, as they say, breathing
the same air as all of these characters.
This show brings numerous relevant
questions to the fore. What would we do in
other shoes? Canth's final statement appears
in English and in Finnish on the wall as the
end of the play arrives:
"I would valiantly fight for the oppressed
to the end."
