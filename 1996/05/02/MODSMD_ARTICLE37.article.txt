## Horde Festival CD-ROM full of fluff 
### Travis Vigil 
The newest fad in
CD-ROMs seems to
be the interactive,
rock-and-roll festi
val. Along the same
lines as MTV's
"Unplugged" CD
ROM, Phillips En
tertainment brings
us the"The Horde
Festival CD-ROM."
It is marketed as a

product for those who appreciate "straight
ahead rock-n-roll," and highlights such artists
as Blues Traveler, Ziggy Marley and the
Melody Makers, Sheryl Crow and the Dave
Matthews Band.
"The Horde Festival CD-ROM" walks the
fine line between making you feel like you are
actually at the festival and making you feel as

though you are in a computer-generated fairy
tale. Unfortunately, it can't seem to make up
its mind on which one it should be and there
fore the user is left with a strange surreal feel
ing: things in this environment are exactly
what they seem to be; but not really.
We enter this world as the roar of a heli
copter (no doubt bringing some of the per
formers to the show) pulses overhead. As this
sound dies out, Karen Duffy (or "Duff" for
those of you who knew her when she was an
MTV VJ) introduces us to our mystical little
adventures ("live" from the dressing rooms),
telling us all of the places we can visit at the
Horde Tour. These include the Lawn, the
West Concourse, the East Concourse and the
Psychedelic Forest. She closes her introduc
tion by taking a pseudo-political stance on
the festival: she says, "open your mind, pro
tect your planet, but most of all have fun."
With that, we are on our way. The graphics
on this thing are really quite amazing. We are

able to explore the different sections with
quite a bit of detail (although I couldn't get in
side the portable toilets). The West Con
course is full of all the liberal propaganda that
has made Lollapalooza (in)famous. We can
visit the anti-censorship booth or better yet
browse through the educational material at
the marijuana legalization booth. All in all,
these booths are what we've come to expect
and dread from these large festivals.
One nice user interface feature are the
"Kiosks." If you ever get lost, all you have to do
is go to one of these bulletin boards that are
scattered around the grounds and a sign tells
which way to go to get to different activities.
However, these kiosks are more or less unnec
essary because it is fairly easy and intuitive to
maneuver around this environment. If you
sec something that interests you, click on it
and you're there.
We are also allowed to "listen in" on press
interviews with the different artists. I lowever,

these seem to be little more than clippings
from previous interviews, filled with all the
vague, over-bloated babble that goes along
with such an overblown production as the
Horde Festival. We can also watch the bands
"play" but, once again, this seems to be scat
tered clippings of previous performances.
The CD-ROM also boasts "unreleased
audio tracks" from all of the highlighted
artists. However, these tend to be either bad
live versions or really bad b-sides that Phillips
Entertainment somehow managed to
scrounge up. More than anything, these
"bonus" tracks function as filler to a product
already full of filler.
While the graphics on this CD-ROM are
entertaining and fun for a while, it seems to
me that this is the sort of thing you would
only look at once. My advice to people who
are even remotely interested in this product is
to pay the 30 bucks for a Horde ticket: you'll
Ret a lot more music and a lot less fluff.
