# The 						Raincoats
## emerging from shadows Story and Graphics by Mike Noren

Ii n 1993, nearly a decade after there-
lease of their last album, Britain's
Raincoats played a reunion gig to cele-
V 1 brate the re-release of their three
K then-long-out-of-print records. The
show was supposed to be a casual, one-time
thing â€” much more of a party than a concert.
But that all changed when Nirvana, longtime
Raincoats fans and perhaps the most popular
band in the world at the time, heard about the
reunion and asked the group to tour with
them.
Raincoats singer / guitarist Ana da Silva re
fills: "Nirvana asked us to do that, and we kind
of thought, 'Oh that could be such good fun.'
And when we got together again to rehearse, it
felt really good to play again.' That tour with
Nirvana never actually happened, but the offer
go! the Raincoats in motion again. They re
leased a four-song HP in 1994, and their new
full-length album, "Looking in the Shadows,"
is due in early summer on Geffen Records.
The Raincoats'early material is some of the
most unique and inspired work from the late*
70s Britisli underground, music that, though
underappreciated .it the time, has recently
been acknowledged as a huge influence on
groups such as Sonic Youth, Nirvana, Bikini
Kill, I lole and more. A few years back, in fact,
Kurt Cobain went so far as to find the antique
shop where da Silva was working to track down
.i copy of the Raincoat's hard-to-find first
album.
The fact that so many artists and fans were
still affected by the Raincoats' music inspired
the group to continue. "That really gave us a
belief to just go and do something," da Silva
says, "to just be crazies and do whatever we felt
like doing."
It's this enthusiasm that keeps the new re
union album from sounding like a reunion
album. Never mind that the band hadn't
played tor 11 years, "Looking in the Shadows"
sounds fresh. While the Sex Pistols 112 reely admit
that they're back together for the money, the
Raincoats are back because they still have
something to say.
Ak. he Raincoats formed in London in
1977, when da Silva, a native of Portu
gal, met (Jina Birch, a Nottingham na
tive, at an art college. The two took in
terest in the punk bands they'd see in
clubs, and they ultimately decided to try it
themselves.
"We were all very inspired by people like the
Slits and the Clash. Everybody was saying how
easy it was and how you had to know about
three chords and you can be in a band," da Silva
recalls. "I didn't know that much, but I knew
more than three chords, so I thought, 'Well, if
all you need is three chords, and I know five, 1
think I'm an expert.' We just felt very coura
geous about everything at that point."
After deciding to form the band, da Silva
practiced her guitar and Birch began to learn
the bass, and things progressed naturally from
there. Da Silva excitedly recalls "Life on the
Line," the first song the group made together:
"When we played the whole thing, it was just
the fact that there was a song there, that I had
all my lite listened to other people's songs and

suddenly there was something that I had done
that went from beginning to end and had a
middle and all that,' she says."It was just total
magic for me to do that. I remember the feeling
of it, the feeling of having done something that
I liked so much when other people did, and
there was I contributing to something like
that."
Following a rocky but exciting start and a

number of line-up changes, the group finally
settled with violinist Vicky Aspinall and drum
mer Palmolive of the Slits. The newly assem
bled Raincoats wrote a bunch of songs, toured
England, and went to the studio to record their
self-titled debut, originally released on Eng
land's Rough Trade label. Full with smart
melodies, raw energy, restless experimentation
and thick accents, "The Raincoats" document-

ed a brilliant band discovering exactly what
they could do, and the band members them
selves seemed as surprised as anybody.
"Somehow at that time, we felt that we
moved together," da Silva says."The speed
changes, it just felt right. We didn't even realize
all the time that we were changing speeds; we
just did them all together.
"It was just the right people together, the

moment was the right moment, everything
kind of just went in the way to make it an album
that I personally like, she says. "Things are so
much kind of product of the moment. You
know, one day you're there and you just think,
'Oh well, why don't we try this?' And maybe if
you did it another day, that wouldn't occur to
you and something else would have occurred
to you."

From the fiery "Fairytale in the Supermar
ket" single to the anti-rape anthem of "Off
Duty Trip" to the dirty intensity of "In Love,"
the Raincoats created some of the most moving
songs in memory, tracks that both embraced
and exploded the punk-rock ideals that in
spired them.
"I suppose what we took wasn't so much the
style but the spirit of it," she says, describing the
group's unique take on punk. "We just took the
spirit of it, which is, you know, be cheeky. And
that's what we took and we just listened to our
selves, to our own needs and things.
"I mean, at that point, having a violin wasn't
a very punky thing to do, but when we used it,
it sounded very raw and very there in a way that
moved. To us, it seemed like it was all in the
spirit."
By the time the Raincoats made their sec
ond album, "Odyshape," their defiantly indi
vidual spirit seemed to be the only punky
thing left. Palmolive left the group, leaving the
drumming to a revolving team of drummers,
and the remaining members were exploring
softer textures and sounds. "We didn't have a
drummer when we were writing for the sec
ond album, and we were doing it in a living
room, so it's a much quieter affair," da Silva
says.
Still, "Odyshape" features several of the
group's best tracks: "Shouting Out Loud"

and "Dancing in My Head" arc the
most elegant songs the band has
done, and other tracks tackle issues of
motherhood and women's body
image with a thoughtfulness you
wouldn't expect from something so
soothing.
by 1984, the band members' experi
mentation with different instruments
and styles led to tensions within the
group, and their third album, "Mov
ing," is a confused listen. From gawky
funk to beautiful folk, the record
moves through genre after genre with
a cleaner-than-ever sound. Da Silva
says she doesn't like the record much,
but there are more than a couple
gems, particularly Birch's "No One's
Little Girl" and da Silva's "Mouth of a
Story."
"At that point we were nearly splitting
up, and a lot of it was going in a direc
tion that 1 didn't really like," da Silva
says. "I'm the kind of person that grew
up with sort of Anglo-American music
in the more rock-and-roll, rock-type
thing. So I'm more in that vein than,
say, jazz or reggae or anything like that.
And so that album was a mixture of
things that wasn't really close to my
heart.
"I think part of the band was trying to
clean up the act and wanting to go in a
more polished direction, which I didn't
really like. And so we weren't doing
what I wanted and we weren't really
doing what other people wanted either.
... So that's a usual reason why people
split up. We wanted to go in different
directions, really."
After the Raincoats' 1984 break-up,

da Silva continued to play music, but she soon
lost interest in what she saw as an unexciting
music scene and devoted much of her time to
her job at the antique shop.
"I got quite disappointed about everything
at that point, and I really didn't stay in touch
that much," she says. " The only thing I was in
terested in was the Jesus and Mary Chain."
This continued through the early '90s. At the
time of Kurt Cobain's visit to the antique
shop, da Silva was completely unfamiliar with
Nirvana. "I saw the posters for 'Nevermind'
with that baby holding the dollar bill, and I re
ally thought that that was great, that image.
But I didn't have a clue what they were like or
anything, and I only found out alter he came
to the shop."
When she finally heard Nirvana, she liked
them, and it was partly due to Cobain's v isit
that da Silva became interested in modern rock
music again. "F knew about I lole as well be
cause Courtney [Jxwe| also came with him,"
she continues. "From then, I started knowing
other things, and then I started going and see
ing people like Bikini Kill, and I got to meet
them and they were fans as well.
"1 just started to know a lot about what was
happening again, and feeling enthusiastic that
something was happening and people were still
challenging things and wanting to do things
that were fresh and uncompromised."

o many peoples surprise, the Rain
coats remain fresh and uncompro
mised on the new record. Undoubt
edly influenced by the bands that
they had influenced before, the

Raincoats arc now exploring pop music in a
more accessible and straightforward form, yet
their clattery vision remains unmistakably
theirs. Backed by violinist Anne Wood and
drummer Heather Dunn, da Silva's songs
("Only Tonight," "Truth Is Hard," "You Ask
Why") sound more like traditional Raincoats
numbers, while much of Birch s stuff ("Don't Be
Mean," "Babydog," " Pretty") shows a new knack
for inventive bubble gum. "Looking in the Shad
ows" was recorded with Suede and Pulp pro
ducer Ed Buller, and its overall sound is
smoother than any of the band's previous work.
"We had a bit more money, so we spent a bit
more time in the studio," da Silva says. "I sup
pose it sounds more polished in that way, but at
the same time, as far as I'm concerned, I think
there is quite a lot of edge to it, which I really
like. So I suppose it's got the edge of the first
record, but is better played, so to speak."
The group recently made a video for the
album's first single "Don't Be Mean," and they
plan to tour the States in the fall. Until then, da
Silva expects to remain busy with Raincoats
related stuff: "We just seem to have so many
meetings," she says. "I still work one day a
week, but I had to give up the job at the shop it
self, for a while at least."
While da Silva thoroughly enjoys her work
with the Raincoats, she is hesitant to comment
on the band's future: "With this, it's merely a
day at a time. I just don't want to make huge
plans. We've got a two-album deal with Geffen,
so we'll probably do two, and then we'll see,"
she savs. "It's hard work at times."
