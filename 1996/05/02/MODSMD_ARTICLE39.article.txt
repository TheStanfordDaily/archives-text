MTV-appropriated acoustic music seems
tn carry around some kind of inferiority
complex. An "Unplugged" album justifies its
existence through over-compensation: often
strings, or added rhythm, ambiance, some
thing. Even the word "unplugged" connotes
insufficiency, a lack, .111 impotent deficit of
electricity. Music put through the "Un
plugged" machine tends to come out more
palatable, .1 de-loused version of its dirtier
sibling. Both ) Mascis "Martin and Me" and
Nick Thompson's "Red Weather" are fiercely
acoustic albums that never sound "Un
plugged.' both emphatically stake their own
ground without conceding dirtiness; both
have some lice of their own.
Mascis' "Martin and Me" features 14
tracks from his acoustic solo tour of last year.
With only one guitar behind him, Mascis'
lyrics have never sounded so desperately
naked. Mascis is one ot the only musicians
around who can make tortured sentiment
sound authentic. Lines like "if you're shaking
it won't show / hold out for me, 'cause bail
ing at this point is really low" tap genuine
feeling with .1 strange, lazy precision.
The playing is loose, often sloppy, but
never crude. While on "Thumb" Mascis
seems to strike the strings with his eyes
closed, he never loses the thread. That sonu,

like "Drawer
ings," succeeds
with a kind of
oblique artistry:
his is raw, inatten
tive skill, uncon
cerned with that
MTV-driven
cliche of acoustic
tunefulness. A
Smiths cover,
"The boy With a
Thorn in his
Side," is a wel
come addition, as
is the gentle Carly
Simon song, "An
ticipation." "So
What Else is New"
is the album's
highlight, a
pounding, un
co 111 pro 111 i si 11 g
three minutes
which single
handedly answers
Mascis' hallmark

question "Am I acting on something real / or
am I hlowin' it again?"
Stanford student Nick Thompson's "Red
Weather" is a horse of a different color with
its emphasis not on sincerity but virtuosity.
Recorded .it Stanford in January, the album's
expertly played 13 tracks of six-and 12-string
acoustic instrumental alternate between
stirring energy and innocuous atmospherics.
Of the latter there are only a few. "Mango
Serenade" and "Barnacles" both sound like
the lethargic undercurrent of music you hear
at hippie crystal shops. When Thompson
abandons this New Age aura, his album be
comes uncompromising, occasionally chaot
ic and never well-mannered. The opener,
"Disillusionment," converts simmering

melodies into heated, brash hysterics.
Thompson pounds his guitar, launching vol
leys of arpeggios and chords in bracing, syn
copated rhythms. Thompson seems aware of
how closely his album approximates those
annoying "Sounds of Nature" recordings,
and so his occasional bouts of acoustic vio
lence come at mostly the right moments. As
appropriate as it might seem, you shouldn't
try sleeping to this album; Thompson's best
songs, "The Lump" and "Once a Runner,"
will only wake you up.
