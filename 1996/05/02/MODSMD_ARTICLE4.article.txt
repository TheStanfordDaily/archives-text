## While women, Asian faculty rise, other gains are flat 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
The percentage of female and
Asian faculty at Stanford has in
creased significantly over the last 10
years, while the percentage of blacks,
Native Americans and Hispanics has
remained fairly stable or even de
creased, according to a report to be
presented at today's Faculty Senate
meeting.

The annual report on professorial gains and losses
says that as of Sept. 1, 1995, 259 of the current 1,459
faculty members were women, or 17.75 percent. The
percentage of women in 1985 was 9.88 percent.
The percentage of Asian faculty went from 3.4 per
cent in 1985 to 8.22 percent in 1995.
Blacks and Hispanics enjoyed smaller gains, with
the percentage of black faculty jumping from 1.7 per
cent to 2.67 percent and Hispanics increasing from
1.47 percent to 2.47 percent. The percentage of Native

Americans actually decreased,
from .15 percent to .14 percent.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, vice
provost for faculty recruitment and
development, said he does not view
the statistics as particularly sur
prising.
On the contrary, said Weisberg,
the results are "mundane and pre
dictable."
"No one year's statistics could
really be shocking because no one
year's mean that much — either
they follow the trend or, if they
don't, it's probably a blip," said
Weisberg, who will present the re
port to the senate.
Weisberg said he thought the
increase in the percentage of
women appointees was "signifi
cant." He said the small increase in
the number of black faculty was
part of "a loss of momentum
around the country" in hiring
black professors.
It is an ongoing challenge to hire
non-Asian minorities, but "I think
Stanford is trying hard," Weisberg
said. "It, like other schools, wishes
there were more progress on some

fronts, and it's working with the
known tools."
Of all the schools, the School of
Medicine boasted the greatest in
creases in terms of numbers for
total faculty as well as for women,
Asian, black and Hispanic faculty.
Geological and Environmental
Sciences Prof. Gail Mahood, chair
of the senate, said she thought the
increase in the percentage of
women was "a real 'good news' sta
tistic." But, she said, faculty contin
ue to be concerned about the rela
tive scarcity of other minorities.
"The question is, how do you fix
it," Mahood said. "In my own view,
trying to rob Harvard of its few mi
nority faculty" is not something
that would "make the whole system
better," she said.
The problem in hiring a diverse
and talented faculty, Mahood ex
plained, is that there is not an ade
quate pool of minorities with doc
torates.
"Until we change that, [it will
be] awfully hard to move those sta
tistics veiy much," Mahood said.
The senate will also discuss a
draft resolution from the Planning
and Policy Board concerning Stan
ford's doctoral programs. Accord
ing to Biological Sciences Prof. Pa
tricia Jones, co-chair of the board,

the recommendations are reason
able and should not be difficult to
implement, assuming there is a fac
ulty consensus.
The senate may charge the Com
mittee on Graduate Studies to con
sider three recommendations. The
first ensures that Stanford will not
reduce the number of graduate stu
dents by means of a broad, over
sweeping University policy.
"It should be up to the individual
departments" to decide how many
students to admit, Jones said.
The second recommendation
suggests that resources be available
for doctoral students to train in
areas outside their specialties. In
the words of the resolution, the aim
of this is to "allow students to gain a
wider variety of academic and other
career skills."
Finally, the board recommends
that individual departments pro
vide their students with informa
tion about completion and employ
ment rates. Jones said this would
help students obtain "a more realis
tic view of where graduate study
might take them." Not all depart
ments currently compile this infor
mation, Jones said.
Mahood said the faculty will
most likely vote on these recom
mendations at today's meeting.
