Death II Dance

It's pretty much common knowledge
these days that punk rock — at least as we
think of it today — was horn in Britain.
Thanks to movies like "Sid and Nancy," just
about anybody can talk at length about John
ny Rotten's "fuck the world" attitude, Sid Vi
cious' destructive nihilism and the snotty,
green-haired, safety-pinned movement that
the Sex Pistols unleashed on the world.
Unfortunately, most people's knowledge
of British punk doesn't go any farther. It's a
shame, because the U.K. has spawned an
enormous number of bands, quite a few with
a lot more talent and vision than Rotten, Vi
cious and crew. Now that the Pistols —
minus Sid or any new material, hut a few mil
lion dollars richer — have reunited for a
worldwide reunion tour, it seems appropri
ate to focus the spotlight on a pair of British
bands who, although they have never ap
proached the same kind of success, probably
deserve it a lot more.
Northern Ireland's Stiff Little Fingers
began life u.s a punk cover band in 1977, but
quickly became known for tuneful, political
songs that condemned racism, classism,

Britain's Ulster policy and the other social in
justices they saw in British society. Their dis
tinctive, anthemic style made major waves in
the punk world, and continues to heavily in
fluence the sounds of current punk darlings
like Bad Religion, Green Day and Rancid.
Unfortunately, "Get A Life," SLF's fifth
album, turns away from this influential
sound and towards a generic, radio-friendly
style reminiscent of U2 or the Levellers. The
band is just as concerned about social issues
as ever, and "Get A Life" is chock-full of an
thems for the working man and calls for
world brotherhood and racial equality. But it
ain't punk rock, and the middle-of-the-road,
folk-rock delivery soon lost my interest.
English skinhead workhorses, the Busi
ness, have been around since 1979, but have
found success without moving towards a
more palatable sound. Although oi music has
been tainted in the U.S. by its association
with white power, British oi, with its fixations
on drinking, fighting, soccer and the
"workin' man," seems to occupy the same
thematic territory that country music does in
the States.
"Death II Dance" is vintage oi: the title
track proclaims all-out war on techno —
"now is the time / send rave to the grave" —
while other tracks attack the British hospital
system and advocate drinking and driving.
It's the same melodic sing-a-long-punk style
that the Business have been churning out
since their inception, and it still seems as ex
citing, fresh and fun as it did then. Go ahead
and spend $21 this summer to watch 40-
year-old millionaires sing "No Future" — I'll
be drinking Guinness with the skinheads
down at the Business show.
