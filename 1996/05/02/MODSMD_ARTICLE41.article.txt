They spent their wild
youthful days • • •

The first Swirlies album, 1993's "Blonder
tongue Audiobaton," is an oft-overlooked,
forgotten favorite of the indie-rock canon. Its
dense layers of drifting, blistering noise-pop
translate the wistful power of My Bloody
Valentine into the idiom of the American un-

derground, making sloppy and crunchy
MBV's intricate guitar drama.
Yet unlike MBV, the Swirlies have gratified
their fans at last with a new record. Despite
the departure of half of the band, lead Swirlie
Damon Tutunjian and new collaborator
Christina Files maintain a familiar feel on
"They spent their wild youthful days in the
glittering world of the salons" while injecting
it with fresh ideas. The new album picks up
where "Blondertongue" left off, offering a
new batch of wide-open soundscapes.
From the clunky guitar dazzle, the herky
jerky flow and the wispy boy-girl vocals, the
key elements are present at the surface, only
in a more polished form. "Two Cirls Kissing"
brims with the guitar overdrive that the Cam
bridge, Mass., band specializes in, the ripples
of sound rising and falling, loud and soft.
Clean and purposeful, the song shapes the
compelling ruckus of the band's earlier work
into something complete. That goes double
lor "Sounds of Sebring," which begins with a
bright shimmer that turns into woozy, sooth
ing stuff without skipping a beat. Fading out
with pounding drums and fading in to the
metallic crunch of "San Cristobal de Las
( is,is," it compacts the Swirlies' varied styles
into a four-minute tune with ease.
Still, a little more self-editing would be
nice: lake out the inevitable fake tracks of
idle chatter (hint: skip the first and last
tracks) and the self-indulgent noodling(in
betweeners like "No Identifier" are kinda
cool, but unnecessary because the songs
make their own transitions), and the album
would be a more coherent piece. Alter all, the
Swirlies prove elsewhere on the record that
they speak eloquently by saying less.
