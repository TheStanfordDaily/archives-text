## UNWRITTEN LAW 
### 
Oz Factor

I'd been told a lot of good things about
Unwritten Law, and my friends had played
me a couple of their songs which I thought
were pretty cool. So when I saw that the latest
Unwritten Law album, "Oz Factor," was up
lor review, 1 eagerly took it home and listened
to it.
At first I thoueht to myself, "This could be

pretty cool." But then my thoughts stopped
there. Don't get me wrong, Unwritten Law is
a good band and they have some great songs.
But this album fits in perfectly with the 3-disc
"Almost, but..." rating.
"Superman," the opening track, is pretty
catchy. The chorus "Ah yeah I'm super
man / a three-piece suit and master
plan / here I come to save the day," echoed
through my head for awhile after I first heard
the song. It brings to mind pictures of
happy-go-lucky punk bands playing at par
ties.
The band then picks up its pace for the
title song, "Oz Factor." With a quick beat and
fast guitar riffs, the song captures most of
what you'd expect from a punk band. Vocal
ist Scott Russo adds a unique sound to the
band, with an almost passive voice rather
than the authoritative, harsh vocals that most
bands have.
One of the better songs on the album,
"Denied," has a slower pace than "Oz Factor."
The opening guitar riff sets the tone for the
song, and once again Russo's vocals add a
vital part to the song's success. There's even a
hint of an acoustic guitar in this song, and
while it by no means dominates the sound, it
definitely adds a little spice to it.
The rest of the album fluctuates between
slower songs like "Differences" and faster
ones like "Tell Me Why." The songs are all
well written and performed, but I guess it
just didn't fill me up with that special feeling
that some albums do. They have a good
sound, but this album iust lacks that certain
"umph" that would have made it more mem
orable.
