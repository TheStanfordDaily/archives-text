Tales of Great Neck
Glory

In 1994, Sammy released their "Debut
Album," a record best noted for its shameless
imitation of Pavement and the Velvet Under
ground. Lazy melodies decked with pleasing
guitar buzz and healthy bits of sarcasm, the
whole thing reeked of a big rip off, yet it suc
ceeded because the group seemed aware of

what they were doing, and
they actually seemed proud of
it. It was all a big joke to them,
pissing off indie purists by tak
ing what they liked and mak
ing it their own.
In a 1994 fanzine interview,
Sammy guitarist Luke Wood
suggested, "Maybe it's just us
taking Pavement's appropriat
ing indie rock a step further
down the path towards decon
struction by appropriating the
appropriator, or as L)uran
Duran said, 'I am the Wolf. I'm
after you.' " He's right. Pave
ment's "Silence Kit" borrows
from Buddy Holly, just as their
"Conduit for Sale" borrows
from the Fall's "New Face in
Hell." So at the time, Sammy's
stealing from the stealers
seemed justified and genuine
ly amusing.
But clever satire only goes

so tar in obscuring a hand's own lack of in
vention, and Sammy's new album "Tales of
Great Neck Glory," on Geffen Records, is lit
tle more than a pleasant bore. This time
around, the group's Lou Reed-isms are more
obvious than their Pavement-isms, but their
joke isn't funny anymore because they're not
acknowledging it. What's left are a bunch of
empty pop songs, some mediocre meander
ing tracks and a couple crappy ones.
Most of the stuff here ("Slim Style," "Any
thing," "Chilling Excerpts Bare the Soul of a
Monster," etc.) just goes in one ear and out
the other But at least the peppy "Neptune
Ave. (Ortho Hi Rise)" and "Red Lights Mash
ing" have their charms, and 1 guess we should
give vocalist Jesse Hartman credit for doing
the best Lou Reed impression I've ever heard.
In a telling moment of "Encyclopedi-ite,"
over a "Here Gomes the Sun"-influenced
melody, Hartman .sings, "1 absorbed like .1
sponge / everything that you'd done / I fol
lowed your lead / 1 never once disagreed."
Judging from "Tales of Great Neck Glory,"
maybe it's time that they disagreed.
