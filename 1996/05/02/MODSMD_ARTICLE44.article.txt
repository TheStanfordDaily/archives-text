# ELYSIAN FIELDS Elysian Fields
## 
### 
Whether it was Poison stating that "Every
Rose Has Its Thorn" or John Cougar Mellen
camp yapping about how it "Hurts So
Good," a plethora of ridiculous rock songs
have been inspired by the pain inherent in
our most sacred moments. This is why I was
a tad apprehensive upon learning that the
focus of Hlysian Fields' eponymous debut EP
was, as the back cover says, the "moments of
escape" in our "troubled and complex
world."
Elysian fields, however, are not Poison,
and the EP's four tracks are anything but
ridiculous rock. Hailing from New York City
and taking their name from the mythological
abode of the blessed dead, Elysian Fields
wrap edgy guitar lines around the jazz-influ
enced vocals of Jennifer Charles to create a
sadomasochistic vision of the world that eeri
ly rings true.
"I put my hands in the fire / but 1 can't feel
the flame," sings Charles over the subtle stops
and starts of "Move Me," teasing us with an
explosion that never comes. The listener is
likewise taunted throughout the chugging
piano stylings of "Star," in which Charles
dares us, "You can make me if you try / gen
tly like a lullaby."
The beautiful frustration Charles induces
comes to a head in the stripped down, lethar
gic "Diamonds All Day.""I want some /1
need to pray," she desperately intones before
succumbing to the intensifying hum of back
ground horns.
The juxtaposition of elements on this EP
— creepy but pretty music, sultry but some
how threatening lyrics — is stunning. And
Charles' voice is truly a rare bird — the only
way to accurately describe it is sexy, albeit
sexy without any of that word's usual trap
pings or false pretense. Or, as Charles herself
sings on the EP's slippery, distortion-tinged,
closing track, "Get Rich," "I pack a wallop /1
ain't no palooka." Indeed.
