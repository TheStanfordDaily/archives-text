Theaier 3000: The Movie

You don't need to be a fan of Comedy Central's cult fav
"Mystery Science Theater 3000" to giggle through the risky big
screen version, though it'd probably make you more likely to
get to the Hick before cable does.
Still, as soon as the credits roll, Mike and the 'droids prove as
sharp and unrelenting .is ever in their quips. Probably more so
considering they're aiming big time now.
Yup, the gang's all there — Mike, ( tow, Tom Servo and our
motherly (iypsy — repainted, remodeled and refurbished with
a film-sized budget. And, unleashed with a PC ■ 13 vocabulary,
the guys get to go a few words past their much-toted "dickwad."
Thus the adventure begins anew. And once we stomach the
reintroduction of the TV show's exposition (i.e., our bland but
likable Mike is held hostage on The Satellite ol Love where his
irritatinglv maniacal captor, Dr. Forrester, sends him awful
movies to watch in the hopes of driving him insane) our atten
tion turns to the show's more entertaining convention: the
mocking of sub-mediocre movies.
In its past the gang has made chopped liver out of dozens ol
llicks, from the Codzillas to the Mothras to "Alien I rom 1..A.
starring Kathy Ireland to "Santa Clans Conquers the Martians"
featuring a prepubescent Pia Xadora. This time the focus is on an
egregiously put together bit of science fiction, entitled "This Is
land Earth."
This particular llick s discombobulated plot and two-dimen
sional characters give rise to a first class MST3K barrage of Shat
ner jokes, plot shots and an understatement of "C iilligan's Island"
references (considering the cameo by our dear Professor). The
quips hit even harder than usual, polished and rehearsed and
coming at you so incessantly that you can't remember a single
one to tell your friends later.
Same as always, right?
I lowever, to the discerning fan, the banter might seem a touch
toned down in the eclectic / high brow department — expecting
a wider audience, head writer (and mild-mannered host)
Michael I. Nelson made sure that the average Joe can get a good
cS6 percent of the references, as opposed to the more usual 73.
Unfortunately, you have to wonder if the sum total of the big
ger budget reverie isn't anything more than one of the best damn
episodes of MST3K you'll ever see. The familiar conventions
aren't explored any further than basic reincorporation and a
meta-fmale where they do their thing on their very own credits.
But who cares, right? The audience'll still dig it. Sure, mock
ery is among the lower forms of comedy, but when it's done as
well as these ol' pros do it, why the hell not?
