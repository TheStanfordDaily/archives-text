# Mulholland Falls
## 
### 
"Mulholland Falls" manages to combine
in one fell stroke a return to slick film noire
and the return of every actor in I lollywood
who hasn't been in a movie since 19K2.
A dark and stylish treatment of the mur
der mystery genre, "Mulholland Falls" is
suspenseful and fast-paced throughout
most of the film, but falls flat — and de
scends into some serious cheese — by the
end.
The film — set in the early *50s— centers
on the "Hat Squad," four brut.il, single
minded cops who are set outside the law to
eliminate organized crime in 1..A. with their
fists. Nick Nolte plays Max Hoover, the
heart and soul of the squad who runs about
spouting lines like, "We answer to nobody"
and "This isn't America, this is 1..A." to the
gangsters the squad kicks the crap out of
and eventually kills. The film's title comes
from the cliff that the squad flings its ene
mies off of.

The movie's intentional comic relief
comes from the dynamic between the four
Hat Squad members. Michael Madsen and
( lit is Penn are the 1 kits with the least screen
time. Their characters never really get devel
oped, and the actors seem to be "Reservoir
Dogs" turned policemen, toned down ver
sions of former performances — though
they remain fun to watch. It is Chazz
Palminteri who supplies the humor as a re
formed violent thug who speaks in psychob
abble and Pesci-esque monologues, the dar
ling of the squad and a devoted partner to
Max.
These four men, though sadistic and
cruel, are keeping some semblance of order
in their lives until the murder of a young
women turns their world on its ear. This
murder becomes an obsession for Nolte,
who has a mysterious connection to the
crime. The hunt for her killer draws the four
men into a power struggle beyond orga
nized ciime as they battle the military, the
FBI, nuclear war and bad flashbacks — the
unintentional comic relief.
Direction bv Fee Tamahori deftly weaves

the strands of plot together as the murder
overtakes Nolle and his squad. The ls)sos
setting combines with the tense direction to
create a noire-ish feel that is only spoiled by
overdone supporting performances and a
finale that is decidedly uncreative.
The four members of the Hat Squad en
counter more than just disappointing end
ings, they also deal with the Ghosts of
Movies Past. In small parts we see Melanie
Griffith as Nolte's unfortunate stays-up
waiting wife, John Malkovich as a sinister
general, Daniel "The Fourth" Baldwin,
Treat Williams as an overzealous army man,
Jennifer Connelly — who has almost no
lines but a lot ofbacklit love flashbacks with
men twice her age — and my personal fa
vorite, an exhausted-looking Andrew Mc-
Carthy as a video pornographer. The cast is
so starry and huge that it makes it almost
impossible for any actor to have more than a
cameo.
Despite all the scattered casting, Nolte
provides a solid, pained center for the film
that overcomes a good deal of the silliness
surrounding him. If the viewer keens from

laughing at the wrong time, "Mulholland
Falls" is a thriller that works — if not in
America, at least in L. A.
