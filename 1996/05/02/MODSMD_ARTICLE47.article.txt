Plain women of the world, unite.
In"The Truth About Cats and Dogs,"
Janeane Garofalo plays the postergirl for
the brains-not-beauty population of
women who have all the right ingredients
for attractiveness except peroxide and
anorexia. The movie constantly pokes
fun at how homely Garofalo is, compar
ing her to supposed gift-from-the-gods
co-star Uma Thurman, who plays dit/y
model Noelle Slusarsky. The only prob
lem is that Janeane's character, Abby
Barnes, is actually infinitely more appeal
ing, physically and spiritually, her charm
ing persona being the primary reason this
potentially routine romantic comedy is
so satisfying.
The movie examines issues of physical
appearance and self-esteem in a new in
terpretation of the "Cyrano de Bergerac"
story. The heroine Abby is portrayed
from the start as a woman who is smart
and funny and caring, but so ordinary
looking that one man opens the door for
a woman in front of Abby, then lets the
door swing closed in her face.
I lowcver, Abby demonstrates her con
fidence and wit as a radio talk show host
who gives advice to troubled pet-owners,
such as cute British photographer Brian
(Ben Chaplin) who calls her program in a
panic for some help with an angry dog on
roller skates. But when Brian later asks
her out without having met her, Abby

can't risk the chance of rejection based on
her looks, and ends up persuading him
that the tall, blonde Noelle is actually her.
Ot course, Brian falls in love with this
gorgeous angel who seems to have every
thing going for her, and the movie keeps
him in the dark as the two women try to
sort out their identities. Still, we find our
selves wondering how clueless this man
can possibly be when Noelle says things
like, "No one's ever given me a book be
fore that didn't have pictures in it,"and he
doesn't think to question if she's the same
witty woman he speaks with on the
phone.
One of the pitfalls the movie succumbs I
to is Uma Thurman's portrayal of a shal- |
low beauty who giggles when she doesn't
understand something and says she never I
eats so she can "look good on the out
side." The implication is that a less attrac
tive woman only deserves a man because
the daz/ling alternative is completely
vapid.
It was refreshing that the film develops
the friendship between the two women,
rather than simply indicating their
mounting rivalry for the affection of
Brian. At one point, Abby says,"I refuse ■
to degenerate into some misogynous |
cliche." The women fill the gaps in each
other's self-image, Abby lacking confi
dence in her looks, Noelle in her person- jj
ality.
Anyone who has questioned their own
attractiveness (i.e., everyone) can identi
fy with Abby's situation, and the adorable
Garofalo ("Reality Bites," "Bye Bye
Love") makes it easy to turn traditional
conceptions of beauty inside out.
