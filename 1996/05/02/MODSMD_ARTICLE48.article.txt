# The
						Quest
## 
### 
If you are on a quest for a movie
worth watching, then my best advice
to you would be to keep on search
ing.
Ever seen "Bloodsport?" Well,
"The Quest" is basically the same
movie (just set in a different coun
try): Van Da mine's friend gets killed
sparking his righteous avowal of
vengeance. Of course in the end, he
wins.
Few things could make this movie
worth watching. Unlike many action
movies where the quest is for a good
cause, this one is for a large dragon
made of gold, bearing close resem
blance to the one of "Mortal Kom
bat" fame.
Once Van 1 )amme has entered the
tournament to fight, there is a capti
vating scene in which a fighter from
Brazil and another from Korea bat
tle. This is a fight worth seeing, their
moves are done in real time and they
look more as if they are dancing than
fighting, each of them clearly the
master of their art.
The introduction of Roger Moore
(the James Bond we grew up with
after Connery and before Brosnan)
as an antagonist-turned-friend also
gives the movie a lift. Perhaps the

best part is when Moore introduces
himself as "Cobbs. Lord Cobbs."
Unfortunately, all the Bond allu
sions in the world could not carry
this failing movie.
Van Damme (in his directorial
debut) is guilty of creating a faulty
gap-filled plot. The times and places
change so often that the audience
gives up any attempt to determine
where they are at a given time. It
wouldn't help you anyway, because
Van Damme's New York of the 1920s
looks more like a European country
side in lull bloom and his people of
the '20s all have badly affected ac
cents, mannerisms and makeup.
This movie's comic elements
come off as more racially offensive
than amusing. Supposedly, all of the
countries in the world (including
Japan, Scotland and "Africa") have
sent their best fighters to compete for
the golden dragon. Grossly stereo
typed ethnic theme music accompa
nies the film's intercultural battles:
the African tights to tribal drums in
the background, the Spaniard to
tango and the Japanese to a resonat
ing gong. (Unfortunately, the Scots
man doesn't get any bagpipes.)
After tolerating "The Quest," my
advice for Van Damme is this: forget
a career in directing. Shut up and
fight.
