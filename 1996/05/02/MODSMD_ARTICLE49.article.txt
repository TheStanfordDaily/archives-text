## Craig Garrett Two Thumbs Down—WAY Down! 
### 
Look around — there are an awful lot of
critics in this world, waving their
thumbs around, passing judgment on
anything they see and trying hard to justify
their own existence. Look closely and you'll
notice that they are all full of shit.
In a subtle way, critics are people ob
sessed with power. Crucial to their task of
interpreting art is not only their own (per
ceived) privileged role as cultural authori
ties, but also their belief in the artist as an
even higher authority, a pseudo-divinity
who invests art with truth. Not everyone
who sits down in front of an easel or a type
writer is an artist by the critic's definition
because not all works of art contain truth.
The critic's self-appointed job, then, is to
search for this truth through carefully rea
soned and informed analysis, and depend
ing on its presence or absence, to judge the
work as "art" or as garbage — thumbs up or
thumbs down.
When a performer refuses to sit for an
interview or says something like "Oh, I
never read reviews of my work,"' critics call
that person a brat, say that he or she is
spoiled, pretentious and self-absorbed. The
reason this person is not meek and submis
sive to critics, though, is that he or she does

not recognize their self-appointed authori
ty, for unlike criticism and interpretation,
the production of art has nothing to do
with power relations.
Seeing art in terms of authority and
power makes the production of real art im
possible, and the reason that critics do not
make art (despite t' vir "knowing" so much
about it) is their belief in the artist's author
ity and divine role. Artists know that this
belief in their divinity is nonsense. Once
you realize that an artist is just a person like
yourself and that art is not some holy relic
invested with magical powers, making art
becomes possible and criticism becomes
meaningless. When the belief in an artist's
divinity is gone, as is necessary for anyone
who creates art, the foundation on which
the whole critical enterprise is resting dis
appears.
Upon this foundation, though, critics
have built an art "world." People who be
lieve in this world study the critics' history
of art, in colleges, libraries and museums
(or, in the case of art forms like rock music
or movies, in magazines and newspapers
like this one). This study of art is as com
plicated a field of inquiry as any science,
except that while a discipline like physics

uses its established tools and methods to
excavate truth of the natural world, art
criticism uses its tools to unearth the truth
in a work of art (put there by their artist
god). lots of critics even use numerical val
ues (i.e., a one-to-five scale of stars or plat
ters) as a way to justify their claim to em
pirical knowledge.
Critics quickly come to believe in the au
thority which their Ph.D. or their circula
tion of 50,000 endows upon them, as do
many of the people who read their criti
cism. Most of these consumers of critical
discourse look to critics to tell them what is
art and what is not, to show them where
truth resides, as best as their untrained
minds can comprehend it: "Hey, this movie
is supposed to be good. Siskel and Ebert
gave it two thumbs up."
Today, as the number of MFAs conferred
each year grows, more and more artists are
receiving the same education as critics and
theorists. To succeed in the "art world " cre
ated as it was by criticism and interpreta
tion, artists must understand its standards
and criteria. In wanting to succeed in this
art world, though, these artists indicate that
they, too, see art as power and competition.
Art becomes just another market for com

petition and the exchange of commodities.
The critics have thus already van
quished thousands of potential artists by
making them subordinates to criticism, fi
nally securing for themselves the power
that they had so envied. Siskel and Ebert's
ultimate critical gesture — phallic in na
ture — has become an appropriate histor
ical symbol; like Roman emperors, critics
now are not only spectators of a blood
sport of their own creation, but also the
final judge of the performers' fate. Hope
fully artists who try to be stars in this arena
understand the rules to which they arc
agreeing. Hopefully they see what they
have let themselves become.
There's still room in this world for art
that isn't about competition, though, and
there are a still good reasons for making art
(any kind of art). Critical acclaim, however,
is not one of them, and if financial success is
what you're after, you should be a lawyer or
a stock analyst. If you are interested in cre
ating something, though, go do it and don't
worry whether it's "good" or "bad." Don't
worry whether it's "art." And if a critic tries
to stick his thumb where it doesn't belong,
tell him to go suck it himself because you
sure as hell aren't going to.
