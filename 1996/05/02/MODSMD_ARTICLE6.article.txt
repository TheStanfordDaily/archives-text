# It's back! Olympic torch returns and a sophomore shall carry it
## Follow the flame 
### Beth Berselli Editorial staff 
Twelve years after its last visit,
the Olympic (lame returns to
Stanford tomorrow on the sev
enth day of its 15,000-mile, 42-
state, 84-day journey to Atlanta.
The flame will be on the Farm
for 45 minutes, traveling from
Galvez Street to Hoover Tower to
Palm Drive and back out to El
Camino Real on its way up to San
Francisco.
The 3 1/2-pound torch will ex
change hands seven times on
campus and will also appear at
a ceremony to honor Stanford
Olympians.
Sophomore Landee Lopez will
bring the torch onto campus. She
will turn left onto Galvez Street
from El Camino Real at about
9:31 a.m. Aboutsix minutes later,
after completing her running seg
ment, she will hand the torch off
to Gloria Burns, a San Jose ele
mentary school principal.
The torch will then stop for
about 20 minutes at Hoover
Tower for a ceremony honoring
Stanford's Olympic athletes.
Men's Swimming Coach Skip
Kenney, head coach of the
Olympic team, will be joined by
Olympic swim team members
Kurt Grote, Jeff Rouse and Ray
Carey. Also present will be Jair
Lynch, a '92 Olympic gymnast
and '96 hopeful, and Olympic
baseball player A.J. Hinch.
Carey said the ceremony will
give him an "extra boost" in his
Olympic preparations. "It means
a lot to see the torch go by as
you're preparing for the Olympic
meet," said Carey, who will com
pete in the 200 meter butterfly.
"It reminds you that you're really
representing the U.S."
Lopez, who was selected to

carry the torch due to her com
munity service activities, said she
is excited and proud to carry the
Olympic flame. "It's just an
amazing thing. You see it on TV
and it's hard to believe it'll be me
in just a few days," she said.
Lopez isn't the only torchbear
er among the 10,000 people who
will carry it with a Stanford con
nection. Other torchbearers dur
ing the cross-country trek include
Olympic gold medalist and Stan
ford alumna Janet Evans and 88-
year-old Harlow Rothert, who
earned both his undergraduate
and law degrees from Stanford in
the 19305. Rothert won a silver
medal for the shot-put in the

1932 games and is scheduled to
carry the torch earlier in the
morning in Santa Clara.
Although he uses an alu
minum walker to get around,
Rothert is confident he will be
able to complete his running seg
ment. "I might be a little slower
than the others," he said. "I'm re
ally looking forward to it."
More than half the torch carri
ers are United Way Community
Heroes, selected for their good
works and devotion to social
ideals. About 2,500 people were
selected through Coca-Cola's
"Share the Spirit" program; the


Sothy Chhe â€” Daily
remaining torchbearers are for
mer Olympians chosen by the
U.S. Olympic Committee. Each
runner carries the torch for 1
kilometer.
Lopez said she found out in
early April that she was chosen as
a torchbearer. "My parents origi
nally nominated me as a Commu
nity Hero but I didn't get it,"
Lopez said. "The local panel of
judges for the Community Hero
program passed my name onto
the Coca-Cola people." Coca-Cola
is sponsoring the torch relay.
A representative from Coca-
Cola interviewed Lopez over the
phone during spring break and
offered her a spot. "Of course I
said yes," Lopez said.
During her years at Santa
Clara High School, Lopez served
as the president of the commu

nity service club, worked as a
peer counselor and volunteered
at a soup kitchen and convales
cent home. While at Stanford,
Lopez has served as her dormi
tory's community service repre
sentative and as a teacher's aide
at a Mountain View elementary
school. She also helped organize
this year's Community Carni
val.
Runners have the option of
having "a sponsor" pay for the
$275 flame. Lopez said she is
planning to keep her torch.
The Olympic torch is 32 inches
high and is made out of alu
minum reeds, a hardwood handle
and gold-plated brass bands.
About 17,000 torches were pro
duced for the '96 games.
The flame began its journey
across the country Saturday in
Los Angeles and will reach At
lanta July 19 in time for the
Opening Ceremony of the Cen
tennial Olympic Games.
