# Star Trek final?
## New program will bring innovative classes to high schools 
### Yvonne Chiu Contributing writer 
David Harris believes that public schools are not
giving their students sufficient knowledge or chal
lenges, and he's taking action to change that.
"Our education system is so weak. We have the po
tential to be the best in the world, but often our stu
dents come out poorer academically than students in
many Third World countries," said Harris, a first
year doctoral student in electrical engineering.
Through Educational Studies Program, a student
service organization, Harris and like-minded Stan
ford students are hoping to address such weaknesses.
The program is seeking teachers for its enrichment
program for Bay Area high school students in the fall.
ESP, which is based on MlT's High School Studies
Program, will be held for eight Saturdays starting in
October, with one- to two-hour classes. The teachers
will conduct classes in whatever topics they wish.
Classes at the MIT program have ranged from "Star
Trek Through a Microscope and Into a Looking
Glass" to "The Earth is Flat: Prove Me Wrong."
"The challenge is to come up with something
that's never been taught before," said Harris.
Harris, who himself has participated in several en
richment programs, stressed the importance of an ap
propriate learning environment for children. "Lots of
times in public school, kids get turned off of learning.
It's unpopular to be smart," he said. "The goal is to get
these kids, many of whom may become Stanford stu

dents, together and let them interact. They'll also be
going in-depth, beyond what they can get in school."
Junior Kei Harris, who will teach a creative writ
ing class, agreed. "I wasn't exposed to fiction writing
until I got [to Stanford]," she said. "If I had had it in
high school, I would have eaten it up. All I did was ex
pository writing then, and while I enjoyed it, I wish I
had known that there was more."
Kei Harris said she thinks everyone has a "yearn
ing to give back to the community.
"When you can do that in a way specific to you,
that's even more rewarding," she said. "We're chan
neling the enthusiasm we have as college students
into the kids."
"Others went out of their way to help me learn,"
David Harris added, "and this is a chance to give back
to people who will one day be in my shoes."
He said he enjoys teaching because he likes work
ing with people who like learning. "I like students
who challenge me, who ask me hard questions," he
said. "It forces me to master the subject."
So far, 22 people have expressed interest in teach
ing at ESP. A few more undergraduate than graduate
students have signed up, encompassing a wide array
of majors. "The main thing right now is to get teach
ers who are psyched about working with kids, who
are creative and have something they really love and
want to share," David Harris said.

ESP will take applications until Monday. The group
meets Mondays on the second floor of Tressider Union.
