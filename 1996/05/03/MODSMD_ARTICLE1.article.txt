# Vote for human rights too late
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami 
A University investment com
mittee voted Wednesday to ask
PepsiCo, Texaco and Unocal to ex
amine the ethics and human rights
of the countries in which they in
vest. Each of the three companies
invests in Myanmar, the country
in Southeast Asia formerly known
as Burma.
However, the decision by the
Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility came just hours too
late for the University to cast a
vote in time for the annual Pepsi-
Co shareholders' meeting held
that night. Votes must be cast 24
hours prior to the meeting.
Two shareholder resolutions
concerning human rights issues in
Myanmar and funding for anti-to
bacco campaigns were presented to
Pepsi Co. The committee was not
able to reach an agreement on the
human rights resolution in time
for the shareholders' meeting
The Advisory Panel on Invest
ment Responsibility — a panel of
students, faculty, alumni and se
nior administrative staff which
hears concerns on investment re
sponsibility — usually makes the
original recommendations to the
committee. The panel voted on the
two resolutions Monday and for
warded its recommendation to
SCIR the following day.
The Myanmar-related resolu
tion was reached in time for the
May 14 Texaco shareholders'
meeting and the June 3 Unocal
shareholders' meeting. Stanford
holds shares in PepsiCo, Texaco
and Unocal, all of which invest in
Myanmar. The Southeast Asian
country and its military dictator
ship have been criticized for al-
leged human rights abuses.
. "If it did not have an impact on
PepsiCo, it is unfortunate," said
University Trustee Roger Clay,
chair of SCIR.
Members of Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford ac
costed University President Ger
hard Casper on his way to work
yesterday morning, voicing con-

cerns that student and community
opinion are not heard in decisions
regarding investment responsibili
ty-
"lt was very frustrating," said
SEAS member Nick Thompson.
"The agreement on the resolution
was a slow process. I am happy the
resolution passed, but it had no im
pact" on Pepsi Co.
"There is nothing we can do
about PepsiCo now," said Kelly
Naylor, co-chair of SEAS. "We
have done all we can. We are going
to focus on Unocal and Texaco for

now, to make certain voting takes
place by their deadlines."
The committee vote on the to
bacco-related shareholder resolu
tion was cast prior to Wednesday.
The resolution requested that
companies donate about 3 percent
of their profits to a third party,
such as the American Heart Asso
ciation or the American Cancer So
ciety, which would sponsor an ad
vertising campaign to prevent
smoking.
The committee reached an
agreement on this resolution

Tuesday, just in time for the voting
the next day.
"It must be understood that the
members of SCIR are mostly vol
unteers who hold responsibilities
in their businesses as well," said
Linda Kimball, an administrative
associate at Stanford Management
Company and member of both the
panel and the committee. "In fact,
when the meeting was called to re
view the APIR recommendation,
some of the members were away
on business trips, which inevitably
slowed down the process."
