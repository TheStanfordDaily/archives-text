## On the field again Senate passes immigration bill 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A nearly
unanimous Senate passed an immigra
tion bill yesterday that would tighten
border controls and make it tougher for
illegal aliens to get U.S. jobs. It would
also curtail legal immigrants' access to
social services.
The 97-3 vote sends a message "that
America will no longer stand by passive
ly — we will take control of our borders,"
said Senate Majority leader Bob Dole,
the presumptive GOP presidential nom
inee.
President Clinton said he was
"pleased that the Senate has endorsed
our strategy with legislation that
answers my administration's call for
tougher penalties for alien smugglers,
criminal aliens and manufacturers and
sellers of fraudulent documents."
"I urge the Congress to quickly final
ize and send me this key legislation,"
Clinton said in a statement.
The measure would nearly double the
border patrol guards to about 10,000,
authorize pilot projects that would let
employers easily verify whether a work
er is eligible for a job in the United States
and increase penalties for document
fraud and alien smuggling.
"We have stuff in there that has every
thing but the rack and the thumbscrew
for people who are violating the laws of
the United States," said the measure's

chief author, Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.
The bill also contains "far-reaching
and comprehensive" provisions to
"reduce the opportunities of the job mar
ket to be a magnet for those that want to
come across our borders and work in
America and displace American work
ers," said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-
Mass., who worked with Simpson to
craft the bill.
Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of
Texas said the bill "will mean stronger
control of our borders and a greater com
mitment to see that people come to
America to work and to build their
dream, not to live off the fruit of some
one else's labor."
Senate approval sends the legislation
to a conference committee, where nego
tiators will attempt to resolve differ
ences between Senate and House ver
sions of the bill.
A key difference is the House-passed
provision that would let states deny pub
lic education to undocumented immi
grant children. Kennedy called that
"offensive" and said he would work to
keep it out of the conference bill.
Neither the Senate bill nor the House
bill would impose new limits on the
number of legal immigrants admitted.
The House stripped out such provisions.
In the Senate, a separate bill addressing
that issue awaits action, although Simp

son said that was dead for now.
"The work with legal immigration
will be done at some future time by
future legislators," he said.
To reduce employment of illegal
aliens, the Senate bill calls for standard
ized, counterfeit-proof birth certificates
and other state-issued identifying docu
ments, while making it easier for
employers to ensure that the people they
hire are eligible to work here.
It would reduce from 29 to six the
number of acceptable identifying docu
ments and set up a database that
employers could contact to make sure a
worker's name and Social Security num
ber matched.
Although the bill largely targets ille
gal aliens, it also would make it tougher
for legal immigrants to obtain needs
based public benefits. Under current
law, the income of an immigrant's spon
sor is considered in deciding eligibility
for certain benefits — Aid to Families
with Dependent Children, Supplemental
Security Income and food stamps — for
three years after arrival.
The Senate bill would consider the
sponsor's income for almost {ill public
benefits — with the exception of the
school lunch and Women, Infants and
Children feeding programs — for up to
10 years or until the immigrant becomes
a citizen, which takes five years.
