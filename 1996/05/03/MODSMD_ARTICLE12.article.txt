# 150 arrested in federal drug bust
## Mexican-Columbian smuggling ring reveals a new sophistication 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal agents
wrapped up more than 150 arrests yester
day designed to break up a coast-to coast
Mexican-Colombian cocaine smuggling
ring that revealed new sophistication and
distribution by growing Mexican gangs.
Code-named "Zorro II,"the operation
was the first to arrest Mexican drug couri
ers and dealers and Colombian traffickers
from ring managers in this country down
to street-level crack cocaine dealers, Drug
Enforcement Administration officials said.
Arrests began in February, but their
link to the overall investigation by 10 feder
al and 42 state and local law enforcement
agencies was not disclosed until they were
completed yesterday.
Beginning last September, agents traced
cocaine produced by Colombia's Cali cartel
as it was driven by Mexican couriers across
the U.S.-Mexican border in California, Ari
zona and Texas to the stash houses of
wholesalers in Los Angeles. From there,
the cocaine was distributed to Colombian
street dealers in the Washington Heights
section of New York City and in Richmond,
Va., and to Mexican dealers in the West, in
Texas and in Chicago, DEA agents said.
Undercover agents, informants and
more than 90 court-authorized wiretaps
were used to track the cocaine and identify
rine- members.

"We have surgically removed an entire
operation," said Mike Horn, chief of DEA
special operations. "We took out not just
the top people — the cell managers and
major wholesalers — but we also attacked
the violent local organizations. We took
everything."
Horn said the ring moved cocaine with a
wholesale value of $100 million during the
eight-month investigation. He said the
arrests would only disrupt, not halt, the
smuggling because the Mexicans and
Colombians have ot her similar rings oper
ating in this country.
Some of the Mexicans in custody are
associates of the Arellano-Felix brothers
gang in Tijuana, one of four major Mexican
gangs, said Theresa Vim Vliet, the Justice
Department's narcotics section chief.
Known as the "Mexican Federation," the
four gangs have emerged as second only to
the Cali cartel in the distribution of cocaine
in this country, DEA officials said.
The Mexicans began as transporters of
Colombian cocaine across the Southwest
border, but they are now taking payment
for that courier work in cocaine rather than
cash. Mexican members of the ring dis
tributed the cocaine to their own network
in the West, in Texas and in Chicago, DEA
officials said.
"In i/os Angeles, the Mexicans were

even undercutting the Colombians on the
price of cocaine," DEA agent Mike Ferga
son said. "The Mexicans were charging
about $13,000 per kilo (2.2 pounds), and
the Colombians about $16,000," said Bill
Healey, Horn's deputy at DEA.
Twenty-nine people were charged in
drug-trafficking conspiracy indictments
unsealed in Chicago and Midland, Texas,
yesterday. Fifteen of them were arrested
yesterday morning in Ix>s Angeles, Chica
go, El Paso, Houston and Midland, and
more arrests were under way.
An additional 136 people had been
arrested earlier, including 44 alleged mem
bers of the Colombian organisation taken
into custody Feb. 22-25 in Los Angeles,
New York, Newark, Miami, Philadelphia
and Richmond. Arrests primarily of alleged
Mexican gang members took place last
week in Ix»s Angeles, San Diego and Mid
land.
Before yesterday, 5,598 kilograms
(about 6 tons) of cocaine had been seized,
1,018 pounds of marijuana and half a
pound of crack cocaine. Federal agents had
seized $17,060,629 in cash and vehicles
before yesterday.
The Colombians flew and drove their
money by courier to Miami where some
was wired home and the rest shipped in
cash, agents said.
