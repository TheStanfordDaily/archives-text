South Side murderer confesses
CHICAGO (AP) — A man was charged with killing 12 women on the
city's South Side, many of them drug addicts and prostitutes, and stashing
his latest victim in his bedroom closet until his mother could help him dis
pose of the body.
Gregory Clepper, a 28-year-old crack addict, signed confessions to the
killings, State Attorney Jack O'Malley said yesterday.
In a string of slayings that began in 1991, Clepper strangled or beat pros
titutes when they objected to his refusal to pay them and left the bodies in
alleys or garbage bins, police said. One body was discovered by a worker sort
ing items at the city's recycling center.
Police said they tracked Clepper down after he boasted to an acquain
tance of killing 30-year-old Patricia Scott. She was found raped and stran
gled in a trash bin at a high school on April 24.

Clepper allegedly killed Scott a day earlier at the home he shared with his
mother, Gladys Clepper, and stashed the body in his closet.
Donahue calls it quits
NEW YORK (AP) — An ebullient Phil Donahue, with a studio audience
of old friends, co-workers and reporters, taped the final episode of his 29-
year-old talk show and closed it with a champagne shower from his gleeful
staff.
"We were naughty in 1967. That's how we got here," Donahue said after
wrapping "Donahue," which debuted as "The Phil Donahue Show" nearly
7,000 episodes ago, on Nov. 6, 1967, on WLWD-TV in Dayton, Ohio.
The program moved to Chicago in 1974, entered national syndication and
led the ratings until the 1986-87 season, when a rookie Chicago competitor,
Oprah Winfrey, took over first place for keeps.
