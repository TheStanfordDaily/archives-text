# Arafat wants U.N. to help Middle East peace process

### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - After a
rare White House visit, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat went to the United Nations
yesterday and urged the world body to give
the Middle East peace process a helping
nudge.
Arafat, wearing his customary uniform
and checkered headdress, was immediately
ushered to the top floor of the building to
meet with U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali.
"We demand a more effective role by
the United Nations in the peace process,"
Arafat said later.
The level of security was extraordinary.
More than 100 New York City police offi
cers and 25 State Department agents
flanked the Palestinian leader or guarded
his motorcade as he arrived at the U.N.'s
New York headquarters.
The United Nations has long been a
source of support for Palestinians. U.N.
agencies have been active in helping Pales
tinian refugees, and during the Cold War
the General Assembly routinely passed
resolutions critical of Israel.
Israel has regarded the United Nations
as biased and has long sought to keep the
world organization out of the peace pro
cess.
"We are looking from his excellency to
continue to push the peace process in all
the tracks," Arafat said as he sat down to
meet with Boutros-Ghali.
At a news conference, Arafat was asked

whether Israelis and Arabs could live
peacefully together.
"As neighbors. As neighbors," he
replied. "Now there will be two states. A
Palestinian state beside its neighbors, the
Israelis."
Arafat refused to comment on the
upcoming Israeli elections, which pit Shi
mon Peres, Arafat's partner in peace talks,
against the more hawkish Benjamin
Netanyahu.
"It is not my business," Arafat said.
When asked about terror attacks
against Israel, Arafat said that Palestini
ans "firmly stand against any effort from
any quarter that would undermine the
peace process."
Upon arriving, Arafat's black limousine
was trailed by a van filled with police car
rying loaded assault rifles. A blue police
patrol boat cruised in the East River
behind the building.
U.N. employees crowded in front of
windows on the ground floor of the build
ing and journalists who approached Arafat
had to pass through metal detectors.
Arafat arrived from Washington, where
he met Wednesday with President Clinton.
It was his first White House visit as a
national leader.
Arafat last visited the United Nations in
October, when he told the 185-nation Gen
eral Assembly that he had come "with the
olive branch hoisted over the peace of the
brave."
