## President opposes measure to limit damages in lawsuits 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Clinton vetoed
a bill yesterday limiting damages in product liability
lawsuits, an issue spiked with presidential politics
and angry charges about big-money campaign cash.
Clinton said he was protecting consumers. Repub
lican presidential rival Bob Dole said the winners
were the president's trial-lawyer pals.
The measure would limit punitive damages in
faulty-product cases to $250,000 — or to twice the
amount of direct compensation people win in suits
for injuries, economic losses or other damages. The
bill passed both the Mouse and Senate by margins
short of the two-thirds that would be needed to over
ride the veto.
In an Oval Office ceremony, Clinton said, "I
believe this bill tilts against American families and
would deprive them of the ability to recover fully
when they are injured by defective products," he said.
The measure had been opposed by every major
consumer and senior citizens group, Clinton said.
However, supporters said frivolous lawsuits and
huge awards were driving up consumer prices and
unduly rewarding trial lawyers.
Republican rival Dole said Clinton was merely try
ing to protect the interests of trial lawyers, among
the biggest contributors to the president's campaign.
"It is the trial lawyers who are calling the shots at
the White House," the Senate Republican leader
said.
It was Clinton's 15th veto and the latest in a grow
ing list of legislative disputes between the president
and Dole.
The battle was tinged with accusations about the
influence of well-heeled campaign contributors.
Paul Huard, senior vice president of the National
Association of Manufacturers, called Clinton's veto
"an obvious election-year payoff to the wealthy trial
lawyers who have funded his re-election campaign."
Yet, Joan Claybrook, president of the consumer
advocacy group Public Citizen, said the bill was "a
bailout for corporations that make bad products."
Dole earlier this week cited a study by the Center
for Responsive Politics showing lawyers and law
firms contributed $2.5 million to Clinton's re-elec
tion campaign during the first nine months of 1995.
However, the consumer group Citizen Action said
corporations and organizations favoring the bill gave
$5.9 million to members of Congress last year.
While Clinton said he favors legal reform, the
White House said Congress appeared unlikely to give
him a bill that he could sign this year.
"This bill would hurt families without truly
improving our legal system," the president said. "It
would mean more unsafe products in our homes. It
would let wrongdoers off the hook. I cannot allow it
to become law."
