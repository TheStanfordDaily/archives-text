## Editorial 'Vibrant azure' skies 
### 
University's new web
site speaks poorly for
its academic mission

From the beginning, it
seemed like a lousy idea. Why
the University needed to
spend $15,000 to hire an outside
design firm for its new World Wide
Web home page rather than take
advantage of the plethora of local
talent was a mystery.
If the page had been done in
house, surely the unfortunate
would not have occurred. Surely,
the theme color of the page would
not have been blue (or "vibrant
azure" as it is referred to by Stan
ford News Service).
The designers say they chose the
color because they were "struck by
the contrast between the sandstone
buildings, the red roofs and the
bright blue of the sky." It is difficult
to determine why Stanford's blue
sky is quite so significant. Most
universities, in most places, have
skies above them which oftentimes
are, in fact, blue.
But the problem is indicative of a
much larger trend on the Farm.
Certainly it was clear that the web
site of a pioneering school like
Stanford was in need of improve
ment. Though the new site takes
some design chances and incorpo
rates some interesting innovations,
it fails by blatantly trying to market
Stanford in the way one would try
to sell any other product. The new
home page, with its sunny pho
tographs and quotes from author
(and Stanford professor) Wallace
Stegner and University President
Gerhard Casper, do nothing to dis
tinguish Stanford's presence on the
Internet from that of any corpora
tion. It in no way speaks to Stan
ford's educational mission and aca
demic talent; it simply tries to
"sell" the University.
When Director of University
Communications Terry Shepard

put forth his "Strategic Communi
cations Plan" for the University,
many reacted negatively to the
attempt to boil the Farm's positive
attributes down to six words —
none of which had anything to do
with Stanford's educational mis
sion. Casper quickly retreated and
withdrew the plan after it was lam
basted by faculty and the local
press, saying that it had been a mis
take. This new web site seems to be
a continuation down Shepard's
path to a truly "incomparable" —
but not particularly academic —
institution.
For all the qualities that are
unique to our sandstone haven, it
seems that the Stanford adminis
tration is suffering an inferiority
complex. Constantly worried about
how they appear to the outside,
administrators forget about Stan
ford's diverse and rich center —
and play a losing game of superfi
cial public relations.
Evidence of this PR-focused atti
tude can be found all around cam
pus. The Tresidder Advisory Board
cannot simply announce that they
have decided to give a certain Mexi
can restaurant a space in Tresidder
Union — they must hold a "press
conference" several days after the
decision has been made. Support
for a self-defense program is not
announced when administrators
have completed their deliberations,
but during the keynote address at
the Herstory celebration, a much
more politically opportune time.
This kind of posturing seems far
more appropriate for inside the
Beltway — not in academia.
The problem of worrying about
image because one hopes that oth
ers will see beyond it is tautologi
cal. When the University makes
such an effort to exert a positive
image it simply winds up looking
like it is trying too hard. Rather
than having others view the "real"
Stanford — something which is
hard to do without experiencing it
themselves — the administration
does a disservice by putting forth a
superficial Stanford of which no
one is proud.
