## Questions of integrity 
### 
WITHOUT WANTING TO sound
mystical, I want to ask — have
you done an integrity check late
ly? I'm sure that one was done when your
model left the factory, but there are a few
miles on you now, and, if you haven't done
one lately, now is as good a time as any.
The dictionary defines integrity as a
wholeness, uprightness, honesty, sinceri
ty. I define integrity as adherence to a set
of values and ideals that guides one in
making decisions and taking responsibility
for one's actions. More plainly, it means to
say what one means and to mean what one
says. This requires a consistency that it
seems few people bother meeting.
At a simple level, it means keeping
promises. I have learned over the years to
lose track of people who cannot manage
to make their actions and words coincide.
You know the people I mean — the ones
who frequently say they'll meet you for
some specific activity, and then cancel at
the last minute, if they bother to cancel
at all, or leave you waiting somewhere for
an hour before you decide to give up and
go home. I have learned not to make
plans with those people who will tenta
tively accept your offer, not wanting to
have nothing planned for the weekend,
while waiting for an offer to do some
thing else, sometimes anything else. And,
here at Stanford, we have that something
called the honor code.
At another level, it means that our
words, thoughts and actions are consis

tent on a daily basis. Many of us believe
that recycling and energy conservation is
beneficial to the planet; do we do some
thing about it? Are we willing to walk out
of our way to toss that bottle into a recy
cling bin rather than in the garbage? It is
so easy to justify that your small contri
bution (or lack thereof) won't make a dif
ference. Many of us believe it is wrong to
stereotype or discriminate based on race,
gender, sexual preference, favorite color
etc., but do we speak up when we see
these things happening? Do we speak up
when we see things we consider offensive?
People who are aware can often tell
when moments in which their integrity is
in question have occurred. They feel that
certain fuzz mess start to grow in the pit
of their stomach. Then they hear them
selves rationalizing their actions or state
ments to anyone who will listen. Some
search unconsciously for approval and
acknowledgment from the listener that
the listener would have done the same
thing in this person's place. Others pro
claim defiantly that they did what they
did and would do it again, no matter what
anyone else says. Yeah, right.
I wish I could say that I've never expe
rienced the fluttering in my stomach.
Sometimes I walk into my inconsisten
cies eyes open, and justify to myself after
ward. Other times, though I conduct the
check frequently and make adjustments;
I am as susceptible as anyone to being
blind to my inconsistencies. Thank good

ness for the blunt honesty of my friends.
At yet another level, there is the point
at which we must decide whether and
how much to make the world consistent
with our views of it. It is the aggregation
of people with similar views that provides
the focal point for change. Look at the
people who are behind the California
Civil Rights Initiative. They are making
an effort to make the world consistent
with their beliefs. People who don't
believe in that particular view have to
stand up and fight for what they do
believe in. There's no complaining when
all is said and done if one did not say or,
more importantly, do anything.
In my previous columns, I often wrote
about individual actions and interactions
between small groups of people. I believe
that those are an important way to make
a difference. But beyond that, some
where between the midnight bull ses
sions in the Coffee House and the real
problems that spark those discussions lie
a multitude of potential avenues that
might lead to an improvement, and per
haps even to a viable solution. Micro
interactions and views eventually have
to lead to macro-aggregated actions. If
you believe in it, just do it.
