Abortion debate should focus on humanity of fetus

IN RESPONSE TO the ruckus created
by the 12-page anti-abortion insert in
The Daily, I'd like to direct the discus
sion to the critical issue:
Is the fetus (even the fertilized egg) a
human being?
If the answer is yes, then the unborn
child has the inherent, fundamental
human rights that all human beings have.
Abortion is then the murder of the most
innocent and defenseless human beings in
society. It is unjustifiable except when
killing the fetus is the only way to save the
mother's life. Even then, a human being of
infinite value will have been lost.
If the answer is no, then abortion is
perfectly acceptable, since a non-individu
al's non-human life is being terminated.
No human rights have been violated.
Therefore, the humanity of the unborn
conceptus is the crux of the abortion issue.
I think there is good reason to believe
in the humanity / personhood of the fetus.
I take it as obvious that unborn children
are in fact humans. It cannot possibly be
otherwise, because, according to biological
principles, humans only reproduce

humans. And since a fetus has its own set
of chromosomes different from those of its
mother, then clearly another individual
human person is present within the moth
er.
Abortion supporters use several argu
ments to contend that the unborn baby is
not a human being or "person":
1. "The fertilized egg isn't a human
being, just like a seed is not an apple."
Development makes no difference in a
person's humanity.
The human zygote is the youngest
stage of a human being, just as an apple
seed is an apple at an early stage of devel
opment. Humans pass through several
stages of development as they mature.
They are infants, toddlers, adolescents and
adults. At no time do they ever lose their
humanity. How, then, does it follow that
humans lose their humanity and rights in
the fetal stage or as a fertilized cell? Are
human rights based on age?
2. "The zygote / fetus doesn't look like a
person."
One could argue that the zygote looks
exactly like a human person does at that

stage of development. Let's answer the
question another way:
Do I forfeit my rights if my body is
shaped differently than yours? If I'm miss
ing my legs and arms or if I'm horribly
deformed? If I'm not attractive? If I'm 30
pounds? Eight pounds? a few ounces? If
body size and shape are the criterion, then
do larger people with more attractive bod
ies have more rights?
3. The fetus doesn't do what a person
like you and me can do.
Do my human rights vanish if I can't
walk, or see or even feed myself? If I'm
mentally retarded with an IQ of 1? Do
stronger and more intelligent people have
more rights than others?
4. The fetus has no human rights like
other persons because it's in the wrong
location (the womb).
Do we lose our humanity based on loca
tion?
Do I forfeit my transcendent human
rights if I'm in the wrong place geographi
cally, or anywhere else in the entire uni
verse? Why does a premature baby born in
her mother's second trimester have

human rights outside the womb but not
inside it? If it would be murder to kill this
baby outside her mother, then it is murder
to take the life of this same person at
exactly the same stage of development
inside her mother.
Do you see how ludicrous it is to base
human rights, personhood and value on
age, looks, capabilities or location? Do you
see the philosophical basis for genocide
and euthanasia movements when humani
ty is based on these factors?
Most Americans hold to the idea that
all men (and women) are created equal. In
what way are humans equal? In height? In
weight? In age? Materially? In our capabil
ities? In our "quality of life"? Of course
not. The way humans are equal are simply
because they are human. This type of
human equality is not based on physical
qualities.
Humanity and human rights begin
when egg and sperm become a fertilized
cell. That is why the fetus has a right to
life inside the womb.
