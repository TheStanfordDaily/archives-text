# Daily article on hotel boycott was inaccurate, hotel's manager says
## 
### 
This letter is in reference to an April 25
article regarding a movement to boycott
the Stanford Park Hotel.
It is astounding that The Daily would
run such an inflammatory article without
checking even the most basic facts.
The facts in the matter are:
1. There is no labor dispute at the hotel.
2. There is no "mistreatment of immi
grant workers" at the hotel.
3. There is no union organizing attempt
at the hotel.
4. There are no Stanford Park Hotel
employees involved in this activity.

5. The hotel is independently owned,
not part of a chain.
6. The National Relations Board
found merit in charges that the union
engaged in illegal secondary boycott activi
ties at the hotel.
7. The harassment campaign is being
conducted by an Oakland-based union
which does not represent any employees in
San Mateo or Santa Clara counties.
The Stanford Park Hotel has a long and
successful history of hiring and promoting
women and minorities, as is evidenced by
the number of long-term employees and
the diverse management group which
exists at the hotel.
It is unfortunate that the only nega
tive aspect of this harassment is to
potentially reduce the hours and wages
of those employees the union falsely pur
ports to represent.
