# Long Beach teacher objects to description of her middle school
## 
### 
I would like to thank The Daily for run
ning the article "College Students for a
Day"in its April 9 issue about my eighth
grade students' visit to Stanford from Long
Beach. My students got a thrill from hav
ing their picture and stoiy printed in a
newspaper. More importantly, though,
they learned a valuable lesson on approach
ing the media with a critical eye.
I had hoped that the article might dispel
some notions about students from inner-

city schools. My students are bright and
motivated and they provide an image of
inner-city students contrary to the usual
depiction in the media.
They do come from a low socio-econom
ic background and attend a school near
housing projects. This description would
have sufficed. However, by choosing to
include the sensational and irrelevant fact
that "a wall divides the school and the
housing project in order to protect students
from stray bullets," the article painted a
distorted image of the school and the stu
dents' lives and simply served to reinforce
stereotypes about inner-city schools. It's
still surprising that people will hear what
they want to hear and ignore what may
challenge their perception of the world.
