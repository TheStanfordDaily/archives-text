# Allison Amend: The better part of valor
## Too much free time? Never fear,; Webman's here! 
### 
WHEN YOUR E-MAIL inbox is
empty, your thesis/that pesky
paper turned in, Sim City or
Jeopardy no longer holding your atten
tion, then it's time. You know what I'm
talking about. It's time, ladies and gen
tlemen, to "surf the web."
Yes, that black hole of leisure time,
that cesspool of intellectuals, that
garbage disposal of leftover ideas swal
lows your time like a hungry bear com
ing out of hibernation.
The World Wide Waste of Time, as I
have heard it christened, is an alien. It
grew faster than a speeding bullet. It is
able to leap small buildings in one virtual
single bound. It's, it's . . . Webman!
Webman is the Gen X super hero.
Complete with Michelin-size spare tires
'round the midriff from too much beer
in college and ever-present coke-bottle
lensed glasses from staring glassy-eyed
into computer screens during his for
mative years, Webman knows all, does
all, experiences all.
First of all, our hero Webman is pro
ficient in that Esperanto-meets-that
clicking-African-language: HTML. Can
anyone properly identify the anagram

from which this voweless mouthful
descends? (An extra 10 points if you can
tell me what dork-who-needs-a-hobby
coined it). What happened to basic com
puter programming?
Webman is also infinitely smarter
than everyone else, bolstered as he is by
the aid of the computer chip and the
wasted efforts of home-page addicts.
Webman no longer answers, "Gee, I
dunno," Big-League Chew juice dripping
down his poorly shaven chin. He simply
surfs until he finds the answer. Or maybe
he doesn't. It matters not whether he
actually finds the answer to your ques
tion. It suffices to recognize he has the
ability to do so, without leaving his room.
Webman's friends are the diabolical
home-page owners, whose self-acclama
tion knows no bounds. I have seen family
photos, resumes, transcripts, pictures of
cars, teddy bears, even revealing pictures
of people I didn't really want to know
intimately exhibited on the web. Have
you all no shame, no decency? A guy I
know from high school shared his
father's suicide note with us. Thanks for
the upper, guys.
And who knows whose web page

you're on? What graphic you might be
floating in the back of, whose gossip link
you're starring in. Don't they have a
right to tell you, or at least share some of
the hits, linking their page back to yours?
Yeah, the web's educational. What
have you really learned on the web?
Come on now, be honest. The GNP of an
emerging third-world nation? The cor
rect spelling of joie de uiure? You've
learned that Miss April's favorite junk
food is pigs-in-a-blanket or who won the
non-televised Oscar Awards this year.
Now before you go all ballistic on me,
let me stress that my hatred of the web is
in part due to my unfamiliarity with it.
I've logged on fewer than 10 times. But
why not feel scared, frightened, actually
upset by the rapid spread of technology?
All I know is that when I returned to
the United States after a year abroad,
everyone was talking about this WWW
thing and "Friends." I figured out what
"Friends" is and assimilated it into my
life accordingly, but WWW still remained
elusive. I then returned to campus to find
my beloved library job stolen from me by
the barcoded IDs and the new computer
system. It even occupies my desk now. I

just missed the boat in the same way that
my grandmother was napping when they
invented the VCR and still has to call me
to tape Larry King Live for her.
The thought of a professor giving an
address instead of a problem set fills me
with horror. The possibility of web
travel strikes fear in my heart. Why go
on vacation when you can Experience
Rio Webside?
Ever notice how the lingo is that of
entrapment? First of all, the water
imagery: Logging on? Surfing? I expose
this demonic plan for what it is: making
us all wet. And then let's examine the
false sense of security of the home page.
Are we supposed to feel cozy here, like
we're happy we're inviting these perfect
strangers into our home, entertaining
them only to have them rape and pillage
our ideas and graphics?
And worst of all: "the web." You get
stuck in it. I mean on it. No longer is
traffic an excuse for tardiness, since
everyone's home on their computers.
"Sorry, I got stuck on the web." And
instead of the dog, we can blame the
web. "I can't turn in my homework —
the web ate it, I mean, the web was

down." And watch your step, lest you
get caught in the Interne/.
Our increasing dependence on tech
nology and unreal information will only
be detrimental to our overall health.
What is happening to the printed word?
With The New York Times on the web
and news updated hourly, what will
happen to novels, periodicals, reviews?
Hey, you'll still find me in the library —
it's air conditioned.
So let's use the web for what it is, a
tool. Don't expose yourself on it like an
over-eager teenager using a home page
instead of a training bra. Don't surf 'til
you drop, exhausted with useless infor
mation. Don't let it replace poor univer
sity students' jobs. Shrink Webman
back down to size, and worship not false
idols. Because when this whole web
thing blows over, or blows up as the
case may be, you'll be back to those
good old Marvel Comics standbys.
Superman's X-ray vision sees all the
information he needs, and Wonder
Woman never gets demagnetized.
