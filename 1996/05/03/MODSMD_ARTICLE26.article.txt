## Softball set to square off vs. best in nation Women to face No. 4 UCLA and top-ranked Washington 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
Ask any coach how the idea of facing two of
the top five teams in the country sounds and
you'll probably get the same response. The
thought is not exactly appealing, but that is pre
cisely what the Stanford softball team has to do
this weekend. The Cardinal (23-24 overall, 6-14
in the Pacific 10 Conference) faces No. 4 UCLA
today at Twin Creeks in Sunnyvale and then
travels to Washington to meet the No. 1-ranked
Huskies on Sunday.
To make matters worse, Stanford, which is
currently mired in a five-game losing streak,
wili meet the Bruins and Huskies at their peak
levels of performance. UCLA, which is 36-8
overall (15-7 Pacific 10 Conference), has won
eight straight games. Washington poses an
even bigger threat to the Cardinal. The Huskies
(44-7 overall, 15-3 Pac-10) have currently won
10 in a row, including a pair of victories over Ari
zona that allowed them to regain their No. 1
ranking.
"In thinking about the last three teams [on
the schedule], we've got a tough lineup ahead,"
said head coach Sandy Pearce. "[ In addition to
Arizona], we're playing No. 1 Washington, and
UCLA has been in the top five all year."
Team statistics show exactly why these
schools are two of the nation's best. The Bruins
and the Huskies sport the two highest batting
averages in the Pac-10 as well as the two lowest
earned run averages. As a team, UCLA is hit
ting a conference-leading .358, and Washington
is close behind with a .329 team average. By
comparison, Stanford's leading hitter is only
batting .314, while the team boasts a meager
.242 average.
Simply put, if Stanford is to win the battle it
will have to do so on the mound and in the field.
Stanford is fourth in the conference in team
ERA at 1.88, but even that may not be cause for
hope — Washington and UCLA are first and
second with 1.49 and 1.55 team ERAs, respec
tively. Moreover, Washington's Heather Meyer
is the best pitcher in the Pac-10, with a 17-2
record and the lowest ERA of any pitcher — an
astonishing 0.50. UCLA's B'Ann Burns is sec
ond with a 1.13 ERA and a 23-5 record. Stan
ford freshman Becky Blevins is right up there
as well, with a 12-9 record on the season and a
1.54 ERA.
Blevins, however, has not been in top form
since suffering an ankle injury three weeks ago.
She has only made two starts since the injury
and did not complete either of those games.
"It's been very frustrating for Becky,"
Pearce said. "It's a time thing and there's noth
ing we can do. She's not back to her old form;
we'll just have to see if she's ready this week
end."
If Blevins is not able to play, others will be
called upon to pick up the slack. Freshman
Marcy Crouch has done an excellent
job in recent games after returning
from a back injury in mid-season,
and sophomore Jessica Schulman
and junior Angela Webb could also
see some pitching time. The Cardi
nal's last three victories all came
with Crouch on the mound.

"If Becky's healthy, we're doing
great," Pearce said. "We're stronger
with her, but we're OK without her,
too. Marcy Crouch is throwing well,
and she can pitch a lot of innings for
us."
Another key factor for Stanford
will be its defense. The Cardinal
gloves have been in a tailspin lately,
coughing up 13 errors in the team's
last four games, including seven in
one outing against Arizona State.
Stanford lost that game 7-1 and will

look to regain its defensive compo
sure against UCIA and Washing
ton.
History is also against the Cardi
nal. In its three years in the Pac-10,
Stanford has never beaten either
team. But don't expect the Cardinal
to roll over and play dead for the Bru
ins or the Huskies.
"Our regional hopes are gone,"
Pearce said. "But we're not stop
ping. All year, teams have been up
setting [other teams] in the Pac-10."
