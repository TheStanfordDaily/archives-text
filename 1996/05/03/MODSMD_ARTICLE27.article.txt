# No holds barred at tomorrow's Big Meet
## Men's team looking to end 24-year drought at annual showdown vs. Cal 
### Sam Wang Contributing writer 
Twenty-four years ago, the nation sweltered in the
heat of the Watergate controversy, U.S. troops fought in
the jungles of Vietnam and Led Zeppelin was reaching the
zenith of their creative peak.
Twenty-four years ago, the Stanford men's track and
field team beat their UC-Berkeley rivals in the 78th run
ning of Big Meet.
Fast forward to 1996. Five presidents have since occu
pied the Oval Office, the Internet is as accessible as a pub
lic library and the Cardinal men are still seeking their
first dual-meet victory over Cal since 1972.
Shrugging that 24-year-old gorilla off their backs will
be the Stanford men's goal this weekend as the Stanford
track and field team heads north to Berkeley to partici
pate in the 103 rd running of Big Meet. They will stop at
nothing to achieve this purpose.
"Usually, we tiy not to double up or triple up our ath
letes in any meet," said head coach Vin Lananna. "But
this weekend, we'll put everybody where we need them
and position ourselves to beat Cal."
The winning streak has enabled Cal to open up a com
manding lead in the series, 58-31-3. The women's compe
tition, which is not quite as old as the men's, is tied at 8-8.
Last year, the Golden Bears barely eked out a victory
over Stanford, 86-77, to keep their winning streak intact.
The women's contest was even closer, with Cal edging the
Cardinal women 75-70.
"It came down to the final relay and the final leg last
year," Lananna said of the men. "It was the closest meet
we've had with Cal. This year will be no different."
For distance runner Rob Reeder, losing did not sit well,
even though he enjoyed participating in such a close and
intense straggle. However, Reeder is able to channel his
frustrations in a productive direction.
"Knowing we've lost for 24 years, it makes me angry,"
said the senior from New Jersey. "But it has affected me
in a positive way. That really serves to fire me up more
than to let me down. It makes me want to win."
The Cal men are led this year by a strong corps of hur
dlers, jumpers and vaulters, while the women have a
squad of strong sprinters and arguably the best jumpers
in the Pac-10. The Bears also have enough talent in the
other areas to make them a potent threat in a dual-meet
situation, where every event counts.
"Cal is an outstanding dual-meet team. They have
every event covered," Lananna said.
Stanford should have plenty of confidence going into
this weekend's meet against Cal based on its perfor
mances last week, when the team was scattered across
the country to compete in three separate meets.
In the prestigious Penn Relays, the Cardinal women
put their strength in the middle distance and distance
events on display for the fans.
The 4 x 1,500 meter relay team of senior Dena Dey, ju
nior Monal Chokshi, sophomore Sarna Renfro and fresh
man Mary Cobb finished a close second to Colorado with
a time of 17:38.4, the lOth-best time in Penn Relays his
tory.
The women's distance medley team of Dey, Chokshi,
Cobb and senior Monica Hoggatt then scorched the
tracks in Philadelphia with a school record-setting time of
11:14.90, good for fourth.
Reeder provided highlights in the individual competi
tion by running an NCAA qualification time of 29:48.38
in the 10,000, which translated into a solid fifth-place fin
ish.
"It didn't go quite the way I wanted to. I was shooting
for a 29:30. But it's real nice to put that NCAA provision
al time in the bank," Reeder said.

Freshman Mary Cobb led the women's distance medley team to a school record-setting time of 11:14.90 at last
weekend's Penn Relays. Tomorrow she will lead the Cardinal women into battle at the annual Big Meet.
team of freshman Jake Maas,
sophomore Jon Weldon and juniors
Jason Lunn and Tad I leath came in
fourth.
At the same time, junior Jimmie
Johnson ran a season-best 21.14 in
the 200-meter sprint at the Cal /
Nevada Track and Field Champi
onships at UC-Davis.
Last weekend's performance,
paired with the return of football
players from spring practice,
should b .ve the team plenty of mo
mentum.
"This is a very meaningful meet
for both teams, so they'll pull out all
their guns and all their stops,"
said. "Both meets will be
close. I predict that 10 points will
separate both teams."
For the seniors on the men's
team, this weekend represents
their final shot at finally breaking
the hex that the Cal men have exer
cised over the Cardinal for over two
decades.
"Every year after they beat us,
they get the team together and they
run a victory lap," Reeder said. "I
didn't like that.
"It'd do me real proud if we're
able to go out and win this thing."
