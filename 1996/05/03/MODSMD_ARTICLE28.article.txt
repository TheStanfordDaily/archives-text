# Nine-game winning streak on the line against California in conference finale
## Sluggers look to finish strong in Six-Pac 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
In its final Pacific 10 Conference Southern Di
vision series of the year, the 12th-ranked Stan
ford baseball team will have plenty of incentive to
win when it faces Bay Area rival California (27-26
overall, 10-17 in the Six-Pac) today through Sun
day.
For starters, the Cardinal (32-17, 16-11 Six-
Pac) is riding a season-high nine-game winning
streak which includes conference sweeps of Ari
zona and UCLA. Stanford enters weekend play
tied for second place in the Six-Pac with the Bru
ins; UCLA faces off against league champion USC
this weekend in a three-game set.
The difference between second and third place
in the conference could be the chance to host an
NCAA regional tournament at Stanford's Sunken
Diamond. Many of the Cardinal players believe
second place may be good enough to secure a re
gional, while third place would make that possi
bility a longshot.
Stanford will also be trying to help its skipper,
Mark Marquess, to another coaching milestone.
Marquess, who is in his 20th season on the Farm,
is one victory away from the 800-win mark. The
winningest coach in Stanford history, Marquess
has a 799-431-4 career mark (.650), including a
record of 328-245 (.572) in Six-Pac competition.
The 1969 Stanford graduate has been named
NCAA Coach of the Year three times (1985, 1987
and 1988), Pac-10 South Coach of the Year five
times (1983,1985,1987,1990 and 1994) and also
led the United States to the gold medal at the 1988
Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
Leading the Cardinal on the field will be senior
catcher A.J. Hinch, who is tops on the club in sev
eral offensive categories, including batting aver
age (.398), home runs (11) and runs batted in (49).
The All-American's previous career highs were a
.366 average, nine home runs and 58 RBIs, all set
in 1995.
Other hot hitters for Stanford are first base
man Luke Quaccia (.385), right fielder Joe Kil
burg (.365, 35 RBIs), designated hitter Jon Scha
effer (nine HR, 37 RBIs) and second baseman
Brian Dallimore (.337, 32 RBIs). Dallimore was
recently invited to Team USA's training camp
this summer, where he will join Hinch, who has

already been named to the 1996
Olympic Team.
On the mound, the Cardinal
pitching staff looks to continue
its recent success, led by sopho
more hurler Kyle Peterson. Pe
terson picked up Pac-10 South
Pitcher of the Week honors last
week after pitching a complete
game, four-hit shutout against
UCLA last Friday night at

Sunken Diamond. The right-ban
der struck out six and walked just
one batter in notching his sev
enth win of the season and fifth in
Pac-10 play. The Pitcher of the
Week honors are the fifth earned
by Peterson, who received the
honor four times during his
freshman campaign.
Freshman starters Chad
Hutchinson and Jeff Austin have
also been throwing the ball well as
of late. Hutchinson (6-1) has be
come comfortable in the starting
role and has not lost a decision
since Feb. 13. The Del Mar, Calif,

native has tallied 55 strikeouts in
67 1/3 innings and picked up the
win in Stanford's 10-8 victory over
UCLA Saturday. Austin, who has
been a starter all year, also collect
ed a win over the Bruins in the
Cardinal's 6-4 triumph on Sun
day.
Stanford and Cal entered the
1996 season ranked No. 2 and No.
5, respectively, but the Bears have
been plagued by injuries all year
long and sit in fifth place in the
league standings. The series rep
resents the final conference com
petition for both teams.
