### Erin Bryla Contributing writer 
With the national champi
onship tournament less than
one week away, the women's
water polo team will have one
more opportunity to hone its
skills this weekend at the Pacific
Coast Championships in Berke
ley.
For once, the Cardinal will
not face the same teams it has all
season â€” the Pacific Coast
Championships are a club tour

nament, not a college tourna
ment, although there will be col
lege teams represented.
Three other teams will share
a bracket with the Cardinal. The
women's first game is today at 3
p.m. against Cal Open, with
their second contest slated for
tomorrow morning against
Marin A- That game will be fol
lowed by a 12:50 p.m. matchup
against Chelamen.
