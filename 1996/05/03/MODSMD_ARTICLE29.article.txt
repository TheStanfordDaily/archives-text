# Women's water polo heads up to Berkeley
## 
### Erin Bryla Contributing writer 
With the national champi
onship tournament less than
one week away, the women's
water polo team will have one
more opportunity to hone its
skills this weekend at the Pacific
Coast Championships in Berke
ley.
For once, the Cardinal will
not face the same teams it has all
season — the Pacific Coast
Championships are a club tour

nament, not a college tourna
ment, although there will be col
lege teams represented.
Three other teams will share
a bracket with the Cardinal. The
women's first game is today at 3
p.m. against Cal Open, with
their second contest slated for
tomorrow morning against
Marin A- That game will be fol
lowed by a 12:50 p.m. matchup
against Chelamen.
The Cardinal's opponents
this weekend will probably not pro
vide the same caliber of competi
tion as the likes of the UCLA, UC-
Davis and Cal — teams that the
Stanford women have been going
up against all season. The winner
of the Cardinal's bracket will go on
to the tournament semifinals.

this is a good chance
to give everybody
some playing time.'

onships will provide Stanford with
a couple of good opportunities, the
first of which is to get the Cardinal
bench some quality playing time. It
was this bench that kept Stanford
in the game against San Diego
State in a 8-7 overtime loss last

weekend in the semifinals of the
national qualifier tournament.
This weekend's games will also
give some key players a valuable
opportunity to get rested, as the
team's grueling 50-game schedule
finally begins to take its toll on the
young Card.
"This weekend [is] pretty much
a club championship, but this is a
good chance to give everybody
some playing time," said head
coach Hen Quittner.
While the Stanford women will
be concentrating their efforts on
the Pacific Coast Championships,
they are nonetheless keeping an
eye on nationals. The Cardinal's
fourth-place finish at the qualifier
last weekend has the team poised
to move in on some of the nation's
top-ranked teams when the nation
al championships kick off one week
from today at UC-Davis.
The Stanford women are excited
about the chance to avenge last
weekend's San Diego State loss,
but they know that the real team to
beat at nationals is top-ranked
UCLA. The Bruins lost their only
game of the season last weekend at
the qualifier, where they were
downed by Cal. A team which was
thought to be in a league of its own
could actually be within reach of
the Cardinal and the rest of the
tournament field.
