Senate yesterday,
senate members
questioned why
the University is

increasing spending on University
buildings while cutting academic
programs.
"I am often asked how, if the
faculty isn't growing and the stu
dent body isn't growing, why do
we need so many new buildings?"
Rice said.
Rice said reductions for acade
mic programs have been in equip
ment and in administrative staff.
Meanwhile, Rice said, faculty
salary programs have been left ro
bust over the past three years to
keep up with competitive schools.
"We have made additional
[budget] allocations for faculty,"
Rice said.
Over the past three years, the
University has cut $16.8 million
from its budget. Due to unexpect

go to upgrading existing buildings,
as with seismic upgrades, and
some aid new growth, such as con

neering Quad and the new clinical
sciences building.
The seismic upgrades are also
providing a form of insurance
against another earthquake,
Casper said.
Rice also stressed that the Uni
versity has gone from running a
$40 million deficit to holding a $ 15
million reserve in the past five
years.
"This is something the entire
University should be proud of,"
Rice said.
"Because we project income 18
months in advance, we have lived
pretty close to the line," she added.
"Now we are taking some percent
age off the top and holding it in re
serves."
Rice said one of the goals for the
future is to try to maintain the
newly accumulated reserves
against income shortfall. Accord
