# Fac Sen reviews Rice budget plan
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
After Provost
Condoleezza Rice
presented the
University bud
get to the Faculty
Senate yesterday,
senate members
questioned why
the University is

increasing spending on University
buildings while cutting academic
programs.
"I am often asked how, if the
faculty isn't growing and the stu
dent body isn't growing, why do
we need so many new buildings?"
Rice said.
Rice said reductions for acade
mic programs have been in equip
ment and in administrative staff.
Meanwhile, Rice said, faculty
salary programs have been left ro
bust over the past three years to
keep up with competitive schools.
"We have made additional
[budget] allocations for faculty,"
Rice said.
Over the past three years, the
University has cut $16.8 million
from its budget. Due to unexpect
ed revenue, this year it was only
necessary to cut $3.1 million, less
than the $7 million originally tar
geted.
Rice said because the nature of
science has changed, some al
ready-existing buildings are inad

equate for research and classes.
She said it is often less expensive
to tear down and rebuild a build
ing than remodel.
University President Gerhard
Casper added that the cost of seis
mic repairs has reached $150 mil
lion. He said some of these funds
go to upgrading existing buildings,
as with seismic upgrades, and
some aid new growth, such as con
struction of the Science and Engi
neering Quad and the new clinical
sciences building.
The seismic upgrades are also
providing a form of insurance
against another earthquake,
Casper said.
Rice also stressed that the Uni
versity has gone from running a
$40 million deficit to holding a $ 15
million reserve in the past five
years.
"This is something the entire
University should be proud of,"
Rice said.
"Because we project income 18
months in advance, we have lived
pretty close to the line," she added.
"Now we are taking some percent
age off the top and holding it in re
serves."
Rice said one of the goals for the
future is to try to maintain the
newly accumulated reserves
against income shortfall. Accord
ing to Rice, a 0.5 percent increase
in endowment payout promised by

the Board of Trustees will be used
to cover infrastructure costs.
With University spending on
graduate student tuition remis
sion beginning in 1998, Rice said
"the challenge to the University
will be great."
Rice said revenues have not
changed significantly over the
past three years, and outsourcing
— contracting tasks to firms out
side the University — has helped
to achieve cost savings. Together,
$1.6 million has been saved by out
sourcing the legal office and the
copy center, Rice said. The Stan
ford Management Company,

which contracts out the retail op
erations in Tresidder Union, has
reduced the University's deficit bv
$300,000.
The senate also discussed
changes in the professoriate. Sig
nificant changes in faculty demo
graphics included the hiring of
more female faculty and more
Asian and Asian-American facul
ty.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, vice
provost for faculty recruitment
and development, said the increas
ing diversity of faculty was not a
product of affirmative action.
"One hopes that the natural
rate of diversity is due to nondis
criminatory policies, and affir
mative action is only necessary
because that is not fast enough,"
he said.
