# One Moment in Time
## 
### 
The relay rounds its way off El ('amino
Real, the Torch cuts across Campus
Drive, and just like that, the Flame con
fronts the Farm. From every nook and cranny
and early morning class, the undergrads grav
itate and the masses amass. To brush the
fame of the torch's flame and touch the story
of its Olympic glory. To he close to it all for at
least one moment in time.
Who wouldn't want t<> dream the impossi
ble Olympic Dream? Especially here. Hey, this
is Stanford, and if you're not an Olympic
medalist yourself, then at the very least
you've probably had CIV section with one, or
two. (I mean, you do realize that if Stanford
were it's own country, we'd rank 17th inter
nationally in total bollards.)
"Dude, if they asked me, I would, like,
totally run with the torch," said one fervid
friend of mine. "And I don't even run!"
Yes, the excitement is everywhere.
Therefore, it's a little ironic (don't ya
think?) that in some ways, watching the
Olympics can be a lot like . . . like being alone
at Christmas- Hanukkah- Kwanzaa-time.
Disheartening, discouraging, downright dis
combobulating. At least for me.
After all. the Olympic (lames, the XXVIth
Olympiad, that centennial celebration of the
triumph of the human spirit, that magical
month where the nations of the world cast
aside political contentions (unless they're boy
cotting) for a cleansing communion of compe
tition — it's all just one more reminder that
I'm trettiult older.

Older, and no more talented. And at an age
and a time when one is trying desperately to
figure out what to do with one's life, it doesn't
help to be reminded of what others much
younger have already done with theirs
You see, before the summer's out, some lit
tle 12-year-old gymnast from a former War
saw Pact country is going to bring home a
medal worth more than I'm going to be mak
ing anytime soon. Some triumphant teen-ager
will earn the honor and adoration of his proud
nation, and I'll realize that my stats professor
doesn't even know my name. Some pubescent
hot shot will shatter the world record in the
pole vault, and I'll be reminded that I can't
even drive stick.
Last fall, when I hit the big Blackjack, I
realized that I'd finally passed even major
milestone between here and senior discounts
— except maybe for the chance to rent a car
on my own (when I'm 25, I think). What that
really means is that its just about too late for
me to do anything before my time. Too old to
be a child prodigy. Too old to be tried as a
minor. Almost too old to leave school early
for the NBA. And as time marches on,
there'll be plenty more to not celebrate. Hell,
in seven years, I'll be 10 years past my sexu
al peak.
Now, wait. Please don't get me wrong.
Please don't use this lexical litter to paint
your whole picture of me: A future image of
some ill-natured octogenarian, pouting all day
on the porch, bitter that his Social Security
ran out .'5O vears earlier and that some voung

whipper-snapper 20 \ears his junior is runnin
tht' whole durn country.
That's not mt 1 . That's not the message.
That's not what I'm trying to say here. In
pointing out the underside of the Olympic
spirit. I don't mean to rain on anybody's
()pening Ceremony.
Don't worn if I watch the Olympics this
summer, I'll do so with an open mind. I'll
watch that 12-year-old do the hoot-scootin
hoogie on the balance beam. I'll watch some
high jumper jump really, really high And I'll
smile and sa\ to imself. "Wow! I couldn t do
that!"
And 1 wouldn't want to. but the point is, 1
couldn't. And then I'll realize that there's
something cool about that. Something inspir
ing. They tried, and they succeeded. And
maybe that's why I pulled my butt out of bed
to see the torch.
If anything, I'm realizing that inspiration
works in mysterious ways. And getting bitter
is no substitute for gott ing bettor
Even il it is twice as much fun.
