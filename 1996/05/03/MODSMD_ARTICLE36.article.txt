# Students will deliver aid to Bosnia
## Volunteers from Stanford join international effort of "Miles To Go" 
### Shoshana Deutschkron Contributing writer 
Members of a new Stanford student group
will travel to Bosnia this August to participate
in a humanitarian aid convoy.
The eight or so students taking part in the
month-long trip belong to the Stanford chap
ter of the international organization, "Miles to
Go. . which is sponsoring the convoy.
The volunteers plan to distribute more than
9 tons of medical supplies to hospitals in Sara
jevo and Mostar in addition to providing hu
manitarian services.
Stanford student volunteers will travel
along with other "Miles to Go. .." members
from UC-Berkeley, Oxford University and
Brown University. They plan to live in differ
ent refugee camps throughout their stay,
spending about a week in each camp. While in
the camps, volunteers will help redevelop the
area by handing out provisions and interacting
with the people.
Sophomore Melvina Cheung, president of
the Stanford chapter, and freshman Liz Chien,
financial and fund-raising chair, emphasized
the importance of the group's planned interac
tion between volunteers and inhabitants of the
refugee camps.
According to Chien, "It is easv for bier hu-

manitarian organizations to just go in and
give. One of our purposes is to go in and work
with them, one on one. We want to talk to the
women, teen-agers and children to gain a bet
ter understanding of what they have experi
enced and help with the healing process."
One of the Stanford volunteers, doctoral
student Sonja Kuftinec, plans to create an in
teractive theater production with Bosnian
refugees. Kuftinec developed a similar produc
tion last summer with refugees in Croatia.
The goal of the theater program, she said, is
"to encourage both Stanford students and
Bosnians to work together, to explore and to
express their identities."
Stanford volunteers said an added benefit of
the convoy's one-on-one emphasis is that it
will minimize corruption.
The volunteers "will hand carry each box of
medical supplies to make sure that the doctors
and nurses actually get them. There is lots of
corruption at the border when supplies are
sent in by truckload and it is the people who
suffer," Cheung said.
"Miles to Go. .." was founded almost two
years ago by John Randazzo, Class of'9s. Ran
dazzo, who was studying at Stanford-in-Ox
ford, used a fellowship from the Haas Center
for Public Service to participate in his first re
lief convov.

Student relief convoys to Bosnia have been
conducted for four years now, with Randazzo
participating in the last three. This year, how
ever, is the first year that a substantial number
of Stanford students will be participate in the
convoy.
Randazzo began "Miles to Go. . ."as a polit
ically neutral, certified tax-exempt organiza
tion committed to ideals of non-violence in the
midst of a conflict fueled by ethnic and reli
gious divisions. The group, says Randazzo, is
"dedicated to impro- ng the quality of life of
those that have been affected by the war in the
former Yugoslavia through initiating and co
ordinating diverse actions throughout the
world."
Chapters of "Miles to Go. . in addition to
the newly formed Stanford chapter, now exist
at Oxford University, the University of Ver
mont, UC-Berkeley and Cornell University.
According to Randazzo, the Stanford chap
ter was founded due to "considerable interest
from students."
In the future, Randazzo said the organiza
tion "hopes to expand operations to two addi
tional countries in the developing world and
increase [its] presence among students at
other universities."
The Stanford chapter meets Tuesdays at
8:30 p.m. in the Women's Center.
