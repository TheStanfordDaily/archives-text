# Baker's yeast: a story of bread and genetic science
## Focus on Science 
### Yvette Delahoussaye Contributing writer 
Researchers around the world, including
a group at the Medical Center, released the
complete DNA sequence of baker's yeast
last week. This is the first complete se
quencing of an organism with DNA that is
closely related to human DNA.
Most people think of yeast as just a mi

crobe used in the production of beer, wine
and bread. However, humans and yeast are
actually closely related.
"There are many examples of biological
processes that work the same in both or
ganisms," Biochemistry Prof. Ronald Davis
said in a statement. Davis, who directs the
Stanford DNA Sequencing and Technology
Center, was part of a worldwide collabora
tion that worked on sequencing the yeast
DNA over the past few years.
Both human and yeast are eukaryotic,
meaning that their cells have nuclei which

contain the genetic material. Bacteria are
prokaryotic organisms and do not have the
nuclei to hold their DNA. Instead, DNA is
found throughout the cell.
"Knowing the DNA sequence is impor
tant to understanding basic biological
processes, such as metabolism and cell
replication," said researcher J. Michael
Cherry, head of the Genome Databases
Group in the Genetics Department.
DNA can be thought of as a necklace fold
ed up and packed into the nucleus. There
are four kinds of "beads," or nucleotide

bases, on the DNA string. The specific order
of nucleotides codes for specific amino acids,
which are the building blocks of proteins.
Each gene codes for an individual protein.
The amino acids must be strung together
in just the right sequence to form function
al proteins. Any defect in the DNA could ul
timately lead to a defective protein. This is
the baStSof genetic diseases, Cherry said.
"The push to sequence the yeast gene
will benefit the ongoing Human Genome
Project, whose completion date is
thought to be the year 2003," said
Cherry. "A lot of money and re
sources went into developing bet
ter technology. The result is that
there are many labs now with the
training and the equipment to do
sequencing and that will help
speed up the human gene project."
The project seeks to map out DNA
sequencing on all of the human
genes.
The yeast sequencing project
began in 1989 but did not gain
much attention until 1992, when
scientists announced the se
quence of an entire yeast chromo
some. It was the first time the se
quence of an entire eukaryotic
chromosome had been made ac
cessible. The rush was on to se
quence the entire genome.
Now that the sequence of the
12.5 million bases that make up
the six chromosomes of the yeast
genome is known, researchers
may have to change their ap
proach. Only a decade ago, a grad

uate student could get a doctorate
by cloning and sequencing an indi
vidual gene. Now the sequence for
any gene can quickly be located.
Researchers instead focus on what
role that gene plays in a biological
process.

'The result is that
there are many labs
now with the train
ing and the equip
ment to do se
quencing and that
will help speed up
the human gene
project.'

As an additional bonus, many
genes known to be important in
human processes, such as signal
ing and cell division, have coun

terparts in yeast, said Cherry.
Studying the function of the gene
in yeast can provide important
clues about its behavior in hu
mans.
Researchers such as Jon Bink
ley, a graduate student in genet
ics, readily acknowledge that hav
ing the gene sequence will make it
easier to physically locate genes on
the yeast chromosome. With this
knowledge, it is possible to locate
mutations which can lead to dis
ease.
But the real challenge still lies
ahead, according to Cherry. "Of
the 6,000 genes in yeast, we have
identified and characterized on
some level about one-third of
them. Another third of the genes
have similarity to genes in an
other organism, and the final
third have never been seen be
fore."

ing a search against the complete
yeast genome, go to the Saccha
romyces Genome Database, which
contains all you ever wanted to
know about yeast but were afraid to
ask. It is located on the World Wide
