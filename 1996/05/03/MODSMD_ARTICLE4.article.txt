# Baker's yeast: a story of bread and genetic science
## Focus on Science

Researchers around the world, including
a group at the Medical Center, released the
complete DNA sequence of baker's yeast
last week. This is the first complete se
quencing of an organism with DNA that is
closely related to human DNA.
Most people think of yeast as just a mi

crobe used in the production of beer, wine
and bread. However, humans and yeast are
actually closely related.
"There are many examples of biological
processes that work the same in both or
ganisms," Biochemistry Prof. Ronald Davis
said in a statement. Davis, who directs the
Stanford DNA Sequencing and Technology
Center, was part of a worldwide collabora
tion that worked on sequencing the yeast
DNA over the past few years.
Both human and yeast are eukaryotic,
meaning that their cells have nuclei which

contain the genetic material. Bacteria are
prokaryotic organisms and do not have the
nuclei to hold their DNA. Instead, DNA is
found throughout the cell.
"Knowing the DNA sequence is impor
tant to understanding basic biological
processes, such as metabolism and cell
replication," said researcher J. Michael
Cherry, head of the Genome Databases
Group in the Genetics Department.
DNA can be thought of as a necklace fold
ed up and packed into the nucleus. There
are four kinds of "beads," or nucleotide

bases, on the DNA string. The specific order
of nucleotides codes for specific amino acids,
which are the building blocks of proteins.
Each gene codes for an individual protein.
The amino acids must be strung together
in just the right sequence to form function
al proteins. Any defect in the DNA could ul
timately lead to a defective protein. This is
the baStSof genetic diseases, Cherry said.
"The push to sequence the yeast gene
will benefit the ongoing Human Genome
