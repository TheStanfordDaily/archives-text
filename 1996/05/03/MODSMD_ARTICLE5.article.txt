## Graduate student dies of lung cancer 
### Kelly E. Young 
John Pickett, a doctoral candidate
in the Classics Department, died April
20 of terminal lung cancer diagnosed
five months ago. He was 36. Doctors
had given him four to six months to
live.
Those closest to him remembered
him for the strength he showed
through his illness.
"I think most of all I'll remember
him for his personal style," said Susan
Stephens, chair of the Classics Depart
ment. "He was a man of great integrity
and great courage in the face of his ill
ness. He was always dealt with it with
out self-pity. He was someone we were
all very fond of and respected for his
commitment and energy."
He was also remembered for his

lighthearted sense of humor.
"Every person who knows him will
remember his sense of humor," said

Christine Shockman, a
friend of the Picketts.
"He was a witty, clever
fellow."
Pickett was born Nov.
25,1959. He married his
wife Patricia in 1980 and
had two children, lan,
16, and Catherine, 8.
In 1987, Pickett was
in a management posi
tion as interim city

archivist in Portland, Ore. He was of
fered the position of city archivist for
Portland but chose instead to enter
Reed College. He balanced his time be
tween being a student, father, husband
and paralegal. He earned a bachelor's

degree in classics from Reed in 1991.
Upon graduating, Pickett worked as
a full-time legal assistant in a large
Portland law firm. He enrolled at Stan
ford as a graduate student in August
1994, intending to become a historian
after graduation.
According to Stephens, Pickett was
always a family man. After his diagno
sis, he and his wife, Patricia, decided to
renew their wedding vows on March 9
in celebration of their 16th wedding
anniversary.
"[They] renewed their marriage
vows here in Memorial Chapel before
they went back home to Portland," said
Alicia Sanchez, who knew Pickett
through the Classics Department. "It
was a very touching ceremony that we


Pickett
felt very privileged to witness."
Friends said Pickett's family
gave him a great deal of support.
At one time during his illness, Pa
tricia Pickett carried five jobs at
once.
The Picketts also witnessed

the kindness of their friends, who
helped organize a highly publi
cized campaign to raise money for
the family. The Stanford Book
store, Round Table Pizza and the
Stanford Federal Credit Union
also became involved in the
event.
By April 3, $7,000 had been
raised to defray medical costs. As
of Saturday, 202 vouchers for
Hound Table Pizza, worth $3,100,

had been sold at the Bookstore.
The Bookstore will continue sell
ing these vouchers through the
end of May.
A small memorial service was
held for Pickett at Escondido Vil
lage.
"We just took candles out and
prayed," Shockman said. "John's
personal wish was that we'd have
a party, so we're trying to get
things organized for that."
