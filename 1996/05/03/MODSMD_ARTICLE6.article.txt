The Hoover Institution named 12
scholars for its 1996-97 National Fel
lows Program, including three Stan
ford professors.
"I think it's one of the premier fel
lowship programs in the country," said
Thomas Henriksen, a senior fellow at
Hoover and the program's executive
secretary.
The fellowship allows non-tenured
junior scholars to spend one year at
Hoover to conduct original indepen
dent research on public policy issues.
During this time, they are free from
their other academic responsibilities.
"You look forward to being able to do
the research," said Asst. Economics
Prof. Charles Jones, one of the recipi
ents of the fellowship. "This gives you
the opportunity to do that full-time."
Asst. Political Science Prof. Kurt
Gaubatz, another recipient, echoed his

colleague's sentiments. For junior fac
ulty, he said, "It's a great opportunity
when they really need the time to get
the research work done."
Jones' work will try to formally ex
plain why many industrialized
economies have failed to see improve
ments in per capita income since World
War II despite favorable increases in in
vestment and other factors since that
time. He will also examine the role of
technology transfer between countries.
Meanwhile, Gaubatz said he will
study "how politicians make tradeoffs
... between international incentives
and domestic incentives." His research
will focus mostly on democratic coun
tries, since their openness makes them
easier to study, he said.
The third Stanford faculty member,
Jeffrey Zwiebel, an associate professor
of finance at the Graduate School of
Business, was unavailable for com
ment.
The competition for the fellowships

is intense. Fellows must be nominated
by leading scholars in the United
States.
After the nomination process, the
field is whittled down by self-selection,
as nominees are asked to submit appli
cations.
"Only the best and brightest really
try," Henriksen said.
"A great deal of review goes into [the
selection process]," Henriksen said.
The selection committee pays careful
attention to the quality of the appli
cant's research proposal, his or her
track record in terms of publication
and recommendations from senior
scholars. This year, the committee con
sidered about 80 applicants for the 12
spaces, Henriksen said.
Both Jones and Gaubatz empha
sized the importance of being able to in
teract with other leading scholars at
Hoover and with other National Fel-
lows.
"The people are the key re
source," Jones said.
The scholars at Hoover also
benefit from this interaction,
Henriksen said. "It's a way to stay
up with their ideas so that we
don't become insular," he said.
Over the last two decades, the
program has awarded more than
300 fellowships to junior scholars
from American and Canadian uni
versities. Since the program's in
ception in 1971, Stanford faculty
members have received more than
10 percent of the awards.
In addition to the three Stanford
professors chosen this year, two
other recipients — Aaron Edlin, an

assistant professor of economics at
UC-Berkeley, and Masaru Kohno,
an assistant professor of political
science at the University of British
Columbia — earned their doctor
ates at Stanford.
The other recipients were:
Michael Boozer, assistant profes
sor of economics at Yale Universi
ty; Yi Feng, assistant professor of
political science at Claremont
Graduate School; Thomas
Lemieux, associate professor of
economics at the University of
Montreal; John Londregan, assis
tant professor of politics at Prince
ton University; Robin Lumsdaine,
assistant professor of economics
at Princeton; John Vincent Nye,
associate professor of economics
at Washington University; and
Steven Solnick, assistant profes
sor of political science at Columbia
University.
