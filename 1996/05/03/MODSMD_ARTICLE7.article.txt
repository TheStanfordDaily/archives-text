# Not quite a fistful of dollars
## College students often find personal finance confusing

Credit card balances. Student loans.
Phone bills. Bookstore prices. Financial
concerns such as these often overwhelm
Stanford students.
Robin Goldenberg, a junior majoring in
human biology, grimaced when thinking
about finances. "I wish I had more of
them," she said.
Goldenberg admitted that working this
year in the Jonsson Government Docu
ments Library has definitely helped to
cover her books, clothes and gasoline. Still,
paying for everything can get extremely ex
pensive.

Adrienne Osborn, a senior majoring in
Science, Technology and Society, faces a
similar problem. Although Osborn works
for Chromatic Research, she finds it diffi
cult to cover all of her expenses, which in
clude an estimated $200 monthly gas bill
due to her participation in the Stanford Wa
terski Club.
Goldenberg and Osborn aren't alone in
their financial worries. In a recent Census
Bureau poll, people between the ages of 25
and 34 earn, in constant dollars, about 20 per
cent less than their counterparts in the 19705.
With expenses rising and payrolls decreasing,
many students feel like they are being sucked
