# Not quite a fistful of dollars
## College students often find personal finance confusing 
### Allison Otto Contributing writer 
Credit card balances. Student loans.
Phone bills. Bookstore prices. Financial
concerns such as these often overwhelm
Stanford students.
Robin Goldenberg, a junior majoring in
human biology, grimaced when thinking
about finances. "I wish I had more of
them," she said.
Goldenberg admitted that working this
year in the Jonsson Government Docu
ments Library has definitely helped to
cover her books, clothes and gasoline. Still,
paying for everything can get extremely ex
pensive.

Adrienne Osborn, a senior majoring in
Science, Technology and Society, faces a
similar problem. Although Osborn works
for Chromatic Research, she finds it diffi
cult to cover all of her expenses, which in
clude an estimated $200 monthly gas bill
due to her participation in the Stanford Wa
terski Club.
Goldenberg and Osborn aren't alone in
their financial worries. In a recent Census
Bureau poll, people between the ages of 25
and 34 earn, in constant dollars, about 20 per
cent less than their counterparts in the 19705.
With expenses rising and payrolls decreasing,
many students feel like they are being sucked

into a financial black hole.
Beth Kobliner, author of "Get
A Financial Life: Personal Fi
nance in Your Twenties and Thir
ties," believes that knowledge of
the financial world is essential to
a successful career.
As a financial analyst, Koblin
er has found herself bombarded in
the workplace and at parties with
financial questions from her
friends and colleagues.
"My friends and people my age
would be asking me advice,"

Kobliner said.
Consequently, she wanted to
write a financial book that would
provide "clear, concise informa
tion for young people."
According to Kobliner, many
young people today are clueless
when it comes to finances.
"You can easily get through col
lege and know nothing about
money management," Kobliner
said.
In her book, Kobliner offers a
number of financial tips.
"The big mistake is carrying
lots of credit card debt," Kobliner
said.
For example, if a student pays
only the minimum amount re

quired on a $1,000 credit card
debt, within 20 years the card will
have accumulated $2,000 in inter
est, in addition to the original
$1,000 the student owed.
"They shouldn't feel bad about
[credit card debt]," Kobliner said.
"The good news is you're really
young. You're at a good stage in
your life to fix any credit prob
lems."
Kobliner also suggested living
with roommates after college in
order to split the costs, enrolling
in an automatic savings plan in
order for a portion of one's pay
check to be immediately deposited
in the bank and spending "no
more than 30 percent on rent."
