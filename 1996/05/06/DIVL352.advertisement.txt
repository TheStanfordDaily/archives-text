I know what you're
thinking. What does a fish know,
r right? Well, I may not know much, but I do keep i
my ears open. Like just the other day. I overheard a
couple of students talking. Found out that Apple is offering
incredibly low campus prices on Macintosh computers. Found
out that a Mac is a really easy way to get up and running on

using a Mac to share ideas on the Internet than any
l other computer. Boy, what I would give to get a
out of this stupid castle and
start surfing the Net.
