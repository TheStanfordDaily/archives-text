Olympic spirit swept
through Stanford early Friday
morning when the torch came
to campus.
Hundreds of students and
members of surrounding com
munities cheered as the
Olympic flame traveled up
Galvez Street onto Serra Street
and down Palm Drive to Ar
boretum Road.
In the hands of Gloria Burns,
principal of Willow Glen Ele
mentary School in San Jose, the
Olympic flame made its way to
the front of Hoover Tower for a
brief ceremony featuring seven
Olympic participants.
With the burning torch in
front of them, the Olympians
thanked the audience for their
support, and each gave a brief
speech on their Olympic aspira
tions.
"Thank you for sharing and
helping to make this a great
Olympics," said Skip Kenney,
men's swimming coach for both
the Stanford team and the U.S.
Olympic team. "Thank you for
combining the greatest univer
sity with the greatest Olympics
ever."
The crowd gave a final round
of applause to the Olympians as
the torch was passed on to Chris
Dorst, two-time Olympic water
polo player and Stanford alum
nus. While some members of
the audience followed the
Olympic flame up Serra Street,
others lingered behind to seize
the opportunity to touch the
Olympic ember and talk to the
Olympic athletes.
Stanford athletes at the cere
mony participating in this
year's Olympics included Stan
ford swimmers Kurt Grote, Jeff
Rouse, Ray Carey and Lisa
Jacob and Stanford baseball
catcher A.J. Hinch. Stanford
gymnast Jair Lynch, a hopeful
for the games, was also present.
Looking over the large
crowd, Cheryl Levick, senior as
sociate athletic director, ex
pressed appreciation for the
support of students and mem
bers of the community.
"To see this kind of support
from their community meant a
lot to the athletes," said Levick.
"We certainly knew there would
be a lot of security and protocol.
What we didn't anticipate was
this large turnout of students
and the community. I was
touched."
"It was the first time I truly
realized the magnitude of the
support we have. The Olympics
are going to be more exciting
than anything I've ever done
before," said senior Carey, who
will represent the United States
in the men's 200-meter butter
fly competition.
Hinch, a senior expected to
be the starting catcher for the
U.S. team, agreed. "This was
the first time I felt the Olympics
were a reality," he said. "This is
the start of an exciting Olympic
summer."
No one else could have been
more excited for the torch and
the Stanford Olympians than
fellow students.
"I skipped Engineering 20 to

freshman living in Larkin. Twen
ty-nine Larkin residents provided
lemonade to fellow Olympic sup
porters as they waited for the
torch to arrive. "We want to help
the community merge to support
our athletes," said Gurkok.
"How often do you get to see
the torch right on campus?" asked
junior Greg Shelby, as he craned
his neck for a better look from his
first-row seat in front of Tanner
Fountain.
"It's really exciting to see a part
of the Olympics at Stanford," said
sophomore swimmer Thomas
Wilkens. "This is the first time for
me to see my teammates as
Olympians. It's cool seeing all the
Stanford people and the big crowd
that's here fired up about them."
Stanford athletes are not the
only students who will participate
in this year's Olympic Games —
the Talisman a cappella group will
sing in the Olympic village this
summer.
"I can't wait to be there," said
freshman Rishi Garg, a member of
Talisman. "Singing there for
these Olympians is going to be the
greatest thing ever."
Freshman Cryztal Parra was
one of many who lingered behind
after the ceremony to enjoy the
Olympic spirit. "The Olympics are
going to be great," said Parra,
watching the Olympic athletes
play with ecstatic Willow Glen
schoolchildren.
