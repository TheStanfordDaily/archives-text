# Violent crime down 4 percent
## Increase in larceny predicts upcoming surge in youth crimes 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Violent crime
dropped 4 percent last year as overall seri
ous offenses reported to police declined for
the fourth straight year. But one expert
said a slight increase in larceny foreshad
ows a surge in youth crime.
Reporting yesterday on preliminary
data for 1995, the FBI said the overall total
for seven major crimes was down 2 percent
from 1994. Overall reported crime was
down in every region, led by a 4 percent
decline in the Northeast.
Scholars, law enforcement officers and
Democratic and Republican members of
Congress hailed the data but unanimously
warned that the large national trends
mask an alarming rise in teen-age violence.
"We shouldn't be lulled into a false
sense of security," said Rep. Bill McCol
lum, R-Fla., chairman of the House crime
subcommittee.
Attorney General Janet Reno pledged
to "continue to put more cops on the beat,
get guns off the street and put violent
criminals behind bars."
In cities of more than 1 million resi
dents, overall reported crime fell by 6 per
cent. Suburban counties and most mid

sized cities also reported declines, but rural
counties showed a 3 percent increase.
Among violent crimes, murder dropped
the most — 8 percent. Robbery was down
7 percent; rape 6 percent and aggravated
assault 3 percent.
Total property crimes dropped 1 per
cent, with auto theft down by 6 percent
and burglary 5 percent.
The only increase was in larceny-theft
— up 1 percent.
"This is the first glimmer of the impact
of the next generation," said Professor
Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie-Mellon
University, "because larceny — such as
bicycle theft, stealing auto parts and
shoplifting — is the crime with the
youngest criminals. The peak age for
larcenists is 15 or 16." Most burglars and
robbers are older.
"In the other crimes, what's going on
among teen-agers is being swamped by
much larger numbers of older folks who
are growing out of the high crime ages and
giving up crime," Blumstein added.
James Alan Fox, dean of criminal jus
tice at Northeastern University, explained
that "this calm before the crime storm

won't last much longer."
The murder rate for teen-agers grew by
22 percent between 1990-94, Fox said.
"Over the next 10 years, the teen popula
tion will expand by 17 percent, because
there are now 39 million children under
age 10, more than we've had since the
1950s when the Baby Boomers were in
grade school."
In addition to citing the aging of Baby
Boomers, experts and officials attributed
the four-year crime decline to closer police
work with citizens, longer prison sentences
for violent criminals, crackdowns on illegal
guns, declining unemployment and rising
public intolerance for crime.
"For five straight years before I took
office, violent crime increased in America,"
President Clinton said. "Our tough and
smart decisions to put more cops on the
street and get kids, guns and drugs off the
street... are now beginning to reverse the
trend."
Crime subcommittee chairman McCol
lum said a major reason is "because we've
put deterrence back into criminal justice
again. States are forcing more violent
criminals to serve longer sentences."
