# 2,500 flee Liberia on a freighter

MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) — Clouds of
dark smoke billowed over the city yesterday
as 2,500 Liberian refugees stood on the deck
of a freighter, sadly singing a patriotic hymn
and waving farewell as the ship inched away
from the burning capital.
They were the lacky ones.
Back on the streets, Monrovia was con
sumed by violence. Young fighters set
dozens of homes and buildings on fire yes
terday. Rocket-propelled grenades slammed
into Monrovia's besieged military barracks,
the flash point of a month of bloodshed that
has ruined the city and killed hundreds, if
not thousands, of residents.
At the port, hundreds of Liberians des
perately tried to climb up the sides of the
Nigerian freighter Bulk Challenge as it
chugged out to sea. Fighting erupted among
those who had paid $75 for the five-day trip
to Ghana but were left behind even after
their luggage was packed on the ship.
"It was unbelievable — an exodus. It was

pathetic," said Peter Sebok, the Dutch
owner of West Coast Fisheries, whose
offices are at the port.
The Liberians who made it aboard sailed
away singing "Lone Star Forever," a
national hymn of Africa's first independent
republic, founded by freed American slaves
in 1847.
Not far from the port, the two main
bridges into the city that run parallel across
the Mesurado River were being held by rival
enemy camps, making it difficult for anyone
to move in and out of downtown.
Rebel leader Charles Taylor had vowed
that the battle for the Barclay military bar
racks held by his enemies would be won by
the weekend. But Ulimo-J supporters of his
archrival Roosevelt Johnson fought fiercely
as Taylor's National Patriotic Front of
Liberia resumed shelling the barracks.
The clashes shattered hopes that John
son's evacuation from the country Friday —
carried out by American troops — would

spur moves toward ending the violence.
The fighting became even more brutal.
Hundreds of the 10,000 Liberians who
have sought shelter at the U.S. Embassy
residential compound stood watching in
horror yesterday as five of Taylor's fighters
were executed down the hill below.
The five fighters had their throats slit;
one had his ears chopped off. Later, a boy
who appeared to be about 12 years old
danced nude around the bodies, waving an
assault rifle above his head in a victory
cheer.
"Oh, it's Butt Naked, it's Butt Naked,"
the civilians murmured, referring to a gang
of Ulimo-J fighters who gave themselves
that nickname because they fight in the
nude.
African peacekeeping troops, who had
retreated up the street, entered the fighting
yesterday, shooting and killing two of Tay
lor's militiamen who tried to prevent them
from crossing a bridge.
