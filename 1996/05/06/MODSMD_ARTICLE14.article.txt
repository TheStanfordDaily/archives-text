Peace talks enter final phase
TAB A, Egypt (AP) — Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians
entered their final phase yesterday, with both sides set to face their toughest
conflicts: the future of Jerusalem and Jewish settlement on the West Bank.
Those issues, which date back to the founding of the Jewish state, have
been put off through five years of historic talks — talks that have so far pro
duced two peace accords and a Nobel Peace Prize shared among PLO leader
Yasser Arafat, Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres and his slain predecessor
Yitzhak Rabin.
Palestinian delegate Saeb Erakat said the talks that started yesterday are
"the beginning of a new era in our peace process . . . the real negotiations
between the Israelis and Palestinians."
"Let's say that for the past five years we've been having appetizers," he
said. This final phase of talks is expected to last at least three years.
Israeli chief negotiator Uri Savir and top Palestinian delegate Mahmoud
Abbas opened the session by warning violent extremists on both sides that
they cannot stop the process. Top Israeli security officials cautioned yester
day of impending suicide attacks by militants who oppose the peace process.
"You belong to the past," Abbas said during his speech. "You will lose for
we are determined to win."
