## Editorial Candidates need apply 
### 
Students must run for the
upcoming election to create
a viable single presidency

THOUGH FEW AT Stanford
beyond the insular world of
the ASSU seem aware of it,
a major campus election looms in
the near future. If all goes as
planned, Stanford students will
vote for a single student-body
president in two weeks.
It will be the first time in almost
20 years the executive power of the
ASSU will be vested in a single
person rather than in a four-mem
ber COR Arguably, that one per
son will therefore command a
great deal of authority, or, at least,
an impressive bully pulpit.
Yet surprisingly, there appears
to be little interest in running for
the job. This is an unpleasant
development, and all interested
students should begin the process
of running for president.
All candidates interested in run
ning for the position must submit
declarations of intent and petitions
to the ASSU Elections Commis
sion by this Thursday, May 9. So
far, only a handful of potential can
didates have picked up information
packets containing declaration and
petition forms. None have been
returned to the commission.
In other words, with only a few
days remaining to make the deci
sion, no student has yet thrown
his or her hat into the presidential
race.
It is not difficult to do so. The
declaration of intent form merely
asks the candidate to provide basic
information for the commission's
record-keeping purposes. The peti
tion for a president candidate
requires only 200 signatures. Can
didates must also turn in one addi
tional form which lists their party
affiliation, be it with a particular
campus organization or simply
independent.

With so little work involved to
run for such an important posi
tion, one would expect many peo
ple to apply. Many students like to
complain about the ASSU's ability
to get things done, or about what
they deem the organization's poor
representation of student needs. It
seems, however, that few of these
students are willing to put their
words into action.
Beyond this surface-level
hypocrisy in the lack of interest in
running for president, there is a
deeper concern. The single-presi
dent structure is the cornerstone
of the newly passed Constitution
'96. Three-quarters of those vot
ing in the spring ASSU elections
voted in favor of this new docu
ment; many campus leaders
actively supported it. It is difficult
to see how this new government
will have much legitimacy in the
eyes of its constituents — the stu
dents — or other bodies such as
the University administration if
its first presidential contest
amounts to nothing more than
rubber-stamping whoever finally
decides to run. If the Constitution
'96 government is to have credibil
ity, its first presidential contest
must be a real one. One is forced to
wonder, then, where all of Consti
tution '96's loud supporters have
gone now that the presidential
contest is nearly upon us.
Or, for that matter, where are
its detractors? Many criticized the
single-president structure that
Constitution '96 will set up, warn
ing of dire consequences for some
campus communities if the wrong
person is elected president. Surely
some detractors believe they can
be the right person for the job.
Those people should run as well.
In short, a real election — one
with multiple, viable candidates —
is necessary to give the first presi
dential election under Constitu
tion '96 the credibility it deserves.
Student leaders of all stripes — all
of whom pay lip service to the ide
als of effective student govern
ment — should take a risk and run
for ASSU President.
