## What is 'higher learning?' 
### 
STANFORD, OF COURSE, is an
"institution of higher learning" —
a title that can be interpreted in
many ways. Stress the third word
instead of the fourth, for instance, and
you'll find all of Lambda Nu begins to
smirk and nod approvingly. To others,
Stanford is merely an institution; a nec
essary — if not meaningless — rung on
the ladder to financial security. To most
of us, though, "learning" transcends
what is taught in the classroom. We
learn on the athletic fields and in our
bedrooms; in Memorial Church and in
our dining halls.
It's a constant process of trial and
error; a subtle indoctrination into a
world less sheltered than home. I, for
example, have learned that the vast
majority of Stanford students would
rather read a column titled "Some Peo
ple Need a Beating" than an article with
any relevance to humanity. What this
implies, I'm not yet sure — though I sus
pect it doesn't bode well for our future.
This whole learning bit is especially
relevant to spring quarter, since we're
beginning to get an idea of where we've
been and perhaps even of where we're
going. We have the greatest of all
weapons on our side: perspective.
Freshmen have learned that some
times Res Ed simply makes mistakes.
When the picture of your family is torn
to shreds and lying in the wastebasket,
you should probably address the issue

before your psychopathic roommate
replaces the screws in your bunk with
toothpicks.
The Class of 1999 has also discovered
the dynamics of Rush and its implica
tions on the Draw. ("Well, yeah. I guess I
used to like her. But still . . . like, that
doesn't mean I want to live with her any
more.") Don't worry, your friendship
will outlast any immediate differences
you may have, despite what people say. I
mean, no one could be that superficial,
right?
Sophomores, by and large, have very
little to learn, except perhaps that an
undergraduate population of 6,000 isn't
nearly as large as it first seems. Random
hookups become far less random when
everyone knows about them. And just
like those "hometown honeys," frosh
dorms, too, gradually lose their appeal.
Soon, all that remains from your First
year is a video scrapbook, a few draw
mates and an eternity of uncomfortable
greetings at the post office. ("What was
his name again? Didn't they call him
Toad?")
Junior year, on the other hand, is a
time of self-exploration and soul-search
ing — largely because all of one's friends
have either gone overseas, are living in
Potter or have decided to drop pre-med
and major in English. Many learn the
hard way that they should never have
used their preferred years of housing so
quickly, and thus they explore every pos

sible way to trick the Disabilities
Resource Center into granting a medical
exemption from the Draw. Pick a mala
dy, get your family doctor to verify it,
then figure out why your sickness
requires an open kitchen and a single
bedroom. The more creative, the better.
Diabetes works, as does insomnia on
occasion. Herpes, however, does not.
Seniors, of course, have the wisdom of
experience on their side. They've learned
it's better to just write the check for the
Senior Gift than suffer through months
of phone harassment from overzealous
solicitors. They've also discovered how
little weight a Stanford degree has in
some circles, especially among employ
ers. As rejection letter after rejection let
ter has melted ego after ego into a mas
sive puddle of self-pity, the importance of
networking has become obvious. If one
person is smart, then 10 others — no
matter how stupid — can get jobs. This,
seniors find, is the key to success.
Higher learning at Stanford is an
everyday process, often more valuable
than anything covered in a textbook.
Each year we gain more insight into how
our actions affect our lives; sometimes
for the better, often for the worse.

Ryan is trying to think of some medical
reason to get himself a single.
