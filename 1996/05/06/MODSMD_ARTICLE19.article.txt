Skateboarding should not be banned on campus

FOR THOSE of you who didn't
know, it is illegal (as dictated by a
Santa Clara County ordinance) to
ride a skateboard on the Stanford cam
pus. According to the police, this law
was passed as a result of intense lobby
ing by "high-ranking Stanford offi
cials," who had both the power and the
heartfelt desire to make riding around
on a board with four wheels illegal.
Please note that rollerblading is (of
course) legal, and is actually encour
aged by Gerhard Casper and friends, as
an incentive for Yuppie rollerblading
alumni to come to our scenic campus

(have you seen them?).
On March 16, as a friend and I were
riding skateboards in the street in front
of the Quad, we were viciously mugged by
three police officers (two in cars, one on
an off-road motorcycle). After admitting
how stupid it was that they had to do so,
they "confiscated" (stole) our skate
boards, took our pictures and wrote us
both tickets with a court date of April 30
which, along with two "guilty" pleas,
resulted in a fine of $200 each. No warn
ing, no signs posted, no nothing; just
some people dressed up in uniforms, com
plete with guns and self-righteousness,

with absolutely nothing better to do.
I won't do too much whining about
how skateboarding is not a crime,
because compared to what some groups
of people experience, the extent of my
persecution as a skateboarder is noth
ing. But as a "concerned student," I
should point out that Stanford students
should be able to skateboard on campus
wherever they want. The current law,
which dictates otherwise, results in
major police inconsistency (now I am
cited and fined, whereas in the past
police told me that I will never actually
get cited for skateboarding, especially if I

am "going to class"), and extensive fail
ure in enforcement. Like many other
skateboarders, I will continue to skate
whenever I feel like it or need to get
somewhere. This time, nobody will catch
me. A letter from President Casper to
Capt. Niemeyer, suggesting that Stan
ford students not be harassed for riding
skateboards, would solve a lot of
impending problems. But then I guess
our police would then run out of things
to do and lose the "excitement of the
chase."
