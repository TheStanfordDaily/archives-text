# Education to offer new program in '97
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
Focusing on more community
oriented teaching, the School of
Education will launch a new mas
ter's program in Learning Design
and Technology beginning in the
fall of 1997.
Dean of the School of Education
Richard Shavelson said Thursday
that the school has been working to
move beyond training educators in
"schoolhouses," to look at design
ing learning environments
throughout a community.
The school's technology focus is
part of a larger goal at Stanford to
incorporate technology into the
University's own learning environ
ment. The Committee on Technol
ogy in Teaching and Learning,
chaired by Senior Assoc. Dean of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences John Etchemendy, has been
meeting for two years.
"Designing a learning environ
ment is not just using general
learning theory but having inter
est in the well-contextualized ap
plication of theory," Shavelson
said. "Students need technology to
take full advantage of the learning
environment."
In January, when the school an
nounced a new academic plan, pro
grams began working to widen
their focuses to embrace the whole
community.
"Teachers need to be every
where — the library, the YMCA, in
all community organizations,"
Shavelson said.
The school focuses on training

the different types of educators in
real-world applications. Profes
sional practitioners — school
teachers and administrators —
study in programs which use prob
lem-based preparation. Doctoral
programs are also preparing edu
cators in research and policy analy
sis through community approach
es.
"As the top school of education
in the country, this part of training
is a model for other schools,"
Shavelson said.
Visiting Education Prof.
Michael Kamil, who is designing
the technology program, said he
hopes it will prepare people to take
advantage of "new technology and
new conceptions of learning."
"Students in the program will
have practiced experience in both
school and corporate settings,"
Kamil said. "We want to get tech
nology applied in those settings in
a more effective way than current
ly-"
Shavelson explained that often,
new technology is provided in
schools to enhance the learning en
vironment, but it is not used to its
full potential.
He said many educators think
technology can solve all of the
problems in education, but in real
ity, educators "need to ask what it
is one wants students to learn and
how technology can be a tool to get
there," Shavelson said. "Technolo
gy isn't the answer in itself."
Shavelson said he hopes one of
the field sites for students to use
will be the University itself. "What
we are doing complements the pro
jects of the new technology task
force well," Shavelson said. "Stu
dents could assist the University in
its goals, working on projects like
revising the biology sequence,
while learning to design different
learning environments."
The School of Education is also
developing a new Center for Com
munity and Children, which will
look at how communities respond
to the changing demographics of

children entering schools today.
According to Shavelson, a 25
percent decrease in funding over
the last 25 years prevents schools
from providing the social services
they once did. "How do we em
power communities to create
learning environments in other
places besides school?" he asked.
Shavelson said examining the
role of all types of educators helps
them see the problems with the
school system itself. "If you see a
kid who is editor of his Boys' and
Girls' Club newsletter failing
English, we know there is a hole
in the safety net," Shavelson said.
"What isn't happening in our
schools?"
