# Web page should have used internal resources
## 
### 
The first question which came to my
mind when accessing Stanford's new
World Wide Web page was not "Why is it
blue?" but "We paid $15,000 for this?" It
was not so much the new colors, the
extra quotations or the photographs that
impressed me but rather the need for
the University to tap external resources

to create a new web page. The creative
and artistic resources which Stanford
possesses in its faculty and students
could surely have been utilized to do a
similar or better job. The growing num
ber of students and faculty who have
developed their own web pages demon
strates that there is probably no short
age in people qualified as well as inter
ested in undertaking such an exercise
for the University. Further, if future
changes in the site are to be implement
ed internally, why the need to hire a

consulting firm in the first place?
Yes, it is important that Stanford has
an attractive web page to serve as an
introduction to the University and to
attract prospective students and schol
ars, but I am sure there were less
expensive alternatives to doing so. Easi
ly, we could have held a competition
amongst students to develop the most
suitable web page and simply offered an
acknowledgment of their efforts or even
a small monetary reward. Having
worked at the Stanford Fund, I have

witnessed firsthand the efforts required
in raising even a few hundred dollars
for the University. It is a sheer waste of
money for us to have to hire outside
consultants to create a web page when
we have sufficient resources to do the
same at home.
With the talent we have on this cam
pus and the budget cuts we have been
facing, why waste even a small amount?
