## Eggs and ideals and other things entirely beyond me 
### 
"It's not that I'm afraid of fertility ... it's
more like raw terror."
— Ari Newberger
MY FRIEND MOLLY has been
expecting me to call her. She and
I said we'd make plans to sit and
continue a talk about something impor
tant that's going on in her life these days.
And I'm supposed to call her. I told her I
would, but I haven't.
The truth is I've been putting it off.
I'm not exactly sure why, but in those
rare moments when my own inner work
ings aren't entirely alien to me I get the
feeling that I don't want to hear about
what's happening to her.
You see, Molly's donating an egg.
Answered an ad asking for an Asian
woman about this height, about that
weight, pretty is preferable. Fit the bill,
called, tested, passed, paired. Altogether
found fine enough to match with a couple
hoping to become a family, a couple who's
now paying her a computer-sized bundle
to help them do what they can't do alone.
YOU MIGHT NOT know exactly what
it means for a woman to donate an egg.
For men the process is simple: Pass the
screening test to see if your sperm count
looks anything like the Hulk's and if the
stuff freezes well and, if you also happen

to make the height requirement, all you
have to do is give up sex for a week or two
to begin doing professionally what you've
been doing your whole life free of charge.
In the female case, the job isn't nearly
so zippy. Shots are involved on a daily
basis. Hormones prime the system for
months to make ready for an eventual
surgical cultivation. Advil's out, as is caf
feine and alcohol and everything else.
And for these reasons the price tag on the
half-dozen or so eggs given over in a sin
gle retrieval is about 72 times the amount
of the average sperm glob.
But I took a look at Molly's watch
when she first told me about her doing
this, and from its sparkle I could tell she's
not in this for the cash. "There's got to be
a more personal reason for enduring all
this," I thought. Somewhere above my
brainstem flitted the vague memory that
in order to donate an egg one must have
already been pregnant at some point.
Strange associations started to form,
but nothing I came up with was as strik
ing as what she finally said when I finally
asked her why. Here's what she told me:
"Two years ago I found out I was preg
nant," Molly said. We were sitting on a
table beside what I think was a eucalyp
tus. "I guess trying to help this couple out
gives me a sense of completion about
that."

Huge, I know.
Like a schmuck I asked her what hap
pened to the pregnancy back two years
ago and she told me she'd had an abor
tion.
"Funny," she added, looking down,
watching her feet pick up a leaf, "it didn't
hit me until about a year later. I started
getting really sad about it. I thought I
was being dumb."
"You weren't."
"That's what I decided too. But I did
definitely feel something wasn't finished.
So last year I answered an ad and went in
and tried to do something for somebody."
"You've done this before?"
She shrugged shyly. "It didn't take. I
wanted it to."
"A SENSE OF completion." Have you
ever heard anything more stunning,
more human; anything that described
the inclinations to good and growth more
prettily? I was floored myself.
But Molly went on rather comfortably
to describe different parts of her experi
ence: how much the daily butt shots hurt;
how nice the recipients are; how excited
she was for them. She joked about how,
in both an evolutionary and a Catholic
sense, everything about what she was
doing was a disaster. She joked about
morality.

Eventually, because of a class, I had to
go. Which I regretted. But before I left I
promised to call her to continue talking
about all this. Which I haven't yet done.
But the truth is I can't do it. I can't sit
and listen any more to this tale of altru
ism and fertility, of her literally, physical
ly giving of herself to help others. Funny,
I've always been quite comfortable talk
ing to people about "issues." Hell, my
room's been a regular crisis clinic since I
was 16: drugs, depression, break-ups,
weddings — I've handled it all.
But this ... this is bigger than all that.
Than me.
And looking directly at it I'm forced to
recognize that, dammit, existentially
speaking, everything I've ever done with
my life shrinks like a wiener in the cold
compared to donating an ovum. I'd pay
hundreds to avoid procreation at any
given point — I probably have if you add
it up.
I've been so wrapped up in my trivial
quests and questions that hearing any
more about this amazing decision to
bring about a child, to help others, to sub
limate an instinct, to heal an old wound,
puts me face to face with the reality that,
so far, all of my effect on this world has
been hypothetical, academic, without
consequence. To date, my most profound
moral dilemmas have been whether it's

OK to add a cool sounding book you
didn't read to your bibliography and
whether or not to go back on Rogaine
now that its over the counter.
I'm 23: I've thought about what I'm
going to give the world, I've planned it,
but I haven't produced a damn thing yet,
not on that order of magnitude. And that
this is pretty much endemic to everyone
else I know isn't all that much of a com
fort.
But look what Molly's doing — she's
gone global.
God, I hate perspective.
SO IT MAKES sense now, in a petty
sort of way, just why, deep down, I don't
want to hear any more — it's too big. Of
course I'm not calling her, even when she
needs to talk about it most, even when
her surgery date is approaching and she
could use the support, even when there's
so much more I want to ask.
In a way, I suppose all this is some
thing of an odd apology from me to Molly
for not being able to handle anything
more substantial than an honors thesis. I
hope she forgives me my deficiency.
And I hope, like she does, that the egg
takes this time.
