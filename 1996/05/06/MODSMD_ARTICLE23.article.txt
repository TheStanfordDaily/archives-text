## Cardinal completes clean sweep of Cal Stanford sluggers use eight-run inning to polish off Golden Bears 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
In front of the second-largest crowd of the season at
Stanford's Sunken Diamond, the No. 12 Cardinal com
pleted a three-game sweep of California yesterday, com
ing from behind to claim a 14-7 victory in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division finale.
A crowd of 2,280 showed up for Senior Day to honor
Stanford's six fourth-year players. Five seniors — A.J.
Hinch, Troy Kent, Brian Dallimore, Cale Carter and
Sean Flikke were in the starting lineup yesterday.
Pitcher Mario Iglesias did not make an appearance in
the contest.
Those in attendance saw the Cardinal (35-17,19-11
in the Six-Pac) clinch second-place in the conference,
overcoming a five-run deficit with an eight-run seventh
inning rally. The collapse was typical of Cal's (27-29,10-
20 in the Six-Pac) season. Stanford also extended its
winning streak to 12 games, the longest streak since the
Cardinal posted 15 consecutive victories in 1990.
Yesterday, Stanford jumped out to a 2-0 lead, as Jody
Gerut and Hinch scored runs on RBI singles by Dal
limore and Kent. Both runners got on base with walks.
The lead was short-lived, however, as Cal left fielder
Gary Johnson and right fielder Gavin Brown both con
nected for solo home runs off Cardinal starter Jeff
Austin in the next inning.
The Golden Bears took a 4-2 lead when Brian Oliver's
two-run home run chased Austin in the fifth inning. Cal
added three more runs in the sixth inning to go ahead 7-
2 before Stanford began to chip into the lead.
The Cardinal picked up a lone run in its half of the
sixth when Luke Quaccia doubled in Hinch, who had led
off the inning with a single. Quaccia moved to third
when Dallimore grounded out, but Stanford was unable
to score again in the frame.
In the eighth inning, the Cardinal turned the game
around.
After Carter grounded to first to start the inning, Jay
Pecci was hit by a Reed Goemann pitch. Goemann then
walked Joe Kilburg and went to a 3-1 count against
Gerut. Cal coach Bob Milano changed pitchers in the
middle of Gerut's at bat, bringing in Ryland Sumner,
who threw ball four to Stanford's center fielder, bring
ing Hinch to the plate.
Not wanting to challenge the Cardinal's top home
run hitter, Sumner walked Hinch on four pitches, plat
ing Pecci.
"They were pitching me kind of funny all day. They

weren't giving me anything good to
hit," Hinch said. "But given this ball
park, and the fact that I've been
swinging the bat pretty well, they
didn't want to make a big mistake. It
turned out to haunt them a little bit,
because it prolonged the inning."
Indeed, the inning dragged on as
Milano made another pitching
change, sending Kerry McGonigal to
the mound. Quaccia greeted McGo
nigal with a bloop single to left, scor
ing Kilburg and making the score 7-
sCal
"With Quaccia behind I linch, you
take your chances by walking A.J.,
because Luke's been swinging the
bat well," said Stanford coach Mark
Marquess. "Luke is slower, so the
chance of a double play is greater. I
would have done the same thing."
McGonigal then induced an ap
parent inning-ending double play
ball off the hat of Dallimore, but
shortstop Dan Cey's throw to second
was errant and two runners scored
to tie the contest at 7-7.
Kent followed Dallimore with a
bloop single to right, scoring Quaccia
and giving Stanford its first lead
since the opening frame, 8-7. Sopho
more-Jon Schaefferthen drove a Mc-
Gonigal fastball over the 400-foot
marker in center field for his 11th
home run of the season.
The Cardinal scored three more
runs in the eighth inning to seal the
victory. Stanford's Tom Reimers (4-
4) got the win while McGonigal (4-2)
took the loss.
"We're playing pretty good base
ball and putting ourselves in the po
sition to win every game and it so
happens we have during this win
ning streak," Hinch said. "We'll take
them any way we can get them.
Today we were lucky because they
made a couple of key mistakes and
walked some hitters and we came up
with some big hits."
"Today was good," Marquess
agreed. "They gave us a lot by walk
ing people and we got a couple of
bloop hits — it was just one of those
innings, but we'll take it. We hung in
there, we played hard and I thought
Reimers did a real good job. It was a
good win for us, especially being be
hind like we were."
Marquess was pleased with the
way his team was able to overcome
the Golden Bear lead to post the ex
citing come- from-behind win.
"This is one of the few games this
season where we've come back from

far behind," Marquess said. "A good
team takes advantage when they're
given gifts and we took advantage of
them today. We got the big hits, so I
was pleased with it."
Marquess was also pleased with
his team's performance in Satur
day's affair with the Bears played at
Cal's Evans Diamond in Berkeley.
Leading the way for the Cardinal
in that contest was freshman right
hander Chad Hutchinson (7-1), who
tossed a complete-game five-hitter
in Stanford's 7-1 triumph. Hutchin
son struck out eight and allowed just
one walk and one run while running
his conference record to 5-0.
"I think it was his best outing of
the year," Marquess said. "He was
pretty dominant (on Saturday). He's
been dominant at times this season,
but not for as long as he was (on Sat
urday)."
Hutchinson took a no-hitter into
the sixth inning before Brown sin
gled to left field. The Stanford bats
supported Hutchinson early, as the
Cardinal posted three runs in the
third inning and another in the
fourth. Cal plated its lone run in the
sixth to make the score 4-1, but
Stanford padded its lead with three
more runs in the seventh.
Stanford hit four home runs on
the afternoon, two off the unlikely
bats of Chris Clark and Pecci. The
long balls were the first career shots
for both batters. Kent and Schaeffer
also went deep Saturday, notching
home runs number eight and 10, re
spectively.
Friday night belonged to sopho
more pitching ace Kyle Peterson, as
have many nights in recent weeks.
Peterson (8-5) threw a complete
game to earn a 9-2 win over the Gold
en Bears, striking out nine and scat
tering nine hits.
After falling behind 2-0 after two
innings, Stanford rallied with a big
fifth inning in which five Cardinal
runners scored. Oddly enough, that
rally also started with Pecci being hit
by a pitch and all five runs came after
two outs had been recorded.
"I think we're all picking it up,
from the looks of things," Peterson
said. "I've been feeling really com
fortable out there, probably the
most comfortable I've felt all year
(on Friday). They got some knick
knack hits early then I was able to
put things together. We played
some good defense and scored some
runs."
With the sweep wrapping up sec
ond place in the Six-Pac, the Cardi
nal is looking to finish the season by
collecting a few more non-confer
ence victories before heading into

postseason play.
"If we keep winning, we think
we've definitely got a shot at hosting
a regional and maybe getting a No. 2
seed," Peterson said. "From then on,
it's kind of out of our control, but if
we keep winning, we're going to put
some pressure on thatselection com
mittee."
Dallimore, one of the six seniors
on the Cardinal squad, said the team
is finally playing up to its ability and
playing with confidence.
"We've been picking each other
up these past couple of weeks, every
body's been playing well," Dallimore

said. "I think that's been the key
thing, we just concentrate on playing
baseball.
"This is the first time since I've
been here that we've had a long win
ning streak," he said. "We want this
streak to keep going — it's fun and
we know we have a chance to go into
the postseason with a 17-game win
ning streak. That does a lot for our
confidence and it also says a lot to
other teams in our regional. It estab
lishes a little bit of intimidation, they
know we're playing at our best."
That is something Cal found out
first hand this weekend.

ball off the hat of Dallimore, but
shortstop Dan Cey's throw to second
was errant and two runners scored
to tie the contest at 7-7.
Kent followed Dallimore with a
bloop single to right, scoring Quaccia
and giving Stanford its first lead
since the opening frame, 8-7. Sopho
more-Jon Schaefferthen drove a Mc-
Gonigal fastball over the 400-foot
marker in center field for his 11th
home run of the season.
The Cardinal scored three more
runs in the eighth inning to seal the
victory. Stanford's Tom Reimers (4-
4) got the win while McGonigal (4-2)
took the loss.
"We're playing pretty good base
ball and putting ourselves in the po
sition to win every game and it so
happens we have during this win
ning streak," Hinch said. "We'll take
them any way we can get them.
Today we were lucky because they
made a couple of key mistakes and
walked some hitters and we came up
with some big hits."
"Today was good," Marquess
agreed. "They gave us a lot by walk
ing people and we got a couple of
bloop hits — it was just one of those
innings, but we'll take it. We hung in
there, we played hard and I thought
Reimers did a real good job. It was a
good win for us, especially being be
hind like we were."
Marquess was pleased with the
way his team was able to overcome
the Golden Bear lead to post the ex
citing come- from-behind win.
"This is one of the few games this
season where we've come back from

far behind," Marquess said. "A good
team takes advantage when they're
given gifts and we took advantage of
them today. We got the big hits, so I
was pleased with it."
Marquess was also pleased with
his team's performance in Satur
day's affair with the Bears played at
Cal's Evans Diamond in Berkeley.
Leading the way for the Cardinal
in that contest was freshman right
hander Chad Hutchinson (7-1), who
tossed a complete-game five-hitter
in Stanford's 7-1 triumph. Hutchin
son struck out eight and allowed just
one walk and one run while running
his conference record to 5-0.
"I think it was his best outing of
the year," Marquess said. "He was
pretty dominant (on Saturday). He's
been dominant at times this season,
but not for as long as he was (on Sat
urday)."
Hutchinson took a no-hitter into
the sixth inning before Brown sin
gled to left field. The Stanford bats
supported Hutchinson early, as the
Cardinal posted three runs in the
third inning and another in the
fourth. Cal plated its lone run in the
sixth to make the score 4-1, but
Stanford padded its lead with three
more runs in the seventh.
Stanford hit four home runs on
the afternoon, two off the unlikely
bats of Chris Clark and Pecci. The
long balls were the first career shots
for both batters. Kent and Schaeffer
also went deep Saturday, notching
home runs number eight and 10, re
spectively.
Friday night belonged to sopho
more pitching ace Kyle Peterson, as
have many nights in recent weeks.
Peterson (8-5) threw a complete
game to earn a 9-2 win over the Gold
en Bears, striking out nine and scat
tering nine hits.
After falling behind 2-0 after two
innings, Stanford rallied with a big
fifth inning in which five Cardinal
runners scored. Oddly enough, that
rally also started with Pecci being hit
by a pitch and all five runs came after
two outs had been recorded.
"I think we're all picking it up,
from the looks of things," Peterson
said. "I've been feeling really com
fortable out there, probably the
most comfortable I've felt all year
(on Friday). They got some knick
knack hits early then I was able to
put things together. We played
some good defense and scored some
runs."
With the sweep wrapping up sec
ond place in the Six-Pac, the Cardi
nal is looking to finish the season by
collecting a few more non-confer
ence victories before heading into

postseason play.
"If we keep winning, we think
we've definitely got a shot at hosting
a regional and maybe getting a No. 2
seed," Peterson said. "From then on,
it's kind of out of our control, but if
we keep winning, we're going to put
some pressure on thatselection com
mittee."
Dallimore, one of the six seniors
on the Cardinal squad, said the team
is finally playing up to its ability and
playing with confidence.
"We've been picking each other
up these past couple of weeks, every
body's been playing well," Dallimore

said. "I think that's been the key
thing, we just concentrate on playing
baseball.
"This is the first time since I've
been here that we've had a long win
ning streak," he said. "We want this
streak to keep going — it's fun and
we know we have a chance to go into
the postseason with a 17-game win
ning streak. That does a lot for our
confidence and it also says a lot to
other teams in our regional. It estab
lishes a little bit of intimidation, they
know we're playing at our best."
That is something Cal found out
first hand this weekend.

Freshman Tony Cogan delivers in yesterday's 14-7 rout of Cal. The
win was the Cardinal'slOth in a row and secured second place in the
Pac-10 Southern Division for Stanford.
In front of the second-largest crowd of the season at
Stanford's Sunken Diamond, the No. 12 Cardinal com
pleted a three-game sweep of California yesterday, com
ing from behind to claim a 14-7 victory in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division finale.
A crowd of 2,280 showed up for Senior Day to honor
Stanford's six fourth-year players. Five seniors — A.J.
Hinch, Troy Kent, Brian Dallimore, Cale Carter and
Sean Flikke were in the starting lineup yesterday.
Pitcher Mario Iglesias did not make an appearance in
the contest.
Those in attendance saw the Cardinal (35-17,19-11
in the Six-Pac) clinch second-place in the conference,
overcoming a five-run deficit with an eight-run seventh
inning rally. The collapse was typical of Cal's (27-29,10-
20 in the Six-Pac) season. Stanford also extended its
winning streak to 12 games, the longest streak since the
Cardinal posted 15 consecutive victories in 1990.
Yesterday, Stanford jumped out to a 2-0 lead, as Jody
Gerut and Hinch scored runs on RBI singles by Dal
limore and Kent. Both runners got on base with walks.
The lead was short-lived, however, as Cal left fielder
Gary Johnson and right fielder Gavin Brown both con
nected for solo home runs off Cardinal starter Jeff
Austin in the next inning.
The Golden Bears took a 4-2 lead when Brian Oliver's
two-run home run chased Austin in the fifth inning. Cal
added three more runs in the sixth inning to go ahead 7-
2 before Stanford began to chip into the lead.
The Cardinal picked up a lone run in its half of the
sixth when Luke Quaccia doubled in Hinch, who had led
off the inning with a single. Quaccia moved to third
when Dallimore grounded out, but Stanford was unable
to score again in the frame.
In the eighth inning, the Cardinal turned the game
around.
After Carter grounded to first to start the inning, Jay
Pecci was hit by a Reed Goemann pitch. Goemann then
walked Joe Kilburg and went to a 3-1 count against
Gerut. Cal coach Bob Milano changed pitchers in the
middle of Gerut's at bat, bringing in Ryland Sumner,
who threw ball four to Stanford's center fielder, bring
ing Hinch to the plate.
Not wanting to challenge the Cardinal's top home
run hitter, Sumner walked Hinch on four pitches, plat
ing Pecci.
"They were pitching me kind of funny all day. They

weren't giving me anything good to
hit," Hinch said. "But given this ball
park, and the fact that I've been
swinging the bat pretty well, they
didn't want to make a big mistake. It
turned out to haunt them a little bit,
because it prolonged the inning."
Indeed, the inning dragged on as
Milano made another pitching
change, sending Kerry McGonigal to
the mound. Quaccia greeted McGo
nigal with a bloop single to left, scor
ing Kilburg and making the score 7-
sCal
"With Quaccia behind I linch, you
take your chances by walking A.J.,
because Luke's been swinging the
bat well," said Stanford coach Mark
Marquess. "Luke is slower, so the
chance of a double play is greater. I
would have done the same thing."
McGonigal then induced an ap
parent inning-ending double play
ball off the hat of Dallimore, but
shortstop Dan Cey's throw to second
was errant and two runners scored
to tie the contest at 7-7.
Kent followed Dallimore with a
bloop single to right, scoring Quaccia
and giving Stanford its first lead
since the opening frame, 8-7. Sopho

Gonigal fastball over the 400-foot

The Cardinal scored three more
runs in the eighth inning to seal the
victory. Stanford's Tom Reimers (4-
4) got the win while McGonigal (4-2)
took the loss.
"We're playing pretty good base
