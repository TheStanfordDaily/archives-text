## Cardinal completes clean sweep of Cal Stanford sluggers use eight-run inning to polish off Golden Bears 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
In front of the second-largest crowd of the season at
Stanford's Sunken Diamond, the No. 12 Cardinal com
pleted a three-game sweep of California yesterday, com
ing from behind to claim a 14-7 victory in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division finale.
A crowd of 2,280 showed up for Senior Day to honor
Stanford's six fourth-year players. Five seniors — A.J.
Hinch, Troy Kent, Brian Dallimore, Cale Carter and
Sean Flikke were in the starting lineup yesterday.
Pitcher Mario Iglesias did not make an appearance in
the contest.
Those in attendance saw the Cardinal (35-17,19-11
in the Six-Pac) clinch second-place in the conference,
overcoming a five-run deficit with an eight-run seventh
inning rally. The collapse was typical of Cal's (27-29,10-
20 in the Six-Pac) season. Stanford also extended its
winning streak to 12 games, the longest streak since the
Cardinal posted 15 consecutive victories in 1990.
Yesterday, Stanford jumped out to a 2-0 lead, as Jody
Gerut and Hinch scored runs on RBI singles by Dal
limore and Kent. Both runners got on base with walks.
The lead was short-lived, however, as Cal left fielder
Gary Johnson and right fielder Gavin Brown both con
nected for solo home runs off Cardinal starter Jeff
Austin in the next inning.
The Golden Bears took a 4-2 lead when Brian Oliver's
two-run home run chased Austin in the fifth inning. Cal
added three more runs in the sixth inning to go ahead 7-
2 before Stanford began to chip into the lead.
The Cardinal picked up a lone run in its half of the
sixth when Luke Quaccia doubled in Hinch, who had led
off the inning with a single. Quaccia moved to third
when Dallimore grounded out, but Stanford was unable
to score again in the frame.
In the eighth inning, the Cardinal turned the game
around.
After Carter grounded to first to start the inning, Jay
Pecci was hit by a Reed Goemann pitch. Goemann then
walked Joe Kilburg and went to a 3-1 count against
Gerut. Cal coach Bob Milano changed pitchers in the
middle of Gerut's at bat, bringing in Ryland Sumner,
who threw ball four to Stanford's center fielder, bring
ing Hinch to the plate.
Not wanting to challenge the Cardinal's top home
run hitter, Sumner walked Hinch on four pitches, plat
ing Pecci.
