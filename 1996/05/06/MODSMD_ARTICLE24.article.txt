# Bears continue to dominate Big Meet
## 
### Sam Wang Contributing writer 
BERKELEY, Calif. - There
must have been a sense of deja vu
for both the Stanford and the UC-
Berkeley men's track and field
teams last Saturday afternoon
when, with only one event left,
the score was announced over the
PA system. 79-79. The 103 rd run
ning of the Big Meet had come
down to the final event of the day,
just as the 102 nd Big Meet did.
In the end, however, there was
again only heartbreak for the
Cardinal men. The final score was
84-79, with the victory going to
the Golden Bears. The Cardinal
women also lost a close competi
tion by the score of 83 to 71.
After a tough day of close and
exciting competition, the Cardi
nal men were tied with their Cal
rivals 79-79 with only the 4 x 400
meter relay left. Under a beauti
ful, blue sky in Berkeley's Ed
wards Stadium, the time seemed
perfect for the Stanford men to fi
nally snap the 24-year-old (now
25-year-old) losing streak that
has been haunting Stanford for a
quarter of a century.
The Cardinal 4 x 400 crew was
primed to erase memories of last
year's defeat, having the winners
of the 400 meter and the 400
meter hurdles, junior Jimmie
Johnson and sophomore Jeff
Allen, respectively, anchoring the
last two legs of the race. Junior
Tad Heath and freshman Jauron
Pigg were responsible for the first
half of the race.
With the home crowd cheering
them on, Cal's Keith Moten and
James Elliot blazed to a 20-meter
lead in the first two legs and es
sentially wrapped up the race be
fore Johnson and Allen even had

a chance to handle the baton.
Thomas Brown and Jesse Wilson
finished the job for the Bears, eas
ily holding off Johnson and Allen
in the final two legs. The team
from Berkeley ran a time of
3:13.07 to Stanford's 3:16.05.
The day began auspiciously for
the Cardinal. In the first event of
the day, sophomore Adam Con
nolly and junior Justin Strand
went one-two in the hammer
throws with a pair of personal
bests. Connolly's effort traveled
208 feet and 8 inches, while
Strand threw 207-6.
The Cardinal then went on to
sweep the 3,000 meter steeple
chase with the trio of senior Mark
Fadil and juniors Bryan Zmijews
ki and Jose Fierro, finishing in
that order.
However, the tide began to
turn in Cal's favor in the long
jumps. On his final jump of the
day, Cardinal junior Joe Newsum
picked a perfect time to unleash a
personal-best jump of 23-9 1/2,
vaulting him into the lead past
Cal freshman Chris Ferreira,
who was the final jumper of the
day. Not to be outdone, Ferreira
leapt 23-11 3/4, recapturing first
place and putting his team into
the lead for the first time.
The team lost even more mo
mentum when the Cal 4 x 100
relay team sped by the Cardinal
by .2 seconds.
However, the Cardinal men
were able to regroup and come
back. Stanford gained important
points with a win in the shot put
by Pete Swanson, a sweep of the
5,000 by Rob Reeder, Greg Jim
merson and Jason Balkman, vic
tories by Johnson in both the 200
and the 400 and Allen's perfor
mance in the 400-meter hurdles.
Allen's upset win came late in the
day, just as Cal seemed ready to
overwhelm the Cardinal.
"A pivotal moment of the meet
was Jeff Allen with a huge upset win
in the hurdles," head coach Vin
Lananna said. "He really sparked
the final push towards trying to win
the meet."
As for the Lady Cardinal, it was
an uphill battle the whole day, dur
ing which they never gained the
lead.
The women middle-distance and
distance runners gave dominating
performances with wins in the 800,
the 1,500, the 3,000 and the 5,000.
Senior Dena Dey was a double
winner in both the 800- and the
1,500-meter runs. Stanford ruled
the 1,500 with freshman Mary Cobb
coming in second and junior Monal
Chokshi in third in addition to Dey's
victory.
Cobb was also involved in a Stan
ford sweep in the 3,000, teaming
with sophomore Sarna Renfro and
senior Kay Luo to complete the

group. Renfro had won the 5,000 in
the first running event of the day.
"Those were tremendous perfor
mances by our athletes," Lananna
said. "The great part of the meet on
the women's side was that our ath
letes rose to the occasion in all
areas."
The Lady Cardinal also posted a
win in the high jump by freshman
Tracye Lawyer and victories in the
javelin and the hammer throws by
sophomore Sami Jo Small and se
nior Sue Demars, respectively.
Despite the two tough losses,
Lananna is still very optimistic
about both his men's and women's
squads.
"Although it is a very important
meet in our season, it is not the
benchmark we use for determining
the success or failure of the track
and field year," said Lananna.
"We have the highest number of
Pac-10 and NCAA qualifiers in the
history of our program. That fact,
combined with the fact we were very
close in both dual meets, highlights
that we have both a very elite-level
team and a very strong and deep
team."
The Cardinal hosts its final
home event of the year next week
with the Cardinal Invitational.
