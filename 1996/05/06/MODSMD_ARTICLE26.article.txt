## 
### Erin Bryla Contributing writer 
This weekend, the women's
water polo team took on some new
opponents in the pool, but the
squad's results were much the same
as the Cardinal won three games
while dropping one and tying anoth
er. Overall, Stanford did not finish as
champions at the Pacific Coast
Championships, a California club
team tournament, but managed to
gain valuable experience over the
weekend.
The team looked very different
this weekend due to the fact that
many of the team's key starters were
being rested for next week's nation
al competition. Thus, the team's re
serves were pivotal in the Cardinal's
weekend matches.
The Cardinal opened the week
end on a down note with a loss to Cal
Open. The defeat came at the hands
of a team made up of a number of
U.S. National Team members,
Canadian National Team members
and Italian professional players. The
score illustrated the depth of the Cal
Open squad, as the Cardinal could
do little to stop them and lost 10-0.
Stanford then faced Marin A and
managed its first victory of the tour
nament. The Cardinal, which was
led by the outstanding play of
Heather Rodde and backup goal
keeper Tamar Engel and , outlasted
Marin, 5-3.
The Cardinal's last game of its

group was against Chelamen. The
Cardinal needed a win in this game
to advance to the winner's bracket.
The Cardinal seemed well on its way
to that victory, garnering an early 4-
0 lead. However, Stanford could not
hold Chelamen off and the game
ended in a 6-6 tie. As the Stanford
lead diminished, so did the team's
chances of making the winner's
bracket. The tie was not good
enough to advance the Cardinal —
Stanford was edged out by its goal
differential.
The Cardinal then went on to
play Davis 8., a game that Stanford
dominated from start to finish.
"We had a good time in [the Davis
game] eveiyone was really loose,"
said head coach Ben Quittner.
Rodde led the squad with five
goals, while Heather Crary, playing
out of the her normal goalkeeper po
sition, scored twice.
The Cardinal's final game was on
Sunday morning against a familiar
foe — Marin A The squad once
again pulled off a two-goal victory
against Marin, 6-4.
"The bench responded really well
to having the task of playing the en
tire tournament," Quittner said.
Stanford is looking to build upon
these victories as the squad gets
ready to contend for the national
title next weekend at UC- Davis.
This year's tournament will be the
first time that the Stanford women's
team will compete for the national
title as a varsity program.
