### Robin Davidson Staff writer 
The Stanford softball team
dropped four games this week
end in Pacific 10 Conference
competition to UCLA and the
University of Washington. The
Cardinal (23-26 overall, 6-16 in
the Pac-10) have now lost nine
straight games including the de
feats at the hands of the Bruins
(4-2 and 7-2) and the Huskies (6-
0 and 9-1).
The Cardinal's first game
against UCLA was a battle of big
hits. Stanford had five hits and
UCLA tallied eight, but three
hits and one sacrifice were all the
offensive production required to
score the game's six runs. Stan
ford struck first when freshman
Michele Acosta put the Cardinal
on the board in the bottom of the
first inning. Acosta ripped an
RBI single to right field that
scored junior Amanda Renteria
for a 1-0 lead.
The score would remain at 1-0
for the majority of the game, as
neither team could make a dent
in their opponent's defense for
the next four innings. Finally, in
the top of the sixth, UCLA's Kim
Wuest hit a long fly ball to deep
left field for a solo home run.
Wuest's hit tied the score and
sent the contest into extra in
nings.
"Today was a really good day
[in spite of the loss]," said head
coach Sandy Pearce. "We're hit
ting the ball well and our pitch
ers are doing well."
The teams stepped up defen

sively, as the offenses remained
stagnant until the 10th. In the
10th, the game went to Interna
tional Tiebreak Rules which puts
a runner on second base for the
start of each inning. UCLA's
Nicole Ochoa started the tenth
at second base and was moved to
third on a sacrifice bunt by Al

leah Poulson. Sandra Burkey
drew a walk bringing Wuest to
the plate. Wuest put the nail in
the Cardinal's coffin with her
second home run of the game to
give the Bruins a 4-1 lead.
Stanford would not go down
easily though. Freshman Marcy
Crouch was on second base for

the Cardinal at the start of its
half of the 10th. With one out,
freshman Michelle Schneider
doubled, but Crouch was held at
third by the Bruins. Junior Sum
mer Lee scored Crouch from
third with a sacrifice fly, but

time ran out for Stanford as the
Cardinal was unable to score
again and fell to UCLA 4-2 in ten
innings.
Stanford had just 20 minutes
to regroup from the heartbreak
ing loss before trying once more
to steal a victory from the heavi
ly favored Bruins. UCLA put the
first runs on the board with two
in the top of the second. Wuest
got things started with a leadoff
walk. Julie Marshall followed
with a single and then Christie
Ambrosi drove in Wuest with a
single. Marshall scored when
Ambrosi got caught in a run
down but avoided being tagged
out until Marshall could score.
Stanford jumped right back at
the Bruins in the bottom of the
inning. The Cardinal loaded the
bases with two outs for senior
captain Lynn Anderson. Ander
son hit a high bouncing
grounder that was good for an
infield RBI single and cut
UCLA's lead in half, but Bruin
pitcher Kaci Clark got out of the
jam by forcing the next batter to
ground out, leaving the bases
loaded.
UCLA scored three more runs
in the third and added two more
in the fourth to build an insur
mountable 7-1 lead. In the third
inning Laurie Fritz reached base
on a grounder to shortstop. The
play was one of several contro
versial calls at first base during
the game that went in favor of
the Bruins. Kelly Howard fol
lowed Fritz with a bunt to reach
base and advanced to second on a
throw to third to get Fritz out.
Ginny Mike-Mitchell then
laid down a bunt of her own that
scored Fritz from third. Julie
Adams drove in the next run
with an RBI single. Stanford
seemed to be on its way out of the
inning when Schneider caught a
short pop up for the first out, but
a dead-ball throwing error on the
Cardinal allowed one more run
to score.
In the next inning, UCLA
managed two more runs on two
hits, a walk, and a wild pitch.
Poulson drove in the Bruins' two
runs with an RBI single to score
Fritz and Howard. UCLA moved
ahead and never looked back as
they rolled on to a 7-2 victory.
The Cardinal's final run came

in the bottom of the sixth. Acos
ta led the inning with a single,
and Lee drew a walk to put run
ners on first and second. Fresh
man Kelly Yablonski, who was 3-
for-3 for Stanford in the game,
singled to load the bases for
freshman Shane Anderson. An
derson drew an RBI walk, but
the Bruins dodged another bul
let, as Stanford left the bases
loaded for the second time in the
game.
Overall, the Cardinal strand
ed nine runners in the loss; the
Bruins left seven. Stanford also
managed eight hits to UCLA's
eleven, but the team did not get
an extra-base hit in the entire
game. Each team committed one
error, but UCLA's seven runs in
the second through fourth in
nings were too much for the Car
dinal to overcome.
Against top-ranked Washing
ton, Stanford did not fare as
well. The Huskies have won 15
straight games and have all but
secured the Pac-10 title. Wash
ington jumped on the Cardinal
early with one run in the first in
ning and two more in the second.
The Huskies pounded the Cardi
nal for a triple, three doubles,
and two stolen bases in the
game. Washington held onto its
three-run lead until the sixth in
ning when they added three
more to reach the final 6-0 score.
In that contest the Huskies
managed 11 hits to Stanford's
three, but all six runs were at
tributed to two players. Michelle
Church and Jennifer Cline each
had three RBIs to give Washing
ton the victory.
The Husky bats were just as
lethal to the Cardinal in game two
of the doubleheader. Stanford
gave up 12 hits and committed
three errors in the 9-1 loss. Wash
ington jumped to a 5-0 lead in the
first inning on three hits and
three stolen bases. Once again
Church led the way for the
Huskies with three RBIs. Church
had four hits and six RBIs on the
day to lead all batters.
Down 6-0 in the sixth inning,
the Cardinal finally managed to
put a run on the board. Stan
ford's Renteria, who was one of
only two Cardinal players to get
a hit in both games, scored to
give Stanford its only run of the
day.
"Once again the other teams
are just making us make [the
plays]," Pearce said. "As long as
we keep fighting, we'll be fine."

with a single and then Christie
Ambrosi drove in Wuest with a
single. Marshall scored when
Ambrosi got caught in a run
down but avoided being tagged
out until Marshall could score.
Stanford jumped right back at
the Bruins in the bottom of the
inning. The Cardinal loaded the
bases with two outs for senior
captain Lynn Anderson. Ander
son hit a high bouncing
grounder that was good for an
infield RBI single and cut
UCLA's lead in half, but Bruin
pitcher Kaci Clark got out of the
jam by forcing the next batter to
ground out, leaving the bases
loaded.
UCLA scored three more runs
in the third and added two more
in the fourth to build an insur
mountable 7-1 lead. In the third
inning Laurie Fritz reached base
on a grounder to shortstop. The
play was one of several contro
versial calls at first base during
the game that went in favor of
the Bruins. Kelly Howard fol
lowed Fritz with a bunt to reach
base and advanced to second on a
throw to third to get Fritz out.
Ginny Mike-Mitchell then
laid down a bunt of her own that
scored Fritz from third. Julie
Adams drove in the next run
with an RBI single. Stanford
seemed to be on its way out of the
inning when Schneider caught a
short pop up for the first out, but
a dead-ball throwing error on the
Cardinal allowed one more run
to score.
In the next inning, UCLA
managed two more runs on two
hits, a walk, and a wild pitch.
Poulson drove in the Bruins' two
runs with an RBI single to score
Fritz and Howard. UCLA moved
ahead and never looked back as
they rolled on to a 7-2 victory.
The Cardinal's final run came

in the bottom of the sixth. Acos
ta led the inning with a single,
and Lee drew a walk to put run
ners on first and second. Fresh
man Kelly Yablonski, who was 3-
for-3 for Stanford in the game,
singled to load the bases for
freshman Shane Anderson. An
derson drew an RBI walk, but
the Bruins dodged another bul
let, as Stanford left the bases
loaded for the second time in the
game.
Overall, the Cardinal strand
ed nine runners in the loss; the
Bruins left seven. Stanford also
managed eight hits to UCLA's
eleven, but the team did not get
an extra-base hit in the entire
game. Each team committed one
error, but UCLA's seven runs in
the second through fourth in
nings were too much for the Car
dinal to overcome.
Against top-ranked Washing
ton, Stanford did not fare as
well. The Huskies have won 15
straight games and have all but
secured the Pac-10 title. Wash
ington jumped on the Cardinal
early with one run in the first in
ning and two more in the second.
The Huskies pounded the Cardi
nal for a triple, three doubles,
and two stolen bases in the
game. Washington held onto its
three-run lead until the sixth in
ning when they added three
more to reach the final 6-0 score.
In that contest the Huskies
managed 11 hits to Stanford's
three, but all six runs were at
tributed to two players. Michelle
Church and Jennifer Cline each
had three RBIs to give Washing
ton the victory.
The Husky bats were just as
lethal to the Cardinal in game two
of the doubleheader. Stanford
gave up 12 hits and committed
three errors in the 9-1 loss. Wash
ington jumped to a 5-0 lead in the
first inning on three hits and
three stolen bases. Once again
Church led the way for the
Huskies with three RBIs. Church
had four hits and six RBIs on the
day to lead all batters.
Down 6-0 in the sixth inning,
the Cardinal finally managed to
put a run on the board. Stan
ford's Renteria, who was one of
only two Cardinal players to get
a hit in both games, scored to
give Stanford its only run of the
day.
"Once again the other teams
are just making us make [the
plays]," Pearce said. "As long as
we keep fighting, we'll be fine."
