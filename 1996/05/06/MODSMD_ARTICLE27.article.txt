# Softball endures another winless weekend

### Robin Davidson Staff writer 
The Stanford softball team
dropped four games this week
end in Pacific 10 Conference
competition to UCLA and the
University of Washington. The
Cardinal (23-26 overall, 6-16 in
the Pac-10) have now lost nine
straight games including the de
feats at the hands of the Bruins
(4-2 and 7-2) and the Huskies (6-
0 and 9-1).
The Cardinal's first game
against UCLA was a battle of big
hits. Stanford had five hits and
UCLA tallied eight, but three
hits and one sacrifice were all the
offensive production required to
score the game's six runs. Stan
ford struck first when freshman
Michele Acosta put the Cardinal
on the board in the bottom of the
first inning. Acosta ripped an
RBI single to right field that
scored junior Amanda Renteria
for a 1-0 lead.
The score would remain at 1-0
for the majority of the game, as
neither team could make a dent
in their opponent's defense for
the next four innings. Finally, in
the top of the sixth, UCLA's Kim
Wuest hit a long fly ball to deep
left field for a solo home run.
Wuest's hit tied the score and
sent the contest into extra in
nings.
"Today was a really good day
[in spite of the loss]," said head
coach Sandy Pearce. "We're hit
ting the ball well and our pitch
ers are doing well."
The teams stepped up defen

sively, as the offenses remained
stagnant until the 10th. In the
10th, the game went to Interna
tional Tiebreak Rules which puts
a runner on second base for the
start of each inning. UCLA's
Nicole Ochoa started the tenth
at second base and was moved to
third on a sacrifice bunt by Al

leah Poulson. Sandra Burkey
drew a walk bringing Wuest to
the plate. Wuest put the nail in
the Cardinal's coffin with her
second home run of the game to
give the Bruins a 4-1 lead.
Stanford would not go down
easily though. Freshman Marcy
Crouch was on second base for

the Cardinal at the start of its
half of the 10th. With one out,
freshman Michelle Schneider
doubled, but Crouch was held at
third by the Bruins. Junior Sum
mer Lee scored Crouch from
third with a sacrifice fly, but
