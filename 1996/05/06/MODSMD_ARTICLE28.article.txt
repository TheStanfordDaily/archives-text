Capping off a season which in
cluded its first Big Game win in 16
years and a Final Four appear
ance, the Stanford men's rugby
team recovered from a tough loss
in the National Semifinals to se
cure third place in the nation.
Going into the weekend, the
team was fired up to face the top
national teams in its first Final
Four appearance under coach
Franck Boivert.
"I can't wait to play in Col
orado Springs. It's going to be
great and we're all psyched up for
it," said sophomore lock Jeremy
Toner.
Along with the excitement
came a feeling of wariness. Stan
ford realized that at this level,
every team is strong and deep
with talented players.
"It's going to be a tough game

against Penn State and we aren't
sure we want to play them first,
but we're going to give it our
best," added senior flanker Trung
Ngo.
The players' worries were well
founded as Penn State wore Stan
ford down and defeated the Cardi
nal 42-29 in Saturday's semi-final
game. With eight minutes left and
Stanford trailing by just one
point, 30-29, a controversial
penalty call was made against the
Stanford, halting a Cardinal drive
just a foot away from scoring a
possible go-ahead try.
This key call shifted the mo
mentum of the game and allowed
Penn State to capitalize. The big,
physical Nittany Lions came right
back with a try and free kick to
push their lead to 38-29 and
scored a final try with three min
utes to go to put the game away.
Following the game, the play
ers were frustrated and upset
after only their second intercolle
giate loss. "It was there for the
taking but we just didn't take it,"

said senior fullback Bobby Blunt.
After Saturday's tough game,
Stanford was physically worn
down by the altitude of 7,000 feet
and stiff winds, but played an in
spired game against Navy to take
third place in the country. Stan
ford started out quick against the
Midshipmen, another strong,
physical team, scoring in the first
seven minutes and never relin
quishing the lead before winning,
35-14. After the devastating loss
to Penn State, Stanford played a
much improved game against
Navy, moving the ball well to out
play the Middies. Stanford con
trolled the ball and used crisp
passes and strong tackling in an
overall excellent team effort.
Nineteen ninety-six was a
breakthrough season for Stanford
rugby. In one of the most memo
rable games in recent Cardinal
history, Stanford defeated Cal in
Big Game for the first time in 16
years, 24-21. Following a change
in format to allow two West Coast
teams into the Final Four, Stan
ford avenged its only league loss,
defeating UC-Davis at Maloney
Field to take the Regional Cham
pionship and earn the right to
play in Colorado Springs.
