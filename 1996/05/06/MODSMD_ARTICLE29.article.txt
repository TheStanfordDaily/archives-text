# Women's Club celebrates 100 years
## 
### Melvina Cheung 
Imagine what life was like for a
woman at Stanford 50 or 100 years ago.
Going back through the years is one way
the Stanford University Women's Club
will celebrate its centennial anniversaiy.
"The centennial year has stimulated
our archival gathering. It's a year where
the group is seeing itself as a part of the
University's history," said Edythe Hick
man, the club historian.
In taped interviews which will be
placed in the Stanford archives, longtime
members bring women's journeys
through the past decades to life via per
sonal accounts, said Hickman. Members
also have been invited by the club to
write autobiographical essays on their
lives at Stanford and how they spend
their time as women at the end of the
20th century.
Other activities have included a cen
tennial celebration which was held in
February. Later this month, there will be
a reception to honor emeritae members.
The reception may include modeling of
fashions from the past 100 years, accord
ing to Hickman.
A hundred years after the founding of
the club by Jessie Knight Jordan, discus

sions, laughter and service are still the
basis of meetings, said Hickman.
"This organization has from time to
time inspired women to recognize the
needs of the community," said Norma
Fifer, current president of the club.
"These women provide a pool of interest
which often goes into civic and cultural
interests." During World Wars I and 11,
the members met to help the lied Cross
and the USO.
In addition, said Fifer, two members
of the club, Phyllis Craig and Dorothea
Almond, were fundamental in establish
ing child care services for graduate stu
dents. Craig and Almond also helped for
eign students by acquainting them with
the services of the loan closet, which
loans household goods to students.
For wives of faculty members mid vis
iting faculty, the club was founded pri
marily to provide a social outlet. In 1992,
the name of the club was changed from
the Stanford Faculty Women's Club to
Stanford University Women's Club to
better reflect the membership.
According to Fifer, joining the club
"was the most significant way in which I
could make friends coming in as a total
stranger."
Club members came to know each

other by participating in special-interest
groups within the club. In one such
group, the "Stitch and Chat"club, Hick
man said most of the women seem to
chat more than stitch.
Like many of the other sections of
the club, "Stitch and Chat" has been
around for about 50 years. Other inter
est sections include creative arts,
bridge, author's coffee, dinner dance
group and French and Italian conversa
tions.
Although some sections are well es
tablished, any member can start a new
section. Hickman said that in 1982, be
cause of her great interest in reading, she
helped set up the Rook Group. More than
a decade after its establishment, the
group is still running strong.
Members choose a book and discuss
issues related to the reading. Reflecting
the changing interests and activities of
women, two new sections were recently
added: travel and health and nutrition.
Women's issues, although not the
focus of the club, are discussed from time
to time and reflect the changing role of
women in society. In the 19605, the club
focused on second careers for women and
prepared "A Women's Selection Guide to
Continuing Education in the Bav Area."
