# Task force stresses victims' options
## Assault policy revised 
### Nadia Elghobashi Contributing writer 
A detailed description of the
resources available for sexual as
sault victims and the procedures
they should follow was released
last week in a draft policy by an ad
hoc task force on sexual assault.
The policy defines sexual as
sault, lists the consequences for
such offenses and gives victims of
sexual assault several options.
The new policy is a more "user
friendly" document, said Ira
Friedman, director of Cowell Stu
dent Health Services, who
chaired the task force.
The draft defines sexual as
sault as including — but not lim
ited to — "rape, forcible sodomy,
forcible oral copulation, sexual
assault with an object, sexual bat
tery, forcible fondling (e.g. un
wanted touching or kissing for
purposes of sexual gratification)
or threat of sexual assault."
Victims are provided a list of
contacts for medical treatment
and medical-legal advice, as well
as options for officially reporting
an incidence of sexual assault.
Despite the clarity of the new
policy, Friedman conceded there
will always be "subtleties" with a
subject like sexual assault. Fried
man noted that there are some
exceptions to confidentiality in
the document.
The policy states that "the de
gree to which confidentiality can
be protected depends upon the
professional role of the person
being consulted."
For instance, Friedman said,

although the identity of victims is
concealed, residence deans and
the dean of students are legally
obligated to report incidents of
sexual assault to the police for
statistical purposes.
Alejandro Martinez, director
of the Campus Sexual Assault Re
sponse and Recovery Team, said
the document emphasizes educa
tion as a means for reducing the
number of incidents of sexual as
sault.
"The policy is an affirmation
of the University's commitment
to education," Martinez said.
In the 1980s, most sexual as
sault education was done by stu
dents, Martinez said, whereas
today, the University is allocating
more resources so that profes
sionals can educate.
The University saw the need
for a revised policy in the summer
of 1994, he said, and decided it
needed a new policy which would
clarify its stance on the issue and
which would satisfy the require
ments set forth in a higher educa
tion amendment.
"From a legal standpoint, it
was necessary that Stanford
draft a new policy," said Fried
man.
Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds orga
nized an ad hoc task force com
prised of staff, students and fac
ulty.
The task force started work on
the policy in the fall of 1994, com
pleting the draft policy in April.
