# Engineers help introduce kids to science, technology
## 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Editorial staff 
Members of Stanford's Society of
Women Engineers hosted more than 100
children at a day-long program Saturday
intended to expose fourth- and fifth
graders to science and technology.
The program, titled "Exploring New
Worlds," included a variety of workshops
and a contest in which both teachers and
students could participate. The workshops
were presented by Stanford graduate stu
dents and professors.
The program was geared towards girls
and minorities, two groups who, according
to the society's president, Alisa Morss, are
usually discouraged from pursuing careers
in math and science.
"Without proper support from families
and resources from [their schools], under
privileged and minority children cannot de
velop an interest in these areas," said
Morss.
Funding for the day's events came from
Bechtel Corporation, which in 1995 had
sponsored a "diversity grant" for society
groups in California. Bechte.' awarded
$1,500 to a group of three StantoH stu
dents who proposed "Exploring i\w" r
Worlds."
According to Morss, "The grant would be
awarded to any team of students that came
up with an innovative program to increase
the diversity within the Society of Women
Engineers." Both boys and girls participat
ed in Satuday's events, although Morss esti
mated that girls accounted for about 75 per
cent of the children present.
Teachers were also invited to partici
pate, in an effort to prompt them to imple
ment the ideas presented during the day in
their own schools. Students and teachers
came from four local schools: Taft Elemen
tary School, Fair Oaks School, San Mateo
County Office of Education and Shule
Mandela.
Midway through the day, both teachers
and students expressed positive feelings
about the program.
"So far, we've learned about how things
freeze and things about a bicycle. We've

learned about the Internet," said Amanda
Delia Chiesa, a 10-year-old fourth-grader
from Taft Elementary School. "Right now
everyone's trying to build a tower with
marshmallows, and the tallest tower wins."
Ninette Hermosillo, a 10-year-old in the
fifth grade at Hawes School, said she con
sidered herself "really lucky" to be part of
programs such as "Exploring New
Worlds."
"We get to do a lot of stuff and learn a lot,
and it's really fun," said Hermosillo.

really like blood, and it has
responsibility, and I want
to do that.'

Many of the students said they antici
pate a career in science. "I want to be a doc
lor that delivers babies," said Hermosillo.
"I'm really interested in science, and I real
ly like blood, and it has responsibility, and I
want to do that."
Hermosillo's classmate, Karina Diaz,
also 10, said she would like to be a dentist.
"I want to be famous," she explained.
In addition to obtaining information
about what they can pursue in the future,
the children learned through the work
shops and the contest that they are al
ready capable of doing a great deal, Morss
said.
"It was a huge success," Morss said
about the entire day. "All the teachers told
me they really enjoyed it. When we asked
what we should do next year, they said,
'Please, just do it again.' "
"One teacher told me her kids were so
excited and had high expectations, and she
was so happy because she thought every
one of those expectations had been met,"
Morss added.
