# Supreme Court Justice helps out in annual competition
## Breyer judges in Moot Court 
### Timothy Kiefer Contributing writer 
Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer,
a 1959 Stanford graduate, returned to his
alma mater last weekend to judge the final
round of the Stanford Law School's 44th
annual Kirkwood Moot Court competition.
The team of Ara Lovitt and Colin
Moran won the competition, with the
team of Alan Smith and Diane Kelleher
taking second place.
The fictional case presented two consti

tutional law issues: whether a state can
retroactively apply a community notifica
tion law to released sex offenders and
whether a city can prohibit aggressive beg
ging-
The competition included both written
and oral components. Teams first wrote a
brief, which is a legal essay explaining why
their side should win the case. The com
petitors then took turns arguing their case
in front of judges, with the judges inter-
rupting each side's presentation
to ask questions.
"Justice Breyer was particu
larly aggressive in his question
ing, and that was fun," Moran
said. "He was acting the part of a
particularly active and mean
judge, and he played it well."
In remarks to the audience
after the arguments, Breyer said
he had to "reach into my vast
reservoir of incredibly mean,
nasty questions . . . thinking of
the worst possible things that I
could possibly imagine to say" in
an effort to determine which side
could respond best.
The final round was judged by
Breyer, Judge William Norris of
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit and California
Supreme Court Justice Kathryn
Mickle Werdegar.
By the time Lovitt and Moran
emerged victorious in the com
petition, which has lasted sever
al months, they had survived
four elimination rounds, argued
their case six times each and
spent "a couple of all-nighters in
a row" writing the briefs, Moran
said.
Breyer, a San Francisco na
tive, went to Stanford instead
of Harvard University because
his mother feared that he would
bury himself in books at Har
vard. At Stanford, he played
secretary general at a Model
United Nations conference and,
upon graduating, was only one

B away from a straight-A
record.
He also experienced the law
firsthand at the age of 19 when he
was arrested in San Francisco
with his Norwegian girlfriend for
ordering a glass of wine.
After studying at Oxford Uni
versity on a Marshall Scholar
ship, Breyer went to law school at
Harvard, graduating in 1964.
Before being nominated to the
nation's highest court in 1994,

Breyer worked as a U.S.
Supreme Court law clerk, Water
gate prosecutor, Harvard Law
School professor, U.S. Senate
counsel and U.S. Appeals Court
judge.
Breyer's visit marks the sec
ond time this academic year that
the justice has come to Stanford.
He and fellow Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
spoke at a panel discussion dur
ing last fall's Alumni Weekend.
