# Vigil at Quad commemorates hunger strike
## 
### Tienlon Ho 
Marking the second anniversary of
the Chicano / Latino hunger strike, a
group of students gathered for an open
candlelight vigil in the Quad Friday
night.
Seated in a small circle in front of
Memorial Church, the 15 participants
included members of the
Chicano / Latino student group,
MEChA, residents of the
Chicano / Latino theme dorm, Casa
Zapata, representatives of El Centro
Chicano and one of the five people who

fasted for three days in May 1994.
The participants discussed the caus
es of the strike, recent victories, in
cluding the development of a Chicano
Studies program, and the development
of new areas of concern.
"The truth comes out in the dark,"
one woman said when the discussion
turned to the original conflicts which
led up to the strike.
Members of Stanford's Chicano /
Latino community first began protest
ing when the University proposed
funding cuts to El Centro Chicano and
other campus ethnic centers early in

the 1993-94 academic year. The com
munity's dissatisfaction only increased
when Cecilia Burciaga, the highest
ranking Chicana administrator, was
asked to leave her position as resident
fellow of Casa Zapata and as associate
dean of student affairs.
After a short film about migrant
workers shown at Sunday Flicks trig
gered racial slurs among students in
the audience, members of the commu
nity decided to take action.
In May 1994, a crowd gathered in
the Quad to protest recent
events, with four students de
clining food for three days.
"There were three main is
sues for me personally," recalled
Lubia Sanchez, who participated
in negotiations two years ago
when she was a freshman. "I
wanted to see a Chicano Studies
program, the boycotting of
grapes and more representation
of the Chicano community in
Stanford staff."
A request for the establish

ment of a community center in
East Palo Alto also was among
the strikers' official demands.
After three intense days, the
strike ended when University
President Gerhard Casper and
Provost Condoleezza Rice signed
an agreement, promising that
the administration would fur
ther consider the possibility of a
ban on grapes and of implement
ing a Chicano Studies program.
They also promised to look at or
ganizing an East Palo Alto com
munity center. 112
With this year's campus-wide
vote over the grape policy and
swift approval of El Centra's
budget for next year,, partici

pants at Friday night's vigil
agreed there had been some
progress in the attitude of the
overall Stanford community.
But the mood mellowed once
more when junior Nerina Garcia
discussed recent setbacks in
work on the Chicano Studies pro
gram.
Dean of the School of Human
ities and Sciences John Shoven
recently rejected a proposal for
part of the program, pushing
back a vote on its implementa
tion by two months, Garcia said.
Some vigil participants saw
" 4he news as a political move
against the program while others
\viewed it more optimistically as a

security measure.
"Dean Shoven could be look
ing out for us, making sure that
we have a better chance to get
this thing approved in the end,"
Sanchez suggested.
The candlelight vigil was a
confirmation of identity and
pride in the Chicano / Latino
community and a remembrance
of the "civil disobedience" which
rocked the Stanford campus two
years ago, participants said.
"The strike was about a lot of
different issues, not just banning
grapes, but a history of things
against us," one man said. "We
opened Stanford's eyes to the
world."
