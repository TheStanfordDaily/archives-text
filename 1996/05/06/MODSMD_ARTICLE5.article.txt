# Vigil at Quad commemorates hunger strike

### Tienlon Ho 
Marking the second anniversary of
the Chicano / Latino hunger strike, a
group of students gathered for an open
candlelight vigil in the Quad Friday
night.
Seated in a small circle in front of
Memorial Church, the 15 participants
included members of the
Chicano / Latino student group,
MEChA, residents of the
Chicano / Latino theme dorm, Casa
Zapata, representatives of El Centro
Chicano and one of the five people who

fasted for three days in May 1994.
The participants discussed the caus

cluding the development of a Chicano
Studies program, and the development
of new areas of concern.
"The truth comes out in the dark,"
one woman said when the discussion
turned to the original conflicts which
led up to the strike.
Members of Stanford's Chicano /
Latino community first began protest

funding cuts to El Centro Chicano and
other campus ethnic centers early in

the 1993-94 academic year. The com

when Cecilia Burciaga, the highest
ranking Chicana administrator, was
asked to leave her position as resident
fellow of Casa Zapata and as associate
dean of student affairs.
After a short film about migrant
workers shown at Sunday Flicks trig
gered racial slurs among students in
the audience, members of the commu

In May 1994, a crowd gathered in
