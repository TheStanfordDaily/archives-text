# Shcherbak speaks on disaster at Chernobyl
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer 
Dr. Yuri Shcherbak, Ukraine's
ambassador to the United States,
spoke Friday on what he termed the
"greatest modern disaster" —
Chernobyl.
On April 26,1986, the engineers
at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant in the Soviet republic of
Ukraine withdrew the control rods
from the facility's No. 4 reactor to
test the plant's emergency control
systems. Instead, the reactor's cool
ing system and fail-safe devices
shut down. The control rods, built 1
meter shorter than reactor designs
had specified, could not be replaced.
The poorly trained engineers
looked on helplessly as the reactor
overheated and exploded, shower
ing 10,000 square kilometers with
radioactive particles. Airborne fall
out spread throughout northern
Europe, the United States and
Japan.
As a doctor working for the Kiev
Institute of Epidemiology and In
fectious Disease, Shcherbak was
among the first physicians to ar
rive at the site of the catastrophe.
Since the disaster, Shcherbak
has devoted his professional life to
Chernobyl and its victims.
Never a member of the Com
munist Party, Shcherbak founded
the Russian Green Movement and
was elected to the Congress of
People's Deputies in 1987. In that
post, he led an investigation into
the causes and aftermath of the
Chernobyl disaster.
In 1991, after the fall of commu
nism, Shcherbak was appointed
Ukraine's minister on environmen
tal protection. While serving in this
position, he was an outspoken critic
of his nation's handling of the Cher
nobyl crisis and aftermath.

The speech — sponsored by the
Center for Russian and East Euro
pean Studies, the Northern Califor
nia Committee to Aid Ukraine and
the Commonwealth Club of Cali
fornia — focused on his long-held
opposition to nuclear power.
"I was stricken with horror as I
realized that the development of
technology had reached a stage that
mankind could be destroyed by the
technology it created," Shcherbak
recalled of his first moments at
Chernobyl following the explosion.
Decrying what he called the su
premacy of the "technosphere over
all other aspects of human life,"
Shcherbak called on the scientific
community to exert moral responsi
bility.
There are currently 15 Cher
nobyl-type reactors operating in the
former Soviet Union, including
three at the Chernobyl facility.
These reactors continue to produce
40 percent of Ukraine's power sup
ply-
Ukraine announced unilaterally
that it would decommission the
Chernobyl plant by the year 2000
but appealed for international help
to prevent an energy shortage.
Ukraine currently spends 12
percent of its annual budget on pro
jects relating to Chernobyl.
Shcherbak stood firm in the
face of heated questioning on the
safety of nuclear power. Although
conceding the primary agent of
the Chernobyl disaster was the
communist system, the ambas
sador cited übiquitous dangers in
herent in nuclear power.
"On my numerous visits to the
[Chernobyl] area, I was stricken
with a specific order of death,"
Shcherbak said. "May God save
mankind from nuclear apocalypse.
May He save us from another Cher
nobyl."
