The bachelor's degree program in East Asian
Studies will not be renewed after the 1997-98 acade
mic year if the recommendation of two University
committees is approved by the Faculty Senate.
The East Asian Studies program, which currently
has 10 undergraduate majors, was one of several in
terdisciplinary programs in the School of Humanities
and Sciences reviewed this year, said Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education Ramon Saldivar.
"The main reason for that recommendation was
because it is a program that has not been able to suc
cessfully draw very many students," Saldivar said.
"We felt it duplicates the efforts in place in both in
ternational relations and in Asian languages."
"It seemed that there was substantial overlap with
other programs," said Psychology Prof. Anne Fer
nald, chair of the senate's Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies. Students interested in East Asian Stud
ies will be able to "do exactly as they have been doing"
despite the change, she said, because the existence of
the program had been "recycling the same courses
and the same advisers."
The Humanities and Sciences Curriculum Com
mittee and the Committee on Undergraduate Studies
both approved the suggestion. The Center for East
Asian Studies, which administers the program, will
continue to offer a master's degree in East Asian
Studies and is developing an undergraduate minor.
History Prof. Peter Duus, director of the Center
for East Asian Studies, said he will appeal the deci
sion. The East Asian Studies major provides a differ
ent and more comprehensive approach than either
international relations or Asian languages could pro
vide. he said.
