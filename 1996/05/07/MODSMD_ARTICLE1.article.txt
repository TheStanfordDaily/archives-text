# An uncertain future
## East Asian Studies may also see end

The bachelor's degree program in East Asian
Studies will not be renewed after the 1997-98 acade
mic year if the recommendation of two University
committees is approved by the Faculty Senate.
The East Asian Studies program, which currently
has 10 undergraduate majors, was one of several in
terdisciplinary programs in the School of Humanities
and Sciences reviewed this year, said Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education Ramon Saldivar.
"The main reason for that recommendation was
because it is a program that has not been able to suc
cessfully draw very many students," Saldivar said.
"We felt it duplicates the efforts in place in both in
ternational relations and in Asian languages."
"It seemed that there was substantial overlap with
other programs," said Psychology Prof. Anne Fer
nald, chair of the senate's Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies. Students interested in East Asian Stud
ies will be able to "do exactly as they have been doing"
despite the change, she said, because the existence of
the program had been "recycling the same courses
and the same advisers."
The Humanities and Sciences Curriculum Com
mittee and the Committee on Undergraduate Studies
both approved the suggestion. The Center for East
Asian Studies, which administers the program, will
continue to offer a master's degree in East Asian
Studies and is developing an undergraduate minor.
History Prof. Peter Duus, director of the Center
for East Asian Studies, said he will appeal the deci
sion. The East Asian Studies major provides a differ
ent and more comprehensive approach than either
international relations or Asian languages could pro
vide. he said.
In the international relations
program, for instance, Duus said,
language requirements are not
tied to area of concentration, so a
student could focus on modern
Chinese politics but study Por
tuguese. Asian languages provides
the in-depth language study but
makes it harder for students to
look at society or culture, he said.
Asst. History Prof. Ellen
Neskar, resident fellow in the East
Asian Studies Theme House, said
the overall picture provided by an
East Asian Studies major could
not be captured elsewhere. She
noted that while international re
lations focuses on political science,
economics and history, East Asian
Studies incorporates anthropolo
gy, religious studies and philoso
phy.
"There's a need for people to be
able to do a multidisciplinary pro
gram," she said.
East Asian Studies majors had
a similar reaction.
"If someone was interested in
East Asian Studies, it would be
hard to carve out a niche between
Asian languages and international
relations," said coterminal stu
dent Ed Jen, who is working to
ward a bachelor's degree in eco

nomics and a master's degree in
East Asian Studies.
Jen said he had been an inter
national relations major but
found "it wasn't fulfilling my
goals."

'We felt that one
could do the kind of
majors and degree
programs done in
East Asian Studies
with very little mod
ification, depend
ing on whether you
wanted to do policy
or culture.'

The master's program in East
Asian Studies will continue to
exist, Duus said. In addition, an
undergraduate minor in East
Asian Studies is being developed
Junior Jennifer Usyak and se
nior Rachel Mall were also con
cerned about the decision.
Hall said she originally de

clared her major in Asian lan
guages but decided she wanted
more than the humanities focus it
offered.
Usyak considered both the
Asian languages and international
relations programs before decid
ing on East Asian Studies. "It fit
me better," she said.
The decision not to renew the
East Asian Studies bachelor's pro
gram was made because programs
overlapped, Saldivar said, not be
cause of funding.
"We felt that one could do the
kind of majors and degree pro
grams done in East Asian Studies
with very little modification, de
pending on whether you wanted to
do policy or culture," he said.
Because the East Asian Studies
program is run by the center, the
decision will have no impact on ei
ther funding or faculty, Duussaid.
"This program is costing noth
ing because it's administered by
the Center for East Asian Stud
ies," he said. Funding for the cen
ter comes from specially endowed
money and from the federal gov
ernment.
"What it does affect is students
who have a particular interest and
will now not be able to satisfy that
interest," Duus said. "What's
being hurt here is the undergrad
uate students' interest in this
field, which is, after all, why we're
here."
