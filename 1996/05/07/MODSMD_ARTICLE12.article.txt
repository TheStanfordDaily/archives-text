Colby's body found
ROCK POINT, Md. (AP) — After an eight-day
search involving divers, dogs and sonar equipment,
the body of former CIA Director William Colby was
found facedown in a marshy riverbank yesterday,
near where he disappeared on a canoe outing.
Authorities said the 76-year-old retired spy
master was probably alive when he fell into the
water and suffered hypothermia and drowned.
There were no marks on the body to indicate foul
play, Sheriff Fred Davis said.
"There is nothing unusual about this case at
all," he said.
Colby, whose family owns a waterfront vaca
tion home in this southern Maryland town, had
been missing since April 27, when he told his wife
by phone that he was going canoeing. She was out
of town at the time.

New prostate treatment found
WASHINGTON (AP) — Millions of men who
suffer enlarged prostates now can choose a one
hour treatment over drugs or surgery: a machine
that literally microwaves the prostate to relieve
urinary symptoms.
The Food and Drug Administration approved
the Prostatron, which kills excess prostate tissue
by heating the gland with microwaves, based on
studies showing it may help 75 percent of patients.
"While not a cure, it effectively treats the
symptoms" of enlarged prostates, FDA Commis
sioner David Kessler said yesterday.
The Prostatron is a one-hour, outpatient pro
cedure that appears to work better than drugs
and clearly is safer than surgery, said Dr. John
Lynch, urology chief at Georgetown University
Medical Center.
