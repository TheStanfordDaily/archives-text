# Gas tax may be repealed
## Democrats call for temporary repeal of 1993 increase 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen
ate Democrats conceded yester
day that a temporary repeal of the
1993 gasoline tax increase is
unavoidable, and Republican
leaders prepared to tap the
nation's savings institutions to
pay for it.
Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole said the Senate could vote as
soon as today on the tax cut,
which he proposed less than two
weeks ago. He planned to discuss
the timing, as well as a Democrat
ic proposal to raise the minimum
wage, with Senate Minority Lead
er Tom Daschle.
"We think (it) is inevitable,"
Daschle, D-S.D., said. Itepubli

cans are "in the majority. They
have the votes to pass legisla
tion."
The leading proposal for pay
ing for the cut, according to
House and Senate aides, was sep
arate legislation that strengthens
the government fund insuring
savings and loan deposits.
That plan requires a one-time
premium payment from S&Ls,
and, under budget rules, the
money can be used to offset the
tax cut. GOP leaders also are look
ing at a cut in Energy Secretary
Hazel O'Leary's travel budget.
The Clinton administration
supports the S&L legislation and
Daschle said "I'm not necessarily

averse" to using it to cut the gas
tax.
Republican leaders are push
ing hard for the repeal, which is
seen as having wide popular
appeal. Dole, Clinton's rival in the
presidential race, notes repeated
ly that the tax increase was
approved "without a single
Republican vote."
Many Democrats are criticiz
ing the tax cut, saying it could
amount to a windfall for the oil
companies who pay the tax and
ultimately pass it on to the con
sumer. And environmentalists
maintain the tax cut would
encourage more energy consump
tion and hurt the environment.
