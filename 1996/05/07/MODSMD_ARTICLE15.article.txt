ASSU, University have
worked well to install
emergency-phone system

Although bicycle theft
is the most widespread
crime on campus, Stanford
students cannot take safety for
granted. Last week, thanks to lob
bying by student representatives
and quick response from adminis
trators, the University concurred
and agreed to begin the installa
tion of emergency phones
throughout the campus.
For a University known to sit
on reports and recommendations
for years without taking action,
its speed on this issue is
admirable. Although safety has
been a concern for a long time,
Stanford has remained far behind
other campuses in preventive
measures like prominent emer
gency phones; in the near future,
the Farm will start to catch up.
Specifically, in response to an
ASSU campus safety report pre
pared last year, Stanford has
promised to install 75 phones in
strategic locations around campus
over the next three years. The
University has already allocated
$300,000 for the equipment, and
the first 19 will be installed this
summer.
Topped with flashing blue
lights, the 9-foot-tall units will
require only the push of a button
to call police. Dialing 9-911 for
help — something which can be
too time-consuming in the midst
of a crisis — will soon be a thing of
the past.
At the very least, a campus
filled with dozens of prominent
emergency phones should make
its members feel more secure, and
should also serve as a crime deter
rent. They should also make visi
tors aware that campus safety is a
top concern here at Stanford, even
though the Farm is considered

immune to crime.
The University deserves credit
for acting so quickly on this issue,
which was brought up in an ASSU
student safety report issued last
year. By the time the first 19
phones are installed in September,
just a year will have passed from
the beginning of the process. In
the words of one person involved,
Stanford Police Lt. Del Bandy,
"That's an unbelievably short
amount of time."
Credit is also due to the ASSU,
and in particular Deputy Senate
Chair Bill Shen, who was instru
mental in writing the original
report and lobbying the University
to implement the changes it pro
posed. After a year spent debating
issues like whether it should pur
chase Pepsi products, at least the
senate can point to this one tangi
ble accomplishment, which Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
mentioned at his "Tea and More
Cookies Forum" last week.
Furthermore, it was accom
plished through the right process:
The ASSU analyzed the situation
and approached the University
through established channels with
its specific proposals. No surprise,
then, that Stanford was so recep
tive.
In the future, the ASSU should
look at why it was successful here
and refocus its efforts. It's not too
complicated — there was a report
done on campus safety, specific
proposals were formed and the
University was contacted and lob
bied.
Just think what could be done if
the entire senate were to work
under this mindset from day one;
we're sure that University ser
vices could improve if our repre
sentatives put their mind to it.
With the passage of Constitu
tion '96, the ASSU could soon
undergo a much-needed renewal.
But a new constitution won't
solve all problems — the students'
representatives need to take the
initiative themselves.
To the members of the next
senate: Dining Services is waiting.
