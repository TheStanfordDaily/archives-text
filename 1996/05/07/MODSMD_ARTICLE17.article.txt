## Ytalk amongst yourselves 
### 
4 P O DID YOU have a good talk with
my friend asked. I blushed,
embarrassed at being caught
ytalking. (Ytalking is a poor imitation of
communication, misspelling words on
screen). Then I realized that I hadn't told
my friend about the conversation at all.
"You talked to him at 7 p.m., for about
an hour, from your dorm cluster," he
added. I demanded to know his source,
what private eye had been tracking me.
"That's for me to know and for you to
find out," he said. After I slapped him
around, he revealed the origins of his
knowledge: a bit of UNIX gimmickry, the
"what" command. With a single
keystroke, strangers can find out where
you are, how long you've been logged on,
and what you're doing at the time. Yet,
there's an even more common sort of
bloodhound sniffing you out.
"He hasn't responded" another friend
said. "And he's checked his mail. I fin
gered him. What does this mean?"
Hmm ... it means he hates you and
doesn't want to deal with you. It means he
was on his way to class and didn't have
time to respond. It means that space
aliens abducted him, spoiling any chance
you have with him. "Fingering" only gives
you enough information to make you anx
ious and paranoid. Sit back and wait for
the reason / excuse. Unless, of course,
you're willing to make the effort to pick
up the telephone or to talk in person.
Don't get me wrong. I like e-mailing

my friends and family, and do a l'il jig
when I see "You have new mail." I'm su. -3
that these commands serve some sort of
purpose. But people may forget how to
use these resources reasonably. "Stanford
expects each person affiliated with the
University to be a responsible user. ...
Students will be held accountable for
their conduct under the Fundamental
Standard." Unfortunately, beyond the
usual frantic fingering, there have been
several cases of on-line violations on cam
pus, from forged e-mail to sexual harass
ment. This abusive and irresponsible
usage invades privacy.
I'm no a neo-Luddite ready to throw
wooden shoes at Amy or Elaine or Adel
bert. We shouldn't rage against the
inevitable. I read an article recently about
a family — fittingly named the Savages —
who chucked the television, radio, the
refrigerator. Instead of listening to the
music, they check out song books from
the library. Since they had nothing to
compare their voices to, the father said,
they didn't feel self-conscious about
singing. I have another alternative: play
ing the stereo so loud enough to drown
out my impromptu karaoke. However, I
question that which isolates rather than
brings together.
Take Caller ID. First heralded as an
efficient means to screen calls and crank
callers, the technology came under attack
as a violation of privacy. Some women's
shelters reasoned that abusive husbands

would have access to their wives' where
abouts through this service. In order to
preserve this service (and their profits),
the telephone company is offering a ser
vice that allows users to shortcut Caller
ID. They're blocking their own punches.
Or, as the They Might Be Giants song
goes, "A snake head eating a snake head
on the opposite side," a subversive palin
drome.
These contortions reminds me of an
ancient mystical Chinese art of feng shui.
Careful placement of furniture and the
home all effect the happiness and pros
perity of the of the household. Mirrors
above the front door ward ofT evil spirits.
Offices in Hong Kong have taken feng
shui into the modern business world.
Gleaming brass plaques, etched with the
company name, have taken the place of
mirrors. Across the street, buildings retal
iate with even larger, shinier signs. Walk
ing down the boulevard, you are attacked
by the evil spirits bouncing off the build
ings.
Someone once said, "If I put two mir
rors across from each other, I could see
infinity. But my head gets in the way."
Maybe we should take a look at each
other.
