University is not justified in ban of skateboarding

I WAS DISGUSTED but not surprised
to read Steven Smith's letter describ
ing how he and another skateboarder
were hassled by the police for riding
their skateboards on campus. Skate
boarding is fun, stylish and easy on the
environment, yet it never fails to offend
the aesthetic sensibilities of the yuppies
who run this campus. The fact that
skateboarding is illegal but the architects
who designed Tresidder Union continue
to menace society is pretty much par for
the course.
It might be argued that skateboarding
has been banned for reasons other than
the fact that administrators don't like the

way many skaters look, but I don't find
that particularly persuasive. If they are
really worried about property damage,
why are in-line skates spared? The acro
batic antics of professors' children on
their rollerblades have left marks all over
the ramps between Green and Meyer. An
ordinance meant to protect property
should address specific property-damag
ing behaviors, not simply ban an imple
ment that could be used for that purpose
If the University is worried about
safety, how can they legitimately distin
guish between the risks posed by skate
boards and those that result from out-of
control rollerbladers or psychotic

cyclists? Anyone really concerned with
safety would either penalize all of these
modes of transportation or require pro
tective gear. Are we trying to keep
unruly non-Stanford people off campus?
Because if we are, it makes no sense to
penalize Stanford students on skate
boards, or to discriminate among visitors
to campus depending on whether they
walked onto campus or rode a skate
board. Selective treatment of skateboard
ers isn't really meant to protect anyone
or anything; it simply supports the unre
markable observation that cops hate
skateboards.
I think it is incumbent upon the Stan

ford administration to attempt to change
any anti-skating ordinances. Failing
that, they should order Stanford police
not to enforce such ordinances, at the
very least against card-carrying members
of the Stanford community. The good
news is that even in the likely event that
they do nothing, skateboarders are much
faster and more nimble when it comes to
negotiating the campus landscape than
cops in cruisers. I certainly don't plan to
mothball my skateboard, and they can
"confiscate" when they pry it from my
insensate fingers!
