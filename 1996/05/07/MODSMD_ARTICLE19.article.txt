# University has sound reasons for opposing skateboards, prof says
## 
### 
While I sympathize with Steven
Smith's unfortunate adventures with
the campus police, I suspect that the
University's ban on skateboarding rests
on some practical grounds. High-school
ers performing skateboard acrobatics

(involving sonorous landings) have too
often disturbed teaching in the neigh
borhood of the political science depart
ment. There may be a fear as well of
broken bones and (frivolous) lawsuits.
Our students should evidently not be
harassed, and indeed skateboards are
legitimate means of transportation. 1
hope that some common-sense compro
mise can be found between individual
and institutional needs.
