# Affirmative action has helped create diverse faculty, Weisberg says
## 
### 
Friday's article on the Faculty Sen
ate meeting misattributes to me the
statement that "increasing the diver
sity of faculty was not a product of
affirmative action."
I unequivocally said that affirma

tive action was one cause but not the
sole cause of achieving a reasonable
diversity in the faculty â€” that non
discrimination by itself will move us
somewhat in the right direction, but
not very far and not very fast. Obvi
ously, our faculty would be far less
diverse than it is today without affir
mative action.
