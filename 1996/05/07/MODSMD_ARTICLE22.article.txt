Q m How does a smoke detector
work?
AEeeeeeeee! There are two different
• types of smoke detectors — photo
-electric detectors and ionization
detectors. The most common type is the ion
ization type, which is the type commonly
sold in hardware stores.
Both types of detectors sense smoke by
different methods, so they detect different
types of smoke better. And if you're won
dering, there really are different types of
smoke. You've got your hazy, almost
invisible smoke which comes from cleaner
burning fires, like those found from
grease fires or leaky furnaces, and then
you've got the thick, noxious, cloudy
smoke you get with smoldering fires, typ
ically created from fireplaces, burning
upholstery and torrid love affairs. Oh,
wait, scratch that last one, unless you've

seen "Like Water for Chocolate."
The ionization detectors are better at
detecting the first type of smoke, and the
photoelectric ones are better at the second
type of smoke.
There are two types of photoelectric
detectors, but they both work on the same
principle. In one version, a light shines on a
light-sensitive sensor in the smoke detector.
When smoke gets inside, it blocks the light
and the sensor notices this and sets off the
alarm. This detector is based on the follow
ing principle: "You can't see through smoke,
and when there's smoke, there's fire!
There's a fire, stupid! Run away!"
The other type of photoelectric detector
also has a light-sensitive sensor inside of
it, but the sensor is used differently. The
light inside of the detector is shined right
past the sensor, but not on to it. When
smoke enters the detector, it reflects some
of the light on to the sensor. The sensor
notices that light is now shining on it, so it
sets off the alarm. The principle behind
this mechanism is: "You can see smoke,
and when there's smoke, there's fire.

There's a fire, stupid! Run away!"
The ionization detector is slightly more
complicated. Inside each detector is a small
amount of radioactive material, typically
Americium oxide, which contains Americi
um-241. Americium-241 emits two types of
radiation, alpha radiation and gamma radi
ation. The smoke detector depends on the
alpha radiation released by the Americium.
The alpha radiation ionizes the air inside
of the smoke detector. This means that the
molecules in air become electrically charged
when exposed to the alpha radiation. Inside
the smoke detector, this ionized air con
ducts a current across a small gap. Typical
ly, air is uncharged so it can't conduct, but
when it Ls ionized, the charged particles can
move across the gap and conduct electricity.
When smoke gets into the machine, it
attaches to the ionized air molecules and
lowers the conductivity of the air in the gap.
The smoke detector notices that less cur
rent is making it through the gap and sets
off the alarm.
The principle behind this detector is:
"The smoke and the radioactive stuff do

that thing, and then ... what do you care
how I work? By the time you figure it out,
you'll be dead! There's a fire, stupid! Run
away!"
I've noticed smoke detectors are quite
condescending. I think they get some kind
of ego trip from that life-saving thing. Just
like those arrogant jerks on "Baywatch."
I'm not done yet, though. If you've been
paying attention, you're probably wonder
ing if the radiation from the smoke detector
is going to kill you or give you cancer. A lot
of people, when they hear that there are
radioactive materiiils inside of their smoke
detectors get very worried and start pacing
around and then get paranoid and then set
fire to their furniture. So it's a good thing
that they have smoke detectors.
More rational people know that there's
nothing to be worried about. Alpha radia
tion is mostly harmless; it can't travel more
than a few inches through air.
Gamma radiation, however, is a little
more dangerous, though not in the case of
the smoke detector. Gamma radiation, like
X-rav radiation, is electromagnetic radia

tion. Gamma radiation is of higher energy
than X-rays so it is more dangerous. The
amount of gamma radiation given off by a
typical smoke detector is minuscule,
though.
At a distance of 1 meter — about 3 feet,
for those of you who don't speak metric —
the amount of gamma radiation you receive
from a smoke detector is 3,000 times less
than the amount you get from natural
sources around you. And there isn't even a
need to worry about accidentally breaking
open the tamper-proof casing for the Ameri
cium and ingesting it. Reportedly, a worker
in a factory swallowed two of the radioactive
pieces and was still not exposed to danger
ous levels of radiation.
So, your smoke detector really is quite
safe.
Eeeeeeeee!
This has been a test of the emergency
broadcast system. If this had been a real
emergency.... Run away!
