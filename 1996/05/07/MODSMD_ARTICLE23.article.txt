## No. 9 Cardinal to take on Broncos Stanford looks to extend season-long, 10-game win streak tonight 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
The No. 9 Stanford baseball
team will put its 12-game winning
streak on the line tonight when
the Cardinal faces Santa Clara
(36-18 overall, 19-5 in the West
Coast Conference) at Sunken Dia
mond. Wednesday, Stanford (35-
i7, 19-11 in the Pacific-10 South
ern Division) will host another
Bay Area rival, hosting Saint
Mary's (12-33, 7-17 in the WCC).
The Cardinal's current win
streak is its longest since a 15-game
tear during the 1990 season. In its
past dozen games — which includ
ed nine consecutive conference vic
tories — Stanford has put up im
pressive team totals. Coach Mark
Marquess' team outscored its oppo
nents 112-38, hit at a .345 clip and
pitched mi ERA of 2.92.
Leading the way at the plate has
been junior first baseman Luke
Quaccia, who entered the starting
lineup March 30 after Troy Kent
fouled a ball off his foot the previous
night. In the last 12 games, Quaccia
has hit .481 with one home run and
16 runs batted in. The transfer
from Modesto Junior College
wrapped up the Six-Pac season with
seven hits against California pitch
ing to finish with a .440 conference
batting average.
Stanford's pitching has also been
stellar over the stretch of wins, led
by starters Kyle Peterson and Chad
Hutchinson. Both right-handers
are 3-0 with ERAs of 2.63 since the
streak began. Peterson (8-5) and
Hutchinson (7-1) earned complete
game victories against Cal this past
weekend, as the Cardinal swept the
Golden Bears.
For his efforts, Hutchinson was
named Pac-10 Southern Division
Pitcher of t he Week. The freshman
from Del Mar, Calif, also won the
honor in the week of April 1 after
notching victories over Nevada and
Arizona.
Santa Clara enters tonight's
contest as the leader in the WCC
standings. The two teams played a
three-game series in Februiuy with
the Cardinal winning two of three.
In the first game, played at the
Bronco's Buck Shaw Stadium, Pe
terson pitched the Cardinal to a 10-
4 victoiy. On Saturday at Sunken
Diamond Stanford won 11-1 before
falling 2-1 on Sunday at Santa
Clara.

Junior Brendan Sullivan sends in a side-arm delivery earlier this year. The Cardinal will take on Santa
Clara tonight at Sunken Diamond.
"Santa Clara is a pretty good
team," Peterson said. "They are a
cross-town rival and there's still
something to prove with them, so
we'd like to come out and stick it to
them."
Marquess will send senior Mario
Iglesias (8-1) to the mound tonight
to face the Broncos. Iglesias, who
came into the season with a career
record of 5-4, has pitched well in
both a starting and relief role this
year. Iglesias picked up the win in a
8-0 victory over Saint Mary's in
early March. The right-hander from

Hayward, Calif, played an integral
role in the Cardinal's post-season
success last year, throwing a com
plete-game five-hitter in Stanford's
3-2 win over Texas Tech in the Mid
west I Regional.
Iglesias is likely to see more post
season action this year, as the Car
dinal has put itself in the position to
receive a favorable seed when
NCAA pairings are announced May
20. Stanford's Sunken Diamond is
being considered as one of the eight
host-sites for the regional tourna
ments. The Cardinal's recent suc
cess and its second-place finish in
the Six-Pac may make Stanford a
desirable site for NCAA play. Re
gional sites will be announced by the
NCAA next Monday.
