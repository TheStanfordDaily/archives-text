# Are there any NCAA titles in the future?

### 
May 7, 1996 — just one
month left on the job.
And as anyone who's
ever borne the burden of sports
editor during spring quarter
will tell you, that means basi
cally three things for reigning
editors Todd Bernstein and
myself. First of all, it means we
need to start scrambling for
someone to fill our shoes when
The Daily resumes work in the
fall. Second, with every varsity
sport but baseball, track, golf
and tennis either at or ap
proaching the end of its sea
son, we need to start getting
extremely creative in finding
ways to fill this page.
But there is one perk to edit
ing during winter and spring
quarter — we get to choose
what sport we'd like to cover
when the fall rolls around.
As we all know by now,
Stanford athletics in 1995-96
failed to live up to the lofty ex
pectations created by the suc
cess of last year, when the Car
dinal brought home a record
tying five national titles. This
year, only women's swimming
has captured a championship
and things don't look promis
ing from here on out.
Both tennis squads are
among the two best in the
country, but the men will have
their hands full trying to stop a
loaded UCLA team at NCAAs.
Ditto for the Cardinal women
and top-ranked Florida. And
while baseball has been on a
tear of late, it takes nothing
short of a miracle to win the
grueling postseason tourna
ment that is the College World
Series.
As a result, we can't help
but turn our attention to next
year, when several varsity
sports will be returning key
players and shooting for a na
tional crown.
So what'll it be?
Todd and ex-sports editor
Courtney Mann have already
called dibs on football, so Fm
still trying to size up the rest of
my options. Let's take a look at
some of the most promising
possibilities, shall we?
Basketball: There's little
doubt that 1996-97 has the po
tential to be the most exciting
season in the history of Stan

ford hoops. The men return
All-American candidate Brevin
Knight and a solid group of
freshmen in Mark Seaton, Art
Lee, Peter Sauer and Kris
Weems. Combine that with the
return of redshirt sophomore
and potential All-Pac-10 cen
ter Tim Young, transfer Pete
Van Elswyk, forward Rich
Jackson and hot-shot recruit
Ryan Mendez, and Mike Mont
gomery's squad suddenly has
more than enough weapons to
advance past the second round
of the NCAA tournament.
On the women's side, the
Cardinal absorbs virtually no
losses from a team that went
undefeated in Pac-10 play for
the first time since 1988 and
advanced to the Final Four.

Bobbie Kelsey and Amy Wuste
feld are gone to graduation,
but Kelsey didn't even play in
the second half of the season
after suffering an injury to her
ACL and Wustefeld con
tributed only in a reserve role.
With the return of Olympic
coach Tara VanDerveer and
1996 head coach Amy Tucker,
the women will be a favorite to
challenge for the national title.
Soccer: The future looks
bright for both the men's and
women's programs with the
addition of former New
Zealand National Team coach
Bobby Clark, who will oversee
both programs and serve as
head coach for the men. Clark
is respected and well-liked by
players and should turn
around a men's team that was
baffiingly ineffectual last sea
son. The women should also
bounce back strong next year
despite the loss of senior stand
outs Jessica Fischer and
Carmel Murphy.
Volleyball: After looking
like the nation's best team for


Bobby
