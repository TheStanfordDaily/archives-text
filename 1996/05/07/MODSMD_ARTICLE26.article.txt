# Men's rugby caps off stellar '96 campaign
## Seniors lead the way for most successful Cardinal season in recent years 
### Tomoeh Murakami 
Although the season closed for
the Stanford men's rugby team,
their everlasting friendships and
memories will continue on forever.
The 1996 season ended for the
Stanford men's rugby team this
weekend with a 35-14 victory over
Navy that placed the squad third in
the Final Four at Colorado Springs.
The Stanford men experienced a tri
umphant season, losing only two in
tercollegiate games and bringing the
Axe back with the first victory over
Cal in 16 years.
This year, 14 seniors and fifth -
year co-terms will be leaving one of
the strongest teams Stanford has
ever fielded. The nine starters leav
ing the team this year include cap
tain and flanker Jeff Siemon, prop
Joe Clayton, lock Scott Whitt, full
back Bobby Blunt, eight-man Jared
Hopkins, inside-center Chris Gras
so, scram-half Shin Inoue, scrum
half Tinuir Yarnall and hooker Jeff
Freund. Other key players graduat
ing this year are Nicholas Murat,
Patrick Scott, Shervin Malekzadeh,
Scott Foster and Craig Thompson,
who filled in for the many injured
players over the course of the sea
son.
Seimon, Blunt and Clayton
earned spots on the All-American
team last year and are invited to try
out again this year along with Hop
kins and Yarnall. Sophomore lock
Jeremy Toner and junior flanker
TrungNgo will join the graduating
teammates at the try-outs in Ohio
State from June 3 through June 8.
The chosen players are scheduled
to practice on the All-American
team for a week starting June 8. The
All-American team will leave for
Australia on Aug. 2 and will have the
opportunity to meet up with the
Stanford team that will be touring
in Australia around the same time,
playing against collegiate and na
tional teams there. Most graduating
seniors will participate in the tour
this summer.
Graduating players reflect on the
years with the Stanford team with
strong feelings.
"I know that a lot of my team

mates will bo my friends for life,"
said Inoue, an international student
from Japan.
The team's affinity is symbolized
by coach Frank Boviert, who has
been coaching both the men's and
women's teams for eight years.
"The best thing about playing on
the team is the association with all
the guys, especially Frank," Blunt
said. "We have more than a coach
player relationship with Frank. He
studies everything he teaches us, he
has gone over it well, and works with
us in learning the game. All the guys
appreciate his sharing with us what
is important to him, and enjoy learn
ing from him."
"His coaching is such that we
learn from him that rugby is parallel
to life," said Ngo. If the seniors de
cide to stay on campus for gradua

tion and commencement on June 15
and 16, which falls during the All-
American team practice week, then
Ngo will forego trying out.
"I learned more than rugby from
playing. Frank taught us to play for
our jerseys and nothing else," Hop
kins said. Hopkins grew up playing
football and played for the Stanford
football team during his freshman
and sophomore years.
"When I play [rugby] with these
guys, I don't feel like winning is
everything." says Hopkins. "I didn't
feel like this or learn what Frank
taught us when I was growing up as
a football player."
Stanford rugby has a tradition of
playing against the University of
Victoria, which is considered to be
the best team in Northern America.
"We play them and get creamed,

but it's just a phenomen.il match,"
said Hopkins. "It is our test of
courage and a huge challenge. This
great experience taught me that re
lying on teammates can continue to
occur whether you win or lose. I'm
going to miss playing for Stanford
with the greatest teammates."
"I'm really going to miss the se
niors," Toner said. "They are the
greatest guys I've ever played with.
But I know I'll be seeing them play
ing at alumni games and supporting
us at playoffs."
Although the '96 Stanford squad
will no longer train as a team, they
are sure to be seen enjoying each
other's company. "The team will
have a few more social events. There
won't be any more playing, but we
will definitely keep on having fun,"
said Blunt.
