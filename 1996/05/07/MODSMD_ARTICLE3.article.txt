Four months after becoming the first per
son with Down's syndrome to receive a heart
and lung transplant, Sandra Jensen was re
leased from Stanford Hospital on Friday night.
Stanford Medical Center spokeswoman
M.A. Malone, who confirmed that Jensen was
released at 9:30 p.m., said the 35-year-old
Sacramento resident will continue to live with
her mother in an apartment on campus for
some time while receiving out-patient care.
Because of the nature of the case, Malone
said it was not possible to tell for certain how
long Jensen would have to stay near the hospi
tal.
"There are just so many variables," Malone
explained.
Down's syndrome is a genetic disease
which often causes heart problems, mental

retardation and short-life expectancy. A little
over a year ago, doctors told Jensen that her
heart and lungs were failing and that she
would die within two years without a trans
plant.

A little over a year ago, doc
tors told Jensen that her heart
and lungs were failing and
that she would die within two
years without a transplant.

Initially, both the Stanford and UC-San
Diego Medical Centers turned down Jensen's
transplant request because of her disability,
saying she was not mentally equipped to deal

with the potential complications of a transplant.
But Stanford reconsidered the decision
after lobbying from the State Department of
Developmental Services and from Jensen her
self, who is an advocate for disabled persons
and has lived by herself since she was 20.
The Office of Civil Rights in the U.S. De
partment of Health and Human Services also
said Jensen's rejection was in violation of the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
Jensen was placed on the waiting list in Jan
uary and received the operation only a week
later when she was found to be the only suit
able recipient for the available organs.
Bruce Reitz, the doctor who operated on
Jensen, performed the first combined heart
lung transplant in 1981 at Stanford. Since
then, Stanford has seen more than 100 such
operations, including 1(5 in 1995. About 70 of
the operations are performed each year in the
United States.
