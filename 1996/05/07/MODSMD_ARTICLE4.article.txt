## Study finds pressure on college athletes may cause serious psychological trauma Focus on Science 
### Julie Choe Contributing writer 
A new study by a Stanford Med
ical Center researcher suggests
that for some college athletes, the
intensity of competition and the
strain of academic pressure can
lead to severe psychological stress,
including depression and even sui
cide.
The study, which was conduct
ed by Psychiatry Prof. Hans Stein
er, involved more than 1,000 high
school athletes and several hun
dred college athletes. The results
were presented last month at a
conference titled, "High School
and College Student Athletes â€”
Risks and Benefits: The Good, the
Bad and the Unexpected."
"The main message is that peo
ple assumed that doing sports has
some risk in injury but nothing
further," said Steiner. "We're
sounding a cautionary note that
it's not so simple. The ability to
focus in on things really increases
in the [college athlete] population,
but it's the very thing that puts
them at risk."
The research project included

detailed surveys of students at a
Northern California high school in
1993 and at a major university in
1995. The study showed that high
school athletes consistently out
performed their less active class
mates on a variety of psychological
and physical tests. The only excep
tion was a small group of high
school students with psychiatric
problems.
In general, team sports seem to
give an advantage to most high
school students, but this benefit
does not translate into the same
advantage in college, Steiner said.
In fact, for a certain group of ath
letes, it is the very psychological
qualities that contribute to their
success that put them at risk for
many behavioral problems.
This particular group of stu
dent-athletes exhibited a certain
adaptive style that led to various
problems, including depression,
drug abuse and low self-esteem.
According to research assistant
and former Stanford football play
er Ross McQuivey, 59 percent of all
college athletes surveyed demon
strated a "repressive adaptive
style" of coping in psychological
tests, compared to only 25 percent
of a typical college student popula
tion.
In college, McQuivey said, ath
letes are trained to repress the pos
sibility of failure and concentrate
on winning. While this kind of pos
itive attitude can lead to success on
the field, he said, the athletes need
to understand that they can't carry
the same outlook into their person
al lives.

"Athletes are good at putting
[negative] things off because they
need to perform well," said Mc-
Quivey. "But it's not the same in
the real world."
Despite the troublesome find
ings of the study, Steiner and Mc-
Quivey concluded with some posi
tive remarks. Steiner encouraged
coaches, parents and educators to
develop methods to protect stu
dent-athletes at all levels from the
potential psychological harm of
competition.
Steiner said he believes that
while sports benefit the young
adult population, some caution is

necessary. "We need to look at the
ways in which sports relate to the
lives and well-being of kids."
As a former Stanford athlete,
McQuivey believes that he benefit
ed from football, which taught him
leadership, coping skills and disci
pline. "Sports overall are a good
thing, but we need to watch out
with certain personality traits,"
said McQuivey.
While Steiner admits that the
results of the study are prelimi
nary and tentative, there were
many consistent findings that will
be further analyzed in follow-up
studies.
