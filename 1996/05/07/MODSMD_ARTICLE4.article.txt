## Study finds pressure on college athletes may cause serious psychological trauma Focus on Science

A new study by a Stanford Med
ical Center researcher suggests
that for some college athletes, the
intensity of competition and the
strain of academic pressure can
lead to severe psychological stress,
including depression and even sui
cide.
The study, which was conduct
ed by Psychiatry Prof. Hans Stein
er, involved more than 1,000 high
school athletes and several hun
dred college athletes. The results
were presented last month at a
conference titled, "High School
and College Student Athletes â€”
Risks and Benefits: The Good, the
Bad and the Unexpected."
"The main message is that peo
ple assumed that doing sports has
some risk in injury but nothing
further," said Steiner. "We're
sounding a cautionary note that
it's not so simple. The ability to
focus in on things really increases
in the [college athlete] population,
but it's the very thing that puts
them at risk."
The research project included

detailed surveys of students at a
Northern California high school in
1993 and at a major university in
1995. The study showed that high
school athletes consistently out
performed their less active class
mates on a variety of psychological
and physical tests. The only excep
tion was a small group of high
school students with psychiatric
problems.
In general, team sports seem to
give an advantage to most high
school students, but this benefit
does not translate into the same
advantage in college, Steiner said.
In fact, for a certain group of ath
letes, it is the very psychological
qualities that contribute to their
success that put them at risk for
many behavioral problems.
This particular group of stu
dent-athletes exhibited a certain
adaptive style that led to various
problems, including depression,
drug abuse and low self-esteem.
According to research assistant
and former Stanford football play
er Ross McQuivey, 59 percent of all
college athletes surveyed demon
strated a "repressive adaptive
style" of coping in psychological
