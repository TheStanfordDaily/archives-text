# Advising system will get upgrade
## 'Curriculum-oriented' changes include UAC director, hotlines 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
Responding to years of student
complaints and the year-old recom
mendations of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education, a task
force assigned to look into restruc
turing Stanford's advising system
has formulated several solutions —
all designed to effect major changes
without drastic overhaul.
In particular, the University will
hire a new director of undergradu
ate advising to help guide the Un
dergraduate Advising Center in a
new, more "curriculum-oriented"
direction, said Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education Ramon
Saldivar, who chaired the Advising
Task Force.
The new administrator will
work with Hector Cuevas, who will
remain in his current position as di
rector of the advising center. "I en
vision the new director and I work
ing together to enhance advising
and delivering better support to the
students," Cuevas said.
Though controversy earlier this
year centered around the issue of
direct faculty advising, Saldivar

said the task force chose to focus on
building the strengths of the advis
ing center.
New programs at the advising

center will include
a summer hot
line for incoming
freshmen, as well
as a regular advis
ing hotline for all
students. Cuevas
said he also plans
to implement a
new e-mail hot
line, dubbed the
"froshline," for

faster answers to advising ques
tions.
The advising center will hire
more advisers to complement the
freshman advising program, and a
new advising handbook — an out
growth of Approaching Stanford —
will also be available for incoming
freshmen.
Saldivar said he plans to try a
pilot "team-advising approach" for
freshmen in some residences.
