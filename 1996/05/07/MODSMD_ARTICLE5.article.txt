# Advising system will get upgrade
## 'Curriculum-oriented' changes include UAC director, hotlines 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
Responding to years of student
complaints and the year-old recom
mendations of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education, a task
force assigned to look into restruc
turing Stanford's advising system
has formulated several solutions —
all designed to effect major changes
without drastic overhaul.
In particular, the University will
hire a new director of undergradu
ate advising to help guide the Un
dergraduate Advising Center in a
new, more "curriculum-oriented"
direction, said Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education Ramon
Saldivar, who chaired the Advising
Task Force.
The new administrator will
work with Hector Cuevas, who will
remain in his current position as di
rector of the advising center. "I en
vision the new director and I work
ing together to enhance advising
and delivering better support to the
students," Cuevas said.
Though controversy earlier this
year centered around the issue of
direct faculty advising, Saldivar

said the task force chose to focus on
building the strengths of the advis
ing center.
New programs at the advising

center will include
a summer hot
line for incoming
freshmen, as well
as a regular advis
ing hotline for all
students. Cuevas
said he also plans
to implement a
new e-mail hot
line, dubbed the
"froshline," for

faster answers to advising ques
tions.
The advising center will hire
more advisers to complement the
freshman advising program, and a
new advising handbook — an out
growth of Approaching Stanford —
will also be available for incoming
freshmen.
Saldivar said he plans to try a
pilot "team-advising approach" for
freshmen in some residences.
"We want to bring together spe
cial advisers from the | advising cen


Saldi'var
tor) staff, faculty advisers, head [ad
vising associates] and AAs to unify
the advising within the dorm,"
Saldivar said. "We want to have a fo
cused advising situation in the
dorms, the kind that we found
worked extremely well for Sopho
more College."
By playing on ideas that are al
ready working — programs like-
Sophomore College and the sopho
more seminars — there isn't a need
to build "grand new advising
schemes," Saldivar said. The advis
ing center will offer 87 sophomore
seminars and dialogues next year,
allowing more than half of the
sophomore class to participate in

the program.
Saldivar added that there is no
reason this kind of close interaction
cannot be extended to all students.
" I can imagine that within a very
short period of time we will be able
to provide enough sophomore sem
inars and dialogues, along with the
growing Sophomore College pro
gram, to cover 100 percent of the
sophomores," he said. "That is my
goal."
Undergraduate advising was a
central component of the recom
mendations proposed in the 1994
report of the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education — which
suggested increasing faculty in
volvement and emphasis on smaller
classes such as freshman seminars.
Controversy arose earlier this
year when the task force suggested
that faculty be compensated for

participating in some sort of advis
ing program. Saldivar said the task
force is still considering this idea.
While it is important to get facul
ty involved in all levels, Saldivar
said, "If the administration starts
setting up rules for faculty, it would
produce a negative response." In
stead opportunities for advising
will be enhanced, making it easier
for faculty to be advisers.
Saldivar said he plans to charge
the new director for undergraduate
advising with developing outreach
programs so "not all the advising
takes place at the center, but occurs
at the dorm, in the classrooms and
in the departments."
University President Gerhard
Casper will unveil more specific
plans for undergraduate education
at Thursday's Faculty Senate
meeting.
