# Vote's on after law students have gone
## 
### Rachel Kolman Marshak Staff writer 
A special
election for a
student body
president, vice
president and
graduate coun
cil will still

occur May 22 and 23, although
Law School students will have
completed their academic year,
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Ryan Medders said.
Most law students, however,
said they were not upset about
this possible disenfranchisement,
calling it just another example of
the already existing division be
tween the Law School and the rest
of the University.
The Law School, unlike the
rest of the University, runs on se
mesters. The last day of finals for
law students is May 21.

Having the election after the
Law School finishes violates no
constitutional provisions, Med
ders said.
"We're working on the prob
lem," Medders said. "Nothing has
been firmly decided yet, but we're
making an effort with the Law
School administration to see what
kinds of options we can exercise.
But we're still moving forward
with the same date."
Because voting is done over the
World Wide Web, law students
with Internet access will still be
able to vote, he said, but added
that some students might not
have access if they are away from
school.
Deputy Senate Chair Bill Shen
said the ASSU is also considering
mailing absentee ballots to law
students.
"I think we're looking toward

the elections commissioner to
take every possible action to make
sure the opinions of law students
are as represented as every other
student on campus," Shen said.
"The election shouldn't happen
unless efforts are made to get the
opinions of law students."
The special election was called
last week after the recent victo
ries of "Constitution '96" —•
which mandates a single presi
dent and a vice president — and
the"I Prefer to Have A Single
President" COP slate, whose
members ran on the promise that
if elected, they would resign to
make way for a single president.
In addition, because of poor
publicity prior to the general elec
tion, Medders said he decided to
hold a special election for the
graduate council, instead of using
write-in votes to decide the win
ners.
The graduate council has a
similar function to senior class
presidents. It is composed of two

representatives from each of
three districts: the Schools of En
gineering and Earth Sciences; the
Schools of Humanities and Sci
ences and Education; and the
Schools of Law, Business and
Medicine.
Law student Sarah Kline said
she did not think most law stu
dents would be too bothered by
being left out of the election.
"To be honest I probably would
not vote anyway. I did not vote in
the regular election," she said. "In
theory, law students should be
upset that [the ASSU is] doing
something which includes the
Law School after law students
leave, but in reality most law stu
dents probably would not vote
anyway."
Law student Eugene Chen
agreed, saying that many law stu
dents are ignorant of what hap
pens in the ASSU and feel sepa
rated from the University in any
case.
While the timing of the election
may not be ideal for law students,
there are few alternatives, said
graduate senator Doug Natelson.
"The election was scheduled
for when it was for several rea

sons," Natelson said. "The 'I Pre
fer to Have a Single President'
Council of Presidents slate wants
to resign as quickly as it can and
the last time there was not some
sort of ASSU executive in exis
tence over the summer, there
were numerous problems. The
ASSU is much more diffuse if
there isn't an executive around
over summer."
Natelson said he did not think
the senate would take any extra
ordinary measures to rectify the
situation.
"It's more the place of law,
business and medicine represen
tatives to bring this issue up than
mine," Natelson said. "If I got
feedback from law students
which led me to believe that they
felt they were getting shafted, I
would be more inclined to do
something.
"It's hard to work out effec
tive compromises that make
everyone happy," he added. "The
participation of the Law School
senators has been less than en
thusiastic the whole year, and it
is possible that is why they were
not specifically addressed in the
transition."
