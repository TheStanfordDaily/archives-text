# 'There are a lot of great writers out there who don't get a lot of exposure'
## Budding authors to showcase their craft 
### Angel Flores 
Because Stanford receives so
much attention for its research in
scientific fields, it can be easy to
overlook the more artistic minds
that are at work on campus.
Tonight, eight of those minds
will give a reading at the Book
store. SLx sophomores, one junior
and one senior will read their own
stories, poems and plays.
"There is a wide variety and
wealth of talent and not enough
opportunities to show it," said
Katy Gordon, administrative as
sociate of the Creative Writing
Department. Gordon is the force
behind the literary evening.
Other student readings have
taken place before, Gordon said,
but it has been two years since the
last one. Additionally, the format
for the previous readings was less
structured and more of an "open
mike"-type event.
"I'm looking forward to hear
ing other people read their work,"
said Jill Meyers, a sophomore

In order to share their creative skills with a wider audience, sophomores Seth Weisburst and Zaq
Roberts, along with six other writers, plan to read their work at the Bookstore tonight. While all the stu
dents agree they are nervous about reading their writing in front of others, they all feel it is an impor
tant experience in the creative process.
who plans to read one of her short
stories.
All of the writers expressed ex
citement at the chance to hear the
work of their fellow students. Op
portunities to listen to other stu
dents' creative writing are limited,
they said.
"There are a lot of great writers
out there who don't get a lot of ex
posure," said sophomore Dalia
Azim, who also will read a short
story.
"Unless you're in class with
these people, you're not going to
hear what they're writing," Gor
don said.
Gordon said there are not
enough opportunities for students
to share their work and feels there
are many talented writers who
should have the opportunity to
present their writing.
"Because publishing is so hard,
this is good starting-out experi

ence and a good way to get expo
sure," said sophomore Seth Weis
burst, who will read his fiction.
The writers agreed that read
ings such as these are a good way to
get spontaneous feedback from the
audience and other writers. They
also provide a way for writers to in
teract with each other.
"Writers don't have much con
tact with other writers except in
the classroom and in workshops,"
said senior Katie Peterson, who
will read her poetry. "The type of
writing done in the classroom is
different from the work done out
side, because in the classroom you
have to write for the teacher."
However, a desire to gain expe
rience, exposure and feedback are
not the only reasons that have dri
ven these students to read their
work.
Even though most of the writers
said they are anxious about sharing
their writing in front of an audi
ence, they believe it is necessary to
read their work as part of the
process of writing.
"Things like this help in getting

over the nervousness of expressing
your work to other people," Weis
burst said.
Several of the writers have ex
pressed their creativity through
other means, such as having work
published in The Mind's Eye, the
on-campus student literary maga
zine. Peterson has had a produc
tion done of her play adaptation of
Virginia Woolf's novel, "The
Waves." Park had his first play
produced by Ram's Head last win
ter.
Peterson said she thinks live
readings offer benefits that other
forums for creativity, such as
plays, cannot.
"It's different when writers can
read their own writing and can ex
plain it," Peterson said.
Already, the response to
tonight's reading has been enthu
siastic. Gordon said she is current
ly trying to plan a second reading
before the end of the year and has
had four people sign up for it.

The students will read tonight at
the Bookstore at 7p.m.
