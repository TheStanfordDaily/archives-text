Because Stanford receives so
much attention for its research in
scientific fields, it can be easy to
overlook the more artistic minds
that are at work on campus.
Tonight, eight of those minds
will give a reading at the Book
store. SLx sophomores, one junior
and one senior will read their own
stories, poems and plays.
"There is a wide variety and
wealth of talent and not enough
opportunities to show it," said
Katy Gordon, administrative as
sociate of the Creative Writing
Department. Gordon is the force
behind the literary evening.

structured and more of an "open
mike"-type event.
"I'm looking forward to hear
ing other people read their work,"

dents agree they are nervous about reading their writing in front of others, they all feel it is an impor
tant experience in the creative process.
