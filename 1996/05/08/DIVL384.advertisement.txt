Rachel Tobey
What: Doing The Leg Work.
Major: Biology ami Spanish <prospective)
After a long day with their feet up on the desk, some folks like to head home and kick
their legs up on the cof fee table. Not Rachel Tobey. In fact, her legs never seem to be at
rest. Rachel just completed the Big Sur International Marathon in April (only the second
marathon of her running career) and took just three hours and forty-four minutes to
make it from Big Sur to Carmel. In addition to running six times a week, she prepared for the
marathon by diving into her conditioning program with both feet: pool running, mountain bik
ing and weight lifting. When she's not out running around or skiing or playing tennis,
the former child gymnast tutors in Bio-systems.
Brian Auld
What: Auld For One and One For Auld.
Major: Economics and Communications (prospective)
He writes, he shoots, he scores! Freshman Brian Auld has brought more than just his
impressive All-State lacrosse skills to Stanford: the Texan also writes sports stories for The
Stanford Daily, covering the Cardinal men's tennis team. Brian is a die-hard fan of the Dallas
Cowboys, but if his heart is secretly pining for his home team, you'd never know it from the
way he's thrown himself into campus athletics. In addition to biking, swimming and playing
hoops in his spare time, Brian volunteers with T.E.A.M., playing sports with economically dis
advantaged youths in East Palo Alto. Whether you encounter him as a journalist or an
athlete, Brian is one Auld acquaintance that won't soon be forgotten.
Campi s Correspondents: Pan Kao, Junior.

Third Time's a Charm: This year's Boston Marathon
was not only the classic's centennial, it was also the largest
marathon 111 the world, with an unprecedented field 0f3H,706
runners. Uta Pippig, ranked first in the world and favored
many to win the gold medal in this summer's Olympic marathon,
made up 150 yards in the 25th mile to pass teammate Tegla
Loroupe for a 2:27:1 2 winning time. It was Uta's third
win in a row in Boston. Way to (Just) Do It, Uta!
