# Ph.D. glut?
## Doctoral students worry about lack of 'top-tier' jobs in academia 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
Due to an increasing supply of
doctoral candidates vying for a lim
ited number of positions in acade
mia, recent discussions by the Fac
ulty Senate and the University's
Planning and Policy Board reflect
doctoral students' growing concern
about employment opportunities.
The report by the board, re-

leased in January,
showed that the
number of people
in the United
States holding
doctorates has
quadrupled over
the last 30 years.
Fewer new
doctorate recipi
ents can find per
manent jobs at

"top-tier" research universities like
Stanford.
Susan Prohaska, a doctoral stu
dent in immunology who helped or
ganize a symposium on Friday on
the changing role of the biomedical
sciences, expressed fear about her
job prospects after she has received
her degree.
"There are a lot of companies
that need people who understand
the science, and there are fewer
tenure track positions at top uni
versities available," Prohaska said.
"It is easy to say that if you are
doing top science, you will get the
job," Prohaska said. "But there are
a lot of people applying, and it is
very scary to think there won't be
jobs for us."
Prohaska is part of a student
group called Biomass, a biomedical
association formed to give graduate
students a central place to voice
their concerns. "We want people in
industry and academia to give us a
better perspective about what is
available," Prohaska said.
The demographics of employ
ment for doctorate holders has not
changed significantly in the last 30
years. In 1964,58 percent of doctor
ate holders were employed in edu
cation and 26 percent in industry.
In 1991, the number in education
had only dropped to 56 percent, and
employment had risen by only four

points in industry to 30 percent.
"Data hasn't shown that there is
a surplus of people with doctoral de
grees, it just means that the jobs
people want aren't available," said
Biology Prof. Pat Jones, a member
of the board. "There is only a 1.5
percent unemployment rate for
Ph.D.s, which is very low. You talk
to students who say they can't find
jobs, but you have to remember
people's high standards."
The Planning and Policy Board
recommended that Stanford not
limit doctoral enrollment, arguing
that the surplus of qualified job can
didates is merely a perception and
not a reality. The board also sug
gested that doctorate-granting de
partments structure their pro
grams to be more versatile, allow
ing students to gain a wider variety
of academic and career skills. Last
ly, the board felt doctoral students
should have access to information
about employment statistics for
graduates and other information
on graduate study.
"We are recommending that de
partments look to see whether they
are training students too narrow
ly," Jones said. "There is a real need
expressed by students to be given
accurate information about the job
market and other careers that are
worthwhile."
Dean of Graduate Policy George
Dekker said he believes the problem
is most acute in the humanities.
"Only a relatively small fraction
of students are getting the kind of
top liberal arts college and research
university jobs that Stanford
Ph.D.s generally got 20 years ago,"
Dekker said.
The board's report showed that
the bulk of the growth in the num
ber of doctorates awarded has oc
curred in programs not considered
among the "top 20" research uni
versities.
"One problem is competition,"
said Industrial Engineering Prof.
"Jim Jucker, who chairs the depart
ment. "Many of the Ph.D.s that
were trained here and at other top
schools are now teaching at many
'second tier' Ph. D.-granting insti
tutions. Their Ph.D.s can be, and


Dekker
often are, tougher competition for
our students than we've seen in the
past."
One of the ways the School of
Medicine has tried to provide more
information to its students about
jobs is through the Academic Indus
try Scholars program, which is a di
versity training program where
students spend a quarter working
in industry jobs.
"Even though a university isn't
for job training, people need to look
ahead to the future," said Assoc.
Molecular Pharmacology Prof.
Phyllis Gardner. "Training pro
grams give broader exposure to po
tential employment."
Students often enter post-doc
toral programs after getting their
doctorates in order to gain more ex
perience. The number of post- doc
toral positions has grown by 64 per
cent nationally in the last 10 years,
the Planning and Policy Board
found.
Assoc. Director of Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center Arthur Bi
enenstock said all of his recent stu
dents have gone into post-doctoral
programs before they went for per
manent jobs. "It is the same as what
I did 30 years ago," Bienenstock
said.
While post-doctoral programs
may not be new, more students are
finding the training helpful in ob
taining permanent jobs.

Dekker said the post-doctoral
opportunities are actually causing
a "backlog" problem in employ
ment. "Individuals who have
Ph.D.s hold temporary positions
and build strong publication and
teaching records," Dekker said.
"They will generally look better to
employers than freshly minted
Ph.D.s."
Biology Prof. Bob Simoni, a
member of the board, said there is
sentiment among some faculty that
after doctoral training, the only ap
propriate career is at a top research
university.
"Many of us who train Ph.D.s
take as our mission to train the uni
versity professors who will replace
us," Simoni said. He added that this
gives the impression that "any job
other than that is a misuse of the
student's training."
Prohaska said she has felt pres
sured to find a tenure track position
at a top university. "Taking a job in
industry has been considered a step
down," Prohaska said. "But there is
good science being done in industry.
If the door is open, we should walk
through it."
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldi'var, a mem
ber of the board, said it is important
to combat this sentiment.
"Jobs are few and far between,"
Saldi'var said. "When other indus
tries have more available, students
shouldn't discount those positions
as inappropriate. We want our stu
dents to be the best qualified for
whatever job opening they are ap
plying for."
