## U.N. war trials begin in Hague 
### 
THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Pale, impassive,
wearing a baggy blue suit and flanked by U.N. guards, a
40-year-old Serb faced international justice yesterday in
the first war crimes trial to come out of the Bosnian
war.
The Texas judge presiding over the U.N. tribunal
reminded all present that Dusan Tadic was innocent
until proven guilty. Tadic's lawyer said he was a victim
of mistaken identity, swept up by authorities frantic to
find a scapegoat for the atrocities of Bosnia.
But the chief prosecutor accused the former bar
owner of offenses of "unspeakable horror," including
murdering Muslim prisoners with karate kicks, torture,
rape and forcing one prisoner to castrate another with
his teeth.
The trial, which is to include video testimony by
alleged victims too terrified of Tadic to face him in
court, opened in a building ringed by steel barriers and
flanked by tents to accommodate hundreds of reporters.
A 30-yard-wide wall of bulletproof glass separated
the judges, attorneys and defendant from the packed
spectators gallery, and scores of armed U.N. and Dutch
police patrolled inside and outside the courtroom.
The three-judge panel, wearing black and scarlet
robes, sat behind a raised wooden bench fitted with
computer screens for viewing documentary evidence,
including maps.
Tadic flipped on a computer screen placed on the
long wooden dock when he entered the courtroom, and
listened impassively to a translation of the proceedings
over a headset.
The first war crimes trial since Nuremberg "has cer
tain historic dimensions," presiding judge Gabrielle
Kirk McDonald of Houston said in her opening state
ment, referring to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals
that ended in 1956.
"Nevertheless we should all remember first and fore
most that this is a criminal trial," she said.
Tadic is charged with crimes against humanity for
taking part in more than 30 murders and torturing
Muslims in and around the Serb-run Omarska prison
camp in northwestern Bosnia in 1992. He faces a maxi
mum penalty of life in prison if convicted.
According to prosecutors, Tadic allegedly terrorized
three camps in Bosnia's northwestern Prijedor region
from May through December 1992. He also is accused of
rounding up Muslims and Croats in the area, killing or
assaulting some, and driving others into the camps.
In his opening statement yesterday, chief prosecutor
Grant Niemann of Australia described Tadic's transfor
mation from a small businessman in the northwestern
Bosnian town of Kozarac to a nationalist zealot freed by
the Serb uprising to indulge his sadistic impulses.
"Through this trial we will embark on an examina
tion of offenses of unspeakable horror," Niemann said.
