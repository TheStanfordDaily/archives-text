# Senate members clash over reform

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Elec
tion-year gridlock gripped the
Senate yesterday as the two par
ties struggled for advantage on
Majority Leader Bob Dole's call
for a rollback of the federal gaso
line tax and the Democrats'
demand to raise the minimum
wage.
"We're obviously in a situa
tion now where nothing is going
to get done," Democratic Leader
Tom Daschle said after more
than 30 minutes of sparring on
the Senate floor with Dole, the
GOP presidential nominee-to-be.
Six months before Election
Day, presidential politics hov
ered over the debate.
Dole charged President Clin
ton and the Democrats with
doing the bidding of "labor boss
es" in opposing legislation that
Republicans injected into the
debate to change certain work
place rules. "I thought certainly
he'd be flexible on something like
this. Probably is," he said in a jab
at Clinton's consistency, or lack
of it, on other issues.
The White House circulated a
three-page paper that accused

Dole of "hypocrisy" on taxes. By
his prior votes, it said, the
Kansas Republican supported
increases in the gasoline tax, as
well as hikes in the Social Securi
ty payroll tax that took place in
eight successive years.
The Senate has been at logger
heads for weeks over Democratic
demands to raise the $4.25-an
hour minimum wage by 90 cents
over two years.
Dole has gone to extraordi
nary lengths to thwart a
straightforward vote on that
issue, but he and the Republi
cans have been forced onto the
defensive at the very time he was
hoping to use the Senate as a
launching pad for his race for the
White House.
Ten days ago, Dole proposed
repealing a 4.3 cent-a-gaJlon hike
in the gasoline tax that Clinton
and the Democrats pushed
through in 1993, a politically
appealing proposal given the
sharp rise in gasoline prices in
recent months.
By early evening, private talks
to resolve the impasse were con
tinuing.
