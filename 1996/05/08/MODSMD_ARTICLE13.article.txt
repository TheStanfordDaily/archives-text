Midwest fires rage on
QUESTA, N.M. (AP) — Fire crews used hand tools and helicopters yes
terday in a fight to keep a 7,200-acre fire from advancing across steep
canyons and mountainsides into two communities in northern New Mexi
co.
Helicopters hauled huge buckets of water to drop on the flames in a steep
canyon of the Carson National Forest. Ground crews chopped and burned
fire breaks between the fire and the communities of Red River and Questa.
"We would hope that something could stop the fire where it's at, but in
all reality, it could get very close," said Jake Pierce, administrator for the
town of Red River, a mountain ski resort.
About 450 of Red River's 500 residents were evacuated. Officials allowed
them to return home later yesterday, with warnings to be prepared to leave
in a hurry. The fire was still moving toward town, but firefighters said they
could probably control it.

About 600 others had evacuated from La Lama, where a New Age spiri
tual community of about 70 families suffered heavy damage, and from La
Questa, a ranching town of about 1,700 people a few miles from Red River.
Parents on trial for son's crimes
ST. CLAIR SHORES, Mich. (AP) — A couple on trial for failing to control
their son's behavior tried to intervene and often weren't aware of his crimes,
the teen-ager testified yesterday.
"I tried to hide what I did and stuff because I knew they would be upset,"
said Alex Provenzino. The 16-year-old is serving a one-year sentence after
pleading no contest to breaking and entering and marijuana possession.
Prosecutors charged Anthony Provenzino, 48, and Susan Provenzino, 44,
under the local Parental Responsibility Act with failing to control Alex's
behavior. If convicted of the misdemeanor, the couple could be fined $75 to
$100 and be held liable for $27,000 in damage allegedly caused by their son.
