Groups that lost their fee
requests should be more
active in soliciting funds

FOR AT LEAST the last three
decades, Stanford has con
sistently moved to scale back
student services and activities,
often pushing the University's
costs back onto the student body
itself. Witness the explosion of the
special-fee system, which was used
to support just four groups in
1973. In 1996, 30 campus groups
requested funding.
Created in the early 1970s as a
way to temporarily fund a few
groups like The Daily and the
Band, the special-fee system has
mutated into a huge — often capri
cious — funding source on which
dozens of student activities and
services are dependent. That's not
what its designers intended, and it
needs to change.
Although students have borne
the burden of funding student
groups more and more, last week
the tide may have started to turn.
After being pushed around for two
decades, some students started to
push back.
Stung by a painful special-fee
loss in last month's election, the
Stanford Women's Collective
quickly organized to lobby the
University to fund parts of its bud
get — which include Women's
Herstory month — previously cov
ered by the special fee. At his "Tea
and More Cookies" meeting on
Thursday, University President
Gerhard Casper "somewhat"
promised the Women's Center,
whose supporters attended the
open forum in large numbers,
increased financial support from
the University.
The Women's Collective
deserves credit for moving to solic
it support from the University so
quickly, and President Casper
should be praised for acting to help

an organization that probably
should not have been funded by
student fees in the first place.
The events that precipitated
this situation raise an interesting
question: Would this be happening
if the Women's Center fee hadn't
failed? Probably not, but hopefully
the failure of a number of fees —
many of which supported large
groups serving both the under
graduate and graduate student
populations — will force the Uni
versity to deal with the basic ques
tion of whether these vital services
should be forced to depend on the
special-fee system for funding.
As this year's results demon
strated, it has become quite diffi
cult for a group targeting both
graduates and undergraduates to
garner enough interest to get
approval from 15 percent of vot
ers, required by the ASSU's con
stitution. For groups serving both
populations to survive, the Uni
versity may have to step in.
For this to happen, however,
students need to get their act
together — quickly. The Women's
Collective example shows how a
group can organize and effectively
advocate to the University and get
quick results. Although Casper
was careful not to make any solid
promises, it now seems likely that
the Women's Center will receive
more University funding during
the next school year.
There's no reason why other
rejected special-fee groups, such as
campus radio station KZSU, can't
try to do the same. When you get
right down to it, shouldn't a large
university like Stanford be the pri
mary supporter of a non-commer
cial radio station that serves the
entire community through news,
music and sports broadcasts? Of
course it should, but until now stu
dents have been financing KZSU to
the tune of $100,000 a year.
Last week, the Women's Collec
tive showed that it's possible to get
the University to increase its fund
ing of needed student services. It's
now up to other student groups to
follow its lead.
