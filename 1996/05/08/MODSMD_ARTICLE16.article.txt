Chicano student groups neglect Latino concerns

AT THIS TIME in history, when
Chicanos whine about anything
that does not go their way and
define it as racism, an important point
should be made about the title Chicano /
Latino. The Chicano / Latino groups do
a lot to address their Chicano issues (if
there are any), but never has there been
any activity concerning the Latin com
munity or the real issues of economic
development in Latin America. One
could argue that these events do not
happen because there are no Latin stu
dents in this Chicano / Latino communi
ty, but there are reasons for that. The
ethnocentric and very exclusive attitude
of the Chicano community prevents
anyone from other Latin countries from

feeling comfortable in this community.
Just because I do not feel oppressed by
the "whites" should not be reason
enough to exclude me; just because I do
not cheer and laugh, like some in the
Chicano community have done, when I
— instead of a white American — get a
scholarship should not make me an
alien with people of my own language.
Any one of them could say that I do
not know the community, but I came to
some of the events in my first week as a
transfer last fall. Watching Mexican
dances or talking about grapes or immi
grant oppression does not necessarily
encompass concerns of the Latin com
munity as a whole. For instance, in an
article in Monday's Daily, Lubia

Sanchez makes the point that she
"wanted to see a Chicano Studies pro
gram, the boycotting of grapes and more
representation of the Chicano commu
nity in Stanford staff." No one men
tioned anything about Latin representa
tion.
Finally, any one of them can argue
against me with numbers, but the fact
remains that everyone who is Latin is
put in their mailing list, does not neces
sarily mean that Latins are a real part
of the community or that we bother to
read this kind of mail.
In Monday's article about the hunger
strike, the writer finishes the story with
the quote of a man that participated in
the vigil: "We opened Stanford's eyes to

the world." But if Stanford's eyes are
really open, one should seriously ques
tion the Chicano cries of oppression and
exclusion when they exclude people who
speak their own language. Most impor
tantly, the Chicano community should
not put forth the word Latino as a polit
ical facade to keep a budget, on the
grounds that it encompasses the Latin
community as a whole. Let me whine at
least once (even though I won't go on
strike if otherwise): The should remove
the second word of their title if they
want to be truthful about the identity of
their community.
