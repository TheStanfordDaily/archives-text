## Hoover and holistic learning 
### 
The hoover institution
scares me. It has dark tunnels
running underneath, fossilized
ideas inside and the aura of an institu
tion burdened with the legacy of a
president who led us into the Great
Depression. However, personal dis
agreement aside, Stanford's treatment
of Hoover is unfair and, most impor
tantly, an example of what most frus
trates me about my education at Stan
ford: we are encouraged to wrap our
own little boxes around our heads and
hide from the things that might really
challenge us.
For example, unless they can get a
rare joint appointment, Hoover Fel
lows aren't allowed to teach, even if
they are qualified and willing. Revers
ing this policy and allowing Hoover
Fellows in the classroom would not
only open students' minds to intelli
gent conservative arguments, but it
would also help to open the minds of
the Hoover Fellows. We would be able
to learn about Reagan from people who
respect him more than Trotsky.
Hoover Fellows could learn from peo
ple who don't spend their lives in inac
cessible offices at the top of phallic
towers. If Tom Metzger, a Hoover Fel
low, interacted with students, he never
would have reacted to student activist
Monisha Bajaj's demands for affirma
tive action by accusing her of being
"uncivilized and unfit to be a Stanford

student" on the grounds that she has a
nose ring.
However, no matter how silly our
relationship with Hoover is, it is still
only a symptom of a strange disease
found here. Instead of being encour
aged to broaden our minds and per
spectives, at Stanford we seem to learn
self-absorption. We are encouraged by
the system of education we exist with
in not to debate each other, not to let
critical thought off-campus and not to
look at education as a holistic process.
Instead, we stay in our little boxes and
only leave to get drunk, work out or
tell our comrades how little we sleep.
So, now, instead of continuing to go
off on what's wrong, I am going to put
forth a few proposals on how we could
make things better and make our edu
cational experience more holistic.
1) Offer financial incentives not to
take classes. Students let their minds
dissolve in giant course loads because
it is ingrained in us that insane units
and baggy eyelids make us cool and
seduce grad schools. We'd be much bet
ter off if each of us took fewer classes
and spent some spare time reading and
debating instead of sucking caffeine in
our little solipsistic worlds. As Mark
Twain said, "never let your schooling
get in the way of your education." Plus,
classes would be smaller.
2) Offer easily accessible academic
credit for community service or for

extracurricular work — like writing
papers for student publications or jour
nals. If athletes get credit, activists,
authors and teachers should, too. Like
wise, liberalize the DR system so that
independent projects, A.P. classes or
directed reading can fulfill your
requirements.
3) Show that Stanford can't pretend
to be a box confined within Campus
Drive and develop alternate invest
ment options to support the local com
munity. Stanford should develop a sec
ond, responsible investment fund that,
instead of supporting Texaco and Pep
siCo, supports economically targeted
and responsible investments. When
alumni give money to the school they
could then have the option of giving to
either the pillage fund or the responsi
ble fund — both of which would sup
port Stanford. Hell, this might even
make alumni contributions go up.
4) Free the Hoover Institution.
At times I feel like our lives at Stan
ford are just more steps along an assem
bly line that started when they started
handing out grades and that will only
end when we are bland careerists. I
don't know whose fault this is, but I
sure hope to find a way out.

This may be the end of the road. Sigh
