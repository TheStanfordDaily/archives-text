# Sisters 'n' brothers: Real World rushes
## the 						REAL WORLD, STANFORD 
### Jenn Huie Contributing writer 
Editor's note: This is the sixth installment in an oc
casional series. It is the true story of seven freshmen
picked to live in an all-frosh dorm, Junipero, and
have their lives challenged. Find out what happens
when the small talk ends and people start getting
real. The Real World, Stanford.
Though less than 20 percent of the student body
is involved in Stanford's Greek system, both
Rushees and non-Rushees seem to be affected by the

hubbub of the Rush process when it comes around
each spring.
The fact that four of the five Junipero staff mem
bers are involved in the Greek system was an influ
encing factor for many Junipero Rushees, Jean De
La Torre said. Twenty women paid the $21 registra
tion fee to participate in Rush this spring; Jean is one
of six who ended up pledging a sorority.
"When I first came to Stanford, I had a negative
view of the Greek system," Jean said. "But seeing
how awesome our Greek dorm members were gave

me abetter view."
Though Jean is happy to have
followed through with Rush, she
admitted that she did not have a
positive experience going through
the process.
"The conversations on the first
day were really shallow and point
less; I don't know how many times I
told someone my name, where I
lived and what my prospective ma
jors are," she said. "I didn't like
being passed around from person to
person."
Rush often becomes a touchy
subject when it comes down to
choosing or being chosen by a par
ticular sorority or fraternity, said
Jean. For Sorority Rush, the worst
moment occurred when the first
"cut" list was distributed by each
sorority, Jean explained.
"An uncomfortable situation
came up when my roommate wasn't
invited back to a particular sorority
that she was interested in, and I
was," she said. "Girls who were cut
were thinking things like, 'Oh my

God, what's wrong with me?' "
After completing Rush, Jean said
she still feels as though she does not
have a clear perception of the Greek
system, as Rush is not representa
tive of sorority life.
"The Greek system is what you
make out of it," Jean said. "[At first]
there was a lot of energy in my fresh
man dorm. As the year progressed,
people split off and were not as
much of a unit any more. I know I
won't have that going into my
sophomore year, so that's one thing
I'm looking for in a sorority."
The Fraternity Rush process is a
different story.
"The guys have it a lot easier
than the girls," said Joe Freund, the
only Real World member who will
be living in a fraternity house next
year. "We get to do stuff like eat
sushi, and girls have to go through
assembly lines and pretend they
care about meeting thousands of
people."
Joe described Rush as an individ
ual process. He explained that stu
dents had a chance to learn about
themselves while figuring out what
type of personalities they click with.
Fraternities "give guys a chance
to live with a close group of friends

for more than a year," Joe said. "It
also gives you the chance to escape
four years of Res Ed."
Kevin Chen, who participated in
Rush but did not pledge a fraternity,
views the Greek system at Stanford
in a positive light.
"The fraternities provide a good
social outlet," he said. "At other
schools, you're a dork or have no so
cial life if you don't pledge. But I the
Greek system] is so low-key here
that it's not like that."
Though Kevin enjoyed meeting
people through Rush, he pointed
out a few faults in the process.
Rush "is too short; you can't re
ally get to know anyone in two
weeks," he said. "But I can't really
say anything about the process be
cause I'm looking at it from the out
side."
There are several reasons why
freshmen decide whether to rush
and / or pledge. Grant Brown was
torn about the decision. Because he
has a cousin and several soccer
teammates in the Greek communi
ty, he was tempted to join a frater
nity. However, he and his draw
mates chose not to live in a frat
house.
"The people I know in fraterni

ties are great guys," he said. "But a
couple of my friends from high
school and I decided to try and live
together in Suites next year."
George Holbert felt as though he
did not have time in his hectic sched
ule to attend Rush events. He also
decided that fraternities were not
his style.
George commented, "I associate
fraternities with parties and drink
ing," two things with which he has
no affiliation. "I always thought
that fraternities were lame before
coming to college."
Chandra Christenson said she
associates sororities with "cliques"
and "being fake." Her decision not
to rush was based on information
relayed to her by friends.
"Talking to people you don't
know for several hours just didn't
sound fun to me," she said.
Tasha Dwamena said she does
not know enough about the Greek
system to have an opinion about it.
"You don't really have the
chance to learn about the Greek sys
tem until Rush comes around,"
Tasha said. "Rush is like putting
time and commitment into some
thing you know nothing about. It all
depends on who you know."
