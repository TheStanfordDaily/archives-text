# Romesh Ratnesar: Bread and circus
## Conservative fire from a liberal point of view 
### 
IF YOU'RE LIKE ME — disillusioned,
diffident, and despite years of desper
ately cultivating a taste for indepen
dent-label music, 1970s chic and the X-
Files, still a little bit dorky — then you
waste inordinate amounts of time on work
ing nights musing about life's unexplained
mysteries. And since it's an election year
you've been given on more than a few occa
sions to wonder about these kooky conser
vatives. Do they really want to build
orphanages, hassle legal immigrants and
bajikrupt public schools? Do they honestly
think this country needs less health care
and more semi-automatic handguns? Are
they dumb enough to nominate Bob Dole?
How did their parents let them get that
way? And is there a cure?
Prodded by these imponderables, I ven
tured beyond the demilitarized zone that
shields Stanford from unruly Palo Alto
youths on skateboards last weekend to see
the new movie "The Last Supper." The pic
ture is a wickedly dark political comedy, the
feel-ideologically troubled flick of the
spring. A smart-ass and somewhat biracial
group of liberal graduate students share a
bucolic cottage near an lowa college. They
habitually invite guests to share urbane
Sunday dinners with them, until one
evening when the preppiest of the bunch

inadvertently brings a Gulf War veteran
with close-cropped hair who says things
like "Hitler had the right idea." Things get
ugly, one pejorative leads to another, and
soon he's got a knife in his back and blood
is all over the ridiccio.
The group is horrified for about half an
hour, but they quickly convince themselves
that the world is better off without such
smarm and decide, hey, let's do it again! A
parade of Bible-beating, gay-bashing, Holo
caust-denying conservative caricatures
take their place as honored guests at this A 1
Gore-quin Round Table, and most are poi
soned, cold and buried before dessert.
Eventually everyone in the group starts to
get a little queasy about the whole thing,
just when they stumble upon the prospect
of hooking their biggest fish — a boorish
TV talk-show host who at the film's climax
figures out what these pleasant students
are up to. Newspaper writers are perma
nently barred from giving away movie end
ings.
As I walked out of the film with my lib
eral friend, both of us had processed the
movie's not terribly subtle message: conser
vative intolerance is odious, but so is wan
ton suppression — murderous or otherwise
— disguised as virtuous liberal activism.
We are supposed to feel equally repulsed by

these self-indulgent, sanctimonious intel
lectuals as by their ignorant guests.
Kind of. "Maybe they weren't wrong
after all," my friend piped up after some
reflection. I began to wonder the same
thing. I have little doubt that the world
would be a better place if loudmouths like
Rush Limbaugh, G. Gordon Liddy, Don
Imus and hell, I'll say it — Bruce Gibney
did not exist, or at least were confined to
shouting matches in slow trains or on pay
per-view. If Limbaugh can mockingly pro
pose that we devise mousetraps for the
homeless, and New York City blowhard
Bob Grant can tell radio listeners that it
would be "nice" if police officers sprayed
gay-pride marchers with machine-gun fire,
then I see little reason not to mockingly
wish that they catch a few stray bullets too.
For whatever reason, liberals have
resisted countering conservative bullying
with fire-throwing of their own. As the stu
dents in"The Last Supper" bemoaned, lib
erals are easily cowed, lulled into defensive
inaction and torpor by the threat of fresh
faced conservative alumni or abortion-doc
tor bounty hunters. But the point "The
Last Supper" truly missed is that liberals
need not resort to vigilante justice. Conser
vatives are adept enough at screwing
themselves.

It wasn't so long ago, after all, that Newt
Gingrich was swallowing airtime on the
evening news with his pseudo-futuristic pif
fle about the historic triumph of the Repub
lican agenda. The Gingrich gang did amass
extraordinary power, if not support, as
1995 began, and they tried to use it to allow
their corporate backers to pollute waters,
foul air, sack workers and get a tax break
for buying a new Lexus. It didn't wash, and
lately Newt has been seen recoiling from
squealing swine on The Tonight Show and
complaining about a mean article in a liber
al magazine published two years ago which
suggested "we beat the noxious Little but
terball to a pulp." The right wing of the
GOP seems willing to sacrifice any shadow
of hope for victory in this election to ensure
that even women victimized by rape and
incest cannot exercise their constitutional
right to have an abortion.
You might make a compelling case for
the movie characters' behavior if conserva
tives were worth being afraid of. They
aren't. I think of conservatives — who even
today are mostly male and white — as the
kinds of people who either spent adoles
cence polishing loafers and their 9-iron
approach shots (Dan Quayle) or were the
awkward fat kids who ate lunch alone and
were picked last in pick-up football games

in junior high, who had trouble talking to
girls and now want to exact their long
awaited revenge (Newt). They rage and
mutter about arcane and ephemeral con
spiracies to wreck the party, hatched by the
liberal news media, Hollywood filmmakers
and faculties of Feminist Studies depart
ments. Subsequently they try to affirm
their threatened manhood by terrorizing
the defenseless: immigrants, the elderly,
single mothers, artists. And they pursue
their myopic aims through cowardly, extra
democratic subterfuge, by skirting cam
paign finance laws or slapping underhand
ed riders which flaunt years of environ
mental regulation onto a bill providing
relief to Oklahoma City bombing victims.
So why bother risking eternal damna
tion or even an extra breath on folks whose
notion of a farsighted cause is bringing back
a ridiculous ethnic mascot for the sole, juve
nile purpose of pissing people ofi? There
are, in the end, much more important and
constructive matters to which liberals can
attend. Reorienting the misguided is a task
better left for infomercial faith healers and
televangelists. From the rest of us, conser
vatives deserve our pity, not our poison.
