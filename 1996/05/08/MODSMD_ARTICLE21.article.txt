## Bernstein makes it official: he'll forego senior year to go pro 
### 
It happened again today. Yet
another underdeveloped,
young, inexperienced under
classmen has made himself avail
able for the NBA draft in June. I
am talking, of course, about Cal's
Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who for
no logical reason other than to
get away from Todd Bozeman,
chose to give up his remaining
college years to try to hack it out
in the pros.
This is not a new story, Abdur-
Rahim is the 16th addition to a
long list of underclassmen — in
cluding Kentucky's Antoine
Walker, Georgetown's Allen
Iverson, Connecticut's Ray Allen
and UMass's Marcus Camby —
who have decided to go pro this
year. I have watched and learned
from these wonderful role models
over the past year or so, and now
feel it is a must to follow in the in
sightful examples they have set.

Therefore, I am putting an
end to all the rumors, and thus,
making it official — I will forego
my senior year and declare my
self eligible for the pro journalism
circuit.
I know what you're thinking
— "Why Todd? Say it ain't so.
Why would you leave all the fame
The Daily has brought you, just
for a little extra dough? Are you
really willing to leave your
friends behind? And what about
us, your faithful fans, what will
we do?"
Believe me, I understand, just
as all of the pre-pubescent bas
ketball players out there do, how
hard it is to make it in the pros
and the sacrifices it takes to get
there. I'm sure Kobe Bryant real
izes the hardships he is going to
have to face — missing out on a
college education entirely, saying
good-bye to all of his high school
buddies and having to ask team
mates for a fake ID so that he can
enjoy himself on road trips.
Anyway, I digress. I have
thought about my future a great
deal in the last few weeks and I
have listened to all the reasons
that these youngsters are citing
for turning pro so early. I know it
might be hard for the laity to un
derstand, but I feel it is my job to
enumerate the reasons I shall
leave the Farm next year to tack
le my dream of becoming a pro

fessional sports journalist.
First of all, I considered the
risk factor involved in staying at
Stanford one more year and de
cided that the risk is too great for
me to stay. What if I broke my
hand in an I.M. basketball game?
What if I developed carpel-tunnel
syndrome from typing too many
essays? Any such injury would re
tard my typing skills enough that
no pro club would want to take a
risk on me. After all, what paper
would want its headlines to read:
"Mikale Jaorddan dscorres 36t ni
Üblls iwn."
Another consideration is the
money. I know that I am going to
be worth millions if I come out
now, but what if I screw up next
year? What if my stock goes down
due to bad football articles or
botched swimming stories? This
year I had the privilege of cover
ing the NCAA Women's Swim
ming Championships, writing a
weekly column and documenting
the Eric Abrams case. I am sim
ply riding out my wave of mo
mentum, just as Iverson is riding
his wave from the NCAA tourna
ment.
I also find myself at a cross
roads of college sports journal
ism. I constantly ask myself, "Do
I have anything left to prove?"
Returning my senior year would
afTord me the opportunities of
covering some major Stanford
sports. However, the allure of
covering a Major league Baseball
team or an NFL squad is almost
too much for me to handle.
Sports critics always wonder
what is going to happen when a
kid opts for the NBA draft before
he is ready. They said Kevin Gar
nett wasn't mature physically or
emotionally to play in the NBA
(he managed to silence his crit
ics). Volumes of sports columns
have said that Abdur-Rahim is
not ready physically or that Iver
son won't be able to handle the
pressure of the NBA season.
Yet no one has criticized a
sports journalist for leaving col
lege early. I realize this is largely
due to the fact that no journalist
has ever publicly announced that
he is going to forego his senior
year to enter the journalism
draft. Thus, I feel I am entering
uncharted waters. I am to jour
nalism what Moses Malone was
for basketball.
Please do not hate me for my
decision, or think that I am mak
ing a mistake. I feel I have given a
lot to this university and it is time
for me to move on and do things
for myself. I don't look at this as
being selfish, but simply a wise,
necessary career move. I realize I
am not being the best role model.
