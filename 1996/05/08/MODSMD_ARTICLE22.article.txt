The No. 9 Stanford baseball
team (36-17) kept rolling along
last night, defeating Bay Area
rival Santa Clara 5-2 at Sunken
Diamond, despite being outhit
11-7. The victory extended the
Cardinal's winning streak to 13
games, tying a 1977 mark for the
third-longest tear in school his
tory. In 1978, Stanford won 14
in a row, and in 1990, the team
set the school record of 15 wins
without a loss.
This team will have a chance
to tie the 1978 edition of 14
games when it faces Saint
Mary's tonight at Sunken Dia
mond.
Last night, the Broncos (36-
19) arrived at Stanford with a re
spectable six-game winning
streak of its own. Santa Clara
wasted no time getting onto the
scoreboard, taking advantage of
a Cardinal error to score an un
earned run for a 1-0 lead.
Stanford starter Mario Igle
sias (9-1) buckled down, howev
er, and cruised through 7 1/3 in
nings to earn his team-leading
ninth victory.
"I was really anxious before
the game because we have a good
rivalry with Santa Clara and be
cause they have had so much
success lately just like we have,"
Iglesias said. "I was ready for the

game but my body didn't really
reinforce that enthusiasm early
on. I was definitely prepared but
my body just wasn't kicking in. I
was really fighting and around
the third [inningl I started feel
ing good. I got stronger as I went
along which is a good indication
for me. I'm glad I went into the
eighth — if I am needed as a
starter in the regional, that's
what we'll need."
Stanford skipper Mark Mar
quess said Iglesias' success as
both a starter and reliever has
been a plus for the pitching staff
all season long.
"Tonight, we gave them a
baserunner with the two-out
error, then he pitched fantastic,"
Marquess said. "Mario has done
that all year. I've asked him to
start, go middle relief and I've
asked him to go short and what
ever I've asked him to do, he's
done it. That gives me a lot more
flexibility, especially if we get
into a regional with six teams
and you ask guys to do different
things. Not everybody can do
that — he's been able to do it and
be very successful. He's been
very versatile and that gives me
a lot of options."
Last night's outing was the
longest for Iglesias since the
right-hander went the distance
to pick up a 3-2 win over Texas
Tech in the Midwest I Regional
last year to keep Stanford's sea
son alive. In that contest, Igle
sias struck out five and walked
three to put the Cardinal in the
position to reach the College
World Series in Omaha, Neb.

Junior Luke Quaccia unleashes a mighty swing against Cal last week
end. Quaccia and his teammates beat Santa Clara las 5-2 last night.
If Stanford is to make a re
turn trip to Omaha, consistency
from the pitching staff will be
crucial. In the past three weeks,
the hurlers have been just that,
posting a team ERA of under
3.00 during the winning streak.
"When we gather as a staff,
consistency is one of the things
we always talk about, one of the
things we say when we put our
hands together when we break,"
Iglesias said. "We're really look
ing for that and we've done it
since the USC weekend."
Starters Kyle Peterson, Chad
Hutchinson and Jeff Austin

have kept Stanford in every
game and have been turning the
ball over to the bullpen, which
has enjoyed plenty of success
lately.
Last night, junior right-han
der Tom Reimers snuffed a po
tential Santa Clara rally in the
eighth, inducing a grounder to
second off the bat of pinch hitter
Brent Bianchina, the potential
tying-run. Reimers, who started
three games earlier in the year,
earned his fourth save of the sea
son.
"We made it more difficult for
him than we probably should
have because we started him a
couple of times when we were
struggling a little bit early,"
Marquess said. "We've got him
in a position now, where we've

got our starters pretty much set
with Kyle, Chad and Austin and
now we've got Mario as the
fourth starter we needed and
Reimers as the closer. Every
body's getting their roles which
is nice and which you hope to
have happen at this time of year,
especially on your pitching
staff."
The Cardinal will look to con
tinue its winning ways as it
makes a bid to host an NCAA Re
gional tournament and gain a fa
vorable seed in the post-season.
"For the fielding, the hitters
and the pitchers, the success is
contagious," Iglesias said.
"Lately we've been playing with
a lot of confidence and that's
how we need to play to keep on
rolling."
