# Goalkeeper Crary leads the way for water polo

When it was time to interview
Heather Crary I must admit I felt a
little nervous. I knew very little
about her but what I did know was
enough to make any rookie reporter
a little wary. As I walked about Stem
Late Night I looked for her — about
5-10, blondish brown hair, nick
named The Cage, and probably the
best freshman water polo goalkeep
er in the country.
"She is a complete team player,
unselfish and tough," said head
coach Ben Quittner of his star goalie.
I was looking for a person who
looks so calm in goal that if she
wasn't getting her hands on every
thing that came across the goal you
might think she was on the water
aerobics team and not the water polo
team. The Cage — OK, I was a lot
nervous.
Heather Crary is a woman of
firsts. She is a member of the inau
gural varsity women's water polo
team. She was the first person ever
to sign a letter of intent to play for
Stanford's women's water polo as a
varsity athlete last November. She

was picked up for the Junior Nation
al Team on her first attempt last
February in Colorado Springs. How
ever, at the same time Crary will tell
you that she started playing water
polo and still plays because it is fun.
The Cage — fun?
As much as she chose Stanford,
the Cardinal chose her. Craiy was
born just a short drive away in San
Francisco and her family now lives
in Redwood City. She attended the
nearby Menlo School where she was
a member of the basketball, volley
ball and swimming teams, and most
importantly, where she began play
ing water polo as a freshman. It is
here that she gained one of her
biggest mentors in her basketball
coach.
"He was the greatest coach I ever
had," Crary said. "He helped with
the mental side. He gives me help
with water polo even though he
doesn't know what is going on."
Even before she came to Stanford
she had played with some of her cur
rent teammates. Her club team,
Sapo, practiced in DeCuerre pool
and boasted other Cardinal players


Red Byer — Daily file
Freshman Heather Crary was a rock in goal all year, leading the
women's water polo team through its first varsity season.
— Lindsay Welsh, Danielle Kees and
Maureen Eger. During the summer
she also played with Nicole Glazer
and Rachel Best. Cory Olcott, who
coached Sapo, became an assistant
coach to the Stanford team late last
year. And most importantly, her
best friend Susan Gardner will join
the water polo team next year as a
member of the Stanford class of
2000.
"Susan Is my best friend," Crary
said. "She is really supportive."
The Cage — fun?
From the minute Crary took to
the pool at Stanford she has made
herself right at home and has done

what she does best even better. She
has been virtually impenetrable in
goal all season and is a big reason the
Cardinal, ranked No. 5 in the na
tion, is on its way to Nationals this
weekend. She has been named
Northern Section Goalkeeper of the
Year, Mountain-Pacific Athlete of
the Year and was selected to the
Mountain-Pacific All Tournament
Team.
"In my opinion she is the No. 1
women's water polo goalie in the
country," Quittner said.
With only one year under her belt
and so much already accomplished,
one might think that it would be
hard for Crary to set goals, but she
has little trouble doing that.
"I just want to work up to my po
tential and to have fun."
The Cage — fun.
