# Softball ends '96 campaign with tough California squad
## Cardinal squad looks to snap season-long, nine-game losing streak with a victory 
### Robin Davidson Staff writer 
The Stanford softball team makes its final
home stand of the season today with a dou
bleheader against PacificlO Conference rival
California. The Cardinal (23-26 overall, 6-16
in the Pac-10) will take on the Bears at Twin
Creeks in Sunnyvale today at 1:00 p.m. in the
final games of the season.
These two teams met earlier in February
at Cal, with Stanford droppingboth games by
scores of 6-4 and 4-0. The Cardinal will need
to make an about-face in order to come away
with a victory. The Stanford sluggers have
slid to a losing record with nine straight loss
es (the Cardinal's longest losing streak of the
season) and forfeited any chances of postsea
son play.
"Most of us have dealt with the disap
pointment [of not making the postseason],"
junior Amanda Renteria said. "Now with this
last game everybody's looking to earn a little
respect."
Up-and-down seasons characterize both
teams in this Bay Area matchup. Cal, which
is fourth in the Pac-10, has been inconsistent
for the most part of the season. r l\vo week
ends ago, the Bears swept No. 2 Arizona, but
lost to an unimpressive Arizona State team.
"I think we have a really good chance of
beating them," Renteria said. "They've had a
pretty inconsistent season so that gives us a
good chance to get on top of them. If we play
our game, there's no reason why we can't
win."
The Cardinal's slide has been plagued

with poor hitting and even worse defense, but
the players seem positive and ready to play.
"I have a really good feeling about the
game," Renteria said. "With it being our last
game, everybody's going to be into it."
If the Cardinal is ready to play, then they
stand a good chance of earning a win against
the favored Bears. Stanford's performance
all season long has been erratic, but com
pared to previous years it has definitely been
a success.
The Stanford Softball program is in its
fourth year as a varsity sport and its third
year of Pac-10 competition. Entering the
1996 season the Cardinal had just one con
ference win to its credit, but the squad quick
ly improved on its record bv posting six Pac
-10 victories against Oregon, Oregon State
and Arizona State.
"We're more competitive this year,"
sophomore Jessica Schulman said. "We defi
nitely had the talent to compete against top
teams this year, but we didn't always reach
our potential."
That potential may be reached soon. Stan
ford only graduates one player this season
and will come back next year with the essen
tial components for a winning combination.
"We'll have more experience," Schulman
said. "We have some new players coming in
as well who will be able to contribute. As long
as we keep working hard and striving to im
prove, we'll be all right."
For now, the task at hand is putting an
end to their biggest drought of the season and
earning some much-deserved respect with a
victory over Cal.
