# Visiting mentor promotes public service
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
According to Suzan Shown Haijo, college
should be more than just a busy schedule and
the accumulation of information — it should
be a life-giving process.
"The amassing of knowledge is just an
empty exercise unless it leads to some action,"
said Haijo, who is at Stanford this week as the
Haas Center for Public Service's visiting men
tor. "Knowledge and information carry with
them responsibility. . . . There are people who
go out and clip flowers from living bushes and
trees and never once think about planting a
seed that will give more flowers."
Before her Sunday departure, Harjo will
meet with staff and students to discuss topics
ranging from Native-American issues to pro
moting social change through art.
Harjo, a poet and writer from Washington,
D.C., is active in a variety of policy-making,
public service and social change programs. She
is also a founding member of several Native
American and cultural organizations and is
president and executive director of The Morn
ing Star Institute, a national non-profit orga
nization for native peoples' traditional and cul
tural rights and arts promotion.
Harjo said her messages are very simple — to
tiy different things, to measure success in small

and large ways, to do what makes you happy and
finally, to accept failures and learn from them.
"The one thing I'm here to do is promote
public service — giving back to your communi
ty, going into territory where you've never
been . .. and doing something for the good.
"We've all had this white opaque veil of ig
norance dropped in front of us, and that's kept
us from knowing a lot about each other and
'the other,' " Harjo said. "It's kept us ignorant
about ourselves, our own communities, our
own people."
Harjo, who has developed key federal Na
tive-American policy in Washington for 20
years, said the emotional push for her work
came from the rampant racism she had experi
enced in her youth.
"I had grown up with the 'No Indians, no dogs
allowed' signs in Oklahoma," Harjo said, adding
that she also experienced physical and emotion
al violence at the hands of white children. "We
were always written about wrongly. . . in
schools, in textbooks, in popular culture."
Harjo, whose great-great grandfather was a
chief of the Cheyenne tribe, said her family's
tradition of active resistance and leadership
was the driving force to her vision.
"It's one thing to understand that there's a
fire burning and to stand there and say, 'Fire!
fire!' and it's another thing to understand ei
ther how to put out the fire or channel it in

some useful direction ... and it's yet another
thing to go from understanding how to do that,
to actually doing it," Haijo said.
This is what Haijo said she wants to en
courage others to do.
"Knowledge is something that doesn't be
long to you," Harjo said. "Unless you do some
thing with it, it's like a clipped flower — it's
just a dead thing."
Harjo said it is important to distinguish of
the truly important matters in life from the
unimportant ones. Especially at an institution
like Stanford, Haijo said, it is easy to be con
sumed by expectations, busy schedules and the
drive to succeed. But Harjo said the key is to ac
cept change and strive for "personal best."
Harjo said she is confident in members of
this generation because they are "confronting
the biggest problem that exists in America
today, which is the racial and cultural barrier."
"Some people like to write about history and
understand the past," Harjo said. "That's
valuable and useful, and I do that as well, but
there's nothing like shaping your time, your
era, and I can't imagine a more mighty task
than causing social change for the good."

Harjo will discuss Native-American legisla
tive issues tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in Castaho
lounge. The program is sponsored by Castaho
and Stanford-in-Government.
