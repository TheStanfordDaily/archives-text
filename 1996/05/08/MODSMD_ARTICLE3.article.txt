# Poll finds support of ethnic centers
## 67 percent endorse affirmative action admissions policies

Stanford students support both the funding of
ethnic centers and affirmative action in admis
sions policies but are divided as to whether the
University has done enough for its minority stu
dents, according to a recent telephone poll con
ducted by The Daily.
Despite the UC Regents' decision to drop affir
mative action admissions policies and continued
debate in both the media and politics over prefer
ential treatment for minorities, 67 percent of stu
dents polled supported affirmative action. This
result is similar to the results of polls conducted
by The Daily and the ASSU in November, which
showed that students overwhelmingly supported
affirmative action.

34 percent of students
believed that Stanford
has not helped out
minority students

Students also strongly supported University
funding of ethnic centers with 84 percent finding
them to be a good idea. Stanford currently has
four ethnic centers — the Asian American Activ
ities Center, the Black Community Services Cen
ter, El Centro Chicano and the American Indian
Program Office — which provide cultural pro
gramming and resources for their respective
communities.
A total of 295 randomly selected undergradu
ate and graduate students participated in the
telephone poll.
Students were divided when asked if they felt
Stanford has provided enough assistance for its
minority population. Thirty-six percent of those
polled classified themselves as having a neutral
response. Seven percent said they did not know
whether the University was doing enough for its
minority students.
However, 34 percent of students believed that
Stanford has not helped out minority students
enough, as opposed to 23 percent who felt either
that the University has partially or completely
fulfilled its goal of assisting targeted minorities.

distribution requirements. While
53 percent chose 4 or 5 — expressing
fair to strong agreement — only 22
percent thought that taking classes
about different cultures should not
be required for graduation. A fur
ther 25 percent either gave a neutral
3 or said they did not know enough
to properly answer.
A number of students felt there
was too much discussion of ethnic
ity, with 42 percent agreeing that it
was too prevalent on campus. Only
25 percent felt that more discus
sion was needed, but 33 percent of
those polled were either neutral or
did not know, making the results
inconclusive.
