# Students consider multiculturalism's meaning
## 
### Dana Hangai Contributing writer 
A term rarely used before the 1980s, "mul
ticulturalism" has become increasingly
prevalent in discussions of American society
and politics.
But few agree on exactly what the term
means.
In a recent telephone poll conducted by
The Daily, 64 percent of students said they
had a favorable or strongly favorable view of
multiculturalism.
Although the survey showed overall sup
port of multiculturalism, many of those
polled said the results should not be consid
ered conclusive because of the vague and var
ied meanings of multiculturalism.
In later interviews, Stanford students, fac
ulty and administrators also expressed a
broad range of views on the subject, revealing
a sharp disparity among definitions of the
word on campus.
Search for a definition
For Multicultural Educator Tommy
Woon, multiculturalism is "a term that re
quires definition every time you use it so you
could understand what you 're trying to say."
"In my interpretation, I have a movement

to promote interactive pluralism," Woori
said. "Pluralism is the acknowledgment of
differences without implying superiority of
any person, culture or background."
For others, multiculturalism takes on a
political meaning beyond its positive defini
tion.
"Multiculturalism is rather a benign
term," said junior Jeff Giesea, an editor at
The Stanford Review, "but I think it has come
to represent a certain political agenda, one
that embraces group-based policies such as
affirmative action that will eventually lead to
the disuniting of America."
Sophomore Julie Johnson, president of
the Stanford College Republicans, agreed
that the term has a negative connotation for
her. She added, however, that her views don't
necessarily reflect those held by others in the
group.
"For me, multiculturalism brings up im
ages of a divided society," Johnson Baid. "I
would prgfer to think of American society aa
an American society which people contribute
to with different cultural backgrounds, but
not one of lots of distinct subcultures that
exist on their own. I would prefer to think
that the diversity among American people
unites us into one culture that's
unique for all of its different experi
ences "
Some agree that multicultural
ism has taken on a negative conno
tation, but argue that it is unfair to
equate the term with curriculum
and policies that try to expand the
scope of traditional academia.
Some policies may have been un
successful, said senior Mike Choo, a
Council of Presidents member. But,
he added, "Just because some of the
means to implement multicultural
ism haven't brought the best re
sults, we shouldn't throw out the
concepts."
"I can understand the warnings
that critics of multiculturalism
issue," Woon said, "but the warn
ings should proceed in two direc
tions. The warnings should be
about balkanization and fragmen
tation as well as about the erasure
of any group's identity. If we insist
that everyone be one and the same,
we would want gays to be hetero
sexuals, women to be men, people of
color to be white people."
A primary concern for many is
whether or not the phrase is viable
and relevant in today's educational
and political discussions.
"I think at Stanford it's been
used in so many different ways, it
has lost all meaning," said Derek
Miyahara, resident fellow in Okada,
the Asian-American theme house.
Another complication is that the
University does not have an official
definition of multiculturalism.
Having a definition, Woon said, will
clarify his department's policies
and give a stronger foundation for
an often confusing word.

Miyahara disagreed, arguing
that "it's limiting to say, 'This is it.'
It limits people's sense of creativity.
I think it's a little presumptuous to
say here is this conception and here
is what you should think about
this."
Implementation
While defining multiculturalism
is a difficult task, implementing
programs which encourage diversi
ty and inform students about other
cultures is an often controversial
and complex process. According to
Sally Dickson, director of the Office

such as world cultures and Ameri
can cultures to require students to
learn about different backgrounds,
instead of allowing it to be a volun
tary activity.
"I think that there is value is
studying cultures that are different
from ours," Johnson said. "Howev
er, I think a lot of it is the Universi
ty's presumption that if someone
isn't taught in an academic environ
ment, they're just going to be racist.
I'm sure that's not even the con
scious decision behind that, but
that's the patronising feel you get
as a student."

Poll methodology

The Stanford Daily poll is based on
telephone interviews with 295 Stan
ford students selected randomly from
the Stanford Directory.
The poll was conducted by paid in
terviewers between 6 p.m. and 10
p.m. on April 22 through April 25,
April 29 and April 30.
The responding poll was com
posed of 127 undergraduate and 168
graduate students.
The questions have a margin of
error of approximately 5.8 percent at
a 95 percent confidence level.

for Multicultural Development, the
University tries to build a multicul
tural community on a number of
levels, through residences, class
rooms, the inclusion of people from
all racial and socioeconomic back
grounds and the interaction of stu
dents.
Currently, Stanford has nine un
dergraduate distribution require
ments, some which try to expose
students to different cultures. Stan
ford also has an affirmative action
policy in both admissions and hiring
and funds four ethnic theme houses
and four ethnic centers.
Some critics of multiculturalism
argue that it discriminates on the
basis of race and favors certain
groups at the expense of others,
such as in affirmative action admis
sions policies and the treatment of
ethnic centers.
Multiculturalism seems to be an
"aegis under which the University
can practice whatever discriminato
ry practices it feels like," said sopho
more Bruce Gibney, a columnist for
The Review and ASSU senator
elect. "The University forces other
non-targeted minority students to
pay substantially more than target
ed students simply on the basis of
the color of their skin."
Giesea and Johnson both ques
tioned the practice of using DRs

Carl McCants, resident fellow in
the African-American theme house
Ujamaa, asked why learning about
different people should cause such a
backlash.
"Is it that learning ahout anoth
er culture is irrelevant?" McCants
said. "They don't recognize the
other side of history they didn't nec
essarily get when they were in high
school."
Choo also found fault with the
idea that non-targeted minority
students suffer because they have
to learn about cultures not original
ly associated with traditional cur
riculum.
"Many people say I'm forced to
do this, I'm forced to do that, "Choo
said. "The truth is when you have
groups of different backgrounds
and cultures and you're forcing
them to study Western cultures,
you're still forcing them to study a
unilateral mode of thought."
However, while Miyahara be
lieves that multicultural program
ming is a good starting point, he
does not feel it is the ultimate an
swer.
"When you're on a dorm level,"
Miyahara said, "most of the learn
ing you do is between the hours of
11 and 3 at night where the stu
dents talk together and learn about
each other."
