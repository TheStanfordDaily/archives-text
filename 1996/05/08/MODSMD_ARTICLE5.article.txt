# Greek task force works on improving communication
## 
### Therese Lee Contributing writer 
The Greek Affairs Task Force held an open forum
last night in Kresge Auditorium in an effort to in
crease communication between the Greek system
and the University.
Led by Biology Prof. Bob Simoni, the task force
announced its three newly formed subcommittees.
The purpose of the first is to explore the educational
and social experience of Greek life at Stanford. The
second addresses the issue of campus housing for fra
ternities and sororities. The third focuses on the
Greek judicial system and relevant University sup
port.
"We're still very much in the information-collect
ing mode," said Simoni. "We are a task force consti
tuted by faculty, students and staff."

Simoni announced that surveys will be sent out
soon in order to solicit views of Greek life on campus.
The task force is also currently looking to recruit
additional student members. "The representation in
the end will be really quite broad." However, Simoni
said the task force, at present, has no female Greek
alumnae.
Better communication and improved policy clari
fications were among the concerns voiced by those
who attended the forum. Simoni promised to try to
achieve clearer expectations and policies.
"We are trying to foster open communication," he
said.
Several fraternity and sorority advisers called for
"better communication" and advised the University
to "put the policy in writing" as an effort to prevent
the Greek organizations from hav
ing to act on "rumors and innuen
does."
Those present repeatedly
voiced concern with the judicial
process. Judicial committee mem
ber Andy Hernandez, also a resi
dence dean, vowed that the task
force and the Committee of 15
would keep in touch with each
other so that they "proceed along
parallel and interactive paths."
The issue of possible sorority
housing and the recent eviction of
several fraternities came to the
forefront several times during the
forum.
"It is important that the sorori
ties have housing. All of the frater

nities support that," said the
Alumni Fraternity Council Presi
dent Robert Auleb. "Let the free
market decide whether the frater
nities should have a house and not
have an artificial one do it, decided
by the University."
The Delta Tau Delta fraterni
ty was evicted from its house at
the start of winter quarter. Last
year the Kappa Alpha and Beta
Theta Pi fraternities lost their
houses due to low membership
numbers.
"I think it's sad that in deciding
to come to Stanford I had to forfeit
my right to a housed sorority,"
said sophomore sorority member
Robin Tenold.
"Before I graduate I would real
ly like the opportunity to help a
sorority lay a foundation for a
house. I am asking you to expedite
the process," said Tenold.
