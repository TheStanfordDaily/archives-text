# Senate delays certification
## Graduate senators to be discussed at next meeting 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer 
Failing a quo
rum call, the
ASSU Senate
last night de
layed certifica
tion of portions
of last month's
election results
until Tuesday.
Although the
senate certified

the parts of the election pertaining
to constitutional amendments,
class presidents, the Council of
Presidents, undergraduate sena

tors and the special and general
fees, it failed to complete the certi
fication of the graduate senators
elected in the spring general elec
tion.
At issue were questions of how
the senate should proceed in
breaking ties in the election re
sults. Graduate senator Donald
Aingworth objected to the senate
taking any action on the matter,
citing a constitutional provision
entitling those individuals in
volved in a tie the right to speak
before the senate.
Elections Commissioner Ryan
Medders confirmed that some, but
not all, of those involved in ties

had declined to attend last night's
meeting. He admitted, however,
that some students were not
aware of their right. Graduate sen
ator Doug Natelson, himself in
volved in a tie, echoed Aingworth's
concern and urged the senate to
delay action.
Parliamentary maneuvering al
lowed the senate to verify the elec
tion of those graduate senators
unaffected by ties in all districts
but the Schools of Business, Law
and Medicine.
In that district, additional con
cern was raised that undergradu

ate senator Steve Russell was not
yet a member of the constituency
he had been elected to represent.
Russell has applied to the Law
School but has not yet been admit
ted.
COP member Nicole Vazquez
asked the senate not to certify
Russell's election on the grounds
he is ineligible to serve. Graduate
senators, led by Bernard Gilroy,
voiced strong opposition to remov
ing an elected senator.
If Russell were not seated as a
graduate senator-elect, a special
election would need to be called by
the next senate to fill his seat. Al
though the current constitution
would allow an alternate to as
sume Russell's voting power, pro

visions in "Constitution '96"
would leave the graduate popula
tion with only 14 senators, giving
undergraduates a majority.
Dissension occurred when it
was discovered that another grad
uate senator-elect, Michael Peter
son, had also not yet been accepted
into his graduate program. Peter
son's election, however, had al
ready been certified when objec
tions were raised. The ASSU Con
stitution prohibits the senate
from uncertifying an election's
outcome.
Senators' refusal to withdraw
their opposition to Russell's certi
fication led some to decry a "polit
ical witch hunt."
"We already let one slide blind
ly by because he doesn't happen to
have enemies in the senate,"
Gilroy said.
COP member Jon Oram, heck
led by Vazquez, implored the senate

to consider the will of the voters.
"We are talking about someone
who has been voted in by the stu
dents of Law, Business and Medi
cine. You would be clearly violat
ing the will of the students," Oram
said.
Russell was elected to the sen
ate with 36 votes.
The issue of graduate senator
certification, including Russell's,
remained on the table as the sen
ate recessed. The senate will meet
next Tuesday in the Thornton
Annex. It will continue to debate
graduate senator certification as
well as the remaining items on its
agenda: business office staff ap
pointments, the publications
board spring allocations and
bylaw reform.
Also scheduled for Tuesday are
a special meeting of the senate to
ratify "Constitution '96" and a
meeting of the senate-elect.

For the record

An article in yesterday's Daily
incorrectly stated that Hector
Cuevas will remain in his current
position as director at the Under
graduate Advising Center. In
stead, he will act as a staff mem
ber.
