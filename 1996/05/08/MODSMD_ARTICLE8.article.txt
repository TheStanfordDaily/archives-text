# Prof gains NAS membership

Another member of the Stanford faculty joined
the ranks of the prestigious National Academy of
Sciences, bringing the number of Stanford members
to 103.
Biology Prof. Chris Somerville, who directs the
plant biology department at the Carnegie Institution
of Washington, was elected as a new member last
week, along with 59 other distinguished scientists in
the country and 15 foreign associates.
Membership in the academy, a private organiza
tion of scientists and engineers established in 1863,
is lifelong. Members produce a scholarly journal and
serve on committees that provide the government
with information on a variety of topics.
Election to the academy is considered one of the
highest honors a scientist can achieve. Current
members, who number about 2,000, nominate po
tential new members then vote on the candidates.
"Being recognized by your peers is always nice,"
said Somerville, who has wanted to be a scientist
since he was a child.
Since 1993, Somerville has served as director of
the institute, a private organization on campus sup
ported by an endowment by Andrew Carnegie.
Though he is not teaching this quarter,
Somerville helped teach a graduate course last quar
ter on plant development with several other people,
including his wife Shauna, who herself is a scientist.
Somerville does research on the molecular genet
ics of plants and is interested in learning how to ge
netically alter plants so humans can use them more
efficiently.

"I am interested in expanding the materials we
gain from plants," Somerville said.
Somerville is working on developing innovative
forms of products such as oils, chemical precursors
and biodegradable plastic. His election to the acade
my recognized his work which helped transform a
relative of the mustard plant called Arabidopsis into
a model system for scientific study, used by thou
sands of scientists worldwide.
Among Somerville's other discoveries is a gene
that modifies the nutritional quality of vegetable
oils, which has led to several companies developing
edible oils that are better suited to human nutrition
al requirements. These oils are expected to reduce
the risk of arteriosclerosis associated with the con
sumption of dietary fats.
Somerville has implanted genes that cause Ara
bidopsis to accumulate beads of a biodegradable
plastic that closely resembles polypropylene in
large amounts. Montanto Corporation has ac
quired rights to the process and has a program
under way to engineer plastic-producing rapeseed
and soybean plants.
Another of Somerville's interests is making ge
netic changes in wild species of plants. According
to Somerville, humans currently use only a few
dozen species of plants because many wild species
are not adapted to humans' farming practices.
Somerville is working to make these species able to
adapt.
Born in Kingston, Ontario, Somerville earned his
bachelor's degree in math and his master's and doc
toral degrees in genetics at the University of Alberta.
Before coming to Stanford, Somerville served on the
faculties at Alberta and Michigan State University.
