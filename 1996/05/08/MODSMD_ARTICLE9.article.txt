# Judicial head reminisces
## Sally Cole waxes nostalgic about 14 years on the Farm 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
Former Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole shared stories from her
14 years on the job and spoke about
past and present student conduct
yesterday in Tresidder Union's Oak
Lounge.
Cole said she saw the Office of
Judicial Affairs undergo a system
atic development during her years
as its head. She went from a low
profile part-time staff member who
handled about a dozen Honor Code
cases a year in 1982 to a full-time
staff member who was managing
about 60 judicial cases and 60 inves
tigations annually by the time she
left her position last month.
She pointed at the increasing
cultural and racial diversity of stu
dents, as well as problems revolving
competing values, as reasons for
the expansion of her job and her of
fice. As examples of competing val
ues, Cole mentioned sexual harass
ment and freedom of expression.
Cole noted that the intensifying
engagement of the media and mem
bers not directly involved in the
case make it more difficult for the
current Judicial Affairs Office to
stay focused on standard values of
respect, fairness, clarity and consid

eration.
"An increasing involvement of
parents, lawyers and parents who
happen to be lawyers can be ob
served in the recent cases," joked
Cole.
The current legislative charter
has been in effect since 1968, when
the present disciplinary system was
established. Honor Code violations
are reported directly to the Judicial
Affairs Office and the administra
tor alone deals with the cases and
performs investigations.
Cole said she opposed this struc
ture, advocating a system in which
representatives of a council of stu
dents and a council of faculty form a
panel supervised by the administra
tion to discuss the cases.
"I have long been in favor of a
system governed by students and
faculty supported by administra
tion. Although this system may be
riskier, it is educationally stronger.
It will allow students and faculty to
be aware of what's going on. They
are the ones who are directly in
volved."
Cole reflected on her years as ju
dicial affairs officer, providing de
tailed and entertaining anecdotes of
past cases.
She told the audience of an inci
dent in Psychology Prof. Philip

Zimbardo's "Introduction to Psy
chology" class 10 years ago.
After a careful and lengthy ex
amination of quiz results by profes
sors, 12 students in the popular and
overcrowded class were suspended.
"I will never forget about the
time when one of the students [who
was suspended] came into my office
and asked me if I thought this
whole horrible experience he went
through was just another one of
Prof. Zimbardo's experiments,"
laughed Cole.
Many students who were in
volved in Cole's cases stay in touch,
she said, sending her cards and
stopping by to say hello. Most of
them are former students who were
either suspended or expelled, not
students who were given the bene
fit of the doubt.
"This makes sense," Cole said.
"We face these students [who vio
late the Honor Code] at a time of cri
sis in their lives. Good guidance and
a good judicial office can make a dif
ference. We helped them cope with
their problems. They are funda
mentally good people who did some
thing bad."
Cole currently serves as execu
tive director of the Center for Acad
emic Integrity, an international
consortium.
