No matter what you're saving
money for. U.S. Savings Bonds
make sense. They're backed by
the full faith and credit of the
United States. They earn interest
for up to 30 years. And their value
is guaranteed to grow at
market-based rates.
Ask your employer or banker about
saving with U.S. Savings Bonds.
Or for a recorded message of
current rate information, call
