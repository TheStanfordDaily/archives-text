# 'I don't think race was the issue in this case'
## Shapiro delivers the juice 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Robert Shapiro, one of the at
torneys who succeeded in win
ning the acquittal of O.J. Simp
son, came to Stanford yesterday
to defend his defense and pro
mote his new book in front of a
standing-room only audience at
Cubberley Auditorium.
Shapiro contended that while
the public was polarized along
racial lines by the case, the case
was decided on its merits — not
by racial considerations.
"Maybe I'm being naive,"
Shapiro said, "but I don't think
race was the issue in this case, or
should have been."
He acknowledged, however,
that the public often seemed to
think the case was decided on
racial grounds, and there was a
tremendous racial division in
public opinion, with black people
being far more likely to believe
Simpson innocent.

"We, as lawyers for the de
fense, are in part responsible for
this division," Shapiro admitted.
He was very critical of the de
cision of his fellow defense attor
neys to try to appeal to the most
ly black jury with historical ar
guments about racial oppression
and a comparison of Mark
Fuhrman, the police officer who
was a principal prosecution wit
ness, with Adolf Hitler.
He also criticized the general
practice known as jury nullifica
tion, whereby a lawyer tries to
convince a jury to reach a verdict
based not on the evidence but on
the social or political implica
tions of the case.
He said that while this might
be appropriate in, for example, a
civil rights case, it had no place in
a murder trial. However, he said
juries were intelligent enough
not to be swayed by such appeals,
and that his conversations with
the Simpson jury had convinced
him that they had been, if any

thing, insulted by the racial ap
peals.
But the public was led to
think the case was decided by
race because, Shapiro said, the
"self-appointed pundits" who
covered the case on television did
not properly explain the work
ings of the legal system, or the
difference between "legal jus
tice" and "moral justice."
In the U.S. legal system,
Shapiro explained, "we hope
that innocent people are never,
ever, convicted. The price is that
guilty people are sometimes ac
quitted."
He explained that whether or
not Simpson is innocent of the
murders "is a question that was
not determined in the case." All
that was determined, he said,
was that the evidence did not
prove that he was guilty.
He said an understanding of
this was necessary to making the
