# 'I don't think race was the issue in this case'
## Shapiro delivers the juice 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Robert Shapiro, one of the at
torneys who succeeded in win
ning the acquittal of O.J. Simp
son, came to Stanford yesterday
to defend his defense and pro
mote his new book in front of a
standing-room only audience at
Cubberley Auditorium.
Shapiro contended that while
the public was polarized along
racial lines by the case, the case
was decided on its merits — not
by racial considerations.
"Maybe I'm being naive,"
Shapiro said, "but I don't think
race was the issue in this case, or
should have been."
He acknowledged, however,
that the public often seemed to
think the case was decided on
racial grounds, and there was a
tremendous racial division in
public opinion, with black people
being far more likely to believe
Simpson innocent.

"We, as lawyers for the de
fense, are in part responsible for
this division," Shapiro admitted.
He was very critical of the de
cision of his fellow defense attor
neys to try to appeal to the most
ly black jury with historical ar
guments about racial oppression
and a comparison of Mark
Fuhrman, the police officer who
was a principal prosecution wit
ness, with Adolf Hitler.
He also criticized the general
practice known as jury nullifica
tion, whereby a lawyer tries to
convince a jury to reach a verdict
based not on the evidence but on
the social or political implica
tions of the case.
He said that while this might
be appropriate in, for example, a
civil rights case, it had no place in
a murder trial. However, he said
juries were intelligent enough
not to be swayed by such appeals,
and that his conversations with
the Simpson jury had convinced
him that they had been, if any

thing, insulted by the racial ap
peals.
But the public was led to
think the case was decided by
race because, Shapiro said, the
"self-appointed pundits" who
covered the case on television did
not properly explain the work
ings of the legal system, or the
difference between "legal jus
tice" and "moral justice."
In the U.S. legal system,
Shapiro explained, "we hope
that innocent people are never,
ever, convicted. The price is that
guilty people are sometimes ac
quitted."
He explained that whether or
not Simpson is innocent of the
murders "is a question that was
not determined in the case." All
that was determined, he said,
was that the evidence did not
prove that he was guilty.
He said an understanding of
this was necessary to making the

presumption of innocence work,
and that people who saw Simp
son's acquittal as proof that the
legal system is radically flawed did
not realize this.
"This is not the time for an
overhaul of our legal system based
on one case and one case only,"
Shapiro said.
But, Shapiro said, given what
a "not-guilty" verdict means in
the present system, the Simpson
jury gave the only verdict they
justly could.

He was at times critical of the
prosecution in the case, noting
that the 45 lawyers and dozens of
investigators used by the District
Attorney made the claim that they
tried Simpson like any other de
fendant ridiculous.
He also attacked them for their
treatment of Fuhrman, who he
said was a "bigot" and a liar who
"had no credibility."
"Not only did they call Mark
Fuhrman, they embraced Mark
Fuhrman," he said, adding that
even the prosecutors did not be
lieve Fuhrman but thought they
could attack any of the witnesses
who were brought against him.
In between talking about the

law, Shapiro took plenty of time
out to make his enthusiastic audi
ence laugh, beginning by coming
on stage with a fire extinguisher
after the speech was delayed for
several minutes by order of the
fire marshal.
Neither in his speech nor in his
book "Search for Justice," which he
is on tour promoting, does Shapiro
answer the question that everyone
wanted to ask and one member of
the audience actually did: "Did O.J.
doit?"
Shapiro could only say that nei
ther he nor the questioner was
there, but he added later that "the
defining moment will be when
O.J. testifies at the civil trial."
