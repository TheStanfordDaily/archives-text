An angry Julie Andrews reads a statement turning down her
Tony awards nomination on the stage of her hit Broadway show
"Victor I Victoria" yesterday in New York. The 60-year-old
actress was upset that the awards committee ignored everyone
else in the show. The Tony's producers said her name would
remain on the nomination list.
