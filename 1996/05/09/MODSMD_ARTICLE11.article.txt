# Clinton to cut gas tax
## Economists question if consumers will benefit 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton said yesterday he would accept a
temporary cut in the gasoline tax as
Republicans have proposed, but some
economists questioned how much of the
reduction ever will get to consumers.
Clinton said he would sign the gas tax
repeal only in tandem with a separate bill
raising the minimum wage. The two
issues have stalled the Senate all week.
Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
had offered to push both a tax reduction
and a minimum wage increase in a single
bill, but also attached a controversial
change in labor law that is strongly
opposed by unions.
The dispute brought the Senate to a
halt yesterday, blocking consideration of
other legislation including health care
and welfare reform.
"I am offering a way to break the log
jam," Clinton told a White House news
conference. Dole later suggested he
might agree to three separate bills, but
details were not clear.
Clinton emphasized he only would
sign the gas tax and minimum wage bills
if they were free of "poison pills" — such
as Dole's proposed labor law change.
Clinton's pronouncement was the first
clear indication that he would accept a
gasoline tax cut, albeit with some condi
tions.
It came as Republican and Democratic
lawmakers sparred both on the Senate
floor and in two House committees over
whether the gas tax cut — as well as a
decision by Clinton to draw on emergen
cy oil stocks — actually will drive down
gasoline prices.
Dole told reporters he is convinced that
the lower taxes will mean lower prices.
"Whatever the price ends up being, it will
be 4.3 cents lower," insisted Dole.

But several economists, testifying
before two House committees, ques
tioned whether the gas tax reduction
would force down gasoline prices, which
have jumped 20 cents or more a gallon
since February.
"I don't think you'll see it," said Philip
Verleger, an oil industry analyst for
Charles River Associates. "It's not going
to get reflected in the retail price, cer
tainly not until after Labor Day."
Verleger told the House Commerce
Energy and Power Subcommittee that
tight gasoline supplies and summer driv
ing demand would ease pressure on refin
ers and gasoline station operators to pass
the tax on to motorists.
"The refiners are going to have a
strong incentive to put it in their pocket
and rejoice," said Rep. John Dingell, D-
Mich.
Jan Paul Acton, an economist for the
Congressional Budget Office, said that
traditionally only about half of fuel tax
reductions end up as retail price reduc
tions.
Oil industry representatives dis
agreed.
"I'm convinced almost all of (the tax
cut) is going to come back to the con
sumer sooner rather than later," said
Charles Dißona, president of the Ameri
can Petroleum Institute, the trade group
representing large oil companies.
But even Dißona acknowledged the
effect of the tax cut might not be appar
ent to motorists because other market
factors might force prices to increase
even as the 4.3 cent tax is taken out.
"You won't see a $1.29 on one day and
$1.24 the next," agreed John Lichtblau,
chairman of the Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation, which is funded by
the oil companies.
