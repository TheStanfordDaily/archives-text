Too chilly?
BOSTON (AP) — Keeping the operating room chilly for the
comfort of the surgeons raises the patient's risk of infection
dramatically and slows healing, a study found. The simple and
highly effective solution: blankets.
Typically, operating rooms are kept around 65 degrees so
heavily gowned surgeons won't sweat under the bright lights.
Making matters worse, anesthesia interferes with the body's
ability to regulate its own temperature. As a result, patients
often cool down during surgery to around 94.5 degrees.
Doctors concerned about this set out to see what would
happen if they kept patients around a normal 98 degrees dur
ing surgery. They heated up their intravenous fluids and cov
ered them with special air-warmed blankets.
The extra attention cost $30, and the benefits were sub
stantial. Patients having colon operations suffered only one
third the usual surgical wound infections. They healed faster
and were sent home sooner.
"Isn't it amazing that something that is risk-free and has
such trivial cost provides such benefit?" said Dr. Daniel
Sessler, one of the researchers.
Factions battle on in Monrovia
MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) — Rival factions battled yester
day in the streets of the Liberian capital, pounding one anoth
er with machine gun fire and grenades as peace talks outside
the warring country collapsed.
The talks in nearby Ghana were called off after most West
African leaders failed to show. Even before the cancellation,
there had been doubts the summit would succeed because
Liberian warlords Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah refused
to attend.
Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings, closing the aborted
summit, warned warring faction leaders that West African
nations are on the verge of pulling their peacekeeping forces
out of Liberia, given faction leaders' flouting of an August
peace accord.
