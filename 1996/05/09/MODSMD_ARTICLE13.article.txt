# Kevorkian attends suicide while on trial

DETROIT (AP) â€” In one of his most
brazen acts yet, Dr. Jack Kevorkian attended
another suicide while on trial for two earlier
deaths.
Austin Bastable, a Canadian right-to-die
activist who had multiple sclerosis, died Mon
day at the home of another assisted-suicide
advocate, Janet K. Good, in the Detroit suburb
of Farmington Hills, police said yesterday.
The Right to Die Society of Canada said
Kevorkian gave the 53-year-old Bastable the
mask and carbon monoxide canister he used to
die.

"My death is a blow for freedom," Bastable
said in a videotape released in Toronto, "not
just for myself but for all rational Canadians
who may at some time in the future wish to
decide for themselves how they may die."
Just hours earlier Monday, Kevorkian tes
tified at his assisted-suicide trial in nearby
Pontiac in the 1991 deaths of two women.
"It's an in-your-face kind of thing," said
Michael Modelski, a former prosecutor who
dealt with Kevorkian. "It's par for the course.
He's a loose cannon."
It was unclear what effect Bastable's death

might have on Kevorkian's third assisted-sui
cide trial, which was in recess until today,
apart from an evidence hearing previously
scheduled for yesterday afternoon.
It is the 28th reported suicide Kevorkian
has attended since 1990.
In the past, Kevorkian has taken part in
two suicides at once. He has left bodies in vehi
cles outside the coroner's office. He once
assisted in a suicide the same day a judge ruled
he must stand trial in an earlier death. B\it
never before had he been present at a suicide
while a trial was under way.
