# Yelstin rival may ally with Russian president
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - Amid
mounting tensions over a tight
presidential race, a rival of Boris
Yeltsin said yesterday he was ready
to discuss a possible alliance with
the Russian president to prevent a
Communist victory.
Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal
economist who met with Yeltsin
for more than two hours Sunday,
said he intended to meet with the
president again soon.
"The issue that we are going to
discuss would be a first in Russian
history — a political coalition
between the government and
democratic opposition," Yavlinsky
said on BBC television's The
Andrew Neil Show.
"The democratic opposition can
be in coalition with Yeltsin in order
to prevent the victory of Mr. (Gen

nady) Zyuganov," he said, refer
ring to the Communist leader.
Yeltsin said Tuesday that he
wanted further talks with Yavlin
sky and hoped "to unite all of the
democratic-minded presidential
candidates."
The Kremlin has shown
increasing signs of tension over the
June election. Some polls show
Zyuganov and Yeltsin in a virtual
dead heat, but others have
Zyuganov clinging persistently to
the lead. Yavlinsky's candidacy is
seen as potentially siphoning votes
away from Yeltsin.
Gen. Alexander Korzhak,
Yeltsin's personal security chief
and close confidant, earlier this
week warned of possible civil war if
the Communists win and urged
that the elections be postponed.
