### 
University procedures
were proven ineffective
on PepsiCo stock vote

LAST WEEK, STANFORD'S
administrators failed a basic
test of management. As a
major stockholder in PepsiCo, the
University had the opportunity to
voice its opinion on the investment
policies of that company. The issue
at stake was a shareholder resolu
tion recommending that PepsiCo
examine the human rights records
of those countries in which it
invests. And what did PepsiCo hear
from Stanford University on this
issue, dear to the hearts of many
students? Nothing. The Stanford
Board of Trustee's Special Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility
made its decision on the resolution
too late.
By failing to make its decision on
time, the Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility (SCIR)
not only shirked its duty, but also
sent the message to students and
faculty that their concerns about
University investment policy are
unworthy of prompt consideration.
The SCIR was created for the
express purpose of deliberating and
deciding on issues like the human
rights resolution. Good corporate
citizenship entails the serious con
sideration of every shareholder res
olution, and as a leading education
al institution, Stanford should be
particularly sensitive to resolutions
concerning social responsibility.
Fortunately, the SCIR decision
came in time for the University to
vote on similar shareholder resolu
tions at Texaco and Unocal share
holders' meetings.
In light of the SCIR's handling of
the PepsiCo vote, a review of the
process by which such decisions are
reached is in order. Stanford com
munity members have a legitimate
concern in the investment policies of
the University, both for financial

and ethical reasons. Under the cur
rent system, those concerns are sup
posed to be raised with the Advisory
Panel on Investment Responsibility
(APIR) — a panel made up of stu
dents, faculty, staff and alumni. The
APIR is then supposed to forward
its recommendations to the SCIR.
In the PepsiCo case, the APIR's rec
ommendation was eventually fol
lowed, but the SCIR decision simply
came too late for Stanford to cast a
vote at the shareholders' meeting.
In all fairness to the SCIR, the APIR
forwarded its recommendation only
days before the vote, thus giving it
only a very short amount of time in
which to act. In short, community
concerns were drowned in the
bureaucratic alphabet soup.
With an investment fund of more
than $3 billion and a prestigious
name, Stanford can exert consider
able influence on corporate invest
ment policies, and community
members have every reason to
expect that the University take that
responsibility seriously. Giving stu
dents and faculty a voice on the
SCIR is one simple way to prove the
University's commitment to real
investment responsibility. Students
serve on five other Board of
Trustees Committees, so their
involvement in the SCIR would not
be unprecedented. Moreover, stu
dent and faculty representation
would insure that community con
cerns are addressed at the decision
making level. Under the current
system, the SCIR has no real incen
tive to listen to student and faculty
concerns about investment policy; it
can completely disregard APIR rec
ommendations with impunity. Stu
dent and faculty representation on
the SCIR would streamline the pro
cess by which community concerns
about University investment policy
are handled.
Ever since students protested
University investments in
apartheid-era South Africa,
"investment responsibility" has
been a buzzword at Stanford. It
is time for the University to
prove that it pays more than lip
service to its own buzzwords.
