## Lessons from an ugly dog 
### 
I HAVE BEEN lucky enough to own an
ugly, ugly dog. "Daisy" (affectionately
nicknamed "Dandelion" by my
friends) was famous for her rampant
ugliness, a walking laboratory for God's
cruelties. Time and again he mercilessly
rained blows upon her tiny frame with
his proverbial ugly stick.
Daisy was unfortunate from birth,
with a set of genes that barely scraped
together the necessary parts to form a
dog, much less allow that dog to flourish.
Her first owner, apparently unable to
cope or frightened she would bring a
plague on his home, left her on the
doorstep of my father's office. My father,
a pitying soul, called my mother and
asked permission to bring her home.
After receiving a stern "no" he brought
her home and deposited her into the arms
of his two children; at which point my
mother could either play along or play
Cruella de Ville and banish her to the
pound. Of course, the dog stayed and for
14 years we watched her ugliness unfold.
Obviously the love child of terrier and
some other runty breed, Daisy never
grew much higher than my kneecaps and
sprouted a coat with the texture and color
of a mechanic's mop. She was a proud
heathen, seizing every opportunity to roll
in mud or chew the legs off a dead squir
rel (one of her greatest digestive feats,
alongside consuming a zip-lock bag and a
Christmas ornament made of wire and
popcorn). Her poor personal hygiene,

combined with a bi-yearly bathing sched
ule, made her less than pleasant to touch.
But, being already the color of dirt, one
rarely knew what she had added to her
armor of grime that day.
Old age brought new horrors on the
poor beast. A bizarre allergic reaction to
our neighbor's lawn pesticides stripped
off most of her fur. Her gray, leathery
hide, once exposed, became mottled with
liver spots, moles and lesions. Medication
for these ails produced only furious over
eating, ballooning up her naked little
body like a sausage. An inflamed kidney
bloomed out of her back, as if her body,
robbed of its uterus in early life, was
attempting to reproduce asexually, bud
ding off a carbon copy of its self. Her tail
mysteriously acquired a bend which
never straightened itself out. Her vision
failed, as did her hearing. Arthritis froze
her legs and paws. Her mind turned dull
and demented. Finally, two weeks after I
came to Stanford, the local veterinarian
brought Daisy to a merciful end.
Ugly dogs are perhaps the quintessen
tial "victimless crime." Daisy knew noth
ing of her shortcomings or the humor we
found in them. She knew only the pats on
her head and the saccharine tone given to
her name. Each time she found scram
bled eggs in her bowl instead of dry dog
food she knew she was loved.
Certainly there are examples of out
standing pedigree out there, the blemish
free specimens that grace the runways of

dog shows (or beauty pageants). But they
are rare and, honestly, not very interest
ing either. Loving the beautiful or perfect
doesn't speak for our humanity like the
ability to suspend all aesthetics, all reali
ty, and love the ugly.
Unlike dogs, we bear the cross of self
awareness. We sense when we're ugly
and look for confirmation in the eyes of
others. Parents seem to provide our fun
damental buffer against this twisted self
knowledge. It's no coincidence that the
word most befitting an ugly personality
— "bastard" — also denotes parentless
ness. At times parents can flex this
power. It's the crux of their sharpest
barb, the line they reserve for our great
est failures: "We're disappointed in you."
But generally they're famous for their
oblivious love.
Before anyone becomes a parent they
should learn this selflessness. They
should learn to love another without
reservation, to let them find their own
happiness and relinquish any right or
desire to judge that happiness. Maybe
they should start by getting a dog — a
criminally, sinfully, irretrievably, unde
niably ugly dog — and loving it because it
is their own.
