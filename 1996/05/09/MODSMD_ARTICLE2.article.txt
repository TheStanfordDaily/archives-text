# President will announce new academic initiatives
## Changes include new faculty, fellowship program 
### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
University President Gerhard
Casper will unveil new initiatives
for undergraduate and graduate
education today in a speech that
has been billed as a major poUcy
address.
Speaking to the Faculty Sen
ate, he will reportedly announce
that thanks to a sizable donation,
Stanford will hire a number of
new faculty members to imple
ment changes in the first two
years of undergraduate education.
Casper will also announce a fel
lowship program intended to
bring the world's top graduate
students to Stanford, The Daily
has learned.
Casper's speech will bring
nearer to action the recommenda
tions of the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education, which he
established in 1993.
"On the whole, the attention

paid to undergraduate education
has been for a long time quite sig
nificant," Casper said in an inter
view yesterday. "We should review
activities regularly and take a

fresh start."
The commis
sion in 1994
recommended
changes to distri
bution require
ments and the
addition of a sci
ence curriculum.
It also implored
the University to
create more stu-

dent-faculty interaction during
students' first two years.
Casper discussed the differ
ences in approaching changes to
centralized undergraduate educa
tion vs. graduate education —
which is run almost entirely by de
partments and schools with little
interaction, he said.
"Graduate students share no

common culture — not even the
Quad," he said.
In his speech, Casper will ad
dress plans to strengthen the aca
demic structure each undergradu
ate experiences during the first
two years, in a program that will
reportedly be called "Stanford In
troductory Studies."
Casper admitted that the first
two years, called the "general edu
cation" period, cannot provide
students with the broad education
it purports to offer.
"It is impossible for 100 years.
It is impossible for four years," he
said. "The question is how are you
selective and what do you want to
accomplish — what are your main
priorities."
Today, Casper will also report
edly announce the creation of
freshman seminars, giving inter
ested students the opportunity to
study in small groups with faculty.

The program will be integrated
into the Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues and the Writing and Critical
Thinking requirements. The do
nation will expand the Universi
ty's faculty resources, providing

support for incremental billets
over the next several years.
Casper said small-group inter
action can occur with existing re
sources, if colleges and depart
ments successfully re-allocate and
become more efficient.
"Each department must take a
critical look on how it uses its
teaching resources," he said.
Casper's speech will not con

clude the examination of under
graduate education, he said. Due to
rising tuition, decreasing funding
from the government and the tech
nology revolution, he said Stanford
must continue to be innovative.
"Undergraduate education will
remain a subject to which we will
pay a lot of attention," he said.
"The challenges we face will be
considerable."
