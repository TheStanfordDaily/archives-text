Letter unfairly characterized campus Chicano community

MAURO J. CARDENAS' letter in
yesterday's Daily does bring out
some important issues that our
community has been dealing with for as
long as I or even any graduate student can
remember. We have had a number of com
munity meetings this year to discuss this
issue, and if Cardenas has been in atten
dance, he surely knows how touchy the
issues can be. The only way I can respond
to his opinions is personally. I do not speak
for the other Chicanos on this campus.
First, I was offended at thejudgment
that "Chicanos whine about anything that
does not go their way." Since when does
voicing my opinion become whining? Or is
it because what Chicanos are often saying
disturbing that this becomes whining? Just
because something makes you uncomfort
able doesn't mean it should be suppressed.
Second, if Cardenas and other Latinos
(because his assumption was that all Lati

nos do this) do not support a boycott on
grapes, I am really saddened by that. I
grew up as a migrant farm worker picking
grapes alongside my family in the San
Joaquin valley. No one can tell me that the
way we were treated and the pesticides
laced on those vineyards was good for our
health. Having seen the injustices first
hand, the boycott is a viable issue for me. I
am insulted that Cardenas would consider
my sharing this story as whining. And yes,
I would attribute this to racism. It is called
environmental racism and the state of Cal
ifornia and the U.S. government have
done studies on these practices.
Also on the point of immigrant oppres
sion, I was raised in a border town and
have seen the way undocumented people
are treated. These injustices in south
Texas aren't just practiced against Mexi
cans, but Guatemalans, Salvadorans and
other people from Central America. And

aren't they also Latinos? If immigrant
"oppression" isn't a concern for Latinos,
then why are there immigrant refugee
rights centers in this country, many of
which serve Latinos?
I will concede to Cardenas one point:
There are Chicanos who are exclusive and
ethnocentric. There are some, who as a
friend of mine so eloquently put it, carry a
"Chicano meter." But those are just a few
voices in a community of 600-plus stu
dents. Please give me the respect of not
associating me with those people. I am not
one of them and it is a dishonor to our
community to label us all under behavioral
patterns that manyChicanos / Tejanos
/ Mexican Americans abhor. We are not all
alike and that is what this all boils down
to.
If Cardenas and other Latino students
feel excluded from the community, per
haps they should read the mail El Centro

Chicano sends out to know what is going
on. If they feel that no one is discussing
the balseros of Cuba, development in
Venezuela or elections in Nicaragua, all it
takes is a little motivation to get those pro
grams going. It is understandable that the
Chicano community doesn't do these
things. What I know is my experience and
I would never dare to call an informational
meeting on an issue I know little about.
Those who are best prepared to share
should do it.
That is the challenge our community
faces. After all the community meetings
and e-mails, I must ask what will the voic
es of discontent do? I would like to think
that I am much more on Cardenas' side
than the ethnocentries he describes. But
one doesn't make allies by insulting their
issues. Cardenas insulted mine.
