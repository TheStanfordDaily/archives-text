# Conclusions from study on athletes' psychology are faulty, athlete says
## 
### 
I am writing in response to the "Hard
Knocks for Jocks" article which appeared
in Tuesday's Daily concerning a new study
by Profs. Hans Steiner and Ross McQuivey
which suggests that college athletes are
more prone to psychological disorders than
the average sedentary Joe. Let me say how
much stock I put in these findings: none.
Far be it from me, a thoroughbred
fuzzy, to contest the Findings of Science,
but I will because I just hate to lose.
According to the study, 59 percent of
college athletes demonstrate a "repressive
adaptive style," or the tendency "to
repress the possibility of failure and con
centrate on winning," as opposed to only
25 percent of the laymen. Actually, I have
no problems with these numbers, nor do I
doubt the integrity of this empirical inves

tigation, but what I do question is why
Steiner and McQuivey consider this
"repressive adaptive style" a curse in the
first place. That's not science, that's just a
hunch. As an athlete myself, I confirm its
existence, but I also herald its truth, I con
sider it a great asset. My friends and I on
the track team have a different name for
the "repressive adaptive style," albeit less
scientific; that is, delusion.
The power of delusion, the ability to
convince yourself you can do things that
you wouldn't be able to do under normal
circumstances is absolutely invaluable to
me, both as an athlete and a as student.
Delusion is just as important to me when
I attempt to beat someone who's run 30
seconds faster than me over 10,000
meters as it is when I attempt to under
stand Descartes' dualism at 3 a.m. â€” both
very daunting tasks.
This particular study is bungled because
it considers the athletic realm entirely
apart from the scholastic; the former being
a fantasy land where everybody wins, the
latter being "the real world" where failure

is a real possibility. The truth is, failure is
always a real possibility, no matter if you
are on the track or in the Center for Inte
grated Systems. Sure, athletes fear failure,
but who doesn't? What's the alternative-to
adopt some defeatist attitude, to enter into
a challenge ready to fail? I don't think any
of us at Stanford believe in this alternative.
I think back to my "Read Along" years,
when I was first introduced to the virtues
of the "repressive adaptive style" in the
form of "The Little Engine That Could."
That little train was not the most powerful,
but it refused to give up on its climb, or, if
you choose, it repressed the possibility of
failure. When it conquered the hill ("I
think I can! I think I can!") the Little
Engine set a precedent that has enabled
me to confront many trials.
At the end of Tuesday's article, after I
was already up-in-arms, I read that the
study is "preliminary and tentative." Of
course it is. I don't think that the Little
Engine is guilty of any severe psychosis.
