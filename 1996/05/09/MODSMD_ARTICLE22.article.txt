# Education school dean clarifies Daily article
## 
### 
I was pleased to see Monday's article
in The Daily about initiatives in the
School of Education. However, the
statement about a decrease in school
funding of social services over the past
25 years, attributed to me, was incor
rectly reported.
Schools do not provide the social ser
vices. My point was, with recent legisla
tion in Washington, there is good reason
to expect many social services will be
transferred to local communities as
block grants. The amount of money in
the block grants will be substantially
less than present funding levels, even
though the demand for services will
increase. Many communities may not
have the capacity to provide the level of
service needed.
