# Josh Gohlke: Laughing leads to crying
## The 						most important rule: Don't leave the Deke house 
### 
MY GRANDFATER ALWAYS tells
me, "I can still remember that
day in the hospital when you
were born." I invariably reply, "I remem
ber it, too, Grandpa, mostly in the form of
a vague sensation that everything was
going wrong."
That sensation has never left me —
rather, it has lost most of its vagueness
and become a distinct understanding.
Throughout grade school, I was a neurot
ic dork who cried and got beat up a lot; in
high school, I was an unlikeable loner;
and anyone who has been reading my
weekly tirades knows plenty about how
the college years have been.
However, even as a caged hamster
spends its whole life trying to get out, so
I, too, have always struggled against my
own inescapable fate. I have done this via
the creation of rules.
Needless to say, the formulation of a
new rule after every mistake I made soon
resulted in an astronomical number of
precepts, prescripts and principles —
enough to fill several volumes and far too
many for handy memorization. Thus, the
goal soon became consolidation. Specific
rules had to be combined and condensed

to form more general and inclusive ones.
In ninth grade, for instance, "Avoid
Tina" and "Avoid Erin" were combined
to form, "Avoid girls with criminal
records."
What I wish to speak about now is the
final culmination of the process this
quarter in a Grand Unification Theory of
sorts. Aided by the wisdom of a few like
minded friends, I have peaked the pyra
mid of converging rules with a single, elo
quently stated Rule, which, if faithfully
followed, prevents the violation of any
and all of the other important rules.
This Rule No. 1 reads, quite simply,
Never Leave the Deke House.
It works. Everything evil and harmful
in the world exists outside of the walls of
my house, and I can account for any mis
fortune that befalls me by quietly repri
manding myself for the breach that must
have occurred: "That's it. I broke Rule
No. 1. I shouldn't have left the Deke
House."
A brief and by no means complete list
of the dangers that lurk outside the sanc
tuary of the house may serve to illustrate
the infallibility — the indispensability —
of Rule No.l.

Girls
Back in the day when I was a reluctant
freshman, I remember saying to one of
the seniors at the house, "I don't know if
I want to live in a place where there
aren't any girls." He said, "Oh, there are
girls around the house all the time." It
was a shameless lie, but I deserved it for
making such an idiotic comment. Now,
on the rare occasions when girls do show
up at the house, I feel nothing but a
strong urge to make them leave. This is
because girls will consistently 1) make
me start thinking about girls or 2) talk to
me. Adherence to Rule No. 1 usually pre
vents these negative effects and many
others.
Classes
Classes are another example of the
disastrous results of leaving the Deke
house. I have never once heard a lecture
or been in a discussion section in the
house, mainly because there are no class
es there. Furthermore, not only are
classes a major effect of Rule No. 1 viola
tions, they are also a major cause. When
I came to realize the latter last quarter, 1
decided that I would have to stop taking

classes. It worked; my violations of the
Rule have decreased by almost 90 per
cent.
Car Accidents
When Brad got hit by a car on campus
last quarter, wrecking his bike and tem
porarily crippling him, some of us had
trouble feeling much pity for him. "Did
you leave the Deke house?" we asked.
"Yeah," he said. "I did." No one has ever
been hit by a car inside the house.
Campus Tours
It's happened to me many times. I'm
going about my business as quickly and
quietly as possible, and suddenly a guy
with a ponytail walking backwards
knocks me over. "Here's Roble, the
biggest dorm at Stanford," he says, as 30
tourists trample me further into the
ground.
Dorms
I have seen the real Stanford Prison
Experiment, and it's called Wilbur. Every
time I find myself surrounded by blank,
pastel walls, I know I have to get back to
the house before an RA convinces me to

wear a "Cal Sucks!" T-shirt and go on a
scavenger hunt in the City.
Normal Human Beings
As soon as I step outside of the house,
the disenfranchisement begins. My pasty
complexion, bloodshot eyes, bad haircut
and poor enunciation are no longer com
monplace. I fear your strange machines
and unfathomable customs. I will never
fit into your crazy world.
Sorority Formals
The first corollary to Rule No. 1 is,
"Never leave the house with a suit on."
Next thing you know, you're at a sorority
formal and you're absolutely miserable.
Stanford
The Deke house is completely Stan
ford-locked, which means leaving by any
exit puts one right in the middle of Stan
ford University. Not only are you leaving
the house — you're going to Stanford.
This is the most convincing argument for
strict observance of Rule No. 1.
