Keep on winning.
That's what the No. 9 Stanford baseball team
hopes to do as it winds up its regular-season schedule
and prepares for postseason play. Last night, the
Cardinal kept its winning streak alive, notching its
14th consecutive victory in an 11-2 drubbing of Saint
Mary's.
The current streak ties a string put together by
the 1978 team for second-longest in Stanford base
ball history. Mark Marquess' squad will aim to tie the
school record of 15 games without a loss when it
hosts UC-Davis at Sunken Diamond Sunday after
noon.
The Cardinal's win over the Gaels (12-35) was an
other successful night for both the pitching staff and
the bats, as Stanford collected 13 hits while holding
Saint Mary's to just two. Junior Brendan Sullivan (2-
0) made his first start and worked four innings, al
lowing one run, to earn the win. The submarine-style
pitcher faced just nine batters through the first three
innings before allowing two hits in the fourth.
"Brendan has pitched well for us all year," Mar
quess said. "We've asked him to do some middle relief
and to go short and gave him a start today. He really
responds to whatever we ask him to do."
Sullivan said he was comfortable in the starting
role, even though he had not been in that situation
since high school.
"It's a little different," Sullivan said. "It's the
preparation that's different — I'm used to coming
down and doing my running before the game and
then chilling down here until its time for me to get
ready. To have a set time to warm up and to know
when you have to go out there is a little different."
Three Stanford pitchers followed Sullivan to the
mound, and each left without surrendering a Gael
hit. Sophomore Josh Koons worked the fifth and the
sixth innings, recording three strikeouts. J.D. Bram
mer was overpowering in his two-inning stint, strik
ing out the side in the eighth. Brammer struck out
four Gaels and walked one.
Freshman Brent Hoard entered the contest in the
ninth inning and struck out two to close out the
game.
The left-hander from Bellarmine Prep in San Jose
drew the praises of Sullivan following his outing.
"Brent is going to be a great pitcher here," Sullivan
said. "He's got great stuff — his stuff is as good as any
