# The 						river runs deep for women's tennis
## Bleszynski, Schlukebir take spotlight, but bottom of the lineup is near-invincible 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
One of the single most impressive
facts about the second-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team is that its
No. 5 singles player captured the Pa
cific 10 Conference singles title. Even
more impressive might be that its No.
7 singles player, who doesn't compete
in dual-match singles play, took the
singles title at the Ojai Invitational
while playing against other teams'
No. 3 and No. 4 players.
While much attention is often
showered upon All-Americans Katie
Schlukebir and Ania Bleszysnki and
the top of the Cardinal lineup, it may
have been the team's depth that led
Stanford to its ninth straight Pac-10
title this season. That depth will no
doubt be crucial in the Cardinal's run
for an NCAA championship in two
weeks.
"We're deep," said Stanford head
coach Frank Brennan. "We don't lose
anything as move down the lineup.
Our No. 5 player just got a chance to
play with the big girls and she won
the whole thing. As far as depth goes,
1 think we're looking very good."
Indeed, the bottom of the Cardinal
lineup has been nothing short of in
vincible. In dual-match competition,
the Cardinal starters at No. 5 singles
(sophomore JulieScott), No. 6 singles
(senior Amy Chiminello) and No. 3
doubles (junior Emily Burt and se
nior Beth Berris) have compiled a 47-
2 record on the year.
Scott was quietly posting an im
pressive season, with a 19-1 dual
match record. The silence was broken
two weeks ago when she seized the
Pac-10 singles title in Ojai, Calif.
With that performance, Scott cata
pulted herself into the NCAA singles
draw and onto the All-Pac-10 Second
Team along with junior teammate
Sandra De Silva. Among Scott's vic
tims at Ojai was Arizona State's No. 1
player, lleka Cseresnyes, who was
named to the All-Pac-10 First Team.
"Julie is a tremendous talent,"
Brennan said. "I don't think anybody
at the No. 5 position plays with her
athletic ability, and she is playing
great. We keep telling her how good
she is and she's believing it, because
she really is."
Chiminello, right next to Scott on
the No. 6 court, refused to be outdone
by the sophomore throughout the

year, posting another tremendous
season in dual-match play at 20-1.
The senior has not lost in a dual
match since February and will finish
her illustrious career in fourth place
in the Stanford record books for most
dual-match victories (85).
"Amy is the perfect player for the
No. 6 spot," Brennan said. "She is so
disciplined and she fights so hard.
She has so much confidence."
Meanwhile, Burt and Berris have
yet to lose a match this year at the No.
3 doubles slot. They carried their un
defeated 7-0 record to Ojai and lost in
the semifinals to the No. 1
squad.
Berris, a senior, commented on the
history of Stanford dominance in the
bottom half of the lineup.
"Traditionally with Stanford, I
knew when I came here that Nos. 4, 5
and 6 just didn't lose," she said. "The

expectations are so high, and that has
just carried over to Amy and Julie.
They have just had a tremendous
record this year. Theyjust come in ex
pecting to win.
"There's not a thought in their
brain that they are going to lose and I
think the team has that confidence in
them. I always know Amy and Julie
are going to win. I feel that way with
Emily and I, too."
The bottom of Stanford's lineup
also brings an incredible amount of
experience to the squad, which can be
just as crucial to the Cardinal's suc
cess as the wins. Berris and
Chiminello, with eight years of colle
giate tennis between the two of them,
are the team's co-captains for the sec
ond straight season. Senior Kim
Shasby, the No. 4 singles competitor,
is also a fifth-year senior on a roster
that includes no freshmen.

"This is clearly the most experi
enced team we've ever had here,"
Brennan said. "It really helps a lot to
have players like that. They know you
and you know them. You don't have
to wonder how they are going to react
to things."
Berris echoed how important that
experience has been for her and the
other Cardinal veterans.
"I think that experience goes a
long way," she said. "We've all been
playing matches for so long — at the
top of the lineup, at the bottom, in all
different situations. And a lot of
times, freshmen will be playing at our
spots at other schools. I think it just
helps our team intimidating other
teams and helps us with our confi
dence.
"I mean, I've played matches for a

In a remarkable demonstration of the team's depth, Stanford tennis players (from left to right) Kim Shasby, Amy
Chiminello, Julie Scott, Emily Burt, Katie Schlukebir, Ania Bleszynski and Beth Berris show head coach Frank
Brennan (seated, left) and assistant Lele Forood that there is strength in numbers.
long time. I get nervous, but I
don't get the 'oh-my-gosh-people
are-watching-me* nerves."
And seeing a freshman across
the net from Amy Chiminello
doesn't hurt the Cardinal's
chances for victory.
"I just kind of laugh," Berris
said. "I mean, there's no way."
Much of the team's focus comes
from its co-captains, Chiminello
and Berris.
"Beth is sort of the mother fig
ure, while Amy does a lot more of
the butt-kicking," Brennan said.
"Every team has some grinding
going on, and Beth is the oil that
makes it all work smoothly."
The depth of the Cardinal line
up extends even further down the
lineup, beyond the starters. Non
starters have combined for a 23-2
record this season and have yet to
lose a singles match (11-0).
"It makes the starters not take
their positions for granted, which
is easy to do," Berris said. "When
they see that all of us are winning
our matches, it pushes them also."
Berris, who sits at No. 7 on the
Cardinal singles chart, again
proved the depth of the squad in
winning the singles invitational at
Ojai. Berris, 3-0 in singles in dual
matches, strung together a num
ber of wins over Pac-10 starters to
take the title.
"Ojai was great for me," she
said. "I beat a lot of players that
my teammates had beaten, and I

beat them handily, which gives my
team confidence in me in case I
have to step in."
"I think we're real deep," said
Brennan, who just recently cap
tured his fifth Pac-10 Coach of the
Year award. "I think that has just
come into focus in the last week or
two, with Beth getting to play sin
gles and succeeding so magnifi
cently. With that, we feel like
we're in good shape, because Beth
can beat a lot of people out there."
Berris would fill in at singles in
case of an injury at the NCAA
tournament, held May 18-21 in
Tallahassee, Fla.
Senior Wendy Sacks has been
filling that role for four years and
has done so in incredible fashion.
For the season, Sacks is 4-0 in sin
gles and 3-0 in doubles. For her ca
reer, she is 23-2, including a cru
cial stretch in the 1994 NCAA
tournament when she filled in for
an injured Berris at the No. 6 sin
gles spot.
"Wendy has been a four-year
scholarship player here and she
has an unbelievable record,"
Brennan said. "She has just been a
real solid player for us. When she
has been asked to start, she has
been great. She is just a real team
player. She is really dedicated to
the team concept."
Like Chiminello and Berris,
however, Sacks contributes more
to the team than just her on-the
court success.
"She may not have the label of
team captain, but she definitely
plays a captain's role," Berris
said. "She always brings up differ
ent things that Amv and I don't

think of. She may not have start
ed every match, but she's a close
watcher and she calls on people
when they haven't been working
hard. Not starting is hard, and I
think Wendy has handled it really
well."
Walk-on sophomores Heidi
Stalla and Sophy Woodhouse have
also been impressive in their op
portunities, specifically against
UCLA at No. 3 doubles two weeks
ago and again at Ojai in the invita
tional doubles tournament.
But then again, deep Stanford
women's tennis lineups are nei
ther unusual nor a coincidence.
"I think that by coming to
Stanford, you make a choice,"
Berris said. "I think if any of us
were coming just for tennis, we
would have gone to a different
school where we would have
played No. 1. I feel confident that
any of our players would all be
starting and playing really high on
most other teams. You definitely
know that coming to Stanford.
You know coming here that you
may be the star and that you also
may not be the star, because all
the stars come to Stanford."
A combined 54-4 at the No. 5
singles, No. 6 singles and No. 3
doubles positions for the season,
the bottom of the Cardinal lineup
is doing more than just pulling its
own weight.
"What's happening now is that
they are getting more confidence
in each other," Brennan said.
"Therefore, they are more confi
dent in the team and can relax a
little bit and play better tennis
themselves."
One of the single most impressive

ford women's tennis team is that its
No. 5 singles player captured the Pa

Stanford to its ninth straight Pac-10
title this season. That depth will no
doubt be crucial in the Cardinal's run
for an NCAA championship in two
weeks.
"We're deep," said Stanford head
coach Frank Brennan. "We don't lose
anything as move down the lineup.
Our No. 5 player just got a chance to
play with the big girls and she won
the whole thing. As far as depth goes,
1 think we're looking very good."
Indeed, the bottom of the Cardinal
lineup has been nothing short of in
vincible. In dual-match competition,
the Cardinal starters at No. 5 singles
(sophomore JulieScott), No. 6 singles
(senior Amy Chiminello) and No. 3
doubles (junior Emily Burt and se
nior Beth Berris) have compiled a 47-
2 record on the year.
Scott was quietly posting an im
pressive season, with a 19-1 dual
match record. The silence was broken
two weeks ago when she seized the
Pac-10 singles title in Ojai, Calif.
With that performance, Scott cata
pulted herself into the NCAA singles
draw and onto the All-Pac-10 Second
Team along with junior teammate
Sandra De Silva. Among Scott's vic
tims at Ojai was Arizona State's No. 1
player, lleka Cseresnyes, who was
named to the All-Pac-10 First Team.
"Julie is a tremendous talent,"
Brennan said. "I don't think anybody
at the No. 5 position plays with her
athletic ability, and she is playing
great. We keep telling her how good
she is and she's believing it, because
she really is."
Chiminello, right next to Scott on
the No. 6 court, refused to be outdone
by the sophomore throughout the

year, posting another tremendous
season in dual-match play at 20-1.
The senior has not lost in a dual
match since February and will finish
her illustrious career in fourth place
in the Stanford record books for most
dual-match victories (85).
"Amy is the perfect player for the
No. 6 spot," Brennan said. "She is so
disciplined and she fights so hard.
She has so much confidence."
Meanwhile, Burt and Berris have
yet to lose a match this year at the No.
3 doubles slot. They carried their un
defeated 7-0 record to Ojai and lost in
the semifinals to the No. 1
squad.
Berris, a senior, commented on the
history of Stanford dominance in the
bottom half of the lineup.
"Traditionally with Stanford, I
knew when I came here that Nos. 4, 5
and 6 just didn't lose," she said. "The

expectations are so high, and that has
just carried over to Amy and Julie.
They have just had a tremendous
record this year. Theyjust come in ex
pecting to win.
"There's not a thought in their
brain that they are going to lose and I
think the team has that confidence in
them. I always know Amy and Julie
are going to win. I feel that way with
Emily and I, too."
The bottom of Stanford's lineup
also brings an incredible amount of
experience to the squad, which can be
just as crucial to the Cardinal's suc
cess as the wins. Berris and
Chiminello, with eight years of colle
giate tennis between the two of them,
are the team's co-captains for the sec
ond straight season. Senior Kim
Shasby, the No. 4 singles competitor,
is also a fifth-year senior on a roster
that includes no freshmen.

"This is clearly the most experi
enced team we've ever had here,"
Brennan said. "It really helps a lot to
have players like that. They know you
and you know them. You don't have
to wonder how they are going to react
to things."
Berris echoed how important that
experience has been for her and the
other Cardinal veterans.
"I think that experience goes a
long way," she said. "We've all been
playing matches for so long — at the
top of the lineup, at the bottom, in all
different situations. And a lot of
times, freshmen will be playing at our
spots at other schools. I think it just
helps our team intimidating other
teams and helps us with our confi
dence.
"I mean, I've played matches for a

In a remarkable demonstration of the team's depth, Stanford tennis players (from left to right) Kim Shasby, Amy
Chiminello, Julie Scott, Emily Burt, Katie Schlukebir, Ania Bleszynski and Beth Berris show head coach Frank
Brennan (seated, left) and assistant Lele Forood that there is strength in numbers.
long time. I get nervous, but I
don't get the 'oh-my-gosh-people
are-watching-me* nerves."
And seeing a freshman across
the net from Amy Chiminello
doesn't hurt the Cardinal's
chances for victory.
"I just kind of laugh," Berris
said. "I mean, there's no way."
Much of the team's focus comes
from its co-captains, Chiminello
and Berris.
"Beth is sort of the mother fig
ure, while Amy does a lot more of
the butt-kicking," Brennan said.
"Every team has some grinding
going on, and Beth is the oil that
makes it all work smoothly."
The depth of the Cardinal line
up extends even further down the
lineup, beyond the starters. Non
starters have combined for a 23-2
record this season and have yet to
lose a singles match (11-0).
"It makes the starters not take
their positions for granted, which
is easy to do," Berris said. "When
they see that all of us are winning
our matches, it pushes them also."
Berris, who sits at No. 7 on the
Cardinal singles chart, again
proved the depth of the squad in
winning the singles invitational at
Ojai. Berris, 3-0 in singles in dual
matches, strung together a num
ber of wins over Pac-10 starters to
take the title.
"Ojai was great for me," she
said. "I beat a lot of players that
my teammates had beaten, and I

beat them handily, which gives my
team confidence in me in case I
have to step in."
"I think we're real deep," said
Brennan, who just recently cap
tured his fifth Pac-10 Coach of the
Year award. "I think that has just
come into focus in the last week or
two, with Beth getting to play sin
gles and succeeding so magnifi
cently. With that, we feel like
we're in good shape, because Beth
can beat a lot of people out there."
Berris would fill in at singles in
case of an injury at the NCAA
tournament, held May 18-21 in
Tallahassee, Fla.
Senior Wendy Sacks has been
filling that role for four years and
has done so in incredible fashion.
For the season, Sacks is 4-0 in sin
gles and 3-0 in doubles. For her ca
reer, she is 23-2, including a cru
cial stretch in the 1994 NCAA
tournament when she filled in for
an injured Berris at the No. 6 sin
gles spot.
"Wendy has been a four-year
scholarship player here and she
has an unbelievable record,"
Brennan said. "She has just been a
real solid player for us. When she
has been asked to start, she has
been great. She is just a real team
player. She is really dedicated to
the team concept."
Like Chiminello and Berris,
however, Sacks contributes more
to the team than just her on-the
court success.
"She may not have the label of
team captain, but she definitely
plays a captain's role," Berris
said. "She always brings up differ
ent things that Amv and I don't

think of. She may not have start
ed every match, but she's a close
watcher and she calls on people
when they haven't been working
hard. Not starting is hard, and I
think Wendy has handled it really
well."
Walk-on sophomores Heidi
Stalla and Sophy Woodhouse have
also been impressive in their op
portunities, specifically against
UCLA at No. 3 doubles two weeks
ago and again at Ojai in the invita
tional doubles tournament.
But then again, deep Stanford
women's tennis lineups are nei
ther unusual nor a coincidence.
"I think that by coming to
Stanford, you make a choice,"
Berris said. "I think if any of us
were coming just for tennis, we
would have gone to a different
school where we would have
played No. 1. I feel confident that
any of our players would all be
starting and playing really high on
most other teams. You definitely
know that coming to Stanford.
You know coming here that you
may be the star and that you also
may not be the star, because all
the stars come to Stanford."
A combined 54-4 at the No. 5
singles, No. 6 singles and No. 3
doubles positions for the season,
the bottom of the Cardinal lineup
is doing more than just pulling its
own weight.
"What's happening now is that
they are getting more confidence
in each other," Brennan said.
"Therefore, they are more confi
dent in the team and can relax a
little bit and play better tennis
themselves."
One of the single most impressive
facts about the second-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team is that its
No. 5 singles player captured the Pa
cific 10 Conference singles title. Even
more impressive might be that its No.
7 singles player, who doesn't compete
in dual-match singles play, took the
singles title at the Ojai Invitational
while playing against other teams'
No. 3 and No. 4 players.
While much attention is often
showered upon All-Americans Katie
Schlukebir and Ania Bleszysnki and
the top of the Cardinal lineup, it may
have been the team's depth that led
Stanford to its ninth straight Pac-10
title this season. That depth will no
doubt be crucial in the Cardinal's run
for an NCAA championship in two
weeks.
"We're deep," said Stanford head
coach Frank Brennan. "We don't lose
