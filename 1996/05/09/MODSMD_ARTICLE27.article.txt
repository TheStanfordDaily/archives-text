# The
						river runs deep for women's tennis
## Bleszynski, Schlukebir take spotlight, but bottom of the lineup is near-invincible 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
One of the single most impressive
facts about the second-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team is that its
No. 5 singles player captured the Pa
cific 10 Conference singles title. Even
more impressive might be that its No.
7 singles player, who doesn't compete
in dual-match singles play, took the
singles title at the Ojai Invitational
while playing against other teams'
No. 3 and No. 4 players.
While much attention is often
showered upon All-Americans Katie
Schlukebir and Ania Bleszysnki and
the top of the Cardinal lineup, it may
have been the team's depth that led
Stanford to its ninth straight Pac-10
title this season. That depth will no
doubt be crucial in the Cardinal's run
for an NCAA championship in two
weeks.
"We're deep," said Stanford head
coach Frank Brennan. "We don't lose
anything as move down the lineup.
Our No. 5 player just got a chance to
play with the big girls and she won
the whole thing. As far as depth goes,
1 think we're looking very good."
Indeed, the bottom of the Cardinal
lineup has been nothing short of in
vincible. In dual-match competition,
the Cardinal starters at No. 5 singles
(sophomore JulieScott), No. 6 singles
(senior Amy Chiminello) and No. 3
doubles (junior Emily Burt and se
nior Beth Berris) have compiled a 47-
2 record on the year.
Scott was quietly posting an im
pressive season, with a 19-1 dual
match record. The silence was broken
two weeks ago when she seized the
Pac-10 singles title in Ojai, Calif.
With that performance, Scott cata
pulted herself into the NCAA singles
draw and onto the All-Pac-10 Second
Team along with junior teammate
Sandra De Silva. Among Scott's vic
tims at Ojai was Arizona State's No. 1
player, lleka Cseresnyes, who was
named to the All-Pac-10 First Team.
"Julie is a tremendous talent,"
Brennan said. "I don't think anybody
at the No. 5 position plays with her
athletic ability, and she is playing
great. We keep telling her how good
she is and she's believing it, because
she really is."
Chiminello, right next to Scott on
the No. 6 court, refused to be outdone
by the sophomore throughout the

year, posting another tremendous
season in dual-match play at 20-1.
The senior has not lost in a dual
match since February and will finish
her illustrious career in fourth place
in the Stanford record books for most
dual-match victories (85).
"Amy is the perfect player for the
No. 6 spot," Brennan said. "She is so
disciplined and she fights so hard.
She has so much confidence."
Meanwhile, Burt and Berris have
yet to lose a match this year at the No.
3 doubles slot. They carried their un
defeated 7-0 record to Ojai and lost in
the semifinals to the No. 1
squad.
Berris, a senior, commented on the
history of Stanford dominance in the
bottom half of the lineup.
"Traditionally with Stanford, I
knew when I came here that Nos. 4, 5
and 6 just didn't lose," she said. "The

expectations are so high, and that has
just carried over to Amy and Julie.
They have just had a tremendous
record this year. Theyjust come in ex
pecting to win.
"There's not a thought in their
brain that they are going to lose and I
think the team has that confidence in
them. I always know Amy and Julie
are going to win. I feel that way with
Emily and I, too."
The bottom of Stanford's lineup
also brings an incredible amount of
experience to the squad, which can be
just as crucial to the Cardinal's suc
cess as the wins. Berris and
Chiminello, with eight years of colle
giate tennis between the two of them,
are the team's co-captains for the sec
ond straight season. Senior Kim
Shasby, the No. 4 singles competitor,
is also a fifth-year senior on a roster
that includes no freshmen.

"This is clearly the most experi
enced team we've ever had here,"
Brennan said. "It really helps a lot to
have players like that. They know you
and you know them. You don't have
to wonder how they are going to react
to things."
Berris echoed how important that
experience has been for her and the
other Cardinal veterans.
"I think that experience goes a
long way," she said. "We've all been
playing matches for so long — at the
top of the lineup, at the bottom, in all
different situations. And a lot of
times, freshmen will be playing at our
spots at other schools. I think it just
helps our team intimidating other
teams and helps us with our confi
dence.
"I mean, I've played matches for a
