# Softball finishes season with a bang
## Cardinal splits two with Cal, earning first win ever over Golden Bears 
### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The Stanford softball team
closed its 1996 season yesterday by
doing something it had not been
able to do in 30 previous attempts —
beat Cal. With its best performance
of the year, the Cardinal — which
finishes the year with a 24-27 over
all record, 7-17 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference — split with the No. 11
Golden Bears to send lone senior
Lynn Anderson out in winning fash
ion.
Stanford won the first game, 7-2,
to end a nine-game losing streak,
but fell short in the nightcap, 3-0.
The Cardinal fell behind early in
the first game, as the Bears jumped
out to a one-run lead in the first in
ning. Cal's Megumi Takasaki ad
vanced to third on a wild pitch after
leading off the game with a double.
She then scored from third on an
RBI single by Jenny Ackley.
Stanford would not stay down for
long, though. In the bottom of the
second, freshman Kelly Yablonski
stepped up to the plate and drilled
the Cardinal's second home run of
the season. Yablonski's blast was a
solo shot to tie the game, but it was
just the start of the freshman's
heroics.
"I wasn't expecting to do it — it
just happened," Yablonski said. "It
was the first pitch, and I got a good
swing. The rest of (my at-bats], I
was thinking, 'I have to follow this
up.'"
Following up the home run was
no trouble for Yablonski. She fin
ished the game by going a perfect 3-
for-3, tallying four RBIs, a single
and a double to go with the home
run. Yablonski's shot at the cycle
was precluded by the fact that she
never received her fourth at-bat,
leaving fans to wonder what might
have happened.
The single came in the fourth in
ning with two runners on base.
Freshman Michelle Schneider, who
singled to reach base, scored on
Yablonski's hit to give the Cardinal
its first lead of the day at 2-1.
From that point on, Stanford
never looked back. Yablonski's final
two RBIs came in the fifth, when she
doubled to score Schneider and ju

nior Summer Lee, who had each
drawn walks to reach base. Stanford
added three more runs in the sixth
on four Cardinal hits.
Freshman Jennie Foylegot Stan
ford rolling with a leadoff single, and
junior Amanda Renteria followed
Foyle with a single of her own to put
runners on first and second with no
outs. Freshman Marcy Crouch then
kept pace with her teammates by
singling to score Foyle, and Schnei
der added two more Cardinal runs
with a single of her own.
Cal bounced back in the top of the
seventh to make the game exciting.
Takasaki scored a teammate from
second base with a single, and two
more singles loaded the bases for Cal
with two outs. Ackley looked to give

the Bears at least two more runs, if
not three, with a hard-hit line drive,
but Renteria leaped into the air
from her position at third base to
steal the hit and end the game.
"It was awesome beating Cal,"
Anderson said. "It's the first time in
Stanford's history, so it's a good way
to go out. It also shows a little of the
team's future. They have so much
talent — it's just a matter of putting
it together. It's all about team
work."
Anderson was honored between
games for her performance and ded
ication to the softball team during
her three-year career at Stanford.
Since transferring to the school as a
sophomore, Anderson has served as
catcher and captain for the Cardinal

and has helped build Stanford's
softball program, which is in just its
fourth year of existence.
Stanford never got its engines
started in the second game, as the
Cardinal only managed four hits
while committing three errors. Cal
grabbed a 1-0 lead in the fifth off
two Stanford throwing errors and a
Valerie Nicklas single. The score
stayed at 1-0 until the final inning,
when Cal got its remaining two
runs on two walks, one hit and one
more Cardinal error for a final
score of 3-0.
"Throughout the season we've
seen glimpses of our [potential],"
Anderson said. "The first game with
Cal was a glimpse of what's to
come."
