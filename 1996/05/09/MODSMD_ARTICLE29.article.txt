Stanford men's and women's
crew teams will be battling it out
against California in the annual
Big Row.
The Cardinal men will race
California for the 50th time in
the modern era and fight for
the right to take home the Jim
Reynolds Cup. The first-ever
dual meet between these rivals
occurred in 1904, with Stan
ford's first victory coming
three years later in 1907.

crew program in 1920, only to

bring it back in 1946.

the last five. But the Cardinal is
hoping that Saturday's race at
Redwood Shores will bring dif
ferent results.
"I think things look pretty
good," said junior Mark Thomas.

the last two weeks. We're going

speedy Cal crew. But adjust
ments throughout the season
and a focus on aggressiveness
