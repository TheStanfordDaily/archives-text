# More than pride on the line at Big Row
## 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
While most people are in bed
catching their Saturday morn
ing zzzz's this weekend, the
Stanford men's and women's
crew teams will be battling it out
against California in the annual
Big Row.
The Cardinal men will race
California for the 50th time in
the modern era and fight for
the right to take home the Jim
Reynolds Cup. The first-ever
dual meet between these rivals
occurred in 1904, with Stan
ford's first victory coming
three years later in 1907.
Stanford then stopped the
crew program in 1920, only to

bring it back in 1946.
Since then, the Golden Bears
have dominated the competition,
winning 37 of 49 races, including
the last five. But the Cardinal is
hoping that Saturday's race at
Redwood Shores will bring dif
ferent results.
"I think things look pretty
good," said junior Mark Thomas.
"We've picked up a lot of speed in
the last two weeks. We're going
to give Cal a run for its money."
At the San Diego regatta ear
lier this season, Stanford found
itself seven seconds behind the
speedy Cal crew. But adjust
ments throughout the season
and a focus on aggressiveness
have narrowed the gap between
the two squads. Indeed, Stanford
has competed closely with the
Bears in scrimmages, giving the
team confidence for Saturday's
race.
"We have made a lot of improve
ments since San Diego," said head
coach Weislaw Kujda. "We can row

with anybody."
Beating California could also
potentially affect the seedings for
the Pacific 10 Championships,
which are set to t;ike place May 25.
If Stanford defeats the second
seeded Bears, the Cardinal could
improve from its fourth spot to a
third or even a second seed. Re
gardless of the pairings, though, a
victory on Saturday will give the
Stanford crew a moral and mental
boost.
"Winning will be a huge confi

dence booster, because Cal is one of
the fastest crews in the country,"
said junior Matt Miller.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal
women will attempt to hold on to
the Lambert Cup, which spent
most of its time at California dur
ing the past decade before Stan
ford won it back last season. The
Stanford squad has good reason to
believe the Cup will stay in Palo
Alto at least one more year.
"We should be faster," said
women's head coach Amee Baker.

"But we don't want to take this
race lightly. Funny things tend to
happen in Big Row."
Something very strange would
have to occur for the Cardinal to
fall to Cal. Although the two
schools have not met this season,
Stanford has beaten several
schools which have defeated Cal,
and has recorded significantly
faster times than the Bears.
Saturday, the Cardinal women
will try to implement a new start
technique and will attempt to re

fine their performance for the Pa
cific 10 Championships, set to take
place on the same course. Defeat
ing California will assure Stanford
of a second seed and help the squad
in its bid to qualify for nationals.
"We've had a good season thus
far," said senior Audra Pligavko.
"But we want to make sure we
have our race plan down for Pac
-10s."
Saturday's race will have
greater significance for the Stan
ford women's novice team, which

will attempt to steal California's
second seed. The junior varsity has
specifically tapered its workouts in
order to be fresh for the Golden
Bears.
While the Stanford men's and
women's crew teams are looking
forward to the postseason, bring
ing home the Jim Reynolds and
Lambert Cups remains foremost
on their minds.
"It's important to have a good
race," said women's coxswain Nancy
Bergstinsson. "We want to win."
