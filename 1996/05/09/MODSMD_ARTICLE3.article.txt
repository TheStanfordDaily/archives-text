# Stolen Macy's jeans found in truck, suspect out on bail

So that's why Calvin Klein models never seem to
wear anything, let alone jeans.
Stanford Police discovered 117 pairs of Calvin Klein
jeans late Monday in the backseat and trunk of a 1986
Plymouth. Police suspect the jeans were stolen from
the Macy's at Stanford Shopping Center and that the
theft was part of a shoplifting ring.
Police pulled over Daniel Perez Rodriguez, 27, on
Arboretum Road for driving with faulty brake lights.
After running a license check on Rodriguez and finding
that he did not have one, police prepared to have the car
towed and the suspect taken to jail, according to Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"The officer called a tow truck and was having the
car inventoried," N iemeyer said. "He saw lots of Calvin
Klein jeans in the backseat. Subsequently, he discov
ered more in the trunk."
When the suspect was first stopped, tinted windows
prevented police officers from seeing the jeans and the

aluminum foil shopping bag lined with duct tape that
police suspect was used during the alleged shoplifting,
Niemeyer said.
A fingerprint matching done on Rodriguez turned
up no information, leading police to suspect he might
not be a U.S. citizen, Niemeyer said.
"We're not sure that this is his correct name,"
Niemeyer explained. "We checked his name and all
variations on it, and it came back that he had no li
cense. Under California law, driving with no license
means that you can be arrested and have your car im
pounded."
.Rodriguez is currently out on bail, according to
Niemeyer, but initially he was held without bail.
Niemeyer added that when the case went to trial,
bond was set at $5,000. Rodriguez was bailed out, and
Niemeyer added that he hopes the suspect does not
leave the country before his arraignment next week.
The jeans, according to Mike Keenan, vice president
and director of security for Macy's West, had Macy's
tags on them. Whether they came
from the Stanford Mall store or a
number of Macy's store in the area
remains unclear.
Keenan said there is no way to
tell by looking at the tags which
Macy's the jeans are from.
"So far nothing has been report
ed to indicate that 117 pairs of
jeans were taken from one store,"
Keenan said. "It's possible that
they broke into a stock room or

they took selectively from different
stores. There are a lot of Macy's
clustered together in this area and
it's conceivable they went to a
bunch of different stores."
Because the jeans were not
found in Macy's and the arrest oc
curred elsewhere, Keenan said the
investigation is being conducted
entirely by the police.
So far, Niemeyer said, several
factors have led police to suspect
that a whole group was behind the
theft.
"There was a female in the vehi
cle prior to the arrest," Niemeyer
said. "We had nothing to hold her

on so she left before the arrest was
made."
Niemeyer also added that a sales
associate from Macy's later said
she had noticed "a group of His
panic people trying on lots of jeans
and shuffling them around."
Though no official report of sus
picious activity was made to securi
ty officials at Macy's, Keenan said,
it is possible that police obtained
information from individual sales
associates that did not get reported
within Macy's own system.
"For retailers, it's shoplifting
gangs that do the most damage,"
Keenan said. "They are difficult to

detect and they use lots of tech
niques. Calvin Klein jeans are very
marketable. Anything that is popu
lar gets stolen."
The foil-lined bags are nothing
new to retailers, Keenan said.
These bags have been around for
about 10 years but now are becom
ing outdated as many stores have
electronic security systems that
can detect stolen goods even
through them.
"True professionals don't use
them because they are tools to bur
glary and if they get caught with
the bags, that in and of itself is ille
gal," Keenan said.
