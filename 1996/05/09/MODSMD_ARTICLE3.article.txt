So that's why Calvin Klein models never seem to
wear anything, let alone jeans.
Stanford Police discovered 117 pairs of Calvin Klein
jeans late Monday in the backseat and trunk of a 1986
Plymouth. Police suspect the jeans were stolen from
the Macy's at Stanford Shopping Center and that the
theft was part of a shoplifting ring.
Police pulled over Daniel Perez Rodriguez, 27, on
Arboretum Road for driving with faulty brake lights.
After running a license check on Rodriguez and finding
that he did not have one, police prepared to have the car
towed and the suspect taken to jail, according to Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"The officer called a tow truck and was having the
car inventoried," N iemeyer said. "He saw lots of Calvin
Klein jeans in the backseat. Subsequently, he discov
ered more in the trunk."
When the suspect was first stopped, tinted windows
prevented police officers from seeing the jeans and the

aluminum foil shopping bag lined with duct tape that
police suspect was used during the alleged shoplifting,
Niemeyer said.
A fingerprint matching done on Rodriguez turned
up no information, leading police to suspect he might
not be a U.S. citizen, Niemeyer said.
"We're not sure that this is his correct name,"
Niemeyer explained. "We checked his name and all
variations on it, and it came back that he had no li
cense. Under California law, driving with no license
means that you can be arrested and have your car im
pounded."
.Rodriguez is currently out on bail, according to
Niemeyer, but initially he was held without bail.
Niemeyer added that when the case went to trial,
bond was set at $5,000. Rodriguez was bailed out, and
Niemeyer added that he hopes the suspect does not
leave the country before his arraignment next week.

and director of security for Macy's West, had Macy's
