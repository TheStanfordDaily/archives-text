It took nearly two months, but
the search for a women's soccer
coach is finally over.
Yesterday morning, Athletic
Director Ted Leland announced
that Steve Swanson, the head
women's soccer coach at Dart
mouth College for the past seven
seasons, had been named to the
same post at Stanford. Leland was
sent searching lor a new head
coach when lan Sawyers an
nounced his resignation on March
15.
"We're really excited," said
freshman Erin Bryla, the team's
starting goalkeeper. "We've heard
great things about Steve and we
can't wait to get to work with
him."
Swanson was 55-35-7 in his
seven seasons at Dartmouth, good
for a .603 winning percentage. He
led the Big Green to its first-ever
Ivy League titles in 1991 and 1993
and its first-ever NCAA tourna
ment bids in 1993 and 1994. Dart
mouth cracked the top 20 in 1993,

1994 and 1995 under Swanson's
guidance, and finished the 1993
and 1994 seasons ranked 14th in
the country.
"Steve is both a wonderful
coach and a wonderful person,
and I feel, in him, Stanford has got
one of the best coaches in the
country," said Stanford Director
of Soccer and men's head coach
Bobby Clark, who himself was
hired just one month ago.
While at Dartmouth, Swanson
worked alongside Clark, who was
the men's coach there from 1985-
94.
"From a personal perspective, it
is great for me to team up with Steve
once again," Clark said. "We en
joyed a wonderful relationship dur
ing our time together at Dartmouth
and we aim to re-capture that spe
cial spirit which bonded our men's
and women's soccer programs."
Swanson was hired at Dart
mouth after playing professional
ly for four years in the Canadian
National Soccer League and the
National Professional Soccei
League. His first day at Stanford
will be June 1.
