# flamboyance and drama:
## Jazz Great Bellson to jam with Stanford Jazz Orchestra 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh 
Pick a night. Any night,
linding great jazz is never
a task here in the Bay
Area's rich hotbed ot home
grown talent. A hig hand gig, on
the other hand, is much harder
to find .. .unless you're looking
right here on campus, where
the Stanford Jazz Orchestra
keeps the swanky sounds of the
'3()s and (i()s swing era fresh in
everyone's ears.
Next Tuesday, the Jazz Or
chestra will he joined hya living
legend of the decades who
made the hig band sound what
is was and what it has become
today as musicians strive to
keep the roots of modern jazz
music alive.
Famed drummer/ compos
er/arranger I.ouie Bellson
who has jammed with jazz
greats Benny Goodman,
lummy Horsey, Harry James,
1 Juke 1 llington, l .lla Fitzgerald,
Louie Armstrong, Buddy De
Franco, Oscar Peterson and

Lester Young — will grace the
stage .is guest of honor tor the Jazz Orchestra's
spring quarter feature artist concert.
Though famous for a long list ot his lasting
contributions to ja//, Bellson is most la
mous for the technical brilliance and en
ergetic dynamism of his drumming. Back in
the '50s when he was making a name tor him
self in Duke Ellington's orchestra, Bellson
added .1 feature to his drum kit that has since
become the trademark of his sound and style:
the double bass.
The extra bass adds flavors of "flamboyance
and drama" to the drums, as Stanford ja// his
tory professor, (Irover Sales describes.
Bellson's innovation, in effect, nudged the
drums into a bigger share ot the spotlight of big
band sound. The volume and texture of the
double bass stretch the spectrum of rhythmic
colors drums can contribute to the music.
These days, the use of two bass drums is
more typical of heavy metal music than jazz.
Since the double bass sometimes sounds over
powering in small combos (which, in the past
few decades, have become more common than

big bands) most jazz drummers stick to the
standard four-piece set with a single bass and
snare, tom-toms and ride, crash and hi-hat
cymbals.
The strong pulse and drive of Bellson's
drumming has earned him high acclaim lor
both his dexterous soloing and his strong pres
ence in the rhythm section. His high-energy
solos show off the flashy end of the firmly root
ed rhtyhmic backdrop he sets in any tune he
plays.
"I am amazed at his fluidity around the
drum kit, said Stanford graduate student
Mike Uchic, who has been drumming for the
Jazz Orchestra for the past four years. "He real
ly gets in there and drives the band. And when
he solos, he builds everything to a climax, al
ways bringing out something new, and always
bringing the crowd into whatever he's playing
Uchic and Bellson will trade sets and solos
in the concert's final number, "Take the 'A'
Train," one of Islington's most famous swing
tunes. Several other charts in the concert line
up are either written or arranged by Bellson,
including "Hawk lalks, "The l.ouie Shuttle,

"Soar 1 ike an
Kagle" and per
haps his most
famous, "Skin
I )eep."
Oth e r
Louie tunes are
tributes to ta
mo us musi
cians like Char
lie Parker, San
doval Arturo
and John San
tos. Rellson's
technical flair
shows itsell off
in composi
tions like "San
tos," an up-

tempo number with lots of Latin rhtythmsthat
demand lots of technical skill and energy.
Another Bellson original on the line-up ii
"bastside Story" — a three-part spin-off ot
Leonard Bernstein's Broadway classic "West
Side Story" — which Bellson co-wrote with
Tommy Newsom, most well known for direct
ing the "Johnny Carson Show" orchestra in the
'60s and '70s.
The rest of the concert repertoire swings
and shuffles to sounds typical of the Ellington
era when orchestras began playing more con
certs and less dance hall shows. As jazz Orches
tra trombone veteran Craig Dunwoody de
scribes, "the music has more variations in
tempo and a more complex interplay of tonal
colors."
J here's a special kind of magic when
you get a large group of people
I swinging together," 1 red Berry, the
director of Stanford's Jazz Orchestra said
through a smile. "It's all human energy, and
when it's right, there's absolutely no feeling like it."
In the past four years under Berry's direc
tion, and thanks to several players who have
been around just as long, the lazz Orchestra
has grown into a swing that at times makes 17
instruments sound like one. "This band has
had more magical moments than many in the
past,'' Berry said. When they play their highly
attended gigs at the c offee I louse, their conta
gious swing often draws listeners out of thier
chairs dancing.
Many of the band members give a fat
share ol credit to Berry, who they say has
been an inspiring source of their evolved tal
ent and karma. "Our skill and level of musi
cianship have really developed over the
years," says Michael Clarke, another alto sax
ophonist. "We owe a lot of that to Fred. He
knows his music inside and out. It's uncon
scious. What we try to do is absorb all the
stylistic things he has to teach us."

Freshman Christina labor,
one of the la// Orchestra s
trumpets, said that Berry's
dual focus on improving
technique and developing
personal styles provides
constant, motivating dial
lenges. "Fred makes us focus
on particulars," labor says,
"and reminds us that the
music is an acquired thing,
you have to get a feel for.
He's made the band a real
musical environment, not
just a bunch of people play
ing together.'
Chad 1 lollingsworth,an alto
saxophonist, says Berry keeps
the band well versed in tradi
tion, always highlighting the
importance ot understanding
the heritage and historical
context of the music they play.
"He's a really hip guy," says
Hollingsworth, "and deeph

connected with the tradition of big hand. He
really knows the style ol the music.'
Berry, a trumpet player and concert con
tractor who has been a fixture in the Bay Area
jazz world since the '60s, has arranged shows
for headliners like McCoy Tyner, Joe Mender
son, Johnny Mathus, Sarah Vaughan, I inda
Ronstadt and Stevie Wonder.
Although Berry demands a lot of skill from
his players, they say he balances his detail-ori
ented directing approach by encouraging
spontaneity as well, since, as many jazz gurus
profess, skill is nothing without spontaneiu
"With Fred," Clarke said, "a tune can change
character on the spot, right there while we're
playing it."
In addition to his guest appearance at lues
day's concert, Bellson will offer a special jazz
clinic open to all Stanford students Mondav,
the day before the May 14 concert.
As part of the Jazz Orchestra's continued ef
fort to expose students to the masters ol the
jazz world past and present, the clinic will focus
on big band music, composing, and other bits
of Bellson's wealth of experiences in jazz. Band
members herald the clinic as a great opportu
nity to learn from "a legend who's happy to
share all the experiences he's garnished.
