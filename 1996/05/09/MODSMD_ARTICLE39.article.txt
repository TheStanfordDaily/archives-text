How would a play look if the theaters hi
erarchical paradigm was debunked?
Kind of like the Women's Performance
Collective's Spring show, "Presents and
Promises: A Performance Exploring Vio
lence in Relationships," where traditional
notions of director-barks-commands-at
actor are thrown away with the hath water to
pave a road for a collaborative effort.
"We really try to work together," says se
nior Sara DeWitt, who revived the Collective
this year.
"Each person has infused a little bit of her
self," agrees Treasurer Nami Kim, also a se
nior.
This infusion has created a multitude of
scenes, all surrounding the issue of domestic

violence. "There's poetry, movement, song,
prose, monologues, scenes," explains senior
actress Lori Elder.
While the scenes have no common narra
tive thread per se, the performance follows "a
cycle which mimics the cycle of abuse" ac
cording to DeWitt.
Education about the issue of domestic vi
olence was an integral part of production.
"For the first half of the year our meetings in
volved discussions, brainstorming, sharing
personal ideas," says Kim. "We had speakers
come in from the shelter and survivors of do
mestic violence to give us commentary."
The notion of collaboration is part of the
tradition of the Collective. "A collective is re
ally rare, you relinquish complete artistic

control," says Elder.
PeWitt speaks of the benefits of this expe
rience. "It's really a shared vision. There's a
sense of collective ownership."
The collective ideal has pervaded since the
performance collective was started in 1992.
DeWitt describes the first productions, orga
nized by Sonia Kuftinec, a graduate student
in the Department of Drama. "She wanted to
do a performance discussing rape on cam
pus. The actors who were interested were all
women."
As rehearsals progressed, the actors found
that "they really liked the feel of it. It was a re
ally good confidential space to discuss their
ideas." As popular as the shows were in their
first two seasons, the Collective fell by the

I wayside last year.
I Collective alumnae DeWitt and Ajna
Pisani met last year at the Stanford Program
in Oxford and vowed to continue the tradi
tion.
"We got a female network set up and just
started talking to people," DeWitt explains.
P Funding came from the ASSU Program
Board and emotional support arrived in the
form of Stanford graduate Ariane Marie, a
Collective alumna and a member of the Net
work for Battered Women.
A show dealing with the issues surround
ing domestic violence was thus horn.
Though the Collective members work
from a script, emphasis is placed on both
spontaneity and process. Actress l.ori Elder
claims that the (Collective (ills ",i void on cam
pus. It is a place where women can express
;; ourselves."
Eager to dispel images of "male-bashing,
artsy-fartsy" sessions, Treasurer and Secre
tary Nami Kim says"it has evolved into
ij women and men exploring gender issues in
| general."
The men in the Collective have an integral
impact on the performance. Jim Hammel, a
i cotcrminal student and one ol three men in
the show, got involved with the Collective be
cause it seemed "like a nice way to have an
impact on a very important issue."
The small number of males in the show
has been "difficult" for I lammel, since he is
forced to "tackle some roles which are not
particularly pleasant, but they're important
to convey the issues that we're dealing with."
Hammel praises the original writers for
being "very cautious about not making this
stereotypical in any way. They have been
constantly seeking our input for whether or
not what we're doing is very superficial."
"An important part of the show," stresses
Kim "is that we want to show that there is a
diversity and a multiplicity of experiences.
Not all cases of domestic violence are the
same." She points to sexual orientation, eth
nicity and culture as important factors that
influence patterns of abuse.
DeWitt also says the Collective is trying to
"push through stereotypes. It's not a show to
show people what they already know. It's
supposed to be a little different, and in some
ways, a little jarring."
"We've all realized we know a lot more
people who've been in abusive relationships
than we think."
Proceeds from the production benefit the
Network for Battered Women.
