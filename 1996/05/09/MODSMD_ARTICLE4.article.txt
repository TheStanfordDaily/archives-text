# A 						loan again, naturally
## As scholarships shrivel, student borrowing rises

Grant and scholarship monies are account
ing for a smaller portion of student financial
aid than ever before, according to a recent re
port.
The California Student Aid Commission
reported that loans now account for 59 per
cent of student financial aid packages among
California students, an increase from 47 per
cent in 1990.
The dollar amount borrowed by students
has more than doubled in the past five years,
from $1.2 billion in 1990 to $2.7 billion in
1995.

"Never before have California students
been mortgaged so heavily to pay the costs of
their California college education," Commis
sion Executive Director Jon Shaver said in a
statement.
The number of grants and scholarships
has not declined, said Dana Callihan, the
deputy director of public and governmental
relations for the commission. At the same
time, however, agencies offering grants and
scholarships have not grown as much as loan
programs.
Shaver attributed the increase in borrow-
ing to California's recent recession,
the rising costs of college tuition
and changes that have made loan
funding more accessible.
"Students are borrowing more
because they can borrow more,"
Stanford Asst. Director of Financial
Aid Cynthia Rife said. Money "was
not available fouryears ago, but it is
available now."
Callihan explained that the 1992
Congressional re-authorization of
the Higher Education Act made sig
nificant changes to the structure of
regulations for student borrowing.
"Congress has authorized more
students to borrow, regardless of
income," he said.
According to Callihan, a large
proportion of the money given fed
erally for student loans is allotted to
private schools like Stanford.
"Of a $2.7 billion figure, pri
vates receive at least $700 million

a year," he said.
Another element contributing to
the increase in the amount of
money borrowed is the needs of
graduate students, who take out
more loans than undergraduates,
Callihan said.

borrowing more

borrow more.'

Graduate students studying at
Stanford generally are not eligible
for scholarships and grants from
the University that do not need to
be paid back.
"We don't have a policy of meet
ing need for graduate students,"
Rife said. As a result, she said, grad
uate students often attempt to bor
row enough to cover the entire cost

of their education.
Rife said the Financial Aids Of
fice has representatives that tackle
the issue of increased student bor
rowing by calling for the develop
ment of alternatives to a loan pro
gram.
"Our government relations peo
ple advocate at the state and nation
al level to make legislatures aware
of the implications of large loans,"
she said.
More money for grants and
scholarships must be made avail
able, Shaver said in the statement.
"The key solution," he said, "is
to increase grants and scholarships
to try and stunt the growth in re
liance on borrowing."
Callihan said the Pell Grant pro
gram, which is a federal program
geared toward lower-income stu
dents, gives $600 million per year,
and the statewide Cal Grant pro
gram gives $250 million per year,
but the funding is still not enough.
"We need to look at investing
more in grant programs," he said.
