Sigourney Weaver did it in the '70s. Gale
Ann Hurd, the producer behind "Ter
minator," did it in the '80s. And a num
ber of other Stanford graduates are trying to
do it in the '90s: namely, break into the enter
tainment industry. And even though the
common feeling is that it's a closed business,
some recent alumni experiencing the big "I I"
hint otherwise.
"Everyone in Hollywood is looking for the
next talent, the next piece of material and
that is a continuous pursuit. Therefore there
are constant opportunities to break into the
business," said Andrew Shakman, Class of
'93. A drama major, Shakman went on to
USC 112 ilm School and is now President ofCy
berSight, a Los Angeles "new media" compa
ny.
Shakman and other Stanford alumni
working in Hollywood will talk about their
experiences at a panel May 11 at the Eleanor
Prosser Studio from 10 a.m. to I p.m. Each
member of the panel will discuss a different
route on the way to breaking in. These in
clude film school (Shakman), acting, devel
opment and talent agency. Jon Sherman, who
went from the mailroom at M TV to creating
the series "Dead at 21," will talk about writ
ing.
"These are people who've graduated in the
past two to five years and are still at the point
where they can remember what it was like to
break into the industry and what the path

was like," Shakman said.
The overarching goal of this panel, ac
cording to Shakman, is to help aspiring Pfeif
fers and Spielbergs to develop a clear strategy
for how to progress in the industry. Unlike
fields such as medicine or law, there is no one
way to get employed in the entertainment in
dustry.
"It's all a big game, and you just need to
learn how to play and how all the pieces fit to
gether," said Shakman, who hopes that the
workshop will "take a little bit ol the sheen
and mystery off the business."
As a member of Stanford Alumni in En
tertainment, Shakman routinely networks
with Stanford graduates, and he says a com
mon line of dialogue he hears is that 1..A. is a
"mean town," and a "difficult place to live and
work." But he thinks that may be a cliche.
"It's very easy to come to 1..A. and feel it's
an impenetrable fortress," said Shakman.
"It's a skeptical business." Hut according to
him, a deeper look into the town reveals that
the business is not so closed and that the peo
ple in it may be more approachable than
most people think.
Shakman recalls one day in a film class
when a "very high-profile" executive came in
and told the class that "he was not that busy"
and would probably return a call.
"You need to be persistent in this town and
phone people up. With the right amount of
aggressive behavior, you can have conversa

tions with people you think wouldn't take
your calls and create opportunities for your
self," said Shakman.
Shakman emphasizes "strategy" in break
ing in. One of the goals of the seminar is to
show students the courses that are immedi
ately available to them in Hollywood. Not
only are the more "glamorous" career paths
discussed, such as acting and writing, but
also other entertainment-related routes, such
as heading the literary department at William
Morris.
"One tends to think of going to L.A. or
N.Y as a 'hit or miss' experience, saying,
'Mavbc I'll get a part, lightning will strike and
I'll be the next phenomenon,'" said Ron
Davies, Drama Department administrator.
"But statistically, it's not likely that Stanford
students will have that experience."
Davies draws an analogy between the en
tertainment industry and the Drama Depart
ment. There is a limited number of roles to
cast in plays, and plays can't go on without
people working on sets, lighting, costumes,
and doing stage managing, publicity and
backstage work. Davies hopes that the semi
nar will impress that variety of opportunities
upon people who normally associate the en
tertainment industry with acting.
"There are ways to get involved in the in
dustry that don't involve being a performer,"
Davies said. "It is nice to see people who do
not succeed as performers to segue way into

other areas and find them fulfilling."
Nevertheless, Davies points out that there
are a number of graduates who do go on to
acting careers, such as Andre Braugher
("Glory," "Homicide") and John Livingstone
("Mr. Wrong," "The Net"). Whether going to
Stanford had anything to do with their sue
cess is debatable.
"Does Stanford open doors? 1 think it's an
impressive, well-respected name," Shakman
said. "Does it get you employed? Probabh
not."
The only advantage that Stanford students
may have is that, according to Davies, tlie\
are usually "bright and well-rounded, and
have an entrepreneurial perspective."
"They know how to identify opportunities
and follow up on them," Davies said. 1 hey
have a wider perspective, and that's why
when people go to L.A., they are successful.
It's because of that flexibility."
