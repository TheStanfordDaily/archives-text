## Psycho Pinball for PC CD-ROM 
### Lewis Lin 
The PC gaming
world seems to be
dominated by violent
games. You've got
your "Marathon 2"
and its close cousins,
"Doom" and "Doom
2." And then you've
got your fantasy
based "Warcraft 2"
and the (il Joe setting
ot "( ommand and

(Conquer." Hut if you're a little tired of the blood
and gore of these games (as well as the I ast
FloMo "Marathon" freaks who take over the
computer cluster on I rida\ nights), then the
mild, yet engaging "Psycho Pinball' ma\ be
perfect for you.
ThisC i rated game embodies .ill the paya
bility of your traditional pinball machines
.. . and more. The game can accommodate
up to four players, and there are six different
controls for the game, first, you have your
typical left flipper, right flipper and launch
ball controls. Then, to mimic conventional
pinball machines, you can "tilt" the table
right, left or forward, in hopes of getting the

ball out of the gutter or into a special bonus
hole.
Included in the program are four tables
with different themes: Psycho, Trick or Treat,
I he Abyss and Wild West. Sporting a wacky,
colorful carnival theme, Psycho is "the multi
table, gateway." Shooting the ball into differ
ent side-show tents will lead you to either the
Wild West, Trick or Treat or The Abyss tables.
You will stay at a given table as long as you
keep your ball in plav.
Wild West, as one would imagine, is based
on .i Western cowboy theme. Hlow up the jail
to get multi-ball action. Spell out the letters
CiOl.D to get a huge bonus. Meanwhile,
Irick or Treat has a spook theme. Heware of
the Pit of Doom and the Spook I anes. On
I he Abyss, you are whisked away to a water
wonderland. In this undersea table, vou can
hit the Nautilus Segments to activate the
( .'reature of the Deep or activate the Vortex
to find the sunken treasure. The beauty of
this table is that there are two sets of flippers,
one tor the upper half and the other for the
lower half of the table. With two different
playing fields packed into one, it really dou
bles the fun.
The game play and table layouts are excit
ing and fun. The graphics are superior, as

each table is intricately drawn. The scrolling
is extremely smooth, and the game adapts
well to different machine speeds. But don't
believe their boast of "full motion video se
quences. I hose video sequences, which have
you walking through the tables in a first-per
son perspective, appear only in the introduc
tion of the game.
1 he software package boasts "over 175 au
thentic pinball sound and voice effects plus
120 rocking audio tracks." Unfortunately, 1
was unable to listen to even one "rocking"
audio track, .is I was unable to get the sound to
work properly. Ironically, the software manu
al warns,"... we would like to stress that to got
the full effect of the game, a sound card is
strongly recommended." I tested the game on
two different machines, first on a 486-75 Ml 1/
computer with a Soundhlaster Pro compatible
card and then on a Pentium 133 MHz com
puter with an authentic Soundhlaster 32 card,
lb my vexation, the sound failed to work on
either machine. In the end, I think 1 spent
moretimetryingdifferent sound settings than
I did playing the game.
Unlike most recent games, which almost
beg for you to have a Pentium processor, 16
MB RAM and 20 MB of hard drive space,
"Psycho Pinball" has a modest requirement

of a 386 DX processor, 4 MB ram, DOS 5.0, 1
MB hard drive space, VGA graphics, Sound
blaster-compatible sound card and CD
ROM.
Also included in the game are 15 MB
worth of wallpaper and .wav files from the
game. The 256 color wallpapers are zany, col
orful and delightful screen shots from the
game; but to my dismay, the .wav files were
simply an assortment of different blips and
bleeps.
With the exception of the sound problem,
"Psycho Pinball" is a solid game. Sound is a
large part of a "multimedia" game, and not
being able to get the sound to work was a real
downer. But the fluid motion, detailed tables
and colorful graphics was pretty good in
making up for its aural deficiencies. Master
ing Psycho Pinball undoubtedly takes some
patience and good hand / eye coordination.
The action comes fast and slick. A friend of
mine was so frustrated with the game that he
was about to apply the literal meaning of the
Psycho Pinball's motto — "PCs will tilt!" —
to his PC. But that's probably the beauty of
the game, or pinball games in general. They
are so mindless and easy that you'd probably
bash your head into wall if you don't rack up
a zillion points.
