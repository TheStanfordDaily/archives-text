Ram's I lead will not he putting on a spring musi
cal this year. Rams 1 lead hasa production for the
spring, hut it's not a musical.
Ram's \ lead is bankrupt.
Ram's Head was kicked out of Memorial Auditori
um.
These may he some of the rumors you might have
heard ahout Ram's 1 lead and the spring musical.
Although the latter two speculations are com
pletely false, the first two are definitely true. Yes, that
non-musical production is "Loot," a hitingly hilarious
black comedy from British playwright JoeOrton. How
ever, the reasons for deciding on "Loot" are varied and
almost all positive. The bottom line: The play is brilliant
and very pertinent to Stanford.
"Loot" is a play about authority, deception, corrup
tion and human nature. Giving it a comic twist, Orton
sets the storyline in the living room of the McLeavy
household.
The situation: A bank robbery has occurred a few
days before and the police are not letting up their search.
The robbers, of course, need to find a place to hide the
loot, a place the police would not think to look.
The first scene begins a few days after the robbery.
Mrs. McLeavy (played by a dummy) has just passed
away and Mr. McLeavy (Raul D'Albora) isunsure about
what to do next and what to think. "He's a repressed, old
British dude," says D'Albora. Fortunately Mr. McLeavy
has Fay ( Tami Jones), the faithful nurse of the late Mrs.
McLeavy, to help him cope with the trauma of losing his
wife. Mr. McLeavy's son, Hal (James Jhun) is also a
source of comfort for the widower. In fact, he is such a
devoted son that he stays close to his mother's coffin to
make sure that she rests in peace. Hal's best 112 riend Den
nis (Christian Zupancic), the assistant undertaker, also
helps the Mcl eavys in this time of sorrow and grief.
I lowever, everyone has a selfish motive for their ac
tions. And when Truscott (Chris Tate), a policeman
comes around and starts asking questions about the
robbery that occurred earlier at the local bank, the
events begin to unravel. Truscott soon realizes that the
situation is not as it seems.
Now is the perfect time to divulge that (drum roll,
please) Hal and Dennis are responsible for the heist. It

■l turns nut that they got inside
W the hank vault by tunneling
in from the undertaker's of
-3 fiee next door. After the rob
bery, the two hid the money
in the closet of the living
room.
"But when Hal hears that
there is a random person
» snooping around and asking
questions about the robbery,
they switch the money and the
body, so that the corpse is in the
closet and the loot is in the cof
fin," explains James )hun, the

proud portrayer of Hal.
but how did Truscott even get embroiled in the
whole fiasco? I )irector (iabe Tissian elucidates that "Tr
uscott suspects 1 )ennis because he is the undertaker's as
sistant, and both he and Hal have both been arrested in
the past for theft. After visiting Dennis's house and not
finding him there, Truscott disguises himself as a repre
sentative from the Water Board, and starts interrogating
everyone in the McLeavy house."
You may be wondering why Truscott goes to the
trouble of hiding his identity. It's because he doesn't have
a warrant to search the house and interrogate the peo
ple, so he must resort to other means. Although his
methods may not he legal or ethical, they achieve his
ends, and are therefore justified.
Tate says of his character, "Truscott reinvents the
sense of logic so that it applies to himself. I le's a crack
pot. Truscott, on the other hand, would simply refer to
himself as an 'individual thinker.' But he's just a police
man who's taken his job too far. Representing the
theme of corruption and authority, Truscott shows how
both are intertwined.
The scenario: a coffin between two flanking chairs.
An oak wardrobe stands to the right of the coffin. The
wood furniture matches the somber atmosphere of the
room, and over the fireplace, the portrait of a French
gentleman with an ironic smile tin his face foreshadows
the coming revelations.
For example, in the scene where Fay, Hal and Dennis
are planning to switch the body and the money, the
three stand around the coffin deep in conspiracy. A
sense of anxiety and nervousness pervade their posture
and movements as one of them reaches into the coffin
and removes the body. Swathed in blue fabric, the
corpse of Mrs. McLeavy is a sight to behold, lay and 1 lal
work cooperatively to try to move the body into the clos
et.
Ilowever, before this action could be completed, Mr.
McLeavy barges into the room. The corpse is quickly
dropped by Fay, and Hal tries to hide the bulky draped
figure behind him. Mr. McLeavy demands to know what
the package is behind 1 lal.
Fay sassily answers, "It's my new... urn, appliance.

Yes. Appliance."
"Well, why isn't it upstairs in your room?"
"1 thought I'd work down here. Mrs. McLeavy's pres
ence brings me, um, inspiration."
"Then, by all means, continue your work."
With her sharp wittiness, Fay takes control of the sit
nation, and manipulates Mr. McLeavy's response. It
does not even occur to Mr. McLeavy to think that the
trio may have been planning some sort of nefarious act
with the corpse.
Necrophilic acts, perhaps?
Another illustration of Fay's strength is seen when
she tries to get Mr. McLeavy to propose to her.
"This is vintage Fay," says Jones.
She describes, "For example, Fay pushes him to the
ground and says, 'Get on your knees. I'm a great believ
erin traditional positions.' "
"Loot" is chock full of social messages. Orton warns
against blindly believing in what people tell you, because
for the most part, there is always a deeper truth than
what you see at face value. Most importantly, Orton
cautions against naively following authority. When Mr.
McLeavy cooperates with the crooked cop Truscott, he
says,"I sure like to be an assistant to authority."
"This play flouts every social value you can think of.
Respect for parents, respect for the dead, hone.sty,
friendship and a whole lot else," says Tissian.
These underlying themes of the play reflect Orton's
attitude towards society and authority, which is under
standable considering the circumstances surrounding
his life.
An outsider in conservative British society, Orton
was one of the early revolutionaries of the '60s, though
not by choice. He had two strikes against because of his
homosexuality and working class status. However,
Orton realized that there was nothing wrong with being
gay or poor, although he felt that his father and mother
who were poor all their lives and killed themselves toil
ing for nothing, were victims of their status. This view
led to his initial bitterness and grudge against socieh
and all its governing restraints.
These intense feelings increased upon his acceptance
into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RAPA), the
premier drama school in Britain, where he met his lite
long partner. Unlike Orton, Halliwell was rich and edu
cated, but due to his unattractive physique, also an out
cast. After leaving RADA, the two wrote several unsuc
cessful novels together. This lack of achievement only
made them increasingly angry towards society, which
they blamed for their rejection. In addition, Orton's
promiscuity only created more tension between the two.
"He liked to cruise the bathrooms of clubs, which was a
great place for to pick up people," explains Tissian.
Orton and Halliwell acted out against their lack of
success in writing novels by tampering with the covers of
library books to make lewd collages. Eventually nabbed
by the police, the two were thrown in jail for six months,
which only intensified their anger towards society.

For Orton, this incident only solidified his antisocial
stance, and fueled his desire to expose all the wrongs so
ciety as done him. He did this through three plays and
four one acts. "Loot" and his third play, "What the But
ler Saw," were complete successes. Seeing that Orton was
receiving all the glory that Halliwell thought he himself
should have received, Halliwell became more psychotic
and enraged. He simply could not deal with the idea that
Orton, someone that Halliwell thought he had made,
was more prosperous than he was. So, before Orton's
fourth play was completely revised, Halliwell bashed
Orton's head in with a hammer and then

committed suicide. Orton was
only 31 years old.
This tragedy emphasizes the
dangerous effects of blindly follow
ing society's bidding, of believing in
basic social values. Why? "Because
those values are not valid. We are
taught that they are true by society,
but we don't actively believe in
them, since those values are not
things we came up with by our
selves," says Tissian, who worked on
a professional production of "Loot."
"Loot" is especially pertinent to
Stanford because many people blind
ly follow and believe the dictates of
authority figures. In addition, col
lege is a time when people learn
about themselves, and "Loot" is a
play that explores the dark side of
human nature. It is frightening to
think that perhaps underneath it all
we don't respect anyone or any
thing, only ourselves. Although the
story has a dismal message, Tissian
hopes that "the play will cause the
audience to look at the ugliness of
people and laugh at our own avarice
and opportunism." He also feels
that this production will force peo

pic to face the change in Stanford "from
.1 comfortable, relaxed, progressive school to one that is
very apathetic, cold and business-like" during the last
few years.
"Loot" also stresses the idea of independent thought,
of questioningauthority, of questioning ourselves." I he
only kind of morality we can forge is when we're all
watching each other," says Tissian.
I'm sure Orton would agree.
Originally, Ram's Head had asked Tissian to direct
another play, but when that project fell through, Tissian,
proposed "Loot" as the group's spring production. I he
Ram's Head selection committee decided that produc
ing "Loot," a comedy, instead of the traditional spring
musical was better than having no production at all, so
thev approved Tissian's proposal.

"We decided that it was in Ram's Head's best interest
not to do a musical this year. We had the money to put
on a spring musical, but thought that it was time for a
change, and Ram's Head often sponsors special projects
like 'Little Shop of Horrors' a few years ago in the
spring," says Kaz Brecher, producer of "Loot" and mem
ber of Ram's Head Board of Directors.
Though it is untrue that Ram's Head is bankrupt,
the group "has had financial difficulties that were the
result of several years of low returns for the spring pro
duction," explains Brecher. Production costs are rising

every year, due mostly to the increase in the price of the
plays' rights.
In addition, the cost of events and services at Stanford
is quite expensive. "Although there is no fee to use
Memorial Auditorium, the group does have to pay for an
events and services supervisor, and that costs a lot of
money," continues Brecher. Ram's Head is self-financed
and does not receive any aid from the University. This
has only increased Ram's Head tenuous financial situa
tion.
Why didn't the group apply for a special fee request
from the ASSU?
Brecher explains, "I don't know why. We're one of the
oldest groups on campus and a lot of things have just be
come tradition. The problems we have now are probably

the result of what people were doing 10 years ago."
In addition, because a board of directors runs Ram's •
Head, it is often difficult to reach a consensus on deci
sions.
The group plans to raise funds next year to avoid such
financial difficulties.
Ram's Head definitely has a place in the Stanford
community. Since the Drama Department usually fills
the niche of straight drama. Ram's Head caters to the
needs of those students interested in musical theater on
campus.
Why is

"Loot" not being
"*V performed in
] Memorial Au
ditorium?
The setting
of the play does not
require such a large
space, and Elliot
Program Center
lends itself to the
atmosphere of
"Loot," says
Brecher. "We
wanted a small
space with a living
room feel. Also, this
way, we can avoid
the supervision
costs."
The change
in venue and the
production of a
comedy instead ofj
a musical has had
only positive reac
tions. "People really
feel for this show,
and that gives it a lot
more life," says stage
manager Ariana
Garfi n k e 1.

"People are
going to laugh a hell of a lot," promises Tate with a grin.
Is this the end of the traditional Ram's Head spring
musical?
Hmm. You decide.
