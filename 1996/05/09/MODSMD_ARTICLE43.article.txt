## VARIOUS ARTISTS The 						Lounge Ax Defense & Relocation Compact Disc 
### 
Lounge Ax is Chicago's premier rock
club, a small, friendly place that presents the
best bands in the world on a regular basis.
Tickets are cheap, the entertainment is
great, and the environment is always pleas
ant. Hut in ISW3, a new neighbor moved in
behind the club and began complaining
about the noise. I )espite having spent sever
al thousand dollars on additional sound
proofing, l ounge Ax was called in to a
meeting with the neighbor ami the city's
I iquor (Commissioner, and the club was or
dered to close down. I ounge Ax, however,
remained open, hired .1 lawyer and was tick
eted and lined 011 a nightly basis.
In order to support the historic club,
(Chicago indie label Touch and (io has put to
gether a benefit album to help Lounge Ax pay
its tees and possibly move to a friendlier area.
"The Lounge Ax 1 )efense & Relocation (Com
pact 1 )isc" features tracks from 14 bands, sev
eral of them from the (Chicago area and all of
them familiar with 1 ounge Ax's history.
Aside from the noble cause, this is simply
a great (CD. The list of contributors speaks for
itself: The Jesus Lizard, Shellac, Sebadoh,
June of '44, the (Coctails, (iuided by Voices,
Archers of Loaf, bad 1 ivers, Yo la Tengo,
Mekons, Superclumk, Seam, Tortoise and
Rachel's. While so many benefit albums are
just collections of scattered leftovers, the
Lounge Ax record shows these bands at their
best, without a single lackluster track in the
bunch.
Guided by Voices' "Beneath a Festering
Moon" is one of the prettiest songs the band
has done, its quiet acoustic opening unfold
ing into a rugged, fuzzed-out, percussion
happy anthem. The Chicagoans in Seam
work similar magic: "The Prizefighters" is
dense, tense pop music at its best, carried by
unsettling drum-work and pleasantly

strained vocals.
The (Coctails and
Yo la Tengo (play
ing here with two
members of the
(Coctails) are un
characteristically
noisy, but with
generally spectac
ular results. The
Archers of Loaf,
Tortoise and
Rachel's further
help out with
great all instru
mental stuff. The
highlights of the
record, however,
are the tracks by
Shellac and June
of 44, two of the
most inventive
and impressive
guitar bands
around. Shellac's
"Killers is a tight
and all too brief
gem, while June
of '44's "Rivers

and Plains" spreads out, expands and con
tracts in the most aggressively hypnotic way.
II this is the kind of noise that Lounge Ax
has to offer, I can't imagine anyone com
plaining.
