# THE
						JESUS LIZARD
## Shot 
### 
Arc Jesus Lizard fans worried about their
favorite hand's newest alhuni, "Shot," being
produced by music hogwhores Capitol
Records? After an ambivalent first listen,
"Shot" mitigates anticipated worries and de
mands that JL's audience not take its band for
granted.
With no tangible idea of how JL's fans
might feel about this major-label switch, 1
suffered to ponder the countless sick ways in
which major label

Capitol Records'
music agents and
promoters could
pitch their new prize
(probably with the
words "Iggy Pop,
" 1.0 11 apal o o z a
"great success" and
"influential band"
thrown around).
This imagined de
scription of the lesus
Lizard possibly
pokes more fun than
is warranted, and
perhaps, is misdi
rected criticism.
However, it is not so
sinful that a band
like Jesus Lizard
would be sporting a
label like Capitol
Records. This is the
fate of almost any
band that produces
music of incredibly

high quality and garners a following for more
than just a few years.
The real question is whether or not the
hand has compromised any of its musical in
tegrity in this latest release. The most obvious
stand-out from previous II work is David
Vow's voice. Instead of the painfully distort
ed, sub-human vocal expression that usually
characterizes his singing, the listener can ac
tually hear it. This may anger those pining for
something that sounds a little more drunk,
but it is consistent with Vow's indiscriminate
sense of humor.
The second difference on "Shot" is the
music. While its sound production has a dif
ferent quality, it stays within the band's
strange rhythmic hurls â€” jazz-inflected har
monics, hypnotic, manipulative composi
tion. Only "1 Situated Myself Here" might
truly piss off some listeners since it lags
mightily, even if it sounds like it could be an
other musical parody.
Lastly, "Shot" is a slower album than other
11. discs. The tempos in the fast songs on ear
lier work such as "Down," "Liar" and "Goat"
seem more aggressive, like the hand is work
ing at more beats per minute. This slowness
does not detract from II ,'s edginess, but defi
nitely may take getting used to.
The different production quality in
"Shot" demands a different type of listening,
one which II fans should not be so quick to
judge. They're still a disturbingly gifted mu
sical group.
