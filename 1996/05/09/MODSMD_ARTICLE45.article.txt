# NEVER ON SUNDAY

It would be haril to describe the style of
Never On Sunday in just one phrase. Their
songs range from punk to mellow to rock.
The vocals vary from grungy to Morrisey
like. The only word that could describe this
self-titled album on the whole would be aver
age.
It's nice to see a band that doesn't restrict
their music to a formula, at the same time it
reflects the reason whv most bands stick to a

strict sound: they find something they are
good at and exploit it. Unfortunately, by of
fering a variety of songs, Never on Sunday
sacrifice the ability to fine tune one sound
that would be unique to their name.
It's not that the songs are had. "No Lies"
will get you moving and tapping your foot.
But this is the kind of song that you might
find from a party scene in a John Hughes
film, not a song that you would hear played
normally on the radio.
Keith Glory must be given kudos for his
vocals, however. When 1 heard the opening
song, "Mellow Yellow," I was turned off by
the vocals which sounded like they came
straight from the back of his throat, but with
the second song, "Drag Me Down," I realized
that Glory also had a pleasing, melodic voice
as well. His ability to switch vocals according
to the mood of the song is a definite plus.
The music is also decent. The guitar riffs
are better than your typical power chord pro
gressions and again the variety of styles keep
the album interesting. But after listening to
the entire album, very few (if any) of the riffs
stuck in my mind. They weren't boring, hut

they weren t very special either.
This debut album should not discount
Never On Sunday as a potential success.
Some of their songs have definite character to
them (such as "Wishing Well") which could
place them apart from other bands. But the
album as a whole doesn't focus on this char
acter and tries to explore too much. Instead
of having a concrete idea about what Never
On Sunday is, it left me without a clue and
with an average feeling about the CD.
