# SEMISONIC
## Great Divide 
### 
Small Wonder, the obscure 80s sitcom
about a suburban family with a robot daugh
ter named Vicki, was chock full of epiphanic
family moments — what was creepy was the
subtext to all that cheese. You'd be in the
midst of watching a touching conversation
between the disgustingly pubescent son,
Jamie, and his sister of sorts, Vicki, and in
would walk the dad with a screwdriver to
open up Vicki's back — exposing a tangle of
wires and reminding you just how perverse
the situation really was.
Great Divide, the debut album from Min
neapolis trio Semisonic is a lot like that. No
matter how much sugary shellac guitarist /
vocalist Dan Wilson piles on his shameless
suburban power pop, the album is soon
enough sprawled open like robot-child Vicki,
and something is clearly wrong. Is it Wilson's
Stephen -Malkmus-meets-Kermit-the-Frog
vocal style? Is it the Jeopardy!-esque Daily-
Double sound effects of "Brand New Baby?"
Or is it the chorus to "Delicious," which goes
something like "Hoo hoo / yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah?"
Well, it's all of those. Wilson goes about
song writing as if every track was meant to be
the uplifting theme to some screwball-ro
mantic-comedy-road-trip movie, warning
against taking his woes too seriously ("You
don't need to save me / Don't waste your
pity"). Normally, this is a refreshing quality
in a music scene marked by artists with an an
noying penchant for gratuitously turning
their skin inside out.

But in this case it all comes oil as lust an
other smug gesture, a pathetic Sebastian
Bach-like kick in the pants to "alternative"
music. When Wilson wryly croons, "And the
magazines still have to sell us 12 master ge
niuses a year / Its all so shameless," over the
anthem posture of "The Prize," one instinc
tuallv finds themselves muttering about
stones and glass houses.
Despite this, Semisonic do craft some in
credibly infectious musical moments on
Great Divide — it's too bad they're all pure
ear candy moments, void of any sincerity,
lust because something's catchy doesn't
mean it's good (think "Don't Worry Be
Happy"), and Great Divide is, at best, a col
lection of songs you spend the day trying des
perately to get out of your head.
