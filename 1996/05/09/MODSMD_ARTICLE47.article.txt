# GROOVE COLLECTIVE
## We the People 
### 
New York City's acid jazz performers,
(iroove Collective, have pegged themselves as
the harbingers of musical appreciation and
awareness of contemporary forms of jazz.
Since 1990, their claim has been that they will
forge a new "scene" via their "Thursday night
Giant Step parties" and their record releases
like their latest "We the People."
Big claim? Yes. In their second attempt,
just like in their lirst. Groove Collective fails
to revolutionize people's musical under
standing of jazz heritage. Instead of crafting
something cleverly artful, in "We the People,"
Groove Collective evokes a bland acid jazz
experience one will forget not too long after a
listening excursion.
Most people have a confused notion as to
what qualifies as acid jazz (trendy-yuppie
bohemian-ness or college-Gen-X-affecta
tion?). Technically defined, acid jazz means
live instrumental jams and improvisation on
a break beat and / or bass line from an old
jazz or funk tune laid down by the deejay ac
companiment or copied by the actual bassist.
"We the People" serves as testimony that
this style of musical creation does not neces
sarily give rise to interesting and original
work. Replete with Heav-ish (Brand New

Heavies) easy jams, the latest Groove Collec
tive hides under trite Latin jazz compositions
that are so uninteresting that I couldn't even
imagine what commercials the music could
be tagged to (GC's "Lift Off" for marketing
cofffee? for douche products? airline ser
vices? hmmm...).
When they finally pick up the quality in
the latter half of the album, their skilled mu
sicianship surfaces in characteristic jazz im
provisation and then plummets when paired
with vocals. (They should have left rapping
and vocals long ago.. .especially considering
they rarely do vocal accompaniments when
they perform live). This leaves you wonder
ing exactly what people Groove Collective
were referring to when they named their
album "We the People."
Groove Collective has struggled to pro
duce a second album which lives up to quali
ty acid jazz. Rather than true jazz improvisa
tion, "We the People" weighs down with
happy, cheesy dance tracks and Latin jazz
spin-offs (replicable, if not negligible). This
factor obscures most of the musical innova
tion of which (iroove Collective seem capable
either on their first album or in live perfor
mances.
