# MTT CONDUCTS
## Romeo and Juliet 
### 
This is Michael Tilson Thomas's very first
recording with the San Francisco Symphony
after succeeding 1 lerbert Blomstedt as Music
Director in 1995. The repertoire features
MTTs personal selections from Prokofiev's
"Romeo and Juliet" for orchestra, which in
its entirety would fill two CD's. The abridged
version presented here follows Shakespeare's
chronological sequence even better than
Prokofiev's uncut score.
Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet" suite is
perhaps his most popular orchestral work,
overflowing with ardent lyricism and a

heightened sense of drama. MTT remains
thoroughly alert to Prokofiev's poignancy
and sharp twists hidden under sweet
melodies. Often opting for breath-taking
tempos, he highlights the tension and clashes
between the two feudal families in "Romeo
and Juliet." Under his baton, the San Francis
co Symphony emanates a youthful buoyancy
and vitality well matched for the score, yet
never loses sight of intimate moments calling
for pensive moods.
Indeed, the SI C) shows itself capable of
full-blown histrionics when the occasion calls
for them. The strings command a stunning
athleticism in the "Fight Scene" (Track 5) and
.111 arching elasticity in "Act I" (Track 1).
Woodwinds, in particular solo passages for
clarinets and flutes, impart a glowing ripeness
and darting rhythms in "Dance with the
Mandolins" (Track IS) and a sensual tran
quillity in "Romeo and Juliet'* (Track 24). The
percussionists are certainly the most notable
contributors, dishing out deafening clashes in
the "Fight Scene" and jarring pomposity in
the "Arrival of the Guests" ( I'rack 10) while
ushering ominous themes in "Death of Ty
balt" ( Track 23). liven the brass section,
which in concert sometimes teeters on
cracking, fares surprisingly well in orches
tral tutti, especially in climaxes that demand
a blasting fanfare. Throughout the piece, the
brass and woodwind often go hand in hand
in delivering passages of great pathos and
conflict. Nowhere does the entire orchestra
join force more beautifully than in "Public
Merrymaking" ( Track 19), where percus
sionists provide a palpitating urgency, let
ting the brass flourish with vibrant strings
and woodwinds.
For people unfamiliar with Prokofiev or
simply turned off by avant-garde 20th centu
ry music, this CD has plenty of sweet tunes to
offer, many of which have made their way
into movie soundtracks and commercials.
For the more adventurous listeners, try his
symphonies or concertos, as this piece is con
servative in harmonic idioms even in
Prokofiev's outputs.
