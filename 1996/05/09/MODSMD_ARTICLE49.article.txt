## Cemetery Man 
### 
Shooting the* dead can he such a drag.
At least this is what Francesco I )ellamorte, played by a doleful Rupert
Everett ("I'ret a Porter"), thinks. The caretaker of the Buffalora ceme
tery, he is faced with an epidemic that brings the dead back to life after
seven days — most of whom have developed an appetite for the living.
I lis strategy? I le packs a revolver loaded with bullets to split their heads
open and put them in the ground for good. If that doesn't work, he im
provises with a spade or an axe.
If you've seen "Night of the I iving I )ead," then there's no need for you
to see this artistic rehash. "(Cemetery Man" looks like a farcical take-off
of Michael Jackson's " Thriller video. Its macabre nature never quite
goes beyond a plateau of schlock scare tactics that build little suspense
and even less humor. The best parts are too short, as when a calm I verett
sits in his makeshift hovel as zombies burst through one by one. I le starts
firing ofl round after round as it they were a mobile shooting gallery.
The film's banal plot is built around I )ellamorte's search for the dis
tinction between the living and the dead. I lis ultimate dilemma is get
ting involved with an innocuous Italian beauty w ho shows up first as a
grieving widow (who quickly loses her mourning posture to her rising
libido), then as a phallus phobic mayor's assistant and finally as a pros
titute. Dellamorte falls in and out of love with this recurring metaphor
for false life and hope until blurred lines drive him to the edge of insan
ity, literally.
Stvlishlv overwrought, the c inematograph\ employs many different
perspectives and captivating shots, but unfortunately, these effects
overwhelm the intriguing moral conflicts that underlie Dellamorte's
obsession with the dead and his ambivalence about the living. Only his
grunting assistant, the physically hideous but strangely endearing
Clnaghi, provides any kind of real human warmth to the film. Everyone
else is a one-dimensional zombie-to be, infected with not only the curse
of coming back from the dead, but of being alive and being given very
bad lines.
Bordering on the absurd, hinging on the tasteless and indulging in
gratuitous homage to Hitchcock, "Cemetery Man" is best kept below
ground. When and il it is resurrected, don't hesitate to shoot it dead.
