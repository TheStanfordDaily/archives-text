# What new world order?
## Rice and Sofaer discuss foreign-policy obstacles 
### Therese Lee Contributing writer 
The current state of the international en
vironment poses numerous challenges to
U.S. foreign policy, Provost Condoleezza Rice
and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Abra
ham Sofaer said last night in an informal talk
at Bechtel International Center.
The talk was the fourth and final discus
sion in the Fulbright Lecture Series, which
celebrated the 50th year of the academic
overseas program begun by Sen. J. William
Fulbright in 1946.
Rice argued that the new world order that
has emerged in the five years since the end of
the Cold War does not look the way some peo
ple expected. "The Cold War was indeed an
odd period," said Rice. "The new world order

was a kind of throw-away line in President
Bush's speech to the [United Nations]."
Much of Rice's commentary centered on
the future of Russia. She expressed concern
about the role of Russia in a unified Europe.
"Russia has never been a part of Europe,"
said Rice. "Russia was most important in Eu
ropean politics when its armies were in Paris
or Germany or wherever. Without a threat, it
has been largely irrelevant to European poli
tics."
Rice was also pessimistic about Russia's
potential to be a good partner to the United
States, regardless of the success of its democ
ratization.
"Non-aggressive foreign policy and
democracy don't necessarily go hand in
hand," said Rice. "This is a myth.
Just ask Central America about
the United States."
Yet even if Russia achieves a de
mocratic system of government,
Rice said it would be a different
form of democracy than most
Americans are accustomed to. "I
don't really believe it's in the DNA
of Russia," said Rice.
Sofaer, meanwhile, discussed
the upcoming presidential election
in the United States. He called the
1996 campaign a "silly season"
where "foreign policy becomes vir
tually irrelevant." He criticized
President Clinton's policies as "in
consistent" and cited Clinton's
changing attitudes on the Bosnian
situation as evidence.
"I don't think Bosnia is a suc
cess story," said Sofaer. "We really
don't want a new world order in
which so much killing has to
occur."
Other participants at the open
discussion repeatedly addressed is
sues in Asia, specifically those con
cerning China and North Korea.
"North Korea is very dangerous,"
said Sofaer. "They're in the same
league as Libya. Maybe worse."
"But Clinton handled the Tai
wan situation very well," he added.
"I think the Chinese are an evil
group of people. I would like to see
them fail. It is important that the
world move toward freedom."
He said the current Chinese
regime's "days are numbered. I
won't be unhappy when they're re
placed with a system more like the
one that Taiwan has."

Rice said she was "very worried
about Asia" and the lack of atten
tion that the sub-Asian nations
were receiving, calling disputes be
tween India and Pakistan "very
dangerous."
Rice also highlighted the widen
ing disparities in the level of de
mocratization in different coun
tries.
Africa, for instance, "is a conti
nent that is in very, very deep trou
ble. It is a humanitarian, health,
economic, political and ethnic dis

aster," she said. "In the absence of
the Cold War, nobody seems to
care. We will all regret it if Africa is
allowed to spiral down into the
depths."
The provost also voiced reserva
tions about American show of force
abroad. "I don't think the U.S. mil
itary ought to get involved," she
said. "If worse comes to worse, they
should fight regional hegemons
like Saddam Hussein. Otherwise,
they have to stay home. Let others
do the peacekeeping chores."
