# Barb Wire
## 
### 
"Barb Wire" is, without a doubt, one of
the worst movies I have ever seen.
Now that that's out in the open, let's talk
about Pamela Anderson Lee, the movie's
"star." t lello? I low did this woman get above
the-title billing in anything other than a
porno?
But actually, speaking of pornos, "Barb
Wire" comes pretty darn close — about as
close as you're going to get in a mainstream

movie. It's a movie for those men who
aren't quite ready to attack a real red light
district porno on the big screen and it has
enough "action" (i.e., scenes of scantily
clad Pam running around kicking people)
to make it appear as though there may be a
plot.
There isn't one. In fact, the movie ought to
be called "Silicone on Parade," because that's
pretty much what it is. Pain's attempts at
breathy voice-over narration made the lady
next to me openly giggle, and parents literal
ly had to cover their kids' eyes during the
opening credits, which is just a striptease se

quence (no joke) set to the cheesiest heavy
metal music this side of"! lead banger's Ball."
(At this point I had to ask myself what kind of
parents would bring their child to this movie
anyway.)
So anyway, back to the plot (or lack there
of). The movie is based on a comic book, so
it's supposed to be campy, but COME on!
What does Pam running around in a dog
collar and stilettos have to do with anything?
The only semblance of an explanation of
what the hell is going on comes at the begin
ning of the movie in a "Star Wars"-esque
written explanation accompanied with the

requisite "voice of God" narrator. As tar as I
could tell, the basic premise of the movie re
volves around new-age mercenary Pam sav
ing the United States from dictators who
dress and act like Nazis.
In essence, the only people who should
see "Barb Wire" arc pubescent boys, dirty
old men (of which there happened to be
quite a few when I saw the movie) and sci
entists studying the effect of breast im
plants on cardiovascular exercise. Anyone
else should be ashamed to even think
about it.
