# The
						Great White Hype
## 
### 
The first 15 minutes of "The Great White
Hype" are hilarious.
It starts with the heavyweight champion
of the world, James "The Grim Reaper"
Roper (Damon Wayans) pummeling a help
less opponent and then giving a perfectly
egocentric post-fight interview, assessing his
opponents ineptitude with lines like, "He hit
me once, but otherwise it was like fighting
my little sister."
There is also a very funny scene involving
Roper and his promoter, the Rev. Fred Sultan
(Sam Jackson) in Sultan's suite. It seems that
the fight lost money and the Reverend can't
afford to pay his champ (he appeases him
with two Rolls-Royces, his seventh and
eighth, respectively). Sultan decides that

people no longer want to pay money to see
"brothers beating up brothers."
So the flashy and corrupt Reverend Sultan
decides to set up a fight between Roper and a
white opponent, "Irish" Terry Conklin (Peter
Berg) who has never fought as a pro but once
beat Roper as an amateur boxer. Conklin de
cides to fight as a crusader for homelessness
and promises to give all his money to charity.
He is good looking, he trains hard and he is,
of course, The Great White Hope. Mean
while, Roper decides to train by watching
movies and smoking cigarettes, figuring,
"my blackness will beat him." So the premise
is set for some flashy promotion and a final
showdown. Let's get ready to rumble!
Or maybe not.
The rest of the movie has long scenes with
no laughs, a final fight that doesn't live up to
its billing and lots of confused characters. Jon
Lovitz and Checch Marin arc in this movie,
both good comics who are misused because

they are given nothing funny to say. Jeff
Cioldblum is also misused as an aimless jour
nalist-turned-promoter-turned-music man
ager.
Samuel Jackson's charismatic, turban
wearing Rev. Sultan is the centerpiece of the
flick, a promoter so twisted he makes Don
King look like a saint.
But despite the impressive cast, the movie
drags. There is never any tension between the
characters and all of the scenes that lead up to
the big fight finale are just filler.
Director Reginald Hudlin just doesn't
seem to know what to do with all of his char
acters, so he creates a couple of subplots that
are annoying and a final turn that falls flat.
This could have been a very funny parody of
the boxing world, but instead it runs out of
steam. Watching "The Cireat White Hype" is
like watching a valiant effort by a tired fight
er who gets KO'd in the 10th round.
