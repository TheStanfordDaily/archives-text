## The 						Pallbearer 
### 
Finally, originality.
"The Pallbearer" is a fresh and captivating black com
edy that has jump-started the film career of David
Schwimmer. As still-living-at-home with his-mother
twenty-something Tom Thompson, Schwimmer brings
to lite a different sort of meek character than his Ross of
NBC's "Friends;" Tom, unlike the amiable Ross, has an
edge.
Tom is a struggling architect that has yet to land his
first job. His best friends are married while he has never
had a serious relationship. The film's title is derived from
the death of one of Tom's high school classmates — one
he cannot remember. Mrs. Abernathy (Barbara Her
shev), the dead Bill Abernathy's mother, asks Tom to not
only be a pallbearer, but to deliver the eulogy. With bla
tant reference 1969's "The Graduate," the film chronicles
the double romance Tom seeks — one with the lonely
Mrs. Abernathy, the other with another high school class
mate that has reentered his life — Julie DeMarco
(Gwyneth Halt row).
I lowever, Schwimmer injects a different sort of naivete
into the role of the young protagonist, one less tainted
with conscience and more with self-doubt than Dustin
Hoffman's classic college graduate. His chemistry with
both Hershey and Fa It row is unmistakable. In addition,
director Matt Reeves frames the action with portions of
slow motion and unconventional screen movement that
lends an aura of surrealism to the film's plot.
Barbara Hershey is delectable as the vulnerable yet se
ductive Mrs. Abernathy, all bleached blonde hair and
manipulative glances. Michael Rappoport also shines in
his brief rehashing of his familiar guv's best friend role,
providing New York sensibility — "Write her a poem; tell
her it's over" — in a film set in Brooklyn without exploit
ing its stereotypes. And the beautiful sans makeup Pal
trow is excellently unapproachable as the elusive and
aloof Julie.
But the film's true star is its series of plot twists on
seemingly familiar plotlines — the best friend's marriage,
a funeral, a reconciliation. "The Pallbearer" is a wholly
original film that reaches beyond the witty dialogue and
hip backdrops that characterize recent films involving
twenty-something romances. It is a truly enjoyable
movie.
