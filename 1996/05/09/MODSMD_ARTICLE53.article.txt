# Last Dance
## 
### 
Determined to prove her Oscar-nominated
performance in "Casino" was more than just a
fluke, Sharon Stone takes on the role of a death

row inmate in her latest flick, "Last Dance."
In the film, Stone plays double-murderess
Cindy Liggett, whose latest clemency request has
been denied and who is scheduled to be the first

woman in 11 years to be executed by
lethal injection. In the first half of the
film, we meet Cindy's latest attorney,
Rick Hayes, played by the unbelievably
smarmy Rob Morrow, and we follow
him in his attempts to convince the state's
execution-happy governor that Cindy
doesn't deserve to die. It is the second half
of the movie, however, that is actually
worth watching, for it is here that we get
to know Cindy Liggett, and it is here that,
believe it or not, Stone shines.
Despite claims of inferiority to the eel
ebrated "Dead Man Walking," "Last
Dance" manages to hold its own in the
recently popularized prison movie genre.
The reason is simply that Stone's perfor
mance carries the film, proving, onceand
for all, that her acting capabilities do in
fact extend beyond the realm of spread
ing her legs in "Basic Instinct." When
Stone is on screen, the movie is engaging,
thought-provoking and, above all, inter
esting. When she's not, it lapses into the

standard cliches oft he death penalty debate. And
every time the tight-faced, lip-pursing Morrow
comes on screen, you want to punch him in the
face and inform him that he cannot act. One of
the film's humorous moments, in fact, is when
the newly-artistic Cindy draws a caricature of
Rick, deftly capturing all his smugness and self
satisfaction in her drawing.
The supporting performances, too, are
hardly noteworthy and only serve to detract
from the film. A subplot involving Rick's con
descending older brother (Peter Gallagher) is
wasted, since we don't really like Rick .ill that
much and are more concerned with Cindy's
fate than his.
"l ast Dance" is a capable, engaging movie,
but it definitely could have been better had the
director chosen to focus more 011 Stone and
less on Morrow. And every so often, the film
descends intocheesiness, especially in the mid
film conversations between Cindy and Rick,
but despite these drawbacks and the obvious
comparisons to "Dead Man Walking," "Last
Dance" is a film worth seeing, if only to wit
ness Stone's performance and discover that,
despite the obvious contradictions, she is a
very capable and praiseworthy actress.
