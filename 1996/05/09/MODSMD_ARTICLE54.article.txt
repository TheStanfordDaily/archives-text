## Seeta Gangadharan Beauty and the Fiend 
### 
I participated in my first ever modeling ex
perience not too long ago in New York
City and was completely blown away by
how women in the fashion show were not
that different from most students .it Stan
ford: confused, if not pathetic.
Having visited the boutique of a small,
but budding designer on numerous occa
sions and having chatted with him, I was
"chosen" among a bevy of "clients" to be in
his fall line "release party" in the West Vil
lage.
1 lis decision to use clients was deliberate,
and as he and his partner would later write
in their invitation: "Our basic philosophy is
that fashion is evolution, it is in a constant
progressive state of change. Our clients are
the catalyst for the evolution ot our designs.
We consider ourselves privileged to witness
this creative process as designers. How we
think our designs look is completely subjec
tive: when worn by real women (our clients)
they transform and evolve into our best
work." No intermediary needed — real
women evoke a sense ol style more creative
ly than any super-model.

Or at least this is half of what I believed
when I agreed to show up to the downtown
"space" for the opportunity to walk the cat
walk in front of 300 people.
I 'he topic of fashion and women elicits at
most an ambivalent response from most
people who are asked to comment. Most in
dividuals purport to reveal their, well, you
know, individuality through a thing called
expression — from wearing metallic-col
ored nail polish to wearing three-week-old,
stinky corduroys. Most individuals, howev
er, would not admit to the fashionableness
of their ensembles (i.e., "yeah ... I bought
this nail polish at Urban Outfitters where
you can find pre-fab torn bell bottoms for
45 bucks"). No one wants to admit to being
fashionable lest they appear less individual.
Or, as J. Crew's latest ad campaign quips:
"There is no such thing as style, there is only
expression."
This is confused, it not pathetic rhetoric.
The equivalence struck between evolution
ary fashion (true expression) and real
women spews all sorts of mythical con
structs. As it real individuality / real wom

anhood could ever he mediated through the
artifice of spectacle. As if anyone who
thought her or himself a true index of indi
viduality could exist. As il anyone could ac
tually quantify what is the most authentic
indication of individuality.
I admit to not being surprised by the in
stances of inanity which 112 experienced dur
ing my fashion-world escapade (aside from
my own ironic position as participant).
Statements by the models who were sup
posed to be real women (real clients) slipped
out. . .like: "I have the biggest ass out oianv
of the girls here," "1 don't know how to
walk," "Can you tell me how to take off a
jacket?"
Yes, that's right, given the opportunity
to manifest womanhood, the real women
bitched things up by stumbling over sim
ple concepts like ass si/e, walking and
dressing. This manner of self-ex
pression pervades most of our impres
sionable and warped minds (among other
things). We wonder how we're supposed
to look even though we cloak our curios
ity under the qualification of real women

and real individuals with loud declara
tions of individuality and real-ness. In a
clever display of self-deception, we be
lieve in the rhetoric of individualism and
alternative expression despite the fact
that everything around us is making the
same claims to individuality and alterna
ness.
It is this fact which links Stanford
women, students, what have you, most
closely to the ridiculous fashion scene 1 ex
perienced. both "scenes" boast of a multi
plicity of individuals who brandishing their
badges of self-expression, generally suc
cumb to the seductive call of self-indul
gence. From women thinking that they're
being themselves while they parade down a
50-foot catwalk to students eager to see
Douglas Coupland and his Generation X
"theory," we think ourselves so witty and
subversive by virtue of the obscurity of the
products we wear.
All this without bothering to scrutinize
the origins of this attitude. We are all
fiendishly whoring for the same fashion
sensibility.
