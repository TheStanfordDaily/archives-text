# Verdict on ethnic theme dorms mixed
## 
### Dana Hangai Contributing writer 
Ethnic theme houses serve a number
of functions at Stanford. For some mi
nority students, they are a home away
from home, offering support and under
standing. Cultural programming pro
vides an opportunity to promote aware
ness among all ethnicities.
Not everyone on campus, however,
agrees with the mission or the outcome
of theme houses. Grouping students to
gether by race can hurt racial relations
on campus, opponents say, claiming a
more evenly spread mixture of students
in all dorms is abetter route to creating
interracial harmony.
A recent Daily telephone poll asked
undergraduate students to categorize
their views on ethnic theme houses on
campus. A majority said they feel the
houses are a good idea overall, but a siz
able minority said they believe the pres
ence of theme houses creates barriers
among races.
Some students and faculty on cam
pus remain unconvinced that theme
houses offer the best answer to creating
a stable and productive relationship
among ethnic groups on campus.
Overall support
When asked if Stanford should have
ethnic theme houses, 76 percent of stu
dents polled supported the idea. Stan
ford currently has four ethnic theme
houses: Casa Zapata, Muwekma-tah
ruk, Okada and Ujamaa.
A total of 127 randomly selected un
dergraduate students participated in
the poll. Of those, 22 were currently liv
ing or had lived in an ethnic theme
house.
Approximately half of the total stu
dents polled said they do not think eth
nic theme houses create barriers among
races, while 41 percent believe they do.
An additional 9 percent said they did not

know enough to properly answer the
question.
Of the respondents who had lived in
an ethnic theme house, six students said
they feel ethnic theme houses were sep
arationist in one form or another.
Forty-six students who had not lived in
a theme dorm also shared this percep
tion.
Students were also asked to rate
their general impression of ethnic
theme houses. Half of the polled stu
dents said their impression was favor
able or strongly favorable; only 15 per
cent reported a negative impression.
Five of the 24 students who gave the
most favorable impression of ethnic
theme houses also said that they were
separatist in some way. In general, how
ever, students who said they had a neg

ative impression were likely to identify
the houses as separatist.
A home open to others
At Stanford, ethnic theme houses
serve a dual purpose. In addition to pro
viding the basic support structure of
any dorm, they are designed to offer cul
tural programming and resources for
both students of the designated ethnici
ty and students of other races.
Approximately half of the residents
of an ethnic theme house represent one
ethnicity. The remainder consists of an
ethnically diverse representation of the
rest of the campus.
