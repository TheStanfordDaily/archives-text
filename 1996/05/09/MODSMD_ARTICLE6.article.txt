# Verdict on ethnic theme dorms mixed
## 
### Dana Hangai Contributing writer 
Ethnic theme houses serve a number
of functions at Stanford. For some mi
nority students, they are a home away
from home, offering support and under
standing. Cultural programming pro
vides an opportunity to promote aware
ness among all ethnicities.
Not everyone on campus, however,
agrees with the mission or the outcome
of theme houses. Grouping students to
gether by race can hurt racial relations
on campus, opponents say, claiming a
more evenly spread mixture of students
in all dorms is abetter route to creating
interracial harmony.
A recent Daily telephone poll asked
undergraduate students to categorize
their views on ethnic theme houses on
campus. A majority said they feel the
houses are a good idea overall, but a siz
able minority said they believe the pres
ence of theme houses creates barriers
among races.
Some students and faculty on cam
pus remain unconvinced that theme
houses offer the best answer to creating
a stable and productive relationship
among ethnic groups on campus.
Overall support
When asked if Stanford should have
ethnic theme houses, 76 percent of stu
dents polled supported the idea. Stan
ford currently has four ethnic theme
houses: Casa Zapata, Muwekma-tah
ruk, Okada and Ujamaa.
A total of 127 randomly selected un
dergraduate students participated in
the poll. Of those, 22 were currently liv
ing or had lived in an ethnic theme
house.
Approximately half of the total stu
dents polled said they do not think eth
nic theme houses create barriers among
races, while 41 percent believe they do.
An additional 9 percent said they did not

know enough to properly answer the
question.
Of the respondents who had lived in
an ethnic theme house, six students said
they feel ethnic theme houses were sep
arationist in one form or another.
Forty-six students who had not lived in
a theme dorm also shared this percep
tion.
Students were also asked to rate
their general impression of ethnic
theme houses. Half of the polled stu
dents said their impression was favor
able or strongly favorable; only 15 per
cent reported a negative impression.
Five of the 24 students who gave the
most favorable impression of ethnic
theme houses also said that they were
separatist in some way. In general, how
ever, students who said they had a neg

ative impression were likely to identify
the houses as separatist.
A home open to others
At Stanford, ethnic theme houses
serve a dual purpose. In addition to pro
viding the basic support structure of
any dorm, they are designed to offer cul
tural programming and resources for
both students of the designated ethnici
ty and students of other races.
Approximately half of the residents
of an ethnic theme house represent one
ethnicity. The remainder consists of an
ethnically diverse representation of the
rest of the campus.
Benny Shendo, resident fellow for
Muwekma-tah-ruk, the Native Ameri-


Sothy Chhe — Daily
can theme house, believes that
ethnic houses help expose stu
dents to cultures that they might
not have experienced before.
"We're trying to build a com
munity of scholars and intellectu
als," Shendo said. "Our students
come together and talk together
about what it means to be Native
American or non-Native Ameri
can. Afterwards, we are able to
come together as individuals and
find out who we are."
Ethnic theme houses are also a
haven for minority students, ac
cording to Carl McCants, resident
fellow for Ujamaa, the African-
American theme house.
"Most white students will not
get followed from one building to
another simply because of the
color of their skin," McCants said.
"Most don't have to deal with ex
periences that they got in because
of special admissions policies. In a
theme house, people take you for
who you are and you don't have to
be a spokesperson for that partic
ular ethnicity."
However, some question the
wisdom of having a house devoted
to a single ethnicity, believing it
encourages separation and isola
tion.
"People should be proud of
their ethnicities, and everyone
benefits from the different back
grounds people bring," said sopho
more Julie Johnson, president of
the Stanford College Republicans.
"But first of all, people should be
available for each other, and all of
this sequestering doesn't make
sense. People shouldn't have to be
made more conscious of their race
than they were before."
Freshman Roget Ratchford, a
resident of Ujamaa, also found
fault with the ethnic theme hous
es' method of achieving multicul
turalism.

"It just entices people to stick
to what they've always known,"
Ratchford said. "If you've grown
up with black people or with an
Asian family, you're going to go
where there's the same type of
people. It's not multiculturalism;
it's the same culturalism. If you
want to promote multicultural
ism, just let a dorm be a dorm."
Fitting in
Another debated topic is
whether freshmen who do not
want to live in an ethnic theme
house should be assigned to one
because of their race in order to
encourage diversity.
"The whole quota deal makes
people feel like they have a less of
a choice," said freshman Natalie
Redmond, a resident of the Chi
cano / Latino theme house Casa
Zapata.
"Students are put here because
of their race and that takes away
from the general idea of multicul
turalism and what it's trying to
achieve," Redmond said. "If peo
ple are put here who really don't
want to be here, it just ends up
taking away from the whole at
mosphere of the theme house."
However, attitude plays a large
role in determining how well a
student fits into a theme house,
according to junior Carridine Say,
who has lived in Okada, the
Asian-American theme house, for
three years.
"If your outlook is that it's seg
regationist and you say I'm the
only white person living in a
theme house, you probably will
feel uncomfortable living there,"
Say said. "I think as long as you're
open-minded, the experience will
be good for you."
Okada resident fellow Derek
Miyahara also emphasized the
openness of an ethnic theme
house and the creation of pro
gramming that any student could
participate in, no matter what
their background.
"We don't have the right to

keep anyone out of this place,"
Miyahara said. "So we really can't
be accused of segregation. I prefer
to think of it as the right of people
exercising their right to live
where they want."
"You think of a fraternity,"
Miyahara continued. "For that,
you could select who could be
amongst them. Is that consid
ered separatist and segregation
ist? If someone wanted to live
here, no matter what back
ground they had, we couldn't
prevent them."
Freshman Joe Siedel, a resi
dent of Ujamaa, said he feels
many people who think ethnic
theme houses are exclusionary do
so because of a lack of knowledge.
"I get annoyed when I tell peo
ple I live in Ujamaa, and they usu
ally ask me in a sympathetic tone,
'Oh, how do you like it there?'"
Siedel said. "I wish they would
just come over and check Ujamaa
out and realize that it's just like
any other dorm. The scary thing
for me is that if I hadn't lived in
Ujamaa, I might have been one of
those people myself."

Poll methodology
The Daily poll is based on tele
phone interviews with 127 Stanford
undergraduate students selected ran
domly from the Stanford Directory.
The poll was conducted by paid in
terviewers between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m.
on April 22 through April 25, April 29
and April 30.
The question concerning respon
dents' impression of ethnic theme
houses has a margin of error of ap
proximately 8.3 percent at a 95 per
cent confidence level. The two other
questions have a margin of error of ap
proximately 4.3 percent at a 95 per

theme houses are exclusionary do
so because of a lack of knowledge.
"I get annoyed when I tell peo
ple I live in Ujamaa, and they usu
ally ask me in a sympathetic tone,
'Oh, how do you like it there?'"
Siedel said. "I wish they would
just come over and check Ujamaa
out and realize that it's just like
any other dorm. The scary thing
for me is that if I hadn't lived in
Ujamaa, I might have been one of
those people myself."

Poll methodology
The Daily poll is based on tele
phone interviews with 127 Stanford
undergraduate students selected ran
domly from the Stanford Directory.
The poll was conducted by paid in
terviewers between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m.
on April 22 through April 25, April 29
and April 30.
The question concerning respon
dents' impression of ethnic theme
houses has a margin of error of ap
proximately 8.3 percent at a 95 per
cent confidence level. The two other
questions have a margin of error of ap
proximately 4.3 percent at a 95 per
cent confidence level.
Ethnic theme houses serve a number
of functions at Stanford. For some mi
nority students, they are a home away
from home, offering support and under
standing. Cultural programming pro
vides an opportunity to promote aware
ness among all ethnicities.
Not everyone on campus, however,
agrees with the mission or the outcome
of theme houses. Grouping students to
gether by race can hurt racial relations
on campus, opponents say, claiming a
more evenly spread mixture of students
in all dorms is abetter route to creating
interracial harmony.
A recent Daily telephone poll asked
undergraduate students to categorize
their views on ethnic theme houses on
campus. A majority said they feel the
houses are a good idea overall, but a siz
able minority said they believe the pres
ence of theme houses creates barriers
among races.
Some students and faculty on cam
pus remain unconvinced that theme
houses offer the best answer to creating
a stable and productive relationship
among ethnic groups on campus.
Overall support
When asked if Stanford should have
ethnic theme houses, 76 percent of stu
dents polled supported the idea. Stan
ford currently has four ethnic theme
houses: Casa Zapata, Muwekma-tah
ruk, Okada and Ujamaa.
A total of 127 randomly selected un
dergraduate students participated in
the poll. Of those, 22 were currently liv
ing or had lived in an ethnic theme
house.
Approximately half of the total stu
dents polled said they do not think eth
nic theme houses create barriers among
races, while 41 percent believe they do.
An additional 9 percent said they did not

know enough to properly answer the
question.
Of the respondents who had lived in
an ethnic theme house, six students said
they feel ethnic theme houses were sep
arationist in one form or another.
Forty-six students who had not lived in
a theme dorm also shared this percep
tion.
Students were also asked to rate
their general impression of ethnic
theme houses. Half of the polled stu
dents said their impression was favor
able or strongly favorable; only 15 per
cent reported a negative impression.
Five of the 24 students who gave the
most favorable impression of ethnic
theme houses also said that they were
separatist in some way. In general, how
ever, students who said they had a neg

ative impression were likely to identify
the houses as separatist.
A home open to others
At Stanford, ethnic theme houses
serve a dual purpose. In addition to pro
viding the basic support structure of
any dorm, they are designed to offer cul
tural programming and resources for
both students of the designated ethnici
ty and students of other races.
Approximately half of the residents
of an ethnic theme house represent one
ethnicity. The remainder consists of an
ethnically diverse representation of the
rest of the campus.
Benny Shendo, resident fellow for
Muwekma-tah-ruk, the Native Ameri-


Sothy Chhe — Daily
can theme house, believes that
ethnic houses help expose stu
dents to cultures that they might
not have experienced before.
"We're trying to build a com
munity of scholars and intellectu
als," Shendo said. "Our students
come together and talk together
about what it means to be Native
American or non-Native Ameri
can. Afterwards, we are able to
come together as individuals and
find out who we are."
Ethnic theme houses are also a
haven for minority students, ac
cording to Carl McCants, resident
fellow for Ujamaa, the African-
American theme house.
"Most white students will not
get followed from one building to
another simply because of the
color of their skin," McCants said.
"Most don't have to deal with ex
periences that they got in because
of special admissions policies. In a
theme house, people take you for
who you are and you don't have to
be a spokesperson for that partic
ular ethnicity."
However, some question the
wisdom of having a house devoted
to a single ethnicity, believing it
encourages separation and isola
tion.
"People should be proud of
their ethnicities, and everyone
benefits from the different back
grounds people bring," said sopho
more Julie Johnson, president of
the Stanford College Republicans.
"But first of all, people should be
available for each other, and all of
this sequestering doesn't make
sense. People shouldn't have to be
made more conscious of their race
than they were before."
Freshman Roget Ratchford, a
resident of Ujamaa, also found
fault with the ethnic theme hous
es' method of achieving multicul
turalism.

"It just entices people to stick
to what they've always known,"
Ratchford said. "If you've grown
up with black people or with an
Asian family, you're going to go
where there's the same type of
people. It's not multiculturalism;
it's the same culturalism. If you
want to promote multicultural
ism, just let a dorm be a dorm."
Fitting in
Another debated topic is
whether freshmen who do not
want to live in an ethnic theme
house should be assigned to one
because of their race in order to
encourage diversity.
"The whole quota deal makes
people feel like they have a less of
a choice," said freshman Natalie
Redmond, a resident of the Chi
cano / Latino theme house Casa
Zapata.
"Students are put here because
of their race and that takes away
from the general idea of multicul
turalism and what it's trying to
achieve," Redmond said. "If peo
ple are put here who really don't
want to be here, it just ends up
taking away from the whole at
mosphere of the theme house."
However, attitude plays a large
role in determining how well a
student fits into a theme house,
according to junior Carridine Say,
who has lived in Okada, the
Asian-American theme house, for
three years.
"If your outlook is that it's seg
regationist and you say I'm the
only white person living in a
theme house, you probably will
feel uncomfortable living there,"
Say said. "I think as long as you're
open-minded, the experience will
be good for you."
Okada resident fellow Derek
Miyahara also emphasized the
openness of an ethnic theme
house and the creation of pro
gramming that any student could
participate in, no matter what
their background.
"We don't have the right to

keep anyone out of this place,"
Miyahara said. "So we really can't
be accused of segregation. I prefer
to think of it as the right of people
exercising their right to live
where they want."
"You think of a fraternity,"
Miyahara continued. "For that,
you could select who could be
amongst them. Is that consid
ered separatist and segregation
ist? If someone wanted to live
here, no matter what back
ground they had, we couldn't
prevent them."
Freshman Joe Siedel, a resi
dent of Ujamaa, said he feels
many people who think ethnic
theme houses are exclusionary do
so because of a lack of knowledge.
"I get annoyed when I tell peo
ple I live in Ujamaa, and they usu
ally ask me in a sympathetic tone,
'Oh, how do you like it there?'"
Siedel said. "I wish they would
just come over and check Ujamaa
out and realize that it's just like
any other dorm. The scary thing
for me is that if I hadn't lived in
Ujamaa, I might have been one of
those people myself."
