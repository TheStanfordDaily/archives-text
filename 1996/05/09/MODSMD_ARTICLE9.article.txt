## Shimon Peres gets ready for re-election bid 
### 
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Prime Minister Shimon
Peres' re-election television campaign got under way
yesterday with a baby — gazing up from his crib at
worried parents.
"Can you imagine that in a few years he'll be a sol
dier?" the young mother asks her husband. The baby's
imaginary voice implores the father: "Dad, now's the
time to tell her that by then there will be no more wars.
Why don't you tell her?"
Hut the frowning father says nothing as he picks up
the boy and holds him tight. The mother strokes the
infant's fair hair and a soft female voice is heard say
ing: "On May 29, we will elect the man who makes
peace. On May 29, we will elect Shimon Peres."
Such commercials are about the only way Peres and
his right-wing challenger, Benjamin Netanyahu, will
be able to reach voters en masse for the next three
weeks.
The reason is a 1950s law barring the contenders
from being interviewed or shown on Israeli television
and radio programs during the official campaign period
— an attempt to guarantee opposition candidates a fair
chance to get their message across.
Many see the ban as an embarrassing anachronism
in today's Israel, where nearly everyone has access to
cable television and can watch interviews with Peres
and Netanyahu on CNN and the BBC.
Attempts are made before every election to lift it,
but then shot down by the opposition, which wants to
keep the incumbent from making the most of his office.
"Israel is entering a media blackout... precisely at
the time when the citizens' right to information is most
needed," wrote columnist Zeev Segal in the Haaretz
newspaper. "Israel is making itself a mockery in the
eyes of Western democracies."
But political scientist Michael Keren of Tel Aviv
University said Israelis probably don't mind. "Politi
cians are overexposed, so most people are happy about
it."he said.
