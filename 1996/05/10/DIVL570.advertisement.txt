ambitious Morris, who wants to be a lawyer, rather than the
loyal Sammy, who sells papers and helps put his older brother
through college. Morris, however, is ashamed of his parents,
and when Cominsky arrives at the engagement party for Morris
and his young bride, Morris refuses to acknowledge his own
father. Adding insult to injury, Cominsky also discovers that
Sammy has secredy bccome a prizefighter under the name of
"Battling Rooney" and has taken up with an Irish girl named
Mamie.
