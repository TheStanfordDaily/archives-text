sailor, but the King of Cups promises even
less faithfulness. It's any port In a storm for
your voyaging soul; the good news is that no
one expects any more from you. You may
feel a little weary and sea-sick, but you have
a freedom those land-lubbers will never expe
rience. Take the year off and work on those
commitment skills later In life.
