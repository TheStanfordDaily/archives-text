For some restaurant-goers, the "perfect
place" means innovative cuisine, a
truly inspired kitchen. For others, it is
atmosphere, the refined ambiance of
white linen, unobtrusive yet attentive
service, soft candlelight and roses at
every table. I hese diverse dining
expectations however do not
mandate two separate and distinct
restaurants. May we suggest one:
Campton Place. Elegant to a fault.
Cuisine honored by Food &■ VVine as
"Among the 25 Finest in America."
Seldom do you find such restaurant
excellence behind the swinging door
and such accommodating luxury out
front Power Breakfasts. Lively
luncheons. Sumptuous dinners.
Cocktails and hors d oeuvres that are
themselves specialties ot the house.
For conviviality with savoir laire,
this is the place to be. In an eat-and
run, hit-and-miss dining world, isnt it
reassuring to know that substance
and style still have their Place:
Campton Place. On San Francisco's
Union Square. For reservations,
call (415) 955-5555.
