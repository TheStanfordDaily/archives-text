# Student dies of immune disease
## 
### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
Freshman David Pianko died
yesterday morning at Children's
Hospital in Los Angeles.
Pianko "had a rare autoim
mune disease," said Residence
Dean Andrew Hernandez. "It can
lead to opportunistic infections,"
he added, although he was uncer
tain of the details.
The illness "had something to
do with his pancreas," Hernandez
said. "Then he suffered cardiac
arrest."
Pianko, a resident of Junipero
House, left Stanford at the end of
winter quarter.
"He was just not feeling well,"
said Junipero resident Gretchen
Agee.
According to Hernandez, Pi
anko returned to his hometown
near Los Angeles so that he could
receive treatment. Pianko lived in
Encina, Calif. Hernandez added
that Pianko planned to return to
Stanford in the fall.
Pianko's dormmates said they
were not aware of the seriousness
of his illness. The news of his
death "was a complete surprise to
me," Agee said.
"I'll miss talking to him about
books," Agee said. The two took
an English class during winter
quarter together. Even though
they disagreed on many of the
novels, Agee said she enjoyed
their discussions.
"We talked about everything
else [besides books]," added Ju-
nipero resident Deborah Brown,
describing the content of her fre
quent discussions with Pianko.
Agee and Brown also fondly re
membered his musical tastes. He
was into "music big time," Brown
said. "He loved Prince. He pre
tended to sing [Prince's songs],"
she said.
"He listened to music in the
bathroom," Agee added.
Of all his qualities, Agee said

she will miss his sense of humor
the most. "It's the main thing that
we keep remembering," she said.
"He liked to get a rise out of peo
ple."
Dorm mate Andrew Kraft said
he could not single out any specif
ic memory of Pianko. "I did every
thing with him," Kraft said. "I'll
miss everything."
To help the students through
the grieving process, a house
meeting was held last night, with
representatives from Counseling
and Psychological Services and
Memorial Church in attendance.
A similar meeting was held

when Rinconada freshman
Francesca Beard died recently. "It
was very helpful for people," Her
nandez said.
Pianko's funeral will be held
today at 4 p.m. at Mt. Sinai Ceme
tery in Burbank, Calif. Five of Pi
anko's dormmates plan to attend.
Both Agee and Brown said they
wished more people got to know
him, including residents of their
own dorm.
"He was pretty hard to get to
know," Agee said. "He showed cer
tain sides to certain people."
"He had a hard exterior, but he
was soft inside," Brown said.
