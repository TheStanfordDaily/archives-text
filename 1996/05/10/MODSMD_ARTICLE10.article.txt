## Withdrawal? National party to leave South Africa 
### 
(JAPE TOWN, South Africa
(AP) â€” The party that gave South
Africa apartheid decided yesterday
to withdraw from President Nelson
Mandela's unity government and
try to influence policy as a "vigi
kint" opposition force.
In an announcement that
reflected the deepening maturity of
South Africa's democracy, the
white-led National Party said it
woidd leave the government on
June 30. The announcement came
one day after the Constitutional
Assembly accepted a new constitu
tion.
"The National Party has felt for
some time now that our influence
within the government of national
unity has been declining," said
party leader F.W. de Klerk. He had
expressed concern Wednesday that
the new constitution gave too
much power to the governing
party.
The withdrawal also appeared to
be motivated in part by the Nation
al Party's desire to position itself as
an independent force before the

1999 parliamentary elections.
"We will be able to exercise
greater influence on the economic
policies of the government by pub
licly adopting a vigilant and critical
role than by exercising our dimin
ishing influence within the govern
ment," de Klerk said.
Mandela told a news conference
that unity and reconciliation in
South Africa did not depend on an
enforced coalition and his African
National Congress party had the
confidence to govern alone.
The rand currency took a hit,
but the stability of Mandela's ANC
government was never in question.
The ANC enjoys a comfortable
majority in Parliament and a wide
base of support.
Still, the participation of the
National Party and other minority
parties in the government had been
a stabilizing factor in the transition
from apartheid to democracy. That
participation had been mandated
by South Africa's interim constitu
tion, replaced Wednesday after two
vears of debate.
