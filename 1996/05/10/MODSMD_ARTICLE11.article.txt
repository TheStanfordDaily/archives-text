WASHINGTON (AP) — When postal inspectors came across what
appeared to be a major child pornography operation, they decided it was too
good a chance to pass up. Instead of'just shutting it down, they changed the
name and went into business.
The results of their two-year undercover operation were announced yes
terday: 45 arrests in a nationwide sting, as many as 70 more to come.
"Simply shutting down Overseas Male (the pornography distributor)
wasn't enough because those who created the demand for child pornogra
phy were still out there," Chief Postal Inspector Kenneth J. Hunter said.
Hunter said the investigators concentrated on people who sought videos
involving boys aged 7to 11 — offering the material for sale and bringing
charges if the individuals accepted deliveiy of the videos.
"We are not talking about adult videos someone can rent at some corner
video store," Hunter said.
The videos offered by Overseas Male were "in actuality videotaped evi
dence of a crime taking place. They show images of children having sex with
each other or with adults — children as young as 7, 8 or 9 years old being
sexually abused hi unthinkable ways."
