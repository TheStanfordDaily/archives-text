# President denies Whitewater loan
## 
### 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - In
dramatic video testimony to a
hushed courtroom, President Clin
ton insisted yesterday he had noth
ing to do with a $300,000 loan at
the heart of the criminal case
against his former Whitewater
partners.
"These things are simply not
true," the president said, disputing,
as he always has, the account of the
prosecution's chief witness.
The defense abruptly rested its
case after he testified.
A witness for the defense, Clin
ton was questioned in the White
House on April 28 and the tape was
shown to rapt jurors, some of whom
took notes. He was addressed by
both the prosecutor and defense
attorneys as "Mr. President."
Although Clinton is not charged
in the case, his videotaped appear
ance marked one of few times in
history that a sitting president has
testified in a criminal trial.
And it thrust Clinton into a
criminal case involving issues from
his days as Arkansas governor that
have dogged him since the 1992
political campaign.
In the 10th week of their trial,
James McDougal and Gov. Jim
Guy Tucker are charged with con

spiring to defraud McDougal's sav
ings and loan of nearly $3 million in
government-backed loans in the
mid-1980s, including one to
McDougal's former wife, Susan.
The McDougals are former busi
ness partners of the Clintons;
Tucker is Clinton's successor.
Conspiracy charges against
Susan McDougal were dropped
Monday but she remains charged
with four felony counts accusing
her of misusing a loan.
At the start of his testimony, the
president disputed the testimony of
David Hale, the chief prosecution
witness, who had said Clinton
pushed him to make a $300,000
loan from Hale's federally backed
lending company to Susan McDou
gal in 1986. The loan was never
repaid.
"All I know is that any sugges
tion that I tried to get any money
from him, or I tried to keep that a
secret, or I put any pressure on
him, these things are simply not
true. They didn't happen," Clinton
testified.
Throughout the 2 1/4-hour tape,
the president appeared mostly
relaxed as he related his early polit
ical and business dealings with the
McDougals.
