Gas tax repeal likely
WASHINGTON (AP) - A proposed roll
back of gasoline taxes to help motorists cope
with soaring prices cleared a key House com
mittee yesterday, and Republican leaders said
they expect final action before Memorial Day.
The House Ways and Means Committee
advanced legislation that would suspend the
4.3-cent-a-gallon tax for seven months,
despite warnings by Democratic lawmakers
that oil companies, not consumers, are most
likely to benefit.

Nevertheless, some tax relief for
motorists has been gaining bipartisan sup
port in this election year. The rollback, first
proposed two weeks ago by Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole, the presumptive GOP
presidential nominee, was also embraced
Wednesday by President Clinton.
But Clinton said he would sign the measure
only in tandem with legislation that would
raise the $4.25 minimum wage. Both measures
were stalled in a Senate gridlock, although
Dole scheduled a vote for next Tuesday in
hopes of moving the gas tax bill forward.

Unabomber's cabin moved
LINCOLN, Mont. (AP) - Theodore
Kaczynski's mountain shack has been
moved a short distance and may be flown by
military helicopter to Great Falls, 75 miles
away, to preserve it as evidence and protect
it from scavengers.
George Grotz, FBI spokesman in San Fran
cisco, said yesterday that the cabin was moved
a short distance and placed on skids. He said it
will be moved from the mountain pass within
a few days to a site not yet selected.
