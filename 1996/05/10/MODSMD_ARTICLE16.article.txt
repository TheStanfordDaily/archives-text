## Editorial Grading the graders 
### 
ASSU successfully used
established paths in order
to respond to student needs

The only instructors
with whom many Stanford
students — particularly those
in the early years of their under
graduate careers — have any sort of
personal and direct contact are not
professors but teaching assistants.
TAs, generally graduate students,
perform important duties in many
courses such as leading sections and
grading assignments. Surprisingly,
there has been no recent formal
evaluation of their work. Thanks,
however, to the lobbying of the
ASSU Senate — particularly gradu
ate senator Doug Natelson — and
the cooperation of the faculty, a com
prehensive TA review will soon be
underway.
Natelson, himself a former
physics TA, brought the issue to the
table and pushed the ASSU Senate
to pass a resolution calling for such a
review. He then approached the Fac
ulty Senate — armed with the
ASSU's resolution — and requested
that they consider a comprehensive
analysis of TAs.
The Faculty Senate's Committee
on Academic Achievement and
Appraisal agreed last month to form
a subcommittee to look into the
matter; that subcommittee is cur
rently formulating instructions and
procedures on how to go about
accomplishing a review. TVie last
such review of TAs was performed
nine years ago; prior to that reviews
were undertaken every three or four
years.
According to Physics Prof. Mason
Yearian, who chairs the committee,
"the evaluation will deal with com
paring the effectiveness of TA train
ing by examining various setups in
which teachings assistants per
form." The subcommittee is expect
ed to gather data during summer
and autumn quarters, analyze the

data, form recommendations and
report the full committee by the
beginning of spring quarter 1997.
The committee plans to present its
results to the full senate during that
quarter.
That a review of this type is nec
essaiy and beneficial for undergrad
uate education is unquestionable.
TAs play a crucial role in educating
Stanford students. It is with TAs
that undergraduates have their first
student-instructor experiences and,
in many cases, it is TAs who give the
students their grades.
While some TAs are good teach
ers, genuinely interested both in the
subject matter at hand and in help
ing their students to learn, others
display no passion for either the
material or the process of education.
It is entirely appropriate that the
faculty work to examine and, one
would hope, ultimately improve the
training and abilities of TAs. At the
very least, even if no action is taken
at this time, the University will be
left with a better understanding of
the current situation vis-a-vis TAs.
As important and positive as
this review will be for the Universi
ty, the process by which it has come
into being is equally positive. An
ASSU senator identified an issue
he believed should be addressed,
the ASSU Senate as a whole agreed
with him and the Faculty Senate
followed through on his sugges
tion. At a time when the ASSU
Senate seems largely incapable of
acting as a unified body to advance
students' concerns and the Faculty
Senate seems increasingly uninter
ested in those concerns, it is nice to
see that the process can still work
well.
The events leading to the TA
review are similar to those leading to
last week's announcement that
emergency telephones will be
installed on campus. In both cases,
student representatives and Univer
sity officials were able to follow pre
scribed to achieve successful results.
It's nice to see this happen twice in
such a short period of time; hopeful
ly these issues will not remain
anomalous.
