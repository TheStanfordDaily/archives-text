## People's pride before the fall 
### 
LET'S TALK ABOUT pride for a
moment. I think of pride as a
sense of satisfaction with an effort
which has resulted in some achieve
ment. I have to admit I get a little suspi
cious sometimes when I hear people use
the word. It gets tossed around a lot and
I am uncomfortable with some of its
uses.
I don't have a problem with anyone
who is proud of his or her own accom
plishments. After all, we can be reason
ably sure the person exerted some effort,
significant or otherwise, into achieving
the lofty heights for which he pats him
self on the back. Unfortunately, in this
society, this kind of pride is scorned,
derided as being self-serving; the proud
individual is tugged (sometimes quite
rightly) as self-centered aftd egotistical.
How dare one point out how good one is,
how one has succeeded or excelled (and
thus how the rest of us are not as good)?
Such bad taste.
Naturally, parents are justified in
being proud of their children. After hav
ing invested considerable resources in
getting their offspring to a point where
they can function on their own, mothers
and fathers can argue quite reasonably
that they had a significant hand in help
ing their sons and daughters to whatev
er grand accomplishments are being
bragged about. Society considers this an
appropriate form of pride, and I don't
disagree.

It is also socially acceptable — even
fashionable — to use the word pride in
the context of one's ancestors. I can
understand wanting people to remem
ber the accomplishment of people who
preceded the current generations, but I
don't see how one can take pride in the
accomplishments of people dead and
buried long before one even came along.
I'm talking about the sort of pride which
the dictionary defines as "an overhigh
opinion of oneself," or, more charitably,
"a sense of one's own dignity or worth."
How does one derive a sense of one's
own worth from accomplishments in
which one had no part? You couldn't
possibly have had a hand in their accom
plishments. Hence you have no invest
ment of effort, except perhaps having to
listen to your parents and other rela
tives repeatedly tell you how wonderful
these people were.
Another chic use of the word pride
refers to a group of people totally unre
lated to one except by sharing similar
cultural or ethnic characteristics. Don't
get me wrong — I don't object to being
proud of your heritage, understanding
its value and appreciating its richness
and uniqueness in the panorama of
world cultures. However, it seems to me
that in many cases that is not the senti
ment expressed when one says one has
pride in one's ancestors or culture. I get
the sense that a declaration of one's
importance is being made based on these

factors, the impression that the person
of pride is somehow worth more by
virtue of his ancestors and cultural roots
— with the intent sometimes being that,
by extension, those not in that group are
less worthy.
Let me state again — I don't object to
being aware of one's history, nor m
wanting to share that history's positive
achievements and traditions. But if one
inflates one's sense of worth by virtue of
those accomplishments, if one is at all
consistent, one must run the risk of
deflating that same sense of worth when
less laudable activities by people in the
same group are mentioned. I don't think
one can take credit for the good without
being prepared to at least accept the
existence of, if not responsibility for,
inevitable shameful activities.
What I'd like to see is just a bit more
balance. It's fine to be proud of oneself
and of one's accomplishments. Value
your history and other associations
without coveting them. But also
nize that the history isn't unblemished.
Be careful when you open the door to
the past. The skeletons may come crash
ing down on your head.

Pamela ducked when the skeletons fell
out of her closet and is now counting the
bones.
