ASSU must fulfill its duties to campus publications

TAM WRITING to express my grave
I dissatisfaction with the way this year's
JLaSSU Senate has served student pub
lications. At Tuesday night's meeting, the
senate failed to address the issue of spring
quarter Publications Board discretionary
funding, meaning that three publications
— including the Women's Center's Wom
enspeak magazine, already troubled by
the loss of the Collective's special fee —
won't receive much-needed money at this
time.
The senate was unable to address the

Publication Board allocation because sen
ators left the meeting early. As a result,
the senate lost quorum, meaning that
fewer than 11 of the 40 seats were filled.
Is it too much to expect our elected repre
sentatives to show up — and stay — at
their meetings? In fact, the meeting start
ed 45 minutes late because the senate
didn't have the required 11 members
until then.
This lack of action comes after the sen
ate tabled the winter quarter's discre
tionary funding bill at its final meeting of

last quarter. Since that was the last meet
ing of the quarter, the senate made it
impossible for the Board to distribute any
discretionary funding to publications for
that quarter. The Pub Board provides
funding and technical resources to a com
munity of over 15 campus publications —
publications run by students who have
been growing weary at the lack of respect
and support they have received from the
senate in recent memory.
Although the political arm of the ASSU
seems to spend most of its time dealing

with matters of extreme internal impor
tance such as debating the details of when
they must wear their official sweatshirts
and what types of soft drinks they are
allowed to buy, the body actually does
have an important role as a conduit of
funding to student groups. By failing to
focus on doing its job in favor of partisan,
political gamesmanship, the senate has
once again done all students a disservice.
