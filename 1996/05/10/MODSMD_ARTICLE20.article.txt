Unfortunately, Therese Lee's article
in yesterday's Daily entitled, "What New
World Order?" contains significant
errors in describing my Fulbright Lec
ture Series talk last night.
While Russian democracy may look
different than American democracy, the
chances for the development of democra
cy in Russia are reasonably good; I cited
the emergence of a free press and the
coming elections in June as positive signs.
Regarding the discussion the "DNA of
Russia," I said that nothing precludes
the development of democracy in Russia,
not that Russians are genetically dis
posed against democracy.
Finally, I noted that U.S. military
forces are large and lethal, therefore I
think of them as forces of last resort to
fight regional hegemons and to maintain

the balance of power. They are less
appropriate for peacekeeping. Under no
circumstances did I imply that the U.S.
military should not be involved in world
affairs. I am an "internationalist" and I
strongly believe in an active role for the
United States and its military forces.
