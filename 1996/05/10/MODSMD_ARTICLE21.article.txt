A quote in yesterday's Daily from my
remarks on Wednesday evening at the
Bechtel Center was taken out of context.
I may have used the words "the Chinese
are an evil group of people," but in con
text anyone at my talk would have
known I meant the Communist Chinese
government, not the Chinese people in
general. To anyone who understood the
article to mean otherwise, I sincerely

apologize.
I think the Chinese people are won
derful, wherever they are in the world,
and look forward to the day when all of
them live in freedom.
