# University's decision to cancel EAS illogical
## 
### 
What kind of insanity has beset the
Stanford University administration? I was
absolutely shocked to read that the Uni
versity is considering discontinuing the
bachelor's degree program in East Asian
Studies. I, like dozens of other graduate
students, chose Stanford specifically for
its proximity to the Pacific Rim and its
overall preeminence in East Asian Stud
ies.
Since completing my undergraduate
studies at Princeton University in 1990,

I have spent most of my time in Greater
China and Japan, constantly aware of
the incredible resources and unrivaled
reputation that Stanford boasts
throughout Asia Pacific. How could
Stanford so suddenly abandon its long
running commitment to the world's
fastest growing region? What will the
University be able to say in its defense
when the Asian economy grows to
eclipse that of the western world next
century — "Uh, we didn't have enough
majors." The rest of academia is truly
shocked — Stanford will no longer be
training the best and the brightest to
lead in Asia. Both the silence with which
one of my undergraduate EAS profes
sors at Princeton initially responded to
my news, and his eventual reply — "Do
they plan to get rid of their Computer
Science department too?" — sums up
the preposterous nature of this decision.
