# Allison Amend: The better part of valor
## To sleep, perchance to dream. And I stay awake. 
### 
THEY SAY YOU don't know you've
got a good thing until it's gone, and
boy were they right. Take sleep, a
basic body function. Sure, sometimes you
have too little, but in general, sleep is
something everyone over the age of 10
who knows that you really don't miss any
thing when you're sleeping looks forward
to.
Especially when insomnia strikes.
This is my seventh straight day without
sleep. Well, not without sleep entirely. I
catch a few winks in the afternoon, and I
almost fell asleep driving to dinner the
other night, and the hours of 10 to noon
are usually pretty quiet, but I mean a
good, full-night's sleep.
What am I missing without sleep, I
mean, really? I have to admit, I get a lot
more done. I've written the rest of my
Daily columns for the quarter; I wrote my
thank you notes for graduation gifts I
haven't yet received. I did my nails (fin
gers and toes), plucked my eyebrows, even
removed the hairs from my knee one by
painstaking one.
I watched "Top Gun" â€” only up until
the point where Goose dies, of course, I
didn't want to upset myself. I watched
"Gigi." I watched "The Princess Bride" so
many times even I began to believe the fas

cist plot behind the Prince's machina
tions. I watched "Top Gun" again, and
counted the number of scenes driven by
Tom Cruise's sweaty body (around six,
depending on whether or not you count
the opening sequence). I watched the
entire Fox line-up for the week on tape;
then moved to the Thursday night NBC
comedy slam, I took notes on "Kindred"
and mapped out germ patterns on "Mel
rose Place." I watched a startling expos 6
on the one channel I get reception (Bay
Area Public Access) on the publication of
Nazi brochures in the East Bay.
I hooted with the owls at night (I
watched "Animal House" and pounded
beers with the pledges in the lounge). I
soared with the eagles at dawn (reading
the entire paper with the crew team at a
pre-sunrise breakfast). I finally called my
friends in Asia at a decent time.
1 took myself for a drive like a stubborn
toddler through the faculty ghetto and
counted wisteria-trellises on Frenchman's
Lane. I paced the balcony, then moved to
the basketball court when I received com
plaints.
I looked in the mirror.
You know, don't you, what you con
front in the mirror at 4 a.m., Sleepless at
Stanford, baggy eyes blurred by bereft

tears of frustration? You confront your
inner self, and Oh, the Horror! The Hor
ror!
What is sleep anyway but your brain's
excruciating self-examination? How else
can you explain the bizarre vacuum-clean
er bag potpourri of ideas and images that
pass themselves off as dreams? When your
professor appears as a guest star on "Full
House" (in Japanese) and you feel a
strange embarrassment to be attending
the taping dressed as Robin (as in "Bat
mam and ...") you know your brain is
writing checks from an account your con
scious mind doesn't own.
My own personal theory of sleep is this:
You are doubtless already familiar with
the state between sleep and wakefulness
that categorizes most afternoons during
class. That semi-conscious day-dream
spaciness. Well, I am convinced a similar
state exists between sleep and death, and
that each night is a mental struggle. "Will
I wake up?" you ask yourself, "Or will I
succumb to death's icy claws?"
I went to the doctor to complain about
my lack of rest, and he looked at my
tongue, my ears, hit my knees, poked my
stomach and told me a joke about the
Unabomber. Then he looked at me and
asked, in his best "ER" voice: "Is there

anything wrong?"
Of course there is, I want to say. I got
the frigging referral from Cowell to come
to see you, of course there's something
wrong.
"No," he repeats, "Is there anything
wrong?"
What, other than the fact that I'm
graduating (maybe) and have no job (defi
nitely), no prospects (none), no ideas for a
job (not a one), no date for senior formal
and my mama dresses me funny? But
these are all topics I swore never to write a
column about.
"Why," I ask this smug M.D., "do all
doctors immediately assume, as Freud did,
and erroneously, I might add, that when
their female patients' medical problems
seem undiagnosable, that they must stem
from psychological hysteria?"
He wrote me down the name of a good
therapist and a prescription for Halcyon,
whose very name conjures up images of
the blissful 12-hour evenings of uncon
sciousness that I used to experience. (I'm
sorry, did that seem bitter? Must be the
acidity of the gallons of coffee I've been
drinking that has seeped into my brain).
I got great homeopathic advice as well.
"Milk with honey," suggested someone.
"You're hungry," said my grandmother.

"You eat too much before bed," said my
aunt. "Don't exercise." "Take a walk."
"Eye of Newt." "Newt Gingrich." "A real
ly boring textbook..."
Yet I've learned so much as a creature
of the night. I've made friends with the
House of Bagels deliveiy guy and the men
who steal bikes every morning outside my
residence. I see the sun come up, red and
angry at the daily joggers, the fog lift as
the temperature climbs, the sprinklers,
operating on their own biological rhythms,
swell now with moisture and then grow
silent and dormant again. Will I give up
this New World to surrender to sleep?
There is a peculiar pattern to the witch
ing hours, a brutal, newborn honesty,
whose cries at another dawning day for
which we are vastly unprepared echo in
the empty streets. And the soul-searching
is performed more quickly in the half
light, eyes wide in the full length mirror on
the back of the door. It's just me and Louis
Jordan and Gary Elwes and Tom Cruise
and whoever's guest starring on "Friends"
learning about little girls, or ROUS's or
fighter planes or what we can before the
morning's alarms spoil the silence.
