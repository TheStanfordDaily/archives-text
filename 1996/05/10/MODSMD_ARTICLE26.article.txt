## Stanford decathletes and heptathletes go south to start Pac-10 championships Track team to host the Cardinal Invite 
### Sam Wang Contributing writer 
The Pacific 10 Conference will
commence the 1996 track and
field outdoor championships this
weekend in Los Angeles with the
multi-events competition, and
three Stanford athletes — sopho
mores Josh ( Jleason and Katrinka
Jackson and freshman Tracye
Lawyer — will be in attendance.
In the meantime, their Cardinal
teammates will keep busy by host
ing the Cardinal Invitational at
Cobb Track and Angel 1 Field
tonight.
• The rest of the Pac-10 champi
onships take place next weekend,
also at UCLA.
Gleason currently holds the
second-highest decathlon score in
the Pac-10 this year with a mark
of 0,982. The coaching staff hopes
he'll be able to keep up that kind
of performance this weekend and
put some points up for the Cardi
nal.
"Josh has really done a great
job all year," said head coach Vin
Lananna. "His events have all im
proved drastically. He's much big
ger and stronger than he was last
year. He is a much more poised
and focused competitor."
On the women's side, both
Lawyer and Jackson are also good
bets to place in this weekend's
heptathlon. Coming in as a fresh
man this year, Lawyer had not
competed in a heptathlon since
early in her high school years.
Last month at Mt. San Antonio
College, however — in the only
multi-events competition Stan
ford participated in the entire
year — Lawyer posted the third
highest point total in the Pac-10
this year with an NCAA provi
sional mark of 5,108.
"She seems to be faster and she
seems to be stronger I than she
at the beginningoftheyear],"
Ljmanna said of Lawyer. "All of
Ker marks [at Mt. SAC| were fan
tastic. I think she's well-prepared
a£d I'm sure she will do a great
jab.
* "We hope both Katrinka and
Tfacye will have a shot at scor
ing."
As for the rest of the Stanford
track and field team, they will
host the Cardinal Invitational

tonight in the last home meet of
the season. The competition
headlines numerous Olympic ath
letes, led by decathlete Dan
O'Brien.
Look for the Cardinal to take it
easy after last week's tough loss to
California in Big Meet.
"This weekend will be a tune
up," Lananna said. "It will serve
as a down-time between the Cal-
Stanford dual meet and the Pac
-10s."
The men's competition came
down to the final event of the day
last Saturday at Cal. With the
score tied at 79-79, the Cal 4 x 400
relay team sped by the Cardinal to
win Big Meet for the 25th year in
a row. The women also suffered a
close loss, 83-71. But despite the
difficult defeat, don't expect the
Cardinal to hang its head.
"I don't think it affected the
team's confidence at all," said se
nior team captain Mark Fadil. "If
anything, I think it boosted our
confidence by the overall perfor
mance of the team. We went out
and competed at a higher level
than we have in the past, every
one did what they had to do, and
the cards just didn't fall our way."
The team will need all the con
fidence it can muster as it ap
proaches the Pac-10 champi
onships next week. The men have
already qualified a full comple
ment of 24 athletes, but the
women are still looking to fill
three spots. Qualifying those
three athletes will be one of the
team's primary concerns tonight.
Another subplot in tonight's
competition will concern the se
niors on the team. Ten Cardinal
seniors will be competing for the
final time on their home track.
The women will be losing some
big-time competitors to gradua
tion, including captains Monica
Hoggatt and Dena Dey. Jen
Daulton, Sue Demars, Kay Luo
and Ann Sheehy will also be gone
next year.
As for the men, they will miss
the services of captain Mark
Fadil, John lioldan, David Coller
an and Joe Karlgaard.
These athletes have been inte
gral to the steady improvement of
the Stanford track and field team,
