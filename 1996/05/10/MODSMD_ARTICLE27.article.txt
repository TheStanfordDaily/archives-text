# Water polo goes for national title
## Women will wrap up their first season as varsity sport at U.S. Nationals 
### Erin Bryla Contributing writer 
It all comes down to this for the
Stanford women's water polo team
In its inaugural season as a varsity
sport, the Cardinal has only one

tournament left — the U.S. Nation
als. Stanford will be one ofl2 water
polo teams converging on UC-DavLs
today to vie for the national title.
The fifth-ranked Cardinal will
face Brown today at 2:30 p.m. to
open the weekend. This should be

one of Stanford's easiest games of
the tournament, as Brown is not
ranked among the top 10 in the na
tion. Moreover, Brown hails from
the Eastern Division, which is sig
nificantly weaker then the Card's
tough Western Division.

Nonetheless, freshman goal
keeper Heather Crary warns
against over-confidence. "We defi
nitely cannot overlook them," she
said. "We have to play our hardest.
We can't judge how we play by the
score."
The Cardinal will then face San
Diego State in an attempt to avenge
its overtime loss to the Aztecs in the
consolation match of the qualifier
tournament. Stanford came as close
as they have all season to SDSU in
that game, losing in the final min
utes of a second overtime period
after trading goals with the Aztecs
all game long. Up until that match,
San Diego State had manhandled
the Cardinal this season
"We need to come out hard and
play like we played the last time —
except when time runs out, we will
be ahead," said freshman Lindsay
Tam.
The Cardinal's following game
will be determined by how well it
performs in the openers.
The national tournament is
made up of 12 of the best teams in
the country. Seven teams advanced
from the powerhouse Western Divi
sion, including No. 1-ranked UCLA,
who lost its only game of the season
to third-ranked Cal at the qualifier.
Also coming out of the West will be
UC-Santa Barbara, San Diego
State, UC-San Diego and host UC-

Davis. The other five teams will be
from the midwestern and eastern
qualifiers. Former national champi
on and second-ranked Slippery
Rock hails from thus side of the
bracket.
Although this is a national cham

pionship tournament, the event is
not NCAA-sanctioned. Women's
water polo falls two teams short of
the 20 necessary to become an
NCAA sport.
Stanford will look to its youth to
guide it through the tournament.
Freshman Lindsay Welsh is an inte
gral part of the offense and will be
looked to for her scoring prowess.
The Cardinal will also count on
hole-set Tarn, who has been slowlv

improvingall season, to find the net.
As always, the team will be led
defensively by Crary, who has been
phenomenal in goal all season. How
ever, the Cardinal women don't rely
entirely on youth — junior captain
Alice Cathcart and junior Olivia
White will lead the team and play
strong defense.
"I just want to pull together be
cause it is our last weekend,"
Crary said.
