# Baseball tunes up for postseason play
## No. 9 Cardinal will close regular season with three non-conference games 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
With a second-place finish in the Six-Pac
wrapped up last weekend thanks to a three-game
sweep of California, the No. 9-ranked Stanford
baseball team will prep itself for NCAA regional
play by facing several non-conference opponents
over the next five days. The Cardinal (37-17 over
all, 19-11 Six-Pac) next mixes it up with Division
11 foe UC-Davis (31-20, 21-11 Northern Califor
nia Athletic Conference) at 1 p.m. Sunday at
Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal has continued its hot play of late
while putting together the second-longest win
ning streak in Stanford history. Sunday, coach
Mark Marquess' squad will vie for its 15th con
secutive victoiy, which would tie the school
record set in 1990. The current streak began im
mediately following three consecutive losses to
Six-Pac champion USC in Los Angeles April 12-
14. After that series, the Cardinal reeled off nine
straight conference wins to catch and overtake

UCLA for second place in the league.
Stanford's recent success has been the result
of outstanding team performances. Marquess
has received consistent outings from all of his
starting pitchers and solid innings from his
bullpen.
At the plate, the Cardinal has been on a tear,

'We can't say enough about
the hitting. We know they're
going to put up some runs.'
— Brendan Sullivan

led by catcher A.J. Hinch (.404 batting average,
11 home runs, 54 runs batted in), first baseman
Luke Quaccia (.393) and right fielder Joe Kilburg
(.367, 5 HR, 38 RBIs). Senior third baseman
Troy Kent has also swung a hot stick as of late,
bombing six home runs in his last 10 games.
Kent (9 HR, 31 RBIs) and sophomore designated

hitter Jon Schaeffer (11 HR, 42 RBIs) have pro
vided the power that was a question mark for the
Cardinal entering the 1996 campaign.
Also contributing at the plate are senior sec
ond baseman Brian Dallimore (.322, 37 RBIs)
and freshman center fielder Jody Gerut (.317,5
HR, 41 RBIs).
"We can't say enough about the hitting," said
Brendan Sullivan, the winning pitcher in Stan
ford's 11-2 thumping of Saint Mary's on
Wednesday night. "We know they're going to put
up some runs, so when we give up a run or two
early, we know that if we buckle down and pitch
well, we'll be okay."
Last Sunday against rival Cal, the Cardinal
enjoyed its biggest comeback win of the year, bat
tling back from a 7-2 deficit to crush the Golden
Bears by a score of 14-7. Stanford enjoyed an
eight-run seventh inning, capped by a three-run
Schaefier blast over the center field fence. The
emotional victory was a good indication to Mar-
quess and Cardinal fans that this
squad will be ready for any situation
in the NCAA Regional Tournament
in two weeks.
Sunday, Marquess will send
right hander Jeff Austin (5-3) to the
mound to face the Aggies, who are
currently in second place in the
NCAC, trailing Chico State by two
games. Austin, who has been im
pressive in his first year of collegiate
competition, struggled in the mid
dle of the season, but has rebounded
with several consecutive strong out
ings. The freshman has posted a
3.90 earned run average while strik
ing out 81 batters in 80 2/3 innings
pitched.
Davis may be without leading
hitter Dave Nix when it faces Stan
ford this weekend. The senior is hit
ting .361 with a team-leading total
of 37 RBIs in 1996. Sophomore
catcher Greg Carlson recently re
ceived NCAC Player of the Week
honors after going 6-for-7 with two
doubles in a doubleheader sweep of
Stanislaus last Saturday.
Sunday's game will be the Cardi
nal's last chance to make an impres
sion on the NCAA selection com
mittee in its bid to host a regional
tournament May 23-26 at Sunken
Diamond. The eight regional sites
will be announced by the NCAA on
Monday.
