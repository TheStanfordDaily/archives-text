# Jim Thomas plays the waiting game
## As first alternate for NCAA singles tournament, senior only able to watch and wait 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
When the field for the 1996 NCAA Men's Ten
nis Individual Championships was announced last
week, the most notable name missing from the list
of 64 players was Stanford's 51st-ranked Jim
Thomas.
The senior, who has never been invited to com
pete in the individual championships, neverthe
less has a fighting chance at playing in the year
end tournament: he was named as the first alter
nate. Should someone Ix; unable to accept their in
vitation (see related article on page 8), Thomas will
finally get his shot.
But for now, Thomas must play the waiting
game — no small task according to assistant coach
John Whitlinger. "This won't l>e easy on Jim," he
said. "He will have to be ready and on call to play
up until the very last second."
In a way, it's only fitting that the Cardinal's
most methodical and delilxrate player should
round out his collegiate career wait ingon someone
else for a change.
"Jim seems to always keep us waiting —
whether it's tying his shoes, preparing for the
match, or getting through with his match,"
Whitlinger says. "Jim even made us wait until the
very last minute before calling to say he had cho
sen to attend Stanford."
The native of Canton, Ohio, claims he came to
Stanford over Notre Dame "for academics, to win
a team title, and to practice day in and day out with
great players."
But there was much more to Thomas' choice.
At a team dinner just prior to the start of the
1994 NCAA championships in South Bend, Ind.,
Fighting Irish football coach Lou Holtz ap
proached the Stanford table and asked, "Which
one of you is Jim Thomas?"
Unbeknownst to Thomas' teammates, Holtz
was a friend of the Thomas family — in fact,
Thomas says, "Legend has it Holtz proposed to my
aunt during their college days in Akron, Ohio."
After Thomas identified himself, Holtz ad
dressed him: "I hear you visited Notre Dame, but
you chose to attend Stanford instead."
When spouted from the lips of a man as feared
and respected as Holtz, even these most good-na-

tured of remarks would intimidate
most 19-year-old men. Not Jim
Thomas.
"If I would have met you then,
maybe it would have been different,"
Thomas deadpanned.
Stanford head coach Dick Gould
says he's glad Holtz didn't stop by
during Thomas' recruiting trip. "We
would have had to have called in Bill
Walsh."
Gould has good reason to be glad.
As a four-year starter for the Cardi
nal, Thomas has amassed a 92-26
record, including a 61-10 mark in
dual matches. One of those victories
came in what has been described as
one of the most exciting collegiate
matches ever played, a match-de
ciding victory over UCLA's Matt
Breen after both players had five
match points apiece. That victory
preserved the 1995 Cardinal's un
defeated record and helped propel
the team to a national champi
onship.
This year, Thomas leads the
team with an 18-3 record despite
shuffling between the Nos. 2,3, and
4 singles positions. And the steady
improvement he has made through
hard work on and off the court has
won him the respect of his coaches
and teammates.
"Whether it's footwork, condi
tioning, or nutrition, Jim is always
looking for ways to get better,"
Whitlinger says.
Or as fellow senior Ricky Becker
puts it, "Jim relies on the strength
trainer more than anyone else on the
team, and he also lives in the train
ing room. And it takes him two
hours to warm up."
It is no surprise that those in the
know think Thomas deserves better
than a first-alternate selection, even
though the selections are based on
regional rather than national seed
ings, meaning that lesser players

from regions lacking in talent are
sometimes invited over stronger
players from talented regions.
"There is no doubt Jim deserves
to be there," Becker says, "even with
the warped system that the NCAA
operates. I guess they don't want
four players from the same team in
the tournament. [Jeff Salzenstein,
Ryan Wolters and Paul Goldstein all
qualified. ] It seems like the format is
such that many of the bad teams can
get a player or two in at the expense
of making it a good tournament.
What the organizers need to do is
take a good look at themselves in the
mirror."
Only once in Stanford's history
has it been represented by four play

ers in the same NCAA champi
onships. Those guys had names like
David Wheaton, Patrick McEnroe,
JeffTarango and Martin Blackman.
Still, Whidinger says this could
be the year Stanford again sends
four players. "Jimmy's got a great
chance. All somebody's got to do is
get sick or get hurt." Whitlinger
thinks that California's Michael
Hill, who has sat out several match
es this year due to a shoulder injury,
is a likely candidate for dropping out
of the event.
And if no slot opens up for
Thomas?
"It's tough luck," Thomas says.
"It will just mean my teammates
were too good."
