# Jim Thomas plays the waiting game
## As first alternate for NCAA singles tournament, senior only able to watch and wait 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
When the field for the 1996 NCAA Men's Ten
nis Individual Championships was announced last
week, the most notable name missing from the list
of 64 players was Stanford's 51st-ranked Jim
Thomas.
The senior, who has never been invited to com

one of you is Jim Thomas?"
Unbeknownst to Thomas' teammates, Holtz
was a friend of the Thomas family — in fact,
Thomas says, "Legend has it Holtz proposed to my
aunt during their college days in Akron, Ohio."
After Thomas identified himself, Holtz ad

you chose to attend Stanford instead."
When spouted from the lips of a man as feared
