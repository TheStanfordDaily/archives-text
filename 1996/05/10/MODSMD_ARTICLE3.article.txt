# Hillel discusses executive changes
## Students ask for larger role in process at town hall meeting 
### David Stein Contributing writer 
Confronted with sweeping changes to
its executive staff next year, Stanford
Hillel held a town meeting last night to
discuss the future direction of the Uni
versity's main Jewish organization.
In front of about 30 people, members
of the Hillel board of directors gathered
opinions from interested students and

community members on how best to fill
the four staff positions that will soon be
vacated, one of which is executive direc
tor, which for 20 years has been filled by
Rabbi Ari Cartun.
According to the board's president,
Robin Kennedy, three or so applicants
for an interim director position are cur
rently being considered.
Although Hillel began the director
search late, Kennedy said Stanford has

been so attractive to qualified candidates
that "those unwilling to go just anywhere
will be willing to go here."
In response to discussions of the selec
tion process, students stressed the im
portance of finding a director who is not
merely an administrator, but also a reli
gious leader.
"I want someone who's going to en-
gage students, someone who will
empower them," senior Tamara
Levadi said. "We need someone
who will promote some sort of re
lationships."
Board member Norm Robinson
said the new Hillel leader should
advance a "vibrant, challenging,
intellectual Jewish life on campus.
This person should create, sustain
and then let this life grow."
Other students said a rabbini
cal director would be needed to
make students feel comfortable
during the High Holiday season,
which normally occurs during the
first week of fall quarter. Levadi
added that a rabbi would provide
for a "positive, open atmos
phere."
In addition, the board attempt
ed to increase communication be

tween itself and the rest of the
Jewish community.
"Stanford students have told
me in the past that they don't un
derstand what [the board does],"
Kennedy said. "We wanted to
come all together in one place
tonight to let them know that our
primary concerns are their prima
ry concerns."
Students said they would like
more contact with the board, ei
ther in the form of informal meet
ings or over the World Wide Web.
They also said they would like to
meet with the six student mem
bers of the board on a more fre
quent basis.
"Students had a lot of ques
tions about what's in store for Hil
lel's future," said Seth Yoskowitz,
board member and newly elected
president of the Jewish Student
Association. "Tonight, we wanted
students to have as much knowl
edge as possible to give them a step
up with active leadership."
