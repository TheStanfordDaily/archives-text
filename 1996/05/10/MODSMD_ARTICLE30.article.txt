# Rediscovering the innocence of sports — at a tee-ball game
## 
### 
With two hits already
under his belt, the batter
walked easily up to the
plate with a 3-for-3 afternoon on
his mind.
But then again, everybody had
a 3-for-3 game. The batter, my 5-
year-old cousin Payton Robinson,
plays on a tee-ball little league
team where everybody bats each
inning, there's no outs, no score
and the last person to bat always
hits a home run to clear the bases.
Payton's dad Dan, the coach of
the (not so) Giants, and his mom
Kris deftly handle the lineup of 11
rookies, familiarizing them with
the absolute basics of baseball and
sportsmanship — try hard and
have fun.
Every player is out in the field
on defense, along with assorted
moms and dads, creating a jum
bled mass of infielders and out
fielders. Should the ball make it
through the web of little hands
and feet past the semicircle of
cones marking the limits of the
outfield, the slugger earns a
ground-rule double.
But parallels do exist. The Gi
ants' leadoff batter beats out a
dribbler down the first base line
just like Brett Butler. Payton's
two practice swings and batting
prowess call to mind a young Al
bert Belle (minus the temper, of
course). One of the "pitchers"
plays an entire inning with his fin
gers in his mouth, most likely get
ting an early start at mastering
the spitball.
There's even the young
prospect everyone has already
ticketed for the big time. Miles, an
energetic, outgoing boy with base
ball pants made especially for him
by his grandmother, has the in
stincts of a boy twice his age.
Jumping out of his defensive
crouch at every hit ball no matter
where it's heading, his mind is fo

cused on the game. Kris says she
thinks he'll be the first one to
catch a ball in the air.
Which is saying something, as
several players struggle through
tantrums in the field (young Billy
Martins, perhaps?) while others
just take a seat in the middle of the
infield and gaze off into space.
"One time I caught the third
basemen doing somersaults," Kris
tells me.

Considering some professional
athletes, maybe that's not such a
bad idea. If a player is angry at an
umpire or himself, make him do a
couple forward tucks to shake out
the anger. Nobody can stay mad
when they're rolling around in the
grass on a sunny day.
Each game lasts three innings
or one hour, whichever comes
first. For most of these diminutive
diamond dwellers, the attention
span starts to wane about two in
nings into the game as the thrill of
throwing grass and grabbing each
others' hats becomes more imme
diate than waiting his or her turn
at bat.
After the game ends and the
traditional "two, four, six, eight,
who-do-we-appreciate" cheer is
sounded, the children once again
erupt into action as the snacks (for
this game, crackers and Hi-C) are
distributed.
"Get out of the way of the


Greg
Collins
snacks or you'll get killed," Pay
ton's grandfather Ralph says,
which could also be said of major
leaguers looking to drown their 0-
for-5 days with a cold beer and the
buffet spread.
Like in the majors, every kid
has a different interest level in the
sport. Some players are more con
cerned with what their agent (or

"mommy ) tells them, while oth
ers are out there for the sheer en
joyment of the game.
Payton tells me he wears Barry
Bonds' old number, a reflection
both on his interest and his par
ents' love of the game.
Miles, a little upset about not
hitting his second double of the
game, gets some consolation from
Kris.
"You can't hit a double every
time — not even Barry Bonds does
that," she says.
"I know. Did vou see that line

drive home run he hit?"
This is the true beginning of
sport. Idyllic, natural, protected
for now from social forces that
have begun to change the world of
"play" into something drained of
the essence of the game — fun.
These kids don't know about
salary arbitration, hold-outs,
owners moving teams, the lure
of drugs and the loss of inno
cence that will invariably come
when the hero is no longer hero
ic. But for now, all they know is
the game.
