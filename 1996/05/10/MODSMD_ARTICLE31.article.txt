# Top 10 ways for Jim Thomas to make NCAA singles draw
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
Any number of wacky occur
rences could lead to Jim Thomas
getting the call to play as first al
ternate in the NCAA Men's Ten
nis Individual Championships.
Here are just a few:
1. Thomas' disgruntled girl
friend, Jennifer Gillooly, uses a
crowbar to attack the knees of one
of the 64 scheduled players.
2. Using ball or racket, Thomas
"accidentally" hits doubles part
ner and scheduled player Paul
Goldstein in the head during a
heated doubles point.
3. One of the many Stanford
alumni who serve as Georgia
State troopers pulls over and tick
ets a scheduled player on the day
of the match, thus causing the
player to arrive late.
4. Thomas' mother, dressed as a
Georgia State trooper, pulls over
and tickets a scheduled player.

5. A scheduled player withdraws
due to a bothersome fungus of the
skin caused by Georgia's heat.
6. A scheduled UCLA player
withdraws due to a bothersome
fungus of the skin brought on by
his dark blue shorts worn in the
Georgia sun.
7. A foreign player scheduled to
play instead chooses to play over
seas in an illegal money event.
8. A hot-headed player, possibly a
foreigner, has a confrontation
with his coach during the team
event subsequent to the individ
ual event, thus leading to the
player's withdrawal.
9. A scheduled player gets trashed
after winning the team event,
then fails to wake up for his
match the next morning.
10. This writer's prediction: A
sprained ankle due to careless
body mechanics in the Georgia
heat leads a scheduled player to
withdraw. (If 20 of these occur,
the Cardinal could land five or six
players in the draw.)
