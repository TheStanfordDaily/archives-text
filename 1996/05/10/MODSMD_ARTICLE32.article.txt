# Volunteers in Asia lets students live and serve abroad
## 
### Lewis Lin Contributing writer 
In English, via means
"through" or "by way of." In Span
ish, via means "road." But at Stan
ford, VTA stands for Volunteers in
Asia, a service organization dedi
cated to providing Asian countries
with volunteer assistance and pro
viding Stanford students with a
first-band experience in a very dif
ferent culture.
One of the most exciting devel
opments this year for Volunteers
in Asia, which has its headquarters
in the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice, has been receiving the Henry
Luce Foundation grant. In Decem
ber 1995, the service organization
received a $60,000 grant from the
Luce Foundation, specifically ear
marked for the organization's pro
grams in Vietnam and Laos.
"This grant is significant in two
ways for lour organization]. It's a
huge boost for our fund raising,
and it's 10 percent of our entire
budget and a little over 20 percent
of our Vietnam and Laos pro
grams," said Cliff Chan, executive
director of Volunteers in Asia.
The Luce Foundation has al
ways taken a great interest in
Asian programs, said Chan. Dedi
cated to Henry Luce's parents,
who were educational missionaries
in China, the national foundation
gives grants and awards to organi
zations and individuals whose pro
jects support research, cultural
and scholarly exchange to increase
American understanding of the
Asia-Pacific region. In addition,
the foundation supports opportu
nities for women in science, Amer
ican art, public affairs and higher

education in Asia, especially in
China.
Volunteers in Asia was founded
in 1963 by current president
Dwight Clark, who was then Stan
ford's dean of freshman men. The
organization began when a group
of highly motivated, service-ori
ented students, led by Clark, an
swered a request from World Uni
versity Service for volunteers to
work in Hong Kong. Ever since,
the organization has volunteered
in various Asian countries, includ
ing China, Thailand, Indonesia,
Vietnam and Laos.
The group of students who are
chosen for the Volunteers in Asia
program usually teach English at
local universities or community or
ganizations in the host country,
said Chan. But in the afternoons
and in the evenings, the students
moonlight as typical tourists —
fighting off taxi drivers, visiting
cultural centers and haggling with
local vendors.
Several Volunteers in Asia pro
grams are available to students.
Undergraduates may spend two
months of their summer vacation
in Vietnam, China or Twain for
$ 1,350, or they may spend a year in
Indonesia or Thailand for $1,500.
Graduating seniors may also
choose to participate in the pro
gram for one to two years in In
donesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam
or China at a cost of $950. All costs,
which are usually less than the
price of airfare, include training
sessions, insurance, airfare, living
stipends and travel expenses.
Out of all the programs, Chan
is most excited about the organi
zation's new programs in Viet
nam and Laos, which benefit

from the Luce grant.
"We entered Vietnam in 1990,
when it was very hard to do any
thing with them. Now that rela
tions between the U.S. and Viet
nam are getting better, Viet
namese are very eager [for] more
contact with tbe West. For that
kind of development to occur, Eng
lish is a crucial language," said
Chan.
Chan said Stanford students do
not only give to these foreign coun
tries — they also receive. "We see
ourselves giving students a first
hand experience, first-hand
knowledge of a part of the world.
They are able to use that informa
tion no matter what field they will
be working in," said Chan.
Janhabi Nandy, a junior major
ing in economics, spent last sum
mer in Hanoi as part of Volunteers
in Asia.
"I was teaching an English flu
ency class at a university," said
Nandy. "I taught people who were
my age. In the beginning, we were
trying to get used to each other.
Trying to relate, trying to figure
out their skills, etc.
"Near the end of the week, we
sat around in a circle, and we had
an informal discussion on family
and family structure in Vietnam
and America in comparison. We
discussed dating, interracial is
sues. It was neat because it was a
classroom activity, but they were
less conscious about their lan
guage and cultural barriers."
In addition to exploring other
cultures, some students also have
been able to explore their own cul
tural backgrounds.
"We have a number of Viet
namese who go back to Vietnam

every year," said Chan. "There is
still a lot of distrust among Viet
namese Americans of the Viet
namese government. But they are
finding their roots, going back to a
country they've heard only horri
ble tales about and breaking down
stereotypes of Vietnamese Ameri
cans as wealthy, spoiled, arrogant
and unpatriotic. They are building
bridges and opening the ways of
co m m un i cati on."

The outbound program ac
counts for only half of Volunteers
in Asia programs. The other pro
gram is the Trans-Pacific Ex
change, a program designed to in
troduce overseas Asian students to
American issues and culture. Each
year, 40 Stanford students are in
volved in coordinating this short
term intensive program.
Although program participants
have already been selected for the

upcoming summer and next year
Chan encouraged all Stanford stu
dents to apply for Volunteers ir
Asia programs in the future.
"We're looking for enthusias
tic, curious people. We're not ex
actly looking for deep expertise
We're looking to give people deep
first exposure fto Asia]. Students
have come back, and they applj
their experiences to their studies,'
said Chan.
