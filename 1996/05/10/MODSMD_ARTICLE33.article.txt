## 30,000 expected to attend weekend celebration of Native-American culture 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Thirty thousand people are expected to ar
rive at Stanford today for a weekend of dancing
and celebration courtesy of the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization.
The 25th annual Stanford Powwow, which is
the biggest event of its kind on the West Coast,
will begin with a ceremonial introduction and
prayers tonight. Among the activities planned
for the rest of the weekend are traditional Na
tive-American dances and a five-kilometer run
Saturday morning
Education graduate student Tim Sanchez,
who is co-coordinator of the event, said Native
Americans and non-Native Americans alike are
welcome at the events.
"It's not only for the Indian community, it's
also for the Stanford community," Sanchez
said. "It's a time to learn about each other and

respect each other's cultures."
Sanchez said the Powwow "helps us to
strengthen our Indian identity."
"We're considered the invisible people of
color, and our issues are not addressed," he said.
The Powwow, Sanchez said, is organized en
tirely by SAIO in cooperation with the American
Indian Program Office.
Sophomore Mike Attocknie, who chairs two
organizing committees, said powwows are cele
brated by Native-American communities all
over the country throughout the year, but Stan
ford's is one of the biggest, along with others like
the Schemitzun in Connecticut and the Gather
ing of the Nations in Albuquerque, N.M.
Attocknie said music for the dancing will be
provided by several touring bands who travel to
powwows all over the nation competing for prize
money.
Among the traditional dances, Sanchez said
there will be a gourd dance to honor veterans of

foreign wars and "recognize their service to the
Indian community and also to the non-Indian
community."
Another important part of the Stanford Pow
wow is hosting prominent guests from the Na
tive-American community.
"We try to get speakers who are well-known
in the Indian country, but not necessarily in the
whole country," Attocknie said.
This year's guests will be two activists, Suzan
Haijo, a poet, and Floyd Westerman, an actor
and singer who will perform some of his songs.
Sanchez said the event took the whole year to
plan. He said about 50 student volunteers have
been working "out of respect and love for our In
dian culture." The Powwow and other fund-rais
ing events are used to sponsor several student
associations, bring in speakers and fund a "re
tention program" which seeks to combat the
high dropout rate among Native-American stu
dents.
