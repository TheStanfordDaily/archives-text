# A
						lesson in Drawing
## 
### 
Doors get slammed in your face. The din
ing hall is full of clandestine meetings,
each table more hushed than the next.
Lists are compared and people are shunned. It
is that time of year again.
The Draw is upon us.
Regressions are run calculating the proba
bility of four sophomore girls getting two-room
doubles m Xanadu, assuming last year's Draw
numbers and population stay constant. The
pinkness of Stern is cross-referenced with the
desirability to be near Sweet Hall minus the
tiny rooms and ugly windows plus the proxim
ity of Late Night Power Macs chug away end
lessly computing the effects of Kairos' Capital
Improvement vs. its general unsanitary condi
tions and its unfortunate location beside the
Deke House. R-squares are analyzed and deci
sions are made.
The math isn't the only thing that gets
crazy this time of year it's the social posi
tioning as well. Now is the time to pick your
friends and alert your enemies. Find that guy
with the huge TV and the girl with the cute
friends and collect them into one nice and tidy
Draw group. Keep the annoying couple out and
make sure the obnoxious guy from the end of
tin- hall doesn't find out the group's password.
Remember: The decisions made for the
1996-1997 Undergraduate Housing Draw will
determine your social surroundings for your
four years at Stanford University! The stakes
are high! Ifyou end up in the same Draw group
with certain unnamed social misfits, you are on
your way down the deadly spiral of social dis
aster!
Realize that this decision is not just limited
to where you live; it ultimately affects your
identity as well. You are no longer Jane Q.

Stanford you are now a member of the Draw
group "Bowling4ss" (no space) with password
"bitemel" (all lowercase). For the rest of your
Stanford experience, seven people will refer to
you as their Drawmate, even if you never liked
them in the first place. You are no longer that
energetic valedictorian with a penchant for
poetry and line foods from Dayton, Ohio you
are now "my Drawmate from Dayton, Ohio."
Once you have picked your social equals and
assembled them under one moniker, there is
still the ever-important issue of Draw card
strategy. Slotting a zillion houses carefully into
eight spots takes intense strategic planning.
How many Row Houses is too optimistic? How
many "safety spots" in Cowell Cluster or
Wilbur is too scary? The trick is to carefully
balance all housing opt ions, meanwhile making
sure that you don't get screwed.
Unfortunately, with all the Capital Improve
ment that's been going around, the Draw card
just isn't as much fun as it used to be. When
someone Draws "preferred into Stern because
they screwed up the math, it just isn't as funny
anymore. The only horrible place left on cam
pus is Mirlo and they get ice cream every day.
Mirlo sucks, though, doesn't it?
So once the numbers are in and "Bowl
ing4ss" has submitted that final Draw card it
is time to wait. And wait and wait and wait.
Because, in the era of supercomputers that can
make 120 million calculations per second, it
still takes three weeks for them to sort out
8,000 Draw entries. That 's University Housing
for you.
Once the last Draw card beams itself across
the information superhighway come midnight
Sunday, our fates will hang in the balance of a
few random variables and reiterated algo

rithms. We are at the mercy of the winds of
chance, and, of course, the hundreds of (,'S
majors staying up day and night trying to
hreak into the "fool-proof" 1 computer Draw sys
tem. My guess is that they can do it, and proh
ahly pretty easily, too. So, I've come to a con
clusion: I've decided that no one is more
responsible for those lousy numbers we're
gonna Draw than we are. Because if we hail
spent the last few weeks brushing up on our
hacking skills instead of re-enacting the inane
popularity contests of junior high, we'd know
our futures for certain come Monday.
So, please: Don't be taken in by the propa
ganda. And please don't take the Draw too seri
ously. It may determine who lives around the
corner from you next year, but since Stern got
its new paint job, it really is just a formality.
Don't exclude that girl from down the hall
just because she is part of "2Legit2Quit (no
space) with password "biteme2" (all lower
case); exclude her because she gets on your
nerves. Or exclude her because she makes out
with her boyfriend outside your door at 4 in the
morning. Or exclude her because she takes
showers only twice a week and she doesn't
believe in soap. But don't let the Draw be an
excuse for anything.
Unless you get stuck in Mirlo. Then use
whatever excuse you can think of. 'Cause you
LTot screwed. Mirlo sucks.
