# Consuls-general speak on Middle East peace
## 
### Richard Engel Contributing writer 
Often seeming like two rival
lions, each watching and occasion
ally testing the other, the official
voices of Egypt and Israel debated
the Middle East peace process last
night.
The debate, sponsored by the
ASSU Speakers Bureau and the
Stanford Israel Alliance, provided a
forum for the Israeli Consul-Gener
al Nimrod Barkan and the Egypt
ian Consul-General Hagal El Is
lambouly to discuss hot political
topics such as the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon, the rise of Muslim funda
mentalism, Palestine and the Is
raeli occupied territories.
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, who moderated the
event, began by expressing hope
that the evening would prove to be a
free and open exchange of ideas.
"A role of the University is to
present important, complex and
contentious issues in a context
where they can be freely ex
pressed," he said.
What followed, however, was a
presentation of official explana
tions, criticism and hopes for the fu
ture of the Middle East
Barkan was the first to present
the Israeli point of view

The official voices clashed direct
ly only once during the two-hour
discussion. Fielding a question
from the audience about the U.N.
sanctions against Iraq, Islambouly
seemed to surprise Barkan when
she explained that Egypt favors the
removal of sanctions against Iraq.
"I hope I misunderstood you,"
Barkan said, "because I am deeply
disturbed by your statement that
the Egyptian government believes
that sanctions should be removed
from Iraq before resolutions have
been complied with."
Islambouly explained that the
sanctions unjustly punish the Iraqi
people.
Barkan discussed the Middle
East in general terms and explained
that the United States' involve
ment in the region, demographic
changes in Arab nations and the
rise of "political Islam" are the
factors that have determined
Israel's position in the Middle East.
"First and foremost, what is
shaping the Middle East is the de
mographic growth and the general
unhappiness because of social and
economic problems," he said.
Barkan explained that the in
ability of Arab states to deal with
the pressures of rapid population
growth has both economic and po
litical consequences. Arab youth, he
said, are finding a solution to social
disillusionment in Islam.
"The rise of fundamentalism,
which is a problem," he said, "has
become the most important politi
cal and social problem in the Middle
East."
Barkan said the peace process
has succeeded partially because
fundamentalism has drawn atten
tion away from Israel as the major
enemy of the Arab states since fun
damentalists present a threat to the
Arab states' own secular govern
ments.
With a tone less scientific than
Barkan's, Islambouly couched her
discussion in more patriotic
terms. She expounded that "vi
sionary" Egyptian leaders like ex

'We have vision, and
we believe in the
creation of a strong
core in the Middle
East. 7
— Hagal El Islambouly

President Anwar Sadat have been
interested in the peace process for
a long time.
"We are still the driving force for
peace," she said. "We have vision,
and we believe in the creation of a
strong core in the Middle East.
Today is a continuation of what
went on in the 1970s and 19805.'
Islambouly stressed that the way
to peace is through the continuation
of joint economic programs between
Arab and non-Arab nations.
