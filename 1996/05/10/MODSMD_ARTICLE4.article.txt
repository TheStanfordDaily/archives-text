# Consuls-general speak on Middle East peace
## 
### Richard Engel Contributing writer 
Often seeming like two rival
lions, each watching and occasion
ally testing the other, the official
voices of Egypt and Israel debated
the Middle East peace process last
night.
The debate, sponsored by the
ASSU Speakers Bureau and the
Stanford Israel Alliance, provided a
forum for the Israeli Consul-Gener
al Nimrod Barkan and the Egypt
ian Consul-General Hagal El Is
lambouly to discuss hot political
topics such as the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon, the rise of Muslim funda
mentalism, Palestine and the Is
raeli occupied territories.
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy, who moderated the
event, began by expressing hope
that the evening would prove to be a
free and open exchange of ideas.
"A role of the University is to
present important, complex and
contentious issues in a context
where they can be freely ex
pressed," he said.
What followed, however, was a
presentation of official explana

Barkan was the first to present
the Israeli point of view

The official voices clashed direct
ly only once during the two-hour
discussion. Fielding a question
from the audience about the U.N.
sanctions against Iraq, Islambouly
seemed to surprise Barkan when
she explained that Egypt favors the
removal of sanctions against Iraq.
"I hope I misunderstood you,"
Barkan said, "because I am deeply
disturbed by your statement that
the Egyptian government believes
that sanctions should be removed
from Iraq before resolutions have
been complied with."
Islambouly explained that the
sanctions unjustly punish the Iraqi
people.
Barkan discussed the Middle
East in general terms and explained
that the United States' involve
ment in the region, demographic
changes in Arab nations and the
rise of "political Islam" are the
factors that have determined
Israel's position in the Middle East.
"First and foremost, what is
shaping the Middle East is the de
mographic growth and the general
unhappiness because of social and
economic problems," he said.
Barkan explained that the in
ability of Arab states to deal with
the pressures of rapid population
