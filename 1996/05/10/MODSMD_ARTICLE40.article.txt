# Fleet Street show goes digital
## A 						cappella group blends computer-animated movie into its act 
### Bobby Chen Staff writer 
Stanford's Fleet Street Singers will open their an
nual spring show with a computer-animated feature
film whose production has consumed much of their
time throughout the school year.
"This is not something that singing groups nor
mally do," said Rob Morris, a coterminal student in
computer science who directed the project. "The
technology has gotten good enough to do something
like this on the budget we have."
The six-minute, 40-second movie uses the Stan
ford campus as a setting for a battle between good
and evil akin to the TIE fighter dogfights of the Star
Wars trilogy.
"Each year, we like to have a theme for the spring
show," said Fleet Street business manager Mark
Dixon, a junior in industrial engineering. "This
year we decided to make a Star Wars theme with a
space-adventure fantasy movie as part of the main
focus."
Scenes were created and integrated into the actu
al movie through a process called rendering. "It basi
cally starts out through building models in the same
way you build with Legos," Morris said. "Once you
have those models, you give them paths to follow and
change their properties to give the appearance of mo
tion."
Fleet Street eventually rented a Macintosh 9500
to render scenes constantly over two months of win
ter quarter. Using Ray Dream Studio, Adobe Pre
miere and Sound Edit, they created and rendered
about 12,000 frames for the final movie. Overall,
Dixon said, the project cost about $2,500.

"We've also been at work integrating the sound
track with the scenes 24 hours a day for the past
four days," Morris added. He estimated that more
than 1,000 hours have been invested just in scene
design and the modeling of familiar Stanford icons
such as the Quad, Hoover Tower, the Oval and Palm
Drive.
"Blue screening" was also employed to add actual
Stanford students to the computer-animated movie.
"We videotaped people in front of blue background
screens," Dixon explained. "The computer then
stuck the images of those people into the computer
rendered scenes."
Both Dixon and Morris agreed that the movie
making experience has been worthwhile.
"Making movies is incredibly hard," Morris said.
"Making computer-animated movies is ludicrous,
but it's been a lot of fun and it's been a real chal
lenge."
Sophomores Adam York and Jeff Thamkit
tikasem, who assisted in designing and rendering
some scenes and modeling several objects, saw an
enormous amount of technological merit in the ani
mated movie.
"It's very exciting that students are able to create
this kind of project even with limited resources,"
York said. "This is something that would not have
been possible until very recently."
"It's awesome for students like us to have done
what we've done with this movie â€” not only design
ing models but building and animating whole
scenes," Thamkittikasem agreed.
Tickets to Fleet Street's spring show, which will
take place at 8 p.m. tomorrow in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium, are $7 with a $3 student discount.
