### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
Two seniors are expected to surrender to police
today for allegedly beating another student following
a party last month in Governor's Corner.
Warrants were issued yesterday by Stanford Po
lice for John Earl Hebert, 22, a sociology major and
former nose tackle for the Stanford football team,
and Douglas Gene Michel, 26, an industrial engi
neering major.
Lawyers for both Hebert and Michel were contact
ed and were arranging for their clients to surrender
today, Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
"If not, we'll go get them or the sheriffs will go get
them," Niemeyer said.
The two will each be charged with felony as
sault and held at the Santa Clara County jail in

lieu of $20,000 bail.
At 12:30 am. April 28, Hebert and Michel al
legedly punched and kicked a 19-year-old member of
the Phi Delta Theta fraternity after an argument
began outside Marx House over the T-shirt the vic
tim was wearing.
Hebert is a member of the Delta Tau Delta frater
nity, and Michel belongs to the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity.
The victim's shirt read on the front, "If your RA
said it, it must be true," and on the back, "Rush '95
Phi Delta Theta." A name-calling, beer-throwing
confrontation ensued.
Niemeyer said witnesses at the scene identified
Hebert and Michel to police as the assailants.
The victim, who has not been identified, was
treated for facial injuries at Stanford Hospital emer
gency room and released.
