# 'Walky Walk' goes on
## Irreverent procession tradition continues 
### Burt Herman Jesse Oxfeld Editorial staff 
It may not be the oldest or most distin
guished University tradition, but balloons,
barbecues, debauchery and all, the so-called
"Wacky Walk" will go on.
Unlike most other universities, where
graduating seniors march stoically to end
less choruses of "Pomp and Circumstance,"
Stanford seniors decided to abandon that
approach about five years ago and break for
mation.
"It has become a Stanford tradition,"
said Sarah Cranston, one of the senior class
presidents. "It's our day to celebrate as we
see fit."
Stanford's variation on the processional
was almost removed last year. Seniors
protested its withdrawal, which administra
tors said was made because the meandering
processional made the Commencement cer

emony too long. In response, a protest was
held in White Plaza and eventually the tra
ditional untraditional procession was
brought back.
Sometimes things do get out of hand.
Last year, a student tried to bring a horse
with her to walk in the procession, but it
was not allowed. Cranston said this year,
the class presidents will be giving out a let
ter with caps and gowns detailing a list of
Commencement dos and don'ts. "No live
stock," Cranston said.
She also cautioned that those choosing to
carry signs use soft materials, such as cloth.
"It just makes it a lot less nerve racking,"
Cranston said, using the term "controlled
chaos" for the June 16 festivities. Alcohol is
also not allowed due to California state law.
The various props that seniors have
brought with them have escalated in scale
over the last few years. In 1989, the wacki-
ness was limited to a few seniors
that walked with balloons or held
up signs. But since then, seniors
each year have become progres
sively crazier. The following is a
year-by-year account of the state
of the entrance:
• 1989: Though certainly far
from staid, the processional actu
ally proceeds. Students are wear
ing various types of novelty head
gear, holding aloft signs and car
rying balloons. The graduating
class stays together as a group
and follows the track around the
field.
• 1990: The first group of stu
dents breaks ranks. Ten or 20
students leave the marching
group and head onto the football
field. Some are spinning, tossing a
Frisbee or just hanging out.
• 1991: A serious depletion of
the marching ranks is noticeable
for the first time. Some students
leave the marching group, run
onto the field and quickly return
to the crowd. Red latex balloons

and prevalent soap bubbles are
spotted. While one student
rollerblades along with the pro
cessional, many head onto the
grassy field. Cartwheels, baseball,
Frisbee, a man being pulled on a
cart and an Interstate 91 highway
sign from Vermont are spotted.
• 1992: Four people wear a cow
costume; others play catch with a
stuffed panda, play baseball, fly
kites and wear assorted costumes.
More bubbles and bicycles show
up, as do star-shaped mylar bal
loons. A Slip V Slide appears for
the first time. Nonetheless, many
still spend at least some time in
the processional.
• 1993: Another Slip 'n' Slide
and more bubbles are seen. A
bicycle-built-for-two appears, as
do dog piles and kicklines. People
wear robes covered with Twister
mats and light bulbs and fence
with plungers. Hats are decorated
with airplanes, flamingoes and
various twirly things. Still, many
students, at some point, do march
on or around the track.
• 1994: As amused graduate
students march, undergraduates
eschew the walking part of the
processioned. Rather than circling

the field and entering the ceremo
ny area from behind, students
run across the field stage to reach
their seats. Rollerblades are more
prevalent as are those with truly
outrageous headgear.
Many play Frisbee, many
dance, many engage in dog piling.
Someone unicycles in. There are
lots of balloons and signs, includ
ing one reading, "Hilary, will you
marry me?" Someone wears the
Brazilian flag. A group of men in
Speedo swimsuits emulate profes
sional wrestlers. A group of
women in gowns sit in an inflat
able pool and bathe in bottled
water.
• 1995: The balloons got much
larger, with three seniors choos
ing to attach 15-foot weather bal
loons to their backs. The signs
also got larger; a group of stu
dents had built human-size let
tering reading, "Dad." Due to the
threatened removal of the proces
sion, seniors eschew any forma
tion and essentially run into the
stadium much in the fashion of
the Stanford Band. Many went
with the sign approach, and oth
ers brought water guns to keep
themselves and others cool.
