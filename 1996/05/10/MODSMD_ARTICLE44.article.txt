# Senior giving on par to beat last year's record
## Gift goals just in sight 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Not afraid to meet the challenge set by
their predecessors, this year's Senior
Class is well on its way to beating last
year's record Senior Gift donation.
Thirty-nine percent of the class has
given $14,600 so far, according to Brian
Perronne, director of young alumni and
student development. The Parents Advi
sory Board and Stanford benefactor Peter
Bing match each gift dollar for dollar.
After the class reached 30 percent partic
ipation, Bing also gave a $50,000 dona
tion and he will make another $50,000
donation if the class goes above 50 per
cent participation. An anonymous donor
will give another $10,000 if participation

goes above 60 percent.
Last year's seniors had a 52.3 percent
participation rate and donated a total of
$188,297 after all matching gifts. The
Class of 1994 gave $106,177.
"These last few gifts are critical," Per
ronne said, adding that many seniors wait
until the last minute to decide to give.
"We want to have the highest percent
age of any class ever," said Senior Class
President Aaron Lehman. "I think we'll
be able to beat it."
Money collected from the Senior Gift
is donated to the Stanford Fund, which
was developed two years ago as an initia
tive to raise unrestricted funds for
undergraduate education. Stanford Fund
