# Jemison to address Class of 1996
## A 						final farewell 
### Scott Van Winkle Senior staff writer 
Medical doctor, chemical engineer
and NASA mission specialist Mae
Jemison, the first black woman to go
into space, will address the Class of
1996 as Commencement speaker.
Jemison, who earned a dual under
graduate degree from Stanford in
1977, has had a broad-ranging career
in research and medicine.
"She's someone who shows that no
matter what race or gender you are,
you can accomplish something," said
Senior Class President Aaron
Lehman, who helped select Jemison as
the speaker.
Jemison, currently on the faculty at
Dartmouth College, served as a gener
al practitioner in Los Angeles and
spent more than two years as a Peace
Corps worker in West Africa.
In the last two years, she founded
an international space camp called
"The Earth We Share," and she has
also served as host of the Discoveiy
Channel program, "World of Won
der."
"It's important to get everybody
involved in science and technology,"
she said in a 1992 Stanford Magazine
article. "Space exploration is a hook."
In addition, Jemison has helped
promote the study of environmental
issues in developing countries, both
among academics and through her pri
vate foundation, Jemison Group Inc.
She was named to the faculty of
Dartmouth in environmental studies
last year, after teaching such courses
as "Space Age Technology in Develop
ing Countries."
At Stanford's Centennial Celebra
tion in 1990, Jemison gave a keynote
speech stressing the University's
"tremendous responsibility" to
include study of the developing world

in its curriculum.
Jemison entered Stanford at age 16
and went on to earn degrees in chemi
cal engineering and African and Afro-
American Studies. She studied
medicine at Cornell University and
use.
In 1987, NASA selected her from
among 2,000 applicants to train to be
an astronaut. She flew on the space
shuttle Endeavour on Sept. 12, 1992,
conducting a pair of biological experi
ments on the flight.
In one experiment, Jemison used
what was described as "positive

thinking" to combat motion sick
ness. She also monitored frog
embryos in the weightless envi
ronment and served as a mission
specialist for a joint U.S.-Japan
project.
Jean Fetter, assistant to Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper, praised Jemison as an
"extraordinary role model" â€”
both as a woman in engineering
and as a "pioneer" in space.
Jemison was selected by Casper
from among seven candidates
nominated by the Senior Class
presidents. She was the unani
mous first choice of the class pres
idents, according to Lehman.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said

she is "very excited" about the deci
sion, especially because seniors will
hear from a fellow graduate. "She

has done so much with her life,"
Rice said. "It's a wonderful choice."
Casper's selection guidelines
require that the Commencement

speaker have some Stanford con
nection, Senior Class President
Angela Booker said.
Aside from that, Booker said,
the main considerations in select
ing a speaker were charisma and
other students' suggestions. "We
wanted our Commencement to be
memorable," she added.
Jemison will be the second
black woman in six years to give
the address. Child welfare advo
cate Marian Wright Edelman
spoke to the Class of 1990.
Last year's speaker was Secretary
of Defense William Perry, who
earned both an undergraduate and
master's degree from the University.
Stanford's 105 th Commence
ment is scheduled for Sunday,
June 16. Four thousand gradu
ates and 30,000 guests are expect
ed to attend the ceremony at
Stanford Stadium.
