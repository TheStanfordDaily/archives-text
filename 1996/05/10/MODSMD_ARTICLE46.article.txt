# Speech will 'provide perspective'

Mae Jemison has always been
ahead of her time.
A high school standout, she
enrolled at the Farm at the age of 16
and was one of the few women to play
intramural football, participate in stu
dent politics and graduate with dual
degrees in chemical engineering and
African and Afro-American Studies.
The outstanding student was a
prodigy on the national scale, becom
ing the first African-American female
in space.
But Jemison never forgot her roots
in the Farm, she told The Daily in an
interview. For the second time in five
years, Jemison will return to speak at
Stanford, this time giving the keynote
address at the 1996 Commencement
ceremonies in June.
Was it simply Stanford that
inspired this woman to achieve great
ness? Partially, Jemison said,

although she added that she believes
all of her life experiences have been
integral.
She commended Stanford on its
ability to produce a broad range of
extra-curricular activities, which "are
extremely important for building you
and preparing you for the future.
"College is a wonderful place to get
skills in ... a non-threatening way,"
she said.
The importance of the college expe
rience cannot be ignored, Jemison
said. "One's education affects their
life," she said. "Period."
Only 19 years after her own gradu
ation, Jemison herself will take the
podium. It is a thought she considers
exciting, yet intimidating.
Jemison said she remembers the
stereotypical Commencement speaker
as someone who graduates rarely hear.
But as an accomplished lecturer,
Jemison hopes to mark the gradu
ation ceremony by providing "per
spective for graduates as well as
(well as) for family and faculty."
She considers her address a great
responsibility and hopes to help
those in attendance to "digest the
past."
Jemison was born in Decatur,
Ala. After graduating from Stan
ford, she received a doctorate in
medicine from Cornell University,
spent almost three years in the
Peace Corps in Africa and worked
as a general practitioner in Los
Angeles.
Jemison said she believes every

child is born with an eagerness to
achieve in the world, a view she
uses to explain her own success.
"Everyone has their own
innate motivation," she said. "It is
something we all have as chil
dren."
It is holding on to that motiva
tion all through life that is the
hard part, Jemison said. Her own
strategy for keeping her eagerness
intact, she added, has been by
"seeing the world is yours to see."
Jemison also emphasized the
importance of laughing at your
self.
"Often people are tragically
serious," she said.
In addition, Jemison's parents
have influenced her throughout
her life.
"They were happy to support

me when I was interested in doing
non-conventional things," she
said. Regardless of the path she
chose, Jemison said her parents
simply "asked that I do it well and
look inside myself."
As a minority woman entering
the math and science fields 20
years ago, Jemison inevitably
faced obstacles â€” barriers which
she said minority women today
still must strive to overcome.
"There is a dangerous backlash
against women and minorities
because of an inaccurate percep
tion of what affirmative action is,"
she said. Far too prevalent is the
notion that minorities and women
"wouldn't be there if they
weren't" beneficiaries of affirma
tive action, she said, "which is
absolutely ridiculous."
