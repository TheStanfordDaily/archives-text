## Advice for the young at Farm: Don't wait until it's over 
### 
I KNOW THIS is the pre-commence
ment issue and everything, but I
should be up front. This one really
isn't for the seniors.
It's for all those lucky undergrads who
still have at least one more year at this hal
lowed institution and can therefore take
my advice to heart.
As for the seniors who will do the
"Wacky Walk" this June, read it and weep.
I wish I had it to do over again. At the
very least, I wish I had the money, and the
time, and the lack of ambition to just stay
on campus one more year, without being
technically registered. That way, I could
do all the things I had decided I had want
ed to do in those halcyon days of Orienta
tion week, before Stanford's fast-paced
mood wormed its way into my carefree
work ethic. What follows is my wish list of
things I'd do if I had it to do over again.
I would sit around and audit all the
classes everyone told me shouldn't be
missed. My advising associate told me not
to miss Prof. Herant Katchadourian's
"Human Sexuality" class, and boy was she
right. I certainly wasn't going to learn
anything about that subject by living on
this campus. I would sit in and listen to
Prof. Ronald Rebholz wax lyrical about

Shakespeare and understand that whole
"To be or not to be" speech. And I would
drop in to the last lecture of that unbeliev
ably early (8 a.m.) CE 170 class, where
Prof. Gil Masters gets up on stage with a
guitar and does his '60s environmentalist
impersonation. Shouldn't be missed.
I would love to be a fly on the wall in
any of Prof. Philip Zimbardo's classes, but
particularly "Psychology of Mind Control"
— and then I would use all my knowledge
from that class on my unsuspecting resi
dent assistants. I might even use my
knowledge to pretend to be a freshman
and step over the line at every single ques
tion while playing that ridiculous Residen
tial Education game "Crossing the Line."
Another advantage of auditing would
be the fact that I could just walk in to "Fic
tion Writing" and never have to sleep out
in my sleeping bag for it. I'd make sure to
take Econ 1 with, and only with, Prof.
John Taylor just to watch him dress up in
a grape suit and dance to "I Heard It
Through the Grapevine." And I wouldn't
even have to worry about my grade by lis
tening to Prof. Diane Middlebrook lecture
on Poetry and Poetics.
As for all those "loser" DR classes, I
have to admit I would drop in to "Rocks

for Jocks," "Sleep and Dreams" (Snooze
and Cruise) and Oceans. Just do it, I say.
You'll never have the chance again.
Just to make my missed experiences
more well-rounded, I would fill up my
weekends by taking photographs for my
Photography 1 class, making sculptures of
all the cute guys in my dorm for Sculpture
1 and practicing my "Come hither" look
for "Introduction to Acting."
And just to understand why every
action has an equal and opposite reaction,
I might even drop in to some physics class
es. I already took "Physics for Poets."
But the Stanford experience is not all
about academics. Don't let studying get in
the way of your education, to misquote
Einstein. Have fun. Get out there. Explore
the campus.
I still haven't seen SLAC (for those
fuzzies out there, the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center). Admittedly, it looks
like a long line of storage garages, but they
do something (I don't know what exactly)
really spectacular in there, so it should be
seen. Plus, the University won't rent it out
as storage space — I know, I asked. I
haven't had the chance to walk through
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, and my
RA was even a docent. I took in my first

walk among the green grass of the
foothills only a couple of weekends ago.
And up until too recent a time to mention,
I hadn't paid homage to the phallic symbol
par excellence on campus (that is, I didn't
go to the top of Hoover Tower except in a
fit of feelings of obligation). But I did at
least explore the Rodin Sculpture Garden
in my first year here. You all should have
at least been there. And I went to Viennese
Ball. That's three for me and 204 for all
the things I haven't done. I have a good
four weeks to win. Anyone betting on me?
I know the message is somewhat
cliched. I think someone told me some of
these same things when I first got here.
And the bright-eyed bushy-tailed young
pup that I was, I most certainly gave them
a little ironic, naive smile — I, of course,
was going to do all of those things and
more. Whoops. Funny how the tide can
turn. Somehow I just didn't get around to
doing them, what between going skiing in
Tahoe and fulfilling my DRs and going
overseas. Who could have ever done all of
those things? Too many all-nighters, not
enough sleep and no realization that
senior year arrives more quickly than a
freshman at a cappella tryouts.
So, if I did have an extra year, grade

free, money-full, ambition-less, I might
just sneak into a CIV section and heckle all
the people kissing the ass of the TA. I
would SLE tutor and ask my tutee out on
a date. I might even try to wreck the CPPC
phone bidding system or attempt crashing
Sweet Hall's computer system.
Whatever it is I wish I had done in the
end, some of it just wouldn't happen. I'd
get carried away by playing pool at Lamb
da Nu or climbing up to the top of the Dish
on the same weekend of Exotic Erotic. Or
"Hum Sex" would probably conflict with
Shakespeare as well as "Introduction to
American Law," and I would have to wait
until next year to get a taste of it.
What it comes down to, I guess, is that
I could find excuses for not doing at least
half of the things I mentioned. And that
means you could too. But, when you'll be
four weeks away from graduation and
you'll start making a list (and checking it
twice) of all the things you've done, try to
have a few more items than excuses. You
won't regret the experiences you've tried,
just the ones you didn't.
Trust me. I know. I'm a senior.
