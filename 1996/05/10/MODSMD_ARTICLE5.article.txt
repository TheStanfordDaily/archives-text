# Casper proposes new graduate fellowships
## Undergrad education also gets boost 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
In an effort to revital
ize the first two years of
undergraduate educa
tion and to attract tup
students to Stanford's
graduate programs, Uni
versity President Ger
hard Casper announced
yesterday a graduate fel
lowship program and a

comprehensive plan for the first two years of
undergraduate education.
The Stanford Graduate Fellows program
will be implemented with the help of a $10
million startup fund allocated through the
President's Fund. The money will support a
national competition for 300 three-year fel
lowships, 100 to be given out each year for the
next three years. The fellowships will mostly
be awarded to incoming graduate students in
the sciences and engineering.
Casper set a two-year timetable to raise an
additional $200 million to support the pro
gram, which, if it is fully implemented, will
provide support for at least 300 students each
year. Already, the Lucille P. Markey Charita
ble Trust has donated a permanent endow
ment of $2 million for fellowships in biomed

ical science.
Each fellowship will provide $12,000 to
cover tuition expenses and a $16,000 stipend
in an effort "to attract the finest graduate
students possible," Casper said.
Currently, there is some concern that
Stanford is losing top graduate school candi
dates to other institutions that provide more
lucrative support.
The problem, said Vice Provost and Dean
of Research Charles Kruger, is that while
graduate students in the humanities rely on
unrestricted University funds, students in
the sciences rely on grants and federal funds,
the availability of which is quickly decreasing.
Kruger hastened to note that the new fel
lowship program is "not an effort to swing
away from the humanities and social sci
ences," but rather an effort to provide sup
port where it is lacking.
"As far as I know, there is no other pro
gram like this that has been announced,"
Kruger said.
"Our graduate students are disappearing,
and that is what we are trying to address,"
Casper said in his speech.
