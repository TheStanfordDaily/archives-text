# Casper proposes new graduate fellowships
## Undergrad education also gets boost 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
In an effort to revital
ize the first two years of
undergraduate educa
tion and to attract tup
students to Stanford's
graduate programs, Uni
versity President Ger
hard Casper announced
yesterday a graduate fel
lowship program and a

comprehensive plan for the first two years of
undergraduate education.
The Stanford Graduate Fellows program
will be implemented with the help of a $10
million startup fund allocated through the
President's Fund. The money will support a
national competition for 300 three-year fel
lowships, 100 to be given out each year for the
next three years. The fellowships will mostly
be awarded to incoming graduate students in
the sciences and engineering.
Casper set a two-year timetable to raise an
additional $200 million to support the pro
gram, which, if it is fully implemented, will
provide support for at least 300 students each
year. Already, the Lucille P. Markey Charita
ble Trust has donated a permanent endow
ment of $2 million for fellowships in biomed

ical science.
Each fellowship will provide $12,000 to
cover tuition expenses and a $16,000 stipend
in an effort "to attract the finest graduate
students possible," Casper said.
Currently, there is some concern that
Stanford is losing top graduate school candi
dates to other institutions that provide more
lucrative support.
The problem, said Vice Provost and Dean
of Research Charles Kruger, is that while
graduate students in the humanities rely on
unrestricted University funds, students in
the sciences rely on grants and federal funds,
the availability of which is quickly decreasing.
Kruger hastened to note that the new fel
lowship program is "not an effort to swing
away from the humanities and social sci
ences," but rather an effort to provide sup
port where it is lacking.
"As far as I know, there is no other pro
gram like this that has been announced,"
Kruger said.
"Our graduate students are disappearing,
and that is what we are trying to address,"
Casper said in his speech.
In response to a comment by English Prof.
John Bender that his department lost two top
candidates last year because of inadequate

funding offers, Casper said, "I have
no intention to sit still if other uni
versities take away our best candi
dates."
The first recruiting process will
take place next year so that the first
fellows can enter in the 1997-98 aca
demic year.
The second initiative, a re
sponse to recommendations by the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education, involves creating a
freshman seminar requirement
that will hopefully be incorporated
into the Program in Cultures,
Ideas, and Values, Casper said. To
support this venture, former Uni
versity trustee Peter Bing has do
nated $15 million to create up to 20
incremental faculty billets in the
next five years. Faculty billets rep
resent allocations for faculty posi
tions.
"If the programs are successful,
I have every confidence that we will
obtain permanent support for the
new faculty billets," Casper said.
The seminars are an effort to in
crease the amount of interaction
first- and second-year undergradu
ates have with "regular" faculty
and to push them toward a "rigor
ous, interactive search for truth,"
Casper said.
The seminar program, dubbed
"Stanford Introductory Studies"
by Casper, will undergo a three
year planning cycle to be overseen
by Provost Condoleezza Rice. The
planning process will focus on eval
uating such things as the ability of
University departments to re-dis
tribute their teaching loads to ac

commodate the Stanford Introduc
tory Studies program and the possi
bility of integrating the seminars
into the current curriculum "so as
not to increase the total number of
requirements on students," Casper
said.
"The introduction of required
freshman seminars should not
mean an additional required course
for first-year students," Casper
said. "We can make room for this
course by linking it to a current re
quirement — such as CIV or Writ
ing and Critical Thinking — or by
allowing freshman seminars to
meet an existing distribution re
quirement."
The seminars will be similar in
concept and form to the sopho
more seminars and dialogues that
were introduced by former
University President Donald
Kennedy and Sophomore College,
which debuted this past summer.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldivar said
pilot sessions for the seminars will
begin in 1997.
The seminars "will set the mood
for profound intellectual inquiry"
in the first year of undergraduate
studies and will "enhance the op
portunity for mentoring experi
ences," Saldivar said in a press con
ference prior to the senate meeting.
"This will make us more attrac
tive to prospective students," Saldi
var added.
The seminars, which will be in a
variety of disciplines, will number
around 100, with an approximate
enrollment of 15 students per sem
inar.
Casper also expressed hope that
the program will increase Stan
ford's attractiveness to applicants,
saying that "such a program would

demonstrate to the best students in
the country our unfaltering com
mitment to taking their college edu
cation seriously from its inception."
"My hope is we will become even
more irresistible to applicants," he
said.
Casper said he believes the sem
inars should be required because
students "should not be able to get
away with avoiding the challenge
that comes with small-group inter
action. It is our obligation" to en
sure that students are met with
this challenge, he asserted.
"This is an important change
that will not only set the tone for
students but for ourselves," Casper
said.
In his speech, Casper empha
sized the mutual benefit of the sem
inars to both students and faculty.
He made clear, however, that the
newly hired professors will not in
any way comprise a "college facul
ty" — a second class of professors
hired just to teach a liberal arts cur
riculum — as has been the case at
other schools like the University of
Chicago.
Senate members lauded the
program initiative, saying it would
be a boon to the undergraduate
academic structure and a way to
bring faculty and students togeth
er sooner Mechanical Engineer
ing Prof. Jim Adams raised the
concern that it might not be a sim
ple matter to find professors suited
to teaching freshmen in a seminar
environment.
Casper agreed, saying, "We do
indeed need to pay more attention
to the qualities that make for
[teaching] success. There has to be
an element of voluntariness. The
faculty have to be clearly ready to
engage."
