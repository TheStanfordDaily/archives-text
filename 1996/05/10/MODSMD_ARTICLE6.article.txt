# New program involves alumni in admissions

### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
The Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions yesterday launched a new initiative to
involve recent alumni in the admissions
process.
Approximately 40 students attended the
inaugurai.oeminar, dubbed "Senior Blitz."
The seminar, and others like it planned for
the future, are aimed at increasing involve
ment from this year's graduating class in
Stanford's recruitment process, said Holly
Haley Knapp, alumni involvement coordi
nator for the admissions office.
Elise Maar, assistant director of under
graduate admissions, said recent alumni
carry more credibility than admissions offi
cers, whose responses may sometimes be
perceived by students and parents as
"slick" and prepackaged. Involving alumni,
then, is an excellent way to enhance re
cruitment efforts, Maar said.
The initiative, known as the Admission
Alumni Involvement Program, seeks to in
volve recently graduated alumni in college
fairs and regional information sessions
held by the admissions office, as well as ex

pand alumni panels and receptions during
the spring for admitted students. The pro
gram's efforts will be centered in 20 majoi-
U.S. cities.
"Recent graduates are some of the best
people to talk to about Stanford," Knapp
said. "Stanford graduates are all over the
country â€” all over the world. Many
prospective applicants who have questions
or would like to know more about the "Uni
versity can get the best information from
people who attended Stanford."
Joan Lippman, associate director of un
dergraduate admissions, said recent gradu
ates "are also great to talk to about the di
verse opportunities [prospective students]
would have at Stanford."
Lippman added that the initiative is not
a first step toward using alumni as inter
viewers in the admissions process.
"Such plans are not being considered,"
Lippman said. "However, we are consider
ing using alumni in other meaningful
ways."
