# Students join to promote growth and community
## 
### Marcella Bernhard 
If you saw the small circle of people sitting on the grass
in front of History Corner on Monday night, you might
think at first that they were simply a group of friends hang
ing out.
That would be only partially true. The gathering would
also be the weekly meeting of World Tribe, a new student
group devoted to personal growth, community strengthen
ing and environmental protection and awareness.
World Tribe, or Tribe, was founded this year by sopho
more Sarah Deamer, with help from sophomore Kristie
Smith.
"The objectives of Tribe are to share cultural ideas, to
try to improve human interaction and also to improve
human environmental interaction," said Deamer. "There
is definitely a wide range of scales on which to focus. Tribe's
focus has been criticized as being too broad, but I really feel
that it's very important to synthesize these three goals."
Deamer, who has been involved in community service
and environmental groups both in high school and at Stan
ford, was motivated to found Tribe due to her belief that a
student group was needed on campus which could incorpo
rate personal growth with environmental and community
action.
This emphasis on individual growth is reflected in the
name World Tribe, Deamer said. The name "Tribe" origi-

nated with Deamer's belief that
the individual attention and feel
ings of self-worth that are found in
small tribes of people have been
neglected by today's society.
"Our society often asks individ
uals to compromise their personal
growth for the society," Deamer
said. "People should interact with
people, not institutions. Tribes,
which are smaller and limited,
focus on individuals."
This individual focus occurs at
weekly Tribe meetings, which are
held on Mondays at 8 p.m. at His
tory Corner. The purpose of the
meetings is to provide a forum for
cultural sharing, during which
people can present a skill or inter
est.
Past meetings have included
presentations on the Didjeredoo,
an Australian aboriginal instru
ment, the Tarot and the I Ching,
an Eastern philosophy.
At the meeting on the I Ching,
sophomore Steve Enstad taught
members about how the I Ching
works and told about his experi
ences using it. The I Ching is a
Toaist system of divination in
which coins are thrown and dia
grams indicating what one should
do are created, Enstad explained.
Each person in the group
threw coins to create I Ching dia
grams and used books to look up
the meanings of their I Ching con
figurations.
"It seems that there has been a
lot of breakdown within the dom
inant paradigms in society, such
as religion," said Enstad. "This
has left a big void, where people
just don't know what to believe in.
Tribes are about reverting to the
last thing that worked."
At the meetings "there are
new things that I always wanted
to learn about but never had the
time, or things that I already
know about that I can teach,"
said Lisa Scadron, a sophomore.
"I like the concept of a tribe;
every individual is important to
the whole."
"People are not valued for the

myriad of things they can do.
They are valued merely for their
contribution to society," Deamer
said. "(The weekly meetings] are
about sharing specific cultural
skills that people don't have a
chance to share in this specific
academic environment."
Weekly Tribe meetings also
give members a chance to define
Tribe goals, which are implement
ed through quarterly environ
mental and community-outreach
projects.
For their environmental pro
ject this quarter, Tribe restored
native oak tree populations with
Magic, Inc., a Palo Alto environ
mental group.
Tribe's community-outreach
project was volunteering with the
You Can Make A Difference Con
ference, which occurred in late
April. There will also be a Tribe
retreat at Muir Woods later this
the month.
Tribe plans to apply for money
from the Bingham Fund, a fund
for student organizations provid
ed through the Program in
Human Biology, said Deamer.
Next year, Deamer said, the group
hopes to facilitate faculty-student
contact by incorporating Stanford
professors into the weekly meet
ings.
In accordance with Tribe's flex
ible, member-oriented approach,
the responsibilities of running
Tribe are divided up among six
people: a coordinating leader, envi
ronmental leader, community
leader, resource leader and two
cultural leaders. Elections to fill
these positions will be held June 3.
Deamer said she feels positive
about the future of Tribe.
"If I can improve and strength
en this community, then wherever
I move to I have gained the skills to
improve and strengthen that com
munity," Deamer explained.
"What you put in will come
back. Maybe not to you personally,
maybe to your children, maybe to
your grandchildren. But putting
positive energy into the world can
not possibly bring more negative
energy out. If we're working to
wards growth and the realization
of the individual, somehow we'll
get there," Deamer added.
