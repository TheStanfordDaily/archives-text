### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Three slates will contend for
the positions of president and vice
president in this spring's ASSU
special election, which will be held
May 22 and 23.
This year's election has drawn
a diverse group of candidate
teams from different classes and
with different agendas.
ASSU Deputy Senate Chair
Bill Shen heads a slate with junior
Nick Thompson. The team hopes
to work with the reforms mandat
ed by "Constitution '96."
"I think thecomingyear will be
a defining year for the ASSU
given the new structure," Shen
said. "If you don't have qualified
and dedicated people working
then the new structure is mean
ingless. This is a mandate for deci
sive leadership."
Shen added that he was excited
to work on the new reforms.
"We're not going to rehash all the
old issues," he said. "We're com
ing in with a blank slate and a new
spirit."
Presidential candidate Sam
Ockman, running with fellow ju
nior Mike Mitchell, said he sup
ports a five-point plan to address
student activities, dining and
safety.
"We have a historic chance to
have a real student government,"
Ockman said. He said he hopes to
examine such issues as meeting
sites for student activities, compe
tition in student dining services
and campus safety issues.
Sophomores Margo Quandt
and Ben Olding are running on a
slate sponsored by the Chaparral.
"We are calling for a unified
voice instead of an amorphous
one," said Olding, who will serve
as the vice president if elected.
Olding listed several issues -

including the ASSU banking sys
tem, special fees and the Women's
Collective â€” that the slate will
push the University to examine.
"I think of the ASSU in terms
(if a small child," he said. "It
should be seen more often instead
of being heard more often."
An additional slate, composed

of junior Ben Decker and sopho
more Emily Andrus, was regis
tered to run but dropped its cam
paign yesterday.
"It was a tough decision," said
Decker. "We still plan to work on
the issues but we'd like to concen
trate on reconciliation and moving
forward."

In addition, two graduate stu
dents will run in the election for
the graduate student council, also
held May 22 and 23.
Trisha Tang will run as the rep
resentative from the School of Hu
manities and Sciences and Mer
cedes Salomon will run from the
Law School.
