# Bratman to chair Faculty Senate
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
Philosophy Prof. Michael Bratman has been
chosen to chair the Faculty Senate for the 1996-
97 academic year. He will replace Geological and
Environmental Sciences Prof. Gail Mahood.
"I am looking forward to it," Bratman said. "I
think the senate is the only place the faculty can
get together and talk seriously about what Stan
ford is doing — we are not only a deciding body,
but a deliberative body."
Bratman has served on the senate since the
19705, working on several senate committees

and chairing a task force on undergraduate edu
cation. Chairs serve a one-year term.
"There is no doubt that with the new Plan
ning and Policy Board, [University President
Gerhard Casper's] new initiatives, the new dis
tribution requirements, the discussions on the
nature of graduate education, these things will
need to be talked about," Bratman said.
"There is a lot of conceptualizing to be done
— we are lucky to be at an institution excited
about its future."
Coming to Stanford as an acting assistant
professor in 1974, Bratman received tenure in
1980 and became a full professor in 1986. He

chaired the Philosophy Department from 1986
to 1988 and again from 1991 to 1994.
Along with Bratman, the senate Steering
Committee will include Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy, Chemistry Prof. John Brau
man, Biology Prof. Pat Jones, Medicine Prof.
Ken Melmon, Industrial Engineering Prof. Eliz
abeth Pate-Cornell and English Prof. Robert
Polhemus.
