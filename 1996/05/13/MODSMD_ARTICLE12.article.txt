## No survivors found from crash Authorities call off search for passengers of ValuJet flight 
### 
MIAMI (AP) — No survivors, no bod
ies, no hope on Mother's Day.
Authorities yesterday called off the
search for possible survivors of the crash
of ValuJet Flight 592, which nose-dived
into the Everglades with 104 passengers
and five crew members.
"One hundred and nine mothers that
are not doing too good right now," Bill
Boland muttered to a fellow ambulance
driver at mid morning.
The DC-9 had been in the air only eight
minutes on a Saturday afternoon flight to
Atlanta when the crew reported smoke in
the cockpit. They attempted to turn
around but the plane crashed about 15
miles northwest of Miami International
Airport. The source of the cockpit smoke
was unknown.
Tapes of the conversation between a
male crew member and the airport tower
indicate there also was smoke in the pas
senger cabin, National Transportation
Safety Board Vice Chairman Robert
Francis said at a news conference last
night.
"As the conversation went on there
was in the view of the controller and in the

view of the people who listened to the tape
... a considerable sense of urgency on the
part of the pilot," Francis said.
Gregory Feith, NTSB investigator in
charge, said the last intelligible transmis
sion from the plane was the crew mem
ber's acknowledgment of a request to
turn back, assignment of a new descent
altitude and the location of the nearest
airport.
Investigators have located the plane's
two engines, but did not expect to find
large portions of the plane intact, Francis
said.
Francis said much of the wreckage in
the swampy waters is painted blue, which
is the color ValuJet paints the rear of its
planes, where the flight data and cockpit
voice recorders are located.
Finding the blue plane sections encour
aged investigators they would recover the
recorders, Francis said. The devices are
key to understanding what happened to
the pkine and what was said in the final
moments before the crash.
The swamp yielded pieces of clothing
yesterday, in addition to a family photo
album and a floating airplane seat that

were found Saturday.
"There's no evidence of the plane. It's
gone," said Bret Rugg, 41, of Richmond,
Ind., whose wife Terri was on the plane.
He had taken his two sons, ages 5 and 11,
to meet their mother on her return from a
cruise she made as a travel agency owner.
"I don't know what I'm going to do,"
he said.
Clearer pictures of the passengers
emerged yesterday: a Baptist church
organist and his wife on a dream vacation,
a young man preparing for missionary
work in his native Venezuela, a mother
and her daughter who had become "real
friends" in recent years.
Also among those on Flight 592 were
San Diego Chargers running back Rodney
Culver and his wife, Karen, of Woodstock,
Ga.
"These are human beings," ValuJet
Airlines Inc. President Lewis Jordan said
of the victims at a news conference in
Miami yesterday morning. "Every human
being in every seat of the airplane is a life
and a loved one with stories to tell, with
friends, with places to go. It's Mother's
Day weekend, we know that."
