### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel and the Palestinians
have agreed to delay the Israeli troop pullout from
most of the West Bank city of Hebron until after the
May 29 elections, a senior Israeli official said yestcr
day.
"We have decided, and this was decided together
with the Palestinians, that we should delay any fur
ther developments in Hebron for the time being in
order not to create a lot of friction," said Uri Dromi,
director of Israel's Government Press Office.
"The most important thing is to go to the election
and then the next government will carry out all the
obligations reached with the Palestinians."
Israel halted its promised troop redeployment in
Hebron in March after a series of bombings by
Islamic militants killed 59 people in Israel.
The Haaretz newspaper, citing a senior official of
the governing Labor Party, said Israeli and Pales
tinian negotiators also agreed that Israeli troops
would remain in a larger portion of Hebron than

originally planned.
The report said the Palestinians accepted Israel's
argument that this was the best way to ensure that
Israeli troops could protect the 450 Jewish settlers
who live among 94,000 Palestinians in Hebron.
Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natche said yesterday he
was not happy with the decision.
"The delayed redeployment from the city will
make people frustrated," Natche said.
Jewish settlers in the city oppose the Israeli pull
out, arguing that Hebron is a center of the Islamic
militant Hamas movement and that Hamas mili
tants pose a danger to Jews in Hebron. The settlers
have said they will stage protests to try and prevent
an army pullout.
The army reported a gasoline bomb attack on
Israeli forces in Hebron, but said there were no
injuries. Another gasoline bomb yesterday slightly
injured an Israeli policeman in the autonomous
Palestinian town of Ramallah, army radio said.
