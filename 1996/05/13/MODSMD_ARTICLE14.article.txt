Rao re-elected
NEW DELHI, India (AP) — Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao was re-elected head of the Congress
party yesterday, despite a general election defeat
that is forcing him to step down as India's leader.
The current ruling party also offered to sup
port a leftist coalition that hopes to lead India's
next government. But some party leaders said
they have not given up the idea of forming a
Congress-led government.
The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party
won the most Parliament seats in India's general
election, but fell short of an outright majority. It
has asked President Shankar Dayal Sharma for
the right to form a coalition government.
Should the leftist alliance lead the next govern
ment, it would be the first time lower castes and
other traditionally disadvantaged groups would
have an important role in India's leadership.
