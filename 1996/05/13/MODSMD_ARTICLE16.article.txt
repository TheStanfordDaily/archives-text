Plan to involve grads in
recruitment efforts can
reap many advantages

THE OFFICE OF Undergrad
uate Admissions recently
enacted a new program to
increase alumni participation in the
admissions process. Dubbed the
Admission Alumni Involvement
Program, its goal is twofold. On the
one hand, it aims to increase Stan
ford's exposure to prospective appli
cants; on the other hand, Stanford
administrators hope that the pro
gram results in more alumni
involvement with the University.
These are laudable goals, and the
Admissions Office should be com
mended for its initiative. There is a
worry, however, that recent gradu
ates will be encouraged to give a
monotonous party-line account of
the University instead of speaking
from the heart about their personal
experiences on the Farm.
As every Stanford student
knows, this University is impossi
ble to describe in a few key words or
phrases. Diverse? Yes. Challenging?
Of course. Incomparable? Certain
ly. These are the buzzwords of col
lege admissions officers every
where, and everyone recognizes
that Stanford has to market itself
to maintain its high prestige. Yet
somehow these marketing ploys
ring hollow in the ears of prospec
tive applicants. Every school bills
itself as diverse, challenging and
otherwise special. And one can only
brag about the California weather
for so long. Even the Admissions
Office admits as much. It is precise
ly because students and parents
perceive the presentations of
admissions officers as "slick and
prepackaged" that Stanford's
administrators hit on the idea of
alumni involvement. After all,
alumni are a rich and geographical
ly diverse resource for the Universi
ty. They can provide an immediate

personal touch to the official admis
sions process, and they can give a
human face to a university per
ceived as distant by some.
In other words, it is the honesty
and sincerity of recent graduates
that set them apart from admis
sions officers. It would thus be a
pity if the Admissions Office
attempted to coach Stanford alumni
into talking about Stanford in a for
mulaic and monolithic fashion. Last
week, recent graduates attended a
seminar intended to familiarize
them with the admissions process.
The idea is to prepare prospective
alumni representatives to handle a
myriad of questions from parents
and students. While a certain famil
iarity with the admissions process
will undoubtedly benefit alumni
representatives, their main role
ought not to be information
providers; that is what the admis
sions officers are there to do. Alum
ni representatives should be
encouraged to speak openly about
the highs and lows of their Stanford
years.
Prospective applicants know that
Stanford is a stellar institution of
higher learning; from alumni, they
should be able to learn what life
here is really like. Recent graduates
are uniquely capable of answering
such queries, and it unlikely that
they need help from the Admissions
Office in doing so. If any institution
can sell itself without the aid of cute
phrases and slick advertising, it is
Stanford. Left to their own devices,
recent graduates will likely do a fine
job describing the Farm, its advan
tages, its disadvantages and all of
the mundane details that make
Stanford life what it is.
As for encouraging alumni
involvement in University affairs,
the Admission Alumni Involvement
Program will succeed only if alumni
feel that their role in the admissions
process is more than strategic.
Assuming that the program encour
ages more alumni to give sincere
reflections of their experiences at
Stanford to prospective applicants,
it will be a worthwhile and success
ful initiative.
