## Time for drunken formality 
### 
I ADMIT TT: I'm hung over. Not slop
py and belligerent, just brain dead. 1
can't pay attention for more than a
minute or two. If I try, my eyes glaze
over, spittle drips from the corner of my
mouth and beads of sweat form on my
brow. So I just sit like a vegetable, doing
nothing and saying nothing, hoping the
symptoms pass.
It's the morning after. Questions
without answers stumble through my
mind. Why hasn't my date called me?
How did she get home last night? How
did / get home last night?
Formats, it seems, are a rite of spring.
Every sorority and fraternity, every ath
letic team and every campus organiza
tion — no matter how meaningless —
demands its own night on the town.
Indeed, there are so many formals that
most of them simply blend together.
Rarely is one night "special." Instead,
most are remarkably unremarkable.
Lots of alcohol, lots of people, lots of
damaged property.
The routine is comical. Despite the
best intentions of those in charge, most
of us forego romance and passion in
favor of drunken revelry. Let's face it,
who wants to go to the prom again? Hell,
not even your date. If she had her
druthers, she'd choose to stay on the bus
all night, just driving around, nursing
her two-gallon jug of Long Island Ice
Tea. Dinner? Dancing? Conversation?

Nope, these things waste quality drink
ing time. Just get her home, that's all
she asks.
And, somehow, there seems nothing
wrong with this.
But you do go to dinner anyway, if
only to give the night some semblance of
legitimacy. Tradition mandates it. A
table for eight at II Fornaio. Overpriced
pasta. Yuppie hell. Everyone pretends to
enjoy the food and the company, tem
porarily convincing each other that the
goal for the evening transcends just get
ting drunk.
After dinner, all eight pile into some
one's Honda Accord for the short drive
to Tresidder. He with morals or an
approaching midterm takes the keys for
the evening. Once back on campus, the
group crawls back out of the car, their
clothing only slightly more wrinkled
than before. Ties are loosened and sport
coats are tossed into the trunk. Baseball
hats are pulled from backpacks and
thrown onto the heads of both guys and
girls alike.
Like school children awaiting the
greatest field trip of their lives, the
horde of formal-goers crowds onto the
busses. Two by two, they find their seats
— arms loaded to the hilt with coolers,
cans, bottles, flasks and anything else
that holds their precious nectar. There
is still a sense of naivete, though,
entrenched in the hope that this formal

will somehow be different. A better loca
tion, perhaps, or a new set of people.
Of course, this rarely happens. There
is dancing and there is drinking, and —
when at the Miramar — there is swim
ming, too. More than likely, there's also
behavior that you'll regret later. The
"Dance Floor Mac" is a no-no, especially
when your date is watching it happen.
Break dancing, too, is highly overrated.
Somehow, every person in attendance
sees these things happen. Even if they
remember nothing else from the
evening, including their date's name,
they remember the fool making an idiot
of himself in front of everyone. Within a
day, most of the undergraduate popula
tion has heard of your dance floor
prowess, too.
The drive from San Francisco back to
campus is an alcohol-induced blur, and
memories of the formal itself never
quite make it to the brain. The ability to
judge the evening is limited to these
hazy recollections, stories from others
and any wounds found on the body. Ulti
mately, where we wake up the next day
— and in what state we wake up — are
the best indicators of how much fun we
had the night before.
