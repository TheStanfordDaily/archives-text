STS program should survive, and can if it's supported

BY NOW, EVERYONE has proba
bly heard about the decision not to
seek renewal of the Program in
Science, Technology and Society's
degree-granting authority. After hearing
the news, students organized quickly
around one goal — to save the STS
major — at any cost, was the gist of it.
This goal clearly had buzzword potential
— petitions emblazoned with "Save
STS!" were signed by students all over
campus; the ASSU Senate passed a reso
lution calling for just that. After nixing
the name YES-STS, organizers began e
mailing furiously to a list called (what
else?) "Save STS!"
In the joint faculty, student and
administrative effort to save STS, there
has been a sort of competition to see
what version of STS can be sustained in
the upcoming years. Through discus
sions, one fact has become clear — STS,
as an interdisciplinary program, poses
the same challenges to the traditional
disciplinary system that programs like
Human Biology did at their outset. Even
more problematic has been the fact that
STS, unlike any other major (or interdis
ciplinary program) offers both AB and
BS degrees, and that it also uniquely
stands at the juncture of not just two dis
ciplines, but two schools, Engineering
and Humanities and Sciences.
In an attempt to overcome these
obstacles, a number of alternative visions
have been proposed. As students prepare
to meet separately with Dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven and Dean of the School of Engi

neering James Gibbons this week to dis
cuss some these visions, several questions
have cropped up. Would STS be the same
if it belonged exclusively to one school, or
offered just one major? What about the
current program justifies and requires
that it be a major (and two majors at
that)? What about STS makes it STS?
Current students who are going through
the major have provided some clues.
Junior Andy Del Castillo decided to
major in STS because of his interest in
disability-access issues and the informa
tion revolution. Andy, who is blind, has
developed a curricula including advanced
computer science and communications
classes, hoping to learn how disability
access issues can be incorporated in the
initial design phase, not as an after
thought.
Coterminal student Jennifer Lee did a
really non-traditional concentration —
Language, Literature and Communica
tion, comprised of history, English, and
computer science classes. Jenn used her
major to explore the links between tech
nology and identity, specifically with
respect to computers, the subject of her
honors thesis.
Senior Gregg Osofsky is doing an
interdisciplinary honors thesis on the
language of risk assessment — applying
academic rigor to the issue of how to rec
oncile the descriptive language of risk
assessment (with its focus on objective
methods and techniques) with the nor
mative claims of justice (where conversa
tions are carried out in terms of rights
and entitlements).

While these curricula may sound fair
ly diverse, the intellectual pursuit of all
programs relies critically on dual techni
cal and social competence, student initia
tive and problem-solving skills. In these
endeavors, there is also a keen sense that
students are able to apply academic rigor
and analytical tools to issues that they
care about. How does this all fit into a
program plan? Perhaps through some of
these essential elements:
1. Interdisciplinary Competence.
These programs could not have been car
ried out in single-discipline settings.
Institutionally, access to classes, faculty
and departments of both schools would
be vital to any new program. Interdisci
plinary research is already happening
through programs like the Law School's
Law and Technology Program and the
Computer Science Department's
Human-Computer Interaction Program.
Access to both schools would not neces
sarily require interdisciplinary housing;
meaningful interaction with the School
of Engineering could be facilitated
through an STS program housed in the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
2. Writing, Critical Thinking and
Social Science Analytical Tools. The
existing eight-class STS core, which
every major must take, provides solid
critical-analytical skills. Its aim, to study
science and technology in society from
humanities, historical and social science
perspectives, is worth preserving.
3. Academic Opportunity. The opportu
nity for students to design their own the
matic concentrations and the more gener

al push for students to take initiative in
defining their own educational purpose is
perhaps one of the best things about STS.
In designing concentrations, students
seem to be seizing academic initiative and
seeking out Stanford's opportunities in
just the way University President Ger
hard Casper exhorts on the first page of
Stanford's new World Wide Web site.
4. A Major Department. The afore
mentioned elements comprise a intellec
tually rigorous program, which is not
easy to complete on the side or even as a
minor. Continuing to have both BS and
AB students in the program is critical,
providing a forced bridging of the so
called techie-fuzzie divide.
5. Faculty Involvement and Institu
tional Support. A high level of student
satisfaction with the academic opportu
nities provided by the existing program
have largely driven the student effort to
save STS. Perhaps just as STS has ironi
cally suffered for becoming too popular
with students, the major has suffered
from an abundance of strong but uncon
solidated faculty support. In some ways,
the STS program seems to represent a
public good to the University — a major
that everyone benefits from, but whose
care it is commonly assumed someone
else will take care of. Given that faculty
may retire or leave Stanford for various
reasons, the long term survival of STS
will depend on not individual faculty but
institutional support and commitment to
the program.
