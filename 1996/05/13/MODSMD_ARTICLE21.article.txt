## Sorry 'bout the mess, but that's technology for you

"Yeah, 1 guess you 're pretty screwed."
— My RCC, about 10 minutes ago.
IT'S EVERY COMPUTER owner's
fear. Only it happened to me just now.
Not you or someone who deserves it as
much as you do, but to me.
The damn thing crashed. My hard drive
took a nose dive into an empty pool, made
like a kite on a windless day, felled like an
erection when mom walks in. And the col
umn I was going to hand in just now was
among the victims.
Here's the story:
It's 5:50 something, Sunday evening,
just half an hour or so before my 6:30
deadline at The Daily, I get up to pee. It
happens. But I'm almost done with the
piece and I like the way it's going, so it's
okay.
I fmish, wash my hands, blow my nose,
return to my desk and scream. For where
once blazed a brilliant Word document
stands only a blankish screen with a scorn
ful bomb icon blinking, laughing at me,
mocking my melancholy. As if we lived in a
"Little Women" world and it was Amy and
I was Jo and my manuscript had just been
cast into the fire as some petty revenge for
me being older and having nicer hair.
A quick kibbitz with the RCC later — in

which he described, in that even-toned
mortician's voice, all the necessary
arrangements required to have the body
properly cared for — and I'm here, now, in
the computer cluster, in Powerbook pur
gatory, trying to compensate in half an
hour for what usually takes three to six
(yeah, I usually need about that long to
take a good eight or so entirely unrelated
theories and find some way to link 'em
together clean enough to make the whole
mess look like I whipped it out while read
ing Herb Caen on the pooper).
As far as the original ... no sense in
trying to recapture that now — it was too
convoluted to get it right twice. And I still
don't have the time to try: deadline's
approaching and, in case you never
noticed before, The Daily's far more inter
ested in function than form. Content'll get
sacrificed there for quality any day — Sun
days included.
So it seems I have a new challenge now.
A little game of Fill the Space. Make the
Deadline. Ramble as you will until the
appropriate length is achieved and try your
best along the way. Kind of like a frosh
English research paper, except I've read at
least half the books in my bibliography.
Well, what shall we talk about them?
Hmm?

A short treatise on how writing has
become the creation of information seems
appropriate. Think about it: when we stay
up 'til all hours hammering away at a key
board, what we work on is never so much
a paper as a document — characters
ordered, things saved and transferable.
In "Misery," when Annie makes Paul
burn his own manuscript, the poor
schmuck looks like he's torching a piece
of himself. Why? Because he didn't have
the damn thing backed up. But to some
one with a computer a manuscript is just
a copy — what counts is the file, the
information, the digitized list of zeros
and ones that encode our thoughts
brought to the screen. Very little tangible
about that.
And with our creativity so alienated
from the realm of the real, computer fail
ure has become the "my dog ate it" of the
'90s. Printer problems will get you an
extension. A hard drive crashed will get
you straight As and a single. Like if your
roommate commits suicide, only people
really do feel bad for you.
OK. I bitched about that — now what?
I need to fill up about 6,000 characters
worth of space here, what can I use?
Maybe more ellipses . .. yeah ... maybe
those'll . . . you know .. . take up some

space.... Right?
Truth be told, I'm a little sorry you
won't get to see what I'd originally
planned for you today. It was a fairly intel
ligent piece, if I say so myself. (Why not?
No one else can.) I took some Lacanian
theory, his concept of the imago — loosely
defined as an individual's idealized image
of him or herself — and applied it to aller
gy season. I questioned how one can keep
seeing the reflection of a 7-foot Batman in
the mirror in the face of pollen and Sel
dane and eye drops and sneezing fits and
all the other trappings of the nebbish. I
wondered which of the more fantastical
images I hold of myself I might truly be
able to manifest once May 15 comes, my
thesis goes and I get my life back.
And somewhere in there I swear I
worked in the sentence, "Dammit, if I had
a nickel for every Catholic who's told me
he's prayed to become Jesus incarnate, I'd
have about a $1.35 by now," but for the
life of me I can't remember how.
All in all it was a fine piece, if not a
touch disjointed. Certainly high-brow.
And now it's gone. Given as a libation to
the God of Microsoft Word documents,
along with, my RCC now tells me, all my
papers from sophomore year, a series of
poems about getting the clap, my grad

school application essays and, were it not
for my paranoid vigilance in backing up
the monstrosity each evening, the whole
of my honors thesis. Hail Bill Gates, unto
you I give the first-borns of my sheaves of
wheat — Selah!
Alright, I've got a question: What's up
with all those dumb-ass crane flies? You
know, those big dorky flyin' helicopter
bugs that pop up all over campus every
spring? Every time I see one and go to
smash its stupid legs off some putz stops
me and says, "Don't! It's a mosquito hawk
— they eat mosquitoes." Now far be it from
me to save any blood suckers, but are you
telling me that these idiots who do nothing
but bounce against the walls all day, who
can't even find their way out of corner are
gonna catch any mosquitoes? I say screw it
— squoosh 'em all. Any bug that I can peg
from across the room with a flip flop has no
business surviving as a species.
Okay quick character count ... there
— it seems I've done it. Half an hour and
I'm finished, ready to go. Not the greatest
bit ever put in our paper but certainly not
the worst.
Selah.

the monstrosity each evening, the whole
of my honors thesis. Hail Bill Gates, unto
you I give the first-borns of my sheaves of
wheat — Selah!
Alright, I've got a question: What's up
with all those dumb-ass crane flies? You
know, those big dorky flyin' helicopter
bugs that pop up all over campus every
spring? Every time I see one and go to
smash its stupid legs off some putz stops
me and says, "Don't! It's a mosquito hawk
— they eat mosquitoes." Now far be it from
me to save any blood suckers, but are you
telling me that these idiots who do nothing
but bounce against the walls all day, who
can't even find their way out of corner are
gonna catch any mosquitoes? I say screw it
— squoosh 'em all. Any bug that I can peg
from across the room with a flip flop has no
business surviving as a species.
Okay quick character count ... there
— it seems I've done it. Half an hour and
I'm finished, ready to go. Not the greatest
bit ever put in our paper but certainly not
the worst.
Selah.
