## Track finishes regular season on a high note 
### Sam Wang Contributing writer 
The Stanford track and field team wrapped
up its regular season last Friday with the Car
dinal Invitational at Cobb Track and Angell
Field.
Many of the Cardinal runners and throw
ers took the weekend off to rest up for the Pa

felt good. I felt I could have thrown 210 or 215,
but it just didn't happen.
"But to get into the Olympic Trials or even
the NCAAs this year, I have to look more
around [throws of] 212 to 214 [feet]."
Strand feels he needs to improve his per
formances to be able to compete with a strong
and deep group of hammer throwers next
week in Los Angeles.
"It's going to be tough just to make finals
because the Pac-10 is so strong in the ham

in the Pac-10, so it's going to take at least one
