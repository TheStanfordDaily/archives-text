## Track finishes regular season on a high note 
### Sam Wang Contributing writer 
The Stanford track and field team wrapped
up its regular season last Friday with the Car
dinal Invitational at Cobb Track and Angell
Field.
Many of the Cardinal runners and throw
ers took the weekend off to rest up for the Pa
cific 10 Conference Outdoor Track Champi
onships, to be held next week at UCLA. Only
athletes who needed to post last-minute qual
ifications or tune up for next week competed.
Though there was only one new qualifier to
come out of the meet, numerous Cardinal ath
letes improved their personal-best marks just
one week before Pac-lOs.
Junior Joe Newsum, who had established a
new personal best of 23 feet, 9-1/2 inches in
the long jump last weekend at Big Meet, ex
tended his career-best mark to 24-2 1/4, good
enough to qualify him for the conference
championships.
Meanwhile, hammer thrower Justin
Strand, who had already qualified provision
ally for the NCAA championships, unleashed
a personal-best throw of 207-10 to cap off the
regular season.
Despite his solid performance, Strand is
looking for even more out of himself.
"They were good throws and I was happy
with them," said the junior. "Anytime I throw
consistently up and around my best perfor
mance ever, it definitely brings confidence. I
felt good. I felt I could have thrown 210 or 215,
but it just didn't happen.
"But to get into the Olympic Trials or even
the NCAAs this year, I have to look more
around [throws of] 212 to 214 [feet]."
Strand feels he needs to improve his per
formances to be able to compete with a strong
and deep group of hammer throwers next
week in Los Angeles.
"It's going to be tough just to make finals
because the Pac-10 is so strong in the ham
mer. There are nine great hammer throwers
in the Pac-10, so it's going to take at least one
of my best throws to make the fi
nals."
On the women's side, sopho
more Heather Miller shaved al
most a half-second off her career
best in the 200, a race that she was
not originally slated for. Her time
of 23.78 was good enough to give
her second place.
"I wasn't going to run it, so I
wasn't really focusing on it," Miller
said. "I was trying not to make it a
big deal and I was looking at it like a
practice meet before the Pac- 10s."
Other notable achievements
this weekend included senior Mark
Fadil's performance in the 3,000-
meter steeplechase.

Fadil, who already has a NCAA
provisional qualifying time in the
event, lowered his career-best in
the event by running an 8:50.82.
Juniors Chris Buddin and Jim
rnie Johnson finished first in the
pole vault and the 400 meters, re
spectively.
On the women's side of compe
tition, senior Sue Demars and
sophomore Sami Jo Small fash
ioned a one-two finish in the dis
cus. Freshmen Jen Test and
Mandy Clayton and sophomore
Rhonda Witmer swept the triple
jump competition.
The season culminates for the
Stanford track team next week at
Pac-lOs. There, the Cardinal will
face its final test of the season as a
team when it goes up against a
tough Pac-10 field that includes
powerhouses UCLA and Oregon.
