# Water polo takes fifth place at nationals
## Cardinal looks ahead to next year after successful season on varsity level 
### Erin Bryla Contributing writer 
Judging by their performance at this weekend's
national championship tournament in Davis, you
might think the Stanford women's water polo team
coined the term "beginners luck." In a fitting end
ing to a very successful season, the Cardinal
women came away with a fifth-place finish in their
inaugural season as a varsity sport.
"I was really happy with [the fifth-place finish],"
said head coach Ben Quittner. "We went in seeded
fifth and we had some really good games. We were
consistent throughout the year."
Stanford opened Friday with an 11-4 victory
over Brown. The Bears were the only eastern team
the Cardinal women would face and they had little
trouble handling the squad from Rhode Island.
Freshman Lindsay Tam and Lindsay Welsh paced
the team offensively, as each found the net three
times.
"We came out really fired up and really strong.
We prepared ourselves well for our game against
[San Diego State]," said freshman Rachel Best.
Apparently, not well enough. In its final bracket
game, Stanford met the same fate against SDSU as
it had in the team's last meeting against its old
nemesis, an 8-7 overtime loss at the qualifier tour
nament two weeks ago. This time, the two teams
engaged in another close battle, and again the
Aztecs emerged victorious, 5-3. The Cardinal's ef
forts were highlighted by the play of freshman
goalkeeper Heather Crary.
Stanford faced UCLA on Saturday morning and
once again felt the wrath of the second-ranked Bru
ins, who handed the Cardinal a humiliating 8-1 de
feat. The Bruins proved overwhelming from the
outset, Finding the net five times in the first quar
ter alone and eight times before the Cardinal would
finally answer. Alice Cathcart scored Stanford's
lone goal late in the fourth quarter.
"We came out really timid; [the players | psyched
themselves out, so we were really tight," Quittner
said.
Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal found a little
relief in the form of UC-Santa Barbara, as it de
feated the Gauchos 8-7. Stanford led the entire way
and was tied with UCSB on only one occasion, late
in the second quarter.
The UCSB win guaranteed the Card a spot in the
fifth / sixth-place game against UC-Davis. Tam
opened the scoring when she took advantage of a
Cardinal fast break, and Cathcart added a goal be
fore halftime. In the second half, a 4-meter shot by
Best added to the lead, and a fast-break goal by

Welsh finished the scoring for Stanford. Despite
their strong offensive showing, defense was the
name of the game as the Cardinal came out on top,
4-1 and earned its spot among the top five teams in
the nation.
"I think it was a strong finish for us because we
are mostly freshmen, but next year we are definite
ly looking to be higher in the standings," Best said.
In the other final games, SDSU and Slippery
Rock battled it out for third place, while Cal and

UCLA met for the title.
The future looks bright for the Cardinal, as the
women lose no players to graduation and will be
gaining some of the most prized recruits in the na
tion. Next year's squad, however, will have some
tough shoes to fill. It will be difficult to top this
year's precedent-setting team.
"We matured together, we came together
throughout the season. I am really proud of [the
team] being fifth and working hard," Quittner said.
