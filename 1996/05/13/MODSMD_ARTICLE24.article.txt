The wins just keep on coming for
the ninth-ranked Stanford baseball
team.
After stumbling out to a 10-11
start in Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division play, things
looked bleak for a Cardinal squad
that had been ranked as high as No.
2 in the nation by some preseason
publications. However, since drop
ping three straight to USC on April
12-14, Stanford has been all but in
vincible, reeling off a string of victo
ries (including nine straight confer
ence wins) that allowed the team to
overtake UCLA for second place in
the Six-Pac.
They couldn't have picked a bet
ter time. Today, the NCAA will an
nounce which eight schools have
been selected as host sites for NCAA
Regionals, and the Cardinal's recent
hot streak may have helped nudged
Stanford over the borderline.
UC-Davis was the team's latest
victim yesterday afternoon at
Sunken Diamond, where the Cardi
nal earned a school record-tying
15th consecutive victory by pum
meling the Aggies 10-0.
Stanford now shares the school
record for most straight wins with
the 1990 club. The Cardinal (38-17
overall, 19-11 Six-Pac) can break
that mark tonight at 7 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond when it continues
a series of tune-ups for the NCAA
tournament by facing non-confer
ence opponent Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo.
Yesterday, it was freshman Jeff
Austin leading the way for head
coach Mark Marquess' The
right-hander from Kingwood, Tex.,
improved his record to 6-3, teaming
with relievers Tony Cogan, Josh
Koons and Brent Hoard to post a
four-hit shutout — the ninth of the
season for the Cardinal pitching
staff. Austin went six innings, al
lowing three hits and one walk while
striking out four.
Stanford also continued its re
cent offensive tear. The hot-hit
ting Cardinal broke the game wide
open by posting three runs in each
of the third, fourth and fifth in
nings to take a commanding 9-0
lead. Sophomore Jay Pecci and ju
nior Luke Quaccia had two RBIs
apiece on the afternoon, while
sophomore Jon Schaeffer added a

pair of doubles.
Sophomore Brad Sanfilippo had
three hits, including a double, to
pace the Aggies (34-22).
Stanford now anxiously awaits
word on whether it has been se
lected as one of the eight host sites.
The announcement will be made

today at noon.
If the Cardinal is selected as a
host site, regional action will begin
at Sunken Diamond on Thursday,
May 23, and run through Sunday,
May 26. Brackets will be announced
next Monday, May 20.
In the meantime, the Cardinal

will try to keep its win streak alive.
Sophomore ace Kyle Peterson (8-5,
3.80 ERA) will take the mound
tonight against Cal Poly-SLO's
Mike Zirelli. Stanford will then
match up against Nevada on
Wednesday night in its final regular
season game.
