# Women's golf earns a ticket to NCAAs
## Cardinal places seventh at regionals 
### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
Had the tournament lasted a
day or two longer, the Stanford
women's golf team might have
left the NCAA West Regionals
empty-handed. As it was, the
Cardinal found itself dropping
progressively in the team stand
ings during each round of the
three-day competition, sliding
from fifth to sixth to seventh
place over the final two days.
However, while the No. 7-
ranked Stanford women did not

in the 20-team field at Omaha
qualified for NCAAs, which kick

Stanford wound up 30
strokes behind No. 4 Arizona,
which overtook third-ranked
Arizona State and eighth
ranked Tulsa on the final day of
play, to take first place in the
competition. The Wildcats fin
ished with a 36-over-par 900,
five strokes ahead of second
place finisher San Jose State.
Top-ranked UCLA took third,
with Tulsa fourth, Arizona
State fifth and Texas sixth.
The Cardinal got off on the
right foot as it fired a nine-over
par 297 on Thursday, good for
fifth place overall. Meanwhile,
McKay and junior Andrea Bax
ter found themselves near the
top of the charts by shooting
identical rounds of even-par 72,
placing them in a six-way tie for
fifth place.
