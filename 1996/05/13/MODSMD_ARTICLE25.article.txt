# Women's golf earns a ticket to NCAAs
## Cardinal places seventh at regionals 
### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
Had the tournament lasted a
day or two longer, the Stanford
women's golf team might have
left the NCAA West Regionals
empty-handed. As it was, the
Cardinal found itself dropping
progressively in the team stand
ings during each round of the
three-day competition, sliding
from fifth to sixth to seventh
place over the final two days.
However, while the No. 7-
ranked Stanford women did not
finish as strongly as they might
have liked, their performance at
the par-72 Champions Club Golf
Course in Omaha, Neb. over the
weekend was more than good
enough to qualify them for
NCAA championships next
week. Only the top 10 finishers
in the 20-team field at Omaha
qualified for NCAAs, which kick
off May 22 in La Quinta, Calif.
As usual, junior All-Ameri
can Mhairi McKay led the way
for the Cardinal, shooting a

nine-over-par 225 to finish tied
for seventh among individuals.
Stanford wound up 30
strokes behind No. 4 Arizona,
which overtook third-ranked
Arizona State and eighth
ranked Tulsa on the final day of
play, to take first place in the
competition. The Wildcats fin
ished with a 36-over-par 900,
five strokes ahead of second
place finisher San Jose State.
Top-ranked UCLA took third,
with Tulsa fourth, Arizona
State fifth and Texas sixth.
The Cardinal got off on the
right foot as it fired a nine-over
par 297 on Thursday, good for
fifth place overall. Meanwhile,
McKay and junior Andrea Bax
ter found themselves near the
top of the charts by shooting
identical rounds of even-par 72,
placing them in a six-way tie for
fifth place.
Despite playing in less-than
ideal weather conditions (the
first round of play had been de-
layed two-and-a-half hours due to
rain), the women also put up re
spectable scores in Friday's second
round, notching a score of 312 —
the fourth-best round of the day.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal dropped
one spot in the team standings to
sixth place. McKay had another
sensational day, firing a 74 to move
her into a tie for fourth place indi
vidually.
With 30 strokes separating the
Cardinal and llth-place Texas
Tech at the end of two rounds, the
Stanford women found themselves
with a comfortable cushion enter

ing Saturday's third and final
round. Barring a total collapse,
Stanford would breeze to a top-10
finish and earn itself a free trip to
NCAAs.
"Collapse" would be a stretch,
but the Cardinal's third-round
score of 321 — the 12th-best team
score of the day — wasn't pretty. It
was, however, good enough to help
reserve the women a spot at
Quinta next week.
Other Cardinal finishers at
NCAA regionals included Baxter,
who finished with a 72-77-80—229
to finish tied for 16th, senior Julie
Bowen (76-80-80-236, tied for
35th), senior Vicky Strada (77-81-
82—240, tied for 45th) and fresh
man Michelle Sperry (80-92-85—
257, 95th).
