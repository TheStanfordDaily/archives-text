# Women's team rolls, men fall in Big Row

### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The Lambert Cup will stay right
here, thank you.
The Stanford women's crew
team crushed California this week
end and thus earned the right to
keep the Lambert Cup for another
season. Both the men's and
women's squads set Stanford course
records against Cal in the annual Big
Row, although the men fell a few sec
onds short of victory.
The Stanford women defeated
Cal by three boat lengths en route to
its six-minute, 35-second finish,
which eclipsed the old record by one
tick. The Cardinal showed a new
look at the start of the race, keeping
its stroke rate high for an extended
period of time and gaining a lead
within the first 500 meters. By the
1000-meter mark, Stanford had
pulled away to a two boat-length
lead.
During the third 500 meters,

Cardinal women's coxswain Nancy
Bergsteinsson called for a power 10
for the seniors. For 10 consecutive
strokes, the team rowed passionate
ly for its departing seniors. The crew
finished the race strong, sprinting in
the last stretch despite leading Cal
by a large margin. The course record
was on the minds of all the rowers.
"It was nice to see that we could
keep the power on even though we
weren't racing neck to neck," said se
nior captain Julie Lewczyk.
Stanford finished the regular sea
son undefeated in dual meet compe
titions. The only Pacific 10 Confer
ence school the Cardinal has not de
feated is Washington. The two
squads will undoubtedly face one an
other for the first time at the confer
ence finals in two weeks.
The junior varsity women also
pulled out a win, defeating the Gold
en Bears handily. The novice
women, however, faltered after
starting their race a little shaken.
During warm-ups, the Cardinal boat
brushed against theCalmen'sjunior
varsity boat. The women were
struck by the oars from the other
boat, receiving blows to their bodies
and faces.
Although none of the rowers was
seriously injured, the incident con
tributed to the Cardinal loss.
"I wasn't able to focus as well
after that," said freshman Katie
Sears. "But Cal will be surprised in a
couple weeks when we come back
and beat them fat the Pacific 10
championships]."
Despite setting a course record by
finishing in 5 minutes and 41 sec
onds, the Stanford men could not
overcome the powerful Cal squad.
Stanford stayed even with the Bears
during the opening 500 meters, but
at the 700-meter mark, Cal made its
move, eventually pulling out to a
seven- or eight-seat lead at 1100 me
ters. The Cardinal men fought back
valiantly, but could not catch up,
eventually losing by three seats.
The race left a bittersweet taste in
the mouths of the Stanford rowers,
who had hoped to row one of their
strongest races of the season against
the Bears. Indeed they did, but it was
disheartening to know that they still
fell a little short. Once they finished
the race, however, members of the
team focused on Pac-lOs and on
what they must do in order to defeat
the Bears the next time around.
"We didn't execute our race plan
as well as we could have," said senior
captain Rob Bigler. "We know we
can race better."
In 1993, Stanford rebounded
from a loss to Cal by coming back and
beating them in the Pac-10 competi
tion at the end of the season. The
squad hopes for a similar outcome
this year.
"We know we can do this," Bigler
said.
