# Speakers look at global markets
## GSB, Engineering sponsor Manufacturing Conference 
### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
Global markets and competition were the hot top
ics this weekend at the biannual 1996 Stanford Man
ufacturing Conference, co-sponsored by the School of
Engineering and the Graduate School of Business.
Held at the Business School on Friday night and
Saturday, the conference hosted an array of distin
guished speakers from academia and industry. Repre
sentatives came from a variety of companies, including
Hewlett-Packard, BMW, Caterpillar and Boeing and
from many parts of the world, including Europe and
Latin America.
"I think we were really quite successful in putting
together a panel of speakers," said Itay Bamford, a sec
ond-year graduate student pursuing a dual master's
degree in business and engineering. "They were people
who could really have an impact."
The 40 seminars offered on Saturday focused on a
wide range of topics related to manufacturingon a glob
al scale. For example, Mechanical Engineering Prof.
James Adams discussed the importance of designing
products which appeal to human senses and emotions.
"The stakes weren't nearly as high" for the United
States in the 1950s when there was less global compe
tition, but now it is imperative that companies incorpo
rate those design considerations into their products if
they are to succeed, he said.
In another seminar, Naushad Forbes, a consulting
associate professor in industrial engineering and direc

tor of Forbes Marshall, discussed India's potential both
as a manufacturing base for foreign firms and as a mar
ket for their products.
"I think combining those two can be very produc
tive," Forbes said.
The keynote addresses were delivered Friday night
and Saturday afternoon by Yotaro Kobayashi, chair
man and CEO of the Fuji Xerox Corp., and Edward
Hagenlocker, president of Ford Automotive Opera
tions.
The conference was only one of many efforts
which link Stanford's Business and Engineering
Schools. The schools offer a joint master's degree
program, and both schools work with industry
through the Stanford Integrated Manufacturing As
sociation.
"The conference was an extension of cooperation
between the two schools," Bamford said.
Organizers said about 350 people participated in
the conference. "The majority of the people were sent
by their companies," Bamford said.
The conference had a number of purposes. "We
wanted to raise the profile of manufacturing at the
Business School a little bit," said Adrian Masters, a
second-year business student and an event organizer.
Manufacturing at the global level is not discussed
enough at the school, he said.
According to Bamford, the conference showcased
Stanford's preeminence in business and engineering.
"The conference was a neat example of Stanford's
stature in technology management," Bamford said.
