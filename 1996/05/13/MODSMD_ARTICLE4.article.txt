U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell discussed what the GOP
must do to succeed in the upcoming presidential elec
tion before a group of students at Tresiddcr I "nion Sat
urday evening.
The informal gathering was hosted by the Stanford
College Republicans. Campbell, a Stanford law profes
sor, is a Republican who represents the 15th congres
sional district. He faces re-election in November.
Also present at the gathering was Stanford alum
nus and Silicon Valley businessman Ben Brink, who is
currently running for the 14th district congressional
seat.
Campbell emphasized the need for Republicans to
"build up their case" if they want to win a majority in
the House and Senate in November. "Instead of argu
ing about things, we need to present issues in which
we have inherent credibility," Campbell said.
He said the Republicans' winning arguments stem
from what they have done in the past and what they
will accomplish once elected.
Campbell also discussed the current political cli
mate in Washington, D.C. After the Whitewater pa
pers came to the public's attention, Democratic lead
ers agreed to support Clinton on the condition that he
would accept more liberal views, Campbell said.
The congressman then explained how Clinton's rat
ings in public-opinion polls went up after he shut down
the government due to an unbalanced budget. Camp
bell said the incident taught him something that is

only learned from experience.
"I have learned that if you particularize, you can
win against the general," Campbell said. "We can only
win if we particularize the good."

'Instead of arguing about
things, we need to present
issues in which we have
inherent credibility.'

The congressman discussed possible advertise
ments which would promote Republican ideology.
Campbell said he envisions ads with a "Get serious"
theme. For example, he suggested a slogan that would
read: "Get serious — which party is more likely to
make government smaller? Get serious. Vote Republi
can."
Campbell also mentioned a plan he has to raise
money so that the party could advertise throughout
the Bay Area.
Running as a moderate Republican, Campbell said
he hopes that Republicans continue to decrease the
size of the government, lower taxes — including re
moving the federal personal income tax — and "clean
up the act in Washington."
Campbell said he favors a na
tional consumption tax and ex
empting food, medicine and rent
over the federal personal income
tax. He said he would like to see an
advertisement with a 1040 tax
form burning up, with a message
that reads, "Who's more serious?
Vote Republican."
He fielded questions from the
audience after he spoke. When
asked about the minimum-wage
debate which is currently going
on in Washington, Campbell said
he was against raising the wage
despite the fact that many Repub
licans are in favor of increasing it.
"I am sorely troubled by my
Republican brothers and sisters
who desire to take jobs away from
the poorly skilled," he said.
Campbell explained that a
higher minimum wage hurts the
poor, the low-skilled and those en
tering the labor market. He said
he favors earned income tax cred
it which is subsidized by every
one.
"I have been for something in
stead of simply against something
else," Campbell said.
When asked about what stance
Republicans will have on abortion
during the campaign and election,
Campbell said he hopes the party
will build a platform from "ground
zero."
"We need to build a neutral
platform in San Diego (where the
Republican National Convention
will take place in July], plank by
plank, without a plank concern
ing abortion. We can vote without
exclusion and inclusion," he said.
Campbell concluded the
evening saying that he is opti
mistic that a moderate Republi
can party could win a majority in
November.
"Our party has wings. We must
tolerate differences if we're going
to win."
