U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell discussed what the GOP
must do to succeed in the upcoming presidential elec
tion before a group of students at Tresiddcr I "nion Sat
urday evening.
The informal gathering was hosted by the Stanford
College Republicans. Campbell, a Stanford law profes
sor, is a Republican who represents the 15th congres
sional district. He faces re-election in November.
Also present at the gathering was Stanford alum

currently running for the 14th district congressional
seat.
Campbell emphasized the need for Republicans to

bell said the incident taught him something that is

only learned from experience.
"I have learned that if you particularize, you can
win against the general," Campbell said. "We can only
win if we particularize the good."

'Instead of arguing about
things, we need to present
issues in which we have

The congressman discussed possible advertise
ments which would promote Republican ideology.
Campbell said he envisions ads with a "Get serious"
theme. For example, he suggested a slogan that would
read: "Get serious — which party is more likely to
make government smaller? Get serious. Vote Republi
can."
Campbell also mentioned a plan he has to raise
money so that the party could advertise throughout
the Bay Area.
Running as a moderate Republican, Campbell said
he hopes that Republicans continue to decrease the
size of the government, lower taxes — including re
moving the federal personal income tax — and "clean
