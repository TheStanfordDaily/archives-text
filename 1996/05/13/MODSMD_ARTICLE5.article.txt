# Rice begins work on frosh seminars
## Provost says hiring will begin in fall 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
Work on the three-year plan
ning cycle for the new freshman
seminar program will begin as
early as this week, according to
Provost Condoleezza Rice.

The seminar
program, titled
"Stanford Intro
ductory Stud
ies," was un
veiled by Univer
sity President
Gerhard Casper
at Thursday's
Faculty Senate
meeting.

Seeking to combine the
strength of 20 new faculty mem
bers and a small class setting, the
program will create something
that "speaks to every freshman
that comes to Stanford," Rice said
in an interview Friday.
Rice said she hopes to have the
first classes up and running by the
fall of 1997 and have the program
fully operational by 1999. She out
lined the basic structure of the
oversight of the project, saying she

will draft planning guidelines for
the department chairs, who will in
turn contribute their evaluations
to the school deans.
From there, the dean of each
school will submit the plans to an
advisory panel chaired by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation Ramon Saldi'var, which
will hand back a "total picture" to
Rice and Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven.
The advisory board, created
specifically to help with the semi
nar planning, is called the Univer
sity Advisory Board. Its members
include Materials Science and En
gineering Prof. John Bravman,
Assoc. Geological and Environ
mental Science Prof. Jonathan
Stebbins, Vice Provost and Dean
for Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds and Assoc. Psychology
Prof. Anne Fernald. Physics Prof.
Doug Osheroff will act as a facul
ty-at-large member.
Realistically, said Rice, serious
planning will not get under way
until the fall, when the hiring


Rice
process will begin on a rolling basis.
Competition for the 20 new fac
ulty billets should be fierce, Rice
said. She explained that in compil
ing reports, departments will be
examining such things as the cur
rent teaching loads for faculty and
the kinds of classes offered.
"Nobody wants to undermine
the ability of departments to offer
small classes, but some may be too
small. I would expect departments
to look at what the faculty are
teaching," Rice said.
She added that the project
should generate "more of a teach
ing plan for the departments,"
providing "maximum flexibility in
accordance with what the faculty
are already doing."
"It may ultimately result in less
choice for individual faculty mem
bers, but a lot of choice for depart
ments," Rice added.
Rice noted that new faculty
will be hired on the same basis
as other faculty at Stanford,
that is, according to research
and teaching proficiency and the
ability to fit into a particular de
partment.
The new graduate fellowships,
also announced by Casper on
Thursday, will work in tandem

with the freshman seminars, Rice
said. Faculty will not have to
spend as much time searching for
financial support for their gradu
ate students and can look for "co
herence in the program."
The configuration of the new
seminars in relation to Cultures,
Ideas and Values should be decid
ed by next spring, Rice said, when
the CIV Commission presents its
report to the senate.
The planning cycle is already
being incorporated into Universi
ty budget planning, Rice said.
Planning is now in the "very
very initial stage," Saldi'var said.
He expressed confidence that the
format of small classes taught by
faculty "can be tremendously suc
cessful."
"I think that goes a long way.
Our experience with the sopho
more dialogues has shown us ex
actly that. Of course, you've got to
have enthusiastic students who
want to do it,"he said.
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni, a
member of the senate, expressed
enthusiasm for the program but
remained skeptical about what he
called "tangible" results.
"I'd like to know what are the
objectives of the program, beyond
small classes," Simoni said. "I
think it's fabulous. Anything that
generates 20 new faculty is a good
thing. I just want to see what
shape it takes," he said.
