## Provost says hiring will begin in fall 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
Work on the three-year plan
ning cycle for the new freshman
seminar program will begin as
early as this week, according to
Provost Condoleezza Rice.

The seminar
program, titled
"Stanford Intro
ductory Stud
ies," was un
veiled by Univer
sity President
Gerhard Casper
at Thursday's
Faculty Senate
meeting.

Seeking to combine the
strength of 20 new faculty mem
bers and a small class setting, the
program will create something
that "speaks to every freshman
that comes to Stanford," Rice said
in an interview Friday.
Rice said she hopes to have the
first classes up and running by the
fall of 1997 and have the program
fully operational by 1999. She out
lined the basic structure of the
oversight of the project, saying she

will draft planning guidelines for
the department chairs, who will in
turn contribute their evaluations
to the school deans.
From there, the dean of each
school will submit the plans to an
advisory panel chaired by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation Ramon Saldi'var, which
will hand back a "total picture" to
Rice and Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven.
The advisory board, created
specifically to help with the semi
nar planning, is called the Univer
sity Advisory Board. Its members
include Materials Science and En
gineering Prof. John Bravman,
Assoc. Geological and Environ
mental Science Prof. Jonathan
Stebbins, Vice Provost and Dean
for Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds and Assoc. Psychology
Prof. Anne Fernald. Physics Prof.
Doug Osheroff will act as a facul
ty-at-large member.
Realistically, said Rice, serious
planning will not get under way
until the fall, when the hiring
