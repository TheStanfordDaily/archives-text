### Angel Flores 
Chosen for excellence and
breadth of undergraduate acade
mic accomplishments, 216 juniors
and seniors have been elected to
Phi Beta Kappa.
"It's a great honor to be select
ed and it was something that came
to me as a surprise," said junior
Serg Troie.
Ten percent of the graduating
class are elected to Phi Beta
Kappa. Of this number, one
fourth were chosen in their junior
year, the remainder in their senior
year. This year, the number of stu
dents is slightly higher than last
year's only because the graduating
class is larger, according to Direc
tor of the Center for Teaching and
Learning Michele Marincovich,
secretary of the Phi Beta Kappa
Stanford chapter.
"It's always nice to get recognized
by a group that is made up of talented
people," said Mark Blumling, senior
and recently elected member.

The academic records of all stu
dents are automatically reviewed
for selection. The Registrar's Of
fice supplies the selection commit
tee with transcripts after the stu
dents' names have been removed
in order to ensure anonymity. The
selection committee then votes on
the elected according to their tran
scripts. To be elected to the chap
ter at Stanford, a student must at
tain academic distinction in their
major along with other courses
across a broad range of fields.
"I was pleased to receive this
distinction because it recognizes
accomplishments on a broad range
of subjects. It proves that I've
reached my goal to be well-round
ed," said senior Sean Neal.
The selection committee is
composed mostly of Phi Beta
Kappa members which are usually
seniors, graduate students, facul
ty and staff, as well as departmen
tal Phi Beta Kappa representa-
tives, according to Marincovich.
"A tremendous amount of time
is given by the students and facul
ty to the selection process. It's a
process that is thorough and care
fully done," Marincovich said.
The country's oldest academic
society, Phi Beta Kappa was found
ed in 1776 at the College of William

and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. Its
purpose has been to cultivate and
recognize excellence achieved in
the liberal arts and the sciences.
"Phi Beta Kappa is a society that
seems to be reaching for reputable
goals and keeping up with intellec
tual society. It's neat to have a na
tional society to keep up with the
intellectual society," Neal said.
The names of those students
elected to Phi Beta Kappa will be
published in an advertisement in
The Daily tomorrow
