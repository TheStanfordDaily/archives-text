# 'Van Harvey is a presence'
## Religious studies professor retires 
### Pascale Goupillaud 
Religious Studies Prof. Van Harvey does not like to
talk about his accomplishments. Luckily, there are
many other people to talk about them for him.
"Van Harvey is a presence. I le's not just a voice
transmitting information," said Arnold Eisen, associ
ate professor of religious studies and a former student
of Harvey's. "When you're in Van's class, there's a per
son there to be reckoned with."
Such praise from students and colleagues shows
how much Harvey will be missed when he retires at the
end of spring quarter, after 18 years at Stanford. At
Commencement, Harvey will be honored with the
Dean's Teaching Award, one of Stanford's highest hon
ors for a professor.
Additionally, in honor of Harvey's retirement, the
Religious Studies Department is holding a convention,
titled "Historians and Believers at Century's End: A
Symposium in Honor of Van A. I larvey," on Sunday be
ginningat9a.m. at the Humanities Center Annex. The
symposium will feature leading scholars of Christian
thought and philosophy of religion.
"The idea was to mark the occasion by gathering to
gether people who have been influenced by Van. If
you're in the field of religious studies, you wrestle with

issues of faith. Van has always
wrestled with these issues, and lie
has had a great impact on many
people in this field," said Eisen.
Eisen is one of those whose life
has been influenced by I larvey. As a
student at the University of Penn
sylvania, Eisen said he had never
seriously considered teaching as a
future profession.
"Van once asked me if I had ever
thought of being a professor. I
replied, 'What, and waste my life?'
because I thought that the ivory
tower was an avoidance of real life,"
said Eisen. "IBut] Van taught me
that the world of ideas was a world
where you could change people, and
that teaching was a great way to do
that."
Harvey is also respected for his
ability to make complex religious is

sues applicable to his students'
lives.
"Van takes really profound reli
gious concepts and makes them rel
evant and clear to students," said
Elizabeth Ewing, a graduate stu
dent in religious studies. "He is a
very funny, lovely, warm and won
derful person and a great scholar as
well."
Harvey entered the life of schol
arship after serving in the Navy
during World War II and then grad
uating from Occidental College in
Southern California with a degree
in philosophy in 1948. He subse
quently received his doctorate from
Yale University and began teaching
at Princeton University before
moving to Pennsylvania in 1968.
I larvey was chairman of the Re
ligious Studies Department at
Pennsylvania from 1968 until
1978, when he accepted a position
at Stanford.
"I was a little discouraged about
Penn. I didn't think it was doing

very well in the humanities, and
Stanford had the best Religious
Studies Department on the West
Coast," Harvey said. "I thought it
looked like a fine opportunity, and
besides, my wife and I are both West
Coast people."
At Stanford, Harvey has taught
courses such as "From Kant to
Kierkegaard," "Friedrich Niet
zche" and"The Nature of Self." I Ie
teaches courses that deal primarily
with modern Christian thought,
both Protestant and Catholic, and
has also taught the third quarter of
the Humanities Cultures, Ideas
and Values track.
"I focus mainly on modern Euro
pean religious thought since the
Enlightenment, specializing in
German religious thought," said
Harvey.
Harvey has also written several
books, including "The Handbook of
Theological Terms," which has not
been out of print since 1966. One of
his most famous books, which will

be republished this year, is a book
titled "The Historian and The Be
liever," which deals with the way in
which Christian faith is affected by
historical discoveries about the life
of Jesus.
" 'The Historian and The Believ
er' is one of the classics in the field
of religious studies," said Eisen.
"You can't teach contemporary reli
gious thought without it."
I larvey also wrote a book titled
"Feuerbach and the Interpretation
of Religion," which was published
recently.
After his retirement, Harvey
plans to continue reading and writ
ing, ;us well as practicing playing the
jazz piano. He and his wife will stay
in the Stanford area, although
those who know him claim they will
still feel his absence.
"Van provides a very clear exam
ple of how one should behave as a
professor and as a person. He is ir
replaceable, and he will be sorely
missed next year," said Ewing.
