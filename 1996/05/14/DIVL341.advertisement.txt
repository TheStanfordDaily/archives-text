Is that a good thing? Maybe we ought to rephrase
\the question: What do you use to launch your
online adventures? If you had MSN's Custom Start
Page, all the stuff you like best and all the things
you need most would be right there, right in front
of you. Web links and search engines, headline
news, movie previews — even comic strips.
You pick what you want and forget the rest.
www.msn.com. It's all that and, uh.. .more.
Www, msn. com/farm. htm
Our cool site is your Custom Start Page.
