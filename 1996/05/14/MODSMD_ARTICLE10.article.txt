Supreme Court strikes down ban on liquor ads
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court, in a decision that might hamper Pres
ident Clinton's effort to limit cigarette advertising, yesterday struck down Rhode
Island's ban on ads that list or refer to liquor prices.
A unanimous court said the ban, aimed at promoting sobriety, violates free-speech
rights. The ruling also gave other commercial speech greater protection against gov
ernment regulation.
The full impact of the ruling, spelled out in four separate opinions, likely will not be
known until lower courts begin to interpret it.
But the ruling marked the high court's strongest statement against regulating com
mercial speech since a landmark 1975 decision that extended to advertising the First
Amendment's free-speech guarantee.
Test may detect Alzheimer's disease
WASHINGTON (AP) — A new laboratory test of blood and skin cells offers promise
for early detection of Alzheimer's disease, a fatal brain disorder that now cannot be
positively diagnosed until after death.
The test could provide a way to determine if severe memory loss is due to
Alzheimer's or to a treatable disorder, said Dr. Jay 11. Robbins, a National Cancer
Institute researcher who led a team that developed the test.
"This test could be useful in identifying the disease absolutely in patients who are
diagnosed as probable Alzheimer's disease," said Robbins. "Many people who have
blood relatives with the disease might want to know. The decision, for instance, could
be important for family planning."
So far, the test has only been conducted experimentally with frozen cells from a few
dozen patients, Robbins said.
