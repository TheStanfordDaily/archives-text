# Flight data recorder recovered
## Workers continue collecting plane parts, human remains 
### 
MIAMI (AP) — With a sharpshooter
scouting for alligators and poisonous
snakes, recovery workers yesterday recov
ered the flight data recorder from ValuJet
Flight 592, along with disintegrated plane
parts and human remains no bigger than
a knee.
Workers brought in heavy equipment,
teams of divers walked side by side,
searching the murky swamp inch by inch,
and Navy salvage specialists used sonar
to look for the plane's black box
recorders.
The data recorder, which could yield
clues to the cause of the crash, was being
taken to National Transportation Safety
Board headquarters in Washington for
analysis. NTSB spokesman Mike Benson
said he did not know the condition of the
recorder.
Benson said he was not sure whether
the cockpit voice recorder had been recov
ered.
By midday seven body bags of remains
had been removed.
"I don't hold any hope we'll find any
recoverable large parts of people," said

retired Dade County Medical Examiner
Joseph Davis, who is taking part in the
investigation.
Victims' relatives grew restive.
"They should have had a crane or a
radar or something. They've got that kind
of equipment," said Raquel Perry, daugh
ter-in-law of crash victim Wilhemina
Perry of Miami. "By the time they get out
there, with those alligators and stuff,
she'll be all ate up."
The Atlanta-bound DC-9 crashed Sat
urday shortly after takeoff from Miami's
airport with 104 passengers and five crew
members. The crew radioed urgently
about smoke in the cockpit and cabin
before the tower lost contact.
Investigators said the recovery of the
wreckage would be slow because of the
difficult conditions: heat in the mid-80s,
swarms of mosquitoes and horseflies,
razor-sharp sawgrass, and water 6 inches
to 5 feet deep over mud that some locals
estimate is 30 to 40 feet deep.
"This is tough stuff out there," Nation
al Transportation Safety Board vice chair
man Robert Francis said.

ValuJet Airlines stock dropped sharply
yesterday, the first day of trading since
the crash and also the first day of intensi
fied federal scrutiny of the Atlanta-based
carrier. It closed on the Nasdaq Stock
Market down $4.18 3/4 a share at $13.68
3/4.
At the scene yesterday, about 30 divers
in rubberized suits to protect them from
skin-irritating jet fuel widked through the
water in shifts that lasted only 15 to 20
minutes because of the grueling condi
tions. A marksman accompanied them to
watch for alligators and water moccasins.
The searchers filled bags with aircraft
parts imd human remains that Metro-
Dade police Cmdr. A 1 Harper said were no
bigger than a knee.
"They're actually recovering fingers
and hands and feet," Harper said. "It
would be traumatic for even the most sea
soned homicide detective."
Davis cautioned that it could take up to
a week to identify victims and that some
might never be identified. A forensic
anthropologist and a forensic dentist will
help the medical examiner's office.
