## Editorial CIV and seminars 
### 
President must not put
too many requirements
into frosh curriculum

IN A MUCH-BALLYHOOED
speech before the Faculty Sen
ate Thursday, University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper unveiled a
major new initiative for under
graduate education entitled "Stan
ford Introductory Studies." Con
ceived as a way to increase contact
between "regular" faculty and
freshmen, Stanford Introductory
Studies essentially boils down to a
required freshman seminar. And
while attempts to increase student
interaction with professors ought
to be applauded, any new required
course should be subjected to
strict scrutiny.
Recognizing that Stanford
freshmen should not be burdened
with an additional required
course, Casper suggested that "we
can make room for this course by
linking it to a current requirement
— such as CIV or Writing and
Critical Thinking — or by allowing
freshman seminars to meet an
existing distribution require
ment." The precise relation of
Stanford Introductory Studies to
other first-year requirements is to
be worked out by next spring. So
far, the configuration most widely
suggested is also the most worri
some, namely the replacement of
the third quarter of CIV with the
required seminar.
Unless its goals are radically
recast, CFV should not be short
ened to two quarters. As every
freshman knows, the pace of CIV
is already dizzying as instructors
fumble to cover three thousand
years of culture in three quarters.
To condense CIV to two quarters
would be to make a mockery of the
whole idea of exposing freshmen to
a wide range of cultures, ideas and
values. ClV's purpose demands a
full academic year. If the Universi

ty is not committed to a serious
year-long humanities introduc
tion, then CIV should be made
optional. The University would be
doing a great disservice to future
freshmen if it mandated merely a
watered-down CIV
CIV was created in the wake of a
very public debate over the previ
ous Western Civilization require
ment, and it has been a lightning
rod of criticism ever since. CIV has
its critics on the left, right and
almost everywhere in between. It
is no secret that some CIV tracks
are more demanding than others.
Having served almost a decade as
the Area One distribution require
ment, CIV is due for a comprehen
sive review. Currently, a special
CIV Commission is charged with
that task. It is to present their
findings by spring quarter of the
next academic year, and they
should be allowed to deliberate
without pressure to compromise
ClV's length.
Casper's suggestion that stu
dents be allowed to fulfill other
DRs through the Stanford Intro
ductory Studies seminars appears
to be the most sensible. For
instance, if a student took a semi
nar in African history, then he or
she would simultaneously fulfill
the World Cultures distribution
requirement. This would allow
CIV and Writing and Critical
Thinking to perform their func
tions unencumbered by additional
requirements; it would leave
freshmen free of yet another DR,
and it would still accomplish the
laudable goal of giving freshmen a
real seminar experience.
College curriculums always lie
on a balance between breadth and
depth. Stanford's DR system cou
pled with its strong major pro
grams makes sure that every stu
dent achieves both a broad-based
liberal arts education and special
ized knowledge in one discipline.
A strong year-long CIV require
ment coupled with a serious
freshman seminar would strike
just the right balance for first
vear students.
