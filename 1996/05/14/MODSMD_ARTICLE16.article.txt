## Beware of the "small dish" 
### 
£ TT'S CALLED THE Crustacean,
I Susannah said. "It's a seafood restau
-Lrant that serves Chinese food."
"Is that a pun?" I asked. "Crust-Asian?
Or more like the Rusty Barnacle?"
The Fates cursed my glib words. We were
only an hour late when we walked into the
restaurant, on our way to the boat dance.
Delicately sponged walls in shades of blue,
coral displays and green glass plunged us
underwater. Trickling water echoed faintly.
The setting sun, slanting through the win
dow, was the only depth marker.
A woman smiled at us, with a special nod
reserved for minors. "Are you going to the
prom?"
Formal dresses and suits, multiplied by
Asian youthfulness, had taken us from
whence we came, back to the days of teeny
bopper yore.
"No, we're in college," I said.
"Oh," she sniffed. "A college with a
prom. " She didn't bother finishing her sen
tence.
Time and tide wait for no man. Since we
were in danger of literally mussing the boat,
we perused the menu in the lounge. The
menu did not list appetizers or entrees.
Instead, we had our choice of a "small dish"
or "large dish." Tiny type at the bottom of
the page advised — warned — that the
small dishes should be accompanied with
rice or noodles or garlic bread. I was wary of
this proviso.
"How big is the small dish?" I asked the
maitre'd. He made a vague motion with his

hands. His silence was menacing. We all
cowered and ordered according to direc
tions, except for Susannah, who opted only
for an exotic-sounding "small dish."
"Are you sure you don't want a side dish
too?" I asked. "This should be enough," she
said.
The food arrived. We surveyed the
exquisitely presented dishes, sparse as a Zen
garden. None of us had eaten much all day,
in anticipation of this treat. At least the rest
of us had normal-sized plates. Four wan
tons, delicately flavored with denizens of the
deep, perched on a tiny dish in front of
Susannah. All of us commenced eating
slowly.
After a few moments, she was finished.
"I think I'll get some garlic noodles," she
said. She told the bemused waiter, who
seemed to know that this was going to hap
pen all along.
A large bowl of white rice appeared on
the table along with the noodles.
"Did we order this?" Jerry said. "Maybe
it comes with the meal." We looked around.
None of the other tables had rice. Our wait
er had taken pity on us, starving youths clad
in velvet and wool.
I settled back, chewing contemplatively.
My sleeve suddenly snapped ofT and flew
over my shoulder. All semblance of elegance
mid dignity ended in that moment. I clapped
my hand to my shoulder, caught in a per
petual pledge of allegiance. 1 remembered
my dear friend who had borrowed my dress
lone aw). She had altered the sleeves "just a

bit" by reattaching the straps with large
clumsy stitches.
"1 have a pair of scissors on my key
chain," Susannah laughed. "We could cut
ofTthe other sleeve."
"We are not pulling a Mentos commer
cial," I said.
We went off in search of a safety pin. She
put her arm around my shoulder in loving
embrace, to hold down my sleeve.
We approached the maitre d', who was
smoothly directing several groups of
patrons.
"Do you have a safety pin?" I asked qui
etly, during a lull. A mysterious Asian
woman appeared. "Wait here," she said, and
disappeared into a hidden panel.
We tried to lean casually against the wall,
with a certain je ne sais quoi. She reap
peared and handed us a bobby pin and a
straight needle. Add some foam core and
then we'd be in ME 101, trying to loft fruit
above a mine field. She gingerly reattached
the scrap of satin. I tried not to breathe as
we walked back to the table.
"How's everything holding up?" the
waiter said. "Fine," we answered in unison.
I picked up the fork with my left hand. The
sleeve sprang off again with vicious force.
"Check please," I said.

Vanessa Hua isn't funny. Funny things
happen to her.
