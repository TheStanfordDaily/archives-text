Attack on conservatism unfounded, emeritus prof, says

AN ANTIDOTE TO Romesh Rat
nesar's sneering phillipic against
conservatism in Wednesday's
Daily was in Nick Thompson's nearby
column which said, essentially, "open
up."
No amount of verbal hijinks can mask
the following facts:
As George Will, Cokie Roberts, et al.
agreed on "This Week with David Brink
ley" recently, conservatism itself is on
the steady rise in this country, where
only 17 percent of the population calls
itself liberal. Even President Clinton has
moved to the center, witness his State of
the Union statement, "The era of big
government is over."
The reason conservatism is now the
voting-majority position is that the
essence of an advanced civilization is
balance, of the sort our founding fathers
provided in our Constitution. Aristotle s
definition of the "virtuous person '
exactly the same as James Q. Wilson s: a
nexus of "golden means" at the core of a
circle of criss-crossing excess-deficiency
polarities.
The essentially middle-class, civilized
posture of decorum needs with cultural
vision, including the sacred, intuition,
imagination, art, the explosive fact of
the recurrence of extremes and the gen

erally ego-surpassing; awareness of our
vulnerability to luck ("fate") and tragic,
"existential" reality, such as catastroph
ic failure, sickness and death. Good con
servatives, like our founding fathers
(e.g., Madison), are rooted in the lucid
and unsentimental vision of high cul
ture, Hebraic or Greek.
A sense of humor is useful to wise
understanding and survival when con
trol breaks down. The pat ideological
Panglossian view of liberals becomes,
precisely, funny in the light of this big
scenario. Accordingly, our most dazzling
literary minds over the centuries have
always been conservative.
Lionel Trilling tried to convince us
that "the liberal imagination" was now
in charge, but the claim fizzled, even for
him, soon after the '60s. Today, who can
match Will, Krauthammer, Podhoretz
and the Kristols as culture critics? Who
are the equals of Milton Friedman,
Robert Conquest, Eric Voegelin, on the
main campus?
Our leading novelists, Bellow and
Updike, are not only conservative but
believers; the greatest of our 20th-centu
ry poets are all in that traditional mode
of excellence. Even Camus, my own
modern favorite, turned away from the
chic nihilist "absurd" to the explicitly

embraced "sacred" and a resolute
attachment to the classic French writ
ers.
Because of the very superiority of
their attitude, conservatives are not apt
to be crowd-pleasers, particularly in a
time of promiscuous "motor-voting,"
rampant illiteracy, sound bites and nar
row, sensational partisanship like Rat
nesar's. A glib opportunist like Clinton
has a much better chance at being all
things to all people and flattering senti
mental and self-deceptive notions of
what it takes to survive and flourish on
this planet with unspoiled and disci
plined competition rising on all sides.
You might think a university faculty
and student body population would have
a deep and long-range perspective on all
this. But the grim fact of our time is
that they don't even seek one. They
often won't even read the canonic writ
ers who might open their minds to abid
ing human realities. They circle their
wagons intellectually and hitch them to
the pale star of egalitarian mediocrity.
Imagine telling a champion runner,
"You are no longer to aim to shave a few
seconds off the world record; rather, add
some so that the other runners will feel
good." No more "go for the gold." That
hopelessly futile attitude has brought it

about that seven out of 10 Americans
think that higher education is a bad bar
gain. William Simon, writing in The
Wall Street Journal, persuasively claims
that students like that mediocrization
and dumbing-down because it takes
pressure off them. The administration
likes it because it raises the retention
rate. The faculty likes it because they
can put more energy into their personal
research. The parents, as I noted, resent
the whole disgusting deal and the
$100,000 or so it is costing them.
Which is largely why the superb nov
elist Cynthia Ozick identifies the 20th
century as "the rottenest yet." Why Alis
tair Cook sees disaster for the whole
West, particularly for his beloved adopt
ed country, the United States, because
of its silly liberal-fostered permissive
ness. Why a visiting scholar informed
me that a friend of his who is a Silicon
Valley CEO will not hire any Americans,
because their general culture is so poor.
Already, nearly 50 percent of hires in
engineering are foreign.
Pity the conservatives? Pity the cari
bou driven from the Alaskan oil fields?
Pity the snickering youths who may
have no jobs. Or sustaining faith.
