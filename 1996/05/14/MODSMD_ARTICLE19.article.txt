QmHow do refrigerators work ?
A They make things cold. That's it.
• Next question.
Q 9 No, really, where does all the heat
go ? C'mon, tell me!
A OK. Fine. But it's not going to be
• pretty. Basically, the cooling pail
• of a refrigerator has three parts, a
compressor, a condenser and an evapora
tor. These parts are linked in a cycle, and
they all act on a coolant. In the first com
mercially viable refrigerators, ammonia
was the coolant. The bad thing about using
ammonia as the coolant was that if any
thing went wrong with the refrigerator, the
ammonia smelled really bad and if enough
of it got out, it could kill.

Later, refrigerator makers switched to
synthetic chemicals for coolants. The most
well-known of these chemicals were the
freons. Freons are typically colorless, odor
less, nonflammable, noncorrosive and only
toxic in very high quantities. The use of
freons, and other chlorofluorocarbons
came under attack recently because of con
cerns over their effects on the ozone layer.
This was a big deal because if the ozone
layer disappeared, then air conditioning
would be the least of our problems. Today,
many refrigerator manufacturers have
switched to chemicals which pose less of a
threat.
But back to the refrigeration part. Since
the refrigeration process is a cycle, it's hard
to say where it starts. It's sort of like saying
that "Bankrupt" is the first space on the
Wheel of Fortune. Arbitrarily, I'll start
with the compressor.
The aptly named compressor compress
es the coolant to a high pressure. If you
remember your chemistry, this increase in
pressure causes the temperature of the
coolant to go up. The compressed coolant is
then forced into the condenser, which is the

assembly of tubes on the back of your
refrigerator. The air around the back of
your refrigerator serves to remove some of
the heat from the coolant passing through
the condenser.
The coolant is then pushed through a
valve into an area of much lower pressure,
the evaporator. This special valve between
the condenser and the evaporator keeps the
pressures in the two sections different.
Since the coolant is now at a lower pres
sure, it cools down drastically. The evapo
rator leads the coolant through the inside of
the refrigerator. Here, the coolant absorbs
heat and then passes into the compressor
again.
It seems so simple, right? The coolant
absorbs heat from inside the refrigerator,
gets pressurized, releases the heat into a
warmer area outside the refrigerator, gets
depressurized, goes back into the refrigera
tor and absorbs more heat, to start the pro
cess over again. Well, yeah, basically that's
it.
That's not all, though! If I were teaching
you the basics of refrigerator repair, that's
where I would stop. But I'm not, and I

promised it would get messy.
Theoretically you might be wondering,
why do we need to plug the refrigerator into
the wall? Why does it take energy to move
heat from inside the refrigerator to outside
the refrigerator, but not to do the opposite?
The answer lies in thermodynamics.
The first law of thermodynamics says that
energy is conserved. Almost everyone
knows this one. The second law is the one
we really need to be concerned about. It
says that the entropy of a system never goes
down. Of course, this means nothing to you
if you don't know what entropy is.
Entropy is a measure of disorder. This
seems like a pretty stupid idea because dis
order seems like a pretty hard thing to mea
sure. I mean, who's to judge what's disor
dered and what's not? Just because my
papers, books and other personal belong
ings are scattered around the floor, it
doesn't mean I'm any less of a person! Give
a guy a break, people!
Sorry. Really, though, scientists have
developed the concept of entropy to explain
why certain things happen and other
things don't. Consider a glass of hot water

with some ice cubes in it. Obviously, the ice
cubes will melt and cool the water. But why
doesn't warm water spontaneously convert
itself into hot water and ice? This is because
there is less order in the warm water. In the
case of the hot water and ice cubes, the dif
ference in temperature between the ice and
water represents an ordering of energy.
Heat Ls transferred from the water to the
ice cubes to reduce the order in the system.
So, just moving heat from inside your
refrigerator to the outside decreases
entropy and this is bad. The refrigerator
gets around this by adding more heat to
outside the refrigerator than it takes from
the inside. This increases the entropy out
side the refrigerator more than the amount
of entropy lost from the transfer of heat out
of the refrigerator. That's also why the
refrigerator needs an external source of
power.
If you didn't understand that, that's all
right. It's just a disordered mess of words to
me, too.
