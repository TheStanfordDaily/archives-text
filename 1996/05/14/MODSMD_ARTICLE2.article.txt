# Bon Appetit workers intend to form union
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Seeking better benefits and job security,
food service workers for Bon Appetit, which
operates eateries at Tresidder Union mid
the Graduate School of Business, have
begun preliminary actions to unionize
themselves.
Last Monday, 20 workers — who claim to
represent the majority of food workers for
Bon Appetit at Stanford — along with repre
sentatives from Union Local 715, and the
campus student groups MEChA and Resis
tance Action Grassroots Organizing Educa
tion (RAGE), presented a petition to the
management of Bon Appetit at Stanford, an
nouncing their intention to unionize.
Carlos Hernandez, an organizer for local
715, Service Employees International
Union, said unionizing the workers at Bon
Appetit locations on campus would bring
improved bargaining power.
"Bon Appetit has been trying to delay the
efforts of workers by trying to negotiate sep
arately in little groups and asking for a six
month waiting period before going ahead
with unionization plans, but they would not
guarantee anything in writing," said Her
nandez.
Workers and union organizers will meet
formally with Bon Appetit management and
the National Labor Relations Board on May
23 to determine if the union represents the
majority of workers and their interests, and
as such, if it has the right to be recognized by
Bon Appetit.
Mary Clark, district manager for Bon Ap
petit, denied that the company has been try
ing to stop unionization activities by its
workers at Stanford.
"We have been trying to negotiate with
our workers to find out where the points of
disatrreement lie. We don't feel that interfer

ence by the union in this situation is needed
because we have always had a close working
relationship with our workers," said Clark.
Adrian Chavez, a cashier at Tresidder
and one of the organizers of the unionization
movement, said he believes that unioniza
tion "would bring better wages, more bene
fits and greater job security."
"We have had many people who have
worked a long time without a raise, also we
have too little sick time — three days a year
that don't carry over," said Chavez. He also
said workers are organizing for better
health care coverage and regular wage in
creases to compensate for inflation.
A food manager at Tresidder, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said he supports the
idea of unionization because he believes the
union will bring benefits to workers such as
himself. While he said he is mostly satisfied
with the level of benefits he gets from Bon
Appetit, he said the company could do more
for others.
Clark denied the charges by union orga
nizers that Bon Appetit was trying to hold
up the hearing process, scheduled to begin
next week, by asking that student workers
be included in negotiations. Hernandez said
Bon Appetit was trying to stall the process
by telling the union that student workers
had to be included in the proposal.
"We respect the rights of our employees,
if they want to organize; that is their
choice," said Clark, "but we don't want the
union coming in and targeting a select group
or a few employees. We want all of our em
ployees included in this decision."
Hernandez said getting student workers
— who account for just under half of Bon
Appetit's 200 workers on campus — to agree
to unionize was not a problem. Bon Appetit
operates the Coffee House, which employs
mostly students who work part
time.
"We are ready to negotiate with
the support of students. If they are
asking the students to be included,
that's fine," said Hernandez. "We
have been talking to them and they
are supportive of their co-workers."
Hernandez added that they will
know the legal position of Bon Ap
petit at next week's meeting with
the NLRB.
Additionally, student activists
have also mobilized on campus, be
coming involved with the dispute.
Freshman Crystal Zermeno, an or
ganizer of a protest flier campaign
yesterday at Tresidder and the
Business School, said the position
of the Bon Appetit was obvious.

"We know at this moment that
they don't want to recognize the
union — they don't want to negoti
ate," said Zermeno.
The fliers she handed out yes
terday claimed that Bon Appctit
"has refused to honor the employ
ees' wishes" and "is waging an anti
union campaign against its own
workers."
"Of course, we don't feel that
the workers should unionize,"
said Clark, who went on to detail
numerous benefits and bonuses
workers get when they work for
Bon Appetit. Clark added that be
cause the company is not subsi
dized by the University, like
Housing and Dining Services, it
should not have to be made to
unionize.
"We are more like the restau
rants on El Camino than the dining
services in the dorms, which are
unionized," said Clark.
