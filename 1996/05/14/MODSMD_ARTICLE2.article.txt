# Bon Appetit workers intend to form union
## 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
Seeking better benefits and job security,
food service workers for Bon Appetit, which
operates eateries at Tresidder Union mid
the Graduate School of Business, have
begun preliminary actions to unionize
themselves.
Last Monday, 20 workers — who claim to
represent the majority of food workers for
Bon Appetit at Stanford — along with repre
sentatives from Union Local 715, and the
campus student groups MEChA and Resis
tance Action Grassroots Organizing Educa
tion (RAGE), presented a petition to the
management of Bon Appetit at Stanford, an
nouncing their intention to unionize.
Carlos Hernandez, an organizer for local
715, Service Employees International
Union, said unionizing the workers at Bon
Appetit locations on campus would bring
improved bargaining power.
"Bon Appetit has been trying to delay the
efforts of workers by trying to negotiate sep
arately in little groups and asking for a six
month waiting period before going ahead
with unionization plans, but they would not
guarantee anything in writing," said Her
nandez.
Workers and union organizers will meet
formally with Bon Appetit management and
the National Labor Relations Board on May
23 to determine if the union represents the
majority of workers and their interests, and
as such, if it has the right to be recognized by
Bon Appetit.
Mary Clark, district manager for Bon Ap
petit, denied that the company has been try
ing to stop unionization activities by its
workers at Stanford.
"We have been trying to negotiate with
our workers to find out where the points of
disatrreement lie. We don't feel that interfer

ence by the union in this situation is needed
because we have always had a close working
relationship with our workers," said Clark.
Adrian Chavez, a cashier at Tresidder
and one of the organizers of the unionization
movement, said he believes that unioniza
tion "would bring better wages, more bene
fits and greater job security."
"We have had many people who have
worked a long time without a raise, also we
have too little sick time — three days a year
that don't carry over," said Chavez. He also
said workers are organizing for better
health care coverage and regular wage in
creases to compensate for inflation.
A food manager at Tresidder, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said he supports the
idea of unionization because he believes the
union will bring benefits to workers such as
himself. While he said he is mostly satisfied
with the level of benefits he gets from Bon
Appetit, he said the company could do more
for others.
Clark denied the charges by union orga
nizers that Bon Appetit was trying to hold
up the hearing process, scheduled to begin
next week, by asking that student workers
be included in negotiations. Hernandez said
Bon Appetit was trying to stall the process
by telling the union that student workers
had to be included in the proposal.
"We respect the rights of our employees,
if they want to organize; that is their
choice," said Clark, "but we don't want the
union coming in and targeting a select group
or a few employees. We want all of our em
ployees included in this decision."
Hernandez said getting student workers
— who account for just under half of Bon
Appetit's 200 workers on campus — to agree
to unionize was not a problem. Bon Appetit
operates the Coffee House, which employs
