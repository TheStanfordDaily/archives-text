## Cuza's analysis of spring sports topics 
### 
Less than four-and-a-half
weeks left in the quarter,
and the Stanford sports
scene continues to wind down
even further. Women's water polo
concluded its first season on the
varsity level by taking fifth place
at last weekend's national cham
pionship tournament. That leaves
just baseball, track, tennis and
golf on the varsity sports schedule.
But alas, there is a greater
world of sports outside the friend
ly confines of the Farm, though
you might not always know it
from reading this page. So for
those of you too bogged down in
papers and midterms to peruse a
sports page or catch a few minutes
of Sports Center, allow me to sur
vey the landscape.

The juiced ball theory:
April, May and June have always
been a time for baseball fans to
tickle their fancies by projecting
the home-run totals of that year's
hottest sluggers over the entire
162-game season. And every year,
almost without fail, there's some
hot-hitting superstar who makes
people wonder if this could be the
year that Roger Maris' record
"falls.
Well, this year you can take
your pick. With more than a
month and a half gone by in the
1996 season, there's no sign of let
ting up. Through Monday's
games, San Francisco's Barry
Bonds was on pace to hit a record
shattering 76 homers, Balti
more's Brady Anderson (who only
once in his career has hit more
than 16 homers) was hitting at a
68-homer clip, Cleveland's Albert
Belle was due for 65 and Montre
al's Henry Rodriguez was right on
schedule to belt 64 round-trip
pers.
Henry Rodriguez? Some
thing's definitely not right here.
But it's not just homers that are
on the rise — scoring is at an all

time high and major league pitch
ing is poorer than ever.
Most of the media have chalked
up the offensive boom of recent
years to the dilution of pitching
caused by expansion. Certainly,
expansion is contributing to the
problem, but it's not the only
thing. "Smaller strike zone, small
er ballparks, bad pitching, bigger
hitters, loaded baseballs, corked
bats and higher-altitude cities,"
former Stanford standout and
Oriole Mike Mussina was quoted
as saying last week. "Does that
about cover it?"
And, of course, there's the
juiced ball theory, which has no
validity in this writer's opinion.
The way I see it, we've been here
before, and one way or another the
issue always dies down eventually.
It is disturbing, however, to note
that scoring has been continually
on the rise since 1993, when the
league expanded into Florida and
Colorado. Especially when you
consider the addition of two more
expansion teams — the Arizona
Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay
Devil Rays — in 1998.
Two teams times 11 or 12
pitchers apiece that's about 22-
24 minor league pitchers that will i
be in the majors come 1998. Roger
Maris, watch your back.
NBA playoff picture: For a
second there, it looked like the
Chicago Bulls' inevitable NBA
Championship run might take an
unexpected detour. Sunday at
Madison Square Garden, the
Knicks overcame an 11-point
deficit in the final quarter to go up
by three on the Bulls with just
over a minute remaining. But it
was not to be, as Chicago rallied
for the 94-91 victory.
Had they pulled off the upset,
the Knicks would have evened the
best-of-seven series at two games
apiece and picked up momentum
heading into today's Game Five at
Chicago. Instead, the Bulls went
up 3-1 and all but assured them
selves a date with Orlando in the
Eastern Conference finals.
Meanwhile, the Utah Jazz
have built a nearly-insurmount
able 3-1 advantage on David
Robinson and the San Antonio
Spurs. But no need to fret. I pre
dict the red-hot Sonics over eit her
team in no less than six games.

How long until football
starts?: It's never too early to start
looking ahead to next season when it
comes to pro football. And this year,
all eyes are on Miami, where Jimmy
Johnson will be trying to get Dan
Marino and the Dolphins some
where that Don Shula hadn't taken
them in 11 years — the Super Bowl.
This week's issue of Sports Illus
trated said Johnson is on a three
year plan for bringing Miami a Lom
bardi Trophy. My question is, what's
going to take him so long? In Dallas,
Johnson built a Super Bowl winner
from the ground up (the Cowboys

went 1-15 his first season) in only
four years. And in Miami, he already
has the ingredients for success —
afler all, the Dolphins did make the
playoffs last season.
Miyor League Soccer makes
its mark; Though it's a little prema
ture to make any conclusive observa
tions, it would appear that Major
League Soccer has been a smashing
success in its inaugural season. The
upstart league has drawn large
crowds and generated media inter
est throughout the country.
My question is, after being
weaned on the San Jose Clash by the
local media, what'll I do when I re
turn home for summer? Do I sup
port my hometown LA Galaxy, or I
continue to back the Clash? A
phone-in poll is in the works.
