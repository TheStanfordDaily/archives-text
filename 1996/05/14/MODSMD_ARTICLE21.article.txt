# Baseball wins sweet 16th straight
## No. 7 Cardinal gets record, regional at home on same day 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
j Stanford 11

After learning that Sunken Dia
mond had been named one of eight
NCAA Regional Tournament sites
earlier in the day, the Cardinal
proved its worth on the field, defeat
ing Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, 11-2.
The win was Stanford's 16th con
secutive victory, eclipsing the previ
ous school record of 15 straight set
by the 1990 club.
Although the Cardinal (39-17)
managed just nine hits, one of them
was a grand slam off the bat of se
nior Troy Kent which put Stanford
ahead 5-2 in the fourth inning. The
blast was Kent's 10th of the season.
"1 thought we played pretty
well." said coach Mark Marquess.
"Kyle Peterson threw well,we
played good defense and Troy Kent
turned things around for us with
one swing of the bat."
Peterson (9-5) baffled the Mus
a!! nif;ht,allowingtworunson
three hits in eight innings of work.
After giving up a two-run home run
to right fielder Rob Neal in the
fourth, Peterson retired the next 13
Mustangs en route to his fourth con
secutive victory. During the current
winning streak, Peterson is 4-0 with
an ERA of 2.53.
Junior Tom Reimers pitched the
ninth to finish the game, allowing
one hit and striking out one.
Reimers has made seven appear
ances in the past 16 games and has
been nearly perfect, surrendering
just one earned run in 122/3 innings
for a 0.71 ERA.
Kent continued his hot hitting,
going 3-for-4 with five RBI on the
night. Kent's blast was his first
grand slam in a Stanford uniform
and was his seventh home run dur
ing the unbeaten streak. The third
baseman has hit at a .355 clip in the
past five weeks.
While Kent called the grand slam
one of the most exciting home runs
he has hit, he cited the team's suc
cess as the highlight of the night.
"I think it's exciting to get the
win and become the team with the
longest streak, something we were
shooting for over the past week,"

Kent said.
Junior loft fielder Chris Clark
also went 3-for-4 in the contest and
sophomore fielder Joe Kilburg
slapped a bases-loaded triple to boost
his season RBI total to 42.
"When you look at a winning
streak, you're normally pitching
pretty well and playing good de
fense," Marquess said. "If you look
back on when the streak started at
our defense and the number of walks
we were allowing, you'll find that
that's a big key to it."

Indeed, the Stanford was out
standing in the field last night, as
freshman center fielder Jody Gerut
and sophomore shortstop Jay Pecci
turned in dazzling efforts to rob the
Mustangs of hits.
The Cardinal will put its winning
streak on the line Wednesday night
against Nevada in its final regular
season game. Kent said he expects
Stanford's winning ways to continue
into postseason play, when the Car
dinal will play before a home crowd.
"Everyone's a little more relaxed
and confident," Kent said. "We ex
pect to win games, so we don't really
press when we're down 2-0 and
we're not hitting the ball well — we
expect to be able to pull it out."
