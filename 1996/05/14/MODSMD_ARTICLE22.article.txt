Winning the West Coast Conference
Championships last weekend in Chico,
Calif., the Stanford cycling team is fired up
and in top condition to compete in the last
collegiate race of the season, the Collegiate
Nationals on June 1 and 2.
Out of approximately 50 of Stanford's rid
ers, 32 participated in the conference cham
pionships, and eight qualified for the Nation
al Conference which will be held at Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo. They will represent the
West along with Cal Poly-SLO, UC-San
Diego, California, Nevada, UC-Davis and
Chico State.

Stanford placed first in two of the three
events — the road race, a billy 80-mile trial,
and the criterium, a sprint race conducted on
a closed loop. In the team time trial event,
which requires three of the four cyclists to
cross the finish line at the same time, Stan
ford placed second after Cal Poly-SLO,
falling by one point.
"The competition was incredible," said
freshman Peter Nichols, who competed in
the team time trial and the criterium events.
"Everyone racing next to you is so good, it
made you push harder and go. Winning the
conference was our main goal for the season,
and we are really happy with the results."
Each school went into the Conference

Championships with a maximum of 1,000 ac
cumulated points from the top-10 results in
races held throughout the collegiate cycling
season which began in February. A total of
100 points were awarded to each first-place
team finish.
The results from Men's A, B, C and D cat
egories and Women's A and B categories in
each event are tallied to attain the total raw
score for each event. The results of the A cat
egories are given the most weight.
"In this sense, cycling is a great, great
team sport that requires continuous effort,"
said coach Art Walker. "The effort of both
men and women as well as that of first-year
riders competing in the lower levels and the
top experienced riders all contribute to our
victory. Every race and effort counts. They
all help send our top riders to Nationals."
The Stanford team added 374 points from
the team trials, 253 points from the road race
and 248 points from the criterium with its
outstanding performance at the conference
to its 972 accumulated points earned from
their impressive season records to win the
first-place ticket to the National Champi
onships.
The Cardinal won eight conferences and
placed second in two conferences this season,
allowing them to get a third-place start going
into the final conference after Cal Poly
SLO's 1,000 points and Cal's 979 points.
Stanford placed first in all the other cate
gories in each event aside from the two men's
A team second place finishes by significant
margins.
Stanford cyclists competing at the Nation
al championships include David Bailey,
Peter Armitage, Andrew Lewis, Dario
Falquier, Tracy Timms, Catherine Norbu
tas, Kelley Herndon and Megan Troxell.
"I think a lot of our riders will place
among the top [at the nationals), as was the
case in previous years," Walker said. "As a
team, my expectation is that we will place
among the top three again. I really think if
the men's A team set their mind to it, they
can win the national team time trial. I know
that the women have more than even odds of
winning as well."
Colorado, Marian (Ind.) College and
UCSD, which barely beat the Stanford men's
A road race and criterium team at the con
ference championships are expected to be
some of the toughest competition Stanford
will face at the Nationals.
Stanford will also send six riders to the
upcoming Olympic trials which will be held
all over the country over the next three
weekends.
