# Senior Chang provides leadership, experience
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
In the noisy lunchtime mad
ness of the Kappa Sigma dining
hall, Jerry Chang's casual smile
betrays a calm not normally seen
in a senior about to get tossed out
into the bonecrushing jaws of the
world outside of Stanford.
While the typical senior waits,
terrified by the prospect of paying
high income taxes, or worse yet,
not having to pay income tax at
all, Chang is content to ride out
the final weeks of his college expe
rience, unsure of exactly where it
will take him, but optimistic
nonetheless.
"I'm not too sure what the next
year is going to hold for me," he
said, laughing a little. "There's so
many things that I want to ex
plore that it makes it kind of hard
to settle in on one future goal.
"If I take one path, it kind of
shuts out another."
If Chang sounds like he has too
good a handle on things, maybe
it's because he actually does. The
fifth-year senior is the captain of a
powerhouse men's golf team and
a premedical student nearly fin
ished with his requirements, the
sum of which is a very promising
outlook on life. To top it all off, he
has perspective too.
"I'm proud of what I've accom
plished," he said. "I've tried very
hard to get where I am, but at the
same time, I know that there's so
much more to life than things like
athletic or academic success.
"It's easy to be too driven and
get wrapped up in your own little
world."
Head coach Wally Goodwin
only confirms what one already
knows â€” that Chang has got his
life in order.
"Jerry is rock solid," Goodwin
said. "He's one of the most level
headed young men I've ever
coached and it's really come out in
his role as team captain.

"He's been like glue for thus
team, keeping us together when
we hit a rough spot."
However, the success and hap
piness he enjoys now belies a try
ing four years on the Farm.
As a talented high schooler in
Westlake Hills, Calif., Chang
caught the eye of a number of col
legiate programs, fielding scholar
ship offers from both UCLA and
USC, where his brother played,
before settling on Stanford.
"I wanted to step out of my
brother's shadow," Changsaid. "I
didn't want to be 'Jimmy's little
brother' all the time.
"Also, academics were stressed
a lot in my family. If you were
given a chance to go to Stanford,
you didn't turn it down."
Afler a promising freshman
campaign, Chang earned a schol
arship and a spot on the skirting
five as a sophomore. However,
with three All-Americans red
shirting, Goodwin was forced to
play three sophomores and two
freshmen. The inexperienced
squad struggled through a very
difficult season.
"Things were tough and we re
ally had a hard year," Chang said.
"It was really a growing time."
By the start of junior year,
Chang's Stanford experience had
reached its lowest point. Burnt
out on golf and nursing an injured
back and a loss of academic focus,
he decided to step away from the
sport, unsure of whether he was
going to return.
His year away from athletics
proved to be a good one, as he
found time to explore different
courses and become involved in
different extracurricular activi
ties. By the end of the year, his ex
perience as a recreational thera
pist in the Children's Hospital
had resulted in a budding interest
in medicine.
"I was really looking to be a
regular student for a while," Chang
said, "and it was a very good time for
me because I got to check out a lot of
opportunities that I hadn't been able
to as an athlete.
"But in the end, I really missed
the sport, the competition and the
feeling of being on a team."
Chang stepped back onto the
links at the beginning of last season,
but with a different attitude. Having
come to terms with what he wanted
out of his Stanford experience, the
senior returned with a better grasp
of his life as a student-athlete.
"I finally realized that I could be a
golfer, but that it didn't have to be
everything in my life, that I should
be able to have a bad performance in
golf and leave it on the course,"
Chang said.
The resulting change was a more
laid-back approach to the game.
Though maintaining a high level of
work, he felt more relaxed in practice
and competition.
"I resigned myself to just having
fun," he said. "I didn't really worry

too much about where I was at on
the depth chart and I certainly didn't
expect to make the top five."
While he spent most of the year
playing with the second team, he
continued to work his way back to
form and toward the end of the sea
son, a slump by senior All-Ameri
can Steve Burdick created a win
dow of opportunity. Chang made
the most of it, posting impressive
scores at the team's final two regu
lar season meets and solidly con
tributing in the team's heartbreak
ing close run at the NCAA title, as
Stanford fell one stroke short of
Oklahoma State in the first sud
den-death playoff in championship
history.
Afterwards, Chang decided to
forgo his final year of eligibility and
committed his summer to working
at a East Coast camp for young can
cer patients rather than training, an
experience which caused him to re
examine his own personal life and ul
timately solidified his desire to be
come an oncologist.
"The kids taught me so much
about life and overcoming," he
said. "They taught me that there's
so much that's important and how
silly our little world here at Stan

ford can be.
"One case that struck me in
volved a girl who was just happy to
get three meals a day at the camp. I
mean, I was pretty upset after we
lost the national title, but how does
any of that compare to not having
enough to eat?"
Despite his second extended
respite from golf, Goodwin was sup
portive and ready to welcome Chang
back to the squad for his final season.
After long discussions with his
mother and sophomore teammate
Tiger Woods, he decided to return
once again.
"I didn't want to pass up this op
portunity to provide some experi
ence and leadership to the team,"
Chang said. "I got so much out of the
program and I wanted to contribute
as much as I could."
Such guidance has been much
needed this season. With Woods
and freshman Joel Kribel headlin
ing, the squad has a talented, but
inexperienced core. Both on and
off the course, Chang has been a
steadying influence, providing his
younger teammates with advice
on everything from their tech
nique to their classes, drawing on
his own past to help make their

transition a bit easier.
"Jerry has provided exactly the
type of leadership this team has
needed," Goodwin said. "He doesn't
need to be loud or dominating, he
leads by example."
And this week, Cluing embarks
on what could be the end of a very
solid career as he guides the 17th
ranked Cardinal into the NCAA
Regionals. It is questionable
whether he will pursue a profes
sional career. At least for the time
being, the summer MCATs occupy
his near future.
"I really don't know if I want to go
pro," he said. "I think the PGA could
offer a re;illy great life doing some
thing that I love to do, but I know
that it's a difficult road there.
"Whatever I decide, I'm certain
that I could be happy without com
petitive golf."
Regardless, these final few weeks
will provide one final opportunity to
get the championship ring he came
so close to earning last year. And for
all the perspective he has gained in
his four years, the competitive fire
still burns in him.
"It would be great to take it all
this year," he said. "I would love to go
out a winner."
