# Senior Chang provides leadership, experience
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
In the noisy lunchtime mad
ness of the Kappa Sigma dining
hall, Jerry Chang's casual smile
betrays a calm not normally seen
in a senior about to get tossed out
into the bonecrushing jaws of the
world outside of Stanford.
While the typical senior waits,
terrified by the prospect of paying
high income taxes, or worse yet,
not having to pay income tax at
all, Chang is content to ride out
the final weeks of his college expe
rience, unsure of exactly where it
will take him, but optimistic
nonetheless.
"I'm not too sure what the next
year is going to hold for me," he
said, laughing a little. "There's so
many things that I want to ex
plore that it makes it kind of hard
to settle in on one future goal.
"If I take one path, it kind of
shuts out another."
If Chang sounds like he has too
good a handle on things, maybe
it's because he actually does. The
fifth-year senior is the captain of a
powerhouse men's golf team and
a premedical student nearly fin
ished with his requirements, the
sum of which is a very promising
outlook on life. To top it all off, he
has perspective too.
"I'm proud of what I've accom
plished," he said. "I've tried very
hard to get where I am, but at the
same time, I know that there's so
much more to life than things like
athletic or academic success.
"It's easy to be too driven and
get wrapped up in your own little
world."
Head coach Wally Goodwin
only confirms what one already
knows â€” that Chang has got his
life in order.
"Jerry is rock solid," Goodwin
said. "He's one of the most level
headed young men I've ever
coached and it's really come out in
his role as team captain.

"He's been like glue for thus
team, keeping us together when
we hit a rough spot."
However, the success and hap
piness he enjoys now belies a try
ing four years on the Farm.
As a talented high schooler in
Westlake Hills, Calif., Chang
caught the eye of a number of col
legiate programs, fielding scholar
ship offers from both UCLA and
USC, where his brother played,
before settling on Stanford.
"I wanted to step out of my
brother's shadow," Changsaid. "I
didn't want to be 'Jimmy's little
brother' all the time.
"Also, academics were stressed
a lot in my family. If you were
given a chance to go to Stanford,
you didn't turn it down."
Afler a promising freshman
campaign, Chang earned a schol
arship and a spot on the skirting
five as a sophomore. However,
with three All-Americans red
shirting, Goodwin was forced to
play three sophomores and two
freshmen. The inexperienced
squad struggled through a very
difficult season.
"Things were tough and we re
ally had a hard year," Chang said.
"It was really a growing time."
By the start of junior year,
Chang's Stanford experience had
reached its lowest point. Burnt
out on golf and nursing an injured
back and a loss of academic focus,
he decided to step away from the
sport, unsure of whether he was
going to return.
His year away from athletics
proved to be a good one, as he
found time to explore different
courses and become involved in
different extracurricular activi
ties. By the end of the year, his ex
perience as a recreational thera
pist in the Children's Hospital
had resulted in a budding interest
in medicine.
"I was really looking to be a
