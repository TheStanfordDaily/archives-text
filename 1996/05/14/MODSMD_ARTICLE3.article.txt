# STS presents case to H&S committee
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Representatives of students ma
joring in Science, Technology and
Society yesterday presented the
School of Humanities and Sciences
Curriculum Committee with the
names of 16 faculty members com
mitted to be involved in the pro
gram.
The students have been ap
proaching faculty during the past
week, requesting that they sign a
form pledging some level of involve

discontinue its degree-granting as
pects at the end of the 1997-98 aca
demic year.
Professors were asked whether
they would consider serving as
chair of the program, participate in
STS-related research, design an
STS-related course, teach or partic
ipate in teaching STS courses,
serve as adviser for STS students or
on an STS advisory board or
crosslist a course with STS.
Students were informed last

month that the all-undergraduate
STS program would not seek re
newal of its degree-granting au
thority afler 1998. An honors pro
gram in STS would continue to be
offered, and an undergraduate
minor would be added to the cur
riculum.
The primary reason offered for
discontinuing the degree-granting
program was lack of significant
commitment from tenure-line fac
ulty. The program also has not had
a permanent chair for the past few
years.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ram6n Saldivar charac
terized the meeting as a "prelimi
naiy discussion on the status of
STS."
"We didn't intend to come to any
decision, and we certainly didn't,"
Saldivar said. "We will have ongo
ing conversations with all interest
ed parties over the next several
meetings."
