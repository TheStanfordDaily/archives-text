# STS presents case to H&S committee
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Representatives of students ma
joring in Science, Technology and
Society yesterday presented the
School of Humanities and Sciences
Curriculum Committee with the
names of 16 faculty members com
mitted to be involved in the pro
gram.
The students have been ap
proaching faculty during the past
week, requesting that they sign a
form pledging some level of involve
ment in the program, which may
discontinue its degree-granting as
pects at the end of the 1997-98 aca
demic year.
Professors were asked whether
they would consider serving as
chair of the program, participate in
STS-related research, design an
STS-related course, teach or partic
ipate in teaching STS courses,
serve as adviser for STS students or
on an STS advisory board or
crosslist a course with STS.
Students were informed last

month that the all-undergraduate
STS program would not seek re
newal of its degree-granting au
thority afler 1998. An honors pro
gram in STS would continue to be
offered, and an undergraduate
minor would be added to the cur
riculum.
The primary reason offered for
discontinuing the degree-granting
program was lack of significant
commitment from tenure-line fac
ulty. The program also has not had
a permanent chair for the past few
years.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ram6n Saldivar charac
terized the meeting as a "prelimi
naiy discussion on the status of
STS."
"We didn't intend to come to any
decision, and we certainly didn't,"
Saldivar said. "We will have ongo
ing conversations with all interest
ed parties over the next several
meetings."
Junior Michael Putnam, a pre
senter at the meeting, said the
meeting was a "positive experience.
The members of the committee
seemed genuinely concerned and
interested in looking at the root is
sues."
Moving the program into the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
along with findingcommitted facul
ty and a permanent program chair,
may be the best method of saving
STS, Putnam said.
The School of Humanities and
Sciences is an appropriate home be
cause it offers both bachelor of arts
and bachelor of science degrees, he
said. The STS degree is the only
bachelor of arts degree offered by
the School of Engineering.
Having found 16 faculty mem
bers committed to some level of in
volvement in the program, thechal

lenge remains to find a program
chair, Putnam said.
Of the 16 professors signing
commitments, 12 said they were
willing to advise and 10 said they
would advise honors students, Put
nam said. All 47 STS majors are
currently advised by STS Prof.
Robert McGinn, acting chair of the
program. Four more students have
declared an STS major in the past
two weeks, Putnam said.
Students have also mailed let
ters to all 110 STS alumni asking
for support.
The "Save STS" student group
has collected more than 2,000 sig
natures in support of the program
— the necessary number to have
the issue placed on the ballot for a
special ASSU election next week.
The group ultimately decided
against including the question on
the ballot, however, "because we
think that there's a sincere effort
being made to save the Put
