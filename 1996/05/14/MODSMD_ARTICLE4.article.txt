# Vandals hit BGLAD poster at Med School
## 
### Angel Flores Contributing writer 
A poster advertising Stan
ford's Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Days was found de
faced late last week at the School
of Medicine.
Someone scrawled the word
"fags" in capital letters on the
"Still Out On the P'arm" poster,
which was hanging across from
the Fleischmann Learning Re
source Center, said Medical
School Assoc. Dean for Student
Affairs Elliott Wolfe.
"This is the first incident that
I have seen where posters from
the llesbian, gay and bisexual]
community have been defaced at
the Medical Center," said Wolfe.
Wolfe said no one knows when
the actual vandalism occurred or
who committed the crime. The
poster's location in a public place

has made identification of sus
pects difficult, he said.
"Because we don't know all
the scenarios such as who wrote
the word, we have to be wary
about the situation," said sopho
more Courtney Lake, a volun
teer at the Lesbian, Gay and Bi
sexual Community Center.
According to Lake, the com
munity wants to be careful in
pointing fingers because there is
a chance someone outside the
Stanford community vandalized
the poster.
"Students at the Medical Cen
ter are writing letters to the
medical board and medical ad
ministration as a response to the
incident," Lake said.
The community center will
most likely be releasing a state
ment at the end of the week con
demning what happened, Lake
said. Meanwhile, the incident
has raised concern among mem
bers of the lesbian, gay and bi
sexual community.
"One if the issues that the
poster brought about was
whether it was intended to be
derogatory or whether it was
meant to show pride like with
the word 'queer,' " said fresh
man Patrick Dominguez, also a
volunteer at the community cen
ter.
Although the word "fag" has
become a term of empowerment
for those of the lesbian, gay and
bisexual c o m m u -n-i t y ,
Dominguez said, use outside the
community is usually seen as

derogatory.
Stanford medical students are
required to attend a workshop
on cultural diversity to increase
awareness. According to Wolfe,
the goal of these workshops is for
students to learn how to appreci
ate diversity so they can care for
all patients equally.
The vandalism is "deplorable
and I believe it is not reflective of
the whole student body but prob
ably one or a small number of
people," Wolfe said. "I was very
disappointed, disturbed and con
cerned because I don't like to see
a group discriminated against."
This is not the only recent in
cident of discrimination against
the lesbian, gay and bisexual
community at Stanford. Two
years ago, seven students were
charged with crimes relating to
vandalizing the "Gay Libera
tion" sculpture on campus.
