# President emphasizes ultimate University authority over student government
## Casper releases ‘C ’96' interpretations 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
University President Gerhard Casper official
ly approved most of "Constitution '96" yesterday
but stopped short of giving Stanford's student
government full independence from the Univer
sity.
The new ASSU Constitution, along with
Casper's interpretations, will be presented for
ratification at the ASSU Senate meeting tonight.
In a letter to the ASSU Council of Presidents,
Casper stressed the importance of preserving the

Board of Trustees' "ultimate
and final authority over the
University under law and
under the Founding Grant."
Casper recommended the
inclusion of an introductory
clause to provide the basis for
interpreting "each and every
provision in the Constitution."
He authorized the ASSU "to
exercise and discharge major

privileges and responsibilities within the frame
work of policies and regulations established by

the University through the president of the Uni
versity and the Board of Trustees."
Because of the close relationship between the
ASSU and the University administration,
Casper said he was concerned that total indepen
dence could discourage collaborative discourse.
All registered Stanford students arc members of
the association, which also names students to
University committees, while the University in
turn collects fees for student groups, Casper
noted.


Casper
"The relationship between the
University and the ASSU is a multi
faceted and long-standing one,"
Casper said in his letter. "The broad
language of 'independence,' " he
said, does not "accurately reflect
the interrelationships between the
ASSU and the University."
Dean of Students Marc Wais yes
terday called Casper's speedy ap
proval an encouraging sign of his
commitment to "reaffirming the
voice of the students who over
whelmingly voted in favor of 'Con
stitution '96.' "
While Casper's comments on in
dependence "give wide latitude,
freedom and a great deal of autono
my to the ASSU," they aiso empha
size "a clear recognition that the
Board of Trustees ultimately holds
responsibility for managing the
University," Wais said.
Echoing the sentiments of sever
al ASSU senators, Financial Man
ager John Hall said, "Both the dean
and the president showed a tremen
dous level of respect for both the
new constitution and the student
government itself."
Hall added that the issue of in
dependence has grown increasing
ly important in the past five years,
as the ASSU has attained com
plete financial independence from
the University. The University did

not offer the ASSU any funding
for the first time last fiscal year,
Hall said.
Although "Constitution *96" au
thor Michael Slemmer said he
thought Casper made "pretty com
pelling arguments" about the ad
ministration's need to maintain
clearly defined ties with the ASSU,
he said he "can't agree that an orga
nization of students must necessar
ily be controlled by the University."
The only portion of "Constitu
tion '96" which Casper rejected en
tirely was a clause that would trans
late the administration's failure to
take action on a constitutional
amendment within 90 days of its re
ceipt into unconditional accep
tance.
The 90-day mandate originally
appeared as a separate constitu
tional amendment written by COP
member Jon Oram in case "Consti
tution '96" did not pass.
"Although I am confident that I
or a future president of the Univer
sity would act expeditiously in re
viewing submitted amendments,
one can readily imagine a situation
in which either the issues involved
or the surrounding circumstances,
or both would make the 90-day
deadline unreasonable," Casper
said in the letter.
Explaining that "when you run a
place like Stanford, you simply
don't know what the calendar will
present you with," Wais said the
president's intention is not to
thwart timely ratification of ASSU

matters.
"I understand where [Casper] is
coming from," Oram said. "There
are a lot of times when 90 days is not
enough time to act on an ASSU
amendment."
Oram also said he was "very im
pressed" with Casper's timely ac
tions on "Constitution '96," adding
that he would he "very encouraged"
if such actions are indications of
how the University will deal with
ASSU business in the future.
Another constitutional measure
Casper addressed was the elimina
tion of the ASSU's requirement
that the financial manager be a full
time registered student.
Casper approved the article, but
said, "Let me state my strong view
that student organizations should
be run by students."
Hall, who will serve as next
year's ASSU financial manager,
said Casper's statement recognizes
"both the importance of student
leadership in the ASSU's manage
ment of its finances, as well as the
practical considerations of manag
ing a $5 million operation."
"Constitution '96," which was
supported by more than 75 percent
of student voters in last month's
ASSU general election, will put a
single president and vice president
in charge of the ASSU's executive
branch, create a Constitutional
Council to litigate ASSU judicial
matters, reduce the senate from 40
to 30 senators and grant all sena
tors voting power.
