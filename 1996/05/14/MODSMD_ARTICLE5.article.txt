# President emphasizes ultimate University authority over student government
## Casper releases ‘C ’96' interpretations 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
University President Gerhard Casper official
ly approved most of "Constitution '96" yesterday
but stopped short of giving Stanford's student
government full independence from the Univer
sity.
The new ASSU Constitution, along with
Casper's interpretations, will be presented for
ratification at the ASSU Senate meeting tonight.
In a letter to the ASSU Council of Presidents,
Casper stressed the importance of preserving the

Board of Trustees' "ultimate
and final authority over the
University under law and
under the Founding Grant."
Casper recommended the
inclusion of an introductory
clause to provide the basis for
interpreting "each and every
provision in the Constitution."
He authorized the ASSU "to
exercise and discharge major

privileges and responsibilities within the frame
work of policies and regulations established by

the University through the president of the Uni
versity and the Board of Trustees."
Because of the close relationship between the
ASSU and the University administration,
Casper said he was concerned that total indepen
dence could discourage collaborative discourse.
All registered Stanford students arc members of
the association, which also names students to
University committees, while the University in
turn collects fees for student groups, Casper
noted.
