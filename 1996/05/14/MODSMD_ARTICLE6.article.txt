# Zimbardo's prison
## Famed psychology professor calls 1970s prison experiment unethical 
### Nadia Elghobashi Contributing writer 
Acclaimed Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo reflected
last night on his famous prison experiment which he per
formed 25 years ago, admitting he made a mistake in judg
ment.
In a live interview yesterday with Stanford Cardinal
Broadcasting Network — Stanford's student television sta
tion — Zimbardo said the experiment was an important test
of human behavior.
"We wanted to see what would happen when you put good
people in an evil place," he said.
Looking back, Zimbardo said the experiment was "clearly
unethical." He said he made a "tactical error" when he made
himself both the superintendent of the mock prison, as well as
the investigator of the experiment. "I should have kept the
two roles separate," Zimbardo said.
Zimbardo explained the experiment and its origins. He
said the experiment was a culmination of a long study about
how people are influenced by their environments, which he
worked on in the 19705.
He recruited 24 college students who had a relatively nor
mal history. Zimbardo said the students were "law-abiding,
emotionally stable, physically healthy and in all respects, nor
mal kids."
Some of the students were assigned to be prisoners, and
others were designated as guards. The students were placed
in the bottom of Stanford's Psychology Department, Jordan
Hall. The prisoners were stripped and put in smocks, and the
guards took turns watchingthem. Zimbardo said the outcome
"was not what was expected."
The situation started to get out of control due to the ac
tivist spirit which was common among students in the '70s,
Zimbardo said. "Many students were politically active —
more than students today," he said.
Some of the prisoners decided to rebel by removing their
identification numbers and the hair nets which were sup-

posed to simulate a shaved head.
They then began cursing the
guards.
"The prisoners went beyond
their roles and they energized the
guards at a personal level. When
someone starts making fun of your
mother, it doesn't matter that
you're only in a mock prison," Zim
bardo said.
After the rebellion began, more
guards were called in as reinforce
ments, and the "ringleaders" of
the rebellion were put in isolated
cells. Zimbardo said the guards
were using psychological control
when they established a "bad cell"
which had no food or blankets.
"The guards had decided to di
vide and conquer," he said.
When one prisoner starting hav
ing a breakdown, Zimbardo and
others working on the experiment
thought that he was faking his agi
tation. Zimbardo offered to pay the
prisoner the previously agreed
amount of money if he would con
tinue to be a prisoner and report on
the condition of others in the
prison.
Unfortunately, the rebellious
prisoner established a model which
other prisoners soon copied. "He
became a model for getting out of
the prison. Others started imitat
ing his behavior, screaming, crying

and thinking irrationally," Zim
bardo said.
Zimbardo explained why the
participants were uncontrollable.
"The reason why prisoners be
haved the way they did is because
they had never before been totally
powerless. The guards had created
an arbitrary environment in which
reward and punishment were arbi
trary. They had complete power,"
he said.
Zimbardo said the guards began
to behave sadistically, making the
prisoners simulate sodomy. At this
point, Zimbardo realized he had
made a mistake.
"I knew I had gone too far," he
said.
Zimbardo said he no longer felt
comfortable leaving the guards
with the prisoners. After only six
days — eight days earlier than
planned — Zimbardo terminated
the experiment.
Despite being traumatized dur
ing the experiment, the partici
pants were back to normal shortly
after it was canceled, Zimbardo
said.
Zimbardo performed follow-up
sessions with the participants sev
eral weeks later. He said because
they all had "normal foundations,"
they were able to "bounce back
quickly."
Although he said he would not
perform the experiment again even
if he could, Zimbardo said it proved
a great deal about human behavior
in certain situations.
