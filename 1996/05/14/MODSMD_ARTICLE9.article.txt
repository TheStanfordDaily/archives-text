# Committee finds that worker compensation costs are down
## Report weighs health, safety issues 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
Three positive trends are apparent in Stanford's
health and safety research, according to a new report
of the Committee on Environmental Health and
Safety.
The committee reported on its activities for the
past year at a panel in Tresidder Union last night.
These activities included improvements in fire safe
ty, safety training and community-outreach efforts.
According to Lawrence Gibbs, associate vice pres
ident of environmental health and safety, the three
positive trends include an 80 percent reduction in
worker compensation responses — compensation for
injuries on the job — since 1992; a move to "a more
proactive research program;" and "increased and en
hanced community awareness of safety in the labora
tory and workplace."
Stanford's worker compensation costs are 33 per
cent to 50 percent lower than comparable UC schools
and USC, and 70 percent lower than the California
State University system.
"This is an indication of the overall abilities of fac
ulty, staff and students at this university," Gibbs
said, "and the overall well-being of campus safety for
work and study."
Gibbs said the committee is "trying to create cost
efficiency" in health and safety measures.
One of the central focuses of the committee is haz
ardous waste management.
According to Kenneth Kase, associate director of
environmental health and safety, the Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center recently violated standards
for storing radioactively contaminated lead by keep
ing it on-site for more than 90 days.

Gibbs said the lead was stored for such a long pe
riod on-site because there was no place to dispose of
it. Since then, new methods of storing lead have been
explored.
Stanford has received no other citations for health
and safety violations, Gibbs said.
In another positive development, Stanford's
drinking water, which is purchased from the San
Francisco Water Department, has received high rat
ings based on low copper and lead content.
Marty LaPorte, manager of the Stanford division
of the Environmental Quality Program, said while
there has been enhanced emergency planning for
earthquakes and other natural disasters, people
"don't usually think about the quality of water being
impaired. The community is often unaware."
An extensive list has been developed of people in
departments to contact if problems with the water
arise, she said.
LaPorte also said the Environmental Quality Pro
gram is working to increase community awareness
that storm water drains into the San Francisquito
Creek and the Bay.
These efforts include working with youth groups
and schools to promote awareness, establishing spe
cial conditions in Palo Alto for storm water pollution
prevention and coordinating painting projects to
note what is acceptable to dispose into sewer drains.
The program is also working with the Green
Lights Program, an East Palo Alto program for ener
gy efficiency to prevent pollution.
The committee received a slight increase this year
in allocations from the University, which, according
to Gibbs, is demonstrative of "the University's con
tinued compliance and support" for environmental
health and safety on campus.
