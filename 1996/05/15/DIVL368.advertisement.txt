HONORS THESES PRESENTATION-DISCUSSIONS
at the Haas Center for Public Service
For Public Service Scholars, service is not about choosing community involvement instead of academic work. Rather, the direction and effort of the Public Service Scholars Program is reflected in its
thematic focus, "Research As a Form of Public Service." This means that research and scholarship are applied to serve specific community needs or the general public interest. This year's Public Service
Scholar theses exemplify the incredible range of community concerns, application of research to explore solutions, and the power of uniting community service with the development of knowledge. We
invite you to come and see for yourself. Join us at the Haas Center's Donald Kennedy Conference Room (unless otherwise noted).

Space in Olympic Atlanta
Advisor: Paulla Ebron, Anthropology and Akhil Gupta, Anthropology

preparation for the Games and to examine the impacts of these changes, especially on the estimate
20,000 homeless people in the downtown areas. He will ask critical questions about broader trends in

JULIE LANOFF ('96 American Studies)
The Black Panther Party's Free Breakfast Program: Serving Up Eggs, Bacon
and Social Change
Advisor: Clay Carson, History/Martin Luther King Papers Project Director Julie's presentation will
examine the Black Panther Party in the context of history and current discourse about "service." She
argues that the Free Breakfast Program went beyond the normal implications of "service" and could be
seen as a model "empowerment" community program with twin goals of political education and
community organization.
Wednesday, MAY 29, 7-8 pm SANDY LEE ('96 Public Policy)
San Francisco School Desegregation: Judicial Politics and Assessment of
Achievement Effects

exploring with the program. How do you desegregate in a way that "works?" Sandy examines the
radical reform called "Reconstitution" now being implemented in the San Francisco School District. The
policy is "more than about mixing bodies:" we'll learn what this means as Sandy describes the mission
and impact of SF's new reform.
Wednesday, JUNE 5, 7 - 8:15 pm MONICA LAM ('96 Urban Studies)
No Man's Land Note Location: ates Bui, ding, Room 8101
Monica's video looks at the San Francisquito Creek as a case study in re-thinking natural resources. This
documentary video explores why and how an urban creek can be important to the different
communities through which it runs.
"Members of a university community, whatever their views, must not shy away from the social and political issues of their time, from shaping the social and political
values of society, from engaging in public serince. Stanford's culture is very supportive of these endeavors. Pursuing them at a university provides the chance to make
them as effective as possible by applying the same critical reasoning to public service that is otherwise prized in the university."Gerhard Casper, President
