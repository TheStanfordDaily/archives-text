# For the record
## 
### 
An article in Monday's Daily
incorrectly stated that 216 stu
dents were elected to Phi Beta
Kappa this year. Only 186 stu-

dents were elected this year; 30 of
the 216 were elected last year.
Also, the article incorrectly stated
that academic records of all stu
dents are reviewed in the selection
process. This is not the case.
