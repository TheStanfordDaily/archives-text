Bridget Quigg believes stereotypes about
pro-lifers are generally false. Toward that end,
Quigg, a sophomore, has spent the last year as
president of Stanford Students for Life.
"We are taking positive actions towards
supporting women," Quigg said. "We are very
much pro-women, pro-child and pro-man. We
want to support life."
Founded in 1991, Stanford Students for
Life seeks to spotlight the pro-life sides of the
abortion and euthanasia controversy through
sponsoring debates, speakers and community
service projects, Quigg said.
"We were founded to promote a respect for
the dignity of human life," Quiggsaid.
With that goal in mind, the group has re
cently completed renovations on a home for
unwed pregnant women. The house, called
Heritage Home, has residents that range in
age from 16 to 27. It gives women a variety of
benefits: a place to live during their pregnan
cies, medical assistance and, once their chil
dren are born, help in placing the mothers and
babies into supportive environments.
According to Quigg, "Many of the girls
come from abusive relationships and lack sup
portive ties. We want to support women who
need support and may have (considered) abor
tion because they felt that they had no other
options."
In accordance with this effort, the group,
which consists of about 15 active members.

provided a room within Heritage Home with a
new coat of paint, new borders, new bed sheets
and new curtains.
Although the group has yet to interact with
the mothers on a one-on-one basis, they would
like to eventually have lunches, take walks
and have discussions with the mothers. Other
future plans are to have baby clothing drives
and to bring doctors into the home to discuss
prenatal care and parenting.
Stanford Students for Life does not have
any religious affiliations, Quiggsaid, and does
not have any ties to political organizations.
"A lot of times people feel that pro-life sup
porters just say 'Don't have an abortion,' and
that women are left without options," ex
plained Quigg. "So, as a group, we are hoping
that the Heritage Home project and other ones
like it will show that there are many options
for women."
Other group-sponsored activities have in
cluded bringing speakers to campus. In Janu
ary, a seminar titled, "Women and Abortion:
Beyond the Procedure," explained the harm
ful results that pro-lifers believe abortion can
have.
Tom Cavanaugh, assistant professor at the
University of San Francisco, was invited by
the organization to give a talk about legalizing
euthanasia. "Will the True Feminists Please
Stand Up?" was another discussion of how
pro-lifers think women are physically and
mentally hurt by abortion.
The organization desires to spark debate,

Quigg said. "I feel that the pro-life side of all
life issues needs to be known and considered in
order for academic discussion to flourish.
[Abortion and euthanasia] are a national
tragedy that need to be addressed."
Quigg said group members generally feel
that many students are respectful of their
opinions, but do not support them. Conse
quently, Stanford Students for Life hopes to
spread a greater understanding of their be
liefs.
Elizabeth Heil, a sophomore and vice presi
dent of the group, agreed. "I feel that the
group gives a not-so-often-heard perspective
on issues," Heil said. "Our opinions are not
mainstream, but that just means that they can
spark a debate."
In the future, the group hopes to hold a dis
cussion about RU-486, the French pill which
can be used as a form of birth control following
inception. They also hope to design an out
reach program for women who need alterna
tives to abortion. Such a program may provide
access to adoption facilities and financial sup
port if the women do not have money to raise a
child, Quigg said.
The students are in the process of produc
ing a pro-life pamphlet outlining alternatives
to abortion. They hope to distribute it at Cow
ell Student Health Center and the Women's
Center.
Stanford Students for Life will be finding a
new home in the Women's Center early next
year.
