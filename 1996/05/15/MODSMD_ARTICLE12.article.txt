## FAA announces new safety plan 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Under orders from President
Clinton to ensure airline safety,
the Federal Aviation Administra
tion announced plans yesterday
to hire more inspectors quickly
and make sure they are doing
their job.
The FAA had been planning to
hire 300 to 400 more safety inspec
tors this year. FAA Administrator
David R. Hinson said the effort
will be speeded up — with 100
hired by June — in the aftermath
of Saturday's ValuJet crash in
Florida's FiVerglades that killed
109 people.
Hinson testified before the Sen
ate Transportation Committee
that the moves are in response to
Clinton's demand that the
nation's airlines "continue to oper
ate at the highest level of safety."
At the White House, press sec
retary Mike McCurry said, "We've
got faith in America's air travel
system. But we always recognize
you need to check and double
check ways in which you have to
improve that system."
Hinson said the FAA, accused
of laxity by some critics, is launch

ing a thorough review of how
inspectors are used and is adopting
a new system to gather safety and
performance data from the
nation's airlines.
Hinson said Sandia National
Laboratories is cooperating in
development of the new data-gath
ering system.
Mary Fackler Schiavo, the
Transportation Department's
inspector general, said her agency
is investigating reports that FAA
officials were pressured to certify
low-fare airlines.
The Transportation Depart
ment and the FAA determine
when an airline is safe to fly, she
said on CBS-TV's "This Morning."
"But my job is going beyond
that. It's finding problems," she
said. Asked about recent com
ments that she would not fly on
ValuJet, she replied, "It's not part
of my job to promote airlines or
sell tickets on ValuJet."
Appearing on ABC-TV's "Night
line" on Monday, she questioned
FAA assurances that the airline
was safe. "You can pass the (safety)
exam with a 'C' or you can pass the
exam with an 'A,' " she said.
