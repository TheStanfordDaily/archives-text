PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) - Dr. Jack
Kevorkian escaped conviction on assisted
suicide charges for the third time in two
years yesterday and declared that the only
thing that can stop him now is "being
burned at the stake."
The jury deliberated for 13 hours over
three days before finding Kevorkian inno
cent in the suicides of Sherry Miller and
Marjorie Wantz at a rural cabin in 1991.
Miller died by inhaling carbon monoxide;
Wantz received a lethal injection.
Prosecutors have yet to convict the
retired pathologist, who has acknowledged
attending 28 deaths since 1990 and has
become so brazen that he even took part in
a suicide during the trial. His latest acquit
tal only added to his reputation as some
one beyond the reach of the law.
"Dr. Kevorkian is simply not con
victable," said Howard Simon, director of
Michigan's branch of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
Kevorkian hugged supporters and
shook their hands alter the verdict.
"I've never been so convinced of being
right in my life," he said later. "The thing
that would stop me at this is being burned
at the stake. I don't like burning to death."
In his two previous trials, he was
acquitted in 1994 and again in March
under a temporary ban on assisted suicide
that was rushed into law by the Legisla

ture specifically to stop him. The law has
since expired.
This time, he was charged on the basis
of a 1994 Michigan Supreme Court ruling
that assisted suicide is a crime under
common law, the body of traditions and
legal precedents dating to old England
that form the foundation of much of mod
ern law.
On the stand, Kevorkian had dismissed
the trial as a "lynching" and a conspiracy
by a judicial system out to get him, and
reacted testily during questioning, daring
Circuit Judge David F. Breack to hold him
in contempt.
Kevorkian's lawyers contended as
usual that his intent was to relieve pain
and suffering, not to kill. But they also
argued — persuasively, it turns out — that
because prosecutors based their case on an
unwritten law, he had no way of knowing
what he did was a crime.
"I would have liked to have seen it in
black and white," said juror Cameron Bee
die, a 39-year-old waitress.
Juror Jennifer Quigley, a 27-year-old
college student, said Kevorkian should not
have been charged, under a 1994 ruling,
with suicides that occurred in 1991. She
said the jury believed his testimony that he
did not think it was a crime at that time.
"We felt that Dr. Kevorkian had made
an honest effort to research that, to stay

within the bounds of the written law,"
Quigley said.
Kevorkian, 67, could have received up
to five years in prison on each of two
counts.
"The only thing that protected us was
the jury," defense attorney Geoffrey
Fieger said. "They understood there was
no law."
Prosecutor Lawrence Bunting said: "I
should have done a better job prosecuting
the case. I wish I could have done more to
convince the jury that the elements of the
law described to them by the court are
what they should follow."
Bunting said he could not say whether
Kevorkian would be tried in any of the
other suicides he took part in.
State Sen. Jim Berry man interpreted
the latest acquittal to mean that the issue
is "back in the Legislature's court again."
He said the Legislature should put the
issue on the ballot and let the voters decide.
Miller, 43, of Roseville had multiple
sclerosis and was unable to care for her
self. Wantz, 58, of Sodus had severe gyne
cological pain and underwent 10 opera
tions without relief.
Jurors said they were moved by the
emotional videotapes of the women made
shortly before their deaths, by testimony
from the women's relatives, and by
Kevorkian.
