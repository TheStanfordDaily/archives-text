### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Magic Johnson, saying he
was really "ready to give it up" this time, retired from
the NBA again. At age 36, chances are he won't change
his mind.
Johnson, whose comeback with the Los Angeles
Lakers began in triumph and ended in disarray,
announced his retirement yesterday, saying it was time
to return to his business interests.
"I was satisfied with my return to the NBA,
although I would have hoped we would have gone fur
ther into the playoffs," he said in a statement issued by
his agent, Lon Rosen. "But now, I am ready to give it
up. It's time to move on.
"I am going out on my terms, something I couldn't
say when I aborted a comeback in 1992."
Rosen said Johnson's decision to retire again has
"nothing to do with his health."
Johnson, who turns 37 in August and would have
been a free agent July 1, first retired just before the
start of the 1991-92 season afler learning he had the
AIDS virus.
The three-time league MVP decided to come back
before the 1992-93 season but quit again shortly before
the season when several players expressed concerns
about playing with him.
Afler considering a comeback several times since,
Johnson returned to the Lakers on Jan. 29. He played
in 32 games and the Lakers won 20, helping them earn
the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs.
However, the Houston Rockets eliminated the Lakers
in four games in the first round.
The Lakers, who won five NBA titles with Johnson,
had no advance warning about yesterday's announce
ment.
