## Liberian war refugees dock 'Voyage of the damned' ends after 10 days at sea

TAKORADI, Ghana (AP) - The
"voyage of the damned" has ended.
After 10 days at sea, thousands of
exhausted Liberian war refugees
poured down the gangplank of a rusty
freighter that finally found a place to
dock yesterday. Some prayed upon
reaching dry land. Some sobbed.
Refugees told harrowing tales of
crewmen who sold donated aid food
packets at inflated prices to near
starving people trapped on board. At
least two people died during the voy
age.
Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
had called their agonizing journey a
"voyage of the damned."
The 3,000 to 4,000 refugees left the
Bulk Challenge after authorities reluc
tantly gave in to international pleas
for mercy and let it dock in the western
port of Takoradi.
"Ghana believes that these innocent
civilians should not be made to suffer
any more for the failure of their politi
cal and factional leaders," said the
deputy foreign minister, Mohamed Ibn
Chambas.
Only a day earlier, Ghana had sent
the ship packing for a second time,
joining Ivory Coast in declaring it
could not support any more Liberian
refugees on its soil.
More than 350,000 Liberians have
fled to neighboring Ivory Coast and
15,000 to Ghana to escape more than
six years of civil war that has killed
150,000 people in their homeland.

Ghanaian officials said a new camp
would be built for the refugees, but
cautioned it would not accept any
more. "There is a limit to our
endurance," Chambas said.
As the refugees left the ship, U.N.
relief workers placed white name
bands on their left wrists, then led
them off for food and water.
Buses later took them to an existing
refugee camp about 4 miles from the
port.
One group of refugees stopped to
pray.
"We should say a big thank you to
almighty God for taking care of us
throughout our 10 sorrowful days at
sea," said one man. The others
responded with "amen" and began to
sob.
Since May 5, the leaking, over
crowded Bulk Challenge had sailed in
search of a West African sanctuary for
the refugees fleeing a month of blood
shed in the Liberian capital of Mon
rovia.
Last Thursday, officials in the Ivory
Coast forced the ship to sea after let
ting it dock for repairs. From Ivory
Coast it sailed to Ghana, where it took
on supplies before being forced out
Sunday and Monday.
As it set off Monday, 147 Liberians
and 126 Ghanaian refugees jumped 10
feet from its teeming deck to a Ghana
ian navy barge that had been used for
medical examinations. They were
being held yesterday at the nearby
Essipong refugee camp.
