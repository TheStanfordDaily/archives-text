FDA approves home HIV kit
WASHINGTON (AP) — People will soon be able to take an HIV
blood test in the privacy of their home using a new blood collection kit
approved yesterday by the Food and Drug Administration.
The kit will enable patients to take their blood sample at home,
send it to a laboratory and then receive the results by telephone. Until
now, all blood sampling for HFV tests had to be done at clinics, hospi
tals or doctors' offices.
Direct Access Diagnostics of Bridgewater, N.J., developed the test
kit and will market it under the brand name Confide HIV Testing
Service for about $40.
