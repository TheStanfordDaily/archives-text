President Casper should
ensure that humanities
receive financial support

TO ATTRACT the best and
the brightest, Stanford
has attempted to create a
strong academic atmosphere that
responds to current ideas in edu
cation. Last Thursday, Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper
addressed another facet in the
quest for strong applicants —
money.
The Stanford Graduate Fellows
Program — implemented with a
$10 million startup grant from
the President's Fund — is expect
ed to alleviate what the Universi
ty sees as a loss of the strongest
graduate applicants to other
schools that offer better financial
incentives. Initially, the program
will support 300 fellowships, to be
distributed evenly over three
years, to grad students who com
pete nationally for the awards.
Casper is searching for another
$200 million to increase the pro
gram to include financial support
for 300 graduate students every
year. The majority of these fellow
ships are slated to be awarded to
graduate students in science and
engineering departments.
The graduate population plays a
large role in maintaining and
improving Stanford's status as
both an educational facility and a
research institution, and Casper's
initiative to address Stanford's
graduate student attraction
should be commended. In addi
tion, his proactive search for fund
ing outside already-thinned Uni
versity resources demonstrates his
sincerity in this effort. In fact, the
Lucille E Markey Charitable Trust
fund has already donated a $2 mil
lion endowment to provide gradu
ate fellowships in biomedical sci
ence. The announcement that
most fellowships will provide

financial support to those in the
sciences, however, is cause for con
cern.
Vice Provost and Dean of
Research Charles Kruger defend
ed this announcement by assert
ing that while students in the
humanities rely on unrestricted
University funding, those working
in the science and engineering
departments depend more heavily
on grants and federal funding,
which has been consistently
decreasing. However, it is difficult
to accept that graduate students in
the humanities can utilize "unre
stricted" University resources
when Stanford has witnessed a
variety of budgeting problems con
cerning Humanities and Sciences.
In last year's proposed budget
cuts, the School of Humanities
and Sciences was one of the hard
est hit — its budget was to be
determined in flat dollars, rather
than with adjustment for infla
tion. With humanities programs
still feeling the effects of budget
cuts, the argument that graduate
students in the humanities do not
need as much outside financial
support as those in sciences and
engineering seems hollow.
In addition, part of Casper's
incentive to create the fellowship
program was a comment made last
year by English Prof. John Bender,
who remarked that the English
Department lost two of its top
graduate candidates due to insuffi
cient funds. Certainly, this sug
gests that all graduate depart
ments — not simply those in sci
ences and engineering — could
benefit from the program. Perhaps
Casper should allocate the money
differently and in a more egalitari
an manner, or he should increase
the amount of money for which he
is searching to include humanities
research.
Casper's proactive search for
outside funding, as well as his
focus on graduate programs, is
vital to the University. He
should ensure, however, that the
humanities are not lost in the
shuffle.
