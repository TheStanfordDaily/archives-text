## The 						problematic problematical 
### 
THE UNIVERSITY is dead as a
place of thought. Arid I'm not just
talking about those Hum Bio
majors, haughty but suave MBAs,
mechanical 1-Ls and management con
sultants-in-training. For them, Stanford
is a stepping-stone to six figures, and, I
guess, deep spiritual and intellectual ful
fillment. Bashing them is easier than
shooting pre-meds in that proverbial fish
barrel, the 24-hour study room.
Nope. It's the hypocritical humanities
sorts who are the worst. At least pre-pro
fessionals are honest about what they're
doing. But anyone who has said epistemo
logical structure or mentioned Derrida in
the past day, well, they've got a problem.
They (OK, we) have these notions we're
looking for knowledge and truth, but we
do it in this irrelevant fashion, which
involves lots of damnable jargon and even
more obscurantism. Scholarship in the
humanities is a mostly narcissistic process
largely detached from the outside world.
Somehow, a lot of smart people with
tenure have gotten the bright idea that if
an intelligent layman can follow a state
ment, then it's not profound. No, to be
really smart one must say "reification" or
"ontological" and make veiled allusions
to post modernism. Now, accusing pro
fessors of mental masturbation is noth
ing new. Socrates (who would have been
denied tenure for lack of publications)
thought the sophists were bullshit
artists. And efforts by some scholars to

diversify the curriculum are socially rele
vant. But the problem persists.
Literature courses, for example, are
often taught with theory first and the lit
erature second. You'll read Joan Scott or
Barbara Johnson or Lukds or Derrida or
Foucault or Girard or Althussier, which
necessarily come at the expense of litera
ture. Well, guess what? A lot of people
read novels. Virtually nobody, not even
the supercultured, care about literary
theory outside of universities.
Many professors write for each other.
They write articles back and forth argu
ing about how subversive lecture notes
reveal Hegel was in the 1820s. They vio
late the English language with words like
"problematical" and "Foucaldian," which
no one really understands anyway. And
when hiring time comes around, they
clone themselves, continuing their dis
cussion in a vacuum.
So what happens when the humanities
get too abstract? Even in the ivory tow
ers, the scholarship is rejected — most
undergrads go to pre-med, engineering
and economics, largely because they
think the humanities are irrelevant.
Outside the university, the humani
ties don't get respect either. Woodrow
Wilson and Eisenhower were college
presidents before they sat in the Oval
office. JFK couldn't help but trip over an
eminent scholars in his White House.
Clinton has a few technocrats and a lot of
spin doctors. Bye-bye, Schlesinger. Hello,

Carvillopolous. There are still public
intellectuals, like George Will or Bill
Gates' new plaything, Michael Kinsley,
but the only place at universities where
they reside is Harvard's Dußois center.
People outside just can't see the rele
vance of the hyper-specific and impene
trable scholarship inside the university.
What is to be done? Well, we should
change the hiring process to encourage
breadth — not depth — of knowledge.
Aggressively pursue non-academics for
tenured positions. Hire people who write
for The New Yorker, not the dusty, red
spined journals in Green. Transform our
faculty from specialists to generalists.
Professors, transform yourselves. Go
read that random book you never wanted
to. Throw away the lecture outline and
talk about Bosnia. Assign The New York
Times to your class. Be a thinker, not a
scholar.
Or, with splendid condescension,
lament the decline of public discourse,
deplore the rabid Republicans, write
another article on poststructuralism and
wonder why no one listens.
