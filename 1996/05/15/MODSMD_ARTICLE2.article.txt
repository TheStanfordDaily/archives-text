# ASSU Senate OKs Casper letter
## Senators break ties in election, again fail to keep quorum for meeting 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer 
The ASSU Senate last night unanimously accepted
University President Gerhard Casper's conditions
and interpretations of "Constitution '96." The docu
ment will go into effect May 21.
In his brief comment to the senate as Casper's rep
resentative, Dean of Students Marc Wais called upon
the senate to reconsider its relationship with the Uni

versity and the Board of Trustees. He announced that
next year Casper hopes to start a dialogue between
the administration and the ASSU to clarify the role of
student government on campus.
The senate, officially continuing last Tuesday's
meeting, also completed the certification of the spring
general election.
Last week, objections were raised over undergrad-
uate senator Steve Russell's certi
fication as a graduate senator
from the Law School. Russell has
been wait-listed and will not re
ceive word of his status until June
18. Last night, however, Russell's
certification sailed through with
out debate.
The senate was also faced with
the resignation of graduate sena
tor-elect Chris Roat. Under the
ASSU Constitution, Roat's seat
could be filled only by a special
election. "Constitution '96," how
ever, provides that the results of
an election held within 28 days of
the creation of a senate vacancy
can be used to fill the vacancy.
Concern that the graduate popula
tion would lose a voting seat in the
senate led graduate senators Doug
Natelson and Don Aingworth to
demand quick action by the senate
before the results of the spring
election expired Thursday.
The senate, in response, recon
sidered its ratification of "Consti
tution '96" in order to modify its
oritrinal timeline. The sections of

"Constitution '96" that deal with
filling vacancies and reapportion
ing districts, however, will take ef
fect immediately.
The senate, using secret ballot,
broke the ties resulting from the
spring election results and filled
the remaining graduate senator
seats, including Roat's, in the sen
ate-elect. Elizabeth Kerr and Mike
Duh were seated as graduate sena
tors-elect from the Schools of
Business, Law and Medicine. Each
received one write-in vote. Gavin
Funabiki and Michelle McClellan
won graduate senate seats repre
senting the Schools of Education
and Humanities and Sciences
after capturing two write-in votes.
The senate took no action on a
letter received last week from Fac
ulty Senate Chair Gail Mahood.
The letter stated firmly that the
Faculty Senate would not recon
sider its decision to exclude stu
dent representatives from the
Planning and Policy Board.
The senate spent the remain
der of its meeting considering the
appointments of Program Board
and Speakers Bureau directors be
fore failing a quorum call, prevent
ing them from taking any further
action.
