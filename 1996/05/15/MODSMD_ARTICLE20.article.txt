## Campbell reveals inconsistencies in Republican party 
### 
THE EXCELLENT report in Mon
day's Daily of Rep. Tom Camp
bell's talk to Stanford Republicans
revealed the deep inconsistencies in
Campbell's allegiance to the Republican
party. On the one hand, he opposes rais
ing the minimum wage from $4.25 to
$5.15 an hour, even though 63 percent
of those who would benefit are not
teenagers but adults. Instead he sup
ports the earned income tax credit,
which "is subsidized by everyone." But
since Campbell favors eliminating the
income tax entirely, there could be no
earned income tax credit, and mean
while millions of Americans would have
to continue trying to get by on less than
$10,000 a year.
His suggested Republican slogan, "Get
serious â€” which party is more likely to

make government smaller?" is equally at
odds with reality. Although Congression
al Republicans claim they want to reduce
the size of the federal government, they
have added to the list of crimes that
must be tried in federal rather than state
courts, attempted to add a new layer of
bureaucracy to obstruct implementation
of environmental regulations and
approved a military budget $7 billion
over what President Clinton had asked
for (and that included weapons the Pen
tagon didn't ask for and doesn't need).
Contrary to making the government
less intrusive into people's lives, the
same bill prohibited women in the mili
tary from obtaining privately financed
abortions in military hospitals. Although
the U.S. spends more on the military
than the next eight countries combined,

Republican leaders are now asking for
another $13 billion for the Pentagon,
which is already the government's
largest civilian employer, and are calling
for the buildup of a laser-guided anti
missile defense system that could even
tually cost more than $50 billion. Such a
system would be far more useful as an
election issue for Robert Dole than in
improving our national security. It
would violate the ABM treaty with Rus
sia and obstruct efforts to reduce Rus
sia's nuclear arsenal. In any case, no
country today has the ability to deliver a
nuclear bomb as far as the U.S., and the
U.S. has the retaliatory power to annihi
late any country that threatened to do
so. According to a senior Pentagon offi
cial, even if it worked, a multibillion dol
lar laser device would provide no defense

against a determined terrorist "with a
little technical know-how and 20 pounds
of smuggled plutonium."
What Rep. Campbell and his fellow
Republicans never tell us is how they
propose to spend additional billions on
the military, continue to provide what
the Congressional Budget Office esti
mates to be $100 billion dollars a year in
tax breaks and subsidies for the rich and
at the same time cut taxes and balance
the budget. Campbell may not agree with
his Republican colleagues on every issue,
but in claiming that a Republican victory
in November will result in easing the tax
burden, improving the lot of the poor
and reducing the size of the government,
he is promising what he can't deliver.
