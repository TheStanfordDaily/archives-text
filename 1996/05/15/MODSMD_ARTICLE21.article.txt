# Prof's letter failed to show viable solution from a conservative
## 
### 
Past the superfluous name-dropping
to prove that he is an intellectual, I think
that Prof. Emeritus Robert Greer Cohn
had a good point in his letter in yester
day's Daily. He brings to light the detri
mental extremity with which the liberals
sometimes act. However, the conserva
tives are not without this fault either,
and they cannot wash their hands of the
same villainy that Cohn accuses the liber
als of doing. Newt Gingrich, Pete Wilson,
Pat Buchanan, et al. are in the same vein

as the "ideological Panglossian" liberals
that Cohn describes and are part of the
"rottenest" yet century, too. The men
tioned politicians are self-dubbed conser
vatives, but don't seem to quite match
with Cohn's non-existent ideal of conser
vatism. In this way, Cohn is just as ideo
logically liberal as the liberals he is
attacking.
The question, then is what exactly a
liberal and a conservative is. The fault
within Cohn's retort to Romesh Ratne
sar's column is that he does no better at
describing the conservative Utopia that
is somehow better than the liberal soci
ety. There is really no substance behind
what he has described as a liberal other
than stereotype, as evidenced by the
unnecessarily self-righteous remark,

"Pity the conservatives? Pity the caribou
driven from the Alaskan oil fields? Pity
the snickering youth who may have no
jobs. Or sustaining faith." His argu
ments rest upon some rather amorphous
a priori assumptions of conservatism
and liberalism. Even within the defini
tive boundaries of political conservatism
and liberalism, there is much dissension.
Cohn mentions a gem of truth, that
"Aristotle's definition of a 'virtuous per
son' is exactly the same as James Q. Wil
son's: a nexus of 'golden means' at the
core of a circle of criss-crossing excess
deficiency polarities." By stating this, he
has referred to a notion that transcends
the political quagmire of left and right.
Perhaps the liberals cannot attain this
golden mean, but certainly the conserva

tives have done no better.
Having stated such, Cohn cannot
validly claim that the conservatives are
the godsend heroes in regards to any
current social problem. He mentions the
idea that shunning education and per
missiveness are liberal hallmarks, but
this is a conjecture rather than a truth.
The fact that Americans' "general cul
ture is so poor" has nothing to do with
liberalism. The fact that "conservatism
is now the voting-majority position" has
nothing to do with "advanced civiliza
tion." In summary, Cohn has some good
ideas about how a perfect American soci
ety would be, but has no good argument
that the conservatives are the solution.
