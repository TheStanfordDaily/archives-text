## Newsworthy' to whom? The media's responsibility 
### 
ON FEBRUARY 24, Dr. Mae Jemi
son — the first black woman in
space and Stanford's upcoming
graduation speaker — dropped her 70-
year-old father off for breakfast at Polly's
restaurant in Nassau Bay, Texas, plan
ning to pick him up after she made a
deposit at a nearby bank. She pulled her
car out of Polly's — the same way she
and most Polly's patrons always do, she
says — and headed toward the bank. A
few miles down the road, a white police
officer pulled her over for an improper
turn out of Polly's.
In the midst of a routine traffic cita
tion, the officer — one Henry Hughes 111
— discovered that Jemison had an out
standing traffic ticket. (He later learned
that she had in fact paid the 1990 Fayette
County traffic ticket, but that the county
had returned the check because it does
not accept personal checks. Jemison says
she never received her check back, and
assumed that matter had been taken care
of because the state continued to renew
her driver's license.) Hughes returned to
Jemison's car and informed her that she
was under arrest. She dropped her keys,
and "when I leaned down to pick them
up, he grabbed my wrist and began twist
ing it very painfully behind my back," she
says in a letter of complaint filed after the
incident. "He ultimately pushed me face

down onto the pavement and completed
handcuffing me in a very painful man
ner."
Jemison was told she could not call her
sister — who lives a block away — to pick
up her car or her father. The car would
have to be towed, Hughes said, and her
father left at Polly's. The officer asked
Jemison to remove her soft-soled shoes,
because they could be potential weapons.
She was made to walk from the police car
to the Nassau Bay Police station, then
was placed "in a filthy holding cell, bare
footed." She posted bail, and filed a for
mal complaint. Hughes was suspended
but by early April was back on the job,
cleared by an internal affairs committee.
Chances are, you haven't heard this
story. Even though most major papers,
including the Los Angeles Times, the San
Jose Mercury News and even the Palo
Alto Daily News, reported the story.
The Stanford Daily did not.
That decision was a bad one. Ask most
people on campus if they'd rather read
about Jemison, or about Stanford stu
dents in long-distance relationships, or
the naming of the new Terman Fellows
— till stories which ran the week most
major papers ran their initial Jemison
stories. Students care about the alleged
brutalization by police of the graduation
speaker; they'd willingly give up the

annual bike theft statistics for a day. But,
more importantly, stories like Jemison's
represent journalism's most noble pur
pose and solemn responsibility: to shine
the light of public awareness on claims of
victimization, on racism, on abuse. The
Daily miscalculated the interest of its
readers, I think, but — more to the point
— its leadership missed an important
opportunity to teach younger staffers
that the production of a daily paper has a
higher purpose than the day-to-day grind
of writing obligatory speech stories and
witty weather predictions might suggest.
The Daily's editor admits the paper
probably made a mistake in not publishing
the story, saying its failure to run the story
had more to do with a communications
breakdown in the news department and a
desire not to be overly sensationalistic than
any ideological bias against the story.
But even careless omissions like this
one sends a message, or, rather, sends
messages. The Daily thinks the story was
not important, or "newsworthy" in news
ese. The Daily doesn't think Jemison is
credible. The Daily doesn't care about
minorities, women or women minorities.
The Daily only cares about the adminis
tration and the ASSU, not stories real
people care a lot about.
I agree that all of these messages could
be inferred, on some level, from The

Daily's decision not to run the story
about Mae Jemison. And in my four years
at The Daily, I've heard all of these com
plaints about the paper, and worse. But,
in my opinion, those accusations are
wrong. It's not that simple. There are
enduring and fundamental problems
with the interaction between The Stan
ford Daily and the larger Stanford com
munity — particularly among special
communities traditionally underrepre
sented in the media — but those prob
lems have a lot more to do with misun
derstanding and long-standing animosi
ties than they do with anything as blind
and wholesale as racism or homophobia.
Daily editors are under an immense
amount of pressure. Most upper-level
news editors sit in a stifling office for 10
to 14 hours a day, with only the occasion
al visit from an ASSU senator to break
the monotony of assigning stories, deal
ing with writers and editing stories. It's
not particularly fun; I've always thought
about my tenure as managing editor as
something like Prof. Zimbardo's prison
experiment. Nonetheless, these are the
people we expect to keep up with the
news, with things people care about.
But it's not enough that they write
about accessible news, "event" stories,
like Faculty Senate meetings and any
time an ASSU senator sneezes. We expect

them to keep up with news from ethnic
and racial communities, the disabled
community, the lesbian, gay and bisexual
communities, the Greek system and
issues of interest to women. But — here's
the tricky part — we don't necessarily
want to tell them. Having been burned in
the past, many special communities,
understandably, don't want their dirty
laundry spread across the pages of The
Daily. And Daily reporters who are also
members of these communities don't
want to betray their friends. The problem
becomes one of chickens and eggs: Com
munities complain because their issues
aren't covered, but The Daily doesn't
really have the information to cover
them.
It isn't enough to complain that Daily
editors are out of touch and aloof and
moronic, although I know for a fact that
many of us over the years have been all of
those things. You have the real power as
readers. Call the paper. Let them know
when they're missing good news stories.
If something strikes you as suspect or
unfair, bug them about it. A few phone
calls back in March, and you might have
been reading about Mae Jemison instead
of the Stanford Court Jugglers.

Daily. And Daily reporters who are also
members of these communities don't
want to betray their friends. The problem
becomes one of chickens and eggs: Com
munities complain because their issues
aren't covered, but The Daily doesn't
really have the information to cover
them.
It isn't enough to complain that Daily
editors are out of touch and aloof and
moronic, although I know for a fact that
many of us over the years have been all of
those things. You have the real power as
readers. Call the paper. Let them know
when they're missing good news stories.
If something strikes you as suspect or
unfair, bug them about it. A few phone
calls back in March, and you might have
been reading about Mae Jemison instead
of the Stanford Court Jugglers.
