## Track trio gives Cardinal a head start at Pac-10s 
### Sam Wang Contributing writer 
The multi-event portion of the Pacific 10 Conference
Track and Field Outdoor Championships quietly took
place last weekend at UCLA's Drake Stadium.
Stanford sent three athletes to compete in the grueling
two-day competition. Sophomore Josh Gleason partici
pated in the decathlon, while freshman Tracye
and sophomore Katrinka Jackson entered the hep
tathlon.
All three athletes placed in the top eight, giving Stan
ford a head start on the scoreboard when the rest of the
Pac-10 Championships takes place this upcoming week
end.
Lawyer came in at sixth place with 4,998 points, and
Jackson rounded out the placings in eighth with 4,569.
Gleason finished fifth in the final standings with a per
sonal-best score of 7,013 points, just barely missing the
NCAA provisional qualifying mark of 7,050.
"I performed well," Gleason said. "Not great, but not
terribly. I wanted to score over 7,000, which I did, barely.
I got us some points, but I still have a lot of room for im
provement."
Head coach Vin Lananna was more generous with his
praise for Gleason's performance.
"Josh did a great job. It was a big improvement from
last year. I am very impressed with his performances," he
said.
Gleason was coming off of a good performance in the
multi-event competition at the Mt. San Antonio College
Relays, a performance which gave
him confidence and momentum
going into this weekend's champi
onships.
"I just stayed relaxed, and I get to
the track and I start getting fo
cused," Gleason said.
"I've been doing it for awhile,

When you're alone,
besides the head
ache and thinking
you're going to
throw up there's a
sigh of relief be
cause you finished.'

land the thing I found was], just
d< >n't worry. The last thing I want to
do Is worry about how things are
going to go. I've competed against
these guys times and times before
and it makes it a lot more low-key
knowing everybody on a first-name
basis."
Along with his point total, Glea
son also set decathlon personal
bests on the first day of competition
in the 400 meters and the high

jump, which came after so-so per
formances in the 100 meters, the
longjump and the shot put.
"It evens out. I know things will
go my way," he said. Whether it is
finishing up the day or during the
next day, things even out."
Lananna also applauded Jack
son and Lawyer's performances,
which fulfilled his hope of having
both athletes placing at Pac-lOs.
"It was great. We scored two peo
ple in the Pac-lOs. I'm very, veiy
happy with it."
The decathlon and the hep
tathlon are both exhausting, two
day competitions which require
both physical and mental tough
ness.
For Gleason, however, the multi
event competition is something he
cherishes.
"I love it,"he said. "You can't get
bored with it. There's too much to
practice and too much to do.
"The 1,500 [which is the last
event of a decathlon] hurts while
you're running it. You're thinking,
'Why do I do this?' But then when
you're done, besides the headache
and thinking you're going to throw
up, there's a sigh of relief because
you finished. Then, the rest of the
day you're on a high."
All three athletes will have to do
some quick healing, because they
are all slated to compete in next
weekend's section of the Pac-lOs.
Gleason qualified in the 110-meter
hurdles, while Lawyer will be com
peting in the high jump and long
jump and Jackson in the high jump
and shot put.
