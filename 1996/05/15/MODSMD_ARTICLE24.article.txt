## Track trio gives Cardinal a head start at Pac-10s 
### Sam Wang Contributing writer 
The multi-event portion of the Pacific 10 Conference
Track and Field Outdoor Championships quietly took
place last weekend at UCLA's Drake Stadium.
Stanford sent three athletes to compete in the grueling
two-day competition. Sophomore Josh Gleason partici
pated in the decathlon, while freshman Tracye
and sophomore Katrinka Jackson entered the hep
tathlon.
All three athletes placed in the top eight, giving Stan
ford a head start on the scoreboard when the rest of the
Pac-10 Championships takes place this upcoming week
end.
Lawyer came in at sixth place with 4,998 points, and
Jackson rounded out the placings in eighth with 4,569.
Gleason finished fifth in the final standings with a per
sonal-best score of 7,013 points, just barely missing the
NCAA provisional qualifying mark of 7,050.
"I performed well," Gleason said. "Not great, but not
terribly. I wanted to score over 7,000, which I did, barely.
I got us some points, but I still have a lot of room for im
provement."
Head coach Vin Lananna was more generous with his
praise for Gleason's performance.
"Josh did a great job. It was a big improvement from
last year. I am very impressed with his performances," he
said.
Gleason was coming off of a good performance in the
multi-event competition at the Mt. San Antonio College
