# Baseball set for regular-season finale
## No. 7 Cardinal to meet Nevada in final tune-up before NCAA Regionals 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
In recent weeks, things have really come
together for the Stanford baseball team. In
spite of a lofty No. 2 preseason ranking, the
Cardinal had its share of disap; ointments
early in the 1996 campaign. After dropping
three straight games to USC at Sunken Dia
mond, Stanford's record stood at 14-11 over
all and 3-6 in the Pacific-10 Southern Divi
sion.
Coach Mark Marquess' club responded to
the Trojan sweep by winning nine of its next
12 games, but failed to get a win against USC
in its mid-April trip to Los Angeles. That
sweep left Stanford 23-17 overall — 10-11 in
the Six-Pac — and virtually eliminated the
Cardinal from contention for the league title.
Back then, there was little talk of whether
or not Sunken Diamond would be chosen as
the host of an NCAA Regional. But Monday,
Stanford was named one of eight regional
sites on the strength of the Cardinal's second
place finish in the Six-Pac and its tremendous
success on the field through the late part of
the regular season.
Since the frustrating road trip against
USC, the Cardinal (39-17) has reeled off a
school-record 16-game winning streak and
has risen to No. 7 in the national rankings
after dropping as low as No. 18.
Stanford will conclude its regular-season
schedule tonight when it faces off with Neva
da (28-18) at 7 p.m. at Sunken Diamond. The
two teams met in late March, with the Cardi
nal prevailing by a score of 7-3. Stanford
launched four home runs in that game and
the freshman combination of Chad Hutchin
son and Tony Cogan pitched the team to vic
tory.
Hutchinson, who struck out 10 Wolfpack
batters in 7 1/3 innings en route to the win at
Nevada, will get the nod tonight. Since be
coming a starter, Hutchinson has been con
sistent in his outings, postinga 7-1 record and
a 3.30 earned run average.
Offensively, the Stanford bats have been
busy, as the team has hit .340 during the 16-
game winning streak. One of the hottest Car
dinal batsmen senior ''tVov Kent,
who has blasted seven home runs in the past
16 games, including a grand slam Monday
night against Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo. Kent
is enjoying a 10-game hitting streak, one shy
of his career long, and has hit safely in 14 of
his last 15 games (.345).
Nevada is led offensively by catcher Shane
Slayton (.383, 12 HR, 43 RBI), second base
man Wade Jackson (.379, 13 HR, 53 RBI),
center fielder Scott Pheifer (.362, 7 HR, 47
RBI), first baseman Glen Carson (.352, 10
HR, 53 RBI) and Andy Dominique (.366, 16
HR, 56 RBI). As a team, the Wolfpack has hit
at a .337 clip in 1996.
Nevada enters tonight's meeting with a
modest four-game winning streak, comprised
of a 20-3 win over Sacramento State and a
three-game sweep of Pacific in which the
Wolfpack outscored the Tigers 37-11. Prior to
the Sacramento State game, Nevada was
swept by Nevada-Las Vegas, the winner of
last weekend's Big West Conference Tourna
ment.

Sophomore Kyle Peterson fires one towards home during the Cardinal's 11-2 win over Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo on Monday. Peterson (9-5) allowed just three hits and two runs over eight innings while
striking out six. The right-hander has now won seven of his last eight decisions.
