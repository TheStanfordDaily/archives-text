The Stanford women's crew team made sure the Lam
bert Cup would remain on the Farm for another year by
downing California in last weekend's Big Row. The women
finished the regular season undefeated in dual meet com
petition, out-distancing Cal by three boat lengths en route
to a 6-minute, 35-second finish that eclipsed the old record
by one second.

Senior third baseman Troy Kent helped the No. 7-
ranked Cardinal to an 11-2 win over Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo on Monday by blasting a grand slam in the fourth
inning, the first by a Stanford player all season. Kent, who
has now clubbed seven homers in the last 16 games, ex
tended his hitting streak to 10 games with a 3-for-4,5 RBI
performance.
