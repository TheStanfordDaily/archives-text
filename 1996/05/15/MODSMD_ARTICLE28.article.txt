# Nike commercial fails to make statement on gender
## 
### 
It started with Mars Blackmon and Air
Jordan over a decade ago and continues
today with the presidential run of Ken
Griffey Jr. Of course, I am talking about
Nike's decade-long series of ad campaigns,
which is one of the, if not the, most suc
cessful public relations campaigns the
country has ever seen.
Nike has sold itself better than any com
pany over the last 11 or so years and cer
tainly has put together the strongest, most
powerful shoe company the United States
has ever seen. The rise of Nike began with
the rise of Michael Jordan, the gazillion
dollar superstar with a pretty face and a
five-minute hang time.
Jordan became Nike, and thus, for
years, most of Nike's ads revolved around
his Airness. After enjoying the success Jor
dan brought, Nike began expanding, tak
ing on the likes of Anfernee Hardaway,
Ken Griffey Jr. and other young super
stars. What was even more impressive was
the emergence of many "socially-con
scious" advertisements put out by Nike.
Many of you probably remember the
P.L.A.Y. (Participate in the Lives of Amer
ica's Youth) commercials Nike put out a
few years ago. These spots encouraged peo
ple to get out into the community and help
bring sports to those who, for whatever
reason, lacked the means or the guidance
to have the opportunity to play sports.
Nike followed the P.L.A.Y. campaign
with other Jordan commercials, in which
he dared to ask the question: "If I wasn't an
athlete, would I still be your hero?"
Though I realized Nike was trying to im
prove its image, I appreciated the frank
ness and sincerity of the effort the compa
ny was making. I am not trying to laud

Nike for its sillier spots — "We need some
one in the White House that can hit a Mark
Langston overhand slider." I am simply
saying that Nike started on a track to bring
more serious issues into the sports world.
Nike reached its high point in this arena
earlier this year when it introduced a com
mercial about young girls and sports. The
ad suggested that involving girls in sports
at a young age increases their self-esteem,
makes them less likely to stay in an abusive
relationship, makes them less likely to

have an unwanted pregnancy, etc. To be
honest, I don't know how accurate these
facts are, but to me it doesn't matter —
Nike was encouraging equal opportunity
for everyone and was conscientiously at
tempting to ameliorate gender biases in
sports.
I guess Nike couldn't stand its own pros
perity, because just as Jordan has to even
tually come back down to earth, so did
Nike's ad campaign. Nike, however, did not
land gracefully; rather, the company's
movement toward a greater social con
sciousness came crashing down, and in
doing so, erased much of the progress it


Todd
Bernstein
had made in bettering gender rela
tions.
I am referring to a basketball
commercial that came out during
the NCAA tournament this past
year, in which three women from
the USA Basketball Team — Lisa
Leslie, Dawn Staley and Sheryl
Swoopes — headed out to take on
random male players on an un
specified neighborhood court.
The action is furious in the com
mercial, as game after game seems
to pass, with the women appearing
to be in control of every game.

Then the narrator says: "Now this
isn't a fairy tale, so they (the
women) didn't win every game.
But they won enough to say that
'athletes are athletes and basket
ball is basketball.' "
I remember the first time I saw
this commercial, my sister was the
first to say: "What a great com
mercial." I thought about it and
initially agreed. However, after re
alizing that I had actually agreed
with my sister, I knew something
was wrong. Since then I have had
numerous conversations about the
commercial in sports bars, on bas
ketball courts and even in class. I
have talked about it with both men
and women, and after much analy
sis, I have concluded that Nike

screwed up.
What does this commercial real
ly say? Basically, it says that the
best women basketball players in
the country are not good enough to
beat some neighborhood chumps.
Most people have reacted by analo
gizing the situation to one in which
three Dream Teamers, let's say
Grant Hill, Shaquille O'Neal and
Anfernee Hardaway, strolled
down to any blacktop in the coun
try to run with the neighborhood
stars. I think it is obvious that
there is no trio of non-NBA players
possibly in the world that could
beat them.
Gender equity and equality
have long been issues in college
sports, specifically at Stanford,

where women's basketball has his
torically been a bigger draw than
men's basketball. I have friends
that insist no women's game could
ever be as exciting as a men's
game, and I have friends that
maintain the reverse. Regardless
of which is true, there remains an
unresolved tension in gender is
sues that Nike only exacerbates
with its sexist spot.
I see the future of sports' gen
der issues going in two directions
— women's sports can be thought
of as equal to men's in talent, in
terest and athleticism, or they
can be thought of as distinct from
men's sports, possessing differ
ent, but equally meritorious
characteristics. The problem

with the commercial is that it
does neither.
I think it would have been great
to say that Leslie, Staley and
Swoopes annihilated all of their
competition. It would have made
the statement that women can
compete with men, and that in
deed "athletes are athletes." Con
versely, the ad could have made a
different statement, one that says
"men are men and women are
women, and let's face it, they're
different." Nike fails to do either
and instead created an advertise
ment that wallows in the type of in
decisiveness that plagues gender
issues across the nation.
I know I might actually get
some mail about this one, and that

many may think I am sexist, but I
feel I should purport what I feel is
the most appropriate tact to take,
regardless of its popularity. It's
time that we acknowledge the dif
ferences between men and women
and in the differing athletic quali
ties of each. Women's basketball
shouldn't be compared to men's —
it is its own entity which should be
appreciated on its own merits, not
in relation to a characteristically
different male game.
Nike dropped the ball and failed
to make a statement in either di
rection. Basically, the only state
ment the commercial made is that
"Nike is Nike, money is money,
and that's all the company will
ever be interested in."
