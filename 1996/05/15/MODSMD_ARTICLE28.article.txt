# Nike commercial fails to make statement on gender
## 
### 
It started with Mars Blackmon and Air
Jordan over a decade ago and continues
today with the presidential run of Ken
Griffey Jr. Of course, I am talking about
Nike's decade-long series of ad campaigns,
which is one of the, if not the, most suc
cessful public relations campaigns the
country has ever seen.
Nike has sold itself better than any com
pany over the last 11 or so years and cer
tainly has put together the strongest, most
powerful shoe company the United States
has ever seen. The rise of Nike began with
the rise of Michael Jordan, the gazillion
dollar superstar with a pretty face and a
five-minute hang time.
Jordan became Nike, and thus, for
years, most of Nike's ads revolved around
his Airness. After enjoying the success Jor
dan brought, Nike began expanding, tak
ing on the likes of Anfernee Hardaway,
Ken Griffey Jr. and other young super
stars. What was even more impressive was
the emergence of many "socially-con
scious" advertisements put out by Nike.
Many of you probably remember the
P.L.A.Y. (Participate in the Lives of Amer
ica's Youth) commercials Nike put out a
few years ago. These spots encouraged peo
ple to get out into the community and help
bring sports to those who, for whatever
reason, lacked the means or the guidance
to have the opportunity to play sports.
Nike followed the P.L.A.Y. campaign
with other Jordan commercials, in which
he dared to ask the question: "If I wasn't an
athlete, would I still be your hero?"
Though I realized Nike was trying to im
prove its image, I appreciated the frank
ness and sincerity of the effort the compa
ny was making. I am not trying to laud

Nike for its sillier spots — "We need some
one in the White House that can hit a Mark
Langston overhand slider." I am simply
saying that Nike started on a track to bring
more serious issues into the sports world.
Nike reached its high point in this arena
earlier this year when it introduced a com
mercial about young girls and sports. The
ad suggested that involving girls in sports
at a young age increases their self-esteem,
makes them less likely to stay in an abusive
relationship, makes them less likely to

have an unwanted pregnancy, etc. To be
honest, I don't know how accurate these
facts are, but to me it doesn't matter —
Nike was encouraging equal opportunity
for everyone and was conscientiously at
tempting to ameliorate gender biases in
sports.
I guess Nike couldn't stand its own pros
perity, because just as Jordan has to even
tually come back down to earth, so did
Nike's ad campaign. Nike, however, did not
land gracefully; rather, the company's
movement toward a greater social con
sciousness came crashing down, and in
doing so, erased much of the progress it
