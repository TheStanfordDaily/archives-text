# Adventurous women
## Students participate in groundbreaking study

If you looked at The Daily's
classified page last winter, per
haps you noticed an advertise
ment that read, "Wanted: Young
Women With a Sense of Adven
ture." Approximately 130 women
responded to this ad, and 19 of
them have committed themselves
to being subjects in a study on the
effects of the menstrual cycle on
acclimatization, including
women's exercise physiology and
metabolic needs at altitude.
"What an incredible thing it is
for women to volunteer to do
this," said Gail Butterfield, direc
tor of nutrition studies at the Palo
Alto Veterans Affairs Hospital
Health Care System and a guest
lecturer in the Human Biology
Program at Stanford. "They are
an amazing group of women.
"Especially interesting to me,
and for women in general, are the
implications regarding fuel uti
lization across the menstrual
cycle," Butterfield said.
The study compares the ac
climatization process in the follic
ular phase with the luteal phase,
Butterfield said. The follicular

phase includes menstruation and
the proliferative phase before ovu
lation, while the luteal phase en
compasses the weeks between
ovulation and the beginning of the
next menses. The women will be
paid $1,000 to participate in the
study.
Little research has been com
pleted regarding how women's
bodies adjust to high altitude con
ditions, Butterfield said. This
study, which has received more
than $1 million in funding from the
Department of Defense's Women's
Health Initiative, will take place
over the next three years. The
study involves teams of re
searchers from the University of
Colorado Health Sciences Center,
the Palo Alto VA Health Care Sys
tem and the U.S. Army Institute of
Environmental Medicine.
The Army is interested in the
study in order to obtain informa
tion about women's performance
at altitude, which might affect
military strategy, said Lt. Col.
Paul Rock, the study's principal
investigator from the Army.
