# Adventurous women
## Students participate in groundbreaking study 
### Ellie Behrstock 
If you looked at The Daily's
classified page last winter, per
haps you noticed an advertise
ment that read, "Wanted: Young
Women With a Sense of Adven
ture." Approximately 130 women
responded to this ad, and 19 of
them have committed themselves
to being subjects in a study on the
effects of the menstrual cycle on
acclimatization, including
women's exercise physiology and
metabolic needs at altitude.
"What an incredible thing it is
for women to volunteer to do
this," said Gail Butterfield, direc
tor of nutrition studies at the Palo
Alto Veterans Affairs Hospital
Health Care System and a guest
lecturer in the Human Biology
Program at Stanford. "They are
an amazing group of women.
"Especially interesting to me,
and for women in general, are the
implications regarding fuel uti
lization across the menstrual
cycle," Butterfield said.
The study compares the ac
climatization process in the follic
ular phase with the luteal phase,
Butterfield said. The follicular

phase includes menstruation and
the proliferative phase before ovu
lation, while the luteal phase en
compasses the weeks between
ovulation and the beginning of the
next menses. The women will be
paid $1,000 to participate in the
study.
Little research has been com
pleted regarding how women's
bodies adjust to high altitude con
ditions, Butterfield said. This
study, which has received more
than $1 million in funding from the
Department of Defense's Women's
Health Initiative, will take place
over the next three years. The
study involves teams of re
searchers from the University of
Colorado Health Sciences Center,
the Palo Alto VA Health Care Sys
tem and the U.S. Army Institute of
Environmental Medicine.
The Army is interested in the
study in order to obtain informa
tion about women's performance
at altitude, which might affect
military strategy, said Lt. Col.
Paul Rock, the study's principal
investigator from the Army.

tude," Rock said. "If they have de
creased performance, either physi
cal or mental, that could compro
mise a battle or a war. Women in the
military don't have a choice about
going to altitude. It's their job.
"The military is interested in
finding the interaction between the
different menstrual cycle hor
mones and acclimatization," Rock
added. "The results might influ
ence strategy, how we plan military
operations, whether we send
women up in the follicular phase or
the luteal phase."
In addition to possibly influenc
ing military planning, the study's
findings will greatly contribute to
what is known about women's phys
iology in general, said Jacinda Maw
son, one of the study's research as
sistants who is coterming in anthro
pology at Stanford.
"Research on women is long over
due," Mawson said. "Instead of con
tinuing to assume that women and
men will respond similarly to altitude,
our team of researchers will actually
find out the answers ... which will
help to define the physiological, meta
bolic, cardiovascular and respiratory
changes in women at altitude."
The study is divided into two por
tions. The first part of the study, in
tended to determine baseline meta
bolic rates and exercise performance
at sea level, began early this spring.
Participants have been spending
considerable amounts of time, in
cluding 12 overnight visits, at the
Aging Study Unit of the Palo Alto
VA Health Care System, where the

sea-level part of the study is being
held.
In July, tests will continue for
the altitude portion of the study at
the summit of Colorado's Pike's
Peak, at an elevation of 14,110 feet
above sea level. The participants in
the study will be flown out to Col
orado at different times based upon
the timing of their ovulation or
menstruation.
Procedures during both the sea
level and altitude portions include
measuring blood sugar levels before
and after exercise, undergoing en
durance tests created by the Army
and having electrodes attached to
the chest for a 24-hour period to
record the heart's electrical activi
ty-
In addition, participants are re
quired to monitor their basal body
temperature on a daily basis, follow
a standardized diet for portions of
the study and occasionally save
urine and stool samples for analysis.
"It is very demanding on your
body," said junior Jaime Waterman,
one of the participants in the study.
"I don't even know how many times
I've been stuck with a needle. We've
had tutorial catheters in one arm
and a venous line in the other,
they're dripping in us, and you're
riding a stationary bike with a hel
met on and breathing into a tube to
monitor your air."
However, despite such intrusive
and exhausting procedures, Water
man said she is proud to be part of
the study. "Putting myself under
these physical (conditions) . . .
showed me that my body is strong
and can handle these things. It's not
just us being subjects. We are all
learning so much about our bodies.
The researchers are awesome, al
ways teaching us something."
