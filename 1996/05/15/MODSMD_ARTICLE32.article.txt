Mall chase results in arrest
Stanford Police apprehended an alleged bike thief
after chasing him by car through the Stanford Shop
ping Center Monday.
The chase began shortly before 11 a.m. on Ar
boretum Road when Stanford Police Deputy Ba'b
Henderson noticed a disheveled man riding an ex
pensive bicycle, Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said. When the man, who was identified
yesterday as 27-year-old Fustasio Sandoval-Vargas
of Hayward, refused to stop, Henderson gave chase.
Henderson cruised past the potted plants and
manicured lawns of the shopping center, store own
ers said, describing the action as "very exciting. "
Weaving around the circular hedges of the mall
near Neiman Marcus, Henderson screeched to a halt
at the food court center where about 30 customers
sat, said mall employees who declined to identify
themselves.
"A police car pulled over really fast and the cop
jumped out of the car, [then he ran I inside the Street
Market area," said Geety Ahrari, a customer re
searcher at the center. "The crowd was very
amazed."
Ruben Fuentez, working at a floral shop in the
area, saw the chase. "The officer yelled, 'Stop that

guy,' and I took off after him," he said.
Fuentez followed Sandoval-Vargas past the
Ronald McDonald House until he turned down a
dead-end street. When he slowed down Fuentez
kicked the hack tire of the bike, destabilizing it. San
doval-Vargas then jumped through a hole in the
fence leading into San Francisquito Creek, Fuentez
said.
Police apprehended Sandoval-Vargas at a local
bus stop after he had changed clothes, and Fuentez
said he later positively identified him.
Monday's chase was the first incident in which a
police car drove through the mall, said Carolyn
Johnson, assistant director of the shopping center.
The bike, which was from the Human Biology
building, was valued at more than $1,000, Niemeyer
said.
Grand theft charges will likely be filed today,
Niemeyer said. Sandoval-Vargas is being held at
Santa Clara County Jail, he said.
Student leads high-speed chase
A Stanford student, who has yet to be arrested, al
legedly took Stanford police on a chase early Saturday
morning at about 2:42 a.m.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemey
er, Officer Harris Kuhn was in the Cowell Cluster

parking lot when he observed a red Jeep-type vehicle
speeding on Bowdoin Street.
Kuhn attempted to catch up to the vehicle, which
accelerated to speeds of more than 60 mph. The jeep
was "recklessly swerving around cars and busted a
stop sign on Stanford Ave.," Niemeyer said.
The driver then headed east on Bowdoin, "jumped
a curb and went over the pan basher, an area restrict
ed to emergency veilicles only," Niemeyer said." It took
off into the College Terrace area. Then he appeared to
lose control of the vehicle."
The vehicle crashed into a driveway at Bowdoin
Street and California Avenue. The driver then bailed
out of the car and took ofTon foot, Niemeyer said, dis
appearing into Stanford Research Park.
Stanford Police, with the help of the Palo Alto Po
lice Department, set up a perimeter but the suspect
"was able to elude the dragnet," Niemeyer said.
Three passengers remained in the vehicle and in
formed police that they had come from a fraternity
party.
"We will be seeking a complaint and warrant of ar
rest for felony reckless driving and evading arrest,"
Niemeyer said. "He was endangering the lives of the
passengers, of members of the community, the deputy
that was following him and his own life."
"We have the vehicle, we know who he is, and as

soon as we have a warrant I will announce his name,"
Niemeyer said.
Bike thief apprehended
Police arrested Nestor Sedillo, 37, for bike theft on
May 6.
Sedillo was apprehended after Deputy Ba'b
Henderson noticed a suspicious character near
the bike racks at Florence Moore Hall, said Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
According to Niemeyer, the individual was
"casing the bikes" and then was seen to be
"strolling away with a bicycle with a flat tire."
Henderson asked the individual if he was the
owner of the bicycle. Sedillo responded that it be
longed to a friend, Niemeyer said.
Sedillo was brought into the station and con
fessed to attempting to steal the bike. "He was ar
rested for felony bike theft because he has had
some prior convictions," Niemeyer said.
Calling Henderson's work an "excellent ar
rest," Niemeyer recalled at least one other inci
dent involving the same criminal in 1994 when he
attempted to steal a bike in front of Hoover
Tower.
