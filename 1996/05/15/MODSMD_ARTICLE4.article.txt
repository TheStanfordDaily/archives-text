The Palo Alto Unified School District is consider
ing relocating children currently attending Escondi
do Elementary School to other elementary schools in
the district, a proposal which has upset many parents
living in Escondido Village.
A committee advising Superintendent Jim Brown
on space allocations released several proposals last
week to the school board with ideas on how to deal
with district-wide enrollment problems, according to
Director of Graduate Residences Chris Griffith.
One of the proposals is to move the students and
staff from Hoover Elementary School, an alternative
school, to Escondido School — freeing up the building
currently occupied by Hoover for other children in
the area. Consequently, many of the students at Es
condido School would be bused to other schools, pos

area and the Los Altos Hills area, according to Grif

Hoover is one of two alternative schools in the Palo
Alto school district that is not part of the regular
neighborhood schools but draws students from all
over the district. According to Deputy Superinten
dent Patricia Einfalt, it is considered a traditional
school, in which the curriculum is very structured
and teacher-directed.
Currently, certain Palo Alto elementary schools
are experiencing more rapid rates of enrollment than
others. While Barron Park — where Hoover is locat
ed — is experiencing heavy growth, Escondido School
is declining in enrollment, Einfalt said.
Escondido School is located in Escondido Village,
on land which was given by Stanford to the district
with the stipulation that it be used as a public educa
tion facility at all times. Escondido School services
