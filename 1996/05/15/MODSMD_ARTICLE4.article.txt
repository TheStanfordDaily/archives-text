# Relocation proposed for Escondido schoolchildren
## 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
The Palo Alto Unified School District is consider
ing relocating children currently attending Escondi
do Elementary School to other elementary schools in
the district, a proposal which has upset many parents
living in Escondido Village.
A committee advising Superintendent Jim Brown
on space allocations released several proposals last
week to the school board with ideas on how to deal
with district-wide enrollment problems, according to
Director of Graduate Residences Chris Griffith.
One of the proposals is to move the students and
staff from Hoover Elementary School, an alternative
school, to Escondido School — freeing up the building
currently occupied by Hoover for other children in
the area. Consequently, many of the students at Es
condido School would be bused to other schools, pos
sibly Nixon Elementary School, which currently con
sists of students from the Stanford faculty housing

area and the Los Altos Hills area, according to Grif
fith.
Hoover is one of two alternative schools in the Palo
Alto school district that is not part of the regular
neighborhood schools but draws students from all
over the district. According to Deputy Superinten
dent Patricia Einfalt, it is considered a traditional
school, in which the curriculum is very structured
and teacher-directed.
Currently, certain Palo Alto elementary schools
are experiencing more rapid rates of enrollment than
others. While Barron Park — where Hoover is locat
ed — is experiencing heavy growth, Escondido School
is declining in enrollment, Einfalt said.
Escondido School is located in Escondido Village,
on land which was given by Stanford to the district
with the stipulation that it be used as a public educa
tion facility at all times. Escondido School services
the children of Stanford students living in Escondido
Village as well as the College Ter
race area, which is south of Escon
dido Village on Page Mill Express
way. Nixon School is also located
on Stanford property.
"This is just an idea, and not
necessarily the best one," said
Julie Jerome, president of the dis
trict's school board. "The chances
that Hoover needs to move are
pretty high, but moving to Escon
dido [School] is one of many pro
posals, and no more likely than the
others."
Jerome said other options in
clude moving Hoover to Nixon
School or Garland Elementary
School on California Avenue
which is currently unoccupied.
"There is a perception that
[Stanford students) are expend
able," said Chris Shockman, a
graduate student in civil engineer
ing and mother of a child who at
tends Escondido School. "Every

plan talks about us going to Nixon.
The faculty children probably
won't be bused (to Escondido
School); it is more likely that we'd
be bused out (to Nixon)."
Most parents currently living
in Escondido Village will not be af
fected by any changes at Escondi
do School, due to the quick
turnover of Escondido Village res
idents. Yet parents have expressed
concern about busing Escondido
Village children out of the local
community.
"Escondido (School) is a refuge
against the strangeness of the cul
ture here," said Shockman, who
cited the convenience of the prox
imity of the school to the resi
dences and the after-school pro
grams which unite the children.
"People come here from every
where. Itisavery uniqueculture."
Shockman said she sees the
need for an incentive for busing in
order for Escondido Village par
ents to accept the proposal. "Right
now it would just be an inconve
nience. They need to entice people;
otherwise it is just uprooting a

community. It is just busing for
the convenience of the school dis
trict."
A group of parents met last
night to educate the Escondido
Village community about what
might happen, which some par
ents hoped would incite future ac
tion against the proposal.
Einfalt acknowledged the dis
tress of parents in the Escondido
Village community, but said she
thinks that distress would occur in
any community, because people
see their neighborhood school as
an integral part of the whole com
munity.
"Any place where we move the
alternative school we would get
the same reaction," Einfalt said.
The teaching system at Hoover,
which does not permit student or
parent volunteers, would continue
were Hoover to move to the Escon
dido School site. However, Escondi
do School currently utilizes many
Stanford students — not all of
whom are parents — as volunteers.
Many students at Escondido
School are non-English speaking,

due to the presence of internation
al graduate students. Susan Gid
dings, whose husband is a Stan
ford law student and has two chil
dren at Escondido School, cited an
example of an Escondido School
mother who would attend some
classes with her child, who was
just learning English, to provide
additional help to the child. If this
student attended Hoover, the par
ent intervention would not be pos
sible, according to Giddings.
Shockman said she felt the pro
posal was done in a "politically cir
cumspect fashion," and that not
many people know what is occur
ring.
The committee had very little
time to come up with the proposal,
and made it clear to the board
when they presented the proposal
that they "did not have a favored
package, they had pieces of ideas,"
Jerome said. She has invited each
school to submit information to
educate the board about any
unique aspects of their school that
the board should know before
making any decisions.
