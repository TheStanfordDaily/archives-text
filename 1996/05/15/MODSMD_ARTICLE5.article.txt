# ASSU keeps appointments, despite Murdock's wishes
## 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Disregarding
the views of Sen
ate Chair Alane
Murdock, the
ASSU senate
voted last night
to let stand exist
ing appoint
ments to next
year's Program

Board and Speakers Bureau.
At the heart of the issue is how
rigorously ASSU Bylaws should be
adhered to. Murdock initiated a
new search to fill positions which
both the Program Board and

Speakers Bureau had already in
ternally appointed, drawing com
plaints from senators who claimed
that Murdock took these steps be
cause she disliked the choices.
"I don't care who fills these po
sitions," Murdock said. "The
ASSU has a distinct interest in fol
lowing its bylaws."
A member of the Council of
Presidents said redoing the selec
tion process was a bow to partisan
ship.
"Redoing the entire process is
not what the senate is there for,"
said COP member Jon Oram.
"We're not going to circumvent
the entire process so they can have
the people who they want in

there."
According to ASSU Bylaws, a
senate selection committee, along
with the Nominations Commis
sion, is charged with hiring em
ployees for the Program Board and
Speakers Bureau before the begin
ning of spring quarter.
In the absence of such commit
tees, both the Program Board and
the Speakers Bureau went ahead
with the hiring process and select
ed candidates.
Murdock — who stepped down
as chair during the meeting to take
part in the debate — became aware
of the process, determined that it

was done out of order and began
the hiring process again.
"It is very clearly laid out in the
bylaws how this should be done,"
she said. "This is a simple choice in
whether you believe in upholding
the bylaws or not."
Members of the organizations
affected, however, claim that Mur

dock overstepped her bounds and
interpreted the process too strin
gently.
"This came out of the blue,"
said senior Paul Kwan, the Pro
gram Board's director. "It popped
out of nowhere. We just followed
the procedure that has been used
in past years."
Members of the Program Board
said they needed new employees in
place by spring quarter in order to
begin the training process.
"Taking the initiative that the

senate lacked, (Kwanl and I went
through the process ourselves,"
said Jeff Giesea, Program Board
deputy director. "No one objected,
even Alane. One month later, she's
pulling this."
Murdock said she was attempt
ing only to follow procedure.
"This process should have been
followed every year," she said. "We
had a similar issue when we tried
to dispense with the selection
process for the financial manager.
We need to have a full selection

process. We have a responsibility
to follow the bylaws."
Graduate senator Doug Natel
son said it was not the organiza
tions' responsibility for ensuring
that the bylaws were followed cor
rectly.
"This shouldn't be a trial for the
Program Board and Speakers Bu
reau," he said. "It is not the re
sponsibility of them to come to us
and make sure that we follow our
rules. It is not their responsibility
to seek us out."
