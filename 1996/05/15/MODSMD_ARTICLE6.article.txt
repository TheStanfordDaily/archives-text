Researchers at the Stanford Human Genome
Center have developed a computer program that can
map the human genome quicker and more efficient
ly than other programs currently in use.
"Mapper," as the program is called, keeps track of
where unique sequences of DNA occur and how close
they are to each other. By using these sequences as
reference points, the entire human genome can be
mapped out and show the location of genes on the 23
human chromosomes. The map can be continually
updated as more sequence information comes in.
"These maps have better resolution in local areas

than the available whole genome maps," Genetics
Prof. David Cox, co-director of the center, said in a
statement. Other programs in use today can calcu
late the general arrangement of genes on a chromo
some, but Mapper can pinpoint the exact location of
genes, provided that enough local "landmarks" are
known, he said.
"The real power of this program is that aside from
generating maps for us here, it's also available on the
World Wide Web, so any scientist can use it," Cox
said. "They can take DNA that they are interested in
and, using the same chemicals that we used, send in
a bar code of their data, and within five minutes they
will get e-mail showing where on the human genome
the DNA is located.
"Mapping the human genome is like trying to
