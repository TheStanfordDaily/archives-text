# Stanford researchers develop computer program to track DNA
## Genome mapping gets easier

Researchers at the Stanford Human Genome
Center have developed a computer program that can
map the human genome quicker and more efficient
ly than other programs currently in use.
"Mapper," as the program is called, keeps track of
where unique sequences of DNA occur and how close
they are to each other. By using these sequences as
reference points, the entire human genome can be
mapped out and show the location of genes on the 23
human chromosomes. The map can be continually
updated as more sequence information comes in.
"These maps have better resolution in local areas

than the available whole genome maps," Genetics
Prof. David Cox, co-director of the center, said in a
statement. Other programs in use today can calcu
late the general arrangement of genes on a chromo
some, but Mapper can pinpoint the exact location of
genes, provided that enough local "landmarks" are
known, he said.
"The real power of this program is that aside from
generating maps for us here, it's also available on the
World Wide Web, so any scientist can use it," Cox
said. "They can take DNA that they are interested in
and, using the same chemicals that we used, send in
a bar code of their data, and within five minutes they
will get e-mail showing where on the human genome
the DNA is located.
"Mapping the human genome is like trying to
solve a jigsaw puzzle, looking only
at whether or not two pieces fit to
gether. This program allows you
to look at the overall puzzle to
evaluate whether or not the
pieces really go together," Cox
said.
The amount of DNA in each in
dividual is so immense it is hard
to comprehend. DNA contains all
the information necessary for
life. It contains four different

bases, which are the letters of the
genetic code.
There are six giga-bases in
each cell, and each person has 1 x
1014 cells in his or her body.
When the specific size of the base
is calculated, it is found that each
person has about 25 solar system
diameters of DNA coiled up tight
ly in his or her cells. This is what
scientists want to map out to bet
ter understand genetic diseases
and humans themselves.
"Previously it would take us
months to build a map," Assoc.
Genetics Prof. Richard Myers, di
rector of the center, said in a

statement. "Now we can rebuild it
everyday. Our maps are much
more accurate because we can
map everything at once."
Other computer mapping pro
grams keep track of the unique se
quences in the 23 human chromo
somes and look for all conceivable
ways that the markers could be
related to each other in space.
This method, while useful for
small numbers of markers, is not
powerful enough to map the
human genome.
The human map will require
thousands of markers, and the
computing power to search all

possible combinations does not
exist.
Instead ofsearchingforall pos
sible arrangements of certain
markers, Mapper uses a shortcut.
It ignores certain unlikely combi
nations of genetic markers, thus
shortening the amount of time
and resources needed to produce a
detailed map.
Someday this sort of program
could be used to look at the DNA
from specific individuals, such as
the tumors in cancer patients,
and see if two gene markers were
rearranged to cause the abnormal
cell growth.
