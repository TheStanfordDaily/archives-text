sory board that will use methods of alternative dis
pute resolution. Waxman will help select, train and
oversee the board members.
"Ellen has the full set of skills for this job. She is
self-confident, has thought deeply
and written about .. . mediation
issues and is very knowledgeable
about campus life," Koseff said.
"She understands the need of

the ombudsperson to be proactive
in counselingthe president's office
while still maintaining a neutral,
confidential role."
