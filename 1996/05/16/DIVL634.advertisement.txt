Story and graphic by Mike Noren
The critics are all missing
The point of what you're doing
This ugly conversation
Is getting really boring.
—"For Your Entertainment," Unwound
Olympia's Unwound haven't always
gotten along with the qpusic press. The
reason is simple: Unwound believe that
sound cannot be accurately described
with language. Front man Justin Trosper
requests that interview stories be written
in straight question-and-answer format
rather than as completed articles, and
their publicist attributes this to the way
the band has been misinterpreted in the
past. Trosper seems vaguely satisfied that
I'm willing to comply with his request, but
he still seems irked by the whole music
journalism thing, as his answers to my
questions rarely exceed a polite but disin
terested sentence or two.
I guess the point is that Unwounds
music speaks for itself. Singer / guitarist
Trosper, drummer Sara Lund and bassist
Vernon Ramsey are as intense a three-piece
as you'll find, and their fifth album, "Repe
tition," might be their best work yet. Utv
wound's brand of inventive punk is as
unique as it is powerful, and one trip
through "Repetition" is sure to tell you
much more than a magazine story ever
could.
INT: I heard that you request that the in
terviewer just write the Story as questions
and answers instead of as an actual article.
JT: Mm-hm.
INT: So that's how you like it to be, gener
ally?
JT: Yeah. That's a preference.
INT: Why's that?
JT: It's because 1 like reading interviews over
reading articles, personally, when I read a
magazine or whatever.
INT: Do you think bands, or Olympia
bands in particular, have had problems
being misinterpreted by the press?
JT: Yeah. I mean, it always happens. All
bands get misinterpreted.
INT: Does it happen to you a lot?
JT: Yeah, 1 think it does. I think at first it's
shocking or annoying or something, but
then after a while I don't really care.
INT: In what ways do you think you've
been misrepresented?
JT: 1 don't know if it's misrepresentation as
much as just misinterpretation. 1 mean, it's
just hard to describe music, I think. Some
people just get carried away or something
with their descriptions. Or they hear some
thing and blow it out of proportion.
INT: The song "For Your Entertainment"
on "Repetition," was that inspired by your
problems with the press?
JT: It's sort of a combination of that and just
— I just woke up, sorry — a combination of
that and things outside of music, or 1 mean,
around music that aren't music that affect.
.. fuck. Never mind.
INT: That song seems sort of rare in that it
seems to have a more specific subject mat
ter than most Unwound songs. Would you
say that, lyrically at least, your songs are
generally somehow non-specific?
IT: Yeah. I mean, sometimes they have spe
cific meanings to me, but I don't really ever
go out of my way to explain it, because I
don't think it necessarily matters. But that
one definitely is more pointed.
INT: So how was the approach to "Repeti
tion" different from the approach to previ
ous albums?
JT: I don't know if the approach is that
much different. We took a little more time
recording it. I mean it sounds a little differ
ent, but I don't think our approach was that
much different. I mean, a couple songs are
like songs we don't play live.
INT: Why's that?
IT: We just wanted to do something that was
just studio-oriented.
INT: Which tracks are those?
IT: Like the instrumental ones. 1 mean, I'm
into the idea of having stuff that's kind of
just studio.
INT: Do you think you've experimented
more in the studio recently?
JT: A little bit. There's like keyboards and
stuff. It's not that experimental.
INT: So is there any reason why you decid
ed to call the album "Repetition"?
JT: I like that word. It sort of describes a lot of
things. People have said that our music is rep
etitious. So I thought it would be funny if we
called out record that. Plus it's our fifth record,
so we're like repeating things over and over.
INT: Has it been hard doing five albums in
five years?
JT: No. We just work that way, you know —
write songs, go on tour, record, put out a
record. It's just like repetition, man, over
and over.
INT: So how did Unwound get started?
JT: It was like summer of '91 — so it's al
most five years — and that was with our
first drummer. We'd been in bands before
that, for a few years. So it was just like an ex
tension of what we'd already been doing,
but more focused, and more musical.
INT: Did it help that you got started in
Olympia?
JT: Sorry?
INT: Was there definitely a more receptive
scene in Olympia than you'd have at other
locations?
JT: You mean when we started out?
INT: Yeah.
JT: We played all of our early shows here, in
our other bands too. I mean, this is where
we grew up. I don't know, we've gotten
more responsive crowds other places. But
yeah, we've always, at some level or another,
been accepted, and people have always been
supportive and helpful and stuff. In that re
spect, Olympia's really good for us. Not for
everybody, I guess, but we've got a lot of
friends here and stuff.
INT: I've heard rumors about Unwound
signing to a major label and all that. Is any
of that true?
JT: No, we didn't sign to a major label. We
did a publishing thing.
INT: And so what are the terms of that
deal?
JT: It's hard to explain. If we wanted to be in
a movie or on a movie soundtrack or some
thing, they would deal with that, you know
with radio airplay and money and just crap
th.it no one cares about. But it was a way to
get some money so we could survive.
INT: Who's the deal with?
JT: BMG.
• • P
INT: So how big is this tour that you're
about to go on?
IT: Well, we just went on a six-week tour of
Europe and now we're going on a six-week
tour of the States, starting Monday.
INT: You looking forward to it?
JT: Not right now. But I'm sure it will be fine
once we're on tour.
INT: Have you played at the Bottom of the
HiU in San Francisco before?
JT: Yeah. We've played there twice, 1 think.
I NT: Yeah, you're playing there on the 16th.
JT: Offline?
INT: No, of next week.
JT: Oh yeah. I forgot. Because we're going
there twice. We're not playing there the sec
ond time. I forgot. Because we're going
there and then we're going east from there
and then we're circling all around and com
ing up from L.A. I couldn't remember
which time we were playing there.
INT: So what sorts of music have you been
listening to lately?
IT: Actually, 1 haven't been listening to very
much music On tour I've been reading
more.
INT: What have you been reading?
JT: Books. The last book I read was "Paint
ed Bird" by Jerzy Kosinski. He's a Polish
writer. Rudv Rucker, science-fiction guv
Philip K.Dick.
INT: So what else do you do in your time
away from music?
JT: I play in a couple bands.
INT: What other bands do you play with?
JT: Severed Lethargy, Replikants and this
band called Worst Case Scenario.
INT: What do you play with them?
JT: In Worst Case Scenario, I play guitar. In
the other bands, it just varies.
INT: So all those are based out of Olympia?
JT: Yeah.
INT: Are their approaches similar or pretty
different from Unwound?
JT: They're all different.
INT: Umm, anyway, this is going to be for a
one-page feature that's going to run on the
16th, the day of your show. So is there any
thing else you want to add or anything you
think should go into one of these features?
JT: Watch out for the fascists. I just took a
nap, so I'm sort of out of it. Umi*i, 1 hope
the Sonics win.
