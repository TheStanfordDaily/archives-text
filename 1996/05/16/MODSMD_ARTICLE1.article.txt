## Is Stanford's image everything? 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
As costs rise and funding becomes scarce, uni
versities are forced more than ever to create
sparkling images of themselves.
A number of controversies hitting Stanford
over the past several years have raised the Uni
versity's consciousness of its outside appearance.
The change in presidencies four years ago marked
a new approach to public relations.
Within the administrative structure of the
University, there is no person or office explicitly
responsible for creating an image. Whether orga
nizations like the Office of University Communi

cations and University News Service actually en
gage in image promotion is debatable.
Stanford's Director of Communications, Terry
Shepard, said a£ one of the clearinghouses for in
formation about campus, his office does not aim to
promote an image for the University.
However, a number of faculty members and
local journalists disagree.
Playing this role is not necessarily a bad step for
the office to take, some say, suggesting that Stan
ford could benefit from more public relations ac
tivities.
Regardless of the debate, however, most
agree on one thing: Stanford's image is improv
ing and may be better than it has ever been,

even with several recent controversies.
Creation of the image
Despite the claims of campus PR's officials,
many people say the Office of University Commu
nications and News Service do play a role in creat
ing an image.
"They appear to have gone more corporate,"
said Bill Workman, who has covered Stanford for
the San Francisco Chronicle for more than 15
years.
He pointed to the failed Strategic Communica
tions Plan as an example.
Authored by Shepard, the plan
was famous for attempting to sum
up the University with sue adjectives.
It was withdrawn within days of its
November release by University
President Gerhard Casper after it
was subjected to heavy faculty and
media criticism.
Workman explained that the
University's public relations may be
changing partly in response to a
scandal involving Stanford's indi
rect-cost recovery rate. In 1990, the
federal government accused the
University of using inappropriate
accounting procedures to determine
refund rates for such items as an
tiques in the president's house. The
issue was resolved in 1994 and re
sulted in several changes to the ad
ministration, including the 1992
resignation of then-University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy
"Things such as the indirect-cost
scandal would seem to have forced
Stanford to be more careful," Work
man said.
He said Stanford's willingness to
be open and honest during the scan
dal led to a tremendous amount of
negative press, while other universi
ties guilty of similar violations went
unscathed.
"Stanford tried to explain every
thing, and it sunk deeper and deeper
into the quicksand," he said. "It did
not matter what anybody said."
As a result, Workman said the
University is now more controlling
of information. Still, he added, Stan
ford remains more open than most
colleges and universities.
"I am very impressed with Terry
I Shepard J and (News Service Direc
tor] Doug Foster," Workman said.
"The thing that comes through is a
sincerity and a devotion of getting in
formation out, but at the same time,
being understandably cautious."
Jim Puzzanghera, Stanford beat
writer for the San Jose Mercury
News, agreed that the Office of Uni

versity Communications and News
Service play a crucial role in present
ing an image of Stanford.
"They would be stupid not to try
and convey a certain image," Puz
zanghera said. "There are so many
things going on. If you are running
it, you want to emphasize what is im
portant and what puts out the best
image. It is like a corporation; they
need to attract students, faculty

members and re
search money."
Former News
Service Director
Bob Beyers has
been somewhat
critical of News
Service for not
being as candid as
possible while cov
ering some nega-

tive stories. Beyers resigned in 1990,
after 29 years as director, because of
an ongoing conflict with the Univer
sity administration over the nature
of coverage of negative University
events.
He said News Service's lack of
coverage in certain areas is a result
of administration pressure.
"News Service does a very com
mendable job on covering a broad
segment of faculty, both in Stanford
Report and Stanford Today," he
said. "Its reporters were harshly
criticized by President Casper for
taking the initiative in reporting a
settlement with the state on safety
issues, just as we were years ago by
University attorneys. Lawyers are
loath to recognize the value of cover
ing 'negative' news first."
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni
agreed with Beyers. "I get the sense,
without any real data, that [News
Service] has become a far less critical
organ of the University that likes to
publish mostly good news," he said.
"If we do something stupid, how
ever," Simoni said, "we should be
the first ones to put out that infor
mation."
Puzzanghera said he sees News
Service as trying to play two roles.
"They're trying to do two things:
Be a newspaper that covers the cam

pus and ... be the vehicle for the ad
ministration's point of view on a lot
of issues. That can be difficult," he
said.
"If there were something nega
tive going on, I do not think that
you'd see a press release coming out
a week in advance. They do run neg
ative news in the Stanford Report,
but it is not usually on the front
page."
Shepard said News Service does
indeed cover both good and bad
news.
"News Service makes honest
judgments and reports negative
news, as well as positive," Shepard
said. "Does News Service actively
seek out such positive news as facul
ty research and teaching? Of course.
Teaching, learning and research are
why Stanford exists, and it is highly
successful at them, and it would be
negligent if we did not reflect that."
Reflecting the truth
Shepard said his office tries only
to help reflect the truth about Stan
ford — not create it.
"I don't think anyone consciously
decides what is promoted," Shepard
said. "The University does not en
gage in image promotion and does
not need to.
"Most people have an idea of
Stanford's quality and see it as a
prestigious, excellent university.
Also, because we are a university, we
do not sell ourselves the way people
sell soap, for example."
Unlike some of his critics, Shep
ard says Stanford is not shifting to
ward a more corporate concept of
public relations.
"We don't deal in image, certain
ly not in the Madison Avenue sense,"
he said." Rather, we seek to help peo
ple gain accurate information about

and understanding of its people and
its programs."
News Service, which reports to
Shepard, has a similar concept of its
role. The service produces the week
ly Stanford Report newspaper,
writes press releases and produces a
portion of Stanford Magazine.
"We have six beat reporters that
figure out where the most newswor
thy innovations in learning are hap
pening, " director Foster said.
"We are not an image-creator but
a news and information service,"
Foster said, comparing News Ser
vice to a bridge linking Stanford to
the outside media.
Assistant to the President Jean
Fetter agreed, saying "Stanford lie
port and Stanford Magazine trans
late what is going on at Stanford to
the outside world."
Professionals needed?
Although Shepard said he feels
Stanford does not need a formal
organ for public relations, some fac
ulty members say the University
should rely more on "professionals"
when it comes to its image.
"I think Stanford needs the ser
vices of professional PR people," Si
moni said. "Public relations gets a
bad rap. I think Stanford could use
such guidance."
One of the most avid opponents of
the failed Strategic Communication
Plan, Simoni contends the plan was
actually a good idea that went
wrong.
"I think that what they came up
with was so silly that it was not even
worth it," Simoni said. "I am afraid
that this will cause future efforts to
get put on the back burner. The
backlash was nearly universal. If I
were in that position, I'd be damn
timid of doing that again."

Shepard defended his effort in
creating the plan, calling it "simply a
descriptive document."
"It was not at all prescriptive — in
fact, 'plan' was a misnomer," Shep
ard said. "So, when a few individuals
and newspapers successfully mis
represented it, Mr. Casper withdrew
it with no objection from me."
However, not everybody agrees
that a formal public relations de
partment is the way to go.
"Stanford should not go out and
hire a public relations firm," Work
man said. "A university that takes
that risk ought to be in serious trou
ble."
Beyers also said hiring a public re
lations firm would be unnecessary.
"Over the long term," he said,
"news is the br o t PR."
Image on the upswing
Wherever it is being created,
Stanford's reputation is definitely
on the upswing, Foster said. With
fading memories of the indirect-cost
recovery rate case and rising rank
ings in U.S. News & World Report,
the University's image is looking
better than it has in years.
"I think for several years, there
was much more administrative
news, and I think that was under
standable," Foster said, citing the in
direct-cost scandal and resulting
change in administration as big
news makers. "I think what we are
seeing now is that we are getting
much more coverage of the scholar
ship developing here."
As evidence, he noted that he has
seen a marked increase in faculty
members appearing on National
Public Radio and other similar
media venues. He also said he has
seen more news stories focusing on
Stanford's achievements.

Workman agreed that the Uni
versity's image is on the rise. "I can
see in the journals and in the admis
sions (statistics) that Stanford is still
extremely highly ranked and getting
more and more stature," he said.
"Most of the new class coming in will
have never heard about
costs."
Dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven said
Stanford's academic reputation has
especially been on the rise since
Casper arrived.
"With the new language require
ments, the new grading policy, the
minors, the early-admit system and
the presidential scholars, our theme
has really been on academics, espe
cially since President Casper ar
rived," he said.
"I think the real focus has been
on the curriculum. That is where the
real change has happened in the past
few years."
Fetter also agreed that Stan
ford's image has gotten better in the
areas of curriculum and the indirect
cost controversy. However, 6he had
a final caveat about Stanford's
image, pointing to the recent contro
versy over "The Diversity Myth."
The book, written by Stanford
graduates David Sacks and Peter
Thiel, attacked multiculturalism at
Stanford. After an op-ed piece of
theirs was printed in The Wall Street
Journal, Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice wrote a joint letter in
response, disagreeing with Sacks
and Thiel. . •!
"Stanford represents very differ';
ent things to very different peoplej"
shesaid. "With 1,400 faculty, 14,000
students and 16,000 staff members,
getting one straightforward impres
sion about Stanford's image is im
possible."
