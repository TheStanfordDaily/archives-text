## Is Stanford's image everything? 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
As costs rise and funding becomes scarce, uni
versities are forced more than ever to create
sparkling images of themselves.
A number of controversies hitting Stanford
over the past several years have raised the Uni
versity's consciousness of its outside appearance.
The change in presidencies four years ago marked
a new approach to public relations.
Within the administrative structure of the
University, there is no person or office explicitly
responsible for creating an image. Whether orga
nizations like the Office of University Communi

cations and University News Service actually en
gage in image promotion is debatable.
Stanford's Director of Communications, Terry
Shepard, said aÂ£ one of the clearinghouses for in
formation about campus, his office does not aim to
promote an image for the University.
However, a number of faculty members and
local journalists disagree.
Playing this role is not necessarily a bad step for
the office to take, some say, suggesting that Stan
ford could benefit from more public relations ac
tivities.
Regardless of the debate, however, most
agree on one thing: Stanford's image is improv
ing and may be better than it has ever been,

even with several recent controversies.
Creation of the image
Despite the claims of campus PR's officials,
many people say the Office of University Commu
nications and News Service do play a role in creat
ing an image.
"They appear to have gone more corporate,"
said Bill Workman, who has covered Stanford for
the San Francisco Chronicle for more than 15
years.
He pointed to the failed Strategic Communica
tions Plan as an example.
