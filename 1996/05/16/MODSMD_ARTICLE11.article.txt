Unauthorized cargo found on ValuJet flight
WASHINGTON (AP) — ValuJet was not authorized to carry a cargo load of the oxygen
generators that have come under suspicion in last Saturday's deadly crash in the Ever
glades, the Federal Aviation Administration said yesterday.
While the generators are standard equipment on many planes, they are considered haz
ardous items when carried as cargo, an FAA official said.
"ValuJet is not an authorized 'hazmat' carrier," said the official. He later stressed that
the FAA has not concluded that the airline was carrying dangerous materials. But the pres
ence of the generators has been reported by the National Transportation Safety Board.
The FAA official and the others spoke at a briefing under ground rules in which their
names could not be used.
The vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, Robert Francis, has
said that the DC-9 passenger airliner was carrying more than 50 of the generators back to
its Atlanta headquarters as cargo at the time of the accident.
Philip Morris supports cigarrette ban
NEW YORK (AP) — Philip Morris USA, the nation's No. 1 tobacco company, offered to
support a ban on cigarette vending machines and curbs on advertising yesterday if the FDA
backs off any attempt to regulate cigarettes.
The White House reacted coolly. The proposal "falls a little bit short" of President Clin
ton's demands, spokesman Mike McCurry said without elaborating. But he allowed that
Philip Morris "is clearly trying to become a good corporate citizen."
Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboros and other cigarettes, said it would support a ban
on permanent brand-name advertising in virtually all sports stadiums and the use of cor
porate logos and characters on non-tobacco items. It also would seek to ban all outdoor
advertising of tobacco products within 1,000 feet of a school or a playground.
