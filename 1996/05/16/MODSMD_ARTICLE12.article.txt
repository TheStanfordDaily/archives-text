# Dole resigns seat in the Senate
## White House, GOP politicians stunned at his decision 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In an extraor
dinary, emotional gamble, Bob Dole said
yesterday he was quitting the Senate after
27 years to challenge President Clinton
full time, "with nothing to fall back on but
the judgment of the people."
Stunning the White House and most of
his Republican colleagues, Dole said he
had decided that "as the campaign begins
in earnest, it is my obligation — to the
Senate and to the people of America — to
leave behind all the trappings of power, all
comfort, all security."
Choking back tears, the 72-year-old
Dole said: "The very least a presidential
candidate owes America is his full atten
tion, everything he can give, everything he
has. And that is what America shall
receive from me."
Dole said he would resign his Senate
seat and the powerful post of majority
leader by June 11. "I will then stand before
you without office or authority, a private
citizen, a Kansan, an American, just a
man," he said.
Republicans welcomed the news that
Dole would no longer be distracted by day

to-day Senate duties and a Democratic
minority that has thwarted Dole's effort to
use his Senate perch to draw contrasts
with Clinton.
The White House and Democratic allies
rushed to frame Dole's decision as an act
of desperation by a candidate trailing Clin
ton by as much as 20 points in some polls.
And they said it was proof that Dole's ini
tial strategy of using the Senate as a cam
paign platform had failed miserably.
"I guess he found the choice was
between campaigning and governing and
he chose campaigning," said Clinton
deputy campaign manager Ann Lewis.
Clinton called his political team to the
White House when word of Dole's plans
leaked. In an interview with USA Today,
Clinton said he told his troops: "We just
have to stay on track."
Yet for the first time in months, there
was an obvious sense of nervousness and
uncertainty in the Clinton camp. Several
White House advisers privately conceded
Dole was likely to benefit, at least in the
short term.
If Dole begins to narrow Clinton's lead,

White House aides said, it could force the
president to adopt a busier travel schedule
than now planned.
Dole's decision will close the curtain on
a remarkable congressional career dating
back to 1961, when he began the first of
four House terms. Dole was elected to the
Senate in 1968 and is the longest-serving
Senate liepublican leader in history, hold
ing that post since 1984.
In that job, he served as a loyal lieu
tenant to GOP Presidents Reagan and
Bush — even when he disagreed with
them — and has been a constant thorn in
Clinton's side.
Kansas GOP Gov. Bill Graves will
appoint a successor; freshman GOP Rep.
Sam Brownback immediately said he was
interested.
Dole's stepping down immediately
threw the Republican caucus into turmoil
over a successor. Majority Whip Trent
Lott was considered the favorite but faced
a challenge from his senior Mississippi col
league, Sen. Thad Cochran, one of the
Dole loyalists Lott leapfrogged when he
won the whip post in 1995.
