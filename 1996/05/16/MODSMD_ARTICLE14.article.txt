## Editorial Advice on advising 
### 
Stanford must consider
departmental advising
along with UAC issues

ONE YEAR after the Com
mission on Undergraduate
Education recommended
re-evaluating the advising system,
long a source of discontent among
undergraduates, the University
has outlined several proposed
changes. The Advising Task Force
chaired by Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Ramon Saldi
var last week announced modifica
tions that are hoped will improve
the current system, bringing stu
dents into closer contact with fac
ulty and making advisers more
accessible on a day-to-day basis.
These goals are certainly laud
able and students will likely wel
come any reforms; still, the sug
gestions only scratch the surface
of Stanford's advising problems.
Though the task force paid lip ser
vice to student concerns about
major advising, the actual changes
intended will only be evident at the
Undergraduate Advising Center,
and will not address flaws in the
departmental advising system.
For years, freshmen have com
plained that their advisers are
inaccessible and out of touch with
student concerns. To encourage
communication and provide stu
dents access to knowledgeable
sources, the UAC will soon hire
more additional full-time advisers
and create phone and e-mail hot
lines to answer students' immedi
ate questions, as well as publish a
new advising handbook to help
incoming freshmen begin to use
advising resources. To foster close
faculty contact, the center is
increasing the number of sopho
more seminars and adding new
freshman seminars. In these areas,
the task force has developed palpa
ble solutions to specific problems,
the kind of response undergradu

ates should see given to all aspects
of the advising system.
Instead, the task force has dele
gated the duties of improving
departmental and residence-based
advising to a new administrative
position, director of undergradu
ate advising. When hired, this
director will not only head the new
and improved center, but will also
be given the hazy responsibility of
developing "outreach programs"
to strengthen other aspects of the
advising program.
The University needs to do
more to address the problems of
departmental advisory systems
than simply defer them to a yet
unknown administrator. Major
advising is left to each department
to structure; professors receive no
guidance or training before taking
on advisees and have little impetus
to do so. The task force has stated
that it is still considering the
notion of compensating professors
for departmental advising, but has
successfully avoided taking any
active reform measures.
The improvements to the advis
ing system thus far proposed —
positive though they are — will
only carry the undergraduate com
munity through its first one or two
years at Stanford; the University
must also acknowledge the needs
of students who have already
declared a major. An effective aca
demic advising system should help
students create a four-year cur
riculum to fit both current needs
and future goals.
In ignoring student criticisms of
departmental advising, the task
force has effectively stated that
departmental advising is not only
distinct from pre-major advising,
but is less significant. Students
need a comprehensive program
that not only helps them choose a
major, but also provides a transi
tion into structured major advis
ing.
After a year of discussion, the
task force has presented under
graduates with some appealing
suggestions, but very few actual
solutions.
