## First a prince then a toad 
### 
WHOEVER WROTE THAT
stupid parable about the
princess who went around kiss
ing toads until one turned into a prince
must have been high on crack. How else
could you create a story so inside-out and
backwards? It should be just the opposite
— men seem like princes until you kiss
them, then they turn into toads.
This is the secret to men and romance:
They conceal their toadliness, lying in
ambush and then pouncing. Actually,
"pouncing" is probably the wrong term,
because they usually move agonizingly
slowly, so that each new wound they
inflict can be thoroughly salted.
Have you ever seen how a starfish
feeds? Because it's something like that.
The starfish, the darling of tide pools, is
in fact a beast of unsurpassed cruelty.
Inching across the ocean floor in the most
unassuming manner, the starfish creeps
up on its unsuspecting victim, the clam.
It slowly wraps itself round the poor crea
ture, enveloping it in a passionate
embrace. It grips the shell of the trem
bling clam and waits.
Desperately the little bivalve strains to
maintain its only defense: the cozy,
secure shell that is its home and identity.
The clam clamps down to protect its vul
nerable innards. With all its might it
struggles to keep itself safely closed.
But the starfish is so smooth, so reas
suring, that he eventually lulls the clam
into a moment of complacency. For the

briefest second the clam relaxes into the
starfish's embrace. With a little sigh at the
joy of being held, he unclenches his shell.
And then it's over.
The starfish extrudes his stomach.
That's right folks, the starfish literally
pukes out his stomach — the whole thing
— through the minuscule opening in the
clam's shell and down into its tender
soul. It pours into the clam and oozes out
digestive juices, eating the clam alive.
The clam can do nothing but sit there,
still locked in the embrace it was foolish
enough to grant the tiniest amount of
trust. Sit and watch as its insides are liq
uefied and sucked up by the heartless
starfish. Soon the clam will be no more
and the starfish will slink away. The
clam's empty carcass will drift with the
currents and wash ashore, perhaps to be
incorporated into a child's art project or a
gaudy piece of jewelry, or just ground to
dust by the waves and sand.
Of course, no one is told the parable of
the starfish and the clam. We learn about
the sappy princess and her noble amphib
ian, blinded early in our youths, spoon
fed this criminally negligent fairy tale.
How much pain could have been spared
the young Lady Diana Spencer had she
known that the toad she married
wouldn't bloom into a resplendent
prince? If anything he began princely and
became more toadly with each kiss.
I doubt that we can replace the mali
cious toad and princess tale with the

pragmatic clam and starfish tale. But I
propose we begin rewriting our fable to
spare our children the disillusionment
we've had to suffer.
How about this? After the princess
kisses the toad and he turns into a prince,
the two shack up for a while. Things go
well at first, but eventually the prince
starts inviting his old buddies over from
the swamp. Soon the castle is filled with
toads, frogs, snakes and other crawlies.
Unable to cope anymore, the princess
hurls herself from the castle and drowns
in the moat. The moral: Even if you find
one who's a prince, he's still going to
identify with the toads.
Or maybe we could just short-circuit
the whole thing with a story about a
beautiful, strong princess who spends her
days playing croquet and drinking mar
garitas with her princess friends. One
day a toad hops onto the croquet lawn,
interrupting her game and refusing to
move until she kisses him. The princess,
slightly saucy after several margaritas,
grabs her mallet and promptly beats the
toad into a bloody pulp. The moral —
toads are toads, if they want kisses they
should make themselves princes and stop
asking the princesses to stoop.
