Daily, students miss the point on Stanford Powwow

The caption from Monday's Daily
photos taken at the 25th Annual
Stanford Powwow struck many
Native American people's attention. "A
costumed performer?" "A Celebration of
Culture?" It is not Oct. 31. Regalia are
not costumes. Powwow is not a perfor
mance. Our tribal regalia are spiritual
and meaningful; they are made by hand
— not store-bought. Of course, I don't
expect everyone to understand. But let
me try to explain.
Powwow is the largest multicultural
event held on the Stanford campus, the
largest powwow on the West Coast and it
is one of the largest powwows in the
nation. People come from all over the
United States and Canada. We have the
best drums, vendors, and dancers. We
try to share our cultures with the Stan-

ford and Bay Area Community. Heck,
Powwow is even free! The Stanford
American Indian Community works the
whole year to plan this $95,000 event. In
return, we don't receive our special fee,
and Friday's Daily puts a small blurb
about Powwow on page 12. After pow
wow we get two black and white pictures
on the front page, but the following day
ducks make headlines in color. But why
be bitter? The University does not back
us on the mascot issue; two great Indian
artists, Susan Haijo and Floyd Western
man, receive a little non-Indian support
because we, Stanford "intellectuals,"
would rather hear the trash Robert
Shapiro has to say about the O.J. Simp
son case.
We don't ask for much — just a little
respect. Our cultures are not dead, and

although some would like to believe it —
we are not a dying race. We are alive and
well and will continue to make our pres
ence known no matter how much one
wants to believe Powwow is merely a
revival of what once was. Songs, dances
and regalia are spiritual aspects of our
culture. They keeps us strong; they are
our fuel. They help us maintain our sani
ty at Stanford where multiculturalism is
just a ploy to attract us here.
It is bad enough that we have to take
history classes where professors general
ize native societies. Despite popular
belief, we are many nations — not one
culture. Over one hundred tribes are rep
resented at Stanford University. We try
to share through various ways: Native
American Awareness Week, speakers,
Powwow and house seminars, to name a

few. Our center is always open. We never
turn anyone away from our potlucks.
And yes, if you come on down to our cen
ter, we will even let you watch a movie
on our big-screen TV (which was donated
by our alumni).
