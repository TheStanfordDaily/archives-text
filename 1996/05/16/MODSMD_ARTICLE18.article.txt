# Cohn's conservatism faulted by SLAC writer
## 
### 
Regarding Prof. Emeritus Robert
Greer Cohn's defense of conservatism
in Tuesday's Daily, I offer the follow
ing:
Although your academic and literary
references were far above my Universi
ty of Northern Colorado education and
the daily grind of my position as a tech
nical writer at SLAC, I counter your

assertion from the gang at "This Week
with David Brinkley" that our nation's
politics can be reduced to the words
"liberal" and "conservative."
Many of us choose the more-accu
rate, "progressive" to self-identify.
When added to the mere 17 percent of
Americans who identify themselves as
"liberal," I'm sure conservatism will
get a run for all its money in '96.
Further, I find it laughable and
appalling that conservatives continu
ously quote "our founding fathers" and
refer to our Constitution and Declara-

tion of Independence while blatantly
destroying Thomas Jefferson's most
important tenet, the separation of
church and state.
In your conservative pursuit of
"high culture", know that it has not
escaped progressive notice that the
GOP has allowed conservatism to be
overtaken by religious bigots who seek
to create a nation ruled by a morally
vacant social twisting they dare call
Christianity. Within that despicable
goal, is the core of their radical Domin
ion and Armageddon theory which

strips consideration of the natural
world, social diversity, higher educa
tion and art.
Where will your "civilized posture of
decorum . . . cultural vision, including
the sacred, intuition, imagination [and]
art" be then?
If you think I exaggerate, I chal
lenge you to stand with me as a witness
on the floor of the GOP convention in
San Diego this August. Bring your win
ter coat; it will be chilling.
