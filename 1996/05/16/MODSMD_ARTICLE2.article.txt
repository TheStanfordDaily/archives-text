Casper's plan to pour resources into
the first two years of undergraduate
education will help remedy some
problems, but it is only part of the
battle, students say.
Last week Casper announced
plans to invest $15 million toward
20 new faculty billets for the pur
pose of creating a new seminar pro
gram for all freshmen.
Students who have served on
University committees say that
while Casper's plan might help es
tablish mentoring relationships be
tween students and faculty earlier
in undergraduate careers, teaching
is still not valued enough as a quali
ty of a professor by their peers in
academia.
"Mentoring just doesn't have
much weight in how professors are
regarded in the community," said
senior Chloe Sladden, a member of
the Faculty Senate's Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. "We need
to change the attitude of how we
look at faculty and include their
mentoring abilities."
Sladden said changing how fac
ulty are rated among their col
leagues should have more weight.
"The pressure to publish is some
thing you can't run away from.
'Teaching' professors get a lot less
respect," Sladden said.
Coterminal student Elham Motta
hed, a member of the Dean's Advisory
on Curriculum, said "faculty aren't
rewarded enough for teaching."
"Giving departments more bil
lets may help to draw attention to
good teachers," Mottahed said.
Sarah Whitlock, a graduate stu
dent who served on the senate's
Committee on Research, said she
thought it was important to intro
duce more research into the under
graduate program as well.
Mottahed said she thought the
first two years of undergraduate ed
ucation were the most important.

"I think you have a lot more op
portunity to work closely with facul
ty during your junior and senior
year, doing something like honors
work," Mottahed said. "If by then
you haven't developed any close re
lationships with faculty, that blame
should be placed on the shoulders of
the student."
Mottahed said she was im
pressed that the undergraduate cur
riculum is "on the forefront of facul
ty agendas."
"The general lack of attention to
the sophomore year is changing,"
said Mottahed. "The current dia
logues and seminars are helping,
and Casper's new initiatives for the
freshman seminars will really in
crease student exposure to faculty."
Sladden said new initiatives in
advising will also help undergradu
ate education.
