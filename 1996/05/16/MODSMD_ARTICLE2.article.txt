Casper's plan to pour resources into
the first two years of undergraduate
education will help remedy some
problems, but it is only part of the
battle, students say.
Last week Casper announced
plans to invest $15 million toward
20 new faculty billets for the pur
pose of creating a new seminar pro
gram for all freshmen.
Students who have served on
University committees say that
while Casper's plan might help es
tablish mentoring relationships be
tween students and faculty earlier
in undergraduate careers, teaching
is still not valued enough as a quali
ty of a professor by their peers in
academia.
"Mentoring just doesn't have
much weight in how professors are
regarded in the community," said
senior Chloe Sladden, a member of
the Faculty Senate's Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. "We need
to change the attitude of how we
look at faculty and include their
mentoring abilities."
Sladden said changing how fac
ulty are rated among their col
leagues should have more weight.
"The pressure to publish is some
thing you can't run away from.
