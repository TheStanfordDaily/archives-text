# Josh Gohlke: Laughing leads to crying
## Well educated cynic will work for (enough) money 
### 
"I was looking for a job and then 1 found
a job. And Heaven knows I'm miserable
now."
— Morrissey
AS IF IN a conspiratorial effort to
convince me that all is truly for
naught, the only question people
seein to ask me these days is, "So, Mr.
Smarty Pants, what are you doing after
graduation?" Even the federal govern
ment has been playing upon my fears, via
a letter saying, "Hey, Smart Aleck, aren't
you tired of people asking you what
you're doing after graduation? Well, we'll
pay you 40 bucks a week to build dams in
Arizona. Then you'll have an answer!"
It's true. I never thought I was ready
for corporate journalism, and apparently
the feeling is mutual. Sending off copies
after copies of resume-cum-columns,
only to get ambiguous responses such as
"No, thanks, funny guy," has become
quite tedious.
So, in the interest of efficiency and an
environmentally sustainable lifestyle,
this column will be my resume, eliminat
ing the need to submit more than one
document at a time. Thanks for your con
sideration, asshole. Please contact me at

my current number.
OBJECTIVE: Everybody wants to rule
the world.
EDUCATION:
School of Hard Knocks, Los Angeles,
CA. Overcame adversity to graduate first
in my class.
Stanford University, Stanford, CA.
Overcame diversity to graduate with a
Bachelor of Arts degree in Cultures,
Ideas and Values. Minor in Portuguese.
Saw the best minds of my generation and
they weren't that great. Relevant course
work: none. Irrelevant coursework: Cos
mic Horizons, Communication 1.
EXPERIENCE:
Weird Mean Guy, Branner Hall,
Stanford, CA. Alienated more than 10
percent of my freshman class by "not
smiling very much." Interacted on a
daily basis with some of the most awful
people in the world. At the height of
my surroundings-induced insanity,
threatened to kick a guy's ass for

putting my laundry on the floor.
President, Stanford Nihilism Club.
Ensured a total lack of oppressive
structured events such as meetings,
elections, etc. Claimed credit for acts of
terrorism perpetrated by athletes.
Assassinated in a coup one week into
my term, but later resurrected by mem
bers of the a capella group Testimony.
Dee-Jay, KZSU, 90.1 FM. Occupied 3-
6 a.m. Arbitron dream-slot, following
up the dope stylings of DJ Dopestyle.
Kicked off the air for overplaying
"totally mainstream" band Anus the
Menace.
Rogue Reporter, The Stanford Daily.
Made life-long enemies of one copy editor
and one managing editor. Set stage for my
permanent exile from the Daily in-crowd.
Writing Tutor, Roble Hall. Made
freshmen cry with comments such as,
"I think you've chosen a good font," or,
"Maybe you're ready to apply for a col
umn in The Stanford Daily." Ostra
cized by RAs who felt they were more
important than me in the thought-con

trol hierarchy. Lost final shred of hope.
Publisher, English 92. Distributed the
shockingly bad poetry of my classmates
to friends. Laughed with malicious glee.
Tour Guide, Stanford University. Self
lessly saved untold thousands of prospec
tive freshmen by confidentially whisper
ing to them during the elevator ride to
the top of Hoover Tower: "Listen, let me
tell you something. This place'll kill you.
Don't come here. I never said this, all
right? This concludes the tour."
A+ Student, "Mass Communication
Theory." Elevated to genius status by
virtue of comparison with sorority girls
who make up the majority of the Com
munication major.
Columnist, The Stanford Daily. Tricked
Stanford students into "identifying" with
me as a "crazy" but "pretty cool" guy,
before finally revealing that I despise
them all on a very personal level.
OTHER:
"Friend," Mark "Ponch" Gesell. Suf

fered the misplaced anger and arbitrary
abuse of the only person at Stanford with
an attitude worse than mine.
Victim, organic drug pushers. Experi
mented with over-the-counter drug
Power Energy Burst 2000 in an effort to
stay up for several days in a row. Drank
seven glasses of water to counteract
bizarre dehydrating side-effects.
Member, Phi Beta Kappa. As a pledge of
the "smart-guy" fraternity, played
important part in perpetual rivalry with
"dumb-guy" fraternity Sigma Alpha
Epsilon.
God, Universe. Dispelled accusations that
I was suffering from a psychological "God
complex" and was not the One True Deity,
Became the most successful omnipotent
force in history, passed arbitraiy judg
ment and tripled the number of natural
disasters per year. Had a beer with Satan
and resolved millennia-long differences.
