# HEALTH LINE from Cowell
## STD or not STD? 
### J. Alderman 
We don't discuss it, we don't
learn much about it (unless we
took Human Sexuality for a
grade), and we definitely don't
bring it up at the dinner table,
genital soreness, itching, burn
ing or pain during urination, war
ty growths, or a change in vagin
al or penile discharge are not
things anyone wants to talk
about (except that same group
who took Hum Sex). What hap
pens when it is you who can't sit
still in class, wear tight shorts,
or relieve yourself comfortably?
This week's Health Line by
Cowell addresses some of the
issues involved with discomfort
down below.
• First, don't ignore it! Your
genitalia are trying to tell you
something. The body has an
amazing warning system that
screams "Danger! Danger!
Something is not right down
here, pay some attention to
me...." when something is
wrong. The least you can do is
listen and get yourself checked
out. It may not be an STD; it
could be a yeast infection, fric
tion burn, vulvar pain syndrome,
an allergic reaction to soap,
clothing, or a spermicide, or a
urinary tract infection, just to
name a few. You're better off
knowing.
• There is no reason to be
shamed or embarrassed if it is
an STD. STDs are VERY
COMMON! You don't need to
announce your small sore at
house meeting, but sharing the
information with people who
need to know (your partner(s),
your health provider) will help
stop the spread of the infection
and help you go back to your
normal life.
• I can tell my doctor, but my
partner? It is very difficult to
trace the path of an STD. Many
STDs are asymptomatic, so you
or your partner(s) could have
been infected and not know.
Inform all of your partners, even
through an anonymous note.
They deserve to know. Not
treating an STD can lead to infer
tility, a higher risk of HIV, cancer
of the cervix in women, and
many other complications.
• Prevention. Prevention. Pre
vention. We hear it all the time.
Of course, in the heat of the
moment, prevention may be the
last thing on your mind. Use
common sense along with a
condom and spermicide. If
your partner has unusual dis
charge, bumps, sores, itching,
or redness (not all STDs have
these symptoms, and some
don't have any symptoms) be
sure to address this problem
before continuing sexual activity!
Just remember.. DON'T IGNORE
IT, GET MEDICAL ADVICE, AND
TELL YOUR PARTNER(S)! As a
student, annual gynecological
exams and general STD check
ups for men and women are free
(even if you have other
insurance.) Anonymous Peer
HIV testing is available through
appointment at Cowell. For sup
port, The Sexual Health Peer
Resource Center in the base
