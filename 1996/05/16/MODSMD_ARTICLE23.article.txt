## Hall of Fame Room plays host to Stanford history and nostalgia 
### 
The video kiosk tells no lies.
The Play, from Big Game
1982, once again pops up on
the screen in the Sydney and
Theodore Rosenberg Hall of
Fame Room to the horror of Stan
ford fans everywhere.
"And he pitches to Rogers, and
that's going to take care of the
clock so they gotta score here . . .
this is Garner —"
"Aww, he's down right there,
his knee is down," interjects Lloyd
McGovern. "That referee was
right there and didn't make the
call — what a gutless official."

The video continues: "My
goodness, Rogers is still alive . . .
Stanford players on the field —
what's going on here? ... Moen is
going to score!" The final score
reads 25-20 Cal, the most memo
rable moment in Big Game histo
ry. But for McGovern, whosejob it
is to watch and remember Cardi
nal athletics as curator of the Hall
of Fame Room, has plenty of Big
Game memories. You seem to col
lect them when you own every
program from Big Game dating
back to 1892.
"The Play" is by far most
watched highlight in the Hall of
Fame, according to McGovern.
Despite winning 68 national
championships, including 45 over
the past 15 years, Stanford's pop
ular athletic legacy looks to be
stuck in the early '80s.
But as the titles suggest, there
is much more to Stanford sports
history, and McGovern is the man
to lead you through it. Finally
finding a home in the Arrillaga

Family Sports Center two years
ago, the Hall of Fame now projects
the personality reflecting the at
mosphere and attitude of Stan
ford athletics.
Fifty-five national champi
onship trophies stand in the win
dows of the Hall, but none of them
are in football or men's basketball,
which means Stanford isn't a jock
factory to most people. But take
the "country" of Stanford in the
1992 Summer Olympics in
Barcelona, Spain, and you get 38
athletes and 19 medals. Only 12
countries posted better medal to
tals — so why isn't Stanford
thought of as an athletic school?
"The athletes, they give such
total pleasure to everyone," said
volunteer docent Harry Press.
"What a lucky place to be
around."
The Hall of Fame Room seems
to suffer from multiple personali
ty disorder — whether to devote
more space to its current champi
ons in swimming, tennis, gymnas
tics, and water polo, among oth
ers, or to remain loyal to football,
basketball and track, three sports
in which the Stanford legacy has
made lasting impressions. The
Hall speaks of the latter with awe
and reverence, the former with an
informal familiarity. "Yeah, we
picked up another four titles last
year," you can almost hear the
Hall implying.
"It seems like, except for foot
ball, every team goes into each
year thinking they will win the na
tional championship," Press said.
Press is one of 30 or so docents
who work two-hour shifts over
seeing the Hall of Fame and guid
ing visitors through a century of
Stanford sports history.
The Hall grows from the devo
tion of these volunteers, and in re
turn they continue living in the
unique past-present-future tem
poral fugue that sports history
creates.
