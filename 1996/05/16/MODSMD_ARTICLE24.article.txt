# Card returns to 'home away from home'
## Men's tennis heads back to Athens to defend championship 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
The tennis stadium at the Uni
versity of Georgia has become a sort
of home away from home for the
Stanford men's tennis team. That's
because, since 1977, the Cardinal
have spent the middle of May in
Athens, Georgia, 15 times.
NCAA men's tennis first saw true
team competition in 1977, and since
that year, Georgia has hosted the
tournament 17 out of a possible 19
years. The Cardinal have won 11
team titles over that span — the
other eight garnered by UCLA (3),
USC (3), and Georgia (2).
Stanford's dominance in tourney
play is truly remarkable. Facing the
stifTfest competition from across the
nation, the Cardinal has amassed an
incredible 57-6 record in the post
season for a lofty .905 winning per
centage.
"It's phenomenal how well we
have played at Georgia and in the
NCAAs," said head coach Dick
Gould. "We've really had a number
of good runs over the years."
Added senior captain Jeff Salzen
stein about playing in Georgia: "We
love Georgia. They've got a lot of
beautiful girls, great parties and
Stanford always seems to play well
there. The crowds really get into the
matches. Athens is the perfect col
lege town, and I can't think of a bet
ter place to host the champi
onships."
This year, the Cardinal will arrive
in Georgia as the defending national
champs. Last year the squad com
pleted a terrific season with a deci
sive 4-0 victory over Mississippi in
the finals of the NCAAs. With that
win, Stanford solidified an undefeat
ed season — one of only two in mod
ern collegiate tennis history. The
other, also achieved by a Gould
coached squad, came in 1978, when a
guy by the name of John McEnroe
was nailing volleys for the cardinal
and white.
This year, however, Stanford,
seeded second, will not arrive as the
favorite. That distinction belongs to
the UCLA Bruins, who are in the
midst of an undefeated season them
selves. UCLA has cruised to a 24-0
record, which includes three victo
ries over Stanford. The Bruins boast
the top singles player in the country,

sophomore Justin GimelstOb, and
the nation's top doubles team,
Gimelstob and partner Srdjan
Muskatirovic. UCLA is also a very
deep team — three players rank in
the top 30.
"Not coming in as the favorites
gives us a little more to prove," said
senior Ricky Becker. "But Stanford
has a great tournament tradition,
and I think there is a mystique about
us that sometimes gives us an edge.
While the Bruins are unquestion
ably the team to beat this year, make
no mistake about Stanford's mis
sion. "You don't go to the NCAAs
and just be happy to be there. You go
hungry to win," Gould said. "When
you're capable of winning, and we
certainly are, you just better win it."
Winning the NCAAs has been
Stanford's goal all season. They en
tered the year as the clear-cut No. 1
team in the countiy. The defending
national champs lost only Scott
Humphries from an unbeatable
1995 squad, and picked up one of the
top recruits in the country in Ryan
Wolters. Every piece seemed to be in
place for the Cardinal, and almost all
tennis insiders predicted a repeat
title.
Should Stanford fail to bring
home the crown it would be a major
shortcoming for the team. "I'll defi
nitely be disappointed if we don't get
rings this year," Becker said.
"We expect to win every year,"
added Salzenstein. "This year is no
different, and if we put together four
days of good, solid tennis, we will
win."
In spite of the Stanford mystique,
the Cardinal may have been lucky to
land the No. 2 seed in the tourna
ment. Gould's team ended the sea
son with consecutive losses to Pacif
ic 10 Conference rivals, No. 5 USC
and No. 1 UCLA. The losses brought
Stanford's record to 19-4 on the
year. Mississippi, which finished the
year with only two losses to its 20 vic
tories, only narrowly missed getting
the No. 2 spot ahead of Stanford.
In spite of Stanford's disappoint
ing final matches, the Cardinal will
still be expected to reach the finals.
Should they get that far, all indica
tors suggest that they would meet
the mighty Bruins. While Stanford
players insist that they are very fo
cused on their first-round match,
most players admit that they would

love a fourth shot at knocking off the
Bruins.
"It's in the back of our minds, but
we aren't and can't be thinking
about it too much," said senior Jim
Thomas. "We're concentrating on
just playing good tennis right now."
Stanford meets Texas in the first
round. The Longhorns, ranked 16,
qualified by beating No. 13 North
Carolina in the finals of their re
gional. While Stanford shouldn't
have too much trouble advancing,
Texas has the ability to upset any
body. In 1993, the Longhorns sent
the Cardinal back to Palo Alto early,
upending Stanford in the second
round.
If Stanford advances to the sec
ond round, they will play the winner
of No. 10 Duke vs. No. 5 USC. The
Card has not seen Duke this season,
but USC has given them fits twice
this year. The Trojans very nearly
upset Stanford at home in early
April, and then beat them in LA.

later that same month.
"If we run into USC in the second
round, we may not be the favorites,"
Gould said. "They've given us a lot of
trouble this year, and it will be a veiy
tough match for us to win."
Stanford is required by NCAA
rules to keep the same line-up
throughout the tournament, but
Gould is not certain what order he
will go with. At doubles, Thomas and
Paul Goldstein will play one, Salzen
stein and Wolters will play two, and
Becker and Grant Elliott will play
three.
As far as singles play is concerned,
Salzenstein will lead the team in the
first position. At second, third and
fourth singles will be some combina
tion of Wolters, Thomas and Gold
stein. Gould won't reveal exactly
how the two through four spots will
unfold until Friday evening. The
"road warriors," Elliott and Becker
will start at fifth and sixth respec
tively.

and No. 1 UCLA. The losses brought
Stanford's record to 19-4 on the
year. Mississippi, which finished the
year with only two losses to its 20 vic
tories, only narrowly missed getting
the No. 2 spot ahead of Stanford.
In spite of Stanford's disappoint
ing final matches, the Cardinal will
still be expected to reach the finals.
Should they get that far, all indica
tors suggest that they would meet
the mighty Bruins. While Stanford
players insist that they are very fo
cused on their first-round match,
most players admit that they would

love a fourth shot at knocking off the
Bruins.
"It's in the back of our minds, but
we aren't and can't be thinking
about it too much," said senior Jim
Thomas. "We're concentrating on
just playing good tennis right now."
Stanford meets Texas in the first
round. The Longhorns, ranked 16,
qualified by beating No. 13 North
Carolina in the finals of their re
gional. While Stanford shouldn't
have too much trouble advancing,
Texas has the ability to upset any
body. In 1993, the Longhorns sent
the Cardinal back to Palo Alto early,
upending Stanford in the second
round.
If Stanford advances to the sec
ond round, they will play the winner
of No. 10 Duke vs. No. 5 USC. The
Card has not seen Duke this season,
but USC has given them fits twice
this year. The Trojans very nearly
upset Stanford at home in early
April, and then beat them in LA.

later that same month.
"If we run into USC in the second
round, we may not be the favorites,"
Gould said. "They've given us a lot of
trouble this year, and it will be a veiy
tough match for us to win."
Stanford is required by NCAA
rules to keep the same line-up
throughout the tournament, but
Gould is not certain what order he
will go with. At doubles, Thomas and
Paul Goldstein will play one, Salzen
stein and Wolters will play two, and
Becker and Grant Elliott will play
three.
As far as singles play is concerned,
Salzenstein will lead the team in the
first position. At second, third and
fourth singles will be some combina
tion of Wolters, Thomas and Gold
stein. Gould won't reveal exactly
how the two through four spots will
unfold until Friday evening. The
"road warriors," Elliott and Becker
will start at fifth and sixth respec
tively.
