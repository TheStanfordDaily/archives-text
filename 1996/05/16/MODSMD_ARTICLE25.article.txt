# Men's golf aims at regional title and an NCAA championship berth
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
With most of collegiate golf hav
ing pronounced them dead, the
Stanford men's golfers aim to show
everybody that they are still alive
and kicking.
The 17th-ranked Cardinal pre
pares to take a stand on its home turf

starting this morning in the first
round of the NCAA West Regional
Championships. However, for the
first time in three years, Stanford
will not be favored to win.
"A lot of teams have written us off
already," said head coach Wally
Goodwin. "I don't think many peo
ple believe we have much of a shot at
contending for anything this year."

The fundamental disrespect for
the squad's abilities is evidenced by
its lowest ranking in recent years. To
advance to the national champi
onships, it will have to place highly
this week, but many expect Arizona
State, UNLV, and USC to be the pri
mary contenders among the teams
representing Districts 7 and 8. How
ever, the Cardinal is determined to
make a statement.
"The way we've played recently, I
don't think we've been better this
season than we are now, " Goodwin
said. "We've practiced harder than
ever and the guys are repsonding
well. Their confidence is at a higher
level too.
"Barring any unforseen circum
stances, I feel that we'll do very
well."
Indeed, any coach disregarding
the team as a factor could expect a
very unpleasant surprise. Armed
with an wide array of talent, Stan
ford has the arsenal to compete with
anyone.
At the forefront of the Stanford
attack will be Ail-American Tiger
Woods. The sophomore showed once
again in last week's Pacific 10 Con
ference championships why he is
widely acknowledged as the top play
er in the nation, shattering the pre
vious low-round mark set by Corey
Pavin by five strokes and annhilat
ing the rest of the field by 12. A fol
low-up performance comparable to
his record-breaking efforts would be
welcomed warmly.
Freshman Joel Kribel is also in
strumental if the squad is to hope for
success. One of the top newcomers in
the nation, Kribel has overcome
youth and inexperience to quickly
gain recognition as a force.
The leadership of senior captain
Jerry Chang will be a key as well. His
steady play and level-headed poise
have been the biggest stabilizing fac
tor for a team plagued by inconsis
tency.
"Jerry has really stepped up to be
a positive influence on this team,"
Goodwin said. "He has been crucial
in the development of a lot of the
younger guys."
While the trio of Woods, Kribel,
and Chang may continue to draw the
most attention, this season's experi
ence has taught the squad that the
play at the numbers four and five

spots that may prove to be the most
crucial. In what has been a heated
competition all season, senior David
Garcia and junior Conrad Ray have
risen out of a talented pack of players
to fill out the starting squad. The
season has been turbulent for both,
however, Goodwin feels that the pair
will provide a solid contribution. |
"Both guys survived one of the
most brutal qualifiers I've ever had
with one of my teams," he said.
"They both are hitting really well
and I think they'll come ready to
play."
As the host school, Stanford will
hold the home-course advantage,
while the extent to which that will
aid the Cardinal effort is disputable.
"I really don't know how much
this will help us," Goodwin said. "It's
always nice to really know the course
you're playing on, but it's a hard
course and it could hurt us just as
bad as anyone else.
"One area where we could really
get a benefit is in fan support. It'd be
great to have a lot of people out there
cheering for us."
