# Dallimore's decision to stay in school pays off for Cardinal baseball in '96

Lost amid the excitement of the
Stanford baseball team's record
breaking victory over Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo Monday was the fact
that senior Brian Dallimore had
put his name in the Cardinal
record-book with his sixth-inning
at bat in the 11-2 win.
The triumph was Stanford's
16th straight, surpassing the pre
vious school record set in 1990.
Dallimore's name made the record
book when Mustang pitcher Ken
Dolan became the eighteenth op
posing hurler to hit him with a
pitch this season, tying the Stan
ford single-season mark. Being
plunked at the plate is nothing
new for the four-year starter —
the school record Dallimore tied
was his own, set in 1994. In his ca
reer, Dallimore has been hit by 55
pitches, putting him second in
NCAA history in that category.
"I've learned that I have a
knack for doing it," Dallimore said,
of sacrificing his body for a free
base. "I got good at turning in and
making it look like I am getting out
of the way of the pitch."
Of course, the skill Dallimore
displays on the baseball diamond
goes far beyond his record-break
ing talent.
"The record is a dubious
honor," Dallimore said. "I like to
hit, and I go up to the plate swing
ing. But I don't walk much, so I see
it as replacing walks — it's an easy
way to get on base and I enjoy get
ting on base any way I can."
It's one part of his game that his
father, Fred Dallimore, has told
him he may want to rethink.
"My father said, "When you get
older and guys are thowing the ball
90 miles an hour, you don't want
to do that," the younger Dallimore
said.
He may eventually take his fa
ther's advice, as he usually does
when it comes to the game of base
ball. Fred Dallimore was an Ail-
American baseball player at hte
University of Nevada and is the
current head baseball coach at the
University of Nevada-Las Vegas,
the No. 18 team in the most recent
Baseball America rankings. Stan

ford has risen to the No. 7 position.
"I usually call my dad after
every game," Dallimore said. "On
weekends, I'll call after every game
to ask him how he did. He also
wants to know how I'm doing."
Dallimore said he often seeks
his father's advice when he is not
satisfied with his on-field perfor

mance.
"The advice he gives me is sim
plified," Dallimore said. "He tries
to simplify things and get you
back on the basics. I have finally
learned how to listen and put his
advice into action. Sometimes you
