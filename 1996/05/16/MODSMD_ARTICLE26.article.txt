# Dallimore's decision to stay in school pays off for Cardinal baseball in '96
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Lost amid the excitement of the
Stanford baseball team's record
breaking victory over Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo Monday was the fact
that senior Brian Dallimore had
put his name in the Cardinal
record-book with his sixth-inning
at bat in the 11-2 win.
The triumph was Stanford's
16th straight, surpassing the pre
vious school record set in 1990.
Dallimore's name made the record
book when Mustang pitcher Ken
Dolan became the eighteenth op
posing hurler to hit him with a
pitch this season, tying the Stan
ford single-season mark. Being
plunked at the plate is nothing
new for the four-year starter —
the school record Dallimore tied
was his own, set in 1994. In his ca
reer, Dallimore has been hit by 55
pitches, putting him second in
NCAA history in that category.
"I've learned that I have a
knack for doing it," Dallimore said,
of sacrificing his body for a free
base. "I got good at turning in and
making it look like I am getting out
of the way of the pitch."
Of course, the skill Dallimore
displays on the baseball diamond
goes far beyond his record-break
ing talent.
"The record is a dubious
honor," Dallimore said. "I like to
hit, and I go up to the plate swing
ing. But I don't walk much, so I see
it as replacing walks — it's an easy
way to get on base and I enjoy get
ting on base any way I can."
It's one part of his game that his
father, Fred Dallimore, has told
him he may want to rethink.
"My father said, "When you get
older and guys are thowing the ball
90 miles an hour, you don't want
to do that," the younger Dallimore
said.
He may eventually take his fa
ther's advice, as he usually does
when it comes to the game of base
ball. Fred Dallimore was an Ail-
American baseball player at hte
University of Nevada and is the
current head baseball coach at the
University of Nevada-Las Vegas,
the No. 18 team in the most recent
Baseball America rankings. Stan

ford has risen to the No. 7 position.
"I usually call my dad after
every game," Dallimore said. "On
weekends, I'll call after every game
to ask him how he did. He also
wants to know how I'm doing."
Dallimore said he often seeks
his father's advice when he is not
satisfied with his on-field perfor

mance.
"The advice he gives me is sim
plified," Dallimore said. "He tries
to simplify things and get you
back on the basics. I have finally
learned how to listen and put his
advice into action. Sometimes you

es.
As a shortstop in high school,
Dallimore earned honors as
Gatorade Player of the Year in
Nevada and was rated as one of the
top 25 prep stars in the nation by
USA Today prior to his senior sea
son. The final decision on schools
came down to Stanford and Miami,
and Dallimore is happy with the
choice he made.
" I only took three recruiting trips
because of football," said Dallimore,
who played quarterback and defen
sive back at Clark High School in
Las Vegas. "I liked Stanford be
cause it was close to home and be
cause the conference (Pacific-10
Southern Division) was great. I also
looked at what the school can do for
you after baseball and that was the
decisive factor."
The fit on the Farm turned out to
be a good one, as Dallimore immedi
ately filled a need for coach Mark
Marquess on the infield. In 1993,
Dallimore had one of the best fresh

man seasons in school history, hit
ting .344 and earning Honorable
mention All Six-Pac honors.
His career was interrupted in
November 1994 when Dallimore
pled "no contest" to misdemeanor
vandalism charges for defacing the
"Gay Liberation" sculpture with a
group of student-athletes and was
placed on academic suspension for
one quarter.
Since then, Dallimore has re
turned to become one of the most
consistent performers on the team.
"I think there's a real advantage
coming from his background," Mar
quess said. "He's been around the
game his whole life and that has
been a big asset for him from day
one. I think that's why he was able
to come in as a freshman and play
well. He was very well prep;ired in
the fundamentals and knowing how
to play the game.
Dallimore's abilities led to his
being drafted by the Texas Rangers
in the 34th round of the 1992 June
amateur draft and by the Florida
Marlins in the 1995 draft. Dallimore
turned down both offers to play for
the Cardinal.
"I wanted to sign last year, but I
didn't have that great of a year of
fensively," Dallimore said. "I knew

that if I played better this year, I'd
have a chance to get drafted higher
and I knew we would be good this
year with A.J. (Hinch) staying.
The Olympics were also in my
mind, so I had a lot to come back
for."
So far, it looks like Dallimore has
only helped himself by remaining on
the Farm. Stanford will compete in
a NCAA Regional at home at
Sunken Diamond next week in a bid
to go back to Omaha for the College
World Series. And when the season
ends, Dallimore will go to Tennessee
to vie for a spot on the 1996 Olympic
baseball squad.
Marquess is also glad Dallimore
made the decision he did.
"In Brum's case it was a situation
where he wasn't drafted as high —
if he were drafted higher it may have
been a tougher decision." Marquess
said. "In his case it was a little bit
easier because he wasn't going to
hurt himself too much in the (1996)
draft and I think with the type of
year he's had this year I think he's
helped himself.
"He's had a great career here,"
Marquess continued. "He's a great
competitor who really knows the
game. He has really been a leader for
us throughout his whole career."

"I think there's a real advantage
coming from his background," Mar
quess said. "He's been around the
game his whole life and that has
been a big asset for him from day
one. I think that's why he was able
to come in as a freshman and play
well. He was very well prep;ired in
the fundamentals and knowing how
to play the game.
Dallimore's abilities led to his
being drafted by the Texas Rangers
in the 34th round of the 1992 June
amateur draft and by the Florida
Marlins in the 1995 draft. Dallimore
turned down both offers to play for
the Cardinal.
"I wanted to sign last year, but I
didn't have that great of a year of
fensively," Dallimore said. "I knew

that if I played better this year, I'd
have a chance to get drafted higher
and I knew we would be good this
year with A.J. (Hinch) staying.
The Olympics were also in my
mind, so I had a lot to come back
for."
So far, it looks like Dallimore has
only helped himself by remaining on
the Farm. Stanford will compete in
a NCAA Regional at home at
Sunken Diamond next week in a bid
to go back to Omaha for the College
World Series. And when the season
ends, Dallimore will go to Tennessee
to vie for a spot on the 1996 Olympic
baseball squad.
Marquess is also glad Dallimore
made the decision he did.
"In Brum's case it was a situation
where he wasn't drafted as high —
if he were drafted higher it may have
been a tougher decision." Marquess
said. "In his case it was a little bit
easier because he wasn't going to
hurt himself too much in the (1996)
draft and I think with the type of
year he's had this year I think he's
helped himself.
"He's had a great career here,"
Marquess continued. "He's a great
competitor who really knows the
game. He has really been a leader for
us throughout his whole career."
