# For the record
## 
### 
An article in Tuesday's Daily
incorrectly stated that the Green
Lights Program is an East Palo
Alto program for energy efficiency
to prevent pollution. In fact, it is a
voluntary program sponsored by
the U.S. Environmental Protec
tion Agency to encourage the rapid
adoption of energy-efficiency
lighting technology.

The article also incorrectly
stated that the Stanford division
of the Environmental Quality
Program is working on establish
ing special conditions in Palo Alto
for storm water pollution preven
tion, as well as coordinating paint
ing projects to note what is accept
able to dispose into sewer drains.
In fact, the "special conditions"
section includes requirements for
proper management practices for

campus construction sites. They
clarify the current standards es
tablished by the San Francisco
Regional Water Quality Control
Board and local agencies.
In addition, the Stanford divi
sion is coordinating stenciling and
similar projects to promote aware
ness in the community about pol
lution prevention and the direct
connection of storm drains to local
creeks and the San Francisco Bay.
