## ACT presents a tickling 'Matchmaker' 
### Sam Park 
In "The Matchmaker," Jean Stapleton
needs only one word to stop the show:
" Damn!"
ie exclaims the word at the end of Act 3,
and the recently restored Geary Theater
shakes with laughter that is more damaging
than any earthquake. It is perhaps the the
atrical equivalent of a Bartoli reaching a high
note, or a Yamaguchi performing the triple
axle; Stapleton delivers the line with aston
ishing comic aplomb. Her delivery is right on
the money, in a classic play where bank notes
and wedding bells make music together.
Stapleton plays the original Dolly Gal
lagher Levi, before Dolly became a soprano
and started getting embodied by the likes of
Carol Channing and Barbra Streisand.
("Hello Babs, hello Carol") In ACT's gor
geous new production of Thornton Wilder's
classic, Levi is as scheming as ever, using her
well-honed wits to trick into marriage the
miser, I mean merchant, of Yonkers, Horace
Vandergelder (Ken Ruta).
She is not doing this because she is a gold
digger. Oh, no. She just doesn't think that all
of his money should remain idle in the bank.
"Money, I've always felt, money — par
don my expression — is like manure; it's not
worth a thing unless it's spread about en
couraging young things to grow," says Levi
with usual candor.
Her interest is more on the side ol Wells
Fargo than Cupid, which makes her, in her
mind at least, a good match for Vandergelder,
who wants a wife in the interests of his house
hold and not of his heart. He too has more
practical considerations to think of. "Mar
riage is a bribe to make a housekeeper think
she's a householder," he says, with hopes lor

an orderly, well-managed house.
A penny-pinching widower in his sixties,
Vandergelder has led a life cluttered with self
imposed caution signs at every crossroads
and only now feels ready for some adventure.
He hires Levi to find him a wife, and togeth
er they go to New York where he is to meet a
certain Ernestina Simple — a potential
"match" for him. Levi, of course, has other
plans in mind.
Rounding up the players in this game of
love and money are Irene Molloy (Michelle
Morain), a millinery shop-owner who wants
to marry Vandergelder for his money (sur
prise!) and Vandergelder's two clerks, Cor
nelius (Dan Hiatt)and Barnaby (BenCleave
land). Like Vandergelder, these two men have
led cautious lives and want to find some ex
citement in the evening air. They sneak off
from their duties at the store and go into New
York where naturally they run into Van
dergelder, and the farce begins.
"The Matchmaker," along with "The
Cherry Orchard," closes ACT's season in
grand style. Wilder's commentary on mid
dle-class complacency and their habit of self
denial of passion, goes under the umbrella
title of Great American Theatre. ACT's hand
some, imaginative staging of the show
sparkles with comic energy and some strik
ing visual coups.
Set in the course of a single day in 1880s
Yonkers and New York City, "The Match
maker" moves at a brisk pace, getting its
characters in and out of comic situations
while making some intriguing points
about the connections between love and
money. ACT's production gives equal em
phasis to both; milking great laughs from

the comic situations while keeping an eye
open to the poignancy of these characters'
predicament.
Ruta's Vandergelder is someone who is
vain (vanity is always funny) but not a fool.
He is full of precious gems of lines, and Ruta
delivers them in the soft cushion of his
voice. "Ninety-nine percent of the people in
the world are fools and the rest of us are in
great danger of contagion," he says. In this
line as in the rest of the play, Ruta finds some
measure of uncertainty in a man who claims
to be worldly but is blind to his own needs.
It is a delicate balancing act handled with
gusto by all the other actors as well, especial
ly Stapleton. Her Dolly Levi, a widow with
out a penny, is neither a soft-hearted granny
nor a bitter old woman. She faces the world
with a smile and her schemes seem less de
ceptive than necessary. There is not a hint of
bad humor or mean-spiritedness to her per
formance, making her Dolly utterly lovable.
Aside from the beauty of these perfor
mances, the play itself seems a bit dated. Its
message is universal and will last for as long
as there is money and love in the world. But
some of its comic artifice, while enjoyable,
feels overly familiar. For"The Matchmaker"
takes conventional comedy to almost clinical
excesses, down to the multiple marriages at
the end. Every element of farce is accounted
for: swinging double doors, folding screens,
mistaken identities, men hiding under tables
and closets, and yes, pies. Some of it feels
forced (especially the pies, which play no role
in the narrative), as if Wilder intended to get
things right in his one and only foray into the
genre of farce.
It is not clear whether he is satirizing the

formulas of the genre or merely duplicating
them. Wilder claims that the play is a parody
of the stock company plays he used to see as a
hoy, hut there is a thin line between parody
and self-parody. Whatever his intent, much
of the farce feels dated. It helps that the ACT
production stages the play as a classic, setting
everything, from the accents to the curtains,
within the context of a time gone by, making
its age a hit more comfortable.
"The Matchmaker" works best when it fo
cuses on its message which is perfectly em
bodied in the characters. Everyone in the play
wants to join the human race and live in
tensely, and money is a part of that. "My play
is about the aspirations of the young (and not
only of the young) for a fuller, freer partici
pation in life," Wilder wrote in the preface to
the play. Money allows the characters to
enjoy good food at restaurants, to live with
out worries of the financial kind and make
more adventurous choices. Love, perhaps,
will follow.
So at the end of Act 3, when Levi's first at
tempt at finagling a marriage proposal from
Vandergelder fails, her response seems com
pletely appropriate.
Damn, indeed.

takes conventional comedy to almost clinical
excesses, down to the multiple marriages at
the end. Every element of farce is accounted
for: swinging double doors, folding screens,
mistaken identities, men hiding under tables
and closets, and yes, pies. Some of it feels
forced (especially the pies, which play no role
in the narrative), as if Wilder intended to get
things right in his one and only foray into the
genre of farce.
It is not clear whether he is satirizing the

formulas of the genre or merely duplicating
them. Wilder claims that the play is a parody
of the stock company plays he used to see as a
hoy, hut there is a thin line between parody
and self-parody. Whatever his intent, much
of the farce feels dated. It helps that the ACT
production stages the play as a classic, setting
everything, from the accents to the curtains,
within the context of a time gone by, making
its age a hit more comfortable.
"The Matchmaker" works best when it fo
cuses on its message which is perfectly em
bodied in the characters. Everyone in the play
wants to join the human race and live in
tensely, and money is a part of that. "My play
is about the aspirations of the young (and not
only of the young) for a fuller, freer partici
pation in life," Wilder wrote in the preface to
the play. Money allows the characters to
enjoy good food at restaurants, to live with
out worries of the financial kind and make
more adventurous choices. Love, perhaps,
will follow.
So at the end of Act 3, when Levi's first at
tempt at finagling a marriage proposal from
Vandergelder fails, her response seems com
pletely appropriate.
Damn, indeed.
