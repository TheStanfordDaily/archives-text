i the
basics

We are bombarded by angst. Yup. It's
everywhere. When you turn on the
radio and hear Nine Inch Nails «»r Alan is
Morrisette, it's there. It's in CIV readings a la
Freud and Marx. Kven Socrates had groves on
his forehead from worrying about lite. Lucki
ly, the Basics have come along just in time.
Their fourth album, "Haven Road,' has a
stripped-down sound and uncomplicated
melodies providing an excellent medium lor
relaxation and allowing you to find a certain
happy area inside yourself.
Much of the Basics musical style came to
gether while Wade Baynham (vocals, guitar,
keyboards) and Kelly Colbert Baynham (vo
cals, guitars) were students at Stanford, lust
consider how the two met... a Prol ro event in
Dallas, Texas. Colbert Baynham was a Pollie
performing at a rally for potential (lardinal.
While the two were students at Stanford,
they were both involved with music in the
form of a cappella groups and Gaieties. Says
C Colbert Baynham, "Since I did a lot of musical
theater, I considered going to Northwestern or
USC, both schools with more performance
arts in their curriculum. But I had no confi
dence at the time and wanted to keep my op
tions open."
So she came to Stanford and it was here that
the two attended a tree concert by the Indigo
Girls at the Coffee House, which prompted
Baynham and (Colbert Baynham to consider
the musical style that they currently employ.
"There was just something really pure and
cool about two songwriters working together
in a team. They weren't real showy, and for a
band, that's really attractive," says Baynham.
Soon after this concert, Baynham and Col
bert Baynham, along with a drummer and
Drew Rohlio, the sound engineer, started the
Basics. The original intention was to keep the
thought and style of not having an image.
"Glam rock is not quite our style," says Col
bert Baynham with a slight grin.
She continues, "We just wanted to make
music as singers / songwriters, and it just hap
pens to come out as folk, though our music
has strong rock and pop influences and even

some country," Baynham expounds. "But our
country influences are more artists like I mmy
Lou Harris and Lyle Lovett, artists who push
the boundaries of music and are more in the
mainstream." The Basics' intense mellow
tunes do indeed contain country sounds via
acoustic guitar and personal songwriting.
"The singer / songwriter is more of a story
teller ... and brings a lot of who they are to the
art. It's just more intimate," explains Bayn
ham.
Indeed the format of having the singer as
the songwriter comes out in their harmonies.
In "What You Don't Know," when Colbert
Baynham sings, "Who ever said / 'What von
don't know can't hurt you, you get the feel
ing that the lyrics are a part of her past experi
ence.
Baynham lists, as influences, this group of
musicians: Peter I lendelman, Innocence Mis
sion, Tracy Cchapman and Shawn (olvin. They
are all musicians with intense melodies and
careful lyrics.
lor i Gilbert Baynham, musical theater was
where she discovered her dark, yet soothing
voice, and first learned how to communicate
with the audience. Neil Diamond constantly
playing in her childhood home probably
helped matters.
Baynham's start in music began at age
seven when his mother made him take piano
lessons.
"My teacher realized early on that I wanted
to improvise more than 1 wanted to play what
was there. I always cheated with my ear. I just
didn't like to sight-read," says Baynham.
By the time he was 11 or 12 years old, Bayn
ham began writing songs.
"I would try to come up with original ideas.
That was more fun for me than playing other
stuff."
Colbert Baynham continues, "We like to
contextualize lives, relationships, and sort
through families and backgrounds. We want
to find out why people care about what they
care about."
The pair draws from this background when
writing songs. However, there is no theme that

the Basics try to strive for in their songs and
songwriting.
"The music that we love is the music that
moves us, and that is not necessarily the most
classy or pop kind ot hooky music," says Bayn
ham, "It's music that keeps giving to us; that
on the 15th listen, we think, 'Golly, 1 just got
what that song is about.' Now that's the type of
music we try to write."
Many critics have picked up on the Basics'
multilayered quality, and most of the reviews
have been positive. Such musical style led
BAM Magazine to comment that "instead of
overdubbed and overproccssed vocals, clear
harmonies are the order ol the day. Likewise,
quiet catchy guitar riffs and beautiful lyrics
take precedence over eardrum-splitting feed
back."
A Jlonetarily, the Basics have succeeded with
I y I the help of gifts of equipment like Bavn-
I ham's guitar and keyboard, and from
plain nurd work. After the two graduated from
Stanford, Colbert Baynham worked as a free
lance editor for a publishing firm, and Bayn
ham waited tables for live years at Chili's. Says
Colbert Baynham, "Wade would come home
smelling like a big trench fry."
"But mostly, we just get out there and play
to earn money to make a record. We've sunk
everything we made from [the last) record's
sales into the next. Our records have sold
about 12,000 copies. So, the albums pretty
much pay for themselves within two to four
months," says Colbert Baynham.
For all the incredible amount of work and
heart, the Basics have four independent al
bums and a strong, loyal fan base on the West
Coast to show for it. People recognize that the
Basics' music is sincere and about personal
discovery and internal journeys.
So, in this interlude between midterms and
finals, the Basics will play along with the girl &
i on campus at Bechtel International Center
for Miles to Go .. .'s "Night of Acoustic
Sound," a benefit concert to raise funds to ship
medical supplies to Bosnia. Miles to G0... is a
student run organization that recycles unused

medical supplies from local hospitals by send
ing the aid overseas along with student relict
workers.
Baynham feels that "there are a lot of great
causes out there, but this seems to be related to
people and people in the world that I can sort
of understand. Bosnia is a really grim situa
tion. I mean, within a short time of hosting the
Olympics, it has become a place that is ab
solutely torn up by war. But I can see how it
could happen. The Bosnians are having a real
ly horrible time and the world governments
don't want to get involved. They just need as
much help as they can get."
Colbert Baynham adds, "1 really like that
idea that Miles to Go ... is a grassroots orga
nization with people getting together to do
something in a small way. Our art falls into the
sort of community based art that has its power
in grassroots efforts. There is a very tangible
need in Bosnia to get medical supplies into the
hospitals."
The Basics' humanitarian efforts also ex
tend to World Vision, a group that feeds
children from all over the world, especially
in famine-stricken areas. Baynham says,
"We like relief in tangible forms, and you
can't get more material than medical sup
plies and food."
Thus, in their own way, the Basics' arc help
ing to decrease global angst and worries. As for
how you can deplete some of the pressure that
has been consistently building since the start
of spring quarter, an outdoor concert on a
warm summer evening with the girl & i and
the Basics is sure to do the trick.
