## "Pussy, King of the Pirates:" a bed-time story 
### 
By
Seeta Gangadharan
Since her entry and
recognition into the
literary world, kathy
Acker has been laud
ed as a post-punk,
post-modern femi
nist heroine. A grrrl
who creates and
wrecks the world si
multaneously in her
fascinating gyno
centric tales.
1 fancy them bed
time stories for
adults. Not only are

they sonorous when read aloud, Acker's works
teem with dreamy and surreal adventures that
take the reader on a ride to hell.
In her 11th book, "Pussy, King of the Pi
rates," Acker continues her tradition of literary
experimentation with a story that improvises
on Robert Louis Stevenson's classic "Treasure
Island." At first glance, "Pussy" concerns the
perilous journeys of a group of whores in
Alexandria who by twist and turn traipse
through a post-apocalyptic town to Brighton
Town, Kngland, and eventually, board a ship
with the destination of Pirate Island. The jour
ney involves matricide, the burning of the
brothel where the whores are employed and an
ectopic pregnancy with subsequent attempts
at abortion... among other things.
Readers unaccustomed to Acker's ruthless
writing style mii>ht be lost in her narrative

labyrinth. "Fussy, King of the Pirates" sets
the reader to the task ot figuring out what is
going on and why each character seems so
profoundly screwed up. That is, the reader
begins an expedition of his or her own when
entering the world of Fussy, the leader of the
girl-pirates out to find hidden treasures.
In the section entitled "King Pussy's
Story: Pussy, Who Always Lives Inside Her
Own Head ..." it takes some time to un
derstand that Acker switches narration from
the point of view of one of the whores to the
point of view of a cat, coincidentally named
Pussy, and finally, to some unidentified
third person. After discerning who is telling
the story, the reader must contend with
what is being described in the situation:
both Pussy (the whore) and Fussy (the cat)
reveal by way of their own particular man
ner of storytelling that the whore is a klep
tomaniac — a run-down prostitute at
tempting to steal Jean-Paul Gaultier from a
haute-couture boutique. None of this settles
nicely with the reader since the whore's psy
chosis painfully and pathetically reveals it
self inversely. The more solipsistic and de
tached both of the Pussys sound — as if
nothing were wrong — the more messed up
they seem.
From time to time, Acker's play on nar
rative techniques gets a little excessive. She
goes from: "Ange, St. Barbara, Louise
Vanaen de Voringhem and the rest of the
whores learned that if language or words
whose meanings seem definite are dissolved
into a substance of multiple gestures and
cries, a substance which has a more direct, a

more visceral capacity for expression, then
all the weight that the current social, politi
cal and religious hegemonic forms of ex
pression carry will be questioned," to stac
cato statements like: "I.ulu and Ange decid
ed to masturbate so they could find a reason
to live." The juxtaposition of a child-like,
matter-of-fact attitude with expressions
which span intellectual landscape does not
always work well.
In spite of this occasional difficulty, the
reader's task in figuring out what's going on
and why each character is so dysfunctional
makes "l'ussy, King of the Pirates" exciting
to read, it not a delight to be read aloud. To
no one's surprise, Acker characterizes her
work as material intended to be performed.
"Pussy" engages the reader in a manner sim
ilar to the way a musician would engage his
listeners. It is as if she builds on an oral tra
dition using material which is only appro
priate for an adult audience.
Or, it is as if she builds on a jazz tradition,
carefully selecting themes of sex, death, love
and art, and subjecting each to endless per
mutations. Reinventing Antonin Artaud,
spoofing on the "Story of O".. .even reach
ing so far out as to refer to multinational
and extra-national capital, Acker takes her
melody all over the place. From the seem
ingly dissonant detachment of her literary
creation, she plays chords of harmonic ge
nius which evoke a profound beauty even in
the most dank of settings, a whorehouse.
"All the lips," she writes, "all the fists: it's
necessary to have the deepest discipline so
that all these, so that everything, can be

seen. In the brothel, where women are talk
ing, where the women are cooking, lips on
lips, hands on hands: all the world is at
peace."
Or, as critiques are wont to aver, "Pussy,
King of the Pirates," could be likened to riot
grrrl, punk-rock music. The visceral, the vi
olent, the endorphin high — all of these are
inscribed in the excursions of the Pussy pi
rates. From the revelation of one of the
whores to sleep with her father (who has
long been dead) to the whores' burning of
their brothel to acute descriptions of mas
turbation, Acker writes of the lawlessness
within "mapped territory," of the mosh pit
of life which offers a dark, but beautiful re
ality. (She performs frequently with Brit
punk rockers, the Mekons, and does many
readings at bookstores and literary events
around the world.)
To no wonder, Acker is perceived by the
marketable literary world as the mistress of
outrage — an instance of profanity that
causes both critics and proselytes to cringe.
Her prose has musical intimations which
render her treatment of sex, death, love and
art inspirational. Acker reaches into the
nebulous of gender issues and conveys a
feminism which identifies power, sensuality
and puerile fun as its foundations.
In this regard, "Pussy" stands for hero
ism. Gruesome and gnarly as her writing
may be, Ms. Acker writes a novel that draws
on a delight similar to that which many
readers (male) have expressed in a work like
Nabokov's "Lolita." "Pussy, King of the Pi
rates" is daunting, but not offensive.
