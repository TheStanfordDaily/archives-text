The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
'An Angclo for ('laudio, death lor death;
Haste still pays haste, ami leisure answers leisure;
I ike doth iput like, iind Measure still for Measure.'
—Duke Vincentio (V ; . 1.410-4)
Although it might not sound like it from
the quote above, Shakespeare's "Mea
sure for Measure' is generally consid
ered a comedy. Traditionally, this may he he
cause no one dies at the end, and the ending
itself is graced hy a number of marriages. The
way that these marriages come about,
though, and the threats of death that do
occur along the way also makes this one of
Shakespeare's darkest plays.
"Measure for Measure" begins with the
Duke of Vienna (Jordan Gelber) turning
temporary rule of the city over to his deputy,
Angelo (Joaquin Torres). Angelo, who prides
himself upon his strict morality and lofty
principles, appears to be the perfect person
to command while the Duke is away. Ihe
Duke, however, secretly plans to disguise
himself as a friar and mingle with his citizens
to observe their behavior. Angelo immedi
ately takes his opportunity to close all the
seedier parts of the city. He also institutes
several laws in the attempt to dictate the sex
ual morals of the citizens.
The first victim of the city's new edicts is a
young man named Claudio (Dan Pintauro),
who has gotten his betrothed, Julietta (Jenn
Chan), pregnant. Under the new law, ('lau

dio is sentenced to death. His sister, Isabella
(Leah lUalouf), who will soon enter the con
vent, agrees to appeal to Angelo on his behalf.
At first Isabella finds Angelo severe and un
moved - but upon further appeal, he begins
to suspiciously soften. To her horror, Isabella
discovers that she has become the unwanted
target of Angelo's very human desires. Even
tually Angelo gives her two choices: either she
yields her body to him, or her brother dies.
And, you think, this is considered a come
dy?
"It's a comedy hut it takes on some very in
tense issues," says Thomas Freeland, the di
rector of the play. "It's very much about
power and manipulation and the misuse of
power."
Among the questions the play addresses is
the legitimacy of power, how power is used,
to what end, and by whom. For example,
Freeland suggests, "Do they wield their
power from the perspective of the Duke, of
taking into account of people's weaknesses
and trying to make allowances for that... or
like Angelo, bringing in this very strict, ab
solute, rigid sense of adherence to the letter
of the law?"
Angelo reigns as the play's supreme hyp
ocrite, but not without some understanding.
Freeland describes him as being firmly con
vinced that he is "immune to his temptations
and weaknesses" until he meets Isabella. He
is then "tempted precisely by her purity and
this radiant goodness he senses in her.''
"She's truly at heart a good and saintly
person," agrees Leah Elalouf, who portrays
the long-suffering Isabella. Isabella's power

lies within her (Christian faith, which is tested
quite severely. Over the course of her quest to
save her brother, however, Isabella allows the
impulsiveness of her nature to come
through; this quality in her nature makes the
dimensions of her character even more fasci
nating. "She's an interesting mix of reason
and passion," Elalouf adds.
Although the Duke is the fifth largest role
in Shakespeare in terms of lines, many pro
ductions of" Measure for Measure" choose to
concentrate more on the interaction between
Angelo and Isabella. Freeland, a third-year
graduate student in the Drama Department,
played the Duke himself five years ago. Now
as director of his own production, he is inter
ested in bringing this character to the fore
front of the play.
The 1 Hike is also considered one of Shake
speare's most demanding roles, perhaps be
cause of the variety of capacities he serves.
"Basically, he's a plot-device," says Jordan
Gelber, who plays the Duke. "It makes it
more of an acting challenge to take some
thing that is not necessarily character-driven
and make it a character people can recog
nize."
Freeland compares the Duke to a play
wright in that he comments on the action to
the audience: "The Duke is almost a narrator
figure. He really controls the shape of the ac
tion of the play and literally arranges the
plot." Whenever he is on stage, both when
incognito as a friar and as himself, the Duke
bears a commanding presence. His near-om
nipotence is particularly evident in one
scene, when Angclo questions his own abili

ty to conceal what he has done when the
Duke "like a power divine ha[ s] watched over
everything."
The power of religions presence - or the
absence of it - is prevalent in this play. The
title "Measure for Measure" itself refers to a
passage in Matthew 7:1 -2: "Judge not, that ye
shall be judged. For with what judgment ve
judge, ye shall be judged: and with what mea
sure ye mete, it shall be measured to you
again." Some scholars think that this was
Shakespeare's response to the Puritans in
Parliament around 1604. Hut it all this talk ot
divine judgment is a bit too heavy for you,
rest assured that there are reasons for calling
"Measure for Measure" a comedy.
As in most Shakespeare's plays, even in
tragedies, there is a fair share of comedic
characters among the men and women of the
streets. Among those featured in this play are
Mistress Overdone (Abina Anthony-Davis),
the mistress of a brothel, and that brothel's
bartender, the aptly named Pompey Bum
(John Chakan). Even within the gloomy
prison there are a constable named Klbow
(Dan Maidenberg) who is prone to stuttering
and malapropisms — two mannerisms that
are always good for laughs — and a bumbling
drunken inmate (played by emeritus profes
sor Doug Wilde). These comedic elements
truly succeed in lightening the mood.
Jordan Gelber considers the play to be
more of a comedy of manners, if it is to be
considered a comedy at all. "It's in a gray
area," Gelber says, "which makes it more in
teresting, I think, because it gives the audi
ence more to wonder about, what we should

be laughing at, what we shouldn't be laugh
ing at. Any good play is both tragedy and
comedy."
Elements ot both Shakespearean
tragedies and comedies lend them
selves well to the silver screen; with
iroadly painted characters and villains,
visceral action and humor bawdy enough for
the dumb-and-dumber crowd. Straight
adaptations of Shakespeare to the screen have
generally fared well, and many filmmakers
have taken Shakespearean plots or characters
and adapted them for their own purposes.
But enough about Shakespeare's influence on
film. What about film's influence on the per
formance of Shakespeare?
I his production ot "Measure for Mea
sure" initially seems to be a straightfor
ward version of a Shakespearean play,
a closer look at the costumes and sets,
however, and you know you're not in Strat
ford-Upon-Avon anymore. Several of the
characters sport fedoras and smoke enough
cigarettes to create a screen between them
selves and the audience. Many of the other
characters are in military uniform. And in
the background rise crooked buildings with
windows that gape like empty eyes against
the amber of an industrial sky.
"In a lot of ways it's an incredibly complex
set, says Allen Blue, the set designer. I 1 he
little Theater] is a very tough space to work
in. It has its own rules and we managed to
break a few of them." A physical way in which
this is done is by bringing the actors closer to
the audience through an extension of the

stage, which Blue describes as an attempt to
break out of the theatrical frame."
Another way, which ends up having as
much psychological as physical impact, is
through the play's visual manipulation of
mood. This production of "Measure for
Measure" is not only a black comedy, but has
the look of film noir.
"I was not so interested in trying to do the
'traditional' early 1600s production," says
Freeland. "The play is full of images of dark
ness and shadows that come up again and
again in the text, and that immediately sug
gested [film noir]."
The principle of lighting (or lack thereof)
is a chief technical characteristic of this type
of film. Historically, the term film noir
("black film") was coined by French critics in
the mid-1940s in reference to postwar Amer
ican films. Stylistically, film noir drew upon
sources such as pulp detective fiction novels
of the 1920s and '30s to get a feeling of urban
malaise, and included the dark, distorted ele
ments of German Expressionism. "Film noir
is essentially the coming together of an ex
pressionistic style with a sort of bourgeois
urban style," says Blue.
To create the mood, the set and costume
designers looked at photographs and movie
stills of that period; using film noir as a start
ing point while retaining a theatrical per
spective. Among the films that influenced the
production were "The Maltese Falcon
whose impact can be seen in the tasseled fez,
inspired by Peter l.orre, worn by the charac
ter of Pompey Bum — "M," and particularly
"The Third Man." "The Third Man," which
stars Orson Welles, takes place in \ ienna, as

does "Measure for Measure." Inevitably, the
slanted buildings of the backdrop also con
jure up images of Gotham City — which is
not entirely a mistake, says Freeland, 'be
cause 'Batman' did refer back to the noir tra
dition."
Blue's description of the set as a "colli
sion of film noir look" and"the con
crete of a totalitarian state" is not a mis
ither. The result reflects the fact that the
pervasive sense of uneasiness and disillusion
ment in film noir is a direct emergence Irom
the aftermath of World War 11. During the
war, European artists who had been involved
in the German Expressionism movement
fled to America; some became the pre-emi
nent directors of film noir. Not only did
hard-boiled gangster plots ot the 1930s carry
over to the films of the '40s and 50s, but so
did the threat of fascism. And in the 19505,
fear of the Cold War found expression in the
paranoia ol dark corners and shadowy stair
wells on screen.
Thus, the second stylistic theme that runs
throughout this production, that ot a crum
bling Cold War East European society, is par
ticularly appropriate. However comedic and
colorful they may be, the street characters al
ways remind the audience that they are
among the lowest this city has to offer.
"There's this whole idea that civil society is
out of control and that is the great problem
confronting people in power," says Freeland.
"There's something about not just the vi
sual atmosphere of film noir which lends it
self to this play very well," Freeland adds, "but
also the moral atmosphere ot film noir." I he
classic films noir are the melodramas or

crime thrillers that are often linked to sexual
exploits. Similarly, the crime at the heart of
"Measure for Measure" is not Claudio's inad
vertent impregnation of his fiancee, but
rather Angelo's sexual blackmail of Isabella.
The play continually emphasizes that the
lowest the city has to offer are people who
take unjust advantage of their power.
The atmosphere of film noir perhaps
comes across best whenever the Duke,
cloaked in the smoke of a cigarette, watches
the action of the play from the shadows.
"I'm interested in the effect that the cine
ma has had on the way we watch things," says
Freeland. "And so while theater cannot com
pete with cinema — cinema has a way of con
trolling an audience's frame of attention
which the theater cannot do — it's still inter
esting to try and introduce a lew references to
cinema, if only to play with the idea that this
is a different mode ot watching."
This mode of watching is fascinating.

adaptations of Shakespeare to the screen have
generally fared well, and many filmmakers
have taken Shakespearean plots or characters
and adapted them for their own purposes.
But enough about Shakespeare's influence on
film. What about film's influence on the per
formance of Shakespeare?
I his production ot "Measure for Mea
sure" initially seems to be a straightfor
ward version of a Shakespearean play,
a closer look at the costumes and sets,
however, and you know you're not in Strat
ford-Upon-Avon anymore. Several of the
characters sport fedoras and smoke enough
cigarettes to create a screen between them
selves and the audience. Many of the other
characters are in military uniform. And in
the background rise crooked buildings with
windows that gape like empty eyes against
the amber of an industrial sky.
"In a lot of ways it's an incredibly complex
set, says Allen Blue, the set designer. I 1 he
little Theater] is a very tough space to work
in. It has its own rules and we managed to
break a few of them." A physical way in which
this is done is by bringing the actors closer to
the audience through an extension of the

stage, which Blue describes as an attempt to
break out of the theatrical frame."
Another way, which ends up having as
much psychological as physical impact, is
through the play's visual manipulation of
mood. This production of "Measure for
Measure" is not only a black comedy, but has
the look of film noir.
"I was not so interested in trying to do the
'traditional' early 1600s production," says
Freeland. "The play is full of images of dark
ness and shadows that come up again and
again in the text, and that immediately sug
gested [film noir]."
The principle of lighting (or lack thereof)
is a chief technical characteristic of this type
of film. Historically, the term film noir
("black film") was coined by French critics in
the mid-1940s in reference to postwar Amer
ican films. Stylistically, film noir drew upon
sources such as pulp detective fiction novels
of the 1920s and '30s to get a feeling of urban
malaise, and included the dark, distorted ele
ments of German Expressionism. "Film noir
is essentially the coming together of an ex
pressionistic style with a sort of bourgeois
urban style," says Blue.
To create the mood, the set and costume
designers looked at photographs and movie
stills of that period; using film noir as a start
ing point while retaining a theatrical per
spective. Among the films that influenced the
production were "The Maltese Falcon
whose impact can be seen in the tasseled fez,
inspired by Peter l.orre, worn by the charac
ter of Pompey Bum — "M," and particularly
"The Third Man." "The Third Man," which
stars Orson Welles, takes place in \ ienna, as

does "Measure for Measure." Inevitably, the
slanted buildings of the backdrop also con
jure up images of Gotham City — which is
not entirely a mistake, says Freeland, 'be
cause 'Batman' did refer back to the noir tra
dition."
Blue's description of the set as a "colli
sion of film noir look" and"the con
crete of a totalitarian state" is not a mis
ither. The result reflects the fact that the
pervasive sense of uneasiness and disillusion
ment in film noir is a direct emergence Irom
the aftermath of World War 11. During the
war, European artists who had been involved
in the German Expressionism movement
fled to America; some became the pre-emi
nent directors of film noir. Not only did
hard-boiled gangster plots ot the 1930s carry
over to the films of the '40s and 50s, but so
did the threat of fascism. And in the 19505,
fear of the Cold War found expression in the
paranoia ol dark corners and shadowy stair
wells on screen.
Thus, the second stylistic theme that runs
throughout this production, that ot a crum
bling Cold War East European society, is par
ticularly appropriate. However comedic and
colorful they may be, the street characters al
ways remind the audience that they are
among the lowest this city has to offer.
"There's this whole idea that civil society is
out of control and that is the great problem
confronting people in power," says Freeland.
"There's something about not just the vi
sual atmosphere of film noir which lends it
self to this play very well," Freeland adds, "but
also the moral atmosphere ot film noir." I he
classic films noir are the melodramas or

crime thrillers that are often linked to sexual
exploits. Similarly, the crime at the heart of
"Measure for Measure" is not Claudio's inad
vertent impregnation of his fiancee, but
rather Angelo's sexual blackmail of Isabella.
The play continually emphasizes that the
lowest the city has to offer are people who
take unjust advantage of their power.
The atmosphere of film noir perhaps
comes across best whenever the Duke,
cloaked in the smoke of a cigarette, watches
the action of the play from the shadows.

The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
'An Angclo for ('laudio, death lor death;
Haste still pays haste, ami leisure answers leisure;
I ike doth iput like, iind Measure still for Measure.'
—Duke Vincentio (V ; . 1.410-4)
Although it might not sound like it from
the quote above, Shakespeare's "Mea
sure for Measure' is generally consid
ered a comedy. Traditionally, this may he he
cause no one dies at the end, and the ending
itself is graced hy a number of marriages. The
way that these marriages come about,
though, and the threats of death that do
occur along the way also makes this one of
Shakespeare's darkest plays.
"Measure for Measure" begins with the
Duke of Vienna (Jordan Gelber) turning
temporary rule of the city over to his deputy,
Angelo (Joaquin Torres). Angelo, who prides
himself upon his strict morality and lofty
principles, appears to be the perfect person
to command while the Duke is away. Ihe
Duke, however, secretly plans to disguise
himself as a friar and mingle with his citizens
to observe their behavior. Angelo immedi
ately takes his opportunity to close all the
seedier parts of the city. He also institutes
several laws in the attempt to dictate the sex
ual morals of the citizens.
The first victim of the city's new edicts is a
young man named Claudio (Dan Pintauro),
who has gotten his betrothed, Julietta (Jenn
Chan), pregnant. Under the new law, ('lau

dio is sentenced to death. His sister, Isabella
(Leah lUalouf), who will soon enter the con
vent, agrees to appeal to Angelo on his behalf.
At first Isabella finds Angelo severe and un
moved - but upon further appeal, he begins
to suspiciously soften. To her horror, Isabella
discovers that she has become the unwanted
target of Angelo's very human desires. Even
tually Angelo gives her two choices: either she
yields her body to him, or her brother dies.
And, you think, this is considered a come
dy?
"It's a comedy hut it takes on some very in
tense issues," says Thomas Freeland, the di
rector of the play. "It's very much about
power and manipulation and the misuse of
power."
Among the questions the play addresses is
the legitimacy of power, how power is used,
to what end, and by whom. For example,
Freeland suggests, "Do they wield their
power from the perspective of the Duke, of
taking into account of people's weaknesses
and trying to make allowances for that... or
like Angelo, bringing in this very strict, ab
solute, rigid sense of adherence to the letter
of the law?"
Angelo reigns as the play's supreme hyp
ocrite, but not without some understanding.
Freeland describes him as being firmly con
vinced that he is "immune to his temptations
and weaknesses" until he meets Isabella. He
is then "tempted precisely by her purity and
this radiant goodness he senses in her.''
"She's truly at heart a good and saintly
person," agrees Leah Elalouf, who portrays
the long-suffering Isabella. Isabella's power

lies within her (Christian faith, which is tested
quite severely. Over the course of her quest to
save her brother, however, Isabella allows the
impulsiveness of her nature to come
through; this quality in her nature makes the
dimensions of her character even more fasci
nating. "She's an interesting mix of reason
and passion," Elalouf adds.
Although the Duke is the fifth largest role
in Shakespeare in terms of lines, many pro
ductions of" Measure for Measure" choose to
concentrate more on the interaction between
Angelo and Isabella. Freeland, a third-year
graduate student in the Drama Department,
played the Duke himself five years ago. Now
as director of his own production, he is inter
ested in bringing this character to the fore
front of the play.
The 1 Hike is also considered one of Shake
speare's most demanding roles, perhaps be
cause of the variety of capacities he serves.
"Basically, he's a plot-device," says Jordan
Gelber, who plays the Duke. "It makes it
more of an acting challenge to take some
thing that is not necessarily character-driven
and make it a character people can recog
nize."
Freeland compares the Duke to a play
wright in that he comments on the action to
the audience: "The Duke is almost a narrator
figure. He really controls the shape of the ac
tion of the play and literally arranges the
plot." Whenever he is on stage, both when
incognito as a friar and as himself, the Duke
bears a commanding presence. His near-om
nipotence is particularly evident in one
scene, when Angclo questions his own abili

ty to conceal what he has done when the
Duke "like a power divine ha[ s] watched over
everything."
The power of religions presence - or the
absence of it - is prevalent in this play. The
title "Measure for Measure" itself refers to a
passage in Matthew 7:1 -2: "Judge not, that ye
shall be judged. For with what judgment ve
judge, ye shall be judged: and with what mea
sure ye mete, it shall be measured to you
again." Some scholars think that this was
Shakespeare's response to the Puritans in
Parliament around 1604. Hut it all this talk ot
divine judgment is a bit too heavy for you,
rest assured that there are reasons for calling
"Measure for Measure" a comedy.
As in most Shakespeare's plays, even in
tragedies, there is a fair share of comedic
characters among the men and women of the
streets. Among those featured in this play are
Mistress Overdone (Abina Anthony-Davis),
the mistress of a brothel, and that brothel's
bartender, the aptly named Pompey Bum
(John Chakan). Even within the gloomy
prison there are a constable named Klbow
(Dan Maidenberg) who is prone to stuttering
and malapropisms — two mannerisms that
are always good for laughs — and a bumbling
drunken inmate (played by emeritus profes
sor Doug Wilde). These comedic elements
truly succeed in lightening the mood.
Jordan Gelber considers the play to be
more of a comedy of manners, if it is to be
considered a comedy at all. "It's in a gray
area," Gelber says, "which makes it more in
teresting, I think, because it gives the audi
ence more to wonder about, what we should

be laughing at, what we shouldn't be laugh
ing at. Any good play is both tragedy and
comedy."
Elements ot both Shakespearean
tragedies and comedies lend them
selves well to the silver screen; with
iroadly painted characters and villains,
visceral action and humor bawdy enough for
the dumb-and-dumber crowd. Straight
adaptations of Shakespeare to the screen have
generally fared well, and many filmmakers
have taken Shakespearean plots or characters
and adapted them for their own purposes.
But enough about Shakespeare's influence on

cigarettes to create a screen between them
selves and the audience. Many of the other
characters are in military uniform. And in
the background rise crooked buildings with
windows that gape like empty eyes against
the amber of an industrial sky.
"In a lot of ways it's an incredibly complex
set, says Allen Blue, the set designer. I 1 he
little Theater] is a very tough space to work
in. It has its own rules and we managed to
break a few of them." A physical way in which
