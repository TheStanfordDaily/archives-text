On "Ride the
Cliche," Scott Wei
land sings "lust be
cause you're so
cliched /It don't
mean you won't get
paid," a pretty smutty
sentiment, revealing
that Weiland is aware
of his own derivative
hipness. The irony is
that by this point
Stone Temple Pilots
sound nothing like
Pearl Jam. They've es
tablished their own
brand of appealing
and brash gloss-rock.
Now if only they
could get some self
confidence, stop wor
rying about the curs
es and hexes, and re
alize that the most
novel move would be
to stop staring the
competition in the
face.
