# STONE TEMPLE PILOTS

"Tiny Music ... Songs from the Vatican
Gift Shop" seems an album as self-conscious
as its title. The air freshener cans drawn on
the back cover — "Kvil be (lone" and "('urse
Removing Spray — come off as glib mercy
pleas from the critical snobbery and public
antagonism that has hexed the band's four
year, multi-platinum history. Stone Temple
Pilots are of those rare breed of poseurs who
transcend their own lack of originality by
solid resilience. Repeated hit singles have
eventually drowned the cat-calls in cash, and
now, with their third album driving them
ever closer to a kind of backlash credibility,
sell-consciousness should be behind them.

The aerosol cans drag the is
sues up again, a stunt either
brave or pathetic, appeasing
or arrogant, I'm not sure
which.
The music provides little
help. The boring "And So I
Know"and "Adhesive
chase down a strange
loungey groove, both the
brooding signs ot a band
pushing itself out of its ele
ment. "Art School Girl" and
"Trippin' On a Hole in a
Paper Heart" work much
better, each by turns con
ventional and irreverent,
"big Bang Baby" comes out
of nowhere, the consum
mate performance of ele
gant bachelors, foxy poster
boys of trashiness. The song
is pure adrenaline without a
hint of grunge, the stutter
ing, "spin me up, spin me,
spin me out" as vapid as it is
thrilling.
