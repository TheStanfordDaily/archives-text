# BAD RELIGION
## The 						Gray Race 
### 
One of punk rock's great ironies is that it
can actually be quite boring.
While punk may have originated with a
desire to enliven rock-and-roll with energy
and rage, all too often punk's idealism has re
sulted in a very stereotypical sound: loud,
fu// guitar, fast, crashing drums and angry
young-man lyrics. For a musical form which
emphasizes the importance of individual ex
pression, having a stereotypical sound could
lie seen as virtual hypocrisy.
At its best, however, punk does have the
capability to simplify rock's power (The Ra
mones), to liberate the boundaries between
genres (The Clash) and to literally frighten its
audience (The Sex Pistols). Nevertheless, un

countable numbers of clueless punk bands
have stood on the shoulders of giants, ac
complishing virtually nothing.
Bad Religion is not a clueless punk band,
having spent years proving themselves on the
independent label Kpitaph, but on their
newest album, "The Ciray Race," one has a
difficult time believing that.
The songs are fast, energetic and often
melodic, but there is nothing on this album
which hasn't already been done better. That
fact doesn't necessarily discredit the album,
but it does question the band's intentions.
Hverything sounds obligatory, as if the group
quite simply cannot break out of a punk rut.
Indeed, on this album, the only thing
which distinguishes Bad Religion from their
competitors is their use of pop-flavored vo
cals, which has generally been a stamp of the
most commercially successful "punk" groups.
Songs such as "Parallel," "Punk Rock Songs"
and " Ten I n 2010" are saved from the medioc
rity of their music by catchy vocal melodies,
giving these songs a much-needed hook.
Finally, exactly why "The Ciray Race"
should be considered a punk album is also
highly debatable. Ric Ocasek, the brains be
hind the new-wave band the Cars, produced
the album, suggesting that Bad Religion is
trying to reach a much wider audience.
However, instead of entering into the idi
otic debate as to whether Bad Religion has
"sold out" their punk roots, perhaps the real
question to be asked is whether the results are
worth anything. Mixing punk and pop is
often dangerous ground. While successes can
be stunning, often the best elements of both
genres are bastardized in the process.
On "The Cray Race," the intensity of punk
becomes a instrumental style and the simple
appeal of pop becomes a melodic gimmick.
At least the songs are still short.
