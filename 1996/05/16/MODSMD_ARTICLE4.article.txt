# Quarters, anyone?
## Stern, Wilbur scheduled to get ID-operated laundry machines by end of the quarter 
### Dana Hangai Contributing writer 
The days of searching desperately for
someone with change for a dollar at 2 a.m.
will soon be a thing of the past for some stu
dents. By the end of the quarter, residents
of Stern and Wilbur will be able to use their
ID cards to pay for their laundry.
As part of an expansion of the Stanford
Card Plan, Housing and Dining Services Di
rector Keith Guy said he hopes to have wash
ing machines in the two dormitories accessi
ble to students who are currently part of the
card program. Students will be able to slide
their card through a slot which will electron
ically remove the desired amount from their
account.
The program, which started this fall, al
lows students to deposit money into an ac
count which can be used at all Tresidder
Union facilities. Tresidder Express began ac
cepting the card on Thursday.
"Both [Wilbur and Stern] are in the
process of being connected to the University
network so students who have debit accounts
on the ID cards can use them to pay for their
laundry," Guy said. "We're currently in the
process of completing the wiring in those two
buildings and should be finished before the
end of this quarter."
While the washing machines will be ready
for cards, due to electronic problems students
will still have to use quarters to pay for drying
until next year. Students who are not part of

the program can continue to pay in coins to
use the laundry machines.
According to Guy, the two residences were
chosen because of their different set-ups.
"Wilbur is one large laundry room so it
gets real economy of scale," Guy said. "Stern,
on the other hand, has separate laundry
rooms, so we wanted to understand the cost
issue related to the larger single room versus
smaller rooms in some close proximity to
each other."
Guy said he hopes to have the laundry ser
vices at the larger student resideiieeb card-ac
cessible by fall quarter. However, Housing
and Dining Services still has to determine
whether it will be cost-effective to change the
washing machines in the Row houses, Guy
said.
Vending machines will also be accessible
to students with cards next year, according to
Jon Erickson, the Controller's Office bursar.
Erickson said he believes the ID cards pro
vide a convenience while improving student
safety.
" One of the advantages of the card is that
hopefully there will be less cash on campus,
which is a safety issue," Erickson said. "If
you had your card stolen, all you would
have to do would be to report it as stolen.
Within 15 seconds that card will be deacti
vated."
Currently 1,400 students are part of the
program. Students and faculty who wish to
use their card must first deposit a
minimum of $25 in order to open
an account. Erickson said he be
lieves that as the card becomes
more useful around campus, more
students will want to become part

of the program.
"The other neat thing about
the card plan is that Stanford
Card Plan dollars don't expire
ever," Erickson said. "Instead of
having to rush at the end of the
quarter to buy a case of Snapple
with your points, you can use it
whenever you want. After you
graduate, you can apply to have
the money refunded on whole."
