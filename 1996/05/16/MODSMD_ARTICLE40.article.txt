# SYD STRAW
## War and Peace 
### 
"A sadist is someone who's kind to a
masochist," Syd Straw wearily drawls on her

second album, "War and Peace," clearly align
ing herself with the latter. Anil why not? Alter
being ditched by Virgin Records following the
critical success of her 1989 debut, "Surprise,"
and dealing with the break-up ol her mar
riage, the 37-year-old Straw has every right to
glean a little twisted pleasure Irom her pain.
It's just our good luck that this pleasure man
ifests itself in the form of the 14 songs that
make up "War and Peace" — songs about, as
Straw puts it, "Love, and the lack of it.
While the subject matter may not be en
tirely original, Straw differs from the glut ol
studio-concocted divas who scream scripted
lines about things like jealousy and oral sex
because she exudes sincerity. Throughout the
album, Straw disarms grand statements ("1
was married for awhile / it ended in tragedy,
she tells an ex-lover in "CBGB's") with a non
chalant delivery that aches with first-hand ex
perience of abandonment.
Straw is obsessed with these abandonment
issues. "Knowing the shape I'm in / how
could you leave me?" she sings over a toy-like
acoustic guitar in "Madrid." In "Water,
Please," Straw coolly states "You're not the
first one to leave me thirsting." And in"X-
Ray," Straw cuts to the chase — the listener is
immediately thrust into the middle of the
song's eerie groove, where she states deadpan
that "It's a drag to want someone so much."
Every single bit of it works. Hacked by the
Skeletons, a straight-up rock band with a
slight country twinge, Straw, who sounds a
little like a schizophrenic Carly Simon, has
created a real gem, an album without a single
dud track. In the rollicking "Million Miles,"
the only song I've ever heard about a waitress
that wasn't painfully trite, Straw says"I need
a drink, a cigarette, a place to think / about
you." "War and Peace" clearly occupies this
space, serving as a subtle soundtrack for the
hollow itch inside our chests, the want that
aches in all of us.
