powerful hallucinations if licked. This.should
give you some idea of what to expect from
Bardo Pond's second full-length record,
"Amanita." The group shrouds crafty, blues
ish songs with layers of guitar textures and
experimentation, making for a trance-induc
ing listen which is a tad eerie but for the most
part incredible.
The prominent, fuzzed-out guitar noise
from John and Michael Gibbons has earned
Bardo Pond plenty of Dead C comparisons,
but "Amanita" is a much more structured at
tain Vocalist / flutist Isobel Sollenberger
sings drawn-out and beautiful melodies,
while the rhythm section of Glint Takeda and
loe (Culver propels things along nicely.
At first listen, it's likely that the only lyrics
you'll pick up are about words getting in the
way and something about how Sollenberger
wishes she were a fish. But Bardo Pond's
music goes way beyond the words, and Sol
lenberger's largely incomprehensible vocals
are an essential part of the ever-mutating
mix.
"Limerick" opens up the album with a
hypnotic, expansive blast, but things clear up
with the slightly more straightforward "Sen
tence" and "Tantric Porno." The former sim
mers with a scries of explosive, fuzz-caked
mumbles; the latter slows down and spreads
out with oddly-metered drums and other
worldly sound effects. Later in the record,
"Yellow Turban" plays with a cool, underwa
ter-sounding groove, while "The High Fre
quency" provides the perfectly entrancing

instrumental centerpiece.
Still, this record's charm isn't in its indi
vidual tracks, but in its ability to achieve a re
markable spectrum of moods from its
strange, lazy drone. Rather than working
with obvious changes in volume or tempo,
Bardo Pond explore the dynamics of the hazy
middle, uncovering all the intricate and sub
tly fascinating hooks the place has to offer.
