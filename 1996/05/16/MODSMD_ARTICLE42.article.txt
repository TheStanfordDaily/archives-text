## JARS OF CLAY 
### 
This album was not what I had expected.
After hearing the song "Flood" on the radio a
couple of times, I really liked it, and hoped
that the Jars ofGlay's self-titled album might
be similar to the acoustic efforts of Alice In
Ghains. However, this is a completely differ
ent genre of music, and it's kind of odd that it
found its way on to mainstream radio. One
way to describe it would be religious
acoustic-feel-good music.
Religion plays an important part in this
album. Many of Dan Haseltine's vocals have
religious undertones. The backing vocals are
reminiscent of something you would hear in
an old religious folk song. Even the sound of
the album comes across as something suit
able to play in church.
But despite the shock of getting this when
1 was expecting something a la Alice in
Chains, the album is not altogether disap

pointing. The song "Flood" is just amazing.
The other songs on the album are nowhere
near as commercial, and are much more fo
cused towards a specific audience. Despite
the presence of an occasional drum machine
or sample in the background, the sound is
very traditional. Strummed acoustic guitars,
three- and four-part harmonies, and a vari
ety of other stringed instruments like violins
make up most of the songs. The album has a
couple of slow songs, but most of the album
is done in a mellow but feel-good manner.
While the type of music on this album is
unexpected, it could provide mainstream
music fans the opportunity to listen to some
thing new. The album is not geared towards
everyone, but it is well done in its regards to
its intended audience. It's sort of like the
Grateful Dead for Christians.
