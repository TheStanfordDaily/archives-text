# KISSIN PLAYS
## Schumann and Liszt 
### 
Listening to this recording, one is sad
dened to see a child prodigy gone astray in the
process of maturing into .in adult musician.
Not that kissin turns out interior playing or
anything of the sort. Mind you, at the age of
24 his playing would he bitterly envied even
by seasoned pianists twice his age. However,
beyond his dazzling virtuosity and sheer flu
ency, there is something missing that would
otherwise put .1 finishing touch to his already
amazing pianism.
The Schumann "Fantasy" is delivered
with flowing ease, so flowing one is tempted
to forget the pathos and agony hidden behind
the notes. Granted, Kissin deserves credit for
his exceptionally clear voicing and pedaling
as well as his uncanny ability to sustain
melodic lines over a mess of notes. His out

burst of energy is remarkable in the fearsome
coda of the second movement, where few pi
anists can hope to come out unscathed amid
the wide leaps in contrary motion. However,
on the whole, one senses a distilled passion,
an ultra-clean execution carried out down to
the last detail after much calibration. Every
dynamic is perfectly weighted and every nu
ance is exquisitely shaded. Yet there is little
spontaneous surge of passion and heart-felt
romanticism. In the last movement, Kissin
fails to project a dream-like sonority and opts
for a steely sound instead. In short, Kissin's
account of the Fantasy is impressive, but not
magical.
Kissin finally spills out his guts in the l.is/t
"Transcendental Etudes," showing his stag
gering technique without reserve. His "Feux
Follets" is probably the fastest ever recorded,
clocked at 3 minutes and 14 seconds. The
tricky double notes and scale passages be
come child's play under his fingers. One
seems to see flickering flames and hear ghast
ly snarls under his fluttering fast notes and
razor-sharp articulations. Indeed, I had the
fortune to hear Kissin live in San Francisco in
1994 playing this piece, and it was simply
mind-blowing.
The "Wilde Jagtl" is even more explosive
with its white-hot bravura. At times Kissin
appears to be possessed by animalistic aban
don, dishing out thundering octaves and
massive choral runs at top speed. Even
though he manages to maintain a beautiful
tone in the second theme, the overall touch
tends to be unpleasantly metallic.
For those curious to probe the human
limit of finer dexterity, this is a must hear to
believe. But for a spiritually rewarding ren
dition of the Schumann "Fantasy" or a
more sublime "Etudes," one has to turn
back to Sviatoslav Kichter's old recordings
on EMI and Praga. Kissin still has a long
way to go.
