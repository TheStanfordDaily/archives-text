## Twister 
### 
"Twister" is the latest sappy, soulless special-effects
spectacle to convince .1 I lollywood studio of the merits of
tossing $100 million in the general direction of writer
Michael Crichton. Judging from the opening weekend's
colossal box-office returns, they're getting their money's
worth. I wish I could say the same thing.
The movie is set in the plains of Oklahoma and focus
es on a hard scrabble group of "storm chasers' who have
devoted their life to following tornados, fiddling with
gadgetry and bantering in a metereological parlance that
is totally incomprehensible to the audience. Their fearless
leader is Jo (Helen Hunt), a young scientist about to test
her new contraption to measure the inner workings of
tornados, in the noble hope of devising .1 system to warn
folks when twisters are planning on dropping by.
Bill Paxton plays Bill, lo's ex-husband and the real ge
nius of the group who has returned with a new truck, a
new fiancee and divorce papers. But after seeing Jo and
her machine again, lie's sucked, as it were, back into the
nutty pursuit of those rampaging whirlwinds. We spend
the rest of the movie waiting for (o and Bill to get their
ridiculous tchotchke off the ground and into a twister —
any twister — and to kiss, make up and enter weather
watching bliss.
Since top billing for " Twister'' really goes to Industrial
Light & Magic, a U w remarks about the actual actors will
suffice. While Paxton spends most of the movie yelling
"Come on!" or "Let's go!" and gritting his teeth while
everything around him gets blown apart, Hunt is smart,
spunky and beguiling as the heroine. The problem is that
Crichton and director Jan De Bont ("Speed") have con
cocted a script so pallid that by the middle of the movie
you care less about whether Hunt will withstand the
twisters and win back Bill than you are about whether her
marriage with Paul Reiser will survive on "Mad About
You."
Its just hard to get all that worked up about Jo and Bill's
battle since it's not clear who they are fighting. The
twisters are fearsome and destructive, and they also can't
be "stopped" in the traditional I lollywood sense. They're
the worst kind of movie enemy— inanimate and heaven
sent. As a result, the climax of the film shows the merry
band fairly falling over themselves as reams of tornado
data light up their Powerßooks. A pretty decent payoff, I
suppose, if you're into that sort of thing.
As for the movie's visual effects, well, they are pretty
impressive, all howling wind and hail, flying cows and
leaping explosions. But after about the first twister, you
get the basic idea and the film's plot is so utterly devoid of
suspense that all that shit flying around and collapsing on
itself isn't frightening or even perversely thrilling. It's a
mess.
