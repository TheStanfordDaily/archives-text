# Original Gangstas
## 
### 
Someone should tell the director, Fred
Williamson, that "Boy/. N The Hood" has al
ready been made.
Actually, "Original Gangstas" is not like
"Boyz." It's more like gumbo.
It seems as if Williamson took every ele
ment of the '90s gangsta film (i.e., the col
lege-bound athlete who is killed after receiv
ing a scholarship offer), borrowed a few
snatches from Robert Townsend's "Meteor
Man" and threw in every star of the '70s blax
ploitation action flick genre for his latest film
concoction.
Instead of asking what happens to a dream
deferred, "Original Gangstas" asks the ques

tion, "What happens to a city deprived?"
The answer is still the same, though.
Wo are told that the town of Gary, Ind.,
used to he a prominent working and middle
class community. Now it is a ghetto run by
gangstas.
And yes, you guessed it, it is up to the
townspeople to reclaim what is theirs.
Okay, the story is definitely not original
(it is the basis of most westerns), but it fea
tures many positive elements. Prepara
tion, reaction, resistance, belief, commu
nity involvement, collective and individ
ual responsibility, and unity are all
stressed.
Ideologically, this movie has a lot of po
tential. Unfortunately, it's never realized and
it's not enough to offset the movie's obvious
drawbacks.
The plot is implausible and it's further

compounded by uninspired acting.
Fortunately however, "Original
Gangstas" arouses our nostalgic juices with
scenes starring blaxploitation heroes Pam
Grier, Ron O'Neill, Richard Roundtree, Jim
Brown and Fred Williamson taking control
(i.e., fighting, shooting and setting off ex
plosions) like they used to do in the classic
"Foxy Brown," "Shaft" and "Superfly"
films.
Despite the intriguing cast, a number of
dramatic elements go undeveloped. As a re
sult, many dramatic scenes unfold as either
corny segments or, quite sadly, as uninten
tional comedy.
"Original Gangstas" means well, but it ap
pears to have come short of its original goals.
You may as well just buy the soundtrack now
and wait for the movie to come out on video.
