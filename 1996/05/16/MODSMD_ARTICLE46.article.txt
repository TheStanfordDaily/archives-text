## Dead Man 
### 
The first unsettling part of' Dead Man"
is its title — easily confused with the
Oscar-winning "Dead Man Walking" or
the new ABC miniseries "Dead Man's
Walk."
But it's fitting that one should enter
"Dead Man" slightly perplexed, because
by the time one leaves the theater, bewil
derment reigns.
On the surface the movie is a western
the classic kind — shot in black and
white with all the recognizable trade
marks: a saloon, men with pistols and
"wanted" signs. But after a few minutes of
listening to the trippy, chant-like guitar
riffs of the Neil Young soundtrack, I knew
something wasn't right. A half hour into it,
1 was certain that this was no predictable
Clint Eastwood Hick. The best way to de
scribe this movie is an Old Western on
acid — something like "Billy the Kid"
meets "The Doors."
"Dead Man" stars the king of strange
flicks, Johnny Depp, and fits right into the
genre of his previous off-beat credits such
as "Ed Wood" and "Edward Scis
sorhands." As in these past movies, Depp
artfully depicts his peculiar character in
"Dead Man."
Although the acting is strong, both by
both Depp and his co-star Gary farmer,
the most powerful part of' Dead Man" is
the cinematography. The camera becomes
the narrator, speaking softly to the viewer
about the beauty and pain which pervade
our lives.

However, "Dead Man" is actually pro
moted as a comedy, which is a total mis
nomer. There are a few queer, awkwardly
funny moments, but mostly it is very seri
ous and sad. Anyone who thinks this
movie's prominent characteristic is
humor is either dense, demented or is try
ing to sell you something.
The story begins with an accountant
from Cleveland, William Blake, who is on
a train for Machine, a little town "at the
end ol the line. Depp is in his element as
this pathetic, lonely outcast with a letter
offering him a job. He is unaware that the
written word is about as significant as buf
falo dung out in the wild west.
I he movie begins as a convincing tale
ol a pretty boy who gets thrown into the
big, bad, ugly world and becomes tough
ened by it. but it quickly moves beyond
that. Blake is befriended by a wise Native
American nomad named Nobody (Gary
farmer) who "walks him away" from a
bad place, from this point, the already
pared down conversation becomes more
minimalistic and metaphorical, and the
visual imagery takes on its own language
spinning and fading in and out of real
ity.
The movie turns into a poetic vision; at
once a tale of disillusionment and death,
and a journey of spiritual redemption. My
only qualm is that Depp's character, who
the viewer grasps onto in the beginning,
becomes elusive and intangible by the end
of the movie. Perhaps I'm too conditioned
to think that everything must be corpore
al — perhaps "Dead Man" shows that the
truth, by nature, evades us.
