# Boys
## 
### 
A mysterious woman in distress, an all
boys prep school filled with hormonally un

stable boys, cops searching for answers and a
missing sports star — put it together and
what have you got? A good hair movie called
"Boys" and not much else.
Everywhere you look there's a very full
mop of hair on a prep boy's head. And then

of course there's Winona Ryder, the lovely
waif actress who gets to play the mysterious
woman, Patty Vair. Her now-trendy Gen X
"Reality Bites" shag cut returns, but with a
tad more mousse.
Classifying the film's hairstyles provides a

much needed diversion from the uninvolv
ing plot. After Patty falls off a horse, she's res
cued by the family-pressured prep-school
boy, John (Lukas Haas from "Witness").
They go to a fair, kiss a few times and are sud
denly bonded for life.
John is bewitched by Patty's mystery —
which really isn't much of a mystery. She
seems to be in trouble with the law when, re
ally, she isn't; she just managed to survive a
car accident in a vehicle that was stolen by the
fatally wounded driver.
Patty is bewitched by — well, I can't figure
out what she sees in )ohn, unless it's some
kind of weird incestuous longing.
With matching pairs of giant doe eyes
looking up from their shaggy brown locks,
Ryder and Haas look like siblings. At one
point Patty even passes John off as her broth
er to get out of a sticky situation.
Neither Patty nor John give the audience
anything to sympathize with or root for. In a
quickie let's-try-'n'-bond-real-fast-so-it's
okay-to-make-out-later scene, the following
exchange takes place as the two delve into
each other's psyches. John says,"I feel like 1
woke up with the dial on the wrong channel,"
and Patty replies in true mysterious-woman
fashion, "I feel that way everyday." Um, hello?
This might work well on paper ("Boys" was
based on a short story called "20 Minutes" by
lam es Sal t er), bu tvvhen th e word s come frc >m
flesh and blood people, they take on a new
level of meaninglessness.
"Boys" is going to be something Winona
Ryder hopes people can forget quickly.
