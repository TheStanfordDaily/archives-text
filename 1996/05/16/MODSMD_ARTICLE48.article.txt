## Wendy Lee The
						evolution of the teen-exploitation flick 
### 
When I think of classic films about teen
angst, I think of "Rebel Without a
Cause." It had everything close to the
hearts (or hormones) of American teenagers:
gang knife-fights, the ultra-hip coolness of
James Dean, even subverted homosexuality
in Sal Mineo's character. Then in the mid-
I 980s there were the John Hughes teen-pics
about how to have a relationship with your
closest opposite-sex friend. Later there were
the dclicious viciousness of "Heathers" and
the cotton-candy fluff ol "Clueless." 1 ately, it
seems tfiat the present trend for films of this
sort is to tackle the weightier tenets of youth
culture; the ones that politicians and your
parents can really get worked up about.
"Kids," Larry Clark's pseudo-documen
tary about 24 hours in the lives of New York
teens, led the way. Controversy notwith
standing, it was the definitive poster child for
underage sex. You take one look at the leer
ing pimply lace ol the main character and
think: if this is the face of American youth,
America's doomed. It's comforting, though,
to know that America's not the only breeding
ground for youthful angst. Nihilistic, anti-es
tablishment sentiment is wafting from across
the Atlantic, in waves that reek even more
strongly of dissent.
For example, thereV'Hate" ("l a 1 laine'),
which hails from France. "Hate" s issue of
the year is violence. Directed in black-and
white by Mathieu Kassovitz, it has an even

closer feel to a documentary. "1 late" operates
on a similar 24-hour principle: three friends
from the banlieues (best translated for this
film as '"hoods") of Paris — an Arab, a Jew
and an Algerian — combat lcs flics ("cops")
with a stolen gun and an overwhelming sense
of injustice.
The difference between these two takes on
youth culture, other than the fact that one's
in French? Clark's kids flirt with death,
Kassovitz's stare it straight in the face.
If you've got an issue with drugs, look out
this summer for "Trainspotting," an adapta
tion oflrvine Welsh's novel about a group of
Edinburgh junkies who share the same lan
guid passion for heroin, if not the same nee
dles. Although these lads are in their 20s,
their love for smack seems to have been bred
in the cradle. This film follows the exploits of
an engaging loser named Mark Kenton, who
also goes by the charming moniker of "Rent
Boy." Fven if you aren't nursing your own ad
diction, you'll be able to identify with the
ethos of'"trainspotting — the term (which
means what it sounds like) is the ultimate
slacker's activity. And as it's directed by
Danny Boyle, who brought you last year's
psycho-roommate Scottish nightmare "Shal
low Crave," it promises to be surreal.
Sex, violence and drugs. Three ways to get
high — three equally exciting ways to die. I'd
like to argue that there's a fourth, that's iust as
pertinent and just as fatal: shopping. That's

right, mall couture. And the perfect example
for that is none other than "Shopping," a film
that came out in 1994 in the UK. But if you
think "Shopping" is a Eurotrash version of
"Mallrats," think again.
The main character of "Shopping,' Billy
(played by Jude Law), is not your usual shop
per. Billy's t he kind of conspicuous consumer
who steals cars, drives them into store win
dows and grabs what he can before the cops
show up — an activity more commonly
known as ram-raiding. Along with his scrap
py neo-Coth girlfriend, |o (Sadie Frost of
"Bram Stoker's Dracula"), Billy spends a lot
of time getting chased by the cops. As he sets
fire to a red-hot Porsche, you realize that it
isn't the having that's important to him, but
the getting. This isn't just an occupation for
him, but an elaborate method of giving the
finger to the system. Billy also encounters this
kind of shopper's dilemma: if you don't like
what you've acquired, you can't get a refund.
Paul Anderson, the director of "Shop
ping," draws us a map of youth culture that's
as bleak as they come: an industrial wasteland
ofcement skylines, bonfires of trash and puff
ing power plants. Billy and Jo are part of a
subculture complete with pulsing techno
soundtrack and black-leather-clad denizens
who look like the living dead. Ironically, Billy
calls the mall-shoppers the real living dead,
for their lives revolve around the material
possessions they accumulate. In one scene,

the camera shot spirals down from the marble
ceiling of a mega-mall, accompanied by the
strains of Mozart VTineKleine Nachtmusik."
Juxtapose this with the graffiti-streaked walls
of the dingy squats most of the characters live
in, and you get an idea of the line drawn be
tween the haves and the have-nots.
Everything else that young adults normal
ly have at their disposal to express their angst,
like in "Kids," "Hate" and "Trainspotting,"
are denied these misfits. At one point, Billy
savs the unstated take-home message of
"Kids": "Come on, Jo — it's the 90s. Sex isn t
safe anymore." When little urban hoodlums
run into the law, they pelt the police with
rocks. Billy is an adrenaline-junkie who
prefers to get high from driving a car at 100
mph into a glass wall than by any other
means.
These kids are real rebels without a cause.
Still, the issue at the heart of "Shopping" is
distinctly that of our generation and our cul
ture. Thanks to the likes of "Clueless,' we're
known as the home of fashion-obsessed
teen-queens. But the truth is that in America
you simply can't go into the supermarket and
buy what you need with your good looks. Al
though "Shopping" 's been in the lineup of a
few American film festivals, it may never
make it to your local (arthouse or otherwise)
theater. 1 guess moviegoers in this country
just can't handle the truth. That mall fetish
can really kill you.
