# UCSF-Stanford merger mulled
## Regents put brakes on proposal 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCO - The pro
posed merger between Stanford's
Medical Center and UC-San Fran
cisco encountered serious ques
tions yesterday as the UC Board of
Regents expressed concerns and
UCSF's unions voiced their oppo
sition.
At a meeting in San Francisco
in which UCSF officials presented
their reasons for the merger, a re
gents' committee called for more
time to consider the merger.
Union officials, meanwhile, said
the merger would have severe neg
ative effects on workers and the
public. The matter was not sched
uled for a vote or any other action.
The proposed merger, which
was first discussed earlier this
year, would create a non-profit
corporation which would combine
Stanford and UCSF's clinical op
erations but maintain separate
medical schools.

At yesterday's session, UCSF
Chancellor Joseph Martin said up
coming cuts in federal funding
would be particularly harmful to
academic hospitals. This, he said,
meant that "the UCSF clinical en
terprise must partner with oth
ers."
Martin said a Stanford-UCSF
merger would strengthen both op
erations by consolidating admin
istrative functions and providing
"a critical mass of faculty and pa
tients" for many small programs.
Dean Haile Debas of the UCSF
School of Medicine added that al
though the medical center is cur
rently running an operating sur
plus, "the [financial] trajectory in
dicates a bleak future." The merg
er, he said, would "diminish the
possibility of severe downsizing."
After presenting their case,
Martin and Debas faced questions
from about a dozen regents. All of
the questioners said they recog
nized the need for action and most
said they agreed in principle with
the Stanford-UCSF merger.
Most of them, however, also
said the merger was progressing
too quickly and that too many
questions remained unanswered.
UCSF officials had said they
hoped for action next month.
"I am in favor of the project,"
Regent Roy Brophy said. "I will
support it. I will not support it at
this particular time."
He added that there were
"things [the regents] don't know
that we have a legal responsibility
to know."
However, he said that if the
merger were given proper time for
consideration, it would probably
proceed.
William Gurtner, UC's vice
president for clinical services de
velopment, acknowledged that the
regents had valid questions but
said that "for the vast majority, we
have an answer."
"I don't really believe you all
have all the answers," replied Bro
phy, "and putting it into some
kind of cram session makes me un
comfortable."
Martin said UCSF was "coming
to you with something we've
thought out very carefully. . . . We
need to have an answer, yes or no,
so I can be fair to my colleagues at
Stanford."
"We can't have this on the table
for an indefinite period of time be
cause that creates uncertainty,"
he explained.
Regent Frank Clark also had
reservations about the limited
time the board has had to consid
er the merger. He said there is "a
very serious legal question of
whether or not this authority . . .
can consummate an action of this
type," and said that some form of

court authorization might be
necessary.
James Hoist, the regents' gen
eral counsel, said the regents had
"a very broad grant of authority,"
including "the power to manage
and dispose of property."
Clark also said academic medi
cine is not in as much danger as
often thought and pointed to
UCLA as an example of a medical
center that has adapted to changes
while remaining independent.
Tirso del Junco, the regent
who chaired the meeting, said he
was concerned that the regents
would not be adequately repre
sented on the governing body of
the new entity.
He also said if the board had
had to approve the merger yester
day, he was not sure they would
have done so, although they were
sympathetic to the basic idea.
Every call for delay or caution
was applauded by the many union
representatives in the audience.
At a public comment session be
fore the meeting, numerous union
officials called for delay or cancel
lation of the merger.
"The university medical cen
ters are not businesses to be
bought and sold," said Libby
Sayre of the Union of Professional
and Technical Employees, adding
that the public "had not been
given the most basic rudimentary
information."
At a rally before the meeting,
labor representatives condemned
the merger in much stronger
terms, saying that it would result
in layoffs, which would mean fewer
workers doing the same amount of
work. This would lead to dimin
ished patient care, they claimed.
They also said the merger would
hurt union representation and
force down wages and benefits.
"We could be working for Mc-
Donald's wages," said Spike Kahn
of AFSCME, a union that repre
sents the majority of UCSF's
8,000 employees.
