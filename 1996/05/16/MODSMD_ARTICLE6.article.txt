The new
Writing in the
Major program,
which requires
all undergradu
ates to pass a
writing-inten
sive course with
in their major,
will encourage a

variety of writing possibilities
across disciplines, according to a
report to be presented to the Fac
ulty Senate today.
The report was prepared by the
Writing Advisory Board, which re
viewed the recommendation for
the new writing proposal by the
senate's Committee on Under
graduate Studies.
"The challenge is to integrate
writing in a way that is meaning
ful, in a way that it is a vehicle to
enhance the teaching of the mate
rial that the professor wants to be
teaching," said Claude Reichard,
associate director of Writing and

Critical Thinking and a member
of the advisory board.
"The Writing in the Major pro
gram is a wonderful opportunity
to reinforce more general academ
ic writing skill and to introduce
specific writing skills in a context
that students are interested in,"
Reichard said.
Beginning next fall, writing
intensive courses will be part of all
majors in the three undergradu
ate schools — Earth Sciences, En
gineering and Humanities and
Sciences.
"Writing is something integral
to learning," said David Lougee,
director of the Technical Commu
nication Program in the School of
Engineering.
Lougee said he does not consid
er a writing requirement a burden
in a major like engineering.
"There are different ways you can
test learning — you can give a
midterm or have someone write
up a project proposal," Lougee
said.

"The whole idea about Writing
in the Major is that different ma
jors can decide what about writing
will be emphasized," said Assoc.
Geological and Environmental
Sciences Prof. Jonathan Stebbins.
"In earth sciences, students in lab
based classes write lab reports
modeled on scientific research pa
pers, where there is a thoughtful
working out of communication."
Stebbins said students in earth
sciences will "do everything from
research papers to policy and envi
ronmental work."
The report of the advisory
board also stresses the importance
of providing feedback to students

and emphasizes the process of re
vision.
"The way you write better is to
revise — your writing gets better
and your thinking gets better,"
Reichard said.
Currently, Stebbins said, stu
dents often write a term paper,
turn it in and simply read the com
ments when it is returned. "The
instructor should be spending
time working with the students to
improve quality of writing," Steb
bins said. He said that in the new
writing-intensive courses, stu
dents will receive response to their
writing in seminars from both fac
ulty and teaching assistants
The senate will also consider a
recommendation to revise the cur
rent policy on secrecy in research
and charge a committee with eval
uating the TA system.
