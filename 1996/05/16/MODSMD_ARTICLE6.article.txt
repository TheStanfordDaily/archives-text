The new
Writing in the
Major program,
which requires
all undergradu
ates to pass a
writing-inten
sive course with
in their major,
will encourage a

variety of writing possibilities
across disciplines, according to a
report to be presented to the Fac
ulty Senate today.
The report was prepared by the
Writing Advisory Board, which re
viewed the recommendation for
the new writing proposal by the
senate's Committee on Under
graduate Studies.
"The challenge is to integrate
writing in a way that is meaning
ful, in a way that it is a vehicle to
enhance the teaching of the mate
rial that the professor wants to be
teaching," said Claude Reichard,
associate director of Writing and

Critical Thinking and a member
of the advisory board.
"The Writing in the Major pro
gram is a wonderful opportunity
to reinforce more general academ
ic writing skill and to introduce
specific writing skills in a context
that students are interested in,"
Reichard said.
Beginning next fall, writing
intensive courses will be part of all
majors in the three undergradu
ate schools — Earth Sciences, En
gineering and Humanities and
Sciences.
"Writing is something integral
to learning," said David Lougee,
director of the Technical Commu
nication Program in the School of
Engineering.
Lougee said he does not consid
er a writing requirement a burden
in a major like engineering.
"There are different ways you can
test learning — you can give a
midterm or have someone write
up a project proposal," Lougee
said.
