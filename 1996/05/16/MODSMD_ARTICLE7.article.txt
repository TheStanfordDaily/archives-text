# Students engineer a Dutch treat
## 
### Jennifer Brinsky 
Although many people complain that
technology makes human interaction
more distant and impersonal, recent leaps
in modes of communication have actually
brought together students living on two
different continents into one class.
This quarter, seven Stanford students
are collaborating with eight students from
the Eindhoven Institute of Technology in
the Netherlands. The students and their
professors are teaming up with interna
tional businesses and foreign universities
to work on two projects related to the
planning and design of supply chains.
The innovative class that has made all
this possible is Industrial Engineering
262: "Global Supply Chain Project Coor
dination." Taught and initiated by Hau
Lee, deputy chairman of the Industrial
Engineering Department, this class offers
students from Stanford and international
universities a chance to work together on
a global group project.
"The class is very project-focused,"
said senior Nikhil Raghavan, a member of
the class. "It gives you a taste of real world
problems such as working across cultural
and time barriers, which are major issues
we have to think about."
"The group work is self-motivating,"
Raghavan added. "No one is looking over
your shoulder but you have a responsibil
ity to your group, both the group here [at
Stanford] and the group as a whole."
The projects the students tackle are
sponsored by companies that have inter
ests in both the European and North

American region. The students at Eind
hoven focus on the issues related to Eu
rope and have more intensive interactions
with the European portion of the sponsor
ing company, while the Stanford students
concentrate on the corresponding issues
in the North American region.
One group is involved with the plan
ning and design of supply chains for
Hewlett-Packard Co.'s laser printer divi
sion. Hewlett-Packard, an exporter of
laser printers, has given the students the

project of analyzing the most effective way
of obtaining parts from the best suppliers.
Kausik Rajgopal, a master's student, is
a member of the Hewlett-Packard team.
He said he has found the cooperation be
tween students and industry beneficial to
both and sees Stanford as a place where
projects such as this should be encour
aged.

between companies and stu
dents. ... We are working for real
clients, mid the company expects
output that is up to their stan
dards."
The second group is working
with Yazaki, a major Japanese auto
components supplier and a global
company with five plants in Eu
rope. The students' project is to
map the existing supply chain of
Yazaki in Europe and identify op
portunities for improvements.
One of the most exciting aspects
of the course is the opportunity for
the students to meet face-to-face
with their international counter
parts, participants said. Earlier this
quarter, the Stanford students vis
ited the Netherlands to meet each
other, discuss their projects and
make time schedules. The Eind
hoven team will visit Stanford at
the end of the quarter.

"The trips are a good means to
establish relationships, face-to-face
communications, networking, cul
tural immersion, plant visits and
broadening of perspectives," said
Lee.
The groups use both new and es
tablished forms of communication,
such as telephones, e-mail, the
World Wide Web, fax machines and
video conferencing.
Learning how to communicate
globally has been one of the most
positive aspects of the course for
Rajgopal. Communicating across
time zones, he said, has helped the
students explore which kinds of the
available technologies are best for
that kind of communication.
"We e-mail [the team in Eind
hoven] before we go to bed, and
when we wake up we have messages
from them. We've learned how to
take advantage of the time differ
ence rather than seeing it as a con
straint. ... We have a 24-hour,
rather than 12-hour, work day."
E-mail is only one of the meth
ods of communication the teams

use. The hour each week of video
conferencing, said Ashish Shah,
Lee's research assistant and teach
ing assistant for the class, "is a pret
ty neat and innovative aspect of the
course."
Despite technological innova
tions, communication across cul
ture and language barriers can
sometimes still pose difficulties,
said Raghavan. When the Stanford
students visited Eindhoven over
spring break, the two groups were
introduced and participated in
team-building exercises. The Eind
hoven students speak English, but
they were not participating very
much in the discussions.
"We realized the Americans
were speaking too fast," said
Haghavan. "We had to cope with
our differences and give them more
chances to speak."
The groups work both among
themselves and directly with the
companies. The companies have
been pleased with the work of the
students so far, and interaction
with industries has been interest

ing for the students too, said Shah,
although problems occasionally
arise over issues of companies'
trade secrets.
Diversity is an integral feature of
the class. Besides working with the
Dutch team, the Stanford team in
cludes students whose back
grounds range from Indian to
Ethiopian to American. The Stan
ford participants include graduate
students in industrial engineering,
engineering management and sev
eral other departments, as well as
one computer science undergradu
ate.
When the course debuted in
winter quarter, Stanford students
worked with students from the
Hong Kong University of Science
and Technology and participated in
projects for AT&T, Sterling and
Gymboree. Because of the success
of the course, "Global Supply Chain
Project Coordination" is scheduled
to be held again next year and will
be taught by Consulting Asst. In
dustrial Engineering Prof. Behnam
Tabrizi.
