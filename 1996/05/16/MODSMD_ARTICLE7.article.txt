# Students engineer a Dutch treat
## 
### Jennifer Brinsky 
Although many people complain that
technology makes human interaction
more distant and impersonal, recent leaps
in modes of communication have actually
brought together students living on two
different continents into one class.
This quarter, seven Stanford students
are collaborating with eight students from
the Eindhoven Institute of Technology in
the Netherlands. The students and their
professors are teaming up with interna
tional businesses and foreign universities
to work on two projects related to the
planning and design of supply chains.
The innovative class that has made all
this possible is Industrial Engineering
262: "Global Supply Chain Project Coor
dination." Taught and initiated by Hau
Lee, deputy chairman of the Industrial
Engineering Department, this class offers
students from Stanford and international
universities a chance to work together on
a global group project.
"The class is very project-focused,"
said senior Nikhil Raghavan, a member of
the class. "It gives you a taste of real world
problems such as working across cultural
and time barriers, which are major issues
we have to think about."
"The group work is self-motivating,"
Raghavan added. "No one is looking over
your shoulder but you have a responsibil
ity to your group, both the group here [at
Stanford] and the group as a whole."
The projects the students tackle are
sponsored by companies that have inter
ests in both the European and North

American region. The students at Eind
hoven focus on the issues related to Eu
rope and have more intensive interactions
with the European portion of the sponsor
ing company, while the Stanford students
concentrate on the corresponding issues
in the North American region.
One group is involved with the plan
ning and design of supply chains for
Hewlett-Packard Co.'s laser printer divi
sion. Hewlett-Packard, an exporter of
laser printers, has given the students the

project of analyzing the most effective way
of obtaining parts from the best suppliers.
Kausik Rajgopal, a master's student, is
a member of the Hewlett-Packard team.
He said he has found the cooperation be
tween students and industry beneficial to
both and sees Stanford as a place where
projects such as this should be encour
aged.
"I would like to see more interaction
