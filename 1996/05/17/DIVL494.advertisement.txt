Easy, Romeo. We don't know each other that well.
The question was: Where do you begin your online
adventures? If you had MSN's Custom Start Page,
all the stuff you like best and all the things you
need most would be right there, right in front of
you. Web links and search engines, sports scores
and ski reports â€” even comic strips. You pick what
you want and forget the rest. So visit our site at
www.msn.com. It's easier to get to than first base.
