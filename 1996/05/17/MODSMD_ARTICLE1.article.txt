# 'A dean without parallel and a human being of wonderful dimensions and qualities'
## Engineering dean lauded in ceremony 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
A grove of trees, a plaque on a stone of polished
granite — and a "Great Big Bertha" golf club.
James Gibbons, retiring dean of the School
of Engineering, was honored in a number of
ways yesterday at a ceremony celebrating his
12-year tenure as dean and his 39 years on the
Stanford faculty. He will move on to a position
within the University as Council to the Presi
dent for Industrial Relations.
A grove of trees outside Thornton Center,
where students, faculty and staff in the School of
Engineering often gather, was officially named
for Gibbons.
"Knowing that Jim places a high value in
bringing people together, it seems appropriate
that this grove bear his name," said master of cer
emonies Joe Goodman, chair of the Electrical En
gineering Department.
An inscription on a marker for the grove reads,
"His enormous contributions as teacher, scholar,
entrepreneur and dean have changed forever the
physical and intellectual landscape of Stanford
and the School of Engineering. His visionary lead
ership has set us on a course of unparalleled ex
cellence and ensured the preeminence of our en
deavors for generations to come."
Gibbons, with tears in his eyes, said he was
honored by the ceremony.
"My heart is too full to say too much," he said,
deferring praise to the faculty, staff and students
who work with him.
"This is a first-class group of people, and it's
been an honor and a privilege to work with you,"
he said. "Whatever has happened has happened
because you are who you are."
Goodman noted Gibbons' achievements in
bringing new funding, programs and buildings to
the School of Engineering. During the past few
years, the school has acquired the new William
Gates Computer Science building and the Paul
Allen Center for Integrated Systems. Construc
tion on a Science and Engineering Quad will begin
this summer.
Academically, under Gibbons, the school has
achieved outstanding rankings from the National

Dean of the School of Engineering Jim Gibbons shows his granddaughter his new
"Great Big Bertha" golf club, received yesterday at a ceremony to commemorate his
retirement as dean after 39 years on the Stanford faculty. As a more serious honor, a
grove of trees outside Thornton Center was named after Gibbons.
Research Council, Goodman noted.
Three departments were ranked
first in the nation this year, and all
departments placed in the top
seven.
"That's an extremely noticeable
upward movement for the whole
school during the course of [Gib
bons'] tenure," Goodman said.
Gibbons' wife, Lynn, and their
children and grandchildren attend
ed the afternoon ceremony.
In addition to a marker at the
site, Gibbons was offered a certifi
cate by Mechanical Engineering
Consulting Prof. Chauncey Starr,

chair of the School of Engineering
Advisory Council, which listed the
names of people serving on the
council during Gibbons' tenure.
But the certificate, which de
scribed the signers as "grateful for
the opportunity to participate in
Jim Gibbons' leadership of the
School of Engineering," wouldn't
allow Gibbons to have any fun,
said Starr. He then gave the dean a
golf club to use in his newfound
free time.
Goodman led the crowd in a
toast to Gibbons, calling him "a
dean without parallel and a human
being of wonderful dimensions and
qualities.
"May your post-deanship life be
as rewarding to you as your leader
ship has been to us."
