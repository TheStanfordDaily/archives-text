## Med Center gets revolutionary scanner Hospital fourth of 15 to get equipment for visualizing surgical procedures

The Stanford Medical Center recently ac
quired a revolutionary magnetic resonance
scanner which will enable surgeons to visual
ize surgical procedures as they are performing
them.
The new machine is called MRT, for mag
netic resonance therapy, according to Judy
Illes, director of grants development in tho T? -
diology Department.
MRT has an open configuration of the mag
net known as a "double doughnut." The pa
tient lies between the two halves of the ma
chine in order to be scanned. There is enough
space between the halves that the patient
could undergo surgery or move around while
inside.
"MR technology offers the possibility of
continuously monitoring a procedure and re
ceiving feedback in real time," Radiology De
partment Chair Gary Glazer said in a state
ment.
Conventional MRI (magnetic resonance
imaging) is used for procedures such as scan
ning a patient for tumors or visualizing in
juries, such as broken bones. MRI units are
closed magnets with a hollow tube down the
center that the patient lies in. Physicians have

no access to a patient undergoing convention
al MRI.
"MRT enhances the capabilities that MRI
has previously used," Illes said. "It introduces
new opportunities because of the openness of
the system and capitalizes on the diagnostic
capacity."
The open layout of the MRT allows physi
cians to perform procedures while the ma
chine continuously monitors their actions.
Using instruments with trackers on the ends,
the surgeon can follow the instruments, using
the images as a guide to reach the tumor or tis
sue operated on.
The new magnet is only one-third the field
strength of conventional MRI units. However
it produces a strong enough magnetic field
that pacemakers or metals in the body would
be adversely affected by the field.
The strong magnetic field also means that
normal surgical instruments must be re
designed or remade with alternative materi
als not affected by the magnets. Many surgi
cal tools today have some type of metal in
them and therefore could not be used in the
magnetic field.
"It's not just surgical instruments but all
of the accouterments in the surgical suite,
such as cautery and drills," Assoc. Radiology
Prof. Robert Herfkens said in a statement.

Stanford is only the fourth institution to
receive this MRT system. Eventually up to 15
MRT units will be in service around the world.
The machine was developed by General Elec
tric. Research groups receiving an MRT are
participants in General Electric's "Clinical
Investigator Program"
"Each site will have its own niche," Illes
said. "Here we have an outstanding group of
M R physicists and engineers at the Lucas Cen
ter. I think Stanford will be a leader in neuro
surgery, dynamic imaging and biopsies, espe
cially of the breast."
MRT works on the same principle as the
MRI scanners widely used today, which are
used to look inside people without having to
cut them open.
In modern MRI, hydrogen, principally in
the form of water and fat, is readily imaged.
The molecular environment of protons makes
it easier to discriminate soft tissue than other
methods of imaging, such as ultrasound and
computerized tomagraphy, said Illes.
"This opens up opportunities for multi-dis
ciplinary collaborations between material sci
entists, engineers and physicists and the med
ical sciences for the benefit of health care,"
Illes said.
The scanner will be used for the first time in
June, to perform biopsies on cancer patients.
