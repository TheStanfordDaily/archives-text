## Rajko Kasagic gains support 
### 
BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — In a
dispute that could split Bosnian Serb territory in
two, Western and Serb leaders gave crucial backing
yesterday to the moderate prime minister who is
fighting dismissal by the Serbs' wartime chief,
Radovan Karadzic.
Several Western leaders traveled to the northern
city of Banja Luka yesterday to offer support for Pre
mier Rajko Kasagic, increasing pressure on Karadz
ic, an indicted war crimes suspect, to give up power
— something many believe is essential to a lasting
peace.
High-ranking visitors included NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana, the NATO commander in
Europe, Gen. George Joulwan, and Carl Bildt, the
top civilian in charge of reconstruction in Bosnia.
,r What we now see is a major political battle shap
ing up in the (Serb territory) for the future of the
country," Bildt said.
Karadzic fired Kasagic on Wednesday, but the
premier summoned load journalists yesterday to
spell out that he did not accept the order.
"I'm fired, but I'm staying," he said, adding that
his government "can also function from Banja
Luka."
Kasagic's public defiance of Karadzic is unprece
dented in the four years since the hard-line national
ist emerged as the leader of the Bosnian Serbs and
war erupted.
A split could create an ultranationalist eastern
sector under Karadzic, based in Pale, southeast of
Sarajevo, and a moderate, western region led by
Kasagic from Banja Luka, the largest Serb-held city
in Bosnia.
"(Karadzic) is driving us towards a deadly fate, an
isolationist state," Kasagic said. "He's creating an
evil state."
"We cannot and we should not oppose the world,"
Kasagic later said in an interview with The Associat
ed Press. "We should cooperate with the world."
That attitude won support from Britain, and
from Robert Frowick, the American head of the
office overseeing Bosnian elections due by Septem
ber.
Significantly, Kasagic also won backing from Ser
bian President Slobodan Milosevic, the most power
ful Serb politician. German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel, visiting Milosevic in Belgrade, said Milosevic
"told me that he and his party do not support
Karadzic's move."
Banja Luka's influential mayor, Predrag Radic,
who supported Karadzic throughout the war, came
out in support of Kasagic yesterday.
