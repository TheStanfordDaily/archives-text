# Top Navy officer dies
## Self-inflicted shot is apparent cause of death 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The nation's
top Navy officer died yesterday from an
apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound
just hours after learning that a news
magazine was raising questions about the
legitimacy of some of his combat medals.
Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, the chief of
Navy operations, was to have met about
the time of the shooting with the Wash
ington bureau chief of Newsweek maga
zine, which was working on a story con
cerning his medals.
Administration officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said there was no
evidence the shooting was accidental and
no suspicion of foul play. Two notes were
found at Boorda's residence; they were
sealed by investigating police.
Colleagues and lawmakers who had
spoken with him in recent days expressed
shock and dismay. Several referred to the
56-year-old admiral as "a sailor's sailor."
At the White House, President Clinton
praised Boorda, the first enlisted sailor in
the history of the Navy to rise to its top
position, as a man of "extraordinary ener
gy, dedication and good humor."
Navy Secretary John Dalton said he
had met with Boorda a day earlier. "He
was in great spirits," Dalton said. "He
was in excellent spirits."
The questions about the legitimacy of
Boorda's combat "V" award came at a

time when the Navy as an institution has
come under fire from critics for moral
lapses, starting with the 1991 Tailhook
sexual assault scandal and more recently
focusing on drug use at the Naval Acade
my and sexual harassment in the officer
corps.
In recent interviews Boorda had
emphasized his determination to move
the Navy into a new era and away from
the controversies that dogged it in recent
years.
Rear Adm. Kendell Pease, who was
with Boorda a little over an hour before
the shooting, said Boorda was to have
met with Newsweek's bureau chief in his
Pentagon office at 2:30 p.m. to discuss
questions about his Vietnam combat
medals. The implication was that
Newsweek was investigating whether
Boorda for years had worn a combat "V"
decoration that he was not authorized to
wear.
Pease said that when he told Boorda,
at about 12:30 p.m., what the subject of
the interview was, the admiral abruptly
announced he was going home for lunch
instead of eating the meal that had been
brought to his office.
"Admiral Boorda was obviously con
cerned," said Pease, the Navy's top public
affairs officer. Pease declined to charac
terize Boorda as distraught.
