# FDA approves new pancreatic cancer drug
## 
### 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - The first
new treatment for pancreatic cancer in
30 years, a drug that offers patients the
hope of living a few weeks longer and in
less pain, won federal approval yester
day.
Eli Lilly & Co. said it will begin sell
ing the intravenous drug, gemcitabine,
under the brand name Gemzar on May
24.
Pancreatic cancer will strike about
27,000 Americans this year. Fewer
than 10 percent of all such patients live

more than a year after diagnosis
because victims of the disease generally
do not show symptoms until late in its
course.
Yesterday's approval by the Food
and Drug Administration had been
anticipated since an FDA advisory com
mittee recommended it last July.
Doctors probably will use it to treat
some other cancers as well, including
some cases of lung cancer. Lilly has
approval to sell gemcitabine for such
uses in the United Kingdom, Australia,

South Africa and other countries.
In clinical trials that compared
Gemzar with the most commonly pre
scribed drug to treat pancreatic cancer,
Roche Holding Ltd.'s 5-Fluorouracil, or
5-FU, about a quarter of patients treat
ed with Gemzar showed improvement.
Sixty-three patients were treated
with Gemzar and the same number
with 5-FU. Gemzar patients had a
median survival of 5.6 months com
pared with 4.2 months for those who
received 5-FU, the FDA said.

Clinical investigator Dr. Mace L.
Ilothenberg of the University of Texas
said that although the improvement in
median survival was only 1 1/2 months,
that represented a 36 percent increase.
"It's really the combination of an
improvement in survival, a decrease in
certain tumor-related symptoms, and
usually manageable side effects that
make Gemzar such an attractive and
welcomed new treatment for patients
with pancreatic cancer," Rothenberg
said.
