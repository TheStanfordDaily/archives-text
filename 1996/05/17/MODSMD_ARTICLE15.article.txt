# Four Freemen meet the FBI face-to-face

### 
JORDAN, Mont. (AP) - After
tentative handshakes on a muddy
road, FBI agents and members of
the extremist Freemen group met
face-to-face yesterday for the first
time since their standoff began on
March 25.
Four Freemen negotiators
talked with two FBI agents and
Colorado Sen. Charles Duke for
almost two hours in a steady rain
near the gate of the 960-acre ranch
in eastern Montana. Duke had met
separately with the Freemen for 2
1/2 hours yesterday morning
before returning with the agents.
Two Freemen sentries kept
watch in a pickup truck nearby,
and a corps of reporters and pho
tographers about half a mile away
observed the talks through long
lens cameras and binoculars.
A local resident at the scene
identified two of the Freemen as
Rodney Skurdal and Edwin Clark,
who are among the leaders of the
extreme right-wing group. Clark
appeared to be doing most of the
talking.
Clark is a member of the farm

ing and ranching family that owned
the land before a bank foreclosed
on it in 1994. Skurdal, of Roundup,
Mont., was identified earlier by
negotiator James "Bo" Gritz as one
of a few hardcore members of the
group who would be least likely to
want to surrender.
A television reporter identified a
third Freeman involved in the
talks as Russell Landers, a North
Carolina man and fugitive from
Colorado who is accused of filing
phony property liens against offi
cials.
Gritz, who gave up in frustra
tion after twice meeting with the
extremist group, has since urged
the FBI to stage a non-violent
nighttime raid on the complex of
buildings where the fugitives from
justice are staying, the Denver
Post reported yesterday.
"A coordinated nonviolent
strike against all four areas deep
on a moonless night might well
result in capture of all 21 occu
pants without bodily injury to
either side," the newspaper quoted
Gritz's report to the FBI as saying.
