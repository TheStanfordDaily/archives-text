Whitewater jury deliberations
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - The jury in the
fraud case against Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and Bill
Clinton's former Whitewater partners spent
five hours yesterday weighing the word of the
president against that of a small-town felon.
The jury elected Sandra Wood, a 38-year-old
registered nurse and mother of two from Rus
sellville, as its forewoman. They were told to
resume deliberations this morning and then
take the weekend off if need be.
Defense attorney Bobby McDaniel said the
verdict would set the tone for the rest of inde
pendent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation
into Whitewater.
"Acquittal of all the charges should shut
down the Whitewater investigation," he said.
Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and James and Susan
McDougal are accused of defrauding two feder
ally backed lenders out of nearly $3 million
between 1985 and 1987, when Tucker was in
private business and the McDougals ran the
now-defunct Madison Guaranty Savings and
Loan.
The prosecution's star witness, small-town
banker David Hale, testified that he conspired
with McDougal and Tucker to lend them and
their friends money that was eventually mis
used for personal or improper business purpos
es.
