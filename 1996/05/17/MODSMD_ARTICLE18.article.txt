Stanford must be more
definite and explicit when
determining IDP policies

The recent decisions
to eliminate the programs in
Science, Technology and
Society and East Asian Studies
highlight a troublesome lack of any
clearly definable policy toward
interdisciplinary programs (IDPs).
The University must make public
and definite its ideas regarding
such programs.
In the case of STS, the program
is being closed because not enough
tenure-line faculty have come for
ward to put the time in to support
the growing number of majors.
Plowever, East Asian Studies,
which seems to have faculty sup
port, is being closed due to a lack of
student involvement and a feeling
by the University that the program
duplicates subject matter covered
by other majors.
It is clear that shrinking federal
research dollars are forcing the
University to reconsider what its
fundamental mission should be.
Rather than support weaker
departments, steps are rightly
being taken to consolidate and
strengthen departments and more
efficiently allocate resources.
However, the University cannot
continue to cut programs based on
what seems to be an inconsistent
set of "values. Does student opinion
matter in this arena? WhaC'is the
University's commitment to under
graduate education — particularly
to humanities and non-science pur
suits — when times get tough, as
they are now?
Indeed, the University seems to
see interdisciplinary programs as
fads and treats them as such. As
long as faculty are interested, these
programs live. However, interdisci
plinary programs cannot offer the
incentives (such as research and
tenure) that full-fledged depart

ments offer to ensure that profes
sors stay interested in popular pro
grams such as STS, Earth Systems
or American Studies. And, unfortu
nately, the University seems to be
unwilling to re-examine the way it
has structured IDPs.
University President Gerhard
Casper recently made a landmark
speech to christen a massive initia
tive that would expand Stanford's
focus on undergraduate education,
adding 20 incremental billets for
professors who would emphasize
enhancing the first two years of
students' educational careers and
creating freshman seminars.
Now, when Casper is actively
addressing the issue of undergrad
uate academics, would also be the
appropriate time for Casper to con
front the issue of Stanford's policy
on IDPs. For example, Casper said
he sees Stanford as being the gate
way to the Pacific Rim — demon
strating that his thoughts regard
ing education are forward-think
ing. Yet the University is still elim
inating East Asian Studies and
STS. it seems that majors such as
these, while demanding resources
and money now, will allow the Uni
versity to achieve its goal of provid
ing progressive and timely educa
tion.
In many cases, interdisciplinary
programs are the most accessible
means through which students can
achieve this type of academic expe
rience. These programs offer the
best of many worlds, combining
strengths of multiple departments
to provide majors with a greater
breadth of material.
The faculty and administration
have an obligation to be forthright
about their policy toward interdis
ciplinary programs. If student opin
ion is truly irrelevant to future of
any such program — as it seems to
be — the administration must be
public about it. Without a clear
University policy, there can be no
way for these programs to know
what they need to do in order to
strengthen themselves and remain
a part of Stanford's prestigious aca
demic tradition.
