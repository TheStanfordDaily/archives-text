# Fac Sen votes for funding reserves
## Also discusses writing, secret research 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
The Faculty
Senate yester
day passed a
draft resolution
that would cre
ate reserves to
fill gaps in fund
ing for graduate
students.
Responding

to three recommendations from a
report by the Planning and Policy
Board, the senate also discussed the
creation of a Faculty Advisory
Group which would provide for a
comprehensive review of policy
changes affecting scholarship and
sponsored research at Stanford.
The senate's Committee on Re
search will consider the recommen
dations and report back to the sen
ate next academic year.
Draft resolutions called for the
creation of two central funds — one
to "minimize the impact of the
elimination of the tuition remission
practice" for doctoral students in
their first two years and the second
to provide matching funds for the
purchase of laboratory equipment
for sponsored research proposals —
and for departments to build up re
serves of their own.
Board member and Biology
Prof. Bob Simoni, explained after
the meeting that because of
changes in federal government pol
icy, beginning in 1997 Stanford will
no longer be able to pay graduate
student tuition out of a staff bene
fits pool. Currently, graduate stu
dents receive a yearly stipend; an
amount equivalent to 30 percent of
this is contributed to the benefits
pool.
Grant holders will still control a
stipend and some part of tuition,
but "what's not clear is what gov
ernment policy will be," Simoni
said. "Money obtained from federal
sources for sponsored research will
require that tuition be charged di
rectly to the project and will mean
that the amount the project will

have to pay will be higher."
At the meeting, Provost Con
doleezzaa Rice expressed some
skepticism about the possibility of
creating central funds exclusively
to cover graduate student expenses.
"Obviously we're all very con
cerned about the state of federal
funding," Rice said. But, she added,
"we simply can't buffet every whim
from the federal government.... I
don't think the University is about
to make a commitment to a central
fund for this purpose."
Simoni said while he thinks Rice
has no problem with the board's
recommendat ion that departments
create reserve funds, "the problem
is some departments don't have
any reserves with which to cover
the losses. ... For some depart
ments the change will hardly be no
ticeable, and for some departments
it could be devastating."
He said that "as a matter of prin
ciple" it is true that "narrowly de
fined funds are a bad idea." But, he
added, "it's not entirely clear yet"
what the University is going to do.
In other business, the senate
passed an addendum to the Secrecy
in Research Policy, which protects
Stanford researchers from having
sponsors delay publication of their
findings because of commercial in
terests. Stanford faculty will now
be free to engage in large, multi
person research projects.
The addendum, which will allow
for exceptions to the current 90-day
limit on how long publication of
study results can be delayed, is
something that recognizes how
trends in research have changed
over the past 25 years, said Applied
Physics Prof. Robert Byer, chair of
the Committee on Research.
"When this clause was adopted
more than 25 years ago, research
consisted primarily of single inves
tigator programs where data was
largely at the control of one individ
ual," Byer said in his memorandum
to the senate. The problem now, he
continued, is that many research
