## When it's time to change 
### 
HAIR. THAT BIT of fur or fuzz on
the top of our scalps. You'll par
don me for slipping into what
might be called frivolity, but this is a
topic near and dear to, well, to my head. I
will not pretend that I am one of those
people who spends a lot of time on her
hair. Besides the fact that you can tell
just by looking at me, were I to even hint
at such a thing, those who know me
would laugh and send letters to the news
paper calling me a fraud, and after talk
ing about integrity, I couldn't have that,
now could I?
But this is not a frivolous issue. A
large part of people's self-image is tied up
in their hair. Hair can be trendy. I would
guess one popular trend is the "Friends"
look, though I read that it is passe
already. And do you remember the
Dorothy Hamill look? Last I saw,
Dorothy was still wearing it, and looking
good too.
Hair styles can be defining, intention
ally or unintentionally. There was a sign
during BGLAD week in White Plaza that
said "Dyke Haircuts." Someone informed
me that lesbian women have a tendency
to wear their hair in shorter hair styles,
and I guess the sign verified that to some
extent. Short styles are also prescribed
for older women, allegedly to create the
illusion of youth. You're punk if you dye
your hair bright colors, hippie (for men)
if you grow it long, radical if you cut it
short, frumpy if you've been wearing it in

the same style since kindergarten. (You
can put me in the frumpy group.)
Hair can be a volatile topic in the
African-American community. I'm not
going to go into the whole good hair / bad
hair issue. Those of you who have never
heard of it can find out about it on your
own. (If you've seen Spike Lee's movie
"School Daze," then you have some idea.)
But African-American women have a mul
titude of options for what can be done with
our hair, and each option has its own impli
cation, again intentional or otherwise.
The broad categories include relaxers,
braids, naturals and dreadlocks; combine
with coloring and there are dozens,
maybe hundreds, of different styles. The
versatility of our hair is astounding, both
to me and, judging from the questions I
get when I do something different, to oth
ers as well.
There is also a kind of hierarchy to the
options. Women tend to go through each
of the options in turn. A graduate stu
dent here at Stanford wrote and pro
duced a video which chronicles black
women and their attitudes about their
hair. While in many cases the hair
options were an attempt to get low-main
tenance hair, other people often inter
preted it differently. A friend of mine who
has gone through the entire gamut, each
time searching for something that would
be less damaging, less costly and less
time-consuming, was scolded by her
mother for settling on dreads.

Relaxers are generally thought of as
the most socially acceptable hair option;
though the extreme might say that it rep
resents selling out, an attempt by the per
son wearing one to mimic white hair.
This is silly, since no one has a copyright
on hairstyles, in spite of the controversy
years ago over Bo Derek or the outrage
felt by some over white people who wear
dreadlocks.
Wearing braids is becoming increas
ingly socially acceptable, perhaps by
sheer force of numbers. But braids, and
to an even greater extent, dreadlocks are
usually interpreted by others as a bold
hairstyle. People who wear dreadlocks
are viewed as being defiant, an image
which, I suppose, comes from the linger
ing image of Rastafarians smoking mari
juana. For most of the people I know,
wearing braids or dreads is one of two
things: a reflection of their unwillingness
to spend a lot of time on their hair or a
desire to be fashionable.
I guess how one wears one's hair is as
much of a statement about one as the
clothes one wears. There's a song from
the '70s which contains the line "Nobody
cares how you wear your hair, dahling." I
won't care if you don't.

streak in her hair will be gone by finals.
