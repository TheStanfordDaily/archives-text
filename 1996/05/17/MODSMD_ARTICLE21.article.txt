Curriculum Committee attentive to STS student concerns

ON MONDAY, several STS stu
dent representatives were invited
to attend a meeting with Dean
Shoven and the H&S Curriculum Com
mittee. In a 50-minute discussion, the
representatives described the impor
tance of the STS major to the Universi
ty, presented 16 pledge sheets collected
from faculty and provided evidence of
support from students and alumni.
It was about three weeks ago that
students received news about the deci
sion to discontinue the STS major.
While the future of STS remains uncer
tain, Monday's meeting with the Cur
riculum Committee was an encouraging
first step in involving students in the
decision-making process. As one of the
representatives and on behalf of the STS
majors, I would like to thank the com
mittee members for their attentiveness
to student concerns.
The complex issues surrounding STS'

ability to confer degrees will require fur
ther concerted thought and discussion
by administrators, faculty and students.
Perhaps it will be useful at this point to
bring some STS concepts to bear on the
complex issues. Hopefully, new insights
may be found in such an exercise.
STS is a field of inquiry that provides
intellectual tools and frameworks for
understanding the relationships
between science, technology and society.
It is a technology, if you will, that
enables thinkers and professionals to
analyze aspects of contemporary society.
As with all technologies, STS exists
not in a vacuum but in a Social-Cultur
al-Economic System (SCES) called the
University. The system at Stanford is
oriented towards supporting and main
taining disciplines, e.g. history and elec
trical engineering. As a result, interdisci
plinary programs (IDPs) can only be
sustained by part-time faculty involve-

ment. STS' existence within the system
is threatened because senior faculty who
have buttressed it in the past have
either retired or scaled down their par
ticipation. A group of junior faculty are
eager to fill the vacuum, but their par
ticipation is regarded by the academic
community as a detriment to their
tenure qualifications. The decision not
to renew STS' degree-granting authority
makes the statement: the lack of faculty
support justifies dismantling the major.
Such logic misses the point that other
parties have a stake in the STS degree:
students, alumni, professionals and soci
ety at large.
Furthermore, as a technology, STS
evolves over time. The undergraduate
program has been adjusted and tuned to
increase academic rigor and meet the
needs of students. The doubling of
majors this year attests to the success
and quality of the program.

The field of STS has itself evolved to
become a recognized discipline since a
group of dedicated faculty began their
homebrew experiment at Stanford in
1971. There are now established modes
of inquiry, journals, academic societies
and a body of trained scholars. Perhaps
the absence of senior faculty support for
the STS program reflects the sentiment
and realization that just treatment of
the STS field requires more in-depth
training.
Perhaps the current crisis with STS
at Stanford points to the need to address
the institutional barriers that threaten a
valuable undergraduate curriculum.
With something as important as STS,
let's not repeat the example of the Kabu
ki Samurai and reject a technology just
because it is inconsistent with current
cultural values.
