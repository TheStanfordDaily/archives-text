# Humanities professors must utilize expertise
## 
### 
Wednesday's editorial, with which I
substantially agree, mentions my
remarks in the Academic Senate about
the loss of top graduate candidates in
the humanities to other universities
with fellowships richer than Stanford's.
The specific department I had in mind is
not English but Comparative Literature,
which lost two leading candidates to
other major programs. Our four-year fel

lowship had to compete, in one case,
with six years of guaranteed support
and, in the other, with five years.
James G. Wheaton's column sits
uneasily on the same Opinions page
with your editorial. Mr. Wheaton
deplores expert research in the humani
ties on the ground that it cannot be
understood by the "intelligent layman."
He prefers journalism to learned
inquiry. Would he advocate that Stan
ford science courses all be taught by
faculty lacking expertise to students
who would prefer to rely simply on
basic intelligence rather than, say, skill

in the calculus and statistics? These
tools, so basic to scientific understand
ing, have their counterparts in the
humanities (poorly taught in high
schools though these often seem to be).
Similarly, some kinds of knowledge in
the humanities are difficult to under
stand or, like certain important mathe
matical and scientific principles, even
counterintuitive. All faculty need to
bring their expert knowledge to class
rooms in forms that students can com
prehend. It does not follow that under
standing should come instantaneously,
without application or without prior

training. These things said, most Stan
ford faculty in the humanities are quite
capable of communicating their special
knowledge and research to general
audiences. They regularly do so in
classrooms, alumni gatherings, contin
uing studies courses, widely circulated
magazines, and in books whose accessi
bility is certified not only through non
academic literary competitions but,
more concretely, by their broad sale in
bookstores.
