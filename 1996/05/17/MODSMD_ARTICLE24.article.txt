# Allison Amend: The better part of valor
## Look again for the first time â€” your eyes will water 
### 
I JUST GOT off the phone with three
Stanford alumni. Two graduated in
the early 1930s and one taught here
in the '60s. Those were the good old days,
both contingencies claimed. Those were
the days when we knew how to have fun.
The days when fountain hopping was
a novel activity. The days when Stanford
won the Rose Bowl. The days when
murky gender roles were crystal clear:
the men and women were separated by
the post office and no one went without a
date on Saturday night.
A trolley bounced its way from the top
of the Quad to downtown Palo Alto. San
Francisco was the center of a radical new
literary movement and the mecca for a
nation of restless youth.
And us, hey, we got e-mail.
Shouldn't these be our halcyon days,
the ones we look back on and can't help
but smile at, remembering? Shouldn't
these days be nonstop barrels of laughter,
be punctuated with eyes perpetually tear
ing from mirth?
Yet who do you know who is happy,

who is truly content here at the Farm?
Yeah, maybe the family of skunks who
lives under my porch and scours the
ground looking for barbecue leftovers
approaches cosmic bliss, but the rest of
us find much to complain about.
Don't we have the right? Throughout
history it has been humankind's privilege
to grumble. To be reductive (but isn't his
tory always reductive?), ancient Greece,
the origin of western civilization, was
entirely constructed around debate. The
United States was formed when a section
of society finally complained too loud.
Dissatisfaction instigates change. Dis
agreement spurs action. Debate provokes
examination. But you knew that already.
"It's a different society," says the 80-
something-year-old alumnus. "There is
an innocence that is lost." But I beg to
differ.
It is hope that is missing from our
ranks. There is little incentive to fight to
change if you are not absolutely con
vinced that change will bring a better
tomorrow.

And is there really anything I can do
about my dissatisfaction? Will this col
umn make the sun come out? I think not.
Will it get me a job? I think notter. Will it
make the registrar, without any further
prodding, grant me my bachelor's
degree? HA!
What my grumbling will accomplish is
solidarity. A sisterhood, if you will, of
others with time on their hands and no
sun to bathe in. A club of us waiting in an
interminable line at the post office. A
shared laugh among those who find it
absurd that the University spends thou
sands of dollars rekeying dorms, but
insists that you reuse ID mail envelopes
until they are covered beyond recognition
with the addresses of past recipients.
Stanford has changed much since the
graduation of my 80-year-old phone
buddy. Society has changed a lot. Proba
bly for the worse. I lament not these
changes but their amalgamated whole.
While one change might be good, changes
are inevitably disappointing.
What would I change about this place?

Move it closer to San Francisco, so that I
could complain about the noise and the
crime and the lack of greenery. I'd get rid
of DRs and never have learned about
earthquakes or brain neurobiology. I'd
bring back funding for the Humanities
and . .. well, there's not much to com
plain about there.
There's something about perspective
that privileges dulcet memories. I know
I'll look back on these four years at school
and laugh at what I thought of as my
responsibilities. I'll smile at my failed
love affairs and have a good chuckle
about that class I almost failed. I'll go out
with my buddies and we'll sing cheesy
'80s songs until my kids get embarrassed
and make me take them home. They'll be
wearing Stanford t-shirts when they do.
And when they ask me what's new,
these friends of the future, I'll probably
complain about my job, my husband or
my lack thereof. I'll grumble about the
price of gas or verbally bash the presi
dent. I'll tell the sad story of the flood in
my basement and the impossible

plumbers.
These are the good old days, and so
were those. If indeed tomorrow is worse
than May 18 of 100 years ago we'll never
know it. Bless the lack of collective
unconscious. We have little record of the
daily complaints of the remote past. Neg
ativity is tossed out with expired calen
dars.
And can't I pick out some highlights
this year? Doesn't my photo album
record me smiling with friends in the hot
tub outside my residence? Wasn't I glad
to see my picture on this page for the first
time, before the weekly space started to
feel like a burden instead of a venue?
So rant and vent and grumble and
complain and petition and write and
remember, please remember, that you'll
look back on those dissatisfactions with
cloudy eyes, vision blurred with time, and
you'll find yourself talking about those
good old days. At least, I hope you will.
