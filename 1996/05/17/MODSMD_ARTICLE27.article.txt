# Berselli bounces into editor's chair

### Jesse Ochs Feld R.W. Herman Jr. Special to The New York Times 
After much effort and substan
tial assistance, Daily Managing
Editor Beth Berselli ultimately
succeeded in opening a bottle of
champagne last night.
"If Juice Club had corks, I'd be
really upset," Berselli said. "Then
again, if I were a possum, I'd be re
ally upset, too."
Berselli's cork-popping was
prompted by her election as The
Daily's new editor in chief. She
was assisted in the corkectomy by
Editor in Chief Emerita Sarah
Beth Katz and "Constitution '96:
A New Constitution for the
ASSU" author Michael Slemmer,
who is not a Daily employee.
After learning of her victory,
Berselli was even perkier than
usual.
"That's really great," she said.
"I'd really like to thank everyone
who voted for me. In fact, I'd like
to thank everyone who voted for
Seth, too. In fact, I'd just like to
thank everyone for everything
they ever might have done."
Berselli received 39 votes; her
closest competitor Seth Goldstein,
The Daily's other managing edi
tor, received 27 and Adam "The
Hat Guy" Kemezis, Richie "The
Boat-Dancin' Fool" Ganitsky,
Mary "Megan" Peer and Jon
"COP Wunderkind" Oram re
ceived one vote each.
Surprisingly, an old friend of
Berselli's was once elected to
something.
"You see, Mrs. Creamer, my
next-door neighbor (who I go jog
ging with but would never call by
her first name) once told me about
a friend of hers whose daughter
was once living in the same apart

ment building with someone
whose uncle had a dog he bought
from a man who had been elected
to something somewhere," she
said. "Mrs. Creamer never got to
tell me where, though. We had to
evacuate the country club before
she could finish the story."
Berselli had a tough childhood;
sometimes the country club would
flood.
Earlier in the day, Berselli an
swered questions from The Daily's
staff during the traditional "grill
session." She was resplendent in a
gray flannel suit, exquisitely ac
cessorized with a photo-blue
markup pen attached to her
brassiere with just the right touch
of panache.
"Did you know that George
Clooney gave Noah Wyle his old
car?" Berselli inquired immediate
ly after her election. "Really. It's
in People. Noah Wyle is so cute.
And we have the same birthday,
too."
Some staffers, however, seemed
confused when told that Berselli
had won the race. "Who's this
'Beth Berselli?' " many staffers
asked (in unison, surprisingly
enough, so it really was like one
voice talking). "The only Beth here
we know is some woman who al
ways calls us at home named 'Beth
Fromthedaily.' "
Goldstein, who promised to
delay his graduate school career
if elected editor, said Berselli's
victory was a sign of the deterio
rating state of American culture
due to an over-reliance on liberal
thought and a turn away from
the meritocracy that the Pound
ing Fathers had originally in
tended. "However, a careful
analysis of thje 1964 Republican
primary statistics clearly shows
that Beth would win today," he

said.
In other election news, Assoc.
Communication Prof. TedGlasser
was elected to The Daily's Board of
Directors, as were business stu
dent Jon Berlin and former Daily

business manager Michael Lond
gren.

After swiggin' the champagne, newly elected Daily Editor in Chief
Beth Berselli looked up in alarm and said, "Wait, this isn't Pinapple
Pizazz with juice boost!" She then ran a mop to clean up the mess on
the floor.
