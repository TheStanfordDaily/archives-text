## Men's, women's tennis seek elusive national title Second-seeded men open their NCAA title defense tomorrow at Georgia vs. No. 16 Longhorns 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
Now is the time for the Stan
ford men's tennis team. The
NCAA tournament has arrived,
and the Cardinal will step onto
the courts at the University of
Georgia tomorrow in a must-win
situation. Any loss from this
point onward means Stanford
can pack up its sneakers and rac
quets and head back to Palo Alto.
But if the Card can string togeth
er four consecutive victories, it
will return triumphantly as the
national champion.
Last year, Stanford cruised to
the title, winning all four of its
postseason matches easily. The
1995 Cardinal was so dominant,
in fact, that it never dropped
more than one point in any of its
NCAA matches.
This year's Stanford squad en
ters the tourney as the No. 2 seed
behind top-ranked UCLA, and
faces No. 16 Texas (22-4) in the
first round tomorrow. B.J.
Stearns, a sophomore from Flori
da, is Texas' top-ranked player, at
No. 40. Stanford boasts of three
players ranked higher in senior
Jeff Salzenstein (No. 4), fresh
man Ryan Wolters (No. 11) and
sophomore Paul Goldstein (No.
28).
But while Texas does not have
the big names or talent that Stan
ford does, the Longhorns are
nonetheless a very formidable
squad capable of upsetting any
body. In 1993 Texas brought
Stanford's season to a premature
end, surprising the Cardinal 5-2
in the second round.
This year, the Longhorns will
again be very dangerous. They
had a rough road in winning their
regional, escaping with a narrow
4-3 victory over No. 19 Texas
A&M in the semifinals and a 4-2
defeat of No. 13 North Carolina
in the finals.
"We're not very familiar with
Texas," said senior Jim Thomas.
"It's a little scary when you don't
know what to expect from a team,
but I think we should be fine as
long as we play a solid match."

Senior Ricky Becker said he
believes Stanford should be able
to overmatch Texas with its tal
ent, but that nothing is for cer
tain in the NCAAs. "They're a
tough, scrappy team, and they'll
fight hard," he said. "If we don't
play well, they could definitely
beat us."
Should Stanford advance to
the quarterfinals, its Sunday op
ponent will be the winner of No.
10 Duke and No. 5 USC. Both
teams have had impressive years
— Duke is 20-5, USC is 17-6 —
and look to be very difficult hur
dles in Stanford's run to the title.
Duke comes into the tourna
ment on a high note. The Blue
Devils advanced to Georgia by
cruising through their regional
tournament. They beat No. 33
Florida State in the finals handi
ly, 4-0. Duke's top player, senior
Rob Chess, is ranked No. 13 and
has knocked off a number of the
nation's top players this year.
USC received an automatic
berth to the championships as re
ward for its high ranking. Eight
teams receive automatic berths.
This year UCLA, Stanford, Mis
sissippi, Texas Christian, USC,
Fresno State and Mississippi
State were awarded the free trip
to Georgia.
In Stanford's last encounter
with USC, the Trojans handed
the Cardinal its only loss to a
team other than UCLA. In that
match, USC won the fourth, fifth
and sixth singles matches along
with the doubles point to pre
serve a 4-3 upset in Los Angeles.
In their only other matchup
this year, the Cardinal barely es
caped with a 5-2 win at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium. Thomas
and Goldstein both had to pull
out three-set, come-from-behind
wins at second and third singles,
respectively, to chalk up a "W" in
the Stanford win column.
Should USC and Stanford
meet, the first singles match
ought to be a dandy. It would
probably pit USC freshman star
