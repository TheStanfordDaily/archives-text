# No. 2-ranked women to meet No. 20 Clemson in NCAA first-round play
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
For the No. 2 Stanford women's tennis squad,
the second season begins tomorrow.
After 23 dual matches, the Cardinal (22-1 over
all, 10-0 Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division)
begins its quest for a national championship to
morrow morning with a battle against the No. 20
Clemson Tigers.
Stanford, by virtue of its top-10 ranking, re
ceived an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament
in Tallahassee, Fla. The Tigers (15-9, 5-3 Atlantic
Coast Conference) on the other hand, who were not
in the top 10 nationally, qualified for a berth in the
draw by winning its regional tournament last
week.
As expected, the Cardinal received the second
seed in the draw, beneath the only team to beat
Stanford this season, No. 1 Florida. Clemson was
seeded in the bottom group, 13-16. Only the top
four teams are seeded individually.
Clemson's strengths are at the top of the lineup,
which features freshman Sophie Woroons, a native
of France. Woroons has compiled a 19-5 record
playing at the top singles spot and ranks 15th in the
national singles polls. The freshman was recently
named ACC Player of the Year.
Woroons also has enjoyed success at the No. 1
doubles spot, where she and senior Jan Barrett
boast a No. 8 national ranking and a 17-5 dual
match record.
Barrett is Clemson's next most successful sin
gles competitor, ranking 58th in singles while post
ing a 17-6 record at the No. 2 spot.
Woroons and Barrett should have their hands
full with the Cardinal, however. At the No. 1 posi
tion, Woroons will face sophomore All-American
Ania Bleszynski, who is 16-7 this season and sev
enth in the nation in singles.
At the No. 2 position, Barrett will not find a
much easier opponent. Junior All-American Katie
Schlukebir sits just three spots lower then
Bleszynski in singles at No. 10 and has been tough
this season with a 18-4 dual-match record.
Bleszynski and Schlukebir will team up to face
the Tiger duo in doubles as well. The Cardinal No.
1 tandem is 10-3 on the year and ranks second na
tionally.
The Cardinal depth may prove to be effective
once again in the first-round matchup. At the Nos.
3-6 spots, the Tigers are just 43-36 combined, while
the Cardinal is a collective 68-13.
The Lady Tigers have defeated five teams in the
top 25 this season, including an impressive 5-4 win
over No. 9 Brigham Young in March.
Stanford and Clemson have met two mutual op
ponents. The Cardinal defeated No. 5 Wake Forest
in singles by a score of 5-1 in Feb
ruary, while the Demon Deacons
dropped Clemson twice in confer
ence play. Both squads fell prey to
the top-ranked Gators.
In addition to getting its ex
pected seed, the Cardinal received
a favorable draw for the rest of
the tournament. The other top
seed in the Cardinal half of the
bracket is Duke, seeded third.
The fourth seed, Arizona, is in the
other half of the draw with Flori
da.
The Stanford-Clemson winner
will meet the winner of the Notre
Dame-Brigham Young matchup,
which could create problems if
the Cougars win.
For religious reasons, BYU
cannot compete on Sundays and
by NCAA rules, it does not have to
under any circumstances. Conse
quently, its opponent — most
likely the Cardinal — will have
the option of either playing a sec
ond match on Saturday or push
ing the entire tournament back
one day.
The remaining teams in the
Cardinal's bracket include Pac-10
rival USC, defending champion
Texas and No. 16 William &
Mary.
Notably absent from the draw
this spring is California, which
has qualified for the NCAA tour
nament every year since the
NCAA began sponsoring it in
1982. The Golden Bears were
eliminated from contention by
USC in the regional final.
Georgia, which began the sea
son ranked in the top five, also will
not be traveling to Tallahassee
this season. The Lady Bulldogs
dropped all the way to No. 18 at
season's end, lost a singles com
petitor late in the season and lost
in the regional finals to Clemson.
Stanford is riding the momen
tum of a 12-match winning
streak. Clemson, meanwhile, has
a winning streak of three match
es, all of them coming in the qual
ifying tournament.
The Cardinal and the Tigers
have met on two previous occa
sions in the NCAA Tournament,
both in the first round. The Car
dinal has won both meetings, 9-0
in 1982 and 8-1 in 1984.
Stanford has never lost in the
first round of the NCAA Champi
onships.
