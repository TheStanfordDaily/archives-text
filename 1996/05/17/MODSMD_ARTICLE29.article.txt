### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
For the No. 2 Stanford women's tennis squad,
the second season begins tomorrow.
After 23 dual matches, the Cardinal (22-1 over
all, 10-0 Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division)
begins its quest for a national championship to
morrow morning with a battle against the No. 20
Clemson Tigers.
Stanford, by virtue of its top-10 ranking, re
ceived an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament
in Tallahassee, Fla. The Tigers (15-9, 5-3 Atlantic
Coast Conference) on the other hand, who were not
in the top 10 nationally, qualified for a berth in the
draw by winning its regional tournament last
week.
As expected, the Cardinal received the second
seed in the draw, beneath the only team to beat
Stanford this season, No. 1 Florida. Clemson was
seeded in the bottom group, 13-16. Only the top
four teams are seeded individually.
Clemson's strengths are at the top of the lineup,
which features freshman Sophie Woroons, a native
of France. Woroons has compiled a 19-5 record
playing at the top singles spot and ranks 15th in the
national singles polls. The freshman was recently
named ACC Player of the Year.
Woroons also has enjoyed success at the No. 1
doubles spot, where she and senior Jan Barrett
boast a No. 8 national ranking and a 17-5 dual
match record.
Barrett is Clemson's next most successful sin
gles competitor, ranking 58th in singles while post
ing a 17-6 record at the No. 2 spot.
Woroons and Barrett should have their hands
full with the Cardinal, however. At the No. 1 posi
tion, Woroons will face sophomore All-American
Ania Bleszynski, who is 16-7 this season and sev
enth in the nation in singles.
At the No. 2 position, Barrett will not find a
much easier opponent. Junior All-American Katie
Schlukebir sits just three spots lower then
Bleszynski in singles at No. 10 and has been tough
this season with a 18-4 dual-match record.
Bleszynski and Schlukebir will team up to face
the Tiger duo in doubles as well. The Cardinal No.
1 tandem is 10-3 on the year and ranks second na
tionally.
The Cardinal depth may prove to be effective
once again in the first-round matchup. At the Nos.
3-6 spots, the Tigers are just 43-36 combined, while
the Cardinal is a collective 68-13.
The Lady Tigers have defeated five teams in the
top 25 this season, including an impressive 5-4 win
over No. 9 Brigham Young in March.
Stanford and Clemson have met two mutual op
ponents. The Cardinal defeated No. 5 Wake Forest
