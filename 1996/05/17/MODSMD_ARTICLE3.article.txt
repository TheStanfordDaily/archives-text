### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
At the first meeting of the
ASSU Senate-elect, a strong ma
jority of senators voted to seat
graduate senator Donald Aing
worth as its new chair.
Aingworth — a computer sci
ence graduate student who will
serve the senate for a third term
next year — garnered 12 of 17 sen
ate votes after speaking about the
importance of impartiality in fa
cilitating the actions of the senate.
"I will represent the views of
the senate, not mine," Aingworth
said. "I hope to totally depoliticize

the office" of the senate chair.
Aingworth defeated under
graduate senator Gil Serrano,
who received four votes. In his
candidacy speech, Serrano
stressed the need to advocate for
student interests and do more to
seek out student sentiments on
ways the ASSU could better rep
resent them.
"It's still going to be a produc
tive year," Serrano said after the
vote. "[Aingworthl is definitely
the guru on rules and procedures.
As long as he stays committed to
helping senators get their jobs
