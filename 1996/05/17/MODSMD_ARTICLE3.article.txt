# Plans to focus on keeping chair impartial
## Aingworth elected ASSU Senate chair 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
At the first meeting of the
ASSU Senate-elect, a strong ma
jority of senators voted to seat
graduate senator Donald Aing
worth as its new chair.
Aingworth — a computer sci
ence graduate student who will
serve the senate for a third term
next year — garnered 12 of 17 sen
ate votes after speaking about the
importance of impartiality in fa
cilitating the actions of the senate.
"I will represent the views of
the senate, not mine," Aingworth
said. "I hope to totally depoliticize

the office" of the senate chair.
Aingworth defeated under
graduate senator Gil Serrano,
who received four votes. In his
candidacy speech, Serrano
stressed the need to advocate for
student interests and do more to
seek out student sentiments on
ways the ASSU could better rep
resent them.
"It's still going to be a produc
tive year," Serrano said after the
vote. "[Aingworthl is definitely
the guru on rules and procedures.
As long as he stays committed to
helping senators get their jobs
done, it's going to be a great year."
In a period of debate in which
senators discussed the two candi
dates and how they might or
might not benefit the ASSU, sev
eral senators who have worked
with Aingworth and Serrano
called attention to Aingworth's
extensive and meticulous knowl
edge of the ASSU Constitution
and bylaws, while praising Serra
no for his accomplishments as a
leader of projects outside the sen
ate.
Noting that the ASSU has the
uncommon opportunity to rede
fine the role of the chair, under
graduate senator Joe Freund
called for the senate to consider
two directions: an emphasis on
"structure and rules" under Aing
worth or on "opinionated leader
ship" under Serrano.
Aingworth currently serves on
the senate's Administration and

Rules Committee and has been re
sponsible for rewriting a large por
tion of the current bylaws in order
to make them feasible under the
new ASSU constitution.
Serrano admitted that if he had
been elected chair, he "wouldn't
have been able to pursue (his] per
sonal projects as much." Among
Serrano's project successes was
negotiating with Stanford Cardi
nal Broadcasting Network to get
the senate's bi-weekly meetings
televised.
The senate-elect also approved
a bill that accepted the recommen
dations of the ASSU Transition
Committee, which in the past two
weeks met with Dean of Students
Marc Wais and Senior University
Council Thomas Fenner, and rec
ommended that the last five vote
getting undergraduate and gradu
ate senators-elect become ex-offi
cio members of the senate.
Under the new constitution ex
officio senate members may vote
in senate committees but will not
have voting power at senate meet
ings.
