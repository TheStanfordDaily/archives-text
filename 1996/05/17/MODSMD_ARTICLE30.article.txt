# Track and field looks to cause a Pac-10 splash

This weekend, when the Stanford track
and field team travels to UCIA to participate
in the Pacific 10 Conference Championships,
it will represent more than just the end of the
Pac-10 season â€” it will symbolize the begin
ning of the re-emergence of the Stanford
track and field program. For the first time in
recent memory, both the Stanford men's and
women's teams will be traveling to Pac-lOs
with the purpose of making an impact.
In only his fourth year at the helm of both
the Stanford cross-country and track and
field programs, head coach Vin Lananna has
brought the Cardinal track program back to
league respectability.
"Our athletes have done a great job and our
program has come a long, long way," said
Lananna. "We didn't worry about the score in
my first couple of years. It was just unrealis
tic."
To illustrate the point, Lananna compared
his 1993 Pac-10 squad, his first at Stanford,
which had a total of 18 athletes, to this year's
crew, which has a full complement of 48.
Obviously, the infusion of talent and the
athletes' performances have made the rebirth
of the program possible. Throwers and middle
distance and distance runners make up the
backbone of both teams.
A talented corps of women runners is head
ed by the steadying influence of senior captain
Dena Dey, who ran an Olympic Trial qualify
ing time of 4:16.30 in the 1,500 last weekend
at the Cardinal Invitational.
Senior captain Mark Fadil provides both
experience and performance for the male run
ners. Sophomore Adam Connolly, junior
Justin Strand and senior Pete Swanson make
up an impressive array of throwers.
"We go with kids who are prepared to do
something at the Pac-lOs, not make the Pac
-10s," Lananna said. "The goal is no longer is
to qualify, the goal now is fto see] when I get
there, what do I do?"
What has made the Cardinal revival even
more impressive is the environment in which
the resurgence took place. Ihe Pac-10 repre
sents the most talented conglomeration of
track and field programs in the nation, which
makes the task of moving up the pecking
order very difficult.
