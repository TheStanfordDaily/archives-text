# Men's golf out in front after one round
## No. 17 Cardinal tied for lead at NCAA Regional; Woods, Kribel are one-two 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Ominous skies continually threatened to halt
play, but not even a sporadic drizzle could dampen
the Cardinal's performance at the NCAA West Re
gional Championships yesterday afternoon.
Standing firm on its home turf, the 17th-ranked
Stanford men's golf team bolted out of the gate to
grab a share of the lead after one round of play.
"I am very confident about our performance,"
said head coach Wally Goodwin. "We've been prac
ticing well and have gained a lot of confidence.
"Golf is a funny game though, so anything can
happen between now and Saturday."
Tied with Pepperdine with a 2-over-par 286, the
team battled the less-than-ideal conditions to es
tablish a 2-stroke lead over a strong Nevada-Las
Vegas squad and an 8-stroke advantage over na
tional title-contender Arizona State.
"This is a very solid region, so I expect a lot of
competition from a number of squads," Goodwin
said.
Stanford's solid start relied heavily on the siz
zling play of Cardinal young guns Tiger Woods and
Joel Kribel, who found themselves all alone at the
top of the leaderboard in first and second place, re
spectively. Woods, a sophomore Ail-American, im
proved on his region-low stroke average of 70.69
with a 3-under-par 68. Freshman Kribel was close
behind at 69.
Among the other starters, senior David Garcia dis
played his poise by opening the competition in 20th

place at 2-over-par. Questionable
as a starter until last week, Gar
cia provided a welcome contribu
tion in light of senior captain
Jerry Chang's difficult round.
Chang finds himself in 86th place
after struggling to find a rhythm
and shooting 8-over-par. Junior
Conrad Ray posted the Cardinal's
fourth score, firing a 5-over-par
76 to tie for 51st.

While rain kept the crowds
small, the squad hopes for more
spectators as the tournament

"The home course advantage

can really help us if we have a lot
of support as far as fan support,"
Goodwin said. "When a guy
makes a nice shot and hears the
home crowd cheering for him, it
can really give him a boost.
"Hopefully, we'll get some
more folks out to see us."
The second round begins
today here on the Farm, with
the first golfers teeing off at 8
a.m. Play should continue
through the early afternoon —
weather permitting — with the
final round played tomorrow.
Admission is $4 per round.
