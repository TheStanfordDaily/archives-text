### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
In a statement released yesterday
morning, Stanford softball head coach
Sandy Pearce announced she would not
renew her contract after three years of
service on the Farm.
"I feel I came here to start and build a
competitive program and I've done that,"
said Pearce. "It was hard to tell the team,
but I fell that this is the right move."
Pearce has nursed the Stanford soft
ball program to maturity since taking
over head coaching duties in 1994. Prior
to her arrival, softball was a non-scholar
ship club sport; in three short years it
has evolved into a fully-funded national
ly-competitive squad. Under Pearce's

guidance, the Cardinal skyrocketed from
5-30 in 1994 to 15-37 in 1995, and final
ly to a 24-29 mark this season.
