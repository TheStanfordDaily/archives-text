Hoover Institution's latest endeavor takes to the air
waves of public television with a new series, "Uncom
mon Knowledge."
Beginning with the pilot show tomorrow, the show
focusing on public policy will be aired on Saturdays at
6:30 p.m. The half-hour weekly program is being co
produced by Hoover and KTEH television, the San Jose
Public Broadcasting Service affiliate.
Hoover director John Raisian said this entry into the
television medium was part of a larger effort on behalf
of the institution "to try and put ideas out as best we
can."
"It's really about tiying to not only just generate
ideas here but also to communicate them," said Raisian.
The pilot series will consist of 13 shows, each featur
ing leaders in public policy discussing domestic and in
ternational issues. The format mostly involves in-depth
informed conversation, as opposed to one of strict inter
view or debate.
"We are still experimenting with the format," said
Hoover Research Fellow Peter Robinson, the program's
moderator.
"In our first show Ed Meese and Joe McNamara

pretty much ended up interviewing each other," said
Robinson. "They disagree on absolutely every aspect of
the drug war imaginable. They disagree vehemently."
The series will be targeting an audience of an "in
formed public interested in public policy and the long
term development of it," said Raisian. Ultimately,
Raisian hopes that the show will transcend the local
broadcast and become nationally televised.
"This show is intended to step back and to not be ar
gumentative for the sake of theatrical expression," said
Raisian, "but instead to really tiy to get at some ideas or
discussion about how to solve some persistent policy is
sues."
"There will be good, broad discussion of the issues,"
said Hoover Senior Fellow and Political Science Prof.
Terry Moe, one of the many scheduled guests on "Un
common Knowledge." Future shows address topics in
cluding school vouchers, nuclear war and U.S. foreign
policy in both China and Bosnia
"Some of the ideas and discussion that come out of
Hoover occasionally have a direct influence on current
policy-making," said Raisian.
"We're in the game for the long run, and we're just
trying to have fundamental ideas that relate to policy
judgments in society out there," said Raisian. "This is
another vehicle in trying to accomplish that."
