# Stanford medical students to showcase their 'other side'
## Talent benefit set for Sunday 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
Stanford medical students will have a chance to
show their skills outside the operating room when
they take the stage in a benefit talent show to raise
money for the Lucile Salter Packard Children's
Hospital health van.
"This is an opportunity for us to showcase what
else we are able to do besides being med students,"
said Sharon Dhanowa, one of the organizers of this
Sunday's show. "We are such a diverse school, and
a lot of times we don't get to showcase that talent."
Jean Tang, another benefit organizer, said the
medical school students had a talent show last
year, but it was only for the entertainment of the
students. "Now we want to do the variety show as
a benefit, do it for a good cause," said Tang.
"The show promises to a be an entertaining mix
of classical talent, humor and never before seen
feats of skill," said organizer Devon Webster.
The talent show will include a variety of acts, in
cluding a medical school fashion show, an appear

ance by Dean of the School of Medicine Eugene
Bauer and "medical humor," Dhanowa said. She
added that there will be a serious'side to the pro
gram, with peop!" , laying musical instruments,
singing and dancing.
The money raised at the event will help main
tain "Health Van 11," a mobile provider of primary
medical care to children and teenagers in histori
cally underserved communities. It has been oper
ating for six months.
The van travels to five communities on the
Peninsula — Menlo Park, Palo Alto, East Palo
Alto, Mountain View and Redwood City.
"I hope people come, they'll have a great time
and help raise money for a good cause," said
Dhanowa.
Tang said jokingly that undergraduate pre-med
ical students are required to attend the benefit. "I
strongly suggest they attend the events — it is nec
essary for them to learn about the quality of appli
cants to Stanford's Medical School."
They hope to raise more than $1,000 from the
event.
