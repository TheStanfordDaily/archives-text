political import. Its goes like this. . . "

Recently, I discovered the truth about cats
and dogs. I'd like to share the experience
with you because I believe it can tell us
much about the human condition. Besides, I
promised my dog I'd write something about
her, and after I forgot her birthday ( again >, it's
the least I can do.
Before 1 describe the encounter that perma
nently altered my perspective and which has
implications galore for the harmony of human
kind, let me describe my pre-epiphany persona.
For me, it was always iPerms, si! and iGatos,
no! "Duke" and "Rusty were fine, but I'd
cringe at names like "Fluffy and "Mr. Mit
tens." And if asked for qualities I admired, I'd
pick "loyal" over "nocturnal" any day.
The Americans have a term for it: I was a
"dog person."
Cats are lame, I thought. Cats are up all
night. They sleep all day. They generally dislike
people. They poop in a box. Who wants that for
a pet, for a companion? This is nothing on
which to base a symbiotic relationship.
Dogs, on the other hand, are an entirely dif
ferent story. My family's had our dog. Maggie,
for almost 14 years now. and, truth be told, I
love her like a sister. Sometimes, people who
don't know that I'm an only child ask if 1 have
any brothers or sisters, and sometimes I answer
them by saying, "Well, I have a dog
When I was younger, I remember Maggie
going most places with us. Many times, she was
a source of sibling rivalry. However, many
times — to abuse my one cliche for the day —
she was also "my best friend."
Now. perhaps you think me a bit strange, or

my family even pathological, for treating our
dog as such an equal. Ah, but you are overlook
ing one important fact.
My dog. Maggie, is a person.
()kav, sure, she's not human, but she's a per
son nonetheless. And nothing you can say can
convince me otherwise.
She sleeps in bed. She watches TV. She gets
mail addressed to her from her vet. She main
tains strong opinions. She won't accept a bagel
without lox or a cracker without cheese. When
I was younger, she dictated letters to me at
summer camp. She even comes to greet people
at the airport on occasion although now she
waits outside the gate (she can no longer pass
through the metal detector ever since she was
hit by a car and the vet put steel plates in her
butt). If she could write poetry, she would.
All of this, combined with the fact that she
has more personality than many people I know,
leads me to believe that she is a person. Per
sonally. I see nothing wrong with such a belief,
and Ill bet lots of bepetted people can see where
I'm coming from (Ans: Overland Park, Kansas,
pop. 111,171). Yes, dogs are cool.
But cats? Feh. That's how I feblt before I
met Snapple,
Snapple was a small splotchy gray kitten
that moved in with my neighbor for a couple of
weeks last month. No big deal really. My neigh
bor acquired her they way Stanfordites do most
of their business: over the Internet. Apparently,
answering an ad over su.market is all it takes to
find the feline of your wildest fantasies.
My neighbor named the cat Snapple because
and this is a direct quote here — "well, she
likes Snapple." (By that logic, my parents
should've named me "Mint Chocolate Chip.")
It was a while before Snapple was allowed to
venture alone around the house, and when she
did, we didn't exactlv get along. Our relation

ship consisted mostly of me chasing her out
from under my desk at 2 a.m.. or out of my sock
drawer at 3 a.m.
Then one night I was up late working in the
cluster. So late that I was the only one awake
in tin* house. Or so I thought. Shortly before
sunrise, Snapple came flouncing in with a
flourish (for a cat, she had no stealth). At first,
I thought she was just there to check her e
mail, hut I soon realized she'd come to see me.
As I typed away, she sat quietly. Neither of us
said much. Hut all the same, it was nice not to
he alone.
Eventually, the day came when it was time
for Snapple to move on. My neighbor gave her
away to a friend where she would have other
cats her own age to play with. And while 1
didn't exactly lose sleep over it. I found myself
missing Snapple just the wee-est of bits. After
all, she had personality. She had conviction. As
her name indicates, she was picky. Like me.
Now, Snapple's no Maggie, and according
to the DSM-IV, I'm probably still a dog per
son. But I learned an important lesson from
my brief but intense affair with Snapple the
Kitty Put simply, I realized that cats are peo
ple, too.
And if a harsh and hardened cat detractor
like myself can learn to see the ignorance and
arrogance of his ways, then little aspirations
like peace on earth and good will towards men
(and women) can't be too far out of reach.
