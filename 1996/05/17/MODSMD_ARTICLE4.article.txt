# Presidential ticket has five-point plan
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
The ASSU is ready for some new
faces for its new president / vice pres
ident duo, according to one of the
three tickets contending for the
ASSU's executive leadership.
Senior Sam Ockman and junior
Mike Mitchell say they are rising to a
historic occasion by giving outsiders
the chance to bring a broad, less
politicized perspective on running
Stanford's student government.
Presidential candidate Ockman
— a computer systems engineering
and political science major who will

be finishing his degrees next year —
said his diverse experiences as associ
ate editor of The Thinker, financial
manager of the Jewish Student Asso
ciation, Ram's Head actor and execu
tive publicity director of Stanford's
Moderate Majority has given him
solid leadership skills he will use as
chief executive of the ASSU.
Running mate Mike Mitchell —
the Stanford football team's second
leading rusher, who studies African
and Afro-American Studies and tu
tors in East Palo Alto — said he sees
the vice presidency, in part, as an op
portunity to give student athletes
better representation in student gov
ernment.
Central to Ockman's and
Mitchell's game plan is a five-point
set of goals. First on the agenda is
making Tresidder Union a "real stu
dent union," Ockman said, explain
ing their intention to replace several
offices currently housed in Tresid
der with offices for student organi
zations. Ockman and Mitchell also
will try to negotiate a way for stu
dents to use meal plans at Tresidder
eateries.
The second part of their plan is to
create a special endowment to allo
cate long-term funding for student
organizations that have received spe
cial fees for a number of years.
"This would not replace special
fees," Ockman said. It would be an
addition to the existing funding op
portunities available to student orga
nizations.
"The one-year planning is too fo
cused on the short term," Ockman
said, adding that he and Mitchell
plan to pilot an ASSU fund-raising
effort to target donors who have his
toric; illy supported student organi
zations.
Their third goal is called Food
Freedom, and would convert half of
the Universitv-run dorm-based din

ing halls into privately managed
firms in order to "create a system of
competition in which prices would be
lowered and quality increased," Ock
man said, adding that dining halls
would remain in the dorms "in most
cases."
Also, under Ockman's and
Mitchell's privatization plan, juniors
and seniors would lx? able to opt out
of the meal plan requirement, anoth
er change they say would likely cre
ate greater incentives for competi
tion among dining companies.
A fourth goal is to improve cam
pus safety, adding more lighted
paths, extending SURE escort hours
and encouraging the University ad
ministration to remain committed to
safety additions like the recent in
stallation of campus emergency
phones.
For the last part of their plan —
ensuring the fairness of the Uni
versity Committee of 15's evalua
tion of the process by which Stan
ford's Honor Code is enforced —
Ockman and Mitchell said as soon
as the committee's report is re
leased they will come out in strong
support of students' rights, aiding
its implementation if they support
it or suggesting improvements if
they do not.
Ockman added that staying in
touch with the students the ASSU
elects to serve on University commit
tees is another way they hope to im
prove the effectiveness of the ASSU's
advocacy for student interests.
