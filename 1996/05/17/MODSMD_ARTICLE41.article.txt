# Blind judge defies stereotypes of disabled
## 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
Judge Dana LaMon, blind since
the age of 4, started off last night's
speech to a Meyer Library crowd
of 70 explaining how he learned to
drive a car.
"To drive, you use your hands,
your feet and your brain," LaMon
said. "It is true that you must also
use your eyes. I figured you would
have to find things to substitute: a
daring navigator and an idiot to let

me use his car. I found both in one
person, and I learned to drive."
LaMon's often humorous
speech, titled "Parallels Between
the Disability Rights Movement
and the Civil Rights Movement of
the 19605," was sponsored by the
Disabled Students at Stanford and
the Black Community Services
Center.
The California Administrative
Law judge said that both the dis
ability rights movement and the
civil rights movement, as well as

all other equal rights movements,
face three enemies: prejudice, dis
crimination and bigotry.
He used the fact that people de
cided that he could not drive on
the basis that he was blind as an
example of prejudice.
"Prejudice is the making of
judgment before having the
facts," he said.
LaMon went on to define dis
crimination as "an action taken
against someone based on preju
dice." He called bigotry "the worst
of the three enepues."
"Bigotry is discrimination cou
pled with hatred or ill will," he
said. "A bigot is a person aware
that his belief is unfounded, but he
takes action willingly."
He said a fourth enemy is cur
rently manifesting itself: insensi
tivity.
"We're moving into an age in
our society where 'me' becomes
more important than anybody
else. My present feeling is the anti
affirmative action attitude perme
ating our political arenas now is
based on insensitivity."
LaMon added that he fears the
Americans with Disabilities Act
will be the next victim of insensi
tivity.
"I submit, given another 10
years, and pretty soon you'll find
this policy and that policy slowly
eroding away," he said. "They will
say that it is budget-initiated, that
businesses can't afford to spend
the money. I submit to you that it
will not be that obvious."
He said to battle these four ene
mies, people must take action for
or against five qualities which to
gether form the acronym "ideal":
ignorance, diversity, excuses, atti
tude and love.
"Ignorance must be eliminat
ed," he said. "If we start out with
ourselves, then that is a good
start."
Second, he said people must ac
cept and love diversity.
"Diversity has to be appreciat
ed," LaMon stated. "This is a
world created by a creator who ap
preciated diversity; nothing is the
same."
Third, LaMon stressed that ex
cuses cannot be accepted.
"Excuses must be avoided. We
tend to make all types of excuses.
We have to eliminate the same ex
cuses we make about ourselves.
"When Harvard rejected me, I
could not assume that they turned

me down because I am black or be
cause I am blind," said the Yale
graduate. "Harvard rejects lots of
people. When you give yourself ex
cuses, then you give yourself an
excuse to quit."

'Attitudes must
change if the
world is going to
be ideal. You
cannot depend
on a court
judgment or a
congressperson
to change things,
to eliminate
discrimination."
— Dana LaMon

Fourth, he said the right atti
tude is key.
"Attitudes must change if the
world is going to be ideal. You can
not depend on a court judgment or
a congressperson to change
things, to eliminate discrimina
tion."
Finally, he emphasized that
people need to love.
"Love in the sense that I am
talking about is not necessarily ro
mance but caring for an individ
ual, showing compassion for an in
dividual in need. With love, people
would not have to worry about big
otry."
LaMon concluded by saying
that Stanford is a great place to
take these necessary steps.
" I am happy to be speaking here
at Stanford, where people are here
to expand their minds and their
understanding," he said. "I know
that here there is a great emphasis
on multiculturalism; that is great.
With all the diversity, from each
other, we could learn. Then, we
must take that same message out
into the world."
