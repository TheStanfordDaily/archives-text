### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
The School of Humanities and Sciences could
finalize a proposal for the new Program in Com
parative Studies in Race and Ethnicity as early as
next month, the school's dean said yesterday.
In addition, Dean of Humanities and Sciences
John Shoven announced that the first of two
promised faculty billets to aid CSRE has been
filled.
The specific requirements to major and minor
in CSRE will not be made public until, at the ear

liest, fall quarter, Shoven said. However, a pro
posal submitted to the Humanities and Sciences
curriculum committee "was favorably received,"
he said, although the CSRE steering committee
was asked to make revisions.
"It was thought that various elements within
[the proposall could be designed in more harmo
nious ways," he said.
The CSRE steering committee, chaired by
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo, will submit a new
proposal June 3. Both a major and minor in Na
tive American Studies are included in the pro
posal, Shoven said.

Once Humanities and Sciences approves the
proposal, it must still be approved by the facul
ty's Committee on Undergraduate Studies and
the entire Faculty Senate.
Humanities and Sciences was too rushed to
keep to the CSRE committee's original deadline
of beginning the program this fall, Shoven said.
"The timeline was such that you couldn't
have a typo in your report to make it,"he said.
Shoven, who pledged to hire faculty members
specializing in Asian American Studies and Chi-
cano Studies, announced comple
tion of the first half of his bargain
yesterday.
Carolyn Wong, a doctoral stu
dent at UCLA, was chosen by the
Political Science Department and
formally signed on last week,
Shoven said.
Wong, who this year is a re
search fellow at the Brookings In
stitution in Washington D.C., will
teach courses in Asian American
Studies when she begins work at
Stanford in January. Full promo
tion to assistant professor is contin
gent on completion of her doctoral
work, which will occur prior to her
arrival at Stanford, Shoven said.
"She will contribute greatly to
both the Political Science Depart
ment and the Program in Compar
ative Studies in Race and Ethnici
ty," said Assoc. Political Science
Prof. Luis Fraga, who headed the
search committee that chose Wong.
The committee's charge was to find
a faculty member in either Asian
American Studies or Chicano Stud
ies, Shoven said.
Wong, who specializes in immi
gration policy, is interested in com
parative Asian and Latino ethnic
politics in the United States. Her
doctoral thesis searches for the
source of changes in U.S. immigra
tion policy since World War 11.
Final approval of her appoint
ment is contingent on the support
of the Advisory Board of the Acade
mic Council, Provost Condoleezza
Rice and the Board of Trustees.
"I am very excited about the
prospects of coming to Stanford,"
Wong said yesterday. "But there's
still another step toward approval."
In addition to the Brookings fel
lowship, Wong has received fellow
ships from UCLA and the Xerox
Corporation.
Shoven said that Wong will
teach two courses in Asian Ameri
can Studies through the Political
Science Department next year,
both of which will apply to the
CSRE curriculum.
"This is the crucial [appoint
ment]." Shoven said. "The faculty
strength in Asian American Stud
ies is well behind the faculty
strength in Chicano Studies."
A search will begin this fall for a
Chxano Studies scholar. The Soci
okagy, .Anthropology and Political
Soenoe Departments are interested

in acquiring the billet, Shoven said.
Wong received her bachelor's
degree in American history from
the City College of New York and a
master's degree in technology poli
cy from MIT.
"She has a combination of re
search and teaching interests that
will overlap and expand those of
current faculty," said Political
Science Prof. Lucius Barker, who
chairs the department. "I think
that she will give Stanford a real
presence in this rapidly develop
ing area in teaching and re
search."

when the researcher chosen to (ill
the slot withdrew after a group of
concerned students voiced opposi

The controversy which sur
rounded the sociology choice, an
other Asian American Studies
scholar, appears to be absent. The
same group — the Concerned Stu
dents for Asian American Studies
— did not express concern about
Wong's background.
Shoven said Wong was cau
tioned that CSRE has yet to receive
full approval.
Wong received the backing of
the entire Political Science Depart
ment and the entire CSRE steering
committee, Barker said, adding
that full departmental support is
"hard to develop."
"We think we've got a star,"
Shoven said.
