## Men find fulfillment in study of feminism 
### Heather Knight Staff writer 
Senior David Barba and ju
nior Nathan Jones are truly get
ting a liberal education.
Both majoring in feminist
studies, these men have broken
the gender stereotype often asso
ciated with the msgor and the
feminist movement as a whole.
Barba, who declared the
major in the fall of his junior
year, found that feminist studies
combines the many disciplines
on which he wanted to concen
trate.
"During spring quarter of my
sophomore year, I was busy de
signing my own major called 'Art
and Social Theory,' " he said. "It

tions.
"Duringthefollowingsummer, I
realized I could do exactly what I
wanted through feminist studies,
bringing in not only gender theory
but also producing some of my own
representations through film, pho
tography and creative writing
courses. In the end, my proposal
was called 'Representing Gender in
Written and Visual Media.' "
"When I was in high school,
most subjects were incredibly
sealed off from other fields. I wasn't
always pushed to make interdisci
plinary connections, as I am now
through feminist studies," he said.
Jones, who is now in the process
of the declaring feminist studies,
said he was drawn to the major
partly because of its ability to incor
porate members of marginalized so
cieties. One of six children, he has a
white mother and a black father.
"We were raised as is, without
social distinction. This has left me
living in gaps or synthesized places
in the world," he said.
"This can be found in feminist

studies and feminism and can be
talked about more in this major.
The language of feminism is the one
that I'm much more likely to com
municate in."
Barba, too, said that being male
is only one small part of his identity
and that the feminist studies major
can incorporate different identities.
"I don't really know how to split
my identity and say, 'This is the man
in me speaking.' When I speak, I do
so as all of me: a 22-year-old gay Mex
ican feminist upper-middle-class
man, with no commas," he said.
Barba and Jones are not anom
alies. Esteile Freedman, the chair of
the Feminist Studies Program and
a history professor, said between
one and three men have typically
majored in the program every year
since its inception in 1980.
Freedman said all majors gain
skills in analyzing gender. She said
though some men take gender for
granted, the men who take feminist
studies classes are usually already
alert about gender issues and are
"willing to work at a major that's
different."
She has received comments
from men taking the classes that it
is a "privilege to see the world as an
other groups sees it and to learn

that other perspective."
Both men have found the femi
nist studies major classes interest
ing and, for the most part, welcom
ing to men.
"I like the classes. I'm finding
that the spirit in the classes is really
interesting. I have a lot of those mo
ments where I'll say, 'Oh, I've
thought of that, and here is some
one else saying it,' " said Jones.
Jones added that he hasn't no
ticed professors treating him differ
ently than they treat the women in
the classes.
"I think they've been pleased to
have me along."
"I have never noticed any dif
ferent treatment," Barba agreed.
"Actually, once, on the first day of
class I noticed a professor's sur
prised look since everyone else was
a woman, but after that, it was
fine."
Learning this other perspective
can be difficult, though, Jones said.
"Sometimes I feel guilty in terms
of feeling responsible or connected
to people who are responsible for
the oppression [of women]," he
said. "It's being part of the energy
and then not always being wel
come."
Barba said he has generally felt

comfortable and accepted in the
mostly female classes.
"I don't usually notice the class
make-up after the first meeting and
I am reluctant to draw any essen
tialist arguments about women
only classes, except to say that I
hope they provide safer environ
ments for women students to feel
like ihey can and should participate
fully," he said.
Jones said his favorite classes in
the major have included Karen
Kegell's "Media Theories" and
Sharon Holland's "U.S. and Second
Wave Feminism," in which Holland
was "extra ambitious and thor
ough."
Barba said he has particularly
enjoyed the three smaller graduate
seminar classes he has taken.
"The best material for me has
been that which sees race, class and
sexual orientation as intrinsic parts
of any feminist analysis — which by
definition centers on the sex-gender
construct," Barba said.
"One cannot analyze gender in a
vacuum, disregarding other sys
tems which shape and often deter
mine it,"he added.
Both Barba and Jones have met
with mixed reactions from family
and friends about their unique

major choice.
"My mother said she was
shocked at her own prejudice,"
Barba said. "If one of her daughters
had said she was going to be a femi
nist studies major, she would have
been very supportive, but her son!
That was her initial reaction. Now
she thinks it's great.
"I had to explain the notion of
gender to my father first and then
feminism," Barba continued. "But I
think he got it, and he understands
the value of interdisciplinary ap
proaches. Nevertheless, both my
parents still worry what kind of job I
will get with my major."
"My dad kind of resolved it in his
mind that I'm just a weird child,"
said Jones. "He's just like 'whatev
er' as long as I have a major."
Barba said most of his friends are
gay, as well as humanities and social
science majors, "so they can relate
on some level."
Jones also said his friends have
thought the major choice fits him,
but as a resident assistant in Flo Mo,
his dorm thinks the choice is funny.
"They take amusement from it."
For long term plans, Jones plans
to get a doctorate and then become a
professor in English, feminist stud
ies, or a related field.

Barba plans to follow a more po
litical path.
"I think that anything feminist is
usually also something political.
Therefore, I see myself taking polit
ical action with any field I choose to
follow — be it writing, law, teaching,
etc.," he said.
Both Barba and Jones said they
have learned about women from
taking the classes and think the
world could benefit from more men
studying feminism.
"(I've learned] that one cannot
speak of 'woman' in singular since
race, class, sexual orientation make
every woman different from anoth
er," Barba said.
"Maybe if more men were femi
nist studies majors we wouldn't be
so fucked up in terms of gender dis
crimination, sexual harassment and
domestic violence," Barba added.
Jones said he would also recom
mend the major to men.
"I would recommend a lot of its
tenets to everyone. It addresses the
world without attempting to own it,
the way the sciences go about study
ing the world.
"There have been far more in
stances where I've felt at home than
felt like I was intruding in someone
else's home."

Though he's one of only two male Feminist Studies majors, senior David Barba says he has never been
treated any differently from his female colleagues.
tions.
"Duringthefollowingsummer, I
realized I could do exactly what I
wanted through feminist studies,
bringing in not only gender theory
but also producing some of my own
representations through film, pho
tography and creative writing
courses. In the end, my proposal
was called 'Representing Gender in
Written and Visual Media.' "
"When I was in high school,
most subjects were incredibly
sealed off from other fields. I wasn't
always pushed to make interdisci
plinary connections, as I am now
through feminist studies," he said.
Jones, who is now in the process
of the declaring feminist studies,
said he was drawn to the major
partly because of its ability to incor
porate members of marginalized so
cieties. One of six children, he has a
white mother and a black father.
"We were raised as is, without
social distinction. This has left me
living in gaps or synthesized places
in the world," he said.
"This can be found in feminist

studies and feminism and can be
talked about more in this major.
The language of feminism is the one
that I'm much more likely to com
municate in."
Barba, too, said that being male
is only one small part of his identity
and that the feminist studies major
can incorporate different identities.
"I don't really know how to split
my identity and say, 'This is the man
in me speaking.' When I speak, I do
so as all of me: a 22-year-old gay Mex
ican feminist upper-middle-class
man, with no commas," he said.
Barba and Jones are not anom
alies. Esteile Freedman, the chair of
the Feminist Studies Program and
a history professor, said between
one and three men have typically
majored in the program every year
since its inception in 1980.
Freedman said all majors gain
skills in analyzing gender. She said
though some men take gender for
granted, the men who take feminist
studies classes are usually already
alert about gender issues and are
"willing to work at a major that's
different."
She has received comments
from men taking the classes that it
is a "privilege to see the world as an
other groups sees it and to learn

that other perspective."
Both men have found the femi
nist studies major classes interest
ing and, for the most part, welcom
ing to men.
"I like the classes. I'm finding
that the spirit in the classes is really
interesting. I have a lot of those mo
ments where I'll say, 'Oh, I've
thought of that, and here is some
one else saying it,' " said Jones.
Jones added that he hasn't no
ticed professors treating him differ
ently than they treat the women in
the classes.
"I think they've been pleased to
have me along."
"I have never noticed any dif
ferent treatment," Barba agreed.
"Actually, once, on the first day of
class I noticed a professor's sur
prised look since everyone else was
a woman, but after that, it was
fine."
Learning this other perspective
can be difficult, though, Jones said.
"Sometimes I feel guilty in terms
of feeling responsible or connected
to people who are responsible for
the oppression [of women]," he
said. "It's being part of the energy
and then not always being wel
come."
Barba said he has generally felt

comfortable and accepted in the
mostly female classes.
"I don't usually notice the class
make-up after the first meeting and
I am reluctant to draw any essen
tialist arguments about women
only classes, except to say that I
hope they provide safer environ
ments for women students to feel
like ihey can and should participate
fully," he said.
Jones said his favorite classes in
the major have included Karen
Kegell's "Media Theories" and
Sharon Holland's "U.S. and Second
Wave Feminism," in which Holland
was "extra ambitious and thor
ough."
Barba said he has particularly
enjoyed the three smaller graduate
seminar classes he has taken.
"The best material for me has
been that which sees race, class and
sexual orientation as intrinsic parts
of any feminist analysis — which by
definition centers on the sex-gender
construct," Barba said.
"One cannot analyze gender in a
vacuum, disregarding other sys
tems which shape and often deter
mine it,"he added.
Both Barba and Jones have met
with mixed reactions from family
and friends about their unique

major choice.
"My mother said she was
shocked at her own prejudice,"
Barba said. "If one of her daughters
had said she was going to be a femi
nist studies major, she would have
been very supportive, but her son!
That was her initial reaction. Now
she thinks it's great.
"I had to explain the notion of
gender to my father first and then
feminism," Barba continued. "But I
think he got it, and he understands
the value of interdisciplinary ap
proaches. Nevertheless, both my
parents still worry what kind of job I
will get with my major."
"My dad kind of resolved it in his
mind that I'm just a weird child,"
said Jones. "He's just like 'whatev
er' as long as I have a major."
Barba said most of his friends are
gay, as well as humanities and social
science majors, "so they can relate
on some level."
Jones also said his friends have
thought the major choice fits him,
but as a resident assistant in Flo Mo,
his dorm thinks the choice is funny.
"They take amusement from it."
For long term plans, Jones plans
to get a doctorate and then become a
professor in English, feminist stud
ies, or a related field.

Barba plans to follow a more po
litical path.
"I think that anything feminist is
usually also something political.
Therefore, I see myself taking polit
ical action with any field I choose to
follow — be it writing, law, teaching,
etc.," he said.
Both Barba and Jones said they
have learned about women from
taking the classes and think the
world could benefit from more men
studying feminism.
"(I've learned] that one cannot
speak of 'woman' in singular since
race, class, sexual orientation make
every woman different from anoth
er," Barba said.
"Maybe if more men were femi
nist studies majors we wouldn't be
so fucked up in terms of gender dis
crimination, sexual harassment and
domestic violence," Barba added.
Jones said he would also recom
mend the major to men.
"I would recommend a lot of its
tenets to everyone. It addresses the
world without attempting to own it,
the way the sciences go about study
ing the world.
"There have been far more in
stances where I've felt at home than
felt like I was intruding in someone
else's home."
