### Dana Hangai Contributing writer 
In recognition of their past work and future in
tellectual contributions to the Stanford commu
nity, the Stanford Humanities Center announced
the appointment of 12 faculty fellows for the
1996-97 academic year.
Fellows are provided a year-long sabbatical
and living residence where they can work on re
search and interact with other scholars. The
grants are sponsored by various foundations and
individual donors. Fellows are selected by a com
mittee including fuculty from both Stanford
other universities.
Six slots are normally allocated to Stanford fac
ulty and six slots to outside faculty, according to
Fellowship Administrator Susan Sebbard. How
ever, insufficient funding allowed only four slots
this year for Stanford applicants.
Out of seven Stanford applicants, the commit
tee selected English Prof. John Felstiner, Asst.
Prof, of Slavic Languages and Literature Monika
Greenleaf, Asst. History Prof. Ellen Neskar and
History Prof. Paul Robinson.
Eight external fellowships were also award-

Ed to Assoc. English Prof. Carolyn Dinshaw,
UC-Berkeley; Assoc. History Prof. Maureen
Miller, Hamilton College; Asst. English Prof.
Amy Robinson, Georgetown University; Hu
manities Prof. Richard Rorty, University of
Virginia; English Prof. Natalie Schmitt, Uni
versity of Illinois-Chicago; Maeera Shreiber, an
independent scholar; Asst. German Prof. Bian
ca Theisen, Johns Hopkins University; and
Asian Languages Prof. John Treat, University
of Washington. Two fellows will use outside
funding to pay for their sabbatical and re
search.
The Humanities Center also selected two
Rockefeller fellows in the legal humanities:
UCLA Law Prof. Laura Gomez and Philosophy
Prof. Joseph J. Sartorelli from Arkansas State
University. These fellowships, made possible by
a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, pro
vide residence and a three-year sabbatical.
In addition to their projects, fellows are ex
pected to contribute intellectually to the Stanford
community in some form, according to Sebbard.
"Many choose to teach a course," Sebbard
said. "Others might organize a conference. Still
others might have reading seminars with gradu

ates and faculty."
Having access to Stanford's libraries and a
one-year sabbatical from teaching creates an en
vironment where researchers can focus on their
work.
"The main thing that you get is time. I'll be
able to spend the full year reading the books I
want to write about, drafting my manuscript,
thinking about it without any interruptions,"
said Robinson, who plans to write a book on gay
autobiographies written in the 20th century.
Robinson, who has previously been appointed
a faculty fellow, also praised the interaction be
tween scholars of different disciples and back
grounds.
"Besides getting a year off, you spend a good
deal of time with other scholars who are in dif
ferent disciplines and several of them from dif
ferent universities, so you receive an intellectu
al stimulation that you may not necessarily re
ceive while you're teaching in the classroom,"
Robinson said.
The Humanities Center will also select 15
graduate students as faculty fellows. The results
will be announced sometime during fall quarter.
