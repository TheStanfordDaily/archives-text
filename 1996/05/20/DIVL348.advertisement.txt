Today's birthday:
Sweetness and Starlight promises the best
year ever, if you were born on this day. All
your dreams and desires come to fruition,
with natural selection weeding out those
wishes you didn't really want to come true.
You find satisfaction in love, friendship,
employment and personal growth. By year's
end, you'll want to make every year like
1996-7, and with any luck, you'll have made
the necessary changes to find that elusive
personal peace.
