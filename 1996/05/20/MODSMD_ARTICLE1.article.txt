# Defining the place of IDPs
## Funding, faculty pressures affect status of programs

The world rarely defines itself along the same bound
aries as traditional disciplines within a university.
On the foundation of this belief, professors over the
years have joined forces to create interdisciplinary pro
grams that examine the gray areas in between. Stanford
has been one of the leaders in the effort, currently boast
ing nearly 20 such programs.
But although eveiyone agrees interdisciplinary pro
grams play an important role in the university setting,
they were designed without the ability to appoint facul
ty, making their longevity hard to maintain.
Coupled with budgetary pressures both on the Uni
versity and federal levels, interdisciplinary programs
are looking for ways to stay afloat. While few interdisci
plinary program directors are worried that their pro
grams will disappear, two Stanford programs in recent
weeks have already been forced to confront major struc
tural changes.
Without taking a hard look at the way interdiscipli
nary programs are set up and re-evaluating their con
tributions to the University, more programs may soon
face the same situation, faculty say.
Defining the world
Interdisciplinary programs were created to fill areas
of intellectual pursuit that could not be met in tradi
tional disciplines, faculty say, and as such are inherent
ly innovative and experimental.
"They provide a chance for students to learn about
areas that are not covered in the traditional depart
ments that bring together ideas from a variety of disci
plinary perspectives in interesting ways," said Linguis

Symbolic Systems Program.
Faculty and students may choose to work in inter
disciplinary programs for different reasons, but gener
