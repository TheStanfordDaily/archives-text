# Defining the place of IDPs
## Funding, faculty pressures affect status of programs 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The world rarely defines itself along the same bound
aries as traditional disciplines within a university.
On the foundation of this belief, professors over the
years have joined forces to create interdisciplinary pro
grams that examine the gray areas in between. Stanford
has been one of the leaders in the effort, currently boast
ing nearly 20 such programs.
But although eveiyone agrees interdisciplinary pro
grams play an important role in the university setting,
they were designed without the ability to appoint facul
ty, making their longevity hard to maintain.
Coupled with budgetary pressures both on the Uni
versity and federal levels, interdisciplinary programs
are looking for ways to stay afloat. While few interdisci
plinary program directors are worried that their pro
grams will disappear, two Stanford programs in recent
weeks have already been forced to confront major struc
tural changes.
Without taking a hard look at the way interdiscipli
nary programs are set up and re-evaluating their con
tributions to the University, more programs may soon
face the same situation, faculty say.
Defining the world
Interdisciplinary programs were created to fill areas
of intellectual pursuit that could not be met in tradi
tional disciplines, faculty say, and as such are inherent
ly innovative and experimental.
"They provide a chance for students to learn about
areas that are not covered in the traditional depart
ments that bring together ideas from a variety of disci
plinary perspectives in interesting ways," said Linguis
tics and Philosophy Prof. Thomas Wasow, chair of the
Symbolic Systems Program.
Faculty and students may choose to work in inter
disciplinary programs for different reasons, but gener
ally the decision comes down to how to solve the "big
problems" of the world, said Human
Biology Program Chair William
Durham, an anthropology profes
sor.
"From a faculty perspective, the
reason is to get away from the nar
row disciplinary confines when
dealing with the big issues facing
humanity today," he said. Students
"want to be prepared to go out and
work on the world's great prob
lems. ... They want the tools."
Majors such as science, technolo
gy and society provide a perfect way
to prepare, said sophomore STS
major Monikka Mann. "It truly
makes someone well-rounded," she
said. "Moving into the 21st century,
people aren't going to be able to get
by with just a technical mzyor. It's
not just all about crunching num
bers or all about reading."
Interdisciplinary programs arc
often founded because of a cultural
or society change, making them
highly experimental and far from
mainstream, professors say.
"I think that the interdiscipli
nary programs were created precise
ly for the sake of experimentation,"
said Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education Ram6n Saldr'var.
Faculty interested in creating an
interdisciplinary program often
start off very enthusiastic about es
tablishing a new way to look at a

world issue. Problems arise when
the founding faculty leave and no
one is left to give the program the
amount of support it needs.
"It's the interdisciplinary pro
grams that are often on the cutting
edge of new scholarship," said His
tory Prof. Joel Beinin, chair of the
Program in Modern Thought and
Literature. "They very often gather
together younger faculty members
who are by the nature of their ca
reers looking at things that haven't
been looked at before.
"These programs are veiy impor
tant because of the spirit of intellec
tual innovation and challenge that
they bring," he said.
Facing the challenge
Because interdisciplinary pro
grams often represent the cutting
edge of scholarship, they must
struggle to bring in research money,
to attract faculty with departmental
responsibilities and to prove their
continued importance within the
University structure.
Interdisciplinary programs cur
rently do not have the ability to ap
point faculty and are constantly in
competition for professors' time —
one of the primary problems they
face, faculty say.
"The thing that imperils the in
terdisciplinary programs most at
Stanford is the fact that they do not
have permanent faculty attached to
them," said Art Prof. Wanda Corn,
who teaches in the American Stud
ies Program.

The fact that faculty continue to
be appointed in departments in
stead of interdisciplinary programs
reinforces the point that universi
ties continue to be run along disci
plinary lines, Durham said.
"At the very least, we should see
more cooperative hirings with an ex
plicit agreement of shared effort,"
Durham said. "Far better would be
to hire people within interdiscipli
nary programs — exactly the type of
idea that wouldn't be popular in a
world controlled by department and
disciplinary funding."
Aeronautics and Astronautics
Prof. Emeritus Walter Vincenti, a
founder and two-time chair of the
Program in Science, Technology
and Society, said the ability to make
appointments would have greatly
helped theSTS program, which may
cease to offer degrees in 1998.
"That's a problem with interdis
ciplinary programs all over the Uni
versity," Vincenti said. "We're not
the only ones who struggle with
that."
As the situation currently
stands, faculty tend to remain in
their departments, especially as
funding becomes more scarce and
attaining tenure becomes more im
portant, Vincenti said.
"No non-tenured faculty in his or
her right mind is going to get into
this," he said. "There's every incen
tive for faculty today not to get into
this no matter how interested they
are."
On the federal level, too, a tight

budget situation directs money
away from innovative and interdis
ciplinary programs.
"Surely the nature of federal
funding is causing a kind of re
trenchment, a hardening of discipli
nary boundaries," Durham said.
"The disciplinary boundaries show
their strength at a time when
there's competition over diminish
ing resources.
"Departments feel they should
be funded first and interdisciplinary
programs with whatever is left."
Coming challenges
Despite recent announcements
that undergraduate majors in STS
and East Asian Studies may soon be
a thing of the past, interdisciplinary
program chairs are fairly sure that
programs will not disappear from
Stanford altogether.
"We're not concerned, except
that we're concerned always about
the vitality and health of the inter
disciplinary programs at Stanford,"
Corn said of the American Studies
Program. "We always feel vulnera
ble."
However, she added, "as long as
you have a committed faculty that
are willing to stay with the advising
functions and core teaching func
tions and as long as students are vot
ing with their feet and saying you're
doing a good job, interdisciplinary
programs are fme.... I don't think
they're troubled."
One of the major problems the
STS program faces is a lack of com

mitted tenured or tenure-line facul
ty. Since Vincenti and other
founders of the program retired, ad
ministrators have been unable to
find either a permanent program
chair or enough faculty willing to ad
vise and otherwise contribute signif
icantly to the program.
Corn suggests a more coopera
tive agreement between depart
ments and interdisciplinary pro
grams.
"My proposal would be to either
give split appointments between a
department and a program for those
people for whom it's appropriate or
to basically have contractual rela
tionships with faculty . . . that half
of a faculty members' time will be
spent in the program," she said.
The best way for programs to
survive the current budget-cutting,
disciplinary-focused atmosphere is
to "continue to offer exciting and
unparalleled opportunities to learn
for both faculty and students,"
Durham said. "You have to have fac
ulty and student interest and [ pro
ject] the overwhelming message
that this Is a legitimate and produc
tive domain of scholarly inquiry
with a product that is valued by soci
ety."
The product must be valued by
society because the world has, if any
thing, become more interdiscipli
nary, said senior Rachel Hall, an
East Asian Studies major.
"Interdisciplinary programs are
going to be the wave of the future,"
she said.

to "continue to offer exciting and
unparalleled opportunities to learn
for both faculty and students,"
Durham said. "You have to have fac
ulty and student interest and [ pro
ject] the overwhelming message
that this Is a legitimate and produc
tive domain of scholarly inquiry
with a product that is valued by soci
ety."
The product must be valued by
society because the world has, if any
thing, become more interdiscipli
nary, said senior Rachel Hall, an
East Asian Studies major.
"Interdisciplinary programs are
going to be the wave of the future,"
she said.
The world rarely defines itself along the same bound
aries as traditional disciplines within a university.
On the foundation of this belief, professors over the
years have joined forces to create interdisciplinary pro
grams that examine the gray areas in between. Stanford
has been one of the leaders in the effort, currently boast
ing nearly 20 such programs.
But although eveiyone agrees interdisciplinary pro
grams play an important role in the university setting,
they were designed without the ability to appoint facul
ty, making their longevity hard to maintain.
Coupled with budgetary pressures both on the Uni
versity and federal levels, interdisciplinary programs
are looking for ways to stay afloat. While few interdisci
plinary program directors are worried that their pro
grams will disappear, two Stanford programs in recent
weeks have already been forced to confront major struc
tural changes.
Without taking a hard look at the way interdiscipli
nary programs are set up and re-evaluating their con
tributions to the University, more programs may soon
face the same situation, faculty say.
Defining the world
Interdisciplinary programs were created to fill areas
of intellectual pursuit that could not be met in tradi
tional disciplines, faculty say, and as such are inherent
ly innovative and experimental.
"They provide a chance for students to learn about
areas that are not covered in the traditional depart
ments that bring together ideas from a variety of disci
plinary perspectives in interesting ways," said Linguis
tics and Philosophy Prof. Thomas Wasow, chair of the
Symbolic Systems Program.
Faculty and students may choose to work in inter
disciplinary programs for different reasons, but gener
ally the decision comes down to how to solve the "big
problems" of the world, said Human
Biology Program Chair William
Durham, an anthropology profes
sor.
"From a faculty perspective, the
reason is to get away from the nar
row disciplinary confines when
dealing with the big issues facing
humanity today," he said. Students
"want to be prepared to go out and
work on the world's great prob
lems. ... They want the tools."
Majors such as science, technolo
gy and society provide a perfect way
to prepare, said sophomore STS
major Monikka Mann. "It truly
makes someone well-rounded," she
said. "Moving into the 21st century,
people aren't going to be able to get
by with just a technical mzyor. It's
not just all about crunching num
bers or all about reading."
Interdisciplinary programs arc
often founded because of a cultural
or society change, making them
highly experimental and far from
mainstream, professors say.
"I think that the interdiscipli
nary programs were created precise
ly for the sake of experimentation,"
said Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education Ram6n Saldr'var.
Faculty interested in creating an
interdisciplinary program often
start off very enthusiastic about es
tablishing a new way to look at a

world issue. Problems arise when
the founding faculty leave and no
one is left to give the program the
amount of support it needs.
"It's the interdisciplinary pro
grams that are often on the cutting
edge of new scholarship," said His
tory Prof. Joel Beinin, chair of the
Program in Modern Thought and
Literature. "They very often gather
together younger faculty members
who are by the nature of their ca
reers looking at things that haven't
been looked at before.
"These programs are veiy impor
tant because of the spirit of intellec
tual innovation and challenge that
they bring," he said.
Facing the challenge
Because interdisciplinary pro
grams often represent the cutting
edge of scholarship, they must
struggle to bring in research money,
to attract faculty with departmental
responsibilities and to prove their
continued importance within the
University structure.
Interdisciplinary programs cur
rently do not have the ability to ap
point faculty and are constantly in
competition for professors' time —
one of the primary problems they
face, faculty say.
"The thing that imperils the in
terdisciplinary programs most at
Stanford is the fact that they do not
have permanent faculty attached to
them," said Art Prof. Wanda Corn,
who teaches in the American Stud
ies Program.

The fact that faculty continue to
be appointed in departments in
stead of interdisciplinary programs
reinforces the point that universi
ties continue to be run along disci
plinary lines, Durham said.
"At the very least, we should see
more cooperative hirings with an ex
plicit agreement of shared effort,"
Durham said. "Far better would be
to hire people within interdiscipli
nary programs — exactly the type of
idea that wouldn't be popular in a
world controlled by department and
disciplinary funding."
Aeronautics and Astronautics
Prof. Emeritus Walter Vincenti, a
founder and two-time chair of the
Program in Science, Technology
and Society, said the ability to make
appointments would have greatly
helped theSTS program, which may
cease to offer degrees in 1998.
"That's a problem with interdis
ciplinary programs all over the Uni
versity," Vincenti said. "We're not
the only ones who struggle with
that."
As the situation currently
stands, faculty tend to remain in
their departments, especially as
funding becomes more scarce and
attaining tenure becomes more im
portant, Vincenti said.
"No non-tenured faculty in his or
her right mind is going to get into
this," he said. "There's every incen
tive for faculty today not to get into
this no matter how interested they
are."
On the federal level, too, a tight

budget situation directs money
away from innovative and interdis
ciplinary programs.
"Surely the nature of federal
funding is causing a kind of re
trenchment, a hardening of discipli
nary boundaries," Durham said.
"The disciplinary boundaries show
their strength at a time when
there's competition over diminish
ing resources.
"Departments feel they should
be funded first and interdisciplinary
programs with whatever is left."
Coming challenges
Despite recent announcements
that undergraduate majors in STS
and East Asian Studies may soon be
a thing of the past, interdisciplinary
program chairs are fairly sure that
programs will not disappear from
Stanford altogether.
"We're not concerned, except
that we're concerned always about
the vitality and health of the inter
disciplinary programs at Stanford,"
Corn said of the American Studies
Program. "We always feel vulnera
ble."
However, she added, "as long as
you have a committed faculty that
are willing to stay with the advising
functions and core teaching func
tions and as long as students are vot
ing with their feet and saying you're
doing a good job, interdisciplinary
programs are fme.... I don't think
they're troubled."
One of the major problems the
STS program faces is a lack of com

mitted tenured or tenure-line facul
ty. Since Vincenti and other
founders of the program retired, ad
ministrators have been unable to
find either a permanent program
chair or enough faculty willing to ad
vise and otherwise contribute signif
icantly to the program.
Corn suggests a more coopera
tive agreement between depart
ments and interdisciplinary pro
grams.
"My proposal would be to either
give split appointments between a
department and a program for those
people for whom it's appropriate or
to basically have contractual rela
tionships with faculty . . . that half
of a faculty members' time will be
spent in the program," she said.
The best way for programs to
survive the current budget-cutting,
disciplinary-focused atmosphere is
to "continue to offer exciting and
unparalleled opportunities to learn
for both faculty and students,"
Durham said. "You have to have fac
ulty and student interest and [ pro
ject] the overwhelming message
that this Is a legitimate and produc
tive domain of scholarly inquiry
with a product that is valued by soci
ety."
The product must be valued by
society because the world has, if any
thing, become more interdiscipli
nary, said senior Rachel Hall, an
East Asian Studies major.
"Interdisciplinary programs are
going to be the wave of the future,"
she said.
