Gel appears to stop AIDS virus
BOSTON (AP) — A powerful virus-stopping gel intended to stop the sexual
spread of AIDS to women appears to he highly effective in the first testing on
monkeys, according to a preliminary study.
The substance, called PMPA, totally stopped transmission of SIV, the monkey
version of the AIDS virus, when applied protectively to the animals' vaginas.
"We don't know how this will translate to human beings, but we see the
results as very promising and worth pursuing," said Dr. Roberta Black of the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which financed the study.
If it works as researchers hope, the gel could be applied vaginally by women
before intercourse — or perhaps even afterward — to protect them from the
AIDS virus.
Finding a vaginal anti-AIDS compound is an important research goal for use
in circumstances when condoms are not available or not wanted, said Dr. Zeda
Rosenberg of the national allergy institute.
"For women to have a woman-controlled method is very important so they can
protect themselves," she said.
The animal research suggests PMPA may be twice as effective as the spermi
cide nonoxvnol-9, which also kills HIV.
