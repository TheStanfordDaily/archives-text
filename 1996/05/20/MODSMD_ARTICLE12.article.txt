— Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
faced down intense pressure from Western
officials to resign yesterday, deftly shifting
some duties to an extremist ally in a bid to
stay in power.
International officials were pressing for
a letter of resignation, but their hopes to
have one by the end of the day were dashed
as Bosnian Serb officials denied earlier
reports that their leader planned to quit.
Verbal guarantees that Karadzic was
on his way out were given to Carl Bildt, the
top civilian official in Bosnia in a meeting
that ended just before dawn yesterday,
said an official in Bildt's office.
"That was not enough for us," the offi
cial said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. "We want total removal of
Karadzic."

Karadzic, who led the Bosnian Serbs
through 3 1/2 years of war, has been
indicted for war crimes. International oil 1-
cials refuse to meet with him, and regard
him as one of the main impediments to
implement ing the Dayton peace accord.
The pressure on Karadzic intensified
this week after he sacked his prime minis
ter, who wanted to cooperate with, rather
than confront, the international commu
nity.
Karadzic engineered the replacement of
that rival, Rajko Kasagic, in an assembly
Saturday, emphasizing the grip he still has
on Bosnian Serb territory. Later, he hand
ed over his power to deal with the interna
tional community to an extreme national
ist, Biljana Plavsic.
The two moves aim to keep the Bosnian
Serbs united against most of the Dayton

peace accord while taking some of the heat
for that policy off Karadzic himself.
Plavsic, and another senior Karadzic
loyalist, Momcilo Krajisnik, who met with
Bildt early yesterday, both said there were
no plans for Karadzic to quit.
"It's not 50... he's the president of our
republic," Plavsic said.
Bildt still expressed optimism that, one
way or the other, Karadzic was on his way
out. "The details will be played out in the
next few days," he said before leaving for a
meeting with NATO officials in Athens.
The defiance of the Serb prime minister
and his supporters in Banja Luka, the
largest Serb-held city in Bosnia, threat
ened to split Bosnian Serb territory in two
— an eastern part controlled by Karadzic,
and northwest Bosnia controlled by more
moderate Serbs.
