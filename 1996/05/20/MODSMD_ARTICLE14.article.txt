Bratman must be more
concerned with student
views than was Mahood

Philosophy prof. Michael
Bratman was recently chosen
to be next year's Faculty Sen
ate chair. He will replace Geological
and Environmental Sciences Prof.
Gail Mahood, who currently heads
that body.
The end of Mahood's reign cannot
come too soon, and students can rest
assured that it will be nearly impos
sible for Bratman to have viewpoints
more contrary to their interests than
those of his predecessor.
Mahood catapulted into the lime
light in 1994 when she chaired the
committee which created Stanford's
new grading policy. The move got
great press, including laudatory edi
torials in both The New York Times
and The Washington Post — The
Post even complimented Mahood by
name — but provoked the ire of the
vast majority of Stanford students.
In the eyes of many, Mahood and her
tireless public relations campaign
were single-handedly responsible for
the current policy, which forces
dance students who break their feet
at inconvenient times to receive
allegedly non-punitive W grades.
In fact, Mahood's PR campaign at
the time — the goal of which was to
convince the world that Stanford
students were on their way straight
to hell in a handbasket without her
heaven-sent new grading policy —
worked marvelously. Witness the
lead of a New York Times story from
May 31, 1995:
"With final examinations immi
nent, students at Stanford Universi
ty are not as nervous as one might
expect. The grade F does not exist
here. The C is fast becoming extinct.
If a B looms, a student can parachute
out of a course on the day of the final
exam with no consequences."
Having saved the University from
certain death as all its students

"parachuted" away, Mahood last
September ascended to the throne of
the Faculty Senate, a post from
which she further advanced her con
temptuous view of the student body.
In early April the senate was pre
sented with a draft charge for its new
Planning and Policy Board — a body
which makes long-term strategic
plans for the University — which
contained a provision to include two
students on the panel. However, dur
ing the meeting at which that pro
posal was considered, the senators
voted to remove student representa
tion from the board with, not at all
surprisingly, Mahood casting the
deciding vote against the inclusion of
student voices.
When the ASSU Senate p;issed a
resolution requesting that the Facul
ty Senate to reconsider its decision, it
once again came as little surprise
that Mahood's response was nega
tive. A woman who believes that stu
dents are too incompetent to be
allowed freedom in their academic
choices will never allow them on an
important University committee.
But what was surprisingly galling,
even considering the source, was
Mahood's assertion that the ASSU
Senate had overstepped its bounds
by asking the Faculty Senate to
reconsider its decision. Her response
to the ASSU essentially said that the
student body, through its elected
leaders, has no right to object to Fac
ulty Senate decisions and ask that
they be changed.
In some ways, even that position
is not surprising. After all, Mahood
would quite clearly prefer Stanford
students to sit down, shut up and
alwiiya do as sine says.
As he begins his tenure as senate
chair, Bratman must always remem
ber to consider student viewpoints
and concerns in running the Faculty
Senate; decisions made by that body
profoundly affect students' academic
lives. And as Mahood reworks her
resume to reflect the time she spent
in such a lofty seat, we're sure she
will include on that "historical
record" the fact that, at least in the
eyes of the student body, her perfor
mance deserves an Nl?
