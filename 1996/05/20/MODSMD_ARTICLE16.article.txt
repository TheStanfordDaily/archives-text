## There's no honor in Code 
### 
IT WAS AN honest mistake, really.
Saturday night, nothing on TV — lit
tle else to do except plant my butt in
a chair and procrastinate. As I leafed
through a pile of old midterms, my eyes
moved to the cover of one of the blue
books, to the section titled, "The Stan
ford University Honor Code."
The whole bit took only five minutes
to read, yet I had never found the time to
peruse it before. If you had asked, I could
have reeled off a semi-respectable plot
summary in just a few seconds: "Stu
dents agree not to collaborate with oth
ers, and, in return, professors promise to
leave the room during exams. Blah, blah,
blah." Easy. It wouldn't have taken a bit
of thought.
Still, it bothered me. Three years at
Stanford, dozens of finals, countless
midterms — literally hundreds of times
I've signed my name to the statement "I
acknowledge and accept the Honor
Code," and not once had I actually read
the damn thing. I suspect that this is
true for most of us; we simply skip the
small print, as if it were the legal mum
ble-jumble on a car lease or a student
loan. Other than a cursory once-over,
there seems no need to try and decipher
the ambiguity of the Code's many sec
tions. The details are there; if we discov
er that we need them, we know where to
look. Otherwise, the protocol is simple:
don't cheat — or, more specifically, don't
get caught.

Surveys have revealed that the over
whelming majority of Stanford students
favor the Honor Code and believe it to be
a positive influence. It creates an atmo
sphere of trust, they say, that is benefi
cial to the learning environment. This
spin-doctored answer sounds good to all
parties involved, because it upholds the
character of both the administration and
the student body. Yet, how many of us
legitimately have the moral foundation
to practice what we preach? Certainly
there are a few, though there are just as
many who do not. "Intro to Accounting"
taught me this. For this latter group,
unproctored exams, take-home finals
and a general lack of supervision created
an environment that allowed students to
use any means necessary in their drive to
succeed. Indeed, the entire spirit of the
Honor Code is antithetical to the "do
anything to stay ahead" philosophy
entrenched in today's corporate world —
the world in which many of our parents
thrive, and in which many of us hope to
soon make a living.
At its most basic level, the Honor
Code calls for students to bring their
peers to justice, to make an incident of
cheating known to the school's judicial
board so that it can be investigated and
reported on. Unfortunately, this safety
measure is anachronistic. Perhaps we
are simply apathetic, or perhaps we are
unwilling to "tattle" on another student,
knowing that he or she might feel the

heavy-handed wrath of the judicial board
— perhaps these things explain why the
process does not work as it should.
Or, perhaps the Honor Code has little
moral relevance to us anymore. This
seems more likely. We only associate it as
a means to an end — as the basis for
legitimizing our punishment if we are
caught cheating. In essence, we no
longer recognize the idealistic spirit of
the Honor Code, just its utilitarian
value. There is no longer a reason to
uphold this spirit simply for its own
sake.
In recent months, the Honor Code has
received significant attention from the
press and the administration. A "Com
mittee of 15" has been established to
determine what role the code should play
in the future of Stanford University.
When taking on this challenge, the group
must somehow recognize that few stu
dents truly understand what it means to
"acknowledge and accept" this ethical
standard. Our understanding of the
Honor Code must go beyond its most
basic definition; instead, somehow it
must become an element of a larger
value system. Only then will it be effec
tive.

Ryan Craig would never, ever violate the
Honor Code.
