Former Med Center PR director reflects on image

MY FAVORITE DIVERSION over
the years has been to compare
Stanford with the crusty-with
iradition universities on the other side
of the American continent. I learned
from these observations that tranquillity
is not a characteristic of Stanford, but a
distinction of poor universities composed
of craven men and women.
Bad universities, John Kenneth Gal
braith observed, are as silent as the
desert where the only events that make
news are only a friendly drinking bout at
a fraternity or pulling up the posts at a
football game. No one is ever put off by
that kind of wholesome exuberance, and
the trustees are happy to have it that
way. That brings me to The Daily's
recent article which asked "Is image
everything?" And does it help a universi
ty to have a news organization that puts
the accent always on the positive?
The job of any campus news organiza
tion is one of dealing with facts. To the
extent that a news service meets this
test, it does a good job. Realistically, in
any large institution one can't expect
that everything will go smoothly. Human
failures will occur either by carelessness,
incompetence or a combination of both,
at the nuts-and-bolts level. Campus jour
nalists, like the professors, are after
truth. This may have a trite sound, but
it's true. Their job is to get the facts, put
them down in an acceptable, easy-to-read
style and distribute them so that the
University community and its outside
supporters can be informed.
Sometimes truth so gathered and pre
sented is disagreeable to some. It makes
the papers and gets distorted. During
my active career I was concerned about
this. I always tried to find some other

newspaper or broadcast medium where
truth received better treatment. A pood
rule to remember was that campus jour
nalists should never allow themselves to
become cynical about their colleagues in
the working press to the point where
they would deliberately suppress infor
mation or compromise their copy. This
would be a disservice to the University
because integrity is what counts.
Unfortunately, chaos and confusion
about the purpose of higher education in
recent years have helped erode the bond
of trust that once existed between uni
versities and society. Research fraud,
discrepancies in dealing with indirect
costs of government-funded research,
resistance toward change and an inabili
ty to set priorities have contributed to
the problem. In response, university
presidents and trustees have turned to
public relations experts for advice on
improving the image of their institu
tions. That advice has been so misdirect
ed that our institutions of higher learn
ing, at least in terms of open intellectual
discourse, look as dead as the moon's
Sea of Tranquillity.
Two years ago there was a report con
cerning a perception among fund raisers
of the need to aggressively "market"
Stanford to the outside world. Enlarging
the circle of philanthropic support is a
good idea, but marketing is a tool of
doubtful effectiveness because the Uni
versity is not a plant in a manufacturing
sense. Teaching and research cannot be
tested by reference to output and sales,
or even be analyzed mechanically.
Alumni, donors, foundations and the
government, Jacques Barzun wrote 30
years ago, are not oriental potentates
requiring flattery by sycophants and beg

gars. His statement is applicable today.
More brochures and blueberry for this
purpose reduce the stature of the Univer
sity to that most sickening of merchan
dising. The dignity of Stanford lies in
sticking to its job and getting the freely
given help of those who say they need
and admire its workings. Stanford raised
over a billion dollars in the late '80s dur
ing its most controversial period. Contro
versies did not deter alumni and donors
from giving, and their airing may have in
fact prompted many to contribute even
more to their alma mater in trouble.
Stanford does have an "image" prob
lem, but it is outside the purview of its
communicators. It can be stated in simple
business terms: it's expensive. The prices
charged to customers haven't met the
costs of production. This situation is not
altoget her of Stanford's own making. It
was thrust upon universities by the
exploding postwar school population, by
society's growing tendency for higher (and
higher) education for everybody and the
role of the federal government in
research.
Rising costs have been reflected in
these developments, but inadequately.
Universities have been living with a for
mula for bankruptcy for years â€” raising
tuition and prices at our various costs
centers, desperately dipping into
reserves and borrowing and reaching out
to private philanthropy, alumni, busi
ness and the federal government for
more help.
In a recent speech, Kenneth H.
Keller, senior fellow for science and
technology at the Council on Foreign
Relations in New York, reviewed the
stagnation of funding for universities in
the past two decades, and said: "Society

looks at (universities) in two ways. One,
to account for how much money we've
spent, and two, to find reasons for not
giving us any more." Universities, added
the former University of Minnesota
president, must regain society's trust by
doing what they can do best, which is
providing quality education and per
forming academic research.
I have not yet seen a vigorous facul
ty debate reflected on the pages of Stan
ford's official and unofficial publications
about these vital issues, and how we
expect society to support the Stanfords
of the world. The obsession with
"image" may have dulled our senses
about what's important. And fear of air
ing important, often controversial
views, may have stifled debate that
Stanford needs to create a better public
understanding of its problems, and
assure the support it seeks and
deserves.
It was a United Nations' secretary
general who said that nobody under
stands what the UN really does unless
there is a crisis somewhere. Higher edu
cation is in a state of crisis, but you
would hardly know it by reading the bar
rage of puffery and lack of substance
emanating from the public relations
departments of our universities. Over
the years, Stanford's communications
apparatus has enjoyed national distinc
tion for its professionalism. It achieved
it by its factual reporting, and letting its
readers decide for themselves. One
would hope the powers would see the
wisdom of encouraging it to continue to
do so.
