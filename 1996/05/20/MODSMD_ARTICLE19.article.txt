## Surpassing my murk within: biology, nobility, Doritos 
### 
"Doing what is difficult is a nobly idiotic
thing to do."
Ari N., upon my boasting that I was
going to tiy writing a column without using
a particularly common lttr [sic],
I HAD A talk last Friday that's changing
all my plans: So I'm sitting on a lawn
just past my window, focusing my mind
on a bag of Doritos — my activity for four
days straight. Also, I'm smiling.
As is spring's fashion, it's an awfully
charming day out: birds yipping songs of
lust; wild grass lawns drying out, turning
brown; vapid Adonis-lookin' guys blading
on by in cut-off shorts and vicious scabs.
And I'm noticing nothing but this bag in
my hands. Hours pass.
I think it's around two as Jocasta, a old
confidant whom I find adorably insightful
(probably why I avoid talking with this
girl), jogs past. I only know this cuz Jocasta
stops running and noisily flops down on a
pillow to my right. I look up from my bag.
"You look happy," Jo says. "Why?"
"I'm munching Doritos."
"That's all it took?"
"It's my spiritual goal — I finally found
it: I'm gonna stuff my facial full of Doritos
and find favor with our world."
"And how long you at this so far?"
"Four days."
Jocasta looks up at a cloud. "I always

thought you'd hit nirvana first."
"HOW LONG YOU gonna hold this up,
chip man?" Jocasta asks finally.
"Jay said I can crunch all I want," I say,
licking my thumb of its saffron film. "Right
now I want to sit and crunch and crunch
until I pop or contract scurvy or find a writ
ing job sitting in my lap." I look down —
nothing but chips.
"And what about finals?"
"I'm gonna munch Doritos."
"And graduation."
"Doritos."
"And post graduation."
"Doritos. And so on. You know, if only I
didn't hit that bloat at that last third of a
bag, I'd just go on straight through, finish
and start up again on a Cool Ranch. Mmm
..I think, fixing a chip tightly twixt my
gum and lip. "Cool Ranch . . ."
"Uh-huh. Any plans on top of that?"
"Actually, I'm thinking about Hawaii.
You know Maui has a booming community
of non-goyim. I'm thinking I might hit rab
binical school and hop a flight to Honolu
lu."
JOCASTA GRABS A handful from my bag,
that pound pack I'm hugging as if it was an
infant of canola and corn, a Taco flavor tot.
"Any particular basis for this lunacy?" Jo
asks. "A touch of post-partum sorrow from

handing in your honors monstrosity?"
"That's not it. I'm simply admitting to
futility. I am fully conscious of that truth."
"What truth?"
"That nothing can work out."
"And how can you say this with such
conviction?" Jocasta asks calmly, playing
along.
"Jo," I say nodding in disapproval, "it's
your basic form-vs.-function, composition
vs.-capacity discussion. What a thing is
within has a nasty habit of shaping what it
is without. Trawling through a diary of a
soul — that is to say, DNA — humanity
turns into a story of not of individual option
but of fulfilling a plan."
"Ah, I got it. Your prob du jour is with
human will vs. God's will."
I tip an imaginary hat. "Yup. Origin
ordains! Mom and dad's gonads fix my
inclinations! How strong a proclivity I'll
know towards this awful thing or that,
towards drinking or smoking or shooting
up Cup o' Soup — all this starts way with
in, past my conscious mind, through my
limbic bits, and straight into my chromoso
mal map."
"And now you worry away that a swap
of an A for a C, a G for a T, is going to trans
form you into a raving, Uzi-firing, Dorito
crunching loony." Jo sighs, wiping a hand
on a sock. "An ontology of antipathy... I'm
don't know if it's amusing or if I should find

you a psychiatrist who isn't on Prozac."
"Shut up. Anyway, Dr. Cohn's switching
to Zoloft."
"As all good doctors should."
"LOOK," I TRY again, "How can I grasp
anything about my soul? This stupid-ass
physical form holds back any shot at truth.
If I hurt my foot and I'm in so much pain
that I can't think, straight, how can I think
about what is grand? If my stomach's in a
tizzy, via virus or bacillus or a similar
pathology, and all I can think about is dash
ing to a proximal potty, morality is not my
priority. It's obvious that fulfilling spiritual
goals is out of my hands until I find a way
to surpass my physical form — that awful
prison who wants nothing from our world
than to find a good burrito, to soil a knap
sack full of condoms and to watch
"M*A*S*H" in syndication until my brain
drips out of my nostrils — it's all out of my
hands."
"And this is how you want to surpass
your body? Chips? ... OK, what about that
Dalai Lama guy?"
"What about him?"
"Ijook, that ol' raisin's body looks about
as crusty as a lid full of day-old conjunctivi
tis goop and I think you'd find it a touch
hard to say Mr. Lama's wholly without any
insights into our human condition. You
think Dalai scarfs Fritos?"

"OK, so pontification is a start. But I still
think about us as not unsimilar to that
group of idiots who insist on writing in lim
iting forms. Only this many words on this
foot, that many on that. That's us! That's
humanity: a bunch of rhapsodists slaving to
fix rhyming iambs, compromising product
from a work's origin. Syllabically constrain
ing our rightful motivation for that of our
own author."
"I'm totally lost," Jo says.
"Which is my point," I say.
"Sony, I don't buy that humanity is so
quickly lost. I'm still choosing what I do,
just as I'm now choosing to avoid you until
you work through your angst about gradu
ating." Jo stands up. "You should try jog
ging, chip boy. Scrambling your brain with
its own drugs has a habit of staving off your
most nightmarish doubts."
"Can't jog," I say truthfully. "Who will
watch my Doritos?"
"Right," Jo says, turning and bouncing
away, knowing that I won't last with my
plan past that day. Which isn't to say I'm
sorry so much as back to without a plan and
still stuck in my own form.

vs.-capacity discussion. What a thing is
within has a nasty habit of shaping what it
is without. Trawling through a diary of a
soul — that is to say, DNA — humanity
turns into a story of not of individual option
but of fulfilling a plan."
"Ah, I got it. Your prob du jour is with
human will vs. God's will."
I tip an imaginary hat. "Yup. Origin
ordains! Mom and dad's gonads fix my
inclinations! How strong a proclivity I'll
know towards this awful thing or that,
towards drinking or smoking or shooting
up Cup o' Soup — all this starts way with
in, past my conscious mind, through my
limbic bits, and straight into my chromoso
mal map."
"And now you worry away that a swap
of an A for a C, a G for a T, is going to trans
form you into a raving, Uzi-firing, Dorito
crunching loony." Jo sighs, wiping a hand
on a sock. "An ontology of antipathy... I'm
don't know if it's amusing or if I should find

you a psychiatrist who isn't on Prozac."
"Shut up. Anyway, Dr. Cohn's switching
to Zoloft."
"As all good doctors should."
"LOOK," I TRY again, "How can I grasp
anything about my soul? This stupid-ass
physical form holds back any shot at truth.
If I hurt my foot and I'm in so much pain
that I can't think, straight, how can I think
about what is grand? If my stomach's in a
tizzy, via virus or bacillus or a similar
pathology, and all I can think about is dash
ing to a proximal potty, morality is not my
priority. It's obvious that fulfilling spiritual
goals is out of my hands until I find a way
to surpass my physical form — that awful
prison who wants nothing from our world
than to find a good burrito, to soil a knap
sack full of condoms and to watch
"M*A*S*H" in syndication until my brain
drips out of my nostrils — it's all out of my
hands."
"And this is how you want to surpass
your body? Chips? ... OK, what about that
Dalai Lama guy?"
"What about him?"
"Ijook, that ol' raisin's body looks about
as crusty as a lid full of day-old conjunctivi
tis goop and I think you'd find it a touch
hard to say Mr. Lama's wholly without any
insights into our human condition. You
think Dalai scarfs Fritos?"

"OK, so pontification is a start. But I still
think about us as not unsimilar to that
group of idiots who insist on writing in lim
iting forms. Only this many words on this
foot, that many on that. That's us! That's
humanity: a bunch of rhapsodists slaving to
fix rhyming iambs, compromising product
from a work's origin. Syllabically constrain
ing our rightful motivation for that of our
own author."
"I'm totally lost," Jo says.
"Which is my point," I say.
"Sony, I don't buy that humanity is so
quickly lost. I'm still choosing what I do,
just as I'm now choosing to avoid you until
you work through your angst about gradu
ating." Jo stands up. "You should try jog
ging, chip boy. Scrambling your brain with
its own drugs has a habit of staving off your
most nightmarish doubts."
"Can't jog," I say truthfully. "Who will
watch my Doritos?"
"Right," Jo says, turning and bouncing
away, knowing that I won't last with my
plan past that day. Which isn't to say I'm
sorry so much as back to without a plan and
still stuck in my own form.
