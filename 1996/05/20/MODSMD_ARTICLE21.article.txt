TALLAHASSEE, FLA. - The
second-ranked Stanford women's
tennis squad advanced to the na
tional semifinals for the 11th con
secutive season yesterday with a 5-
1 quarterfinal victory over 10th
ranked Notre Dame.
Doubles play was suspended as
the Cardinal (24-1) took five of the
six singles matches in straight sets
from the Fighting Irish (23-6) to
earn a meeting tomorrow with No.
3 Duke.
"I thought it was a very good
performance," said Stanford head
coach Frank Brennan. "I really feel
like this second round match is a
tough one. The team you're playing
deserves to be here and deserves to
be in the next round since they won
yesterday. So Notre Dame was a
team we really had to pay attention
to."
Redshirt senior Kim Shasby
(14-7) clinched the triumph for the
Cardinal with a 6-4, 6-4 victory
over Marisa Velasco. After a slow

start, Shasby fought hack to take
the first set. Shasby found herself
down again in the second set, but
denied Velasco's split attempt by
breaking her serve at 4-3 and win
ning the next three games.
"I thought [Shasby] had the piv
otal match," Brennan said. "She
played a girl who was feisty and fast
and she hung in there."
It was a familiar story on the
Nos. 5 and 6 courts as redshirt se
nior Amy Chiminello and sopho
more Julie Scott gave Stanford its
first two points of the afternoon.
Chiminello (22-1) disposed of
Notre Dame's Molly Gavin quickly,
6-3, 6-0. Not to be outdone, Scott
finished minutes later, beating
Erin Gowen, 6-2,6-2.
Cardinal junior Sandra De Silva
(19-4) followed suit, notching an
impressive win over Notre Dame
senior Wendy Crabtree, 6-4, 6-0.
Crabtree, a former No. 1 competi
tor for the Irish, moved down to
N0.3 this season after an Achilles'
tendon injury.
"Sandra had a really good play
er," Brennan said. "What is amaz
ing is not that she won but how con
vincing it was."
On the No. 1 court, Stanford
sophomore Ania Bleszynski (17-8)
bounced back from a disappointing
loss in the opening round with a 6-
3, 7-5 win over freshman Jennifer
Ilall. The Cardinal All-American
started early, serving up two aces in
the first game.
After winning the first set,

Bleszynski, rated No. 7 in collegiate
singles, faced a 5-4 deficit in the sec
ond. Hall, rated one spot below
Bleszynski in singles, failed to hold
serve at 5-5 and Bleszynski ended
the match with another ace at 6-5.
"Ania bounced back from a bad
match yesterday with a good match
today against a really good player,"
Brennan said. "That was awesome
on her part."
"I felt a lot better than yester
day," Bleszynski said. "I felt a lot
more solid in my groundstrokes. I
think I was also getting used to the
weather and was less tired than
yesterday. It was also partially
[Hall's) game compared to (Sophie]
Woroons'. I had to hit a lot more
balls yesterday. It was good to final
ly feel solid in my strokes."
Bleszynski agreed that her
opening round loss motivated her
for the quarterfinal match.
"I was pissed off about yester
day,"the sophomore said. "I don't
like being the only one to lose and I
didn't play well."
Stanford's other All-American,
junior Katie Schlukebir (19-5),
dropped the only match of the day
to Notre Dame senior Holyn Lord,
6-3, 6-4.
"Katie's fine," said the coach.
"She'll be back for [Monday's]
match. We don't have anyone that
hangs their head. They are all good
competitors."
The Stanford squad, which has
now won its last 14 attempts, was
extremely relaxed in the quarterfi

nal, most likely a result of its expe
rience.
"This is the oldest team you are
ever going to have," Brennan said.
"They have all been here at least
once, and most of them have been
here more than that. We have lead
ers who really know what it takes,
really know how to keep the team
together."
The Cardinal win marked the
third time in four years in which it
has eliminated the Fighting Irish.
"The Pope is going to excommu
nicate me, I guess," said Brennan.
The Stanford squad has not met
its semifinal opponent, the third
seeded Blue Devils (25-3), who ad
vanced to the semis with a win over
defendingchampion Texas. Duke is
riding an impressive winning
streak of their own, taking their
last 13 dual matches. The Blue
Devils have lost to No. 1 Florida
twice and to Brigham Young in
their first match of the season.
Leading the way for Duke is
freshman Vanessa Webb, who has
compiled a 22-5 record playing at
the No. 1 spot for the ACC champi
ons. Webb is currently No. 3 in the
singles rankings.
Freshman Kristin Sanderson,
Duke's No. 2 singles player, is the
next-ranked Blue Devil at No. 66.
Duke is comparatively weak in
doubles. The No. 1 Blue Devil tan
dem of Vanessa Webb and Diana
Spadea are rated No. 25 nationally


Red Byer â€” Daily file
Junior Katie Schlukebir beat Clemson's Jan Barrett on Saturday, 6-
0, 1-6, 7-5.
while Stanford's Bleszynski and
Schlukebir, whose services have
yet to be needed, are No. 2 in the
country.
Despite having not seen Duke
this season, Brennan does not
mind seeing a brand new team in
the semifinals.
"I think it's good," he said.
"It's fresh people. They don't
know us and we don't know them.
We didn't know Clemson or
Notre Dame and we handled
them pretty well. I think that
works for us."
Stanford and Duke have met
only once before in the NCAA

championships, with the Cardinal
coming out on top in the opening
round of the 1988 tournament, 5-1.
Stanford advanced to the quar
terfinals by sending Clemson home
on Saturday. The second-seeded
Cardinal defeated the 20th-ranked
Tigers, 5-1.
De Silva led the way in the open
er, drowning Annie Trepanier, 6-0,
6-0. Chiminello and Scott also won
in straight sets. Scott dropped
Emma Peetz, 6-3, 6-2. Chiminel
lo's 6-4, 6-4 win clinched the victo
ry for the Cardinal.
Schlukehir jumped all over Jan
Barrett out of the gate in the first
set, but Barrett wiped that away
and earned a split in the second.
Schlukebir took control of the
match in the third and captured a
6-0,1-6, 7-5 win.

Shasby also outlasted her oppo
nent, Devrin Carr, in a three-set
battle. After losing the first set,
Shasby stormed back in the second
and third, 4-6, 6-2,6-2.
Clemson's only win came from a
familiar source, ACC Player of the
Year, Sophie Woroons. Bleszynski
started slowly and Woroons took
advantage, taking the first set. The
Tiger freshman fought off Bleszyn
ski's bid to split sets by winning a
tiebreak in the second set. Woroons
took the match, 6-3,7-6. Stan
ford is vying for its ninth NCAA
women's tennis title. The Cardinal,
which won six straight titles from
1986-1991, has not won a champi
onship since the end of that streak.
Top-ranked Florida will tangle
with No. 6 UCLA in the event's
other semifinal.
