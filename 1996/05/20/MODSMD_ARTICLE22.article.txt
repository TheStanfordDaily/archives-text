ATHENS, GA. - On Sunday af
ternoon, the Stanford men's tennis
team advanced to the semifinals of
the NCAA tournament with a su
perbly played 4-1 win over Pacific 10
Conference rival USC. A convincing
4-0 victory over Texas on Saturday
moved the squad into Sunday's
match.
Stanford faces Georgia today as
UCLA and TCU battle in the tour
nament's other semifinal.
The win over Texas was to be ex
pected, but the Trojans have shown
in the past that they are a tough
tournament team. They had played
Stanford close twice this year, split
ting their home-and-home series.
The Cardinal won the doubles

point easily, clinching it with solid
performances by its first and second
teams. At first doubles, No. 2 Paul
Goldstein and Jim Thomas blew out
USC's No. 50 Cecil Mamiit and Kyle
Spencer, 8-3. Not to be outdone, No.
19 Jeff Salzenstein and Ryan
Wolters eased past No. 43 Adam Pe
terson and Reid Slattery to clinch
the point.
The Trojans tied the score early
in the singles competition when a
sizzling Adam Peterson, No. 97,
proved to be too much for Goldstein,
No. 28, at second singles. Peterson
hit almost all of his shots en route to
a 6-3, 6-2 win. Prior to the NCAAs,
he had won the Pac-10 individual
tournament, beating Stanford's top
player, No. 4 Salzenstein, and his
teammate, No. 3 Mamiit, on the way
to the title.
In the third singles match, Cardi
nal freshman Ryan Wolters (No. 11)
exacted a measure of revenge
against hard-hitting Manny
Ramirez (No. 43), who beat Wolters
the last time Stanford and USC met.
Down a break in the first set, he
fought back to even the set at 6-6 and
force a tie-breaker. Wolters repeat
edly nailed his returns to beat his
rival 7-3 in the tie-break.

"I was really struggling in the
first," he said. "The fans really
helped me out. I figured that if I
could win the first, I would have abig
edge in the second."
He figured right. Ramirez, appar
ently drained from the disappointing
outcome, wilted under the Georgia
sun. Wolters hardly dampened his
new shirt, blowing Ramirez off the
court in the second without drop
ping a game for a 7-6,6-0 victory.
Trojan head coach Dick Leach
said that he felt his team's chances
depended on his players' effective
ness at the bottom of the line-up.
"We knew we had to win fifth and
sixth (singles) because they are so
strong at one through four," he said.
"The Road Warriors," Stanford's
Grant Elliott and Ricky Becker,
knew the importance of their five
and six matches and proved to be up
to the task.
Elliott found himself in much the
same position as Wolters as the first
set wore on. He was engaged in a tie
breaker to decide the all important
first set with Reid Slattery, who had
beaten him in their previous en
counter. Elliott pulled out the set
