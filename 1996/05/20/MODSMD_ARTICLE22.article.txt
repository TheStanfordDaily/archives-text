ATHENS, GA. - On Sunday af
ternoon, the Stanford men's tennis
team advanced to the semifinals of
the NCAA tournament with a su
perbly played 4-1 win over Pacific 10
Conference rival USC. A convincing
4-0 victory over Texas on Saturday
moved the squad into Sunday's
match.
Stanford faces Georgia today as
UCLA and TCU battle in the tour
nament's other semifinal.
The win over Texas was to be ex
pected, but the Trojans have shown
in the past that they are a tough
tournament team. They had played
Stanford close twice this year, split
ting their home-and-home series.
The Cardinal won the doubles

point easily, clinching it with solid
performances by its first and second
teams. At first doubles, No. 2 Paul
Goldstein and Jim Thomas blew out
USC's No. 50 Cecil Mamiit and Kyle
Spencer, 8-3. Not to be outdone, No.
19 Jeff Salzenstein and Ryan
Wolters eased past No. 43 Adam Pe
terson and Reid Slattery to clinch
the point.
The Trojans tied the score early
in the singles competition when a
sizzling Adam Peterson, No. 97,
proved to be too much for Goldstein,
No. 28, at second singles. Peterson
hit almost all of his shots en route to
a 6-3, 6-2 win. Prior to the NCAAs,
he had won the Pac-10 individual
tournament, beating Stanford's top
player, No. 4 Salzenstein, and his
teammate, No. 3 Mamiit, on the way
to the title.
In the third singles match, Cardi
nal freshman Ryan Wolters (No. 11)
exacted a measure of revenge
against hard-hitting Manny
Ramirez (No. 43), who beat Wolters
the last time Stanford and USC met.
Down a break in the first set, he
fought back to even the set at 6-6 and
force a tie-breaker. Wolters repeat
edly nailed his returns to beat his
rival 7-3 in the tie-break.

"I was really struggling in the
first," he said. "The fans really
helped me out. I figured that if I
could win the first, I would have abig
edge in the second."
He figured right. Ramirez, appar
ently drained from the disappointing
outcome, wilted under the Georgia
sun. Wolters hardly dampened his
new shirt, blowing Ramirez off the
court in the second without drop
ping a game for a 7-6,6-0 victory.
Trojan head coach Dick Leach
said that he felt his team's chances
depended on his players' effective
ness at the bottom of the line-up.
"We knew we had to win fifth and
sixth (singles) because they are so
strong at one through four," he said.
"The Road Warriors," Stanford's
Grant Elliott and Ricky Becker,
knew the importance of their five
and six matches and proved to be up
to the task.
Elliott found himself in much the
same position as Wolters as the first
set wore on. He was engaged in a tie
breaker to decide the all important
first set with Reid Slattery, who had
beaten him in their previous en
counter. Elliott pulled out the set

with a 7-5 tie-break victory, then fed
off the momentum he had gained to
win the second, 6-4.
At this stage, the Cardinal led 3-1,
with seniors Salzenstein and Becker
leading their opposition by one set,
simultaneously engaged in second
set tie-breaks at first and sixth sin
gles respectively.
Salzenstein finished first, but,
unfortunately for the Stanford cap
tain, it was in Mamiit's favor, as the
Trojan pulled out a terribly close 8-6
tie-break victory. It was the conclu
sion of a gutsy comeback for the
USC freshman. Afler losing th" first
set badly, 6-2, he was down 5-2 in (he
second before coming back to win it
7-6.
The first singles match was never
finished — moments after Mamiit's
comeback, Becker put away Fernan
do Samayoa with a power forehand
down the line, clinching the match
with a 7-5,7-6 (7-3) victory.
It was a special match for liecker,
as he had lost the deciding point to
Samayoa in Stanford's loss to USC
at the end of the regular season ."I'm
so proud of Ricky for coming
through today," said head coach
Dick Gould. "For him to win the
clincher showed a lot of heart."
There were some problems
against Texas on Saturday, but not
for Stanford. Saturday nieht, the

lights went out in Georgia. Literally.
With Stanford already in possession
of the doubles point and leading in
five of six singles matches, the lights
of Henry Feild Stadium crashed
with a loud bang, putting a halt to all
tennis action. Three more loud
bangs and nearly two hours later,
the match was moved indoors by
NCAA officials. It was 10:30 p.m. by
this point, and players were becom
ing restless.
" I guess we had to wait so long be
cause after the Georgia people
couldn't blow up the lights, they
called an electrician," Salzenstein
said. "But as hard as the electrician
tried, he wasn't able to blow up the
place either. This match should have
ended a lot sooner."
Because the indoor facilities in
clude only four courts and the Duke-
IJSC contests was still in progress,
only two Longhorn-Cardinal match
es were able to take place at a time.
Coaches decided that the second and
third singles matches should go on
first, as they were closest to conclud
ing.
At third, Wolters stepped indoors
leading 6-0,2-2. He proceeded to win
four consecutive games, to take the
match. Becker stepped onto
Wolter's vacated court and finished
ofTLonghorn Blake Rue 6-2,6-3.
Meanwhile, with the Cardinal
needing only one more point to
clinch the match, Goldstein found
himself in the midst of a dogfight at
second singles. Stanford's clutch
sophomore jumped to a huge 6-0, 3-

2 lead outdoors against No. 89 Paul
Martin, but the big serving Long
horn gained a big edge when the
match was moved to the faster in
door surface.
Martin crawled back into the
match and forced a tie-break in the
second set. The two traded points in
the tie-breaker, neither able to earn a
point on his opponents serve. Then,
leading 6-5, Martin was finally able to
win a point on Goldstein's serve, set
ting himself up with a great return.
Martin carried his momentum
into the third, vaulting to a 5-1 lead
to begin the set. "I've never seen him
play this well," said one of Martin's
teammates. "Somebody needs to
wake this kid up."
But Goldstein remained calm
and fought back to even the score at
5-5 to force another tie-breaker.
This time, Goldstein got to Martin's
serve early and stepped to a 6-3 lead
before winning 7-4. This gave Stan
ford a hard-earned 4-0 win, and a
berth in the quarterfinals against
use.
Georgia represents a very
tough obstacle for the Cardinal.
There are certain to be over 3,000
fans present to root on their
beloved Bulldogs in the taxing
heat. Georgia has amassed a 22-3
record this year and absolutely de
molished SEC rival No. 4 Missis
sippi State, 4-0, to reach the semis.
In Stanford's only encounter with
the Bulldogs this year, they es
caped by the narrowest of margins
with a 4-3 win.

Stanford 4
USC 1

ATHENS, GA. - On Sunday af
ternoon, the Stanford men's tennis
team advanced to the semifinals of
the NCAA tournament with a su
perbly played 4-1 win over Pacific 10
Conference rival USC. A convincing
4-0 victory over Texas on Saturday
moved the squad into Sunday's
match.
Stanford faces Georgia today as
UCLA and TCU battle in the tour
nament's other semifinal.
The win over Texas was to be ex
pected, but the Trojans have shown
in the past that they are a tough
tournament team. They had played
Stanford close twice this year, split
ting their home-and-home series.
The Cardinal won the doubles

point easily, clinching it with solid
performances by its first and second
teams. At first doubles, No. 2 Paul
Goldstein and Jim Thomas blew out
USC's No. 50 Cecil Mamiit and Kyle
Spencer, 8-3. Not to be outdone, No.
19 Jeff Salzenstein and Ryan
Wolters eased past No. 43 Adam Pe
terson and Reid Slattery to clinch
the point.
The Trojans tied the score early
in the singles competition when a
sizzling Adam Peterson, No. 97,
proved to be too much for Goldstein,
No. 28, at second singles. Peterson
hit almost all of his shots en route to
a 6-3, 6-2 win. Prior to the NCAAs,
he had won the Pac-10 individual
tournament, beating Stanford's top
player, No. 4 Salzenstein, and his
teammate, No. 3 Mamiit, on the way
to the title.
In the third singles match, Cardi
nal freshman Ryan Wolters (No. 11)
exacted a measure of revenge
against hard-hitting Manny
Ramirez (No. 43), who beat Wolters
the last time Stanford and USC met.
Down a break in the first set, he
fought back to even the set at 6-6 and
force a tie-breaker. Wolters repeat
edly nailed his returns to beat his
rival 7-3 in the tie-break.

"I was really struggling in the
first," he said. "The fans really
helped me out. I figured that if I
could win the first, I would have abig
edge in the second."
He figured right. Ramirez, appar
ently drained from the disappointing
outcome, wilted under the Georgia
sun. Wolters hardly dampened his
new shirt, blowing Ramirez off the
court in the second without drop
ping a game for a 7-6,6-0 victory.
Trojan head coach Dick Leach
said that he felt his team's chances
depended on his players' effective
ness at the bottom of the line-up.
"We knew we had to win fifth and
sixth (singles) because they are so
strong at one through four," he said.
"The Road Warriors," Stanford's
Grant Elliott and Ricky Becker,
knew the importance of their five
and six matches and proved to be up
to the task.
Elliott found himself in much the
same position as Wolters as the first
set wore on. He was engaged in a tie
breaker to decide the all important
first set with Reid Slattery, who had
beaten him in their previous en
counter. Elliott pulled out the set

with a 7-5 tie-break victory, then fed
off the momentum he had gained to
win the second, 6-4.
At this stage, the Cardinal led 3-1,
with seniors Salzenstein and Becker
leading their opposition by one set,
simultaneously engaged in second
set tie-breaks at first and sixth sin
gles respectively.
Salzenstein finished first, but,
unfortunately for the Stanford cap
tain, it was in Mamiit's favor, as the
Trojan pulled out a terribly close 8-6
tie-break victory. It was the conclu
sion of a gutsy comeback for the
USC freshman. Afler losing th" first
set badly, 6-2, he was down 5-2 in (he
second before coming back to win it
7-6.
The first singles match was never
finished — moments after Mamiit's
comeback, Becker put away Fernan
do Samayoa with a power forehand
down the line, clinching the match
with a 7-5,7-6 (7-3) victory.
It was a special match for liecker,
as he had lost the deciding point to
Samayoa in Stanford's loss to USC
at the end of the regular season ."I'm
so proud of Ricky for coming
through today," said head coach
Dick Gould. "For him to win the
clincher showed a lot of heart."
There were some problems
against Texas on Saturday, but not
for Stanford. Saturday nieht, the

lights went out in Georgia. Literally.
With Stanford already in possession
of the doubles point and leading in
five of six singles matches, the lights
of Henry Feild Stadium crashed
with a loud bang, putting a halt to all
tennis action. Three more loud
bangs and nearly two hours later,
the match was moved indoors by
NCAA officials. It was 10:30 p.m. by
this point, and players were becom
ing restless.
" I guess we had to wait so long be
cause after the Georgia people
couldn't blow up the lights, they
called an electrician," Salzenstein
said. "But as hard as the electrician
tried, he wasn't able to blow up the
place either. This match should have
ended a lot sooner."
Because the indoor facilities in
clude only four courts and the Duke-
IJSC contests was still in progress,
only two Longhorn-Cardinal match
es were able to take place at a time.
Coaches decided that the second and
third singles matches should go on
first, as they were closest to conclud
ing.
At third, Wolters stepped indoors
leading 6-0,2-2. He proceeded to win
four consecutive games, to take the
match. Becker stepped onto
Wolter's vacated court and finished
ofTLonghorn Blake Rue 6-2,6-3.
Meanwhile, with the Cardinal
needing only one more point to
clinch the match, Goldstein found
himself in the midst of a dogfight at
second singles. Stanford's clutch
sophomore jumped to a huge 6-0, 3-

2 lead outdoors against No. 89 Paul
Martin, but the big serving Long
horn gained a big edge when the
match was moved to the faster in
door surface.
Martin crawled back into the
match and forced a tie-break in the
second set. The two traded points in
the tie-breaker, neither able to earn a
point on his opponents serve. Then,
leading 6-5, Martin was finally able to
win a point on Goldstein's serve, set
ting himself up with a great return.
Martin carried his momentum
into the third, vaulting to a 5-1 lead
to begin the set. "I've never seen him
play this well," said one of Martin's
teammates. "Somebody needs to
wake this kid up."
But Goldstein remained calm
and fought back to even the score at
5-5 to force another tie-breaker.
This time, Goldstein got to Martin's
serve early and stepped to a 6-3 lead
before winning 7-4. This gave Stan
ford a hard-earned 4-0 win, and a
berth in the quarterfinals against
use.
Georgia represents a very
tough obstacle for the Cardinal.
There are certain to be over 3,000
fans present to root on their
beloved Bulldogs in the taxing
heat. Georgia has amassed a 22-3
record this year and absolutely de
molished SEC rival No. 4 Missis
sippi State, 4-0, to reach the semis.
