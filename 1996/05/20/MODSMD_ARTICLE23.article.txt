# Woods leads men to Stanford's first-ever Western Regional title

### Brian Lee Staff writer 
With their pride at stake, the
chronically-underestimated
Stanford men's golfers provided a
powerful rebuttal to doubters,
winning the NCAA Western Re
gional Championship for the first
time in team history.
"[lt's] absolutely wonderful,"
said head coach Wally Goodwin.
"The guys feel great about this
and I am really proud of what
they've been able to do.
"We've had some great teams
here and never even come close to
winning, so for the guys to go out
and take the title was just a huge
accomplishment."
Down by a stroke to second
round leader Pepperdine, the Car
dinal fought back tenaciously,
eventually stealing the lead and
holding off a hard-charging Ari
zona State squad to take the
crown by a single stroke over the
Sun Devils and the Runnin'
Rebels of Nevada-Las Vegas.
"We were just sticking around
for the entire tournament,"
Goodwin said. "We just kept our
selves in a position to win and
were able to come through at the
end.
"I really think our perfor

mance was the result of our
preparation. I've worked this
team harder than any other squad
I've ever coached and they've re
sponded beautifully, always look
ing to go that extra mile. From an
effort standpoint, I think we real
ly deserved to finish right up there
with the best teams."
However, if seeing his team
win was not a surprise for Good
win, he was all alone in that re
gard. Ranked 15th prior to the
tournament, Stanford was gener
ally considered a long shot among
a field that included four of the
top 10 teams in the nation, includ
ing No. 2 ASU and No. 3 UNLV.
"There were plenty of great
teams competing and it was nice
to perform well against them,"
Goodwin said. "Arizona State
may well be a better squad than us
this year, but I think we showed a
lot of the people who have been
selling us short that we can play
with anybody."
Heading up the individual per
formances, Ail-American Tiger
Woods provided his typically spec
tacular play, carrying the lead
from wire to wire and adding the
regional title to his already mas
sive list of accomplishments. The
sophomore was relentless, pro
ducing three below-par rounds

and distancing himself from run
ner-up Mike Pavao from Hawaii
by six strokes. Woods' capped his
performance with the low score of
the tournament, overcoming four
par-three bogeys with two eagles
en route to a 4-under-par 67.
"Tiger was a little disappoint
ing on those last par threes, but he
was able to make it up," Goodwin
said. "That's part of what makes
him such a phenomenal player."
Perhaps overshadowed by his
teammate's success, senior cap
tain Jerry Chang stepped up in a
major way after a horrendous
first round left him near the bot
tom of the field. Chang ensured
that his final home appearance
would not be a forgettable one,
celebrating his final trip through
the links by firing a crucial 69 on
Saturday and finishing 33rd.
Flanked by Goodwin, who walked
the final nine with him as part of a
senior tradition, Chang set the
back nine on fire, scoring a seem
ingly impossible birdie on the par
three 14th with an amazing five
iron shot left him just four feet
from the pin.
"Everybody had been bogeying
that hole," Goodwin said. "So for
Jerry to go out and get us a two
