# Becker wraps up another victory
## Senior wins his second clinching match in NCAA play

ATHENS, GA. — Ask any col
lege tennis player what his ulti
mate goal is, and he will tell you he
wants to win a team champi
onship.
Then ask him what his real goal
is. Ask him what he dreams of
when he goes to sleep.
He will tell you one thing: to
clinch a match, preferably an im
portant one, for his team. The
dreams might change from time to
time — perhaps one night he drills
an ace to put his team over the top,
on another night he sticks a volley
— but the thrust of the dream re
mains the same: gaining the most
crucial of victories while eveiyone
else watches.
For many players, the scenario
forever remains nothing more
than merely a dream. For Stanford
senior Ricky Becker, however, the
dream has become a reality two
years running at the Dan Magill
Tennis Complex in Athens, Ga.,
site of the 1995 and 1996 NCAA
Men's Tennis Championships.
Last year, Becker clinched the
4-0 victory over Mississippi that
gave Stanford its 13th national
championship. Yesterday, the No.
6 singles specialist ended the quar
terfinal confrontation with USC
by pulling out a 7-5, 7-6(7-3) victo
ry over Fernando Samayoa.
