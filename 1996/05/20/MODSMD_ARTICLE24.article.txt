# Becker wraps up another victory
## Senior wins his second clinching match in NCAA play 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior Staff writer 
ATHENS, GA. — Ask any col
lege tennis player what his ulti
mate goal is, and he will tell you he
wants to win a team champi
onship.
Then ask him what his real goal
is. Ask him what he dreams of
when he goes to sleep.
He will tell you one thing: to
clinch a match, preferably an im
portant one, for his team. The
dreams might change from time to
time — perhaps one night he drills
an ace to put his team over the top,
on another night he sticks a volley
— but the thrust of the dream re
mains the same: gaining the most
crucial of victories while eveiyone
else watches.
For many players, the scenario
forever remains nothing more
than merely a dream. For Stanford
senior Ricky Becker, however, the
dream has become a reality two
years running at the Dan Magill
Tennis Complex in Athens, Ga.,
site of the 1995 and 1996 NCAA
Men's Tennis Championships.
Last year, Becker clinched the
4-0 victory over Mississippi that
gave Stanford its 13th national
championship. Yesterday, the No.
6 singles specialist ended the quar
terfinal confrontation with USC
by pulling out a 7-5, 7-6(7-3) victo
ry over Fernando Samayoa.

Senior Ricky Becker clinched Stanford's second round match with a
win over USC's Fernando Samayoa 7-5,7-6.
On each occasion, Bepker nailed
shut the coffin of the other team at
a stage in the match when momen
tum was beginning to shift away
from the Cardinal. And on each oc
casion, Becker' teammate Jeff
Salzenstein had his own chance to
clinch the match, but was prevent
ed from doing so by feisty oppo
nents unwilling to go down without
engaging in a protracted, three-set
battle.

Last year, it was Mahesh Bhu
pathi who pushed Salzenstein to
three sets. This year, it was Cecil
Mamiit's turn to prevent Salzen
stein from basking in the glory of
match-clincher. With his team
one defeat from the brink of elimi
nation, the USC freshman rallied
from a 2-5 deficit to force a
tiebreak, then forced a third set by
taking the breaker 8-6.
Though Mamiit said he "felt
good in the third set," Becker's
quick work made it so that one will
never know whether Mamiit's new
life would have led the Trojan to
victory in that tightly contested No.

1 singles match.
Before even one game could be
completed in the third set, Becker
had staked himself to a 4-3 lead in
the tiebreak. By then, he said he
"had a general feeling [that his
match could be the clincher] just
from the mass of people that came
over to watch." After Samayoa net
ted his return of Becker's second
serve to push the lead to 5-3, Beck
er clenched his fists in anticipation.
His next serve was his best of the
match: a blistering ace down the
middle. Then, much as he did in his
previous match-clincher, Becker
chose to attack the net by running

around a forehand, and the aggres
siveness paid off: Samayoa's return
never made it over the net.
Salzenstein's match was sus
pended.
"I'm happy we won, but 1 feel u
little bad for Jeff," Becker said af
terward.
For Salzenstein, a four-year
starter who lost a match that would
have won the 1994 championships
for the Cardinal and dropped the
deciding match (in a tiebreak) of a
4-3 loss to UCLA earlier this year,
the dream of clinching a big match
remains elusive — thanks in no
small part to Becker. But you

wouldn't be able to tell from talking
to Salzenstein
"As my roommate, [Becker] is
always stealing my thunder,"
Salzenstein said. "I feel great about
it because,we are playing tomor
row. I don't feel like I choked in any
way. I have got to give a lot of cred
it to Grant (Elliott) and Ricky for
coming up big."
As anyone can tell, Salzenstein
is a class act. And he will be fine,
even happy, if his team wins the
two remaining matches of his colle
giate career — regardless of
whether he is involved in the out
come.

In fact, the level of talent at the
bottom of the Cardinal lineup is
such that over the next few days,
Becker could very well end up
adding another match-clincher to
his list of achievements. Because
the other squads remaining in the
tournament have tremendous No.
1 singles players who will certainly
give Salzenstein two battles to re
member, his match will only be the
clincher if it is one of the last left on
the courts.
It would be fitting for Salzen
stein, who has twice been elected
team captain, to at last do the hon
ors of clinching a match in Athens.
