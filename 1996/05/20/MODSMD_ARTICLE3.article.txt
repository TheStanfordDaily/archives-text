Stanford women's basketball player Bobbie
Kelsey yesterday remembered one of her fij&t ex
periences being a woman in the media.
A senior who hopes to work in the communi
cation industry if her attempt at the profession
al basketball circuit doesn't pan out, Kelsey
spoke about Sports Illustrated magazine's cover
age of the NCAA women's basketball champi

media.
"When we went to the Final Four last season,
we got two pages in the Sports Illustrated," said
Kelsey. "The men got somewhere around 12

pages. Our game was definitely more exciting
than two pages worth of coverage."
Kelsey was participating in one of 16 panels
that made up the "After Beijing '95: Caucus on
Women and the Media" conference held yester
day in History Corner.
The convention was the first of a series of
working assemblies by the California Women's
Agenda, which aims to implement the Beijing
Platform for Action which was unanimously
adopted last September by 189 countries at the
United Nations World Conference on Women
held in China.
The group is working in 12 separate task
forces to address the critical areas of concern rec
ognized at the U.N. conference as main obstacles

to women's advancement worldwide and to
adapt strategies that meet the needs of the peo
ple of California.
"Today is the first step in bringing Beijing
back and taking California forward," said coordi
nator Marilyn Fowler. "Every girl and woman of
all races, culture and religion from over 100 dif
ferent organizations are working together to
write California's own platform based on the
Beijing platform. The ideas of each will bo fac
tored into each plank for the platform which will
be combined and then distributed throughout
the state."
