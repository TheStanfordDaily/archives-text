Stanford women's basketball player Bobbie
Kelsey yesterday remembered one of her fij&t ex
periences being a woman in the media.
A senior who hopes to work in the communi
cation industry if her attempt at the profession
al basketball circuit doesn't pan out, Kelsey
spoke about Sports Illustrated magazine's cover
age of the NCAA women's basketball champi
onsh ip at a conference discussing women and the
media.
"When we went to the Final Four last season,
we got two pages in the Sports Illustrated," said
Kelsey. "The men got somewhere around 12

pages. Our game was definitely more exciting
than two pages worth of coverage."
Kelsey was participating in one of 16 panels
that made up the "After Beijing '95: Caucus on
Women and the Media" conference held yester
day in History Corner.
The convention was the first of a series of
working assemblies by the California Women's
Agenda, which aims to implement the Beijing
Platform for Action which was unanimously
adopted last September by 189 countries at the
United Nations World Conference on Women
held in China.
The group is working in 12 separate task
forces to address the critical areas of concern rec
ognized at the U.N. conference as main obstacles

to women's advancement worldwide and to
adapt strategies that meet the needs of the peo
ple of California.
"Today is the first step in bringing Beijing
back and taking California forward," said coordi
nator Marilyn Fowler. "Every girl and woman of
all races, culture and religion from over 100 dif
ferent organizations are working together to
write California's own platform based on the
Beijing platform. The ideas of each will bo fac
tored into each plank for the platform which will
be combined and then distributed throughout
the state."
More than 50 women from various media or-
ganizations led the 16 panel ses
sions which addressed issues such
as education, violence against
women and the media's responsi
bilities toward women.
Speaking at an opening assem
bly in Annenberg Auditorium, au
thor Neera Sohoni, an affiliated
scholar at the Stanford Institute
for Research on Women and Gen
der and an adviser to the United
Nations on girls' issues worldwide,
gave an overview of the history of
the media mid its impact on various
societies.
Sohoni criticized the current
media, referring to them as "our
government's mouthpiece."

"Freedom of press is limited to
those who own it," said Sohoni,
who advocates the need for con
sumers of media presentations to
translate the dismantled global is
sues into local concerns and views.
In the discussion of women and
sports in the media, Kelsey joined
Anna Huntington, freelance writer
and Olympic medalist, and Sandra
Bateman, a public relations officer.
Huntington and Bateman ad
mitted there is a long way to go in
the mainstream media before
women are accepted as either re
porters or subjects of coverage.
I lowever, they pointed out some
positive recent changes such as fe
male reporters on ESPN and more
companies willing to sponsor
women of color.
"Spoils is one alternative girls
have to show what they can Ik* and

who they are," said Huntington.
"Sports is a powerful and impor
tant impact on our society, and re
alistic coverage on female athletes
is key" to women's movement.
Huntington argued that while
male athletes are given an incredi
ble spectrum of personalities, fe
male athletes are often "plugged
into a pigeonhole" image. She men
tioned Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya
Harding as examples of this one-di
mensional portrayal of personali
ties, stating that the media labeled
them as "bad" and was not willing
to delve deeper into their personal
ities.
The task forces of the California
group will assemble next at San
Francisco State University on June
28 to report on their deliberations.
There, delegates will ratify a com
prehensive plan of action.
