# Transcripts may soon show GPAs
## Registrar seeking student opinion

The University may print grade
point averages on undergraduate
transcripts as soon as 1997 if stu
dents support the idea.

In preliminary
discussions with
students in sever
al dormitories,
however, Regis
trar Roger Print
up said he has dis
covered that not
everyone is happy
with the proposal.
The Faculty

Senate's Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement asked
Printup last quarter to gauge stu
dent reaction to the issue and report
back this quarter. So far he has met
with three groups of students, about
25 in all.
"All the groups recognized that
CPA is not an infallible indicator of
academic performance. However,
people acknowledge it is a statistic
that is commonly used in higher ed

Printup added that "the majority
of other colleges have a CPA" and
that "the most common practice is

to have it on the transcript, with no
option."
Currently, the only way for Stan
ford students to obtain their GPA is
to calculate it themselves. The Reg
istrar's Office provides a flier ex
plaining the procedure, but some
students still feel baffled by it.
Because students are asked for
their GPA, or, as the University calls
them, "LGI" — letter-grade indica
tor — so frequently, the committee
decided two quarters ago to have the
registrar automatically calculate
them, said Physics Prof. Mason
Yearian, chair of the committee.
Yearian cited "external and inter
nal sources" that ask for grade aver
ages — federal loan programs and
the NCAA being examples of exter
nal sources, and academic depart
ments being examples of internal
ones. Departments often ask for stu
dents' averages when seeking to
award scholarships. Phi Beta Kappa
also uses them, as does the Universi
ty to award the honor of graduation
"with distinction."
The question now, said Yearian,
is whether or not to publish the av
erages.
"The faculty said that really the
