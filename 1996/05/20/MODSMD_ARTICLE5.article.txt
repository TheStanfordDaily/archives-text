### Nadia Elghobashi Contributing writer 
How to prepare students for re
sponsible service and citizenship
in the 21st century was the topic of
discussion at the annual National
Advisory Board conference last
weekend.
The two-day conference at the
Haas Center for Public Service
marked the 10th anniversary of
the center's founding.
The theme of the conference
was"The Changing Face of Ser
vice and Service-Learning at Stan
ford: New Challenges, New Oppor
tunities." Conference goals in
cluded assessing the center's
progress to date and determining
ways to expand the center.
Peter Bing, a Stanford alumnus

and former chair of the Board of
Trustees, said at the conference
that he hopes Stanford students
will improve their own community
in addition to serving surrounding
communities such as East Palo
Alto. He said volunteers could
"hone" service skills by working
with people on campus, although
he admitted that working with
people you live with is challenging.
"When you live night and day
with those whom you're trying to
influence, it's difficult," Bingsaid.
"But the community we work with
is first our own."
Nadinne Cruz, associate direc
tor of Haas, discussed the chal
lenges facing the center today.
"What students demand from
us far exceeds what we're capable
of giving right now. Students truly
want to change things in society —
they're not doing service as a sym
bolic gesture," Cruz said.
Cruz said the motto, "To serve
well, one must learn well" should
be expanded. She said an accurate
motto should include, "To serve
well, one must learn new knowl
edge to adequately address chal
lenges of society."
Senior Julia Lanoff, an active
member of Haas, said the center
does not reach students who
haven't shown interest in service.
She said some see the center as
"inwardly focused."
"If you're involved, it's easy to
know what's coins on. But we

need to spread the word," Lanoff
said.
Students expressed the need
for the center to bridge gaps across
different racial, ethnic and eco
nomic groups.
The center, which has been
lauded as the best center of its
kind in the United States, was es
tablished in 1985 by then-Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy in
response to students' desire to
serve their community.
Its purpose, as stated in the
background paper to the confer
ence, was to "build an excellent,
institutionalized program to sur
vive changes in University leader
ship, priorities and budgets."
The center was initially called
the Center for Public Service. As
it expanded, the Haas family of
San Francisco endowed the cen
ter, and it was renamed the Haas
Center for Public Service.
